This includes 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs.\nNote: The transcript selection could be a problematic situation due to different splicing versions; therefore, we recommend selecting the longest transcript and then choose exons that are shared in all splice variants. If RNAseq data is available, it is convenient to select exons where RNA is clearly detected. And the targeted sequence can be analyzed to rule out potential mutations; however, as it will be discussed later that this step is not required.\ngRNAs design\nTiming: 30\u00a0minSo far, there is not a systematic method or algorithm to design CRISPR-RfxCas13d gRNA to be injected into animal embryos. Two alternative methods have been tested with variable gRNA activity in vivo. First, gRNA design can be based on target accessibility according to the data in mammalian cell culture where gRNA activity is highly associated with target accessibility based on the three-dimensional conformation of the mRNA targets (Abudayyeh et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Kushawah et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])) (option 1). Alternatively, there is a new approach for gRNA design according to an analysis in mammalian cell culture experiments that also proposes new gRNAs optimizations (Wessels et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). This gRNA design tool efficiently predicts CRISPR-RfxCas13d activity in mammalian cell culture experiments where gRNA and RfxCas13d expression is driven by constitutive promoters (Wessels et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) (option 2). Additionally, the tool also predicts potential off-targets in silico (0, 1, 2 mismatches between gRNA and RNA target). While this algorithm can efficiently predict CRISPR-RfxCas13d in mammalian cell culture, it has not been systematically tested in animal embryos. Therefore, in this protocol, we detail the different steps for the gRNAs design for both methods. Since none of the methods ensures that selected gRNAs are highly efficient in vivo, we recommend designing 3 gRNAs for each gene in the coding sequence region where the targeting is generally more efficient (Kushawah et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Wessels et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) with 50 nt of distance between them to avoid potential competition between gRNAs to access the target.\nNote: We highly recommend designing and using an additional set of 3 gRNAs that can help to validate and confirm potential phenotypes and rule out off-target effects (see mRNA knockdown validation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.11] section).Note: If you choose to follow option 1 (gRNAs design based on target accessibility), proceed to step 2 and then follow steps 4\u201375. If you want to use option 2 (gRNAs design based on Wessels et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) proceed to step 3 and then follow to steps 4\u201375.\nOption 1 \u2013 Target accessibility in silico\nTo find the most convenient mRNA region to be targeted, an in silico analysis is performed using RNAfold software (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at//cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi[href=http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at//cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi]) (Lorenz et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]):\nCopy your cDNA sequence and paste it into the box.\nSelect the following options: minimum free energy (MFE) and partition function, avoid isolated base pairs, interactive RNA secondary structure plot, RNA secondary structure plots with reliability annotation (Partition function folding only) and Mountain plot.\nSelect: Proceed.\nSelect: color by base-pairing probability.\nSearch for protospacers of 22\u201323 nt with higher accessibility in silico (low base-pairing probability from minimum free energy predictions), blue or green regions, that belong to the Coding Sequence (CDS) and select 3 different protospacer spaced out across the transcript with a minimum distance of 50 nt between them to avoid an overlap between gRNAs, whenever possible (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Embryos were injected with 3\u00a0ng of RfxCas13d protein (Cas13d) and 300 pg of 3 gRNAs (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) targeting the ORF of tbxta mRNA. Different in vitro transcribed gRNAs were used: while gNTL-WT has the wild-type stem loop and a spacer of 22 nt, gNTL-SLD has the stem loop disruption described in Wessels et\u00a0al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] and a spacer of 23 nt.

Scale bar, 0.25\u00a0mm.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_7.csv\nBold and blue sequence indicates the protospacer sequence of 22 nt (WT).\nNote: Recently, spacers of 23 nt and with a disruption in the first base-pair of the gRNA proximal stem loop have been shown to enhance the mRNA targeting in mammalian cell culture (Wessels et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). We have tested this enhanced gRNA version with a spacer of 23 nt and the stem loop disruption in zebrafish embryos (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) and we have also observed a slightly higher efficiency (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) that can be translated in higher phenotype penetrance (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). However, we have found that these optimized gRNAs are frequently in vitro transcribed at lower efficiency (likely due to the modification in the stem loop disruption) potentially limiting their use (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). For this reason, we normally generate gRNAs containing a spacer of 22\u201323 nt with the wild-type stem loop by in vitro transcription (IVT) and we preferentially order chemically synthesized gRNAs when they have the stem loop disruption and a spacer of 23 nt. In this protocol, we will detail the generation of gRNA by IVT for the CRISPR-RfxCas13d system with the 22 nt spacer and the wild-type stem loop structure.\nOption 2 \u2013 Mammalian cell culture-based algorithm\nSearch for https://cas13design.nygenome.org/[href=https://cas13design.nygenome.org/] to the gRNA design according to Wessels et\u00a0al.

(Also, you can search the transcript ID in the table using the gene symbol or gene name).\nIntroduce the Ensembl transcript ID in the search box.\nSelect the top 3 gRNAs targeting the Coding Sequence since gRNAs targeting UTR are less efficient (Wessels et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Kushawah et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: Selected gRNAs using this approach will have spacers of 23 nt.\nThe DNA template to generate the gRNA is produced by fill-in-PCR with a universal primer and a specific primer. The universal primer (imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx8.jpg) contains the T7 promoter (in pink) and the processed direct repeat for RfxCas13d crRNAs (in blue) preceded by 5\u2032GG. Specific primer (imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx9.jpg) contains the binding specific sequence (in green) and 20 nt of the repeat sequence in reverse complement orientation (in blue) (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: The \u201c5-GG\u201d in the universal primer is required for the efficient in vitro transcription reaction mediated by T7 RNA polymerase.\nNote: Spacers can have 23 nt with the wild type stem loop but we did not systematically compare the efficiency of this formulation to others discussed here.\nNote: If a gRNA with the stem loop disruption wants to be generated, the universal would be: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx10.jpg\nNote: For example, injection of the mRNA encoding for RfxCas13d with gRNA targeting tbxta mRNA in zebrafish embryos should compromise notochord formation as well as a lack of posterior structures (no-tail phenotype). We selected 3 protospacers (22 nt) for the targeting of tbxta after the in-silico analysis: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx11.jpg (in this case we selected them based on option 1 corresponding to regions with low probability of base pairing in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). To generate the DNA Template, we order the following primers:Universal primer: This sequence contains the T7-promoter and the processed direct repeat for RfxCas13d preceded by 5\u2032GG: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx12.jpg Specific primers: This sequence contains 22nt of the specific protospacer and 20 nt of the repeat sequence in reverse complement orientation. Example primers for targeting tbxta mRNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_8.csv\nNote: gRNAs oligos can be ordered through companies such as IDT (www.idtdna.com[href=http://www.idtdna.com]). Oligos can be purchased as desalted and in minimal amounts.\nAlternatives: gRNAs can be ordered as chemically synthesized directly through companies such as Synthego (https://www.synthego.com/company[href=https://www.synthego.com/company]). In that case, it is not necessary to include the 5\u2032-GG, and the gRNA sequence is the correspond tail (processed direct repeat, Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) of RfxCas13d gRNAs (imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx16.jpg) plus the reverse-complement of the 22\u201323 nt protospacer sequence (in green). Indeed, we mainly order chemically synthesized enhanced gRNAs (mentioned above) containing the stem loop disruption and a spacer of 23 nt (Wessels et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nExample of enhanced chemically synthesized gRNAs for targeting tbxta mRNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_9.csv\nCritical: Currently, the design of gRNAs for RfxCas13d for targeting in vivo has some limitations, since there is not a validated strategy predictions model to design and select efficient gRNAs for in vivo approaches, and we have found gRNAs with low activity. To increase the probability of having a high level of depletion, we use 3\u20134 gRNAs together targeting the same RNA. In addition to using 3\u20134 gRNAs, we also recommend using individual gRNAs that have been tested to show higher mRNA depletion (see mRNA knockdown validation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.11] section), to minimize potential off-target effects and to provide reproducible results independent of the guide used.Note: We have observed that chemically synthesized gRNAs, either with wild type or disrupted stem loop, enhance the targeting of maternally provided in zebrafish embryos (Kushawah et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). That could be related with the highly purity and quality of these gRNAs and their more robust production since in vitro transcription may have byproducts and frequently show variability in the gRNA production among different DNA templates for distinct gRNAs (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Schematic representation of the fill-in-PCR to generate the DNA template\nThe Universal Primer contains the T7 promoter followed by 5\u2032GG and the processed direct repeat for RfxCas13d gRNA, meanwhile, the Specific Primer contains the repeat sequence in reverse complement orientation to hybrid with the universal primer and the specific binding sequence of 22 nt. The product of the Fill-in-PCR is the DNA template that contains the T7 promoter with the 2 \u201cGG\u201d (19 nt), the processed direct repeat (30 nt) and the specific binding site sequence (22nt).\nDNA template generation\nTiming: 3 h\nAnneal universal primer and specific primer.\nMix the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_10.csv\nEnter the following program in a thermocycler:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_11.csv\nNote: If several gRNAs are used to target one gene in the same injection, the specific gRNA primers can be mixed in equimolar concentrations and then use 5\u00a0\u03bcL of this mix (100\u00a0\u03bcM of the total gRNA primer content) in the PCR reaction and a single in vitro transcription reaction is performed in the next step. Alternatively, each gRNA can be generated individually and be purified together in the same column (considering the maximal amount of RNA that each column can purify). Finally, gRNAs can be individually produced, purified and quantified and mixed at equal concentrations to generate the pool.Note: To increase the amount of DNA template, several replicates of the PCR can be performed and then mixed to carry out a single purification.\nNote: Since each gRNA-DNA template will be different, annealing temperature could be modified. Negative controls with universal or specific primers alone can be run to ensure that PCR bands are correct.\nAlternatives: Another DNA Polymerase could be used to generate the DNA -template, in that case, follow the protocol according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.\nRun PCR products (5\u00a0\u03bcL) plus 1\u00a0\u03bcL of Loading Dye (6\u00d7) in a 2% agarose gel, in TAE Buffer 1\u00d7.

In that case, follow the specific protocol provided in the kit.\nRfxCas13d in vitro transcription.\nNote: The following protocol is based on the mMESSAGE mMACHINE\u2122 T3 Transcription Kit (#ThermoFisher, Ambion, AM1348)\nMix the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_14.csv\nCritical: Setup the IVT reaction at room temperature while keeping the enzyme at \u221220\u00b0C in a benchtop cooler because the spermidine in the 10\u00d7 reaction buffer can precipitate if the buffer is chilled, which can cause the reaction to fail.Note: 6\u00a0\u03bcL of reaction should contain up to 1\u00a0\u03bcg of linear DNA template.\nIncubate the reaction for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C.\nAdd 1\u00a0\u03bcL TURBO DNase (2\u00a0U/\u03bcL).\nIncubate for 20\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C.\nPause point: Stop the reaction by freezing the tube in liquid nitrogen and store it at \u221280\u00b0C, or continue with the mRNA purification immediately, step 15.\nPurify the mRNA of RfxCas13d using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, # 74104). All the reagents required are provided in the kit.\nAdd 80\u00a0\u03bcL Nuclease free water to the IVT sample from step 14.\nAdd 350\u00a0\u03bcL Buffer RLT and mix well.\nAdd 250\u00a0\u03bcL 96%\u2013100% ethanol and mix by pipetting. Do not centrifugate. Proceed immediately to the next step.\nTransfer the sample to a RNeasy Mini Spin Column placed in a 2\u00a0mL collection tube (provided in the kit). Centrifuge for 15\u00a0s at 8000g. Discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 500\u00a0\u03bcL Buffer RPE to the column and centrifugate for 2\u00a0min at 8000g. Discard carefully the flowthrough.\nPlace the RNeasy Mini Spin Column in a new 2\u00a0mL collection tube and centrifugate at maximum speed to eliminate any possible carryover of buffer RPE.\nPlace the RNeasy Mini Spin Column in a new 1.5\u00a0mL collection tube and add 30\u00a0\u03bcL of Nuclease free water to the spin column membrane and centrifugate at 8000g to elute the RNA.\nAdd the elute from the previous step to the used column and centrifugate again for 1\u00a0min at 8000g to elute the RNA.\nQuantify the mRNA concentration using a spectrophotometer/fluorometer (nanodrop/Qubit). The mRNA concentration used to be between 500 and 1000\u00a0ng/\u03bcL.\nMake several aliquots of 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcL in nuclease-free 1.5\u00a0mL tubes and store at \u221280\u00b0C.Pause point: The mRNA aliquots of RfxCas13d could be kept at \u221280\u00b0C for several months but we recommend having several aliquots with 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcL each one to avoid possible RNA degradation by repeated freeze-thaw cycles. 3 freeze-thaw cycles should be the maximum allowed to ensure mRNA activity.\nAlternatives: RfxCas13d-HA mRNA version with NLS can be produced as described above (Plasmid #141320, http://www.addgene.org/141321/[href=http://www.addgene.org/141321/]). RfxCas13d-NLS can be useful to target mRNAs that are exclusively or preferentially localized in the nucleus such as some lncRNAs, pri-miRNAs, etc. Although we have not systematically tested this RfxCas13d version, we have observed that the targeting efficiency of Rfx-Cas13d-NLS may be lower in zebrafish embryos compared to RfxCas13d without NLS (Kushawah et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). However, this is not due to a lower in vivo translation (Kushawah et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or a lack of robust nuclear localization (data not shown) that could potentially reduce RNA targeting activity in the nucleus.\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] for potential solutions related to low RfxCas13d mRNA production.\nPreparation of RfxCas13d protein expressing bacterial colonies\nTiming: 3\u00a0days\nThe RfxCas13d protein could be purified using Histidine tag and directly injected in zebrafish embryos at 1-cell stage. It has been demonstrated that the use of RfxCas13d protein enhances the maternal mRNA targeting in zebrafish embryos (Kushawah et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nIn this step, the E.\u00a0coli Rosetta DE3 pRARE strain is chemically transformed (Chung et\u00a0al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Other transformation methods or E.\u00a0coli strains can be employed to afford RfxCas13d producing bacteria (i.e., we tested other E.\u00a0coli BL21 DE3 based strains with positive induction results). However, induction parameters (temperature, IPTG concentration, and incubation time) have been optimized for this strain and chemical transformation.\nPrepare the following items:Autoclaved 25\u00a0mL of liquid LB broth (Sambrook et\u00a0al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]); 2\u00a0\u00d7 50\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flasks; 2\u00a0\u00d7 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nPetri dish with LB-Agar-Chloramphenicol; 2\u00a0\u00d7 Petri dish with LB-Agar-Chloramphenicol-Kanamycin A.\nTSS 2\u00d7 buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for recipes).\nNote: Antibiotic final concentrations are: 15\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for Chloramphenicol; 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for Kanamycin A for both the agar plates and LB.\nStreak the E.\u00a0coli Rosetta DE3 pRARE on a LB petri dish with Chloramphenicol 15\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.\nIncubate the Petri dish at 37\u00b0C (16\u201318 h).\nPause point: After this period, the Petri dish with grown colonies can be stored at 4\u00b0C up to 3\u00a0weeks.\nPick up a single colony from the previous culture and inoculate 10\u00a0mL of liquid LB-Chloramphenicol in a 50\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nCap and incubate the flask at 37\u00b0C (16\u201318 h) while shaking at 180\u00a0rpm.\nNext morning, dilute 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the previous culture with 10\u00a0mL of liquid LB-Chloramphenicol into a new 50\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nCap and incubate the flask at 37\u00b0C while shacking up at 180\u00a0rpm until an OD600 of 0.3\u20130.4 is reached (2\u00a0h approx.)\nAt OD600\u00a0= 0.3\u20130.4, spin 2\u00d7 1\u00a0mL of the culture into microcentrifuge tubes (1\u00a0mL per tube) at 16000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0s at 4\u00b0C.\nRemove the supernatants and resuspend the pellets in 75\u00a0\u03bcL of cold LB. Keep the tubes on ice for 5\u00a0min.\nAdd 75\u00a0\u03bcL of cold TSS 2\u00d7 buffer to each tube and mix well with a pipette. Keep the tubes on ice for 5\u00a0min.\nAdd 0.2\u20131\u00a0\u03bcg of plasmid pET-28b-RfxCas13d-His (Kushawah et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) (Addgene #141322[href=https://www.addgene.org/141322/]) to one of the tubes and mix well with a pipette. The other tube is a negative control. Keep the tubes on ice for 30\u00a0min.Incubate the tubes at 42\u00b0C for 40\u00a0s in a thermo block. Keep both tubes on ice for 1\u00a0min.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL of LB to each tube and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h.\nCentrifuge at 16,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 1\u00a0min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant without touching the pellet and resuspend them in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of LB.\nSpread the transformed bacteria onto a selective LB-Agar-Chloramphenicol-Kanamycin A petri dish and incubate at 37\u00b0C (16\u201318 h).\nCritical: After this period, one plate should have colonies (the sample that included the plasmid) and the other one should have none (negative control without plasmid).\nPause point: The Petri dish with colonies can be stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 2\u00a0weeks. It is not recommended to store the transformed Rosetta strain in glycerol as it can accumulate mutations.\nCritical: Hazard Note: Dispose all E.\u00a0coli cultures following the biosafety protocols and indications that apply in your work institution.\nRfxCas13d protein expression\nTiming: 1.5\u00a0days\nIn this step, RfxCas13d protein production will be induced in cultures of previously transformed bacteria. Here we describe the protocol for a 500\u00a0mL culture but, if the appropriate equipment is available, it can be scaled up to bigger volumes (e.g.,: in our lab, we have handled up to 2\u00a0L of culture at once).\nPrepare the following items:\nAutoclaved: 520\u00a0mL of liquid LB broth; 2\u00a0\u00d7 50\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flasks; 2\u00a0L Erlenmeyer flask. Solutions:\nIsopropyl Beta -D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) solution 1M; Tris\u00b7HCl solution 20\u00a0mM pH 7.5 (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for recipes).\nA 10% poly-acrylamide gel.\nPick up a single colony from the plate of Rosetta cells previously transformed with pET28b-RfxCas13d and inoculate 10\u00a0mL of liquid LB-Chloramphenicol-Kanamycin A in a 50\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flask.Cap and incubate the flask at 37\u00b0C (16\u201318 h) while shaking at 180\u00a0rpm.\nNext morning, dilute 5\u00a0mL of the culture in 500\u00a0mL of liquid LB-Chloramphenicol-Kanamycin A in a 2\u00a0L Erlenmeyer flask.\nCap and incubate the flask at 37\u00b0C while shaking at 180\u00a0rpm.\nMeasure the culture OD600 periodically (at least every 30\u00a0min) using a spectrophotometer and LB as reference blank.\nAt OD600\u00a0= 0.45\u20130.55 (annotate the data. It takes approx. 3 h):\nTransfer 1\u00a0mL of the culture into a 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin at 16,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 1\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, completely remove the supernatant and store the pellet at \u221220\u00b0C (this will be the pre-induction reference).\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 1M IPTG to the Erlenmeyer flask containing the bacterial culture (final IPTG concentration\u00a0= 0.1\u00a0mM) and continue the incubation at 37\u00b0C while shaking at 180\u00a0rpm for 3 h.\nMeasure the culture OD600 at this point and annotate it. The OD600 should be between 1.5 and 2.15:\nTransfer 1\u00a0mL of the culture to a 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin the tube at 16,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 1\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, completely remove the supernatant and store the pellet at \u221220\u00b0C (this will be the post-induction reference).\nCentrifuge the 500\u00a0mL culture at 8,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20\u00a0mL of Tris\u00b7HCl 20\u00a0mM (pH 7.5).\nCentrifuge at 8,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nDiscard the supernatant and store the pellet at \u221280\u00b0C.\nCritical: Pre-induction and post-induction references (see previous steps 38a-b and 39a-b) must be run in an SDS-PAGE gel to confirm protein induction. A typical example is shown in Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8].Pause point: The cell pellet can be stored at \u221280\u00b0C for up to 6\u00a0months.

Spin the sample at 4,000\u00a0\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C until the volume reduces to about 1\u00a0mL.\nQuantify protein concentration as described in step 60 and stop concentrating when sample reaches \u223c3\u00a0mg/mL. Make 5\u00a0\u03bcL aliquots (\u223c200 1.5\u00a0mL tubes) and store them at \u221280\u00b0C. We recommend single use 5\u00a0\u03bcL aliquots. Additional thaw-frozen cycles can reduce RfxCas13d activity. We recommend to quickly store the aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C and not keep them at 4\u00b0C more than the needed time to make the aliquots. Storage at 4\u00b0C or \u221220\u00b0C will negatively affect RfxCas13d activity.\nOptional: Although it is not strictly necessary, for the sake of quality control and reproducibility, we strongly recommend the quantification of the sample.\nQuantify the amount of purified RfxCas13d by Bradford densitometry on SDS-PAGE gel employing BSA as reference. RfxCas13d samples must be diluted in a dialysis buffer in a 1 to 20 ratio, loading 2\u20136\u00a0\u03bcL of the diluted sample in the gel.

The calibration curve and final quantification were performed with the Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).\nCritical: If RfxCas13d must be diluted for any reason, always dilute it using a dialysis buffer. RfxCas13d precipitates if diluted with water.\nAlternatives: Other quantification methods (e.g.: Lowry or BCA based, UV absorption) can be employed instead of the Bradford densitometry. Particularly, we have also quantified RfxCas13d with the RC-DC Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad, #5000122).\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for potential solutions to low RfxCas13d protein production.\nMicroinjection of CRISPR-RfxCas13d system in zebrafish embryos\nTiming: 2\u00a0days\nDay 1. Zebrafish Breeding. Separate adult zebrafish of at least 3\u20134\u00a0months old (male/female) in 1\u00a0L breeding tanks, using a separating barrier, in the afternoon. We recommend separating 5 males and 5 females in group mating, in a ratio of 1:1.\nNote: Females differ from males by having a bigger belly size, lighter silverish stripes and by the presence of a membrane in the anal fin .\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] for possible solutions to low zebrafish embryo production.Prepare several agarose plates at 1% of agarose in E3 medium for the maintenance of zebrafish embryos. Plates for microinjection are prepared by adding 2% agarose to E3 medium and placing a plastic mold (teeth down) to make the different lines where the embryos will be placed, while the agarose is still hot (before solidifying). Store the plates upside down at 4\u00b0C 1\u00a0week as maximum. To avoid potential medium contamination, we recommend not to reuse the plates.\nDay 2. Needle calibration. In the morning, thaw the RfxCas13d mRNA/protein (300\u00a0ng/\u03bcL and 3\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL, respectively) and gRNAs on ice. Pipette 2\u00a0\u03bcL of the RfxCas13d mRNA/protein and load into the needle (Harvard, apparatus, 1.0 OD \u00d7 0.58 ID \u00d7 100\u00a0L mm #30-0019 Capillaries GC100F-10) and calibrate the needle using a micrometer calibration slide microscope with 0.01\u00a0mm ruler. Using a microinjector (Narishige IM-300) and a stereomicroscope (Leica KL300) and with the help of forceps open the needle end to an adequate size opening. Calibrate the system in order to obtain a bubble of 0.01mm that corresponds to an injection volume of 0.5 nL.\nNote: RfxCas13d mRNA could be diluted in Nuclease-free water meanwhile the RfxCas13d protein must be diluted using the dialysis buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for recipes).\nNote: Needles need to be prepared from glass capillaries with the Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (or similar horizontal pullers) and the following conditions: Pull (150), Vel (70), Time (80), Heat (590). Heat temperature is calculated with the Run-Test function that results in the RAMP value, Heat\u00a0= RAMP value\u00a0+ 30. These conditions may change between different Micropipette Pullers and should be adjusted to the specific model.\nNote: Microinjector pressure should be between 2.0 and 10.0 psi. We recommend a pressure of 6.0\u20137.0 psi depending on the needle pore size.Note: RfxCas13d protein calibration could be more complicated due to glycerol content that can clog the needle. We recommend widened needle pore size and inject with a lower pressure (3.0\u20135.0 psi). If the needle is clogged during the injection, we suggest opening more of the needle and recalibrating it again.\nWhen the zebrafish facility lights turn on in the morning, remove the separating barriers between males and females from the breeding tank. Wait until eggs are laid and collect them from the tank using a strainer. This typically takes about 5\u201310\u00a0min but it can vary.\nDechorionate the embryos using pronase at 1\u00a0mg/mL in E3. Incubate the embryos in 3\u00a0mL of pronase solution for approximately 2\u00a0min.\nNote: Touch a few embryos with the forceps to assure whether the pronase solution is causing a proper dechorionation, if the solution has worked optimality the corium will be removed when is touched with the forceps. We highly recommend to dechorionate the embryos. This will facilitate that the RfxCas13d mRNA/protein and gRNAs are injected into the cell and not in the yolk, which enhances the mRNA targeting. Alternatively, chorionated embryos can be injected but it is important to inject always into the cell.\nCarefully wash the embryos several times (5\u20137 washes approximately) with new E3 medium in a 250\u00a0mL glass beaker and carefully remove the dechorionated embryos with a glass pipette. Repeat this step until most of the embryos are dechorionated.\nCritical: Dechorionated embryos must always be handled with glass material or with agarose gel as alternative.\nPlace 60\u201370 embryos in each row of the microinjection plate (prepared the day before) with a glass pipette and add a thin overlay of E3 medium to the plate.Note: You can flame the glass pipette tip just enough to polish it and create a smooth surface that improves embryo survival during manipulations.\nInject each one-cell stage embryo with 1 nL of mix of RfxCas13d purified protein (3.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L) or mRNA (200\u2013300\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) and 300\u2013900\u00a0ng/\u03bcL (individual or mix gRNA final concentration) of gRNA (optimal conditions tested) using the microinjector stereomicroscope. This provides 3\u00a0ng of protein or 200\u2013300 pg of mRNA and 300\u2013900 pg of gRNAs per embryo. RfxCas13d protein or mRNA can be mixed in one tube with gRNAs at concentrations described above or to maximize the reagents concentrations two injections can also be performed, 1 nL for RfxCas13d (protein or mRNA) and 1 nL for gRNAs. This can be done when it is not possible to have the optimized concentrations described before in one solution. We have not observed differences between two approaches\nTransfer the embryos to 1% agarose coated plates with E3-medium and keep them at 28\u00b0C.\nNote: To enhance the mRNA targeting with the RfxCas13d system we strongly recommend injecting directly 1 nL in the cell of one-cell-stage embryos and we suggest to inject at least 60\u201370 embryos for each condition.\nCritical: The first cell division takes place 40\u00a0min after fertilization in zebrafish embryos but if the embryos are in two-cell-stage it is possible to inject 0.5 nL in each cell. We do not recommend injecting the embryos after the two-cell-stage (1 hpf) because the targeting efficiency can be affected.Note: Inject 60\u201370 embryos with RfxCas13d protein or mRNA without gRNA as a control for\u00a0the early development. These embryos must have a normal development such as a non-injected embryo. gRNAs alone can be also injected as a second control. An additional control could be to inject RfxCas13d mRNA or protein plus a gRNA targeting a sequence that is absent from the Zebrafish Genome.\nNote: As a positive control injecting 3\u00a0ng of RfxCas13d purified protein or 200 pg RfxCas13d mRNA and 300 pg of in vitro transcribed gNTL-ctr (tbxta-4, stem loop disrupted and spacer of 23 nt version, Protospacer: 5\u2032CUUUGCUGAAAGAUACGGGUGCT) per embryo. This will generate 80%\u201390% of zebrafish embryos with extreme no-tail phenotype.\nEmbryos care\nTiming: 24 h\nKeep the injected embryos in an incubator at 28\u00b0C in 1% agarose plates with E3 medium.\nRemove the unfertilized egg and dead embryos from the plate at 2 hpf.\nRepeat step 71 at 4 and 6 hpf. If the experiment goes beyond the first 7\u20138 hpf we recommend to transfer all viable embryos to a new 1% agarose plate with E3 fresh medium prewarm at 28\u00b0C\nNote: During these cleaning steps E3 medium will be also removed from the plate. Thus, fresh E3 medium prewarm at 28\u00b0C can be added to the plate if needed\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] for possible solutions to percentage of zebrafish embryo survival.\nmRNA knockdown validation\nTiming: 1\u20134\u00a0weeks (qPCR, independent gRNA or mRNA injections) or 1\u20133\u00a0months (RNA-seq)\nDifferent alternatives and complementary methods are proposed here to validate the efficiency of the mRNA knockdown.\nEmploy a mix of different gRNAs targeting the same mRNA to validate the possible phenotype, decrease in mRNA levels and off-target effects obtained with the RfxCas13d system.Alternatives: Perform mRNA knockdown experiments using new gRNAs or individual gRNAs from the mix injected independently. The use of new gRNAs could confirm the developmental and molecular phenotype in an independent experiment. As an alternative, gRNAs from the mix could be injected independently to confirm the mRNA knockdown and the phenotype but also to analyze what gRNA has the highest efficiency. This single and highly efficient gRNA can be used for future experiments instead of the mix. This can help to reduce potential off-targets from the mix where more gRNAs are used\nAnalyze the mRNA relative levels or your target gene by qPCR analysis or ideally by RNA-seq analysis that will show the whole transcriptome.\nInject a mRNA version resistant to gRNA (with mutations not altering the amino acid sequence) to rescue the phenotype. A titration will be required to ensure that overexpression does not cause any developmental defect. We recommend injecting different concentrations (from 10 to 200 pg per embryo, for example) of resistant mRNA to evaluate overexpression effects and phenotype rescue.\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] for possible solutions to low or no mRNA depletion.", "Acclimatization of fish for spawningPrepare 10-15 tanks with one pair of male and female adult fish, and acclimate each fish to a new environment for a week. Note: Fish are kept under a 14/10-h light/dark cycle at 26 \u00b0C to promote spawning. Preparation of an egg holderPrepare a commonly used slide glass (Figure 1A). Adhere glass chips on the slide glass to make a channel for setting a silicone sealant (Figure 1B).Fill the channel (enclosed by the red line in Figure 1C) of the egg holder plate with the silicone sealant, and flatten its surface with a spatula.Note: It will take overnight to completely solidify the sealant.Cut out the hardened sealant in parallel with a cutter, and make a channel (enclosed by the blue line in Figure 1D) of about 1.0 mm in width and about 2.0 mm in depth for fitting eggs.Note: Unlike an agarose plate, the silicone plate can be used permanently.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131022415_9958.jpgFigure 1.

The preparation of fertilized eggs for microinjection (Steps 3a-3b, 4a-4b) Load the solution of DNA/RNA or protein in the glass capillary needle using the micro-loading tip.Fill the glass capillary needle with mineral oils completely to the end using a disposable syringe fitted with the Hamilton needle.Apply pressure to the injector by turning the handle of the injector, and fill completely a line of tubing between injector and injection needle holder with mineral oils, to remove air in the line.Note: This work helps to prevent the end of the microinjection needle from clogging with air bubbles.Fix the glass capillary needle in the needle holder for injection, and attach the holder to the micromanipulator (Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. The loading of the solution in the glass capillary needle, and the attachment of the needle to the micro-manipulator (Steps 4c-4f) Transfer the egg to the egg holder with a glass pipette, and place it on the stereoscopic microscope stage.Rotate the eggs with forceps to direct its cytoplasm toward the injection needle and fix the egg in the channel of the egg holder on the stereoscopic microscope stage (magnification 20x).Note: Although it may be difficult to find the cytoplasm just after fertilization, it can become easy to find it gradually, because it progressively accumulates toward the animal pole in the egg; it is easy to find the cytoplasm by observing the opposite side of the droplets that accumulate toward the vegetal pole. Place the holder on the upright microscope stage and place the cytoplasm at the center of the view by adjusting the stage of microscope (magnification 40x).Note: If the cytoplasm is not properly oriented toward the injection needle, it is necessary to adjust its position again under the stereoscopic microscope. Open the end of the needle by touching the end gently to the surface of the egg holder under the microscope.Bring the needle close to the cytoplasm by operating the manipulator.Just before to touch the egg envelope surface, apply pressure to the injector by turning the handle of the injector, and then penetrate the end of the glass needle into the cytoplasm through the egg envelope and cell membrane.Note: When the end is inserted into the cytoplasm, the injected solution automatically starts to flow into cytoplasm. If the solution doesn\u2019t flow into the cytoplasm, apply additional pressure to the injector. Wait a second until outflow of the solution reaches the appropriate volume, and quickly withdraw the needle (Video 3).Note: The injection of the solution into the eggs should be stopped when the cytoplasm are expanded slightly, because over dose of the solution, especially DNA, may result in death or developmental disturbance of the eggs. The volume of the solution is not constant because the microinjection system cannot accurately control the injected volume. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3.

On the other hand, to establish a knock-in strain harboring the inserted gene, it is necessary to inject the solution into at least 100 eggs because of low efficiency in knock-in performance. It is recommended to inject the one- or two-cell stage eggs to prevent from reducing the efficiency of the injection (Video 4).Incubate the injected eggs in embryo culture medium at around 28 \u00b0C.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4.The reference movie of the microinjection into the two-cell stage eggs. Unlike the egg holder with a silicone channel described in this protocol, the egg is fitted a channel between glass plates in this movie. The first injection is performed with the one-cell stage egg, while the second injection is performed with the two-cell stage egg. It is recommended that the solution be injected into the one-cell stage eggs, because the two-cell stage eggs are required to be injected into each cytoplasm as shown in the second injection in this video. It should be noted that the microinjection into the eggs later than two-cell stage strongly reduces the efficiency of the injection, and leads to a high degree of mosaicism in the eggs. The injected solution gives a red color with a phenol red, so that can be visible in the egg in this movie, however, it is unnecessary for the practical experiment.", "The use of the animals described in the sections below has been approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal and Human Research of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona and by the Departament d'Agricultura, Ramaderia, Pesca i Alimentaci\u00f3 of the Generalitat de Catalunya (protocol #8741).\n1. Feeder Cell Inactivation and Storage\nNOTE: Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-1) were previously frozen in 1 mL of freezing solution consisting of 90% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored in liquid nitrogen until use.\nThaw a cryogenic vial of HFF-1 (1 mL) by immersing the vial in a 37 \u00b0C water bath.\nAdd the thawed contents of the cryogenic vial to pre-warmed Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS to make a 1:10 dilution.\nSeed the diluted cells (10 mL) in a T75 flask and culture them at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nThe next day, change the medium to eliminate the DMSO remnants. Remove the medium and add 10 mL of pre-warmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nCulture the HFFs and change the medium every 48 h until the culture reaches the confluent stage. This may take approximately 7 to 10 days.\nTo prepare the inactivation solution, dilute mitomycin C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at a final concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL. Incubate the cells with the inactivation solution for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the inactivation solution and rinse the cells thrice with 2 mL of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) to eliminate mitomycin C remnants.\nTo detach the inactivated cells, add 1 mL of pre-warmed Trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.Observe the cells under an inverted microscope to ensure they are detached (10x objective with 0.3 numerical aperture or NA). If they are not, incubate them for a couple more minutes at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Check the cells again under the inverted microscope.\nPipette the solution with a Pasteur pipette in order to dissociate the cell clumps.\nNeutralize the enzymatic solution by adding 4 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and resuspend.\nTake an aliquot of the cell suspension and make a 1:100 dilution in HBSS. To determine the number of cells, load 10 \u00b5L of the dilution into a Neubauer's chamber. Count the cells located in one of the big squares of the chamber under an inverted microscope (20x objective with a 0.45 NA).\nRepeat the counting in a total of four big squares. Calculate the total number of cells (N) as N = average number of cells counted x total volume x dilution x 104.\nCentrifuge the rest of the sample for 5 min at 200 x g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with freezing solution at a concentration of 106 cells per mL.\nAliquot the suspension in cryogenic vials with 106 cells (1 mL) each. Place the cryogenic vials in a freezing container and freeze at -80 \u00b0C.\nThe next day, store the cryogenic vials in liquid nitrogen.\n2. Feeder Cell Culture\nOne to four days before starting the derivation process, thaw a cryogenic vial containing 1 x 106 inactivated HFF-1 cells in a water bath at 37 \u00b0C.\nMake a 1:6 dilution of the thawed HFF-1 in pre-warmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and keep the temperature at 37 \u00b0C.Fill every well of a 4-well plate with 500 \u00b5L of pre-warmed 0.2% gelatin from porcine skin and keep the plate at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min.\nRemove the 500 \u00b5L of gelatin from the wells and add 500 \u00b5L of the HFFs dilution. Gently rock the plate to ensure a uniform distribution of the HFFs on the bottom of the wells. Avoid circular movements, otherwise the cells will concentrate at the center of the well.\nIncubate the plate at least 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 to obtain a monolayer of inactivated HFFs in each well.\nThe next day, observe the cells under an inverted microscope (10X objective with 0.3 NA) and check that they are attached and homogeneously distributed. Change the medium to eliminate the DMSO remnants. Remove the medium and add 500 \u00b5L of pre-warmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\n3. Embryo Collection and Culture\nFour days before embryo collection, administer 5 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin by intraperitoneal injection to 6-12 week old female mice.\n\tNOTE: We have used females from the 129S2 or B6CFAF1 strains, though females from other mouse strains can be used. Nevertheless, when working with females from non-permissive strains (e.g. CBA), medium should be supplemented with 2i as mentioned in step 4.2.\nAfter 48 h, administer 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin by intraperitoneal injection, and mate the females with males, at least 8 weeks old, at a 1:1 ratio. Separate the females from the males the next day.The day before embryo collection, prepare a 35-mm cell culture Petri dish with several 40 \u00b5L drops of KSOMaag medium supplemented with 4 mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and fill the plate with mineral oil to fully cover the drops. Incubate the dish at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 to equilibrate the medium.\nTo prepare embryo manipulation pipettes, heat the thinner part of a long-tipped glass Pasteur pipette using a Bunsen burner. Once soft, withdraw it from the flame and pull the two ends apart. Break it to the desired length. The inner diameter at the tip should be 100-150 \u00b5m.\nEuthanize the female mice by cervical dislocation 45-48 h post-coitum (p.c.).\nDissect the mice to expose the abdominal cavity by cutting the skin with curved smooth sharp scissors and the peritoneum with straight sharp scissors. Grab one uterus with forceps, cut off the oviduct using straight sharp scissors, and place it in Hepes-buffered CZB medium (HCZB)13 at 37 \u00b0C. Repeat the process to remove the other oviduct.\nFlush the oviducts with a 1 mL syringe loaded with HCZB held in place by watchmaker forceps to collect the 2-cell embryos.\n\tNOTE: To prepare the flushing needle take a 30 G hypodermic needle, cut the end, and ground to a blunt tip on an abrasive stone.\nUsing the mouth pipette apparatus, pick up the embryos, wash them in HCZB and culture them in the previously prepared embryo culture dish at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 until the blastocyst stage. Up to 50 embryos can be cultured in each 40 \u00b5L drop. Monitor embryo development every 24 h under a stereomicroscope.NOTE: Alternatively, embryos can be collected at the blastocyst stage to shorten in vitro embryo culture. In this case, euthanize the females at day 3.5 - 4.5 p.c., dissect the uterus. and flush it with HCZB.\n4. Stem Cell Derivation\nPreparation of the derivation plates\nOn the day of embryo seeding, prepare the derivation medium by supplementing DMEM medium with 100 \u00b5M 2-\u03b2 mercaptoethanol, 1x Non-Essential Amino Acids, 20% of serum replacement, and 103 U/mL LIF.\nIf desired, also add 1 \u00b5M of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 and 3 \u00b5M of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 to obtain a 2i medium.\nTake the 4-well plate with the monolayer of inactivated HFFs (step 2.6) from the incubator. Remove the medium and add 800 \u00b5L of pre-warmed derivation medium to each well. Return the plate to the incubator.\nZona pellucida removal and embryo seeding\nPrepare a 35 mm cell culture Petri dish with three 30 \u00b5L drops of acidic Tyrode's solution14 and three 30 \u00b5L drops of derivation medium. Cover the drops with mineral oil and keep the dish at 37 \u00b0C.\nTake the embryo culture dish from the incubator. One by one, transfer the blastocysts from the culture drops to an acidic Tyrode's solution drop using an embryo manipulation pipette. If possible, select only the expanded blastocysts to start the derivation process.\nMonitor the zona pellucida digestion under the stereomicroscope. As soon as the zona pellucida disappears, transfer the blastocyst to a derivation medium drop in order to wash out the acidic Tyrode's solution.\nTake the 4-well derivation plate from the incubator and seed one zona-free blastocyst on the feeder cells in each well.\nReturn the 4-well derivation plate to the incubator and culture at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nMonitoring stem cell growth and medium changeMonitor the cultures every 24 h under an inverted microscope (20X objective with 0.45 NA). It is important to note whether there are signs of stem cell differentiation, such as swollen refractive cells surrounding the outgrowth or even pushing the feeder cells aside.\nEvery other day, change the medium of the culture. Take the 4-well plate from the incubator, remove the medium from each well, and add 800 \u00b5L of pre-warmed derivation medium supplemented with LIF and 2i, if used. Maintain the culture until outgrowths are observed (6-8 days).\n5. Stem Cell Culture and Maintenance\nPrepare Kolle-like handles and stem cell manipulation pipettes. Follow step 3.4 to prepare stem cell manipulation pipettes with an inner diameter at the tip of 250-300 \u00b5m. Use the other part of the pulled Pasteur pipette to prepare the Kolle-like handle. Heat and shape it until obtaining a hook.\nTake the 4-well culture plate out of the incubator and locate the outgrowth under a stereomicroscope. Use the handle to push away the differentiated cells and the feeders that surround the outgrowth.\n\tNOTE: To avoid eventual differentiation of the outgrowth, it is important to remove all the differentiated cells from the edge of the outgrowth.\nAspirate the outgrowth with a stem cell manipulation pipette and place it in a new dish in a 50 \u00b5L trypsin-EDTA drop.\nUse a scalpel to cut the outgrowth in several parts in order to disaggregate it both mechanically and enzymatically.\nStraight away, transfer the outgrowth fragments into a fresh drop of derivation medium to neutralize trypsin action.\nTransfer the outgrowth fragments to a new 4-well plate with a monolayer of feeders. Transfer up to 10 fragments per well and culture them with derivation medium at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.Maintain the stem cell-like cultures for at least six weeks before considering the mESC line established. Change the medium every other day and subculture them once a week.\nSubscription Required.

A completed slide Time-lapse recording of PLM touch neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans embryosSet up microscope parameters. For differential interference contrast (DIC) images, the exposure time to white light is usually 0.2 s with a 10% neutral density filter. The neutral density filter partially blocks the light, and the percentage of the filter represents how much light travels through. For recording the signal of the Ca2+ reporter GCaMP5G, the exposure time for the GFP channel is 0.1 s with a 5% neutral density filter. For recording the signal of the PS reporter MFG-E8::mCherry, the exposure time for the mCherry channel is also 0.1 s with a 5% neutral density filter.Align the DIC light path carefully for optimal DIC effect according to the manufacturer's instruction[href=https://pdf.medicalexpo.com/pdf/ge-healthcare-life-sciences/deltavision-elite-cell-imaging-system/80554-135081.html].Under the 63\u00d7 or 100\u00d7 objectives, find embryos and mark the positions by using the \u201cpoint marking\u201d and \u201cposition visiting\u201d functions of the software. It is recommended not to mark too many embryos at the same time (see Note 2). Carefully choose the embryos that are younger than the 2-fold stage (460 min post the 1st embryonic cell division).Set up the positions for the serial z-section recording. The serial z-section recording is performed from the ventral surfaces and proceeding inwards. The setting of 10-15 z-sections at 0.5 \u03bcm/section is sufficient to cover the necessary region.Set up the time-lapse recording parameters. We found no striking Ca2+ or PS signal prior to the 560 min post-1st embryonic cell division. The starting point of time-lapse recording is set at 560 min-post the 1st embryonic cell division, which is 100 min after an embryo reaches the 2-fold stage (Figure 6). Recording of the Caenorhabditis elegans tail, where the touch neurons PLML and PLMR reside, in the strain ZH3052, is set in the 2.5-min interval for the first 2 h of recording and in the 5-min interval for the next 4 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4187/bioprotoc-11-20-4187-g006.jpgFigure 6.

Relevant dimensions are indicated.\nFigure\u00a0created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nPreparing quartz slides\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes steps used to clean slides that will be used for single-molecule fluorescence experiments.\nBoil recycled slides: If recycling slides from previous experiments, boil the quartz slides for 15\u00a0min to remove debris from previous experiments. If working with new slides, skip to the next step.\nNote: From our experience, slides can be used at least 4\u20135 times before needing to replace them.\nSonicate the slides: Place the slides in a slide holder (e.g., prepared in house from Teflon or glass coplin staining jars, Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B). Insert the slides and holder into new beaker, add 20% detergent solution (Contrad 70) and sonicate for 20\u00a0min. Discard the detergent solution, rinse with Milli-Q water 3 times, and sonicate for 40\u00a0min in Milli-Q water.\nThoroughly clean the slides: Boil slides in a beaker containing Piranha Solution for 15\u00a0min, making sure slides are fully immersed in the solution. Discard the solution to a labeled segregated container after use for proper disposal.\nNote: Ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide are irritants. Use all recommended safety precautions, including appropriate personal protective equipment and working in a fume hood.Rinse and dry the slides: Thoroughly rinse the slides with Milli-Q water to remove any remaining piranha solution. Collect the washes and discard into a labeled segregated container. Dry the slides by carefully applying above a Bunsen burner. Cool the slides in a slide staining rack and place them into the slide holder until needed.\nSurface activation of slides and coverslips\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes steps used to chemically treat the cleaned quartz slides and coverslips to prepare them for subsequent SMF experiments.\nActivate the slides and coverslips: Immerse quartz slides and 50\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024\u00a0mm glass coverslips in 1\u00a0M potassium hydroxide solution and sonicate for 20\u00a0min.\nNote: potassium hydroxide is a strong base and caustic. Take precautions including wearing appropriate personal protective equipment while handling it.\nRinse the slides: Discard the potassium hydroxide solution. Rinse slides well with ddH2O, discard, and then sonicate with fresh ddH2O for 40\u00a0min.\nRinse and dry slides: Discard the water and fill jars with methanol. Sonicate for 40\u00a0min. Discard the methanol and rinse the slides at least 3 times with ddH2O. Dry the slides and coverslips by flushing with nitrogen gas.\nSlide surface aminosilanization\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nThis section describes the process to silanize the quartz slides, which reduces the adherence of proteins directly to the slide.\nApply Aminosilanization Solution: Carefully prepare 300\u00a0mL Aminosilanization Solution (2%\u20133% APTES) in a clean and dry beaker. Add the solution into a beaker containing the slide holder containing slides and coverslips and incubate at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. Sonicate the slides and coverslips with the solution for 2\u00a0min and incubate again for 10\u00a0min.\nNote: 3-APTES is highly toxic and carcinogenic. Do this step in a fume hood and use appropriate personal protective equipment.Rinse and dry the slides: Discard the Aminosilanization Solution into a proper labeled segregated container. Rinse the slides thoroughly with 100% methanol and discard. Then rinse the slides thoroughly with ddH2O and discard. Rinse the slides one final time with methanol and discard.\nDry the slides: Thoroughly dry the slides by applying a stream of nitrogen gas.\nSlide surface PEGylation\nTiming: 30\u00a0min preparation\u00a0+ 10\u201312\u00a0h incubation, approximately 12\u201313\u00a0h in total\nThis section details steps for PEGylating the quarts slides.\nPrepare solution: Prepare fresh 100\u00a0mM sodium bicarbonate solution and filter with a Millex-GP 0.22-micron filter.\nPrepare PEG solution: Dissolve 80\u00a0mg of mPEG-SVA and 5\u00a0mg of Biotin-PEG-SVA by gently adding 400\u00a0\u03bcL sodium bicarbonate buffer and vortexing until the mixture becomes transparent. Centrifuge the solution for one minute at 10,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g to remove bubbles. This amount will be enough to PEGylate 5 slides.\nApply PEG solution on the slides: Add 90\u00a0\u03bcL of PEG solution to each quartz slide. Gently apply a coverslip on the top of the PEG solution on the slide, avoiding the formation of bubbles on the slide.\nIncubate slides in the dark 12\u201314 h.\nNote: To prevent desiccation-induced adhesion of the quartz slides to the coverslips, the slides need to be incubated in a closed container that maintains a humid environment. We use empty clean pipet tip boxes with water at the bottom.\nCleaning and storage\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes steps for preparing the quartz slides for storing until they are used for SMF experiments.\nOutline the PEG surface with a marker. Then carefully separate the coverslips from slides.Rinse and store slides: Rinse both slides and coverslips thoroughly with ddH2O, dry them with nitrogen and store in a 50\u00a0mL centrifuge tube with flushed nitrogen. Seal the tube with parafilm and stored at \u221220\u00b0C.\nNote: Keep the nitrogen gas pressure lower than 10 pounds per square inch (PSI) while drying the PEG surface.\nNote: The slides should be stable for 3\u20134\u00a0weeks.

The imaging buffer should contain a saturating concentration of ligand, or no ligand for the apo sample.\nAdd the A2AAR-nanodisc complex into the chamber, approximately 120\u00a0\u03bcL at a concentration of 50 pM. Incubate for 5\u201310\u00a0min to immobilize nanodisc sample contains 5% biotin-PE on the streptavidin coated quartz slide surface. Rinse the chamber with 120\u00a0\u03bcL Imaging Buffer to remove uncombined sample.\nAdd reagents to increase dye stability: Apply an additional 120\u00a0\u03bcL imaging buffer containing glucose oxidase and a catalase oxygen scavenging system (OSS) to the chamber to increase the dye\u2019s photostability. The buffer should also contain either a saturating concentration of the same ligand used in step 38 or no ligand. The glucose oxidase and a catalase oxygen scavenging system contains 10% w/v glucose, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL glucose oxidase and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL bovine catalase prepared by adding the reagents to the imaging buffer.\nSingle-molecule data acquisition\nTiming: 40\u00a0min\nThis section outlines the steps for handling the sample and recording SMF single color data.\nMount the sample: Place the sample slide on the TIRF stage based attached to inverted IX73 microscope equipped with 60\u00d7, 1.20 NA water-immersion objective (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nExcite the sample: Use 532\u00a0nM laser to excite the sample via a prism attached to the surface of a slide (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).\nRecord data: Record emission from Cy3-labeled A2AAR nanodisc complexes on an EMCCD camera with 100 milliseconds integration time. We typically record movies for 100\u00a0s to ensure that most molecules are eventually photobleached (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C), which confirms that the observed particle is a single molecule.\nFor each sample slide, record at least 15\u201320 movies.Process the data and extract intensity time traces: We use the smFRET package and program \u201cSingle\u201d, made available from the lab of Prof. Taekjip Ha, for data acquisition and processing. A link to the software is provided below. Additional instructions for using the software are provided in the download.\nSingle-molecule data analysis\nTiming: a week to few weeks depending on the complexity and quality of the experimental data\nThis section describes the process for quantitatively analyzing the SMF data and generating corresponding histograms and transition density plots used to visualize the data (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1821-Fig10.jpg\nFigure\u00a010. Single-molecule fluorescence data processing workflow\n(A) A representative single-molecule fluorescence trajectory of a dynamic apo A2AAR-Cy3 molecule in lipid nanodiscs. Fluorescence intensities fluctuate predominantly between two normalized intensity states of 1 and \u223c2.

The histograms are fit with an exponential function to generate the red curve. Igor Pro was used to generate and fit the dwell-time histogram.Select dynamic molecules: Molecules that exhibit single-step photobleaching are selected using the smFRET data analysis package (link below) modified to analyze single-color data written using MATLAB (provided by the laboratory of Taekjip Ha, also see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Correct the background of each trajectory by the intensity after photobleaching and normalize the fluorescence intensities to the mean intensity of the lowest intensity state. Truncate individual dynamic trajectories before photobleaching. For each condition (ligand or no ligand added), we typically select approximate 200 molecules (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A).\nCreate histograms: Generate binned intensity histograms and fit the histograms into Gaussian distributions. We use Igor Pro to generate and fit histograms with Gaussian distributions (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B).\nCalculate error: record data from at least five to seven independent movies to calculate the error bars on the fluorescence intensity histograms.\nFit the data: Use Hidden Markov model to fit individual normalized trajectories into different conformational states and determine the dwell times spent in each state (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C). The analysis closely follows published protocols from the Ha lab (McKinney et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nGenerate the transition density plots (TDP) to reveal the probabilities of transition events (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]D).\nConstruct the dwell times histograms and fit with exponential decay function to determine rate constants of transitions (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]E).

Collect 5-10 colonies and inoculate 20 ml of autoclaved LB medium (supplemented with 25 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin) in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer culture flask. Incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C while shaking at 200 rpm.Use 10 ml of culture from Step 2 to inoculate 1 L of fresh LB medium containing 25 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin and grow in a 2 L Erlenmeyer culture flask at 37 \u00b0C until OD600 = 0.6-1.0.Cool the resulting culture to 20 \u00b0C and add IPTG to yield a final concentration of 0.1 mM.After 16-20 h of induction with IPTG at 20 \u00b0C and stirring at 220 rpm, collect the cells by centrifuging the culture at 5,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min.Suspend harvested cells in 30 ml of solution A and freeze at -30 \u00b0C until use.Thaw frozen cells and disrupt by French press or sonication. When using probe sonication, apply 6 \u00d7 20 s pulses while keeping the sample (30 ml) in an ice bath to prevent heat damage.Transfer the lysate to a centrifuge bottle and centrifuge at 25,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C before loading the resultant supernatant onto a 3 ml column of cOmplete His-Tag Purification Resin pre-equilibrated with Solution A.Wash the resin with more than 10 resin-bed volumes using Solution B and then elute the protein with 10 ml of Solution C.Add Ulp1 protease to remove the N-terminal 6xHis-SUMO tag.Note: An advantage of the Ulp1 protease compared to other sequence-based proteases is the ability of Ulp1 to recognize SUMO tertiary structure and cleave at the C-terminal end of the conserved Gly-Gly sequence in SUMO. This ability eliminates unspecific cleavage associated with other proteases that target a linear protein sequence. SUMO cleavage by Ulp1 does leave two extra amino acids (Gly-Ser) at the N-terminal end of the C2-domain.

At different time points (such as 2, 4, 8 weeks after treatments) of the experiment, one or two mice from each group will be euthanized to examine inflammation and other interesting analysis. Based on our experiments, the FACS analysis detected around 90% of macrophage reduction in the group that treated with the clodronate-loaded liposomes versus the control group after 2 weeks treatment, and this reduction kept to the end of the experiments.   During the whole treatment period, the treated mice need to be closely monitored for the possible signs and symptoms such as weight loss, yellow, bloody, or tar-colored stool, dark urine color, diarrhea, fatigue etc.    At the end of the experiment, (depend on the experiment), the mice were euthanized and the lung tissues were collected for various analyses.", "Radioactive pulse-chasePlate 5 x 105 HeLa CCL-2 cells/well (6-well plate) in 2 ml of complete DMEM and incubate for 24 h/37 \u00b0C/5% CO2 (Figure 1).

This step removes the aqueous slurry containing 0.02% sodium azide supplied with the beads, which might interfere with the antibody binding. Make sure to leave the initial volume of beads/slurry in the tube (~30 \u03bcl per chase-time/condition point).For large amounts of beads (more than 500 \u03bcl), a 15 ml conical polystyrene centrifuge tube may be used and washes are done with at least 1:3 volume of beads-slurry/PBS.It is important to start with around 10-20% extra volume of beads to compensate for loss during the wash and pipetting.After washing, resuspend 30 \u03bcl of beads (in 50% PBS slurry) in 500 \u03bcl of ice-cold PBS containing 5 \u03bcl of 10% (v/v) BSA and 2 \u03bcl Cathepsin D antibody. Mix the suspension thoroughly. When working with multiple samples, it is recommended to prepare a beads/antibody \u2018master mix\u2019. This is done by increasing the quantities indicated above proportionally to the number of samples, and incubating the suspension in a 15 ml conical polystyrene centrifuge tube.Incubate for 2-3 h/4 \u00b0C under slow rotation on a tube rotator (capable of end-over-end inversion). During this step, the antibody will bind to the beads.Pellet the beads by centrifugation for 1 min at 3,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C and remove the supernatant. Wash the beads 3 times with 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer by repeating step B4. After the final washing step, centrifuge the tubes containing the beads and remove the supernatant making sure to leave the initial volume of beads/slurry in the tube (~30 \u03bcl per chase-time/condition point). For each immunoprecipitation sample, incubate in a microcentrifuge tube: 30 \u03bcl beads/antibody (50% PBS slurry), 750 \u00b5l of cleared Cell lysate or Media, sample, 10 \u03bcl 10% BSA and 200 \u03bcl lysis buffer (supplemented with 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail).Incubate for 2-3 h/4 \u00b0C under slow rotation on a tube rotator.After the incubation step, centrifuge the tubes, remove the supernatant and wash the beads 3 times each with 1 ml wash buffer (see Recipes) and one final wash step with 1 ml 1x PBS. Remove all PBS from the microcentrifuge tubes and resuspend the beads in 20 \u00b5l of 2x sample buffer (see Recipes). At this point, samples can be stored at -80 \u00b0C.SDS-PAGE and fluorographyBoil the samples for 5 min/95 \u00b0C.Spin the tubes and load the supernatant onto SDS-PAGE mini-gels (10%; 1 mm gels).Here you can also load a molecular weight standard on the gel.Run the electrophoresis for ~2 h at constant 120 V in running buffer (see Recipes). Note that running conditions and time will vary according to the electrophoresis system used.Fix gels with 25 ml/gel fixation solution (see Recipes) for 30 min at room temperature in a clean plastic container on titer plate shaker with slow shaking.Remove the fixation solution and incubate the gel with 25 ml/gel amplify fluorographic reagent for 30 min at room temperature on titer plate shaker with slow rotation.Dry gels onto chromatography paper in a gel dryer for 45 min/80 \u00b0C. Cover the gel with a plastic wrap to avoid sticking to the gel drier cover. The gel must be fully dehydrated (no longer sticky), 45 min at 80 \u00b0C is generally enough.Expose the BAS storage phosphor screen to the dried gel in an exposure cassette for generally 1 week at room temperature, protected from the light. The ideal exposure time will depend on the amount of labeled catD.Scan the screen using the Pharos FX plus molecular imager or equivalent and analyze the result by using the Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).", "1.

Computational analysis becomes difficult if cells form clusters on the coverslip.\nResuspend trypsinized cells in culture medium and remove trypsin by gentle centrifugation and subsequent aspiration of medium.\nResuspend cell pellet in an appropriate volume of culture medium, or at a desired cell concentration.\nPrepare coverslips.\nBy using appropriate forceps, put sterile coverslips at the bottom of the well(s).\nCritical: We recommend using round 10mm coverslips for 24-multiwell plates or 13mm for 12-multiwell plates, which will minimize any issue (i.e.: breakage, overlay) during their handling. Coverslips must be clean; if they are not, clean them with 1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), followed by extensive washes with deionized water. Moreover, coverslips must be sterile; if they are not, sterilize them at 200\u00b0C for 2h in a heater.\nWash the coverslips 1 time with 1\u00d7 PBS. Make sure they adhere to the bottom of the well(s) by gently pushing them with sterile forceps after cell seeding.\nCritical: This step is crucial to ensure cells do not grow below the coverslips.\nPlate cells on coverslips.\nSeed cells to have about 50% confluency.Critical: Do not seed too many cells, if characterized by a high growing rate, as the over-confluency will hamper the consequent computational analysis.\nOn the same line, spread cells properly by extensively moving the multi-well (or whichever type of plastic support you are using) in multiple directions, to avoid the formation of cell clusters.\nCoverslips can be coated with specific adhesion agents depending on the cell type used.\nUsing a sterile tip, push gently the coverslips to the bottom of the well since you want cells to adhere on top of the coverslip.\nPut cells in the humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 16\u00a0h before proceeding.\nStep 2: Treat cells with amino acid analogs\nTiming: \u223c3 h\nAmino acid analogs are methyl ester group-bearing amino acids, which cause the rapid, osmosis-driven, expansion of lysosomes. We tested three types of such compounds on cells (individually): L-Leucine methyl ester hydrochloride, L-Alanine methyl ester hydrochloride, L-Histidine methyl ester hydrochloride. L-Leucine methyl ester hydrochloride caused the strongest effect in our cell models.\nTreat cells with amino acid analog.\nDilute amino acid analog stock solution in culture medium at the desired concentration.\nNote: The expansion effect is dose and time-dependent. Use a working concentration between 1mM (mild expansion) and 10mM (maximum expansion) up to at least 2h of incubation to reach the maximum effect. Moreover, if you are using phenol red-containing medium, you will notice a change in color towards yellow. Indeed, amino acid analogs are slightly acidic compounds.\nTake cells from point 6d and gently remove culture medium.\nAdd culture medium supplemented with amino acid analogs and put back cells in the incubator for 2\u00a0h.\nNote: After having removed culture medium (7b) add the one containing amino acids analogs (7c) without introducing any further cell starvation step.\nCell fixationTiming: \u223c30\u00a0min\nFixation is the most critical step of the protocol. The membrane of expanded lysosomes is extremely fragile, and their morphology can be strongly affected by the fixation method. Hence, the aim of this section is to describe a detailed protocol based on three different fixation procedures, which allows to preserve at its best the lysosomal morphology.\nMethanol-based fixation procedure:\nPour pure methanol in a multi-well or in any kind of plastic support you need to use.\nPut methanol-containing multi-well at \u221220\u00b0C in a fridge.\nWait approximately for 15\u00a0min.\nPut multi-well from 6d on ice.\nUsing the appropriate forceps, transfer coverslips-containing cells into cold methanol.\nWait 5\u00a0min.\nCritical: Do not extend fixation time over 5\u00a0min, as the methanol fixation also promotes membranes permeabilization and, as such, a longer exposure could eventually affect per\u00a0se the lysosomal morphology.\nAspirate methanol and wash with 1\u00d7 PBS by 4 or 5 rapid washes before proceeding with immunostaining step or confocal microscopy analysis.\nGlutaraldehyde-based fixation procedure:\nAspirate culture medium and wash the cells one time with 1\u00d7 PBS at room temperature (Alcantara-Ortigoza et\u00a0al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nFix the cells by adding a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.05% glutaraldehyde (GA) prepared in 0.2M HEPES buffer for 10\u00a0min (Alcantara-Ortigoza et\u00a0al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nWash the cells once with 4% PFA (prepared in 0.2M HEPES buffer) to remove the residual GA and fix them again by adding 4% PFA and incubate them at RT for 30\u00a0min.\nWash the cells three time with 1\u00d7 PBS solution before proceeding with immunostaining step or microscopy analysis.\nCritical: Upon fixation, cells can be stored at 4\u00b0C for few days. If a longer period is needed, it is recommended to seal up the multi-well plate with Parafilm to avoid any evaporation of the PBS solution.Formaldehyde-based fixation procedure:\nAspirate culture medium and wash the cells one time with 1\u00d7 PBS at RT.\nFix the cells by adding formaldehyde solution (3.7% in 1\u00d7 PBS) and let it to act for 30\u00a0min at RT.\nDuring incubation, prepare the glycine-based blocking solution (0.1M Gly in 1\u00d7 PBS). This solution must be freshly prepared and cooled in ice before use.\nAspirate fixation solution and replace it with glycine-based blocking solution. Incubate on ice for 5\u00a0min.\nWash the cells two times with 1\u00d7 PBS before proceeding with the immunostaining protocol.\nCell immunostaining of lysosomal endogenous proteins\nTiming: \u223c3 h\nThis section describes the immunostaining method for the endogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1 protein. This is a critical step for both the visualization of enlarged lysosomes by means of confocal microscopy and for the quantitative analysis of their morphological changes (i.e.,: number, size, diameter).\nIn our study, we used anti-Lamp1 antibody to visualize the lysosomal compartment.\nAfter having treated cells with amino acid analogs and proceeded with fixation protocol, cells were permeabilized by using blocking buffer (0.05% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin in 1\u00d7 PBS) for 15\u00a0min at RT.\nNote: Methanol fixation method already promotes cell permeabilization. Thus, step 6a can be omitted.\nDuring the blocking step, dilute at a 1:500 ratio the anti-Lamp1 antibody in blocking buffer.\nWash cells once with 1\u00d7 PBS at 25\u00b0C.\nMix the diluted antibody by inverting or vortexing, and spin down for a second.\nPrepare a rectangle of parafilm on the working bench by spreading a few drops of water between the parafilm and the bench to let it to adhere.Add 50\u00a0\u03bcL of the diluted primary antibody solution on the parafilm. This volume is appropriate for 10\u00a0mm and 13\u00a0mm coverslips. Add more volume for larger coverslips. The right volume is the one that allows the coverslip to float on the drop.\nGently put the coverslip upside-down with the cells in contact with the drops of antibody-containing solution and incubate for 1\u00a0h at RT.\nNote: This drop-based protocol allows one to reduce the consumption of the antibody for each experiment, yet without influencing the efficacy and/or reproducibility of the procedure.\nCritical: Before positioning the coverslip on the drops, remove the excess PBS solution that is still adsorbed on the coverslip by letting it touch the surface of a piece of adsorbing paper. This step is fundamental to avoid any further and undesired dilution of the antibody.\nAfte the incubation with primary antibody, add 150\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 PBS between parafilm and coverslip to let it float on the drops.\nCritical: This step is instrumental for transferring back coverslips from Parafilm to multi-well without damaging or leaving cells on the Parafilm bedding.\nWash cells three times with 1\u00d7 PBS for 5\u00a0min each.\nDilute the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies at a ratio of 1:500 using blocking buffer.\nMix the diluted secondary antibodies by inverting or vortexing, and spin down for a second.\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL drops of the diluted secondary antibodies solution.\nCritical: Incubation with secondary antibodies must be performed in the dark. Cover the coverslips with a cover to protect them from light and prevent photobleaching.\nIncubate for 45\u00a0min at RT.\nWash cells three times with 1\u00d7 PBS 5\u00a0min each.\nAdd 10\u00a0\u03bcL of mounting solution on the slide.Dip coverslips in sterile water before putting them on the drop of mounting solution to remove any trace of salts.\nLet them dry in a dark chamber before proceeding with microscopy analysis.\nStep 3: Confocal microscopy acquisition\nTiming: 1\u00a0day\nIn this section we describe in detail the setting and acquisition mode applicable to either living or fixed cells by using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk system (PerkinElmer) (D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or the LSM700 confocal system (Carl Zeiss) (D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), respectively. The protocol described here is applicable for any fluorescent molecule excitable at 488\u00a0nm (such as a GFP, FITC, Alexa Fluor 488, etc.), as well as for other fluorescent molecules excitable at any other different wavelengths.\nLive-imaging acquisition procedure: This section of the protocol describes the visualization of the exogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1-mGFP protein. For the live-based visualization, cells must be grown in multi-well with glass-bottom and the microscope must be equipped with a dedicated chamber necessary to maintain temperature and CO2 at 37\u00b0C and 5%, respectively.\nSwitch on the microscope and set up parameters to the thermostatic chamber to let it reach the selected temperature and CO2.\nAll samples are observed by using an oil immersion objective (63\u00d7 1.4 NA).\nThe channel is set to 488-nm laser by using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk software.\nAdjust the laser power and time exposure. For this study, the variables were adjusted as follows: laser power at 50% and time exposure between 200 and 500\u00a0ms.\nResearchers should optimize the settings for optimal image intensity.\nAfter capturing, images can be processed using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk software to adjust their intensity.\nCapture images from at least 20 different fields for the quantification of lysosomal diameter.Acquired images are saved as .Tiff, .JPG or .PNG formats and can be visualized for quantitative analysis by using the ImageJ Fiji software.\nAcquisition procedure from fixed cells: This section describes the visualization of stained cells to analyze the endogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1 protein. All images are acquired by confocal microscopy. To use LSM700 software, researchers need to refer to the manufacturer\u2019s manual for the Zeiss LSM700 instrument.\nAll samples are observed using a confocal microscope equipped with a 63\u00d7 or 40\u00d7 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. The observation can be made even with a non-confocal microscope.\nCritical: Do not use non-oil objectives. The oil is necessary to improve the resolving power of the microscope which is crucial to get high-resolution images that allow the best estimation of the dimension from the smallest to the largest lysosomal structures.\nThe channel is set to 488-nm laser by using the LSM700 Zeiss software.\nAdjust the pinhole, laser power, PMT gain, and offset. For this study, the variables were adjusted as follows: pinhole at 0,42 A.U., laser power at 2.0, PMT gain between 500 and 700, and the offset at \u221220.\nResearchers should optimize the settings for optimal image intensity varying and keeping laser power or PMT gain always under the maximum before bleaching. Anyway, the instructions we have provided on the Lamp1-mGFP expressing cells, the antibody against Lamp1, and the fixation procedures guarantee the optimal outcome which can be easily reached also with other acquisition systems including the non-confocal ones.\nAfter capturing, images can be processed using LSM700 Zeiss software to adjust their intensity.\nCapture images from at least 20 different fields of three independent experiments. For a good statistically significant quantification, one need to analyze at least 50 lysosomal diameters for 20 cells/experiment for a total of 3000 lysosomal diameters.Acquired images are saved as \u201c.lsm5\u201d format and can be opened using LSM700 or ImageJ Fiji software. Images can then be exported to the .Tiff, .JPG, .PNG, and many others for the post-processing analysis.", "1. Cloning of transgene, transgenic line production and selection\nClone the promoter of choice in the appropriate entry vector. Use a recombination-based cloning method (Table of Materials) and recombine the promoters in pDONRP4-P1r. Clone RPL18 (with affinity tag or fluorescent protein of choice) using recombination-based cloning in pDONRP1-P249.\nCombine the entry vector containing RPL18 with the promoter-containing entry vector in a two fragment recombination reaction into the appropriate destination vector with FAST-red selection cassette50 to facilitate direct selection of transgenic seeds.\nVerify the recombined vector by sequencing and transform it into suitable, competent agrobacteria. Flower dip Arabidopsis plants and after 3-4 weeks harvest and select T1 seeds51.\nUse microscopy to identify well-expressing lines and verify expression patterns according to the reported promoter activity in multiple independent lines. Select lines showing a representative expression pattern with a single T-DNA insertion. This might help to minimize silencing and will be advantageous for genetic crosses.\nSelect T3 offspring that is homozygous for the marker gene.\n2. Propagation and sterilization\nCell type-specific TRAP isolates RNA from a limited number of target cells per root. To generate the needed starting material, propagate homozygous lines. To this end, use standard growth conditions with a special focus on fungal growth control.\n\tNOTE: If single insertion lines cannot be obtained, grow batches in large populations over few generations to avoid T-DNA-induced transgenerational silencing.\nSterilize large quantities of Arabidopsis seeds with one round of chlorine gas and one round of 70% EtOH.Spread seeds evenly on 12 cm x 12 cm square Petri dishes (less than 0.3 mL seeds/plate) and stack them into a desiccator or other suitable container. Avoid clump or heap formation as the seeds need to be accessible to the gas. Perform gas sterilization overnight with bleach and HCl volumes as reported52: 100 mL of bleach (13%) with 6 mL of conc. HCl in a 60 L desiccator. Defumigate for at least 1 h before collecting the seeds in a sterile container.\n\t\tCAUTION: 37% HCl is highly corrosive and requires careful handling. Chlorine gas is toxic, use a fume hood.\nTake 0.1 mL of dry, gas-sterilized seeds per plate and mix them with sterilization solution (70% EtOH, 0,01% Tween) at room temperature. Incubate for 20 min, decant EtOH and wash the seeds 3-4 times with sterile H2O.\nTransfer the soaked seeds into 50 mL tubes and dilute with sterile 0.1% agar to obtain 1 mL of imbibed seed slurry per plate (0.1 mL seed/1 mL slurry).\n\t\tNOTE: Due to transgene integration events, plant lines can be susceptible to different sterilization techniques; especially EtOH incubation time was found to be critical. In our hands, the dual sterilization steps were necessary to avoid fungal contamination during the experiments. This is especially important when performing time series as contamination of a single time point hampers the whole experiment. It might well be that dual sterilization is not always needed, depending on local growing conditions.\n3. PlatingPrepare these steps in advance. Pour \u00bd MS plates (pH 5.8) with 1% agar in the quantities needed for the experiment (20-30 per sample/time point). Cut 1 mL pipette tips to enlarge the tip diameter to ca. 3-4 mm with a razor blade. Autoclave the tips. Create a template holder for plating three rows of seeds per plate with square Petri dish lids. Prepare a laminar flow hood to provide a sterile work environment and label the plates to be processed.\n\tNOTE: If many plates are processed at the same time, colored labels can speed up the labeling.\nPlace empty agar plates into the template holder and distribute 1 mL of imbibed seeds evenly onto three rows. Place the processed plates in stacks into the laminar flow until the seeds are dry (i.e., stick to the agar surface). Do not leave the plates longer as the agar will dry out as well.\nOnce the seeds are sufficiently dry, close the lids and seal each plate with micropore tape. Stratify the seeds for two days at 4 \u00b0C in the dark and afterwards place them into a growth chamber.\n4. Tissue treatment (optional)\nNOTE: In this protocol, we outline the exogenous treatment of Arabidopsis roots with the synthetic auxin variant NAA. Depending on the experimental question at hand, this part needs to be adjusted or can be omitted entirely.\nPrepare strips of tissue paper of 1.5 - 2 cm in height and 10 cm in length. Extended incubation times require the tissue to be autoclaved prior to use.Remove the micropore tape from all plates that have to undergo the hormone treatment. Dilute 1 mL of 10 mM NAA (dissolved in DMSO) in 1\u00a0L of liquid, autoclaved \u00bd MS solution (pH 5.8) and soak the tissue paper in the solution (10 \u00b5M NAA).\nUse tweezers to apply a strip of tissue paper onto each row of roots. Gently use fingers to remove air bubbles. Empty excess liquid from the plate, close the lid and label the plate with the time. For extended incubation times, place the plates back into the growth chamber.\n5. Harvesting\nRetrieve plates for each biological replicate/time point/treatment. Collect liquid nitrogen in a clean Dewar vessel and label tubes (15 or 50 mL) for the different tissue samples. Prepare a Styrofoam holder.\n\tCAUTION: Become familiar with liquid nitrogen handling procedures (aeration, frostbites, potentially exploding tubes).\nOpen the plate and remove the tissue paper with forceps, being careful not to detach the roots from the agar surface. With a surgical blade, cut once per row along the shoot-root-junction in a single, determined stroke. Clean the blades between samples and exchange frequently to guarantee sharpness.\nWith tweezers, swipe along the roots of each row to collect them in three bundles. Grab the roots and empty them into a 50 mL tube filled with liquid nitrogen to snap freeze.\n\tNOTE: Do not try to assemble roots into dense structures (like balls) as they are difficult to grind in the next step.\nProceed with all plates that constitute one sample (in the order of incubation times) and pour out excess liquid nitrogen. Use the tube lid to prevent the roots from spilling. Then close the lid and collect all tubes in the Dewar vessel. Store the root tissue at -80 \u00b0C.\n6. ImmunopurificationNOTE: This step aims to obtain high-quality TRAP/polysome RNA. Therefore, strictly follow good practice advice for RNA handling. Perform all steps in this section in a sterile bench and clean all equipment and labware with an RNase-removing solution (Table of Materials). Wear gloves and change them immediately when contaminated with sample, ice, or other sources that have not been cleaned. Since this is a very crucial aspect, a section on equipment reuse together with waste disposal advice is included.\nBuffer preparation\n\t\nPrepare stock solutions according to Table 1 and autoclave (A) or filter sterilize (\u20b3). Unless otherwise specified, the solvent is RNase-free water.\nDissolve and aliquot dithiothreitol (DTT), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), cycloheximide (CHX) and chloramphenicol (CAM) in their respective solvents as indicated in Table 1 and store them at -20 \u00b0C. All other stocks can remain at room temperature.\nPre-mix the stocks - with ingredients 1-4 for wash buffer (WB) and 1-6 for polysome extraction buffer (PEB) - to avoid time-consuming buffer mixing prior to every extraction. Thus, only add water and the frozen ingredients (7-10) on the day of the extraction. Keep the pre-mixed stocks and RNase-free water at 4 \u00b0C.\n\t\tNOTE: DTT concentration is 1/5 of the reported concentration from Zanetti et al. 2005, as the nanobody interaction with the GFP is sensitive to high DTT concentrations.\ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2,3,4,5\n,Ingredients,,Stock concentration,Add volume in mL for 50 mL of WB*,Add volume in mL for 50 mL of PEB*\n1.0,\"Tris, pH 9\",A,2 M,5,5\n2.0,KCl,A,2 M,5,5\n3.0,EGTA,A,0.5 M,2.5,2.5\n4.0,MgCl2,A,1 M,1.75,1.75\n5.0,PTE,A,20% (v/v),0,2.5\n6.0,detergent mix,A,,0,2.5\n,Tween 20,,20% (v/v),,\n,Triton-X 100,,20% (v/v),,\n,Brij-35,,20% (w/v),,\n,Igepal,,20% (v/v),,\n7.0,DTT,\u20b3,0.5 M,0.1,0.1\n8.0,PMSF,\u20b3,0.1 M (isopropanol),0.5,0.5\n9.0,Cycloheximide,\u20b3,25 mg/mL (EtOH),0.1,0.1\n10.0,Chloramphenicol,\u20b3,50 mg/mL (EtOH),0.05,0.05Table 1: Buffer composition and mixing advice.

Thaw aliquots of DTT, PMSF, CHX and CAM. Mix PEB and WB from the stock solutions in 50 mL tubes according to requirements of the day (# of samples) and cool on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Add PMSF only shortly before use, as the half-life of PMSF in water is only 30 min.\nPrepare plenty of liquid nitrogen in a Dewar vessel and retrieve tissue samples from -80 \u00b0C storage. Wear cotton gloves underneath the standard lab gloves to prevent burns from cold mortars. Pour liquid nitrogen into mortars and pestles until they are cold enough to allow grinding. It is recommended to devise a system to distinguish mortars (label or keep in a certain order).\nEmpty tissue sample into a mortar and grind carefully until all material is a white powder. If needed, add liquid nitrogen to keep the tissue frozen or to facilitate better grinding.\nAdd 5 mL of PEB to the sample and quickly mix with the powder before the buffer freezes. While this sample thaws (mix from time to time) process another sample.\nAs soon as the mixture can be transferred, empty the slurry into a glass homogenizer and keep on ice. With an additional 2 mL of PEB, rinse the mortar and pestle and add it to the sample in the homogenizer.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid a completely liquid sample as this allows RNA degradation.Grind the slurry manually until the extract is homogenous. We recommend a minimum of 4 to 5 plunges.\n\t\tNOTE: It may require some additional waiting time to allow the slurry to thaw further. Handling of homogenizers requires some diligence. Do not apply brute force and beware of suction forces. If not taken into account, this will lead to spillage, contamination or destruction of the homogenizer.\nPour the crude root extract into a 50 mL centrifuge tube (keep on ice).\n\t\tNOTE: Usually several samples can be ground before transfer. Parallel handling of grinding, transferring and homogenizing is required. Try to work quickly but do not rush; stay calm. Always keep homogenized samples on ice.\nTotal RNA sample collection\n\t\nTransfer 200 \u00b5L aliquots of each crude sample to a clean microcentrifuge tube (labeled and cooled on ice beforehand).\nProceed with the RNA extraction as detailed for TRAP samples in points 7.1 and 7.2. Do these steps while samples are clearing in the centrifuge.\nPerform a DNase treatment with the resuspended total RNA to eliminate DNA contamination and clean up the reaction using a commercial kit (Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Total RNA extractions usually yield high concentrations and samples need to be diluted considerably. We recommend measuring the concentration after dilution by the sensitive Qubit protocol.\nClearing the crude extract\n\t\nTake the ice bucket with samples from 6.2.7 and centrifuge them for 15 min at 16,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C.\n\t\tNOTE: To balance out the centrifuge, pair samples accordingly. In case this is not entirely possible, adjust one sample by adding PEB.\nPour the supernatant to a fresh centrifuge tube (cooled on ice beforehand) and repeat centrifugation (15 min at 16,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C). This transfer can be quickly performed next to the centrifuge.While the crude extract is clearing, initiate the washing of GFP-beads for step 6.6.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep this ice bucket for rocking on the shaker but do not place back into the sterile bench as it might be contaminated.\nBead wash\n\t\nAliquot magnetic GFP-beads (#samples x 60 \u00b5L, Table of Materials) into a 1.5 mL tube. Place on the magnetic stand. Once the beads have collected, remove the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of cold WB, resuspend the beads and collect them again. Discard the wash buffer and repeat once more with 1 mL of WB.\nUltimately, resuspend the beads in WB to the initial volume used in step 6.5.1.\nImmunopurification (IP)\n\t\nImmediately after centrifugation, pour the cleared supernatant into labeled 15 mL tubes and add 60 \u00b5L of washed beads per sample.\nPlace all samples horizontally into the ice bucket and put it on a shaker. Let the mixture incubate for 2 h in order to bind the GFP-labeled polysomes to the beads.\nCollect the beads on the magnetic stand for 15 mL tubes (on ice) and add PMSF to the remaining PEB. Discard the supernatant. Pour approximately 5 mL of PEB to the beads and resuspend them by tilting. Shake the samples for 15 min in the same setup as in section 6.6.2.\nRepeat the washes with WB to a total of 3 washes (1 x PEB, 2 x WB). Before each buffer exchange, add PMSF.\nCollect the beads in 1 mL of WB and transfer them to a 1.5 mL tube. Finally, collect the beads one more time on the magnetic stand and remove all liquid. Close the tube and keep on ice until all samples are processed.\nTransport the samples to a fume hood for RNA extraction.\nWaste disposal and reconditioning of lab supplies.If performed according to good lab practice (see section 2.2.1), the sterilization procedure yields an aqueous NaCl solution. Leave the chlorine gas, as well as residual HCl and bleach, to defumigate in the fume hood.\nPEB and WB disposal: As CHX decomposes at high pH, collect all liquids and bring to pH>9. Dispose of the liquid waste in the halogenated chemical waste. All solids (tissues, serological pipettes, gloves, etc.) should be disposed of as chemical waste.\nCollect phenol-containing liquids separately, as well as phenol-contaminated material (tips, tubes and gloves).\nHand-wash mortars, pestles and homogenizers (sponges and brush) with soap and rinse thoroughly. Subsequently, bake the material at >220 \u00b0C overnight. Either wrap in tin foil before the treatment or place into a heat-proof, covered container.\nBrush clean centrifuge tubes with detergent and then diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treat in the fume hood. To this end, add liquid DEPC to deionized water (1 mL of DEPC to 1 L of H2O) and mix via shaking. Place the centrifuge tubes onto an autoclavable tray that catches spilled DEPC-water. Pour the suspension into the tubes and leave for 3 h or overnight. DEPC decomposes in the subsequent autoclaving process.\n\t\tCAUTION: DEPC is highly toxic.\n7. RNA extraction and QC\nRNA extraction\n\t\nCool down the tabletop centrifuge to 4 \u00b0C.\nAdd 1 mL of acid-guanidinium-phenol-based reagent (Table of Materials) to each sample, invert to resuspend the beads or total RNA slurry and incubate for 5 min on ice. Do not vortex!\nAdd 200 \u00b5L of chloroform and incubate for 3 min on ice. Then thoroughly vortex the samples.\nTo aid phase separation, centrifuge at max. speed for 10-15 min, 4 \u00b0C.\nLabel 1.5 mL low-retention tubes (Table of Materials) and aliquot 650 \u00b5L of isopropanol into each.Carefully take the upper aqueous phase (ca. 650 \u00b5L) and transfer to the prepared tubes with isopropanol. Avoid touching the pink organic phase.\nPrecipitate RNA overnight at -20 \u00b0C.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to store the samples in isopropanol at -20 \u00b0C or -80 \u00b0C and only solubilize in water when needed. Aqueous RNA degrades even at -80 \u00b0C when stored for weeks/months.\nRNA precipitation\n\t\nCool down the tabletop centrifuge to 4 \u00b0C.\nPrepare fresh 80% EtOH with RNase-free water and cool down at -20 \u00b0C (5 min at -80 \u00b0C help to speed up the process).\nCentrifuge the samples at maximum speed (ca. 13,000 x g) for 30 min and discard the supernatant. The pellet will not be visible, so carefully pipette as if it was there. Add 1 mL of cold 80% EtOH and invert the tube one or two times.\nCentrifuge again for 30 min at maximum speed and repeat the wash to a total of two washes.\nSpin down for 2 min and remove all residual EtOH with a 10 \u00b5L tip. Leave the pellet to dry for 3-5 min (not more) at room temperature and resuspend in 20 \u00b5L RNase-free water.\nKeep the samples on ice and perform quality control as soon as possible. Proceed to store the samples at -80 \u00b0C. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nQuality control using dedicated equipment (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n8. Library preparation\ncDNA synthesis and amplification with the SMARTer v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit\n\t\nCalculate the dilution of each sample to have 1.5 ng of TRAP-RNA or total RNA in a volume of 4.75 \u00b5L. Perform all reactions in PCR-tubes and dilute samples with fresh aliquots of RNase-free water.Perform all steps according to the manufacturer's recommendations with \u00bd the reaction volumes. Amplify the cDNA with 12-13 PCR cycles.\nClean up the PCR by adding 0.5 \u00b5L of 10x lysis buffer and 25 \u00b5L of SPRI beads (Table of Materials). If many samples are processed lysis buffer and beads can be pre-mixed. Make sure that the beads are evenly dispersed before pipetting.\nProceed with the protocol in full reaction volumes (17 \u00b5L of elution buffer). Do not let the beads dry for more than 3 minutes. Overdried samples can potentially be rescued by prolonged incubation times.\nMeasure the sample concentrations with the Qubit HS DNA kit.\n\t\tNOTE: The SMARTer v4 kit can tolerate down to 200 pg input. We did obtain libraries in cases where Qubit values could not be determined (below 250 pg, detection limit) with a 16 cycle PCR. However, the limited input material might also yield less complex libraries.\nFragmentation and adapter ligation PCR with the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit\n\t\nDilute the cDNA with RNase-free water to obtain a concentration of 200 pg/\u00b5l and pipette 1.25 \u00b5L in a PCR-tube.\nPerform all steps according to the manufacturer with \u00bc the reaction volumes. Amplify the cDNA with 12 PCR cycles and compatible adapters for the samples that belong to one sequencing pool. With Illumina's Index Kits A and D up to 384 samples can be multiplexed.\nFor the PCR clean up add 12.5 \u00b5L of resuspension buffer and 22.5 \u00b5L of SPRI beads (0.9x ratio). Elute the sample with 22 \u00b5L of elution buffer.NOTE: QC and pooling was performed by the sequencing company (Table of Materials) and thus no bead-based normalization was needed. The enzymatic fragmentation reaction (tagmentation) is very sensitive to material input as every enzyme only cuts once. Therefore, do not exceed the concentration recommendation.\nSubscription Required.

Alternatively, I1 Mab can be purchased from Kerafast (https://www.kerafast.com/p-171-hybridoma-8g5f11-i1.aspx[href=https://www.kerafast.com/p-171-hybridoma-8g5f11-i1.aspx]). Notes:   Because of high mutation rates leading to high frequency of antibody-resistance mutants, viral stocks can never be fully neutralized. The goal of Mab titration is to produce plaque assays with less than 10-4 (if viral stocks are neutralized) or less than 10-3 (if the Mab is added to the overlay medium) mutants/wt.   Antibodies other than I14 (https://www.kerafast.com[href=https://www.kerafast.com/]) can be used to calculate mutant frequencies.     BHK-21 cells are washed twice with saline solution, trypsinized and 0.8-1.0 x 105 are seeded in T25 flasks with MEM-H supplemented with 7% BCS and 0.06% PP3. The flasks are gassed for 2 sec with 10% CO2 using a plugged Pasteur pipette. Caps are locked.   The cells are incubated for 24 h to produce monolayers 90% confluent.   On day 2 cell monolayers are treated with no mutagen (mock) or with the mutagen 5-FU at a range of concentrations between 1 and 100 \u03bcg/ml for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml).   Dilute viral stocks in MEM-H+FBS as needed to produce a 106 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml solution.   Use 200 \u03bcl to infect a BHK-21 monolayer for each 5-FU concentration. Incubate 10 min at room temperature (RT) and 40 min at 37 \u00b0C.\u00a0 Add 5 ml of MEM-H+FBS+5-FU (Figure 1, right).   From the 106 PFU/ml solution carry out additional, 10-fold, 100-fold and 1000-fold dilutions. Use each of the three dilutions (105, 104 and 103 PFU/ml solutions) to infect at least 3 BHK-21 monolayers with 200 \u03bcl of the dilution to carry out plaque assay in the presence of I1Mab.Do not neutralize the mixture with I14Mab prior to infection, as it will result in incorrect data due to phenotypic mixing and hiding (Valcarcel and Ortin, 1989; Holland et al., 1989). Incubate 10 min at room temperature (RT) and 40 min at 37 \u00b0C. Prewarm a mixture of MEM-H+FBS and I14Mab, add agarose to a final concentration of 0.2%, and add 5 ml of mixture to flasks (Figure 1, left). Note: Even if the virus stock has a known concentration it is recommended that a titration is done in parallel by triplicate plaque assay Figure 1, top left).    imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312235055_5527.jpg Figure 1. Flowchart showing the infections needed to calculate the frequency of I1 MARM and the sensitivity to 5-FU. Details are given in the text.    Incubate mutagenized infections and plaque assays for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (Figure 1).   Develop all plaque assays (Figure 1). Because of the low agarose concentration there is no need to fix the cells. Just let the medium overlay slide out and add 2-3 ml of crystal violet solution. Wait for 5 min at RT, discard crystal violet and rinse with tap water.   Count plaques and calculate mutant frequency by dividing Monoclonal antibody resistant mutant (MARM) titers (Figure 1B) by wt titers (Figure 1A).   Check virus replication by examining monolayers under the microscope. When cytopatic effect is > 90%, recover mutagenized populations. Notes:   For lower FU concentrations 24 h are usually sufficient, but for FU concentrations over 30 \u03bcg/ml it may take up to three days.   Samples may be frozen so titrations can be carried out for the complete set of mutagenized samples in a single assay.     Carry out titrations of control and mutagenized viral yields. To improve statistical significante it is recommended to do duplicate or triplicate plaque assays for each dilution.Allow 24-36 h of incubation.   Develop plaque assays with crystal violet and count claque (Figure 1C).   Robustness can be calculated as the slope of the regression of log transformed normalized viral titers vs. square-root transformed 5-FU concentration (Figure 2). The more robust the strain is the closer to a slope of 1.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140312/20140312235153_5536.jpg  Figure 2. To calculate robustness the log-transformed viral titer is represented against the square root of mutagen concentration. Robustness is the slope of the regression (shown at the top of the graph).    To test whether changes in survival are the result of changes in the overall mutation rate, and not in the neutral mutation rate, mutant frequencies must be compared. When all other environmental parameters are the same, mutant frequencies correlate with mutation rates. If mutant frequency and survival to mutagenesis correlate inversely, the latter may not represent robustness. In such case, a clonal analysis is indicated.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare the cells for imaging\nTiming: 3\u00a0days\nThis step describes the cell preparation for imaging.

Place the reaction in a shaking incubator (37 \u00b0C, 250 rpm) for 1 h.To eliminate the uninfected cells, transfer the infection reaction to 50 mL of LB media containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol for the diversification step or LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol for the screening step.To count the library size of the infection, spot plate on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics.In a 96-well plate, perform serial dilutions of the infection reaction with ePLM. Perform five dilutions, from 1:10 to 1:105. Add 180 \u03bcL of ePLM to rows A-E. In row A, add 20 \u03bcL of the infection reaction.Preform the rest of the dilutions by adding 20 \u03bcL of the previous dilution to the next row. Make sure to mix well and change pipette tips after each dilution. This step can be done with multichannel pipettors.Using a multichannel pipettor, plate 5 \u03bcL of each infection reaction dilution on LB agar plates containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol for the diversification step or LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol forthe screening step.Incubate spotted plates overnight in a standing incubator (37 \u00b0C).Count CFU/mL in the morning to determine library size. Remember to multiply the number of colonies counted by the dilution factor corresponding to that row to obtain CFU/mL.To check whether phage production and infection steps were carried correctly, run the following controls:Infect desired strains with another phage lysate that has already generated an expected library size. This control will determine if phage production or infection failed.Plate uninfected cells on LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol or kanamycin to test whether the infected strain has resistance to either antibiotic.Introduction of P1 phage into P1-free strains for desired screening strains Produce phage lysate from a strain containing P1 and phagemid.Induce phage production (see section: Phage production).Infect the strain of interest (see section: Phage infection).Streak 10 \u03bcL of infection reaction on standard size LB agar plates to obtain single colonies.Screen 10\u201320 colonies for P1 using P1-specific primers (fragment size 296 bp):Forward primers: ACGACCATGAAAGCTCTTCACCCGTAGReverse primers: GCTTATTCGCACCTTCCCTAAAAACAAAGATGTTTGTAGNote: To increase P1 infection efficiency to a new strain, use 1:10 cells:phage lysate by volume.Note that this ratio differs for infection with phagemid-containing particles that were discussed previously. Screening/Selection Freshly infected screening/selection strains are directly used from the prior step.Screening/selection steps are different based on the application.Example 1: Growth-based selection for increasing the utilization of a specific sugar.Ensure that the screening/selection strain achieves a low, but nonzero growth rate in minimal media containing the sugar as the sole carbon source.Select improved variants by culturing the library in minimal media containing the sugar as the sole carbon source.Subinoculate culture 2\u20135 times to select rapidly-growing strains before transfer back to the diversification strain. Repeated subinoculations without transfer run the risk of selecting for strains withgenomic mutations.Example 2: Biosensor-enabled screening for increasing the production of a molecule or protein.Include a biosensor in the screening/selection strain that couples productivity to fluorescence, where wild-type productivity remains in the linear range of the biosensor.Culture the screening/selection strain under conditions that favor biomolecule production.Screen for high-producing variants via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).As above, isolated variants can be grown and re-sorted via FACS several times before transfer back to the diversification strain.Mutagenesis, Phage production, Phage infection, and Screening/Selection steps are repeated until a satisfactory variant is found.After screening is complete Plasmids may be extracted from screened/selected libraries and used for next-generation sequencing to measure the frequencies of common mutations.

Quarantine your P1 work as much as possible from your other projects. This can be done by designating a separate bench space and materials for projects involving phages.Use filter tips when pipetting P1 phage lysate.Use Virkon to wipe off all surfaces and tools after handling phages.Store phage lysate in screw-top 15 or 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Infections and phage production are also done in these tubes.If possible, store P1 lysates in a 4 \u00b0C fridge that is not used for other E. coli\u00a0experiments.Do not keep old plates of bacteria containing P1 as phages can initiate lysis in stationary colonies (<1 week in 4 \u00b0C).", "1.

Switch experiments procedure In the incubator, pre-warm one empty 5 ml syringe, two 5 ml syringes filled with 3 ml condition 2 medium, the flask filled with 30 ml of condition 2 medium, and the filter with a plastic adapter on the nozzle. Sterility of the media has to be maintained at this step. With the empty syringe (needle inner diameter: 0.8 mm), sample cells from the primary culture in condition 1. Notes: The volume depends on two factors. (i) It has to be maximized so that the absorbance when eluted in the condition 2 flask can be reproducibly measured at step 6 (for example, 2 ml of E. coli culture at OD600 nm = 3 in the primary culture provide a measurable OD600 nm = 0.2 in the secondary culture). (ii) It has to be minimized to avoid clogging the filter at step 3.From step 2 onward, the manipulations have to be performed as rapidly as possible to minimize the culture perturbation (i.e., in less than 2 min). As a control, we suggest performing the same experiment by replacing condition 2 medium by condition 1 and ensuring that the initial growth rate in the secondary culture is equal to the growth rate in the primary culture. Attach the filter to syringe filled with 3 ml of pre-warmed condition 2 medium and rinse the cells on filter (the flow-through is discarded). Replace the syringe by one of the two syringes filled with 3 ml of pre-warmed condition 2 medium and rinse the cells on the filter with medium 2. Attach the second 5 ml syringe filled with 3 ml of pre-warmed condition 2 medium on the other end of the filter using the plastic adapter.Elute the cells over the flask filled with 30 ml of condition 2 medium. Place the flask in the shaker incubator for 1 min to ensure homogeneity of the solution and measure the initial OD. Immediately place the flask back in the incubator. Monitor again the growth of the secondary culture when the cells reach their maximal growth rate on condition 2 (standardized by trial). For example, switching E. coli from a glucose to an acetate based mineral medium required measuring the OD at times 60 and 90 minutes after inoculation by spectrophotometry at OD600 nm (Enjalbert et al., 2015). The measure at 60 min allows to calculate the lag (see step 8), and the calculation of the growth rate between 60 and 90 min ensures that the cells reach their maximal growth rate (this maximum growth rate in condition 2 has to be previously determined). Use the following equation to calculate the lag time before maximal growth (see Figure 2 for justification):(t1-tm) = (t1-t0)-ln(X1/X0)/\u03bcmaximgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205160345_8636.jpgFigure 2. Theoretical growth profiles for the calculation of the lag in the switch experiments. tm is the theoretical time needed to increase the biomass from X0 to X1 if the growth rate is maximal (\u00b5max) from t0. If there is a delay, X1 will be obtained at t1 (i.e., later than tm). From these elements, the lag can be determined as (t1-tm). By definition, Eq1: \u03bcmax = ln(X1/X0)/(tm-t0)From whichEq2: (tm-t0)= ln(X1/X0)/\u03bcmaxSince Eq3: (t1-tm)= (t1-t0)-(tm-t0)From Eq3 and Eq2, Eq41: (t1-tm) = (t1-t0)-ln(X1/X0)/\u03bcmax", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAmplification of targeting library\nTiming: 3\u00a0days\nCheck the efficiency of competent cells.\nTake out the GeCKO v2 library of plasmid and competent cells stored at \u221280\u00b0C and thaw them on ice.

Obtain the normalized counts of each sgRNA in amplified library and original sgRNA library. Qualified library will have a coverage higher than 80% and ginidex lower than 0.2. Otherwise, re-amplify the library with a larger scale.\nPackaging of sgRNA library harboring lentivirus\nTiming: 9\u00a0days\nLentivirus production\nPassage HEK293FT cells when reached 90% confluency. Plate HEK293FT cells into 20 100\u00a0mm culture dishes.\nOn the next day, when the cells become 70% confluency, warm up 2\u00d7Transfection Buffer, 2\u00a0M CaCl2 and sterilized ddH2O at a 37\u00b0C water bath for 30\u00a0min before transfection.Add 5\u00a0mL ddH2O, 737.5\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00a0M CaCl2, 100\u00a0\u03bcL sgRNA library plasmid at 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL, 37.5\u00a0\u03bcL PAX2 at 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL, 25\u00a0\u03bcL VSVG at 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL in sequential in a 15\u00a0mL conical tube and mix well by pipetting. Add 5.9\u00a0mL 2\u00d7Transfection Buffer by dropwise and mix immediately. Incubate the transfection mixture at 22\u00b0C\u201326\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min when it become slight turbid toward the light.\nEvenly disperse the transfection mixture onto 5 plates of HEK29FT cells by dropwise (2.36\u00a0mL/plate). Gently swirl the dishes to ensure uniform distribution of the transfection mixture. Place the transfected dishes back into the incubator.\nRepeat steps 14c and 14d for 3 more times to complete the transfection of the rest 15 plates.\nCheck precipitates under the microscope at 1\u00a0h after transfection. Abundant tiny calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitates with Brownian movement predicts a successful transfection.\nContinue to culture the cells in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 16 h.\nAspirate the old medium and replace with 7.5\u00a0mL fresh HEK293FT medium in every dish.\nContinue to incubate the cells for 48 h. Collect the supernatant containing viral particles in a 50\u00a0mL conical tube, and centrifuge at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min to remove cell debris. Harvest the supernatant and filter through a 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm syringe filter.\nSterile the ultracentrifuge tubes and buckets by soaking in 75% ethanol for 10\u00a0min. Air dry them in the biosafety cabinet.\nFill the filtered supernatant into 4 centrifuge tubes, and place them into the buckets. After balancing, centrifuge at 55,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 3\u00a0h at 16\u00b0C.When ultracentrifuge completes, aspirate the supernatant carefully, and collect the virus pellet with 2\u00a0mL hPSC growth medium for each centrifuge tube. Pool all virus suspension in a 15\u00a0mL conical tube and mix well by pipetting. Keep the virus suspension at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201312 h, aliquot (0.5\u00a0mL/vial) and store at \u221280\u00b0C before use.\nPause Point: The virus can be stored at \u221280\u00b0C for several years.\nTitration of the packaged lentivirus solution\nTest the minimal killing concentration of puromycin minimum kill concentration. At the second day after passaging of hPSCs and HEK293FT cells, treat the cells with a serial of concentrations of puromycin (0, 0.25, 0.34, 0.5, 1 and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for 3\u00a0days. 3\u00a0days after treatment, observe the killing efficiency of puromycin by counting the number of living cells. The minimal killing concentration of puromycin is 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for both hPSCs and HEK293FT cells (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/673-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Titration of packaged lentivirus sgRNA library\n(A) Titration the optimal concentration of puromycin for hPSCs. 0, 0.25, 0.34, 0.5, 1 and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL puromycin were applied in hPSCs for 3\u00a0days, and the killing efficiency was observed under the microscope. Scale bar, 100\u00a0\u03bcm.\n(B) Phase contrast images show that HEK293FT cells in the control well without puromycin treatment reach 70% confluency 4\u00a0days after passaging. In puromycin treated wells, all cells in the well infected with 0\u00a0\u03bcL virus solution are killed, and the survival rates of cells infected with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcL virus solution show gradient increase. Scale bar, 100\u00a0\u03bcm.\nSeed HEK293FT cells in a 6-well plate at a density of 50,000 cells/well.On the next day, thaw the stored virus solution on ice and add 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcL virus solution into 5 individual wells. Mark the 6th well as control.\n24\u00a0h after virus infection, add puromycin (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) into the virus-infected HEK293FT cells. Leave the 6th control well untreated and do not add puromycin into this well.\nContinue to culture the cells in the incubator for 3\u00a0days and replace the puromycin-containing fresh HEK293FT medium daily. For the control well, replace fresh HEK293FT medium without puromycin daily.\n3\u00a0days after puromycin treatment, observe the cells of each well under a microscope (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The control well usually reaches 70% confluency. In puromycin treated wells, all cells in the well infected with 0\u00a0\u03bcL virus solution will be killed, and gradient increases of survival in wells infected with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcL virus solution will be observed.\nDigest the cells of each well with trypsin (0.05%) and count the cell number.\nVirus titer (Infectious Units (IFU)/mL)\u00a0= Number of survived cells \u00d7    50,000 Number\u00a0of\u00a0control\u00a0cells    / Volume of virus solution added (mL).\nNumber of survived cells: the number of remaining cells in each well infected with various volumes of virus solution and treated with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL puromycin for 3\u00a0days;\nNumber of control cells: the number of cells in control well without puromycin-treatment at day 4 after seeding.Note: In our case, different dilutions of the virus end up with similar titration results, and the virus titers for GeCKO v2 library, including both A and B pools, are around 106 IFU/mL. If the relationship of the number of survived cells and the volume of virus solution added is not linear, only take account those wells with lower concentrations of virus treatment for calculation. Only 1 frozen-thaw cycle is acceptable, otherwise the IFU of the virus will be greatly reduced.\nNote: hPSCs is not suitable for lentivirus titer test given their clonal growth behavior. Moreover, hPSCs could not survive after plating when they are digested into single cells. Here, we use HEK293FT cells to test virus titer instead of hPSCs.\nScreening of lineage specification preventing genes (LPGs) in hPSCs\nTiming: 30\u00a0days\nInfect PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs with sgRNA lentiviral libraries (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/673-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Genome-scale CRISPR screening in PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs\n(A) Timeline of the screening procedure. 3.4\u00a0\u00d7106 hPSCs were infected with sgRNA lentiviral libraries of A pool or B pool and seeded in one MEF feeder-coated 6-well plate. 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL puromycin was added from day 2 to day 5 to remove uninfected cells. MEF conditioned medium was supplied from day 3 to day 7. When reached 70% confluency at day 7, the library-infected hPSCs were passaged onto six 6-well plates with feeder layer. 2\u00a0days after passage, the hPSCs were treated with or without Dox (3 plates for each group) for 3\u00a0days. 5\u00a0days after passage, when the hPSCs were 70% confluent, both the control and Dox-treated cells were passaged onto eighteen 6-well plates with feeder layer. tdTomato positive cells organized into rosette-like structures were observable 6\u00a0days after the second passage, and FACS sorting and DNA extraction were performed. The whole procedure takes around 18\u00a0days.(B) Some hPSC colones express clustered tdTomato after Dox treatment. Scale bar, 100\u00a0\u03bcm.\n(C) Fluorescent images show that FACS-sorted cells have uniform tdTomato expression. Scale bar, 100\u00a0\u03bcm.\nPrepare PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs in a 6-well plate with 70% confluency.\nWarm up DMEM/F-12, dispase (1.5\u00a0U/mL), trypsin (0.05%) and hPSC growth medium in a 37\u00b0C water bath.\nRinse one well of hPSCs with pre-warmed trypsin and digest the cells with trypsin for another 3\u00a0min in the incubator. Triturate the cell clusters into single cells with 1\u00a0mL pipette and count the total cell number of the well with a hemocytometer.\nCalculate the number of remaining 5 wells of cells.\nDigest the remaining PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs with dispase in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 3\u00a0min after brief rinse with DMEM/F-12. When the edges of hPSC colonies begin to curl, aspirate the dispase and rinse the cells with DMEM/F-12 gently.\nCollect the hPSC colonies using a 10\u00a0mL serological pipette with 10\u00a0mL hPSC growth medium. Blow the colonies off gently and pool all the cells to a 50\u00a0mL conical tube. Pipette up and down against the bottom of the tube to break up the colonies into around 50\u00a0\u03bcm pieces.\nTransfer the amount of cell clump suspension containing 3.4\u00d7106 cells into a 15\u00a0mL conical tube and centrifuge at 600\u00a0\u00d7 g for 2\u00a0min at 22\u00b0C\u201326\u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1\u00a0mL lentivirus solution (106 IFU/mL) at multiplicity of infection (MOI)\u00a0= 0.3 (Joung et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Shalem et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nIncubate the hPSC clumps/lentiviruses mixture in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 30\u00a0min, and gently tap the bottom of the 15\u00a0mL conical tube every 5\u00a0min. After incubation, seed the hPSC clumps/lentiviruses mixture on feeder layer in a new 6-well plate.Continue to culture the hPSCs in a 37\u00b0C incubator and replace refresh hPSC growth medium with 4\u00a0ng/mL bFGF every day.\n2\u00a0days after virus infection, add 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL puromycin to kill uninfected cells for 3\u00a0days. Refresh the medium with puromycin daily.\nWhen the library-infected PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs are 70% confluent, passage them onto 6 new 6-well plates with feeder layer.\nNote: We usually maintain hPSCs on feeder layer of irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and in this way, hPSCs show no spontaneous differentiation. Ensure no occurrence of tdTomato positive cells under a fluorescence microscope every time before starting a screening experiment.\nNote: If the MEF feeder layer is killed by puromycin, add MEF conditioned medium and fresh hPSC growth medium at 1:1 ratio until the cells are ready for passage. To prepare MEF conditioned medium, the MEF feeder layer is cultured with hPSC growth medium for 24 h. The conditioned medium is then collected.\nNote: Before the Dox treatment, the PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs have been expanded by 25-fold for 9\u00a0days (6-fold for 5\u00a0days).\nNote: During passage, to maintain library coverage, pool the library infected PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs together and do not discard any of the cells. 3.4\u00a0\u00d7106 cells \u00d7 0.3 MOI \u00d7 25\u00a0= 2.55\u00a0\u00d7107 cells 2.55\u00a0\u00d7107 cells / 65, 383 gRNA\u00a0= 390-fold representation After Dox treatment, both the control and Dox-treated groups were further expanded for another 9\u00a0days before FACS sorting and DNA extraction, and the cells were pooled for 25 more folds at end point. 390 / 2\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0= 4875-fold representation It is therefore both the control and Dox-treated cells have been expanded by 4875-fold before screening.\nInduce Cas9 expression and initiate genome-scale gene knockout.At step 16l, 2\u00a0days after passaging, add 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Dox for 3 continuous days for 3 plates and leave the other 3 plates untreated as control.\nPassage and expand the control plates and Dox-treated plates onto 18 new 6-well plates, respectively.\nFACS-enrichment of tdTomato expressing transformed cells.\n6\u00a0days after passaging at step 17b, observe the tdTomato expressing pattern in control and Dox-treated cells under a fluorescence microscope. Typical tdTomato expressing cells organized into rosette like structures could be frequently seen in Dox-treated plates, but not in those control ones (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDigest one plate of control and one plate of Dox-treated library infected PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs into single cells with trypsin according to aforementioned method at step 16c.\nPellet the single cells of both control and Dox-treated groups by centrifugation at 1,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 2\u00a0min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets in 5\u00a0mL PBS containing 10% FBS.\nPellet cells again at 1,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 2\u00a0min and resuspend them in 2\u00a0mL PBS.\nPass the control and Dox-treated cell suspension through a 35\u00a0\u03bcm nylon mesh incorporated into the tube cap to remove clumps. Place them on ice.\nRecord the percentage and collect all of the tdTomato positive cells in the Dox-treated group through FACS sorting. Also record the percentage of tdTomato positive cells in the control group by FACS, and re-confirm the percentage of tdTomato positive cells in the control group is always lower than that of the Dox-treated group.\nRepeat steps b-g to digest remaining plates of Dox-treated library infected PAX6-tdTomato/iCas9 hPSCs into single cells for further FACS sorting one plate by another.\nPool all FACS enriched tdTomato cells together. Double check the tdTomato expressing cells under a fluorescence microscope (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).Pellet the tdTomato positive cells by centrifugation at a speed of 2,500\u00a0\u00d7g for 4\u00a0min at 22\u00b0C\u201326\u00b0C. Remove the supernatant and the cell pellet is ready for genomic DNA extraction. Otherwise, store at \u221220\u00b0C before moving to step 20.\nPause Point: The collected cell pellet can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for several days.\nDigest the remaining 17 control plates into single cells with trypsin set at setp16c. Pool all the cells together and mix well by pipetting. Take 6\u00d7106 cells and pellet them through centrifugation at a speed of 2,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 4\u00a0min at 22\u00b0C\u201326\u00b0C. Remove the supernatant and the cell pellet is ready for genomic DNA extraction. Otherwise, store at \u221220\u00b0C before moving to step 20.\nPause Point: The collected cell pellet can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for several days.\nHarvest the genomic DNA of the pelleted control cells with phenol/chloroform extraction, and dissolve the genomic DNA in 50\u00a0\u03bcL sterilized ddH2O. Harvest the genomic DNA of the FACS enriched tdTomato cells by using QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution according to the user manual, and dissolve the genomic DNA in 10\u00a0\u03bcL of sterilized ddH2O.\nPause Point: The genomic DNA can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for several days.\nAmplify the integrated sgRNAs by PCR in control and tdTomato cells, and add Illumina adaptor and barcode sequences according to aforementioned steps 8\u201312. For the first step of PCR amplification, add 10\u00a0\u03bcL genomic DNA templates for both the control (600\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) and tdTomato cells, although the exact amounts of DNA are variant in different conditions.Note: In order to expand the integrated control library with \u223c100-fold representation, \u223c30\u00a0\u03bcg genomic DNA was extracted from 6\u00d7106 control cells and resolved in 50\u00a0\u03bcl sterilized ddH2O (600\u00a0ng/\u03bcl). 6\u00a0\u03bcg DNA in 10\u00a0\u03bcl ddH2O was used for PCR amplification for the integrated sgRNA library, and a total of 5 reactions were performed. All gel recycled PCR products from the 5 reactions were pooled, and 40\u00a0ng DNA products were used for the second-round PCR to add Illumina adaptor and barcode sequences.\nSequence the DNA products on the Illumina HiSeq/NovaSeq system, and use MAGeCK (Li et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) to identify LPGs.\nCut adapter from FASTQ data and just remain 20\u00a0bp sgRNA reads.\nUse reads mapping algorithms (such as Bowtie2) to map reads.\nUse MAGeCK to count sgRNA number and compare counts of each sgRNA in different samples with default parameters and only the reads with unique alignment are reported.\nGet the normalized counts of each sgRNA in control sample and tdTomato cells, respectively.\nEstimate the statistical significance (using a negative binomial test) of enrichment for each sgRNA in the tdTomato cells compared to control cells by using the MAGeCK algorithm.\nIdentify the LPGs by searching for genes whose sgRNAs are ranked consistently higher (by significance) using robust rank aggregation (RRA). Incorporate the negative control in MAGeCk analysis to generate null distributions and calculate the p-value and FDR for each.\nNote: As a marker selection, it is also acceptable to directly compare the enriched sgRNA pools in tdTomato cells with the initial sgRNA pool obtained during the quality control step.", "Preparation of biotin bioassay plates   The biotin assay plates were prepared as previously described with few changes, one of which referred to the thinner thickness of the plate agar where we dropped paper discs (Feng et al., 2013b; Lin et al., 2010). \u00a0   Overnight cultures of strain ER90 (grown in 6 ml of defined M9 minimal medium with 1 nM biotin at 30 \u00b0C) were collected by centrifugation (3,600 rpm, 16 min), washed three times with the same volume (6 ml) of M9 medium, and were cultivated at 37 \u00b0C to 0.8 OD600 in 200 ml of M9 minimal medium containing 1 nM biotin.    To remove excess of biotin, all the bacterial cells from 200 ml culture were washed twice in M9 media and sub-cultured into 1 L of M9 minimal medium at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h to de-repress expression of bio operon by starvation for biotin. \u00a0   The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (3,600 rpm, 16 min), washed three times with M9 medium, re-suspended in 1 ml of the same medium and mixed into 150 ml of the defined M9 agar media supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) TTC as a redox indicator.    Finally, the mixture (5 ml per sector) was poured into Petri dishes sectored with plastic walls to avoid cross-feeding and a sterile paper disk (6 mm, BBL) was centered on the agar top of each sector.      Preparation of cross-feeder strains   In total, four feeder strains of A. tumefaciens corresponded to NTL4 (WT), FYJ283. (\u0394bioBFDA), FYJ212 (\u0394bioRat) and FYJ341 (\u0394bioR::Km+bioRbme).    The biotin auxotroph strain FYJ283 was cultivated in 5 ml of M9 medium supplemented\u00a0 with 1 nM biotin, whereas the other three strains were cultivated in 5 ml of biotin-free M9 minimal media overnight.Overnight cultures were collected by centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 10 min), washed three times using the M9 liquid medium, and transferred into 100 ml of biotin-free M9 media for 6 more hours of growth at 30 \u00b0C to deplete trace amounts of intracellular biotin in the biotin auxotroph strain FYJ283.   Following three rounds of washing with same media, bacteria were resuspended in M9 media and their optical densities at 600 nM (OD600) were adjusted to 1.5. 20 \u03bcl of A. tumefaciens culture (OD600 = 1.0) was spotted on the paper disc, and incubated overnight at 30 \u00b0C.   Finally, the red deposit of formazan (Lin et al., 2010; del et al., 1979; Feng et al., 2014) suggests that the indicator strain ER90 is fed by the A. tumefaciens strains (seen in Figure 1), and the area size (square centimeters) of formazan represents the level of biotin pool produced by the different feeder strains.    imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140913/20140913215310_4994.jpg Figure 1. A representative photograph illustrating the relevance of BioR-mediated regulation to biotin synthesis. It was fully adapted from Feng et al. (2013a). Four A. tumefaciens strains cross-feed E. coli strain ER90 with deletion of full bio operon, which are NTL4 (WT), FYJ283 (\u0394bioBFDA), FYJ212 (\u0394bioRat), and FYJ 341 (\u0394bioRat+bioRbme), respectively.", "Purchase fresh onion bulbs (Allium cepa, cv. Cometa or similar white varieties, ~8 cm in diameter) from a local grocery store. The onions can be stored at 4 \u00b0C up to two weeks.    Remove the dry, papery outer layers. The fleshy scales are numbered consecutively 1, 2, 3\u2026, n with scale #1 being the oldest, outermost layer (Figure 1A).   Excise scale #5 as a ~1 cm wide strip and press a 2 x 1.2 cm piece of double-sided tape to the convex, abaxial surface of the upper middle (near the tip) part of the onion scale (Figure 1B).    Peel off the epidermis (with the tape) by hand, trim to ~1.5 x 1.2 cm (Figure 1C), and place the tape and the sample onto a clean glass slide, with the sample side facing up. Press the perimeter of the sample onto the slide.    Seal the perimeter of the sample with a narrow line of nail polish and add a droplet (~20 \u03bcl) of washing buffer (see Recipes) to the center of the sample to keep it from drying (Figure 1D). The washing buffer should not submerge the surrounding still-wet nail polish. Steps 2 to 5 should be completed in ~30 sec.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171206/20171206195846_6287.jpg Figure 1. Procedure of onion epidermal wall preparation for AFM. A. Numbered onion scales with scale #1 being the oldest, outermost layer. Epidermal peels from scale #5 were usually used for imaging, although other scales are compatible with this procedure. B. A ~1 cm wide strip was excised and a double-sided tape was pressed against the abaxial side of the upper middle (near the tip) part of the onion scale. C. The epidermis was peeled off along with the tape. D.The epidermis and the tape were pressed onto the slide and a drop of washing buffer was added to the center of the sample.    Allow the nail polish to cure for ~2 min or longer before adding more of the same washing buffer (~100 \u03bcl) and gently agitate on a rocking platform for at least 20 min. The slide is put in a Petri dish with lid closed to reduce evaporation. Before scanning, examine the peel under an optical microscope to verify that epidermal wall indeed separated from the rest of the cell, exposing the inner surface of the wall for direct contact with the AFM tip.  Note: In our experience, peeling of the abaxial epidermis results in separation of the outer (periclinal) cell wall from the rest of the epidermal cell layer. However, this is not always uniform and must be verified by examination of the peel by optical microscopy after the detergent washing step. Cells with serrated edge or teeth-like features are usually torn open and good candidates for AFM imaging (Figure 2). The nucleus and other organelles should be absent. For AFM observations it is not essential that all of the cells split open in this way. Regions of the peel with intact cell walls can be ignored for the AFM imaging. The advantage of the onion scale abaxial epidermis is that it generally peels in this manner quite reproducibly and uniformly. Epidermal layers from other tissues sometimes split open in a similar fashion, others not. This must be determined by trial and error.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171206/20171206195924_9212.jpg Figure 2.

Calibrate the deflection sensitivity (~50-60 nm/V) and spring constant (0.2-0.7 N/m) of the AFM tip with a clean glass slide in fluid, following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The tip radius (~1.8 nm), tip half angle (17.5\u00b0), and sample Poisson\u2019s ratio (estimated as 0.3) need to be entered manually. The values given here are based on the tips that we routinely use (Scanasyst-fluid+ AFM tips) and may differ for other tips.    Throughout the scanning processes, the samples are immersed in imaging buffer (20 mM HEPES buffer [pH 7.0] or 20 mM sodium acetate [pH 4.5], see Recipes).    Start scanning at 2 x 2 \u03bcm size and 512 x 512 sampling rates (thus resolution of ~4 nm/pixel). For high resolution images, scan the sample at 0.5 x 0.5 \u03bcm or smaller. The scanning parameters are not identical for all materials, but typically fall in the following ranges, which are determined empirically: a peak force set point (600 pN-1.5 nN), scan rate (0.4-0.7 Hz), peak force frequency (1 kHz), tip velocity (0.9-1.5 \u00b5m/sec). The gain is auto controlled by the software but the set point and scan rate are typically controlled by the user for consistency throughout imaging (Figure 3).   For standard cell wall imaging, scan at least five different cells from each sample and choose representative images for further analysis.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171206/20171206200000_3660.jpg Figure 3.

Cyanobacteria Cultivation\nCultivate Synechocystis cells in Erlenmeyer flasks or in photobioreactors10,19 in buffered BG11 medium20 to maintain a pH of < 10 (e.g., using 17 mM HEPES10).\n\tNOTE: Standard cultivation conditions require a controlled temperature (typically, 30 \u00b0C, the optimal temperature is 35 \u00b0C)21, illumination (typically, a white light of an intensity up to 800 \u00b5mol[photons]/[m2\u00b7s])21, and a CO2 supply (in the 400-mL flat-panel photobioreactor, the growth saturating CO2 concentration is 1,700 ppm)21.\nTo determine the culture density, measure the culture optical density spectrophotometrically at 730 nm (OD730) using a cuvette with a light path of 1 cm. Alternatively, count the cells under a microscope using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\n2. Samples Preparation\nWork under low irradiance to prevent phycobiliprotein degradation.\nHarvest 3 x 1 mL of culture suspension to safe-lock tubes. Use triplicates for the estimation of technical errors in the measurement. To perform the culture sampling under sterile conditions, harvest the cells in a laminar hood and follow the proper working and safety practices.\nCentrifuge the cells at 15,000 x g at laboratory temperature for 5 min. Pay attention to the properly balanced centrifuge rotor. After centrifugation, discard the supernatants. Be sure not to disturb the pellet.\nPut the samples in a freezer. For long-term storage, keep the samples at -80 \u00b0C. This is necessary to prevent phycobiliprotein degradation. For short-term storage, -20 \u00b0C is sufficient.\nFreeze-dry the samples overnight. For a proper freeze-drying process, keep the temperature of the freeze-dryer condenser below -60 \u00b0C and the pressure in the freeze-dryer chamber around 1 hPa.\nAfter finishing the freeze-drying cycle, close the tube as soon as possible to prevent the reabsorption of water from the air.\n3. Cell Homogenization and Pigments ExtractionAdd four pieces of glass beads (with a diameter of 2 mm) to each sample tube and close the tubes.\n\tNOTE: When the lid of the safe-lock tube used for homogenization is too thin, it can break during the homogenization; therefore, only safe-lock tubes with strong lids are recommended for this protocol.\nHomogenize the samples with the glass beads for 15 s on a homogenizer at laboratory temperature.\n\tNOTE: A properly homogenized sample is spread over the whole inner surface of the safe-lock tubes.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS buffer (pH 7.4), precooled to 4 \u00b0C, to the samples in order to extract phycobiliproteins.\n\tNOTE: From this step on, keep the samples on ice to prevent the degradation of the extracted proteins. This is critical.\nMix the samples with PBS for 5 s on the homogenizer at laboratory temperature.\n\tNOTE: After mixing, the samples are greenish.\nAfter mixing, keep the samples on ice for 60 min. Cover the ice bath with a lid to prevent pigments degradation.\nAfter 60 min of phycobiliprotein extraction, centrifuge the samples at 15,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Pay attention to properly balance the centrifuge rotor.\n\tNOTE: After the centrifugation, the supernatant has a cyan blue color.\n4. Phycobiliprotein Quantification\nBefore the spectrophotometric measurement, calibrate the spectrophotometer to the baseline using the PBS buffer as a blank.\nOnce the spectrophotometer is calibrated, discard the PBS from one spectrophotometer cuvette and pipette the supernatant with extracted phycobiliproteins instead of with the discarded buffer.\nQuantify the phycobiliprotein concentration spectrophotometrically, using a slit width of 0.5 nm.\n\t\nMeasure the absorbance of the phycocyanobilins in phycocyanin and allophycocyanin against the PBS buffer blank at 615 nm (A615) and 652 nm (A652), respectively, and measure the absorbance of the cellular debris at 720 nm (A720).Calculate the concentration of phycocyanin and allophycocyanin according to the equations (1) and (2) of Bennett and Bogorad12:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58076/58076eq1.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58076/58076eq2.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: A615, A652, and A720 should fit to the linear absorbance range of the spectrophotometer. If necessary, dilute the sample with PBS buffer.\nRecalculate the pigment concentration in the original samples. The pigment concentration in the sample corresponds directly with the results of equations (1) and (2) when 1 mL of culture and 1 mL of the extraction buffer are used for the analysis. In case of using different volumes of cyanobacteria samples and/or PBS buffer, the final pigment concentration should be calculated according to equation (3):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58076/58076eq3.jpg\u00a0 \u00a0(3)\n\tNOTE: In case of a normalizing phycobiliprotein content per cell dry weight, the final pigment concentration should be calculated according to equation (4)imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58076/58076eq4.jpg\u00a0 (4)\n5. Determination of the Cell Dry Weight (Optional)\nWeigh three empty safe-lock tubes on analytical balances.\n\tCAUTION: It is critical that the safe-lock tubes are dry. In case of storing the tubes in a wet environment, dry the tubes for several hours in a freeze dryer before weighing them. Manipulate the tubes gently and only with powder-free gloved hands to avoid any contact between the material and the researcher's fingers. Keep all holders and centrifuge clean to avoid the transfer of any material to the tubes.\nSample 1 x 15 mL of culture suspension to 15-mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the culture suspension in the 15-mL conical tubes at 4,000 x g at laboratory temperature for 10 min. Balance the centrifuge rotor with three additional 15-mL conical tubes, each containing 15 mL of water. After centrifugation, discard 12 mL of the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in the remaining supernatant and transfer 3 x 1 mL of the mixture to three 1.5-mL safe-lock tubes with a pipette. In case some leftovers of the pellet remain in the 15-mL conical tube, add 1.5 mL of deionized water to the conical tube, vortex or shake the tube to resuspend the remaining pellet, and transfer 3 x 0.5 mL of the mixture to the three 1.5-mL safe-lock tubes (already containing 3 x 1 mL of the pellet) with a pipette.\n\tNOTE: Dividing the pellet over three 1.5-mL safe-lock tubes will allow the estimation of any technical error of the dry weight measurement.\nCentrifuge the cells in 1.5-mL safe-lock tubes at 15,000 x g at laboratory temperature for 5 min. Balance the centrifuge rotor with an additional 1.5-mL safe-lock tube that contains 1 mL of water. After the centrifugation, discard the supernatants.\nPut the samples in the freezer. For long-term storage, keep the samples at -80 \u00b0C; for short-term storing, -20 \u00b0C is sufficient.\nFreeze-dry the samples overnight. For a proper freeze-drying process, keep the temperature of the freeze dryer condenser below -90 \u00b0C and the pressure in the freeze-dryer chamber around 1 hPa.\nAfter freeze-drying, close the tubes and weigh the samples on analytical balances.\n\tNOTE: The dry weight value can be used for the normalization of the phycobiliprotein content per cell dry weight.\nSubscription Required.

Below we list the steps of processing 3 newborn mouse pups to generate mixed glial cultures in two T-75 flasks. In the mixed culture, astrocytes form a confluent cell layer at the bottom and microglia grow on top of the astrocytic layer. The total amount of primary microglia generated from two T-75 flasks should be enough to seed four 12-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2.Coat two T-75 culture flasks with 7 ml each of 10 \u03bcg/ml PDL for 2 h. Wash the flask bottom with distilled water 3 times before use. Note: You can coat more flasks than needed and the unused coated flasks can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for months. We usually keep the flasks in plastic wrap to avoid contamination. Collect new born pups from breeding cages. Keep the pups on a 37 \u00b0C heating plate to maintain body temperature. In the meantime, prepare tools and reagents needed for the culture experiment. Spray dissection tools and work space with 75% ethanol. Warm up culture medium (No. 16 in \u2018Materials and Reagents\u2019 and No. 1 in \u2018Recipes\u2019) in 37 \u00b0C water bath.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030204248_5275.jpgFigure 1. Process of newborn mouse pups for primary microglial culture. (a) Use fine scissors to cut off the pup head. (b) Use fine scissors to cut open the scalp along the midline from the posterior end to the middle point between the two eyes. (c) When the thin skull was exposed, put one end of the fine forceps beneath the skull but above the brain tissue and pull toward the snout along the midline so that the brain could then be easily scooped out using curving forceps.Remove pups from the heating plate.Decapitate and place the heads into a 6 cm Petri dish containing 5 ml cold dissection media (Figure 1a) (No. 17 in \u2018Materials and Reagents\u2019 and No. 2 in \u2018Recipes\u2019). Use fine scissors to cut open the scalp along the midline starting posteriorly and ending near the snout (Figure 1b). Place one sharp tip of the fine forceps beneath the skull at the posterior end of a brain, and cut the skull by pushing the end from posterior to anterior (Figure 1c). Scoop out the brain using curving forceps and immerse the brains in 5 ml cold dissection media in a new Petri dish. Note: Newborn pups have a transparent and soft skull. Using scissors to cut the skull may damage the fragile brain tissue underneath.Put the Petri dish containing the brains under a dissection microscope. Carefully remove the meninges (readers may refer to the video presented by Bowyer et al., 2012 for this step) and collect the cortices and hippocampi. If you use 3 pups, you will get 6 halves. Put 3 halves per Petri dish with 5 ml dissection media and mince the tissue into small pieces using spring scissors. Transfer the contents of each dish to a 50 ml tube. Wash the dish with dissection media to collect any remaining tissue on the dish and repeat the transfer. Fill the 50 ml tube to reach a final volume of 30 ml dissection media. Add 1.5 ml 2.5% trypsin to each tube and incubate in the 37 \u00b0C water bath for 15 min. Swirl frequently.Add 1.2 ml 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and incubate for 1 min. Add 750 \u03bcl 10 mg/ml DNase to digest the sticky DNA released from dead cells.Centrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min.Aspirate the supernatant and triturate the pellet with 5 ml warm culture media using a 1 ml pipet tip. Transfer the homogenous cell suspension to a 15 ml tube. If undissociated tissue chunks remain, let them settle and repeat the trituration and transfer step using 3 ml media.Centrifuge the 15 ml tubes at 400 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 5 ml warmed culture media. Count the cell density using hemocytometer.Plate each tube of cells into one coated T-75 flask at the density of 50,000 cells/cm2. Add culture media to reach a volume of 15 ml in the flasks. Put seeded flasks into a CO2 cell culture incubator with 5% CO2, 100% humidity at 37 \u00b0C. Change the culture medium the next day to remove cell debris and then change culture media every 5 days.In 5-7 days, astrocytes at the bottom of the flask form a confluent cell layer (Figure 2). Microglia and some oligodendrocytes grow on top of the astrocytic layer. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030204532_7958.jpgFigure 2. Astrocytes form a connective confluent layer at the bottom in the mixed glial culture. Arrows point to representative astrocytes. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcm.To collect microglia, vigorously tap the flasks on the bench top and collect the floating cells in conditioned culture media (No need to change media before tapping). The resulting cells are purified microglia. Use a hemocytometer to count the floating cell density and seed the cells at 50,000 cells/cm2 in PDL-coated culture vessels. After 2 h, check that the microglia have attached to the bottom under a microscope. Aspirate medium and replace with fresh culture medium. The microglial cells are ready to use the next day (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030204634_4471.jpgFigure 3. Purified primary microglial culture. Cells were stained with microglial marker protein Iba1.Phase-contrast image was taken to show the cell body. Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm.", "**Protocol I: Stable expression of \u03c0-EB1 followed by shRNA mediated knockdown of endogenous EB1.** The advantage of this protocol is that \u03c0-EB1 expressing stable cell lines are generated before the endogenous protein is removed. Therefore, the cells never grow in the absence of EB1 function. The disadvantage is that shRNA is never complete, and cell-to-cell variability and remaining protein may add to experimental noise. The \u03c0-EB1 construct has silent mutations that renders it resistant to the shRNA used. We describe the procedure we used for H1299 cells; for other cell types the protocol may need to be adjusted.\nH1299 cells are cultured in RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 1x Pen/Strep, 1x NEAA in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> / 37\u00b0C. Cells are passaged 1:10 when they are 90% confluent \\(every ~4 days). Use cells with a low passage number, and make sure that the cells are actively dividing, and are not contaminated. \n**Day 1: \u03c0-EB1 plasmid transfection.** \u03c0-EB1 is composed of two halves \\(EB1N-LOV2 and EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C), that are expressed from two separate plasmids. Both plasmids are transfected together.\n\u2022 Plate H1299 cells at 20% confluency in a 10 cm dish in 10 ml culture medium. Make sure that the cells are distributed evenly by gently rocking the dish.\n**Day 2:**\n\u2022 Tube 1: Mix 500 \u03bcl Optimem with 15 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000 in a sterile 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Incubate 5 min at room temp.\n\u2022 Tube 2: Mix 500 \u03bcl Optimem with 7.5 \u03bcg of each plasmid encoding EB1N-LOV2 and EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C in a sterile 1.5 ml microfuge tube.\n\u2022 Mix the contents of tube 1 and 2 and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\u2022 Add mixture dropwise to the 10 cm plate with H1299 cells. Gently swirl the dish a few times and place the dish back in the incubator for ~5 hrs.\n\u2022 Aspirate the transfection medium and replace with 10 ml of fresh culture medium and return cells to the incubator.\n**Day 3: Selection of transfected cells.**\n\u2022 Split the transfected cells 1:10 into two new 10 cm dishes\n\u2022 Add 500 \u03bcg/ml G418. Leave the cells for ~1-2 weeks. Replace the medium plus G418 every 3-4 days. \n_Note: Different cell types will likely require optimization of the G418 concentration._\n**Day 10: Pick EGFP positive clones and seed in a 96 well plate.**\n\u2022 Add 25 \u03bcl Trypsin/EDTA per well in a 96-well plate, depending on how many colonies are to be picked. Aspirate medium from the 10 cm dish with \u03c0-EB1 expressing colonies. Add 5 ml PBS.\n\u2022 Identify GFP positive colonies \\(ideally >50 cells) on an inverted tissue culture microscope with epifluorescence. Use a P200 pipette with a yellow tip to scrape the colony from the dish \\(Set the pipette to 100\u03bcl, and push the plunger down before sticking the pipette into the PBS). After scraping the colony, slowly release the plunger to draw up the cells. Transfer the cells to a 96-plate well with trypsin. Leave the cells in trypsin for up to 10 min. Then add 200 \u03bcl of medium to each well. Place the plate in the incubator.\n\u2022 Alternatively: FACS sort single cells that are GFP positive in a 96 well plate. Expand clones until there are enough cells to freeze at least 1 vial of each clone as a backup; a 6 cm dish is sufficient to freeze a vial.\n**Day 18:** \n\u2022 Seed the various clones in 35 mm Mattek glass bottom dishes.**Day 19: Analysis of \u03c0-EB1 clones.**\n\u2022 Analyze clones by Spinning Disk Confocal microscopy to determine the localization of EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C. Select clones in which EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C is clearly localized on growing MT ends. Because the EB1N-LOV2 recruits EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C to MT ends, we can deduce the presence of EB1N-LOV2 from the localization of Zdk1-EB1C. In the absence of the EB1N-LOV2, Zdk1-EB1C will have a predominantly diffuse cytoplasmic localization. One can obtain clones with a close to 1:1 stoichiometry of both halves by visually screening for cells that have a high EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C MT plus-end to cytoplasm ratio.\n\u2022 Discard colonies with low MT plus-end to cytoplasm ratio or colonies with strong MT lattice labelling because expression of both \u03c0-EB1 halves in such colonies is unequal or too high.\n**IMPORTANT:**: When making a stable \u03c0-EB1 cell line expressing EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C, be aware that the blue light used for exciting EGFP, also inactivates \u03c0-EB1 in less than a second. It works well to use the EGFP signal to find cells and focus, but the signal will not appear localized to MT ends. To see EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C on MT plus ends, one has to wait for at least 30 s to allow for \u03c0-EB1 re-association before acquiring an image. The half-life of EGFP-Zdk1-EB1C dissociation from MT ends is ~200 ms, so it is also important to keep the exposure time short to minimize \u03c0-EB1 photo-dissociation during image aquisition. Because blue light excited GFPs cannot be used for live imaging without inactivating \u03c0-EB1, we mostly use it as marker for generating cell lines, and as a control that \u03c0-EB1 photo-dissociation works as expected. For live cell imaging of other proteins \\(e.g. other +TIPs) before or during blue light inactivation we recommend using red fluorescent proteins such as mCherry.\n\u2022 Seed promising clones onto 6 cm dishes at 30% confluency**Day 21: EB1 shRNA lentiviral transduction** \n\u2022 Add 0.5 ml of virus containing supernatant to each of the 6 cm dishes. \u03c0-EB1 expressing cells should be ~80-90% confluent. \n_Note: Make EB1 shRNA lentivirus \\(see Support Protocol 1 below for lentivirus production) while generating the \u03c0-EB1 stable cell line._\n**Day 22:**\n\u2022 Replace medium.\n\u2022 Add 2 \u03bcg/ml puromycin to select for cells expressing the EB1 shRNA. Puromycin works very rapidly, so within 2 days most of the negative cells will die.\n**Day 23-40:**\n\u2022 Expand the surviving cells while under puromycin selection. Analyze clones by microscopy and by immunoblot to confirm shRNA depletion of endogenous EB1 \\(see Support Protocol 2 below for information on how to detect the \u03c0-EB1 halves by immunoblot).\n\u2022 Pick the clones that have an expression level close to endogenous expression levels, and in which both halves of \u03c0-EB1 are present at equal levels. Use these clones for further experimentation.\n__________\n**Protocol II: CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of endogenous EB1 \\(and EB3), followed by stable expression of \u03c0-EB1.** The advantage of this protocol is that endogenous EB1 and EB3 proteins are completely replaced with the light-sensitive \u03c0-EB1 variant. This worked for EB1 and EB3 since we were able to generate viable cell lines that had no remaining EB1/3 expression, but this may not be possible with proteins required for cell viability. In this case, the procedure could be adapted to CRISP/Cas9 knockout a protein of interest in a cell line expressing a \u03c0-variant protein already, in which gRNA target sites are mutated similar to the shRNA strategy described above.Since there are many available CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing protocols, we only describe some of the specific details of the approach we took to knockout our genes of interest. For CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout we used the gRNA/pSpCAS9\\(BB)-2a-GFP \\(Addgene #48138) plasmid described previously<sup>5</sup>. This plasmid contains one cloning site \\(BbsI) for the insertion of a gRNA coding sequence, and allows sorting transfected cells based on Cas9-2a-GFP expression. \nTo knock out EB1 \\(EB3) we targeted exons 1 in both proteins to reduce the chance of expressing truncated proteins \\(even though nonsense-mediated decay mechanisms will degrade most mRNAs with premature stop codons). In our case this was possible because there are only one EB1 and EB3 transcript each. When targeting a gene for which multiple transcripts exist, it is advisable to target the first common exon. gRNAs were identified using the \"Zhang lab website\":http://crispr.mit.edu/ and by scanning the coding sequence for exon 1 of EB1 for gRNA binding sites. We selected three gRNAs targeting different parts of exon 1. We reasoned that expressing multiple gRNAs simultaneously would increase the chance of introducing larger deletions in exon1 which are easier to detect by genomic PCR \\(especially when multiple alleles are present). The six gRNA/pSpCAS9\\(BB)-2a-GFP plasmids containing each of the three gRNAs targeting either EB1 or EB3 will be available on Addgene. An example of our streamlined gRNA cloning strategy that may be useful for cloning other gRNAs is outlined in Support Protocol 3.\n**Day 1:**\n\u2022 Seed H1299 cells at 20% confluency in a 10 cm dish \n**Day 2:** \n\u2022 Transfect the plated H1299 cells with the mixture of three gRNA containing pSpCAS9\\(BB)-2a-GFP plasmids \n\u2022 Tube 1: Mix 500 \u03bcl Optimem with 15 \u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000 in a sterile 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Incubate 5 min at room temperature.\u2022 Tube 2: Mix 500 \u03bcl Optimem with 4 \u03bcg of each of the three gRNA plasmids.\n\u2022 Mix the contents of tube 1 and 2 and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\n\u2022 Add mixture dropwise to the 10 cm plate with H1299 cells. Gently swirl the dish a few times and place the dish back in the incubator for ~5 hrs.\n\u2022 Aspirate the transfection medium and replace with 10ml of fresh culture medium and return cells to the incubator.\n**Day 3 or 4:**\n\u2022 Single cell FACS sort Cas9-2a-GFP positive cells into a 96-well plate.\n_Note: In our hands ~30% of the wells ended up with a colony. Cell sorting should be done within 1 or 2 days after transfection. Waiting longer may increase the probability of selecting clones that stably express the Cas9-2a-GFP._\n\u2022 Also FACS sort a population of Cas9-2a-GFP positive cells for analyzing gene editing efficiency.\n_Note: The more the expression of a protein of interest in this pool of Cas9-2a-GFP transfected cells is reduced, the more likely it is that many of these cells are knockout cells. This should serve as a guide how many individual clones need to be analyzed individually. In the case of EB1 and EB3 approximately 30% of Cas9-2a-GFP positive cells were knockouts._\n**Day 5-20**: \n\u2022 Expand clones until there are enough cells to analyze by genomic PCR, immunoblot or immunofluorescence. See Support Protocols below for more information on how to evaluate clones for EB1 and EB3 expression by genomic PCR and immunoblot. Continue experimenting with at least two homozygous knockout clones, and freeze others as backup.**IMPORTANT:** We have observed that some of the knockout clones continue to express GFP, indicative of stable Cas9 expression. Cas9-2a-GFP should only be expressed transiently to reduce the chances of off-target cleavage, and to prevent Cas9 from cleaving the \u03c0-EB1 rescue constructs \\(which will be transfected in the next step), so clones that remain GFP positive should be discarded.\n**Day 21-40:** \n\u2022 Generate EB1/3 knockout cells that stably express \u03c0-EB1 as described in Protocol I Day 1-19.\n__________\n**Support Protocol 1: EB1 shRNA lentivirus preparation in HEK293FT cells.** \n_Note: Even though this is a 3<sup>rd</sup> generation replication-deficient lentivirus system that has multiple biosafety features, we recommend BSL-2 cell culture procedures.

For H1299 cells, use 0.5 ml for transduction of a 6 cm plate at 80% confluency. Other cell types may require optimization of lentivirus titer.\n__________\n**Support Protocol 2: Immunoblot analysis of \u03c0-EB1 expression.** Analysis of \u03c0-EB1 and EB1/EB3 protein amount by immunoblot is used to determine relative expression levels of both \u03c0-EB1 halves and the expression level of the \u03c0-EB1 relative endogenous EB1 protein in a control extract, and to screen CRISPR/Cas9 knockout clones for the presence or absence of EB1/3.\n**Preparation of cell extracts of \u03c0-EB1, control and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cells:**\n\u2022 Aspirate and discard medium off a confluent 10 cm dish of cells. \n\u2022 Add 5 ml PBS. While cells are in 5ml PBS, scrape cells using a cell scraper, and collect cells in a 15 ml conical tube.\n\u2022 Pellet cells by centrifugation at 1000 RPM for 5 min.\u2022 Aspirate supernatant. Add 0.5 ml lysis buffer \\(20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 0,1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail. _Note: this buffer is not suitable for nuclear proteins)._\n \u2022 Resuspend pellet and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Incubate on ice for 30 min, and resuspend cells every 10 min.\n\u2022 Pellet insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 12000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Keep supernatant.\n\u2022 Measure protein concentration by BCA assay. Add 5x SDS Sample Loading buffer. Heat samples to 95\u00b0C for 5 min. Store extracts at -80\u00b0C.\nFor detecting \u03c0-EB1 and EB1 by immunoblot, perform gel electrophoresis on 10-12% SDS-PAGE gels, and blotting for 1 hr at 60 V by wet transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane \\(i.e. Nitropure, 0.45 micron, Item Number 1212590, GVS North America) using standard protocols.

Spin down the cells at 1000 RPM for 5 min.\n\u2022 Aspirate medium, and keep cell pellet on ice.\n\u2022 Extract genomic DNA using the Purelink genomic DNA Miniprep kit following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n\u2022 Measure the concentration of the DNA using a Nanodrop UV-Vis spectrophotometer. In addition, DNA quality can be checked by running it on a 1% agarose gel \\(degraded DNA will result in smear, while high quality DNA will run as a single band near the top of the gel). Store genomic DNA at -20\u00b0C.\n\u2022 Perform PCR in 50 \u00b5l total volume using 50 ng of genomic DNA template, 0.5 \u00b5l Phusion Polymerase in HF buffer, 200 \u00b5M dNTPs, 4%DMSO, and 0.4 \u00b5M of forward and reverse oligos that span the gene editing site in exon 1: \nEB1forward \\(CTTCCCATGCTTTAGAAGATGGC), EB1reverse \\(CCCTGAACCTCTGTGTGTGGCTTTG) \nEB3forward \\(CCCCAGTGCTGACCTCACCTTTCT), EB3reverse \\(TTCCTTCCAGCAGGGCCACTTCCC)\n\u2022 Use the following PCR cycling parameters: One initial 2 min denaturation step at 95\u00b0C, 35 cycles of 20 s denaturation at 95\u00b0C, 15 s annealing at 62\u00b0C, 15 s extension at 72\u00b0C, followed by a final 5 min extension step at 72\u00b0C.\n\u2022 Prepare a 3% agarose gel with SYBR-safe DNA gel stain or ethidium bromide, and separate the PCR products. Use a 50 bp ladder \\(NEB) to determine the size of the products. Expected size of non-edited PCR products: EB1 \\(241 bp), EB3 \\(207 bp)._Note: In general, pick PCR primers outside the region that is targeted by Cas9 and make sure that the resulting PCR product is small \\(~200 bp) so that even a small deletion \\(Indel) will result in a clear band shift on a 3% agarose gel._\n**Interpretation of the results:** Because multiple gRNAs are used, larger indels may be expected compared with single gRNAs. In many of our knockout clones we observed clear down- or upshifts of the PCR product relative to the control lane. This indicates that in these clones, exon 1 was edited by Cas9 and repaired by non-homologous end-joining \\(NHEJ). In one of the clones three distinct bands were observed that were all downshifted compared with the control band, indicating that at least three EB1 alleles exist in the H1299 cell line \\(consistent with spectral karyotyping results of this cell line<sup>6</sup>. An Indel does not automatically mean that the gene is knocked out, because there could be an in frame deletion or insertion, resulting in a protein with a small insertion/deletion. It is therefore important to either sequence all alleles and/or to verify by immunoblot that the targeted protein is indeed absent.\n__________**Support Protocol 5: \u03c0-EB1 plasmid construction.** For cloning \u03c0-EB1 plasmids we used a modified version of Gibson assembly<sup>7</sup> that omits the ligation step<sup>8</sup>, to assemble various DNA fragments into the target plasmid. We have used this procedure successfully to assemble 3-4 PCR products into a plasmid in a single step with >50% correct colonies. We used this procedure to assemble plasmids containing different versions of the two \u03c0-EB1 halves, and we include our protocols here as guides for the construction of other \u03c0-variant proteins requiring efficient assembly of multiple DNA pieces. Each DNA fragment should have ~25 bp overlap with its neighboring fragments. Primers used for PCR amplification of the individual sequences are typically 59-mers of which around 28 nucleotides are identical to the template. We recommend assembling the final plasmid DNA sequence in silico first, before ordering any oligos, to make sure that the reading frame is correct and there are no unintended stop codons.\n\u2022 Setup a restriction digestion of 5 \u00b5g of the target plasmid in 30 \u00b5l reaction volumes. Incubate for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C \\(unless the enzyme has a different optimal temperature).\n\u2022 Separate DNA fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis \\(~1% agarose for a 5 kb plasmid). \n\u2022 Excise the linearized plasmid from a 1% agarose gel on a UV transilluminator \\(use appropriate eye protection) using a clean razorblade.

After 12\u00a0h of activation, the Listeria monocytogenes was transferred. The OD600 was measured to be 0.35 after 2.5\u00a0h of transfer, and the concentration of Listeria monocytogenes in the bacterial solution was 8.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 CFU/mL. The bacterial injection per mouse was 1.25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 CFU.

Additionally, ensure that it is completely dry before finishing the coating process. Two control samples need to be set up. The first control is the coating plate of liver suspension from uninjected mice to rule out non-specificity and cross-contamination. The second control is the coating plate of the serially diluted suspension of known OVA-Listeria monocytogenes quantity to ensure the quality control of the agar plate.\nPart three: Detection of OVA-specific CD8+ T\u00a0cells in the spleen (on day 7 after infection)\nTiming: 4\u20136 h\nThis section details the detection of OVA-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses in mice.\nPrepare mouse splenocytes.\nRemove the whole spleens from mice.\nCut the whole spleen in half with scissors and place on a 40\u00a0\u03bcm sieve.\nHouse the sieve in a 50\u00a0mL centrifuge tube.

Note: Ensure that the solution is not exposed to light and that the powder is not exposed to light during storage or while making the solution. Rose bengal solution should be made fresh prior to injection. Anesthetic and surgical preparationWeigh animal and record weight.Place a rat in an anesthetic induction chamber.Adjust the oxygen flow rate to 1.5 L/min and adjust isoflurane vaporizer to 3%, gradually increase isoflurane to 5% over 2 min.Once the animal losses righting reflex, stop gas flow to the chamber.Rapidly remove the rat from the induction chamber and place in anesthetic mask or nosecone.Immediately redirect flow to an anesthetic nosecone, reduce oxygen flow rate to 0.3-0.4 L/min, then set nitrogen flowmeter to 0.6-.08 L/min and reduce the isoflurane to 1.5 to 2.0%.Note: We use 1.5-2.0% isoflurane (in 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen) at a flow rate of 1 L/min to maintain anesthetic plane in 500 g rats. Anesthetic and inhaled gas choices are important to consider when inducing stroke as oxygenation and vasoconstriction can alter the size of induced stroke.Ensure the animal is in surgical plane of anesthetic as evident by a loss of reflexes, muscles relaxation and deep rhythmic breathing in accordance with IACUC protocols. Ensure body temperature is maintained at 37 \u00b0C with a rectal temperature probe and a heating pad.Apply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent damage to the cornea, and reapply every 15 min or as needed.Remove hair from the surgical field on the rat scalp from the ears to the eyes by cutting hair at the root right next to the skin with a pair of sterile surgical scissors or fur can be shaven with an electric razor.Prepare skin with Betadine\u00ae surgical scrub.Thin window of the skullMount the animal onto the stereotaxic device (Figure 1A). Start by placing one ear bar in the ear canal and tighten into place, then slide the other ear bar into the ear canal until the head can no longer move from left to right. Tighten the second ear bar into place (Figures 1B and 1C).Note: The ear bars have been placed correctly if the head does not shift left to right. Secure the anterior mount or bite bar in the mouth of the rat. Adjust the bite bar until the head is level. The rat is properly secured in the stereotaxic apparatus then the head does not move in any direction when pressure is applied (Figure 1D).Note: Proper placement of the rat in the stereotaxic frame is essential as drilling and thinning of the skull require that there is no movement of the head.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180516/20180516025638_4693.jpgFigure 1.

Rat mounted in a stereotaxic frame with secured ear bars. C. Proper placement of rat head in stereotaxic frame such that the head is centered in the frame as indicated by red dashed lines. D. Proper adjustment of nosecone and bite bar height to ensure the skull is level as indicated by yellow dashed lines.Focus the surgical area under an animal surgery stereo microscope at 5x.Induce an incision line block with 0.25% Bupivacaine (do not exceed 8 mg/kg).Make a 1 cm incision over the skull midline (Figure 2A), superior to the ear and inferior to the eyes. Expose the skull by retracting each side of the incision away from the midline.Bregma can now be easily located (Figure 2B), if you have difficulty locating bregma gently push on the skull plate and the sutures will become obvious as they shift under mild pressure.Mark the stereotaxic coordinates which overly the preferred forelimb sensory motor cortex (Figure 2C) at the following points relative to bregma (0,0): (1,3), (1,-1), (4,3) and (4,-1)Thin the skull in a rectangle between the marked coordinates (Figures 2D and 2E), 1-4 mm lateral; -1 to +3 mm anterior of bregma, using a surgical drill with endodontic electronic motor system set to a speed of 5,000 rpm fitted with a dental handset fitted and rounded carbide bur drill bit designed for cutting. The skull should be thinned to a thickness of 0.1 mm uniformly over the 3 x 4 mm area. Note: The vasculature underlying the thinned skull should be clearly visible. If you cannot clearly see the underlying vasculature, try adding a drop of sterile saline over the window to clear the window of any particulate generated by the drilling process. If the underlying vascular is not visible after adding a drop of saline, additional thinning is needed, continue thinning the skull until the vascular becomes visible.\u00a0imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180516/20180516025810_0016.jpgFigure 2.

Occlude the vein with non-dominant hand (Figure 3C). Slide the needle into the tail vein with the bevel facing upward and the needle directed parallel to the vein (Figures 3D and 3E).A flash of blood indicates the catheter is in the correct location (Figure 3F).Slide the catheter into the vein and remove the needle (Figure 3G). Ensure there is blood flowing out of the catheter (Figure 3F).Attach needle with rose Bengal. Inject calculated volume (D1) of rose bengal at a rate of 1 ml/min.Flush the catheter with 0.2 ml of sterile saline. Note: Rose bengal can move into the perivascular space following injection leading to ischemia in the tail vein and subsequent necrotic cell death, a saline flush can prevent this complication.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180516/20180516030432_2967.jpgFigure 3.

D. With the bevel facing upward align the catheter needle with tail vein. E. Direct the needle parallel to the vein. F. Insert the needle until a flash of blood is visible in the catheter. G. Remove the needle leaving the catheter in the vein. H. Check to ensure blood flow out of the catheter to ensure correct placement. The catheter is now ready for injection. I.After injection remove catheter. J. Apply pressure to allow a clot to form. K. Ensure that the tail looks healthy and blood flow has returned to the tail tip.Induction of photothrombosisPut on laser safety glasses.Immediately illuminate the thinned skull over the somatosensory cortex using a collimated beam of green laser light (532 nm, 17 mW; ~4.0 mm beam diameter) for 15 min to photoactivate the Rose Bengal (Figures 2F and 2G), occluding all illuminated cortical vasculature and inducing a focal ischemic infarct.Note: The precise size and location of the laser beam placement will determine the size and location of photothrombotic stroke. The laser beam is turned on immediately after the tail vein injection flush (Step D3), for sham surgical animals follow all of the outlined steps but simply do not turn on the laser during the 15 min exposure time period (skip Step E2).Following the 15 min of laser exposer, suture skull and give analgesic care in accordance with IACUC protocols (0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous buprenorphine). Remove tail vein catheter.Give a subcutaneous injection of 3 ml sterile saline to prevent dehydration. After surgery when mobility is regained, observe animal for signs of paralysis and weakness in the forelimb associated with the injured cortex. Note: There should be a clear deficit in the injured limb immediately after the procedure. In most cases, this is evident by the rat avoiding use of the stroke lesioned forepaw by lifting and clenching the injured paw while using only the uninjured forepaw for postural support of body weight.  Transcardial perfusion of ratPrepare perfusion solutions (4% formalin and Saline with heparin) and allow time to reach correct temperature for use (Recipe 2).Note: See Gage et al. (2012) for a detailed protocol on rodent perfusion.Intraperitoneally inject sodium pentobarbital at 150 mg/kg in accordance with the American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines for Euthanasia.Note: For a 500 g rat the volume of Euthasol\u00ae (400 mg/ml sodium pentobarbital) to be injected would be calculated as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180516/20180516031037_7956.jpgExample for 500 g rat: Convert rat weight to kg: 500 g = 0.50 kg. Determine the mass in mg of sodium pentobarbital to inject: 0.500 kg x 150 mg/kg = 75 mg. Determine the volume of Euthasol\u00ae to inject it is sold at (400 mg/ml): 75 mg/400 mg/ml = 0.188 ml.Wait for surgical plane to be reached then secure animal on its back to a perfusion tray set at 85\u00b0 (Figure 4A).Locate the xiphoid process following the xiphoid plane make a transverse incision through the integument and abdominal wall following just beneath the rib cage. Make an incision through the diaphragm using blunt-ended scissors and continue the incision along the entire rib cage exposing the pleural cavity. Make sagittal incisions through both sides of the rib cage, ensuring not to damage the heart or lungs. Lift and pin the rib cage to reveal the coronal chest and release the heart of any attachments to the chest cavity (Figure 4B).Using a hemostat, grip the apex of the heart and insert a blunt ended 16-gauge needle through the left apex, continue insertion into the left ventricle (Figure 4C). Note: It is important to ensure that the needle does not extend past the aortic arch.Make a small incision in the right atria to release fluid pressure and start primed peristaltic perfusion pump at 70-100 ml/min (Figure 4D). Perfuse 250 ml of 37 \u00b0C isotonic saline (Celline) Heparin (5,000 IU/L) solution (Recipe 3) to clear all blood from the animal.Note: The animal should become pale, the liver should be white and only clear fluids should be draining from the right atrial in successful perfusions.Switch perfusion fluid to 4% formalin solution at 4 \u00b0C, again perfuse 250 ml of the solution at a rate of 70-100 ml/min. Note: Fixative tremors should begin to occur throughout the rat within seconds of the 4% formalin solution being infused and the rat should be very stiff by the end of the perfusion.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180516/20180516031413_5924.jpgFigure 4. Transcranial perfusion of rat. A. Rat placed on perfusion tray set at 85\u00b0, dashed lines indicate the location of incisions. B. Surgically exposed coronal chest with heart highlighted. C. Insertion of blunt ended 16-gauge needle through the left apex of the heart. D. Incision into the right atria to release fluid pressure and drain perfusion fluids.Collection of rat brainDecapitate the animal between the cervical spinal cord (C1) and the skull.Create a midline incision spanning the skull and remove all skin to reveal the whole skull.Insert a rongeur into the void where the cervical vertebra has been detached sliding it along the occipital skull.Cut through the occipital skull and pull the bone away from the hindbrain, repeat on the other side.Insert a blunt scissor under the skull along the midline, cutting the skull at the midline. Peel each half of the skull away from the brain.Clip any sharp edges remaining as the brain is now ready to be removed from the open skull cavity.Insert a small scoop between the frontal lobe and olfactory bulbs releasing the brain from the bulbs. Run the scoop under the brain until all connecting tissue blood vessels are cleared and the brain easily slides out of the open skull.Tissue fixing, freezing and cryosectioningImmediately following removal, place the brain in 50 ml of 4% formalin, leave overnight at 4 \u00b0C.After overnight fixation, replace 4% formalin with 4 \u00b0C 50 ml of 30% sucrose solution (Recipe 4) and leave tissue for 3-4 days at 4 \u00b0C until the brain is no longer buoyant in solution.Remove tissue from solution (tissue will be stiff and white in color).Cover the brain with a thin layer of OCT freezing media.Submerge the brain in 2-methylbutane solution chilled to -50 \u00b0C. Leave the brain submerged for 1 min to ensure the brain is frozen throughout. Note: If the whole brain will be stored for an extended time (more than 2 weeks), the brain should be coated in an additional layer of OCT freezing media.The tissue is now ready for long-term storage at -20 \u00b0C or immediate cryosectioning. Note: If planning to section the tissue, we do not recommend storage at -80 \u00b0C, as the tissue must be warmed to -20 \u00b0C for sectioning. We experienced fracturing of tissues and the appearance of freeze-thaw line when we warmed out tissue to optimal sectioning temperature after storage at -80 \u00b0C.A cryostat should be set to a temperature between -19 \u00b0C and -22 \u00b0C, with a cutting thickness of 20 \u03bcm for coronal brain slices.Section the whole brain and mount all slices on glass microscope slides. Note: If Immunochemistry will be performed Superfrost\u00ae Plus Gold slides are recommended as we found slices did not adhere well to uncoated slides even after baking.Slides can now be counterstained or immunolabeled.Microscopy of stroke lesionSelect 10x microscope objective lens on confocal microscope. Note: We use a Leica SP5 Confocal microscope with Leica HCX PL APO L 10x 1.0NA water emersion objective lens and Leica LAS AF Software.The Stroke region can be visualized with a setting for an applied counterstain, immunolabel or in some cases autofluorescence in the FITC emission spectrum can be used to effectively define the stroke borders. In unstained tissue, the stroke border can be determined using the light differential interference contrast or light-DIC setting. Using microscope software set up parameters to collect tile scan images encompassing the whole brain slice (Figure 5A).Collect images of each brain slice spanning the infarct (Figure 5B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180516/20180516032026_8355.jpgFigure 5. Coronal sections spanning the ischemic infarct. A. Coronal sections of rat brain with the lateral coordinates relative to bregma, the infarct area is shown in red. B. The stroke area corresponding to each coronal slice shown in (A) visualized using spectral settings for the FITC emission spectrum on the confocal microscope at 10x magnification. Adapted from Wiersma et al., 2017.Volume analysis of ischemic lesionCortical stoke volume can be determined by analyzing the volume of infarct in each coronal section spanning the ischemic lesion (Figure 5). Import collected images (Procedure I) from each coronal section spanning the stroke imported into ImageJ (Figure 6A). Using the measure function in ImageJ, trace the infarct on each section to determine the specific surface area of the stroke in each slice (Figure 6B). Multiply the surface area by the depth of slice (20 \u03bcm) to determine the lesion volume for each slice (Figure 6C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180516/20180516032206_4422.jpgFigure 6. Example calculation of infarct volume for one coronal section. A. The infarct is clearly visible in the slice visualized using spectral settings for the FITC emission spectrum on the confocal microscope at 10x magnification. B. The area of the infarct to trace in ImageJ is shown by the white dashed line. C.ImageJ calculates the surface area of the infarct as outlined in (B), which is multiplied by the slice thickness to provide the stroke volume in the slice.The infarct volumes for every slice spanning the lesion can be summed to determine the total stroke volume.It is important to predetermine exclusion criteria and remove any animals from the study which do not have a minimum predetermined stroke volume (see Data analysis).Topographical cortical mapping of ischemic infarctCortical maps showing the topographical location of induced stroke are created for each animal by recording the stereotaxic coordinates of stroke boundaries for each coronal slice of tissue spanning the lesion. For each coronal slice spanning the lesion, use a rat atlas to determine the y coordinate of the slice (Figure 7A). Determine the two x coordinates of the stroke boundaries at the established y coordinate (Figure 7A). Plot the coordinates on a grid (Figure 7B).Once all the points are plotted, they can be joined to create an outline of the stroke area (Figure 7C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180516/20180516032343_6417.jpgFigure 7. Finding coordinates for topographic infarct map of the stroke cortex. A. A coronal slice is overlaid on the rat atlas to determine the y coordinates of the stroke, then the x coordinates of the stroke boundary are determined for the slice (red circles). B. The boundary coordinates are transferred onto on to a grid (red circles). This is repeated until all the coordinates are entered and a line can be drawn between points to outline the stroke boundary. C. The grid can then be overlaid on the cortex to demonstrate the stroke location. Adapted from Wiersma et al., 2017.An average topographical map of the stroke area can be created by averaging the stereotactic x coordinates for each y coordinate of the stroke boundaries or the stroke areas can be overlaid to show constancy of infarct size and stereotaxic location.The acceptable location of stroke should be predetermined and animals which have strokes outside of the accepted margins should be removed from the study (see Data analysis).", "Sequential immunofluorescence (IF) and single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH)Note: We follow the sequential IF and smFISH protocol described by the manufacturer of smFISH probes (Biosearch Technologies, Petaluma, CA) with some modifications detailed below.IFNote: Use nuclease-free water for preparing all reagents for the sequential IF and smFISH experiment to limit potential RNA degradation.  Place a 12-mm circular coverslip to each well of a 24-well plate. Seed about 5 x 104 cells to each well. Allow cells to attach onto the coverslips.When the cells reach 75-90% confluency in each well (12-18 h for most human cultured cells), fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) for 10 min at room temperature (RT), followed by two quick washes with 1x PBS.Note: To perform quick washes, gently transfer 1 ml of PBS to each well and then aspirate the solution immediately. Permeabilize cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS for 5 min at RT, followed by one quick wash with 1x PBS.Incubate cells (on a 12-mm circular coverslip) with 70 \u00b5l of primary antibody solution for 3 h at RT (e.g., 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-PCNT antibody in 1x PBS in our example).Perform three 5-min washes with 1x PBS and incubate the cells with 70 \u00b5l of secondary antibody solution overnight in the dark at 4 \u00b0C (e.g., 1:500 diluted anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488). Note: The dilution factor and incubation time of the primary and secondary antibodies need to be empirically determined; the sample condition described is for detecting PCNT proteins. To perform 5-min washes, gently transfer the coverslip to a well in a 24-well plate containing 1 ml of 1x PBS. Incubate for 5 min at RT without shaking the plate. Perform three 5-min washes with 1x PBS and post-fix cells with 3.7% formaldehyde in 1x PBS for 10 min at RT.smFISHWash cells with Wash Buffer A for 5 min and incubate with 67 \u00b5l of Hybridization Buffer containing 125 nM smFISH DNA probe mix for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C in the dark.Note: We use the online Stellaris Probe Designer from Biosearch Technologies to design the FISH probes. We generally use a set of 48 to 96 20-mer DNA probes for each RNA target. For best results, add 10% formamide into 1x Wash Buffer A and Hybridization Buffer immediately before use.Incubate cells with Wash Buffer A for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, Wash Buffer A containing 0.05 \u00b5g/ml DAPI for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, and Wash Buffer B for 3 min at RT.Mount the coverslip with enough Prolong Gold antifade mountant (e.g., 5 \u00b5l for a 12-mm circular coverslip). Let the mountant cure overnight in the dark at RT and seal the edge of the coverslip with nail polish before imaging.\u00a0Note: For the best results, perform the incubations of antibody and smFISH probes in a humidified container (e.g., a 15-cm Petri dish with a piece of parafilm and wet paper towel inside, wrapped with aluminum foil to block light). Image acquisition and deconvolutionImaging Note: When using multiple fluorophores, it is important to carefully select the wavelength ranges, emission filters, and dichroic mirrors to avoid signal bleed-through. Use settings to minimize photobleaching but also maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. A camera with high sensitivity is preferred to obtain good smFISH signals (e.g., an electron multiplying CCD camera). We recommend acquiring images sequentially, channel by channel, starting from the longest wavelength. Below are the general IF and smFISH acquisition settings using the Dragonfly spinning confocal system in the Jao lab.Objective: 100x NA 1.4 (as well as placing a 1.5x or 2x magnification lens before the camera)Laser power: between 5-30% of 50-100 mW lasersExposure time: 100-250 msGain: 200 for iXon Ultra 888 EMCCD cameraPinhole: 40 \u00b5mZ-stack interval: 0.3 \u00b5mFor assessing colocalization between different fluorescent signals, acquire all channels for each z-stack.Deconvolution Note: It is important to avoid potential artifacts introduced during the deconvolution process by comparing the pre- and post-deconvolved images. In general, the higher the number of iterations, the more likely image artifacts will be produced. Below are our typical deconvolution settings using the built-in deconvolution algorithm in the Fusion software of the Dragonfly system.Deconvolution preview mode: ONAlgorithm: Robust (Iterative)Pre-sharpening: OFFEdge artifact reduction: noneDenoising filter size: 0.7Denoising frequency: 4Number of iterations: 15Minimum intensity removal: ONInitial denoising: ONNormalization: OFFIteration acceleration: OFF", "1. Prepare the Optical Bench and the Capillary for FPOP\nCAUTION: KrF excimer lasers are extreme eye hazards, and direct or reflected light can cause permanent eye damage. Always wear appropriate eye protection, avoid the presence of any reflective objects near the beam path when possible, and use engineering controls to prevent unauthorized access to an active laser and to restrain any stray reflections.\nPrepare the FPOP optical bench.\n\t\nTurn on the laser to warm up. Set the laser to External Trigger, Constant Energy, No Gas Replacement. Set the laser energy per pulse (typically between 80-120 mJ/pulse).\nSet up the optical bench with the plano-convex lens (30 mm Dia. x 120 mm FL uncoated) directly in the path of the laser beam and a non-reflective backstop to absorb the light as shown in Figure 3A.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61580/61580fig03.jpgFigure 3: Optical bench for the FPOP experiment.\u00a0(A) The sample is mixed with H2O2, adenine radical dosimeter, and glutamine scavenger and loaded into the syringe. The sample is pushed through the fused silica capillary through the focused beam path of a KrF excimer UV laser. The UV light photolyzes H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals, which oxidizes the protein and adenine dosimeter. The syringe flow pushes the illuminated sample out of the path of the laser before the next laser pulse, with an unilluminated exclusion volume between illuminated regions. Immediately after oxidation, the sample is passed through an inline UV spectrophotometer, which measures the UV absorbance of adenine at 265 nm. The sample is then deposited into a quench buffer to eliminate the remaining H2O2 and secondary oxidants. (B) The spot size is measured after irradiating a colored sticky note affixed behind the capillary with the laser at 248 nm. The width of the spot is used for calculating the sample flow rate, and the silhouette of the capillary in the center of the spot is used to align the optical bench. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61580/61580fig03large.jpg]\nCut an appropriate length of the fused silica capillary\u00a0(360 \u00b5m outer diameter and 100 \u00b5m inner diameter) and using a sleeve, connect to the gas-tight syringe using a low dead volume connector.\nGently burn the polyimide coating of the capillary with a butane torch at the place where the inline dosimeter reads the absorbance signal at 265 nm after laser exposure of the samples. Wipe the debris on the capillary gently using methanol on a lint-free wipe. The polyimide coating at the site of laser incidence can either be similarly burned off with the butane torch or burned off with the excimer laser firing at low power.NOTE: Wait for the capillary to cool as it is a fire hazard to use the methanol on the hot capillary.\nPlace this capillary through the beam path of the laser and into the inline dosimeter.\n\t\nPress the lever on the top of the inline dosimeter to open the hinge. Remove the magnetic holders. Place the capillary in the machined groove of the inline dosimeter, using the magnetic holders to keep the capillary in place. Close the dosimeter hinge over the capillary, pressing it until the lever locks in place.\nUsing the dosimetry software, click on the Start Flash button to begin firing the excimer laser. Set the preset laser power between 50-100 mJ/pulse on the laser control software itself, and set the preset repetition rate between 10-20 Hz in the Settings tab of the dosimetry software.\n\t\nFocus the laser beam using a plano convex lens mounted on a linear motorized stage. Measure the width and the height of the laser spot at the position of the capillary on a sticky note precisely using a caliper to calculate incident fluence (mJ/mm2) as shown in Figure 3B.\nPlace an opaque aperture near the capillary to ensure consistent illuminated width of the capillary regardless of changes in the beam size due to movement of the lens or changing the energy per pulse of the laser18.\n\t\nWith the laser firing, move the motorized stage through its range of motion. Ensure that the beam stays centered on the aperture and the silhouette of the capillary can be observed throughout. The diameter of the aperture must be smaller than the width of the impinging focused beam at every point in the range of the motorized stage.\nRun water through the capillary at 20 \u00b5L/min for at least one minute to wash the capillary.Click the Start Data + AutoZero button on the dosimeter software to zero the dosimeter to water and begin data collection.\n\t\tNOTE: If the buffer system for FPOP has significant UV absorbance at 265 nm, the FPOP system should be zeroed on the buffer, not water.\nSet the calculated flow rate on the syringe pump.\n\t\nThe flow rate of the protein sample depends on the irradiated volume per shot (VIrr), the number of laser shots per second (R), and the desired unirradiated exclusion volume fraction (FEx) to correct for laminar flow effects and sample diffusion (0.15-0.30 recommended)2,19,20. Calculate the VIrr (in \u00b5L) based on the inner diameter of the capillary in mm (d) and the width of the laser spot impinging upon the capillary (i.e., the width of the aperture) in mm (w) using the following equation:\nVIrr = \u03c0(d/2)2w\nCalculate the desired flow rate (in \u00b5L/min) based on the following equation:\nFlow = 60R[VIrr (1 + FEx)]\n2. Preparation of the protein solution for FPOP\nPrepare the protein in the two or more different conditions to be compared (e.g., ligand-bound and ligand-free; aggregate and monomer; alone and with a protein-protein binding partner; etc.) for detecting the conformation changes.Set the total volume used for FPOP to fit the needs of the experiment. The minimum limit usually depends on the volume of the irradiation capillary and the material required for robust detection and relative quantification, and will vary depending largely on the LC-MS/MS system used and the post-labeling sample processing method. The total volume for FPOP solutions commonly used in our group is 20 \u00b5L after the addition of hydrogen peroxide. The final concentration of the protein is commonly 1-10 \u00b5M, with 17 mM glutamine (to limit the lifetime of the hydroxyl radical), 1 mM adenine (to act as a radical dosimeter)13,17 and 10 mM phosphate buffer (a buffer that is a poor scavenger of hydroxyl radicals). Samples are generally prepared with multiple replicates to allow for statistical modeling of results.\n\t\nFor most general purposes, prepare samples in triplicate in both states, plus at least one sample to use as a no-laser control to measure background oxidation. Prepare 18 \u00b5L of this FPOP solution mix.\n\t\tNOTE: Many buffers and additives commonly used in biochemistry are hydroxyl radical scavengers. These additives and buffers can be used; however, reductions in oxidation due to hydroxyl radical scavenging of the buffer can occur. In general, keep all additives to the minimum required by the biological system to maximize protein oxidation yield. Dimethyl sulfoxide should be avoided due to the propensity to generate secondary radicals; dimethylformamide has been a useful alternative in our hands. When using buffers that are strong hydroxyl radical scavengers, glutamine can often be excluded from the FPOP solution mix.\nPrepare 1 M hydrogen peroxide immediately before the FPOP experiment.NOTE: 30% hydrogen peroxide as commonly sold by vendors includes a stabilizer, which increases the shelf life. Once diluted, hydrogen peroxide should be used quickly, definitely within the same day. Hydrogen peroxide should also be regularly tested for decomposition by FPOP using a hydroxyl radical dosimeter.\nPrepare microcentrifuge tubes containing 25 \u00b5L of quench solution of 0.5 \u00b5g/\u00b5L of methionine amide and 0.5 \u00b5g/\u00b5L catalase. If a sample volume greater than 20 \u00b5L is used for FPOP, increase the quench solution volume proportionally.\n3. Perform the FPOP experiment\nAdd 2 \u00b5L of hydrogen peroxide in the 18 \u00b5L of the FPOP solution mix. Mix the contents gently with a pipette and quickly spin down the solution to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes. Immediately collect with a gastight syringe and load into the syringe pump.\nStart the flow on the syringe pump with the flow rate as determined in step 1.8.1 (typically between 8-16 \u00b5L/min) by clicking the Start Pump button on the dosimeter software.\nMonitor the real-time adenine reading using the inline dosimeter (see Table of Materials) and collect the sample in waste. Wait for the Abs265 signal to stabilize.\nClick on the Start Flash button in the dosimeter software to start firing the laser at the preset repetition rate and energy.\nMonitor the real-time adenine reading using an inline dosimeter (see Table of Materials); the difference in Abs265 with the laser off and the laser on is the \u0394Abs265 reading.\n\tNOTE: The appearance of highly unstable Abs265 readings upon firing the laser in the presence of hydrogen peroxide is due to the generation of bubbles in solution. Reduce the fluence of the laser and/or the concentration of hydrogen peroxide to eliminate the bubbles.\n4. Perform CompensationNOTE: Different ligands, buffers, etc. may have different scavenging capacity towards hydroxyl radicals. It is important to ensure that comparable effective hydroxyl radical doses are available to react with protein\u00a0across different samples. This is accomplished by ensuring equal hydroxyl radical dosimeter response between samples. Using adenine dosimetry, the change in UV absorbance at 265 nm (\u0394Abs265) reflects the effective hydroxyl radical dose; the larger the \u0394Abs265, the higher the effective hydroxyl radical dose.\nCompare the \u0394Abs265 reading obtained with the inline dosimeter with the desired \u0394Abs265 reading obtained by prior experiments or controls. A \u0394Abs265 reading lower than the desired reading indicates an insufficient effective dose of hydroxyl radicals; a \u0394Abs265 reading indicates an effective radical dose that is too high. If the \u0394Abs265 reading is at the desired level, collect the sample immediately after laser irradiation in the quench buffer17.\nCompensate the effective radical dose to equalize the \u0394Abs265. This compensation can be performed in three ways: change hydrogen peroxide concentration, increase laser fluence by changing the laser energy per pulse, or increase laser fluence by changing the focal plane of the focusing lens.\n\t\nTo make a large change (>10 mAU) in \u0394Abs265 reading, remake the sample with more or less hydrogen peroxide and rerun the sample as per Section 3.\nTo make a small change in \u0394Abs265 reading in real-time, adjust the focal plane of the incident beam by adjusting the position of the focusing lens using the 50 mm Motorized Stage. Bringing the focal plane closer to the position of the capillary will increase the \u0394Abs265 reading; bringing the focal plane farther from the position of the capillary will decrease the \u0394Abs265 reading.Monitor the adenine \u0394Abs265 to measure the effective amount of hydroxyl radical present in the sample after laser irradiation13. Real-time monitoring with an inline UV capillary detector allows for real-time compensation as described in 4.2.2; adjust the lens position using the motorized stage until the \u0394Abs265 reading is equal to the desired reading. Post-experimental absorbance measurements with a UV spectrophotometer are also accurate, but require new samples to be used for each effective radical dose.\n5. Digest the protein samples\nNOTE: Trypsin is most commonly used to digest protein samples for FPOP, and is the protease used in this protocol. It is a reliable protease that generates peptides with basic sites both at the N- and C-terminus, promoting multiply charged peptide ions in MS. Moreover, it cleaves after lysine and arginine, two amino acids that are only moderately reactive to hydroxyl radicals; therefore, changes in the digestion pattern due to analyte oxidation is rare. Other proteases have been successfully used with FPOP21, but care should be taken to ensure digestion patterns are comparable between unoxidized and oxidized samples.\nMeasure the final volume of quenched FPOP sample. Add 500 mM Tris, pH 8.0 with 10 mM CaCl2 containing 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to the protein solution after quenching to a final concentration of 50 mM Tris, 1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM DTT.\nHeat the protein sample at 95 \u00b0C for 15 minutes.\nImmediately cool the sample on ice for 2 min.\nAdd the 1:20 trypsin/protein weight ratio to the samples.\nDigest the protein overnight at 37 \u00b0C with mixing.\nStop the digestion reaction by the addition of 0.1% formic acid and/or heating the sample to 95 \u00b0C for 10 min.\nAdd 2 mM DTT to the samples and heat at 60 \u00b0C for 15 min immediately before LC-MS/MS.NOTE: While other groups have reported alkylation of thiols in FPOP experiments, in our hands we have noted side products upon alkylation of oxidized proteins (possibly due to reaction with nucleophilic carbonyls formed as a minor oxidation product). Therefore, we choose to avoid alkylation of thiols when possible.\n6. Perform liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)\nPrepare the mobile phase A consisting of water containing 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B consisting of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.\nLoad the sample first onto a C18 trap column (300 \u00b5m I.D. x 5 mm 100 \u00c5 pore size, 5 \u00b5m particle size) trapping cartridge and wash with 2% solvent B for 3 minutes at a flow rate of 5.0 \u00b5L/min to remove salts and hydrophilic small molecules.\nThen separate the peptides on C18 nanocolumn (0.75 mm x 150 mm, 2 \u00b5m particle size, 100 \u00c5 pore size) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The gradient consists of a linear increase from 2 to 35% solvent B over 22 min, ramped to 95% solvent B over 5 min and held for 3 min to wash the column, and then returned to 2% B over 3 min and held for 9 min to re-equilibrate the column.\n\tNOTE: This gradient is sufficient for LC-MS/MS of most one- and two-protein FPOP mixtures seeking to do peptide-level quantification. The percent of solvent B may need to be altered to increase peptide resolution in rare cases where peptides interfere with one another due to similar retention times and m/z values. Proteome-scale FPOP22 or experimental designs seeking to separate peptide oxidation product isomers1,23,24,25 may require longer LC gradients and are beyond the scope of this report.\nElute the peptides directly into the nanospray source of a high-resolution mass spectrometer using a conductive nanospray emitter.Acquire the data in positive ion mode. Set the spray voltage to 2400 V, and the temperature of the ion transfer tube to 300 \u00b0C.\nAcquire the full MS scans from m/z 250 to 2000 at a nominal resolution at m/z 200 of 60,000 followed by eight subsequent data-dependent linear ion trap MS/MS scans on the top eight most abundant peptide ions using collision-induced dissociation at 35% normalized energy to identify the peptides. Fragment the peptides up to five times within 30 s and then transfer to an exclusion list for 60 s.\n7. Data processing and calculation of average oxidation of peptides\nDetermine the sequence coverage of the protein, m/z values, and retention times of unoxidized peptides using the MS/MS proteomics search engine.\nSet the precursor mass tolerance to 10 ppm and allow up to two missed cleavage sites for the trypsin digested samples, using standard trypsin cleavage specificity.\nSet the peptide mass fragment mass tolerance to 0.4 Daltons.\nBased on the m/z ratio of the unmodified peptides detected and the known mass shifts of the major oxidation products, calculate the m/z of the various theoretical oxidation products of each peptide4,26,27,28,29.Identify the extracted ion chromatogram of these m/z values using software to view the mass spectrometric run (Figure 4). Identify the peptide oxidation products based on their m/z, their charge state, and the similarity in elution time to the unmodified peptide. In our hands, peptide oxidation products elute between 240 seconds before to 180 seconds after the unmodified peptide using the LC gradient above. As oxidation will often result in multiple isomeric oxidation products, it is common to observe multiple partially resolved peaks in the extracted ion chromatograms of peptide oxidation products, as shown in Figure 4. Peptide oxidation products are quantified based on the area of the peak(s) in the extracted ion chromatograms.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61580/61580fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Extracted ion chromatogram of a peptide and its oxidation products after FPOP.\u00a0The m/z of the peptide oxidation products are calculated based on the m/z of the unoxidized peptide and the known oxidation products; and the areas of these peptide products are determined. The area of the peptide products is then used for the calculation of the average oxidation events per peptide. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61580/61580fig04large.jpg]\nCalculate the average oxidation of the peptides using the following equation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61580/61580equ01v2.jpg\nwhere P denotes the average number of oxidation events per peptide molecule, and I represents the peak area of the unoxidized peptide (Iunoxidized) and the peptide with n oxidation events. Note that I(singly oxidized) would include not only additions of a single oxygen atom but also other less-common single oxidation events that the investigator may choose to measure (e.g., oxidative decarboxylation, carbonyl formation, etc.)4,26,27,28,29.Subscription Required.

Sonicate in ethanol then in 1 M potassium hydroxide for 30 min for 3x. Wash in acetone 3x then decant.\nSilanization\nPrepare a solution of 2.8% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in acetone. Seal the APTES bottle with a paraffin film and store at 4 \u00b0C.\n\t\tNOTE: Use safety goggles and work under a fume hood. The container of the silane solution should be completely dry and rinsed by acetone immediately before and after pouring the silane solution into the jar.\nPour 70 mL of the 2.8% APTES solution into the Coplin jar containing the coverslips. Shake the jar for 4 min in an orbital shaker.\nLet the jar stand on the bench for 5 min, sonicate for 1 min, and finally keep the jar on the bench for another 10 min for the silane to react with the hydroxyl groups on the glass surface.\nQuench the reaction by the addition of 1 L of deionized water by pouring water directly into the jar for rapid solvent exchange. Rinse the slides 3x in water by sideways shaking of the jar on a flat surface.\nTake the coverslips out of the jar and place them onto an aluminum foil tray. Bake the coverslips in an oven at 110 \u00b0C for 30 min to dry the coverslips and cure the silane. Leave the tray on the bench for the coverslips to cool down to room temperature.\nPEGylation\nWarm up the biotinylated PEG and PEG, stored at -20 \u00b0C to room temperature (RT) to prevent the condensation of moisture upon opening the container.Place five coverslips with the silanized surface facing up on a box. Place two cover glass slips (22 mm x 22 mm) as spacers along the edges of the silanized coverslips.\nOnce warmed up, make biotinylated PEG and PEG solutions at a ratio of ~1:100 in 1 mL of fresh, 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate solution by adding 1.5 mg of biotinylated PEG and 150 mg of PEG into a 1.5 mL tube.\nVortex the tube to dissolve PEG and spin down to remove air bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: Going forward from this step, be quick, because PEG hydrolyzes in solution within a timescale of min.\nQuickly apply 100 \u00b5L of the PEG solution to each coverslip. Take another baked coverslip and place its upper silanized surface face-down on top of the coverslip with the PEG solution, hence forming a glass-solution-glass sandwich in which the 22 mm x 22 mm non-silanized coverslips allow the two functionalized coverslips to be separated easily.\nIncubate the coverslips overnight (16 h) in the dark and at RT. Once the incubation is complete, take the coverslips apart, then rinse 10x using deionized water by washing from the side with a squirt bottle.\nDry the coverslips under a flow of dry nitrogen. Store the dry coverslips under vacuum.\n\t\tNOTE: The slides can be used for 1 month without degradation of quality.\n2. Preparation of flow cell\nSingle-channel flow cell\nDrill two holes with 1.22 mm diameter in the middle part of a quartz slide (50 mm x 20 mm) with the centers situated 37 mm apart and 6.5 mm from the edge of the slide (Figure 1A).\nCut out a 41 mm x 2.25 mm channel into a 50 mm x 20 mm piece of a double-adhesive sheet using an electronic cutter.Peel off the plastic side of the protective cover and align the edges of the piece with the edges of the quartz slide. Remove trapped air bubbles by pressing gently with a pair of polytetrafluoroethylene tweezers.\nPeel off the paper side of the adhesive piece. Mount the piece onto the functionalized surface of the coverslip.\nCut polyethylene tubing (I.D. 1.22 mm) into a length of 11 cm for the inlet and 25 cm for the outlet. Insert the tube into the previously drilled holes as inlet and outlet for the flow cell.\nUse 5 min epoxy glue to seal around the edges of the quartz-coverslip interface and around the tubes for the inlet and outlet.\nUse the flow cell immediately once it dries or store under dry vacuum for later use.\nDissolve avidin in PBS to a concentration of 0.03 mg/mL. Filter through 0.2 \u00b5m syringe filter.\nFlow avidin into the flow cell using a 1 mL syringe. Use another syringe filled with buffer to wash out excess avidin. Be careful not to introduce air bubbles while exchanging the syringes.\nMultiple-channel flow cell\nDrill six holes with a diameter of 1.22 mm on each of the long sides of a quartz slide (76 mm x 25 mm) (Figure 1B). Make the holes 4.5 mm from the edge of the slide and 9.3 mm apart. Ensure the distance between the centers of each hole pair is 15 mm.\nCut out six channels (20 mm x 2.25 mm) into a 76 mm x 25 mm piece of double-adhesive tape using the electronic cutter.\nPeel off the plastic side of the protective cover and align the edges of the adhesive piece with the edges of the quartz slide. Remove any trapped air bubbles by gentle pressing using a pair of polytetrafluoroethylene tweezers.Peel off the paper side of the adhesive piece and mount onto the functionalized surface of the coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: Sometimes peeling off the paper side and attaching to the quartz slide works well in the multichannel flow cell.\nCut the inlet tubes (11 cm) and outlet tubes (25 cm) for the six channels. Prepare the flow cell as described in steps 2.1.6\u20132.1.9.\nConnect the outlet of the first channel to the pump. Place the inlet into 0.5 mL tube with OSS.\n\t\tNOTE: The length of the inlet tube is chosen to maximize the number of events in the cleavage experiments performed under continuous flow by synchronizing time of enzyme entrance into the flow cell and start of imaging thus decreasing premature photobleaching of the fluorophores.\nMove to a new channel by disconnecting the outlet of the used channel. Close the outlet with a plug made from a syringe needle sealed with glue in the plastic part. Close the inlet of the used channel.\n3. Preparation of oxygen scavenging system (OSS)\nDissolve 0.2 g of (\u00b1)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (triplet state quencher which minimizes blinking of the fluorophores) in 800 \u00b5L of methanol.\nAdd 6 mL of deionized H2O and add 1 N NaOH dropwise until it dissolves. Filter through a syringe filter, make into 1 mL aliquots, and store at -80 \u00b0C. The stock concentration is ~100 \u00b5M.\nPrepare a fresh solution of 3,4-dihroxybenzoic acid (PCA) by dissolving 61 mg of PCA powder in 4 mL of ddH2O. The stock concentration is ~100 nM.\nAdd 58 \u00b5L of 10 N NaOH dropwise, making sure to vortex after each drop until PCA is fully dissolved (pH = 9).Dissolve 5.3 mg of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-PCD) in 7 mL of PCD storage buffer (Table 1). 3,4-PCD removes oxygen from the binding/cleavage buffers by catalyzing the oxidation of protocatechuic acid34.\nDivide the PCD solution into 1 mL aliquots. The stock concentration is ~1 \u00b5M. Snap-freeze the aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 \u00b0C for long-term storage or at -20 \u00b0C for short-term storage.\nPrepare a fresh binding buffer (Table 1). Substitute 2 mM CaCl2 with 2 mM MgCl2 for smFRET cleavage experiments.\nPrepare 1 mL of the imaging buffer (Table 1). Keep the imaging buffer on ice until it is introduced into the flow cell to maintain the activity of the oxygen scavenging system.\n4. Preparation of fluorescently labeled HJs\nReconstitute the lyophilized oligos (Table 2) in Tris-EDTA buffer (Table 1) to a concentration of 100 \u00b5M.\nPrepare the synthetic junction by mixing equimolar portions ~3 \u00b5L of each of the X0 oligos listed in Table 1.\nAnneal by heating at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to RT at a rate of 1 \u00b0C/min. Use either a heat block or PCR thermocycler to achieve the desired cooling rate.\nLoad the mixture on 8 cm x 8 cm of 10% Tris-borate-EDTA polyacrylamide gel. Apply 100 V and run the gel for ~2 h. The bands are clearly seen by eye, and their color is purple.\nExcise the band of the annealed substrate with a clean blade. Transfer the gel piece into an autoclaved 1.5 mL tube.\nCrush the gel piece inside the tube with a clean plunger then add 100 \u00b5L of TE100 buffer (Table 1).\nExtract the HJ by shaking the tube at 20 \u00b0C at 1,500 rpm in a thermomixer for ~2 h or incubate overnight at 4 \u00b0C.Perform ethanol precipitation on the solution containing the substrate35.\nResuspend the substrate in 20 \u00b5L of TE100 buffer (Table 1). The final concentration is 1\u20133 \u00b5M. Aliquot 2 \u00b5L in each tube and store at -20 \u00b0C.\n5. Protein expression and purification of GEN1\nConstruct the plasmid for the expression of truncated human GEN11,2,3,4,5 with hexa histidine-tag at the C-terminus20 by PCR of the entry vector.\n\tNOTE: N-terminal tagging would result in the inactivation of GEN1. The unstructured C-tail renders the purification of the full length GEN1 significantly harder. Also, the full length GEN1 was reported to exhibit less activity than truncated version23.\nTransform the expression vector into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL strain.\nInoculate the transformed cells into two 6 L flasks each containing 2 L of Luria broth media at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm until an OD600 of 0.8 is reached.\nCool down the culture to 16 \u00b0C and induce GEN1 expression with 0.1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 48 h.\nHarvest the cells by spinning them down at 4 \u00b0C at 1000 x g in a centrifuge. Each liter of culture yields 5\u20136 g of the pellet.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted cells in lysis buffer (Table 1) using 4 mL/g of cells.\nPerform cell lysis using a cell disruptor at 30 kPsi then spin down at 10,000 x g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Collect the supernatant and filter it on ice using 0.45 \u00b5m filters.\nPerform protein purification using FPLC by passing the filtrate through a 5 mL Ni-NTA column at 2.5 ml/min flow rate using Buffer A (Table 1).Wash with 15 column volumes (CV). Elute with a linear gradient of Buffer A and 500 mM Imidazole over 20 CV in 5 mL fractions. GEN1 elutes from the column at around 100 mM Imidazole.\nPipette 10 \u00b5L aliquots from the collected fractions, add equal volume of 2x SDS loading dye to each aliquot. Denature the samples by heating at 90 \u00b0C for 5 min, cool, and spin down the samples.\nLoad the samples onto 10% Bis-Tris gel. Run the gel for 30\u201345 min at 200 V. Stain using Coomassie Brilliant Blue, then destain. Collect the fractions that contain purified GEN1.\nReduce the salt concentration of the combined fractions to 100 mM by dilution using buffer C (Table 1).\nPass the low salt protein through a 5 mL heparin column at a flow rate of 3 mL/min using Buffer B (Table 1).\nWash with 10 CV. Elute using a gradient of 20 CV with Buffer B and 1 M NaCl. Collect 5 mL fractions in which GEN1 elutes around 360 mM NaCl.\nCheck the eluted fractions for purified GEN1 fractions as described in step 5.8. Combine those fractions and dilute to 100 mM NaCl using Buffer C.\nLoad the lower salt protein onto a cation exchange column at 1 mL/min flow rate using Buffer B.\nElute by a gradient of 40 CV using Buffer B and 1 M NaCl. Collect 1.7 mL fractions in which GEN1 elutes around 300 mM NaCl.\nCheck for the purity of GEN1 in the eluted fractions as described in step 5.8.\nCombine the purest fractions and dialyze at 4 \u00b0C against storage buffer (Table 1). Perform at least one exchange of the buffer during dialysis.Measure the protein concentration ~0.5\u20131 mg/mL. Aliquot the dialyzed protein in 10\u201315 \u00b5L volumes in small tubes, flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 \u00b0C.\n6. Single-molecule FRET experiments\nNOTE: The smFRET experiments are performed on a custom-built objective based TIRF set-up (Figure 1C) described previously31.\nSingle-color FRET experiments\nApply one drop of immersion oil onto the 100x TIRF objective. Set the EMCCD to suitable gain to optimize the signal to background and prevent saturation.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not look directly into the laser beam and wear protective goggles when aligning the laser.\nPlace the flow cell carefully on the sample holder. Gradually raise the objective using coarse adjustment until the oil touches the coverslip.\nTurn on the green laser (532 nm). Switch to fine adjustment mode of the objective. Direct the emission to the camera port to observe the image on the monitor.\nAdjust the height of the objective until the functionalized surface of the coverslip is brought in focus and can be observed on the monitor.\n\t\tNOTE: The image acquisition by EMCCD triggers the laser excitation via the acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) to prevent sample photobleaching when images are not being acquired.\nCheck that the background from the functionalized surface of the coverslips does not exceed few spots before flowing in the fluorescently labeled HJ.\nDilute the stock substrate approximately 1000 times in TE100 buffer (Table 1) to a final concentration of 1\u20135 nM. Pipette 0.2\u20130.5 \u00b5L of the diluted substrate into 120 \u00b5L of the imaging buffer with OSS into a 0.5 mL tube.\nConnect the outlet of the flow cell to the syringe pump. Insert the inlet tube of the flow cell into 1.5 mL tube and operate the syringe pump at a flow rate of 30\u201350 \u00b5L/min to withdraw the solution from the tube.Frequently check the surface for good coverage (100\u2013300 of homogenously distributed, well-spaced substrate) by imaging briefly with the green laser.\nIf the surface coverage is still not enough either wait for few minutes for the fluorescently labeled HJ from the solution to settle onto the surface or repeat the flowing step.\nFlow another 120 \u00b5L of imaging buffer (Table 1) at 30\u201350 \u00b5L/min to wash unbound fluorescently labeled HJ. Then let the flow cell sit for 5 min to allow for the OSS to deplete dissolved oxygen. The photobleaching of the fluorophores should be minimal at the start of imaging.\nSet the exposure time (~60 ms), the cycle time will be automatically set by software based on the speed of data transfer (~104 ms), and specify the desired number of cycles or frames (~400).The emission from donor (Cy3) and acceptor (Alexa Fluor 647) is split into two color channels by an image splitter device.\nFind a suitable area on the surface, focus the image by adjusting the height of the objective and record and save the movie in 16-bit TIFF format.\nMove to a new area.\n\t\tNOTE: Always move in one direction only (i.e., from outlet to inlet) to avoid imaging the same area twice.\nPrepare 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 nM GEN1 in 120 \u00b5L of imaging buffer one at a time. Flow the solution at a flow rate of 30-50 \u00b5L/min.\n\t\tNOTE: If the required measurement is done under steady state as in the binding of HJ by GEN1 or the isomerization of the free HJ, then wait 3\u20135 min after the flow stops to record the movie. Acquire three to four movies from new areas for each GEN1 concentration.If the measurement is performed under continuous flow as in cleavage of HJ by GEN1 then start recording 5\u201310 s before the entrance of GEN1 into the flow cell. Repeat the measurement by moving to a new channel in the six-channel flow cell.\nAt the end, use a fixed fluorescent bead slide to map the donor and acceptor particles to each other in the image splitting device.\nAdd 0.2 \u00b5L of 1 \u00b5m diameter fluorescent beads into 500 \u00b5L of 1 M Tris (pH = 8.0) to allow the beads to stick to the surface.\nCut a square (18 mm x 18 mm) inside a 22 mm x 22 mm piece of a double-sided adhesive seal. Peel off and stick the piece to the middle of a 76 mm x 25 mm quartz slide.\nPlace 50 \u00b5L of the diluted beads solution and leave for 5\u201310 min to settle. Attach a 22 mm x 22 mm coverslip on top of the square piece. Dry excess beads solution with tissue, then seal the chamber by epoxy glue.\nAcquire 100 frames of the beads slide at a 60 ms exposure time.\n\t\tCAUTION: Lower the laser power and the EMCCD gain to minimum to avoid saturation of the detector.\nInstall the software package (e.g., TwoTones) and open the movies therein as indicated in the user manual36. Select the positions of the individual beads in the donor and acceptor channels. Generate a transformation matrix as described in the manual.\n\t\tNOTE: This software uses transformation matrix to match the positions of the particles in the donor and acceptor channels and correct for any slight misalignment in the image splitting device.Go to File, press Load Movie, then select the movie file and press Open. In file menu, press Load TFORM and select the transformation matrix generated from the beads slide. Adjust the threshold for the donor and acceptor channels until no false positives are included.\nIn the Channel filter menu, choose D&&A option to select for particles labeled with both donor and acceptor. Check the Nearest neighbor limit field to exclude molecules that are very near to each other. Check Max ellipticity to exclude very eccentric molecules and check Width limits to exclude very broad or very narrow molecules.\nType plotHistCW as instructed in Twotones manual to construct histograms.\n\t\tNOTE: The \u201capparent\u201d FRET efficiency is calculated by the program by dividing the emission of the acceptor by the total emissions from the donor and acceptor. Twotones uses 100 intervals to bin the distribution of the states of the molecules against the FRET efficiency.\nType plotTimetraceCW as instructed in Twotones manual to generate the time-traces for each molecule.\n\t\tNOTE: Time-traces can be further analyzed by vbFRET37 to identify different FRET states, their respective dwell times, and transition rates between different states.\nTwo-color alternating excitation FRET (ALEX) experiments\nRecord a movie composed of consecutive frames of donor and acceptor emissions by direct excitations with the green and red lasers, respectively, each ~80 ms in duration.\nOpen the acquired ALEX movies in Twotones. Set the suitable detection threshold as ~300 for the three channels: donor emission due to donor excitation (DexDem); acceptor emission due to donor excitation (DexAem); and acceptor emission due to\u00a0direct excitation (AexAem).\nApply the Channel filter DexDem&&DexAem&&AexAem to select for the particles that have both donor\u00a0and acceptor. Link the particles ~200\u2013300 in the three channels.Use the plotHistALEX MATLAB code to generate ALEX histograms. Fit different peaks in the histograms to gaussian functions and determine the percentage of each population the area under the curve using Origin software38.\n\t\tNOTE: The peaks in the binding assay correspond to the bound GEN1-HJ complex, while in the free HJ, the peaks represent the interchanging isomers.\nUse the plotTimetraceALEX MATLAB code to generate a time-trace for each molecule showing donor emission by direct excitation, and acceptor emissions due to FRET and direct excitation.\n\t\tNOTE: ALEX time-traces independently to show the emissions of both the donor and acceptor, but at lower temporal resolution than single-color FRET. Similar to single-color FRET, ALEX time-traces can be further analyzed by vbFRET to identify different FRET states and their respective dwell times.\nDetermine the dissociation constant by fitting the percentages of the bound population versus GEN1 concentration to a hyperbolic function.\nTime lapse single-color FRET\nSet the exposure time of the green laser to 60 ms and cycle time to 624 ms or lower, depending on the speed of the observed dynamics.\nSet the flow rate to 110 \u00b5L/min in one\u00a0channel of\u00a0the six-channel flow cell. Start the recording briefly before the entrance of GEN1 inside the flow cell.\n\t\tNOTE: Continuous flow leads to rapid photobleaching of the fluorophores, therefore synchronizing the start of imaging and protein entry maximizes the number of captured events. The optimal syringe pump reading depends on the dead-volume and the exact tubing used to assemble the flow cell; in our case it is ~25 \u00b5L.\nAcquire a movie of ~125 frames for a total acquisition time of 78 s. At the end of the recording, expose the sample to the red laser for 50 frames each with 25 ms exposure time to probe the acceptor.NOTE: This method prolongs the observation window in cleavage experiment through decreasing the number of excitation cycles. Kinetic parameters as kon and koff of dimerization are derived by fitting the distribution to a bi-exponential model30,38.\n7.

Be sure to place the lid on the bottle only loosely, and be mindful of boiling retardation.Pipet 1 ml of the agarose solution onto a superfrost slide, overlay with a cover slip to spread it evenly across the slide, and let the agarose set at room temperature. The thickness of the agarose coating will be around 1 mm, and overlaying with the cover slip aids to distribute the agarose evenly across the slide and to ensure an even surface.When the agarose has set, gently remove the coverslip by sliding it towards the short end of the slide and air-dry the slides overnight.When the slides have dried completely, they can directly be used or stored for several months in a dry, cool space.Note: Pre-coating the slides with normal melting point agarose increases the adhesion of the agarose layer containing the cells for comet analysis. Culturing cells of interestEnsure that your cells of interest are in culture and growing exponentially (i.e., approximately between 60% and 80% confluence at the time of the assay). Split your cells of interest 1-3 days before running the assay according to your established cell culture procedure in the medium of choice.Note: The comet assay described here can be used to determine DNA damage in a wide variety of cultured cells, provided they can be brought into single cell solution. As the amount of DNA damage induced by a particular setting and the repair kinetics will depend on the cell line used, ideal settings for treatment and repair need to be experimentally determined.Preparation of material on the day of the assayPrepare appropriate amounts of neutral comet lysis buffer and cool to 4\u00b0C. Be sure to have enough cold dH2O to freshly prepare the cold electrophoresis buffer. The amount of lysis buffer required depends on the volume and number of the coplin jars that will be used. Typically, a medium-sized coplin jar can hold 10 slides and requires around 150 ml of buffer. The amount of the electrophoresis buffer needed depends on the apparatus that is used. For the CometAssay ESII apparatus that is used here, calculate approximately 850 ml. This amount does not depend on the number of slides since empty spaces for slides will be filled up with dummy slides.Place the comet electrophoresis apparatus (including cooling pack) at 4\u00b0C to cool down.Warm the water bath to 37\u00b0C.Completely dissolve 0.5 g of low melting point agarose (LMP) in 50 ml of 1\u00d7 PBS (for this 1% solution, a volume of 1 ml per sample plus some extra will be required, so increase the volume if more samples will be processed) by heating in a glass bottle in the microwave. Be sure to place the lid on the bottle only loosely and mind the boiling retardation. Once completely dissolved, place the bottle in the 37\u00b0C water bath to equilibrate to 37\u00b0C.Note: Keeping the correct temperature of the water bath is essential \u2013 if too cold, the agarose will solidify; if used too hot, this will cause additional damage to the cells. Label the agarose-coated slides using a pencil. Be sure to prepare at least duplicates, or better, triplicate slides for each assay condition (e.g., time-point or amount of DNA damaging agent).Prepare your workplace (see Figure 1):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4226/bioprotoc-11-22-4226-g001.jpgFigure 1. Proposed layout of a workplace to perform the comet assay.An optimal arrangement of the materials as discussed in the text is shown.Fill a large styrofoam bucket with ice, place a glass plate on top of the ice horizontally, and check using a level to ensure that cells in agarose will be evenly spread across the entire slide.Place coplin jar filled with cold lysis buffer into the same bucket (or a different ice-containing bucket next to it).Place an empty 24-well plate into a second ice bucket ready to receive the cell suspension.Prepare the following materials to be ready and close at hand next to the 37\u00b0C water bath: a P100 or P200 pipet plus tips, a P1000 pipet plus tips, molten low-melting point agarose equilibrated at 37\u00b0C, labelled microscope slides, cover slips, and timer.Treatment of cells and embedding into agaroseDepending on the research question, the neutral comet assay can be used to assess the amount of DNA damage caused by a specific amount of a fast and direct acting DNA damaging agent such as ionizing radiation (see D1). Moreover, the comet assay can be exploited to assess the repair kinetics after exposure to a certain amount of a DNA damaging agent (see D2) and also the levels of endogenous DNA damage present in cells (e.g., due to a genetic ablation of a DNA repair pathway) (see D3). Be sure to include appropriate positive and negative controls when running the assay.D1) Assessment of DNA damage caused by treatment of cells with ionising radiationIrradiate exponentially growing cells by placing the dish in the faxitron cabinet and following the manufacturer\u2019s detailed instructions to deliver the planned irradiation dose. As positive control, use a dose between 2 and 4 Gy.Trypsinize cells, neutralize trypsin by addition of complete medium, and count cells and dilute to 2 \u00d7 105 cells/ml in cold complete medium of choice in 15 ml Falcon tubes.Place Falcon tubes on ice to transfer them from the cell culture lab to the work bench.To ensure an even suspension of cells, carefully invert the Falcon tube a few times (avoid foam formation or vigorous shaking to avoid damaging the cells); then, pipet 250 \u00b5l of cell suspension into the wells of the 24-well plate (1 well per slide/sample) that is kept on ice.Ready the ice bucket with the glass plate, ensure it is still level, get the P1000 and the cover slips, and open the low-melting point agarose bottle (still keeping it in the 37\u00b0C water bath).Add 1 ml of LMP-Agarose into the well, pipetting carefully to avoid strong bubble formation, aspirate the mixture, and transfer 1 ml of the cell-agarose mix onto the appropriate agarose-coated microscopy slide. Immediately overlay with a cover slip and, paying attention to keep the slide as level as possible, transfer the slide onto the cold glass plate on ice for the agarose to gel. Repeat this for every well until all cell samples have been transferred onto slides. This procedure is visualised in Video 1. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Transfer of cells in LMP-Agarose onto microscopy slideWhen all samples have been transferred onto the slides, gently remove the cover slips by sliding them along the longitudinal axis (starting with the first sample) and place the slides into the coplin jar to immerse them in the lysis buffer. Keep the samples in cold (on ice) lysis buffer protected from light for at least 1 h.Note: This step can be prolonged to an overnight incubation provided that the samples are constantly kept at 4\u00b0C maximum and protected from light. Protection from light aims at reducing additional DNA damage that could be generated through, e.g., UV light or other sources. D2) Assessment of the repair kinetics after ionising radiationPrepare one dish of exponentially growing cells per time-point.Irradiate exponentially growing cells (i.e., approximately 60-80% confluence) by placing the dish in the faxitron cabinet and following the manufacturer\u2019s detailed instructions. As positive control use a dose between 2 and 4 Gy. The ideal dose of irradiation depends on your research question and the cell line used and should be experimentally determined.Start the timer to keep track of the post-irradiation time-points.Place the cell dishes that will be collected at later time-points back into the incubator.Trypsinize and embed the cells that are ready to be collected as outlined in section D, subsection D1, steps 2-7.Proceed with harvesting and embedding the cells of the remaining time-points accordingly.When all slides are in the lysis buffer, incubate the samples for at least 1 h before continuing with the electrophoresis.Note: This step can be prolonged to an overnight incubation provided that the samples are constantly kept at 4\u00b0C maximum and protected from light. D3) Assessment of endogenous DNA damage in cultured cellsTrypsinize exponentially growing cells (control versus, e.g., KO cells), neutralize the trypsin by addition of complete medium, count cells and dilute them to 2 \u00d7 105 cells/ml in complete medium of choice in 15 ml Falcon tubes.To embed the cells, follow the procedure as outlined in section D, subsection D1, steps 2-7.Important note: Be sure to include samples with appropriate positive and negative controls (e.g., ionizing radiation and no-treatment control) to ensure that the assay has worked!Electrophoresis and staining of comet slidesPrepare an appropriate amount of cold neutral comet electrophoresis buffer and store at 4\u00b0C until required.Slowly drain the lysis buffer from the coplin jars and replace with fresh cold electrophoresis buffer. Then drain the electrophoresis buffer and replace with fresh electrophoresis buffer. Repeat once more. Finally, incubate the slides in electrophoresis buffer for 60 min on ice, protecting from light.Fill the comet buffer tank with fresh cold electrophoresis buffer to the required level. Transfer the comet slides to the comet assay apparatus, paying attention to the orientation of the slides. Ensure that all slides are fully immersed in buffer and fill up the remaining space with dummy slides.Close the lid of the comet apparatus and run at 21 V for 60 min (this will result in ca. 120 mA current).Fill the coplin jar with dH2O.After electrophoresis, remove the slides from the tank and transfer them to the coplin jar containing dH2O.Incubate for 5 min, then drain the dH2O and carefully replace with fresh dH2O. Repeat once.In the meantime, prepare sufficient comet staining solution (approximately 600 \u00b5l per slide plus a bit extra). Keep protected from light.Transfer the slides to a tray lined with paper towels, paying attention to lay them down as level as possible.Cover each slide with approximately 600 \u00b5l of staining solution (ensure that the entire agarose part is covered with the solution), cover the tray with foil or a lid to protect from light, and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.Decant the staining solution and shortly dip each slide into fresh dH2O.Let the slides air dry overnight, protected from light.Imaging and analysis of comet slidesImage the slides on the fluorescent microscope, taking pictures at 10\u00d7 or 20\u00d7 magnification from different fields randomly picked across the entire slide.Be sure to use exposure and light intensities that allow clear visualization of your comets from the background, and try to focus as well as possible. Image an absolute minimum of 50 cells per condition, but preferentially at least 100 cells or more. Keep separate image folders for every single slide, containing all separate images of the different fields. Save all individual images as tiff files in one folder per slide.Analyse the images using the OpenComet plugin available for FIJI as follows.Open the OpenComet plugin.Choose the input file folder (all images for one slide can be selected and analysed at once) and an output file directory.Using the \u2018auto\u2019 head finding mode, click run. Results of this analysis will be summarized in an Excel file that is saved in the output file directory chosen previously.Check that all the comets have been correctly detected anf deselect the ones that clearly need to be excluded/are incorrect (e.g., artefacts and debris that are not comets that have been scored, overlays of multiple nucleoids, comets in which the head has been wrongly defined, or similar) by clicking on them. OpenComet will outline every regularly detected comet in red (with a red circle around the head and a red line to delineate the tail, see Figure 2A and 2B). In addition to this, there is a green line that shows the intensity distribution of the signal detected as the head, and a blue line for the signal detected as the tail. Sometimes the software is unsure whether something is a correctly detected comet or not (e.g., unusual head). In that case, OpenComet will outline these \u2018outliers\u2019 in yellow (Figure 2C and 2D). However, it is also possible that shapes are incorrectly scored, as in Figure 2E.Here, the very low intensity signal was incorrectly scored as having a minuscule head and most of the signal being in the tail. Inclusion of such a shape would strongly influence the result, especially if this happens more than once or if only a few cells are assessed per condition. If OpenComet can\u2019t analyse the shapes (e.g., if two or more comets are too close to each other or overlying), the shapes will be outlined in grey (Figure 2F). The same will happen to those comets that you have deselected/excluded by clicking on them. It is very important to visually double-check every comet, as incorrectly assessed ones can strongly influence the result.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4226/bioprotoc-11-22-4226-g002.jpgFigure 2. Example of images of comets analysed using the OpenComet plugin running the \u00abauto\u00bb head finding mode and possible result plots. These data were obtained using Tig-1 human primary fibroblasts after irradiation with 4 Gy. A) OpenComet outlines every regularly detected comet in red with a red circle around the head and a red line to delineate the tail. The green line shows the intensity distribution of the head signal, and the blue line shows the tail signal. Red numbers indicate the individual comets as listed in the quantification sheet. B) Representative picture showing control cells. Clearly, these cells show much less DNA in the tail than the cells in A), which were treated with ionizing radiation. C) and D) A yellow shape indicates that the software is unsure about the correct detection of comets. Be sure to visually inspect these comets and exclude/include as appropriate. E) Example of an incorrect score of a comet shape. The very low intensity signal was incorrectly scored to have a minuscule head and most of the signal in the tail. Inclusion of such a shape would strongly influence the result.F) A grey shape indicates that OpenComet is not able to outline comets, e.g., because cells are too close together. G-H) The results obtained in the Excel file can be plotted (G) as a mean value of the duplicates or triplicates that were analysed as percentage of DNA in tail, tail moment, or olive moment or (H) as individual data points (e.g., of 50 cells that were quantified).After double-checking all comets on all slides, click \u2018update\u2019. This will generate a second Excel sheet with the suffix \u2018_update\u2019 that takes into account the comets that have been excluded.This excel sheet contains all the values for all comet images of the slide that was analysed. In the last few rows are values for mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for all detected comets, divided into either only all normal comets or the normal and outlier comets. The choice of which of these values to use depends on whether you are fine with including the values of the outliers or not. Normally, both these values are very similar to one another.There are two ways to plot the results: first, you can calculate a mean value of the duplicates or triplicates that were analysed as percentage of DNA in tail, tail moment, or olive moment, e.g., using a bar graph. Repeat the entire assay at least two more times to obtain three or more independent values for each data point (Figure 2G). Second, you can also plot all the individual data points (e.g., of 50 cells that were quantified) of at least three repeats of the entire assay (Figure 2H).Note: The tail moment describes the product of multiplying the length of the comet tail with the percentage of DNA in the tail, while the olive moment is the product of the total percentage of DNA in the tail and the distance between the centres of the masses of both head and tail regions. The olive moment is particularly useful to describe heterogeneity within a cell population, as the olive moment picks up variations in how the DNA is distributed in the tail. Of all the three options, the percentage of DNA in the tail is the measurement that seems the most intuitive to most researchers. To test whether the groups differ significantly from each other, you can use the Student\u2019s t-test when only two groups are compared. When comparing three or more groups, use one-way ANOVA followed by, e.g., Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparison test.When publishing comet assay data, it\u2019s strongly advisable to adhere to the \u2018minimum information for reporting on the comet assay (MIRCA)\u2019 guidelines that were just recently published in an attempt to ensure better interpretation, verification and reproducibility of results across laboratories (Moller et al., 2020).", "1.

A high fidelity staining strategy was used, comprising the specific T-cell markers CD3, CD8 and pMHC-tetramer, and the dump markers CD14 and CD19 to exclude any contamination during the sort from monocytes and B cells, respectively. In addition, a LIVE/DEAD Viability dye was included in the cell staining. For details on the specific staining, see Koning et al. (2013). Tetramer-positive populations usually comprised 0.1-1.0% of CD8+ T cells and in general 500-5,000 antigen-specific cells were isolated. Note: Although the specific fluorochromes noted here were used in Koning et al. (2013), we have performed a similar staining strategy using different fluorochromes in other studies. Similarly, although this protocol specifies the analysis of EBV and CMV-specific T cells, there are no restrictions for the analysis of T cells directed against other species/antigens.To obtain a complete and accurate view of the TCR composition of an antigen-specific T-cell population, make sure to sort a sufficient number of cells (at least 500-1,000 cells, ideally 5,000 cells or even more) at high purity (by including dump markers and a viability dye, as described above).

Prepare a PCR mastermix of all reagents except for the template. Prepare enough for a duplicate of each sample and one negative control (water instead of template). Small, artificial variations in clonotype composition can be caused by the PCR.

Muscle biopsy: collection of the sample\nTiming: the day before or the day of isolation, duration: 30\u00a0min\nCritical: It is very important to ensure that the muscle biopsy is handled under sterile conditions and is immersed in muscle collection media as soon as possible after removal from the body and kept on ice or at 4\u00b0C at all times to prevent tissue contamination and degradation.\nCollect the sample and place in cold Collection media.\nKeep the muscle biopsy in 50\u00a0mL conical tube(s) filled with 25\u00a0mL cold muscle collection media and keep on ice at all times.\nWeigh the muscle sample. Tare an empty 50\u00a0mL conical tube and using sterile forceps, carefully place the muscle sample inside to record the weight. Annotate for future calculations.\nNote: The sample should be weighed as soon as possible. If you wait overnight to weigh the sample, the weight might not be accurate due to accumulation of media in the muscle. Record information such as the type of muscle, age of the individual, and gender. Additional information like history of diseases and medications taken could be useful, depending on the purpose and approval by the study Committee on Human Research.\nNote: A secure sample database with the desired sample information is useful. Comply with human subject de-identification as described in your approved protocol.This step is facilitated by using a 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 magnification lens. Remove connective and adipose tissue and any cauterized or devitalized tissue contaminants from the muscle sample. Remove any other contaminant (such as surgical foreign bodies -as in the Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) or necrotic parts (black or burned) from the muscle. The connective tissue looks white and sometimes transparent and care should be taken to dissect it from the muscle without severing the muscle fibers as much as possible.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1329-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Muscle biopsy from a gracilis muscle\nFirst clean-up of the muscle biopsy from a gracilis muscle of a 54-year-old female by precise dissection of visible connective and fat tissue, depicted here with the blue arrow, taking care to minimally disrupt the adjacent muscle fibers. The red arrow indicates a surgical metallic foreign body that has to be removed as well as any other gross contaminant. Scale bar: 0.5\u00a0cm.\nOptional: At this point you may reserve a fraction of the muscle sample for other experiments such as for histology, for instance.\nThe sample destined to FACS should be placed in a conical tube(s) with 40\u00a0mL of ice cold muscle collection media and kept at 4\u00b0C.\nPause point: At this point you may proceed with the isolation protocol or continue the next day. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that is possible to isolate Hu-MuSC for at least a few days after collection; however proceeding to the isolation process within 18\u00a0h after sample collection will minimize Hu-MuSC activation and tissue decay and will maximize yield.Note: Keep the sample on ice or refrigerated at 4\u00b0C at all times and work efficiently to aid cell viability after sorting. Avoid cutting or manipulating the muscle sample too much in order to minimize injury to the fibers and subsequent activation of the Hu-MuSC.\nPhase II. Preparation of a single-cell suspension from muscle tissue\nTiming: total duration of phase II using MACS columns, 6 h+; total duration of this phase without the MACS, 4\u20135 h\nPhase IIa. Macro-dissociation: mechanical dissociation of the muscle\nTiming: 10\u00a0min/g of tissue\nNote: Ensure a biological safety laminar flow cabinet/cell culture cabinet class II or III to maintain sterility throughout the entire process.\nThe goal is to go from whole muscle to minced muscle to clumps of cells by meticulous mechanical dissociation using blades, syringes, and washes. It is important to keep the muscle immersed in prewarmed digestion media, never letting the tissue dry. Minimize shear cell stress by avoiding mashing or grinding the tissue or pipetting too fast.\nPrewarm the digestion media with collagenase (10\u00a0mL for each gram of muscle) and trypsin 0.25% (3\u00a0mL for every gram of tissue) in heating rocks or water bath at 37\u00b0C.\nNote: If processing more than one biological sample (different donors) at the same time, label clearly throughout the process and use separate dissection equipment for each sample, including blades, syringes, tubes, pipettes, Pasteur pipettes, and any other equipment that comes into contact with the tissue to avoid contaminating the samples. Dispose appropriately after bleach 10% and in a biohazard labeled trash.\nUse a box cutting blade and size 15 disposable scalpel in a 10\u00a0cm glass Petri dish.Perform the mincing in a small amount (about 3\u00a0mL) of Digestion media to enhance the mechanical digestion process. Take care to mince the muscle tissue with the box cutting blade and scalpel to as small (<1\u00a0mm2) clear cut pieces, avoiding crushing or smashing the tissue. Proper mechanical digestion will ensure that the dissociation process will be as efficient as possible (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1329-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Macro-dissociation\nMechanical dissociation of the muscle sample is done using a box cutting blade in a 10 mm Petri dish to sharply and cleanly cut pieces in <1 mm2 without smashing or crushing the tissue. Scale bar: 2 cm.\nWhen thoroughly minced, transfer to a 50\u00a0mL conical tube. The more minced it is the easier to pipette or scoop out the muscle to the conical tube. Use sterile PBS to retrieve the pieces in the Petri dish and place all inside the conical tube.\nPhase IIb. Micro-dissociation: enzymatic dissociation of the muscle\nTiming: 2\u20133 h\nThe goal of the micro-dissociation and clean up phases is to go from clumps of cells to a clear single-cell suspension using enzymatic dissociation involving collagenase, trypsin, DNase, filters, and washes.\nResuspend the minced muscle in the prewarmed digestion media with collagenase, at 10\u00a0mL of media per 1\u00a0g of muscle. Example: For 5\u00a0g muscle sample, 50\u00a0mL of media will be needed. For large samples 5\u00a0g or more we recommend having an even number of conical tubes to hold the sample and the media without overflowing the tube. In the same example, we would place the 5\u00a0g of muscle in two conical tubes each with 25\u00a0mL of digestion media with collagenase. Close the lid well, as you will place the sample in the shaker next.Place on mixing platform in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 35\u00a0min, shaking gently and continuously. Use a shaker inside the incubator in the cell culture room. Every 10\u00a0min swirl and gently flick the tubes a few times during the incubation to dislodge the pellet and ease the penetration of the enzymes into the myofibers.\nNote: Prior to use, the 13 gauge needle should be washed well in 70% ethanol, followed by milli Q water and then in sterile PBS; after inserting the syringe, aspirate the sterile PBS a few times to ensure cleanliness and removal of harsh chemicals prior to any contact with the tissue. The 13 gauge needle can be reused. It should be cleaned and disinfected after each use using a brush with soap and 10% bleach and kept in 70% ethanol.\nIn the 50\u00a0mL conical tube where the sample is, break up the tissue by passing through the 13 gauge needle attached to a 60\u00a0mL syringe about 10\u201320 times until the tissue is grossly dissociated. After that, pass the suspension through a 16-gauge needle attached to a 20\u00a0mL syringe about 10\u201320 times followed by a 19-gauge needle 10 times (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).Note: Slowly move the media with the tissue up and down the syringe. If you find clogs, gently pull them out of the eye of the needle with tweezers. Usually the clogs are connective tissue; if this is the case, you can remove them gently from the media. Be gentle to avoid any spilling of the precious sample. If the clumps are muscle, put them back on the Petri dish and mince more with the box cutting blade, then pass through the needle 10 times more. Stop soon after you get a homogeneous solution that does not clog the needle. Important to avoid generating bubbles, do not aspirate air and do not do it too many times or too fast as it may damage the cells.\nPlace the sample back in the 37\u00b0C mixing incubator for another 35\u00a0min. The sample should be in the original 50\u00a0mL conical tube with digestion collagenase buffer for a total time of 1\u00a0h 10\u00a0min. It is recommended to resuspend the pellet by aspirating with a wide-bore 1\u00a0mL tip a few times during this stage of the incubation to facilitate penetration of the collagenase all throughout the tissue.\nNote: By now 3\u00a0mL of 0.25% trypsin for every gram of tissue should be warmed to 37\u00b0C for later use. As well, ensure the DNase media is ready by now and kept at RT. The DNase media should be prepared fresh the day of the digestion.\nAfter 1\u00a0h and 10\u00a0min TOTAL time of tissue digestion, dilute and rinse the suspension with ice cold PBS w/o Ca++ or Mg+ by filling up the 50\u00a0mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the sample at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and then aspirate the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet completely in residual supernatant and wash again with ice cold PBS w/o Ca++ or Mg+.\nNote: Pipette slowly and with wide-bore pipette tips to increase cell viability.\nCentrifuge the sample again at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and then carefully aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet completely in the residual liquid.\nAdd 3\u00a0mL of 0.25% trypsin for every gram of tissue (starting weight), mix gently and place in a 37\u00b0C warmer for 5\u201312\u00a0min according to weight of the sample. If less than 1 g, incubate for 5\u00a0min and if equal or more than 2\u00a0g incubate for 10\u00a0min to a maximum incubation time of 12\u00a0min.\nAdd 1.5\u00a0mL of FBS per gram of tissue to quench the trypsin and mix gently by swirling the tube around.\nFill up to top with 2% FBS in sterile PBS.\nCentrifuge the sample at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and then aspirate the supernatant.\nCritical: Only aspirate the supernatant after centrifugation at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in a refrigerated Benchtop Centrifuge. Watch the pellet at all times after centrifuging to avoid losing cells. Always place the tubes in the centrifuge in the same way, so you know where the pellet is located (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Knowing the expected position of the pellet is especially useful when working with a very limited number of cells, as the pellet cannot be seen. Utmost care should be taken when aspirating the supernatant to not touch the pellet and leave enough supernatant after aspiration. When changing tubes, wash a few times and collect the washes in the new tube to try to collect all the cells throughout the process.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.Methods video S1. Micro-dissection of the muscle using syringes with 13 and 19 gauge needles\nThis video demonstrates the micro-dissection techniques using syringes employed in step 12. Note the volume goes up and down as the syringe moves slow and steady. A clog is sensed in the 19 gauge needle and skillfully removed from the suspension.\nPhase IIc. Clear single-cell suspension\nIncubate the sample with DNase media (final concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in DMEM). Add 3\u20135\u00a0mL of DNase in the conical tube to the sample and incubate 5 to 10\u00a0min at RT.\nNote: This DNase step reduces cell clumping, and it is highly recommended to do.\nAdd 5\u00a0mL of 2% FBS in PBS.\nCentrifuge the sample at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and then aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend in 5\u00a0mL of 2% FBS in PBS.\nPlace a 40\u00a0\u03bcm sterile cell strainer in a new 50\u00a0mL conical tube, label accordingly, and pipette the cell suspension through the cell strainer using a 1\u00a0mL wide-bore tip. Use 2% FBS in PBS to wash and recover most of the cells from the 50\u00a0mL conical tube and place over the filter (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The sample should easily go through the cell strainer filter but if you find the filter clogs, try carefully centrifuging the sample for 1\u00a0min and filter again through a new sterile cell strainer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1329-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Ensure a clear single-cell suspension\nOnce the sample has been mechanically and enzymatically dissociated, it is filtered through a cell strainer 40\u00a0\u03bcm filter (blue arrow) fitted in a 50\u00a0mL conical tube. The red arrow shows the connective tissue remaining in the filter after filtration.Note: Do not skip the cell strainer filtration step, otherwise clumps may clog the MACS column or the sort later on and compromise the flow and yield of your sample.\nCentrifuge the sample at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and then aspirate the supernatant, leaving 0.5\u00a0mL safe margin to protect the integrity of the pellet.\nResuspend the pellet and perform red blood cell lysis by adding 1\u00a0mL ice cold ACK per gram of tissue (starting weight) and incubate on ice for 5\u20137\u00a0min. Red blood cell contamination varies with individual tissues and storage sizes. Satellite cells are remarkably resistant to ACK exposure (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1329-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. ACK treatment to lyse red blood cells\nThe red arrows show the pellet before (A) or after (B) the ACK treatment. Note the anemic pellet in (B). It is crucial to know the position of the pellet as it gets whiter and smaller. The icon syringe in (A) serves to illustrate the position of the tip of the pipette when aspirating the supernatant, distant enough from the pellet.\nWash the sample by filling the conical with 2% FBS in PBS.\nCentrifuge the sample at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and then aspirate the supernatant.\nWash the 50\u00a0mL conical tube with ice cold MACS buffer up to the top, centrifuge, and aspirate supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 2\u00a0mL of MACS buffer.\nPhase IId. MACS and antibodies for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)Note: The MACS columns help to eliminate non-target cells like hematopoietic cells (CD45+ and CD31+). The advantages of using the MACS columns are shorter FACS sorting time and better visualization of the enriched populations during the sort as there is less noise signal. For experiments that require high purity of Hu-MuSC (i.e., \u2019omics), the MACS is recommended in order to maximize removal of contaminant cells. Nevertheless, the MACS step is optional, and it is possible to isolate Hu-MuSC without it.\nAdd 5\u00a0\u03bcL Fc blocking reagent for every gram of tissue to the conical sample tube, mix gently, and incubate for 5\u00a0min on ice.\nAdd 5\u00a0\u03bcL of anti-CD45 magnetic beads and 2\u00a0\u03bcL of anti-CD31 magnetic beads for every gram of tissue to the sample tube, mix gently, and incubate for 30\u00a0min on ice.\nIn the meantime, set up the magnetic columns as in Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. The MACS LD column has to be attached to the MidiMACS separator magnet attached to a MACS MultiStand (see set up in Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Make sure the column clicks in by pushing it gently all the way toward the separator magnet. Prepare each column by adding 5\u00a0mL of MACs buffer and discard this first flow. We have been using one column for up to 3\u00a0g of muscle in order to avoid clogging the column.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1329-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Magnetic cell separation\nSetup for the magnetic cell separation (MACS LD) of hematopoietic cells (CD45+ and CD31+) from the cell suspension by means of antibodies and magnetic columns.\nWash the sample by filling the 50\u00a0mL conical tube with MACs buffer.\nCentrifuge the sample at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and then aspirate the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet completely in residual liquid -about 500\u00a0\u03bcL- and use a wide-bore pipette to release the drop of cells on top of a MACS LD column. Repeat 2 or 3 times with 500\u00a0\u03bcL of MACS buffer to wash the cells out of the 50\u00a0mL tube. Fill column with 3\u20135\u00a0mL of MACS buffer. Allow the sample to run through the column all the way, it may take up to 45\u00a0min.\nNote: We do not use the separation columns if the sample is equal or less than 1\u00a0g because there is substantial satellite cell loss in the process, a trade-off for sorting speed. In that case, we proceed directly to the incubation with FACS antibodies with all appropriate controls for the gating and sort.\nCollect the FLOW-through in a new 15\u00a0mL conical on ice and then elute the BOUND fraction in a separate 15\u00a0mL conical by adding 3\u00a0mL MACS buffer to the column and plunging after the removal of the column from the magnet.\nNote: The FLOW sample will contain the majority of Hu-MuSC. The main advantage of using the MACS column is speeding up the sorting, since the target cells are more concentrated in the FLOW sample, and you should always sort this sample first. The bound still contains some Hu-MuSC you can recover on additional sorting time. For example, from the FLOW obtained processing a 5\u00a0g gracilis muscle sample from a 54-year-old female, we isolated 20,500 Hu-MuSC during a 15\u00a0min sort and from the BOUND only 500 more cells were collected in a similar amount of time.\nStart preparing the master solution for antibodies according to ONE of the following panels:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1329_2.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1329_3.csv\nIncubate the cells with the selected panel of antibodies during 20\u201330\u00a0min on ice.Note: Prepare the Controls for proper calibration and gating. The controls should include:\nCompensation controls: Make single-color isotype compensation controls for each fluorochrome using beads. 1\u20132 drops of beads with the same amount of 1\u00d7 antibody used for that specific wavelength. Shake the beads vigorously as they tend to clump together.\nNote: Use new beads as old beads tend to stick to each other.\nUnstained cells: Take an aliquot from the BOUND and do not add any antibody, not even cell viability marker.\nFMO with cells (Fluorescence minus one): all antibodies but one. Usually done for the most critical antibody(ies). We routinely use the FMO for CXCR4 and for CAV1 in panels A and B respectively.\nWash the samples with MACS buffer by filling the conical tube to 15\u00a0mL.\nCentrifuge the samples at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C then aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellets gently in 100\u00a0\u03bcL MACS buffer.\nAdd the antibodies prepared according to panel A or B and incubate 30\u00a0min on ice, in the dark.\nAdd 2\u00a0mL MACS buffer to the 15\u00a0mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the samples at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, then aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend in 200\u00a0\u03bcL or 400\u00a0\u03bcL (depending on how concentrated you expect your sample to be) of MACS buffer with sytox blue at a dilution of 1:1,000 and place the resuspended cells on top of the filter cap of the flow cytometry tubes.\nCritical: The final steps are most critical to keep small volumes safe and avoid any loss of the sample; make sure the cap of the flow cytometry tube is tightly closed before adding the sample on top to the filter cap. It should click.Centrifuge the samples at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 60\u00a0s min at 4\u00b0C. Keep samples at 4 degrees and sort as soon as possible. Add sytox blue again if the sort takes more than 1 h.\nNote: Sort the cells into low retention 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tubes to reduce the number of Hu-MuSC lost by tube wall attachment. This is especially critical when you have very limited amount of starting material.\nPhase III. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of Hu-MuSC\nTotal duration of the sort: Around 2\u00a0h for proper compensation, controls and sort one sample of\u00a01\u20132\u00a0g.\nThe last step should have yielded a clear cell suspension where ideally, most cells are single, (some doublets -two cells together) and no clusters of cells or debris. Cells are exposed to the antibodies with the selected fluorochromes targeting the cell membrane. The target population of Hu-MuSC will be positively sorted for CXCR4+, CD56+ and CD29+. Cells with hematopoietic markers such as CD45, CD31, and CD34 will all be discarded on the Pac blue channel.\nCritical: The sorter has to be professionally set up before use. Next the compensation phase will ensure the detection of each of the fluorochromes without significant overlap or appropriate compensation for it.\nPhase IIIa. Compensation\nRun single-color isotype compensation controls on the flow cytometer to determine gating. We use FACS DIVA software standard with the sorter. The following are instructions to achieve the compensation using FACS DIVA.\nUnder Experiments, select Create Compensation.\nFirst, adjust the voltages and do not record yet.\nRun a single compensation control for each channel. Set the P2 on the shoulders of the positive signal per channel. Notice where positive is.\nRun compensation. Wait for the confirmation feedback that it is done.Note: In the histogram used in the compensation, define the bandwidth of positive signal, tracing vertical lines over the narrow shoulders of the positive peak curve to define the range of positive fluorescence intensity for that channel and avoid or compensate for wavelength overlap with other channels.\nPhase IIIb. Gating\nOnce the compensation has been completed in a satisfactory manner, it is advisable to run the controls - the unstained control followed by the FMO- and set the gates accordingly.\nRun and record the Unstained control.\nRun and record the FMO control.\nRun the first sample at low speed and adjust the gates.\nDo not change any parameter or gating after all is compensated and keep these same parameters for all the samples.\nPhase IIIc. Sorting\nCritical: Ensure professional setup and calibration of the sorter. In the sorter window, select 4 purity mode, check the window where the sort is saved continuously for later quality control, and constantly monitor the flow rate to 1 or 2. The flow should be uniform and regular and not exceeding the recommended 7,000 events/s for the 100\u00a0\u03bcm nozzle. Parameters in the droplet camera should be carefully monitored during the sort. Make sure the angle of the flow of sorted cells into the collection tubes is placed right at the center of the tube on the collection media, and not by the tube wall, as it compromises the viability of the cells. Having an expert support team to troubleshoot problems with the sorters during sorting is highly recommended.Note: The size of the nozzle we use is 100\u00a0\u03bcm considering that the size of the satellite cell is 8\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm. Meticulous fine-tuning of the quality of the cell flow in the flow chamber and the points where the first drops detach from the stream and can be analyzed individually have to be professionally calibrated for optimal sorting. The panel of fluorescent antibodies to sort satellite cells and subpopulations have to be deliberately planned and executed.\nCritical: Do not vortex the cells at any point as this negatively affects cell viability.\nRun samples on the flow cytometer and sort satellite cells; sort scheme: FSC/SSC -> viable singlets -> negative depletion of CD31/CD34/CD45/sytox positive cells -> CXCR4+ -> CD56/ CD29 gate (see Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1329-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. Representative FACS profiles for the isolation of human satellite cells\nHu-MuSC were isolated from a gracilis muscle from a 54-year-old female.\n(A) Single-color compensation controls. Beads stained with each individual antibody and plotted on the 4 colors of interest.\n(B) The initial population is gated for viable singlets using forward and side scatter. CXCR4 gate is defined by the all negative in the unstained and CXCR4 FMO and positive in the sample gating for CXCR4+/sytox negative cells. The last gate defines CD56+ and CD29+ in the FLOW and BOUND samples to sort for Hu-MuSC.\nCollect CD31-/CD34-/CD45-/sytox-/ CXCR4+/ CD56+/ CD29+ cells directly into the satellite cell collection media tubes.\nDuring the sort, record some key monitoring parameters such as flow rate, drop 1. Be ready to take note of the number of sorted cells, as well as the percentage of the sorted population over the overall cell population, etc.\nKeep the vials on ice after the sort and proceed immediately with experiments or cell cryopreservation.Export and save all the FCS files for later quality control and record of the sort.\nPhase IIId. QC of the FACS\nRetrospective analysis of the sample is recommended after the sort using Flow Jo and the exported FCS files. An example of a sort is shown in Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]. Note the single-color compensation controls used to set up the calibration and additional controls such as unstained and FMO (fluorescence minus one \u2013 in this case CXCR4 PE) to accurately draw the gates to sort Hu-MuSC (CXCR4+, CD56+ and CD29+) in both the \u201cflow\u201d and \u201cbound\u201d samples.\nPhase IV. Applications and preservation of Hu-MuSC\nAfter the sort, it is recommended to centrifuge for 10\u00a0min at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) 4\u00b0C to collect all the cells, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend in 1\u00a0mL of fresh media or 0.04% BSA in PBS (for immediate use) or freezing media for cryopreservation (see below).\nNote: Countess and Trypan Blue staining can be used to assess cell numbers and cell viability after the sort. This is not recommended for less than 10,000 cells as this low cell count might be out of range for an accurate quantification using the Countess instrument.\nPhase IVa. QC of the sorted cells: satellite cell PAX7 expression\nTo assess if the sorted cells correspond to the expected highly purified viable human satellite cells, it is recommended to do QC tests to validate the expression of PAX7 as follows:PAX7 Immunostaining: Cells can be plated on Matrigel precoated dishes, seeded for at least 4\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C and then fixed with PFA 4%, blocked and incubated with PAX7 antibody (dilution 1:50 from the concentrated PAX7 antibody from DHSB) to verify the presence of PAX7 in the nucleus. Satellite cells are very small cells approximately 8\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter, and after the sort they look compact and round. Visualization under 20\u00d7 to 40\u00d7 light and fluorescence microscopy is required. Immediately after the sort we are able to isolate a pure population of satellite cells, with PAX7 detectable by immunostaining in >95%. This number declines to 75% positive PAX7 cells 12\u00a0h after plating (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1329-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. PAX7 and MYOD expression in sorted Hu-MuSC\nThree hours after the sort, almost 100% of Hu-MuSC express PAX7 but by 12 h, this decreases to an average of 75%.\n(A) Hu-MuSC derived from a vastus lateralis muscle from an 83-year-old male plated 12 h after the sort, an average 75% of SC show a positive nuclear PAX7 immunostaining in various degrees of intensity. Red arrowheads indicate Hu-MuSC that have expression of PAX7. Scale bar: 10 \u03bcm.\n(B) PAX7 mRNA expression by RT-QPRC of Hu-MuSC, right after the sort, from 5 different human donors including: temporalis from a 20-year-old female, gracilis from a 24-year-old female, extensor digitorum longus from a 63-year-old male, rectus abdominis from a 67-year-old female, tensor fascia latae from a 73-year-old male. Sorted cells from whole muscle (normally going to waste channel) were used as controls showing no PAX7 expression.\n(C) Hu-MuSC derived from a gracilis muscle from a 58-year-old female plated 3 days after the sort show positive nuclear MYOD immunostaining (green arrowheads). Scale bar: 10 \u03bcm.PAX7 RT Q-PCR: RNA isolation of the sorted cells can be done with Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol eluting final volume to 14\u00a0\u03bcL. Use the RNase free DNase. The extraction usually yields 50\u2013500\u00a0ng total RNA for 5,000\u201310,000 Hu-MuSCs. After RNA isolation, continue immediately to cDNA transcription. It is important to do cDNA amplification up to 18 cycles. Run control samples (pre-amp and no pre-amp) in the latter qPCR to verify that the \u0394Ct is correctly maintained upon amplification. Proceed to reverse transcription using PAX7 Taq or Sybergreen primers to detect and quantify PAX7 transcript (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nDifferentiation potential: The capacity of Hu-MuSC to differentiate into muscle progenitors and express muscle specific markers such as MYOD, MYH1, and MYOG can also be tested a few days after the sort. Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C shows MYOD staining in Hu-MuSC plated in growth media 3\u00a0days after the sort.\nPhase IVb. Applications of Hu-MuSC\nPurified Hu-MuSC can subsequently utilized in experiments tailored to the users\u2019 specific interests such as phenotypic characterization, or a variety of assays.\nCell dynamics can be visualized using time-lapse video-microscopy to assess time to first division, migration, cellular mobility (Barruet et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nRecent development in techniques to study single-cell \u2019omics (Barruet et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) are applicable to purified Hu-MuSC, and concentration of the desired cells using the approaches described here permit deeper analysis of single-cell data by virtue of analyzing more cells that without interference from separate cell types in a sample. For single-cell RNA, sorted Hu-MuSC were centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) at 4\u00b0C, followed by resuspension in 50\u00a0\u03bcL of BSA 0.04% in PBS and immediately submitted for scRNA seq.Xenotransplantation is another function application to test the capacity of Hu-MuSC to engraft, regenerate, and respond to in vivo exposures and injury (Garcia et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPhase IVc. Preservation of Hu-MuSC\nTo cryopreserve, Hu-MuSC are suspended in DMEM/F12 with 20% FBS, 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS), 1% glutamine, 1% gentamicin, and 10% DMSO, and frozen at a cooling rate of \u22121\u00b0C/min overnight as follows:\nCentrifuge at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nWash the cells in sterile cold PBS.\nCentrifuge at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 4\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nResuspend in 1\u00a0mL of Freezing media (DMEM/F12 with 20% FBS, 1\u00d7 ITS, 1\u00d7 glutamine, 1\u00d7 gentamicin, and 10% DMSO).\nLabel the tube with name of the cells and sample identifiers. Record the number of cells, the date, and any other pertinent information for your experiments.\nPlace in an RT freezing block in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer.\nFor long term storage transfer to a liquid nitrogen cell bank and place in well labeled plastic boxes with appropriate holes to allow drainage. Record storage in a database.\nThawing Hu-MuSC after cryostorage:\nNote: We have successfully thawed and cultured Hu-MuSC that were in cryostorage for 4\u20135 years.\nRemove cryovial(s) from liquid or vapor-phase nitrogen storage and immediately thaw in the heating rocks or water bath at 37\u00b0C. Remove when a small frozen portion still remains in the vial.\nAfter thawing is complete, clean the vial with 70% alcohol and KimWipes.\nIn a biosafety hood, gently transfer thawed cells to a 50\u00a0mL conical tube using a wide-bore pipette tip.\nUsing a wide-bore pipette tip, rinse the cryovial with 1\u00a0mL warm complete growth medium. Add the rinse medium dropwise (1 drop per 5 s) to the 50\u00a0mL conical tube while gently shaking the tube. Dropwise addition of medium prevents osmotic lysis.Serially dilute cells with complete growth medium a total of 5 times by 1:1 volume addition with ~1\u00a0min wait between additions. Add complete growth medium at a speed of 3\u20135\u00a0mL/s. For example, slowly add 2\u00a0mL medium into the existing 2\u00a0mL cell suspension, gently swirl for 5 s, and leave the tube for ~1\u00a0min. This is considered the second serial dilution. Repeat 3 more times to achieve a final volume of ~32\u00a0mL.\nCentrifuge cells at 2,000\u00a0rpm (500 RCF) for 10\u00a0min and resuspend in desired medium.", "1. Nucleic acid and chemical probe preparation\nNucleic acids\n\tNOTE: The oligonucleotide named \"TBA\" is the 15-mer DNA sequence 5'-GGT-TGG-TGT-GGT-TGG-3' labeled at the 3'-end by the fluorophore 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) to enable visualization on the gel. The unlabeled oligonucleotide \"cTBA\" is its DNA complementary sequence 5'-CCA-ACC-ACA-CCA-ACC-3'. TBA and cTBA are employed to obtain the three different structures, as shown in Table 1.\n\t\nAutoclave tips and 0.5 mL tubes in order to obtain sterile disposables and avoid contamination.\nPrepare stock solutions solubilizing each oligonucleotide in ultrapure water to a final concentration of 100 \u00b5M. Determine the exact oligonucleotide concentration with a ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer, using the extinction coefficient at 260 nm provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\tNOTE: Extinction coefficients: 164,300 M-1 cm-1 and 138,600 M-1 cm-1 were used for TBA and cTBA, respectively.\nStore TBA and cTBA stock solutions at -20 \u00b0C (for months in these conditions).\nCompound B-CeP 1\n\tNOTE: The compound B-CeP 1 is synthesized as previously reported6.\n\t\nPrepare the B-CeP 1 stock solution at ~10 mM. Weigh ~1 mg of the lyophilized compound using an analytical balance located in a fume hood and solubilize it in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nCalculate the exact compound concentration based on the actual amount of compound and DMSO (d = 1.1 g/cm3) used.\n\t\tNOTE: Handle the compound with gloves at all times (both when lyophilized and when dissolved in DMSO)13,14.\nTable 1: Oligonucleotide structures used in this protocol.

Folding of nucleic acid constructs\nPreparation of buffers\n\t\nPrepare a BPE buffer solution (biphosphate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 5x: 2 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4) and a solution of 500 mM KCl in ultrapure water. Filter the solutions through 0.22 \u00b5m pore size filters.NOTE: For best results, use freshly prepared solutions. BPE buffer can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 15 days.\nFolding of G4-TBA, ssTBA, and dsTBA samples by the heat-refolding procedure\n\tNOTE: Potassium cations are necessary to fold the G4 structure (G4-TBA). Do not add potassium cations in the folding solution of the controls ssTBA and dsTBA.\n\t\nPrepare 40 \u00b5L of a 4 \u00b5M solution of G4-TBA in 1x BPE and 100 mM KCl. Denature the oligonucleotide G4-TBA solution by heating the tube to 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and slowly cool it down to room temperature (RT) to allow the TBA to fold into G-quadruplexes.\nPrepare 40 \u00b5L of a 4 \u00b5M solution of ssTBA in 1x BPE. Perform the heat-refolding procedure, as mentioned in step 2.2.1, to fold TBA in its single-stranded form.\nPrepare 40 \u00b5L of a 4 \u00b5M solution of dsTBA by mixing equimolar amounts of TBA and cTBA in 1x BPE. Perform the heat-refolding procedure as mentioned above (step 2.2.1) for TBA to anneal to its complementary sequence cTBA and form the double-stranded form of TBA.\n\t\tNOTE: The final volume of each folding solution is based on the number of samples for the probing reactions, considering that 5 \u00b5L of 4 \u00b5M solution will be needed for each sample. Prepare a little excess volume of each solution to avoid pipetting errors.\n3. Probing reactions\nNOTE: Probing reactions must be done immediately after the heat-refolding procedure.\nWhen the folding solutions of G4-TBA, ssTBA, and dsTBA have cooled to RT, perform a short-spin centrifugation (7,000 \u00d7 g for 5-8 s at RT) and start the probing reactions.\nPrepare 21 empty 0.5 mL autoclaved tubes. Organize them in three sets of seven tubes each in the rack for lab samples, as reported in Table 2.NOTE: Each column set corresponds to the three different TBA folding conditions G4-TBA, ssTBA, and dsTBA. Each row corresponds to three different incubation times. Each cell within the column corresponds to the final B-CeP 1 probe concentration (Table 2). Make sure to clearly label the tubes.\nAdd 3 \u00b5L of ultrapure water in each tube.\nAdd 5 \u00b5L of folded G4-TBA in each tube of the first set (step 3.2). Add 5 \u00b5L of folded ssTBA in each tube of the second set. Add 5 \u00b5L of folded dsTBA in each tube of the third set.\nDilute the B-CeP 1 stock solution to 250 \u00b5M and 25 \u00b5M in ultrapure water.\n\tNOTE: Dilutions of the B-CeP 1 chemical probe must be freshly prepared and immediately reacted with the DNA substrate to avoid competing reactions with water.\nAdd 2 \u00b5L of the appropriate B-CeP 1 dilution (25 \u00b5M and 250 \u00b5M) to the samples. Replace the compound with ultrapure water in the three control samples (C) for analysis of the differently folded TBAs in the absence of the compound. Incubate all the samples at 37 \u00b0C.\nAfter 1 h, 4 h, and 15 h of incubation, stop the reaction by placing the tubes at -20 \u00b0C until the next step.\n\tNOTE: The samples can be stored in these conditions for a couple of days.\nDry the samples in a vacuum centrifuge.\n\tNOTE: The dried samples can be stored at -20 \u00b0C for weeks before proceeding with the PAGE analysis.Table 2: Samples for the probing reactions (structures, probe concentrations, and incubation time). Each column set corresponds to the three different TBA folding conditions (G4-TBA, ssTBA, and dsTBA). Each row corresponds to three different incubation times (1, 4, 15 h). Each cell within the column corresponds to the final B-CeP 1 probe concentration (5 or 50 \u00b5M). The control (C) for each set corresponds to a sample of the differently folded TBAs incubated for the longer time (15 h) in the absence of compound.

High-resolution PAGE\nPreparation of the denaturing polyacrylamide solution\n\tNOTE: Prepare in advance 500 mL of 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel solution. Around 80 mL of this solution will be used for each experiment. Use an amber glass bottle or cover a glass bottle with aluminum foil to store the solution at RT.\n\tCAUTION: Polyacrylamide is neurotoxic. During all steps of gel preparation and pouring, wear gloves and a lab coat. Discard polymerized acrylamide in an appropriate box for contaminated materials.\n\t\nWeigh 210 g of urea in a 1 L beaker. Add 250 mL of 40% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (19/1) solution and 50 mL of 10x TBE (890 mM Tris-HCl, 890 mM borate, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8).\nPlace the beaker on a stir plate and mix the solution with a stirring rod. Cover the beaker with aluminum foil during mixing to prevent splashing and contamination.\nMix the solution until the urea is completely dissolved and the solution is clear.\n\t\tNOTE: This step can take many hours. To promote the dissolution of urea, add a small aliquot of water without going beyond the desired final volume.\nRemove the stirring rod. Pour the solution in a cylinder and add water to an exact final volume of 500 mL.Setting up of gel apparatus\n\t\nClean two plates (one notched and one unnotched) with 70% ethanol, let them dry, and then treat the plates with a dimethyldichlorosilane solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Silanization can be skipped, although it helps the release of the gel from one of the plates when the gel sandwich is taken apart.\n\t\tCAUTION: Handle the silanization solution with gloves and carry out the plate treatment with this solution in a fume hood.\nPlace the 0.4 mm spacers along the long edges of the longer plate, place the short plate on top of the other, and align the two plates at the bottom.\nPlace multiple layers of paper tape along all the edges except for the top.\nTo avoid leaks during casting, add an additional layer of tape to the bottom of the gel.\nClip the sides of the glass sandwich with clean clamps following the supplier's instructions (different suppliers use slightly different apparatus, sandwich clamps, and gaskets).\nPouring the gel\n\tNOTE: Pour the gel at RT (25 \u00b0C), since polyacrylamide polymerization is temperature-sensitive.\n\t\nIn a beaker, pour 80 mL of the previously prepared denaturing polyacrylamide solution (step 4.1), 450 \u00b5L of a 10% m/V ammonium persulphate (APS) solution, and 45 \u00b5L of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) immediately before use.\nMix the solution and rapidly pour it down between the glass plates using a 50 mL syringe.

The entry clone was subsequently introduced into the pDEST20 expression vector. As such, ZGRF1 harbors an N-terminal cleavable GST tag as well as a C-terminal (His)6 tag. The two tags enable the use of affinity matrices to greatly facilitate the protein purification process.\nNote: GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 in pDEST20 vector can be obtained from the authors upon request.\nGenerating a Baculovirus and Expressing GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 in Insect Cells\nTiming: 3\u20134\u00a0weeks\nSf9 and Hi5 insect cells are commonly used for protein expression. The major advantages of insect cell expression (compared to bacterial expression) are increased solubility, improved protein folding, and posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. This protein expression platform is particularly useful to express large proteins such as ZGRF1 and protein complexes. Once the ZGRF1-(His)6-pDEST20 expression vector is generated, the first step is to produce a recombinant baculovirus, which is then amplified in Sf9 cells to produce a high-titer viral stock for protein expression. We have found that Hi5 cells give higher yields of ZGRF1 protein than Sf9 or Tni cells (Expression Systems).\nGenerate the recombinant bacmid DNA.\nUse 10\u201325\u00a0ng of the ZGRF1-(His)6-pDEST20 expression vector to transform DH10Bac competent E.\u00a0coli cells using the standard procedure.\nAfter transformation, add 1\u00a0mL SOC medium to the E.\u00a0coli cells, shake the cells at 37\u00b0C at 200\u00a0rpm for 4 h.\nMake a 5-fold and 25-fold dilution of the cells with SOC medium, plate 100\u00a0\u03bcL of each dilution on an LB agar plate containing 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL kanamycin, 7\u00a0\u03bcg/mL gentamicin, 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL tetracycline, 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Bluo-gal, and 40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL IPTG.Incubate plates for 48\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C. Transfer a white bacterial colony into 3\u00a0mL LB culture containing 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL kanamycin, 7\u00a0\u03bcg/mL gentamicin, and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL tetracycline.\nCritical: The incubation time in step 1d is critical. The LB plates need to be incubated at least 48\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C. Shorter incubation time may result in difficulties to distinguish between white and blue colonies.\nIncubate the culture in a 37\u00b0C shaking incubator for 12\u201316 h.\nExtract the bacmid DNA using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions with the following modifications: (i) the 3\u00a0mL E.\u00a0coli culture is resuspended, lysed, and neutralized with 0.3\u00a0mL buffers P1, P2, and 0.3\u00a0mL of 3\u00a0M potassium acetate, pH 5.5, respectively. (ii) Precipitate the bacmid DNA from the supernatant from the last step with 0.8\u00a0mL of isopropanol, centrifuge for 15\u00a0min at 14,000\u00a0\u00d7 g to pellet bacmid DNA. (iii) Wash the pellet with 0.5\u00a0mL of 70% ethanol, remove the ethanol, and air dry the pellet for 10\u00a0min at 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C.\nDissolve the bacmid DNA in 40\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 TE Buffer, pH 8.0, for 12\u201316\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. Mix gently by tapping the tube. The average concentration of bacmid DNA is about 2\u20133\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL.\nNote: The recombinant bacmid DNA could be amplified by PCR for sequencing using Sequencing Primers.\nUse the recombinant bacmid DNA to transfect Sf9 cells to produce a low-titer virus.\nTransfect Sf9 cells in a 6-well plate with the bacmid DNA using Invitrogen Cellfectin II Reagent according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Importantly, set up a negative control well without bacmid DNA.After transfection, incubate the cells in a 27\u00b0C humidified incubator for 8\u20139\u00a0days until signs of viral infection are visible. On day 4\u20135 after transfection, add 0.5\u20131\u00a0mL fresh medium to support the growth of the cells and to prevent the wells from drying out. On day 8\u20139, the control Sf9 cells should become saturated in the well, while the transfected Sf9 cells should be larger in size and with lower confluence (\u223c50% confluence).\nCollect the primary virus (P1 viral stock) by centrifugation at 500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to remove cells and debris. The P1 viral stock can be stored at 4\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u00a0months.\nAmplify the viral stocks to generate a high-titer virus.\nGrow Sf9 cells to the density of 2\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells/mL. Transfer 30\u00a0mL of cells into a 175\u00a0cm2 cell culture flask. Swirl the flask gently and place it in a 27\u00b0C humidified incubator for 30\u00a0min to allow attachment of cells.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL of P1 viral stock into the Sf9 cell culture flask and swirl the flask gently.\nIncubate the cells for 6\u20137\u00a0days in a 27\u00b0C humidified incubator or until about 40%\u201350% cells appear lysed.\nCollect the 30\u00a0mL of the Sf9 cell culture medium and transfer to sterile 50\u00a0mL snap-cap tubes. Centrifuge the tubes at 500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to remove cells and debris. This is the P2 viral stock and could be stored at 4\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u00a0months.\nRepeat the process to generate the P3 viral stock.\nCritical: The P3 viral stock should be made fresh and used for protein expression within 2\u20133\u00a0weeks.\nExpress the recombinant GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 in Hi5 cells.An expression test experiment could be performed before large-scale expression by infecting 5\u00a0\u00d7 50\u00a0mL Hi5 cells (1\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells/mL) with 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5\u00a0mL fresh P3 viral stock. Incubate the cells at 27\u00b0C at 170\u00a0rpm for 40\u201344 h. Harvest cells and perform an anti-GST western blot to determine an appropriate dilution of P3 viral stock for best expression.\nFor large-scale expression, innoculate 150\u00a0mL Hi5 cells into two 1,000\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flasks and incubate at 27\u00b0C at 170\u00a0rpm. Maintain the cells for 1\u00a0day and expand to 300\u00a0mL (0.6\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells/mL) for each flask.\nIt is important to perform viral infection when Hi5 cells are in the mid-logarithmic phase of growth at a density of 1\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells/mL. Infect the cells with 10\u201315\u00a0mL (or determined by the expression test) fresh P3 viral stock.\nIncubate at 27\u00b0C at 170\u00a0rpm for 40\u201344 h.\nCritical: The infection time here in step 4a and 4d is critical. Longer infection times may lead to aggregation of ZGRF1 and thus reduce the final yield of purified protein.\nAfter 40\u201344\u00a0h post infection, retrieve 10\u00a0\u03bcL of cell culture and examine it microscopically. The infected Hi5 cells should show an increase in cell diameter.\nHarvest cells at 500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nDiscard the supernatant and store the pellet at \u221280\u00b0C. Usually, 600\u00a0mL of the Hi5 cells will yield 7\u20138\u00a0g of cell pellet.\nPurification of GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6\nTiming: 2\u00a0daysHere, we describe the large-scale purification of the recombinant human ZGRF1 in Hi5 insect cells. The procedure exploits the GST tag at the N terminus and the (His)6 tag at the C terminus of ZGRF1. The typical yield of the recombinant GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 from 600\u00a0mL Hi5 cell culture is 50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcg. The GST tag could be removed by TEV protease if desired. All the purification steps are conducted at 0\u00b0C\u20134\u00b0C.\nPreparation of cell lysate.\nPrepare 100\u00a0mL Protein Lysis Buffer and keep on ice.\nThaw the frozen cells (\u223c8 g) and resuspend cells in the chilled Protein Lysis Buffer.\nTransfer the suspension into a beaker placed on ice.\nStir the mixture at 4\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min using a magnetic stirrer gently.\nSonicate the mixture at 50 amplitude with a 1/2 inch diameter probe, for 30\u00a0s three separate times on ice.\nCritical: It is critical to maintain the cell mixture at low temperature near 4\u00b0C. Keep the mixture on ice for at least 1\u00a0min after each 30\u00a0s sonication.\nClarify the crude lysate at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min. Keep a small aliquot of the clarified lysate for further analysis.\nAffinity purification based on the GST tag.\nPack 2\u00a0mL of Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin into a gravity column.\nWash the resin with 20\u00a0mL of ddH2O.\nWash the resin with 20\u00a0mL of Binding Buffer.\nSplit the equilibrated resin into two 50\u00a0mL snap-cap tubes.\nMix the clarified cell lysate (\u223c100\u00a0mL) with the affinity resin at 4\u00b0C for 1.5\u00a0h on a rotary platform at 40\u00a0rpm.\nCollect the resin in a chromatography column, drain by gravity for about 20\u00a0min.\nWash the resin with 50\u00a0mL Binding Buffer, three times. Combine the wash and keep a small aliquot of wash for further analysis.Optional: Wash the resin with 50\u00a0mL Binding Buffer plus 1\u00a0mM ATP, followed by 50\u00a0mL Binding buffer plus 5\u00a0mM MgCl2 will allow the removal of additional protein contaminants, such as ATP-dependent chaperones.\nElute GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 with 3\u00a0mL Glutathione Elution Buffer at 4\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min by repeatedly passing the eluate through the packed resin.\nRepeat the elution step three additional times with fresh Glutathione Elution Buffer. Keep a small aliquot of each eluate for further analysis.\nAfter elution, take a small amount of the resin for further analysis.\nAffinity purification based on the (His)6-tag.\nPack 0.5\u00a0mL of Ni-NTA Agarose resin into a narrow chromatography column.\nCritical: It is critical to use a small volume of Ni-NTA Agarose resin (\u223c0.5\u00a0mL), as larger resin volume will result in lower concentration of ZGRF1 protein.\nWash the resin with 5\u00a0mL of ddH2O.\nWash the resin with 5\u00a0mL of Binding Buffer.\nTransfer the resin to a new 15\u00a0mL snap-cap tube.\nMix resin with the eluate (\u223c12\u00a0mL) from the previous affinity purification step at 4\u00b0C for 2.5\u00a0h on a rotary platform.\nTransfer the resin suspension back to the chromatography column and drain by gravity.\nWash the resin with 50\u00a0mL Binding Buffer, three times. Combine the wash and keep a small aliquot of wash for further analysis.\nWash the resin with 25\u00a0mL Imidazole Wash Buffer. Keep a small aliquot for further analysis.\nElute the GST-(TEV)-ZGRF1-(His)6 protein with 0.6\u00a0mL Imidazole Elution Buffer at 4oC for 10\u00a0min by repeatedly passing the eluate through the packed resin.\nRepeat the elution with 0.6\u00a0mL fresh Imidazole Elution Buffer. Keep a small aliquot of each eluate for further analysis.\nAfter elution, take a small amount of the resin for further analysis.SDS-PAGE (4%\u201320%) analysis of the samples collected during the purification process (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/175-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. ZGRF1 Purification\nSamples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Loading order from left: Marker, All Blue Prestained Protein Standards (Bio-Rad); GST-affinity Wash and Eluate, wash and eluate sample from GST resin; GST resin, GST resin after elution; Ni-NTA Wash and Eluate, wash and eluate sample from Ni-NTA resin; Ni-NTA 15\u00a0mM imidazole, 15\u00a0mM imidazole wash from Ni-NTA resin; Ni-NTA resin, Ni-NTA resin after elution.\nAlternatives: an alternative procedure would be performing the affinity purification based on the (His)6-tag followed by the affinity purification based on the GST tag.\nDialysis and concentrate.\nNote: Due to the small amount of purified ZGRF1 protein, we recommend dialysis devices to be used to reduce the loss of protein. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nAdd 44.5\u00a0mL Dialysis Buffer to a 50\u00a0mL conical tube and set aside.\nAdd 4\u00a0mL of Dialysis Buffer into the Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Device. Decant the buffer by shaking the device.\nApply the combined protein sample (\u223c1.2\u00a0mL) into the dialysis device.\nPlace the device slowly into the 50\u00a0mL conical tube containing the Dialysis Buffer. Make sure the membrane is in contact with buffer.\nCap the conical tube securely and mix gently on an orbital shaker at 4\u00b0C.\nContinue dialysis for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nChange the Dialysis Buffer in the 50\u00a0mL conical tube.\nContinue dialysis for 12\u201314\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nCollect the dialyzed protein sample. Apply the sample to a Corning Spin-X Ultrafiltration Concentrator (500\u00a0\u03bcL, 50\u00a0kDa cutoff) to further concentrate to \u223c500\u00a0\u03bcL.\nCritical: It is critical not to change buffer using Ultrafiltration Concentrator repeatedly, as this will cause aggregation of ZGRF1 protein on the membrane. Only concentrate it once to about 500\u00a0\u03bcL.Split the purified ZGRF1 protein into 5\u00a0\u03bcL aliquots, freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at \u221280\u00b0C. ZGRF1 remains stable at \u221280\u00b0C for several years.\nAnalyze the purified ZGRF1 by SDS-PAGE (4%\u201320%) (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/175-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Final Purified and Concentrated ZGRF1\nZGRF1 final sample (4\u00a0\u03bcL) was analyzed on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.\nRegulation of Human RAD51-Mediated D-Loop Formation Assay\nTiming: 4\u00a0days\nZGRF1 knockdown or knockout impairs HR efficiency, indicating its role therein (Adamson et\u00a0al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], Brannvoll et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). A D-loop formed between ssDNA and a donor duplex DNA is a key intermediate in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks or damaged DNA replication forks by HR. D-loop formation is catalyzed by RAD51 and multiple accessory proteins, such as BRCA1-BARD1 (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) and RAD54 (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Here, we describe an optimized protocol to investigate the regulatory function of ZGRF1 in the RAD51-mediated D-loop reaction. To accommodate the low concentration of purified ZGRF1, we used a concentration of RAD51, RAD54 and DNA 3\u20134 fold lower than what would normally be used.\nPreparation of pBluescript SK+ plasmid DNA.\nPrepare the pBluescript SK+ plasmid DNA using QIAGEN Plasmid Mini or Midi kit.\nExamine the topological state of the plasmid DNA by 0.9% agarose gel electrophoresis.\nCritical: The D-loop formation efficiency is sensitive to the topological state of the duplex DNA. The supercoiled form of plasmid DNA should be the major form, ideally \u226590% of total DNA.\n5\u2032-end Radiolabeling of the 90-mer oligonucleotide.\nPurify the 90-mer oligonucleotide (5\u2032-AAATCAATCTAAAGTATATATGAGTAAACTTGGTC TGACAGTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCACCTATCTCAGCGATCTGTCTATTT-3\u2032, ordered from IDT, complementary to positions 1,932\u20132,022 of pBluescript SK+ plasmid DNA) from a 10% polyacrylamide gel.\nMeasure the DNA concentration spectrophotometrically. Store the purified oligonucleotide at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\nAdd the following reagents in a 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube on ice and mix.table:files/protocols_protocol_175_2.csv\nIncubate the labeling reaction at 37\u00b0C for 1 h.\nInactivate T4 polynucleotide kinase by incubating at 65\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min.\nRemove unincorporated [\u03b3-32P]-ATP using Micro Bio-Spin P-6 Gel Columns (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nMeasure the DNA concentration spectrophotometrically. Store the labeled oligonucleotide at \u221220\u00b0C (shielded) until use.\nD-loop formation assay.\nNote: Before conducting D-loop formation assays, it is important to ensure that the purified ZGRF1 protein does not contain endo- or exonuclease contamination. Briefly, incubate 0\u20130.5\u00a0\u03bcg ZGRF1 with 10\u00a0nM 32P-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide or dsDNA (of any sequence) at 30\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h in a reaction buffer containing 20\u00a0mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10\u00a0mM MgCl2, 50\u00a0mM KCl and 1\u00a0mM DTT. The reactions are then deproteinized by treatment with SDS (0.1%) and proteinase K (0.5\u00a0mg/mL) for 10\u00a0min at 30\u00b0C and then resolved in a 15% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer. Any change in band intensity and migration pattern of the ssDNA or dsDNA, or appearance of short DNA smear (\u223c1\u20135 nucleotides) compared to the negative control indicate potential nuclease contamination.\nPrepare a master mix of D-loop reaction buffer in a 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube on ice and mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_175_3.csv\nNote: The master mix in the above table is for ten reactions.

In order to express the untagged TET2 dioxygenase domain using the pDONR221 vector, Shine Dalgarno and Kozak sequences were incorporated in the forward primer during PCR (Table 1).\nFor bacterial transformation, add 1 \u00b5L of recombinant pDEST14 expression vector containing untagged human TET2 dioxygenase (TET2 1129-1936, \u03941481-1843) to 100 \u00b5L of chemically competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells in a 1.7 mL tube. Keep the mixture on ice for at least 15 minutes followed by heat shock at 42 \u00b0C for 30 s in a water bath.\n\t\nImmediately after heat shock, keep the cells back on ice for minimum of 2 min. Following this, add 250 \u00b5L of super optimal broth with catabolite repression (S.O.C media) to cells. Incubate the bacterial cells for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in a shaker.\nAfter incubation, spin down the cells by centrifuging the tube at 9,000 x g for 1 min.

Following this, use 100 \u00b5L\u00a0 of culture from the 50 mL tube to inoculate 100 mL of LB-ampicillin media. Incubate the flask at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker at 180 rpm and use it as primary culture. Next day, use 6 mL each of primary culture to inoculate 15 flasks, each containing 600 mL LB-ampicillin media. Now, incubate 15 flasks at 37 \u00b0C on a shaker at 180 rpm.\n\tNOTE: For verifying transformed clones, perform DNA sequencing or restriction digestion with the isolated plasmid DNA.\nTo check the density of bacterial culture, measure its OD600 using a spectrophotometer. After the culture reaches a density of 0.8 at OD600, induce the expression of TET2 protein with 300 \u00b5L of 1 M (final concentration of 0.5 mM in 600 mL) IPTG in each flask and further grow the culture for 16 h at 17 \u00b0C.\nAfter 16 h, transfer the bacterial culture to centrifuge bottles.

Collect the supernatant containing the soluble TET2 enzyme and pass through 0.45-\u00b5m filters before loading on an FPLC system.NOTE: In these experiments, the TET2 enzyme was very stable, but if needed a protease inhibitor cocktail containing 1 mM benzamidine-HCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.5 mM 1,10-o-phenanthroline can be added to the cell lysate to prevent degradation of TET2 enzyme. Avoid using EDTA or EGTA in the inhibitor cocktail as these may interfere with the following cation-exchange chromatography.\nPack 30 mL of a strong cation exchange resin into a FPLC column.

An example plate layout is provided for trial of a possible bacterial growth factor (in our case, mannitol in YCFA-M) against a standard of growth rate on YCFA medium with gut fluid (YCFA-GF). Both the 90-mm and 48-well plates are prepared in aerobic conditions, then depleted of any dissolved oxygen by storage in sealed anaerobic jars gassed with 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 at 5 psi pressure and stored at 3-5\u00b0C. To ensure that new plates are completely depleted of oxygen, they should be stored in the anaerobic jar for at least 2 days.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/673931c4-564a-4d79-ba26-3e2c56f58da6/cpz1463-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nGeneration of solid anaerobic media for culture of obligately anaerobic gut bacteria. The initial reagents (Part 1) are added to the Hungate flask, gassed with N2 using the Hungate apparatus, and then autoclaved. Additional reagents (Part 2) are then added under a 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 atmosphere to generate the base YCFA medium. Different media are generated by adding appropriate growth factors (e.g., mannitol, gut fluid) under the same gas atmosphere. Finally, 90-mm Petri dishes and 48-well plates are generated for use in growth rate measurement experiments.Throughout these protocols, strict adherence to Hungate technique is required to maintain anaerobic conditions. The Hungate gassing apparatus, developed by Hungate (1969[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0023]) and described by Bryant (1972[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0009]), enables aseptic and anaerobic transfer of ingredients between containers outside of an anaerobic hood. This allows generation and manipulation of sterile anaerobic bacterial culture media without the restrictions associated with the use of an anaerobic hood. Details for setting up and using the Hungate apparatus are outlined in Bryant (1972[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0009]). Three pure gas cylinders, separately containing N2, CO2, and H2, are attached to the Hungate apparatus prior to a copper column as outlined in Bryant (1972[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0009]). The ratio of gasses provided through the apparatus to the gassing needles can be adjusted using the dials on the cylinders, which adjust the pounds per square inch (psi) released from each cylinder. The volume delivery of each gas to the gassing apparatus can further be checked using flow meters, which are used to measure the standard cubic centimeter per meter (sccm) for each gas. This allows a precise gas atmosphere of 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 to be maintained.\nMaterials\nSterile water (deionized or autoclaved)\nBacto tryptone (BD, cat. no. 211705)\nYeast extract (BBL, BD, cat. no. 211929)\nAgar (Difco, BD, cat. no. 21430)\n0.6% (w/v) K2HPO4 in distilled water (store 100 ml stock in a Schott bottle for up to 30 days at 3-5\u00b0C)\nMineral mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0003])\nTrace elements (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0005])\n0.1% (w/v) resazurin in distilled water (store 100 ml stock in a foil-covered Schott bottle for up to 30 days at room temperature)\n4% (w/v) NaHCO3 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0004])\n2.5% (w/v) cysteine-HCl (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0001])\nVitamin K3 + hemin mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0006])\nVolatile fatty acids mix (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0007])\nGut fluid supernatant (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0002])5% (w/v) mannitol (Sigma, cat no. 63H01621) (store stock for up to 30 days at 3-5\u00b0C)\nStak-Pak Catalyst (palladium; Coy Laboratory Products, SKU: 6501000)\nStak-Pak Desiccant (Coy Laboratory Products, SKU: 6502000)\nCharcoal, technical, activated for gas adsorption (Fisher Chemical, cat no. 7440-44-0)\nHungate gassing apparatus with (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0003]):\n               \n100-ml Hungate flasks (custom made by Mr. Alistair Mead, Senior Technician, Faculty of Science, University of Auckland)\nButyl rubber stoppers (Thomas Scientific, cat no. 1208Z83)\nAnaerobic jar with pressure gauge (custom made by Mason Tool and Engineering Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand)\nN2, CO2, and H2 cylinders\nMaterate flowmeters for air, bench standing (Glass Precision Engineering, cat no.

Add the appropriate growth factor to make each desired medium for comparison:\n         \nFor YCFA-GF medium, add 10,000 \u03bcl gut fluid supernatant per 100 ml\nFor YCFA-M medium, add 4000 \u03bcl of 5% (w/v) mannitol per 100 ml\nSwirl to ensure even distribution and keep in a 60\u00b0C water bath until ready topour plates.\nYCFA media can be stored up to 90 days at 3-5\u00b0C.\nPour 90-mm Petri dishes\n11. Pour 16 ml YCFA-GF into each 90-mm dish inside a sterile hood and leave in the hood for 30 min to cool and solidify.\nPlates are poured in aerobic conditions. Any dissolved oxygen will be removed from the medium in the next step.12. Store anaerobically for at least 2 days (up to 90 days) at 3-5\u00b0C in sealed anaerobic jars gassed with 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 gas at 5 psi.\nJars are gassed using the Hungate apparatus with a tube attachment that can be inserted into the jar (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0003]). The copper tube can be inserted into one of the clampable rubber tubes attached to the jar. Each jar should contain one autoclave tape\u2013sealed Petri dish full of Stak-Pak Catalyst and another full of activated charcoal to help maintain anaerobic conditions inside the jar. These dishes should be placed at the bottom of the Petri dish stack inside the jar. Catalyst and charcoal should be freshly activated by heating at 150\u00b0C for 1 hr.\nPour 48-well plates\n13. Design the layout of media to be poured in 48-well plates (for an example, see Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0006]).\nGrowth rate experiments require three replicates of each condition at each timepoint, with a no isolate control. A minimum of four timepoints during the growth phase are required to calculate the bacterial growth rate (Hall et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). A 0-hr timepoint may also be useful to check that the inoculum concentration is consistent across wells. There may also be an optional stationary phase timepoint, taken after an isolate has reached maximum growth. This informs the study of optimal culture conditions, as it suggests when growth stopped and the stationary phase began.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ca94e427-432c-4ebc-aad0-8660aa736cb9/cpz1463-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6Example plate layout for growth rate experiment in a 48-well plate prepared in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0001]. Six timepoints (rows A-F) can be tested on two trial media (YCFA-GF and YCFA-M). Timepoints include one at 0 hr, four during the growth period for isolates BP5G and BP52G, and one at stationary phase. Cells reconstituted at McFarland Standard 4 are added to columns 1-3 and 5-7 to give three replicates of each condition at each timepoint. Columns 4 and 8 are used for no isolate controls, which should show no growth and thus rule out contamination.\n14. Prepare the required number of 48-well plates in a sterile hood.\nPlates are poured in aerobic conditions. Any dissolved oxygen will be removed from the medium after it has solidified.\n15. Transfer the prepared YCFA medium variants (contained in Hungate flasks) from the 60\u00b0C water bath to the hood.\n16. Use sterile 10-ml serological pipettes to transfer 500 \u03bcl prepared medium to each well of the plates inside the hood.\nThis step must be performed quickly, as the medium will begin to solidify as soon as it is removed from the 60\u00b0C water bath.\nThe use of a serological pipette allows a large amount of medium to be taken up at once in a sterile fashion, then quickly pipetted into many wells. A multichannel pipette or a 1000-\u03bcl pipette may be used instead, as long as the media can be dispensed quickly and in sterile conditions.\n17. Leave poured plates in the hood for 30 min to cool and solidify.\n18. Store anaerobically for at least 2 days as described in step 12.For our experiments, bacteria were isolated from the hindgut of the silver drummer K. sydneyanus. Specimens were collected off the northeastern coast of New Zealand, where K. sydneyanus is a common herbivorous fish (Mountfort et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0036]). The gut was removed by dissection and allocated into five sections (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0004]) following the guidelines of Johnson and Clements (2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0026]). Microbial collection can take place from segments III, IV, and V, where microbial activity is highest. This was shown by Clements, Gleeson, & Slaytor (1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0013]), where three herbivorous fish were found to have significantly higher concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in segments III-V compared to the earlier segments I and II. Increased short-chain fatty acid concentration is a sign of bacterial fermentation (Clements et\u00a0al., 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0013]). Using this protocol, we sampled from gut sections IV and V and used novel bacterial species isolated from section IV for identification (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0003]) and growth rate experiments (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0004]). YCFA-GF was used to culture the bacteria to single isolates.\nMaterials\nFreshly collected K. sydneyanus\nStak-Pak Catalyst (palladium, Coy Laboratory Products, SKU: 6501000)\nStak-Pak Desiccant (Coy Laboratory Products, SKU: 6502000)\nCharcoal, technical, activated for gas adsorption (Fisher Chemical, cat. no. 7440-44-0)\n90-mm YCFA-GF plates (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0001])\nDissection equipment\nHungate gassing apparatus with:\n               \n10-ml Hungate tubes (glass test tubes)\nButyl rubber stoppers for Hungate tubes (Thomas Scientific, cat no. 1208Z83)\nN2, CO2, and H2 cylinders\nAnaerobic jar with pressure gauge (custom made by Mason Tool and Engineering, Auckland, New Zealand)\nCAM-12 anaerobic monitor (Coy Laboratory Products, cat. no. 6250000)\nVinyl anaerobic chamber, type A glove box (Coy Laboratory Products, cat. no. 7000000)\nDisposable inoculating loops (Thomas Scientific, cat no. 1230Z30)\n20\u00b0C incubator\nCollect fish hindgut contents1. At the fish collection site, dissect gut from fish and divide into five sections (I-V) as in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0004].\n2. Remove gut contents from sections IV and V by squeezing into separate Hungate tubes. Stopper tubes under anaerobic conditions and transport to the laboratory.\nA transportable version of the Hungate apparatus can be used on the boat at the collection site. The Hungate gassing apparatus is connected to a small cylinder containing 90% N2 and 10% CO2 to purge the Hungate tubes of oxygen before sealing with a sterile butyl rubber stopper.\nContents of gut sections IV and V are stored separately to provide precise in vivo location information for a bacterial isolate of interest.\n3. Once in the laboratory, place tubes inside an anaerobic chamber and allow solids to settle (5 min standing time) before moving to the next steps.\nAs the gut contents are collected anaerobically, they can be streaked straight away after the solids have settled.\nThe anaerobic chamber is maintained at an atmosphere of 87.5%, 7.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/H2/CO2\u00a0using gas cylinders. Hydrogen levels are significantly reduced in the anaerobic chamber compared to the jars. This is to reduce risk to user, as hydrogen gas is highly flammable. The absence of oxygen inside the anaerobic chamber is confirmed throughout the process using a CAM-12 anaerobic monitor. Stak-Pak Catalyst and Desiccant should be present inside the anaerobic chamber. These packs are made from wire mesh to allow air to be circulated through the material.\nEverything is done at room temperature to this point. If needed, gut contents can be stored at 19-20\u00b0C until streaking.\nCulture to single isolates\n4. Use a sterile disposable inoculating loop to streak 100 \u03bcl crude gut content onto a 90-mm YCFA-GF plate inside the anaerobic chamber.Disposable loops are recommended because it is difficult and tedious to sterilize loops in the anaerobic hood using an incandescent flaming device.\nThis is culture one of the isolate of interest.\n5. Bring an anaerobic jar into the anaerobic chamber, place streaked plates inside the jar, and seal.\nEach anaerobic jar should contain one autoclave tape\u2013sealed Petri dish full of Stak-Pak Catalyst and another one full of activated charcoal to help maintain anaerobic conditions inside the jar. These dishes should be placed at the bottom of the Petri dish stack inside each jar. Catalyst and charcoal should be freshly activated by heating at 150\u00b0C for 1 hr.\nSee step 3 for conditions of the anaerobic chamber.\n6. Remove anaerobic jar from the chamber and gas with mix of 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 at 5 psi pressure using the Hungate gassing apparatus.\n7. Place sealed anaerobic jar inside a 20\u00b0C incubator for 3 days or until single colonies are visible.\nBacterial incubation should be maintained at the ambient seawater temperature of 17-23\u00b0C, because the gut environment of K. sydneyanus is also within this temperature range (Mountfort et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0036]).\n8. Pick well-isolated colonies and re-streak on YCFA-GF once they grow to a maximum cell number (\u223c3 days).\nThis is subculture one of the isolate of interest.\n9. Re-streak two more subcultures of each colony of interest to produce pure single isolate cultures. Label cultures after each streak to ensure consistency in colony picking.\nAfter the third streak, single colonies are ready for identification by colony PCR followed by Sanger sequencing using 16S V3-V4 primers (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0003]).This protocol describes how to genetically identify the single isolates cultured in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0002]. It consists of two parts: (1) colony PCR amplification with purification and (2) 16S sequencing with analysis. Genetic identification of the isolates enables the results of Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0004] to be analyzed in relation to previous studies on the same species or close genetic relatives.\nMaterials\n16S primers for V3-V4 region (Klindworth et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0029]):\n               \nForward primer (341F) 5\u2032-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3\u2032\nReverse primer (785R) 5\u2032-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3\u2032\nREDTaq ReadyMix (Sigma, cat no.

Transfer the anaerobic jar containing the third subculture of single isolates from the incubator to the anaerobic chamber.\nThe cultures have been incubating in an anaerobic jar under a 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 atmosphere at 5 psi and 20\u00b0C for a period of 3 days or until single colonies were visible. See Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0002] (steps 3 and 5) for maintenance of the anaerobic jar and chamber.3. Place PCR tubes, lids, and toothpicks into the anaerobic chamber.\n4. Touch a single colony with a toothpick and rub onto the wall of a PCR tube. Use a permanent marker to circle the colony on the bottom of the plate and label the circle to match the PCR tube.\nIn this way, the culture of this isolate can remain linked to the genomic identification during subsequent re-streaking.\n5. Attach PCR lids and then transfer tubes from the anaerobic chamber and to a PCR hood.\n6. Add 25 \u03bcl PCR mix to each tube and pipette up and down to mix.\n7. Perform PCR using the following thermal cycler settings:\n         \n1 cycle: 95\u00b0C for 5 min\n25 cycles:\n95\u00b0C for 30 s\n55\u00b0C for 30 s\n72\u00b0C for 30 s\n1 cycle: 72\u00b0C for 30 min\nFinal step: 12\u00b0C (hold)\n8. Use a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit to purify DNA and elute with 30 \u03bcl PCR-grade water.\n9. Quantify the DNA on a nanospectrophotometer and adjust to an optimum concentration of 5-20 ng/\u03bcl using PCR-grade water.\nThe optimum purity (A260/A280) is 1.8 or above.\nPerform 16S sequence analysis\n10. Send purified samples (along with F341 and R806 V3-V4 primers) for Sanger sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene at a sequencing facility.\n11. Perform species identification by using BLAST to compare and align the 16S sequences to the NCBI public database.If the isolate is a known species, there will be a 16S rRNA genetic sequence match in the database. In this case, further experimental work will add to the current knowledge of this species. If the isolate is a novel genus or species, its relatedness to known species can be found using BLAST and Geneious analysis. Currently, the cutoff for a novel species and genus is a sequence identity of 98.7% and 94.5%, respectively (Yarza et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0053]). Further experimental work on novel isolates will provide new information on previously uncultured species.\n12. Perform computational analysis of 16S sequencing data by using Geneious bioinformatics software to generate phylogenetic trees.\nPhylogenetic trees should include 16S sequences from the NBCI database, along with any unpublished sequences that have been identified previously using these methods. Generation of a phylogenetic tree informs future work on the isolate. If close relatives are found within the database, then previously published studies will inform the choice of medium for culturing these bacteria. Phylogenetic trees generated from many bacteria isolated from the same environment will give insight to the microbiome of the environment.This is a high-throughput protocol measuring the growth rates of fastidious anaerobic gut bacteria on different solid media. Growth effects of various nutrient additions can be compared to develop an optimal medium. In this protocol, YCFA (Duncan et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0015]) with gut fluid (YCFA-GF) is used as a standard against which novel media are compared. YCFA-GF often produces optimal growth rates of bacteria in vitro, as gut fluid replicates the natural nutrient environment of gut bacteria in vivo. However, as the nutrient content of fish gut fluid is variable (Egerton et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0016]), it is an unreplicable medium. This protocol allows a replicable medium with commercially sourced ingredients to be developed for any gut bacteria of interest. Importantly, strict anaerobic conditions are maintained at all times. Fish hindgut bacteria, cultured to single isolates and genetically identified using Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0003], are tested for growth rate on two solid media: YCFA-GF and YCFA containing mannitol (YCFA-M). Mannitol was chosen as an ingredient of interest for reasons explained in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0001].In this protocol, determination of bacterial growth rate on solid media is based on methods developed for anaerobic bacterial culture by Casciato et\u00a0al. (1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0010]). This group used water containing 0.1% gelatin (water-gel) to wash bacteria from the surface of solid medium in a Petri dish. Approximate cell density in the water-gel suspension was measured by converting the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) to approximate colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml) with the widely used McFarland standards (Casciato et\u00a0al., 1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0010]; McFarland, 1907[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0032]). Using a single McFarland standard for all inocula within an experiment is important to maintain consistency and produce directly comparable results between isolates and conditions. Here, we have adjusted the inoculum to a cell density of McFarland standard 4 (\u223c1.24 \u00d7 109 CFU/ml) based on the growth success of our isolate in the preculture stage. However, any of the four McFarland standards can be chosen, and a lower McFarland standard can be used if the isolate of interest grows poorly.\nThis protocol applies principles from Casciato et\u00a0al. (1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0010]) to a high-throughput method with 48-well plates, allowing triplicate replicates and testing of multiple factors under the same conditions. Another novel development in this protocol is that there is no need for physical McFarland standards. These have been replaced with Equations 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0002], which we generated by graphing McFarland standards on an exponential curve against their approximate CFU/ml concentrations. These equations speed up and simplify the calculation of bacterial growth rates.For isolates with exponential growth, equations are provided to calculate growth rates as either a doubling time (in hr) or a growth rate constant (\u03b1 in min-1), two long-established ways to express bacterial growth rates (Hall et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). However, because previously uncultured anaerobic bacteria are often slow growing, the usual exponential growth profile may not apply. For isolates with linear growth, such as isolates BP5G and BP52G, bacterial growth rate can be calculated as an increase in colony forming units over time (CFU/hr). All of these growth rates will allow direct comparison of the growth effects of medium ingredients in order to develop an optimal medium.\nGrowth rates are estimates and interpreting them requires some judgement, as many confounding factors can affect absorbance readings and therefore growth rate calculations (Hall et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). Hall et\u00a0al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]) recommend that results can be considered unreliable if the standard error is >3% of growth or if the correlation coefficient is <0.995.\nMaterials\nSingle colony isolates to be tested (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0002])\n90-mm YCFA-GF plates (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0001])\nWater-gel (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-rec-0008])\n48-well plate(s) with media to be tested (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0001])\nAnaerobic hood\nDisposable sterile inoculating loops (Thomas Scientific, cat. no. 1230Z30)\nDisposable sterile delta cell spreader (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 50-751-5036, optional)\n20\u00b0C incubator\n2-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf Safe-Lock tubes, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Working in an anaerobic hood, use disposable inoculating loops to streak single colony isolates onto separate 90-mm Petri dishes containing solid YCFA-GF medium (one isolate per plate). Streak isolates over the entire plate.2. Place inoculated dishes in an anaerobic jar inside an anaerobic chamber.\nSee Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-prot-0002] (steps 3 and 5) for details about maintaining anaerobic conditions inside an anaerobic jar and chamber.\n3. Remove sealed jar from the anaerobic chamber and gas with 47.5%, 47.5%, 5% (v/v/v) N2/CO2/H2 at 5 psi using the Hungate apparatus with copper tube inserted into the jar (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0003]).\n4. Place sealed jar in a 20\u00b0C incubator for 3 days or to peak growth phase of the chosen isolates under these conditions.\nBacterial incubation should be maintained at the ambient seawater temperature of 17-23\u00b0C, because the gut environment of K. sydneyanus is also within this temperature range (Mountfort et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0036]).\n5. Inside the anaerobic chamber, pipette 2000 \u03bcl water-gel onto each dish with an isolate culture. Resuspend bacteria in the water-gel by gently rubbing the surface with a disposable cell spreader or inoculating loop.\n6. Tip the dish to gather all of the suspension at one side, then pipette the suspension from just above the agar layer and transfer to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n7. Transfer 100 \u03bcl to a 96-well plate, then remove from the anaerobic chamber and measure the absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) in an absorbance microplate reader. Use 100 \u03bcl sterile water-gel in a second well as a blank reference.\nThe volume of sample in the 96-well plate must remain consistent as the distance the light has to travel affects the absorbance readings. The same volume should be used for absorbance readings in the 96-well plate at all stages of the protocol.\n8. Calculate the preculture cell concentration using Equation 1:\n         \nformula:\n\\begin{equation} {\\rm{Cell}}\\;{\\rm{density}}\\;(\\times {10^8}\\;{\\rm{CFU}}/{\\rm{ml}}) = 1.1449\\;{\\rm e^{3.5633 \\times \\left( {{\\rm{OD}}600} \\right)}} \\end{equation}This equation explains the exponential relationship between approximate cell density and absorbance at 600 nm among the widely used McFarland standards (Casciato et\u00a0al., 1975[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0010]; McFarland, 1907[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0032]). It is the equation of the exponential trendline from a graph plotting these two variables against one another for each of the four McFarland standards.\n9. Calculate the amount of water-gel needed to reconstitute a cell pellet from the water-gel sample to McFarland standard 4 (\u223c12.4 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml) using Equation 2:\n         \nformula:\n\\begin{equation} {\\rm{Volume\\;water - gel\\;}}\\left( {{\\rm{ml}}} \\right) = 2\\;{\\rm{ml}}\\; \\times \\;\\frac{{{\\rm{cell\\;density\\;of\\;sample\\;}}\\left({{{10}^8}\\;{\\rm{CFU/ml}}} \\right)}}{{\\left( {1.24\\; \\times \\;{{10}^9}\\;{\\rm{CFU/ml}}} \\right)}} \\end{equation}\nThis equation finds the numerical ratio between the cell density in the sample and the desired cell density of McFarland standard 4 and multiplies it by the suspension sample volume (2 ml).\n10. Inside the anaerobic chamber, centrifuge the 2 ml of water-gel suspension for 90 s at 1500 \u00d7 g to pellet the bacteria in this sample.\n11. Inside the anaerobic chamber, remove the supernatant, add the calculated volume of water-gel, and pipette gently up and down to resuspend the pellet.\nGentle pipetting is important to minimize sheer stress effects on the bacterial cells.\nPerform growth rate experiment\n12. Inoculate 10 \u03bcl reconstituted pellet onto the solid medium in the appropriate wells of a prepared 48-well plate. Using the example layout in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0006], plate three replicates in columns 1-3 and 5-7.\nEach well is inoculated with the same volume of bacteria at the same concentration, allowing direct comparison of growth rates and analysis of the growth effects of different medium ingredients.\nUsing three replicates reduces the influence of any edge effects that can cause differences in absorption between wells. Columns 4 and 8 are used as no isolate controls.13. Take the t = 0 hr timepoint by pipetting 100 \u03bcl water-gel onto the appropriate wells (wells A1-8 in Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0006]), resuspending the bacteria by lightly scraping with a disposable inoculating loop, and transferring to a 96-well plate.\n14. Measure the OD600. Use 100 \u03bcl sterile water-gel in a second well as a blank reference.\nAbsorbance can be converted to cell concentration using Equation 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0001]. Time zero readings are used for analysis purposes only, not for growth rate calculations, as they are outside the growth period.\n15. Repeat for at least four additional timepoints during the growth phase.\nAs recommended by Hall et\u00a0al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]), growth rate calculations should use a window of at least four timepoints over the growth period, after lag phase and before stationary phase. Growth phases vary among bacteria and must be determined by preliminary experiments on a chosen isolate. For our isolates, the growth phase lasted from 3 to 26 hr and timepoints were taken within this range (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-fig-0006]).\nCalculate bacterial growth rates\n16. For linear growth, calculate CFU/hr:\n         \nUse Equation 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0001] to convert absorbance readings to approximate cell density for each well (\u00d7 108 CFU/ml).\nMultiply these values by 0.1 ml (the sample volume for absorbance measurements) to convert cell density to the approximate cell number in each well (\u00d7 108 CFU/well).\nPlot CFU/well against time and apply a linear trend line. Determine the growth rate (in CFU/hr) as the gradient of this line.\n17. For exponential growth, calculate the first-order growth rate constant (\u03b1):\n         \nPlot the natural log of the mean OD values (lnN) versus time (in hr) using a graphing program.\nUse the software to generate a linear trendline between two points (at times t and 0).\nUse Equation 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0003] to calculate \u03b1:\n               \nformula:\\begin{equation} {\\rm{ln}}\\frac{{{N_t}}}{{{N_0}}} = {\\rm{\\;\\alpha }}\\left( {t - {\\rm{\\;}}{t_0}} \\right) \\end{equation}\nThis equation is generated from the gradient of a straight line drawn between two points at times t and 0 on a graph of lnN versus t during the exponential growth phase as explained in Hall et\u00a0al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). When t is measured in minutes, \u03b1 is reported in reciprocal minutes (min\u20131).\n18. For exponential growth, also calculate the doubling time:\n         \nPlot mean OD values versus time (in hr) using a graphing program.\nApply an exponential trendline to the graph.\nUse the equation associated with this exponential trendline to determine the \u03ba coefficient as the exponential index.\nUse the \u03ba coefficient in Equation 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-disp-0004] to calculate the doubling time:\n               \nformula:\n\\begin{equation} {\\rm{Doubling\\;time\\;(hr)}} = \\;\\frac{{\\rm l{n2}}}{{\\rm \\kappa \\;coefficient}} \\end{equation}\nThe calculation of doubling time (hr) using this equation is from Hall et\u00a0al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.463#cpz1463-bib-0020]). The \u03ba coefficient is associated with exponential bacterial growth.", "1. Basic Cell Preparation\nNote: This step is for standard immunofluorescence detection of the endogenous protein recruitment or modification, and for the use of a cell line stably expressing a fluorescently tagged recombinant protein. For example, Potorustridactylus (PtK2) marsupial kidney epithelial cells stably expressing EGFP-53BP11220-1711 or TRF2-YFP were used in our previous study (Figure 1)32. In the former case, the focus forming region of 53BP1 (amino acid 1220-1711) that contains the oligomerization domain, the Tudor domain, and the ubiquitylation-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, was fused to enhanced GFP (EGFP-53BP11220-1711). This fusion protein recapitulates the damage site recruitment of the full-length 53BP153,54,55. In HeLa cells, fluorescently tagged subunits of cohesin (e.g., hSMC1-GFP51, GFP-Scc1 (Rad21)52, and GFP-SA2 51) must be stably expressed to ensure efficient incorporation into the complex and to recapitulate the S/G2 cell cycle phase-specific damage site recruitment of the endogenous cohesin51.\nSeed any adherent cell type onto a 35 mm tissue culture dish with a gridded coverslip to allow for individual cell identification. Adjust the initial cell number to achieve 60% confluency in 36-48 h based on the proliferation rate of the particular cell line. For example:\nFor PtK2 marsupial kidney epithelial cells (either wild type or those stably expressing EGFP-53BP11220-1711 or TRF2-YFP): plate 2.0 x 104 cells in 2 mL Advanced Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine, 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin), and incubate at 37 \u00b0C with 7% CO2.For HeLa cells with stably expressing fluorescently tagged recombinant proteins GFP-SA2: seed 1.0 x 105 cells in 2 mL Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, and incubate at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Other HeLa cells may also be used including unmodified cells or cells expressing hSMC1-GFP.\nAllow cells to adhere and proliferate for 36-48 h before DNA damage induction at 30-60% confluence (to allow visualization of the grid number). Proceed to Section 4.\n2. Transient Transfection\nNote: Sometimes good antibodies are not available to detect the endogenous proteins. If cell lines stably expressing marker proteins are not available, carry out transient transfections to monitor fluorescently labeled proteins for live cell analyses.\nFor HeLa cells, on day 1, seed 6-8 x 104 cells in 0.5 mL culture media in one well of a 24-well plate and incubate in a 100% humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C and with 5% CO2. See step 1.1 for culture media conditions.\nDay 2, use a mammalian expression plasmid encoding a fluorescently tagged DNA repair factor (e.g., GFP-NTH1 or GFP-OGG1 for base damage32,44,56, GFP-Ku for high dose DSBs57, GFP-53BP132 for relatively simple DSBs, or other proteins of interest fused to fluorescent tag) to perform liposome-mediated DNA transfection. Dilute 0.3 \u00b5g plasmid DNA into 25 \u00b5L of serum-free culture media in a 1.5 mL tube.\nIn another 1.5 mL tube, dilute 1 \u00b5L liposome-based DNA transfection reagent into 25 \u00b5L of serum-free culture media and mix gently.\nMix the diluted DNA and transfection agent gently, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (RT) to form DNA-lipid complexes.\nRinse cells with 0.5 mL culture media once, remove the media, and add 0.5 mL fresh culture media to the cells (as in step 1.1).Add the DNA-lipid complexes to the cells. Mix gently by rocking the plate a few times. Put the cells back in the incubator as in step 2.1.\nAfter 4-6 h, remove the culture media from the cells, and add 300 \u00b5L 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Remove it, add 200 \u00b5L Trypsin-EDTA, and incubate in the 37 \u00b0C incubator for 3-4 min.\nAfter confirming that the cells are detached, add 800 \u00b5L culture media and resuspend the cells by gently pipetting to break up the cell clumps. Transfer the cell suspension to a 35 mm culture dish with a gridded coverslip, and add culture media to a final volume of 2 mL.\nIncubate cells in the incubator as in step 2.1 for 48 h, then proceed to Section 4.\n\tNote: If the expression of the recombinant protein is toxic (transfected cells show round or irregular morphology after incubation in step 2.8), shorten the expression time, and perform laser microirradiation (Section 4) at 16-20 h after transfection as long as the protein expression can be confirmed (for fluorescence detection, see step 4.3). In this case, perform transfection directly in the 35 mm dish. Seed 3.0 x 105 HeLa cells in a 35 mm dish with a gridded coverslip to achieve approximately 50-70% confluence after 30 h. Transfect DNA plasmids, and change media 2-6 h after transfection. Proceed with laser microirradiation 12-20 h later if protein expression is reasonable and cells appear healthy.\n3. Cell Cycle Synchronization\nNote: For homologous recombination repair (HR) proteins, such as Rad51 and cohesin, the recruitment is more prominent in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, in which HR repair takes place51. Thus, to monitor the recruitment of these proteins, cell synchronization to S/G2 phase is necessary.\nS/G2 phase synchronizationUse the double thymidine block protocol for cell synchronization to S/G2 phase50,51. After seeding the cells in a 35 mm gridded coverslip dish (see step 1.1), incubate the cells with thymidine (to a final concentration of 2.5 mM) in culture media (as in step 1.1) for 17 h at 37 \u00b0C and with 5% CO2.\nRinse the cells with 1 mL thymidine-free culture media (as in step 1.1) twice, and incubate the cells in 2 mL thymidine-free culture media for 9 h as in step 1.1.\nAdd 200 \u00b5L of 27.5 mM thymidine stock solution (dissolved in culture media) into the culture media with the cells to a final concentration of 2.5 mM thymidine. Incubate the cells as in step 3.1.1 for another 15 h. Rinse and incubate the cells in thymidine-free culture media for 4-6 h and induce DNA damage (Section 4).\nConfirm synchronization efficiency by using cell cycle markers (Cyclin A2 and B1 for S/G2 and G2, respectively), S/G2 phase-specific DNA damage repair factors (e.g., Rad51 or cohesin), or by IdU/EdU incorporation (for S phase cells)51.\nG1 phase synchronization\nSeed 6-8 x 104 HeLa cells in a 35 mm culture dish with gridded coverslip (step 2.1).\nAfter 2 days, identify metaphase cells, which are slightly lifted and round-shaped, under an inverted microscope using 10X objective and 10X ocular lenses. Acquire images to record the position of metaphase cells on the gridded coverslip.\nAfter 3-4 h, confirm cell division into two daughter cells (in G1 phase), and induce DNA damage (Section 4).\n4. Titration of Laser Input PowerNote: In this protocol, we induce DNA damage using a 780 nm pulsed fs NIR laser system attached to a confocal microscope, or an 800 nm pulsed fs NIR laser coupled to an inverted epi-fluorescence microscope. Although input power (actual irradiance at the laser focal point in the specimen) needed to induce comparable DDR is different in these systems, the basic principle of input power titration is applicable to both, or any, NIR systems32,57. The in situ energy per laser pulse and peak irradiance at the focal point for the two laser systems were in the range of 5.33 \u00d7 10-2-4 \u00d7 10-1 nJ and 7 \u00d7 1010-5.24 \u00d7 1011 W/cm2, respectively32.\nTurn on the NIR laser and allow the laser system to warm-up for 1 h before use.\nPlace a dish of cells on a heated (37 \u00b0C) stage in a chamber that allows CO2 (5%) and humidity (100%) control.\n\tNote: If a CO2 chamber is not available, use CO2-independent culture media for up to 5-6 h. If a heating stage is not available, keep the cells under the microscope for < 20 min and immediately replace into the tissue culture incubator with proper temperature, CO2, and humidity control. These culture conditions may vary depending on the specific cell type used as well as the organism of derivation (e.g., mammals versus amphibians).\nFor live cell analysis of fluorescently tagged proteins, select a GFP filter (450-490 nm excitation, 515-586 nm emission) or Cy3 filter (540-552 nm excitation, > 590 nm emission) for GFP or mCherry-fused protein, respectively, using a 100X or 63X oil immersion objective.\nSearch for cells that have comparable fluorescence signals, reflecting comparable levels of protein expression. Avoid cells that have too weak or too strong expression in order to reduce cell-to-cell variability in fluorescence measurements.Titrate the laser input power.\n780 nm NIR laser attached to a confocal microscope\n\t\t\nUse the software bleach function to target linear tracks inside the cell nucleus for exposure to single laser scans (resolution 512 x 512 pixels, zoom X1, bleached region 50 x 4 pixels, 12.8 \u00b5s pixel dwell time, iteration x1) through the oil objective (100X/1.3 NA).\nAdjust the laser transmission percentage (using the software/hardware built into the laser microscope system by the manufacturer) to 5% without changing any other settings.\nPlace a cell in the center of the field. Click the region of interest (ROI) tool, and draw a line or box (approximately 50 x 4 pixels) in the nucleus using the mouse, and click the \"Bleach\" button to induce DNA damage.\n\t\t\tNote: In subsequent irradiation steps, \"bleaching\" should be increased in 5% increments to 40% or up to 100% if necessary.\n800 nm NIR laser attached to epi-fluorescence microscope\nControl input power through a (63X/1.4 NA) phase contrast oil immersion objective by motorized rotation of a polarization filter introduced in the beam path and mounted on a computer-controlled motorized rotational stage32,39,58.\nAdjust the polarizer angle (\u00b0) and measure the input power (mW) entering the microscope, using a laser power meter. Determine the polarizer angles that provide input powers that range from 20 mW-155 mW at 5-10 mW increments.\nSet the polarizer angle that corresponds to 20 mW input power.\n\t\t\tNote: For our laser system, if the polarizer angle is 40 \u00b0, the input power is 65 mW. Increase input power with 5-10 mW increments.For live cell analysis, go to steps 6.1 and 6.3. For immunofluorescence detection of the endogenous proteins or modifications proceed to Section 5. After the analysis, go to step 4.7 for further titration of the laser power. To analyze the upstream factor requirement, go to Section 7.\n\tNote: Recruitment of BER and NHEJ factors is rapid (within a few minutes) and transient (< ~ 30 min-1 h depending on the factor and < ~4 h post damage induction, respectively). In contrast, the recruitment of HR factors Rad51 and cohesin is detectable at ~30 min-1 h and they tend to persist more than 8 h at unrepaired DNA lesions44,50,51. Thus, it is necessary to examine different time points post irradiation for different repair factors.\nIncrease input power by desired increments (i.e., 5% for 780 NIR laser and 5-10 mW for 800 NIR) as in step 4.4, and repeat steps 4.5-4.7 on a new set of cells to determine the threshold (50% of damaged cells show recruitment) and peak (100% of cells show recruitment) for each protein.\n5. Immunofluorescence Staining\nNote: For detection of covalent protein modification, such as PAR (complex damage marker) and H2AX phosphorylation (\u03b3H2AX) (DSB marker), as well as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD)/(6-4) photoproducts (6-4PP) and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) (crosslinking and base damage markers, respectively), cells must be fixed and stained with specific antibodies. In addition, it is best to confirm the results obtained with the fluorescently tagged recombinant proteins by antibody detection of the endogenous proteins, to distinguish artifacts induced by overexpression of recombinant fusion proteins.\nFix cells at different time points after damage induction (step 4.5) depending on the factors by replacing the culture media (see step 1.1) with 1.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde/1X PBS for 10 min at RT.Caution: Paraformaldehyde fumes are toxic and all work should be done in a ventilated fume hood.\nRemove 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and add 1 mL of 0.5% detergent/PBS for 10 min at RT.\nRemove 0.5% detergent/PBS and rinse cells with 2 mL of PBS for 5 min twice, and incubate cells in 2 mL of blocking solution (10% calf serum, 1% BSA/PBS) for 1 h at RT.\nRemove blocking solution and add 2 mL of PBS to cells, and replace PBS with 250 \u00b5L primary antibody solution of 3% BSA/PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C or 1 h at RT. Use a 1:200-1:500 dilution (typical concentration approximately 1 \u00b5g/mL, empirically determined) for antibodies specific for different DNA damage markers (e.g., \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 (DSB); Ku (DSB, NHEJ); Rad51/cohesin (DSB, HR); CPD/6-4PP (crosslinking damage); 8-oxoG/DNA glycosylases (e.g., NTH1) (base damage); PAR (high dose complex damage)).\nRemove the antibody solution and rinse with 2 mL of PBS for 5 min twice, remove PBS, and incubate with 250 \u00b5L 0.1% secondary antibody in 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h in the dark at RT.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution and add 2 mL of PBS for 5 min twice and keep cells in 1.5-2 mL PBS at 4 \u00b0C for imaging in steps 6.1 and 6.2.\n6. Quantitative Fluorescence Analysis of Immunostained or Live Cells\nCapture images of stained or live cells (n >10) using microscope used for irradiation. For the epi-fluorescence microscope system, use the resolution of 1,344 x 1,024 pixels and save images as TIFF 16-bit files. For a confocal microscope, use 1X magnification; Argon laser for GFP/FITC, HeNe 594 laser for Cy3/mCherry; 512 x 512 or 1,024 x 1,024 pixels for image resolution; scan speed 5, number: 1 for quick scan or 2+ for averaging over multiple scans to improve signal to noise ratio.Use an image analysis programs designed to measure pixel intensity.\nUse the Volume Rectangle Tool to draw a ROI around the damage site in the individual cell image. Use the same size ROI to measure the background fluorescence signal in the nucleoplasm adjacent to, but not overlapping with the damage sites. This is important for normalization of photobleaching associated with the non-confocal microscope system.\nTo measure fluorescence signals using the image analysis program, click \"Volume Analysis Report\" found in the tool box. A new window will appear. Under the \"Data to Display\" section, check only the \"Name\" and \"Density\" boxes. Then click \"Done\" to visualize the measurements.\nExport the values to a spreadsheet program by clicking on the table icon found at the bottom of the Volume Report window and select \"Tabs (excel format)\" for Field Separators and \"File\" for Export Destination.\nTo obtain relative signals, use the spreadsheet program to divide the fluorescence intensity at the damage site (column 1) by that in the control background region (column 2) in the nucleoplasm and subtract by 1 for normalization.\nReal-time quantitative fluorescence time-course analysis using the confocal microscope\nIdentify fluorescently tagged protein-positive cells using the microscope as in step 4.3.\nPerform time-lapse fluorescence imaging before damage and at different time points after damage induction in Section 4. First draw the bleach ROI (for damage induction), then select the \"Acquire>Time Series\" submenu, set \"Number\" as 20, and the \" cycle delay\" as 30 s, choose \"bleach once after first scan\", and then clicking \"start B\". In this case, the first image is acquired immediately before damage induction, followed by 19 image acquisitions at a 30 s interval. Intervals (\"cycle delay\") can be changed depending on the purpose of the study.Once image acquisition is complete, click \"Mean\", and draw the ROI at the damage region. Click \"Show Table\" to get a table listing the intensity within the selected ROIs. Normalize the data by dividing the fluorescence intensity of the damage site at different time points by the intensity of the same region before damage, and subtract by 1.\n7. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection\nNote: Depletion of the target protein is an effective way to delineate the upstream factor requirement for the observed protein recruitment to damage sites (Section 4). Furthermore, the strategy is the best way to address the specificity of an antibody used for immunofluorescence detection (see Section 5).\nDay 1: Prepare 2 wells of HeLa cells in a 24-well plate by seeding 6-8 x 104 HeLa cells in 0.5 mL culture media in each well, one for control siRNA transfection and one for PARP1 siRNA (5'-CCG AGA AAT CTC TTA CCT CAA-3').\nDay 2: Confirm that cells are approximately 40-50% confluent. Perform the first round of siRNA transfection: Dilute 5 pmol siRNA into 25 \u00b5L of serum-free culture media, add 3 \u00b5L lipids based transfection reagent into the tube, mix gently, and incubate for 5-10 min at RT.\nRinse the cells with 0.5 mL fresh culture media once, and keep the cells in 0.5 mL fresh culture media (see step 1.1).\nAdd the RNA-lipid complexes to the cells, and mix gently by tilting the dish back and forth. Put the cells back in the incubator as in step 2.1.\nAspirate the transfection mix, and add 0.5 mL fresh culture media (step 1.1) after 6 h.\nDay 3: Perform the second round of siRNA transfections (see step 7.2). Then, seed 60-100% of the cells into a 35 mm gridded coverslip dish as described in step 2.3.Day 5: Proceed with laser microirradiation using the optimal laser power condition for maximum recruitment of the factor of interest, as determined by Section 4. Typically, efficient depletion can be observed in approximately 60-90% of HeLa cells.\n\tNote: As an alternative and complementary approach, inhibitors, if available, can be used to inhibit the function of the factor of interest32,44. For analyzing the effect of inhibiting DDR signaling, add 20 \u00b5M PARP inhibitor, 1 \u00b5M PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor, or 10 \u00b5M DNA-dependent protein kinase with catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) inhibitor and 10 \u00b5M ATM inhibitor in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the dishes 1 h prior to damage induction. Add DMSO only to control cells.\nSubscription Required.

Tissue Preparation for Immunostaining\nEuthanize C57 BL/6J mice at embryonic day (E) 16, postnatal day (P) 0, P15 and P90 by carbon dioxide (CO2) followed by decapitation (E16 and P0 mice).\nImmediately enucleate mouse eyes punctured with 29G1/2 needle on the dorsal side of the eye. Incubate for 5 minutes\u00a0(min) in 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS) pH 8.0 at room temperature.\nTo make eye cups from P0, P15 and P90, dissect out cornea and lens with fine ophthalmic scissors while eyes are in the 4% PFA.\n\tNOTE: Skip this step for E16 eyes as the eyes are too small.\nFix the eye cups (P0, P15 and P90) and the whole eyes (E16) in 4% PFA for 20 min\u00a0at room temperature. Then wash the eye cups and whole eyes twice in 1 mL of 1x PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\nCryoprotect the eye cups and whole eyes in 1xPBS, pH 8.0 containing 10% sucrose for 1 hour. Keep in 20% sucrose in 1x PBS for 1 hour and then saturate in 30% sucrose in 1x PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\nThe next day, embed the eye cups and the whole eyes in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT), (500 \u00b5L) in cryomolds, snap-freeze in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and store at -80 \u00b0C.\nRemove the molds with embedded eye cups and whole eyes from -80 \u00b0C and allow to equilibrate to -20 \u00b0C for 1 hour before cryosectioning.Cut retinal cross sections (12 \u00b5m thick) parallel to the temporonasal axis through the optic nerve head using a cryostat at -20 \u00b0C.\nMount retinal sections on microscope slides53 and store at -80 \u00b0C.\n2. Immunostaining with 5-mC and 5-hmC Antibodies\nEncircle the retinal sections mounted on slides with a hydrophobic barrier pen. The hydrophobic barrier pen reduces the volume of antibody required to stain the tissue.\nWash the retinal sections once with 200 \u00b5L of 1x PBS for 10 min.\nPermeabilize the retinal sections with 200 \u00b5L of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS (PBS-T) for 10 min\u00a0at room temperature.\nDenature retinal sections for 30 min with 200 \u00b5L of freshly made 2 N hydrochloric (HCl) acid in 1x PBS in a 37 \u00b0C incubator.\n\tNOTE: Careful titration of HCl treatment is needed to optimize the 5mC signal.\nAlways include biological replicates (3-4) while optimizing 5mC signal54.\n\tNOTE: We did antigen retrieval at 4 time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h) and found 30 min incubation is optimal for 5mC signal. Longer incubation with HCl degrades the structure of nuclei leading to inability to localize 5mC signal to the nucleus.\nAfter denaturation, neutralize retinal sections by adding 100 \u00b5L of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) on retinal sections for 10 min.\nIncubate the sections in 500 \u00b5L of blocking solution (5% preimmune normal goat serum in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS) for 1 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber.\nAfter blocking, add anti-5mC; anti-5hmC antibodies diluted 1:500 in blocking solution to the retinal sections.\nIncubate retinal sections overnight at 4 \u00b0C in humidity chamber.The next day wash, retinal sections 3 times (10-15 min each time) with 0.1% PBS-T and then incubate in blocking solution with the corresponding secondary antibodies (Goat Anti-Rabbit and Goat Anti-Mouse IgG, diluted; 1:1000), containing DAPI ( 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) solution (1 \u00b5g/mL) at room temperature for 1 h in blocking solution.\n\tNOTE: Avoid drying of sections during all stages of immunodetection.\nWash the slides three time with 1 mL of 0.1% PBS-T.\nAfter the last wash, mount the sections with aqueous mounting medium under a coverslip and seal with colorless nail polish.\n3. Confocal Immunohistochemistry\nOrient the sections to have the retinal pigment epithelium side of the optic cup always facing one way (e.g., up), for consistency.\nPerform image capture of immunostained retinal sections at 63X (magnification of an objective lens) with 2X or 3X zoom.\nGenerate multiple optical sections of each selected image (z-stacks) in all 3 channels (Red, Green and Blue, RGB) using 0.35 \u00b5m step.\n\tNOTE: The final magnification of a specimen visualized at 10-20X (magnification of an objective lens) will be 63X, respectively, when combined with a (typically used) 10X ocular lens.\n\tVisualize compressed optical stack to locate the 5mC and 5hmC signal", "Excisional skin wounds in rats (Figure 1)Anesthetize the animal with an intramuscular injection with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, respectively) or following the requirements from the local ethics committee.Shave the dorsal region and gently remove two fragments from the skin using an 8 mm diameter circular biopsy punch (the distance between wounds should be approximately 1.5 cm).Note: This procedure should be handled carefully to not damage the muscular layer below the skin.

Scale bars: 200 \u03bcm.", "Primer design Primer design is one of the most important steps for generating a KO. First, find your gene of interest in the associated strain genome and copy the DNA sequence containing approximately 1 kb upstream of your gene of interest, your gene of interest, and 1 kb downstream of your gene of interest. To demonstrate this procedure, FTL_1839-a Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica LVS lipase/acyltransferase-will be targeted for primer design and KO in this protocol (Figure 2A). To generate a KO construct, two primers (named \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d) will be needed to amplify the upstream flanking region and two primers (named \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d) will be needed to amplify the downstream flanking region. Note that primers B and C must be located immediately upstream and downstream, respectively, from your gene of interest as any sequences between primers B and C will be deleted (Figure 2A). However, the locations of primers A and D are much more flexible. Whereas traditional bacterial KO constructs have contained 1 kb flanking regions, we have found that 500 bp flanking regions are sufficient to initiate homologous recombination and gene deletion in F. tularensis. The major advantage of 500 bp flanking regions is that they are shorter than 1 kb flanking regions and, thus, there is less chance for mutations during sequential PCR amplification steps (described below). Primer lengths and locations in upstream and downstream flanking regions are fairly flexible but we have found that the optimum melting temperature (Tm) for each primer should be between 50 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C. For the demonstration FTL_1839 KO construct, the Tm for each primer is between 55 and 56 \u00b0C (Figure 2B-C). Melting temperature calculations only should be based on primer regions homologous to the genomic sequence and should exclude engineered restriction sites and other primer modifications.When the four primer regions have been selected, Primers A and D should be modified by adding Apa I restriction sites (GGGCCC; indicated by orange nucleotides in Figure 2C) immediately 5\u2019 of the genomic sequence and a six random nucleotide extension should be added to the 5\u2019 end of each primer to facilitate restriction digest efficiency (indicated by grey nucleotides in Figure 2C). The 5\u2019 ends of Primers B and C should be modified to include sequences from the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the FLP recombination target (FRT)-flanked Pfn-kanamycin resistance cassette (FRT-Pfn-kan-FRT) from pLG66a (Gallagher et al., 2008; indicated by purple nucleotides in Figure 2C). Two additional primers, Kan5\u2019 and Kan3\u2019 (Figure 2D), are needed to amplify the FRT-Pfn-kan-FRT cassette from pLG66a (see step 2). Given the relatively short length of the above noted primers and small amount of each primer needed for PCR amplification, we typically order 25 nM scale oligonucleotides with standard desalting. Although difficult to predict, it may be necessary to retain the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 ends of your gene of interest to avoid polar effects on upstream or downstream genes. A promoter prediction tool, such as PePPER (http://pepper.molgenrug.nl/index.php/prokaryote-promoters[href=http://pepper.molgenrug.nl/index.php/prokaryote-promoters]), should be used to analyze your gene of interest for cryptic promoters. If a putative promoter is found in your gene of interest, the location of Primers B and/or C may need to be shifted so that the putative promoter is retained following gene deletion.   First-round PCR: Amplification of upstream and downstream flanking regions and the kanamycin resistance cassette   Primers A, B, C, D, Kan5\u2019, and Kan3\u2019 should be suspended in dH2O to a stock concentration of 40 \u00b5M.    F. tularensis genomic DNA should be prepared using Trizol reagent, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and suspended in dH2O.We have tested other genomic DNA extraction techniques and kits but, in our experience, Trizol reagent yields the highest quality DNA (260 nm / 280 nm ratio between 1.8 and 2.0).   PCR amplifications should be performed using a high-fidelity Taq polymerase, such as Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Life Technologies).PCR reactions typically contain 0.2 \u00b5M of each primer and 100 to 250 ng of F. tularensis DNA.   In the first round of PCR amplifications, three reactions are performed:    Primers A and B are used to amplify the upstream flanking region from F. tularensis DNA (Figure 3A);    Primers C and D are used to amplify the downstream flanking region from F. tularensis DNA (Figure 3A);    Primers Kan5\u2019 and Kan3\u2019 are used to amplify the FRT-Pfn-kan-FRT cassette from pLG66a (plasmid purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and eluted using provided EB buffer; Gallagher et al., 2008; Figure 3A).  PCR amplification should be performed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150621/20150621021219_3260.jpg Figure 2.

C.Following primer location selection, Primers A and D should be modified to aid in cloning and primers B and C should be modified for inclusion of a kanamycin resistance gene between the upstream and downstream regions. For all primers, the F. tularensis subsp. holarctica LVS genomic sequence is indicated by bolded and underlined nucleotides. For Primers A and D, random nucleotide extensions on the 5\u2019 ends of each primer are indicated by grey nucleotide letters and Apa I restriction sites (GGGCCC) are indicated by orange nucleotide letters. For Primers B and C, the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, respectively, of the kanamycin resistance gene (nucleotides in purple) have been added to the 5\u2019 ends of each primer for subsequent inclusion of the kanamycin resistance gene between the two flanking regions (described in step 4). D. Primers Kan5\u2019 and Kan3\u2019 for amplification of the kanamycin cassette, FRT-Pfn-kan-FRT, from pLG66a.      Correct length products should be purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. For PCR amplifications that result in multiple bands, the correct length product should be excised from the agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Alternatively, PCR amplification conditions can be optimized by adjusting the annealing temperature 1 to 5 \u00b0C to improve PCR product quality and quantity.   Correct length products should be purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. For PCR amplifications that result in multiple bands, the correct length product should be excised from the agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Alternatively, PCR amplification conditions can be optimized by adjusting the annealing temperature 1 to 5 \u00b0C to improve PCR product quality and quantity.     Second-round PCR: Splicing-Overlap Extension (SOE) PCR SOE PCR (Horton et al., 2013) is used to fuse the A-B upstream flanking region, the FRT-Pfn-kan-FRT cassette, and the C-D downstream flanking region into one large amplicon, termed a \u201ctripod\u201d (Figure 3B).    As noted above, this PCR amplification should be performed using a high-fidelity Taq polymerase, such as Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity. In addition, rapid temperature ramping (> 3 \u00b0C/sec) is necessary for SOE PCR due to length of the tripod (approx. 2.5 kb) and difficulty annealing three DNA fragments into one tripod template.    For the SOE PCR reaction, we typically add 25 ng/500 bp of each first-round PCR product to the reaction and 0.2 \u00b5M of Primer A and D. Based on previous results, SOE PCR reactions require 30 to 40% more Taq polymerase to yield sufficient PCR product for subsequent cloning.

Apa I restriction digestion of the tripod and suicide plasmid pTP163, Antarctic Phosphatase treatment of pTP163, and ligation to generate the KO plasmid.Following SOE PCR amplification, verify tripod length and purity by separating a portion of the SOE PCR reaction on agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. For the demonstration FTL_1839 KO construct, the expected tripod length is 2,484 bp. Correct length products should be purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. SOE PCR amplifications often result in multiple bands, thus the correctly sized product should be excised from the agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Troubleshooting notes:    Based on the overall tripod length (approx. 2.5 kb), the extension times in PCR Step 4 theoretically could be 2 min to 2 min 30 sec. However, we have found that longer extension times (3 min 30 sec) increase the tripod yield and reduce the amount of non-specific amplicons in the final PCR product.    We also have found that a suboptimal (2 to 6 \u00b0C lower than the Tm) annealing temperature in PCR Step 3, followed by an optimal annealing temperature in PCR Step 6 increases tripod yield and reduces the amount of non-specific amplicons in the final PCR product. We presume that less stringent assembly and replication of the tripod are necessary during the initial rounds of SOE PCR (PCR steps 2-4; Figure 3B) but that more stringent conditions are needed during the final SOE amplification steps (PCR steps 5-7; Figure 3B) for efficient and specific tripod generation. Annealing temperatures in PCR steps 3-6 need to be carefully optimized for each SOE PCR reaction.       Purify the suicide plasmid, pTP163   While completing steps 1 through 3 above, the suicide plasmid pTP163 (contains a hygromycin resistance gene and the sacB sucrose sensitivity gene (Robertson et al., 2013)) should be purified for cloning. pTP163 can be transformed and replicated in any standard E. coli cloning strain, such as DH5\u03b1.Bacterial stocks should be made in LB broth containing 15% glycerol and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use.    Plate a small scraping from the freezer stock onto LB agar plates containing 200 mg/L hygromycin (LB-hyg plates), incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C, pick a single colony, inoculate into 5 ml LB broth containing 200 mg/L hygromycin, incubate overnight (O/N) with shaking, and purify pTP163 using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit.     Apa I restriction digest of the tripod and pTP163 In this step, both the tripod (from step 3) and pTP163 (from step 4) are digested with Apa I for cloning (Figure 3C). To obtain enough product after restriction digestion, 2 \u00b5g of tripod and 2 \u00b5g of pTP163 should be added to each reaction. Restriction digest conditions are as follows: 2 \u00b5g DNA (pTP163 or tripod) 5 \u00b5l 10x CutSmart Buffer 0.5 \u00b5l Apa I (New England Biolabs, 50,000 units/ml, 25 units) Add molecular grade water to 50 \u00b5l total Incubate at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min Following the 30 min incubation at 25 \u00b0C, only the tripod digestion should be purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. Immediately proceed to step 6 with the Apa I-digested pTP163.   Antarctic Phosphatase treatment of pTP163   Immediately following 30 min of incubation at 25 \u00b0C, the Apa I digest of pTP163 should be heat-inactivated at 65 \u00b0C for 20 min. We have found that, following Apa I restriction digestion, heat inactivation of Apa I is needed to reduce pTP163 degradation.    Following heat-inactivation, pTP163 should be treated with Antarctic Phosphatase to avoid self-ligation (Figure 3C). Add the following Antarctic Phosphatase components to the heat-inactivated pTP163 tube as follows: 1 \u00b5l Antarctic phosphatase (5,000 units/ml, 5 units) 5.5 \u00b5l 10x Antarctic phosphatase reaction buffer Incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h   Following Antarctic phosphatase treatment, purify pTP163 using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit.     Ligate tripod and pTP163 To ensure successful ligation of the tripod and pTP163 (Figure 3C), we typically perform three separate ligations at the same time, with different ratios of tripod to pTP163 (e.g., 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1). Ligation conditions are as follows: 9 \u00b5l tripod (from step 5) and pTP163 (from step 6) mixture 1 \u00b5l 10x T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer 0.4 \u00b5l T4 DNA ligase (400,000 units/ml, 160 units) Incubate at 22 \u00b0C for 1 h   Transform KO construct into standard E. coli cloning strain Each ligation product should be transformed into an aliquot of a standard cloning strain of E. coli. We typically use NEB 10-beta competent E. coli. Transformation procedures are as follows:   Add 10 \u00b5l of each ligation product to 20 \u00b5l of competent E. coli.   Gently mix the cells and incubate on ice for 30 min.   Heat shock at 42 \u00b0C for 30 sec.   Place cells back on ice and immediately add 1 ml SOC medium (included in NEB 10-beta competent E. coli package).   Incubate the transformed cells at 37 \u00b0C with vigorous shaking for 1 h to recover.   Plate 500 \u00b5l of transformation onto a LB agar plate containing 30 mg/L kanamycin (LB-kan30 plate) and incubate O/N at 37 \u00b0C.     KO plasmid purification for diagnostic PCR and restriction digest   After overnight incubation, select up to five single colonies (depending on the number of colonies that grew on the plate) for plasmid purification and diagnostic screening.    Inoculate each colony into 5 ml of LB broth containing 30 mg/L kanamycin, incubate O/N with shaking at 37 \u00b0C and purify plasmids using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit.We typically use GoTaq Green for diagnostic PCR. To confirm that kanamycin-resistant colonies contain A-B upstream flanking regions or C-D downstream flanking regions, diagnostic PCR is performed as follows (in this example, only the A-B upstream flanking region is amplified): 1 \u00b5l of 4 \u00b5M Primer A (0.2 \u00b5M final) 1 \u00b5l of 4 \u00b5M Primer B (0.2 \u00b5M final) 0.5 \u00b5l purified plasmid (100-150 ng) 10 \u00b5l 2x GoTaq Green Master Mix Add molecular grade water to 20 \u00b5l total PCR amplification should be performed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.   To further validate that the kanamycin-resistant colony contains a full-length tripod, we typically perform diagnostic digestions of purified plasmids. Diagnostic restriction digest conditions are as follows: 500 ng purified plasmid 2 \u00b5l 10x CutSmart Buffer 0.5 \u00b5l Apa I  Add molecular grade water to 20 \u00b5l total Incubate at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min to 1 h   Diagnostic PCR and restriction digests should be verified by separating products on agarose gels containing ethidium bromide.     DNA sequencing to verify KO construct integrity Plasmids from Step 9 that are positive by diagnostic PCR and restriction digest should be sent for DNA sequencing to confirm integrity of the upstream and downstream sequences. This is critical to ensure that no mutations have been introduced into either upstream or downstream flanking regions. Given the relatively short length of A-B and C-D flanking regions, we typically perform DNA sequencing with pTP163-5\u2019 and pTP163-3\u2019 primers (Figure 4). Primer pTP163-5\u2019 binds 117 bp upstream of the Apa I restriction site and primer pTP163-3\u2019 binds 64 bp downstream of the Apa I restriction site.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150620/20150620200658_5843.jpg Figure 4. Sequencing primers used to verify KO construct integrity. Primers pTP163-5\u2019 and pTP163-3\u2019 are used to confirm the sequence integrity of the KO constructs.    Transform KO construct into E. coli strain S17-1 E.coli strain S17-1 is a donor strain for conjugative DNA transfer to Francisella strains. We prepare chemically-competent E. coli S17-1 as follows:   Plate a small scraping from the S17-1 freezer stock onto a plain LB agar plate (no antibiotics) and incubate O/N at 37 \u00b0C.   Pick a single colony, inoculate into 5 ml plain LB broth (no antibiotics) and incubate O/N with shaking at 37 \u00b0C.   Pellet the bacteria at 2,500 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.   Suspend the bacterial pellet in 8 ml of ice-cold 0.1 M CaCl2 and incubate on ice for 30 min.   Pellet the bacteria at 2,500 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.   Suspend the bacterial pellet in 800 \u00b5l of an ice-cold solution containing 0.1 M CaCl2 and 10% glycerol.   Prepare 50 \u00b5l aliquots and store at -80 \u00b0C until use. To transform chemically-competent E. coli S17-1, mix 20 \u00b5l of chemically-competent S17-1 bacteria with 1 \u00b5l of purified KO plasmid (approx. 250 ng; from step 9) and follow the same transformation protocol as outlined in step 8. Following the 1 h recovery, plate 100 \u00b5l of transformed E. coli S17-1 bacteria onto a LB-kan30 plate and incubate O/N at 37 \u00b0C. The next day, pick a single colony, inoculate into 5 ml of LB broth containing 30 mg/L kanamycin, and incubate O/N with shaking at 37 \u00b0C. The following day, a portion of the O/N growth should be stored at -80 \u00b0C in 15% glycerol while 500 \u00b5l of the O/N growth should be saved for conjugation (step 12).     Conjugation   F. tularensis preparation. At least 18 to 20 h before conjugation, plate F. tularensis onto a supplemented Mueller Hinton agar (sMHA) plate (Huntley et al., 2007) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2.The day of conjugation, scrape all the F. tularensis growth from the sMHA plate and transfer to a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube containing 500 \u00b5l of sterile PBS. Using a P1000 (or equivalent) micropipettor, evenly suspend the bacteria in PBS.   E. coli strain S17-1 preparation. Using freshly grown overnight cultures of E. coli S17-1 bacteria from step 11, pellet 500 \u00b5l at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and remove the supernatant. If your E. coli S17-1 needs to be grown from freezer stocks, we have found that it is best to first streak the bacteria onto LB-kan30 plates, then pick a single colony for O/N growth in LB broth containing 30 mg/L kanamycin. In our experience, E. coli S17-1 freezer stocks inoculated directly into O/N LB broth result in poor conjugation efficiencies.   Membrane filter placement. Using sterile forceps, place a 0.025 \u00b5M membrane filter in the center of a sMHA plate. Gently tap the membrane onto the agar surface to ensure contact.   Mixing F. tularensis and S17-1. Transfer 50 \u00b5l of the F. tularensis suspension from step 12a into the tube containing the E. coli S17-1 pellet from Step 12b. Using a P100 (or equivalent) micropipettor, gently pipet up and down 5 to 10 times to suspend the E. coli S17-1 bacteria and prepare a homogenous suspension with F. tularensis. Based on previous experience and bacterial enumeration studies, the ideal ratio of F. tularensis to E. coli S17-1 is approximately 10:1.   Conjugation incubation. Transfer the bacterial mixture from step 12d onto the center of the membrane filter from step 12c. Incubate the sMHA plate, membrane side up, at 30 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 16 to 24 h. The lower incubation temperature is necessary so that E. coli S17-1 will not overgrow F.tularensis during the incubation.     Conjugation recovery and selection for KO construct integration   Following 16 to 24 h of incubation at 30 \u00b0C, use sterile forceps to transfer the membrane filter to a 50 ml conical tube, and wash the bacteria off the membrane filter using 800 \u00b5l of sterile PBS.    Transfer the entire wash volume onto a chocolate agar plate containing 200 mg/L hygromycin and 100 mg/L polymyxin B and evenly spread the inoculum over the plate surface.    Incubate the chocolate agar plate upside down at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 3 to 4 days, or until colonies begin to appear. The purpose of this step is to select against  E. coli S17-1 and select for F. tularensis colonies (F. tularensis is relatively resistant to polymyxin B) that have integrated the KO construct.     Kanamycin selection for colonies containing the KO construct When colonies are visible on the chocolate agar plate, pick individual colonies and streak onto separate quadrants of sMHA plates containing 10 mg/L kanamycin (sMHA-kan10). We typically pick up to 8 colonies for kanamycin selection. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. The purpose of this step is to select for colonies that have incorporated the suicide plasmid pTP163, including the KO construct, into the genome (1st recombination step).   Kanamycin and sucrose selection for colonies containing the KO construct   After 24 h of incubation, individual colonies are rarely visible. Bacterial growth from the sMHA-kan10 plates are transferred to sMHA plates containing both 10 mg/L kanamycin and 8% sucrose (sMHA-kan10-suc).    Better results are obtained when bacterial growth from the sMHA-kan10 plates is heavily streaked onto quadrants of sMHA-kan10-suc plates because this selection step is stringent and may kill many bacteria.    Single colonies likely will appear in 2 to 4 days on sMHA-kan10-suc plates.The purpose of this step is to force the release the suicide plasmid from the genome (2nd recombination step), resulting in either the deletion of the kanamycin resistance cassette (undesirable result) or your gene of interest (preferred result).    Only colonies that retain the suicide plasmid, and thus the sacB sucrose sensitivity gene, will be sucrose sensitive.     Replica plating to select for hygromycin-sensitive and kanamycin-resistant colonies After 2 to 4 days of incubation on sMHA-kan10-suc plates, colonies that are resistant to both kanamycin and sucrose are picked using toothpicks and replica plated onto two separate plates in the following order:   sMHA containing 200 mg/L hygromycin (sMHA-hyg; to ensure colonies are hygromycin sensitive)   sMHA-kan10; to ensure colonies are kanamycin resistant) Heavily streak individual colonies onto pre-labeled quadrants of each plate and incubate at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 2 to 3 days. Sterile toothpicks are used in this step because the colonies are too small to be picked with inoculation loops. Only colonies that are kanamycin-resistant and hygromycin-sensitive should be considered as potential KOs. These colonies should be re-streaked onto fresh sMHA-kan10 plates, incubated for 1 day, suspended in sMHB, and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Troubleshooting note: Sucrose-resistant colonies (from step 15) that remain hygromycin-resistant (from step 16) do commonly occur and are the result of a suppressor mutation which confers sucrose resistance. Hygromycin-resistant colonies should not be further screened as they still contain the unresolved suicide plasmid. If all colonies are hygromycin-resistant following step 16, more single colonies should be selected from the sMHA-kan10-suc plates in step 15 and replica plated onto sMHA-hyg and sMHA-kan10, as described in step 16. If kanamycin-resistant and hygromycin-sensitive colonies still cannot be obtained following Step 16, we suggest starting over with conjugation (step 12).In our experience, conjugation can be repeated up to three times to increase the chances of selecting a KO. However, if kanamycin-resistant and hygromycin-sensitive colonies cannot be obtained after three conjugations, this likely indicates that your gene is essential.     Diagnostic PCR to confirm KOs   Diagnostic PCR should be performed to confirm that kanamycin-resistant and hygromycin-sensitive colonies from Step 16 are genuine KOs.    Genomic DNA should be prepared by placing a kanamycin-resistant colony in 50 \u00b5l of 50 mM NaOH, boiling the solution for 10 min, briefly centrifuging to pellet insoluble material, and transferring the supernatant to a new microfuge tube.    We typically perform 3 separate PCR reactions to verify that the kanamycin-resistant colonies are actual KOs (Figure 5).    Diagnostic PCR reactions are performed as described in step 9, typically contain 0.5 \u00b5l of genomic DNA, and include the following primer pairs: Primers A and D Primers A and Kan3\u2019 Primers Kan5\u2019 and D If your gene of interest has been deleted from the potential KO colony, all three primer pairs should amplify specific-sized targets from genomic DNA. However, if primer pair A and D are the only primers to amplify targets from the potential KO colony, then this colony is unlikely to be a KO. In our experience, it is unlikely that potential KO colonies (kanamycin-resistant, sucrose-resistant, hygromycin-sensitive) will be negative by all three primer pairs. However, PCR conditions do need to be carefully optimized to obtain amplicons with all three primer pairs.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150620/20150620200718_5367.jpg Figure 5.

Three pairs of PCR primers are used to confirm that your gene of interest has been replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette: primer pairs A-D, A - Kan3\u2019, and Kan5\u2019 - D.", "Cell collectionThis protocol is designed for use on ~2.5 x 108 cells or less (e.g., 50 ml of culture at 5 x 106 cells/ml density) of liquid cultures of C. zofingiensis.

If the medium is freshly autoclaved, it can be used directly.\nAdd vitamins to the MS to a 1\u00d7 final concentration.\nAdd BAP stock to a final concentration of 200\u00a0nM.\nMix gently and pour the medium into the Petri dishes (60\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm).\nNote: The MS medium should be cooled down to \u223c50\u00b0C before adding the vitamins and BAP. Steps 2\u20134 should be carried out in a laminar hood. We recommend using the ACM immediately. ACM plates could also be stored at 4\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u00a0weeks.\nCMT live imaging: dissection\nTiming: \u223c4\u20135 h\nChoose plants with inflorescences of about 2\u20133\u00a0cm high for further experiments (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nRemove the outer mature flowers as much as possible using tweezers. Cut the stem at \u223c1\u00a0cm length to the tip, and insert the stem into ACM.\nDissect further using tweezers with extra fine tips, starting from the oldest flowers, removing the flowers one by one carefully until the floral stage you are interested in.\nMove the whole shoot apex to new ACM. Insert the stem into the ACM with an angle that makes the surface of the particular sepal primordium parallel to the medium surface (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C\u20131F).\nWhen finished, pour sterile water into the Petri dish and make sure the apex is under water. Rehydrate for around 10\u00a0min. Remove the water, seal the Petri dish, and move into a growth chamber for a recovery for 4\u00a0h or longer.To dissect the vegetative shoot apex, keep the entire plant with as many roots as possible. If the plants are grown in soil, they should be washed in tap-water before dissection. Old leaves should be cut off as clean as possible using the needle from a 1\u00a0mL insulin syringe (BD). In order to expose the very young leaf primordia (e.g., P1-P3), a fine dissection is carried out to remove the leaves covering the shoot apical meristem, using fine tweezers under the stereo microscope at high magnification.\nNote: When dissecting the flowers, the cutting should be at the basis of the pedicel as close to the stem as possible. To facilitate the cutting, the dissection can be performed under water by pouring sterile water into the Petri dish (from step 3 onward). The dissected shoot apex can be cultured for a long time in order to follow the growth and CMT dynamics (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F). For a video of the dissection process, refer to (Prunet, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nCritical: Fine tweezers and a stereo microscope with high magnifications are absolutely necessary for a successful dissection. The recovery period is important for the visualization of CMTs and should be at least 4 h.\nCMT live imaging: staining the shoot apices (optional)\nTiming: \u223c10\u00a0min\nStaining cell membrane with FM4-64\nDilute the FM4-64 stock solution to a final concentration of 0.33\u00a0mg/mL.\nUse a micropipette to apply 5\u00a0\u03bcL on the flower bud. Close the Petri dish and keep it in darkness for 5\u201310\u00a0min.\nRinse briefly with sterile water for two times.\nStaining cell wall with propidium iodide\nUse a micropipette to apply 5\u00a0\u03bcL propidium iodide solution. Keep the Petri dish in darkness for 5\u201310\u00a0min.\nRinse briefly with sterile water for two times.Note: The cortical microtubule signal is very dense at both the anticlinal and periclinal cell membranes. This property makes it easy to distinguish the cell contour. However, if large scale segmentation and quantification is required, staining the membrane or cell wall will be very helpful.\nCMT live imaging: acquisition\nTiming: 20\u201330\u00a0min\nPrepare the microscope\nWe use upright confocal microscope LSM 700 (Zeiss) equipped with water immersion objectives (W Plan-Apochromat 40\u00d7/1.0 DIC and/or W Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7/1.0 M27) to image sepal primordia.\nClean the objectives with 70% ethanol before starting the experiments using lens paper (swipe method) or high-purity cotton applicator (swirl method).\nPosition the samples\nPour sterile water into the Petri dish and make sure the shoot apex is submerged.\nUse the pipette to blow away any air bubble on the shoot apex.\nPosition the Petri dish on the stage center (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). For the time-lapse imaging, it will be helpful to mark the front position on the Petri dish using a marker (optional).\nAcquisition\nUse transmission light to find the flower bud.\nSet up the pinhole size, laser power, gain, and offset. The detailed settings we used for CMT acquisition are listed below:\nAccording to the strength of signal, use lower laser power as much as possible (e.g., 2%\u201310% of 10 mW laser) to avoid photo-bleaching and sample damage.\nSet the pinhole size to 1 AU (Airy unit).\nFor optimal contrast and to avoid overexposure, we use the range indicator to set gain and offset. The ideal setting is that very few red points (overexposure noise) are in the preview image.We usually select the frame size as 1,024\u00a0\u00d7 1,024 which matches closely the diffraction-limited performance of the objectives. To precisely optimize the frame size, the user can also click the \u201coptimal\u201d button in the ZEN software for calculation of appropriate number of pixels. With these settings, our xy pixel dimensions are 114\u00a0\u03bcm.\nHigh scanning speed under line scanning mode with 3\u00d7 averaging will increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\nAcquire z stacks at 0.25\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm intervals. In our hands, z steps of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm allow volumetric temporal resolution sufficient to capture CMT dynamics while also allowing reasonable 3D reconstruction in both periclinal (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and anticlinal walls (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/434-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03.

Scale bars: 20\u00a0\u03bcm.\nAfter the acquisition, remove the water as much as possible, cover the Petri dish with lid, seal, and put the Petri dish back to the growth chamber.\nNote: Clean the objective before acquisition to make sure there is no contamination on the objective. 63\u00d7 objective performs better in particular on small younger sepal primordia. During acquisition, avoid over-sampling in z steps to minimize the photo-bleaching.\nCritical: Avoid any air bubble between the objective and samples. Bubbles seriously degrade signal quality.\nCMT live imaging: image processing\n3D reconstructionTo visualize the CMT network in 3D, we use the Zeiss software (ZEN, black edition), and choose the transparency rendering mode to visualize the signal at the sepal/leaf surface.\nSurface renderings can also be obtained using MERRYPROJ (de Reuille et\u00a0al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) or MorphoGraphX software (Barbier de Reuille et\u00a0al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTo visualize the CMT organization in anticlinal walls, choose subset of stack using ZEN software, make a 3D reconstruction, and tilt the 3D image properly to show the anticlinal CMT networks.\nCMT anisotropy\nWe use Fiji plugin\u2014FibrilTool to quantify CMT anisotropy. The detailed steps for the quantification can be obtained in (Boudaoud et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCMT immunostaining: tissue fixation\nTiming: \u223c4\u20135 h\nPrepare fixative\nAdd 4\u00a0g paraformaldehyde to 80\u00a0mL MTSB. Dissolve by adding a few NaOH pellets (around 0.1\u20130.15 g) and using a magnetic stir bar.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL 50% glutaraldehyde. Adjust pH to 7.0 with H2SO4.\nAdd 300\u00a0\u03bcL Tween 20 and 300\u00a0\u03bcL Triton X-100. Mix well and fill up to 100\u00a0mL with MTSB.\nCritical: Fixative must be prepared freshly. Seal the fixative during and after the preparation since paraformaldehyde can evaporate and is toxic.\nTissue fixation\nDissect tomato shoot apices under a dissecting microscope.\nDig a hole in a 3% agar plate. Vertically insert a tomato shoot apex from the tissue culture medium.\nRemove leaves older than P3 using the needle from a 1\u00a0mL insulin syringe (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nIncubate the dissected shoot apices in a 15\u00a0mL conical tube with 10\u00a0mL fixative.\nVacuum infiltrate at \u22120.075 MPa (550\u00a0mm Hg) for 10\u00a0min at room temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C). Repeat for a total of 3 times (3\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0min). Renew the fixative each time.\nIncubate in new fixative for an additional 3\u00a0h at room temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C) with the tube horizontally arranged.Discard the fixative. Incubate samples in MTSB for 20\u00a0min with the tube horizontally arranged. Repeat for a total of 3 times (3\u00a0\u00d7 20\u00a0min). Renew MTSB each time.\nNote: Do not include too many samples for fixation in one 15\u00a0mL conical tube. The volume of fixative should be at least 20 times of the volume of samples. Release the vacuum pump slowly to avoid any damage to plant tissues.\nCritical: Fixation must be performed at room temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C). CMTs depolymerize at low temperature.\nCMT immunostaining: tissue embedding and sectioning\nTiming: \u223c3\u20134 h\nPrepare 6% low melting agarose\nAdd 1.8\u00a0g low melting agarose to 30\u00a0mL ddH2O. Heat to dissolve in a water bath at 96\u00b0C.\nStart to prepare low melting agarose 1\u00a0h before the end of tissue fixation. Cool down the melted agarose to \u223c40\u00b0C before tissue embedding.\nTissue embedding\nPour fixed samples of tomato shoot apices into a 6\u00a0cm Petri dish together with MTSB.\nSet a hot plate to 37\u00b0C.\nPut a 44\u00a0\u00d7 44\u00a0\u00d7 7\u00a0mm (L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H) plastic weighing dish on the hot plate. Fill up with melted agarose (\u223c8\u201310\u00a0mL per plate).\nQuickly put samples into the melted agarose with tweezers, and adjust to the desired orientation (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nWhen all samples are embedded, transfer the weighing dish to 4\u00b0C and leave for 15\u00a0min to let the agarose solidify.\nNote: Leave enough space among samples when you embed in agarose.\nCritical: Care should be taken during transferring the weighing dish to 4\u00b0C to avoid the movement of samples in agarose. Plant tissues embedded in agarose can be shortly stored in a sealed plastic bag at 4\u00b0C, but should go through subsequent steps in the same day.\nTissue sectioningTake a poly-L-lysine coated glass slide. Draw a circle on the slice using a PAP pen. Fill the circle with MTSB.\nCut a piece of solidified agarose containing an individual tomato shoot apex using a razor blade. Trim the agarose block to an appropriate size suitable for a vibratome (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nFix the agarose block onto the specimen disc with cyanoacrylate adhesive (e.g., 502 super glue). Also evenly apply adhesive to the vertical faces of the block. Fill the cooling bath with ice, and fill the buffer tray with 1\u00d7 PBS (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nMake agarose sections of 40\u201350\u00a0\u03bcm thickness with sectioning speed at 0.65\u20130.78\u00a0mm/s (set\u00a0SPEED value as 7\u20137.5 for a VT1000\u00a0S vibratome) and the sectioning frequency as 40\u00a0Hz (set FREQ value at 4 for a VT1000\u00a0S vibratome) (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nPick up sections using a brush and load them into the MTSB in the PAP circle (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nPut slides with sections in a humid box.\nNote: Wait a few seconds after drawing with the PAP pen to let the mark dry before adding MTSB. Otherwise, the ink of the PAP pen can mix with the buffer.\nNote: The size of PAP circle depends on the number and size of agarose sections that are collected. To collect multiple sections (e.g., successive sections from one individual sample) on one slide, rather draw the PAP-rectangles which can cover a larger area of the slide.\nNote: Sections are transparent, which makes them difficult to be seen in 1\u00d7 PBS buffer. It is necessary to apply adhesive to the vertical faces of the block to make it visible. The cyanoacrylate adhesive is transparent when it is liquid, and becomes opaque after drying. It thus outlines the transparent section to make it visible in 1\u00d7 PBS buffer.Critical: The PAP circle is hydrophobic, and serves as a holder of sections and liquid. It facilitates the replacement of different buffers in subsequent steps. To avoid evaporation, the slides must stay in a humid box.\nCMT immunostaining: primary antibody incubation\nTiming: 13\u201316 h\nCell permeabilization\nPrepare the enzymatic solution: 1% (w/v) hemicellulose with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in MTSB.\nReplace MTSB by the enzymatic solution in the PAP circle using a pipettor. Incubate sections in the enzymatic solution for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C).\nIncubation with primary antibody\nRemove the enzymatic solution from the slices. Wash sections with 1\u00d7 TBS three times for 5\u00a0min each by incubation without shaking.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution: mouse anti-\u03b1-tubulin antibody is diluted in 1\u00d7 TBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA at 1:800 dilution.\nRemove 1\u00d7 TBS from the slides and apply 200\u00a0\u03bcL primary antibody solution per slide. Incubate the slides in a humid box for overnight (12\u201316 h) at 4\u00b0C.Note: Hemicellulose digests the cell wall, while Triton X-100 increases the permeabilization of the plasma membrane by removing membrane remnants and soluble proteins. Combination of hemicellulose and Triton X-100 treatments increase the penetrance of antibodies. The enzymes used for cell wall digestion and the duration of Triton X-100 treatment should be optimized according to the plant materials. To label CMTs in tomato leaf primordia, we found it was sufficient to treat the samples with 1% hemicellulose and 1% Triton X-100 for 15\u00a0min. To label CMTs in Arabidopsis leaf primordia, samples should be treated with 1% hemicellulose, 0.1% Macerozyme R-10 and 1% Triton X-100 in MTSB for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C), followed by 3\u00a0\u00d7 5\u00a0min wash in 1% Triton X-100 in MTSB. Including a step of cold-methanol treatment after enzymatic digestion can further increase the permeability of the cell wall and plasma membrane, and also facilitates the binding of antibodies (Shimamura, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCritical: The enzymatic solution and primary antibody should be prepared freshly.\nCMT immunostaining: secondary antibody incubation\nTiming: \u223c3 h\nIncubation with secondary antibody\nTransfer samples to room temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C). Remove primary antibody solution from the slides. Wash sections with 1\u00d7 TBS three times for 10\u00a0min each by incubation without shaking.\nPrepare secondary antibody solution: Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG is diluted in 1\u00d7 TBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA at 1:500 dilution.\nRemove 1\u00d7 TBS from the slides and apply 200\u00a0\u03bcL secondary antibody solution per slide. Incubate the slides in a humid box for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in the dark.\nNuclei staining (optional)\nRemove secondary antibody solution from the slides. Wash sections with 1\u00d7 TBS three times for 10\u00a0min each by incubation without shaking.Apply 200\u00a0\u03bcL 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL DAPI per slide. Incubate for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C) in the dark.\nCMT immunostaining: CLSM\nTiming: 2\u20133 h\nMounting\nRemove DAPI solution and incubate sections in 1\u00d7 TBS for 10\u00a0min.\nRemove 1\u00d7 TBS from the slices. Mount the slide with ProLong Gold (1.47 RI) antifade reagent. This mounting media both preserves fluorescence and provides near aberration-free imaging on oil immersion lenses. Cover the slide with a coverslip.\nCLSM\nCLSM is performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope with 60\u00d7 oil objective. We used a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a Nikon Plan Apo VC 60\u00d7/1.40 oil objective. Due to DAPI\u2019s broad emission, sequential acquisition of DAPI an Alexa Fluor 488 stacks is important to minimize bleed-through.\nTo detect Alexa Fluor 488 signal, a 488\u00a0nm laser line is used for excitation and emission is collected at 500\u2013530\u00a0nm. The laser power is 10 mW. The pinhole size is 1.2 AU (30.7\u00a0\u03bcm).\nTo detect the DAPI signal, a 405\u00a0nm laser line is used for excitation and emission is collected at 425\u2013475\u00a0nm. The laser power is 10 mW. The pinhole size is 1.2 AU (30.7\u00a0\u03bcm).\nSet the scanning step as 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm to collect more details of CMTs in each stack. Perform maxima z-projection of generated stacks to obtain the overall organization of CMTs in individual cells or the whole tissue section.\nNote: The amount of mounting medium (e.g., ProLong Gold antifade reagent) should be sufficient to fill the PAP circle. Care must be taken during loading the coverslip to avoid air bubbles which can interfere with the microscopy.Note: The use of oil objectives gives higher resolution of CMT organization than air or long distance water objectives due to their higher numerical aperture. For visualizing CMTs in Arabidopsis cells, it is better to use a 100\u00d7 oil objective.\nCritical: Perform the microscopy immediately after mounting the slides. The antibody signal can fade away and CMTs may depolymerize gradually.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      Differentiation of cardiomyocytes and stromal cells from hPSCs\n    \nTiming: 15\u00a0days\n      This section achieves the differentiation of cardiac cell types over a\n      15-day protocol.\n    \n        On Day 0 of differentiation, pluripotent stem cells should be \u223c70%\n        confluent.

Prepare the deuterated buffer for proteins in the liquid state\nDissolve all components of the buffer in pure D2O.\nIf the pH electrode was calibrated in H2O, adjust the pD according to the formula pD = pH + 0.4 using NaOD or DCl34.\n\tNOTE: The use of D2O instead of H2O might affect protein solubility and the buffer conditions might need to be adapted, (e.g., by a slight change in salt concentration).\n2. Prepare the H2O-hydrated powders of perdeuterated protein\nPrepare the sample holder.\n\t\nThoroughly clean a flat aluminum sample holder with its indium wire seal and screws with water and ethanol and let it dry.\n\t\tNOTE: A flat sample holder is used such that the powder can be homogenously distributed over the surface. The amount of powder should be sufficient such that it can be maintained between the walls and does not fall when the sample holder is placed vertically.\nWeigh the different parts of the sample holder-bottom, lid, and indium wire-separately on a precision balance.\nPlace the 1 mm indium wire seal in the groove of the bottom part of the sample holder, leaving a small overlap where the two ends join (Figure 2A).\nPlace an appropriate amount of lyophilized protein (typically ~100 mg of protein) such that it fills the inner surface of the bottom part of the sample holder.\nHydrate the protein powder.\n\t\nPlace the sample holder in a desiccator with a Petri dish containing P2O5 powder for 24 h to completely dry the protein powder35 (Figure 2B). Weigh the dry bottom part of the sample holder containing the indium seal and the dry powder to obtain mdry.\n\t\tCAUTION: P2O5 powder is very corrosive.Remove the P2O5 from the desiccator and put a Petri dish with D2O inside. Control the mass of the powder regularly to check the hydration level h = mhyd / mdry where mhyd and mdry are the mass of the hydrated powder and dry powder, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: For highly hydrophobic proteins such as insulin, it might be necessary to increase the temperature inside the desiccator to get a higher vapor pressure and reach the desired hydration level h.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 at least three times to properly convert all exchangeable hydrogens to deuterons.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, cycles of freeze-drying and dissolution in pure D2O might be used for better H/D exchange provided that the protein is not affected by it.\nHydrate the powder to slightly above the desired level, let the bottom part of the sample holder with the indium wire and hydrated powder remain on the precision balance, and wait for the mass to decrease slowly to the desired value to get the target h (typically 0.2-0.4 if a medium sized globular protein is to be covered by one complete hydration layer).\nQuickly put the lid on the bottom part and close the sample holder first with four screws to stop the vapor exchange (Supplemental Figure S3A).\nPlace and tighten all remaining screws until no gap is visible between the bottom part and the lid (Supplemental Figure S3B).\nWeigh the sealed sample holder to check for any potential hydration loss via leaks after the neutron experiment.\n3. Perform the incoherent neutron scattering experiment\nDiscuss and double-check the configuration of the instrument needed for the experiment with the local contact some weeks before the assigned beamtime.\nPrepare the liquid state sample.\n\t\nDissolve the protein in the deuterated buffer.Determine the appropriate volume of liquid to be put in the sample holder using water (ensure there is no overflow when the sample holder is closed; Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: The following steps (3.3 and 3.4) describe an experiment conducted on the NBS spectrometer IN16B at the ILL8,9, using a cryofurnace as a sample environment. The instrument control system will change from one instrument to the other, but the working principles remain the same.\nInsert the sample.\n\t\nThoroughly dry the sample stick (Figure 2D), and remove the previous sample, if any, after checking that the ionizing radiation dose is lower than 100 \u00b5Sv/h before handling any material (at the ILL).\nPlace the sample, check for proper centering relative to the beam center (Supplemental Figure S4), and insert the sample stick in the cryofurnace (Figure 2D). Turn on the vacuum pump to reach less than 10-3 bar, and flush out the air inside the cryofurnace by repeating the following three times: fill the cryofurnace with helium gas until atmospheric pressure is reached, and remove the gas again using the vacuum pump.\n\t\tNOTE: In case of a flat sample holder, the sample holder must be oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle relative to the incoming beam. The useful momentum transfer range could be reduced due to absorption and scattering by the cell. A strong neutron absorber such as cadmium can be used to mask certain parts of the sample holder (e.g., screws, thick parts).\nIntroduce some helium gas in the cryofurnace such that the pressure is ~0.05 bar.Acquire data (e.g., using NOMAD on IN16B at the ILL, it is assumed that the user prefers a temperature of 200 K before acquiring a quasielastic neutron spectrum (QENS) spectrum, then E/IFWS during a temperature ramp to 310 K at 0.5 K per min and finally a QENS at 310 K).\n\t\nUsing NOMAD, in the execution tab, drag and drop a FurnaceCryostat controller in the Launch Pad. Set the temperature to 200 K. Use the fast mode and a timeout of 30 min such that the temperature has time to stabilize. Click on the rotating arrows icon to run it in the background such that data can be acquired during the temperature decrease.\nDrag and drop the IN16DopplerSettings controller, set the speed profile to Accurate velocity set by Max \u0394E, a value of 0.00 \u00b5eV and 128 channels to obtain an EFWS configuration.\nDrag and drop a Count controller, fill the Subtitle field with a name that allows easy identification of the data, and set 60 repetitions of 30 s scans (Supplemental Figure S5A).\nDrag and drop an IN16DopplerSettings controller, set the speed profile to Sine set by Speed with a value of 4.5 m/s and 2,048 channels to obtain a QENS configuration.\nDrag and drop a Count controller with 4 repetitions of 30 min scans (Supplemental Figure S5B).\nFor the temperature ramp, drag and drop a FurnaceCryostat controller, set the temperature to 310 K, set Ramp to SetPoint with \u0394 = 0.05 K and 6 s. Use a time out of 220 min (Supplemental Figure S6A).Use a for loop with 65 repetitions. Inside, insert an IN16DopplerSettings controller as in step 3.4.2, followed by a single count of 30 s. Subsequently, insert IN16DopplerSettings, as described previously but using an energy offset of 1.5 \u00b5eV and 1,024 channels followed by a single count of 3 min (Supplemental Figure S6B).\nTo acquire the last QENS at 310 K, drag and drop IN16DopplerSettings and Count controllers configured as described in steps 3.4.4 and 3.4.5, respectively.\nPress the start button (right triangle on the bottom of the window) to run the script.\n\t\tNOTE: Every experiment will require the acquisition of calibration data; that is, the empty cell for subtraction or absorption corrections, the buffer alone at the different temperatures used to model the background, and a measurement of vanadium (or equivalently, the sample at a temperature of 10 K or lower) to obtain the resolution function of the instrument.\n4.

The spherical Bessel functions give the relative contribution of each angular momentum state of the water molecules, and the number N is determined based on the momentum transfer q-range. In the case of a typical NBS spectrometer, the terms up to N = 4 almost entirely explain the signal (Supplemental Figure S7).\n# here, equation 2 is used for hydration water\n\t# convolution with resolution function and addition of\n\t# D2O background is done automatically with the\n\t# provided arguments\n\t>>> sample.fit(modelWater(q),\n\t... res=vanadium,\n\t... bkgd=buffer,\n\t... volume_fraction_bkgd=0.95\n\t... )NOTE: The contributions of rotational and translational motions should be convoluted to be perfectly rigorous. The success of an additive model is to be attributed to the presence of distinct populations of water on the protein surface and the limited energy range accessible.\nUse the following to plot the data (Figure 4):\n>>> from nPDyn.plot import plot\n\t>>> plot(sample)\n5.

Build and fit the model using the following commands:\n>>> import numpy as np\n\t>>> from nPDyn.models import Parameters, Model, Component\n\t# a is a scaling factor\n\t>>> params = Parameters(\n\t... a={'value': 1, 'bounds': (0, np.inf)},\n\t... msd={'value': 1, 'bounds': (0, np.inf)}\n\t... )\n\t>>> model = Model(params)\n\t>>> model.addComponent(Component(\n\t\u2026 'gaussian',\n\t\u2026 lambda x, a, msd: a * np.exp(-x ** 2 * msd / 6)\n\t\u2026 ))\n\t>>> sample.fit(model, x=sample.q[:, None])\n\t>>> plot(sample)\n\tNOTE: The Gaussian approximation always holds for q2MSD << 1, but wider momentum transfer range can be used for relative comparison between samples.

We then used OligoCalc website (OligoCalc (Kibbe, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])) to analyze the full sequence of the prospective primers for potential hairpin formation and/or self-annealing. Targeting PCR efficiency due to maximum primer availability and specific template binding, we avoided using the primer pairs that were predicted to form hairpin or self-annealing. In addition, we only accepted forward and reverse primer pairs with differences in melting temperatures smaller than 5\u00b0C (please refer to the note below for detailed explanation). It is important to notice that, due to the limited options of primers, we accepted primers that allowed self-annealing, without hairpin formation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Primers are ordered with standard desalting purification and scale of 100\u00a0nmole.\nNote: It is important to notice that the specific difference in primers melting temperature (Tm) of 5\u00b0C or less was determined in accordance to the instructions of the manufacturer of the DNA polymerase used (Phusion\u2122, Thermo Scientific\u2122, cat# F-530L - Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012393_Phusion_HighFidelity_DNAPolymerase_UG.pdf]). However, it is also relevant to understand that the Tm of a primer correlates with the temperature at which the primer anneals with the specific sequence of DNA we are intending to amplify during a PCR reaction, also known as annealing temperature (AT). AT is the temperature at which the primers bind, specifically, to the complimentary template region for which they were designed. To avoid unspecific annealing of the primers with the template, it is ideal that both the forward and the reverse primers anneal with the DNA at approximate temperatures. Therefore, a smaller difference in the Tm of the primers will increase the chances that the optimal temperature for annealing (AT) is similar between the forward and reverse primers pair.\nVector linearization\nTiming: 1 dayThe overexpression plasmid LentiV_Blast is delivered to the lab as a circular molecule of DNA inserted into live bacteria.

Some of the BRD4-L fragments present a G-C content as high as 66.1%. This becomes especially complicated when using cold-fusion primers, which can be prone to self-annealing. After receiving the primers, we performed an annealing temperature (AT) gradient experiment and verified that these primers produced unspecific amplifications bands of sizes \u223c700\u00a0bp and between 1,500\u00a0bp and 2,000\u00a0bp (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In addition, after sequencing bands that appeared consistent with BRD4-L amplification (\u223c4,000\u00a0bp) we verified that there were multiple sites with severe changes of the expected sequences, with over 300\u00a0bp mismatch.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the first attempt to amplify BRD4-L via PCR, by performing an annealing temperature (AT) gradient, without betaineFor illustration purposes, only the lower range gradient (10\u00b0C lower than the mid-point) is observed above. No amplification was observed with AT higher than 63.8\u00b0C. Non-specific amplification can be identified around sizes 700\u00a0bp and 1,700\u00a0bp. The reference band for estimating the product size (4,089\u00a0bp) has been identified on the ladder above 3,000 base pairs (bp). Reference ladder used is GeneRuler 100\u00a0bp Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific\u2122, cat# SM0323), 10\u00a0\u03bcL were added to the left side of the gel.After researching different strategies involved in the PCR amplification of G-C rich templates (Mamedov et\u00a0al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Green and Sambrook, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), we decided to investigate the use of betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# B0300-5VL[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/b0300]), as a PCR additive in the amplification of BRD4. Betaine has been widely used in amplification of G-C rich sequences and it acts by reducing the melting temperature of the DNA, decreasing the formation of secondary structures formed by the regions of DNA rich in G-C (Green and Sambrook, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and stabilizing the DNA by equalizing the contribution of GC- and AT-base pairs (5M Betaine - Sigma-Aldrich[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/b0300]). Our approach with betaine included an attempt to titrate the ideal molar concentration of betaine that would allow for amplification of BRD4-L (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). However, the use of betaine as a mere additive to the PCR reactive failed to amplify BRD4-L in multiple efforts, producing inefficient BRD4-L amplification and non-specific amplification. Taking into consideration the fact that the template might have multiple secondary structures prior to the PCR reactions that might not be undone in the process of denaturation, and considering the mode of action of betaine, we attempted to incubate the template in betaine for 16\u00a0h (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). After 16\u00a0h incubation of the template, BRD4-L was successfully amplified via PCR reaction in every attempt (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), including with the use of cold fusion primers designed for different vectors (data not shown).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04.

Reference ladder used is GeneRuler 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific\u2122, cat# SM1334), 10\u00a0\u03bcL were added to each side of the gel.\nTherefore, to overcome issues encountered around the amplification of BRD4-L, we have determined that the following measures are necessary for a successful BRD4-L PCR:\nIncubate the template with 0.5\u00a0M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# B0300-5VL) for 16 h, prior to PCR reaction. This procedure was established as critical based on our lab experience.\nUse Phusion\u2122 G-C Buffer instead of Phusion\u2122 HF Buffer (both are provided with the enzyme). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nUse initial denaturation time of 3\u00a0min, which is longer, to ensure that the entire template gets denatured. This modification is suggested in the Phusion\u2122 polymerase protocol (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012393_Phusion_HighFidelity_DNAPolymerase_UG.pdf]).Be aware that the annealing temperature (AT) might be different than what is recommended to be used with Phusion\u2122 polymerase, because of the presence of betaine in the PCR mix. For our specific primers, the advised AT was 65.1\u00b0C, however, we found after gradient experiments that AT of 61.6\u00b0C produced better results. In order to find the ideal AT for your primers, we suggest performing a gradient experiment (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) using the temperature calculated via Thermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s temperature calculator (Tm calculator[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/thermo-scientific/molecular-biology/molecular-biology-learning-center/molecular-biology-resource-library/thermo-scientific-web-tools/tm-calculator.html?CID=fl-we120377]) as mid-point. ThermoFisher Scientific\u2019s Tm calculator will estimate the ideal AT for your primer pair, based on the Tm for each primer. It is ideal to test temperatures that range from approximately 10\u00b0C higher to 10\u00b0C lower than the mid-point. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nTo avoid amplification of unspecific products, we found that shorter annealing times (Mamedov et\u00a0al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) and a reduced number of cycles (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012393_Phusion_HighFidelity_DNAPolymerase_UG.pdf]) decreased the chances of our primers biding to unspecific targets. We found these steps to be critical to eliminate non-specific products and to increase efficiency in our reactions.

We have found Cold Fusion\u2122 to be a simple and quick technique that provided us with a ligation strategy that diminished the chances of promoting alterations to the BRD4-L insert that might impair its expression.\nAdjust the concentration of the BRD4-L insert, ensuring it is within the desired range (20\u2013200\u00a0ng/\u03bcL).\nAdjust the concentration of the LentiV_Blast linearized vector, ensuring it is within the desired range (10\u2013100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL).\nPerform Cold Fusion\u2122 cloning, in accordance to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Cold Fusion[href=http://www.systembio.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Manual_Cold_Fusion_083010-1.pdf]), making the following changes:\nEnsure the proportion of BRD4-L insert:LentiV_Blast linearized vector is 3:2 molar ratio.

To ensure cloning efficiency, it is not recommended that the miniprep be performed further than a week after bacterial growth.\nNote: After multiple attempts, our lab defined that the ideal proportion of DNA (BRD4-L) to Vector (LentiV_Blast) is in fact 3:2 molar ratio and not 1:1 or 1:2, as suggested by the cold fusion cloning kit\u2019s protocol.\nPause point: After bacterial growth, you can wrap the plates with plastic film and store them in 4\u00b0C until ready to perform miniprep, however, it is advised that miniprep be performed within 1\u00a0week, to ensure successful cloning.\nCritical: Make sure to observe the changes to the manufacture\u2019s protocol, as our lab has found them to be critical for the success of Cold Fusion\u2122 cloning.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2097_9.csv\nCritical: Make sure the concentrations of the linearized vector (10\u2013100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) and the DNA insert (20\u2013200\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) are within appropriate range. Use 3:2 molar ratio of DNA insert to linearized vector.\nMiniprep, clone screening, and sequencing\nTiming: 2\u20133 daysIf the processes of vector linearization, PCR amplification and Cold Fusion\u2122 cloning are completed successfully, the steps to be followed for miniprep and clone screening should occur smoothly. The most critical point for clone screening is to define the appropriate combination of restriction enzymes to use with your new plasmid (LentiV_Blast-BRD4-L) that will allow for identification of specific band sizes. Specific band sizes for diagnostic digestion of LentiV_Blast-BRD4-L should be different from empty LentiV_Blast vectors and from plasmids with improperly amplified BRD4-L, i.e., BRD4-L inserts missing fragments. While performing diagnostic digestion of LentiV_Blast-BRD4-L, we determined that the combination of the enzymes EcoRI and MluI digest the plasmid creating bands of sizes 8,229\u00a0bp and 2,672\u00a0bp. The same combination of restriction enzymes should not cut empty LentiV_Blast vectors, producing a single band (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2097-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06.

Cells allowed to attach for approximately 18\u201320 h.\nNote: Optimal cells confluency is critical. Cell number and complete medium type were optimized for HeLa cells. When other cells are used, each line should be optimized individually to reach 70%\u201380% confluency the day following seeding in its optimal complete medium. This is because mitosis-inducing treatment may cause cells detachment. Detachment may also occur when siRNA or overexpression transfection are applied. A lower cell density may result in either insufficient number of cells following treatment, or insufficient number of transfected cells.\nCells synchronization at prometaphase using nocodazole:\nBlock mitotic progression (end of prometaphase) by adding nocodazole directly into the complete medium of the relevant wells (IF)/plates (ISX) at a final concentration of 0.3\u00a0\u03bcM. Incubate for 16 h.\nControl cells are left untreated, containing complete medium only.\nAlternatively, cells can be synchronized by a double-thymidine block:Treat cells by directly adding thymidine to a final concentration of 2\u00a0mM into the complete medium of the relevant wells/plates. Incubate for 16 h.\nAspirate complete medium containing thymidine, and rinse plates twice with PBS by applying and immediately aspirating it.\nAdd complete medium for 8 h. This step completes one thymidine block cycle.\nRepeat the thymidine treatment for an additional cycle of 16 h.\nWash twice with PBS as mentioned above and apply fresh complete medium. This marks time 0.\nContinue growing the cells under regular conditions.\nNote: For the double-thymidine block, save an unwashed plate. This will represent cells at the G1/S border.\nOptional: When smaller plates or wells are used and total volume is reduced, it is recommended to aspirate medium and add a fresh complete medium that already contains nocodazole or thymidine diluted to the desired concentration. This will ensure homogenous distribution of the reagents.\nDetermining Golgi structure in synchronized HeLa cells by IF\nIn this section we describe the protocol for immunostaining HeLa for Golgi marker followed by imaging acquisition using fluorescence microscopy.\nCell fixation by paraformaldehyde for IF\nTiming: 40\u00a0min\nCarefully aspirate the complete medium from each well.\nWash cells once with PBS to remove any residual medium. Immediately aspirate PBS.\nFix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, 1\u00a0mL per well and incubate for 20\u00a0min at room temperature (22\u201325\u00b0C, RT).\nNote: Since cells might be more susceptible to detachment due to previous treatments, it is recommended to carefully apply all solutions and washes on the edge of the well and not directly on cells.\nRemove PFA and add PBS for 5\u00a0min at RT. Repeat wash with PBS for a total of three times to remove all residual PFA.Pause point: Cells can be kept following fixation in PBS at 4\u00b0C for up to 2\u00a0weeks before proceeding to the next step.\nImmunofluorescence staining for IF\nTiming: 3 h\nPermeabilization / Blocking: permeabilize cells with Triton X-100 and block with bovine serum albumin (BSA) by applying 1\u00a0mL of blocking-permeabilization solution per well. Incubate for 5\u00a0min at 23\u00b0C.\nOptional: This step may be separated to a permeabilization step (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, 5\u00a0min at 23\u00b0C), which is followed by a blocking step (2% BSA in PBS, 15\u00a0min at 23\u00b0C). This may be required when harsher conditions are needed in order to permeabilize the cell membrane, or for better blocking of non-specific binding according to the antibody used.\nPrimary antibody labeling: Prepare the primary antibody solution. Dilute the GM130 antibody at a ratio of 1:100 in PBS for a total volume of 25\u00a0\u03bcL per sample.\nNote: We use GM130 antibody as an endogenous Golgi marker to detect mitotic Golgi dynamics, however other Abs (p58, Giantin and GRASP65) were equally successful (Shaul and Seger, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Wortzel et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: Both GM130 antibodies mentioned in the KRT worked equally well and are diluted similarly. They should be preferred based on the relevant species.\nOptional: To increase antibody specificity it is recommended to dilute the antibody in 2% BSA in PBS.\nOnce blocking is completed, remove the solution and wash cells once with PBS.\nPrepare parafilm on a clean bench surface and apply a drop of 25\u00a0\u03bcL diluted antibody for each slide.\nCarefully invert each cover slip on the liquid drop, while making sure that the cells are facing the antibody dilution.Cover the parafilm with an aluminum foil covered box. Attach wet Kimwipes on top of the box. This will ensure a humidified cover preventing the coverslips from drying out.\nIncubate for 1\u00a0h (at RT).\nTransfer coverslips back to the 12-wells plate and wash cells three times with PBS, 5\u00a0min per wash at RT as explained above to remove the residual antibody.\nSecondary antibody labeling: Prepare the secondary antibody solution by diluting the Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated antibody 1:400 together with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for the nuclear staining at a dilution of 1:250 in PBS.\nPrepare parafilm on the clean bench surface and apply a drop of 25\u00a0\u03bcL diluted secondary antibody for each slide as described in step 12.\nInvert coverslips on the secondary antibody drop and incubate for 1\u00a0h (at RT) using the humidified covered box.\nSecondary antibody should be applied in the dark to prevent photobleaching.\nTransfer coverslips back to the 12 wells tissue culture plate and wash cells with PBS three times to remove any residual antibody as specified in step 13.\nPrepare microscope slides marked with the specific cell type, treatment and antibody wave-length. Apply a drop of 10\u201320\u00a0\u03bcL Elvanol mounting solution per coverslip. Once washing is complete, carefully remove each slide from the well and absorb leftover PBS using Kimwipes.\nSlowly invert each slide, cells side facing down, on the mounting reagent within an angle until fully placed on the slide. Carefully place the slides in a covered dark place and allow it to dry overnight in RT.Optional: Transferring of the slides from the well plate to the paraffin back and forth, as described above in steps 12\u201315, allows the use of a smaller antibody volume. Alternatively, the primary or secondary antibody mix can also be applied directly into the coverslips in the well plate, but this requires much larger volumes. The latter, however, limits the chance of confusion between treatments and/or breaking/damaging the slides from the frequent removals.\nNote: It should be noted that IF can be successfully applied to co-localize two different proteins within the same cells as well as staining of specific proteins within overexpressed cells. For this purpose, the two primary antibodies should be generated in different species (i.e., rabbit and mouse), while both secondary antibodies should be generated in the same third different species animal (i.e., goat) to prevent cross reactivity. Moreover, secondary antibodies should be conjugated to fluorescent probes with different, non-overlapping, wavelengths to ensure specificity of the signal.\nImaging by a spinning disk confocal microscopy and image analysis\nTiming: 1\u20132 h\nImage acquisition of the stained cells to analyze the endogenous Golgi is applied using fluorescence microscopy. We used the Observer.Z1 Confocal Spinning Disk Microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ROLERA (Q-Imaging) 12-bit monochrome CCD camera. Turn on the microscope and the ZEN 2.5 system software on the computer.\nAdd the relevant channels on the software:\nDAPI - 405\u00a0nm laser. BP450/50 emission filter.\nAF568 - 532/561\u00a0nm, 529/62 emission filter.\nOptimize image to avoid saturation for each channel, while maximizing the dynamic range of the camera. Capture images with a 63\u00d7/1.4 NA oil immersion objective according to the specific microscope software.\nCapture images of at least 5 different fields from each slide for quantification to have a total of at least 100 cells.Note: Counting should include at least 100 cells per treatment to have enough cells to reach statistical significance. Thus, if the confluency of the cells is low, more images per treatment should be acquired.\nAcquired images are transferred to Photoshop software (only to view the image, while maintaining the original scientific information of the picture. Other image-handling programs can be used as well). Analysis and quantification of the fine Golgi structure according to the GM130 staining is then done manually for each cell within each frame (by eye). Intact Golgi appears as one concentrated GM130 spot (\u223c2\u20133\u00a0\u03bcm) adjacent to the nucleus (stained with DAPI). Initial fragmentation appears as a little more spread (>4\u00a0\u03bcM), less intense GM130 staining. Partially fragmented ones (chunks) will be seen as 2\u20135 distinct spots, and fully fragmented Golgi will be seen as a diffused GM130 staining all over the cells.\nNote: Automated programs for microscope data analysis such as Image J, ilastik, or CellProfiler are available and can be used for quantification either alone, or preferably when are used together. These are very good tools mainly when following just fragmented vs intact Golgi. However, due to the fluidity of the Golgi structure and the different stages of fragmentations that vary among cells and can all appear simultaneously within the same frame, manual counting can be considered. The automated programs are robust specifically when combined together and result with a good automated quantification of the Golgi, however, a specific knowledge is required for their use.\nCount cells in each field and document number of cells with fragmented Golgi and number of cells with intact Golgi. Repeat counting in 5 different fields for a total of at least 100 cells.\nCalculate percentage of cells containing fragmented vs intact Golgi out of the total cells counted.Determine significance using student\u2019s T-test to determine difference between untreated to mitosis induced cells. Distinct stages of the fragmentation can be quantified as well.\nNote: More than 100 cells should be counted and three independent experiments should be performed to determine significant results. Double-blinded counting can be applied to ensure accurate results.\nDetermining Golgi structure and mitotic phases in synchronized HeLa cells by ISX\nIn this section we describe the protocol for immunostaining HeLa for Golgi marker followed by imaging acquisition using the Image-Stream X instrument.\nMethanol fixation for IFC\nTiming: 30\u00a0min (with an overnight incubation)\nCollect the complete medium from each 60\u00a0mm culture dish, and transfer into a 15\u00a0mL conical centrifuge tube. Place the tube on ice.\nNote: Mitotic induction (either nocodazole or thymidine) may result (in some cell types) in the detachment of cells from the plate. Therefore, it is important to collect the cells suspended in the complete medium.\nNote: Make sure to have additional plates for the single-color controls as well as an unstained sample for compensation analysis. In this layout, 3 additional plates are needed (for unstained, DNA stain only and for Golgi stain only).\nWash the culture dishes with PBS. Carefully aspirate the PBS and add 500\u00a0\u03bcL Trypsin C solution to each dish. Incubate the dishes in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 3\u20135\u00a0min to allow cells to detach from the plate.\nUse the medium from step 26 to wash the detached cells from the dish. Collect the medium with the washed cells and return to the tube.\nSpin down cells at RT for 5\u00a0min at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g.\nAspirate the supernatant, tap to resuspend and add 5\u00a0mL of ice-cold PBS. Centrifuge again at RT for 5\u00a0min at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g.Aspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the cell pellet in 500\u00a0\u03bcL ice-cold PBS.\nSet the vortex condition to a low mixing level relative to the vortex used. Gently vortex the cell suspension while slowly adding 1.7\u00a0mL ice-cold methanol into the tube in drop-by-drop manner.\nPlace sample at 4\u00b0C for an overnight incubation.\nPause point: Samples can be stored after fixation up to two weeks at 4\u00b0C.\nImmunofluorescence staining for ISX\nTiming: 3 h\nAdd 6\u00a0mL ice-cold PBS (4\u00b0C) to each tube and spin-down at RT for 5\u00a0min at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g. Repeat once more to remove all residuals methanol.\nPermeabilization / Blocking: Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 500\u00a0\u03bcL per tube of the following mixed solution; 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA in PBS, for 5\u00a0min at 23\u00b0C.\nImmediately after, wash cells by adding 6\u00a0mL ice-cold PBS and spin-down at RT for 5\u00a0min at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g.\nPrimary antibody labeling: Prepare the primary antibody solution. Dilute the GM130 antibody at a ratio of 1:100 in PBS for a total volume of 100\u00a0\u03bcL per sample. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 100\u00a0\u03bcL primary antibody dilution. Mix in an orbital-Mixer for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C, 99\u00b0 turns.\nNote: Both GM130 antibodies mentioned in the KRT worked equally well and are diluted similarly. Should be preferred based on the relevant species.\nAdd 6\u00a0mL ice-cold PBS (4\u00b0C) and spin-down at RT for 5\u00a0min at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g.\nSecondary antibody labeling: Prepare the secondary antibody solution containing Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated antibody (1:400) together with DAPI (1:250) for the nuclear staining in PBS.Aspirate the supernatant in the tube and resuspend the cell pellet in 100\u00a0\u03bcL secondary antibody solution. Mix in an orbital-Mixer for 30\u201360\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nNote: Secondary antibody should be applied in the dark to prevent photobleaching.\nAdd 6\u00a0mL ice-cold PBS (4\u00b0C) and spin-down at RT for 5\u00a0min at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g.\nAspirate the supernatant in the tube, resuspend the cell pellet in 200\u00a0\u03bcL PBS, and then transfer to a clean 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf centrifuge tube.\nImage acquisition by ISX\nTiming: 1\u20133 h\nTurn on the imaging flow cytometer, server and acquisition computer. Log in to the acquisition computer.\nNote: For a detailed explanation on how to use the instrument and analysis software, please refer to the user manual.\nStart the acquisition software, INSPIRE (the version used was 200.1.681.0). Once loaded, click on \u2018STARTUP\u2019 and make sure that all the automatic calibrations and tests have passed (marked green).\nChoose the magnification according to your cell size. We recommend the 60\u00d7 magnification (NA=0.9, pixel size 0.33\u00a0mm), if possible, to allow the highest resolution.\nCheck the excitation/emission data for your dyes and turn on the relevant lasers. Refer to the user manual for the detailed spectra for the available acquisition channels. Set the lasers to maximal power. In the example we provide (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), we used the 561\u00a0nm laser (200 mW) for the AF568 dye and 405\u00a0nm laser (120 mW) for the DAPI.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1538-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Examples of expected results for Golgi analysis by IF and IFC\nHeLa cells were fixed and stained for GM130 (red) and DAPI (blue) as described in the protocol. Right columns show examples of the different stages of the Golgi (Top row - intact, middle row - partially fragmented, lower row \u2013 fully fragmented).(A) Slides were imaged by a spinning-disc confocal microscope with 63\u00d7 oil objective. Representative cells with intact, partial and fully fragmented Golgi are enlarged on the right.\n(B) Cells were imaged by ISX using a 40\u00d7 magnification and analyzed by IDEA 6.2. Cells positive for Golgi staining (Golgi\u00a0+) were plotted for 'minor axis intensity\u2019 and \u2018area\u2019 of Golgi staining. Each Golgi population is gated on the graph, and representative cells are presented on the right. Scale bar 10\u00a0\u03bcm.\nTurn on the relevant acquisition channels for your dyes. These should include the brightfield channels (#1 and #9 for a two-camera instrument) and side-scatter channel (#6 or #12, depending on your dye combination). In the example we provide, AF568 was acquired on channel 4 (595\u2013640\u00a0nm) and DAPI was read on channel 7 (430\u2013505\u00a0nm).\nLoad your first sample \u2013 start with the sample that contains all dyes, which is expected to produce the highest staining intensity. In this experiment, it would be the control sample.\nCreate a scatter plot of the Area vs. Aspect ratio of the bright-field channel (as set in step 47). Gate on single cells according to your population distribution.\nNote: To include dividing cells in the telophase stage, increase the gate to include higher-area, low-aspect-ratio cells as well.\nCreate a histogram of Gradient_RMS of the bright-field channel (Usually channel 1). Draw a linear gate that includes values between 55 and 90, to collect only cells that are in focus.\nCreate a \u2018Raw Max Pixel\u2019 histogram for each fluorescent channel, taken from the \u2018single\u2019 gate.\nNote: Make sure the values do not reach 4095 (the instrument uses a 12-bit camera), which indicates the camera is saturated. If they do, reduce the relevant laser intensity until the values are within the target range preferably less than 4000.Collect \u223c30,000 cells from each sample, using the same setup of lasers and acquisition channels as set in step 47 for all samples. If a rare population is assessed, collect enough cells so that the final population contains at least 500 cells.\nMonitor camera focus and cell position during the acquisition.\nNote: If the autofocus fails to maintain its focus, it could be disabled by going to Instrument-> Advanced settings-> Autofocus and disabling the \u2018autofocus\u2019 option. Once the autofocus is disabled, the focus can be manually changed on the \u2018Focus\u2019 tab.\nNote: If the cell position in the flow is not centralized (this has to be inspected visually, as the software does not alert in case of drift), it can be adjusted manually by moving its position on \u2018Centering\u2019.\nAfter recording your samples, acquire single stained controls with the compensation wizard, using the same laser settings as those used for the experimental samples.\nImage analysis by IDEAS\nTiming: 1\u20133 h\nSet analysis template.\nStart the IDEAS analysis software (preferably version 6.2 or higher).\nOpen the control experimental sample file and calculate the compensation using the single-stain files acquired, using the compensation wizard in IDEAS.\nDraw a bi-variate plot of Area vs. Aspect ratio of the bright-field channel. Draw a gate around the single cells population, usually with low area and high aspect ratio. Verify the gate by visual inspection of the cells. If a cell-cycle analysis is required, make sure to include telophase cells, which are a close-to-doublet population (i.e., have higher area and lower aspect ratio).\nDraw a bi-variate plot of RMS vs. Contrast of the bright-field image. Gate on focused cells, usually values higher than 55 for Gradient RMS and higher contrast values. Verify the gate by visual inspection of the cells.Draw a bi-variate plot of Area vs. Centroid X of the bright-field channel. Gate on uncropped cells, which have already higher values of Centroid X.\nDraw a bi-variate plot of the Intensity vs. Max Pixel values of the Golgi staining channel. Gate on cells with a positive Golgi staining (Golgi\u00a0+), by comparing the staining to control samples labeled with all the dyes except the Golgi staining.\nDefine populations: Using \u2018Tag Objects\u2019, manually select a group of cells with an intact Golgi and another group featuring a fragmented Golgi (see Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B for a typical morphology). Include around 100 cells per group.\nDefine masks: Calculate several masks that delineate the Golgi staining. Usually, this would be done using the \u2018Morphology\u2019 and \u2018Threshold\u2019 masks, and we recommend using several \u2018Threshold\u2019 values. In the example provided (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), we used \u2018Threshold_60\u2019 (top 60% intensity pixels).\nDefine feature: Calculate all the features using the \u2018Add Multiple Features\u2019 option in the \u2018Features\u2019 panel. Select all the feature options under the \u2018Size\u2019, \u2018Location\u2019, \u2018Shape\u2019 and \u2018Texture\u2019 categories. It is undesirable to enable the \u2018Signal strength feature option, as it may differ between samples and between experiments. Choose the masks you just created, choose the Golgi staining channel under \u2018Image\u2019, and click on \u2018Add Features\u2019.\nDiscriminating statistics: Add a new statistics table. Under \u2018Statistics\u2019, choose \u2018RD-Mean\u2019 and \u2018RD-Median\u2019 (RD value, or Fisher\u2019s discriminant, is defined as difference between the means or medians, divided by the sum of standard deviations, of the two populations). Choose as a reference population the intact Golgi cells chosen in step 61, and click \u2018Add\u2019 to calculate.\nChoose the best features: Copy the values obtained to an Excel file and arrange them in a descending order according to the RD values.Examine the ability of the features that are at the top of the list with the highest RD values to separate between the chosen populations, by plotting histograms / bi-variate plots of the selected features. Verify by visual inspections of the populations.\nApply features: Apply the selected features to the whole population and verify that they correspond to the different Golgi morphologies.\nSave the analysis template.\nApply analysis template to samples.\nOpen the files recorded from treated samples using this template.\nIt is recommended to merge the treated and control samples into one file, as it makes it easier to determine the gating. To do so, in each file click on Tools -> Create Data File from Populations, and then select the single, focused, uncropped, Golgi-positive population, and create a \u2217.CIF file. Then, click on \u2018Merge CIF files\u2019, select the files you just created and use the template that was saved in the previous step.\nDetermine the gating that distinguishes between the different populations according to the controls. Verify by visual inspection of the populations.\nApply the gating on all the other experimental datasets, either in the merged file or by saving the template and applying it to all the other experimental samples.\nIf you have IDEAS version 6.3, quantification of the different Golgi morphologies could also be done by using the Machine Learning Wizard. In this case, use the populations chosen in step 61 to allow the wizard to create a classifier that combines several features weighted for the best separation between populations.\n\u00a0\u00a0Potential applications.\nYou can follow the Golgi fragmentation during the different stages of the cell cycle and cell division by following the next steps:Cell cycle and division stages: Label DNA using a dye compatible with the ones you used to stain your samples. Common dyes and their corresponding channels (in brackets) include DAPI (Ch7), SyBR Green (Ch2), propidium iodide (Ch4) and Draq5 (Ch11). You can quantify the different stages according to the DNA intensity, plotted as a histogram on a linear scale.\nCell division: using the DNA staining, you can determine the stages of cell division by DNA morphology (examples can be seen in (Filby et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]); (Wortzel et\u00a0al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]); (Vivante et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])), however adjustments may be needed according to particular cell type.\nGate for G2/M based on DNA staining intensity.\nGate for G2, prophase, prometaphase and mitotic (metaphase-telophase) populations using 2 parameters: the bright detail intensity (BDI) of DNA staining (intensity of localized bright areas, subtracted for the local background), and the area of the 50% highest intensity pixels of the DNA staining (defined by the Threshold_50 mask).\nNote: Non-dividing cells will have high area, low BDI, mitotic cells will have a low area and high BDI, and prophase will be in between.\nGate for cells in metaphase according to their lower width using the Width feature masked for the 50% top intensity pixels of the DNA staining (Threshold 50).\nCells with higher area and lower aspect ratio Brightfield (BF) images are defined as belonging to the telophase stage.The rest of the cells can be then gated using two spot features based on the mask of the 50% high intensity pixels of the DNA staining (Threshold 50). The features used are Spot Distance Min (shortest distance in microns between two spots within the mask) and Spot Area Min (the area of the smallest spot within the mask). Three populations can be defined: (1) High Spot Area Min and 0 Spot Distance Min are considered as metaphase and added to the previously gated cells. (2) Intermediate Spot Area Min and high Spot Distance Min are defined as cells during anaphase. (3) Cells with low Spot Area Min and low Spot Distance Min are defined as cells during Pro/ProM and added to the previously gated cells.\nOnce the Golgi fragmentation is quantified as detailed above, it could be combined with additional parameters or markers:\nApoptosis: Apoptotic cells will have fragmented and condensed DNA. This can be quantified, for example, using the contrast of the bright-field image vs. the area of the top 30% intensity pixels of the DNA staining.\nCo-localization: The co-localization of the Golgi with other proteins or organelles can be quantified by fluorescently labeling them and calculating the similarity using similarity feature (i.e., log transformed Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient, a measure of the degree to which two images are linearly correlated within a masked region) or bright detail similarity (i.e., the intensity of localized bright spots whose radius is three pixels (if defined as number of pixel, important to clarify the magnification used on the Image-Stream) or less within the masked area in the image, with the local background around the spots removed). The pixel resolution is 0.3\u00a0\u03bcm for the 60\u00d7 lens, and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm for the 40\u00d7 lens (Wortzel et\u00a0al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).Cell classification: As you can utilize up to 10 fluorescent channels, you can label additional markers to increase your resolution of specific population identification.", "1. Selection of labeling sites\nIdentify at least three potential labeling sites to triangulate the putative binding site on the existing protein structures. In this case, SecA, SecYEG, and preprotein attached to SecA through genetic fusion were identified2.\n\t\nChoose labeling sites within 25-75 \u00c5 of the putative binding site and in relatively static regions of the protein, the distance will determine the specific FRET dye pair to be used36. Locate the labeling sites in protein regions that are relatively distinct from each other, so the sites describe the vertices of a triangle with the putative binding site located in the center (Figure 1A-D).\nIntroduce or identify cysteine (Cys) residues at labeling sites of interest in a protein that has no other Cys residues, to improve the labeling efficiency of the specific site37,38.\nIntroduce unnatural amino acids, e.g., p-azidophenylalanine for labeling with click chemistry, in order to effectively label one protein at two distinct positions with different dyes39,40.\nTest the Cys mutants for loss of function. Verify the activity of the Cys-less mutant and the unnatural amino acid mutant using an appropriate activity assay. In this case, activity was verified with a growth assay followed by an in vitro malachite green ATPase assay32,41,42\n2. Labeling the protein\nPurify the protein or proteins of interest to at least 95% purity for accurate labeling. Purify SecA and SecYEG proteins following protocols detailed in reference3. Ensure that you have at least 5 \u03bcg of purified protein for this step, as some protein will be lost during the labeling process.Choose two dyes for FRET measurements depending on their R0 value and the predicted distances between labeled sites. Estimate R0 values and observe donor emission and acceptor absorbance overlap using the information from the fluorescent protein database, which also gives spectra for commonly used dyes (https://www.fpbase.org/spectra/)36.\n\tNOTE: R0 is defined as the distance at which the transfer efficiency is 50% for a given dye pair. For mapping experiments, predicted distances should be close to the R0 value of the dye pair to ensure that distances can be measured accurately.\nLabel the positions identified in step 1.1.1. with the donor-acceptor dye pair.\n\t\nLabel the protein according to the manufacturer's instructions with particular attention paid to parameters such as optimal protein concentration, temperature, pH, length of time, and buffer for the specific dyes used43,44.\nPrepare the protein at a concentration of 1-2 mg/mL or approximately 10 \u03bcM in a 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA (TKE) buffer. Dissolve dye in dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Add the dye dropwise to the solution while stirring to reach a dye: protein molar ratio of 5:1 (50 \u03bcM dye: 10 \u03bcM protein).\nAllow the reaction to proceed for 4 h at room temperature (RT) in a glass vial with gentle rocking or overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Stop the reaction by adding \u03b2-mercaptoethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: If protein is not compatible with Tris buffer, phosphate or HEPES buffers can be used. Maintain pH in the 7.0-7.5 range. If the protein has disulfide bonds, add a reducing agent such as DTT or TCEP prior to labeling. Remove DTT by dialysis or gel filtration before adding dye.For accurate FRET measurements remove the free dye with a centrifugal concentrator with an appropriate molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) to let the free dye flow through while retaining the labeled protein.\n\t\nPrepare the concentrator membrane by placing ~ 1 mL of water in the upper part of a 3 mL concentrator and then centrifuge the water through the membrane (at least 10 min at 4,300 x g).\nRemove free dye by centrifuging labeled sample in concentrator (20 min at 4,300 x g). Repeat 3-4 times and dispose of flow through.\nCheck labeling efficiency of the labeled protein using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy.\n\t\tNOTE: FRET measurements require labeling efficiencies of 50% or greater. Lower labeling efficiencies reduce the FRET signal and can lead to inaccuracies in measurement.\nObtain a UV-Vis spectrum of the labeled protein with a range from 250-700 nm to observe both the protein absorption band and the dye maximum absorption band. Measure the absorbance at the absorption peak of dye and at 280 nm for protein.\nDetermine the concentration of protein and correct for any contributions from the dye using the correction factor, CF, and the following equations45,46:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq01.jpg\n\t\twhere C is the concentration of the protein (M), A280 is the sample absorbance at 280 nm, Amax is the absorbance at the dye absorption maximum, \u03b5 protein is the extinction coefficient for the protein at 280 nm and CF is the correction factor, A'280/A'max, where A'280 is the absorbance at 280 nm and A'max is the absorbance at the peak maximum for the dye only.\nDetermine labeling efficiency using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq02.jpgwhere \u03b5dye is the molar extinction coefficient of the dye, C is the concentration of the protein as determined in step 2.4.5, and E is the labeling efficiency. Repeat step 2.4.2 until the labeling efficiency value has plateaued and is less than 100%.\n3. Determine the R 0 values\nMeasure the R0 values in situ. Prepare two protein samples at the same concentration of total protein, 4 \u03bcM, one with the protein labeled with the donor dye only and one with the protein labeled with the acceptor dye only. For SecA, a protein concentration of 4 \u03bcM SecA monomer works well for these measurements.\n\t\nPrepare sample volumes of 2.5 mL for a 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette, 600 \u03bcL for a 5 mm x 5 mm cuvette or 200 \u03bcL for a 3 mm x 3 mm cuvette.\nTurn on the fluorometer and open the spectral acquisition and analysis program in the fluorescence software if using a spectrofluorometer. Click on the red M to connect the computer to the instrument (Figure 2A) and choose Emission Spectra.\n\t\nEnter scan parameters such as excitation wavelength, the range for emission scan, temperature, and sample changer position using the\u00a0Collect Experiment\u00a0menu item (Figure 2B).\nClick on RTC and optimize instrument settings (e.g., spectral slits) by monitoring the fluorescence emission at the peak using an excitation wavelength set at the dye's absorption maximum. For SecA, set the following settings: bandpass as 1 nm; excitation and emission slits as 1 and 1.5 mm respectively, with the temperature at 25 \u00b0C and stirring speed at 250 rpm.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exceed the counts per second (cps) capacity of the instrument (typically 2 x 106 cps).Place the donor labeled protein sample in the sample holder and click Run to generate an emission scan of the protein labeled with the donor dye only (donor only protein) by exciting the sample at the dye absorption maximum (e.g., 488 nm for AF488) and scanning over the emission peak (505-750 nm for donor only SecA protein labeled with AF488).\nEstablish a baseline for the scan by extending the scan 25-50 nm past the end of the peak. Measure the quantum yield of the donor-only protein, by performing absorption and fluorescence measurements on samples of different concentrations as described47. Maintain the same slit settings for these measurements.\n\t\nUse free donor dye as the reference for the quantum yield. Obtain at least four measurements of the donor-only protein and the free dye at different concentrations for an accurate determination.\nPlot the fluorescence intensity or integrated area versus the absorbance for the donor-only protein and the free dye or reference. Determine the slopes for the donor-only protein (SlopeD) and the reference (SlopeR).\nQuantum yield (\u03a6) is calculated using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq03.jpg\n\t\there\u00a0\u03a6D is the quantum yield of the donor only protein,\u00a0\u03a6R is the quantum yield of the free dye (this can usually be obtained from the manufacturer), SlopeD and SlopeR are the slopes determined in step 3.4.2 for the donor only protein and reference, respectively and \u03b7D and\u00a0\u03b7R represent the index of refraction of the donor-only protein and the reference-free dye solutions, respectively 47.\nObtain an absorption spectrum of your acceptor-only protein using a 1 cm pathlength cell. Generate an extinction coefficient spectrum of your acceptor-only protein by dividing the absorption spectrum by the dye concentration.Generate the spectral overlap integral, J (\u03bb) using a graphical analysis program. A standard worksheet program (e.g., spreadsheet) can also be used for this process.\n\t\nMultiply the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor-only protein (step 3.4) by the extinction coefficient spectrum of the acceptor-only protein to generate the overlap spectrum.\nMultiply the resultant overlap spectrum by \u03bb4.\nDetermine the area under the curve by integration of the overlap region. The overlap region is defined as the area where the donor emission spectrum multiplied by the acceptor extinction coefficient spectrum yields positive values. The spectral overlap integral is defined as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq04v2.jpg\n\t\twhere FD (\u03bb) is the emission spectrum of the donor-only protein (obtained in step 3.4) and \u03b5A(\u03bb) is the extinction coefficient spectrum of the acceptor-only protein and has units of M-1cm-1 (obtained in step 3.5). The resulting spectral overlap integral should have units of M-1cm-1nm4.\nNormalize the spectral overlap integral. Divide the overlap integral by the integrated area of the donor only protein spectrum over the same spectral range:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq05.jpg\nCalculate the R0 value in \u00c5 using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq06.jpg\n\t\twhere \u03ba2 is the orientation factor, typically taken as 2/3 for freely rotating dyes, \u03b7 is the index of refraction and can be approximated as 1.33 for dilute aqueous solutions, QD is the quantum yield of the donor (step 3.4) and J(\u03bb) is the spectral overlap integral as determined in step 3.6.35. NOTE: If the dyes are not freely rotating, corrections can be introduced as described by Ivanov 48 and implemented by Auclair49 and Zhang2,3.\n4. Perform FRET spectral measurementsPrepare donor-only protein, acceptor-only protein, and donor-acceptor protein samples at the same concentration; a concentration of 4 \u03bcM is recommended. Use 200 \u03bcL of solution,\u00a0if using a 3 mm x 3 mm cuvette, 600 \u03bcL if using a 5 mm x 5 mm cuvette, or 2.5 mL if using a 1 cm x 1 cm cuvette.\n\t\nPrepare the donor-acceptor protein sample by using equal molar amounts of the donor only and acceptor only protein.\nMaintain the same amount of labeled sample in control donor only and acceptor only protein samples through the introduction of unlabeled protein in equal molar amount to either the donor only or acceptor only samples. For example, for solutions of the same concentration, each donor-only FRET sample would contain 100 \u03bcL of donor-only protein and 100 \u03bcL of unlabeled protein for a 200 \u03bcL volume.\nGenerate fluorescence emission spectra of the donor only, acceptor only, and donor-acceptor samples. Optimize the signal as described in step 3.2. Once optimized maintain the same settings for all of the samples.\n\t\nObtain the donor-only scan as described in step 3.3. Excite the solution at the donor dye absorption maximum and scan over the donor and (expected) acceptor emission peaks.\nEither exchange the sample to the acceptor-only protein or change the sample changer position to the cuvette containing the acceptor-only protein.\nObtain an emission scan of the protein labeled with acceptor dye only (acceptor only protein) using the same settings as in step 4.2.1. Excite the sample at the donor excitation wavelength.\n\t\tNOTE: This spectrum provides a correction for the amount of acceptor excited at the donor wavelength (FA in step 5.1.2)\nExchange the sample to the donor-acceptor protein sample or change the sample changer position to the cuvette containing the donor-acceptor labeled protein.Obtain an emission scan of the donor-acceptor protein sample using the same settings as in steps 4.2.1 and 4.2.3.\nFor all spectra, correct for background fluorescence by subtracting the background counts measured at the end of the scan.\nMeasure the donor lifetimes of the donor only and donor-acceptor samples prepared as described in step 4.1.2. Use a time-correlated single-photon counting fluorescence instrument capable of measuring and resolving fluorescent decays in the nanosecond (10-9 s) time range.\n\tNOTE: For FRET dye pairs, match the excitation light source to the absorption maximum of the donor dye.\n\t\nTurn on the instrument. Open the acquisition software, use the instrument control software for data acquisition with the fluorescence spectrometer.\nFor acquisition, select TCSPC Decay, with a time range of 55 ns, a gain of 1 and 4096 channels.\nObtain an instrument response function (IRF) using a solution of non-dairy creamer or commercial scattering solution and monitor the scattering at 490 nm. Adjust the slit setting and use neutral density filters as needed to maintain a low enough count rate to avoid pulse pile-up5. Click Accept and then Start. This will start the acquisition.\n\t\tNOTE: A maximum count rate of 4000 cps is used for a 180 kHz repetition rate.\nCollect the IRF at 490 nm until the peak channel has a maximum of 20,000 counts. Collect an IRF before and after measuring each fluorescence decay.\nObtain the fluorescence decays of the donor only and donor-acceptor samples by monitoring the fluorescence emission at the donor emission wavelength, 520 nm.\nAdjust slit settings for a maximum count rate of 4000 cps or less. Slit settings are typically 15-20 nm bandpass for protein samples. Collect the decay until 20,000 counts are obtained in the peak channel.Analyze the decay or the fluorescence intensity (I) as a function of time (t) for the fluorescence lifetime (\u03c4). Fit the decay to a sum of exponentials with the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq07.jpg\n\twhere \u03b1I is the preexponential factor of the ith component and \u03c4I is the lifetime. The fit is reconvolved with the IRF to match the fluorescence decay. Judge the quality of the fit from the reduced \u03a72 parameters.\n5. Analysis of FRET data\nCalculate FRET efficiency from the decrease in donor intensity of the donor-acceptor sample relative to the donor only with the following equation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq08.jpg\n\twhere FDA is the fluorescence intensity of the donor-acceptor sample and FD is the fluorescence intensity of the donor only sample at the peak of the donor fluorescence. Use the integrated areas of the peaks if the data is noisy.\n\t\nCorrect for any differences in labeling between the donor only and donor-acceptor samples. Calculate corrections based on the donor degree of labeling as follows.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq09.jpg\n\t\twhere fDA is the donor labeling efficiency in the donor-acceptor sample and fD is the labeling efficiency in the donor-only sample.\nCorrect for any contributions of the acceptor fluorescence to the donor-excited spectrum through subtraction of the acceptor-only protein spectrum (step 4.2) from the donor-acceptor protein spectrum.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq14.jpg\nCorrect for the differences in labeling efficiency of the acceptor only protein relative to the donor-acceptor protein sample yielding the following equation for calculating efficiency:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq10.jpg\n\t\twhere fA denotes the fractional amount of acceptor labeling. This equation includes all corrections due to dye labeling and acceptor fluorescence.\nCalculate FRET distances from the efficiencies using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq11.jpg\n\t\tusing the R0 value obtained in step 3.6.5.\nCalculate FRET efficiency using fluorescence lifetimes of the donor only and donor-acceptor samples measured in step 4.3.3-4.3.5:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq12.jpgUse the amplitude-weighted lifetime to calculate FRET efficiencies and compare with steady-state results5.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63433/63433eq13.jpg\nCalculate the distance as in step 5.1.4 from the efficiencies determined by fluorescence lifetime. Compare steady-state and time-resolved values for FRET efficiencies and distances and ensure that they are within error of each other.\n6. Mapping the distances\nUse the calculated distances to map the binding site on the three-dimensional structure. Calculate the distances and errors for all of the dye pairs and locations examined using the equation given in step 5.1.4 and R0 values obtained in step 3.6.5 for each FRET pair.\n\t\nUse a 3-D graphical viewing program such as PyMOL50 to map the distances onto the structure (script given in Supplementary File). Commands from the script can be directly entered into the command window with the appropriate distance information.\nGenerate a shell for each distance measured and the associated error (Figure 3, Figure 4, Supplementary Figures 1-3).\nMap the position through the intersection of the different shells (Supplementary Figures 1-3). The signal peptide binding site was mapped through the three different locations on SecA and SecYEG and four different locations on the signal peptide (Figure 1).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "1. Designing and Preparing the Peptides\nAcquire the sequence of the fusion protein of interest from a public database such as NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or the virus pathogen database (https://www.viprbrc.org). Choose the protease recognition site preceding the fusion peptide and include 2-3 amino acids upstream and downstream of this sequence.\nWhen ordering the peptides, modify them with the FRET pair 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl acetyl (MCA) at the N-terminus and N-2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) at the C-terminus.\n\tNOTE: Several suppliers provide these modifications. Price and delivery time depend on the supplier of choice. However, alternative modifications exist which vary in sensitivity and require adjustments of the plate reader in terms of wavelengths.\nResuspend the peptide according to the manufacturers recommendations by gently pipetting up and down. For example, resuspend peptides in 70% ethanol to the final concentration of 1 mM.\nOptionally, add the tube containing the peptide and the solvent into a sonication bath until it is fully resuspended if the peptide does not resuspend very well by pipetting.\nAliquot the peptide into light dampening or resistant tubes to protect the peptide from bleaching. Keep aliquot sizes small to avoid multiple freeze/thaw cycles (e.g., 100 \u00b5L). Store aliquots at -20\u00b0 C.\n2. Preparing the Fluorescence Plate Reader\nTurn on the plate reader and wait until the self-test is finished.\nOpen the operating software on the attached computer and make sure it is connected with the plate reader.\nOpen the temperature setting and set to 30 \u00b0C (or the required temperature for optimal performance for the protease).\nClick on Control | Instrument Setup to set up the experiment.\nChoose Kinetic.\nSelect Fluorescence.\nEnter Excitation and Emission wavelengths: 330 nm and 390 nm respectively.\nUnselect Auto Cut-off.\nSelect Medium, normal sensitivity.\nChoose a runtime of 1 h for the assay and select one measurement every 60 s.Set 5 s mixing before first measurement and 3 s before each measurement\nSelect wells to read and start the assay.\n3. Preparing the Assay\nPrepare the assay buffer by calculating the appropriate quantities for each ingredient and adding it. For furin, make buffer consisting of 100 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% Triton X-100. For trypsin, use standard phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution.\n\tNOTE: Volumes of 10 mL or less are sufficient. Depending on the protease(s) used in the assay the buffer varies.\nChill the buffer on ice.\nPlace the assay plate on ice with a thin metal plate underneath to support cooling and stability. Use a solid black polystyrene 96-well plate with a flat bottom and non-treated.\n\tNOTE: It is essential to use black plates to prevent fluorescent \"leakage\" from adjacent wells.\nCalculate the appropriate amount of protease to add for each reaction based on previous publications or experimental data. For furin, use 1 unit per reaction which corresponds to 0.5 \u00b5L. For trypsin, use 0.5 \u00b5L of 160 nM TPCK trypsin.\nPer sample prepare 3 technical replicates per assay in a total volume of 100 \u00b5L per sample.\n\tNOTE: It was experimentally evaluated that it does not make a difference whether the pipetting is carried out under normal light conditions or dimmed light. However, the peptides should not be exposed to light for an extended period of time.\nPipette the appropriate amount of assay buffer (94.5 \u00b5L as described under Step 3.1) into each well.\nAdd the protease to each well. For both, furin and TPCK trypsin, use 0.5 \u00b5L per sample. To 6 wells (3 wells for a blank control and 3 wells for a peptide control), add 0.5 \u00b5L buffer instead of the respective protease.Add the peptide to a final concentration of 50 \u00b5M to each well except the blank control. In this case, pipette 5 \u00b5L peptide prepared as described under Step 1.3. Add 5 \u00b5L of buffer to the blank control instead of peptide.\n\tNOTE: Several concentrations of the peptide were initially tested with the described enzyme concentrations to ensure that the enzymes were saturated.\nInsert the plate into the fluorescence plate reader and click start.\n4. Data Analysis\nSave the experiment file.\nClick on Export and export the file as a .txt.\nImport the .txt file into a spreadsheet.\nFor each technical replicate per sample, create a graph plotting the relative fluorescent units (RFU) on the y-axis against the time on the x-axis (Supplemental Figure 1).\nSelect the data range where the graph is in a linear range and the closest to the start of the fluorescence increase.\nPlot the selected data on a second graph and add a linear trendline.\nSelect in the trendline options Display equation on chart. The equation will show the Vmax.\nCalculate the average Vmax for each sample from the 3 technical replicates.\nRepeat the experiment twice more to obtain 3 biological replicates.\nCalculate the standard deviation based on the data from 3 independent biological replicates.", "Procedure Overview: Dissection and Digestion of Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) from Mus musculus (1.5-2 h)Myofiber RNA Extraction (30 min)cDNA Library Preparation (3 h)Purification of cDNA (30 min)Preparing Sequencing ready libraries (2.5 h)Purification and Size Selection (30 min)\u00a0Quality Control (2-3 h)Dissection and digestion of Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) from Mus musculus Prepare a digestion buffer of 1,000 U/ml of collagenase in unsupplemented DMEM and filter the buffer with a 0.22 micron filter. 800 \u00b5l of digestion buffer is required per EDL muscle.Aliquot 800 \u00b5l of the digestion buffer to a 1.5 ml tube and place in an incubator, with the caps closed, at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 30 min before dissection to warm up the buffer and infuse it with CO2.Notes: The Myofibers are very sensitive to oxygen, all buffers and media used on them should be first placed in the incubator for at least 30 min. When working outside the incubator do not do so for longer than 5 min at a time if possible. If more time is needed to work on the fibers, allow them to recover in the incubator for 10 min before reusing them. Sacrifice the mouse by anesthetizing it with 5% isoflurane, in an induction chamber, and chemically inducing death with CO2, followed by cervical dislocation. Remove the skin on the hindlimb of the mouse with a pair of scissors by cutting the skin around the ankle and making an incision along the ventral side of the leg.Using a pair of sharp forceps, remove the epimysium covering the Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscle.Cut the TA tendon at the ankle, being careful to only cut the top tendon as the bottom tendon belongs to the Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) (Figure 1A).Using forceps, gently peel off the TA up the leg until you hit the knee, exposing the EDL. Cut out the TA as close to the knee as possible (Figure 1B).The biceps femoris is covering the proximal EDL tendon at the patella and must be removed to expose the tendon (Figure 1A).Slide a pair of sharp forceps underneath the EDL and gently run it along its length to ensure that both tendons are exposed and accessible (Figure 1B).Cut the distal EDL tendon at the ankle. Lift the EDL upright by the tendon with a pair of forceps and, without pulling too hard, cut the proximal tendon as close to the knee as possible.Notes: It is very important to cut the EDL at the tendons, cutting into the muscle will result in most of the fibers being lost. It should take about 5 minutes to dissect an EDL. A video demonstrating the EDL isolation procedure has been made available by Pasut et al. (2013). Place the dissected EDL into the digestion buffer and incubate for an hour in the incubator, with the cap closed, while periodically inverting the tube to mix the solution. Trypsin can be added to the digestion buffer at a final concentration of 0.25% at this moment if the removal of fiber-associated satellite cells is needed.During the digestion process, coat a 6-well plate with enough coating media (10% horse serum (HS) in unsupplemented DMEM) to cover the bottom of the wells (approximately 3-4 ml), for at least 30 min.Note: Myofibers are very sticky and will become stuck to any surface that is not coated with horse serum. Replace the coating media with 2 ml of unsupplemented DMEM and place the plate in the incubator for at least 30 min.Coat a large bore glass pipette with HS and rinse with coating media. Use the large bore pipette to transfer the EDL from the digestion buffer to the 6-well plate, being careful to transfer as little of the digestion buffer as possible with it.Notes: At this point, the EDL muscle is still intact and will be at the bottom of the tube. It helps to invert the tube to dislodge the EDL from the bottom and then use the large bore pipette to pick up the EDL. The EDL will sink to the tip of the pipette and can then be transferred to the coated 6-well plate in a single drop of digestion buffer. A large bore glass pipette can be made by cutting a Pasteur pipette with a diamond pen where the area begins to widen, and then flame polishing the edges with a Bunsen burner (Figure 1C). Disassociate the fibers by gently pipetting the EDL up and down with the large bore pipette. Transfer the EDL to subsequent wells as fibers are isolated to avoid damaging them (Figures 1D-1E).Note: Typically over 300 intact fibers will be isolated from a single EDL.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200213/20200213172834_1163.jpgFigure 1.

Place the plate in the incubator for at least 30 min.Coat a small-bore glass pipette with HS and rinse with coating media. Use the small-bore pipette to transfer fibers to the PBS filled 6-well plate (Figure 1C).Note: A small bore glass pipette can be made by using a Bunsen burner to bend the thin portion of a Pasteur pipette into a curve. Flame polish the edges of the opening (Figure 1C). Using a small-bore pipette under a microscope, transfer a single fiber to a 200 \u00b5l PCR tube and remove the PBS with a P200 pipette(Figure 1F). Visually confirm that only a single fiber is in the PCR tube by observing the tube under a microscope.Prepare a 10x SMART reaction buffer (Recipe 3).Lyse the fiber with 10 \u00b5l of 1x reaction buffer. Pipette the fiber up and down for 3 min with a P20 pipette. Put the tube on ice for 5 min and vortex as needed (Figure 1G).Note: The fiber will never fully breakdown, but it does so enough for the RNA to be extracted in sufficient quantity. To remove the residual fiber pieces, spin down the sample and, while visualizing the fiber pieces under a microscope, transfer the supernatant to a new 200 \u00b5l PCR tube.Preparing cDNA libraryBring the volume of the sample up to 11.5 \u00b5l with RNase free water.Using the DNA SMART-Seq HT kit perform the following steps:a.Add 1 \u00b5l of 3\u2032 SMART-Seq CDS primer II A to the sample.b.Mix by pipetting or gently vortexing and spin down.Incubate for 3 min at 72 \u00b0C, then place immediately on ice.Prepare template switching master mix. For one reaction use the following reagents: 0.7 \u00b5l nuclease free water, 8 \u00b5l one-step buffer, 1 \u00b5l SMART-Seq HT oligonucleotide, 0.5 \u00b5l RNase inhibitor, 0.3 \u00b5l SeqAmp DNA polymerase, 2 \u00b5l SMARTscribe reverse transcriptase, total volume 12.5 \u00b5l per reaction.Note: Add the enzymes last to the master mix and use immediately. Add 12.5 \u00b5l per reaction.

Mix thoroughly and allow the DNA to bind to the beads at room temperature for 8 min (Figure 2A).Note: Allow AMPure XP beads to warm to room temperature before pipetting. Vortex AMPure XP beads vigorously before use. Place the tubes on a magnetic strip and wait for the solution to clear, approximately 5 min (Figure 2B).Using a P200 pipette, discard the supernatant while being careful to not remove the magnetic beads. Wash the beads twice with 200 \u00b5l of 80% ethanol for 20 s.Note: On the last wash, make sure to remove all the ethanol and use an aspirator to remove any residual droplets on the side of the tube, if necessary. Elute the DNA using 17 \u00b5l of elution buffer provided with the SMART-Seq HT kit.Add the buffer to the tube, mix thoroughly until the beads go into solution, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Note: Be careful not to allow your beads to over dry. When dried the DNA becomes difficult to elute, resulting in low yield. If the beads are dry place them in elution buffer at 45 \u00b0C and vortex periodically until no clumps are visible and the beads do not settle at the bottom of the tube. Place the tubes on a magnetic strip until the solution clears and keep the supernatant (Figure 2B).Note: This is a stopping point. cDNA can be kept at 4 \u00b0C or -20 \u00b0C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200213/20200213174239_7989.jpgFigure 2.

D. Typical bioanalyzer profiles of RNA-Seq libraries made from single fibers.Preparing Sequencing ready librariesQuantify the samples using Quant-IT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit.Note: Typically we obtain a total cDNA yield between 20 and 100 ng. Prepare 250 pg of single fiber cDNA in 1.25 \u00b5l of water in a microtube.Note: It is important to accurately quantify the cDNA concentration. The amount of starting material can alter the library fragment size. Too much DNA results in larger fragments while too little gives small fragments that will be lost during size selection. Using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit, add to the mix 2.5 \u00b5l of TD buffer, and 1.25 \u00b5l of ATM, mix and spin down.Incubate at 55 \u00b0C for 5 min.Remove from heat and add 1.25 \u00b5l of NT, mix and spin down.Note: Add NT buffer directly after the tagmentation reaction (Step E4) to deactivate the Tn5 transposase, since the enzyme is still active at this point. Incubate the sample for 5 min at RT.To amplify your libraries, add 1.25 \u00b5l of an i7 adaptor and 1.25 \u00b5l of an i5 adaptor and 3.75 \u00b5l of NPM. Vortex and spin down.Note: When incorporating sequencing adapters, care must be taken to make sure the choice of i5 and i7 adaptors is color-balanced for the type of sequencer used (two vs four channel). Briefly, the goal is to have signal in both color channels (red and green) at each nucleotide position for the pool of adapters. For example, on a NextSeq 500, which is a two-channel system, T appears as red, C appears as green, A appears in both color channels and G is colorless. In this case, at a single nucleotide position, a G must be pooled with at least an A, or a mix of T and C. In the case of a four-channel system, the same rules apply, but A and C both appear as red, and T and G both appear as green.

Mix thoroughly and incubate at room temperature for 8 min.Note: This ratio will remove fragments smaller than 200 bp.Place the tubes on a magnetic strip and wait for the solution to clear, approximately 5 min.Discard the supernatant. Wash the beads twice with 200 \u00b5l of 80% ethanol for 20 s.Note: On the last wash, make sure to remove all the ethanol and use an aspirator to remove droplets on the side of the tube, if necessary. Elute the DNA fragments by adding 20 \u00b5l of resuspension buffer that is provided with the Nextera XT kit and mixing thoroughly until the beads go into solution. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Place the tubes on the magnetic strip until the solution clears and keep the supernatant.Quantify your samples using Quant-IT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit.Note: Typically we have a final concentration between 4-7 ng/\u00b5l. Store at -20 \u00b0C until ready for sequencing.Quality controlRun a qPCR of marker genes after the preparation of the cDNA libraries to assess the quality of the RNA.Note: Here we used Myf6 as a positive control and Pax7 as a negative control. However, any genes that are expressed in myofibers can be used as a positive control and any non-expressed genes can be used for a negative control. To verify tagmentation and library size, run 20 ng of sample on a 1.25% agarose gel with dsGreen (Figure 2C).Note: Run only 2 \u00b5l of DNA ladder that has been diluted 1:2 before use to prevent washing out the signal from the library. Run the sequencing ready libraries on a bioanalyzer to assess the size of the libraries and the concentration (Figure 2D).", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nA schematic of this protocol is shown in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/688-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Close the lid and vortex vigorously for 30 s.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000\u00d7 g; 14,000\u00a0rpm) for 2.50\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C .\nCarefully remove the supernatant by pipetting without removing any of the pellets.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL of ethanol (96%\u2013100%) to the pellet, and mix by vortexing for 30 s.\nNote: This step is essential to remove residual xylene from the sample.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000\u00d7 g; 14,000\u00a0rpm) for 3\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and any residual ethanol by pipetting, without removing any of the pellets.\nTo remove the residual ethanol, open the tube and incubate at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C or up to 37\u00b0C until residual ethanol has evaporated (\u223c10\u00a0min). Do not overdry the samples.\nWhen ethanol has evaporated, remove the samples and pre-heat the thermomixer devices to 90\u00b0C.\nLysis under denaturing conditions with proteinase K.\nResuspend the pellet in 180\u00a0\u03bcL Buffer ATL. Add 20\u00a0\u03bcL proteinase K, and mix by vortexing.\nIncubate at 56\u00b0C using a mixing frequency of 1400\u00a0rpm for 1\u00a0h until the sample has been completely lysed.\nFormalin crosslink reversal.\nIncubate at 90\u00b0C for 1 h.Note: The incubation step at elevated temperature after proteinase K digestion allows to partially remove formalin crosslinking of the released DNA and improve DNA yields. Do not exceed the recommended temperature and incubation time. The degree of DNA fragmentation depends on the type and age of the sample and the conditions used for fixation. As reported before, we recommend to use a fixation time of 16\u201324 h, and discard sections that are exposed to air.\nRNase treatment.\nSpin-down the 1.5\u00a0mL microtube for few s.\nAllow the sample to cool to 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C (\u223c1\u20132\u00a0min) and add 2\u00a0\u03bcL of RNase A (100\u00a0mg/mL) and incubate for 2\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C.\nBinding of DNA to membrane.\nPremix in a 15\u00a0mL conical tube N \u2217 200\u00a0\u03bcL of Buffer AL and N \u2217 200\u00a0\u03bcL of ethanol (96%\u2013100%), being N the number of samples.\nAdd 400\u00a0\u03bcL of Buffer AL+ethanol (96%\u2013100%) mixture to the sample, and mix thoroughly by vortexing. A white precipitate may form on the addition of mixture Buffer AL and ethanol. The precipitate does not interefere with DNA extraction.\nSpin-down the 1.5\u00a0mL microtube for few seconds.\nCarefully transfer the entire lysate to the QIAamp MinElute column (in a 2\u00a0mL collection tube) without wetting the rim.\nCentrifuge at 6000\u00d7 g (8000\u00a0rpm) for 1\u00a0min.\nNote: Take care when removing the QIAamp MinElute column and collection tube from the centrifuge, to avoid contact between QIAamp MinElute column and flow-through.\nPlace the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2\u00a0mL collection tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through. Check if the lysate has completely passed through the membrane after centrifugation, otherwise, centrifuge again until the QIAamp MinElute column is empty.\nAdd 500\u00a0\u03bcL of Buffer AW1 without wetting the rim.Centrifuge at 6000\u00d7 g (8000\u00a0rpm) for 1\u00a0min.\nCarefully, place the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2\u00a0mL collection tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through.\nAdd 500\u00a0\u03bcL Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim.\nCentrifuge at 6000\u00d7 g (8000\u00a0rpm) for 1\u00a0min.\nCarefully, place the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 2\u00a0mL collection tube, and discard the collection tube containing the flow-through.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000\u00d7 g; 14,000\u00a0rpm) for 3\u00a0min to completely dry the membrane and remove residual ethanol.\nDNA elution.\nPlace the QIAamp MinElute column in a clean 1.5\u00a0mL microtube.\nAdd 23\u00a0\u03bcL of 10\u00a0mM Tris pH 7.6 (equilibrated at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C) to the center of the membrane to ensure complete elution of bound DNA.\nNote: Extracted DNA should be stored in a buffer, such as 10\u00a0mM Tris pH 7.6, to avoid acid hydrolysis. Purified water has a low buffering capacity and can significantly decrease the C-Circle template. The volume of elution buffer is according to the amount of starting material and the requirements of the downstream application.\nIncubate at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min.\nCentrifuge at full speed (20,000\u00d7 g; 14,000\u00a0rpm) for 1\u00a0min.\nTo increae DNA yield, repeat step \u2018b-d\u2019 using the eluate from step \u2018d\u2019. Reuse the collection tube from step \u2018a\u2019.\nTransfer the samples to ice before DNA quantification.\nQuantification of genomic DNA\nTiming: 1\u00a0h (for 20 samples)\nTo quantify DNA isolated from FFPE sections we use Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (https://www.thermofisher.Acom/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUXViaXQgZHNETkEgSFMgQXNzYXkgS2l0cw==[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUXViaXQgZHNETkEgSFMgQXNzYXkgS2l0cw==]).\nThe CCA signal is usually reported relative to the corresponding amount of genomic DNA. This method provides an accurate and reproducible DNA sample concentration from 10 pg/\u03bcL to 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL. The assay is performed at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C, and the signal is stable for 3 h.Critical: DNA quantification should be performed at the same time for all the samples, this includes: Tumour and Normal FFPE tissue samples, ALT+ and ALT- control FFPE cells samples. Pipetting accuracy and significant temperature fluctuations within the laboratory can impair DNA quantification outcome. For this reason, we recommend performing a new calibration each time the instrument is used.\nNote: Optimal performance with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay can be obtained when all the solutions are equilibrated at 22\u201328\u02daC, as temperature fluctuations can influence the accuracy of the assay. We suggest not to hold the assay tubes in your hand before reading.\nPrepare Qubit working solution and assay tubes.\nSet up 1\u00d7 0.5\u00a0mL Qubit assay tubes per sample and 2\u00d7 0.5\u00a0mL Qubit assay tubes for standards.\nNote: Label only the lid of the tubes and not the side of the tube, as this could interfere with the sample reading.\nPrepare the Qubit working solution by diluting the Qubit dsDNA HS Reagent 1:200 in Qubit dsDNA HS Buffer in a plastic conical tube. To calculate the total volume of working solution, consider (N\u00a0+ 1) \u2217 200\u00a0\u03bcL, being N the number of samples, and 400\u00a0\u03bcL corresponding to standards.\nNote: Do not mix the working solution in a glass container. The final volume in each tube must be 200\u00a0\u03bcL. Each standard tube requires 190\u00a0\u03bcL of Qubit working solution plus 10\u00a0\u03bcL of each Qubit standard, and each sample tube requires from 180\u2013199\u00a0\u03bcL of Qubit working solution plus 1\u201320\u00a0\u03bcL of sample.\nAdd 190\u00a0\u03bcL of Qubit\u00ae working solution to each of the tubes used for standards.\nAdd 10\u00a0\u03bcL of each Qubit standard to the appropriate tube (Standard # 1: 0\u00a0ng/\u03bcL; Standard # 2: 10\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) mix by vortexing 2\u20133\u00a0s without creating bubbles.Note: Carefully pipet exactly 10\u00a0\u03bcL of each Qubit standard.\nAdd 197\u00a0\u03bcL of Qubit working solution to individual assay tubes.\nAdd 3\u00a0\u03bcL of each sample to the assay tubes containing the volume of Qubit working solution, then mix by vortexing 2\u20133 s.\nIncubate the tubes at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min.\nProceed to Qubit Fluorometers.\nOn the Home screen press \u201cDNA\u201d, select \u201cdsDNA High Sensitivity\u201d, select \u201cRead standards\u201d, select \u201cReading new standards\u201d, press to proceed.\nInsert the tube containing Standard #1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, and then press \u201cRead standard\u201d. When the reading is complete, remove Standard #1.\nInsert the tube containing Standard #2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, and then press \u201cRead standard\u201d. When the reading is complete, remove Standard #2.\nThe instrument displays the results on the Read standard screen.\nProceed with samples reading, press \u201cRun samples\u201d.\nOn the assay screen, select the sample volume: 3\u00a0\u03bcL.\nSelect the units for the output sample concentration (ng/\u03bcL).\nInsert a sample tube into the sample chamber, close the lid, and then press \u201cRead tube\u201d. When the reading is complete, remove the sample tube.\nThe instrument displays the results; the top value is the concentration of the original sample (ng/\u03bcL). The bottom value is the dilution concentration. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nRepeat step \u2018h\u2019 until all samples have been read.\nPause Point: DNA could be stored at \u221280\u00b0C or in a \u221220\u00b0C freezer without a defrost cycle.\nRolling circle amplification\nTiming: 12 hThe rolling circle amplification (RCA) step is an isothermal enzymatic process where the processive phi29 DNA polymerase uses partially single-stranded telomeric (CCCTAA)n DNA circles (C-circles) as a template and amplifies them to form a long single stranded DNA concatemers containing hundreds of tandem repeats that are complementary to the circular template. RCA followed by detection by telomere specific probes has been established as a linear quantitation of ALT activity (Henson et al 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The protocol described here has been adapted from (Henson et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: Starting material for RCA reactions can be as low as 20\u00a0ng, and we recommend no higher than 120\u00a0ng. To obtain reliable results, the same amount of genomic DNA/sample should be used. If you have no information about the nature of your starting material, start with 30 \u2013 40\u00a0ng. If required, add a DNA pre-dilution step with 10\u00a0mM Tris pH 7.6 to obtain the desired DNA amount.\nCritical: Since tumour and normal tissue specimens can contain significant background signal, we recommend to include the following controls in each set of reactions (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Specific background controls: run an RCA reaction in parallel\u00a0to\u00a0all the samples without phi29 polymerase. When insufficient tumor sample is available to allow two reactions/sample, this control can be omitted and the evaluation of C-circles level must be corrected for CCA loading control (refer to the section: Quantification and Statistical Analysis). Global background control: run a single RCA reaction where DNA is omitted. ALT positive and ALT negative controls: positive (U2OS) and negative (HeLa) controls should be included in each set of reactions (i.e., 30\u00a0ng).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/688-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Representative layout of a slot-blotRepresentative layout showing an example of how to load the samples on the slot blot. An internal reference of known ALT positive and ALT negative controls is included, as well as specific background controls, where RCA reaction without phi29 polymerase is loaded in parallel to all the samples, and a single global background control, where DNA is omitted from RCA reaction.\nNote: RCA preparation should be done on ice.\nPrepare RCA reaction.\nThaw Rolling Circle Master Mix (RCMM) and genomic DNA samples on ice.\nDilute desired concentration of genomic DNA (i.e., 30\u00a0ng) in a total volume of 10\u00a0\u03bcL with 10\u00a0mM Tris pH 7.6. Prepare two 0.2\u00a0mL PCR tubes per each sample.\nWhere N is number of samples:\nprepare RCMM without phi29 polymerase: aliquot N \u2217 10\u00a0\u03bcL \u2217 1.2 RCMM\nPrepare RCMM with phi29 polymerase: aliquot N \u2217 9.25\u00a0\u03bcL \u2217 1.2 RCMM, add N \u2217 0.75\u00a0\u03bcL \u2217 1.2 of phi29 polymerase.\nPipet 10\u00a0\u03bcL of RCMM (without phi29) to the first tube containing 10\u00a0\u03bcL genomic DNA sample.\nPipet 10\u00a0\u03bcL of RCMM (with phi29) to the second tube containing 10\u00a0\u03bcL genomic DNA sample.\nMix the resulting 20\u00a0\u03bcL RCA reactions by vortexing 5\u00a0s at 1800\u00a0rpm twice.\nMicrocentrifuge tubes for 10 s.\nIncubate RCA reactions in a thermocycler using the following incubation settings:\n30\u00b0C for 8 h\n70\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min\n10\u00b0C infinite hold\nPause Point: RCA reactions can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for later use.\nTransfer of RCA products to the membrane\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step transfers RCA products to a membrane using a dot or slot-blot apparatus.Critical: Samples that will be directly compared (i.e., samples with and without phi29 polymerase, positive and negative controls) should be blotted in the same membrane (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). When we want to compare a cohort of samples larger than the ones a slot-blot membrane can fit, positive (U2OS) and negative (HeLa) controls should be included in each membrane so the signal of each specimen can be normalized relative to that of U2OS.\nNote: Manage the membrane with clean tweezers, do not touch with gloved hands.\nNote: Samples should be transferred for a native slot-blot, so RCA products can be detected. No denaturation step is needed, do not boil these samples before transferring to the membrane.\nTransfer RCA to Nylon positively charged membrane.\nPrepare a Nylon positively charged membrane and two sheets of Whatman 3 MM chromatography paper, cut so it fits the slot-blotting apparatus.\nSoak membrane in 2\u00d7 SSC buffer for 5\u00a0min.\nWet Whatmann paper in 2\u00d7 SSC buffer.\nIf RCA reactions were stored frozen, thaw on ice.\nAdd 150\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00d7 SSC to 20\u00a0\u03bcL RCA reactions.\nMix the resulting 170\u00a0\u03bcL RCA reactions by vortexing 5 s.\nMicrocentrifuge tubes for 10 s.\nAssemble slot-blot with two Whatman papers and membrane on top.\nNote: Ensure there are no air bubbles (can use a roller to remove bubbles). Do not allow the membrane to dry.\nScrew slot-blot apparatus tight and apply vacuum.\nWash membrane with 200\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00d7 SSC buffer per well and let run until wells empty.\nApply samples and let run until wells empty.\nWash membrane with 200\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00d7 SSC buffer per well and let run until wells empty.\nStop applying vacuum.\nDisassemble slot-blot apparatus. Place membrane, with DNA side facing upwards, onto a dry clean sheet of Whatman paper. Dry membrane for 5\u00a0min.Place the membrane in a 254\u00a0nm UV cross-linker. Cross-link DNA onto the membrane at a setting of 120 mJ/cm2. Flip the membrane (DNA side facing down) and repeat.\nPause Point: Membrane may be stored for later use. Protect the membrane in between 2 sheets of dry Whatman paper and store at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C.\nNon-radioactive detection of C-circle blotted products\nTiming: 48\u201372 h\nThe CCA products are detected by native slot-blot with DIG-labeled telomere probes and corrected for CCA loading control with a DIG-labeled probe for repetitive Alu elements (Batzer and Deininger 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). After hybridization, C-circles are detected with an anti-DIG-AP antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase which catalyzes the chemiluminescent reaction. Chemiluminescent alkaline phosphatase substrate (CDP-STAR) is used to detect the DIG signal in the slot-blot. The protocol described here has been adapted from (Kimura et\u00a0al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: The volume of solutions reported in the protocol are considered for a membrane sheet of approximately 11.9\u00a0\u00d7 7.8\u00a0cm. Scale the volumes accordingly to process membranes of different sizes.\nTo label the telomere and Alu oligonucleotides we use the DIG oligonucleotide 3\u2019-end labeling kit, 2nd generation (Roche) (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Roche/Bulletin/1/03353575910bul.pdf[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Roche/Bulletin/1/03353575910bul.pdf]). This kit uses terminal transferase to enzymatically label oligonucleotides at their 3\u2019 ends by incorporation of a single DIG-labeled dideoxyuridine-triphosphate (DIG-ddUTP).\nNote: After the labelling procedure, we recommend determining the labelling efficiency of the probe. This step is essential to calculate the correct amount of probe needed for the hybridization step (12.d).\nCritical: The kit (vial 1) contains potassium cacodylate that is toxic by inhalation and if swallowed. Use gloves when handling and discard according to regulation for toxic waste.\nLabeling of telomere and Alu probe and determination of labeling efficiency.\nAdd 100 pmol oligonucleotides in a DNase-RNase free PCR tube.Note: we suggest preparing 4 PCR tubes for each oligonucleotide and process in parallel so probe can be stored for later use.\nIn each PCR tube, add DNase-RNase free water to make a final volume of 10\u00a0\u03bcL.\nPlace the PCR tubes on ice and sequentially add: 4\u00a0\u03bcL of Reaction Buffer 5\u00d7 (Vial 1). 4\u00a0\u03bcL of CoCl2 solution (Vial 2). 1\u00a0\u03bcL of DIG-ddUTP solution (Vial 3). 1\u00a0\u03bcL of Terminal transferase (400\u00a0U,Vial 4).\nMix with pipetting up and down and spin down.\nIncubate at 37\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min in a thermocycler, then keep on ice.\nAdd 2\u00a0\u03bcL of 0.2\u00a0M EDTA (pH 8) to stop the reaction.\nAdd 18\u00a0\u03bcL of DNase-RNase free water to dilute the labeled oligonucleotides to a concentration of 2.5 pmol/\u03bcL.\nPrepare serial dilution of labeled probes and labeled control oligonucleotides from the kit (Oligonucleotide, DIG-ddUTP labeled; Vial 6) from 1:1 to 1:1000.\nSpot 1\u00a0\u03bcL of each serial dilution/probe along serial dilution of control oligonucleotide DIG-ddUTP labeled on a Hybond N+ positively charged nylon membrane (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/688-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Determination of probe labeling efficiency\n(A and B) (A) The 3\u2019 DIG-labeled telomere (Telo) and Alu probes were synthesized from 100 pmol of template. Serial diluitions of each probe, were spotted on a Hybond N+ positively charged nylon membrane, besides the corresponding diluition of DIG-labeled control DNA (Co-oligo), used as a reference. The membrane was analyzed by direct detection procedure (B) followed by analysis of the relative intensities to calculate the amount of DIG labeled oligonucleotide in the sample probe preparation. Data are represented as mean\u00a0+/- SD.Place the membrane, oligonucleotides side facing upward, in a 254\u00a0nm UV cross-linker at a setting of 120 mJ/cm2 to fix the nucleic acid to the membrane.

Chemiluminescence detection, to develop the membrane and determine the probe efficiency.\nCompare the intensity of the probe spots to the intensity of control Oligonucleotide DIG-ddUTP labeled spots to determine the reach of full sensitivity (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Use the relative intensities to calculate the amount of DIG labeled oligonucleotide in the sample probe preparation needed for the hybridization step (12.d).\nStore labeled probes in 20\u00a0\u03bcL working aliquots at \u221220\u00b0C.\nHybridization of C-circle slot-blot membrane.\nPrepare 50\u00a0mL of prehybridization buffer and place it in a hybridization oven at 65\u00b0C to equilibrate.\nPlace the cross-linked membrane onto a nylon mesh and carefully place it in a hybridization tube with the DNA side inward.\nAdd 25\u00a0mL of prehybridization buffer and place in a rotating hybridization oven for 2\u00a0h at 65\u00b0C.\nNote: The optimal hybridization temperature is related to the GC content of the probe, homology of the probe to the target and hybridization buffer composition. If the alternative DIG Easy Hyb (Roche) or Standard Buffer containing 50% formamide are used, consider calculating an optimal hybridization temperature.\nPrepare hybridization solution by combining 25\u00a0mL of fresh pre-hybridization buffer with 20\u00a0\u03bcL of telomere DIG-3\u2019end labeled probe (from a stock where probe efficiency was calculated as 2.5 pmol/\u03bcL).Equilibrate the hybridization solution in the hybridization oven at 65\u00b0C.\nNote: Concentration of 3\u2019end labeled oligonucleotide probe in hybridization buffer is recommended between 1 \u2013 10 pmol/mL, with a hybridization time between 6\u00a0h up to 18 h.\nDiscard prehybridization solution and add 25\u00a0mL of pre-equilibrated hybridization solution, place the tube with the membrane in a rotating hybridization oven, incubate \u223c 18\u201320\u00a0h at 65\u00b0C.\nChemiluminescence detection\nBefore you start, prepare 100\u00a0mL of blocking solution and allow to cool down to 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C (\u223c15\u00a0min) before use.\nTransfer the membrane to a membrane-staining box and wash three times with 200\u00a0mL of Wash buffer 1 on a rotational shaker for 15\u00a0min.\nCarefully remove Wash buffer 1 and wash the membrane with 200\u00a0mL of 2\u00d7 SSC for 20\u00a0min.\nPlace the membrane in a clean heat-sealable bag and add 60\u00a0mL of blocking buffer (20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C).

If counting cells manually, dilution of the cell suspension is recommended to shorten the cell counting time.\nCytotoxicity test\nTiming: 5\u20137\u00a0days\nTo distinguish whether a chemical has a specific adverse effect on the FGF signaling pathway, it is necessary to show that the effect occurs at concentrations lower than those that cause severe cell injury. Therefore, prior to evaluating the effects of chemicals on signaling pathways, the relationship between the chemical concentration and cell viability must be evaluated.\nSeed the established cell lines in Geltrex-coated flat-bottomed 96-well culture plates at a viable cell density of 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells/well.\nNote: Because evaporation of the culture medium may adversely affect the assay, fill the outermost wells of a 96-well plate with sterile water and only use the central 60 wells for the assay.\nThe following day, replace the medium with 100\u00a0\u03bcL/well of StemFlex medium.\nWhen 40%\u201360% confluency is reached, perform the cytotoxicity test. Immediately prior to the addition of the chemical, replace the medium with 100\u00a0\u03bcL/well of StemFlex medium.Add the chemical stock to the StemFlex medium so that the final concentration of the solvent, PBS or DMSO, is at an upper limit of 10% and 1%, respectively. This will result in a solvent concentration with an upper limit of 1% and 0.1% for PBS and DMSO, respectively, after addition to the wells.\nNote: For chemicals that are not fully soluble in the medium due to low water solubility, mix the chemical stock with DMSO and then add to StemFlex medium at the final concentration determined by the solubility test. The final concentration of DMSO in the medium should also be 1% in this case.\nNote: The maximum concentration of the chemical to be used in the toxicity study was set at 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in a previous study (Genschow et\u00a0al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Thus, 10000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL is the upper concentration limit of the chemical solution before addition. This will result in a final concentration of 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL after addition to the wells.\nFurther, dilute the test chemical solution from step 10 with StemFlex medium to make a 2-fold dilution series and add 11\u00a0\u03bcL to each well. For non-treated groups, provide a final concentration of 1% PBS or 0.1% DMSO, depending on the solvent used for the test chemical. (0 h).\nTwenty hours after the addition of the test chemical, add 10\u00a0\u03bcL/well of CCK-8, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 4 h. For all tests, prepare a cell-free control as a blank with only CCK-8 reagent added to the medium. (20 h).\nMeasure the absorbance at 450\u00a0nm in each well 4\u00a0h after CCK-8 addition. (24 h).Note: Similar to the CCK-8 assay, MTT assay and resazurin assay can also be used to evaluate cell growth inhibition caused by chemical exposure with the reduced activity of living cells as an indicator.\nSubtract the absorbance of the blank from that of each sample well. Compare the absorbance readings obtained under the experimental conditions with those of the vehicle control group and calculate the cell viability as follows:\n  C e l l  v i a b i l i t y =   A b  s  s a m p l e   \u2212 A b  s  b l a n k     A b  s  v e h i c l e   \u2212 A b  s  b l a n k      \nPerform a total of at least three biological replicates and calculate the relationship between drug concentration and cell viability. Then, fit a four-parameter Log-Logistic curve using the LL.4 model of the drc package, an R language program, to estimate the 50% inhibitory concentration of viability (IC50).\nSignal disruption assay\nTiming: 6\u00a0days\nFour days before adding the ligand, seed the established cell lines in 96-well white plates at 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells/well.\nNote: Because evaporation of the culture medium may adversely affect the assay, fill the outermost wells of a 96-well plate with sterile water and use only the central 60 wells for the assay.\nThe following day, replace the medium with 200\u00a0\u03bcL/well of StemFlex medium.\nThe day before ligand addition, replace the medium with 100\u00a0\u03bcL/well of APEL2 medium.\nNote: StemFlex medium contains a variety of growth factors, including bFGF. To minimize the influence of components of the medium and to reproducibly assess FGF signal disruption, a recombinant protein-based medium that does not contain animal products such as bFGF should be used for the assay.Replace the medium with 100\u00a0\u03bcL/well of APEL2 medium (+1% endurazine) at least 2\u00a0h before adding the test chemical.\nNote: It takes 2\u00a0h for the luminescent substrate to equilibrate in/out of the cell.\nMeasure the luminescence intensity of each well immediately before adding the chemical.\nAdd the chemical stock to APEL2 medium so that the final concentration of the solvent, PBS or DMSO, is at an upper limit of 10% and 1%, respectively. This will result in a solvent concentration with an upper limit of 1% and 0.1% for PBS and DMSO, respectively, after addition to the wells.\nNote: For chemicals that do not completely dissolve in the medium due to low water solubility, the chemical stock should be mixed with DMSO and then added to the APEL2 medium at the final concentration determined by the solubility test described above. In this case, the final concentration of DMSO in the medium should also be 1%.\nNote: The maximum concentration of chemicals to be used in the toxicity study was set to 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in a previous study (Genschow et\u00a0al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Thus, 10000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL is the upper concentration limit of the chemical solution before addition. This will result in a final concentration of 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL after addition to the wells.\nNote: For chemicals with strong cytotoxicity, the half growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) estimated from the cytotoxicity test should be used as the final concentration after addition to the wells.\nFurther, dilute the test chemical solution from step 21 with APEL2 medium to make a 2-fold dilution series with a total of 8 concentrations per chemical and add 11\u00a0\u03bcL to each well. For non-treated groups, administer a final concentration of 1% PBS or 0.1% DMSO, depending on the solvent of the test chemical. (-1 h).Measure the luminescence intensity of each well immediately before ligand addition.\nAdd 12\u00a0\u03bcL/well of bFGF diluted to 20\u00a0ng/mL in APEL2 medium to a final concentration of 2\u00a0ng/mL. For non-treated groups, prepare a solution of PBS (+ 0.1% BSA) and the bFGF solvent diluted 1000-fold in APEL2 medium and add 12\u00a0\u03bcL/well. (0 h).\nMeasure the luminescence intensity of each well at repeated time intervals. The manufacturer\u2019s manual indicates that the luminescence can be stably detected for up to 72 h.

Keep the collection dish on the slide warmer, and put the culture dish into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nInject intraperitoneally 5 IU of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG, see the Table of Materials) into sexually mature (6-8 week-old) Cep192-eGFP reporter female mice 44-48 h before oocyte collection.\nSacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation, identify and remove the ovaries21, and transfer them into a watch glass containing prewarmed collection medium (MEM/PVP + M) at 37 \u00b0C.\nFix the ovary by touching a 1 mL syringe to the bottom of the watch glass and puncturing it several times (~40 times per ovary) using sewing needles bundled together to release the oocytes into the medium.\nUsing a plastic transfer pipet, transfer all the medium containing the cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from step 1.7 into an empty 100 mm plastic Petri dish.\nUnder\u00a0a stereomicroscope, collect the COCs using a Pasteur glass pipet, and transfer them to the collection dish that contains MEM/PVP + M.\nUsing a narrow Pasteur glass pipet (approximately 100 \u00b5m in diameter), denude the oocytes mechanically by gentle repetitive pipetting, followed by transferring and washing them in four microdrops of (100 \u00b5L) MEM/PVP + M (the collection dish) prior to their transfer into the CZB + M culture dish.\nIncubate the denuded oocytes for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% of CO2 in the air.\n2. Oocyte microinjectionPlace a 250 \u00b5L drop of MEM/PVP + M into a 100 mm plastic Petri dish lid, and cover it with mineral oil.\n\tNOTE: The Petri dish lid has a lower rim that provides more space for adjusting the micromanipulator.\nTurn on the microinjection system (see the Table of Materials).\nPlace the microinjection dish on the warming stage (37 \u00b0C) of the microscope.\nLoad the injection needle with 0.5 \u00b5L of mCh-Cep192cRNA using microloader pipette tips (see Table of Materials), and secure the injection needle to the micromanipulator.\nTransfer the denuded oocytes (step 1.11) to the 250 \u00b5L microdrop (step 2.1).\nUnder a 20x or 40x objective lens, adjust the position and the focus of the injection and holding needles according to the oocyte position (Figure 1).\nSet up the microinjection unit, and set the injection pressure (pi), compensation pressure (pc), and injection time (ti) to be able to inject 5-10 pl of mCh-Cep192 cRNA (to exogenously label the MTOCs).\nCarefully inject the oocytes without touching the nucleus.\nOnce all the oocytes are injected, wash them in three microdrops of CZB + M, transfer them to the culture dish (CZB + M), and incubate them for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C to allow mCh-Cep192 expression.\n3. Oocyte maturation\nPrepare the maturation medium by adding glutamine (1 mM) to CZB medium pre-equilibrated in an incubator with 5% CO2 in air at 37 \u00b0C for at least 3 h.\nMake two microdrops (100 \u00b5L) of the maturation medium in a 35 mm Petri dish, and cover them with mineral oil (maturation dish).\nWash prophase I-arrested oocytes at least three times in 100 \u00b5L milrinone-free CZB microdrops to completely remove the milrinone and allow meiotic resumption.Transfer the oocytes to the maturation dish, and incubate them for 5 h (prometaphase I stage) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in air at 37 \u00b0C.\n4. Oocyte preparation for ablation and imaging\nTransfer the prometaphase I oocytes (step 3.4) to a glass-bottom culture dish containing 100 \u00b5L of maturation medium (step 3.1) covered with mineral oil.\n5. Microscope preparation for ablation\nAt least 30 min before ablation, turn on the temperature controller for the stage incubator (see Table of Materials) and set it at 37 \u00b0C.\nTurn on the CO2 controller and set it at 5% CO2.\nSelect a 40x oil immersion apochromatic objective, and apply a small drop of the immersion oil.\nMount the glass-bottom culture dish with the oocytes on a stage-top incubator, and cover the incubator with a gas lid.\nIn the image acquisition software (see the Table of Materials), select an option enabling the saving of multiple stage positions (e.g., \"Define mark and find experiment\"). Using transmitted light brightfield illumination, center on the individual oocytes and save their positions.\nIn the image acquisition software, select the XYZ scanning mode, set the image format to 256 x 256 pixels, set the zoom factor to 2.5x - 3.0x, and select a scanning frequency of 600 Hz. This corresponds to a pixel dwell time of approximately 1.6 \u00b5s.Set a 488 nm excitation laser line at approximately 10% of the laser power (which corresponds to 4.0 \u00b5W at the sample level) (see Table of Materials), and use a spectral bandwidth of 500-550 nm to observe the GFP signal from the MTOCs. For the simultaneous observation of fluorescence from the mCherry-tagged Cep192, set a 585 nm excitation laser line at approximately 8% of the laser power (which corresponds to 10.7 \u00b5W at the sample level), and use another detector set to a spectral bandwidth of 595-645 nm.\n\tNOTE: It is helpful to use the confocal microscope's transmitted light detector (TLD) for concurrently detecting oocyte boundaries.\nUsing a live scanning mode and the manual control of the z-drive, screen the oocyte for MTOCs.\nOnce an mcMTOC is detected, draw a square region of interest (ROI) around it.\n6. Ablation of mcMTOCs\nSet a femtosecond laser to a 740 nm wavelength.\n\tNOTE: The laser wavelength can be changed according to the microscope and the laser conditions.\nUse the electro-optic modulator of the multi-photon microscope (see Table of Materials) to set the laser power to 70%-80%, corresponding to 60-70 mW power at the sample plane.\n\tNOTE: If the laser is equipped with a femtosecond pulse compensator, use it to correct for group delay dispersion (GDD). GDD correction reduces the amount of laser power required for efficient mcMTOC ablation and minimizes photodamage to the oocyte. The GDD control is usually integrated with the image acquisition software of commercial multi-photon microscopes.\nUse the same image format, zoom factor, and scanning frequency as in step 5.6. Set the line and frame averaging parameters to 1.\nClick on the Scan button in the software to perform the ablation of the mcMTOC by conducting a single laser scan of the selected ROI.Use the channel settings from step 5.7 to review the results of the ablation by comparing the images of the GFP-labeled structures taken before and after the multi-photon laser exposure. If the ablation is successful, the intensity of the GFP fluorescence in the targeted mcMTOC decreases to the levels observed in the background.\nIf some fragments of a GFP-labeling structure remain, repeat step 6.4 one or more times by focusing on various z planes of the mcMTOC.\nUse the channel settings from step 5.7 to verify the ablation efficiency by the complete loss of mcMTOC-associated mCherry signals (mCh-Cep192).\nRepeat step 5.8 to step 6.7 until all the MTOCs of an oocyte (at various focal planes) are ablated.\n\tNOTE: This protocol uses mCh-Cep192 microinjection as a strategy to confirm mcMTOC depletion following multi-photon laser exposure and exclude the possibility that the loss of GFP fluorescence is caused by GFP photobleaching. However, the microinjection of this probe is optional and not required for the ablation procedure.", "Preparation of membranesGrow Caulobacter in PYE media at 30 \u00b0C till OD660 is 0.6-0.8.Spin 2 L of Caulobacter culture at 10,000 x g for 12 min at 4 \u00b0C. For all following steps, keep everything on ice.Resuspend cell pellet with spheroplasting buffer. The volume of spheroplasting buffer required (in ml) = [(OD660 x ml culture volume)/100] x 7. For example, a cell pellet from a 2 L culture with an OD660 of 0.8 will be resuspended by 112 ml of spheroblasting buffer.Add 100 mg/ml lysozyme (dissolved in spheroplasting buffer). Leave on ice for 2 min. For cultures grown in M2G minimal media, use less lysozyme (50 mg/ml) as cell grown under these conditions have weaker cell walls. M2G minimal media can be used to examine differential expression of outer membrane proteins as a result of carbon starvation.Add 1 tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail, 25 \u03bcg/ml Dnase I (final concentration) and 10 mM MgCl2 (final concentration).Add 2 volumes of cold lysis buffer to the cells. This must be done slowly to avoid localised cell lysis. Add the lysis buffer at a rate of 4-6 ml/min, either drop-wise with a pipette or using a peristaltic pump. The cell solution must be constantly swirled during the addition of lysis buffer to avoid localised lysis.Completely lyse the cells with the Avestin Emulsiflex using homogenizing pressure set to ~12,000-15,000 psi.Pellet insoluble debris at 10,000 x g, 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. Collect the supernatant (contains membranes).Spin the supernatant in the Beckman ultracentrifuge using the Ti45 rotor (36,000 rpm, 1.5 h, 4 \u00b0C). After the spin, keep the membrane pellet and discard the supernatant.To wash membranes, resuspend the membrane pellets in 50-100 ml of spheroblasting buffer and repeat step 9. Addition of 1x protease inhibitor cocktail to the spheroblasting buffer for the wash step is optional.Resuspend the membrane pellet using ~ 6-7 ml of 25% sucrose (w/v). Addition of 1x protease inhibitor cocktail to the sucrose solution is optional but unnecessary.Fractionation of cell membranesPrepare the sucrose gradients using the Beckman Ultra-Clear tubes. Use Beckman tubes (14 x 95 mm) for the SW40 rotor. The sucrose gradient consists of 1.7 mL each of 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30% sucrose. To pour the sucrose gradient, pipette the required volume for each sucrose concentration into an eppendorf tube. Using a plastic pasteur pipette, transfer 60% sucrose solution from the eppendorf tube to the bottom of the Ultra-clear tube. Hold the Ultra-clear tube at 45\u00b0 angle before transferring the 55% sucrose solution by slowly adding it drop-by-drop near the 60% sucrose solution. Then add 50, 45, 40, 35 and 30% sucrose. I found this particular method minimised disruption to the gradient.Add ~ 1.2 ml of membrane sample (from step 10) on top of the sucrose gradient. Make sure to balance the sucrose gradient tubes with the SW40 rotor tubes.Spin sucrose gradients for 40 h in a SW40 rotor at 34,000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C to fractionate the membranes by equilibrium sedimentation. Use slow break so the sucrose gradient is maintained.The gradient should have a yellow-brown region (inner membranes) and a cloudy white region (outer membranes). Isolate 0.5 ml fractions using the Brandel/Foxy Jr fractionator and 2 M sucrose (in 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) as the displacing fluid. Alternatively, collect 0.5 ml fractions from the top of the gradient. Fractions 9-12 generally contain inner membranes and fractions 16-18 contain outer membranes from a total of approximately 23 fractions.To confirm, perform western blot analysis using an antibody against an inner and an outer membrane protein (see figure below showing 20 \u03bcl of each fraction for SDS-PAGE and analysis by Coomassie; and 5 \u03bcl of each fraction analysed by western blotting using our in-house antibodies).Freeze fractions in liquid N2 and store at -80 \u00b0C. For further analysis, pool relevant fractions and wash in TEM buffer before resuspending membranes in the buffer of choice. To wash, mix fractions with at least 5 volumes of TEM buffer and spin in the Beckman ultracentrifuge (36,000 rpm, 1.5 h, 4\u00b0C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140925/20140925040659_7786.jpgFigure 1.

Preparations\nNOTE: The protocol described below has been optimized for the use with REF52 cells and ATM+/+ or ATM-/- human fibroblasts. Other cell types may require further optimization as described in the notes and troubleshooting sections below.\nMake 500 mL of complete cell culture medium for REF52 cells. To 500 mL of high-glucose containing Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) add 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin.\nPrepare a 25 \u03bcg/mL solution of fibronectin (FN) by adding 300 \u03bcL of 1 mg/mL FN solution to 12 mL of sterile 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Mix well.\nPrepare a 0.5% (w/v) delipidated (i.e., fatty acid free) bovine serum albumin (dlBSA) solution in serum free DMEM cell culture medium. Add 0.5 g of dlBSA to 100 mL of serum free DMEM medium. Mix the solution well, but do not vortex. Sterile filter the solution into a new sterile container, using a 0.22 \u03bcM syringe filter before use. Store at 4 \u00b0C.\nMake 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution by dissolving 3.7 g of paraformaldehyde in 100 mL of 1x PBS. Use gentle heat and stirring to get the paraformaldehyde into solution.\n\tNOTE: The paraformaldehyde solution is light sensitive and should be protected from light. It is good for up to one week when stored at 4 \u00b0C.\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is toxic, flammable, corrosive and a health hazard. Review the material safety data sheet for paraformaldehyde prior to use. Use the appropriate personal protective equipment when handling including eye shield, face shield, full-face particle respirator, gloves, and lab coat.\nPrepare the permeabilization solution containing 0.2% non-ionic surfactant in 1x PBS (v/v). For 100 mL, slowly add 0.2 mL of Triton X-100 to 100 mL of 1x PBS, while stirring.Make the immunofluorescence blocking buffer containing 2.5% BSA, 5% goat serum, and 0.05% non-ionic surfactant (w/v/v) dissolved in 1x PBS solution. For 100 mL, add 5 mL of goat serum, 2.5 g of BSA and 0.05 mL of Triton X-100 in ~ 95 mL 1x PBS, while stirring.\nGrow REF52 cells in DMEM complete culture medium in a 10 cm2 (or any other vessel size) cell culture-treated plate in a cell culture incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\n2. Coating cell culture plates with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin\nNOTE: Perform this section using aseptic technique and sterile reagents in a BSL-2 certified laminar flow hood. Refer to Figure 1A for an overview of key steps prior to beginning.\nUsing a tissue culture certified 24-well plate, place one glass coverslip (12-Cir-1) in each well. Label the plate according to Figure 1B.\nPipette 500 \u03bcL of the 25 \u03bcg/mL FN solution to each well of a 24-well plate.\nPipette the solution over each coverslip a few times to ensure even coating and complete submersion. Place the lid back on the plate.\nIncubate the plate in a cell culture incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, incubate overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\nAfter 1 h, remove the plate from the incubator and aspirate the FN solution from the wells.\nWash wells three times with 500 \u03bcL of 1x PBS. Aspirate the final wash of 1x PBS.\nBlock wells with 500 \u03bcL of 0.5% dlBSA solution for a minimum of 15 min at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nAspirate the dlBSA solution prior to plating cells in step 3 below.NOTE: If storing plates, add 500 \u03bcL of 1x PBS to each coverslip after aspiration of the dlBSA solution. Plates can then be kept at 4 \u00b0C for up to one week.\n3. Preparing anchorage-dependent cells for the adhesion assay\nNOTE: Perform this section using aseptic technique and sterile reagents in a BSL-2 certified laminar flow hood.\nAt least 30 min prior to the cell plating, pre-warm the following solutions: DMEM complete medium, dlBSA solution, 1x PBS, 0.5% trypsin-EDTA solution, and trypsin neutralizing serum (TNS) in a 37\u00b0C water bath.\nStarting with a confluent monolayer of REF52 cells in a 10 cm2 dish, wash cells twice with 6 mL of warm 1x PBS. Serum starve the cells for at least 1 h (depending on cell type) in 6 mL of warm dlBSA solution at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nWash cells with 6 mL of warmed 1x PBS, aspirate PBS and add 1.5 mL of warm 0.5% Trypsin-EDTA solution.\nPlace cells in a cell culture incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for ~2 min.\nObserve cells under a light microscope to ensure the detachment is complete. If cells are still adherent after tapping the plate on the bench top, return to the 37 \u00b0C incubator for an additional 2 min. Trypsinize the cells for as little time as is necessary.\nPipette 1.5 mL of warm trypsin neutralizing solution (TNS) to the dish to stop trypsinization and collect detached cells. Pipette the solution up and down over the bottom of the plate numerous times to remove all remaining adherent cells. If cells appear clumpy, further triturate the cell suspension by gently pipetting up and down over the back of the dish.\nCount cells using trypan blue exclusion and a hemocytometer under a light microscope. Alternatively, use an automated cell counter.Remove an appropriate amount of cells to create a 1.0 - 3.0 x 104 cells/mL cell suspension in 5 mL of dlBSA in a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge cells at ~ 300 x g for 5 min using a fixed angle rotor in a table-top centrifuge.\nAspirate the supernatant from the cell pellet, and resuspend cells in a total of 7 mL of warm dlBSA solution. Do not allow the cells to be overly confluent upon coverslip plating, but evenly distributed with few cells touching one another.\nEvenly divide the cell suspension into two 15 mL conical tubes, one for the vehicle alone control (DMSO) and one for Ku55933 (ATM kinase inhibitor, oxidant)5. Ensure each tube contains 3.5 mL of the cell suspension.\nUsing a tube rotator, revolve the tubes at 37 \u00b0C for 90-120 min in a cell culture incubator.\n30 min before plating, add a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM Ku55933 and DMSO (1:1,000) to each respective tube. Place the cell suspension back on the rotator for the remaining time.\nImmediately prior to plating the cells, retrieve the 24-well plate from the incubator and aspirate the dlBSA solution.\nAfter revolving the cell suspension for 90-120 min, remove 500 \u03bcL of cell suspension from each treatment group and add to one FN coated coverslip in the 24-well plate from step 2 as illustrated (Figure 1B). Return the plate to the 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 cell culture incubator and the cell suspension back to the rotation.\nAfter plating the cell suspension on the FN covered-coverslips, allow cells to adhere for the desired length of time (e.g., 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min) and then immediately proceed to step 4.\n4. Cell fixation and antibody staining for immunofluorescenceNOTE: The following steps are performed under non-sterile conditions and at room temperature unless otherwise stated.\nAfter the desired time for adhesion has passed, aspirate the cell solution from each coverslip in the plate.\nUsing the sides of the well, gently dispense 500 \u03bcL of 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution onto each coverslip and wait 10-15 min.\nRemove the paraformaldehyde solution and wash each coverslip with 500 \u03bcL of 1x PBS for a total of two times.\n\tNOTE: Dispose of paraformaldehyde waste responsibly, according to the institution\u2019s environmental health and safety plan.\nAspirate the PBS, and permeabilize cells on each coverslip with 500 \u03bcL of 0.2% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS (v/v) for 10-15 min at room temperature.\nWash each coverslip with 500 \u03bcL of 1x PBS three times.\nBlock cells on each coverslip with 500 \u03bcL of immunofluorescence blocking buffer containing 5% goat serum, 2.5% BSA and 0.05% Triton X-100 dissolved in a 1 x PBS solution for 30-60 minutes.\nDilute the primary anti-paxillin antibody (1:250) in the blocking buffer. Mix well and add 200 \u03bcL of the antibody solution to each coverslip. Incubate at room temperature for at least 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the primary antibody solution can be incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. There are many common focal adhesion markers that could be used for staining adhesion complexes and subsequent FA analysis. These include antibodies against the following proteins: integrin subunits (\u03b21, \u03b15, or \u03b1V), talin, or vinculin2.\nAspirate the antibody solution, and wash each coverslip with 500 \u03bcL of 1x PBS three times for 10 min each. Protect the samples from light from this point forward.Dilute the phalloidin F-actin probe conjugated to the red fluorescent Alexa 594 dye (1:1000) and goat-anti mouse 488 fluorescent secondary antibody (1:400) in the same blocking buffer solution. Mix well and add 200 \u03bcL of the antibody solution to each coverslip for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies from other species may be used as well. However, the use of antibodies from other species will require modification of the blocking buffer serum.\nAspirate the antibody solution, and wash each coverslip with 500 \u03bcL of 1x PBS three times for 10 min each.\nAspirate the 1x PBS and rinse one time with 500 \u03bcL of dIH2O.\nMount coverslips onto microscope slides using anti-fade mounting medium containing DAPI.\nLeave microscope slides to set overnight in the dark at room temperature.\nStore microscope slides in the dark at 4 \u02daC for the long-term storage and until imaging.\n\tNOTE: Image using standard immunofluorescence techniques. It is recommended to use a high-powered oil immersion 60x objective lens to ensure enough resolution to note the focal adhesions and peripheral ruffles at cell edges. Acquire images of 20-30 cells in multiple fields of view for each coverslip under each treatment condition and time. From combined replicates, this should yield at least 60 cells in order to perform statistical analysis. Save and export fluorescence images as a .TIFF file with a minimum of 300 dpi resolution.\n5. Quantifying stress fibers, cell circularity, and focal adhesion formation\nNOTE: The following image analyses are performed using the latest version of the open source imaging processing package Fiji Is Just Image J (Fiji), which can be downloaded free of charge at (http://fiji.sc/).\nGeneral image processingNOTE: All images will need to be prepared for computational analyses by performing steps 5.1.1-5.1.5 below (Figure 2). Afterward, any or all subsequent quantification procedures may be selected.\n\t\nOpen the .TIFF fluorescence image using Fiji.

Check Sliding Paraboloid and select the option of a Rolling Ball Radius of 50 pixels (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: To verify the proper size for the rolling ball radius, select the Line Tool and draw a radius on the largest adhesion in the image. Select Measure to verify the length of the line drawn. If the value of the radius is too large, features including adhesions will be lost in the image. If the radius is too small, it will give rise to artifacts in the processed image due to background noise.\nSelect Image-Adjust- Brightness/Contrast to check the intensity of the adhesion over the background. Adjust if necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: To optimize the brightness/contrast and avoid saturating the signal, use the lookup tool of the image to examine its histogram to adjust the brightness/contrast.\nSelect the following parameters under Analyze-Set Measurements: Area, Mean Gray Value, Shape Descriptors, and Integrated Density.\nStress fiber formation analysis\n\tNOTE: Stress fibers can be quantified multiple ways depending on the phenotype.\n\t\nCount the number of cells with stress fibers as a percentage over the total number of cells. This analysis is best if there are visual differences in the number of stress fibers formed under different experimental conditions.\nCount the number of stress fibers that transverse the cell. This analysis allows for the comparison of the number of stress fibers formed per cell.Measure the total fluorescence intensity given by the phalloidin (e.g., F-actin) staining per cell17,18. This method will highlight drastic increases/decreases in fluorescence intensity due to F-actin staining.\n\t\t\nSet the measurement parameters in step 5.1.5 above.\nSelect the Freehand Tool in the Fiji toolbar and manually trace the cell(s) of interest. Select Analyze-Measure. A new window will appear showing the selected measurement parameters.\nSelect the Freehand Tool in the Fiji toolbar and manually trace an empty space with no cells present. Select Analyze-Measure. This measurement will serve as the background fluorescence.\nUse the equation below to determine the total F-actin fluorescence per cell:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59989/59989equ01.jpg\n\t\t\tNOTE: The resulting measurement can be normalized and compared to other cells to give F-actin fluorescence per cell.\nCell circularity analysis\n\tNOTE: Information on cell area (an indicator of cell spreading over time), as well as, the circularity can also be recorded. This measurement is given as a ratio between 0 to 1 as a way to quantify cells that are elongated to round, respectively.\n\t\nSelect the Freehand Tool in the Fiji toolbar, and trace an individual cell. Select Image-Measure and record the cell area and perimeter measurements for each cell. Repeat this procedure for each cell.\n\t\tNOTE: Under the Set Measurements function, circularity is provided as the Shape Descriptors measurement (step 5.1.5).\nManually count actin-enriched ruffling or protrusions per cell as depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4.\nFocal adhesion analysis\n\tNOTE: Before performing focal adhesion analysis, install the Mexican Hat Filter plugin on the latest version of Fiji. The following protocol has been modified from previous studies19,20,21.\n\t\nSelect Process-Enhance Local Contrast (Clahe) using a block size of 19, histogram bins 256, and a maximum slope of 6, with no mask and not fast. (Figure 2C)Select Process-Filters- Gaussian Blur with a Sigma (Radius) of 2.0 to filter the image (Figure 2D).\nSelect Plugins-Mexican Hat Filter (Mhf) with a Radius of 2.0 (Figure 2E).\nRun Threshold and select Dark Background and Over/Under using either Huang or Isodata as the thresholding method. Select Auto-Threshold.\n\t\tNOTE: This step ensures that adhesions are highlighted, but also distinct from one another.\nSelect Analyze-Analyze Particles with the following parameters selected: size=20, pixels-infinity and circularity=0.00-0.99. Check the outlines to ensure the proper detection and separation of focal adhesions.\n\t\tNOTE: These results yield the number, area, and shape description of individual focal adhesions.\nSubscription Required.

To trigger egg laying, primed frogs must be injected the day before with a high dose of gonadotropin.\nSee frog priming and ovulation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2] for a list of required materials.\nOne day before the experiment, induce ovulation by injecting 500 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) into the dorsal lymph sacs of each primed frog, using a fine 27-gauge hypodermic needle and sterile 1-mL syringe (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: To improve egg yield, frogs should be injected between 16\u201324\u00a0h before egg extract preparation.\nCritical: Discard used needles in an appropriate sharps-collection container.\nTransfer each frog into 2\u00a0L of 1\u00d7 MMR buffer and house overnight at 16\u00b0C in separate containers.\nNote: MMR buffer46[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib46] improves the quality of the eggs and helps prevent premature activation of the eggs before they can be collected.47[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib47] Please see the next section on preparation of egg extract for more information.\nCritical: Frogs should not be maintained in MMR buffer for longer than 16\u00a0h to avoid osmotic stress.

It is imperative to lock the extract in interphase of the cell cycle for the import reactions to work, because peroxisomal matrix protein import is turned off during cell division by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinases.48[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib48] Freshly harvested eggs are arrested in metaphase,49[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib49] but progress into interphase upon being crushed because of the influx of calcium from residual buffer used for harvesting. Extract can be locked in interphase by the addition of cycloheximide,37[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37] which prevents the synthesis of cyclins needed to enter the next cell cycle.\nSee preparation of egg extract[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.6] for a list of required materials.\nThe following morning, transfer the frogs to a new container filled with at least 4\u00a0L of conditioned water per frog.\nNote: Frogs may be housed together in a sufficiently large container. The frogs should complete ovulation for an additional 24\u00a0h at 16\u00b0C, and any additional eggs laid during this time should be discarded. The frogs should then be allowed to recover for 3\u20134\u00a0months, according to institutional protocols, before being reused for ovulation.\nCritical: The recovery period is essential to avoid harming the frogs' reproductive system.\nCarefully decant the eggs into a round glass dish, beaker, or other suitable container.\nExamine the eggs, and use a 2-mL transfer pipet to remove any that look malformed or damaged.\nNote: Healthy eggs look spherical, are enclosed in a transparent jelly coat, and have one hemisphere colored white (the vegetal pole) and the other dark (the animal pole).\u00a0Eggs that look uniformly white and swollen (i.e., puffy) should be discarded, as should eggs that are joined together (stringy) or are otherwise deformed or discolored (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nDejelly the eggs:Decant most of the buffer from the glass dish, leaving some to cover the eggs.\nPour in a third of the dejellying solution, and gently swirl the dish for 1\u20132\u00a0min.\nNote: Adding the dejellying solution in portions gradually changes the buffer composition and thereby reduces stress on the eggs.\nNote: Inclusion of cysteine (a mild reductant) in the dejellying solution helps disrupt the disulfide bonds between mucin molecules that hold the jelly coats together.50[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib50]\nDecant most of the buffer, and repeat with the next third of dejellying solution.\nDecant most of the buffer, and add the last third of dellying solution.\nSwirl the dish for 10\u201315\u00a0min, or until the eggs have shed their jelly coats.\nNote: The transparent jelly coats are difficult to see, but appear as a slightly refractive layer encasing the eggs. A better method for judging dejellying efficiency is to tilt the dish so that the eggs pile up on one side (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Dejellied eggs pack tightly against each other without noticeable interstitial space.\nCritical: Dejellying should be complete within 10\u201315\u00a0min. If this step takes significantly longer (> 25\u201330\u00a0min), the prolonged exposure of the eggs to cysteine can compromise the quality of the extract. See problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for more information.\nDecant most of the buffer.\nPour in 200\u00a0mL of XBS buffer and swirl for 2\u00a0min.\nNote: Adding XBS buffer in portions gradually changes the buffer composition and thereby reduces stress on the eggs.\nDecant most of the buffer, and repeat three more times with additional XBS buffer.\nPour in the last 200\u00a0mL of XBS buffer.\nPack the eggs:\nAdd 1\u00a0mL of XBS buffer to a 5-mL thin-walled ultracentrifuge tube (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, left image).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2479-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Fractionating eggs to produce a cytoplasmic extract(A) Transferring eggs to a thin-wall tube mounted in a test tube rack. A little buffer (\u223c1\u00a0mL) is first added to the tube, then eggs are dispensed from a transfer pipet. Note how the pipette is immersed in the buffer before expelling the eggs.\n(B) Scheme on top depicts the procedure for fractionating eggs. Step 1, eggs are transferred to a thin-wall tube as described above. Step 2, eggs are packed by low-speed centrifugation, then supplemented as shown. Step 3, packed eggs are crushed by high-speed centrifugation to produce a lipid layer on top, a straw-colored cytoplasmic fraction (i.e., the extract) in the middle, and a dark debris pellet on the bottom. Photographs show the actual appearance of the eggs after each step.\n(C) Tilt test to assess egg compaction. Properly packed eggs resist sliding when the tube is tilted. All scale bars represent 5\u00a0mm.\nCut off the tip of a 2-mL soft polypropylene transfer pipet.\nTilt the dish and collect the eggs along one side.\nCarefully scoop up some eggs using the prepared pipet and deposit in the tube.\nNote: To avoid disrupting the eggs by surface tension, immerse the transfer pipet in the buffer already in the bottom of the tube and dispense the eggs into the buffer (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, right image).\nRepeat until the tube is almost completely full with eggs (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, step 1).\nNote: Multiple tubes may be used to process more eggs. However, tubes should not be filled less than half-way to prevent collapse during centrifugation. If more tubes are necessary, the volume of eggs should be adjusted (by eye) to be similar in each tube.\nAspirate off most of the buffer covering the eggs.Centrifuge the tube at 16\u00b0C, first at 350\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 1\u00a0min, then at 1,200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for an additional minute (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, step 2).\nNote: Packing the eggs displaces most of the buffer that could otherwise dilute the final egg extract. Properly packed eggs should be tightly squeezed against each other but remain otherwise intact (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, step 2). They should also be fixed in place and not slide around when the tube is tilted (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Performing this step in two stages ensures optimal packing efficiency: the initial low-speed spin settles the eggs in the tube, while the second higher-speed spin compresses the eggs to fill most of the interstitial space. We start the centrifuge at 350\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g set for 2\u00a0min; after the first minute, we quickly increase the speed to 1,200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g and let the run complete in the remaining time.\nCrush the eggs:\nAspirate off as much residual buffer as possible, taking care not to disrupt the packed eggs.\nEstimate the volume of packed eggs, and add an appropriate volume of the 1000\u00d7 stock solution of protease inhibitors, cytochalasin, and cycloheximide.\nNote: The stock can be directly pipetted onto the top of the packed eggs (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, step 2).\nNote: Cytochalasin prevents actin polymerization and thereby decreases the viscosity of the extract to facilitate pipetting. Cycloheximide locks the extract in interphase, and is crucial for the import reactions to work because peroxisomal matrix protein import is inhibited during mitosis.48[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib48]\nCentrifuge the tubes in an SW 55 Ti swinging-bucket rotor for 15\u00a0min at 12,100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g and 16\u00b0C, then place the tubes on ice (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, step 3).Note: The crush spin will separate the eggs' contents into three fractions: a yellow lipid-rich layer on top; a straw-colored cytoplasmic layer (the egg extract) in the middle; and a dark pellet on the bottom consisting of pigment granules, nuclei, and other dense debris (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, step 3).\nNote: If an SW 55 Ti swinging-bucket rotor is not available, the older SW 50.1 Ti rotor will also work.\nIsolate the cytoplasmic fraction (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2479-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Removal of the cytoplasmic extract after fractionating eggs\n(A) Scheme depicting the procedure for isolating the cytoplasmic fraction (i.e., the extract) after fractionating eggs. Step 1, the tube is propped against the edge of the bench as shown, then pierced by a large-gauge needle just above the dark pellet on the bottom. Step 2, the cytoplasmic fraction is aspirated out while sweeping the needle from side to side.\n(B) Photographs illustrating a pierced tube before (left) and after (right) aspirating out the cytoplasmic fraction.\n(C) The resulting egg extract in a microfuge tube. All scale bars represent 5\u00a0mm.\nWipe one side of the tube with a kimwipe soaked in 100% ethanol to remove oils and other contaminants present on the outside.\nPierce the cleaned side of the tube with an 18-gauge beveled needle connected to a 1-mL syringe, just above the dark pellet on the bottom of the tube (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, step 1).\nCritical: The needle should be oriented with the beveled side facing up (i.e., toward the cytoplasmic fraction) to avoid aspirating the pellet underneath. For easy reference, the orientation of the needle can be marked on the outside of the syringe.\nCritical: Needles narrower than 18-gauge should NOT be used to avoid shearing organelles.Note: The tube wall is more easily pierced if the tube is propped vertically against the side of the bench (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, step 1).\nAspirate out the cytoplasmic layer by gently sweeping the needle from side to side while slowly pulling back the plunger (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, step 2).\nCritical: Pulling the plunger too fast generates shear forces in the needle that can disrupt peroxisomes and other organelles. A rate that fills a 1-mL syringe in 40\u201360\u00a0s is sufficient.\nNote: The sweeping motion allows the cytoplasmic fraction to be uniformly removed, and reduces the risk of forming a flowstream that could disrupt the fat layer on top or the pellet on the bottom, which should remain intact (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nSlowly expel the contents of the syringe into a microfuge tube on ice.\nRepeat for any remaining tubes.\nNote: We use a clean needle and syringe for each tube to avoid shearing organelles by repeated sliding of the plunger.\nCritical: Discard used needles in an appropriate sharps-collection container.\nAdd an appropriate volume of the 1000\u00d7 stock solution of protease inhibitors, cytochalasin, and cycloheximide to each microfuge tube, and mix by inversion.\nCollect the extract on the bottom of the tube using a touchspin centrifuge, and keep on ice (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nNote: If the extract is significantly contaminated by debris from the pellet (i.e., the extract looks gray instead of straw-colored), it can be clarified by centrifugation. Spin the tube for 5\u00a0min at 10,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g and 4\u00b0C to sediment the debris, then transfer the supernatant to a new microfuge tube on ice using a wide-bore pipette tip.\nCritical: Egg extract should be used promptly because it will degrade over time. In general, extract kept on ice for longer than 5\u20136\u00a0h should be discarded.\nDepletion of endogenous PEX5Timing: 30\u00a0min\nEndogenous PEX5 is depleted from egg extract using agarose beads covalently conjugated to the GST-tagged PEX5-binding domain from the docking factor PEX14. The resulting PEX5-depleted extract can then be supplemented with recombinantly produced PEX5 to restore import activity. Beads conjugated to GST alone may be used as a negative control.\nSee depletion of PEX5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.7] for required materials.\nMix the prepared 1:1 suspension of protein-conjugated agarose beads by gently vortexing.\nUsing a wide-bore pipette tip, transfer 20\u00a0\u03bcL of the bead suspension (i.e., 10\u00a0\u03bcL of beads) to a 0.5-mL microfuge tube on ice.\nNote: This amount of beads is generally sufficient to deplete PEX5 from 100\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcL of extract. The exact amount of beads needed to deplete PEX5 from a given volume of egg extract will depend on the coupling efficiency, and should be empirically determined for each batch of beads.\nNote: When working with small volumes of beads, it is helpful to mark the desired volume on the outside of the tube as a reference.\nNote: Affi-Gel beads settle quickly by gravity. The suspension should be pipetted soon after mixing.\nWash the beads.\nAdd 500\u00a0\u03bcL of cold XBH buffer to the tube.\nClose the tube and invert a few times to mix.\nCollect the beads by centrifugation for 1\u00a0min at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g and 4\u00b0C.\nAspirate off the supernatant.\nRepeat two more times.\nNote: This step removes residual non-conjugated protein that might have detached from the beads during storage. A swinging-bucket rotor (e.g., Eppendorf model S-24-11-AT) facilitates bead collection on the bottom of the tube.\nAfter the last wash, briefly spin the tube on a touchspin centrifuge to collect residual buffer on the bottom of the tube.\nCompletely aspirate off the remaining supernatant.Note: This step is facilitated by using a flattened capillary pipette tip.\nImmediately add 200\u00a0\u03bcL of egg extract using a wide-bore pipette tip.\nCritical: A wide-bore pipette tip decreases the shear force applied to the egg extract during aspiration, and thereby reduces the risk of disrupting peroxisomes and other organelles.\nNote: Egg extract is very viscous. To avoid air bubbles and ensure greater accuracy, extract should be transferred by reverse pipetting.51[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib51] This technique involves pressing the pipette plunger past the first stop and then aspirating up a larger volume of extract then intended. The actual volume is expelled by pressing on the plunger down to the first stop and no further, so that air is not blown out of the pipette tip. Excess extract that might coat the outside of the pipette tip may be wiped off using a Kimwipe. Avoid touching the Kimwipe to the orifice of the pipette tip.\nMix the beads into the extract by gently swirling with a fine pipette tip.\nInvert the tube a few times by hand, then rotate for 30\u00a0min at RT.\nCollect the extract on the bottom of the tube by briefly spinning on a touchspin centrifuge.\nUsing a wide-bore pipette tip, transfer the mixture of extract and beads into a Micro-Spin column.\nPartially cap the Micro-Spin column and briefly spin on a touchspin centrifuge.\nNote: The Micro-Spin column allows the egg extract to flow through but retains the beads in the sample reservoir on top. Ensure that all of the extract has flowed through before proceeding.\nCritical: The Micro-Spin column must be loosely capped to avoid creating a vacuum during centrifugation that might prevent all of the extract from flowing through.\nTransfer the PEX5-depleted egg extract to a microfuge tube using a wide-bore pipette tip, and keep on ice.Note: The extent of PEX5 depletion may be assessed later by immunoblotting. Boil a small aliquot (e.g., 2\u00a0\u03bcL) of the PEX5-depleted extract in a 10-fold excess of Laemmli buffer,52[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib52] according to conventional protocols. As a control, boil an equivalent aliquot of unmanipulated extract. Prepare a few serial two-fold dilutions of each sample, resolve them by reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and immunoblot for PEX5 as described previously.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],36[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36] Depletion efficiency may then be estimated from the resulting blot by densitometry.53[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib53]\nNote: It is faster and more meaningful to assess depletion efficiency by performing a matrix protein import assay with the PEX5-depleted extract, as described in the next section. Successful PEX5 depletion should preclude import, as discussed in the expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]. Once a batch of beads is standardized, this control can be included in every assay to confirm that depletion is still effective. Consult Problem 5 in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for tips on improving depletion efficiency.\nSetting up an import reaction\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nPEX5-depleted egg extract is supplemented with purified recombinant PEX5, and import is initiated by adding the fluorescent cargo GFP-SKL (reaction #1). We recommend to include two additional control reactions. First, a negative control reaction (reaction #2) using just PEX5-depleted egg extract (without recombinant PEX5) to verify the efficiency of PEX5 depletion. Second, a positive control reaction (reaction #3) using unmanipulated or mock-depleted egg extract to confirm that the peroxisomal import pathway is functional in this particular batch.\nReactions are prepared in two stages. First, all reagents EXCEPT the cargo are mixed in a tube and the reactions briefly warmed up. Then, import is initiated by adding cargo to the pre-warmed reactions.\nSee Setting up an import reaction[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.8] for required materials.\nPrepare three 0.2-mL tubes (i.e., PCR tubes) on ice.To each tube, add the reagents specified in the following table EXCEPT GFP-SKL:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2479_10.csv\nNote: The reagents should be combined in the order specified in the table, starting with egg extract. The fluorescent cargo (GFP-SKL) will be added later, after warming up the extract.\nNote: Dilute the purified PEX5 and GFP-SKL to the indicated 20\u00d7 stock concentrations using cold XBHS buffer and keep on ice.\nNote: PEX5 may be used at higher concentrations (\u2264 1\u00a0\u03bcM) to accelerate import,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] but the recommended concentration is sufficient and close to the concentration of endogenous PEX5 (\u223c50\u00a0nM).54[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib54] Higher concentrations of GFP-SKL are not recommended because they will increase the background and reduce the visibility of GFP-SKL imported into peroxisomes.\nNote: Egg extract is very viscous. To avoid air bubbles and ensure greater accuracy, extract should be transferred by reverse pipetting, as described above.\nCritical: To avoid shearing forces that could disrupt organelles, transfer the egg extract using a wide-bore pipette tip. Commercial wide-bore tips are usually too wide for the small volumes of extract required. We recommend cutting off a 2-mm portion of a generic tip using a clean razor blade.\nGently flick the tubes to mix, then collect the contents on the bottom of the tubes by briefly spinning on a touchspin centrifuge.\nPre-warm the tubes for 5\u00a0min at 24\u00b0C on a pre-heated 96-well thermoblock in a thermomixer, or in a block heater capable of accommodating PCR tubes.\nRemove the tubes from the thermoblock and add the fluorescent cargo to initiate import.\nGently flick the tubes to mix, and then collect the contents by a brief touchspin.\nReturn the tubes to the thermoblock and incubate for 1\u00a0h at 24\u00b0C.Note: The amount of cargo imported into peroxisomes increases linearly over time.36[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36] A 1-h incubation is sufficient to visualize import and detect differences between samples. Incubations longer than several hours are not recommended because of the risk of triggering apoptosis.55[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib55]\nOptional: Reactions may be performed at 16\u00b0C\u201318\u00baC, which is closer to the frogs' physiological body temperature. However, egg extract becomes more viscous at lower temperatures and may be difficult to pipet. We have seen no difference in import competence between the two temperatures within the timeframe of the assay, except that import is slightly faster at 24\u00b0C.\nPreparing egg extract for imaging\nTiming: 10\u00a0min\nEach import reaction is sandwiched between two passivated coverslips and mounted on a slide using Valap sealant. While import will continue to occur during this stage of the protocol, the amount of imported cargo increases linearly with time for several hours.36[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36] As long as this stage of the protocol is performed expeditiously and all samples are treated similarly, we have not noticed any effect on the results. If desired, import may be stopped by spiking each reaction with the purified PEX5-binding domain from PEX14 to a final concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM (which will sequester PEX5 in the cytosol and preclude further rounds of import).36[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]\nSee imaging the import reactions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.9] for a list of required materials.\nPrepare coverslips:\nFill a clean container (e.g., a lid from a pipette-tip box) with 100% ethanol.\nPlace the container on a block heater or a hot plate warmed to 100\u00b0C.\nPlace 3 passivated coverslip sandwiches (one sandwich for each import reaction) into the hot ethanol bath and incubate for 5\u201310\u00a0min to soften.\nNote: Freshly prepared sandwiches soften within a few minutes. Sandwiches that have been stored for a week or more may require a longer incubation.Using fine-tipped tweezers, remove a coverslip sandwich from the ethanol bath.\nGently pry apart the coverslips using a clean razor blade.\nPlace the separated coverslips on a coverslip rack, ensuring that the passivated (PEGylated) surfaces are oriented in the same direction.\nRepeat for the remaining sandwiches.\nRinse the coverslips well with 100% ethanol to remove residual PEG (immobilize the coverslips by pressing along one edge with the index finger as shown in Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nRinse the coverslips extensively with ultrapure water.\nBlow off excess water with compressed air or a handheld rubber bellows.\nPlace the rack on a hot plate warmed to 100\u00b0C until the coverslips are dry.\nTransfer the rack to a closed container to protect from dust, and allow the coverslips to cool to RT.\nNote: Coverslips may be prepared in advance, e.g., while the import reactions are incubating.\nPrepare slides:\nWipe 3 aluminum or glass slides with 100% ethanol to remove residual oils.\nBlow off any dust.\nNote: We use aluminum slides because they are more robust and can be reused. See Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for manufacturing instructions, and step 39 for instructions on reusing aluminum slides.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2479-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05. Dimensions of aluminum slides used for imaging import reactions\nWe manufacture these in-house by abrasive waterjet cutting. The round hole reduces reflection of excitation light during episcopic fluorescence imaging, and allows the sample to be viewed diascopically by transmitted light.\nNote: Slides may be prepared in advance, e.g., while the import reactions are incubating.\nAssemble the imaging chambers (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2479-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. Preparation of import reactions for imaging(1) A PEGylated coverslip is placed PEG side up on a slide as shown. (2) The import reaction is spotted onto the coverslip. (3) A second PEGylated coverslip is placed PEG side down over the import reaction to form a sandwich. (4) Two corners of the sandwich are spot-welded with Valap sealant using a cotton swab. (5) The sandwich is sealed by smearing Valap around all four edges.\nUsing fine-tipped tweezers, gently place a clean and dry passivated coverslip in the center of a slide (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 1).\nCritical: The passivated (PEGylated) side should face up.\nMix the import reaction by gently flicking the tube.\nNote: Egg extract sets over time. Flicking the tube resuspends the extract to facilitate pipetting.\nBriefly spin down the tube on a touchspin centrifuge.\nPipette 10\u00a0\u03bcL of the import reaction onto the center of the coverslip (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 2).\nNote: To avoid air bubbles, the import reaction should be spotted onto the coverslip by reverse pipetting, as described above. A wide-bore pipette tip is recommended.\nPlace a second coverslip on top to form a sandwich (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 3).\nCritical: The passivated side of this second coverslip should face down toward the sample.\nNote: To minimize air bubbles, it is helpful to lower the second coverslip on top of the first at an angle by starting from one side of the sandwich, instead of straight down.\nCritical: Place the second coverslip down promptly. Waiting too long after spotting the import reaction may compromise the ability of the extract to spread evenly over the glass.\nUsing a cotton swab, dab a little Valap sealant onto two corners of the assembled coverslip sandwich to spot-weld it to the slide (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 4).Immerse the cotton swab in more Valap sealant, quickly shake off any excess, and smear along one side of the sandwich to form a seal (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 5).\nNote: The cotton swab spreads the sealant better if it is allowed to soak in the Valap for at least several hours or even several days. We routinely reuse the same cotton swab, which can be left in the same container as the sealant and then reheated along with it.\nRepeat for the remaining three sides (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], step 5).\nNote: Ensure that the sandwich is completely sealed. If any gaps are present, dab with a little additional Valap.\nLabel the slide with a marker and lay flat, with the coverslips facing up, in a slide tray to protect from light.\nRepeat for the remaining import reactions.\nImaging the import reactions\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nThe assembled slides are mounted on a fluorescence microscope, and the fluorescence of the reporter cargo (i.e., GFP-SKL) is imaged at multiple positions.\nMount the first prepared slide in a slide holder on the microscope stage, with the coverslip sandwich facing the objective (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2479-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07. Imaging the import reactions\n(A) The prepared imaging chamber is mounted on a fluorescence microscope, with the coverslip side facing the microscope objective as shown.\n(B) Multiple fields, arrayed around the center of the coverslip and spaced at least 500\u00a0\u03bcm apart to avoid overlapping illumination, are then imaged sequentially. Blue arrow indicates the recommended imaging direction.\nNote: On a research-grade fluorescence microscope, this usually means that the sandwich should face downward.\nCritical: Handle the slides gently and move the microscope stage slowly to avoid shaking the extract. Extract that has been shaken will flow within the imaging chamber and be difficult to image.Note: Because egg extract is a uniform suspension, out-of-focus light is a considerably greater problem than when imaging intact cells. To mitigate this issue, we highly recommend using a spinning disk confocal microscope instead of a widefield setup to reduce the illuminated volume.\nNote: Extract cannot be easily fixed, so peroxisomes and other organelles are constantly buffeted by Brownian motion. A spinning disk confocal microscope offers a sufficiently small illuminated volume to minimize out-of-focus light, while allowing fast acquisition rates to prevent blurring. A point-scanning confocal might be too slow, despite the advantage in blocking out-of-focus light.\nConfigure the excitation light and optical elements in the microscope to be compatible with mEGFP fluorescence.\nNote: The spectral properties of mEGFP43[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib43] (and other fluorescent proteins) can be found in FPbase[href=https://www.fpbase.org/].56[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib56] As a reference, the optical elements that we use can be found in Skowyra and Rapoport.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nBring into focus the coverslip facing the objective.\nNote: This step is facilitated by using an adaptive focusing system, e.g., the Nikon Perfect Focus System (PFS), the Olympus Z-drift compensation (ZDC) module, or the Leica Adaptive Focus Control (AFC). Otherwise, the coverslip must be focused manually. Manual focusing is facilitated by noting the increase in overall brightness as the objective nears the coverslip.\nNote: Peroxisomes in egg extract are diffraction-limited. We therefore use high-power 60\u00d7 or 100\u00d7 oil-immersion objectives, with a high numerical aperture (NA) of 1.4 or greater, to maximize spatial resolution and fluorescence detection. Ensure that the chosen objective is corrected for chromatic aberration and flat-field illumination (e.g., a plan apochromat objective). Again, a detailed description of the optical elements in our imaging platform can be found in Skowyra and Rapoport.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nAdjust the focus to \u223c5\u00a0\u03bcm above the coverslip (i.e., toward the middle of the sandwich).Note: If using an adaptive focusing system, adjust the offset value to reach the desired height above the coverslip. Otherwise, focus must be adjusted manually. Properly focused egg extract looks diffuse with round voids (Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8], panel 2), which correspond to different types of vesicular compartments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2479-Fig8.jpg\nFigure\u00a08. Expected outcomes of the peroxisomal import reactions\nImported GFP-SKL molecules show up as bright puncta (panels 1 and 3), whereas unimported GFP-SKL produces a dimmer diffuse signal in the background (panel 2). Dark voids are vesicular compartments that exclude cytosol. Scale bar represents 5\u00a0\u03bcm.\nConfigure the acquisition software to image multiple fields arrayed around the center of the coverslip (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nNote: We generally image a 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05 or a 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 array, with individual fields separated from each other by 500\u00a0\u03bcm. This spacing yields a sufficient number of images for analysis, yet minimizes phototoxicity and photobleaching that might arise from overlapping illumination.\nCritical: Reduce the stage speed to avoid shaking the extract during acquisition.\nAdjust the imaging parameters to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while avoiding saturation of the camera.\nNote: Pixel binning (e.g., 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02) may be required to maximize the SNR. Binning should not greatly compromise spatial resolution if high-power objectives are used.\nAcquire images and repeat for the remaining samples.\nAluminum slides (if using) can be cleaned and reused:\nBriefly heat a slide on top of a hot plate to melt the Valap sealant.\nScrape off the coverslip.\nWipe off the remaining sealant with a paper towel.\nResidual grease can be cleaned by wiping with ethanol.\nCritical: Discard used coverslips in an appropriate sharps-collection container.", "All fly stocks were maintained at 25 \u00b0C and 70% humidity with a 12 h dark/light cycle on standard fly food. All experiments were performed using 3rd instar larvae at 96 h (hours) after egg laying (AEL). In order to ensure that all larvae were about the same age, the egg laying was restricted to 4-6 h. Experimental crosses were raised on standard fly food at 25 \u00b0C with 70% humidity and a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Prepare your genetic crosses 2 days before staging with approx. 20-30 virgins and 10-15 males each (more if you are using weak genotypes). After 2 days, transfer flies to a fresh food vial for timed egg-laying for 4-6 h at 25 \u00b0C (Figure 1A). Transfer the adult flies to a fresh vial (for another round of staging on the same or next day). The original vial is maintained at 25 \u00b0C until 96 \u00b1 3 h AEL. All larvae should be in the third instar (L3) foraging stage and not yet leaving the food (Figure 1B).Note: Precise staging is important, as nociceptive responses of larvae are reduced after 120 h AEL, likely due to the transition to the wandering stage and preparation for pupariation. The density of larvae in the food will also affect staging: too few animals cannot efficiently process the food, while having too many larvae will result in competition for food, both of which is affecting developmental progression and will broaden the developmental stage of the larval population. In case mutant animals with delayed development are used staging has to be adjusted accordingly (staging either by animal size or molting counting mouth hook teeth). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210225945_4169.jpgFigure 1. Correct staging and larval density. A. A photograph showing appropriate embryo numbers for the used vial size (approx.100-150 embryos laid within 4-6 h). B. At 96 h AEL, larvae should have processed the food well and still be in the foraging stage.Tool preparationCut the omniflex monofilament fishing line (Shakespeare, 6 lb test, diameter 0.009 inch [0.23 mm]) to a length of 18 mm. 10 mm is attached to a toothpick such that 8 mm of the fiber protruded from the end of the toothpick (Figure 2A). Calibrate the force of the fiber by using it to depress a balance until the fishing line is seen to bend. Record the force (in grams) and convert to milli-Newtons (mN) by multiplying the measured grams by a factor of 9.81. Typically, this length of filament results in a force of 45-50 mN (Figures 2B-2D). Varying the filament length will change the mechanical force (the longer, the less the force), which might be desirable if different forces should be tested. The probability of nociceptive responses of larvae increases with the applied force from 30 to 120 mN (Kim et al., 2012; Almeida-Carvalho et al., 2017). Examine the filament under a stereoscope and make sure that no sharp edges remain, which might potentially injure the animal. Puncturing the body wall will result in altered behavioral responses.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210230110_1482.jpgFigure 2. Tool preparation and calibration. A. 8 mm filament attached to toothpick prepared according to instructions above. B-D. Calibrating the filament: the filament should exert a force of 45-50 mN (4.59-5.10 g). B. Repeated depression of the filament should result in comparable forces (here 46 \u00b1 5 mN). B\u2019. Replicable forces are achieved by correct pressure and bending of the filament at the right angle as shown (approx. 45-60\u00b0). C\u2019. Too little pressure and/or wrong angle of deflection result in lower forces. C\u2019. Too much pressure and/or wrong angle of deflection result in too high forces.Distribute 2 ml of dH2O on a 2% agar plate to create a thin water film, which enables the animals to crawl freely and perform their rolling behavior. Without water, the larvae are not fully mobile and do not display consistent behavioral responses.Prepare 10-20 staged larvae by washing in dH2O to remove any residual food and place them gently on the agar plate using a brush (Figures 3A-3D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210230154_5022.jpgFigure 3. Preparation of mechanonociception assay. A and B. The assay is prepared by gently placing 10-20 staged 3rd instar larvae on a 10 cm 2% agar plate using a brush. C. A thin water film of 2 ml (colored magenta for illustration) is necessary for consistent behavioral responses. D. Agar plate with test animals is placed under a stereoscope with a light source. E. Illustration of a 3rd instar larvae. Boxed region indicates the dorsolateral region of abdominal segments A3-A6, which should be targeted with the filament calibrated to the chosen force (30-120 mN). F-H. Examples of correct and incorrect placement of the filament on the larva are shown. F. Correct placement on dorsolateral A3 region. G. Wrong placement with animal moving away from filament resulting in a bad angle for the stimulus. H. Filament placement at an anterior segment which generally does not elicit rolling behavior.Deliver the mechanical stimulus by rapidly depressing the larva with the filament on the dorsal side (abdominal segments four, five, or six) for approximately 1 sec. The quick release allows the larvae to perform escape behavior. Reapply the stimulus to the same larva after a pause of 2-3 sec.Score the response immediately on a scoring sheet according to Hwang et al.(2007): no response, stop, stop and turn (non-nociceptive responses), or rolling (nociceptive response); in addition, we introduced bending to score for an incomplete nociceptive response (C-shaped simultaneous convulsive head and tail movements) that did not result in rolling (response classification: 1 = no response, 2 = stop, 3 = stop and turn, 4 = bending, 5 = rolling). A positive rolling response is scored if at least one 360\u00b0 rotation along the body axis occurred in response to the mechanical stimulus (Figures 4A-4D; Videos 1 and 2). Note: To develop and entrain precision in applying the correct force to the animal the experimenter should practice the correct motion on a balance. Hold the toothpick with the filament and depress the filament at a 45-60\u00b0 angle until it bends, which should result in a consistent force every time. Practicing with control animals will further ensure consistent results. 50-70% of the animals should respond with rolling escape behavior after the 2nd stimulus.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180210/20180210230247_7053.jpgFigure 4.

Briefly, pSKHEV2 plasmid was digested with StuI, NheI and Tth111I restriction enzymes, followed by gel extraction of ~3.5 kb band. This fragment was treated with DNA polymerase I klenow fragment to generate blunt end, followed by self-ligation. Resulting plasmid is named as pSK HRt. Plasmid is available on request. This plasmid has been described in our earlier publication (Nair et al., 2016).Linearize 10 \u00b5g pSK HRt plasmid using 50 U BglII ( R0144L  , NEB, buffer 3.1) in 50 \u00b5l reaction mix (5 \u00b5l 10x buffer, 20 \u00b5l DNA, 2.5 \u00b5l enzyme and 22.5 \u00b5l water).Purify the linearized DNA using PCR purification kit.

Maintain anesthesia during image acquisition with one-half dose subcutaneously boosting every 45 min for up to 3 h. Placed mouse in the supine position on a heated microscope stage to achieve a rectal temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Once adequate anesthesia is induced (tested by paw pinch), expose the trachea and separate from the surrounding connective tissue. Cut a small opening in the anterior trachea parallel to the cartilaginous rings, and insert PE-90 tubing trimmed at a 45 degree angle into the trachea toward the lungs. Secure the tubing and close the skin around the trachea with Vetbond glue and connect to the mechanical ventilator.Apply a tidal volume of 8 to 10 \u03bcl/g body weight (room air or higher fractions of oxygen) with respiratory rates of approximately 120 breaths per min. This is the approximate normal breathing rate of an average size adult mouse (25-30 g). Reassess depth of anesthesia with a paw pinch.

Simplified workflow for determining protein redox state in Arabidopsis thaliana Flash freezing of plant tissues, protein extraction, and thiol labelingPrepare the protein extraction/thiol labeling solution (see Recipes). Keep in the dark at room temperature.Place Arabidopsis plants under intended conditions (e.g., high light conditions) for intended periods (e.g., 10 min).Prepare the liquid nitrogen in a mortar just before the sampling.Excise plant tissues (e.g., leaves) and immediately immerse it in the liquid nitrogen in a mortar. This step should be done under intended conditions. We usually use two or three fully expanded leaves from plants grown under long-day (16-h day/8-h night) conditions for 4 weeks (50-100 mg of fresh weight).Grind plant tissues using a pestle. Transfer the powdered plant tissues to the microcentrifuge tube carefully.Add the protein extraction/thiol labeling solution. For our conditions described in Step A4, more than 300 \u03bcl of the solution (3-6 \u03bcl/mg leaf fresh weight) should be added. Then, keep in the dark at room temperature for 1 h to allow free thiol groups to be fully labeled with AMS. AMS is a maleimide reagent reactive with the free thiol, but not with the disulfide bond.Heat the protein sample (e.g., at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min).Centrifuge at 20,000 x g, room temperature for 10 min.Transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube for removing the debris.Determine the protein concentration using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions). An equal amount of the protein extraction/thiol labeling solution should be added to the albumin standards. In our conditions described in Steps A4-A6, the protein concentration is estimated to be 4-6 mg/ml in most cases.Note: Usually, the protein sample is stable at -30 \u00b0C for several months.SDS-PAGE and Western blottingPrepare the polyacrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE.We usually use the separating gel with a size of 85 x 60 x 1 mm.Note: The optimal concentration of acrylamide is variable depending on the protein of interest. The molecular mass is a critical determinant. For example, we use the 10% acrylamide gel for detecting ATP synthase CF1-\u03b3 subunit (ca. 35,000) or fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase; ca. 40,000), and the 15% acrylamide gel for detecting m-type Trx (ca. 12,000) (Figure 2). Set the polyacrylamide gel to the electrophoresis tank. Pour the electrophoresis buffer (see Recipes).Load the protein sample (equivalent to 10-40 \u03bcg of proteins) to each well. Run the electrophoresis.Note: The optimal amount for sample loading is variable depending on the protein of interest. The migration time for SDS-PAGE is important for better separation of proteins in the reduced and oxidized forms, which is also variable depending on the protein of interest. Prepare the PVDF membrane and absorbent papers for Western blotting. The PVDF membrane must be hydrophilically treated with the methanol (for several seconds) and then the transfer buffer (for several minutes; see Recipes) prior to the use.Set the polyacrylamide gel after SDS-PAGE, the PVDF membrane, and the absorbent papers to the blotting equipment. Run the blotting.After the blotting, wash the PVDF membrane with distilled water and then TTBS (see Recipes) for several minutes.Incubate the PVDF membrane with 2% (w/v) blocking agent dissolved in TTBS (e.g., overnight at 4 \u00b0C).Incubate the PVDF membrane with the primary antibody diluted with TTBS (e.g., at room temperature for 2 h).Wash the PVDF membrane with TTBS (e.g., 10 min x 3 times).Incubate the PVDF membrane with the secondary antibody diluted with TTBS (e.g., at room temperature for 1 h).Wash the PVDF membrane with TTBS (e.g., 10 min x 3 times).Incubate the PVDF membrane with the ECL Prime solution. Detect the luminescence.Note: The optimal conditions for the immunoreaction (Steps B6-B11) and the signal detection (Step B12) are largely variable depending on the protein of interest. The dilution ratio of antibodies should be carefully tested. If the signal is weak, it may be helpful to use the immunoreaction enhancer (e.g., Can Get Signal, Toyobo) or the high-sensitivity detection reagent (e.g., ECL Select, GE Healthcare).", "Rice Root Hair GrowthSterilize the glume removed-rice seeds with 70% EtOH for 2 min, and remove the disinfectant alcohol. Then, sterilize the seeds with 10% sodium hypochlorite for 30 min on a horizontal shaker. Rinse the seeds thoroughly 5 times with sterile distilled water.Place the seeds on sterile absorbent paper for drying.Sow the seeds onto 0.8% phytagel half-strength MS medium (pH = 5.8).Note: To avoid too much moisture attached to the root hairs, it is highly recommended to seal the medium plates with 3M Micropore surgical tape. Place the medium plate vertically in the growth chamber under a temperature regime of 30\u00b0C/22\u00b0C (day/night) with 50% or lower humidity and a 12 h photoperiod (15,000 lux).Note: Lowering the humidity is an effective way to reduce the moisture in the plate.

Washing should be done by keeping the plate on rocking shaker with speed of 1,000\u20131,500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g.\nDuring second washing step, scrape the macrophages in presence of 1\u00a0mL 1\u00d7 sterile PBS and pull together from three wells (2\u20133\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/well) in 15\u00a0mL falcon tube. Centrifuge the cells at 5,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C under fixed angle rotor.\nAfter removal of spent PBS, add around 750\u00a0\u03bcL of FA lysis buffer to \u223c10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 macrophages per sample and incubate for 10\u00a0min on ice, followed by sonication.Note: We have preferably used ready-made DMEM high glucose media with phenol red to track proper cross-linking. Presence of phenol-red helps in tracking cross-linking step by paraformaldehyde when it induces pH-dependent color change of media (from red to yellow). This color change takes place immediately after addition of paraformaldehyde. However, the protocol has been successfully tested upon cells cultured in the phenol red negative DMEM as well as RPMI media.\nWe have standardized and achieved controlled chromatin cross-linking for long SE element by modification of a previously published cross-linking kinetics (CLK) methodology to extract chromatin binding kinetics of protein in a time dependent manner.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] They reported that for 1% formaldehyde quenching 250\u00a0mM glycine was optimum.\nInstead of time-kinetics, we performed paraformaldehyde-glycine concentration dependent kinetics. Here we used 0.5,0.75,1,1.5% of paraformaldehyde subsequently to cross-link the cell chromatin for 10\u00a0min at RT. Then quenched them with 125\u00a0mM glycine. It was found that at 1.5% paraformaldehyde concentration, macrophages got completely damaged and no pellet was rescued after PBS washing. Therefore, we used concentration below 1%, that is 0.75% paraformaldehyde-125\u00a0mM glycine for controlled cross-linking.\nSonication and protein estimation\nTiming: 20\u201345\u00a0min\nSonication and protein estimation of lysate isolated from cross-linked macrophages\n\u2217Sonication.\nSonicate the cell lysates using 10 cycles of 50% amplitude 350\u00a0Hz) pulse for 15\u00a0s and 45\u00a0s intervals in ultrasound sonication instrument (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nDuring sonication keep the samples constantly on ice (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nBesides samples, sonicate around 1,500\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL Salmon Sperm DNA (stock-10\u00a0mg/mL) in presence of 200\u00a0\u03bcL RIPA buffer which will be further used for coating beads. Sonicated salmon sperm DNA can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for 2\u20134\u00a0months.After sonication, centrifuge the lysate at 8,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 30\u00a0s at 4\u00b0C fixed angle rotor to remove residual cell debris.

Subsequently stain the gel in Ethidium bromide and visualize using UV-transillumination of GelDoc-XR \u00ae system (Biorad).\nRun 1 kb DNA ladder alongside the samples in the same gel to understand the size of the fragmented chromatin DNA.\nNote: The carcinogenic effect of Ethidium bromide can be avoided by alternative DNA staining chemicals such as SYBR\u2122 Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen) or Gel Red\u2122 solution (Biotium).\nDue to large length of the SE elements compared to normal enhancers, standardization of the ultrasonic sound-based sonication step on cool platform is done as follows in order to achieve sheering of the chromatin into 500\u20131,000 kb size (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2334-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03.

Stage the embryo according to the anatomical features described in the Hamburger and Hamilton staging guidelines12 and confirm the embryo is at HH34.\nCut the neck and then bisect the head of the embryo at the midline using a sterilized razor blade. Using sterile forceps, remove the brain. Leave the beak intact.\n4. Culture Setup\nPlace 2 of the 35 mm Petri dishes inside one 100 mm Petri dish.\nPlace a steel wire mesh inside each 35 mm Petri dish.\nUsing forceps, transfer 1 of the bisected heads to a piece of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm semi-porous filter paper with the eye facing up. Ensure the tissue is secure and does not slip off by tilting it slightly.\nUsing forceps, carefully place the eye tissue and the filter paper on top of the steel wire mesh in 1 of the 35 mm Petri dishes, creating a raised stage with the eye tissue on top.\nRepeat steps 4.3 and 4.4 with the other half head.\nUsing a sterile glass pipette, carefully add nutrient medium directly into each 35 mm Petri dish until it reaches the level of the filter paper. Do not submerge the half head in the nutrient medium.\nAdd 50 \u00b5L of 10,000 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin to the nutrient medium in each Petri dish.\nFold a piece of tissue paper into a small square and place it inside the 100 mm Petri dish. Moisten it with autoclaved distilled water.Place the culture dish into the sterile, dark incubator at 37 \u00b0C \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and ~40% humidity for up to 4 days.\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 for each embryo.\n\tNOTE: The number of embryos needed will depend on the specific experiment; here, we describe the protocol for 12 embryos.\n5. Culture Maintenance\nOnce per day, top up the plastic containers in the incubator with fresh, autoclaved distilled water.\nDaily check all cultures for bacterial or fungal infections. Cultures that have disintegrated or in which the medium has changed color are infected. Discard all cultures that are infected.\n6. Fixation\nFollowing culturing, remove all dishes from the incubator.\nUsing a pair of forceps, gently remove the eye from the filter paper, taking care not to tear the tissue.\nFix the eye tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 \u00b0C or in 10% neutral-buffered formalin overnight at room temperature.\nStore the tissue at 4 \u00b0C in 1x phosphate-buffered saline.\nSubscription Required.

Despite numerous attempts, it has been difficult to manipulate the time of spawning in Woods Hole collected adults. Here we describe a protocol to be able to spawn adult _Mnemiopsis leidyi_ at the Whitney Lab for Marine Bioscience and in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\n1. Adult _M. leidyi_ were collected with beakers by \u2018dipping\u2019 them out of the water from floating docks in the Intercostal Waterway around the town of Marineland, Florida and Eel Pond in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Care must be taken to avoid touching specimens with nets or bare hands because damage their outer epidermis.\n  \n2. Using a glass or plastic beaker, transfer adults into a 5-gallon plastic bucket filled with natural 1\u00b5m UV-filtered fresh seawater \\(1x UV-FSW), or equivalent \\(Figure 1).\n  \n3. Keep the bucket inside the lab at room temperature under constant light for at least two consecutive nights before spawning. It is recommendable to use a 20-Watt LED Floodlight, or similar, placed at the top of the bucket \\(Figure 1A-C). Exposure to constant light is required in order to neutralize the endogenous circadian periodicity of spawning of wild-caught animals.\n  \nNote: Under these conditions, animals will stay healthy for up to a week, although their oral lobes will begin regressing without wild plankton feeding. Feeding animals with recently hatched Artemia \\(Figure 1D and 1d\u2019) the day before spawning improves gamete production. Feeding animals constantly with mysid shrimps \\(or equivalent local copepods) improves animal health and gamete production. Move the animals to a clean bucket of FSW when water becomes turbid.4. When spawning is desired, take 1-2 adult _M. leidyi_ from the bucket and place them into a new container \\(e.g. 6\u201d diameter glass bowls; Figure 1E) with fresh 1\u00b5m UV-FSW. Having clean water is essential in order to keep spawned embryos free of debris. _M. leidyi_ are self-fertile adults and viable embryos can be obtained from the spawning of a single individual<sup>12,28,31</sup>.\n  \nNote: Be careful not to touch the animals directly. Rather use glass or plastic beakers to perform the transfer.\n5. Place the bowls containing 1-2 animals into complete darkness \\(e.g. in an incubator, drawer, or under a cardboard box) and wait for the spawning. After 1-2 hours quickly check the bowls for early spawning. If gametes are detected, transfer the animals to a clean bowl with fresh 1x FSW. This will help ensure that subsequently spawned eggs will develop synchronously.\n  \n6. After 3 hours in darkness, animals will start to release sperm and then, between 10 to 20 minutes later, they will release the eggs. Eggs are fertilized as soon as they are released<sup>12,28,31</sup>.\n  \nNote: Keep animals in dark during spawning. Waiting times vary according to different seasons and locations. Florida, USA: 3 hours \\(summer; 28\u00baC) and 4 hours \\(winter; 22\u00baC). Woods Hole: 6-8 hours \\(summer; 18-22\u00baC).\n7. After spawning is complete, collect the fertilized eggs with a pipette and transfer to a dish of freshly filtered seawater to avoid contamination with adult mucus. Transfer the adults back to a bucket of fresh sea water.\n  \n**Fixation and Immunohistochemistry**\nExamples of immunostained embryos at different stages can be found in Figure 2. \n_Ctenophore embryos at stages prior to hatching:_Ctenophore embryos like _M. leidyi_ are surrounded by an acellular chorion. A jelly coat surrounds the chorion at spawning causing them to have neutral buoyancy. After 5-10 minutes, the external jelly coat dissolves and the fertilized eggs will sink to the bottom of the dish. There is also a jelly-like substance located in the vitelline space, \\(between the chorion and the egg surface). This substance changes its properties after fixation. Dechorionated ctenophore embryos will stick to polystyrene plastic. Dechorionated ctenophores embryos can be raised on gelatin-coated dishes<sup>28</sup>.\n1. Let the embryos develop until the desired stage. Using a mouth or micropipette, transfer as many embryos you want to fix with a minimal volume of water as possible into a 35 mm plastic petri dish and add 2-3 ml of ice-cold fixative. \n  \n2. Incubate embryos in the fixative for 1.5 to 2 hours on a rocking platform at room temperature with the lid on.\n  \n3. Transfer fixed embryos to a new petri dish and rinse them twice \\(5 minutes each) with 1x FSW on a rocking platform at room temperature.\n  \n4. Replace 1x FSW with PBT.\n  \nNote: Fixed embryos can be stored PBT for up to 3-5 days at 4\u00baC.\n5. Dechorionate fixed embryos using sharp Dumont #5 forceps. Antibodies will not penetrate the chorion. \n  \nNote: Fixed gastrula stages have many cell-cell connections that make them structurally more robust than cleavage stages. Gastrula \\(and later) stages can be dechorionated by gently pipetting fixed embryos up and down through a P-200 micropipette tip. Slightly addition of Triton X-100 \\(up to 0.5%) may facilitate the dechorionation process but it can decrease cell and tissue preservation.6. Rinse the fixed embryos at least five times in PBT for at least 3 hours on a rocking platform at room temperature. It is recommendable to do one first quick wash of 5 minutes, the second one of 25 minutes, and three washes of 50 minutes each.\n  \n7. Replace PBT with 5% NGS for 1-2 hours at room temperature with gentle rocking to reduce background antibody binding. Fixed embryos can be stored overnight in 5% NGS at 4\u00baC.\n  \nNote: In the meantime, dilute your primary antibodies to the desired concentration in ice-cold 5% NGS.\n8. Remove blocking solution \\(5% NGS). Replace it with your primary antibody solution, and incubate overnight on a rocker at 4\u00b0C.\n  \nNote: \\(Optional) Recover your antibody solution into a new tube and store it at 4\u00baC for future use.\n9. Rinse the fixed embryos at least five times in PBT for a total period of 3 hours on a rocking platform at room temperature. It is recommendable to do one first quick wash of 5 minutes, the second one of 25 minutes, and three washes of 50 minutes each.\n  \n10. Remove PBT, replace it with appropriate secondary antibody solution \\(e.g. 1:250 in 5% NGS), and incubate overnight on a rocker at 4\u00b0C.\n  \nNote: Alternatively, you could try incubating your samples in secondary antibody for 1-3 hours on a rocking platform at room temperature to shorten the protocol. \n11. Wash the secondary antibody out of the samples twice with PBT for at least an hour each on a rocking platform at room temperature.\n  \n12. \\(Optional) To visualize F-actin, incubate samples for 1.5 hours with Phalloidin \\(Invitrogen, Inc. Cat. # A12379) diluted 1:200 in PBT on a rocking platform at room temperature.Note: Phalloidin dissolves in alcohol-based solutions \\(e.g. ethanol, methanol, glycerol). Hence, Phalloidin may wash away and its use is not recommended when using alcohol-based mounting media \\(see mounting section).\n13. \\(Optional) To visualize nuclei, wash the samples once with PBT and incubate samples with DAPI \\(0.1\u00b5g/\u00b5l in PBT; Invitrogen, Inc. Cat. # D1306) for 1 hour on a rocking platform at room temperature.\n  Note: Depending on the mounting media \\(e.g. Murray\u2019s mounting media) DAPI may wash away and its use is not recommended. For an alternative, see mounting section below.\n14. Rinse Samples in PBT and store at 4\u00baC.\n  \n_Handling hatches stages, i.e. without chorion \\(cydippids, and adult tissues)._\nThe fixation of larvae and adult ctenophore tissues has been a long-standing challenge for molecular and cellular biology studies. The massive amount of mesoglea with different osmotic properties maintains the homeostasis and structural integrity of the thin outer cellular tissue in sea water. However, osmotic changes generated by fixative solutions disrupt this homeostasis, the mesoglea collapses, and the animals disintegrate into the solution inducing cellular degradation. To overcome this technical problem, we developed a simple method to preserve not only the cellular structure but also the animal integrity after fixation.\n1. Embed the live specimens in a pre-warmed \\(over 30\u00baC) low melt agar \\(1.2% in 1x FSW; Figure 3). \n  \na. To do this, carefully pipette the specimens into a petri dish or microscope slide with a minimum volume of water \\(Figure 3A).\nb. \\(Optional) To relax the animals and allow the extension of their tentacles you can add Sodium Azide to 1x FSW containing the animals using a final concentration from 10mM \\(0.065%) to 25mM \\(0.1625%). This treatment can also be used for _in vivo_ imaging.c.  Carefully add the liquid agar \\(approximately 10:1 agar:1x FSW/animals volume) to the specimens and mix well and gently until the sea water is fully dissolved and the specimens are fully embedded into the agar.\nNote: hot agar will destroy the specimens and any trace of undissolved FSW will interfere with the agar solidification. A good way to avoid this is to pipette some agar to the side of the water containing the specimens \\(Figure 3B), then, pipette up the agar with the specimens, and mix the solutions by gently pipetting up and down two to three times \\(Figure 3C).\nd. \\(Optional) Put a coverslip with clay corners over the samples and press down until desired thickness \\(Figure 3D). This step will facilitate further mounting for microscope visualization.\ne. Quickly cool the slide down on ice until the agar is solidified and the animals stop moving the ctenes \\(if they are present).\n2. Pour 1-3 ml of ice-cold fixative over the agar containing the specimens. A 35 mm plastic petri dish is recommended.\n  \n3. Incubate in the fixative for 1.5 to 2 hours on a rocking platform at room temperature. \n  Note: if you put a coverslip, during the fixation carefully move or remove the coverslip to allow better penetration \\(Figure 3E).\n4. Discard the fixative and rinse twice \\(5 minutes each) with 1x FSW on a rocking platform at room temperature.\n  \n5. Replace 1x FSW with PBT.\n  Note: Fixed specimens can be stored PBT for up to 3-5 days at 4\u00baC.\n6. Cut agar in cubes using a clean scalpel or razor blade \\(Figure 3F) in a way that each cube contains an intact sample embedded inside \\(Figure 3G). \n  \n7. Transfer the cubes of agar to a new 2 mL tube.\n  \nContinue with steps 6-15 from the previous section.\n**Mounting**1. Transfer individual stained samples in PBT into a microscope slide \\(Figure 4A).\n  2. Put a coverslip with clay \u201cfeet\u201d on the corners over the samples and press down on the corners until desired thickness \\(Figure 4B).\n  3. Add the mounting media to one side of the coverslip.\n  4. At the other side of the coverslip put an absorptive tissue \\(e.g. Kimwipe) to create a directional flow that will replace the PBT and embed the stained samples with the desired mounting media \\(Figure 4C).  \n  \n**Mounting media**\n_Using 97% TDE \\(2,2\u2019-thiodiethanol; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc)._ \nThis method does not need dehydration.\nNote: TDE is an alcohol-based solution, and therefore, it is not suitable for Phalloidin staining.\n1. Replace PBT with TDE.\n  \n_Using Murray\u2019s mounting media_ \nNote: Most of the cases, MMM is not suitable for DAPI staining because washes it away. \nUsing our fixation method, we have been able to preserve part of the DAPI staining by adding an additional PBS wash before isopropanol dehydration.\n1. Replace PBT with PBS. \n  \n2. Dehydrate samples with isopropanol using the gradient 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100%.\n  \n3. Replace isopropanol with MMM.\n  \nFootnotes: A similar protocol can be used for _in situ_ hybridization \\(modified from Pang & Martindale 2008: Cold Spring Harb. Protoc.; 2008; doi:10.1101/pdb.emo106). In this case, embryos should be embedded in LE Quick Dissolve Agarose \\(GeneMate; melts at 65\u00baC) to overcome hybridization temperatures. However, high background may be produced by the probe retained in the agar.", "1. Setting up the genetic cross and preparing the egg collection cup\nSelect female flies (virgin) from the optogenetic line UASp-CIBNpm (I); UASp-CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry (III) on a CO2 pad under a stereomicroscope and set up a cross with male flies from the maternal GAL4 driver line 67 Sqh-mCherry; 15 E-cadherin-GFP.\n\tNOTE: The 67 and 15 stand for maternal-Tubulin-GAL4 inserted into the second (II) and third (III) chromosomes, respectively52. The GAL4 line used in this protocol also expresses the mCherry-tagged myosin regulatory light chain Sqh (Spaghetti squash)37 and GFP-tagged E-cadherin53. Flies from the optogenetic line may still contain FM7 and TM6 balancer chromosomes. Flies from the maternal GAL4 driver line may still contain the CyO and TM3 balancer chromosomes.\nAfter ~10 days, select F1 female flies having the following genotype: UASp-CIBNpm/+; 67 Sqh-mCherry/+; 15 E-cadherin-GFP/UASp-CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry. Set up an egg collection cup with the male flies.\n\t\nEnsure that the female flies with the correct genotype do not contain any balancer chromosomes (i.e., they should not contain curly wings [Cy], short bristles [Sb], bar- or kidney-shaped eyes [B], or extra humeral bristles [Hu]), which are markers for the CyO, TM3, FM7, and TM6 balancers used in generating the stocks, respectively. Cover the cup with an apple juice plate with a tinge of fresh yeast paste on the surface.\n\t\tNOTE: In F1 females, the optogenetic components are expressed maternally. Therefore, the F1 females used for setting up the cup do not need to be virgins. It is recommended to use male flies from the same F1 population for the cup for convenience.Keep the cup in a cardboard box covered with aluminum foil to avoid any possible light leakage from the environment. Change the apple juice plate every day for cups kept at room temperature (~21-23 \u00b0C), or every two days for cups kept at 18 \u00b0C.\n\t\nImmediately before plate change, knock the cup on a flat surface (e.g., bench top) to keep the flies at the bottom of the cup and prevent them from escaping. Change the apple juice plate in a dark room and use a headlamp with red light for illumination (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: To increase the expression of the constructs that are under the control of maternal-Tubulin-GAL4 and UASp, it is recommended to keep the cup at 18 \u00b0C for a minimum of 3 days before embryo collection. This incubation period also allows the flies to adapt to the cup and be well fed on the yeast paste to achieve optimal egg production.\n2. Collection of embryos at the desired stage and preparing them for optogenetic stimulation\nNOTE: All sample collection and preparation steps need to be performed in a dark room, using a \"safe light\" (e.g., red light) for illumination. The optogenetic components are immensely sensitive to ambient light. Even the slightest exposure to ambient light leads to premature stimulation of the specimen. Typically, lights in the green-red range (>532 nm) do not cause unwanted stimulation.\nFor collecting embryos at early embryogenesis, place a new apple juice plate on the cup 8 to 16 h prior to embryo collection (at 18 \u00b0C).At the time of embryo collection, change the apple juice plate. Label the plate taken off from the cup and cover the plate's surface with a thin layer of Halocarbon oil 27 (see Table of Materials). Wait for 30-60 s for the eggshell to become transparent.\nPlace an orange-red plastic shield (see Table of Materials) on the stage of an upright stereoscope. The placement of the orange-red shield prevents undesirable stimulation during sample illumination by blocking the blue-green wavelengths from the transmitted light.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, an upright stereoscope is used for embryo collection (see Table of Materials).\nPlace the apple juice plate on top of the orange-red shield. Turn on the transmitted light of the stereomicroscope to illuminate the sample. Collect 5-15 embryos at the appropriate stage from the apple juice plate using a pair of tweezers. Do not squeeze the embryos with the tweezers.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, the appropriate embryo should be at the early-mid cellularization stage. The embryo at this stage should have a dark opaque yolk surrounded by a clear, uniform periplasm layer that contains the forming blastoderm cells. The leading edge of the cleavage furrows (\"cellularization front\"), which appears as a continuous line parallel to the surface of the embryo, should not pass half of the depth of the periplasm.\nGently blot the embryos on a piece of paper towel (~1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm) to remove excess oil from the embryos using the tweezers.Add several drops of freshly prepared 40% bleach (~3% sodium hypochlorite; see Table of Materials) to a new small square piece of paper towel (~1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm) using a plastic transfer pipette so that the paper towel is covered with a thin layer of bleach. Transfer the embryo from the dry paper towel to the bleach-soaked paper towel using the tweezers and make sure the embryos are soaked in bleach. Wait 2-4 min for the embryo to become dechorionated.\nAfter dechorionation, use the tweezers to blot the square paper towel on a large piece of tissue paper to remove excess bleach. Ensure that the side with the embryos is facing up.\nTo rinse the embryos, use the tweezers to gently soak the square paper towel in a drop of deionized water and quickly blot it on a large piece of tissue paper. Repeat this process eight times to ensure the removal of any residue bleach.\nUse an eyelash tool to transfer the embryo from the paper towel to a 35 mm glass-bottom dish (see Table of Materials). Add deionized water to the dish to cover the embryos entirely. Fine-tune the position and orientation of the embryos using the eyelash tool.\n\tNOTE: After dechorionation, the embryo tends to stick on the surface of the glass and is immobile without perturbation, so it is not necessary to apply additional treatment (such as glue) to immobilize the embryo on the glass-bottom dish.\nPlace the 35 mm glass-bottom dish with the embryos inside a lightproof black box (see Table of Materials) to protect the sample from light exposure during the transfer process. Bring the box to the room with the multiphoton microscope.\n3. Optogenetic stimulation, laser ablation, and imaging of the embryoNOTE: The multiphoton system used in this experiment (see Table of Materials) is capable of simultaneous dual-wavelength imaging. It also contains a photostimulation unit with a 458 nm laser and a separate galvanometer scanner, allowing photo-activation/stimulation within a defined region of interest (ROI). Of note, the 920 nm laser, which is used to excite green-yellow fluorescent proteins, will stimulate Opto-Rho1DN, albeit more slowly compared to blue laser-mediated stimulation.\nCover the multiphoton microscope with a lightproof black cloth (see Table of Materials) to avoid unwanted stimulation of the embryos during sample setup and imaging.\n\tNOTE: The same approach is used during regular multiphoton imaging to protect the light-sensitive detectors equipped on the microscope.\nTurn off the room light and the computer screens. Turn off the touch panel controller by clicking OFF under 'Backlight of touch panel controller' in the software. Ensure there is no other ambient light in the room.\n\t\nOpen the front side of the black cloth cover on the microscope. Take the 35 mm glass-bottom dish from the black box and place it on the microscope stage.\nIlluminate\u00a0embryos with a green light\u00a0normally used as the excitation light for epifluorescence. To do this, turn on the fluorescence illumination unit, select Ocular under the 'Ocular' panel in the software, and change the 'Cube turret' to 4:TRITC. Use the eyepiece to identify the embryo of interest and bring it into focus.NOTE: The green light visualization is achieved by allowing a white light generated by the fluorescence illumination unit to pass through a built-in standard TRITC filter cube, which contains a 528-553 nm excitation filter, a 565 nm beam splitter, and a 590-650 nm emission filter. Other non-blue lights should also work fine for sample illumination. It is not necessary to wear eye protection at this step, since the excitation light has a low intensity and will not be directed to the eyepiece. The embryo will appear uniformly red due to autofluorescence.\nClose the black cloth cover so that the sample is fully protected from light. Turn on the computer screen to access the software that controls the microscope. Change the 'Ocular' to LSM in the software for image acquisition.\nPerform laser ablation in control, unstimulated embryos using a 25x water immersion objective.\n\t\nClick Bright Z, Sequence Manager, and LSM Stimulation from the 'Tool Window' in the software. Set the scanner type as Galvano and the scan size as 512 \u00d7 512. Turn on CH1 and CH3 under the 'PMT setting' panel to allow the use of the 1,040 nm laser, and click Live \u00d7 4 to visualize the embryo.\nRotate the embryo using the Rotation function in the software so that the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo is vertically oriented. Set the zoom to 3. Draw a region of interest (ROI) using the shape tool under 'Scan Settings' and set the size of the ROI in the 'Reference' panel. Set the ROI as 512 pixels in width and 100 pixels in height (171 \u00d7 33 \u00b5m2).\nSet acquisition parameters for the pre-ablation Z-stack.Register the surface of the embryo as 0 under the 'Z Section'. Set the start as 0 and the end as 100 \u00b5m. Set the step size as 2 \u00b5m. Activate the Z acquisition mode by checking Z under the 'Series' tab.\nSet 1,040 nm laser intensity to increase linearly from 3% to 7% using the Bright Z function.\nSave the current imaging setting as the first task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The pre-ablation Z-stack is obtained to confirm the stage of the embryo. In this experiment, CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry and Sqh-mCherry will be excited by the 1,040 nm laser. During apical constriction, the Sqh-mCherry signal is enhanced at the medioapical region of the ventral mesodermal cells, whereas CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry is cytosolic before stimulation. The laser intensity employed for pre- and post-stimulation imaging is decided empirically based on the balance between the optimal signal-to-noise ratio and the avoidance of photobleaching.\nSet acquisition parameters for the pre-ablation movie.\n\t\t\nDelete any\u00a0existing ROI to allow imaging of the entire 512 \u00d7 512 pixel region (171 \u00d7 171 \u00b5m2, 3x zoom) near the ventral surface of the embryo, as described in step 3.5.2. Set the 1,040 nm laser intensity to 3%.\nCheck Time and uncheck Z under the 'Series' panel. Keep the 'Interval' as FreeRun under the 'Time Lapse' panel. Set cycle as 10.\nSave the current settings as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The purpose of this task is to obtain a 10-frame single Z-plane pre-ablation movie with a 1,040 nm laser for image acquisition. The image acquisition speed is approximately 1 s per frame.\nSet the parameters for laser ablation.Define a 3D region from immediately below the vitelline membrane to ~20 \u00b5m deep for laser ablation (Figure 1A). Set the start of the Z-stack as the plane that is immediately below the vitelline membrane and the end as 20 \u00b5m deeper than the start plane. Set the step size as 1.5 \u00b5m.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The ROI of the ablated region is ~30 pixels in width and ~10 pixela in height (~10 \u00b5m along the medial-lateral axis and ~3.3 \u00b5m along the A-P axis). The purpose of ablating the sample at multiple Z-planes is to ensure that the apical surface of the ventral cells is ablated. This is specifically important for the stimulated embryos, as the ventral cells experience rapid apical relaxation after Rho1 inhibition.\nTurn on CH2 and CH4 under the 'PMT setting' panel to allow the use of the 920 nm laser. Set the intensity of the 920 nm laser to 30%. Set image acquisition with the 920 nm laser for a single Z-stack within the 3D region\u00a0defined in step 3.5.5.1 for laser ablation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The laser intensity chosen in this step is sufficient to ablate the tissue (as indicated by tissue recoil immediately after the laser treatment) but meanwhile does not obviously damage the plasma membrane (as indicated by the lack of burn marks on the cell membrane) (Figure 1B,C).\nSave the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\nSet acquisition parameters for the post-ablation movie.\n\t\t\nSet image acquisition for a 100-frame single Z-plane post-ablation movie using both the 1,040 nm and 920 nm lasers. Set the intensity of the 1,040 nm laser and the 920 nm laser to 3% and 0.3%, respectively. The region specified in step 3.5.4 will be imaged with identical image acquisition speed.Save the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The purpose of storing the parameters described in steps 3.5.3-3.5.6 as sequential tasks in 'Sequence Manager' before any actual acquisition is to ensure the capture of the immediate tissue response after laser ablation.\nSelect Sequence under 'Acquire'. Change the data-saving path and file name as needed. Click Ready and wait for the software to initialize the pipeline. Then click Start to execute the pipeline.\nPerform laser ablation in stimulated embryos.\n\t\nSet acquisition parameters for the pre-ablation Z-stack, as described in steps 3.5.1-3.5.3. Save the current setting as the first task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\nSet parameters for optogenetic stimulation within a defined ROI.\n\t\t\nChange the zoom to 1 and select an ROI that covers the ventral surface of the embryo (~512 \u00d7 300 \u00b5m2). Turn off the CH1-CH4 detectors.\nClick LSM Stimulation. Uncheck Continuous within Duration and type\u00a012 s. Check the 458 nm with 0.3% laser intensity.\nSave the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking Stimulation in 'Sequence Manager'.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A more rapid stimulation may be achieved by increasing the 458 nm laser intensity. However, when using higher laser intensities, the scattered laser light may stimulate the region adjacent to the ROI, which is not ideal if a spatially confined stimulation is required.\nSet a 3 min wait time after stimulation to ensure total inactivation of myosin and disassembly of apical F-actin, and to achieve a static tissue morphology before laser ablation. This is achieved by clicking on Wait/Pause under 'Sequence Manager' and setting the desired time for 'Wait'.NOTE: Recruitment of CRY2-Rho1DN-mCherry to the membrane caused by a single round of stimulation (0.3% 458 nm laser for 12 s) is clearly detectable 10-15 min after the stimulation. This is in alignment with the published dissociation half-time of ~9 min47.\nSet acquisition parameters for the single Z-plane pre-ablation movie, as described in step 3.5.4, except that both the 1,040 nm and 920 nm lasers are used for image acquisition. Turn on the CH1-CH4 detectors. Set the intensity of the 1,040 nm laser and the 920 nm laser to 3% and 0.3%, respectively.Save the current setting as the next task of the pipeline by clicking LSM in 'Sequence Manager'.\nSet parameters for laser ablation, as described in step 3.5.5.

Quantifying the rate of tissue recoil after laser ablation\nOpen the post-ablation movie in ImageJ.\nDraw a small ROI along the ventral midline that covers the ablated region using the Rectangle Selection tool. The width of the ROI is nine pixels. The height of the ROI is set such that the ROI is large enough to cover the full range of tissue recoil after laser ablation.\n\t\nClick Duplicate under the 'Image' tab. In the pop-up window, check Duplicate stack and then click OK to duplicate the stack within the selected ROI.Generate a montage from the duplicated stack through Image > Stacks > Make Montage. In the pop-up window, set the row number to 1 and the column number to the total number of frames in the stack (100 in this case).\nMeasure the A-P width of the ablated region over time from the generated montage.\n\t\nUse the Multi-point tool in ImageJ to mark out the A-P boundaries of the ablated region for each time point on the montage.\nSave the coordinates of the marked dots using File > Save as > XY Coordinates.\nImport the measured XY coordinates into MATLAB. Calculate the A-P width of the ablated region for each time point by subtracting the Y coordinate of the upper boundary from the Y coordinate of the lower boundary.\nDetermine the rate of tissue recoil by fitting the first 20 s of the \"width over time\" curve into a line using the 'polyfit' function in MATLAB.

Preparation of decellularization buffers and reagents\nNOTE: All solutions used during the decellularization protocol should be sterilized by autoclaving and stored for up to 3 months unless stated otherwise.\nPrepare 10x phosphate-buffered saline (10x PBS) by adding sodium chloride (NaCl) at 137 mM, potassium chloride (KCl) at 2.68 mM, potassium-dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) at 8.1 mM, and disodium-hydrogen-phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4) at 1.47 mM to demineralized water (dH2O) and adjust the pH to 6.8. Add 100 mL of 10x PBS to 900 mL of demineralized H2O to generate 1x PBS. Autoclave and store at room temperature (RT). Add sterile penicillin/streptomycin stock solution (10,000 U/mL penicillin and 10 mg/mL streptomycin [pen/strep]) to a final concentration of 1% prior to use.\nPrepare the hypotonic buffer by dissolving 1.21 g of Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris base) and 1 g of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in 1 L of dH2O (10 mM Tris base 0.1% EDTA). Use a magnetic stirrer until dissolved and adjust the pH to 7.8 with NaOH/HCl. Sterilize by autoclaving and store at RT. Add pen/strep to a final concentration of 1% prior to use.\nPrepare the hypotonic wash buffer by dissolving 1.21 g of Tris base in 1 L of dH2O (10 mM Tris base). Use a magnetic stirrer until dissolved and adjust the pH to 7.8 with NaOH/HCl. Autoclave and store at RT. Add pen/strep to 1% prior to use.Prepare the anionic detergent treatment by adding 0.05 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to 100 mL of hypotonic wash buffer to produce a 0.05% SDS treatment solution. Filter through a 0.22 \u00b5m membrane filter. Store at RT for up to 1 month.\n\tNOTE: The SDS solution should not be autoclaved, as SDS precipitates and degrades upon autoclaving.\nPrepare the DNase treatment solution by dissolving 1.21 g of Tris base in 0.5 mL of dH2O and add 1 mL of 1 M magnesium chloride (MgCl2). Adjust the pH to 7.8 with NaOH/HCl. Autoclave and store at RT. Add DNase I prior to use (50 U/mL).\n2. Sample collection\nNOTE: Wild-type C57/BL6 mice were utilized in the study. All techniques were conducted in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nEuthanize adult pregnant female mice at embryonic day (E) 18.5 of pregnancy using isoflurane inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Subject the mice to terminal dissection to extract the fetuses.\n\t\nSpray the abdomen of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nUsing surgical forceps and scissors, lift a fold of skin in the lower abdomen and make a U-shaped incision to expose the abdominal cavity18.\nCollect the uterine horns containing the E18.5 fetuses by cutting the oviducts and cervix and immediately transfer them to a Petri dish with ice-cold 1x PBS with 1% pen/strep18.\nQuickly remove the fetuses from the uterus and extraembryonic tissues and euthanize them by decapitation using scissors18.\nTransfer one fetus at a time to a Petri dish with ice-cold 1x PBS. Using a stereo microscope, remove the skin and cut off the limbs. From the ventral side, cut through the ribcage and remove the sternum and the underlying organs.Flip the fetal trunk dorsal side up. Remove the cervical portion of the vertebral column, the dorsal fat deposits, and the connective tissue on top of the deep back muscles.\nUse surgical forceps to anchor the ribcage and carefully scrape and detach the deep back muscles from the surrounding tissues using a micro scalpel10. This procedure results in the isolation of two muscle pieces per fetus (left and right), both primarily composed of longissimus and iliocostalis muscles, with some of the transversospinalis and levator costarum muscles included.\nStore the muscle samples in 1x PBS with 1% pen/strep at 4 \u00b0C for short-term storage (<1 week), or at -80 \u00b0C for longer periods.\n\t\u200bNOTE: Use freshly collected samples for best results. Samples frozen for extended periods (>3 months) show lower decellularization efficiency and more protein degradation. Epaxial muscle masses were used for the decellularization experiments, but other muscles (e.g., limb muscles) can be processed for decellularization using the same protocol.\n3. Fetal skeletal muscle decellularization\nNOTE: All techniques were conducted in a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions. For a detailed schematic representation, see Figure 1A. All steps were performed with agitation in an orbital shaker with a diameter of 120 mm (165 rpm) at 25 \u00b0C unless stated otherwise. Add 1% pen/strep to solutions before use. When removing the solutions, aspirate carefully to avoid sample entrapment in the pipette.\nDay 1\u00a0- Prepare approximately 2 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm (~3.5 mg) tissue fragments from the epaxial muscle masses. Add 3 mL of hypotonic buffer with 1% pen/strep to each well of a 12-well plate and add one whole muscle tissue fragment per well.\n\t\nIncubate the tissue fragments in hypotonic buffer with agitation for 18 h (overnight) (O/N).Day 2\u00a0- Aspirate the hypotonic buffer using a fine-tip pipette and wash the samples 3 x 1 h with 3 mL of 1x PBS each time with agitation.\n\t\nIncubate the samples for 24 h with 3 mL of 0.05% SDS detergent solution with agitation.\n\t\tNOTE: (CHECK POINT) After SDS incubation, the samples should be transparent in appearance. The samples display a gelatin-like consistency and are, therefore, more prone to adhere to the pipette when removing the liquids.\nDay 3\u00a0- Remove the SDS detergent solution using a fine-tip pipette and wash the tissue fragments 3 x 20 min with 3 mL of hypotonic wash buffer each time with agitation.\n\tNOTE: (PAUSE POINT) The samples can be maintained in hypotonic wash buffer at 4 \u00b0C for 18 h (O/N). Ensure SDS is well removed during washing steps, as residual SDS can be cytotoxic.\n\t\nIncubate the tissue fragments for 3 h with 2 mL of DNase solution with agitation at 37 \u00b0C.\nRemove the DNase solution using a fine-tip pipette and wash the tissue fragments 3 x 20 min with 3 mL of 1x PBS each time with agitation. Finally, wash O/N with agitation (60 rpm).\n\t\tNOTE: After the DNase treatment, the dECMs become sticky due to the presence of DNA residues. Therefore, careful washing is necessary.\nStore the dECMs in 1x PBS with 1% pen/strep at 4 \u00b0C until recellularization (<1 week). For other uses, store at -80 \u00b0C.\n4. Decellularization quality assessment\nNOTE: DNA quantification, DAPI/methyl green staining, and phalloidin staining were performed to evaluate the presence of residual cell contents after decellularization. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses were conducted to assess the retention of key ECM proteins after decellularization.\nQuantification of the DNA present in the dECMNOTE: The dECMs should be compared to the native tissue to detect the presence of DNA.\n\t\nPrior to decellularization, weigh a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on a high precision digital scale. Before transferring the muscle sample to the tube, remove all the remaining 1x PBS using a paper towel. Weigh the tube with the sample. Calculate the wet weight of the samples using equation (1):\n\t\t\u200bSamplewet weight = weighttube with samples- weightempty tube\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (1)\nDecellularize the samples following the protocol described in section 3.\nPlace the samples in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: The samples can be kept at -20 \u00b0C until DNA extraction and quantification.\nPerform DNA extraction of the dECMs and native tissue samples using a spin column-based kit. Add the digestion buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nHomogenize the samples in a bead mill twice for 2.5 min each time (flipping the mounts) using one tungsten carbide bead per tube (use chilled tube mounts).\nAdd proteinase K and incubate O/N with slow agitation at 56 \u00b0C.\nProceed with the protocol as described in the manufacturer's instructions.\nElute with the buffer provided by the manufacturer and centrifuge 2 x 1 min at \u22656,000 x g, each time at 4 \u00b0C to increase the DNA yield.\n\t\tNOTE: DNA can be stored at -20 \u00b0C until quantification.\nQuantify the DNA present in the samples using a fluorescent dsDNA detection kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nNormalize the DNA content as nanograms of DNA per milligram of original wet weight of sample.\nAnalyze the data using a two-tailed Student's t-test and express as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).\nImmunohistochemistryNOTE: Solutions 1, 2, and 3 and the fixative solution should be prepared before use and can be kept frozen for up to 6 months.

Cell culture in decellularized matrices\nNOTE: All the techniques were performed under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood. All incubations were performed at 37 \u00b0C and with 5% CO2.Prepare the cell culture medium, high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with stable glutamine and with sodium pyruvate (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% pen/strep (complete culture medium).\nPlace the dECMs in a Petri dish in 1x PBS with 1% pen/strep in a laminar flow hood and separate them into pieces of approximately 500 \u00b5m x 500 \u00b5m x 250 \u00b5m, using a micro scalpel and tweezers.\n\tNOTE: dECMs have a soft texture, and therefore it is often easier to use tweezers to separate them into approximately same sized pieces instead of cutting them with the micro scalpel.\nTransfer the fragments into a 96-well plate (three or four pieces per well) with 200 \u00b5L of complete culture medium, previously warmed to 37 \u00b0C. Incubate for 2 h in the incubator.\nAdd 500 \u00b5L of trypsin to a T25 flask seeded with sub-confluent (~70%) C2C12 cells.

Every 2 days, carefully aspirate the medium with a micropipette to prevent the dECMs from detaching from the bottom of the well and add fresh medium until day 8.NOTE: Matrices are kept for 2 days in 96-well plates to promote C2C12 cell adhesion to the dECMs, and are then transferred to a 48-well plate to allow access to a larger volume of medium with nutrients. dECMs should adhere to the bottom of the wells.\nFor the differentiation experiment, replace the complete culture medium with differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum and 1% pen/strep) on day 8, followed by incubation in differentiation medium for 4 days until day 12.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "1. Prepare the Materials\nPurify the protein of interest (see section 2).\nPrepare or purchase G-actin.\n\tNOTE: G-actin can be isolated from multiple sources1; alternatively, it can be purchased. Reconstituted G-actin (in 5 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP (adenosine triphosphate), and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) should be flash frozen, stored at -80 \u00b0C and >10 mg/mL in small (10-20 \u00b5L) aliquots, and thawed just before use. G-actin aliquots should not be refrozen.\nPrepare or purchase a control protein, such as BSA (see step 4.4).\nPrepare 10x polymerization buffer (200 mM imidazole pH 7.0, 1 M KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, and 10 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(\u03b2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)). Make a 10x stock and adjust the pH after the addition of ATP, if necessary. Aliquot (25 \u00b5L is a useful volume) and store at -80 \u00b0C.\nPrepare 10x reaction buffer (200 mM imidazole pH 7.0, 1.5 M NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, and 10 mM EGTA). Make a 10x stock and adjust the pH after the addition of ATP, if necessary. Aliquot (50-100 \u00b5L is a useful volume) and store at -80 \u00b0C.\n\tNOTE: The composition of the reaction buffer is flexible and may need to be adjusted to reduce background sedimentation, limit non-specific binding, and/or improve binding (steps 1.5.1-1.5.3).\n\t\nAdjust the pH of the reaction buffer between 6 and 8 to optimize protein stability. At a lower or higher pH, substitute an appropriate buffer for imidazole.NOTE: Use pH 7.0 as a starting point, unless a protein requires a lower or higher pH for stability. Do not use a buffer with a pH below 6.0 or higher than 8.0, as this may disrupt the actin. Recommended buffers (final concentration and optimal pH listed) include: 20 mM MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid), pH = 6.5; 20 mM imidazole, pH = 7.0; 10 mM HEPES (4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid), pH = 7.5; and 20 mM Tris, pH = 8.0.\nVary the salt concentration of the reaction buffer, depending on the needs of the assay.\n\t\tNOTE: Actin is an acidic protein, and almost all actin-binding proteins rely to some extent on electrostatic interactions to associate with actin. Therefore, increasing the salt concentration decreases the actin binding in most cases. The reaction buffer uses a physiological level of salt (150 mM NaCl, working concentration), and this is the recommended starting point. If necessary, the salt concentration can be lowered (e.g., to 100 mM) to promote binding or increased to limit binding.\nDo not change the concentrations of MgCl2, ATP, or EGTA in the reaction buffer unless there is a specific reason to do so.\n2. Prepare the Test Protein for the Assay\nPrepare a high-purity protein using liquid chromatography for the best results7.\n\tNOTE: If using recombinant protein, large protein tags, such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) should be removed by protease cleavage from the target protein, as they can interfere with binding. GST also causes homodimerization of fusion proteins, which can artificially increase the affinity of actin binding.\nDetermine the protein concentration by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Divide by the extinction coefficient; the extinction coefficient can be calculated from the protein sequence using sequence analysis or online tools. Alternatively, determine the protein concentration using Bradford or BCA (bicinchoninic acid) methods.NOTE: For initial experiments, 50-100 \u00b5L of protein at 20-40 \u00b5M is usually sufficient. This will permit the analysis of binding in the low micromolar range, a useful starting point for most actin-binding proteins. A larger quantity, and oftentimes a higher concentration of protein are needed to generate a binding curve to calculate the affinity (see section 5).\nJust before use, hard spin the protein (50,000-100,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) to remove the aggregates of insoluble protein. If solubility is a concern, re-measure the protein concentration (step 2.2) after centrifugation.\n3. Prepare the F-actin\nRemove an aliquot of G-actin from the -80 \u00b0C freezer and thaw it quickly.\nAdd the 10x polymerization buffer to the G-actin to a final concentration of 1x. Ensure that the G-actin concentration in 1x polymerization buffer is at least 10-20 \u00b5M, well above the critical concentration. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature (RT) to allow the actin to polymerize.\nAfter polymerization, store the F-actin in solution at 4 \u00b0C, where it will be stable for a few weeks. Before using the F-actin again after storage, gently invert or flick the tube several times to ensure that all actin is dissolved and uniformly distributed in solution.\n\tNOTE: (Optional) Add phalloidin to achieve a 1:1 molar ratio of G-actin:phalloidin. Incubate for 30 min at RT to allow the phalloidin to bind to the F-actin. Phalloidin stabilizes F-actin and accomplishes two things: (i) it reduces the amount of actin that does not sediment during centrifugation and (ii) it allows F-actin to be diluted below the critical concentration (~0.5 \u00b5M), which is often necessary if varying the amount of F-actin to generate a binding curve (see section 5 on measuring the affinity).\n4. Pelleting Assay \u2013 Basic ProtocolNOTE: The basic protocol described in section 4 is used to determine if a protein of interest co-sediments with F-actin. Once the binding to F-actin is established, the affinity of this interaction can be measured following the protocol described in section 5.\nPrepare the reaction buffer the day of use by diluting the 10x stock to 1x and add DTT to a final concentration of 1 mM.\n\tNOTE: (Optional) Add polidocanol to a final working concentration of 0.02% in the reaction buffer. Polidocanol is a surfactant that reduces non-specific background binding and helps to prevent hydrophobic proteins from sticking to the ultracentrifuge tube.\nDilute the protein of interest to the desired concentrations in 1x reaction buffer in ultracentrifuge tubes. Keep the sample volumes low (40-60 \u00b5L) to avoid using large amounts of protein by using ultracentrifuge tubes with small minimum volumes (e.g., 7 x 20 mm tubes that hold 0.2 mL each).\n\tNOTE: Since many actin-binding proteins have an affinity for F-actin in the micromolar range, testing a protein of interest at 2 and 10 \u00b5M is recommended. If binding is not observed at 10 \u00b5M, it is unlikely that binding will be observed at higher concentrations. If the added protein makes up more than 10-20% of the final reaction volume, it may be necessary to dialyze the protein into the reaction buffer before performing the experiment.\nAdd F-actin to the desired final concentration.\n\tNOTE: 2 \u00b5M is a useful concentration for initial experiments because it is well above the critical concentration, thus maintaining actin in the filamentous state It will produce a visible pellet when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (step 4.10).\nPrepare the following controls in ultracentrifuge tubes to make the assay informative.Prepare sample(s) containing the protein of interest without F-actin. Ensure that the concentration of protein in these samples matches the concentration in the \"plus F-actin\" samples.\n\t\tNOTE: These samples will determine the amount of protein that is aggregated or stuck to the sides of the ultracentrifuge tube in the absence of F-actin.\nPrepare negative control samples at the same or similar concentration(s) used for the protein of interest. Use a control protein that does not bind to F-actin, with and without F-actin.\n\t\tNOTE: This is an important control because proteins can become \"trapped\" in actin filaments and pellet with F-actin, even though they do not bind F-actin. The amount of trapping can vary depending on the F-actin source, buffer conditions, etc. Thus, this control should be included in all experiments. Ideally, the control protein should have a molecular weight similar to the protein of interest (e.g., for \u03b1E-catenin (~100 kDa), BSA (66 kDa) is an appropriate control). Commercially available gel filtration standards make excellent control proteins, since they cover a range of sizes and tend not to contain aggregates.\nOptionally, prepare positive control samples containing a protein that binds to F-actin, with and without F-actin. Ensure that the concentration(s) are similar to those of the protein of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: This control is helpful in that it demonstrates that the experimental conditions (e.g., prepared F-actin, reaction buffer, and centrifugation) permit F-actin binding. Since the pelleting assay can fail to detect weak F-actin interactions (see the Discussion), it is recommended that the known F-actin binding protein have a moderate-to-weak affinity for F-actin (i.e., in the low micromolar range). Purified F-actin binding proteins are commercially available.\nIncubate all samples for 30 min at RT.NOTE: Longer incubation times are fine, assuming that the protein of interest is stable, although likely unnecessary. If the protein of interest is not stable at RT, then samples can be incubated at 4 \u00b0C. In this case, longer incubation times may be necessary.\nLoad the samples into the centrifuge rotor. Position the tubes within the rotor to assist in resuspending the pellet after centrifugation. For this, mark all centrifuge tubes (e.g., with a sample number) and place all tubes in the rotor in the same position (e.g., the number facing out).\nCentrifuge at 100,000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C in an ultracentrifuge.\nAfter centrifugation, remove 3/4 of the supernatant (e.g., 45 \u00b5L if the starting volume was 60 \u00b5L) from each tube and mix with 1/3 volumes of 4x sample buffer (15 \u00b5L in this case) in a separate microcentrifuge tube.\nRemove the remaining supernatant with a gel-loading tip, taking care not to disturb the pellet (which may be visible as a glassy spot).\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to remove the supernatant from the tubes as soon as possible after the completion of the centrifuge run to limit protein dissociation post-separation. Also, do not wash the pellet with reaction buffer for the same reason.\nAdd 4/3 volumes of 1x sample buffer to each pellet (e.g., 80 \u00b5L if the starting volume was 60 \u00b5L).\n\tNOTE: This makes the dilution the same as for the supernatant (step 4.8, 1/3 volumes of 4x sample buffer were added), permitting the direct comparison between pellet and supernatant samples and the determination of the percentage of protein that was pelleted.\n\t\nAdd sample buffer to all tubes and incubate for at least 5 min at RT. Allow the pellet to sit in the sample buffer to improve sample recovery.Triturate the sample 8-10 times with a p200 pipette tip to resuspended the pellet by continuously washing the pellet area of the tube. Gently scrape the pipette tip over the pellet during the trituration to help with resuspension.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to avoid introducing air into the sample during the trituration, as this will cause the sample buffer to bubble and will reduce sample recovery.\nTransfer the resuspended samples to microfuge tubes after trituration.\nAnalyze the supernatant and pellet samples by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining8 by loading 10-15 \u00b5L of sample per lane; this is sufficient to visualize the proteins.\n\tNOTE: Proteins that co-sediment with F-actin will be enriched in the \"plus F-actin\" pellet samples over the \"no F-actin\" pellet samples (Figure 1A). Standard Coomassie blue staining is sufficient for detection if the protein concentrations are in the 0.1-10 \u00b5M range. Colloidal Coomassie9 or Western blotting can be used to increase the sensitivity if lower protein concentrations are used to measure higher-affinity interactions.\nImage Coomassie-stained gels using a scanner or imaging system (step 5.12).\n5. Pelleting Assay\u00a0\u2013 Quantification\nNote: If specific binding to F-actin is observed, it can be useful to measure the affinity of the interaction. This is accomplished by making a few changes and additions to the protocol outlined in section 4. For an excellent guide to designing and interpreting binding assays, see Pollard10. A flow chart (Figure 2) is provided for assistance with the analysis and quantification.\nDetermine the concentration range to test.NOTE: The concentration range will depend on the protein and should span from a concentration below the apparent Kd (e.g., 1 \u00b5M) to concentrations high enough to saturate binding. It is critical that the binding reaches saturation in multiple samples at the high end of the concentration range to generate an accurate binding curve (Figure 1C). As noted above, many actin-binding proteins have an affinity for F-actin in the low micromolar range (1-5 \u00b5M). For a protein with a Kd of 0.5-1 \u00b5M, a useful starting concentration range would be 0.1-10 \u00b5M.\nHard spin (step 2.3) the protein of interest to remove aggregates. Serially dilute the protein to make a concentration series containing 7-8 samples at 2x the final concentration to be tested. For example, if the range to test is 0.1-8 \u00b5M, prepare the following dilutions in 1x reaction buffer: 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.2 \u00b5M.\n\tNOTE: As mentioned in step 4.2, if the added protein makes up more than 10%-20% of the first dilution (the 16 \u00b5M sample in the example above), it may be necessary to either concentrate the protein further or to dialyze the protein into 1x reaction buffer. Be sure to prepare enough of each dilution for \"plus F-actin\" and \"no F-actin\" samples.\nPrepare samples (as in section 4), by diluting the protein of interest to the desired concentrations in 1x reaction buffer in ultracentrifuge tubes. Keep the sample volumes low (40-60 \u00b5L) to avoid using large amounts of protein by using ultracentrifuge tubes with small minimum volumes (e.g., 7 x 20-mm tubes that hold 0.2 mL each).Add F-actin to the desired final concentration to the appropriate samples and bring up the volume using 1x reaction buffer. For example, for 50-\u00b5L reactions using 2 \u00b5M F-actin, ensure that each sample has 25 \u00b5L of 2x protein, 10 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5M F-actin, and 15 \u00b5L of 1x reaction buffer. Include control samples (steps 4.4.2 and 4.4.3).\n\t\tNOTE: For negative and positive controls, use one concentration within the range to be tested (step 5.1), ideally near the middle to the high end of the range (e.g., 4 \u00b5M if the concentration range is 0.1-10 \u00b5M).\nIncubate all samples for 30 min at RT.\nAfter 30 min, remove 1/5 of each sample (e.g., 10 \u00b5L of the 50-\u00b5L reaction) and mix with 20 \u00b5L of water and 10 \u00b5L of 4x sample buffer.\n\tNOTE: These are the \"Total\" samples and will be used to generate a standard curve.\nLoad the samples into the ultracentrifuge rotor. Centrifuge for 20 min at 100,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C.\nOptionally, after centrifugation, remove 3/4 of the supernatant (e.g., 30 \u00b5L if the centrifuged volume was 40 \u00b5L) from each tube and mix with 4x sample buffer (10 \u00b5L in this case) in a separate microfuge tube. Remove the remaining supernatant with a gel-loading tip, taking care not to disturb the pellet.\n\tNOTE: When measuring the binding affinity, it is not necessary to run the supernatant. Nonetheless, it can be useful to save the supernatant, especially when testing a new protein.\nRemove the supernatant if not analyzing (step 5.7).\nResuspend the pellet in 1 volume of 1x sample buffer (e.g., 40 \u00b5L if the centrifuged volume was 40 \u00b5L).\nAdd sample buffer to all tubes and incubate for at least 5 min at RT.Triturate the sample 8-10 times with a p200 pipette tip, continually washing the pellet area of the tube. Gently scrape the pipette tip over the pellet during the trituration to help with resuspension.\nTransfer the resuspended protein to a microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: These are the \"Pellet\" samples.\nAnalyze the Total and Pellet samples by SDS-PAGE8. Run all samples on one gel if possible; if not, run the pellet samples on one gel and the total samples on a second.\n\tNOTE: Given the number of samples, a large gel system is recommended for analysis. If running samples on two or more gels, it is important that all gels be stained identically (i.e., the same Coomassie solution and an identical time in stain/destain).\nImage Coomassie-stained gels using an imaging system that measures protein band intensities over a wide (i.e., a two- to three-log) and linear range. Ensure that the images are collected with no saturated pixels.\n\tNOTE: Laser-based imaging systems offer the best sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios.\nUsing ImageJ or a similar analysis program, measure protein band intensities and calculate the amount of bound protein.\n\tNOTE: For all sample measurements, use the selection tool in ImageJ to draw a region of interest (ROI) around each band and measure (Analyze > Measure) the area and mean gray value. Calculate the background for each gel by measuring the mean gray value from an area without sample. Subtract the background mean gray value from each ROI mean gray value and then multiply by the area to obtain the integrated density value for each band.\n\t\nMeasure the protein of interest band intensities from the Total samples (Figure 2A).\nGenerate a standard curve by plotting the band intensity (i.e., the integrated density measurements) versus protein mass (Figure 2B).Measure the amount of protein of interest that co-sedimented with F-actin (co-sedimented protein, Figure 2C).\nMeasure the amount of protein of interest that sedimented in the absence of F-actin (background sedimentation, Figure 2D).\nSubtract the background sedimentation from the co-sedimented protein (i.e., subtract the values from step 5.13.4 from step 5.13.3) to determine the amount of protein that bound to F-actin.\nMeasure the amount of F-actin in each pellet (Figure 2E). Determine the average amount of F-actin per sample and then divide each sample by the average to determine the ratio of F-actin in each sample relative to the average (i.e., the numbers below the bands).\nFor each sample, divide the amount of bound protein (calculated in step 5.13.5) by the F-actin actin pellet ratio (step 5.13.6) to adjust for differences in the pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: This value is the normalized bound protein.\nUse the standard curve (step 5.13.2) to calculate the amount (mass) of normalized bound protein (step 5.13.7) in each sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The protein removed initially (the \"Total\" sample), as well as the amount loaded (which, unless the entire pellet was loaded, will be some fraction of the pellet), must be accounted for when calculating the total amount of protein that pelleted.\nDetermine the concentration of bound protein in each sample from the total mass of protein in the pellet (calculated in step 5.13.8) and the volume of the sample. Subtract this value from the starting concentration to determine the amount of free protein. Divide the concentration of bound protein by the concentration of actin (\u00b5M/\u00b5M of actin) and plot versus the concentration of free protein to generate a binding curve (Figure 1C).NOTE: Since F-actin is not a single, uniform species it is difficult to extrapolate the molar concentration of F-actin from the G-actin concentration. Use the starting G-actin concentration to determine the amount of bound protein (\u00b5M/\u00b5M of actin) and estimate the apparent concentration of binding sites in the reaction. The concentration of binding sites is usually less than the concentration of actin monomers in the reaction because not all of the actin polymerizes and because a single actin binding protein molecule can make contact with multiple monomers on the actin filament.\nUsing a statistical program, determine the affinity (Kd) and Bmax from the binding curve by using nonlinear least-squares regression.\n\tNOTE: Scatchard plots are discouraged for analyzing binding data, partly because they can obscure whether binding is saturated and because they can distort experimental error10.", "Muscle excisionEuthanize the mouse following guidelines approved by the institution.Notes:Both male and female mice can be used. For this protocol a genetically engineered animal model of the lysosomal storage disease sialidosis (de Geest et al., 2002) crossed into C57Bl/6 or FVB background was used. The isolation of the hind limb muscles does not require the use of a biosafety cabinet. No sterile conditions are necessary.Pin the mouse down in a prone position (dorsal side up) to the dissecting pad (Figure 1A). Spray the mouse with 70% ethanol.Note: For the isolation of other muscle types, pin the mouse down in a supine position (ventral side up) to the dissecting board. Remove the skin from both hind limbs to expose the muscles and gently cut away the fascia of both hind limb muscles. Locate the Achilles tendon and separate it from the bone with a pair of forceps (Figure 1B).Notes: Shaving the fur is not necessary for this procedure. There is not a standard method for the removal of the fur/skin to expose the muscles. The procedure we use is as follows: Make a ~1 cm cut in the skin at the level of the hip joint and carefully pull the skin towards the ankle to expose the leg muscles. Cut the Achilles tendon and carefully pull the GA muscle upwards towards the knee joint and cut it loose at the tendon (Figures 1C and 1D).Note: As the tendons from the GA and soleus are interconnected (forming the Achilles tendon) it is not possible to separate them. Remove the soleus (darker red colored part of the muscle).When the GA and soleus muscles are cut at the knee joint, the soleus will detach from the GA muscle and can be lifted up and cut at the Achilles tendon to separate it from the GA muscle (Figures 1E and 1F).Note: The removal of the soleus allows for a purer fibroblast isolation from the remaining GA muscle. Weight a 50 ml tube containing 5 ml DPBS.Combine the GA muscles from both legs and transfer them to the pre-weighted 50 ml tube and weight the tube again. Place the tube on ice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200325/20200325192948_3482.jpgFigure 1. Dissection of GA muscle from the hind limb of adult mice. A. Picture presented here shows the mouse legs before removal of the fur/skin. B. The fur/skin is removed to expose the GA muscle (dashed lines) and the Achilles tendon, which is separated from the bone by a pair of forceps. C. The Achilles tendon is cut. D. The GA/soleus muscles are pulled upwards and cut at the knee joint. E. Isolated GA muscle is shown with the soleus (darker red and dashed lines) that is still attached. F. GA muscle is shown after removal of the soleus.Fibroblasts isolation from the gastrocnemius musclePrepare the biosafety hood by placing all necessary tools inside, including tube racks, pipets, dishes, tubes, tip boxes.Take two scalpels out of the sterile wrap and place them in the hood.Place a 10 cm dish open in the hood.Take out the sterile forceps and transfer the two GA muscles into the 10 cm dish.Note: The tissues contain residual amount of DPBS, which keeps the tissue moist during the procedure. Chop the muscles with the scalpels until it become a fine paste.Transfer the finely chopped muscle paste onto a 50 ml tube using the scalpels, cap the tube and place it back on ice.Notes:Additional DPBS is not required to transfer the minced muscle tissue with scalpels. If additional muscle samples need to be processed, repeat steps B4-B6 and transfer each chopped muscle paste to a new 50 ml tube. Add digestion mixture to each tube; 3.5x volume/mg tissue (see Recipes 1-4) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 45 min.Note: Alternatively, a tissue dissociator can be used to dissociate the muscles. During the 45 min digestion period, the tissue suspension needs to be mixed every 10 min by pipetting it up and down with a 5 ml pipet. This will promote the complete dissociation of the tissue.Add 20 ml complete medium to each tube to terminate the enzymatic digestion (see Recipe 5).Place a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer on a new 50 ml tube.Filter the tissue/cell suspension through the strainer, rinsing it with an additional 5.0 ml complete medium.Centrifuge the tissue/cell suspension at 300 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min.Resuspend the pellet containing the cells in 10 ml complete medium.Seed the resuspended pellet in a 10 cm dish (Passage 0, P0) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO2/3% O2.Note: The fibroblasts are cultured at a low oxygen level to keep the culture conditions as close as possible to the physiologic conditions, since the O2 level in skeletal muscle is around 2.5% (Mas-Bargues et al., 2019).Fibroblasts culture, trypsinization and expansionCulture the P0 fibroblasts until 100% confluency plus 1 day.Notes:Primary fibroblasts at P0 are routinely cultured until 100% confluency plus 1 day (and only for P0) to purge the cultures from any contaminating cells. The expected yield of fibroblasts (P0) from one pair of hind limb gastrocnemius muscles ranges from 1 to 5 x 106 cells, depending on the age and background of the mouse used.When cells are ready to be expanded, remove the culture medium and rinse the cells with 10 ml DPBS.Note: Be sure to remove all DPBS because it may interfere with the TrypLE express enzymatic activity. Add 1.0 ml TrypLE to the dish and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min.Tap the side of the dish and check under the microscope for complete detachment of the cells. If necessary, incubate another 5 min at 37 \u00b0C.Add 10 ml complete medium to inactivate the TrypLE and transfer the cells into a 50 ml tube.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Note: At this point P0 cells can be resuspended in freezing medium to be frozen for later use (see Recipe 6). Resuspend the cells in 10 ml complete medium.If needed, cells can be counted by mixing 10 \u03bcl cell suspension with 10 \u03bcl Trypan Blue and transferred to the Countess cell counter chamber.Note: Any type of cell counter can be used as long as it gives an accurate count of viable cells. Cells are seeded at a concentration of 1.0 x 105/ml, resulting in 2 x 106 cells (20 ml) per 15 cm dish.Culture the cells at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO2/3% O2 until 80%-90% confluency (Passage 1, P1).Repeat Steps C2 to C10 for additional passaging of the culture.Notes:The number of 15 cm dishes needed will depend on the total number of cells required; e.g., at P2 cells are seeded in 2-4, 15 cm dishes; at P4 they are seeded in 15-30, 15 cm dishes if a high yield of exosomes is required. The yield of exosomes from a 15 cm dish of primary fibroblasts is ~3-4 \u03bcg. We suggest seeding 20-25, 15 cm dishes to obtain enough exosomes for subsequent analyses.After P4, primary cells are discarded and not used for any further experiments as they change their characteristics.Crude Exosome isolationWash the 15 cm dishes containing fibroblasts (P2-P4) with 10 ml DPBS.Note: Be sure to remove all DPBS because it may interfere with the TrypLE express enzymatic activity. Add 2.5 ml TrypLE to each dish and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min.Tap the side of the dish and check under the microscope for complete detachment of the cells. If necessary, incubate another 5 min at 37 \u00b0C.Add 10 ml complete medium to inactivate the TrypLE and transfer the cells to a 50 ml tube.Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Resuspend the cells in 10 ml complete exosome free medium (see Recipes 7 and 8).Note: All vesicles/exosomes naturally present in FBS need to be removed prior to adding the FBS to the fibroblast culture medium, as they will interfere with further experimental analyses. If needed, cells can be counted by mixing 10 \u03bcl cell suspension with 10 \u03bcl Trypan Blue and transferred to the Countess cell counter chamber.Note: Any type of cell counter can be used as long as it gives an accurate count of viable cells. Seed the cells in the exosome free medium at the concentration of 1.5 x 106 - 2.0 x 106 per 15 cm dish and incubate at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO2/3% O2.Collect the conditioned medium in 50 ml tubes on ice after 16 to 24 h.Notes:The collected medium can be stored at 4 \u00b0C up to one week, if not processed immediately. If cells are not 80% confluent at the time of medium harvesting, fresh exosomal medium can be added and collected after an additional 16 to 24 h period. Combine the two batches of conditioned medium for further processing.Centrifuge the conditioned medium at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and transfer it to a new 50 ml tube on ice (Figure 2.1).Note: This step is performed to eliminate viable cells. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C (Figure 2.2).Note: This step is performed to eliminate dead cells. Transfer supernatant to a thin wall Polypropylene tube on ice and centrifuge in an ultracentrifuge at 10,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min (Figure 2.3).Note: This step removes organelles, apoptotic bodies and membrane fragments. Centrifugation at 10,000 x g can also be performed using a Sorval centrifuge. Transfer the supernatant to an ultra-clear tube on ice and ultracentrifuge it at 100,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 1.5 h (Figure 2.4).Note: If exosomes need to be under sterile condition, the open ultra-clear tubes can be exchanged for sterile ultra-clear tubes with lids. Carefully discard the supernatant with a 10 ml pipette. Leave about 1.0 ml of liquid in the tube to avoid disturbance of the pellet.Add an additional 1.0 ml of ice-cold DPBS and resuspend the pellet using a P1000 pipette.Fill the tube up to 35 ml with ice-cold DPBS and ultracentrifuge at 100,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 1.5 h (Figure 2.5).Carefully discard the supernatant and leave the tube containing the pellet on ice.Note: The pellet should be translucent and may be hard to visualize, therefore the supernatant should be removed very carefully. Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of ice-cold DPBS (~25 \u03bcl/15 cm dish).The exosomes can be kept at 4 \u00b0C up to one week. For long-term storage exosomes should be stored at -80 \u00b0C.Notes:Avoid freezing/thawing cycles, which can damage exosomes and reduce their numbers. The exosomes should be aliquoted if multiple experiments are performed.The crude exosomes can be used for a variety of analyses, including Western blots and in vitro uptake experiments. When needed, mass spec analysis can be performed on crude exosomes. Run fifty \u03bcg of crude exosomes on a 10% bis-tris gel for ~1 cm into the gel and cut 3 equal sized bands for in-gel digestion (sequencing grade modified trypsin solution) prior to LC-MS/MS. Quantification of crude exosomes for Western blot analysisNote: As an alternative, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) as well as dynamic light scattering (DSL) can be used to characterize exosomes (Szatanek et al., 2017). Pipet 10 \u03bcl of each albumin standard dilutions (see Table 2) in duplicate into a 96-well plate to obtain the BCA standard curve.Table 2. BCA Standard Curve preparationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200325/20200325193106_5344.jpgPipet 5.0 \u03bcl 0.1% Triton X-100 in ddH2O in duplicate in a 96-welll plate (see Recipe 9).Add 5.0 \u03bcl of the exosomal samples to the wells containing 0.1% Triton X-100, resulting in a 1:2 dilution.Note: The resuspended exosomal pellet should be diluted further (1:5 or 1:10), depending on the final yield of the preparation. Add 200 \u03bcl BCA working solution to all wells (see Recipe 10).Incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min and read the protein concentration at OD562 using a plate reader.On average 1 x 106 primary fibroblasts will yield approximately 3-4 \u03bcg exosomes that can be resuspended directly into electrophoresis loading buffer (0.5 \u03bcl of 1.0 M DTT (Recipe 11), 5.0 \u03bcl Laemmli sample buffer (4x) and 14.5 \u03bcl of ddH2O).Sucrose density gradient for purification of exosomesPrepare all the solutions needed for the sucrose density gradient and keep them on ice (see Recipes 12-15 and Table 3).Table 3. Sucrose gradient solutionsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200325/20200325193215_7646.jpg*SGWS: Sucrose Gradient Working Solution (see Recipe 13).Resuspend 30 to 100 \u03bcg of exosomes in 1.0 ml of 0.25 M sucrose solution.Prepare the gradient in a 13 ml ultra-clear tube by pipetting the sucrose solutions in sequence starting from the bottom of the tube with 1.5 ml of 2.0 M, 2.5 ml of 1.3 M, 2.5 ml of 1.16 M, 2.0 ml of 0.8 M, 2.0 ml of 0.5 M sucrose. Layer the gradient at the top with 1.0 ml sucrose solution containing exosomes (Figure 2.6).Centrifuge the gradient at 100,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 2.5 h, using a swinging bucket rotor (Figure 2.6).Carefully take the tubes out of the rotor and place them on ice.Collect 1.0 ml fractions starting from the top of the gradient and transfer them to 1.7 ml Eppendorf tubes on ice (Figure 2.7).Add 110 \u03bcl 100% TCA to each tube, mix well and incubate at room temperature for 10 min (see Recipe 16) (Figure 2.8).Centrifuge at 10,000 x g at room temperature for 10 min and discard the supernatant.Wash the pellets with 500 \u03bcl pre-cooled 80% ethanol, pipetting up and down, and place the resuspended pellets at -20 \u00b0C for 10 min (see Recipe 17).Centrifuge at 10,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min.Remove carefully the supernatant and let the pellets air dry for 10-15 min.Resuspend the pellets in 15-30 \u03bcl ice cold DPBS.Notes:The volume of DPBS used to resuspend the pellets depends on the starting material and the size of the pellet. For Western blot analyses, resuspend each pellet in electrophoresis loading buffer (0.5 \u03bcl 1.0 M DTT (Recipe 16), 5.0 \u03bcl Laemmli sample buffer (4x) and 14.5 \u03bcl of ddH2O). Measure the protein concentration according to Steps E1 to E5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200325/20200325193303_5423.jpgFigure 2.

Fraction collection (7) after ultra-centrifugation and precipitation with TCA (8).Western blot analyses of crude exosomes and purified sucrose gradient samplesPrepare the electrophoresis running buffer and the buffer for transferring the proteins from the gel onto a PVDF membrane (Recipes 18-21).For the protein transfer, cut filter papers and membranes according to the size the gels used.Note: Filter papers and PVDF membranes are cut 7 cm by 9 cm for mini gels and 9 cm by 14 cm for midi gels. Assemble the precast gel in the electrophoresis tank and fill the tank with running buffer.Notes:See instruction manual from Bio-Rad (https://www.bio-rad.com/[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/]) for \u201cMini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell Precast\u201d. Gels with different percentage of polyacryamide are used depending on the molecular weight of the proteins that need to be resolved: 7.5% for proteins of 50-200 kDa, 10% for proteins of 15-100 kDa, 12% for proteins of 10-70 kDa and 15% for proteins of 12-45 kDa. Boil the exosomes (from crude exosomal preparations or purified sucrose density gradient fractions) resuspended in loading buffer for 5 min. Spin the samples at ~10,000 x g for 30 s prior to loading them on a precast gel.Before loading of the samples, rinse the wells of the gel with running buffer.Load the precast gel with the exosomal samples and the protein markers, using round loading tips.Note: Resuspend each sample thoroughly prior to loading the gel. Run the gel at 100 V until the dye of the loading buffer reaches the base of the gel.Carefully remove the gel from the cassette, placed it on the Chemidoc imaging tray containing 1.0 ml of transfer buffer and image it, using a Stain-Free program (Figure 3).Note: The stain-free gel is a handy tool to assess if the loading is equal in all samples.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200325/20200325193357_8939.jpgFigure 3.

Sterilize the abdomen and hind legs of the mice with 70% ethanol.    Make an incision in the midline of the abdomen, and expose the hind limbs by clipping outward. Remove all muscle from the bones and cut bones at both ends.    Flush out bone marrow progenitor cells from bones using DPBS by syringe with a 26G needle. Flush 3-5 times for each bone by 2 ml DPBS. Spin down cells in Sorval RT7 centrifuge (4 \u00b0C, 1,500 rpm, 5 min).    After aspirating out the supernatant using vacuum suction, treat cells by 5 ml ACK lysis buffer to lyse the erythrocytes (1 min, room temperature).    Next, add 45 ml of DPBS to the lysed cells to balance the osmotic pressure.    Spin cells down again, count cells by hemocytometer, and adjust them to a concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ml in BMM medium. Seed 10 ml cells in each 10-cm tissue culture dish. Expect to yield 1 x 108 of bone marrow cells from three mice.   Culture the cells for 3 days in CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C. Then change for fresh BMM medium and culture for another 4 days (10 ml/dish).    The macrophages are now ready for functional assay.    Place the dishes in a sterile tissue culture hood, and wash the dishes twice with 5 ml cold DPBS.    Add 2 ml 5 mM-EDTA (room temperature) to each dish and wait around 5 min to detach the cells. Add 5 ml D10 to each dish and harvest all the cells. Expect to yield ~5 x 106 of BMDMs per dish.   Using this preparation, more than 95% of the differentiated cells should be macrophages based on F4/80 and CD11b expression. Analyze the expression of these markers by routine flow cytometry techniques.Choose different dyes for each marker (e.g. FITC for F4/80 and APC for CD11b).      Culture of S. aureus to exponential period   One day before the experiment, inoculate S. aureus into 3 ml TSB in a bio-safety cabinet and culture the bacteria overnight in a bacterial incubator shaker (37 \u00b0C, 225 rpm). S. aureus is a bio-safety level 2 pathogen which can cause severe human infections.    On the next morning, dilute 100 \u03bcl overnight culture into 10 ml new TSB. The approximate OD600 is around 0.1. Shake the bacteria approximately 2 hours until OD600 reach around 0.8 (37 \u00b0C, 225 rpm). OD600 of 1.0 is approximately 1.5 x 109 CFU/ml.   Spin down the bacteria (4 \u00b0C, 3,000 rpm, 10 min) and wash twice with 50 ml cold DPBS.   Adjust bacterial concentration to 5 x 108/ml in DPBS. Place the bacteria on ice before assay.      Stain S. aureus with Hexidium Iodide   Aliquot 1 ml S. aureus (5 x 108/ml) into a 50 ml Corning tube.   Add 20 \u03bcl Hexidium Iodide stock and mix it well.    Incubate the bacteria for 15 min in darkness (room temperature).    Wash twice with 50 ml cold DPBS (4 \u00b0C, 3,000 rpm, 10 min).    Re-suspend the bacteria in BMM medium at the concentration of 2 x 107/ml. The bacteria are ready for assay. Use them right away.      Macrophage phagocytosis assay One day before the assay, seed 2 x 106 BMDMs into single wells in a 6-well plate. Apply the multiplicity of infection (MOI) 10 for S. aureus infection.    Briefly, on the day of assay remove the old medium and replace it with new BMM medium containing S. aureus (2 x 107/ml) to each well.   \u00a0Quickly spin the 6-well plate (room temperature, 500 rpm, 5 min).Incubate the cells in a CO2 incubator for 30 min to allow bacterial uptake by BMDMs.    Then add 200 \u03bcl cold Trypsin-EDTA to the cells and incubate for 10 min at room temperature without agitation to remove residual bacteria at macrophage surface.  Note: Trypsin-EDTA solution treatment is to remove the excess bacteria. Prolonged treatment may also affect BMDM adherence, so the treating time shouldn\u2019t exceed 10 min. Trypsin-EDTA treatment will not interfere with F4/80 analysis.    Wash the plate three times with DPBS, using 2ml DPBS for each wash.    Add 0.5 ml 5mM-EDTA (room temperature) to the well to detach the cells in about 5 min and then 2 ml D10. Harvest the BMDMs by spinning (4 \u00b0C, 1,500 rpm, 5 min). Wash cells in 50 ml DPBS and re-suspend cells in 10 ml D10. Count the cells by hemocytometer.      Stain macrophages with FITC-anti-mouse-F4/80   Add 1 x 106 BMDMs from procedure D to 5 ml flow cytometry tube and spin down in Sorval RT7 centrifuge (4 \u00b0C, 1,500 rpm, 5 min). Aspirate the supernatant. Re-suspend cells in 100 \u03bcl DPBS. Three additional control tubes are required for flow cytometry analysis, including one blank tube without fluorescence dye, one FITC-anti-mouse-F4/80 single staining tube and one Hexidium Iodide single staining tube.   Add 1 \u03bcl FITC-anti-mouse-F4/80 to the tube following manufacturer\u2019s instruction (final concentration: 5 \u03bcg/ml). And incubate 20 min in darkness without agitation (room temperature).    Then add 500 \u03bcl DPBS. The cells are ready for flow cytometry assay.      Flow cytometry Routine flow cytometry techniques are applied for phagocytosis analysis following manufacturer\u2019s instruction. In a FACSCanto machine, the fluorescence produced from Hexidium Iodide staining falls into FL2 channel (Excitation 488/Emmision 575) and fluorescence produced from FITC staining falls into FL1 channel (Excitation 488/Emmision 519). Results can be analyzed by FlowJo.The performer should be familiar with FlowJo software to analyze 4-color flow cytometry data. Briefly, open the flow cytometry data in FlowJo software. First, plot FSC and SSC in X-axis and Y-axis. Then gate single live cells. Finally plot FITC and PE in X-axis and Y-axis of the single live cells.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150215/20150215171200_1659.jpg Figure 1.

Preparation of Cycling Xenopus Extracts\nNOTE: The overall procedure of preparing the extracts is illustrated in Figure 1A. Adapted from Murray 19911.\nInject three mature female Xenopus laevis with 66 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) 10 days before laying eggs.\nInject these Xenopus frogs with 500 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to induce egg laying 18 hours before the preparation of cycling extracts.\nDiscard laid eggs overnight. Based on experiments (data not shown), extracts prepared from the freshly squeezed eggs generate longer-lasting activities than extracts prepared from laid eggs from the same female frog. Squeeze the eggs of each female frog into 100 mm Petri dishes containing 10 mL of 0.2x MMR buffer and inspect under a stereo microscope.\nDiscard the batches of eggs that have unclear boundaries between animal and vegetal poles or have irregular white spots on top of animal poles.Choose the batch of eggs from one female frog presenting a homogeneous population of eggs with clearly differentiated animal and vegetal poles and transfer the eggs into a 600 mL beaker.\nPour out excess 0.2x MMR buffer and gently add 250 mL of 2 g per 100 mL cysteine (pH 7.7) in 1x extract buffer (100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 50 mM sucrose, pH 7.7) to eggs.\nShake the eggs vigorously by hand and remove the jelly coats of eggs over three washes with a total volume of 800 mL of cysteine buffer for 3 minutes or until eggs aggregate and settle at the bottom of the beaker, indicating that jelly coat removal is successful.\nWash eggs with 1 L of 0.2x MMR solution over four times.\nPick and discard eggs that turn white using a glass transfer pipette.\nPour out the MMR buffer and supply eggs with 200 mL of 0.1 \u00b5g/mL calcium ionophore A23187 solution in 0.2x MMR buffer for activation.\nUse the wide opening side of a glass pipette to stir the eggs gently until the eggs are activated and remove calcium ionophore solution.\nCheck the activation efficiency after eggs settle down at the bottom of the beaker. Well-activated eggs have approximately 25% of the animal pole and 75% of the vegetal pole.\nWash the activated eggs twice with 50 mL of 1x extract buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 \u00b5g/mL each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin).\nCarefully transfer eggs to a 0.4 mL snap-cap microtube and then pack eggs through centrifugation at 200 x g for 60 seconds, and then 600 x g for 30 seconds.\nRemove extra buffer on the top of eggs using a glass Pasteur pipette to reduce the dilution of extracts.Crush eggs at 15,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0C.\nCut the tubes with a razor blade to separate three layers of crushed eggs and keep the crude cytoplasm in the middle layer.\nTransfer the crude cytoplasm into new ultracentrifuge tubes, and supplement with protease inhibitors and cytochalasin B at 10 \u00b5g/mL each.\nCentrifuge the crude cytoplasm again at 15,000 x g at 4\u00b0 C for 5 minutes to further purify cytoplasm by removing excess lipid and yolk.\nKeep freshly prepared extracts on ice.\n3. Droplet Generation\n2D glass chamber preparation\n\tNOTE: The rectangle glass tubes serve as chambers that confine the droplets in a single 2-dimensional plane, allowing for easier observation and data collection.\n\t\nCut rectangle glass tubes with an inner dimension of 2 mm x 100 \u00b5m into 4 mm long pieces. Use the sharp edge of a whetstone, mark the desired boundaries on the outer surface of the glass tube with light etchings, then gently apply pressure on both sides of the etchings to break off pieces of glass tubes.\nPre-heat a dry bath incubator to 95 \u00b0C. Take out the heating block and place it into a polycarbonate vacuum desiccator.\nPlace a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 30 \u00b5L of trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane in the heating block. Lay the cut glass tubes inside the vacuum desiccator at approximately 5 cm to the heating block.\nConnect the desiccator to a vacuum pump. Turn on the pump for 1 minute to reach the desired vacuum level, then close the 3-way valve to seal the desiccator and let the trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane vapor coat the inner wall of the glass tubes. This will create a hydrophobic environment for stabilizing the droplets.\nLeave the glass tubes inside the desiccator for overnight coating. The tubes will be ready for use the next day.Droplet generation and imaging\n\tNOTE: The procedures of generating droplets and imaging are illustrated in Figures 1B and 1C.\n\t\nSupply extracts prepared in step 2 with 10 ng/\u00b5L securin-mCherry mRNA for the simple cytoplasmic-only cell cycle experiments. Alternatively, supply extracts with demembranated sperm chromatin (250 per \u00b5L of extract), 10 \u00b5M GFP-NLS protein, and 10 ng/\u00b5L securin-mCherry mRNA to create droplets exhibiting periodic nuclei morphology changes.\nIn a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, mix 20 \u00b5L of extract supplied with recombinant protein or mRNA with 200 \u00b5L of 2% perfluoropolyether-polyethylene glycol (PFPE-PEG) fluorosurfactant in HFE7500 fluorinated oil.\nGenerate droplets using a vortex mixer. The range of droplet sizes can be modulated by vortex speed and duration. To create droplets with radii ranging from 50 to 200 \u00b5m, set the vortex speed at 56 x g (3,200 rpm with a radius of 4.9 mm) and gently press the microcentrifuge tube containing the extract and surfactant mixture on the mixer for 3.5 seconds. Visually inspect if the droplets are uniform in size.\nUse a 20 \u00b5L pipette to transfer the droplets floating on top and an equal volume of PFPE-PEG surfactant into a PCR tube. Dip the glass tube prepared from step into the droplet layer in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and wait until droplets have filled approximately 75% of the tube, then push the tube down into the surfactant layer until the tube is completely filled. This will lower the droplet density and allow the droplets to form one single layer inside the chamber without overlapping or shape distortion caused by overcrowding.\nFill a glass bottom dish with a diameter of 40 mm with mineral oil. Immerse the droplet-filled tubes in oil by gently pushing them down using a fine tweezer.After loading all samples, use a glass pipette to remove any visible debris or leaked droplets. Add more mineral oil if the tubes are not or will not be completely immersed in the imaging process.\nConduct imaging of droplets on an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a motorized x-y stage (see Table of Materials). Use a 4X air objective for all imaging. For fluorescence imaging, use a 130 W mercury vapor short arc lamp as fluorescence light source for illumination, and a GFP filter set (excitation 482/35 nm and emission 514/LP nm) and an mCherry filter set (excitation 562/40 nm and emission 641/75 nm) for imaging GFP-NLS and securin-mCherry signals.\nRecord time-lapse videos in the bright field and multiple fluorescence channels every 6 to 9 minutes until the droplets lose their activity.\n4. Image Processing and Data Analysis\nSegmentation and tracking of droplets\nImport recorded data in the format of \".tif\" or \".oif\" into image analysis software (see Table of Materials).\nSegment single droplets using the bright field channel. The bright field image will show droplets as bright circles with dark boundaries. Apply thresholding to the image. Add a tracking surface to each droplet by tuning the threshold between dark and bright pixels so that each surface covers the whole area of the corresponding droplet.\nAutomatically track the segments between adjacent frames using the autoregressive motion algorithm. Tune the acceptable maximum traveling distance of a droplet between two adjacent frames to be smaller than the radius of most droplets to accurately track small droplets.\nVisually check all tracks across the entire video to detect incorrect segmentations that segment the empty space between droplets instead of actual droplets. Manually delete incorrect tracks.Segment and track background area without any droplets to obtain the background fluorescence intensity. To improve signal to noise, subtract background intensity from the fluorescence intensity of droplets at each time frame.\nExport measured parameters for each track over time, including the mean and standard deviation of the fluorescence intensity and the droplet area into \".csv\" files.\nData analysis of droplet size and oscillation period\nLoad the \".csv\" files into R to create plots of fluorescence intensity over time for each droplet. Record droplet ID into a \".csv\" file.\nImport the \".csv\" files exported from the analysis software and the \".csv\" file with a list of droplet ID into Matlab and save as \".mat\" files for further data analysis.\nCalculate the volume of a compressed droplet based on the exported droplet area information after segmentation and the height of glass chamber19. Use the volume to calculate the radius of droplet as a sphere.\nExtract the time points of peaks and troughs using peak/trough detection algorithm. Perform manual corrections on the position of peaks and troughs to ensure they are accurately detected.\nTo calculate the cell-cycle period, calculate the interval time between two adjacent peaks. Take the average of all intervals for each droplet as its cell-cycle period.\nSubscription Required.

Pour 200 \u00b5l of liquid \u00bd MS in the hole left by the removal of the agar block.Carefully align up to 4 seedlings in the Lab-Tek\u00ae observation chamber.Put back the cube of \u00bd MS-agar-FM4-64 on top of the seedling(s), chasing air bubbles manually (gently using a gloved fingertip).Place the sample under a microscope. Locate the first root tip by direct bright field observation under the microscope.Go to step B8.Automated imaging of growing Arabidopsis roots expressing fluorescent proteins (see Naramoto et al., 2015; Aki and Umeda, 2016 for detailed alternatives procedure)Under the sterile hood, pour 3 ml of pre-heated \u00bd MS-0.8% agar in the observation chamber and let it cool down.Use the scalpel to cut a squared area of agar (20 x 24 mm) from one side to the other of the chamber, and as wide as a coverslip.Use a coverslip to remove the piece of agar from the observation chamber and keep it aside for later use (see step B5).Pour 200 \u00b5l of liquid \u00bd MS in the hole left by the removal of the agar block.Carefully align up to 4 seedlings in the observation chamber.Gently put back the cube of \u00bd MS-0.8% agar-FM4-64 on top of the seedling(s). Whole small/young seedlings can be positioned between the agar block and the bottom of the chamber. For longer/older seedlings, only the root system can be positioned between the agar and the bottom, with the aerial part of the seedling rising out of the agar. Chase air bubbles manually, gently using a gloved fingertip.Leave the plants to grow in their new environment, with an inclination of \u00b1 70\u00b0 of angle, in a growth chamber overnight, so that seedlings acclimate to the observation chamber and keep growing.Place the sample under a microscope. Locate the first root tip by bright field observation under the microscope.In Metamorph, use the menu \u2018Apps\u2019 > \u2018Multi Dimensional Acquisition\u2019 (MDA).In the \u2018Main\u2019 tab, choose the dimensions \u2018Timelapse\u2019, \u2018Multiple Stage Positions\u2019, \u2018Multiple Wavelengths\u2019 (even if you have only one position and/or one channel) and \u2018Run journals\u2019.

Considerations for the experimental designCells are fixed at 3 different stages in the viral entry process: (i) after virion binding at 4 \u00b0C, (ii) after cell entry at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and (iii) after cell entry at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. For each of these conditions, a separate tissue culture plate is used.At least 6 wells should be infected for each experimental condition (virus, treatment, antibody etc.).On each plate, at least 6 wells should be left uninfected in order to determine the background signal for each virus-specific monoclonal antibody.If the assay is used to study the entry process of viruses pretreated with neutralizing antibodies, it might be necessary to use IgG subclass-specific secondary antibodies in order to avoid binding of the secondary antibody to the neutralizing antibody (Glauser et al., 2012a).Part II. Experimental procedure Day 1Passage and seed cellsGrow NMuMG cells in a 150 cm2 tissue culture flask until they form a 90-100% confluent monolayer. One 150 cm2 tissue culture flask yields approximately 2-3 x 107 cells, the experiment described below requires 6 x 106 cells. Wash cells 1x with 10 ml sterile PBS, then overlay with 5 ml Trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. Detach the cells by hitting the flask, then add 15 ml complete medium. Re-suspend cells by pipetting up and down, centrifuge 3 min at 350 x g at 4 \u00b0C and discard the supernatant. Re-suspend cells in 10 ml fresh complete medium, mix a small aliquot 1:1 with trypan blue and count with hemocytometer. Seed cells into 96-well tissue culture plates (20,000 cells in 100 \u00b5l complete medium/well) and incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C.Day 2Binding of virus to cells (work in 4 \u00b0C cold room)Dilute virus (MOI of 5 PFU or 15 eGFP units/cell) in complete medium (83 \u00b5l/well) in 5 ml Bijoux tubes.Pre-cool the 96-well tissue culture plates containing the cells and the tubes containing the diluted viruses for 1 h on ice at 4 \u00b0C.Gently tap off the cell medium and overlay cells with 83 \u00b5l/well diluted viruses or complete medium (uninfected controls), incubate for 2 h on ice at 4 \u00b0C.Gently wash the cells 3x with ice-cold PBS (approximately 300 \u00b5l/well).Fixation of cells after cell binding at 4 \u00b0CTake one plate and overlay the cells with ice-cold PBS containing 4% formaldehyde (100 \u00b5l/well), incubate for 1 h at room temperature (RT).In order to stop the fixation, gently tap off the fixative and incubate the cells with PBS containing 0.1 M glycine (100 \u00b5l/well) for 15 min at RT.Wash the cells 3x with PBS (approximately 300 \u00b5l/well).Permeabilize the cells by incubation with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X100 (100 \u00b5l/well) for 30 min at RT.Block the cells by overnight incubation with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% BSA (100 \u00b5l/well) at 4 \u00b0C.Fixation of cells after cell entry at 37 \u00b0CTake the remaining two plates and overlay the cells with ice-cold complete medium (83 \u00b5l/well), then incubate one plate for 1 h and the other for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C.\u00a0Wash the cells 1x with ice-cold PBS (approximately 300 \u00b5l/well), then fix and treat as described in steps C1-5.Day 3Detection of virions by ELISARemark: For the primary antibodies use a concentration which gives a strong signal in immunofluorescence (IF). In our experience, hybridoma supernatants diluted 1:2 give good signals in IF and ELISA. Dilute primary antibodies (hybridoma supernatants) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% BSA, add to cells (50 \u00b5l/well) and incubate 3 h at RT. Wash cells 3x with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (approximately 300 \u00b5l/well).Centrifuge secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase conjugate) for 10 min at 16,000 x g in a cooled tabletop microfuge (4 \u00b0C) to remove any potential antibody aggregates.Dilute secondary antibody 1:1,000 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% BSA, add to cells (100 \u00b5l/well) and incubate 3 h at RT.Wash cells 6x with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (approximately 300 \u00b5l/well).Dilute p-nitrophenyl phosphate in H2O according to manufacturer's instructions, add to cells (100 \u00b5l/well) and incubate overnight at RT and protected from light.Measure absorbance at 405 nm on an ELISA microplate reader. If the microplate reader can measure at a reference wavelenght, use 650 nm.Part III. Data interpretationThe absorbance values should not be considered an absolute measure of virion antigenicity, instead they should only be used to compare the antigenicity of virions between the different stages of virus entry, i.e., virus binding at 4 \u00b0C and virus entry at 37 \u00b0C for 1 or 2 h.The absorbance signal which is measured on uninfected cells can be considered the background signal of the respective monoclonal antibody and can be subtracted from the absorbance values measured on infected cells (for an example, see Figure 1A-B).If the aim of the experiment is to compare the virion antigenicity of a single virus at different entry stages, the absolute absorbance values can be shown (Glauser et al., 2012b).If the aim of the experiment is to compare the entry kinetics of different virus mutants (Glauser et al., 2013), the absorbance values for each virus mutant should be normalized to the values measured after virion binding at 4 \u00b0C (for an example, see Figure 1C).If the aim of the experiment is to compare the effect of different neutralizing antibodies on virus entry (Glauser et al., 2012a), the absorbance values for each virus-antibody combination should be normalized to the values measured after virion binding at 4 \u00b0C, because virus neutralization can either increase or decrease cell binding.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140510/20140510073303_4854.jpgFigure 1. Wild-type, mutant 1, mutant 2, and mutant 1 revertant MuHV-4 (MOI 15 eGFP units/cell) were bound to NMuMG cells for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. After 3 washes with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound virions, the cells were either fixed directly or after further incubations at 37 \u00b0C to allow virion endocytosis. The cells were then incubated with mAb BN-1A7 recognizing the pre-fusion conformation of MuHV-4 glycoprotein B and bound antibody detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and incubation with p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate. The bars show mean values from 6 wells \u00b1 standard error of the mean. (A) Mean absorbance readings at 405 nm (raw data). (B) The signal measured on uninfected cells was taken as background and subtracted from the signals measured on the infected cells. (C) After subtraction of the background signal, all values were normalized to the values measured after virus binding at 4 \u00b0C. This allows better comparison of the entry kinetics different virus mutants.", "As shown in Figure 4A, stand up the platform for instillation on the bench.   Anesthetize mice with 50 to 75 \u03bcl of ketamine/xylazine mixture by s.c. injection into the back.   As shown in Figure 4B, hang anesthetized mice on the platform by their incisors.   Take 50 \u03bcl of prepared alum suspension into an injector for instillation. In general, 50 \u03bcl of suspension (containing 50-100 \u03bcg of alum or 50-500 \u03bcg other particulates you want to inject, such as silica or nickel oxide) is the maximum volume for injection into the lungs.   As shown in Figure 4C, use a spatula as a tongue depressor and insert injector into the throat, check the trachea (in order to find the trachea easily, put out mouse\u2019s tongue using spatula and injector, first). It is difficult to check the trachea when young mice are used for the experiment. Because aged male mice are bigger, they are easier to find the trachea especially for training. Then, slowly drop suspensions of alum toward trachea. Dropped suspensions are aspirated into the lungs by breathing (aspiration method).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115193745_6384.jpg Figure 4. Administration into the lungs    Intranasal administration (i.n.) is also effective for administration into the lung. As shown in Figure 5, hold anesthetized mice and drop 30 \u03bcl (15 \u03bcl in each nostril) of suspensions of particulates into the nose. Dropped suspensions are also aspirated by breathing. In general, it is known that i.n. administration of 30 \u03bcl of solution reaches the lung.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115193850_2800.jpg Figure 5. Intranasal administration", "Expression of A2AR in insect cellsHuman A2AR, which was truncated to remove the flexible C-terminus (see Note 1) and contained the N154A mutation to remove a potential N-linked glycosylation site, was cloned into the transfer vector pBacPAK8, and baculoviruses were prepared using the flashBAC ULTRA system, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The A2AR construct contained a C-terminal 10x histidine tag to facilitate purification (see Note 2) and a TEV protease cleavage site to allow removal of the histidine tag (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170415/20170415004959_4532.jpgFigure 1. A2AR baculovirus expression construct. A2AR was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBacPAK8 using BamHI and NotI restriction sites (underlined), and baculoviruses were prepared using the flashBAC ULTRA system. The construct consists of residues 1-308 of human A2AR followed by a TEV protease cleavage site (highlighted in green) and C-terminal 10x histidine tag (highlighted in red). A2AR contains the N154A mutation (highlighted in yellow) to remove a potential N-linked glycosylation site. Start and stop codons are shown in bold.Dilute T. ni cells (grown in ESF921 serum-free media) to 2,730 ml in a 5 L optimum growth flask at a density of 1 x 106 cells/ml, and incubate overnight at 27 \u00b0C, shaking at 124 rpm.Once the density reaches 3.3 x 106 cells/ml, add 150 ml of fetal bovine serum (final concentration of 5% v/v) and 120 ml of passage three A2AR baculovirus (final concentration of 4% v/v).Incubate for 65-72 h at 27 \u00b0C, shaking at 124 rpm.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.Resuspend the cell pellet to a final volume of 180 ml in buffer A, add 4 protease inhibitor tablets and PMSF to give a final concentration of 1 mM. Flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 \u00b0C.Insect cell membrane preparationA crude membrane preparation is performed, which retains all insoluble intracellular components, whilst removing soluble proteins. This type of membrane preparation helps to limit the loss of membrane fragments and maximise the recovery of A2AR. This protocol describes the membrane preparation from three liters of insect cell culture, which is sufficient for one A2AR purification. However, if necessary, two batches (six liters of culture in total) can be processed simultaneously using a single Ti45 ultracentrifuge rotor.Thaw the cell pellet from 3 L of insect cell culture in a water bath at room temperature.Add fresh PMSF to give a final concentration of 1 mM, transfer the solution to three Ti45 tubes and centrifuge at 158,000 x g (45,000 rpm) in a Ti45 rotor for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. Make sure the tubes are filled correctly (to the neck), top up with buffer A if necessary. (see Note 3)Carefully remove the supernatant until level with the top of the pellet using a serological pipette (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170415/20170415010331_2735.jpgFigure 2. Illustration of the membrane pellet after ultracentrifugation. A diffuse layer, which contains a significant amount of A2AR, is observed on the surface of the membrane pellet after ultracentrifugation. It is important not to decant the supernatant, because this will remove the diffuse layer, resulting to a decreased yield of A2AR. Instead, the supernatant should be carefully aspirated using a serological pipette until level with the top of the membrane pellet (indicate by the dashed line).Add 25 ml of buffer A to each tube and break the pellet up into small pieces using plastic spatula.Homogenise the pellet using an ULTRA-TURRAX T25 homogeniser operating at 10,000 rpm until no lumps remain. This should take approximately 30 sec per tube.Top up the tubes with buffer A and centrifuge at 158,000 x g (45,000 rpm) in a Ti45 rotor for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. (see Note 3)Remove the supernatant until level with the top of the pellet using a serological pipette (see Figure 2).Resuspend the pellet with the buffer that remains in the tubes using a plastic spatula followed by an ULTRA-TURRAX T25 homogeniser. Do not exceed a final volume of 160 ml. Aliquot the membrane suspension into 50 ml tubes, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 \u00b0C. Membranes can be stored under these conditions for up to three months.Purification of A2ARA2AR is purified in decylmaltoside (DM), in the presence of the agonist NECA, using a protocol adapted from a previously described method for the purification of a thermostabilised A2AR construct (Lebon et al., 2011a and 2011b; Tate and Lebon, 2015). DM must be used if the complex is to be later exchanged into short chain detergents for vapour diffusion crystallisation. This protocol typically yields 3-6 mg of pure A2AR from 3 L of insect cell culture.Thaw the membranes from 3 L of insect cell culture in a water bath at room temperature.Add 4 protease inhibitor tablets, and NECA (100 \u03bcM), imidazole (10 mM), PMSF (1 mM), and NaCl (300 mM) to give the final concentrations indicated, stir slowly at room temperature for 30 min using a magnetic stirring bar to allow agonist binding.Cool the membrane suspension to 4 \u00b0C in an ice bath. Solubilise the membranes by adding DM to give a final concentration of 2% (w/v) while stirring rapidly using a magnetic stirring bar, continue to stir slowly for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.Transfer the solution to eight Ti70 tubes and centrifuge at 265,000 x g (60,000 rpm) in a Ti70 rotor for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C.Remove the supernatant and filter through a 0.2 \u03bcm Steritop filter unit. (see Note 4)Load the filtrate (~150 ml) onto a 5 ml Ni2+-NTA Superflow column (pre-equilibrated with buffer B) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at 4 \u00b0C, using a peristaltic pump. The filtrate should be kept on ice during loading.Wash the column with 100 ml of buffer C at a flow rate of 5 ml/min at 4 \u00b0C.Elute the column with 20 ml of buffer D at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at 4 \u00b0C, collecting a single 20 ml fraction.Concentrate the eluate to 5 ml using an Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator (50 kDa molecular weight cut-off) in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge at 4 \u00b0C. (see Note 5)Exchange the concentrated protein into buffer E using two PD-10 desalting columns (load 2.5 ml onto each column). (see Note 6)Add TEV protease to give a TEV:A2AR ratio of approximately 1:3 (w/w), incubate overnight on ice. Add 2 ml of Ni2+-NTA agarose resin (pre-equilibrated with buffer E), mix on a roller mixer for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.Pour the suspension onto 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA agarose resin (pre-equilibrated with buffer E) packed into a disposable plastic column and let it run through by gravity.Collect the flow through and wash the column with 2 x 3 ml of buffer E.Pool the wash with the flow through and concentrate to 0.2 ml using an Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator (50 kDa cut-off) in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge at 4 \u00b0C.Centrifuge the concentrated protein at 135,000 x g (55,000 rpm) in a TLA55 rotor using a benchtop ultracentrifuge for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove aggregates.Load the supernatant onto a Superdex 200 GL 10/300 gel filtration column, (pre-equilibrated with buffer E) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min at 4 \u00b0C, collecting 0.5 ml fractions.Pool peak fractions (typically 3-4 ml) based on the gel filtration chromatogram. (see Note 7)Concentrate the pooled fractions to 0.2 ml using an Amicon Ultra-4 concentrator (50 kDa cut-off) in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge at 4 \u00b0C.Determine the protein concentration using the amido black assay (Schaffner and Weissmann, 1973). (see Note 8)If required, purified A2AR can be aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. (see Note 9)\u00a0Crystallisation of the A2AR\u2013mini-Gs complexThe A2AR\u2013mini-Gs complex is first prepared in DM, once the complex is formed it is stable enough to be exchanged into octylthioglucoside (OTG) for vapour diffusion crystallisation trials. A detailed protocol for the expression and purification of mini-Gs is provided in a companion manuscript (Carpenter and Tate, 2017).Aliquot 2 mg of A2AR into a microcentrifuge tube and add a 1.2-fold molar excess of mini-Gs construct 414 (1.8 mg). Adjust the volume to 0.2 ml with buffer E, add MgCl2 to give a final concentration of 1 mM and add 0.1 units of apyrase. Incubate for 3-16 h on ice. (see Note 10)Start the detergent exchange (from DM to OTG) by diluting the complex 1:10 in buffer F, and re-concentrating to 0.2 ml using an Amicon Ultra-4 concentrator (50 kDa cut-off) in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge at 4 \u00b0C.Centrifuge the concentrated protein at 55,000 rpm (135,000 x g) in a TLA55 rotor using a benchtop ultracentrifuge for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove aggregates.Complete the detergent exchange by loading the supernatant onto a Superdex 200 GL 10/300 gel filtration column (pre-equilibrated with buffer F) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 \u00b0C, collecting 0.5 ml fractions.Pool peak fractions (typically 2-3 ml) based on the gel filtration chromatogram (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170415/20170415011624_3061.jpgFigure 3. SDS-PAGE and gel filtration analysis of the A2AR purification. A and B. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purification of a representative A2AR construct. Despite having molecular weights of 35 and 27 kDa respectively, A2AR and mini-Gs414 migrate at an identical rate on the SDS-PAGE gel, making visualisation of the complex difficult. Therefore, for demonstration purposes, we show SDS-PAGE gels of an A2AR construct that contains an N-terminal thioredoxin fusion (TrxA-A2AR), which increases its molecular weight to 46 kDa. TrxA-A2AR was purified in DM using an identical protocol to that described for A2AR, however, the TrxA-A2AR\u2013mini-Gs complex, which was exchanged into OTG, did not yield crystals that diffracted to higher than 3.5 \u00c5 resolution. A. SDS-PAGE analysis of the TrxA-A2AR purification: (M) molecular weight markers; (1) Ni2+-NTA column loading material (1:10 dilution); (2) Ni2+-NTA column flow through (1:10 dilution); (3) Ni2+-NTA column wash; (4) Ni2+-NTA column eluate; (5) sample after concentration and buffer exchange; (6) sample after TEV digestion; (7) Ni2+-NTA negative purification flow through; (8) Ni2+-NTA negative purification eluate; (9) gel filtration pool. TEV protease is indicated by an asterisk. The samples should not be boiled prior to loading on the gel (see Note 11). B. SDS-PAGE analysis of the TrxA-A2AR\u2013mini-Gs414 complex after detergent exchange into OTG: (M) molecular weight markers; (1) gel filtration pool. C. Preparative gel filtration chromatogram for the A2AR\u2013mini-Gs414 complex in OTG, pooled fractions (typically 2-3 ml) are indicated by dashed lines. Note that the UV detector reaches saturation, which results in a truncated absorbance profile. D. A crystal of the A2AR\u2013mini-Gs414 complex mounted in a loop on beamline ID23-2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (the scale bar is 50 x 100 \u03bcm).Concentrate the pooled fractions to \u2265 20 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra-4 concentrator (50 kDa cut-off) in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge at 4 \u00b0C.Centrifuge the concentrated protein at 135,000 x g (55,000 rpm) in a TLA55 rotor using a benchtop ultracentrifuge for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove aggregates.Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and discard the pellet.Accurately determine the concentration of the complex using the amido black assay (Schaffner and Weissmann, 1973).Dilute the complex to 20 mg/ml and immediately set up crystallisation trials in 96-well sitting drop plates, dispensing 120 nl of protein and 120 nl of precipitant solution using a Mosquito crystallisation robot situated in a cold room at 4 \u00b0C. (see Note 12)The initial hit for the A2AR\u2013mini-Gs414 complex came from the MemGoldTM screen (0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5, 8.8% [w/v] PEG 2000 MME). The two crystals that were used for structure determination were grown in either: 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5, 10% (w/v) PEG 2000; or 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.7, 9.5% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME.Harvest the crystals in a cold room at 4 \u00b0C. Sequentially transfer the crystals between drops of mother liquor supplemented with increasing concentrations (10, 20, 30%) of the cryoprotectant PEG 400 (1 min in each solution), before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. (see Note 13)", "Medicago seed sterilization   Place the seeds in a 15 ml plastic falcon tube. Add 3 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid for 5-8 min with occasional mixing.

Move seeds to room temperature and incubate (in the dark) for 1 day to pre-germinate (1-1.5 cm root length).      Sinorhizobium strains   Sinorhizobium meliloti strains are grown in TY medium with 0.1 % initial inoculum to the exponential growth state (~ 2 days) at 30 \u00b0C, with shaking (200 rpm).   Centrifuge the culture at 8,000 x g for 10 min and wash once with sterile 0.85% NaCl.   The culture should be diluted to 107 cells/ml or an OD600 0.7 with sterile 0.85% NaCl.      Plant growth conditions and inoculation   Plant growth pouches should be wetted with water and sterilize at 121 \u00b0C for 15 min.   Add 2-4 pregerminated seedlings from the step A7 per pouch, with plant roots protruding through holes in the paper pouch tray.    Add 6 ml fahraeus medium.   Grow pouches in growth chamber at 25 \u00b0C with 16 h light conditions and 21 \u00b0C for 8 h dark conditions. Humidity should be between 50-70%. Light conditions should be 200-350 \u00b5mol/m2/s.   Cover the roots with aluminum foil and place pouches in a container.   Inoculate seedlings in pouches after 1 day with 1.0 ml of suspended culture immediately after step 10 using sterile pipette.Mark the location of the root tip on the surface of the growth pouch using a sharpie marker.      Nodule analysis   Examine pouches each day for the presence and number of nodules on each plant. Record the date when the first nodule formed and the number of nodules daily. Plot the number of plants nodulated (Y-axis) by days at the end of experiment.   After three weeks of growth remove the pouches from the growth chamber.   Count the nodules and measure the distance (in mm) that each nodule is relative to the root mark at the time of inoculation. Nodules above the root tip mark are designated as + mm and those below the root tip mark as - mm. Those at the root tip mark are designated as 0 mm. Plot the number of nodules (Y-axis) versus distance from root tip mark in a histogram. Those rhizobia with the majority of nodules above the root tip mark formed nodules earlier than those below the mark and are thought to be more competitive for nodulation.", "This protocol provides a method for efficient derivation of hiPSC-VSMCs through NC intermediates. It has previously proven robust and reproducible across multiple independent hiPSC lines (Halaidych et\u00a0al., 2019a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-bib-0012]; Vila Cuenca et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-bib-0030]). VSMC differentiation from hiPSCs is divided into three steps (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0001]). The first step is seeding and culture of hiPSCs followed by NC induction for 12 days (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0001]). The initial seeding density of hiPSCs is critical for the differentiation efficiency. NC formation is induced by combining the inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3, CHIR99021, to activate canonical WNT signaling with basic fibroblast growth factor and activin/nodal inhibitor SB431542. On day 12 (passage 0, P0), the differentiation efficiency can be assessed by flow cytometry analysis for reduced expression of the pluripotency marker SOX2 and increased expression of the NC marker CD271 (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0002]). The second step is the further differentiation and expansion of the hiPSC-NC cells (hiPSC-NCCs) from P0 to P3 for 8-11 days using the same (defined) medium used for differentiation. At P3, flow cytometry analysis should show a high total yield of CD271+ NC cells and high reproducibility across different lines and batches (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0001]). At this stage, the cells can be cryopreserved and thawed for further differentiation to VSMCs. The third step is VSMC induction for 12 days (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0001]). Both fresh and cryopreserved hiPSC-NCCs (P3) can be used to differentiate VSMCs. The initial seeding density of hiPSC-NCCs is important for a high differentiation yield. Differentiation to VSMCs is induced using PDGF-BB and TGF-\u03b23 for 12 days. Ideally, hiPSC-VSMCs are cryopreserved on day 8 of VSMC induction to make a large batch of cells from the same differentiation batch that can be used over long periods in multiple experiments.Cryopreserved vials can later be thawed for further differentiation until day 12 (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0003]) for use in functional assays and characterization (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0002]).<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1a949402-1422-4e1d-807c-140df39df98f/cpz1564-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nTimeline of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0001] and Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0002] with representative images at right.

Prewarm a vitronectin-coated 6-well suspension plate, or freshly coat two wells of a 6-well suspension plate with vitronectin (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0006]). Prewarm TeSR-E8 to room temperature.\n2. Before beginning cell dissociation, remove regions of spontaneous differentiation by scraping them off with a 200-\u03bcl pipet tip. Aspirate TeSR-E8 containing differentiated parts of the culture.\nSpontaneous differentiation can emerge in the edges of hiPSC colonies and can be identified by their heterogeneous morphology. Removing these regions is only necessary if it is >5% of the hiPSC colonies.\n3. Add 1 ml GCDR to each well of a fresh 6-well plate and incubate 3-6 min at room temperature.\nThe timing of GCDR dissociation varies depending on the hiPSC line/clone. Determine adequate incubation time by visual inspection. A prolonged dissociation time may lead to cell detachment.\n4. Aspirate the GCDR and add 1 ml TeSR-E8 to each plate well. Gently detach cell colonies by scraping them with a cell scraper.\n5. Transfer cell aggregates into a 15-ml tube using a 1000-\u00b5l pipet tip. Pipet up and down gently once or twice with a 1000-\u00b5l pipet tip to break up large aggregates.\nIt is critical to break up large pieces of colonies to increase their adherence and survival after seeding.\n6. Wash the vitronectin-coated 6-well plate (from step 1) with 1 ml Cell Adhere dilution buffer per well and then add 2 ml TeSR-E8.7. Add the small aggregates from step 5 to each well at a split ratio of 1:20-1:40. Move the plate in a cross-like pattern to distribute cells evenly, and place it the incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nIt is important to ensure that the cell suspension is well mixed in the tube. To do so, gently tap the bottom of the 15-ml tube before taking up the cell suspension from step 5.\n8. Refresh cells with 2 ml TeSR-E8 once a day starting 24 hr after passaging.\nA larger amount of TeSR-E8 can be added when the cells become relatively dense 5-6 days after passaging.\nPassaging of hiPSCs for NC differentiation (day \u20132)\nPassage hiPSCs when they reach 90% confluency, as with the passaging for maintenance above.\n9. Prewarm a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate, or freshly coat two wells of a 6-well plate (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0018]). Prewarm TeSR-E8 medium to room temperature.\n10. Dissociate hiPSC colonies as described in steps 3-5.\n11. Aspirate Matrigel and add 2 ml TeSR-E8 to each well of 6-well plate.\n12. Add 20-25 \u03bcl of cell suspension (step 10) to each well at a split ratio of 1:30-1:40. Distribute cells evenly by moving the plate in a cross-like pattern, and place it in the incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nThe seeding density of hiPSCs is important for their differentiation efficiency with low-density cultures showing more differentiation. When hiPSCs are dissociated from a partially confluent well, a lower split ratio (1:20) is recommended.\n13. Refresh each well with 2 ml TeSR-E8 after 24 hr (day \u20131).\nDifferentiation of hiPSC-NCCs (from day 0 to 12)\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Always prewarm medium to room temperature and add growth factors to the medium right before refreshing cells. Replace the cells in the 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator after refreshing.14. NC induction: 48 hr after passaging (step 12), aspirate TeSR-E8 medium and add 2 ml NC differentiation medium in each well of the 6-well plate (day 0).\nPrior to NC induction, using 20-30 colonies ranging from 200 to 400 \u00b5m in size on day 0 is expected to result in efficient differentiation.\n15. Refresh each well with 2 ml NC differentiation medium every 2 days until day 12.\nAt days 5-7, differentiated NCCs will start to migrate from the colony edges as a monolayer.\n16. Gently remove the cells in the centers of initial colonies by scraping them with a 200-\u03bcl pipet tip (day 8 or 9). This can be done under a stereomicroscope.\nAs more cells migrate, mechanical elimination of the cells in the center of the colonies improves the purification of a neural crest population. Representative images of a single colony center on day 8 are shown in Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0001] pointing to the site of elimination (day 8a), as well as showing the \u201cempty\u201d colony center after elimination (day 8b).\n17. After removing the cells in the center of the colonies, refresh each well with 2 ml NC differentiation medium (day 8 or 9). Refresh each well again 2 days after mechanical elimination (day 10 or 11).\n18. Passage the cells with a split ratio of 1:2 when they reach 80% confluency (day 12) for further differentiation and expansion following steps 19-25.\nThe yield of differentiation is expected to be 2-3 million hiPSC-NCCs in total on day 12 (P0). In this step, the differentiation efficiency of hiPSC-NCCs can be determined by flow cytometry (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0002]). More than 50% of hiPSC-NCCs should be CD271+ on day 12 (P0); lower percentages will result in less efficient expansion during later steps.Differentiation and expansion of hiPSC-NCCs P0\u2013P3 (from day 12 to day 20 or 23)\n19. Prewarm a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate, or freshly coat four wells of a 6-well plate (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0018]). Prewarm B(P)EL medium to room temperature and freshly add the growth factors to prepare NC differentiation medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0021]).\n20. Aspirate NC differentiation medium and add 2 ml DPBS to each well of a 6-well plate.\n21. Aspirate DPBS and add 0.5 ml TrypLE\u2122 to each well. Incubate for 3 min at room temperature.\n22. Add 1.5 ml of B(P)EL to each well to dilute TrypLE. Transfer cell suspension to a 15-ml tube using a 1000-\u00b5l pipet tip. Pipet up and down gently once or twice with a 1000-\u00b5l pipet tip to break up the cell aggregates.\n23. Centrifuge the tube 3 min at 300 \u00d7 g, room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.\n24. Resuspend the cell pellet in freshly prepared 8 ml NC differentiation medium.\n25. Aspirate Matrigel from four wells of 6-well plate and add 2 ml hiPSC-NCCs from step 24 to each well (for a split ratio of 1:2). Distribute the cells evenly by moving the plate in a cross-like pattern, and place it in the incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nThe cell monolayer is expected to be confluent in 3-4 days.\n26. Follow the same steps for passaging to P2 and to P3.\nAfter the first passage, cells start to proliferate more rapidly; therefore, the split ratio of passaging should be modified. For P2, use a split ratio of 1:4 or 1:5, and for P3, a split ratio of 1:5 or 1:6.\nThe yield of hiPSC-NCCs at P3 is expected to be 40-60 million cells total, with >90% being CD271+.Efficient induction of hiPSC-NCC differentiation can also be assessed by immunofluorescence staining and gene expression analysis (Halaidych et\u00a0al., 2019a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-bib-0012]). hiPSC-NCCs can be passaged up to P7.\nCryopreservation of hiPSC-NCCs P1-P3\nNOTE: It is best to cryopreserve hiPSC-NCCs at P1-P3 in order to create batches from the same differentiation.\n27. Prechill a Mr. FrostyTM Freezing Container to 4\u00b0C. Label cryovials and place on ice.\n28. Dissociate hiPSC-NCCs as described in steps 20-23.\n29. Resuspend the cell pellet in cold CryoStor\u00ae CS10 cryopreservation medium (1 ml per 20 cm2 growth surface). Transfer 500 \u00b5l of cell suspension to each cryovial (10 cm2 per cryovial).\nhiPSC-NCCs and CS10 cryopreservation medium should be kept on ice. Cryovials should be kept on ice during transferring the cells.\n30. Place all cryovials into a Mr. Frosty\u2122 Freezing Container and leave at \u221280\u00b0C for 24 hr. Transfer all cryovials into liquid nitrogen for prolonged storage.\nDifferentiation at the scale described in this protocol should yield 80-120 vials that can be cryopreserved at P3 (500,000 cells per vial).\nDifferentiation of VSMCs from hiPSC-NCCs in 12 days (days 0-12)\nNOTE: VSMC differentiation steps can be followed by using either a cryopreserved vial or fresh hiPSC-NCCs at P3 from step 26.\n31. On day \u20131, prewarm a 0.1% gelatin-coated 6-well plate, or freshly coat two wells of a 6-well plate. Prewarm B(P)EL medium to room temperature and add the growth factors to prepare NC or VSMC differentiation medium.\n32. If using cryopreserved hiPSC-NCCs, remove cryovial (P3) from liquid nitrogen and thaw in a water bath at 37\u00b0C until only a small ice crystal remains. Transfer the cells into a 15-ml tube containing 5 ml B(P)EL. Wash cryovial once with 1 ml B(P)EL to collect remaining cells.The thawing procedure should be performed as quickly as possible. Move the cryovial in the water bath in a circle to thaw. Pipet cells gently to reduce mechanical stress.\n33. Gently homogenize the cell suspension with a 5-ml pipet and take a small aliquot to use in counting cells. Centrifuge the 15-ml tube 3 min at 300 \u00d7 \u0261, room temperature. Aspirate supernatant.\n34. Resuspend the cell pellet in NC differentiation medium to reach 1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/ml.\n35. Aspirate gelatin from two wells of a 6-well plate and add 2 ml cell suspension to each well. Distribute the cells evenly by moving the plate in a cross-like pattern, and place it in the incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (day \u20131).\n36. At 24 hr after seeding, start VSMC differentiation. Refresh each well with 2 ml VSMC differentiation medium (day 0).\n24 hr after seeding (day 0), hiPSC-NCCs should have a density approximating that shown in Figure 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0001]. This is the optimal density to start VSMC differentiation.\n37. On day 2, refresh each well with 2 ml VSMC differentiation medium.\n38. Passage the cells at a split ratio of 1:4 (day 4). Prewarm 0.1% gelatin-coated 6-well suspension plates, or freshly coat eight wells.\n39. Aspirate VSMC differentiation medium and add 2 ml DPBS to each well of a 6-well plate.\n40. Aspirate DPBS and add 0.5 ml TrypLE\u2122 to each well. Incubate 3 min at room temperature.\n41. Add 1.5 ml B(P)EL to each well to dilute TrypLE\u2122. Transfer cell suspension to a 15-ml tube using a 1000-\u00b5l pipet tip. Pipet up and down gently once or twice with a 1000-\u00b5l pipet tip to dissociate the large aggregates.\n42. Centrifuge the tube 3 min at 300 \u00d7 g, room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.43. Resuspend the cell pellet in 16 ml VSMC differentiation medium.\n44. Aspirate gelatin from eight wells of 6-well suspension plates and add 2 ml cell suspension to each well (at a split ratio of 1:4). Distribute the cells evenly by moving the plates in a cross-like pattern, and place them in the incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.\n45. On day 6, refresh each well with 2 ml VSMC differentiation medium.\nIt is best to cryopreserve VSMCs on day 8 to make a batch of cells from the same differentiation for multiple experiments. Cryovials can be thawed and further differentiated in VSMC differentiation medium until day 12 (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0003], steps 1-6).\n46. Alternatively, on day 8, passage VSMCs as described in steps 39-44.\n47. On day 10, refresh each well with 2 ml VSMC differentiation medium.\nOn day 12, hiPSC-VSMCs are expected to be fully differentiated and ready for use in functional assays.\nCryopreservation of VSMCs (day 8)\n48. Prechill a Mr. FrostyTM Freezing Container to 4\u00b0C. Label cryovials from each differentiation and place on ice.\n49. Dissociate hiPSC-VSMCs as described in steps 39-42.\n50. Resuspend the cell pellet in cold CryoStor\u00ae CS10 cryopreservation medium to get a final concentration of 20 cm2/ml. Transfer 500 \u00b5l of cell suspension to each cryovial (10 cm2 per cryovial).\nhiPSC-VSMCs and CS10 cryopreservation medium should be kept on ice. Cryovials should be kept on ice during transfer of the cells.\n51. Place all cryovials in a Mr. Frosty\u2122 Freezing Container and leave at \u221280\u00b0C for 24 hr. Then transfer all cryovials into liquid nitrogen for prolonged storage.This protocol describes characterization of hiPSC-NCCs and hiPSC-VSMCs. On day 12 of NC induction (P0), the efficiency of differentiation can be determined through flow cytometry by assessing the expression of pluripotency markers (e.g., SOX2) and NC markers (e.g., CD271). More than 50% of the cells should be CD271+ NCCs. The analysis should be repeated at P3 (day 20 or 23), when the total CD271+ yield is expected to be higher (>90%) and the expression of SOX2 lower than at P0 (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0001]). hiPSC-NCCs at P3 can be cryopreserved and thawed for VSMC induction. On day 12 of VSMC induction, hiPSC-VSMCs are fully differentiated and ready for functional characterization. At this stage, hiPSC-VSMCs exhibit increased expression of contractile proteins calponin 1 (CNN1), \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA; ACTA2), and SM22 (TAGLN), which can be assessed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0001]).\nMaterials\nP3 hiPSC-NCCs (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0001], step 24)\nDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Life Technologies, cat. no. 14190)\nTrypLE\u2122 Express Enzyme (1\u00d7), no phenol red (Gibco\u2122; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 12604021)\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (FACSB; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0015])\nBD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences, cat. no. 554714)\nFluorescent-conjugated antibodies:\n               \nAnti-human CD271, BV421 conjugated (used at 1:100 dilution; BD Biosciences, cat. no. 562562)\nAnti-human SOX2, A488 conjugated (used at 1:50 dilution; eBiosciences, cat. no. 53-9811-80)\nDay 12 hiPSC-VSMCs (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0001], step 47, or Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0003], step 6)\nB(P)EL (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0003])\n4% (w/v) PFA (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0023])\n0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0030])\n1% (w/v) BSA in DPBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0004])\nPrimary antibodies:\n               \nAnti-human Calponin, Mouse (used at 1:200 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Resuspend the cells in 1 ml 1\u00d7 BD Perm/Wash\u2122 buffer.\n12. Analyze the samples by flow cytometry immediately or the next day.\nWe used the MACSQuant VYB flow cytometer with the following instrument settings: Blue/488 FITC, A488: 525/50; yellow/561 PE: 586/15; APC: 661/20; APC-Cy7: 750LP.

Seal the plates with Parafilm and store in the dark at 4\u00b0C until microscopic imaging.\nThe plates can be stored for prolonged periods in the cold and dark, although the highest quality images are obtained within 1-2 weeks.Vascular cells can be derived from hiPSCs using the protocols above and cryopreserved for further functional experiments. It is important to generate large batches of cells from the same differentiation for use in multiple VoC experiments. In this protocol, we describe how to prepare hiPSC vascular cells prior to VoC culture and functional assays. We previously described the cryopreservation of hiPSC-VSMCs on day 8 of differentiation. Cryopreserved hiPSC-VSMCs are thawed and cultured in VSMC differentiation medium for 4 days to reach the fully differentiated state (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]). Additionally, hiPSC-ECs are produced efficiently and cryopreserved in their fully differentiated state in large batches using the robust protocol we reported previously (Orlova et\u00a0al., 2014b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-bib-0019]). hiPSC-ECs are thawed and expanded in Endothelial Cell Complete Growth Medium (EC-CGM) for 4 days. Both cell types reach >90% confluency after 4 days and are then ready to be integrated in the collagen lumenized scaffolds created following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0004].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a56992a2-260d-4bd9-beb9-0376ab174e12/cpz1564-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2Timeline of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0004] and Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0003] with representative images at right.

Refresh the cells with EC-CGM (day 3).\nOn day 4 of expansion, hiPSC-ECs should be >90% confluent with a yield of 250,000-300,000 cells per well.This protocol describes the generation of 3D-engineered vessels composed of hiPSC-ECs and hiPSC-VSMCs inside a PDMS microfluidic chip. The protocol is divided into three steps (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]). The first step is fabricating the devices by casting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone elastomer on a customized SU-8 master mold using soft lithography. The master mold serves as a template to generate four straight microfluidic channels with fixed dimensions 0.5 mm (w) \u00d7 0.5 mm (h) \u00d7 10 mm (l) (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002] and 2I[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]). After curing, PDMS is carefully peeled off, single devices are cut out, and the inlet/outlet ports of the microchannels are punched using biopsy puncher (1.2 mm) (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002], II[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]). To achieve watertight microfluidic channels, single devices are contact bonded with PDMS-coated coverslips and then treated with air plasma. Subsequently, the PDMS surface is functionalized by polydopamine (PDA) to promote the binding of collagen type I. The second step is patterning the lumens inside the collagen type I in the microfluidic channels using viscous finger patterning (VFP; de Graaf et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-bib-0008]), which is illustrated in Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0003]. The success rate of the second step is >95% if the details outlined in the Critical Parameters are applied exactly. If necessary, 3D collagen scaffolds can be imaged at this point and analyzed using two-photon second-harmonic generation (2P-SHG; Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002], III[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002], and IV[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]). The last step is the sequential seeding of hiPSC-derived vascular cells into the collagen I lumen scaffolds, illustrated in Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0003]. hiPSC-VSMCs and hiPSC-ECs are prepared as described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0003] (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]) and subsequently seeded by injecting the cells into the lumen via the inlet port (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002], I[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]-III[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]). After each seeding step, the devices are slowly rotated to promote even coverage of the lumen scaffold.On day 1, a confluent hiPSC-EC monolayer is formed that is surrounded by abluminal hiPSC-VSMCs (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002], IV[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]). Functional assays can be performed on day 2 or 3 after cell seeding. Continuous and controlled perfusion can be done upon connection to the microfluidic pumps. Structural analysis in 3D is performed following Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0005], which reveals cell-cell interactions in 3D (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0004]).

Mix PDMS elastomer base and curing agent thoroughly in a 10:1 ratio and degas in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature.\n2. Pour uncured PDMS mixture onto the SU-8 master mold to a thickness of \u223c5 mm.\n3. Degas the PDMS until air bubbles are completely removed. Cure overnight in oven at 80\u00b0C.\n4. Coat the cover glasses with a thin layer of PDMS using a spin-coater (5 s at 1000 rpm, 30 s at 4000 rpm). Cure for at least 3 hr at 80\u00b0C.\n5. Cool the mold to room temperature. Remove PDMS carefully in a direction parallel to the microchannels.\n6. Cut out the individual chips using razor blades. Punch inlet and outlet ports at the opposite ends of the microchannels using a 1.2-mm biopsy punch. Clean the PDMS surface with 3M Scotch\u00ae tape and store dust-free.\nDust particles should be cleaned before contact bonding of PDMS.\n7. Place PDMS device (channel side up) and spin-coated cover glass (coated side up) in a vacuum plasma system. Treat the surfaces with air-plasma for 45 s at 50 W, 50 kHz.\n8. Immediately bond the air-plasma-treated surfaces by pressing gently and evenly with fingers. Avoid breaking the cover glass.\nOptionally, the devices can be placed in the 80\u00b0C oven shortly to enhance the bonding. However, heat accelerates the hydrophobic recovery of the PDMS. The equipment and settings indicated in this protocol are sufficient to create a permanent contact bonding; enhancement by heating is not necessary.\nAssembled devices can be stored dry and dust-free for up to 3 months at room temperature.\nSurface functionalization of the microfluidic channels to promote attachment of collagen I (day \u20132 or earlier)9. Inject 10 \u00b5l PDA solution into the microchannels. Incubate 1 hr at room temperature. Wash the microchannels thoroughly with dH2O in a Petri dish. Dry completely using pressured nitrogen-gas flow.\nThe PDA solution darkens in color over time. A lack of color change might indicate ineffective reaction. If incubated for too long, PDA can hinder the optical transparency of PDMS.\nPartially wet channels will fail to efficiently attach to the collagen gel.\n10. Sterilize the devices in CoolClave Ozone+UV chamber using the \u201cUV\u201d setting (30 min). The devices can be stored dry and in the dark up to 1 week at room temperature.\nPatterning of collagen I lumens using VFP technique (day \u20131)\nNOTE: Follow aseptic techniques under sterile laminar hood. Use sterilized microfluidic devices and pipet tips.\n11. Place 5 ml EGM-2 medium in a slightly opened 15-ml tube in the incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for at least 2 hr.\nEquilibrating the medium and devices inside the incubator prevents air bubbles emerging due to temperature differences.\n12. Insert a cut 10-\u03bcl pipet tip (7 mm) into the outlet port and an uncut 10-\u03bcl pipet tip into the inlet port of the microchannel. Press the tips lightly until they reach the coverslip.\n13. Prepare 5 mg/ml collagen I solution, pH \u223c7.4 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0008] ).Mix thoroughly until a homogeneous pink color is attained, indicating a near-neutral pH of \u223c7.4 (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002] and 2I[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0002]). The color of the solution is the indication of pH, as 10\u00d7 M199, a solution component, is supplemented with phenol red. Care should be taken in this step, as the pH defines mechanical property of collagen fibers and is crucial for cell viability. This procedure is reproducible given that adequate quantities of the reagents were used and were well mixed. Final solutions in the alkaline range, pH > 7.5 (purple in color), should be discarded. If the final solution is in acidic range, pH < 7.4 (yellow in color), pH can be adjusted to \u223c7.4 (pink in color) by slowly adding droplet(s) of 1 M NaOH.\nIf using collagen I stock solution from a different manufacturer, follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n14. Spin down the collagen solution for 10 s to remove air bubbles. Immediately place the solution back on ice. Take up the collagen solution in a prechilled 1-ml syringe with a plastic needle.\n15. Immediately inject the collagen solution steadily into the microchannels via the uncut 10-\u03bcl pipet tip (inlet) until a meniscus forms on the cut 10-\u03bcl pipet tip (outlet). Add a 3-\u00b5l droplet of DPBS on top of the collagen I meniscus (outlet). Place the devices in the incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 30 min to allow collagen polymerization.\nThis step should be performed as quickly as possible. Limit the number of microchannels to pattern in each round and discard the collagen gel after 5 min. The yield of patterning drops dramatically when the same collagen gel is used for a long time.We recommend using a multi-dispenser pipet to pattern several lumens at the same time. This way 24 microchannels can be patterned within 5 min. Alternatively, manual pipetting can be used and 12 channels can be patterned within 5 min.\n16. Add 50 \u00b5l equilibrated EGM-2 on top of the polymerized collagen via the uncut 10-\u03bcl pipet tip (inlet). Place the devices in the incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\n17. The next day, carefully remove the cut 10-\u03bcl pipet tip from the outlet port in a smooth twisting motion using blunt-tip forceps.\nIt is critical to remove the tips gently in a twisting motion to prevent the deformation of the patterned lumens.\n18. Insert a medium reservoir (cut 1000-\u03bcl pipet tip) into the outlet port, and add 20 \u00b5l of equilibrated EGM-2 to the medium reservoir using gel-load filter tips.\nCheck the ports of microchannels for air bubbles, which might emerge after removal of cut 10-\u03bcl pipet tips. Remove the air bubbles with gel-load filter tips as illustrated in Figure 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0003], II[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0003].\n19. Remove the uncut 10-\u03bcl pipet tip from the inlet port in a smooth twisting motion using blunt-tip forceps.\n20. Insert a medium reservoir into the inlet port and proceed to cell seeding.\nIt is advisable to use the patterned lumens for cell seeding the next day. Alternatively, the patterned lumens can be kept inside the incubator for up to 3 days before cell seeding.\nSeeding cells in 3D lumen scaffolds (day 0)\nIn the following steps, the confluent monolayers of hiPSC-VSMCs (from Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0003]; step 6) and hiPSC-ECs (from Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0003]; step 12) are dissociated sequentially.21. Prewarm B(P)EL and EC-SFM to room temperature. Place 5 ml EGM-2 in a slightly opened 15-ml tube in the incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and incubate at least 2 hr.\n22. Dissociate the monolayer of hiPSC-VSMCs in 6-well plate as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0001], steps 39-42.\n23. Resuspend the cell pellet in EGM-2 to obtain 2 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. Pipet the cell suspension up and down gently once or twice with a 200-\u00b5l pipet tip before injecting into each lumen.\nEnsure that the cell suspension is well mixed to achieve a consistent cell density between channels.\n24. Take up 10 \u00b5l of cell suspension in a 10-\u00b5l pipet tip. Insert the tip into the outlet medium reservoir with a light pressure.\n25. Inject the cell suspension slowly and steadily until equal levels are reached across medium reservoirs and flow stops.\nEnsure that there is no air trapped inside the pipet tip, as the collagen scaffold can be deformed by injection of air bubbles. See Figure 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0003] illustrating how to inject the cell suspension correctly via medium reservoirs (I), and the examples of poor handling practice causing injection of air bubbles (III and IV).\n26. Place the devices on a cell culture rotator (channel longitudinal axis in line with rotating axis). Rotate the devices for 1 hr at 1 rpm in the incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\n27. Add 25 \u00b5l EGM-2 to the outlet medium reservoir and 50 \u00b5l EGM-2 to the inlet medium reservoir.\n28. Dissociate hiPSC-ECs in 6-well plates from Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0003], step 12. Aspirate EC-CGM and add 2 ml DPBS to each well.\n29. Aspirate DPBS and add 0.5 ml TrypLE\u2122 to each well. Incubate 3 min at room temperature.30. Add 1.5 ml of EC-SFM to each well to dilute TrypLE\u2122. Transfer cell suspension to a 15-ml tube using a 1000-\u00b5l pipet tip. Pipet up and down gently once or twice.\n31. Count the cells and centrifuge 3 min at 1100 rpm (300 \u00d7 g) at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant.\n32. Resuspend the cell pellet in EGM-2 supplemented with 50 ng/ml VEGF to reach 1 \u00d7 107 cells/ml. Pipet the cell suspension up and down gently once or twice with a 200-\u00b5l pipet tip before injecting into each lumen.\nThe initial seeding density of ECs is critical for generating a confluent vessel barrier. Lower cell density results in gaps in the barrier (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0003], II[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0003] and IV[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-fig-0003]).\n33. Remove any excess medium from medium reservoirs using a 10-\u00b5l pipet tip. Leave \u223c10 \u00b5l medium in the reservoir to avoid injecting air bubbles.\n34. Take up 5 \u00b5l of hiPSC-EC suspension in a 10-\u00b5l pipet tip. Insert the tip into the outlet medium reservoir with a light pressure.\n35. Inject the cell suspension into microchannels as described in step 25.\n36. Place the devices on a cell culture rotator (channel longitudinal axis in line with rotating axis). Rotate the devices for 4 hr at 1 rpm inside the 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n37. Add 25 \u00b5l EGM-2 supplemented with 50 ng/ml VEGF to the outlet medium reservoir and 50 \u00b5l to the inlet medium reservoir to create transient gravity-driven flow (day 0).\nRefresh the vessel lumens daily with EGM-2. The vessels can be used for functional assays or fixed on day 2 or 3.38. Remove 30 \u00b5l EGM-2 from each reservoir with 200-\u00b5l pipet tip. Add 25 \u00b5l EGM-2 to the outlet medium reservoir and 50 \u00b5l to the inlet medium reservoir to create transient gravity-driven flow (days 1-3).3D-engineered vessels generated following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0004] can be characterized on day 2 or 3. Here we describe the structural characterization of the 3D vessels using immunofluorescence staining. The fixed vessels are first permeabilized for intracellular staining followed by blocking for at least 1 hr to avoid nonspecific binding of the primary antibody. In this protocol, we use primary antibodies against VE-cadherin to visualize the EC cell junctions, and against contractile protein SM22 to visualize VSMC cell morphology. The secondary antibodies should be selected considering the host and target species of primary antibodies. The selection of specific fluorophores can vary between users and dilutions should be derived from manufacturer's recommendations. The stained 3D vessels are compatible with high-resolution imaging using advanced microscopy.\nNOTE: Always follow the same sequence for adding solutions into the vessel lumens (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0004], step 38).\nMaterials\n3D-engineered vessels (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-prot-0004])\n4% (w/v) PFA (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0023])\n0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in DPBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0006])\n1% (w/v) BSA in DPBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.564#cpz1564-rec-0004])\nDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Life Technologies, cat. no. 14190)\nPrimary antibodies:\n               \nAnti-human VE-cadherin, Rabbit, 1:200 (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 2158S)\nAnti-human SM22 (TAGLIN/Transgelin), Rabbit, 1:200 (Abcam, cat. no.

Wash the lumens three times with DPBS, 15 min per wash, at room temperature. Store the devices at 4\u00b0C in a Parafilm-sealed Petri dish in the dark until microscopic imaging.\nThe devices can be stored for prolonged periods in the dark and cold, although the highest-quality images can be obtained within the first 1-2 weeks.

It is good practice to know which stamp came from a particular patterned glass wafer so that you can make additional stamps from the best ones.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if you know a stamp works well, you can avoid using other stamps and focus on the one that yields high quality patterns.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Creating the Gelatin Carrier: </strong></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a 20% w/v solution of Gelatin type A by dissolving in ddH2O at 40\u00baC or appropriate aqueous solution.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aqueous buffer for the carrier can be changed according to the cells of tissue the NMBS will be applied to.

No 70327-10).</p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the carrier will be determined by the size of punch that is used for the mold. This can be tuned per experimental needs. In most cases a 1 cm diameter mold is more than large enough, and often a 5 mm diameter mold is sufficient.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the gelatin solution warm at 40\u00baC to prevent it from gelling.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place a silicone mold onto an ethanol cleaned glass slide.

Problems with transfer can arise if the gelatin carrier was not flat. Having the gelatin slightly overfill the mold can cause the carrier to have a slight convex shape allowing for easier release of the coverslip. Too little gelatin will result in a concave shape that make coverslip release from the gelatin very difficult.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following transfer, remove all remaining water surrounding the NMBS-gelatin carrier.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is too much water left on the gelatin it will not transfer well to the tissue; however, you do not want the gelatin to dehydrate prior to transferring the tissue.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Store the gelatin carrier in a sealed container at 4\u00b0C until ready for tissue application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Transferring the NMBS to Cells or Tissue:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the patterned fibronectin mesh, nanomechanical biosensor (NMBS) is transferred to the gelatin carrier, the gelatin carrier can then be used to apply the NMBS to tissue or cells.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the media from the cells or tissue that the NMBS will be applied to.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all of the media needs to be removed, but the more the better, without causing the tissue to dry out during the process.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly lift the NMBS-gelatin carrier from the glass slide using forceps.

To both ensure clonal outgrowth and ensure sufficient exposure, the compound/exposure is titrated to a level resulting in 40%\u201360% lower cell expansion (approximating IC50) after 3\u20134\u00a0days compared to cells treated with the appropriate solvent control. The compound/exposure is incubated with the cells for 72\u00a0h to allow replication and incorporation of DNA mutations.\nNote: In addition to chemical compounds, such as genotoxic drugs, the assay can easily be modified to study the mutagenic effects of other external exposures, such as radiation. This exposure needs to be administered after 24\u00a0h of recovery at step 1. This time point is chosen to ensure cells have been recovered and can undergo division cycles in the next 72 h, to fix the mutation in the genome.

For the control condition, add the same volume of the dissolvent (PBS/DMSO).\nPlace the plate back in the incubator for 72 h.\nAfter 72 h, transfer cell suspension to a conical 15\u00a0mL tube and pellet cells by spinning down at 350\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C.\nAspirate supernatant, resuspend in 1\u00a0mL FACS buffer and transfer to a 1.5\u00a0mL microtube.Count cells using 0.4% trypan blue and a hemacytometer and use the resulting cell counts from the unexposed control to count relative survival for all exposure concentrations.\nUse these relative survival values to calculate a dose-response curve using the R package \u2018drc\u2019, and extract IC40 and IC60 concentrations. Format the input data, named in this example surv_table, using the following structure:\n> surv_table\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concentration_nM\u00a0\u00a0Relative_survival\n1\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01\n2\u00a0\u00a010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00.448\n3\u00a0\u00a033\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00.344\n> Dr.m\u00a0= drm(formula\u00a0= Relative_survival \u223c Concentration_nM,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0data\u00a0= d_r, fct\u00a0= LL.4(names\u00a0= c(\"Hill slope\",\"Min\", \"Max\", \"EC50\")))\nExtract from the Dr.m object the IC40 and IC60 values.\n> drc::maED(object\u00a0= DR.m, fctList\u00a0= list(LL.4()),c(40,60))\nCritical: If already one exposure concentration is within the IC40-IC60 interval, this sample can be used to proceed with for single cell CB-HSPC sorting in steps 30\u201338.

These CB-HSPCs are sorted as single cells using fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). For a representative example of the gating strategy employed see Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1627-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03.

This gate is the gate that is used to single cell sort CB-HSPCs.\nPrepare FACS buffer and keep on ice.\nPellet cells by spinning down at 350\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C.\nPrepare 50\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00d7 HSPC staining mixture according to the recipe provided.\nNote: The total volume is distributed between the conditions to take along for HSPC sorting. As a rule of thumb, for approximately 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells, 10\u201320\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00d7 HSPC staining mixture is needed.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in an equal volume of FACS buffer and 2\u00d7 HSPC mixture.\nIncubate for 1\u00a0h on ice in the dark.\nPrepare a 384-well-plate with 75\u00a0\u03bcL HSPC Complete medium per well, except the outer wells. One half of a 384-well plate is required for one condition (genotoxin concentration). This should result in at least 8 clonal expansions, which is sufficient for downstream sequencing analyses (see introductory note step 6, Variant calling and filtering).\nNote: Fill all outer wells with 75\u00a0\u03bcL PBS or MilliQ water to prevent evaporation of the HSPC Complete medium in the inner wells.\nSort single cell HSPCs with the gates set for single cells Lin-CD34+CD38-CD45RA- according to the following steps:\nNote: Sorting equipment may vary on facility availability. In all our experiments, we have made use of a Sony SH800S cell sorter using a 100\u00a0\u03bcM filter chip, sorting at a maximal speed of 2,000 events/second.\nFirst, exclude non-cell events by setting a \u2018cells\u2019 gate including all larger elements (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nSecond, sort only single cells by removing all cells with a larger forward-scatter-area (FSC-A) compared to forward-scatter-height (FSC-H) (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).Set a gate for all FITC unmarked Lin- cells (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) to exclude differentiated cell types.\nSet a gate for CD34+ cells (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, vertical bar).\nOptional: A distinction can be made between CD90+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and CD90- multipotent progenitors (MPPs), which is indicated by the upper and lower gates.\nGate for CB-HSPCs by setting a gate for CD38- CD45RA- cells (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) and sort these cells in a 384-well plate.\nWrap the 384 well culture plate (with lid) in transparent polyethylene wrap and directly transfer to a humidified, 37\u00b0C, hypoxic (5% O2) incubator with 5% CO2.\nAllow single cells to expand clonally for 4\u20135\u00a0weeks.\nPause point: Clonal expansion till confluency typically takes 4\u20135\u00a0weeks. During this time, plates can be inspected (once/twice a week) to keep track of the clonal outgrowth using a light microscope.\nHarvesting HSPC clones, DNA extraction and WGS\nTiming: 1\u00a0day of preparatory work; 1\u00a0week sequencing\nIn this step, expanded HSPC clones are harvested, and sequenced, which have expanded sufficiently during 4\u20135 to allow for enough DNA to perform WGS. Clones to be harvested should cover at least 50%, see example of a fully confluent HPSC clonal expansion in Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1627-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. CB-HSPC clonal outgrowth\nCenter of a single well from a 384 well-plate containing a 100% confluent clonal expansion after 4\u00a0weeks. Scale bar indicates 100\u00a0\u03bcm.\nNote: To enable filtering for patient-specific germline mutations, sequencing DNA from at least three CB-HSPC clones from the same donor is required.\nTo prevent cells sticking to the pipette tip, which reduces DNA yield, coat the tip of the pipet with cold HSPC harvesting buffer by pipetting HSPC harvesting buffer up and down.Fiercely pipet up and down the medium in the well with a pipet set at 75\u00a0\u03bcL and collect the cell suspension in a labeled 1.5\u00a0mL DNA LoBind microtube.\nRinse the well with 75\u00a0\u03bcL of cold HSPC harvesting buffer.\nNote: Make sure to scratch the bottom surface of the well, including the corners. As cells may stick to the bottom of the well, check under the microscope to make sure you have collected all cells present in the well.\nPellet cells by spinning down at 350\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 8\u00b0C and remove the supernatant.\nPause point: The pellet can be stored frozen at \u221220\u00b0C for at least 6\u00a0months. Freeze cells within 1\u00a0h after harvesting.\nIsolate DNA using the Qiagen QIAmp DNA Micro kit following the \u201cPurification of genomic DNA from cultured cells using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit\u201d User-developed protocol (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-dna-kits/?catno=56304[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-dna-kits/?catno=56304]) using the following adjustments:\nAdd 2\u00a0\u03bcL of RNase A after addition of buffer AL, incubate for 2\u00a0min before adding proteinase\u00a0K.\nIncubate for 30\u00a0min at 56\u00b0C instead of 10\u00a0min.\nElute the DNA by loading the column with 50\u00a0\u03bcL of Low TE buffer, reload the eluate on the column and spin again for optimal yield.\nDetermine the DNA concentration using Qubit using 1\u00a0\u03bcL eluted DNA for each clone. The expected yield varies between 0.5 to 3\u00a0ng/\u03bcL. The minimal recommended DNA yield to proceed for whole genome sequencing is 1\u00a0ng/\u03bcL.\nUse at least 25\u00a0ng (50\u00a0ng recommended when available) of genomic DNA and construct whole genome libraries using a Truseq Nano kit, using a 500\u00a0bp insert size. For full instructions, see the TruSeq\u00ae Nano DNA Library Prep Reference Guide by Illumina.Sequence each library on an Illumina Nextseq or Novaseq 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0bp to an average coverage depth of 15\u00d7.\nVariant calling and variant filtration\nTiming: 1\u00a0week\nFor reliable downstream mutation analyses, a true positive rate for somatic variants of\u00a0>\u00a090% is required. Our approach implements the GATK best practices for data pre-processing and genotyping using the GATK HaplotypeCaller (NF-IAP), after which variants are extensively filtered using a python-based filtering scripts (SMuRF). Alternative somatic variant calling pipelines and filtering strategies may be used when yielding a sufficient fraction (> 90%) of true somatic variants.\nCritical: The number of germline variants present in the genome of a typical CB-HSPC far exceeds the number of somatic mutations, even after genotoxic exposure. To ensure filtering of all germline variants, WGS data from the same cord blood donor must be used within each NF-IAP and SMuRF run.\nPerform BWA read mapping, quality control, GATK variant calling, variant filtering and variant annotation using the NF-IAP pipeline.\nFirst, configure the run.config file, provided as a template template_run.config. setting the folder containing all FASTQ files at \u2018fastq_path\u2019.\nFrom /path/to/output/donorX/NF_IAP/, run:\n$ nextflow run /path/to/scripts/NF-IAP/nf-iap.nf \\\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$\u00a0\u00a0-c {run.config} \\\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$\u00a0\u00a0--out_dir $PWD -profile slurm\nNext, perform further variant filtering and annotation using SMuRF to obtain high-quality somatic mutations. From/path/to/output/donorX/SMuRF/, run:\nNote: To filter out additional recurrent artefacts, filtering using a mutation blacklist is recommended.

Flowchart of the procedure to detach the retina from the eye semi-cup with the MR incubation. Prepare the eye semi-cup for incubationOperations from step A2 on must be carried out at room temperature, in a dark room in dim red light (lower than 10 lux, 620 nm red lighting), to avoid rhodopsin bleaching. This facilitates the detachment of the photoreceptor OS from the RPE.Obtain freshly enucleated bovine eyes from a slaughterhouse and use them within 2 h of animal death. The age of the cattle from which the eyes can be obtained for scientific purposes may be limited (as is the case in Italy) to 1.5 years, as a cautionary measure for the risk of possible transmission of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). Eyes must be kept warm, in a light-tight container, possibly a Dewar flask, and handled to minimize the temperature decline.Remove extraocular tissues with scissors.Gently separate the anterior segment and vitreous from the eye semi-cup containing the neural retina. Make an incision in the sclera with a scalpel on one side of the eyeball, then hemi-sect the eye using scissors, approximately at the level of the ora serrata. Remove the anterior chamber, the lens, and vitreous carefully and discard them.Detach the retina with MR incubation (Figure 3)Fill the eye semi-cup containing the retina still attached to the RPE with 5\u20137 mL (depending on the size of the eye) of sterile filtered MR containing 2 mM glucose, protease inhibitor cocktail, and Ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/mL). All the operations, including incubations, are conducted at room temperature. The surface for dissection is routinely an aluminum foil.Incubate each eye semi-cup for 10\u201315 min to allow the retina to detach completely. Eyes should be dissected and incubated with MR in rapid sequence.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4474/bioprotoc-12-14-4474-g003.jpgFigure 3.

A concentration of 20 \u00b5M corresponds to 4x the concentration necessary for maximum CCR5 induction.Low CD4 induction medium (Low CD4/High CCR5): Mix equal volumes of 4x Pon A and DMEM-F10/B (=2x Pon A and 0x Doxy).High CD4 induction medium (High CD4/High CCR5): Mix equal volumes of 4x Pon A and 4x Doxy (=2x Pon A and 2x Doxy).Induce cells for infection.Remove 50 \u00b5l of medium from each well of the 96-well plate.For each virus being tested, add 50 \u00b5l of low CD4 induction medium to 3 wells (=1x Pon A and 0x Doxy) and 50 \u00b5l of High CD4 induction medium to 3 wells (=1x Pon A and 1x Doxy).Incubate cells at 37 \u00b0C.Induce cells for flow cytometry.Remove all medium from the 24 well plate, replace with 750 \u00b5l of warm DMEM-F10/B and 250 \u00b5l of either 4x Doxy or 4x Pon A (=1x desired amount of Pon A or Doxy). \u00a0Incubate cells at 37 \u00b0C.Day 3Infect cells 18-24 h after adding drugs (Pon A and Doxy).Remove induction medium from wells and immediately replace with 50 \u00b5l of warm DMEM-D10/B.Warm plate centrifuge to 37 \u00b0C.Thaw pseudovirus stock and dilute in DMEM-D10/B so that 50 \u00b5l of diluted virus produces a desired signal when titered on Affinofile cells expressing maximum CD4 and CCR5. This is determined by pre-titering the virus to ensure the amount of virus added is within the linear dose-response curve for the readout (in this case luciferase) and many fold above the assay background. As an additional control, include a dilution curve of a high titer virus to ensure all signals are within the linear range.Add 50 \u00b5l of diluted virus to each well of a 96-well plate (3 High CD4 wells and 3 Low CD4 wells per virus).Centrifuge plates at 2,000 rpm (849 x g) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C (spinoculation; O'Doherty et al., 2000).Incubate cells at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h.Prepare cells for flow cytometry.Remove medium from a well of a 24 well plate, then use 1 ml of cold PBS to harvest the cells from that well and store the cells in eppendorf tubes on ice until all wells are harvested.Centrifuge the harvested cells in a table top microcentrifuge at 4 \u00b0C at 2,600 rpm for 10 min. \u00a0While centrifuging, make staining solutions (Recipe 5).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Resuspend the cells in 50 \u00b5l of staining solution and stain at room temperature, in the dark, for 60 min.Add, with gentle mixing, 1 ml of fresh fixing solution (Recipe 6).Centrifuge in cold room at 2,600 rpm for 10 min, dispose of supernatant. Resuspend cells in 1 ml PBS. Centrifuge in cold room at 2,600 rpm for 10 min. \u00a0Resuspend cells in 300 \u00b5l PBS.Store in the dark at 4 \u00b0C until ready to analyze.Analyze cells and QuantiBRITE beads using flow cytometer equipped with a 405 nm laser and a filter that measures emissions at approximately 526 nm and a 488 nm laser with a filter that measures emissions at approximately 578 nm.Use Quantibrite beads, with their four known levels of PE, to determine the relationship between mean fluorescence and number of PE molecules (Figure 1). This relationship can be used to translate the PE fluorescence of stained cells into mean number of CD4 or CCR5 antibody binding sites (ABS) per cell. This method requires that cells be stained with saturating levels of antibody and assumes that each antibody is conjugated to a single PE molecule.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140717/20140717000155_7471.jpgFigure 1. QuantiBRITE beads are used to quantify the relationship between PE fluorescence and number of PE molecules attached to a bead/cell. A) QuantiBRITE beads are analyzed by flow cytometry to calculate the mean, log PE fluorescence of the four bead populations, each conjugated to a different, known number of PE molecules. B) The relationship between log (PE molecules / bead) and log (log PE) is then determined. This relationship can then be used to translate the mean PE fluorescence of stained cells into the mean number of CD4 or CCR5 antibody binding sites (ABS) per cell.Day 5Harvest infected cells 48 h after infection.Remove medium from wells.Gently rinse 2x with warm PBS, discard PBS after each wash.Add 50 \u00b5l of 1x Reporter Lysis Buffer and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.Seal plates with aluminum foil covers and freeze at -80 \u00b0C for at least 2 h.Thaw plates and Luciferase Assay System reagent at room temperature.Prepare Luciferase Assay reagents following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, and read plate using a plate-reading luminometer.Calculate percent infectivity at low CD4 relative to infectivity at high CD4 for each individual virus.For continuous CD4 comparisonMacrophage-tropism can also be assessed by infecting Affinofile cells expressing a wide range of CD4 densities (Joseph et al., 2014). CD4 usage curves reveal that, relative to T cell-tropic viruses, macrophage-tropic viruses are significantly better at infecting cells expressing low levels of CD4, reach 50% infectivity at lower CD4 levels (CD4 ED50) and often approach a plateau level of infectivity at a lower CD4 density (Figure 2; Joseph et al., 2014).\u00a0 This procedure is identical to the or \u2018Procedure for High Versus Low CD4 Comparison\u2019 (part A above)\u00a0 except that cells are induced to express 10 levels of CD4 and 30 wells of a 96-well plate are needed to test each virus (10 CD4 levels x 3 replicates per level).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140717/20140717000442_9794.jpgFigure 2. Dose-response curves for infectivity of a macrophage-tropic virus (Ba-L) and a T cell-tropic viruses (JRCSF) to Affinofile cells expressing various densities of CD4. The sensitivity of pseudotyped viruses to CD4 levels was assessed by measuring their ability to infect Affinofile cells expressing 10 CD4 levels (1,425, 4,590, 4,981, 9,374, 22,667, 33,842, 46,204, 58,153, 69,897, and 81,649 CD4 ABS per cell), with CCR5 fully induced. In this assay, the vast majority of blood-derived viruses have an infectivity profile similar to that of JRCSF ( Ping et al., 2013).Day 2Prepare media for continuous CD4 comparison.Dilute Doxycycline stock to 24 ng/ml in DMEM-F10/B. Serially dilute Doxycycline to the following concentrations:\u00a0 6, 4, 2.8, 2, 1.2, 0.8, 0.4, 0.28 ng/ml.Dilute Ponasterone A stock to 20 \u00b5M in DMEM-F10/B.

Media Preparation\nPrepare 293T medium: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 10% (v/v) FBS, L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), penicillin/streptomycin (1x).\nPrepare MEF medium: DMEM, 10% (v/v) FBS, L-glutamine (2 mM), 1x non-essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin (1x).\nPrepare TS medium (w/o FGF4/heparin): Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) 1640, 20% (v/v) FBS (stem cell culture grade), penicillin/streptomycin (1x), L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM).\nPrepare TS medium with FGF4/heparin (TS + F4H): RPMI 1640, 20% (v/v) FBS (stem cell culture grade), penicillin/streptomycin (1x), L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM), 25 ng/ml FGF4, 1 \u00b5g/ml heparin.\n\tNote: FGF4 and heparin are added directly into the media immediately prior to use.\nPrepare TS-CM with FGF4/heparin (TS-CM + F4H): 70% MEF-conditioned TS medium + 30% freshly prepared TS medium + 25 ng/ml FGF4, 1 \u00b5g/ml heparin.\n\tNote: FGF4 and heparin are added directly into the media immediately prior to use.\nPrepare Transfection medium: Advanced DMEM, 2% (v/v) FBS (stem cell culture grade), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin/streptomycin (1x).\nPrepare Virus-production medium: Advanced DMEM, 5% (v/v) FBS (stem cell culture grade), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin/streptomycin (1x).\n2. Murine Embryonic Fibroblast Derivation\nSet timed matings using wt 129S2SV females and homozygous male R26::rtTA mice (strain name; B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(rtTA*M2)Jae/J 7). On E13.5 sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation and isolate primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) according to standard protocols8. Thereafter, plate cells from one embryo on a 150 mm dish in MEF media.Once primary MEF cultures reach confluency on 150 mm dishes, wash cells twice with 10 ml PBS and add 4 ml 0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution. Incubate dishes for 3 - 4 min in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C.\nAfter incubation check if cells detached from the dish using an inverted microscope (using a 10X lens). Add 5 ml of MEF media to stop trypsinization and collect cell suspension into a 50 ml conical tube.\nPool cell suspension from several dishes and collect into a 50 ml conical tube. Centrifuge cell suspension for 3 min at 200 x g and 10 \u00b0C.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in FBS containing 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Freeze MEFs in aliquots for further use.\n\tNote: Alternatively, use wild type primary MEFs; however, an additional lentiviral vector expressing rtTA needs to be transduced together with the other lentiviral vectors (for example using the FUdeltaGW-rtTA plasmid described by Maherali et al. 9).\nPreparation of MEF-conditioned TS medium\n\tNote: Prior to conversion experiments, MEF-conditioned (CM) TS media has to be prepared, which is required for subculture of individual iTSC lines (described in section 6).\n\t\nPlate 1 x 107 mitotically inactivated MEFs per 150 mm dish in MEF medium on desired number of dishes. Inactivate MEFs by \u03b3-irradiation with a dose of 9 Gy.\n\t\tNote: The yield per 150 mm dish is approximately 60 ml of CM.\nThe day after plating, aspirate and discard MEF medium and add 20 ml freshly prepared TS medium (without FGF4/heparin) onto each dish of mitotically inactivated MEFs and place dishes back into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C.After incubating TS medium for three days on mitotically inactivated MEFs, collect medium in 50 ml conical tubes. Filter medium through a 0.2 \u00b5m filter and proceed with 2.6.4. Replace CM with 20 ml of fresh TS medium for preparation of a further batch of CM.\n\t\tNote: Mitotically inactivated MEFs can be used for CM preparation up to three times.\nAliquot 35 ml of filtered CM into 50 ml conical tubes and store at -20 \u00b0C until needed. After thawing, add 15 ml of freshly prepared TS medium in order to obtain 70% TS-CM and store at 4 \u00b0C for up to one month.\n3. Lentiviral Vector Production in 293T Cells\nNote: All steps are carried out in laboratory space licensed to Biosafety Level 2.\nPrior to conversion experiments, prepare lentiviral vectors for the doxycycline (dox) dependent over-expression of Tfap2c, Gata3, Eomes, Ets2 and mCherry. For each lentivirus, co-transfect 293T cells using the respective lentiviral transfer vector together with a packaging plasmid and a VSV-G expressing envelope plasmid (for plasmid information refer to the Materials Table).\n\tNote: For helpful information regarding virus production refer to Gavrilescu et al.10. Although it describes retrovirus production, general comments regarding quality of 293T cells and plasmid DNA are true for lentivirus production as well.\n\tCAUTION: Appropriate safety measures need to be taken, when working with lentiviral vectors and work has to be performed in a Biosafety Level 2 facility.\nCoat five 100 mm dishes with poly-L-lysine (100 \u00b5g/ml) solution by covering the dishes with 5 ml of solution and gently rocking to evenly distribute coating solution. Place the dishes back into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. After 30 min aspirate coating solution and rinse dishes once with PBS.Plate 7 x 106 293T cells per dish in 10 ml 293T-cell media, swirl dishes to evenly distribute cells and place dishes back into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C.\nThe next morning, replace growth medium with 5 ml of transfection medium. Add 6 \u00b5l of a 1,000x stock of chloroquine solution (25 mM) and place dishes back into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C.\nMeanwhile, prepare transfection mixture:\nFor each lentiviral vector prepare two 5 ml reaction tubes, labeled A and B.\nAdd 600 \u00b5l of 2x HEPES buffered saline (HBS) to tube A.\nIn tube B mix 61.5 \u00b5l CaCl2 solution (2 M), with 18.5 \u00b5g lentivector DNA and 9.25 \u00b5g psPAX2 and 9.25 \u00b5g of pMD2.G. Adjust volume to 600 \u00b5l with sterile culture grade H2O.\nAdd solution from tube B drop-wise to tube A while vortexing. Incubate transfection mixture for 15 min at RT.\nAdd transfection mixture very carefully drop wise to the prepared 293T cells on the 100 mm dish. After 5 to 6 hr remove medium and replace with 10 ml of virus-production medium. Place dishes back into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C.\n\tNote: Be careful when removing and replacing medium since 293T cells easily detach from the dish. Medium change 5-6 hr after transfection is crucial, since prolonged exposure to chloroquine is toxic to the cells.\nThe following morning, carefully remove and discard medium and replace with 7 ml of virus-production medium.\nThe following morning harvest the first batch of virus-containing medium. Aspirate medium and collect in a 15 ml conical tube. Again, add 7 ml of virus-production medium onto the cells. Store virus-containing medium in the fridge until the second batch is harvested the following day.The next morning aspirate the second batch of virus-containing medium adding it to the 15 ml conical tube containing the first batch. 293T cells can now be discarded. Filter virus-containing medium through a 0.45 \u00b5m surfactant-free cellulose acetate -membrane filter. Aliquot filtered, virus-containing medium and store at -80 \u00b0C for further use.\n\tNote: Virus production can also be performed in 6-well dishes. Scale down volumes and cell numbers accordingly.\n4. Fibroblast Transduction with 4 Factors and mCherry Control Vector\nNote: All steps are carried out in a Biosafety Level 2 facility.\nFor a schematic representation of the experimental outline refer to Figure 1. Thaw one aliquot of primary rtTA-MEFs and plate 3.33 x 105 cells per well of a 6-well dish in a total volume of 2 ml of MEF media. Prepare at least 3 wells and label them with 4 factors (4F), mCherry and control.\n\tNote: Alternatively, wild type MEFs can be used, when an rtTA expressing lentiviral vector is added to the lentivector cocktail during step 4.2.\nThe following day after cells fully recovered from cryopreservation, replace MEF media in the three 6-wells with 0.6 ml (4F), 0.9 ml (mCherry) and 1 ml (control) of Transduction media, respectively. Thaw one aliquot of pLV-tetO-Tfap2c, -Gata3, -Eomes, -Ets and -mCherry virus at RT and add 100 \u00b5l of each virus-containing supernatant (Tfap2c, Gata3, Eomes, Ets2) into the 4F well.\n\tNote: In case of wild type MEFs, reduce volume of preplated media by 100 \u00b5l and additionally add 100 \u00b5l of FUdeltaGW-rtTA virus containing supernatant to the 4F mix.\nAdd 100 \u00b5l of mCherry virus-containing media to the well labeled with mCherry. Add polybrene to a final concentration of 8 \u00b5g/ml into each well. Place the dish back into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C and incubate MEFs O/N with virus-containing supernatant.Note: In case of wild type MEFs, reduce volume of preplated media by 100 \u00b5l and additionally add 100 \u00b5l of FUdeltaGW-rtTA virus-containing supernatant.\nThe next morning, carefully remove virus-containing media and wash three times with 2 ml of PBS. Finally, add 2 ml of TS media (without FGF4/heparin).\n\tNote: Transduced MEFs can either be directly used for iTSC induction experiments or frozen for further use.\n5. Fibroblast to iTSC Conversion\nNote: All steps are carried out in laboratory space licensed to Biosafety Level 2.\nWash transduced MEFs twice with 2 ml PBS and after adding 0.5 ml trypsin/EDTA solution incubate them in the incubator for 3 - 4 min. Check under an inverted microscope for proper detachment of the cells.\n\t\nInactivate trypsin by adding 1 ml TS medium. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 200 x g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 2 ml TS medium. Use the untransduced control sample to count the cells.\nPlate 4F-MEFs, mCherry-MEFs and untransduced control MEFs each at a density of 2 x 105 cells per 100 mm cell culture dish in 10 ml TS medium containing 2 \u00b5g/ml dox (TS medium + FGF4/heparin + dox).\nAlternatively, perform transdifferentiation on smaller dishes. Plate 3.6 x 103 cells per cm2 on desired dish size, scale volume accordingly.\nThe next day, using an epifluorescence microscope (using a 10X\u00a0lens and a filter suitable for red fluorescence excitation) monitor expression of mCherry protein in order to estimate transduction efficiency.\n\tNote: Transduction efficiency should be close to 100%. If increased cell death is apparent after transgene induction this means that virus titer was too high. Transduction should be repeated with reduced amount of virus-containing medium.From now on change media on all dishes every other day until day 10 after plating. Thereafter, feed cells with TS medium without dox (TS medium + FGF4/heparin).\nUsing an inverted microscope monitor for appearance of 'transdifferentiated areas' (refer to Figure 2B and C) on 4F dish for up to 3 weeks. Such colonies should not be visible on the two control dishes (mCherry-MEFs and untransduced MEFs).\n6. Isolation of Individual iTSC Lines\nNote: For step 6.3 a tissue culture hood is not required. It is recommended to wipe down the inverted microscope with 70% ethanol to minimize the chances of bacterial contamination. Individual iTSC colonies can be isolated between days 21 and 28 days of transdifferentiation.\nAdd 40 \u00b5l of 0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution into 12 wells of a 96 U-bottom well dish and place the dish on ice.\nBefore colony isolation, aspirate medium on 4F-MEF transdifferentiation dish. Wash cells once with 10 ml PBS. Again, add 10 ml PBS and place dish under an inverted microscope.\nUsing a 100-\u00b5l pipette set to 40 \u00b5l lift individual colonies, by circling them with the pipette tip and aspirating the floating colony. Transfer cells of one colony each into one well of the prepared 96-well dish. After picking 12 colonies place 96-well dish in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min.\nDissociate cells by pipetting up and down for several times and transfer cell suspension into one well of a 24-well dish with prepared 500 \u00b5l of TS-CM medium (30% fresh TS medium + 70% CM + FGF4/heparin).\nThe following day replace medium with fresh TS-CM medium to remove dead cells. Change medium every other day.Monitor for appearance of epithelial colonies with bright boundaries (refer to Figure 2). Once colonies appear, culture until 70% confluent or for up to one week and gradually expand on larger dishes. From now on, culture cells as bona fide TSCs, according to standard protocols in serum containing media or in serum-free, defined media 3,5,11.\nSubscription Required.

However, the same protocol can be applied to other brain regions or after the performance of behavioral paradigms. Kill the mouse by cervical dislocation or decapitation and rapidly immerse the head in liquid nitrogen for 4 sec to rapidly cool down the brain without allowing it to freeze (this step helps for the brain dissection and to better preserve protein phosphorylation). We recommend to euthanize the mouse with physical methods such as cervical dislocation rather than using anesthetics or carbon dioxide, but this step should be adapted to local ethical committee guidelines. Remove the brain, remove the meninges, and dissect the striatum of the 2 hemispheres (\u224815-20 mg) on an ice-cooled glass dish as it is shown in Video 1.     <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Striatum extraction  Homogenize the striata in a glass dounce homogenizer (10 strokes of the loose pestle followed by 10 strokes of the tight pestle) with 1 ml of synaptoneurosome buffer kept on ice. The number of strokes might vary depending on the individual homogenizer/pestles and the size of the brain area. All the steps are performed at 4 \u00b0C (either on ice or in a 4 \u00b0C room). Representative pictures of the homogenates at each step are shown in Figure 1.Transfer the homogenate into an Eppendorf tube and aliquot 100 \u03bcl as an input.Prepare all the material required for the synaptoneurosome preparation procedure as indicated in Figure 2.Pre-wet 3 Nylon net filters (100 \u03bcm pore) in synaptoneurosome buffer on ice.Attach a 5 ml syringe without the plunger (syringe #1) to a swinnex filter holder (#1) containing the 3 pre-wetted Nylon net filters (100 \u03bcm), as illustrated in Figure 3.Then, attach this swinnex to another 5 ml syringe (syringe #2) without the plunger, which has been attached at the dispensing tip end to a swinnex filter holder containing 1 Mitex membrane filter (10 \u03bcm pore) (swinnex filter holder #2). Place on the other side of the swinnex #2 a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube on ice to collect the sample.With a 1-ml pipette, load the sample into the end of the barrel of the syringe #1 attached to a swinnex filter holder #1, insert the plunger and push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe.Remove the 5 ml syringe #1 and replace it by a 60 ml syringe with the plunger being pulled back. Once attached to the swinnex filter holder #1 containing the 3 Nylon net filters (100 \u03bcm), push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe. This step helps to push down the sample to the barrel of syringe #2.Remove the swinnex filter holder #1 containing the 3 Nylon net filters (100 \u03bcm), place the plunger of the 5 ml syringe #2, which is connected to the swinnex filter holder #2 containing 1 Mitex membrane filter (10 \u03bcm), and push down until all the air is gone from the syringe. Remove the syringe #2 and replace it with a 60 ml syringe with the plunger being pulled back. Once attached to the swinnex filter holder #2, push down on the plunger until all the air is gone from the syringe. At this step, the homogenate should be in the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube placed on ice.Centrifuge 1 min at 4,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C. Pipette the supernatant into a new Eppendorf tube and discard the pellet.A representative image of how the pellet looks is shown in Figure 1b.Centrifuge the supernatant for 4 min at 14,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C.

Using a spatula transfer one quarter of the fully grown colony (~4 cm) in a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 2 ml of 0.01% v/v Tween 80 in water. This amount usually corresponds to 108 conidiospores. The accurate amount of conidiospores can be estimated using a Neubauer counting-chamber slide or by measuring viable conidiospores after standard serial dilutions and plating on CM.   Vortex well the sample for separating the conidiospores.    Inoculate a 100 ml flask containing 25 ml MM supplemented with appropriate carbon (C) (e.g. Glucose 1% w/v) and nitrogen (N) (e.g. NaNO3 10 mM) sources and necessary vitamins (e.g. D-biotin 0.02 \u03bcg/ml) with the conidiospores filtered through a Nylon net filter 60 \u03bc\u039c. (All necessary supplements and concentrations for A. nidulans strains can be found at www.fgsc.net[href=https://bio-protocol.org/www.fgsc.net].)   Incubate for 3-5 h at 37 \u00b0C, shaking with 140 rpm, for the germinating conidiospores to reach a stage just before germ tube emergence. The time and temperature of incubation can change depending on the expression profile of the transporter of interest and the auxotrophic requirements of the strain. All transporters studied up to date in our lab (for example the purine/pyrimidine transporters UapA, UapC, AzgA, FcyB, FurD) reach maximum expression before germ tube emergence, driven by an unknown developmental control, irrespectively of the presence or absence of their substrates or other physiological conditions (Amillis et al., 2004; Vlanti and Diallinas, 2008; Amillis et al., 2007). In mycelia, transporter expression is very much dependent on physiological conditions (e.g. induction by substrates or/and N or C catabolite repression).While conidiospores germinate, prepare the stock solution of radiolabeled (usually 3H or 14C) substrate of interest in water or MM so that for each assay 25 \u03bcl of the stock will be used.    Collect the conidiospores by centrifuging the culture in a 50 ml Falcon tube for 5 min, at 3,000 x g, room temperature.   Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml standard MM.    Distribute the spores in 75 \u03bcl aliquots in eppendorf tubes and use as many as needed. Conidiospore suspensions can be kept at 4 \u00b0C for at least 24 h without loss of transport activity.    Incubate conidiospore aliquots at 37 \u00b0C in a heat block for 5 min before addition of radiolabeled substrate.    Radiolabeled substrate is added for different periods of time. Most transporters show linearly increased activities for at least 1 min. For measuring initial uptake rates, which are necessary for determining Km and apparent Vmax values, the proper time of incubation must be defined for each transporter through a time-course experiment. For steady state substrate accumulation a period of 5 min is used. Usual time points are 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 sec. For each time point, measurements are performed in triplicate. The temperature used for the incubation with the radiolabeled substrate depends on the transporter being studied at each experiment and the experiment being held, temperature for most experiments is 37 \u00b0C. The transport reaction is stopped by adding an equal volume (100 \u03bcl) of cold unlabeled substrate at 100-1,000 fold excess concentration, related to radiolabelled substrate, and direct transfer of the assay/eppendorf tube in an ice bucket.    Centrifuge the samples at 11,000 x g for 3 min at 4 \u00b0C.   Remove the supernatant through aspiration under vacuum using a Pasteur pipette.It is important to remove all the supernatant without losing any cells.   Wash the pellet of cells once with 1 ml ice cold MM and centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 3 min. Remove the supernatant as before.   Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of scintillation fluid and put the eppendorf tubes into scintillation vials. Use a scintillation counter to measure substrate accumulation in the cells.    Analysis of transport measurements is performed using GraphPad Prism software. Radioactive counts should be converted to substrate concentration/min/conidiospores, based on the concentration and specific activity of the stock of radioactive substrate used.    For Km determination of a transporter, different substrate concentrations should be used, for a fixed incubation time, previously determined to reflect initial uptake rates. This is usually 1 min. The range of concentrations used is determined at first empirically. In the final experiment, at least three concentration points below and above the apparent Km value should be used. For each concentration point measurements are performed in triplicate.   The stock solutions are prepared using a mixture of fixed radiolabeled substrate and increasing concentrations of non-radiolabeled substrate, so that for each assay 25 \u03bcl of the stock will be used.    Terminate transport assays and perform measurements as described above.   For Ki determination of a transporter, the method is identical to the one for Km determination, but stock solutions are prepared using a mixture of fixed radiolabeled substrate and increasing concentrations of non-radiolabeled putative inhibitors. For each concentration point measurements are performed in triplicate.Km and Vmax determination is carried out using typical Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis that is based on the Michaelis-Menten equation for enzyme kinetics V = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]), where V is the reaction velocity (the reaction rate), Km is the Michaelis\u2013Menten constant, Vmax is the maximum reaction velocity, and [S] is the substrate concentration. The Lineweaver-Burk plot depicts the linear expression of the previous equation which is transformed to the following: 1/V = (Km/Vmax).(1/[S]) + 1/Vmax. The data obtained by this experiment correspond to the apparent velocity of the transporter for each substrate concentration. Ki measurements are determined by estimating IC50 values (inhibitor concentration for obtaining 50% inhibition) of given substrate/inhibitor, using the formula Ki = IC50/1 + [S]/Km, where [S] is the fixed concentration of radiolabeled substrate used. Another way to analyse the data is by using the GraphPad Prism Software through a non linear regression curve fit and sigmoidal dose response analysis. The IC50 value corresponds to the Km/i of the transporter. Quality factors for the analysis result are: R2 which should be > 0.99 and the Hill co-efficient which should be approximately -1 for a transporter with one binding site.   The method described can be modified and adapted for most filamentous fungi that produce asexual spores, e.g. A. fumigatus.
