PR8 virus dissolved in 30 \u03bcl of PBS is pipetted onto the nostrils of heavily anesthetized mice.  Proper anesthesia can be visually confirmed by agonal breathing and usually requires about 5 minutes in an isoflurane chamber. Properly anesthetized mice will aspirate the fluid directly into their lungs.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Donor cell isolation and transplantation: At 9 days post-infection, isolate donor cells from a ubiquitously fluorophore-expressing mouse, following the Epithelial Cell Isolation protocol.  Ub-GFP and mTmG are particularly useful strains for this.  After sorting, donor cells are resuspended in 50ul sterile PBS.  Recipient mice receive cell solution intranasally, exactly as described above for influenza administration.  After transplantation, we\u2019ve observed that keeping mice in a nose cone with a flow of 100% oxygen can aid in recovery and decrease the chance of accidental death.  We observe engraftment using anywhere between 1,000 to 1 million donor cells.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Tissue Harvest: Endpoint analysis is performed at day 21 post-infection \\(or desired experimental endpoint). Mice are anesthetized and lungs perfused and lavaged three times with 1 ml PBS.  Lungs are inflated with about 0.75 mls of 4% PFA and tied off at the trachea, being careful not to overinflate.  Place lungs in an additional 20 ml of 4% PFA and rock at room temperature for 1 hour.  Decant PFA and rinse with PBS. Decant PBS and replace with fresh PBS and incubate 1-4 hours rocking at room temperature. This allows for the diffusion of remaining PFA inside the lungs to prevent over-fixation. Incubate in 30% sucrose in PBS + 0.02% azide at 4 degrees on a rocker overnight. The following day, decant sucrose solution and replace with 50% OCT / 15% sucrose / PBS for 2 hours at room temp. Pour out the lung and carefully dissect each lobe and trachea apart. Arrange the lungs and trachea in a cryomold containing 100% OCT and incubate on ice for 1 hour. Freeze entire cryomold in a dry ice alcohol bath.", "1. Grow D. melanogaster larvae at 18\u00b0C in fly bottles on standard fly food; use full grown, 3rd instar larvae for not more than two days from the start of their emergence.\r\n  2. Transfer several larvae to 35 mm Petri dishes with ~100 \u03bcl water; give heat-shock for transgene lac repressor expression if needed\n1\n, followed by 1-2 h recovery. \r\n  3. Place the Petri dish with larvae on ice for ~20 min to immobilize larvae. \r\n  4. Using fine-point forceps, dissect salivary glands in TB1 buffer\n8\non the glass slide with a 1.5 mm depression. Remove head parts and most fat body. Rinse glands with 20 \u03bcl Pipetman, adjusted to 7-8 \u03bcl volume, emerging the tip in the buffer prior to touching the glands. \r\n  5. Transfer glands with the same Pipetman tip to fixative on another slide with a well depression, fix exactly 2 min.\r\n  6. While the glands are being fixed, attach a 22 mm square coverslip to the center of a glass slide with a small amount \\(3-4 \u03bcl) of water.  \r\n  7. Dispose of the anterior pars of glands with the ducts and transfer \\(not more than one pair of glands per preparation) in exactly 7 \u03bcl of the fixative to the center of the coverslip, covering the preparation with an 18 mm square siliconized coverslip. \r\n  8. After transferring the glass slide to the bench surface, cover it with a\n25 mm wide strip of Whatman filter paper \\(0.2 mm thickness), taping a\n40 mm wide piece of clear plastic film \\(transparency, 3M) on top of it. \\(Fig. 1). \r\n  9. To spread the chromosomes, use a Dremel Flex-Shaft attachment inserting a soft plastic tip into the bit holder. Use tips that have 6-12 smooth, protruding knobs around the circumference of the tip edge \\(Fig. 1).  Tips can be constructed by cutting 200 \u03bcl Pipetman plastic tips close to the wide base, cutting triangular notches around the end circumference, and then lightly melting the cut tip end on a gas burner to form rounded, slightly protruding \\(\n1.5 mm) knobs. Using a manually held Dremel Flex-Shaft attachment rotating at\n200 rpm, apply the vibration to the preparation by slightly touching the plastic film covering the preparation with the knobbed rotating tip, positioned at ~45\u00b0 to the surface. Using spiral movements spread the chromosomes from the coverslip center towards its periphery, periodically removing the filter paper and film to monitor the progress using a phase contrast microscope. Continue this process for several minutes, until the chromosomes appear satisfactorily spread without much overlapping cell debris.\r\n  10. To remove excess fixative, start pressing the preparation lightly, gradually increasing the pressure.  Continue for several minutes, by sliding movements of the thumb over the area of the coverslip.  Finish the step by firm press with the thumb.  At this step, most of the excessive fixative has to be removed not to introduce a damaging hydraulic shock to the chromosomes in the vise. \r\n  11. Removing the filter paper and plastic film, cover the preparation with a strip of silicone-impregnated paper \\(0.12 mm thickness) of the same size as the slide \\(the siliconized side faces the coverslip) and place another glass slide on top of this.  After aligning the layers, place the glass slide sandwich in the center of an Avenger Gold toolmaker, tin coated, precision MTC-200-1 vise \\(Penn Tool:  Maplewood, NJ, \"http://www.penntoolco.com\":http://www.penntoolco.com), or comparable models with high surface parallelism.\r\n  12. Use a torque wrench to tighten the vise, always keeping the moving surfaces and tightening threads moderately oiled to maximize the smoothness of the operation.  Use at least two steps for pressing.  First, press the preparation lightly \\(up to 3 newton meters, as measured by a torque wrench) for 2 min to force out excess fixative and stabilize the preparation by reducing a hydraulic shock caused by outward liquid flow.  Gradually tighten the vise \\(up to 17 newton meters), maintaining the preparation at this pressure for ~1 min.  If well centered, the slides almost never cracked. \r\n  13. Gradually release the vise pressure and transfer the slide with the coverslips to liquid nitrogen for\n1 min. Flip the top, siliconized coverslip off with a razor blade, placing the slide with the remaining coverslip with preparation into 100% EtOH to thaw for\n20 sec before removal of the coverslip from the glass slide.  \r\n  14. Store coverslips within sealed 35 mm Petri dishes for up to one week in 100% EtOH at -20\u00b0C.\r\n  15. Proceed with FISH or immunostaining if planned, as suggested\n1\n. Buffers can be modified as suggested below \\(troubleshooting).  \r\n  16. For DNA staining use DAPI, 20 ng/ml in PBS \\(or other buffers; see troubleshooting below) 15-30 min.\r\n  17. Use fluorescence microscope to acquire one \\(best focused) optical section of the areas of interest.\r\n  18. Use Photoshop to minimally process the image \\(changing brightness and contrast and using \u201cunsharp mask\u201d filter to improve print quality).", "**Sampling of skin**\r\n\n\n1.

Prime the injection system multiple time.\r\n\n\n6. \\(Optional) Clean-up the ESI source of the MS instrument according to the manufacturer's\r\n  guidelines. Calibrate instruments using the calibration solution according to manufacturer's\r\n\n\nguideline. For the MaXis II QTOF, add the solution containing internal lockmass \\(m/z 922.009)\r\n\n\nin the ESI source in the positive ion mode, following the the manufacturer's guideline.\r\n\n\n7. Set up the MS method as follows: for the MaXis II QTOF MS, acquire spectra in positive ion\r\n  mode in the mass range of m/z 80\u00152,000 with the following settings: capillary voltage, 4,500\r\n\n\nV; ion source temperature, 180 \u0089; dry gas \u001dow, 9 L/min; spectra rate acquisition, 3 spectra/s.\r\n\n\nPerform MS/MS fragmentation of the seven most intense selected ions per spectrum \\(TOP7)\r\n\n\nusing ramped collision-induced dissociation \\(CID) energy, ranging from 16 to 48 eV, to get\r\n\n\ndiverse fragmentation patterns. Set MS/MS exclusion after 3 spectra to be released after 30 s.\r\n\n\nSet an MS/MS exclusion list for the mass range of m/z 921.5\u0015924.5 to exclude the lockmass, and\r\n\n\nif needed include other adducts of the lockmass if their intensities are in the range of MS/MS\r\n\n\nthreshold.\r\n\n\n8. Run a blank sample and verify that no signi\u001ccant contamination from source is impacting\r\n  the system by assessing abundances of observed ions and ensuring that they do not exceed\r\n\n\nthresholds appropriate for the instrument \\(e.g. below few thousand counts for the MaXis II\r\n\n\nQTOF instrument). If high abundance contaminants are present, consider additional source\r\n\n\ncleaning, replacement of mobile phases, glassware, LC column or tubing, as needed.\r\n\n\n9. \\(Optional, but recommended): Start by running the QC sample, followed by a blank, and\r\n  repeat it at least two times. Check for satisfactory reproducibility by comparing multiple QC\r\n\n\nsamples \\(coefficient of variation, CV, below 0.1-0.3). Check for carryover by inspecting the blank\r\n\n\nthat followed a QC sample. If needed, adjust the injection volume to prevent chromatographic\r\n\n\nsaturation \\(peak broadening), and mass spectrometer detector saturation \\(peak flattening). If\r\n\n\nneeded, optimize the LC gradient to ensure appropriate separation of representative features,\r\n\n\nand the number of needle/injector washes to reduce carry-over below 1%.\r\n\n\n10. Prepare the LC-MS sequence for the samples injections. Include the analysis of the blank and\r\n  the QC sample every 12 samples or less, depending on total number of samples. If possible, the\r\n\n\nsamples order should be randomized.\r\n\n\n11. \\(Optional): Include a clean-up sample every 12 samples to limit column saturation. This is\r\n  recommended if sample contains components that are strongly retained by the column and are\r\n\n\nnot eluted completely by the mobile phase. Typically, this clean-up run is composed of multiple\r\n\n\nmobile phase composition variation according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\r\n\n\n12. Run the LC-MS sequence, and monitor regularly that \\(i) elution pro\u001cle of every QC sample is\r\n  reproducible \\(5-10 sec window maximum for UHPLC, or a coefficient of variation of 0.1-0.3), and\r\n\n\n\\(ii) that the calibration is stable \\(< 10 ppm for MaXis II QTOF). If needed, stop the LC-MS\r\n\n\nsequence, and calibrate the instrument according to manufacturer guidelines. For the MaXis II\r\n\n\nQTOF, lock mass calibrant must be added every 12 hours. If the LC-MS sequence was stopped,\r\n\n\nrun a QC sample and a blank prior continuing the rest of your analysis.\r\n\n\n13. After \u001cnishing the LC-MS experiments, open representative \u001cles, from both the beginning and\r\n  the end of the sequence, with the MS data viewing software \\(Data Analysis for MaXis II QTOF).\r\n\n\nOverlap features across samples, such as the internal standard, and assess the stability of the\r\n\n\nchromatography \\(retention shift in seconds), and the MS calibration \\(m/z window in ppm).\r\n\n\n14. Export all LC-MS/MS \u001cles into the centroided .mzXML format. For the MaXis II QTOF MS,\r\n  use CompassXport to apply calibration, and convert the data from .d format to .mzXML format\r\n\n\nin centroid mode \\(select Filters: Peak Picking, MS-Levels 1-2).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Data analysis**\r\n\n\nCreating feature tables.

ARACNe-AP requires in input a gene expression matrix and a predefined list of transcriptional regulators. As gene expression data, we used the single cell transcriptomes (normalized gene counts) of all 883 neoplastic cells from Darmanis et al.\n2\n. To limit the effects of scRNA-seq data sparsity in GRN reconstruction\n3\n, we removed from the input matrix genes detected only in a limited number of cells (normalized counts >0 in at least 100 cells, i.e., slightly over the number of cells in which a gene is detected on average in this dataset). The filter retained a total of 9,845 genes. As candidate transcriptional regulators (TRs), we used a list of transcription factors whose DNA-binding motifs were found enriched in the open chromatin regions of brain cancers and their dedicated transcriptional co-factors. Briefly, taking advantage of the epigenetic analyses provided by a recent large-scale ATAC-seq profiling of several human tumor types, including GBM\n4\n, we carried out a DNA binding motif enrichment analysis using the HOMER\nfindMotifsGenome.pl\nfunction on the open chromatin regions of GBMs, and then selected the transcription factors whose DNA-binding motifs were highly enriched (FDR<0.0001) in at least 10% of these genomic regions. We excluded few factors (i.e., BATF, JUNB, PRDM1), since they are known to work mainly as transcriptional repressors. We manually curated this list with partner transcriptional co-factors (e.g., NOTCHs for RBPJ, etc) for a total of 151 TRs (Supplementary Table 1). ARACNe-AP was run with 100 bootstrap iterations setting the DPI (data processing inequality) tolerance to 0 and the MI (mutual information) P value threshold to 10\n-8\n. This resulted a single cell GBM network comprising 32,016 interactions between 70 TRs and 6,079 genes.\nStep 2: anchoring of regulatory interactions to GBM epigenetic landscape.\nSince the network inferred in the first step is based only on GBM single cell expression data, we intersected the gene interactomes of the GBM network with epigenetic data to eliminate spurious associations generated by the noise intrinsic to scRNA-seq data and to retain only biologically relevant associations between TRs and putative target genes. Specifically, we first analyzed the epigenetic data provided by Corces et al.\n4\nusing the HOMER\nannotatePeaks.pl\nfunction to map the TRs potentially able to bind each of the ATAC-seq peak of GBMs. Then, we used the associations between each ATAC-seq peak and its target genes (Data S2 of Corces et al.\n4\n) to map each TR to a set of putative target genes (Supplementary Table 2). Finally, we intersected this set of putative direct target genes with the interactomes of the GBM network, thus removing upstream regulators, indirectly interacting genes, and false positives and retaining only the lists of target genes with binding motif for a TR in their cis-regulatory elements (regulons).\nStep 3: scoring of candidate master TRs.\nTo identify master regulators of GSCs, we applied the VIPER algorithm\n5\nto the GBM regulons resulting from Step 2. VIPER uses the expression level of genes that are most directly regulated by a given protein, such as the targets of a transcription factor, to infer the activity of the transcription factor on a set of samples. We used the VIPER algorithm as implemented in the\nmsviper\nfunction of the Bioconductor\nviper\npackage (v. 1.16.0) in R 3.5.0. The\nmsviper\nrequires in input i) a gene expression signature resulting from the comparison of two types of samples, ii) a null model composed by a set of signatures obtained after permuting the samples at random, and iii) a gene regulatory network. To reduce the effect of outlier samples on the gene expression signature, we performed the\nmsviper\nanalysis with bootstrap, i.e., imputing the gene expression signature as a matrix of bootstrapped signatures. Specifically, we generated the bootstrapped signature matrix comparing, in 100 bootstrap iterations, the expression profiles of GSC versus GDC cells with the\nbootstrapTtest\nfunction. We defined the null model as a set of gene expression signatures obtained through the\nttestNull\nfunction by randomly shuffling 1,000 times the samples among the GSC and GDC sets and we used the GBM regulons from Step 2 as the gene network. Finally, we used the\nbootstrapmsviper\nfunction to integrate the regulator activity results of the\nmsviper\nanalysis across all bootstrapped iterations. Based on VIPER analysis, we defined as candidate master TRs those regulomes (i.e., the TR and its regulon) with an FDR \u22640.05 and a number of target genes >70. This resulted in 27 candidate MRs, of which 15 were candidate master TRs of the GSC state and 7 were candidate master TRs of the DGC state.", "1) FASII gel-elongation assay was done by preincubating 0.25 - 2 \u00b5g of _E. coli_ or _S. aureus_ lysate with a serial dilution of inhibitors at room temperature for 20 min in 50 \u00b5l of buffer containing 100 mM sodium phosphate \\(pH 7.0), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM NADPH, 1 mM NADH, 150 \u00b5M DTT, 5 mM \u00df-mercaptoethanol, 20 \u00b5M acetyl-CoA or n-octanoyl-CoA or any other acyl-CoA as needed, 4% DMSO, and 8 \u00b5M of ACP pretreated with DTT. \r\n\n\n2) The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 \u00b5l of water-diluted \\[C-14]malonyl-CoA, which gave a final concentration of 4 \u00b5M malonyl-CoA. \r\n\n\n3) The reaction was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min for _E. coli_ lysate and 60 min for _S. aureus_ lysate. \r\n\n\n4) After the reaction, 10 \u00b5l \\(plus 10 \u00b5l 2X native sample buffer) of each sample was directly applied to a l6% polyacrylamide gel containing a range of 0.4 M to 4 M urea as needed. \r\n\n\n5) The gel was resolved and transfered to a polyvinylidene difluoride \\(PVDF) membrane, exposed to Phosphor Screen and visualized by using a PhosphorImager scanner.", "1.

Variation of protocol to include a unique molecular index \\(UMI)**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIt may be desirable to use a UMI when it is necessary to use many \\(>35) cycles of PCR to amplify a low abundant RNA species. The UMI, combined with unique mismatch profiles from DMS modification itself, can be used to collapse to unique reads and remove any biases generated during rounds of PCR.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u25cf Follow the protocol as above through reverse transcription, with one adjustment.

The Tm of the gene-specific binding region should still be > 60.5\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\u25cf After RT, use a forward gene-specific PCR primer and oMZ283 for the reverse primer, which complementary to the RT primer overhang. Amplicon size should be chosen based on the sequencing read length used downstream.

RNA sequence design (~0.5 day)\nBecause substantial fraction (30-70%) of transcription products are short abortive RNA products, an ~8nt-long 5'-overhang nucleotide sequence needs to be prepended to the main RNA, to minimize interference of these short abortive RNAs with specific protein-RNA interactions and RNA folding. This sequence is designed algorithmically and can be used as a separate control to identify specific RNA effects from the other network perturbations.\nHaving decided on the primary RNA sequence, run `sample_prep/aborts_n_backfolding_XX.m` script, following instructions/examples in the header of the script for 5'-overhang generation (e.g. avoiding formation of dimers, excluding GG/purine pairs, etc. The script will produce a range of possible 5'-overhang variants, from which one or several can be selected for experimental tests. Main criteria for downstream experimental selection are:\n- Judging from denaturing / non-denaturing gel-electrophoresis:\n- homogeniety of transcription product\n- yield of transcription product\n- If observation of imino signals from the folded RNA is important, and you're choosing between several 5'-overhang variants: run 1D1H NMR of the transcription mixture, and choose the sequence which produces the least number of \"background\" signals in the imino region of the spectrum.\n#### 2. Preparation of DNA templates (~7 days)\nTo ensure maximum homogeniety of synthesized RNA, we do the transcription from a plasmid DNA template (not from synthetic oligo-nucleotide templates). To increase efficiency, multiple templates can be prepared in parallel.\n#### 2A. Clone the template DNA under T7 RNA Pol promoter (~1 day cloning, ~1 day wait for colonies, ~2 days miniprep + sequencing)\nWe are using pTX1 vector system [Michel E. et. al, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-7634-8_11). The `sample_prep/ptx1_primers.xls` provides automated template for design of cloning primers (see instructions in the file).\n#### 2B. Purify DNA template (~1.5 days)\n- Use a kit Nucleobond Xtra Maxi (Macherey-Nagel) or an equivalent from Qiagen, etc. This yields per column \u2265250-350 ug pTX1 plasmid DNA template, enough for ~10 transcription-NMR reactions (450ul each, at 33 nM DNA template).\nTips for the procedure:\n- Per one Maxi column grow ~300ml culture till OD600\u22483 (OD*V=900).\n- Can try to saturate the Maxi columns more, to reach 500-1000 ug plasmid yield per column: then grow e.g. 600ml of OD600\u22483 culture, and increase the volumes of buffer used for lysis & etc.\n- To get max yields: start the culture use a fresh (<7 days) colony, make overday preculture in 10ml until OD600\u22481, dilute 1:100 in the final ~300 ml medium for overnight growth. (or store the fresh OD600\u22481 preculture at 4\u00baC and start main culture in the morning).\n- Use baffled flasks, this allows to reach OD600\u22483, giving 4g cells / L culture.\n- Use 2x antibiotic amount than usual.\n- Elution from column: pre-heat elution buffer + make elution twice (reapplying same eluate).\n- After isopropanol precipitation centrifuge 1h @ 4000xg, 4\u00baC.\n- After isopropanol removal, wash the pellet not once, but 3 times with 70% ethanol, each time detaching DNA pellet from the walls by inverting the tube, and then centrifugation. This removes salts which reduce the yield &/or quality of transcription.\n- Dry the pellet on air for 4-6 hours (overnight also ok).\n- Dissolve DNA in H2O to ~0.41 \u00b5M concentration (650 \u00b5g/ml for 2.4kb plasmid) - this allows to have sufficiently concentrated DNA in the end (after linearization), to not dilute the final NMR sample too much.\n- To ensure homogenous dissolution of DNA pellet after drying, perform 3 cycles of: [vortex, incubate 10-20 minutes at 50\u00baC, vortex, freeze at -20\u00baC, thaw]. If pellet did not detach from the wall after first vortex, use the pipet to detach it.\n#### 2C. Linearize the DNA template (~0.5 day).\nTo maximize the yield and homogeniety of the main RNA product, it is important to thoroughly linearize the template. For the pTX1 plasmid we use BsaI enzyme (NOT the BsaI-HF version!), at 1.5U/ug DNA, in NEB buffer 3.1, for 13-15 hours at 50\u00baC, followed by 1h at 65\u00baC inactivation. Check the plasmid cleavage on 1% agarose gel.\n#### 2D. Optimize the MgCl2 concentration for transcription (~1 day)\nRun small-scale transcriptions (~25 \u00b5l is enough) and analyze them using denaturing PAGE with urea. In our hands for pure DNA template optimal MgCl2 range was always close to 1:1 ratio with NTPs (e.g. 20-24mM MgCl2 when using 20mM NTPs).\n#### 3. Buffer exchange for protein of interest (~0.5 day)\nTo match the starting Tris-Triton-DTT (TTD) transcription buffer, transfer your protein into: 40 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% Triton-X100, 5 mM Dithiothreitol, pH 7.7. From our experience many proteins are stable in this buffer. To stabilize the protein more, one can potentially add:\n- 50 mM L-Arg/L-Glu (this leads to increased broadening of imino signals)\n- up to ~75 mM NaCl / KCl (salt decreases transcription efficiency)\n- ~1 mM NTPs - these seem capable to mask RNA-binding interfaces, reducing self-aggregation of protein through those. Added NTPs need to be taken into account in the total NTP concentration -- for addition of MgCl2, and for setting the initial concentrations during ODE network modeling.\n### (B) Setup of an in-vitro-transcription-NMR reaction (30-60 minutes)\n#### 1. Sample prep\n- Sample preparation template: `sample_prep/ivtnmr.xslx`\n- Below setup is for 450 ul samples in 5mm TA NMR tubes. One can also use 250-300ul samples is shigemi tubes and/or 150ul in 3mm tubes (but for 3mm tubes the acquisition times may need to be adjusted).\n- To increase observability of imino signals we:\n- Run reactions at 30\u00baC instead of 37\u00baC.\n- Exclude commonly added spermidine from the transcription buffer because it leads to significant broadening of imino signals.\n- Use transcription buffer with pH 7.7. T7 RNA Pol gives better yields at pH 8.1, but iminos are observed better at lower pH. During typical transcription reaction (starting with 20mM NTPs), due to release of free xPO4, pH goes down by ~0.2 pH units. The pH change can be monitored from the shift of 31P xPO4 signal and/or shift of 1H Tris signal.\n- In case you need larger fraction of sample volume to add diluted protein or other additives, the NTPs, MgCl2 and DNA template components can be pre-lyophilized together. This seems to not affect the yield or homogeniety of RNA product.\n- T7 RNA polymerase is added only after time0 reference spectra are recorded.\n#### 2. NMR setup\nNotes:\n!!!!!!!!!!\nWARNING: the TopSpin Python scripts and pulseprograms are provided here \"as is\" - merely as a guideline for automated setup. These were not thoroughly tested on different spectrometers and may contain bugs and incompatibilities with TopSpin and spectrometer console versions!\n!!!!!!!!!!\ufeff\n- We use an automated script `nmr/py/in_v02.yn.py` which makes tuning-matching, shimming, pulse calibrations and experiment setup.\n- The measured experiments are configured by this script based on the template experiments which are placed into an empty IVTNMR_template - template dataset (example in `nmr/IVTNMR_template`):\n- 1D1H (expno 12, pp `nmr/pp/zg-wg001`) - full 1H spectrum - for DSS calibration, pH check from Tris position, and potential quantification of individual NTPs (A/U/G/C) consumption rates (all four nucleotides have some specific signals in the aromatic region of the spectrum).\n- 2D 1H1H TOCSY (expno 13, pp `nmr/pp/stocsy003`) - (not required for the setup described in the paper) - allows to observe RNA with higher resolution on certain signals, e.g. U/C H5-H6 correlations.\n- 1D31P (expno 14, pp `nmr/pp/zgig002`) - to observe 31P-containing molecules\n- 2DHN-sofast-hmqc (expno 15, pp `nmr/pp/sfhmqc01`) - to observe protein\n- 1D1H-sofast (expno 16, pp `nmr/pp/zg-sofast006`) - to observe RNA imino region with increased sensitivity\nStep-by-step procedure:\n1. Create new dataset, including main information in its name, for simplification of automated analysis: `YYMMDD_INXXX_RNANAME_PROTEINNAME_TEMPERATURE_MAGNET` (e.g. `180914_IN71b_SMN1_coNUP1_303K_600`). Here, INXXX (IN71b) - is the experiment ID, implying same ID for the same RNA and protein combination. Replicate experiments are denoted with lowercase letter (IN71a, IN71b, ..) - so its easy to find similar experiments programmatically from shell, Matlab, etc.\n2. Make temperature calibration (we use expno 1 consistently).\n3. Insert the sample into magnet. Wait 1 min for temperature equilibration. Run `nmr/py/in_v02.yn.py` script for the setup of series. Check and test this script carefully before doing real runs.\n4. After the automation script has finished:\n- In 2DHN spectrum - set the SW / carrier / TD / etc parameters to the values optimal for your protein\n- Check the 90-degree 31P pulse value (script runs `paropt` procedure, storing results in expno 4 999) - and enter it into 1D31P experiment.\n- (If expect drift of tune-matching system): check the tune-match of channels of interest.\n- Start reference (time0) experiments.\n- **NOTE**: The key reference spectra required at this stage are 1D31P (as a reference for initial NTP concentration) and 2DHN (as a reference for initial protein peak positions / intensities). If the same batches of protein / NTPs are used - one can potentially start directly without recording new time0 references, and for downstream data analysis just make a copy of the references recorded in earlier days.\n5. Check that Autoshim is turned off (in our experience Autoshim can introduce variation in lineshapes between individual 1D/2D spectra, which is later hard to distinguish from real changes in the network / molecule dynamics).\n6. While references are running: use `nmr/py/createExpSeries.py` to generate time-series of repeating experiments for required time-period from the reference spectra. See the header of the script for details.\n7. If some tuning-matching was done during setup (if not doing consecutive measurements in the same buffer): check the probe did not detune on the channels of interest while references were running.\n8. Take sample out of the magnet, then:\n- (2 min) add T7 RNA Pol, mix the sample, spin if need to remove bubbles, insert sample back to the magnet.\n- (2 min) lock, temperature equilibration, check tune-match.\n- (1 min) topshim, twice!.\n- **NOTE**: remember/write down the time at which the RNA Pol was added. Later insert the exact time into the `notes.txt` file in the dataset directory. This file and time0 tag is automatically created by the `in_v02.xx.py` script. The\ntag gives the downstream analysis scripts info on when reaction was started:\n`\nYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n`\n**Currently the analysis scripts assume the time zone is set identical on the spectrometer computer and the spectrometer console and don't check GMT zone. So be careful if the GMT setting of your spectrometer station is different from the GMT setting written by console into audita.txt file (these settings m/b different on NEO consoles)**\n9. Start experiment series (`qumulti ##-##`).\n### (D) Data processing (>= 1 hour per sample)\n1. Sort experiments: `sort.py`. This script sorts data by experiment type, adds rough experiment time to the title, creates cara repository with linked 2DHN spectra and `integr_datasets_31P.txt` file for 31P integration. See script header for details. For auto-generation of cara repository, two fragments of final repository (`180917_INx_blank_1top.cara`, `180917_INx_blank_2bottom.cara`) need to be present in the py/user directory.\n2. For quick visualization / comparison of data in TopSpin - see helper scripts: `res.py` (reading data by giving only parts of dataset name), `md.py` (overlaying series), `zim.py` and `zh33.py` (zooming on specific regions of spectra).\n2. Except for 31P spectra - the phases of 1D1H, 1D1H-iminos and 2DHN spectra need to be detemined manually for optimal results. For 1D1H and 2DHN - ideally the common phase for time-resolved series is determined not on the first (time0) spectrum, but on the second spectrum - one after T7 addition. One might want to check the phases of 2DHN and 1D1H time0 spectra then (these might be slightly different from \"time1\" spectra).\n3. Process 1D31P:\n- `qumulti 5000-5500`\n- example of processing command (check only SR corrections, in our setup phase seems determined robustly enough by `apks` routine):\n`SR -139; si 64k; wdw EM; lb 2; efp; apks; absf1 14; absf2 -26; absg 5; absn`\n4. Integrate: TopSpin `intser` command, pointing to the `integr_datasets_31P.txt` as the list of spectra to integrate (it should be created by `sort.py` in the dataset folder). Use default settings for integration - the calibration of integrals to internal NTP signal happens later during analysis.\n- Integration regions we use:\n```\n#\u00a0\u00a03.4714285714285715\u00a01.5571428571428572\u00a0\u00a0-- PO4\n#\u00a0\u00a00.42857142857142855\u00a0-2.676190476190476\u00a0-- PPi\n#\u00a0\u00a0-4.3238095238095235\u00a0-5.352380952380952\u00a0-- RNA\n#\u00a0\u00a0-5.352380952380952\u00a0-5.390476190476191\u00a0\u00a0-- gammaNTP\n#\u00a0\u00a0-5.390476190476191\u00a0-5.804761904761905\u00a0\u00a0-- RNA-5'gamma?\n#\u00a0\u00a0-9.101442036015632\u00a0-9.806884238970339\u00a0\u00a0-- betaNDP\n#\u00a0\u00a0-9.80952380952381\u00a0-10.433333333333334\u00a0\u00a0-- alphaNDP\n#\u00a0\u00a0-10.433333333333334\u00a0-11.219047619047618 -- alphaNTP\n#\u00a0\u00a0-17.60952380952381\u00a0-19.052380952380954\u00a0-- RNA-5'beta?\n#\u00a0\u00a0-19.052380952380954\u00a0-19.714285714285715 -- betaNTP\n```\n4. Process 2DHN:\n- `qumulti 4000-4500`\n- example of processing command (check phase, SR corrections, STSI/STSR for the dimensions of the final spectrum, etc):\n`2 sr -26.41; 1 sr -2.676; 2 phc0 -264.203; 2 phc1 0; 2 si 8k; 1 si 512; 2 STSI 2214; 2 STSR 1512; 1 stsi 0; 1 stsr 0; 2 absf1 11; 2 absf2 5.5; 1 absf1 200; 1 absf2 80; absg 5; xfb n nc_proc 7; abs2; abs1`\n5. Pick peaks in 2DHN spectra: create a project and a peaklist in a Cara repository, then pick peaks of interest and trace their positions across time series using peak aliasing in Cara Monoscope. The `sort.py` script creates a cara repository with linked spectra in the dataset folder. Downstream analysis scripts read the peaks information from cara repositories at the moment. If analyzing multiple datasets at once, it is, however, convenient instead of having multiple Cara files, to have one Cara file with each dataset represented by own project and peaklist. Useful shortcuts for peak tracing in Monoscope:\n- `Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2` - move between spectra\n- `mp / ma` - move peak or its alias\n- `gp` - go to peak\n- `gs` - go to spectrum (if not argument provided will switch to the first spectrum in series)\n### (E) Data analysis and model fitting (\u2248 0.5 day)\nUnless stated otherwise, most below procedures are done in Matlab (`*.m` files).\n#### 1. Generate data structure for ODE model fit.\nRun `analysis/ODE/v01/model_and_data/gen_ivtnmr.m` - this script will read 31P integrals from above 31P integration file, and 2DHN chemical shifts from cara repository, and then create the data structure used by the ODE model fitting procedure in `ODE/v01/model_and_data/data_for_fit` folder. It will also generate \"ivtnmr\" data object in `ODE/v01/model_and_data/data_ivtnmr_full/` - which contains main information about IVTNMR experiment in one Matlab structure (names, number of time-points, integrals, chemical shifts, etc). The code in `v01` folder is largely self-contained - so its convenient to just duplicate and rename it (e.g. `v02_test`) to keep track of different versions when you're making adjustments to data analysis / model structure / etc.\n#### 2. Fit the ODE model.\nRun `analysis/ODE/v01/a_fit_multi.m`, which can fit multiple IVTNMR datasets sequentially. The procedure reads the ODE model from `model_and_data/xIVT.mdf` file and fits it into experimental data from `model_and_data/data_for_fit` generated at the previous step. You may need to adjust the rna length in the MDF file to suit your RNA length - it is included in the\nsection (e.g. for 28-nucleotide RNA: `+f1*(27/28) +f2 -f3`). The mdf file is generated by Matlab `convertBNGL_to_MDF.m` script based on the `xIVT.bngl` - Rule-Based-Model defined in BioNetGen language (mode details below). The fitting script will generate PDF figures of the fit summary (in `ODE/v01/model_and_data/figure_images`) and will export fitting results into `ODE/v01/model_and_data/a_fit_multi.mat` which can be read and analyzed further.\n#### 3. Visualize ODE fit results.\nRun `analysis/ODE/v01/a_visualize.m` - this will automatically read fitting results from `ODE/v01/model_and_data/a_fit_multi.mat` and visualize the fitted constants, replicates and errors.\n#### 4. Analyze and visualize time-resolved imino linewidths.\nRun `analysis/LW/a_fit_LW.m` to fit and visualize imino linewidths. This fitting assumes a sigle peak with lorentzian lineshape, and thus works best for well-resolved signals. Decrease of pH during reaction (usually around ~0.2 pH units) might lead to slight systematic change of linewidth with reaction time. Also, a \"growing\" baseline in a crowded region may lead to apparent narrowing of linewidth with reaction time, because the current fitting routine assumes baseline fixed at zero intensity. This effect can be factored out, if appropriate baseline correction is found. In the single-lorentzian fit, the intrinsic broadening of one imino signal cannot be distinguished from broadening caused by overlap with neighboring signals, which has to be considered when interpreting the data.\n### (F) Analysis of parameter (reaction constant) uncertainty\n- **Replicates.** Based on our current experience, the most sensible / realistic parameter uncertainties are obtained by running \u22652 experimental replicates - ideally using different batches of DNA template and/or protein. Basic code for calculation of such uncertainties is included in `analysis/ODE/v01/a_visualize.m`\n- **Bootstrap.** Uncertainties obtained from bootstrap analysis (resampling of the full data vector with replacement prior to the fitting), in our setup yield too narrow confidence intervals - most likely due to very high number of recorded data points.\n- **FIM.** The standard Fisher Information Matrix / Cramer Rao bound also often yields unrealistically narrow or unrealistically large uncertainties - most likely due to the lack of reasonable error estimates on the individual NMR integral / chemical shift data points.\n### (G) Adjusting ODE model\n1. In [RuleBender](http://visualizlab.org/rulebender/) software (or just text editor): **edit the BioNetGen network** definition (`ODE/v01/model_and_data/xIVT.bngl`). For downstream fitting it is important to match the number and order of defined observables to the data vectors you actually provide for model fitting.\n2. In shell/terminal: **recompile the model**.\n```\ncd ODE/v01/model_and_data\n../../../soft/BioNetGen217/Perl2/BNG2.pl xIVT.bngl\n```\n3. In Matlab: **convert the model to MDF format** for fitting.\n```\ncd ODE/v01/model_and_data\nconvertBNGL_to_MDF('xIVT.bngl')\n```\n4. In Matlab: **adjust the fitting routine** `v01/a_fit.m` to match the observables / data / constants used in the new network model. Key things which need to be checked:\n- Order/number of data vectors used for fitting (needs to match the observables in mdf file) - check `obs_data_to_keep` variable;\n- If added new observables/reactions: check if model initial params (NDP, Prot(s) conc, ..) are set correctly\n- If added new constants/params: check their init values in the `a_fit.m`, file and/or exclude from optimization. And potentially add their normalization and saving into the output of model fit results.\n**Note**: In the used here implementation BioNetGen cannot provide arbitrary rate laws and algebraic constants for scaling. If want such things included - need to specify them in the final `*.mdf` file used for fitting - similar to what we do for RNA length definition.

The code for this study can be found at link. A diagnostic package built off the OHDSI Cohort Diagnostics (\nhttps://ohdsi.github.io/CohortDiagnostics/\n) library, is included in the base package as a preliminary step to assess the fitness of use of phenotypes on your database. If a database passes cohort diagnostics, the full study package will be executed. Baseline covariates will be extracted using an optimized SQL extraction script based on principles of the FeatureExtraction package (\nhttp://ohdsi.github.io/FeatureExtraction/\n) to quantify Demographics, Condition Group Eras, and Drug Group Eras Additional cohort-specific covariates will be constructed using OMOP Standard Vocabulary concepts.\nAt the time of executing Feature Extraction, the package will create a data frame in which individuals\u2019 age and sex will be extracted. Individuals\u2019 medical conditions, procedures, measurements and medications will be summarized 1) over the year prior to their index date (-365\u20141 day), 32) at index date (0day), and 4) at and over the follow-up time (0+ days). Number and proportion of persons with feature variables during time-at-risk windows will be reported by target cohort and specific stratifications. Standardized mean differences (SMD) will be calculated when comparing characteristics of study cohorts, with plots comparing the mean values of characteristics for each of the characteristics (with the color indicating the absolute value of the standardized difference of the mean).\nBaseline disease characteristics at diagnosis will be reported using medians and proportions for non-normally distributed continuous variables and categorical variables, respectively.\nThe median follow- will be computed for the overall study cohort. The absolute number of patients who experienced overall mortality, cancer-specific mortality, other-cause mortality and disease progression will be reported.\nKaplan-Meier analyses will assess time from PCa diagnosis to overall survival, cancer-specific survival, other-cause-mortality-free survival and symptomatic progression-free survival and time to palliative or curative treatment initiation

For this, we computed precision-recall curves for classifying control samples into 'low amplification' and 'high amplification' based on reads mapped to RNA amplicons but ignoring mapping to genomic sequence, if applicable. The \u2018low amplification\u2019 group contained all negative controls (H2O controls) and the \u2018high amplification\u2019 group comprised HEK293T and synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA controls. For each run, we obtained the total mapped read threshold (including reads mapping to both human and viral amplicons) associated with the highest F1 score, representing the point with optimal balance of precision and recall. Samples with reads lower than this threshold were removed from subsequent steps due to insufficient total amplicon read count. The scripts related to this step can be found at\nhttps://github.com/UBrau/ModelPerformance\n4\n.\n4-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determining positive and negative samples: We used viral read counts (total reads mapping to all three viral amplicons) from negative (H2O and HEK293T) and positive (synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA dilutions) internal controls for each run to calculate optimum cut-off for viral reads by PROC algorithm\n5\n, which defines the threshold for optimum PPV (positive predictive value) and NPV (negative predictive value) for diagnostic tests. Thus, a sample was labelled positive if it had viral reads above the viral read threshold; negative if it had viral reads below the viral read threshold and human reads above the mapped read threshold; and inconclusive if it had both viral and human reads below the respective thresholds.\n5-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample classification by heatmap clustering: We used the \u2018pheatmap\u2019 R package (\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap\n) to generate heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the samples. Viral and control amplicons log\n10\n(mapped reads+1), were used to analyze and classify all samples including patient samples, negative and positive controls. Samples that did not pass the RNA QC threshold (analysis steps 3-4) were excluded from the analysis.\n6-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viral mutation assessment: To assess full length amplicons, paired end reads were stitched together by matching the last 12 nucleotides of read1 sequences to the reverse complement of read2 sequences.

The colonies that pop up on the control plate can also be used as negative control for the colony PCR indicated below.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nVI) Check the insertion of gRNA into bRA plasmids by colony PCR using the following primers\r\n\n\na) Forward gRNA oligo \\(5\u2019NNN\u2026NNNGTTTT 3\u2019)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nb) AGCTGAATGAAGCCATACCAAACGA \\(Ampicillin reverse primer)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe percent of correct colonies is ~50-70%.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nV) Pick two colonies confirmed by PCR, and extract the plasmids. Send them for sequencing for further confirmation. Universal M13 primer can be used for sequencing. Check for the disruption of BplI cut site and make sure that gRNA sequence is inserted.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIntegration of mutations to the genome by using Cas9\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn our experience, variations of this method can be used to introduce small \\(100 bp) or large \\(800 bp and probably larger) deletions, insertions, or point mutations. For de novo mutations, 80mers or gblocks \\(larger dsDNA oligomers) can be used. But any DNA sequence that has homology to the site that you want to manipulate can serve as a template for Cas9-directed gene manipulation. For example, this template sequence can be amplified from a plasmid and a PCR product can be transformed in the cell together with the Cas9 plasmid.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nI) Pick a gRNA sequence that is nearby to the sequence that you want to modify. This is the site that Cas9 will bind and cut. Make sure that the sequence is flanked by a PAM sequence \\(NGG), has a relatively high GC content and is unique. The PAM could be on either the Watson or Crick strand; facing towards or away from the site you\u2019d like to manipulate.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nII) Clone the gRNA sequence into the BplI site of bRA89 or bRA90 plasmid as indicated above. The plasmids are essentially the same; but bRA90 is marked with LEU2, and bRA89 is marked with HPH. These plasmids have Cas9 under the control of Pgk1 promoter that is constitutively active. This means, after the plasmid is transformed in the cell, Cas9 will be produced and will continuously cut the targeted sequence. In the absence of a template, most survivors on the transformation plate will have a deletion by NHEJ. If you wish to make small templated modifications of the sequence, you need to make sure that you modify the gRNA or NGG site that Cas9 will bind in the genome together with the sequence you want to alter.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIII) For introducing deletions, design an single-stranded 80mer template that just consists of 40nts upstream and 40nts downstream of the sequence that you want to delete. In this case, it is more convenient to design the Cas9 gRNA so that it falls within the deletion. Because this way, after the Cas9-directed repair event is complete, gRNA sequence in the genome will be disrupted and Cas9 cannot cut this sequence again.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nExample sequence:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGenomic sequence: nnn-40nts-nnnn\u2014-sequence to be deleted\u2014\u2014mmmmm-40nts-mmmm\r\n\n\n80mer template: nnn-40nts-nnnn mmmmm-40nts-mmmm\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nYou can order the 80mer as a standard oligo, dilute it to 100uM, transform\n30\u03bcl of this together with\n15\u03bcl of purified Cas9 plasmid. Plate the cells directly on LEU2 dropout medium for bRA90. For bRA89, plate on YEPD and replica-plate on HPH the next day.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFollow the same steps for integrations, and design cassettes that have ~40bps homology on both sides of the sequence you want to integrate. However, in the integration case, you have to mutate the gRNA site in the genome to prevent continuous Cas9 cutting. If the gRNA sequence does not fall into an ORF, the easiest way of doing this is to mutate it to random nucleotides. But keep in mind that not all the codons are used equally, so taking advantage of yeast codon table could be useful.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIV) Confirm the genetic manipulation integrated into the genome with Cas9 first by PCR and then sequencing. For large insertions or deletions, you can design PCR reactions that will give products that differ in size depending on the success of Cas9 targeting. For point mutations, you can design oligos that will only anneal to the mutated sequence \\(i.e. falls exactly on the point mutation). You run a gradient PCR to find the best working conditions. You should include a negative control in order to evaluate the results.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAlso, it is good practice to lose the Cas9 plasmid from the cell. For this, streak the cells onto YEPD and screen for the colonies that are Leu- or HPH- \\(depending on the bRA plasmid used). Plasmid retention rate for bRA89/90 is around 70-80%.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAs a final note; some gRNA sequences fail for unknown reasons \\(~10%). Nucleosome positioning and possibly other protein binding at the cleavage site can impair cutting.", "PROCEDURE\r\n\n\nCell maintenance and preparation\r\n\n\n1.

Centrifuge the cell suspension under 1500 rpm for 5 min.\r\n  5. Remove the supernatant and use fresh DMEM supplied with 10% FBS to re-suspend the cell pellet. \r\n  \r\n\n\nFabrication of microfluidic circulatory system\r\n\n\n1. Microfluidic silicon master is fabricated by using the standard soft lithography technique. The microfluidic device is designed to contain a wide straight channel with 100 \u00b5m width and a constriction channel with 800 \u00b5m length and 20 \u00b5m width. The height of the microchannel is 37 \u00b5m everywhere.\r\n  2. Prepare the PDMS pre-gel reagent by mixing the polymerase base and curing agent at the weight ratio of 10:1. Well mix the reagent by sufficient stirring.\r\n  3. Vacuum the well-mixed PDMS reagent for 60 minutes to remove the air bubbles.\r\n  4. Pour the PDMS pre-gel reagent on the silicon master and incubate in oven at 85 \u00b0C for 1 hour for gelling.\r\n  5. Cut and peel off the PDMS replica from silicon master. \r\n  6. Punch the inlet and outlet holes by using biopsy. Clean the surface using tape.\r\n  7. Attach the PDMS replica to clean glass slide by plasma treatment for 1 minute.\r\n  8. Post-bake the attached microfluidic device at 85 \u00b0C for 1 hour. This will ensure the attachment is strong enough for bearing the flow pressure.\r\n  9. Insert two segments of polyethylene tubing into the inlet and outlet of the microfluidic device respectively.\r\n  10. Connect the ends of two segments of polyethylene tubing with a large silicon tubing by using adaptors. The connection ensures a close-loop circulatory system.\r\n  Tip: Smaller tubing is for connecting PDMS microfluidics device, whereas larger soft silicon tubing is for wrapping on the pump that ensures the driving forces provided by squeezing. \r\n\n\n11. Wrap the silicon tubing on the rollers of peristaltic pump.\r\n  \r\n\n\nCirculation of cell suspension\r\n\n\n1. Pull out one side of the polyethylene tubing. Sterilize all tubing and microfluidic devices by injecting 70% ethanol for 10 minutes. \r\n  2. Rinse the tubing and device by running 1X PBS. \r\n  Tip: Air bubbles should be pushed out and removed by injecting PBS solution.\r\n\n\n3. Inject cell suspension into the circulatory system.\r\n  Tip: Cells suspension sample should be dispersed again by using the pipette. Because during the sterilization of the device, cells may start to settle at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. When inject the cell suspension, PBS residue would be pushed out and removed. When the solution with pink color starts to come out, it means the cell suspension has filled the whole setup. \r\n\n\n4. Re-connect the microfluidic device with the end of polyethylene tubing that has been pulled out for sterilization and injection.\r\n  5. Wrap the silicone tubing on the roller of the peristaltic pump. \r\n  6. Sterilize the peristaltic pump and outer surface of microfluidic circulatory system by swiping 70% ethanol. \r\n  7. Place the microfluidic device and peristaltic pump into the incubator with 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\r\n  8. Start circulation by manipulating the peristaltic pump.\r\n  9. The flow rate of circulation can be controlled by changing the rotating speed \\(revolution per minute \\(rpm)) of the roller in the peristaltic pump. Peristaltic speed of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 rpm is used for the circulation in our experiment. Wall shear stress can be calculated based on the peristaltic speed of circulation and the geometry of microfluidic channel. \r\n  \r\n\n\nDetermination of cell viability and growth after circulation\r\n\n\n1. When the circulation is done, pull out polyethylene tubing. Use syringe needle insert into one side of the tubing and put the other side into petri dish or centrifuge tube. Use syringe containing sterile air blow the cell suspension out.\r\n  2. Use Live/Dead assays to treat the cell collection after 1 hour sediment.\r\n  3. Determine cell viability by using confocal microscope.\r\n  4. To determine the cell proliferation, cell suspension are collected in petri dish containing fresh DMEM culture medium.\r\n  5. Incubate the sample for 2 hours for sediment in on-stage incubator with 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. \r\n  6. Record time-lapse video of cell growth in petri dish for 16 hours by using camera mounted on fluorescent microscope.

Shake tubes vigorously by hand for 15 seconds and incubate them at 15 to 30\u00b0C for 2 to 3 minutes.\r\n  8. Centrifuge the samples at no more than 12,000 x g for 15 minutes at 2 to 8\u00b0C.\r\n  9. Following centrifugation, the mixture separates into a lower red, phenol-chloroform phase, and interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase. \r\n  10. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase.\r\n  11. The volume of the aqueous phase is about 60% of the volume of the TRIZOL reagent used for homogenization.\r\n  \r\n\n\nRNA PRECIPITATION\r\n\n\n1. Transfer 350 \u03bcL of aqueous phase to a fresh tube.\r\n  2. Precipitate the RNA from the aqueous phase by mixing with isopropyl alcohol.\r\n  3. Use 0.5 mL of isopropyl alcohol per 1 mL of TRIZOL reagent used for the initial homogenization.\r\n  4. Incubate samples at 15 to 30\u00b0C for 10 minutes.\r\n  5. Centrifuge at no more than 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 2 to 8\u00b0C.\r\n  6. The RNA precipitate, often invisible before centrifugation, forms a gel-like pellet on the side and bottom of the tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\nRNA WASH\r\n\n\n1. Remove and discard the supernatant. \r\n  2. Wash the RNA pellet once with 75% ethanol, adding at least 1 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL of TRIZOL reagent used for the initial homogenization.\r\n  3. Mix the sample by vortexing and centrifuge at no more than 7,500 x g for 5 minutes at 2 to 8\u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\nREDISSOLVING THE RNA\r\n\n\n1. At the end of the procedure, briefly dry the pellet \\(air-dry to 5-10 minutes).\r\n  2.

Purify CD11c-positive cells twice using CD11c MicroBeads according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.", "**Examination** \r\n\n\nPrior to freezing, the cells should be maintained in an actively growing state to ensure maximum health during freezing and a good recovery post-\u00ad\u2010thaw. Ideally, the cultures should be maintained antibiotic-\u00ad\u2010free for at least 1 week prior to freezing to help identify previously undetected contaminants in the culture. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Cell Harvesting** \r\n\n\n1. Handle the cells gently during harvesting since damaged cells will not survive the additional damage that occurs during the freezing and thawing processes. Generally, it is best to harvest the cells in the same manner used for routine subculture. Use a laminar flow hood, and CoolBox CFT30 ice free system, which allows the preparation of cryovials at <-\u00ad\u20104\u00b0C without the mess of an ice bucket.\r\n   2. Prepare freezing medium and store at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C until use. There are several common media used to freeze cells \\(see below); however, in general a typical media contains 90% serum + 10% cryoprotectant. Cryoprotective agents reduce the freezing point of the medium and also allow a slower cooling rate, greatly reducing the risk of ice crystal formation, which can damage cells and cause cell death during freezing.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**For serum-containing medium, the constituents may be as follows**: \uf095\uf020complete medium containing 10% glycerol \r\n\n\n\uf095\uf020complete medium containing 10% DMSO \\(Dimethylsulfoxide) \r\n\n\n\uf095\uf02050% cell-\u00ad\u2010conditioned medium with 50% fresh medium with 10% glycerol or 10 % DMSO **NOTE: ** Always use the recommended freezing medium for cryopreserving your cells. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Determine the total number of cells and % viability using a hemacytometer or cell counter and Trypan Blue exclusion. According to the desired viable cell density, calculate the required volume of freezing medium. In general, allow 1ml of freezing medium for each vial. \r\n  4. Centrifuge the cell suspension at approximately 100\u2013200 \u00d7 g for 5 to 10 minutes. Aseptically decant supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend the cell pellet in the appropriate cryoprotective freezing medium to give a final cell concentration between 2 and 4 x 10\n6\ncells/ml. **NOTE:** Centrifugation speed and duration varies depending on the cell type. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Cell Freezing and Storage** \r\n\n\n1. Label the cryovials so that one can recognize the contents of the vials from the writing on the top of the vial. Place cryovials into the CoolRack CFT30 within the CoolBox CFT30 ice free cooling station. \r\n  2. Aliquot 1ml of cell suspension in cryoprotective freezing medium into each of the cryovials. As you aliquot them, frequently and gently mix the cells to maintain a homogeneous cell suspension. \r\n  3. Freeze the cells at a cooling rate of -\u00ad\u20101oC/min using CoolCell\u00ae alcohol-\u00ad\u2010free cell freezing container in a -\u00ad\u201080oC freezer or dry ice locker; a suitable alternative to a programmable rate controlled freezer. \r\n  4. Making sure the solid core of the CoolCell \\(black ring) is at room temperature and seated in the bottom of the central cavity, place sample vials containing 1ml of cell suspension in each well. The sample vials should not extend above the CoolCell body. **NOTE: ** The 12 chambers within the CoolCell and sample tubes should be dry to avoid tube sticking upon freezing. In order to ensure a radially symmetric cooling rate, all vials should contain an equal volume of media, including the \u201cblank\u201d vials which can be stored and re-\u00ad\u2010used at a later date when extra vials are needed to fill CoolCell. \r\n  5. Fully seal the lid on the CoolCell and put the CoolCell into a -\u00ad\u201080oC freezer or dry ice locker, making sure that there is at least 1 inch of free space clearance around the CoolCell. \r\n  6. Store CoolCell container in a -\u00ad\u201080oC freezer for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours prior to transfer to an archive storage such as a freezer capable of continually maintaining temperature below -\u00ad\u2010130\u00b0C or a gaseous phase liquid nitrogen storage vessel. **NOTE:** Always use dry ice to transfer the cells to permanent storage to avoid temperature rise and cell damage. Cryovial contents can rise from -\u00ad\u201075\u00b0C to over -\u00ad\u201050\u00b0C in less than one minute if exposed to room temperature air. \r\n  7. It is advisable to test cell viability by thawing one vial after short term storage in gas phase nitrogen before the stock culture is terminated. 8. Record the appropriate information about the cells in your cell repository. Records should include all of the following information: culture identity, passage or population doubling level, date frozen, freezing medium and method used, number of cells per vial, total number of vials initially frozen and the number remaining, their locations, their expected viability and results of all quality control tests performed. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Cell Thawing and Recovery: ** \r\n\n\n1. Using appropriate safety equipment, remove the vial from its storage location and place it into the CoolRack CFT30. **Immediately** transfer the CoolRack to a 37\u00b0C water bath, and stabilize the CoolRack with a ThermalTray HP underneath it. This set up will ensure consistent and rapid thawing of all cryovials and aid in ensuring sterility, as the cryovials will not be put into direct contact with the bath water. **NOTE:** Rapid thawing \\(60 to 90 seconds at 37\u00b0C) provides the best recovery for most cell cultures as it reduces or prevents the formation of damaging ice crystals within cells during rehydration. \r\n  2. Transfer the cryovials into a laminar flow hood. Before opening hood, wipe the outside of the vial with 70% ethanol. \r\n  3. Since some cryoprotective agents may damage cells upon prolonged exposure, remove the agents as quickly and gently as possible. Transfer the desired amount of pre-\u00ad\u2010warmed complete growth medium appropriate for your cell line into the centrifuge tube containing the thawed cells. \r\n  4. Centrifuge the cell suspension at approximately 200 \u00d7 g for 5\u201310 minutes. The actual centrifugation speed and duration varies depending on the cell type. \r\n  5. After the centrifugation, check the clarity of supernatant and visibility of a complete pellet. Aseptically decant the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. \r\n  6. Gently resuspend the cells in fresh growth medium, and transfer them into the appropriate culture vessel and into the recommended culture environment. **NOTE:** The appropriate flask size depends on the number of cells frozen in the cryovial, and the culture environment varies based on the cell and media type.", "**Initial preparations**\r\n\n\n1.

We then subtract out the reference from the mapped region by omitting all SNP loci where the alternate allele frequency  is 1.\r\n  4. We then used FastaAlternateReferenceMaker method of GATK \\( \"http://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/\":http://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) and a bed file comprising only regions where the new data mapped to the reference to construct a new consensus populated with alleles from the new reads at each detected SNP locus.\r\n  5. In addition, reads that did not initially map to the reference are assembled using Velvet\n7\n,  with a kmer size of 39 chosen by the VelvetOptimizer \\( \"http://bioinformatics.net.au/software.velvetoptimiser.shtml\":http://bioinformatics.net.au/software.velvetoptimiser.shtml).\r\n  6. BLAT\n8\nis then used to compare the contigs created by Velvet to the contigs created by alignment to the reference and all Velvet contigs greater than 500 bp that mapped less than 50% of their length \\(and at >80% identity) to an existing contig are added to the assembly.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**C** Assembly QC / Contamination screening\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAll assemblies are screened, to remove for contamination, before annotation. \r\n\n\n1. Adaptor sequencs and contaminants are identified by compared contigs to a database of vectors, bacterial and host contaminants using Megablast.\r\n  2. High-scoring segment pairs  \\(HSPs) with E-value <0.01 and length >100 bp are picked. The final alignment length is from the first base of the first HSP to the last base of the last HSP. \r\n  3. The contig  is removed if the identity  is greater than 75% and the coverage  is greater than 40% of the contig, or the contig  is less than 2000 bp. \r\n  4. Any contigs which are on the border of the requirements and longer in length are manually reviewed as an extra measure against true genome contigs being removed. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**D** Transcriptome sequencing and assembly\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAssembled RNAseq ata are used alongside EST data in the MAKER stage of gene prediction.\r\n\n\n1. Transcriptome \\(RNAseq) libraries are generated with the Illumina TrueSeq stranded protocol following the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines.\r\n  2. Raw reads are cleaned using an in-house tool that trims adaptor, quality trims and applies a length filter using Flexbar\n1\nand Trimmomatic\n2\n.\r\n  3. Low complexity sequence  is masked using the filter_by_complexity tool in the seq_crumbs package \\( \"http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/seq_crumbs/\":http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/seq_crumbs/), and contaminating sequences are identified using Bowtie2\n9\nand TopHat2\n10\nbefore being removed using local code.\r\n  4. The cleaned, filtered RNAseq reads are assembled de novo with Trinity\n11\n, using both left and right cleaned paired reads. \r\n  5. The output  is filtered for the longest representative open reading frame, resulting in a \u2018best candidates\u2019 file. \r\n  6. Transcripts are merged using CD-HIT\n12\nwith 98% coverage and identity. \r\n  7. The assembled contigs are assessed for quality by aligning \\(with TopHat2\n10\n) back to reference assembly to establish the percentage of reference aligned to by the reads and the percentage of reads that aligned to the reference.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**E** Gene prediction\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGene prediction  is run on assemblies as follows:\r\n\n\n1. For each assembly a repeat library  is generated using RepeatModeler. Ribosomal RNA genes are identified using RNAmmer \\( \"http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?rnammer\":http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?rnammer) and transfer RNAs are identified with tRNAscan-SE\n13\n.\r\n  2. Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs, are identified by searching against Rfam\n14\n.  \r\n  3. Repeats and predicted RNAs are then masked using RepeatMasker. \r\n  4. Protein-coding genes are predicted from the masked assembly using a combination of several ab initio programs: SNAP\n15\n, FGENESH \\(Softberry, Corp), Augustus\n16\nand the MAKER pipeline\n17\n, which aligns mRNA, EST and protein evidence from the same species or cross-species to aid in gene structure determination and modifications \\(Fig. 2).  \r\n  5. SNAP and Augustus models are generated where possible using the MAKER pipeline and species-specific evidence. A consensus gene set from the above prediction algorithms  is generated, using a logical, hierarchical approach developed at MGI.\nSee figure in Figures section.\n**Figure** **2:** The McDonnell Genome Institute Gene-finding pipeline.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHigh confidence gene selection\r\n\n\nA high confidence gene set  is created from MAKER\n17\noutput:\r\n\n\n1. Quality Index \\(QI) criteria are calculated as follows: \\(i) length of the 5' UTR; \\(ii) fraction of splice sites confirmed by an EST; \\(iii) fraction of exons that overlapped an EST alignment; and \\(iv) fraction of exons that overlapped EST or protein alignments.\r\n  2. These decision-making steps are followed to define the set of high confidence genes:\r\n  a) Genes are screened for overlaps \\(<10% overlap  is allowed).\r\n\n\nb) If QI\\[2] and QI\\[3] are >0, or QI\\[4]  is >0, then the gene  is kept.\r\n\n\nc) Genes are retained if they matched Swissprot\n18\nusing BLAST \\(E<1e-06). \r\n\n\nd) Genes are retained if they matched Pfam\n19\nusing RPSBLAST \\(E<1e-03).\r\n\n\ne) RPSBLAST  is run against CDD\n20\n\\(E<1e-03 and coverage >40%). Genes that met both cut-offs are kept.\r\n\n\nf) If no hit  is recorded the gene  is retained if it had \u2265 55% identity to the genes database from KEGG\n21\n, and and a bitscore of \u226535.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAdditional curation of gene sets\r\n\n\nDepending on the nature of the final gene set in relation to the assembly quality some gene sets underwent an additional manual review of short genes lacking definitive evidence. After the high confidence gene selection steps described above, shorter single and double exon genes and genes annotated as hypothetical \\(with no KEGG nor InterPro homologies) are further scrutinized. A manual review of the Annotation Edit Distance \\(AED, from MAKER)  is considered in combination with the QI scores \\(all provided by MAKER), enabling analysts to make a more informed decision about whether to keep or discard each such gene.", "This protocol has been performed using human embryonic stem cells \\(hESCs), neonatal rat ventricular myocytes \\(NRVMs), and KMBC cholangiocarcinoma cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1.

Proceed to step 12 (HT method) or step 15 (TH method).\nSteps 12-14 describe the HT method (HDM followed by TDM):\n12.\nAfter 12 hours of culture, carefully remove as much 5iLA or PXGL media from the well as possible, and then add 1.5 mL of HDM. This is designated as day 1. Replace with fresh HDM media on day 2.\nNote:\nGreat care should be taken when working with the Aggrewell\u2122400 in order to avoid flushing aggregates out of the microwells (i.e. aspirate/pipette slowly and carefully).\n13.\nAfter 2-3* days of culture in HDM, carefully remove as much medium as possible, and then add 1 mL of TDM. Then carefully remove as much medium as possible (in order to completely remove HDM) (this can be repeated for 1-2 more times). Finally, add 1.5 mL of fresh TDM to the well. Replace media with fresh TDM every other days.\n*Note:\nIn our hands, there was no noticeable difference in blastoid formation efficiency when using 2 days vs. 3 days of HDM treatment.\n14.\nAfter 6-8* days of culture in TDM, cavity structures can be observed in some microwells.\n*Note:\nThe time to generate cavity-containing structures may vary between cell lines, starting na\u00efve hPSC culture conditions, starting cell number, and batches. Longer culture time in TDM may improve cavity structure formation.\nSteps 15-16 describe the TH method (TDM followed by HDM):\n15.\nAfter 12 hours of culture, carefully remove as much 5iLA or PXGL media from the well as possible, and then add 1.5 mL of TDM. This is designated as day 1. Replace with fresh TDM media every other days.\n16.\nAfter 6-8* days of culture in TDM cavity structures can be observed in some microwells. Carefully remove as much medium as possible and then add 1 mL of HDM. Then carefully remove as much medium as possible (in order to completely remove TDM) (this can be repeated for 1-2 more times). Finally, add 1.5 mL of fresh HDM to the well and culture for an additional 1-2 days.\n*Note:\nThe time of TDM treatment may vary as mentioned in step 14. Longer culture time in TDM may improve cavity structure formation. In our hands, there was no noticeable difference in blastoid formation efficiency when using 1 days vs. 2 days of HDM treatment with the TH method.\n17.\nOnce cavity-containing structures have formed, harvest all cell aggregates from the microwells by gently pipetting up and down for 1\u20132 times with a 1000 uL pipette tip*.\n*Note:\nTo minimize shearing force from pipetting, cut ~1 mm off the 1000 uL pipette tip with a sterile scissor in the culture hoood before using.\n18.\nTransfer all cell aggregates into one well of a 6-well plate, and then manually isolate aggregates with a discernible blastoid-like morphology* with a glass mouth pipette under a stereomicroscope for downstream experiments.\n*Note:\nAggregates with the presence of an ICM-like compartment, a TE-like out layer, and a visible cavity are designated as blastoids.", "Reagents Setup\r\n\n\nCells\r\n\n\nPer experiment, at least 3 cell lines are required: **a.** The parental cell that does not express APEX2. **b.** A cell line that expresses a V5-tagged APEX2 localized to a control compartment \\(often is the cytoplasm). **c.** A cell line expressing V5-tagged APEX2 localized to the compartment of interest. \r\n\n\nFor each sample cells should suffice for preparative protein and RNA assays as well as for Western blot and immunofluorescence controls. Thus at least 20x106 cells are required on the day cells are split for the experiment.

Collect and count cells, and split them into standard media as follows:\r\n  Splitting table:\n4. 16-24 hours after splitting the cells add 4-thiouridine \\(4SU) to the cell culture media \\(only to the 6 and 15 cm plates) to a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM. NOTE\\! 4SU stock concentration is 500 mM, so an intermediate x10 dilution in standard media to 50 mM is necessary, from which 2 \u03bcl should be added per ml of media. Also add Doxycycline \\(DOX) to all plates to a final concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ml. NOTE\\! Because of the low volumes of 24-wells an intermediate x100 dilution to 200 \u03bcg/ml is necessary from which 10 \u03bcl should be added per ml of media.\r\n  5. Prepare the 500 mM stock of BP: Dissolve BP in DMSO. The 500 mM stock may need to be sonicated \\(was not needed in our case). Divide the solution into 50-\u03bcl aliquots, and store the BP stock at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. These aliquots can be stored for several months.\r\n  6. Also prepare the 1M sodium azide stock: Dissolve sodium azide in Millipore water. Aliquots can be stored at \u2013 20 \u00b0C or below for several months.\r\n  \r\n\n\nTreatments and fluorescence staining plan:\n7. 16 hours after 4SU labeling and DOX induction, bring standard media to 37 \u00b0C and PBS to room temperature. Have liquid N\n2\nat the bench.\r\n  8. Weigh required amounts of Sodium ascorbate and Trolox \\(see step 10b-d).\r\n  9. Dilute the required amount of 500 mM BP stock 50 times in standard medium to 10 mM, and add 50 \u03bcl of the 10 mM BP per 1 ml of media to a final concentration of 500 \u03bcM BP. Return cells to incubator for 30 min. CRITICAL\\! The medium should be prewarmed to 37 \u00b0C to facilitate dissolution of the BP. The solution may need to be sonicated to fully dissolve.\r\n  10. During the BP incubation: **a.** Make 1500 \u00b5l fresh X100 stock of 100 mM H\n2\nO\n2\nin DPBS \\(dilute the 30% \\(wt/wt) H\n2\nO\n2\nreagent \\(about 10 M H\n2\nO\n2\nin water) into Dulbecco\u2019s PBS \\(DPBS) immediately before using it to label cells. Do not store this solution. **b.** Make fresh 1M Sodium ascorbate solution by dissolving the pre-weighed powder in Millipore water immediately before making solution. Do not store this stock. **c.** Make fresh 500 mM Trolox stock by dissolving the pre-weighed powder in DMSO. Sonicate it well. Prepare this stock immediately before making quencher solution. Do not store this stock. **d.** Make 500 ml of fresh quencher solution: 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 5 mM Trolox and 10 mM sodium azide solution in DPBS. Make this solution immediately before it is to be used to quench the biotinylation reaction. Do not store this solution. **e.** Make 4% PFA in PBS.\r\n  11. Dilute the 100 mM H\n2\nO\n2\n1:100 directly to the cell media and briefly agitate to achieve a final concentration of 1 mM. Incubate the cells at room temperature for 1 min.\r\n  12. Quickly aspirate the labeling solution and wash all cells three times in large volumes of quencher solution. CRITICAL\\! HEK293 cells will be lost at that stage, to reduce cell loss introduce the quencher solution gently and to the same location within the plate. Consider pouring-off the liquid rather than aspirating by vacuum. NOTE\\! Do not omit washes because they remove excess, unused BP probe left inside the cells. Make sure that the washes are performed using the quencher solution and not merely DPBS, so that BP radicals are quenched. NOTE\\! Due to the necessity to perform this step rapidly yet with great caution, we recommend limiting Proximity-CLIP experiments to up to 2 compartments of interest on top of the negative and control compartment. \r\n  13.  Pour the last wash, add 750 \u03bcl quenching solution, remove plate caps and crosslink the 6 / 15 cm plates with 0.4 J/cm\n2\nof 312 - 365 nm UV light in a UV Crosslinker \\(Spectronics, Spectrolinker XL-1500 or comparable instrument).\r\n  14. During UV crosslinking of the 6 / 15 cm plates, fix the 24 wells cells with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 minutes at RT. CAUTION\\! PFA work should be performed in chemical hood.\r\n  15. During PFA crosslinking, remove the 6 / 15 cm plates from the UV instrument, place them on ice and collect the cells with the quenching solution to pre-chilled tubes. Pellet cells by 5 min at 300g at 4 \u00b0C centrifugation, remove the supernatant and snap freeze cells in liquid N\n2\n. Keep the frozen cell pellets at -80 \u00b0C, continue working on them as described in sections 20 and 30.\r\n  16. Back to the 24 well: Wash the PFA-fixed cells 3 times with 1 ml PBS, and fix-perm cells in pre-chilled -20 \u00b0C Methanol. Incubate for 20 minutes at -20 \u00b0C.\r\n  17. Block cells with 5% BSA in PBS for 60 minutes and incubate at 4\u00baC O.N. in the presence of primary antibody \\(see Table 2 for details). IMPORTANT\\! Centrifuge the diluted antibody for 10 minutes at max speed to remove aggregates.\r\n  18. The next day, wash cells 3 times for 5 minutes with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature \\(see Table 2 for details). IMPORTANT\\! Centrifuge the diluted antibody for 10 minutes at max speed to remove aggregates.\r\n  19. Finally, wash cells 3 times for 5 minutes with PBS and mount over 9 \u03bcl vectashield with dapi.\r\n  Processing of cells from 6cm control plates:\r\n\n\n20.

Gently remove the charred residue of the coating using methanol and a Kimwipe.\r\n  4. Mount the piece of fused silica on the laser puller; carefully feed the middle section where the silica is exposed into the shielded mirror target of the puller.\r\n  5. Close the cover of the puller. \r\n  **TIP:** Longer lengths of silica may extend past the cover, so take care not to crush them when closing it. You should be able to bend the silica into the cover so that it sits completely enclosed by the shield.\r\n\n\n6. Enter the following program, then press \u201cpull\u201d:\r\n  HEAT=250, FIL= , VEL=25, DEL=180, PULL=25\r\n\n\nHEAT=250, FIL= , VEL=25, DEL=180, PULL=25\r\n\n\nHEAT=250, FIL= , VEL=25, DEL=180, PULL=25\r\n\n\nHEAT=250, FIL= , VEL=25, DEL=180, PULL=25 \r\n\n\n7. Inspect the emitter under a microscope. The final emitter should appear similar in geometry to figure 1a.\r\n  **TIP:** Verify that the emitter tip is open by submerging the tip in water for a second. An open tip should have a visible solvent front in the internal capillary \\(see figure 1b). Allow the water to evaporate before proceeding with the next step. \r\n\n\n**Fritting the emitter**\r\n\n\n1. Add 75 \u00b5L of KASIL 1624 to a 1.5 mL polystyrene tube. \r\n  2. Add 25 \u00b5L of formamide. \r\n  3. Vortex for 10 seconds. \r\n  4. Spin down in a centrifuge for 10 seconds. \r\n  5. Take the pulled silica emitter and dip the pointed end into the frit solution for ~5 seconds, keeping the capillary vertical. \r\n  **TIP:** The emitter should barely touch the fluid\u2019s surface and not be submerged in the solution any more than necessary. \r\n\n\n6. Verify that the capillary has soaked up a small plug of frit solution under a microscope \\(figure 2a). \r\n  7. Put the emitter in an Erlenmeyer flask with the tip pointed upwards. Heat the flask at 100\u00b0C overnight.\r\n  8. Remove the emitter from the oven and let it cool before proceeding. \r\n  9. Check the emitter under a microscope to verify that a solid frit has formed in the tip of the emitter \\(figure 2b)\r\n  **NOTE:** A thin film of frit solution on the exterior of the emitter may have formed to cause opacity. This will be removed in the following steps.  \r\n\n\n_Caution: the next step utilizes HF. Take all necessary safety precautions and perform the next steps in a fume hood._\r\n\n\n**Emitter packing**\r\n\n\n1. Suspend the chromatography material of your choice in methanol in a 1.5 mL polystyrene tube. \r\n  2. Place a 3 mm magnetic stir bar into the vial.\r\n  3. Place the vial into the capillary packing pressure bomb and secure the lid. \r\n  4. Turn on stirring.\r\n  5. In a fume hood, insert the fritted emitter into a capillary packing pressure bomb. Tighten the nut to secure it in place.\r\n  6. Gradually pressurize the bomb to 500 psi.\r\n  7. Bend the emitter to dip the tip into a small vial of HF. Hold it in place for 10 seconds. \r\n  **NOTE:** Buildup of the solid frit will likely have obstructed the small opening of the emitter. The emitter should have a small but visible solvent drop that forms at the tip after HF etching. Flow will also be indicated by slow movement of the packing material towards the tip. \r\n\n\n8. If no flow is apparent, repeat step 7.\r\n  9. Increase pressure to 1500 psi.\r\n  10. Allow the column to pack. \r\n  **NOTE:** Small particle sizes with small I.D. columns may take several hours.\r\n\n\n11. Once fully packed. Close the valve from the gas canister and allow the column to depressurize slowly.\r\n  12. Remove the column from the packing bomb. \r\n  13. Connect the emitter to an HPLC and run the column at 80% ACN with an appropriate flow rate for the I.D. and packing material for 1 hour, or until the pressure stabilizes.", "Prepare the washing solution\n10 ml\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010\u00d7 PBS (final concentration 1\u00d7 v/v)\n90 ml\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sterile water\n0.1 g\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PVA (final concentration: 1% w/v)\nAll reagents are mixed in a hot water bath or in a pot adding boiling water to dissolve the PVA.

It is very important that all coverslips used for growing cells must be carefully handled to avoid contamination. Caution should also be taken when place the growing side \\(usually only one side is treated for cell attachment) of the coverslip correctly.\r\n\n\n4\u2502 Complete media is then added to culture plates \\(2 ml) without dropping media over the coverslips to ensure that cells keep attached to the surface. \r\n\n\n5\u2502 Cells are seeded at the appropriate final density \\(50,000 cells/ml but may vary depending on cell type/size). After adding cells, plates are slowly shaken to homogenize cell distribution. \r\n\n\n**?

Then mounting medium is used as adhesive, using it only in the external limits of coverslip to avoid auto-fluorescence.\r\n\n\n11\u2502 Immediately after mounting place slide with one drop of immersion oil under the confocal microscopy. \r\n\n\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\r\n\n\nPOINT WITHOUT PAUSE- It is strongly required to start collecting images from confocal microscope immediately after mounting. Therefore we do recommend mounting slides in the same room where confocal analysis is done.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Capturing images with confocal microscopy**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n12\u2502 Run the software with the setting up indicated above \\(see equipment setup).\r\n\n\n13\u2502Search area of interest to include as many individual cells as possible.\r\n\n\n14\u2502 Indicate the coordinates to make the slices for analyzing.\r\n\n\n15\u2502 Establish 1 \u00b5m depth slices and store images for further processing\r\n\n\n16\u2502 To ensure reproducibility, repeat the process described in steps 12-14 until a number over 100 cells is reached. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Image data preparation**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n17\u2502 Run the \u2018Imaris\u2019 program for processing images.\r\n\n\n18\u2502 In the menu \u2018File\u2019, select \u2018Open\u2019 and click in the first section image, so the software will open all section images taken.\r\n\n\n19\u2502 In the new window that pops-up, select \u2018volume\u2019, \u2018surface\u2019 and then click on the \\`blend\u2019 button . In the keyboard press \u2018Ctrl+D\u2019 and a new window pops-up. In this new window select \u201cauto blend\u201d and then close this window.\r\n\n\n20\u2502 Now, select \u2018surface\u2019 and in the flag of \u2018create\u2019 press two times blue bottom of play.\r\n\n\n21\u2502 In this step it is possible to modify the absolute intensity but we rather recommend to click the \u2018automatic mode\u2019 so we minimize manipulation of images.\r\n\n\n22\u2502 Click again on the \u2018play\u2019 button and a new window will pops-up filled with several lines corresponding to the different cell volumes.

For eliminating those cells just select them and then \u2018delete\u2019. \r\n\n\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\r\n\n\n24\u2502 When working with specific cell types, many of them grow either in clusters or they form groups in which many of the cells remain bound one to each other. When this happens, it is necessary to cut between two or more cells. However it is quite easy to identify the binding area because usually it appears as a \u201cvalley\u201d just between adjacent cells thus indicating the joining point. Consequently user has to choose these points and make the appropriate cuttings for obtaining accurate measurements.\r\n\n\n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\r\n\n\n25\u2502 Once user has completed this part of the software image processing of all cells, all data have been acquired by computer. To obtain data, select tab labeled as \u2018statistic\u2019 and then \u2018detailed\u2019 and choose the desired parameter such as \u2018volume\u2019, \u2018surface\u2019 or \u2018sphericity\u2019. A table containing data will then appear. Just click on any of the data displayed and then the corresponding cell image will appear, so user can easily correlate any of the data with the cellular source.\r\n\n\n26\u2502 Data can be easily exported to an excel datasheet by selecting in the same tab the \u2018save\u2019 command. A new window will then appear with the corresponding data.\r\n\n\n27\u2502**OPTIONAL STEP**; It is recommended to save a copy of image using the \u2018snapshot\u2019 command. This will save pictures as a \u2018tiff\u2019 file which can be further used under any other program for treating images \\(i.e. Photoshop, Paint Shop, etc\u2026). This would allow users to compare and correlate data with cells using other programs with a more intuitive interface.", "1. Preparation of PP\u00b5TP\r\n  PP\u00b5TP was made from locally purchased white polypropylene sheet. The sheet was cut into a strip having dimension of 9 cm in length and 3 cm in width. On the strip, array of test zones \\(small cavities) were made by mildly hammering or pressing with a blunt end metal rod. Each cavity was separated by 0.5 cm. Cavity of the PP\u00b5TP had an average diameter of 3.5 mm and a depth of around 1 mm. All the dimensions were measured by an electronic caliper. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Activation of PP\u00b5TP \r\n  \r\n\n\nThe wells of a PP\u00b5TP were activated by pouring FNAB \\(0.0625 mg/2.5\u00b5l of methanol/cavity)  solution to each well followed by slow evaporation of the solvent. The dry coated plate was activated by UV light for 20  min at a wavelength of 365 nm as described \\(1).    \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nCRITICAL   Fast evaporation may remove  FNAB from the bottom of the cavity to the top. In such case activation may not occur at the bottom.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Detection of analyte\r\n  Analyte \\( human IgG, human IgE) was detected by immobilizing a capture molecule \\(anti-human IgG, anti-human IgE,) onto the activated and untreated cavities of PP\u00b5TP, blocking, binding  of analyte  and binding  of secondary antibody-conjugate by ultrasound waves in a sonicator bath operating at a frequency of 40 KHz and  an output power of 120 W. The plates were washed after each step. Color development was carried out by adding 8\u00b5l of substrate- dye buffer and then stopped by adding 2\u00b5l of 5% sulphuric acid. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. Image- based quantification\r\n  The PP\u00b5TP was then scanned on a desktop scanner \\(HP photo smart C6388) by placing the plate upside down to get the image. From Adobe Photoshop the mean value of each R, G and B of the scanned image was obtained which was then converted to HSB \\(Hue, Saturation, and Brightness) using freely available \u2018Macbeth color calculator\u2019 software.

Avoid the use of CO2 because it can affect cardiac parameters. \r\n\n\nCRITICAL. Do not expose flies to the anesthetic for longer than 5 min because they can die.\r\n\n\n2) Dissection.\r\n\n\n2.1) Take a petri dish and coat it with a thin layer of petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly allows to immobilize the flies. \r\n\n\n2.2) Paste flies dorsal side down with the wings outstretched \\(Fig 1A). \r\n\n\n2.3) Put the scissors behind the third pair of legs with an angle of 45\u00ba with respect to the surface of the petri dish and cut to remove the head, the legs and part of the thorax.\r\n\n\n2.4) Add oxygenated artificial hemolymph and cut the genial portion to create an opening. \r\n\n\n2.5) Introduce the scissors through the previous opening and cut through the whole abdomen to the thorax. As a result, abdomen splits in two halves. \r\n\n\n2.6) Use forceps to take out the intestine, reproductive organs and fat \\(Fig 1B). After this step, the heart and the nephrocytes should be tightly attached to the dorsal cuticle. \r\n\n\n2.7) With a suction pump and a patch pipet, take out any extra fat or non-cardiac tissue remnants near the heart without touching the organ \\(Fig 1C). Finally, replace the hemolymph with new one. The preparation can be used for approximately 1 h. Change AH hourly.\r\n\n\nNOTE. Female flies are easier to dissect because of their bigger size.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL. Take extra care removing fat surrounding the heart. If you physically touch the heart, the preparation must be discarded because it compromises the reliability of the subsequent physiological analyses. Place the beating hearts under bright field microscopy. Record 20 s videos of each beating heart with a high-speed camera at a frame rate of at least 160 frames/s. Videos are to be processed using the software program described in Ocorr et al. 2014, which will generate a number of cardiac parameters including heart period \\(HP), heart rate \\(HR), arrhythmia index \\(AI), systolic interval \\(SI), diastolic interval \\(DI), percentage of fractional shortening \\(%FS), end systolic diameter \\(EDD), and end diastolic diameter \\(EDD).\r\n\n\nNOTE. To ensure proper statistical power, record a minimum of 20 fly hearts per experimental condition or genotype. \r\n\n\nCRITICAL. Quality of videos is critical so ensure a good contrast of heart walls. \r\n\n\n? Troubleshooting\r\n\n\nAfter obtaining the above physiological parameters, dissected hearts can be processed for a number of downstream applications such as in situ hybridization to detect a specific transcript \\(A), immunofluorescence to detect a protein at subcellular resolution \\(B), staining with phalloidin to reveal heart muscle fibres \\(C), and molecular methods to extract RNA \\(D) or proteins \\(not described here), and to generate cDNA for transcriptome analysis \\(E). \r\n\n\nA.

The Registry is a component of the work package 2 (ZIKA-PED) of the ZIKAction project, with agreed participation from sites in Argentina, Brazil and Jamaica.\nEligibility criteria\n:\nChildren meeting at least one of the following criteria will be eligible for Registry entry:\n- Were exposed to ZIKV in utero (i.e. mother received laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection during pregnancy through positive RT-PCR, IgM or IgG seroconversion) based on definitions and test availability over time.\n- Have laboratory-confirmed congenital ZIKV infection (i.e. positive RT-PCR or IgM for ZIKV in any of the biological samples collected after birth), with or without CZS\n- Meet the ZIKAction Paediatric Registry definition of suspected CZS without laboratory evidence of in-utero exposure or congenital infection AND who do not have a laboratory-confirmed congenital infection other than ZIKV or a genetic or other confirmed cause of microcephaly or other abnormalities listed in the case definition\nA suspected CZS case was defined if any of the following was present: congenital or postnatal microcephaly, fetal brain disruption sequence, intracranial calcifications, malformations of cortical development (including simplified gyral pattern, polymicrogyria, and pachygyria), arthrogryposis or joint contractures. Microcephaly could be defined according to the Intergrowth 21\nst\nreference charts standards (44) and/or the WHO Child Growth Standards (45), with head circumference more than two standard deviations below the mean for age and sex classified as microcephaly. Fetal brain disruption sequence is defined as a variable combination of microcephaly, partial cranial bone collapse, cranio-facial disproportion, pronounced occipital prominence, very small fontanels, and redundant scalp skin.\nData collection\nIdentification of cases for inclusion in the Registry\nEach site has a research group composed of health professionals (paediatricians, other physicians and research nurses) that will identify children fulfilling the inclusion criteria for recruitment into the Registry. Processes will vary from site to site. in Jamaica, where a national ZIKV surveillance database will be used to identify eligible cases, the research group has applied for a waiver for informed consent for the inclusion of pseudonymised retrospective data. In some, the paediatrician will screen patients in their care to determine eligibility and then proceed with informed consent and registration if eligible. In other sites, eligible cases may be identified from pre-existing national databases of children with CZS.\nParticipant information sheets and informed consent forms for parents have been produced and translated for local use. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, informed consent procedures have been adapted to policies and measures of each country to avoid the spread of infection and take account of the reduced face-to-face interactions with patients and families. In this manner, for example, Brazilian and Argentinian researchers will obtain a signed consent form from the parents of eligible children using a combination of phone calls and courier delivery of documentation;\nData extraction and entry\nThe Registry collects relevant socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data using standardised case report forms (CRFs) via retrospective clinical case note review for mother and child at the time of registration. The information collected can be broadly grouped into the following: socio-demographics; maternal/obstetric history; pregnancy data (including details of ZIKV-compatible symptoms and laboratory results); delivery information and newborn assessment; and history of children's health that include clinical and radiological evaluations (physical, neurological, developmental, ophthalmological, audiological), and laboratory results that were conducted as part of their local standard of care. Wherever appropriate, harmonisation of data items with the ongoing ZIKAction prospective cohorts of pregnant women and their children has occurred, which in turn have been harmonised with other international ZIKV research consortia, to facilitate future meta-analyses (46).\nResearch groups at participating clinical sites will enter the information in a paper version of the standardised case report forms (CRF) written in a native language, and thereafter these data will be entered and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture:\nhttps://projectredcap.org/\n) (47, 48) hosted at Penta Foundation Onlus. Follow-up data from routine visits will be collected via chart review for children in the Registry.\nGovernance, ethical and legal issues\nZIKAction is funded by the European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, and oversight of the ZIKAction Paediatric Registry is provided via the ZIKAction governance structures, with a Steering Committee which receives guidance from an International Advisory Board. The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that are consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and applicable legislation on non-intervention studies. Thereby, the study protocol was revised and approved by the corresponding health authorities and ethics boards in every research site. Local, national, and international rules on data protection will be followed and the General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 will be adhered to, as well as the relevant national laws and regulations.\nData security and management\nAdequate measures to ensure data protection and confidentiality will be duly taken into account by all investigators. The Registry collects pseudonymised data only; patient identifiable information can only be linked to data included in the Registry by the study staff at each site with no identifying information transferred between sites or to the Registry database.\nThe Registry REDCap database is held on a secure, dedicated server maintained by the ZIKAction project coordinator (Penta Foundation). Access to the web-based database for data input and retrieval is restricted to research teams with appropriate authentication (personal log-in and password), following training and completion of a user responsibility agreement.\nIn addition to validation checks built into the Registry REDCap database, the quality of the data will be evaluated and improved by source data verification that will be the responsibility of each research group. Data quality checks will be performed centrally prior to any statistical analyses being undertaken, with liaison with participating sites to resolve any data queries.\nUse of Registry data and statistical analyses\nIt is envisaged that a number of analyses will be conducted on data within the Registry. After the initial enrolment phase, the Registry data manager will produce a \u201csnapshot\u201d report of the data held in the Registry (e.g. numbers enrolled in different clinical categories) for circulation to all participating centres in order to provide context and high-level data to help determine what analyses can be conducted. Investigators are required to submit a concept sheet for any proposed analyses. Children eligible for inclusion in specific analyses will be identified by the Registry data management team. This team may also identify children meeting inclusion criteria for recruitment into external clinical studies, and return their Registry-specific study numbers to clinical teams who retain identifiers of the children and would follow local protocols regarding their invitation to take part in other studies. Participation of sites in specific analyses is optional; writing groups for each analysis/project will have representatives from all centres that have contributed data.\nStatistical analyses are expected to include the assessment of child health outcomes associated with congenital ZIKV infection or exposure. Standard statistical methods will be used, as appropriate, in the analysis of different types of exposure and outcome data, including adjustment for confounding e.g. through multivariable modelling. Varying duration of follow-up and missing data items are to be expected; the analysis approach will depend on the research question and the amount and likely mechanisms of missing data.", "The procedure is presented in 5 steps:\nA. cpn60 PCR\nB. cpn60 PCR clean-up\nC.

For example, ZFNs are frequently applied in research to human cells for the correction of genetic disorders caused by point mutations. If you want to only focus to plant breeding and wish to clean up your findings from these patents, try using NOT accompanied by words like \"human disease\" or \"human disorders\" or cancer etc., as illustrated below:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in full text: \"zinc finger\" AND nuclease?

Search for codes that might be assigned to some patents related to zinc finger nucleases. Examples:\r\n\n\nC12N15/90 \\(or on \u201cstable integration of foreign gene into chromosome\u201d)\r\n\n\nC12N15/82A10 \\(\\[N: Targeted insertion of genes into the plant genome by homologous recombination])\r\n\n\nTo \u201cextract\u201d more codes that might pertain to the underlying technology, observe the list of findings obtained in the previous exercises. You will note from the results list that some of the most recent entries have only IPC codes assigned to them. The older patents have ECLA codes. Choose \"ECLA\" to sort the results by patent codes. Looking at the results set carefully will give a good idea of the patent codes assigned by examiners to this area of technology, which will help you expand your searches considerably. Look through the list and you will come across for example with ECLA code \u201cC12N15/82A10\u201d. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3.1 Only using codes**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nYou will notice that many of the codes relate to broad areas of technology. Obviously, using these broad codes in isolation will give you very broad result lists. Examples:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in European Classification \\(ECLA): C12N15/82A10  \r\n\n\n 1,119 results in the worldwide subset\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in European Classification \\(ECLA): C12N15/90B  \r\n\n\n 864 results in the worldwide subset\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3.2 Combining codes with words queries**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn order to narrow down the list to more specific results you have to judiciously use patent codes in combination with word queries, and also experiment with different fields, like in the following examples:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in title or abstract: \"zinc\"\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in European Classification \\(ECLA): C12N15/82A10  \r\n\n\n 9 results in the worldwide subset\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in title or abstract: \"zinc\"\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in European Classification \\(ECLA): C12N15/90B  \r\n\n\n 3 results in the worldwide subset\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in full text: \"zinc finger nuclease?\"\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in International Patent Classification \\(IPC): C12N15\r\n\n\n 9 results in the EPO subset\r\n\n\n 93 results in the WIPO subset\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in full text: \"zinc finger nuclease?\" and plant?\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in International Patent Classification \\(IPC): C12N15\r\n\n\n 8 results in the EPO subset\r\n\n\n 84 results in the WIPO subset\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFull text searching is not available for the worldwide collection subset. Therefore, you can combine a word with the broader IPC code C12N15. As with all exercises and results, you should manually sift through the results to assess how relevant each result is, as illustrated in the previous chapters.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**3.3 Further exercises**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTry using the search queries indicated in the previous exercises, combined with the identified codes.\r\n\n\nResults might not be satisfactory for ZFN technology, but the scope of this exercise is to give instructions that can be applied to many other inventive fields in biotechnology. Given the variety of IPC and ECLA codes available, other inventive fields could be more precisely represented by their relative codes, than the example of ZFN technology, as yet there is no precise code that relates to ZFN in the IPC or ECLA. In contrast some commercial databases have their own manually assigned codes for ZFN \\(for example \u2013 Derwent World Patent Index, DWPI, has code B04-N11 for zinc finger proteins).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**4) PATENT SEARCH IN PATENTSCOPE DATABASE**:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe next set of examples is designed to gain initial familiarity with the PatentScope database \\( \"http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/index.jsp\":http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/index.jsp ) maintained by WIPO.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**4.1 Simple search in PatentScope**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTo access the search page for a simple search go to: http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/search-simp.jsp. Make sure that only \u201cPCT\u201d is ticked, and uncheck any other boxes. Add a search query in the text box and make sure that the \u201cfront page\u201d tab is selected \\(taking note that a number of other tabs allow us to search other fields, such as IPC classification), like in the examples:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in \"front page\" - PCT: \"zinc finger nuclease?\"\r\n\n\n 10 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in \"front page\" - PCT: zinc AND finger AND nuclease?\r\n\n\n 13 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in \"any field\" - PCT: \"zinc finger nuclease?\"\r\n\n\n 130 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAdditionally you can try searching without the quotes. The front page field usually includes the title and abstract entries. By choosing the \u201cany field\u201d option in the banner, the search is performed in the entire text of the patent.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**4.2 Combining fields**:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nA more useful approach is to choose the \u201csearch\u201d option in the header of the page and choose the \u201cfield combination\u201d option. This takes you to a page that helps you combine various fields in the searches: http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/search/en/structuredSearch.jsf \r\n\n\nOn the left, through drop down lists, it is possible to change the default fields shown. This makes it possible to combine same or different fields. Also it is possible to combine the fields through either Boolean operators AND /OR. Again make sure that only the PCT option is selected, rather than national collections. Amongst the fields, \u201cInternational Class\u201d will allow you to enter IPC codes, although it may be possible that lower level hierarchy codes or the more detailed codes will not work. Here you can experiment, as in the example:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in \"any field\": \"zinc finger nuclease?\"\r\n\n\n 130 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThen you can redo the same search but by adding \u201cplant\u201d to the \"English claims\" field, which narrows down the results:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in \"any field\": \"zinc finger nuclease?\"\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in \"English claims\": plant?\r\n\n\n 7 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nYou can also combine search queries and codes, as you did for esp@cenet. Select the field \"International Class\" and insert the codes identified previously, like C12N-15/90 \\(note this format is somewhat different from ECLA code shown in an earlier example when searching esp@cenet). You can combine that with \"plant\" in the claim field:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in \"International Class\": C12N-15/90\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in \"English claims\": plant?\r\n\n\n 29 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in \"International Class\": C12N-15/82\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in \"English claims\": plant?\r\n\n\n 2,526 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe records will most likely cover some means of integrating DNA into the chromosome \u2013 and combining it with \u201cplant\u201d in claims would mean all of these include the word \u201cplant\u201d in at least one of the claims.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**4.3 Combining claims**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nYou can select twice, in two different drop down boxes, the field \"English claim\" and introduce different queries like in the example:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 Keyword\\(s) in \" English claims \": \"zinc finger\"\r\n\n\n Keyword\\(s) in \"English claims\": plant?\r\n\n\n 35 results in PatentScope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIn this case, a similar result would be obtained by using the Boolean operator AND in the same field.\r\n\n\nSearching the word \"plant\" in the claims would likely pick up patents where the claimed technology is also directed to the use in plants. But you have to consider the possibility that the claims may include a word such as \u201cArabidopsis\u201d or \u201cZea Mays\u201d instead of \u201cplant.\u201d Therefore, one can also try making the searches previously illustrated, but substituting the word \"plant\" with specific plant names in the queries.", "1.Using a cryostat, cut the lumbar segments where the double-infected cell bodies reside \\(e.g. L2 for L2-L5 interneurons).

First, create an ANSI C++ algorithm \\(Balagurusamy 2004) in the Turbo C++ v.3.0 software \\(Borland International Inc., USA) to calculate the correlation between real time hypergravity values and corresponding values of centrifugal speed \\(in RPM or revolutions per minute) to be used for exposing the _Limnaea_ eggs to increased gravity conditions \\(relative centrifugal force or RCF) inside an ultracentrifuge. Following algorithm must be entered into the Turbo C++ v.3.0 software to run this, \u201cProgram for Calculation of Centrifugal RPM with respect to Hypergravity\u201d:\r\n      \r\n\n\n    #include_<iostream.h>\r\n\n\n    #include_<math.h>\r\n\n\n    void_main\\()\r\n\n\n    \\{\r\n\n\n    float RCF, rpm, r, b, e;\r\n\n\ncout<<\u201dProgram for calculation of REVOLUTIONS PER MIN. with respect  to HYPERGRAVITY\u201d<<\u201d\\n\\n\u201d;\r\n\n\ndo\\{\r\n\n\ncout<<\u201d\\t\u201d<<\u201dEnter the value of Avg. radius \\(r) of centrifugal tube:\u201d;\r\n\n\ncin>>r;\r\n\n\ne=0.00001119;\r\n\n\nb=e*r\r\n\n\ncout<<\u201d\\t\u201d<<\u201dEnter the value of HYPERGRAVITY \\(RCF) e.g. 5 for 5g:\u201d;\r\n\n\ncin>>RCF;\r\n\n\nrpm=RCF/b;\r\n\n\ncout<<\u201d\\n\\t\u201d<<\u201dThe value of Revolutions per Minute \\(rpm) is:\u201d<<sqrt\\(rpm)<<endl<<\u201d\\n\u201d;\r\n\n\n}\r\n\n\nWhile\\(r\\!=0);\r\n\n\n}\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n2. Once the above algorithm has been entered into the software one may run the program after which the program will ask for two values i.e. \\(1) Value of Average radius \\(r) of centrifugation rotors and \\(2) The value of Hypergravity required. \r\n  The average radius of the centrifugation rotor is provided by the manufacturer with the fixed-angle rotors. On the other hand, value of hypergravity depends upon the type of investigation. Since hypergravity is the level of gravitation force experienced by astronauts in space-crafts, there are specific minimum or maximum values of hypergravity which may be entered into the program. Following is the array of such values \\(multiples of G=9.8m/s\n2\n) \\(Chatterjee 2002):\r\n\n\n   Hypergravitation experienced at first booster stage of aircraft: +9G \r\n\n\n   Hypergravitation experienced at second booster stage of aircraft: +8G\r\n\n\n   Hypergravitation causing fall in blood pressure to 40mm Hg: +4G\r\n\n\n   Hypergravitation that may cause fracture in vertebrae: +20G\r\n\n\n      \r\n\n\n3. Any of above values or similar values may be entered into the C++ program as per the nature of investigation. Once a particular hypergravity value is entered, the program will give corresponding RPM value. \r\n  Conventionally, if the ultracentrifuge is run at this calculated RPM, the Limnaea eggs and embryos would experience that particular value of hypergravity in the centrifuge tube as would be experienced by the astronaut in a spacecraft.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. In order to obtain the eggs of _Limnaea_, visit freshwater ponds with floating lotus or water lily \\(_Nymphaea_) leaves. Turn the leaves upside-down and observe for presence of transparent egg masses attached on the leaves under surface, to ensure the presence of snails in the pond. \r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Identify and confirm the taxonomic status of _Limnaea_ snails.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. Now, bring these _Limnaea_ snails and the leaves along with the pond water to laboratory.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. Filter the pond water and fill it into the troughs. Lay down the lotus leaves on the water\u2019s surface.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. Allow the snails to lay eggs under the leaves, to permit collection of freshly laid eggs. \r\n  \r\n\n\n9. After fresh eggs have been laid, detach these egg masses carefully from the leaf\u2019s under-surface by scrapping with a scalpel or forceps and transfer into a Petri dish containing filtered pond water.\r\n  \r\n\n\n10. Now observe various eggs under the light microscope and segregate each of them into specific groups depending upon the developmental or cleavage stage in which the embryo exists. \r\n  \r\n\n\n11. Initially, note the time intervals between various cleavages. At room temperature, time interval between each cleavage is 90 minutes.\r\n  \r\n\n\n12. As soon as the cleavage stage is identified, put the eggs into the centrifuge tube and centrifuge in an ultracentrifuge at corresponding centrifugal speed \\(in RPM), calculated via the above ANSI C++ algorithm. \r\n  \r\n\n\n13. Precisely note the time for which the eggs were exposed to centrifugation and remove them accordingly when a particular cleavage stage should exist as per the inter-cleavages timings noted previously.\r\n  \r\n\n\n14. Immediately observe the eggs under light microscope to find as to whether the expected cleavage stage has taken place or not. Note the timings accordingly.\r\n  \r\n\n\n15. Analyze the corresponding values for each cleavage stage in normal condition as well as in hypergravity conditions.", "**1 - Cell fixation**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFixation can be performed using options A, B or C depending if adherent cell cultures \\(A), cell suspensions \\(B) \\(including cells purified from tissues of sorted cells) or whole tissues \\(C) are used:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**A - Adherent cell cultures**\r\n\n\n1.

Mix the tubes by inverting when the cell suspension sediments. \r\n  CRITICAL: Avoid rotating tubes to prevent the occasional cell stickiness that might occur at this step. \r\n\n\n4. Add 125 mM glycine final concentration directly into the fixed cell suspension \\(110 \u00b5l of a 1.25 M glycine solution per ml of suspension; measure suspension volume using a graduate tip during waiting times). \r\n  5. Mix by inverting the tube and centrifuge at 300 g at room temperature for 5 mins. Do not incubate to prevent over-fixation. \r\n  CRITICAL: Avoid prolonging centrifugation time since glycine is not sufficient to fully block the formaldehyde. \r\n\n\nCRITICAL: In case of sticky cells or low cell numbers the addition of 1 mg/ml BSA \\(or 10% \\(vol/vol) serum) and 10 mM EDTA to the suspension may help to prevent stickiness and to increase recovery.\r\n\n\n6. Remove the supernatant by pipetting and discard appropriately.\r\n  7. Resuspend cells in PBS and centrifuge at 300 g at room temperature for 5-10 mins. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.\r\n  8.

Filter the preparation through a 70 \u00b5m nylon cell strainer \\(Falcon, 352350) over a Falcon tube. Wash the strainer using fixation buffer. Volumes used are not critical, but for convenience do not exceed the 4-6 ml of total volume.\r\n  5. When the incubation time with fixative is finished, add 125 mM glycine final concentration \\(110 \u00b5l of a 1.25 M glycine solution per ml of suspension; measure suspension volume using a graduate tip during waiting times).\r\n  6. Mix by inverting the tubes and centrifuge at 500 g at room temperature for 5 mins. Do not incubate to prevent over-fixation.\r\n  7. Remove the supernatant by pipetting and discard appropriately.\r\n  8. Resuspend cells in PBS and centrifuge at 500 g at room temperature for 5 mins. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.\r\n  CRITICAL: avoid processing a large number of tubes at the same time since cell pellets can easily detach at this step. Centrifugation time or speed might also be increased.\r\n\n\n9. Repeat the wash step using PBS supplemented with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail. For very low cell numbers this step may be omitted.\r\n  10. Centrifuge \\(300 g at room temperature for 5-10 mins), remove supernatant and freeze samples at -80 \u00b0C.\r\n  \r\n\n\nCRITICAL: pellets can be stored at -80 \u00b0C for up to a year or more. Do not store fixed cell pellets at -20 \u00b0C since it can compromise sample quality. \\[PAUSE POINT]\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**2 - Nuclei preparation**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n1. Fully resuspend formaldehyde-fixed cells with 1 ml of Lysis buffer supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail \\(10 \u00b5l of a 100X solution). Use a pipette and do not vortex. \r\n  \u2022 For cell numbers between 10,000 to 100,000, resuspend in 100 \u00b5l volume.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Up to about 5 million of cells can be treated using these parameters.\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Quality control 1** \\(Figure 1a): Check the cell suspension on a phase contrast microscope \\(use\n4 \u00b5l of nuclei preparation), or by DAPI staining \\(add directly on a microscope slide\n4 \u00b5l of nuclei preparation plus 4 \u00b5l of DAPI working solution). In this step one can evaluate nuclei shape in a respective cell type, cell integrity and cell density.\r\n\n\n2. Transfer the cell suspension into a Covaris MilliTube \\(cat. No. 520130) containing AFA fiber \\(or 130 \u00b5l Covaris MicroTubes cat. No. 520052 for lower suspension volumes). Insert the tube into the Covaris adaptor.\r\n  3. Set the Covaris instrument \\(E220/S220) at peak power 75 W, duty factor 2% and 200 Cycles/burst, water bath chiller set at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n  4. Extract nuclei by sonication using the NEXSON procedure until nuclei isolation is satisfactory:\r\n  \u2022 Sonicate the sample for 15-30 seconds.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL: some cell types sediment fast in the Covaris tube. Mix by inversion just before starting sonication to ensure the cells are fully resuspended. AFA fiber does not mix sufficiently the sample when the instrument is set at that power. \r\n\n\n\u2022 **Quality control 2**: Check nuclei extraction on a phase contrast microscope \\(use\n4 \u00b5l of nuclei preparation), or by DAPI staining \\(add directly on a microscope slide\n4 \u00b5l of nuclei preparation plus 4 \u00b5l of DAPI working solution).\r\n\n\n\u2022 If the nuclei isolation is not satisfactory, treatment time can be prolonged up to 5-8 minutes.\r\n\n\nCRITICAL: proceed step by step and check the nuclei preparation under the microscope. Nuclei are very robust, but too much sonication leads to the breakage of nuclei and reduced chromatin recovery. We suggest checking nuclei isolation at every 1-2 minutes of treatment. Alternatively, if the cells are very resilient, nuclei isolation control can be done after longer treatment times.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Stop the nuclei extraction when it is satisfactory \\(about 70% of isolated nuclei). Figure 1b shows a preparation of well-isolated nuclei. \r\n\n\n5. Transfer the nuclei preparation into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube \\(not Lo-bind). In case of high cell numbers, split the sample: the prepared pellets should not contain more than about 5 million cells.  \r\n  6. Pellet down the nuclei \\(1000 g, 5 min, 4 \u00b0C). \r\n  7. Gently resuspend the pellet in 50 \u03bcl of 0.5% SDS and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.\r\n  \u2022 The nuclei swell at this step increasing their dimension \\(Figure 1c, **Quality control 3**).\r\n\n\n8. Add 145 \u03bcl of water and 25 \u03bcl of 10% Triton X-100 \\(\n1.1% final). Add 25 \u03bcl of CutSmart buffer 10X \\(NEB). Add 2.5 \u00b5l of 100X PIC. Total sample volume is now\n250 \u03bcl.\r\n  \u2022 Tip: in case of many samples, prepare a master mix including water, 10% Triton X-100, CutSmart buffer and PIC. Add 200 \u00b5l of master mix per tube.\r\n\n\n\u2022 In this step the SDS will be quenched and the nuclei will return to the original size \\(Figure 1d, **Quality control 4**).\nSee figure in Figures section.\n**3 - Digestion** \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n9. **Quality control 5 \\(optional)**: quantification of nuclei numbers \\(optional but suggested for cell numbers higher than 500,000). Store nuclei in the digestion mix at 4 \u00b0C till the final results of quantification of cell numbers.\r\n  \u2022 Take 5% of the nuclei in CutSmart buffer \\(12.5 \u00b5l) and resuspend them 88 \u00b5l of ChIP elution buffer. \r\n\n\n\u2022 Transfer the preparation into a Covaris MicroTube and sonicate 5 minutes at Peak power: 105W, Duty factor: 2%, Cycles/burst: 200 \\(suggested water temperature 20 \u00b0C to prevent precipitation of SDS)\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 2 \u03bcl of 10 mg/ml RNase A, 2 \u03bcl of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K and 4 \u00b5l of 5M NaCl\r\n\n\n\u2022 Incubate for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C and at 65 \u00b0C for minimum 2 hours \r\n\n\n\u2022 Purify DNA using Qiagen PCR purification kit \\(use MinElute column for expected cell numbers in the control sample below 50,000, otherwise use columns provided in the kit)\r\n\n\n\u2022 Elute samples in 35 \u00b5l \\(PCR purification kit) or 15 \u00b5l \\(MinElute columns)\r\n\n\n\u2022 Check DNA concentration \\(Qubit high sensitivity) to estimate cell number recovery \\(1 mouse/human diploid cells contains approx. 6.6 pg of DNA). \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n10. The optimal nuclei amount is 100,000-500,000 nuclei per digestion. Using the indicated digestion volumes, cell numbers can be stretched from 10,000 to 1 million nuclei without significant reduction of digestion performance, so a precise count is not needed. If aliquoting of samples is needed \\(e.g. to split the sample in multiple digestions for cell numbers higher than 1 million) dilute samples using 1X CutSmart buffer supplemented with PIC.\r\n  11. Digest each 250 \u00b5l nuclei aliquot using 5 units of CviKI-1 per 100,000 nuclei \\(enzyme concentration: 5 U/\u00b5l). Units can be also lowered down to 1U per 100,000 nuclei without significant loss of performance.\r\n  12. Digest overnight \\(approx. 16 hours) at 20 \u00b0C in an Eppendorf thermomixer set at 800 rpm. \r\n  13. Pellet down the nuclei \\(1000 g, 5 min, 20 \u00b0C) and remove the supernatant.\r\n  14. Resuspend nuclei in 200 \u00b5l of Nuclei wash solution. \r\n  \r\n\n\n15. **Quality control 6**: Store nuclei in wash solution at 4 \u00b0C till the final results of digestion control.\r\n  \u2022 take 5% of sample \\(10 \u00b5l) to check digestion efficiency\r\n\n\n\u2022 Resuspend sample in 90 \u00b5l of ChIP elution buffer to the final volume of 100 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n\u2022 Add 2 \u03bcl of 10 mg/ml RNase A, 2 \u03bcl of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K and 4 \u00b5l of 5M NaCl\r\n\n\n\u2022 Incubate for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C and at 65 \u00b0C for minimum 2 hours \r\n\n\n\u2022 Purify DNA using Qiagen PCR purification kit \\(use MinElute column for expected cell numbers in the control sample below 50,000, otherwise use columns provided in the kit)\r\n\n\n\u2022 Elute samples in 35 \u00b5l \\(PCR purification kit) or 15 \u00b5l \\(MinElute columns). For optimal size distribution control, ensure to use at least 10,000 cells eluted in 10 \u00b5l after decrosslink purification\r\n\n\n\u2022 Check DNA concentration \\(Qubit high sensitivity) to estimate cell number recovery \\(1 mouse/human diploid cells contains approx. 6.6 pg of DNA). Estimate the total nuclei amount in each digested sample. CRITICAL: This value will be later used to normalize sample amount prior barcoding\r\n\n\n\u2022 Run capillary electrophoresis to check DNA fragment size distribution. \r\n\n\n\u2022 The optimal size distribution is shown in Figure 2, where 70% of samples show a distribution between 100 to 1000 bp. In case of under-digested sample, pellet the nuclei \\(2000 g, 5 min, 20 \u00b0C), remove the supernatant and resuspend the nuclei in 150 \u00b5l of Cutsmart 1X supplemented with 1X PIC. Add the appropriate amount of CviKI-1 and digest for 2-4 hours at 25-30 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n16. Pellet down the nuclei \\(2000 g, 5 min, 20 \u00b0C) and remove the supernatant.\nSee figure in Figures section.\n**4 - Barcoding of nuclei**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n17. CRITICAL: Normalize nuclei between samples resuspending them in EB \\(Qiagen), so that the nuclei density is between 10,000 to 500,000 nuclei per 25 \u00b5l EB. The samples to be pooled together after barcoding should have very similar densities to avoid strong differences in sequencing depth. \r\n  \u2022 The optimal cell density is 100 to 500,000 cells per barcoding reaction. The procedure was tested up to one million cells, showing a slight reduction in performance.\r\n\n\n18. Resuspend nuclei into the calculated EB volume. \r\n  19. Optional \\(for high cell number sample > 100,000 and if nuclei are clumpy): dissolve nuclei clumps using NEXSON. Transfer samples \\(30-130 \u00b5l volume) in 130 \u00b5l Covaris microTubes and sonicate at NEXSON settings \\(peak power 75 W, duty factor 2% and 200 Cycles/burst) for 5 to 10 seconds maximum. This step will enhance the efficiency of the barcoding process. \r\n  20. Perform end repair and A-tailing: add to each well \\(prepare a master mix, of the End Prep Enzyme Mix and End Prep Reaction Buffer and aliquot 5 \u00b5l per sample)\r\n  \r\n\n\n- NEBNext Ultra II End Prep Enzyme Mix \\(green cap) 1.5 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n- NEBNext Ultra II End Prep Reaction Buffer \\(green cap) 3.5 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n- Nuclei in EB 25 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n21. CRITICAL: Mix by gentle pipetting. Only if needed, spin very briefly so that nuclei do not precipitate. Do not vortex. \r\n  22. Incubate in a PCR machine for 30 min at 20 \u00b0C and for 5 min at 65 \u00b0C \\(lid set at 75 \u00b0C).\r\n  23. Perform barcode ligation: firstly add to each sample 1.2 \u00b5l of barcoded adaptor. Prepare a common mix including ligation mix and ligation enhancer as in the table below and aliquot 15.5 \u00b5l of mix in each tube.\r\n  \r\n\n\n- NEBNext Ultra II Ligation Master Mix \\(red cap) 15 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n- Ligation enhancer \\(red cap) 0.5 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n- Barcoded Adaptor 15 \u00b5M \\(added individually) 1.2 \u00b5l\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n24. CRITICAL: Mix by gentle pipetting. Only if needed, spin very briefly so that nuclei do not precipitate. Do not vortex.\r\n  25. Incubate in a PCR machine for 15 min at 30 \u00b0C and 15 min at 20 \u00b0C \\(lid at 40 \u00b0C or off).\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**5 - Pooling and sonication-assisted nuclei lysis**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n26. After ligation and prior pooling, inhibit ligase by adding 300 mM NaCl final concentration in each well \\(~5 \u00b5l of a 3M NaCl solution).\r\n  27. Pool all the barcoded nuclei in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.\r\n  \u2022 Optional: for very low cell numbers \\(< 100,000 total in the pool) add 1X BSA final concentration to prevent stickiness of cells to the tubes.\r\n\n\n28. Pellet down the nuclei \\(5000 g, 10 min, 20 \u00b0C) and remove the supernatant \\(bubbles first to prevent pellet detachment).\r\n  \u2022 CRITICAL: The pellet is very flimsy attached to the bottom of the tube and can get easily lost. \r\n\n\n\u2022 The pellet should be visible and white, also when using 1,000 cells.\r\n\n\n\u2022 Optional: save the supernatant and and re-centrifuge again \\(11000 g, 5 min, 20 \u00b0C) to collect any leftover pellet.\r\n\n\n29. Remove the supernatant and resuspend pellets in 130 \u00b5l of ChIP shearing buffer supplemented with PIC \\(approx. 500,000-1,000,000 cells maximum per 130 \u00b5l to ensure to have a sufficient nuclei pellet/buffer volume ratio; in case of higher cell numbers, add more shearing buffer and treat for sonication in separated aliquots).\r\n  30. Aliquot the sample in 130 \u00b5l Covaris MicroTubes \\(130 \u00b5l sample per tube).\r\n  31. Sonicate for 5 min at chromatin shearing settings \\(Peak power: 105W, Duty factor: 2%, Cycles/burst: 200).\r\n  \u2022 This step may require adjustments for very resilient nuclei or different fixation conditions. Using our fixation protocol, from 2 to 8 min of sonication give equally good results for samples fixed for 5 to 15 minutes; at that time no significant library construct damage has been observed\r\n\n\n32. Recover the chromatin and bring to a convenient volume as desired \\(each ChIP requires 100 \u00b5l of chromatin), or to normalize volume/cell numbers, using shearing buffer supplemented with PIC.\r\n  33. Chromatin is ready for ChIP \\(store at 4 \u00b0C for maximum a week). \\[PAUSE POINT]\r\n  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**6 - Automated ChIP using IP-Star, manual purification and decrosslink** \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n34.

Prepare separated IP-Star tube strips containing 10-30 \u00b5l of A or G-conjugated magnetic beads \\(Diamag or Dynabeads bind approx. 2.5 \u00b5g of antibody per 10 \u00b5l of beads). Note: do not vortex these beads.\r\n  36. Use the indirect ChIP and the pre-programmed method \u201cChIP_iPure_200\u201d. Incubate antibody for 10 hours, followed by 3 hours beads incubation and 5 minutes beads washes. After the elution from the beads is completed, recover samples containing the beads.\r\n  37. Bring the strips containing ChIP samples to room temperature to dissolve the SDS.\r\n  38. Place the strips on a magnet. Collect supernatants and discard the beads. Repeat the step another time.\r\n  39. Place supernatants in PCR tube strips and prepare input samples: take 0.1-10% of chromatin volume and bring to 100 \u00b5l using ChIP elution buffer. Do not use more than an equivalent of about 3000 cells because this can inhibit the PCR step.\r\n  40. Proceed with decrosslink of ChIP and input samples: add 2 \u00b5l of Proteinase K, 2 \u00b5l of RNaseA and 4 \u00b5l of 5M NaCl. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C 30 min and from 4 hours to overnight at 65 \u00b0C. \r\n  41. Purify DNA using Qiagen MinElute columns \\(final elution in 21 \u00b5l EB).\r\n  42. **Quality control 7**: proceed with Qubit DNA HS quantification. We expect typically higher DNA recovery for broad marks and low recovery for punctate histone modifications or transcription factors with a confined binding site.\r\n  43.

Let Ampure XP beads to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min and vortex them well before using.\r\n  47. Transfer each sample from tube strips to cell culture 96-well plate \\(Cellstar, 650180).\r\n  48. Add in each sample 40 \u00b5l of Ampure beads \\(0.8X ratio); mix at least 10 times.

Keep microdrop plates at 37\u00baC until needed. \r\n\n\n\uf0a7 Sacrifice plugged female mice, isolate each oviduct using spring scissors, collect the oviducts in a 60 mm suspension culture dish containing PBS, and place the oviducts into the M2+hyralonidase drop.\r\n\n\n\uf0a7 With fine tweezers, rip the oviduct to release the zygotes and surrounding cumulus cells into the media.\r\n\n\n\uf0a7 Using a mouth pipette, locate and transfer zygotes from the M2+hyralonidase to M2 media. Wash the zygotes 3 times in M2 media and then 3 times in KSOM media. Collect all zygotes in a clean drop of KSOM and place in a 37\u00baC 5%CO\n2\nincubator. Do not disturb the embryos after they are placed in KSOM.\r\n\n\n\u2022 _Perform this step as quickly as possible. The quicker the zygotes are placed in KSOM at 37\u00baC 5%CO\n2\n, the more likely they will develop into blastocysts._\r\n\n\no \u2192 **NOTE:** the number of zygotes obtained, thus the amount of potential ESC lines that can be generated, will vary from strain to strain. Some strains will yield high numbers of zygotes, whereas others will yield few to zero. The age of the females also inversely correlates with the number of oocytes that are superovulated. Using young females and optimizing the dosage of PMSG and/or HCG can increase the number of zygotes obtained. Scale the number of female mice superovulated in order to obtain the number of lines needed.\r\n\n\no \u2192 **NOTE:** The following protocol was performed essentially as described in Nagy et. al, Manipulating the mouse Embryo\n14\n. For greater detail, please refer to this manual.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Preparation of MEF feeder layer for deriving ESC lines**\r\n\n\nStep 1 - Cover the bottom of each well \\(4 well plates for initial embryo attachment, or 24 or 6 well plates for expansion) with gelatin solution.

The irradiated MEFs should be used within 3 days after thawing/plating.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Derivation and propagation of ESCs**\r\n\n\nStep 1 - Two days after zygote isolation, determine the number of morulas present by examining them under the dissection microscope. Prepare an appropriate number of 4 well plates with a MEF feeder layer \\(1 well for each developing embryo).\r\n\n\n\u2192 **NOTE:** Work quickly with embryos when they are outside of the incubator. Early embryos are very sensitive to temperature fluctuations. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 2 - When embryos have formed a blastocoel \\(usually 3 days after zygote isolation), transfer a blastocyst using a mouth pipette into 1 well of a 4 well tissue culture plate. Before transferring the embryos, replace the MEF media used to plate the MEF feeder layer with 500 uL of 2i/L media.

In the wells with attached embryos, **gently** remove the media and **slowly** add 500 uL of fresh 2i/L medium. If the embryo has not yet attached, add 500 ul of fresh 2i/L medium to the existing media. Place the embryos and resulting outgrowths back into a 37\u00baC 5%CO\n2\nincubator for an additional 3 days. Do not disturb the embryos and outgrowths during this time.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 4 - Plate irradiated feeders on a 24 well tissue culture plate and place in a 37\u00baC 5%CO\n2\nincubator. You will need 1 well for every outgrowth obtained.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 5 - After the embryos are allowed to attach and form outgrowths for 7 days in 2i/L media, pick each outgrowth using a 20 uL micropipette into a single well of a V-shaped bottom 96-well plate containing 30 uL of PBS.\r\n\n\n\u2192 **NOTE:** Minimize the volume of the medium containing the outgrowth to less than 10 uL. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 6 - After all the outgrowths have been picked into 30uL of PBS, add 60 uL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 5 min at 37\u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 7 - Add 100 uL of S/L media to the dissociated outgrowths and transfer the dissociated cells into a single well of the 24 well plate made on Step 4. Cells can be transitioned to 100% S/L media at this time. Change media every other day and after 3-4 days, you should see the emergence of colonies. When the well becomes ~70% confluent, either passage the line or freeze it down. We refer to this ES line as passage 1. Check for Mycoplasma at this time.\r\n\n\n\u2192 **NOTE:** Depending on the size of the outgrowth, the time spent on trypsin varies. While dissociating the cells, it may help to mechanically dissociate the outgrowth using a micropipette until you no longer see the large clump of cells. The presence of several smaller clumps is acceptable. Make sure the outgrowths do not spend too much time on trypsin as this will negatively impact their ability to expand.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\u2022 **Passaging**\r\n\n\nStep 8 - If ESCs are to be split onto MEFs, plate irradiated MEFs onto either a 6 well plate or T25 flask the day before you are going to split the ESC line. If you are not using a MEF feeder layer to passage your ESCs, just coat the plate with gelatin, as described.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 9 - Once ESCs are ready to be passaged, remove the supernatant, wash the cells with PBS, and add just enough trypsin-EDTA to cover the cells. Incubate the ESCs for 5 minutes at 37\u00baC.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 10 - Add S/L media totaling 5X the amount of trypsin used to dissociate the ESCs \\(e.g. if you used 1 mL of trypsin, add 5 mL of S/L media). Dissociate the ESCs into single cells by repeatedly pipetting the cells up and down.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nStep 11 - Transfer the cells into a conical tube and spin the cells for 5 minutes at 1,000 RPMs, 4\u00baC. Remove the media and resuspend the ESCs in 1mL of the media being used to culture them.\r\n\n\n\u2192 **NOTE:** We typically split our ESCs 1:10 or 1:20 every 4 days depending on their growth rate.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Cryopreservation of ESC cultures**\r\n\n\nStep 1 - Harvest ESCs by repeating Steps 9-11.

Various parameters such as Au/Fe salt concentration and time kinetics of the reaction were optimized to have monodispersed nanoparticles. These gold coated iron oxide particles were separated out from the solutions by using a lab magnet \\(10 Tesla). High resolution transmission electron microscopy \\(HR-TEM) was carried out to characterize the surface morphology and elemental mapping of synthesized nanobioprobes. The line mapping and elemental composition studies of the selected nanoparticles confirmed the formation of Fe core and Au shell as single Au/Fe nanostructure \\(Fig. 2).\nFunctionalization of synthesized Au/Fe nanoparticles with specific anti-diuron antibody is dependent mainly on pH, ionic strength and hydrophobic attractions besides covalent binding between the gold and sulfur atoms. The ionic strength of antibody solution was kept minimum \\(10 mM) since the increase in ionic strength effects the reduction of the thickness of the electric double layer over charged surfaces, thus decreasing the electrostatic interactions between antibodies and nanoparticles accompanied by coagulation\n21\n. The minimum amount of protein required to stabilize the nanoparticles was optimized by employing flocculation assay\n22\n. The concentration of protein has a marked tendency for flocculation of nanoparticles in solution.  A flocculation assay was designed by taking different concentrations of antibody solutions \\(0.1\u20131 mg/ml). 100 \u03bcl of each dilution was added to 1 ml of as prepared Au/Fe nanoparticles. After 15 min, flocculation was induced by adding 100 \u03bcl of 10% NaCl and absorbance was measured at 580 nm. The characterization of nanobioprobes was done with Dynamic light scattering \\(DLS), Transmission electron microscopy \\(TEM), Atomic force microscopy \\(AFM) and Superconducting quantum interference device \\(SQUID) \\(Supplementary Fig. S1 and S2). A fully optimized protocol, both for the Au/Fe nanoparticles synthesis and their functionalization with specific antibodies was developed in this study. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n **rGO/CNT nanocomposite based biosensing platform.** GO was synthesized by the oxidation of exfoliated graphite using modified Hummer\u2019s method\n6\nrequiring ice bath and  sonicator \\(1h, 96% power). Oxidation of GO has marked tendency over single layer GO film formation. Filtrate through anodized aluminium oxide \\(AAO) membrane with a nominal pore size of 0.02 \u03bcm yielded single layer GO thin film. rGO/CNT nanocomposite was prepared using well optimized concentrations of multiwalled CNTs and GO suspension drop-casted on working area of SPE \\(Fig. 3).\nA potential reductive scan from 0 to -1.5 V with the scan rate 0.1 V/s was applied for the electrochemical conversion of rGO/CNT nanocomposites \\(Supplementary Fig. S3). The thus formed nanohybrid was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and contact angle measurements \\(Supplementary Figs. S4 & S5). Raman spectroscopy investigated the structural aspects of rGO/CNT modification on SPE. The experimental data was fitted using Microcal Origin 6.1 in order to elucidate the peak position and full width of half-maxima \\(FWHM) of D, G, and 2D bands. The contact angle measurements further revealed the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of the modified SPE surface due to the decrease in value of the contact angle after surface modification with rGO/CNT. A large number of hydrophilic \\(-COOH) groups present in rGO and CNT makes the surface more hydrophilic resulting in reduced contact angle value. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Magneto-immunoassay optimisation.** A competitive inhibition immunoassay format was developed on ELISA plates with in-house generated hapten-protein conjugate and specific bioreceptor \\(anti-diuron antibody)\n23\n.

Nanobioprobe mediated immunocomplex formed on the plates were  washed and acid dissolved for the desorption of nanoparticles from the immobilized antibody by using a mild acid \\(1N HCl) followed by partial neutralization with 1N NaOH. The electrochemical bursting of Au/Fe nanoparticles to release large number of Fe ions on rGO/CNT modified biosensing platform was optimized in terms of reductive scan \\(0 to -1.5 V). \\(Supplementary Fig. 6) monitored by differential pulse voltammetry \\(DPV) technique. Liberation of the large number of \\(Fe\n2+\n) ions were detected by their oxidation response on rGO/CNT nanostructured electrodes, which possess the enhanced electrochemical response due to the oxygen containing groups leading to rapid electron transfer\n24\n.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Results analysis.** Calibration curve for diuron \\(standard sample concentrations between \\(0.01 pg/ml to 1 \u03bcg/ml) was established based on a semi-log plot method.

Production of a phosphoepitope-specific antibody by using a phosphopeptide**\r\n\n\n**Immunization**\r\n\n\n**1|** The emulsification of adjuvant/antigen is one of the most important steps to obtain an excellent antibody. This step can be performed using option A and/or option B. Before immunization, it is hard to speculate which adjuvant system is suitable for the production of an appropriate antibody. So, we commend you to try both adjuvant systems. \r\n\n\nA) First option: Freund adjuvant system \\(water-in-oil emulsion)\r\n\n\n1. After the adjuvant \\(especially Freund complete adjuvant) has been mixed well, load a syringe with 0.5 ml adjuvant per1 rabbit. Use Freund complete or incomplete adjuvant for the first or booster injection, respectively.\r\n  2. Dilute the phosphopeptide-conjugated KLH with PBS to make a solution containing 0.2-0.4 mg ml\n-1\nphosphopeptide. Then, load another syringe with 0.5 ml antigen solution \\(corresponding to 0.1-0.2 mg phosphopeptide) per 1 rabbit.\r\n  3. Connect the above 2 two syringes via a 18 gauge double emulsifying needle. Mix the adjuvant with the antigen by forcing the materials back and forth through the needle.  \r\n  4. Push all of the emulsion into one syringe and disconnect the empty syringe.\r\n  B) Second option: RIBI adjuvant system \\(oil-in-water emulsion)\r\n\n\n1. Warm the vial to 40-45 \u00b0C for 5-10 min.\r\n  2. Dilute the phosphopeptide-conjugated KLH with PBS to make a solution containing 0.1-0.2 mg ml\n-1\nphosphopeptide. Using a syringe with a 21 gauge needle, inject 2 ml antigen solution \\(per 2 rabbits) directly into the vial through the rubber stopper. Leaving the cap seal and rubber stopper in place, vortex the vial. \r\n  3. Load a syringe with 1 ml emulsion \\(corresponding to 0.1-0.2 mg phosphopeptide) per 1 rabbit. Unused adjuvant/antigen emulsion can be stored at 4\no\nC for several months, unless the antigen is unstable. So, we use the remaining emulsion \\(1 ml) for the next booster injection.\r\n  **2|** This step is optional. Collect blood from each rabbit before the immunization in order to obtain the control serum. We usually obtain 0.5-1 ml preimmune serum from each rabbit. \r\n\n\n**3|** Immunize a rabbit by the injection of 1 ml prepared adjuvant/antigen emulsion \\(corresponding to 0.1-0.2 mg phosphopeptide). For Freund adjuvant system, inject the emulsion at multi-intradermal sites. For RIBI adjuvant system, inject the emulsion at the following sites; 0.05 ml per site \u00d7 6 intradermal, 0.3 ml intramuscular into each hind leg \\(total 2 sites), and 0.1 ml subcutaneous in neck region.\r\n\n\n**\\!CAUTION** Be careful for the needle-stick injury, which may lead to keloid formation, especially in the case of Freund\u2019s adjuvant system.\r\n\n\n**4|** Perform booster injections every 4 weeks.\r\n\n\n**5|** After 10-14 days from each booster injection, collect about 50 ml blood from each rabbit. Incubate the blood at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and stir at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Centrifuge each sample at 1,000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and collect each supernatant \\(serum).\r\n\n\n**6|** This step is optional. Incubate at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min in order to inactivate the complement system of the serum.\r\n\n\n**7|** Filtrate each serum sample with 0.22 \u03bcm filter. \r\n\n\n**8|** This step is optional. Check the titer of antibody against the phosphopeptide, by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \\(ELISA)\n16\n. \r\n\n\n**PAUSE POINT** Store in aliquots at -80 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Preparation of the affinity matrix**\r\n\n\n**9|** Prepare one 15 ml tube for each peptide. Swell 0.2 mg of TSKgel AF-Tresyl Toyopal650 with 1 ml of coupling buffer in each tube. The column bed volume reaches about 1 ml. Spin-down the gel matrix and remove the supernatant.\r\n\n\n**10|** Dissolve 1 mg of phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated peptide with 1 ml of coupling buffer. Check pH of the solution, which must be 8.0-9.0. Mix each peptide solution with 1 ml of the swollen matrix in a 15 ml tube.\r\n\n\n**11|** Rotate gently for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 \u00b0C on a rotor. \r\n\n\n**12|** Spin-down the gel matrix and remove the peptide solution. Wash with 10 gel volumes \\(10 ml) of blocking buffer. \r\n\n\n**13|** Add 10 gel volumes \\(10 ml) of blocking buffer and rotate additionally for 1-2 h at room temperature or for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n**14|** Spin-down the gel matrix and remove the blocking buffer. Equilibrate the gel matrix with TBS \\(for short-term storage) or the stock solution \\(for long-term storage). Store at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Purification of an antibody specific to the phosphopeptide**\r\n\n\n**15|** For the initial purification, we usually prepare 5 ml serum. Each step described below should be done in a cold room or at 4 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\n**16|** This step is optional. Dilute the serum prepared above with the equal volume of TBS.\r\n\n\n**17|** Mix the \\(diluted) serum with 1 ml of the non-phosphorylated peptide-coupled gel matrix in a suitable tube.\r\n\n\n**18|** Rotate the mixture end-over-end overnight. In this step, antibodies against non-phosphorylated peptide must be attached to the matrix.\r\n\n\n**19|** Load the mixture onto a suitable column \\(Muromac column etc.). Collect the flow-through. \r\n\n\n**20|** Wash the column with 1 ml of TBS and collect the flow-through, in order to get the remaining unattached antibody. Repeat this step 2-3 times. Mix all flow-through fractions and keep them at 4 \u00b0C before applying the next gel matrix. \r\n\n\n**21|** Wash the column with excess elution buffer \\(over 10 bed volumes), in order to remove the antibody against the non-phosphorylated peptide. After wash, equilibrate with stock solution \\(for long-term storage) or TBS \\(for immediate re-use). Check pH of the final flow-through fraction, which must be around 7.5.\r\n\n\n**22|** Repeat steps 17-21 \\(optional).\r\n\n\n**23|** Mix all flow-through fractions with 1 ml of the phosphopeptide-coupled gel matrix in a suitable tube.\r\n\n\n**24|** Rotate the mixture end-over-end overnight. In this step, antibodies specific to phosphopeptide must be attached to the matrix.\r\n\n\n**25|** Load the mixture onto a suitable column \\(Muromac column etc.). \r\n\n\n**26|** Wash the column with 10 bed volumes \\(10 ml) of TBS, twice.\r\n\n\n**27|** Wash the column with 10 bed volumes \\(10 ml) of wash buffer, twice.\r\n\n\n**28|** Wash the column with 10 bed volumes \\(10 ml) of TBS, twice.\r\n\n\n**29|** During the above washing steps, prepare 40 \u03bcl of neutralizing buffer in each collecting tube. Before the elution step, we recommend you to mix 0.5 ml elution buffer with 40 \u03bcl of neutralizing buffer and then check the pH of the mixture, which must be around 7.5. If not, change the volume of neutralizing buffer and check again.\r\n\n\n**30|** Elute the antibody with half bed volume \\(0.5 ml) of elution buffer using a stepwise elution. Collect each drop of elute into the tube prepared above. Mix immediately but gently in the tube. Repeat the elution 5-6 times.\r\n\n\n**31|** Apply 5-10 \u03bcl per elute to sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis \\(SDS-PAGE). Check its amount and purity of IgG, which can be detected as bands corresponding to 50-55 kDa \\(its heavy chain) and 20-55 kDa \\(its light chan).\r\n\n\n**32|** Collect the antibody-rich fractions \\(likely 2-3 fractions).\r\n\n\n**33|** This step can be performed using option A or option B.\r\n\n\nA) First option\r\n\n\nAdd about 0.05 volume of 20 mg ml\n-1\nBSA, in order to make the antibody solution containing 1 mg ml\n-1\nBSA.\r\n\n\nB) Second option:\r\n\n\nTransfer the antibody solution to Amicon Ultra \\(Millipore). Concentrate the antibody solution by centrifuge.\r\n\n\n**34|** The storage step can be performed using option A or option B.\r\n\n\nA) First option\r\n\n\nDialyze the antibody solution for 3-6 hr with 200 ml TBS. Exchange TBS at least once during dialysis. Aliquot the antibody solution and immediately froze in liquid nitrogen. Store at -80 \u00b0C.\r\n\n\nB) Second option:\r\n\n\nUse 200 ml TBS containing 50% \\(v/v) glycerol as a dialyzing buffer. Store at -20 \u00b0C after dialysis.\r\n\n\n**?

In this case, mutate amino acid codon\\(s) within the matched sequence to different one\\(s) that code the same amino acid\\(s). As an example, we show the silent mutation of human Chk1 in Fig. 2b.\r\n\n\n**36|** To facilitate the cloning step, we generally use the Gateway system \\(Invitrogen).

Arg, Gln, and Trp positions in the 70,952 proteins are determined using a Biopython script. 6.For the obtained amino acid positions, backlocate \\(Lindenbaum, Pierre \\(2015): JVarkit: java-based utilities for Bioinformatics. figshare. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1425030) is implemented to convert them to genomic coordinates.\r\n\n\n7.For each candidate Arg, Gln, and Trp codon, all possible Cas9 sgRNA sequences of the form 5\u2032-N \\(3 to 7) -\\(CGA/CAG/CAA)-N \\(14 to 10)-NGG\\(PAM) on the coding or 5\u2032-N \\(2 to 7) -\\(CCA)-N \\(15 to 10)-NGG\\(PAM) on the noncoding strand are selected as candidate targets. Since we started from protein sequences, codons spanning alternative splicing sites were included as well. \r\n\n\n8.In the end, every 20-mer candidate sgRNA is compared with each other to exclude off-target effects in the exome. Additionally, any sgRNAs with other perfect matches in the genome is discarded based on BLAT12 results. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nC. Production of the sgRNA expressing plasmid: \r\n\n\n 1.Add 2 \u00b5l of diluted oligos \\(10 \u00b5M) in to Eppendorf tube and make it 50 \u00b5l by using distilled water. Transfer oligos in thermocycler at 95 \u00b0C for at least 5 min and cooled down gradually in thermocycler or leave on bench until it reaches the room temperature. \r\n\n\n2. Digest sgRNA expressing plasmid with Bbs.I and run on the 1% gel. Purify the upper band from gel as a vector and quantify the amount by nanodrop.  \r\n  3. Use 50 ng digested and purified vector and 2 \u00b5l of annealed oligos from step 1 for the 20 \u00b5l ligation reaction.  \r\n  4.Use 1 \u00b5l reaction from step 4 for the transformation of the competent cells.\r\n\n\n5. Use forward primer inside U6 promoter and your reverse oligonucleotides as a reverse primer for PCR screening, choice colonies which has a single band around ~300 bp. Confirm the sequence of sgRNA by sanger Sequencing.\r\n  \r\n\n\nD. Site Directed Mutagenesis of the BE complex.\r\n\n\n1.Sequential two-step PCR was performed to introduce mutations by using the following primer pairs. \r\n\n\nP29F-For: ATTCTTCGATtttAGAGAGCTCCGC; \r\n\n\nP29F-Rev: ACCTCAAACTCATGGGGC; \r\n\n\nE181Q-for: GTACGTTCTTcAACTGTACTGC; \r\n\n\nE181Q-rev: AGTCGTACCCACAGATGG.\r\n\n\n2. Add 12.5 \u03bcl Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix ,1.25 \u03bcl of forward oligo,1.25 \u03bcl reverse oligo and 10 ng template DNA into Eppondorf Tube and make it 25 \u03bcl by using distilled water. \r\n  3.  Amplify the plasmid with mutated oligos by using following condition:\r\n  \r\n\n\nSTEP TEMP TIME\r\n\n\nInitial Denaturation 98\u00b0C 30 seconds\r\n\n\n25 Cycles 98\u00b0C 10 seconds\r\n\n\n  60\u00b0C 30 seconds\r\n\n\n  72\u00b0C 5 minutes\r\n\n\nFinal Extension 72\u00b0C 7 minutes\r\n\n\nHold 4 C  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. KLD reaction: Add 5 \u03bcl 2X KLD reaction buffer to the 1 \u03bcl of the PCR product from step3 followed by adding 1 \u03bcl 10X KLD enzyme mix. Make the final volume to 10 \u03bcl by using nuclease-free water.\r\n  5.Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\r\n\n\n6.Use 1 \u03bcl of the reaction from step 4 for the transformation.\r\n\n\n7.Confirm the mutant nucleotide change by sanger sequencing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nE. Transient Transfections:\r\n\n\nDay 0: Set up mCherry \\(low, medium or high copy number cells) cells the day before the transfection in the 12-well or 6-well plate.\r\n\n\nDay1: Once you get 60-70 % confluency of the cell, you can start the transfection.\r\n\n\n-Add 100 \u03bcl of the Opti-MEM media in the sterile PCR tube and add 3 \u03bcl of the Fugene-6 reagent in each tube. \\(These amounts for the one well of the 12-well plate). Wait or 5 minutes.\r\n\n\n-For each transfection, use 700 ng WT-Cas9/BE3 plasmid together with 300 ng sgRNA plasmid.  Gently vortex for 1 second. Incubate the solution at room temperature for 30 minutes.\r\n\n\n-Gently add solutions on top of the cells drop by drop \\(since Fugene6 is NOT toxic to the cells, you can keep the reagents up to 2 days in the culture media).\r\n\n\nDay3: Split the cells in 12-well by 1:3 or 1:4 ratio depending on the cell confluency. \r\n\n\nDay4: Re-transform the cells as day1.\r\n\n\n Day7: Cells should be incubated at least 3-4 days after second transfection to see the effects of i-stop production. Depending on the half-life of the target protein in the cells, this period might be longer.\r\n\n\nCritical Step: For the tet-inducible cell lines, do not include the doxycycline during the process of transfection. You can add the doxycycline at least after 12 hours of transient transfection.\r\n\n\nCritical Step: For tet-inducible cell lines, single cell lines should be produced from population and expression level of WT-Cas9 and BE3 were quantified. Depending on the cell type, doxycycline dose curve might be needed to get equal or comparable level of expression for WT-Cas9 and BE3 protein expression.\r\n\n\nCritical Step: For tet-inducible stable cell lines, 1 \u03bcg of total sgRNA expressing plasmid can be used during transfection since WT-Cas9 and BE3 are already expressing in the cells.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nF.DNA isolation:\r\n\n\n1.Collect cells after trypsinization and wash the cell pellet with PBS.\r\n\n\n2.Resuspend cell pellet in 250 \u03bcl SDS-lysis buffer.\r\n\n\n3.If the solution is very viscous, sonicate for a few seconds with low amplitude.\r\n\n\n4.Add 250 \u03bcl Phenol: Chloroform: Isoamyl Alcohol to the lysed cells and vortex for 30 seconds at high speed.\r\n\n\n5.Centrifuge the samples at 13,000 rpm for 10min.\r\n\n\n6.Carefully remove the upper aqueous part into clean Eppendorf tube \\(it might be around 200 \u03bcl)\r\n\n\n7.Add 500 \u03bcl 100% EtOH and 25 \u03bcl NaAc \\(3 M) to the aqueous phase from step 6. \r\n\n\n8.Centrifuge samples at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes.\r\n\n\nCritical Step: If you do not see any pellet, you can add 1 \u03bcl glycogen and incubate your solution at -80 \u00b0C for 2hours at least.\r\n\n\n9.Wash pellet with 70% EtOH.\r\n\n\n10.Dry the pellet and dissolve it by using RNase-containing water.\r\n\n\nG.DNA sequencing:\r\n\n\n1.PCR amplify the target region with primers giving at least 500 bp PCR product.\r\n\n\n2.Run PCR product on 1% gel. If you have a single band, purify the PCR by using minElute PCR purification kit and measure the amount of DNA by nanodrop.\r\n\n\n3.Use 20-50 ng PCR product and TA cloning vector \\(0.5 to 1 \u00b5l) for ligation reaction.\r\n\n\n4.Perform transformation and spread the cells on the X-gal +IPTG treated LB-agar plate.\r\n\n\n5.Next day, pick up the white colonies from the plate for Sanger Sequencing.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nH. Flow Cytometry:\r\n\n\n1.mCherry cell lines were harvested at least 7 days after transient transfection of plasmids. \r\n\n\n2.Cells were trypsinized and washed twice with PBS. \r\n\n\n3.Resuspend cells in 250 \u00b5l PBS and prepare also positive \\(100 % mCherry) and negative control cells \\(no mCherry) for flow cytometry analysis.\r\n\n\n4. Attune NxT Flow Cytometer was used to measure the mCherry signal.\r\n  5.For the AnnexinV staining;\r\n\n\n- Cells were trypsinized and washed with cold PBS.\r\n\n\n-Resuspend cells in AnnexinV binding buffer and add 5 \u00b5l of Annexin V conjugate to each cell suspension. Add also DAPI 1:1000 dilution into each suspension and wait for 15 min at room temperature. \r\n\n\n-After incubation period, add 400 \u00b5l Annexin V binding buffer and mix gently. \r\n\n\n-As soon as possible, measure the fluorescence signal with proper single stained marker as a control.\r\n\n\nCritical Step: It is very important to prepare the single stained cells to make a proper compensation analysis for each cell type. \r\n\n\n6.FlowJo were used for measurement and analysis, respectively. All necessary compensation analysis should be done for AnnexinV-FITC, DAPI and mCherry before measurement and during the analysis of the data.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nI.Immunoblot:\r\n\n\n1.Cells were harvested in RIPA buffer\r\n\n\n2.Lysed cells were sonicated gently for 1 second\r\n\n\n3.Keep lysates on ice for 30 minutes and then centrifuges lysates at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.\r\n\n\n4.Remove supernatant into clean Eppendorf tubes and freeze lysates immediately\r\n\n\n5.Measure the protein amount by BCA assay for each lysate.\r\n\n\n6.Load equal amount of protein in each well of the NuPAGE 4-12 % Bis-Tris gradient gel.\r\n\n\n7.Run gel with 100-200 voltage in cold room for 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the target protein.\r\n\n\n8.Transfer lysates from membrane onto the iBlot\u00ae Transfer Stack, nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. \r\n\n\n9.Block membrane with 3% milk for half hour and then treat the membranes with your first antibody \\(1:1000 dilute in 1% milk) for overnight at cold room.\r\n\n\n10.Wash membrane with TBS-T three time, each for 5 minutes.\r\n\n\n11.Add secondary antibody \\(anti-HRP rabbit or mouse depending on the first antibody type) for 30 minutes to 1 hours.\r\n\n\n12.Develop your membrane.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nJ.Immunofluorescence:\r\n\n\n1.Cells were seeded on coverslips inside 6-well plates overnight and were transfected as described previously. \r\n\n\n2.After 3 days, cells were washed with PBS twice gently followed by 4% paraformaldehyde fixation for 10 minutes. \r\n\n\n3.After twice PBS_T \\(0.1% Tween 20) wash, cells were permeabilized by using PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 10 min. \r\n\n\n4.Fixed and permeabilized cells were washed with PBST twice again followed by 30 min blocking inside the 1% BSA at room temperature. \r\n\n\n5.Phospho-Histone H2A.X \\(Ser139) antibody is diluted in 1% BSA and applied for 1 hour at room temperature \\(or 4 \u00b0C for overnight). \r\n\n\n6.After 3 times PBS_T wash, Alexa488-anti rabbit was used for fluorescence conjugation at dark for 1 hour. \r\n\n\n7.Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride \\(DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) in the mounting media. \r\n\n\n8.Cells were examined under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nK. Mini-Library Preparation: \r\n\n\n1.sgRNAs were prepared as described previously. \r\n\n\n2.Annealed sgRNAs were inserted into modified LV-sgRNA-zeocin backbone \\(Addgene 61427).\r\n\n\n3. Each sgRNA was prepared separately and then combined with equimolar ratio as an sgRNA mini-library. 4.Type-2 lentiviral packaging system was used in 293T cells to produce viruses.\r\n  5.Transfection for virus production;\r\n\n\n-use 10 \u03bcg total plasmid DNA in 70-80 % confluent cells. \r\n\n\n-add 30 \u03bcl Fugene6 in to 600 \u03bcl opti-MEM media and wait for 5min.\r\n\n\n-add 5 \u03bcg mini-library plasmid DNA ,4 \u03bcg psPAX and 1\u03bcg pMD2.G plasmid in the opti-MEM media and wait for 30 min at room temperature. \r\n\n\n-add transfection reagent slowly drop by drop on the cells.\r\n\n\n-change the media with fresh 10% FBS containing media next day and wait 24 hours for the first harvesting.\r\n\n\n-collect the media for the next two days, and combine them.

Wash with PBS briefly.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Separate embryos from placenta with forceps. Carefully remove the head, visceral tissues and gonads from isolated embryos, and harvest remained embryos. Wash embryos with PBS at least twice.\r\n   \r\n\n\n4. Transfer embryos to a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing PBS, and mince embryos into small tissue fragment by using a pair of scissors.\r\n   \r\n\n\n5. After dissection of mouse embryos, centrifuge 50 mL tube containing embryos at 1,000 rpm for 5 min.\r\n   \r\n\n\n6. Aspirate supernatant, and re-suspend the pellet in 0.25w/v% trypsin solution, and pipette vigorously. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min.\r\n   \r\n\n\n7. After trypsin digestion, add 10 mL MEF medium, and repeat pipetting 5-10 times. Transfer this solution containing digested tissue to 100 \u00b5m Cell strainer to remove small debris.\r\n  Optional; if the solution contains a sticky water, you can add DNase I solution \\(Takara Bio) to digest genomic DNA. DNase digestion helps the solution to go through the Cell Strainer well.\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n8. Collect the solution passed through the strainer. Centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, aspirate supernatant, and re-suspend the pellet in fresh MEF medium.\r\n  \r\n\n\n9.

On the bottom of vial may contain small ES cells pellet, so that you should repeat pipetting 3-5 times in fresh ES medium to harvest remained ES cells. \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. After transferring ES cells to 15 mL tube, Centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. During the centrifugation, aspirate the MEF medium from feeder cells culture dish. Aspirate the supernatant from 15 mL tube, re-suspend the pellet in 5 mL fresh ES medium by pipetting 7-10 times to dissociate the pellet, and transfer on feeder cells. Culture ES cells at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\novernight. \r\n  \r\n\n\n4. The next day, aspirate old ES medium from 60-mm culture dish, and change with fresh ES medium. Continue to culture ES cells at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor another 2 d without changing medium. \r\n  \r\n\n\n5. After 2 d culture, change fresh medium again. You will obtain several ES cell colonies on feeder cells. Culture ES cells at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor another 1 d. Also, you should prepare another feeder cells from frozen stock \\(See Procedure A) for the following ES cells passage. After 1 d culture of feeder cells, change medium of feeder cells with ES medium \\(NOT MEF medium) in advance to passage ES cells. \r\n  \r\n\n\n6. The next day, wash the ES cells with PBS twice, add 500 \u03bcL 0.25w/v% trypsin solution directly to the ES cells, incubate at 37\u00b0C for 5 min to digest ES cell colonies, and add 5 mL fresh ES medium to stop digestion. Then, repeat pipetting 7-10 times vigorously to dissociate small ES cells pellet to single cell. Harvest only 50 \u03bcL of single ES cells suspension, and transfer to feeder cells containing ES medium. Culture ES cells at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\novernight. \r\n  \r\n\n\nCritical step; you should dissociate ES cells pellet to single cell for ES cells culture in good condition. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n7. The next day, change with fresh ES medium. Continue to culture ES cells at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor another 2 d without changing medium. \r\n  \r\n\n\nOptional; you may stop ES cells culture instead of going to next differentiation steps. Then wash with PBS twice, and digest the ES cells 0.25w/v% trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 5 min. After digestion, add fresh ES medium to stop trypsin digestion, harvest the ES cells, and centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant and gently re-suspend the ES cells pellet in the Stem Cell banker solution \\(Takara Bio), dispense this solution to vial, and transfer it to -80\u00b0C. You can store these frozen stocks at -80\u00b0C for 1 month, or in liquid nitrogen for 6 months to 1 year. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**C. Differentiation of EBs with both endoderm and mesoderm. Timing: 6 d**\r\n\n\n1. Prepare Geratin-coated 100-mm dish \\(See Procedure A). After the incubation, aspirate Geratin solution before you start EB formation. \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. After 2 d culture, wash with fresh PBS twice, add 0.25w/v% trypsin solution, incubate 37\u00b0C for 5 min, add 5 mL fresh EB medium \\(DO NOT add ES medium) to stop trypsin activity, and repeat pipetting 7-10 times vigorously to dissociate ES cells pellet to single cell. Transfer these ES cells suspension to fresh 10 mL EB medium in 15 mL tube, and centrifuge at 1, 000 rpm for 5 min. After the centrifugation, aspirate supernatant, add 5 mL EB medium to dissolve ES cells pellet to single cell, and transfer it to Geratin coated 100-mm dish. Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 45 min to remove feeder cells. \r\n  \r\n\n\nCritical step: DO NOT add ES medium when you harvest ES cells. Remaining LIF in ES medium inhibits the differentiation of ES cells, and results in poor EB formation.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. After 45 min incubation, you can see huge amount of MEF cells attached on dish, but not small ES cells. Harvest supernatant containing only ES cells, transfer to 15 mL tube, and centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant, re-suspend the pellet in fresh EB medium, count the number of cells, and estimate the volume of suspension containing 5.0 x 10\n4\nES cells. The number of starting cells is important for better EB formation, please see Troubleshooting. 1. Transfer these suspension containing 5 x 10\n4\nES cells to 10 mL EB medium in Reservoir \\(Corning). Dispense 100 \u03bcL ES cells suspension to each ultra-low attachment 96 well \\(Generally, each well contains 500 ES cells). Culture 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor 6 d \\(We term this starting day as d 0). \r\n  \r\n\n\nCritical step: DO NOT change the medium for 6 d during EB formation.

First, prepare 5 mL fresh KSR medium in 15 mL tube. Second, harvest EB one by one from each 96 well by using 200 \u03bcL ultra-low attachment filter chip \\(MBP). Harvest total 10 EBs, and transfer 10 EBs to 15 mL tube. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min to let EBs go down to the bottom of centrifuge tube \\(wash 1). Aspirate medium gently, and add 5 mL fresh KSR medium. Gently rock 15 mL tube to wash out remaining EB medium from EBs \\(wash 2; also see Troubleshooting. 2). Incubate at room temperature for 5 min again to let EBs go down to the bottom of centrifuge tube. Aspirate the medium gently, add 2 mL DS medium, and re-suspend EBs. Transfer DS medium containing EBs to Geratin-coated 6 well dish. Culture at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\novernight.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**D. Differentiation of stomach primordium from EBs.

Culture at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor 3 d.\r\n  \r\n\n\n14. d 27, Prepare Matrigel solution \\(See Reagent set up). \r\n  \r\n\n\n15. d 28, Harvest stomach-like spheroids. First, add the growth factor cocktail including 100 ng/mL FGF10, 100 ng/mL WNT3A, 100 ng/mL NOGGIN, and 250 ng/mL R-SPONDIN1 \\(All from R&D Systems) to 75-100 \u03bcL liquid Matrigel, and gently mix by pipetting. Matrigel solution should be stored on ice until you use. Next, wash the culture spheroids with PBS twice, and transfer this culture dish under the microscopy. Dissect and harvest only spheroids carefully by autoclaved-forceps. For better harvesting, please see Troubleshooting. 3. After harvesting spheroids, transfer spheroids to 75-100 \u03bcL liquid Matrigel containing growth factors on ice, and mix gently. Immediately, transfer these Matrigel containing spheroids to 12 well culture plate, and make a droplet. Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 30 min for polymerization of Matrigel. During the incubation of Matrigel, prepare FGF-based medium \\(add growth factor cocktail; see Reagent set up). After the incubation, add FGF-based medium gently on Matrigel droplet. Culture at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO\n2\nfor 14 d, and change FGF medium every 4 d \\(so-called 3D culture). You will obtain more huge organoids after 14 d culture, and we called this huge spheroids as e-ST \\(see ref. 2).\r\n  \r\n\n\n16. d 42, Harvest e-ST from 3D culture. First, wash the e-ST with fresh PBS, and add dispase solution \\(BD Biosciences) to digest Matrigel for at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. After digestion, add 10 mL of FGF medium or PBS, and gently wash 3 times, then pick up e-ST by sterilized forceps. You can examine Muc5ac \\(Santacruz), Pgc \\(Abcam), and H+/K+ATPase \\(Abcam) expression by immunofluorescence staining \\(see ref. 2). \r\n  \r\n\n\nOptional; after 42 d culture with FGF-based medium, you may continue to culture FGF medium from d 46 to d 60. You can see more developed e-ST with deep grand morphology \\(see ref. 2).", "Prior to biopsy:\n1.

The same protocol can be applied using reconstituted nucleosomes \\(Figure 1e).", "1. Familiarization phase\r\n  Before each test condition the subjects went through a familiarization phase in order to accustom them to the choice paradigm used in the following test condition. \r\n\n\n- One subject was separated from the group in the testing cage.\r\n\n\n- The experimenter put up the Plexiglas panel and sliding table in front of the testing cage.\r\n\n\n- The experimenter put up the occluder and placed the two white platic plates in the middle of the sliding table.\r\n\n\n- The experimenter baited every plate with the designated number of pieces \\(food or pebbles) behind the occluder, trying to avoid consistent arrangements of the choice stimuli. \r\n\n\n- The occluder was removed and the experimenter waited until the animal paid attention \\(usually, they were already sitting in front of the table). Then the experimenter moved the two plates simultaneously in front of the two holes in the Plexiglas panel.\r\n\n\n- The sliding table was pushed against the Plexiglas panel and the subject was allowed to make a choice by pointing with a finger through one of the holes in the panel \\(the experimenter looked at the middle of the Plexiglas panel during the whole procedureIn order to avoid cueing the subject). \r\n\n\n- After the monkey had made its choice it recieved all the raisins on top or underneath the plate it had pointed at depending on the respective condition \\(see below).\r\n\n\nIn this familiarization phase the subjects were offered only two types of pair-wise combinations \\(7 vs.1 and 8 vs. 2 items) with 10 to 16 trials per session, one session per day. After reaching 80% correct responses within a session, which was always accomplished in the 1st or 2nd session, the corresponding test session with different quantity combinations began.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Testing Procedure\r\n  The general testing procedure was the same as in the familiarization phase, but using different quantity combinations to test the monkeys discrimination abilities.  We applied the following three conditions to the monkeys: \r\n\n\nFood: In this condition the experimenter put up the occluder in front of the plates and placed the designated number of food items \\(raisins or peanuts) on top of them. Then the occluder was removed and the plates were moved in front of the two holes. Thereafter the sliding table was pushed against the Plexiglas panel and the subject could make its choice. The monkey then received all the food items on the plate it had pointed at.\r\n\n\nPebbles: The experimenter put up the occluder and placed the designated number of food items \\(raisins or peanuts) underneath the two plates. Additionally, in this condition the experimenter placed the same number of pebbles onto the plates. Thus, as many food items were lying underneath the plate as pebbles were lying onto the plate. Then the occluder was removed, the plates were moved in front of the holes, the table was pushed forward and the subjects could choose. The monkeys then received all food items under the plate they had pointed at. \r\n\n\nFood replaced: The experimenter put up the occluder and placed the designated number of food items \\(raisins or peanuts) underneath the two plates. In contrast to the 'Pebbles' condition, now the same amount of food items was placed  onto the plates as was already lying underneath them. Thus, in this condition as many food items were lying underneath the plate as were lying onto the plate.\r\n\n\nFor all baboons raisins were put onto the plates and the same number of pieces of peanuts was put underneath. However, we can exclude that they may have prefered peanuts over raisins and performed better because of this simple explanation, as some of the baboons did not want to take the peanuts near the end of the sessions, so we used raisins instead. In these trials raisins lay on top of the plates as well as underneath. The baboons performed equally in these trials and in the rest of these sessions. However, to exclude any inferences from using different food kinds as choice stimuli and reward, we always used the same kind of food as choice stimuli and reward for the macaques, thus peanuts and peanuts or raisins and raisins depending on the food preferences of each subject. \r\n\n\nAfter the completion of each test condition the subjects went through a new familiarization phase to show them the paradigm for the next condition \\(i.e. Food, Pebbles or Food replaced).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Design\r\n  Each session included 5 numeric differences \\(4 experimental and 1 control difference. see Table 1), ranging from 0 to 4. Within each numeric difference, there were four trials with different quantities of items used. The sequence of the trials was balanced and the position of the larger quantity was counterbalanced across sessions. The baboons received the conditions in the following order: Food, Pebbles, \u2018Food replaced\u2019 condition. To exclude a learning effect across all conditions we repeated the initial \u2018Food\u2019 condition at the end. The baboons performed equally as in the first condition, thus learning the different quantity combinations could not account for the differences in their performances. To test the consistency of the results found for the baboons we repeated the test with long-tailed macaques. Every subject received 2 sessions \\(one session per day) in each of the three test conditions. One session consisted of 20 trials resulting in 40 trials per condition per animal, thus a total of 120 trials per animal. The design of the sessions was the same as for the baboons. To exclude any order effects the order of the conditions was balanced across individuals and we recommend to do it that way when using our paradigm.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n4. Controlling for experimenter cueing\r\n  To test whether unintentional cueing by the experimenter might have affected the monkeys\u2019 performance \\(\u2018Clever Hans effect\u2019), we ran an additional control. In these experiments, we used tow small boxes with a lid that opened to one side. Inside theses boxes were small drawers to deposit the corresponding amount of food pieces. The boxes were baited by a second experimenter. As we used the same paradigm as in the 'Pebbles' condition the second experimenter placed  the designated number of food items inside the drawers and the same amount of pebbles onto it so that the first experimenter did not know how many pebbles respectively food items were in each box. The first experimenter  then presented the boxes to the subjects using the same procedure as in the former testing conditions. When the occluder was removed she opened the lids so that the monkeys could see the content of the boxes while the experimenter could not. After choosing, the monkeys were rewarded with the food items in the corresponding box.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n5. Controlling for side biases\r\n  The control trials \\(i.e. using the same amount of items on both plates) were conducted to examine whether subjects exhibit a laterality bias, i.e. going on the same side on every trial. Furthermore, in the control trials of the \u2018Pebbles\u2019 condition raisins were placed only under one plate to discover whether the subjects use other cues such as smell, sight or cues from the experimenter or the baiting procedure, which they did not. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6. Controlling for changes in associative strength.\r\n  Because it was suggested that the difference in performance might be due to the fact that in the Food condition, the choice stimuli had lesser associative strength because they changed in appearance while the items were fed to the monkeys, we ran a further set of control experiments with 8 macaques. In the first control condition, all food items lying on the plates were taken away after the subjects had made their choice \\(\u2018Food away\u2019), and then given to the monkeys while hidden in the experimenter\u2019s palm. In the second control condition \\(\u2018Pebbles away\u2019), we used pebbles as choice stimuli. After the subject made its choice, a pebble was removed each time when one of the food items underneath the plate was given to the monkey. To control for learning effects, we ran the initial \u2018Food\u2019 condition again.", "Sample collection and histological classification\nFormalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples collected for histology of the early-stage NSCLC cohort (Lehti\u00f6 et al. associated publication) were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin staining by a certified pathologist with extensive experience in lung pathology (HB). The classification was performed according to the World Health Organization Classification for Lung cancer, employing both 2004\n1\nand 2015\n2\neditions.

No. 950-124, Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland), incubating the section with the anti-PD-L1 antibody (rabbit monoclonal antibody clone 28-8, dilution 1:100, ab205921, Abcam, UK) and employing an OptiView DAB IHC Detection kit (cat. No. 760-700, Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). IHC for CD3 and CD8 were always done on TMAs but instead of employing a DAKO immunostainer, the tissue was pre-treated with high pH Envision FLEX Target retrieval solution High pH (cat. No. K800421-2, DAKO, Denmark) in a PT-Link Module (DAKO, Denmark). Antibodies employed for the reactions were anti-CD3 (polyclonal rabbit antibody, cat. No. A0452, DAKO, Denmark) and anti-CD8 (mouse monoclonal antibody clone C8/144B, cat. No. M7103, DAKO, Denmark).\nPD-L1 was evaluated according to the interpretation guidelines developed for the PD-L1 immunohistochemical test\n3\nand were evaluated on 53 cases available on the TMAs. Briefly, a minimum of 100 tumor cells were evaluated for each tumor sample (majority between 200 and 400), measuring the percentage of neoplastic cells that showed at least a partial and weak cell membrane positivity (Tumor Proportion Score, TPS). Any cytoplasmic staining was not evaluated; necrotic cells, immune cells and macrophages were not considered in the count. The presence of internal positive control was assessed on each sample, to assure the reliability of the immunohistochemical reaction.\nCD3 and CD8 was evaluated in 90 cases available on the TMAs for immunohistochemical staining and evaluation. The manual annotation of these immunohistochemical markers was performed accordingly to Al-Shibli et al.\n4\n, considering the epithelial and the stromal compartments separated in the evaluation. Briefly, at least 100 nucleated cells were considered for each compartment of the sample and the percentage of positive cells in the membrane was counted. Samples with a percentage of positive cells inferior to 1 were considered negative.\nHistology subtype and tertiary lymphoid tissue (TLS) evaluation on cluster 2 and 3\nIn order to explore the relationship between PD-L1 protein expression, the histological component and presence of TLSs, 21 cases were selected showing different expression of PD-L1 in the proteomic quantification (Lehti\u00f6 et al. associated publication). The histological classification was performed on hematoxylin and eosin sections, following the 2015 WHO classification of tumors of the lung\n2\n. Focusing on the adenocarcinoma subtyping, the subtype percentages were registered by increments of 5%, according to Travis et al.\n5\n. A percentage was calculated for each of the 6 major adenocarcinoma subtypes (lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, solid, and invasive mucinous) in each tumor. For squamous carcinomas no further subtyping was performed. The tumor\u2019s bulk composition was manually annotated, dividing each tumor into epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments, and a percentage of necrosis was calculated. For intra-tumoral TLSs, 30 high-power fields were considered for counting the number of TLSs.", "1) Calibrate Orbitrap MS\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\na. Use the 3D OrbiSIMS control software, SurfaceLab 6.7, to set up gas cluster ion beam \\(GCIB) to provide a pulsed beam of Ar\n3000\n^+ clusters with an energy of 20 keV and a time-averaged current above 20 pA.\r\n\n\nb. Set the He gas pressure in the secondary ion transfer optics to the \u201cHigh\u201d setting for optimal transmission of small inorganic cluster ions to the Q Exactive\u2122 HF.\r\n\n\nc.

Use in-instrument video camera system to find region of interest on tissue section. Optionally, a secondary ion image of a larger area of the sample may be obtained using a Bi\n3\n+\nbeam and the ToF MS to help identify regions of interest for imaging with the GCIB and the Q Exactive\u2122 HF. Note that doing this before the Orbitrap acquisition can result in damage. A low ion dose is needed < 1 x 10\n11\nions / cm\n2\n.\r\n\n\ng.

Start spectrum acquisition from region of interest using SurfaceLab 6.7, selecting the option for tandem mass spectrometry using the higher-energy collision-induced dissociation cell in the Q Exactive\u2122 HF. The normalised collision energy needs adapting to the analyte. Useful normalised collision energies are typically in the range from 15 to 70 eV.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n6) Interpret data and generate biomolecule distribution images\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\na.

Adjust secondary ion intensity-to-colour transformation functions for individual images to highlight relevant features of the data.\r\n\n\nd. Where required, make composite multi-colour images, e.g. RGB, based on individual secondary ion images or summed images.", "**Cell Culture** \r\n\n\nUse standard culture protocols for maintenance of cells. For adherent cells, seed on sterile coverslips for 24-48 hours. For non-adherent cells, cells can be fixed in suspension and attached to poly-l-lysine coated coverslips before antibody staining.\r\n\n\nFor this protocol we used the adherent cell line PNT2 grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded at 1 \u00d7 105 cells / mL in 6 well plates and cultured for 48 hours. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Fixation** \r\n\n\nWe recommend fixing with paraformaldehyde. Cold methanol fixation can be used, however this may reduce ER staining intensity. \r\n\n\n1. Fix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 for 10 minutes at room temperature.\r\n  2. Wash cells three times with PBS for five minutes each at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Permeabilisation**\r\n\n\n1. Incubate the samples for 15-25 minutes with 0.5% w/v saponin in PBS at room temperature. \r\n  2. Wash cells three times with PBS for five minutes each at room temperature.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Blocking** \r\n\n\n1. Incubate cells with 1% BSA, in PBST \\(PBS+ 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature to block non-specific binding of the antibodies \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Antibody staining**\r\n\n\n1. Prepare primary antibody to required concentration in 1% BSA in PBST. For this example we use rabbit anti-Cytochrome-C \\(Abcam ab90529 0.6m/mL) at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml \\(for localisation to mitochondria). \r\n  2. Incubate cells in the diluted primary antibody for one hour at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C. \r\n  3. Remove primary antibody and wash the cells three times in PBS for five minutes each.\r\n  4. Prepare secondary antibody to required concentration in 1% BSA in PBST. For this example we used goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 at a 1/1000 dilution.*\r\n  5. Incubate cells with the secondary antibody for one hour at room temperature in the dark. \r\n  6. Aspirate the secondary antibody and wash cells three times with PBS for five minutes each.\r\n  * CAUTION for best results select a secondary antibody with a fluorophore which is compatible with ReZolve-ER \\(ex. UV or 400 nm, em. 570 nm). We recommend a far-red fluorophore such as Alexa Flour 647. Whichever fluorophore you select ensure that it is not excited at UV or 400 nm excitation. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**Endoplasmic Reticulum Staining**\r\n\n\n1. Prepare 10 mM stock solutions of ReZolve-ER by dissolving the powder in DMSO as instructed on the vial.\r\n  2. Prepare a staining solution by diluting the stock in PBS to 20 \u03bcM \\(1/500 dilution).\r\n  3. Incubate cells with staining solution for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark.\r\n  4. Remove coverslips from the staining solution and mount in aqueous mounting media. For best results ensure some of the staining solution is transferred into the mounting media.*\r\n  * CAUTION do not wash coverslips after ReZolve-ER staining. Washing will significantly reduce the fluorescence obtained from the staining.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Mounting and Imaging**\r\n\n\n1. Once mounted adhere coverslips to the slide using quick-dry nail polish.\r\n  2. For best results, imaging by confocal microscopy is recommended. \r\n  3. For excitation of ReZolve-ER a UV, 385 nm or 400 nm light source can be utilized. For detection, a detector compatible with FITC is most appropriate, or if available a tuneable detector set to a detection range of 525 nm - 600 nm.\r\n  4. For antibody imaging use appropriate settings for the selected secondary antibody. For this example we have used a 647 nm excitation and a detector compatible with far-red fluorophores. \r\n  5. To avoid signal bleed through, sequential imaging is recommended.", "1. Harvest cell culture medium from 80% confluent cells grown in serum-free medium.\r\n  2.

If you would like to identify higher order residue interactions in a PDB file \\(for example PDB ID: 1CRN), go to HORI server page \\[  \"URL\":http://caps.ncbs.res.in/hori/hori.html ]. As 1CRN is a single chain protein, you can select the link HORI - Global for Single Chain Proteins \\[ \"URL\":http://caps.ncbs.res.in/hori/hori_global_single_chain.html ]. If your protein of interest is a multi chain protein, you can opt the HORI - Global for Multi Chain Proteins \\[ \"URL\":http://caps.ncbs.res.in/hori/hori_global_multi_chain.html ]. HORI-Global calculation can also be performed for a range of residues using options available for range-based calculations. HORI server separate web interfaces for programs in three different modules \\(HORI-Global, HORI-Lite and HORI-Cluster) single chain and multi-chain proteins. Availability of individual programs in different modules and computation of different types of interactions possible with individual programs are explained in programs section. Screenshots of web-interfaces of HORI-Global, HORI-Lite and HORI-Cluster is provided in Figure 2. \r\n  \r\n\n\n2. **Enter your valid E-mail ID:** HORI-Global is a computationally intensive module that requires considerable amount of time for computation of complete structure level higher order interactions. Hence we designed this particular module as email based server, where user should provide a valid email ID for the submission and process. Please enter your valid email ID \\(preferably academic email ID) to receive HORI-Global results. Check your email address for any 'typos' before submitting the HORI process to the server. \r\n  \r\n\n\n3. **Upload PDB File:**  HORI server requires a PDB file as its input for the computation of higher order residue interactions. HORI Server provides separate interface for single chain and multi chain proteins. If you would like to submit an NMR structure, please submit Chain IDs of two chains at a time in multi-chain based programs. Due to computational intense nature of HORI calculations, currently the server will accept only two chains for calculation. Users may remove HETATM / ANISOU records from the PDB Files. HORI Server can perform computations on experimentally \\(X-ray, NMR) solved structures as well as modelled structures using software like MODELLER\n15\n, SWISSMODEL\n16, 17\n, SCWRL\n18\nin standard PDB file format. Submit either single chain from an NMR based PDB file as input in Single-chain based programs or enter the chain IDs of any two chains in multi-chain based programs. Please remove HETATM/ANISOU records in the input file, HORI server will not consider these records during calculations, only records tagged as ATOM will consider for computation. In HORI-Lite, Please specify the residue numbers present in the given input PDB file for various computations. In HORI-Cluster, Please specify the residue types that are present in the given input PDB file for various computations. In this example, input file \"1CRN.pdb\" is uploaded. 1CRN indicates the PDB code of a hydrophobic plant seed protein, Crambin  at atomic resolution\n19\n. \r\n  \r\n\n\n4. **Select Atom type for Distance Calculations \\(C\nalpha\nor C\nbeta\n):** HORI Server offers wide array of programs for the computation of higher order residue interactions. All computations in HORI server can be performed using two distance parameters C\nalpha\nor C\nbeta\natom type. Atom type for distance calculation is available as an option, so that user can decide the atom type for distance calculation. In this example, Atom type for Distance Calculation is selected as C\nbeta\n. \r\n  \r\n\n\n5. **Select Interaction Type:** HORI-Global offers different options to compute higher order residues interactions in protein structure. Users can select any of the four options provided in the HORI-Global. The Interaction type options are Pairwise, Triplet, Quadruplet and All. Here 'All' indicates computation using all three interaction types available in HORI-Global. In this example, interaction type is selected as \"ALL\". \r\n  \r\n\n\n6. **Enter Distance Cut-off:** HORI calculations are distance dependent, users can specify the distance cut-off for the calculations. Users can enter any number between 0-14, it is highly recommended to perform HORI computations within a reliable distance of 7 Angstroms. For example Lower Limit: 0 and Upper Limit: 7. Distance cut-off is one of the major parameters in HORI server to identify residues interacting in higher orders like pairwise, triplet and quadruple. In this example, Distance Cut-off is selected in the range of 1\u00c5 to 7\u00c5. \r\n  \r\n\n\n7. **Enter Chain ID:** HORI offers all different computations in single chain and multi-chain options. Multi-chain option will be useful for the users interested to perform the HORI computations on higher oligomers. Due to limitation of computation, current version of HORI multi-chain programs performs computation using only two chains at a time. Users uploading multi-chain \\(PDB files with 2 or more chains) should enter their chain ids for the successful HORI computation.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8.

A typical HORI-Global output page follows that is divided in to three sections as HORI - Pairwise Interactions, HORI - Triplet Interactions and HORI - Quadruple Interactions. Each of these sections provides links for browsing the results and visualizes the individual higher order interactions using RasMol or Jmol. The second link can be used to download higher order interaction data in a text format for parsing or further distance calculations and analysis. In the given example link, if user click on the \"Show Pairwise - Interactions\" link, the section will expand and results will be displayed in a tabular format. At the same time \"Show Pairwise - Interactions\" link will replaced with the \"Hide Pairwise - Interactions\" link. This link can be used to hide this list. If you click on the \"Show Pairwise - Interactions\" it shows a detailed table with No., Residue No., Interacting Residues, Distance, and links to download a copy of RasMol script file for visualization of individual interactions in client machine and visualization in client browser using Jmol. Here the first \"No\" column indicates the serial number of interaction. This can be used as a parameter when user wanted to compare total number of different interactions across different members from same protein family. This is followed by \"Residue No\" column which provides number of residues involved in a particular interaction. Third column is giving details about the \"Interacting Residues\" in terms of three-letter amino acid code. Fourth column provides \"Distance\" in terms of Angstroms. Fifth column provides an image of RasMol logo that provides link to download the RasMol script file. For visualization using RasMol\n20, 21\n, user should install RasMol. A RasMol script file can be visualized using command line interface of RasMol. The coordinates of query protein highlighted by HORI can be downloaded and conveniently displayed with standard macromolecule structural visualization software such as RasMol.  In order to view a HORI RasMol script file,  Please follow the steps: \r\n  \r\n\n\n_a. Click the link \"Rasmol view\"_\r\n\n\n_b. Save the text file. In this example, the file name will be \"hori_rasmol_doublet.cgi\"_ \r\n\n\n_c. Use \"rasmol -script hori_rasmol_doublet.cgi\" command_\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSixth column consists of an image of Jmol logo provides a link to access the dynamic Jmol interface to visualize the interactions in the browser. If user would like to visualize a particular interaction within the browser, based on Java compatibility of the browser, user can visualize a particular interaction within the browser using Jmol\n22\n. The number of the three columns \"Residue No.\", \"Interacting Residues\" and \"Distance\" in the result page varies between different higher order interactions. For example in pairwise interactions, there is one set of these 3 columns, but in case of triplet interactions these columns are repeated three times to describe a pairwise interaction and for quadruple interaction this columns are repeated 6 times to describe the details of residues involved in a particular quadruple interactions.

To prevent primers from becoming un-annealed, always thaw annealed primers on ice.", "**Step** **1** **Co-immunoprecipitation**\r\n\n\n**Timing**:  **1.5 days**\r\n\n\nAll steps should be performed as quickly as possible, on ice and with pre-chilled buffers.  It is very important not to use previously frozen or otherwise manipulated samples, as this will result in loss of interactors.  It is also strongly advised to test the specificity and suitability of antibodies for immunoprecipitation with Western blotting first, and verify the specificity of the antibody for the bait by including appropriate controls such as identical tissues or cells not expressing the bait \\(for example using a gene knockout model).  While mass spectrometry is exquisitely sensitive, it cannot correct for insufficient antibody specificity or affinity or for suboptimal performance of the immunoprecipitation.  Thus the bait should be highly enriched as compared to input and the antibody should be highly specific for best results.  In this regard, it is recommended to use only Sepharose beads that are sufficiently saturated with antibody and show better than 90% covalent coupling efficiency of antibodies to the beads. Saturation of ProteinA/G-Sepharose beads and covalent coupling efficiency can be easily checked by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining. Additionally, the optimal starting amount may need to be empirically determined for different bait proteins.  A very general recommendation is 1x 10\n8\ncells for bait proteins that are equal to or less than 100 molecules/cell. \r\n\n\n    \r\n\n\n1.1.

Prior experience in mass spectrometry as well as in data analysis software is very strongly recommended.\r\n\n\nConvert raw data with an appropriate converter \\(e.g. RawExtract) into a file format that is compatible with the database search engine \\(e.g. Sequest or ProLuCID).\r\n\n\n Search MS/MS spectra against the appropriate protein database with a search engine such as ProLuCID to determine cross-correlation scores of acquired to in silico calculated spectra.\r\n\n\n Filter search engine results to a low false discovery rate \\(FDR), for example using DTASelect2.  Search engine results from MS/MS spectra should be combined for all biological replicates before assigning peptides to proteins and filtering the results.  We also strongly recommend to conservatively filter the search results and adjust the false positive rate to a peptide false positive rate of less than 0.5% and a protein false positive rate of less than 1.0%.\r\n\n\n Resolve protein identification ambiguities for example by using a gene centric approach.  Redundant identifications can skew the statistical analysis towards genes identified with many protein isoforms.\r\n\n\nCritical:  The bait must be among the top 10 proteins with the highest number of spectral counts. Recommended minimum spectral counts for the bait protein is between 50 and 100 spectral counts per experimental replicate \\(SpC).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n To distinguish specific protein interactors from non-specifically binding   proteins, run CoPITgenerator according to the instructions \\(www.proteomicswiki.com) .  CoPIT generator reports a rank-ordered list of interactors with the bait protein that can be further analyzed.  A confidence score \\(_P_-value) is reported for every potential interactor that reflects its likelihood of interaction. A user defined _P_-value cutoff can be set to differentiate weak from strong interactors.\r\n\n\n To compare interactomes, the _P_-value cutoff can be adjusted according to the ratio of bait in the different experimental conditions:\nTo identify differentially binding proteins in two different experimental conditions, calculate ratios _r_\np\nfor individual proteins \\(_p_) from the sum of all intensities per protein _I_\np\nand experiment condition _e_\n1\nand _e_\n2\nand normalize to the sum of all bait intensities \\(SpC) according to:\nCalculate errors according to random error of measurement:\nin order to find significantly different proteins for example with a cutoff of at least 2-fold difference plus one or two standard deviations.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Step** **6**  **Network** **representation** **and** **data** **presentation** \r\n\n\n            **Timing**: **2** **days** \r\n\n\n The core interactome can be loaded into the Radial Topology Viewer \\(www.proteomicswiki.com) for visualization.  The Radial Topology Viewer displays the bait at the center of the interactome network and arranges the interactors radially according to a user-defined distance.  Interactors can be further grouped in multiple spokes based on a user-defined classification scheme, for example according to GO-terms.\r\n\n\n Interactions between the identified interactors can be obtained with the GeneMANIA 2.2 Plugin in Cytoscape 2.8.2\n5,6\n. Export connectivity information to a .txt or .csv file to load into Radial Topology Viewer.  A step-by-step instruction how to obtain networks from GeneMania and Cytoscape is available in Morris et al., 2014\n7\n.", "**General Remarks:**\r\n\n\nBefore starting the experiment make sure to clean your bench and pipets using RNase decontamination solution.

Centrifuge at 13500 x g for 45 min at 4\u00b0C, collect the supernatant, pour through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter and collect the filtrate.\r\n  _Critical step:_ Samples should be centrifuged immediately before use and/or filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter.\r\n\n\n18. Add calcium chloride to a final concentration of 10 mM before chromatography.\r\n  _Critical step:_ EDTA should be blocked by addition of calcium chloride prior to chromatography. \r\n\n\n19. Apply the supernatant to a HisTrapTM HP-prepared column equilibrated in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer \\(pH 7.4) and 500 mM sodium chloride. Wash the column with this buffer until a stable baseline is reached.\r\n  _Critical step:_ For simple and reproducible purification, a chromatography system such as a computer controlled \u00c4ktapurifierTM UPC 10 system, is recommended, recording the purification process and providing a standard purification protocol which can be followed exactly or optimized as required.\r\n\n\n20. Elute the fusion protein with a linear gradient over 12 column volumes into 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer \\(pH 7.4), 500 mM sodium chloride and 500 mM imidazole. The His-tagged hBD-1 fusion protein usually starts to elute when 165 mM imidazole is reached. If necessary, identify fractions containing the fusion protein by SDS-PAGE-analysis, MALDI-MS or ESI- QTOF-MS analysis.\r\n  21. Pool the fractions containing the fusion protein and concentrate with an Amicon 3-kDa membrane. Dialyze against 1 x PBS and collect the sample. \r\n  \r\n\n\n**C. Refolding of the pET32a-hBD-1 fusion protein**\r\n\n\n_Critical step:_ We have observed that the pET32a-hBD-1 protein, expressed in _E. coli_ BL21\\(DE3)pLysS, might form unusual disulfide bonds different from natural hBD-1. As the enzyme enterokinase contains traces of trypsin-like activity, the direct treatment of the wrongly-folded fusion protein may result in a C-terminally truncated form of hBD-1, which is cleaved C-terminally behind an Arg, now missing seven residues at the C-terminus. This truncated hBD-1-form is usually representing more than 80 \u2013 90 % recovery of the whole hBD-1 after Enterokinase-treatment. We further observed that the correctly folded oxidized hBD-1 is trypsin-stable. Thus, a refolding step, generating the correctly folded hBD-1 within the fusion protein, is essential prior to enterokinase digestion. This can be performed with the two-step quick dilution method adapted from Lu et al \\[4].\r\n\n\n22. Adjust the sample to a concentration of 7.5 mg/ml and perform quick dilution to 0.2 mg/ml with refolding buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 M urea, 0.3 mM GSSG and 3.0 mM GSH.\r\n  23. Gently swirl to mix and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\r\n  24. Perform a further dilution to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml with the same volume of refolding buffer containing 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 M urea, 5.7 mM GSSG and 3.0 mM GSH.\r\n  25.

Incubate at 37 \u00b0C overnight with enterokinase \\(1 U per 250 \u00b5g of fusion proteins) \r\n  29. The next morning, pour the digestion mixture through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter and collect the filtrate. \r\n  30. Load onto a FPLC MonoS HR5/5 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris/HCl \\(pH 8.2). Elute the hBD-1 protein with a linear gradient over 10 column volumes into 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer \\(pH 8.2) containing 1.0 M sodium chloride. The cationic hBD-1 peptide usually starts to elute when 0.49 M sodium chloride is reached \\(Fig. 1a). Identify fractions containing the hBD-1 protein by ESI-QTOF-MS analysis \\(Fig.1b).\r\n  _Critical step:_ To obtain pure hBD-1, FPLC should be performed with a chromatography system such as a computer controlled \u00c4ktapurifierTM UPC 10 system. \r\n\n\n31. Pool the peak fractions containing hBD-1 and adjust the pH value to 3-4 with 5% TFA. \r\n  32. Apply the solution to a Jupiter C18 column for further purification of the correctly folded hBD-1 by high resolution RP-HPLC \\(solvent A: 0.1% TFA; solvent B: 80% CH\n3\nHN, 0.1% TFA; gradient: 25\u201370% of solvent B in 30 min). Identify fractions containing the oxidized, correctly folded hBD-1 protein by SDS-PAGE and ESI-QTOF-MS analysis and comparison with a synthetic, correctly folded oxidized hBD-1.\r\n  33. Pool the peak fractions containing the desired hBD-1 and lyophilize until dry. \r\n  _Pause Point_. Store the oxidized hBD-1 at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use \\(up to several months).\r\n\n\n34. To obtain linearized, reduced hBD-1, dissolve the lyophilized oxidized hBD-1 in 50 mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3\nbuffer \\(pH 8.0), add 20 mM DTT and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h in the dark or alternatively, dissolve the lyophilized oxidized hBD-1 in 0.1 % TFA, add 20 mM Tris-Carboxethyl-Phosphin \\(TCEP) and incubate at room temperature for 2 h. \r\n  _Critical step:_ Take care about the buffer pH when using either DTT or TCEP. DTT requires alkaline pH and TCEP requires acidic pH.\r\n\n\n35. Further purify reduced hBD-1 by high resolution RP-HPLC as STEP-32 \\(RP-HPLC C\n2\nC\n18\n) above. Identify fractions containing the desired protein by ESI-QTOF-MS analysis. \r\n  _Critical step:_ The quality of DTT can vary. Oxidized DTT will result in incomplete hBD-1-reduction. This will be seen by the presence of several HPLC-peaks corresponding to the correct mass of oxidized hBD-1. These represent alternatively folded hBD-1 forms, which have retention times upon RP-HPLC later than the correctly folded oxidized form and earlier than the fully reduced hBD-1-form.\r\n\n\n36. Pool the peak fractions containing the reduced hBD-1 and lyophilize until dryness. \r\n  _Pause Point_. Store the reduced hBD-1 at \u221220 \u00b0C under argon until further use. When reduced hBD-1 shall be stored for several months, it is better to do this as solution as HPLC-fraction and lyophilize the sample immediately before use.\r\n\n\n_Critical step:_ A storage without argon may result in oxidation with the formation of mainly wrongly folded oxidized hBD-1-forms.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**E. Production of polyclonal antibodies against reduced hBD-1 in rabbits**\r\n\n\n37. Dissolve the lyophilized, reduced hBD-1 in 50 mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3\nbuffer \\(pH 8.0) and add iodoacetamide \\(IAA) to a final concentration of 50 mM. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C in the dark for 1 h.\r\n  38. Purify the alkylated hBD-1 by RP-HPLC C\n2\nC\n18\nusing the same system as described above. After identification of the fully alkylated hBD-1 by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, combine and lyophilize the fractions containing the desired peptide.\r\n  _Critical step:_ The purity of the reduced and alkylated hBD-1 peptides is the key to the production of antibodies against linearized hBD-1. Avoid the presence of oxidized hBD-1, as this may result in cross-reacting antibodies.\r\n\n\n_Pause Point._ Store the alkylated hBD-1 at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use.\r\n\n\n39. Prepare a protein mixture in 2.4 ml PBS \\(pH 7.2) including 2.4 mg of HPLC-purified carboxamidomethylated hBD-1 and 1.2 mg of HPLC-purified reduced hBD-1. \r\n  40. Prepare 4 mg of glutaraldehyde-treated keyhole limpet hemocyanin \\(KLH). \r\n  a) Dilute 4 mg KLH in 4 ml 1 x PBS and add 4 \u00b5l of fresh 25% glutaraldehyde\r\n\n\nb) Mix well and incubate at 100 rpm at room temperature for 1 h.\r\n\n\nc) Transfer to four 30-kD vivaspins and centrifugate at 12,000 x g for 10 min.\r\n\n\nd) Wash with 500 \u00b5l PBS and centrifugate again at 12,000 x g.\r\n\n\ne) Repeat the washing step as above two times.\r\n\n\nf) Dilute with 1.6 ml PBS, pH 7.2, to get a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml.\r\n\n\n_Critical step:_ Glutaraldehyde is highly reactive to lysines. It would bind to the lysines in hBD-1 and cross-link hBD-1. To avoid this unwanted reaction, it is essential to ensure that there is no glutaraldehyde contamination.\r\n\n\n41. Mix well the protein mixture \\(Step 39) and the glutaraldehyde-treated KLH \\(Step 40) and incubate at 100 rpm at room temperature for 1 h. \r\n  _Critical step:_ Use a pH of the solution below the pI of Lysine. A pH of 7.2 would cause a preferential coupling of the glutaraldehyde-treated KLH to the free aminoterminus and not to quarternized \u03c9-aminogroups of the lysines, which would generate unwanted neo-antigens.\r\n\n\n42. Stop the reaction with 20 \u00b5l of 1 M Tris-HCl \\(pH8.0) and dilute with PBS to make a solution containing 0.2-0.3 mg/ml peptide.\r\n  _Pause Point._ Store in aliquots at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n43. Immunize rabbits. For each rabbit, initially immunize with 300 \u00b5g KLH-conjugated peptides.\r\n  _Critical step:_ Use rabbits for immunization. We failed to produce the desired antibodies in a goat using the same antigen-mixture. \r\n\n\n44. For booster injection, use 200 \u00b5g KLH-conjugated peptides per rabbit after 2, 4, and 7 weeks, respectively.\r\n  45. Bleed 2 weeks after the last booster. After treatment, collect supernatant \\(serum) and filtrate with 0.22 \u00b5m filter.\r\n  _Pause Point._ Store in aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use.\r\n\n\n46. Apply to a HiTrap\u2122 Protein G HP column \\(GE Healthcare) to separate\r\n  IgG fractions. \r\n\n\n_Critical step:_ The pH of each eluate should be immediately returned to a neutral pH.\r\n\n\n47. Prepare two affinity columns using 1 mg of either highly purified alkylated hBD-1 or highly purified, correctly folded, oxidized hBD-1, covalently bound to a HiTrap NHS activated HP 1 ml column \\(GE Healthcare).\r\n  48. Next, purify polyclonal antibodies from the Protein G-purified IgG fractions \\(STEP 9) by affinity chromatography.\r\n  _Critical step:_ The pH of each elutate should be immediately returned to a neutral pH.\r\n\n\n49. To deplete any cross-reacting antibodies recognizing epitopes also present in the correctly folded, oxidized hBD-1, apply the purified IgG-fraction \\(step 48) to the affinity column containing oxidized hBD-1. Test the effluent for specificity by immuno-dot blot-analyses and western blot analyses with correctly folded oxidized hBD-1, fully reduced hBD-1 and alkylated hBD-1. There should be immunoreactivity for the reduced hBD-1, the alkylated hBD-1, but no reactivity for the correctly folded oxidized hBD-1.\r\n  _Critical step:_ The purity of the correctly folded, oxidized hBD-1 is essential for the recovery of antibodies against linearized hBD-1 in the effluent. The best oxidized and correctly folded hBD-1 used for preparing the affinity column would be a chemical synthesis-derived commercially available oxidized hBD-1. When recombinant correctly folded, oxidized hBD-1 is used, take care that it does not contain any wrongly folded oxidized hBD-1. Some of the alternatively folded oxidized hBD-1 forms will be recognized by the antibodies against linearized hBD-1 \u2013 possibly due to appearance of hidden epitopes. The use of mixtures of differently folded oxidized hBD-1-forms for preparation of the affinity column will result in dramatic losses of linearized hBD-1 recognizing antibodies in the effluent.\r\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that stripping of the correctly folded hBD-1-affinity column with glycine buffer gave nearly no correctly folded hBD-1 recognizing antibodies.\r\n\n\n50.

The name of the PDB file of the model to be evaluated. \r\n  2. The type of links to be computed. \r\n  3. The specification of the linker used and experimental observations. \r\n  \r\n\n\n1. **Name of model file and output of linkers computed**. \r\n  \r\n\n\nThe name of the input file is provided with: \r\n\n\npdbfile model.pdb\r\n\n\nand this definition can be overwritten by providing the name of the file in the command line, to facilitate the execution of TopoLink for multiple models with the same input file, as described above. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTopoLink can output coordinates for the topological paths obtained, by using \r\n\n\nprintlinks yes\r\n\n\nlinkdir ./links\r\n\n\nwhere ./links is the directory where the PDB files of the links will be written \\(the directory must exist). Note that there can be many links, so multiple files will be created. The files created are simple PDB files which can be open in any structure visualization software together with the model PDB file to visualize the topological distance. For the execution of TopoLink in multiple models, it is recommended not to write link files, using printlinks no. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n2. **Types of links to be computed** \r\n  \r\n\n\nThe next important parameter of the TopoLink input file is the definition of which links are to be searched and computed. There are three options: \r\n\n\ncompute observed\r\n\n\ncompute all\r\n\n\ncompute reactive\r\n\n\nWhen using compute observed, only the links that were observed experimentally \\(see below) will be computed. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIf compute all is used instead, all possible crosslinks will be computed. That means that, given the definition of the linker used, TopoLink will search for consistent topological distances for every pair of residues that could, by the chemical nature of the linker and the residues involved, be attached by the linker. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nFinally, compute reactive tells TopoLink to consider that only residues that were experimentally observed to react \\(by participating in observed crosslinks or dead-ends) are reactive. Then, TopoLink will search for topological distances consistent with the linker used only between these pairs of \"observed-reactive\" residues. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAdditionally, the user may optionally choose to compute only the crosslinks between different chains of the PDB file, for instance to compute inter-proteins crosslinks in a complex. To do so, just add the \r\n\n\ninterchain\r\n\n\noption to the input file. All intra-protein links will be skiped. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n3. **Specification of linker types and experimental observations** \r\n  \r\n\n\nThe linker types and observations are specified in the TopoLink input file using an experiment-based structure, as described in \"http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/topolink/usage.shtml\":http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/topolink/usage.shtml \r\n\n\nLink types, reactive residues, and experimental observations \\(either crosslinks or deadends) are provided\r\n\n\nby the user with appropriate keywords.", "CRITICAL:\nThaw all frozen reagents thoroughly before use.\nSample preparation\nPreparation of synthetic RNA\n1.\u00a0Run PCR to amplify 316 bp SARS-CoV-2 N gene sequence in the pUCIDT plasmid.

The plasmid vectors encoding the fusion proteins are mixed in sterile electorporation cuvettes and empty vector DNA is used to keep the total amount of DNA constant for a given experiment. The amount of DNA per cuvette typically ranges from 5 to 30 \u03bcg and optimal concentrations must be determined by experimentation.  Both 0.2 or 0.4 cm gap cuvettes are available, and electroporation conditions must be optimized for each cell line.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Rinse the cell monolayer with phosphate buffered saline, and then briefly treat the cells with trypsin  \\(0.05%) in 0.53 mM EDTA.  Remove the trypsin-EDTA solution.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. When cells begin to release from the surface of the flask, recover the cells in culture medium containing serum.  Wash the cells 2 times by centrifugation in Dulbecco\u2019s calcium-magnesium free phosphate buffered saline.\r\n  \r\n\n\n4. Resuspend the cells to a final concentration of approximately 1x10\n7\ncells per ml in Dulbecco\u2019s calcium-magnesium free phosphate buffered saline.   Add 400 \u03bcl of the cell suspension to each 0.2 cm gap electroporation cuvette containing the DNA. \r\n  \r\n\n\n5. Gently mix the contents of the cuvette and then pulse the cells at the desired voltage and capacitance. For a 400 \u03bcl suspension of GHFT1-5 cells in 0.2 cm gap cuvettes, we use a 220 volt pulse at a total capacitance of 1200 microfarads.  The typical pulse durations obtained under these conditions are 9 - 10 ms.\r\n  \r\n\n\n6. The cells are then immediately recovered from the cuvette and diluted in phenol red free tissue culture medium containing serum.\r\n  \r\n\n\n7. The cells are inoculated drop-wise onto a sterile 42-mm cover glass in 60 mm culture dishes.  The cells are allowed to attach to the cover glass for approximately 20 minutes prior to gently flooding the culture dish with media.\r\n  \r\n\n\n8. The cultures are then placed in an incubator for 18 h prior to imaging.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**Confocal microscopy for photoactivation of PA-GFP - Timing 1-2 h** \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n9. Prepared chambers with cover glass can be purchased.  Alternatively, we designed a chamber to fit the inverted Zeiss microscope stage that accepts 42-mm cover glass, which provides a large surface area for cell attachment.  The chamber is cut from 5-mm thick stainless steel with external dimensions of 74 X 65 mm.  A 50-mm wide circular chamber is cut to a depth of 4.5 mm.  The center 36-mm is then drilled through providing a support for the 42-mm cover glass.  The chamber accepts a threaded stainless steel insert with a 36-mm diameter opening, and surfaces of the chamber and insert are polished to provide a tight seal against the cover glass.  The cover glass with the monolayer of transfected cells is placed in the chamber, the insert is tightened snuggly to the glass, and the chamber is filled with media.  The chamber is then fitted to the prewarmed stage of the inverted microscope, and covered with the top from the 60 mm dish.  The stage incubator maintains the temperature between 35-37\u00baC.  **Critical Step:** For cultures that are exposed to room air, it is important to use a culture medium buffered to maintain pH under those conditions. \r\n  \r\n\n\n10. In order to optimize photoactivation of the PA-GFP labeling the proteins of interest, we co-transfect the cells with an mRFP marker to allow visualization of the transfected cells\n5\n, which are identified using arc lamp illumination.  The epi-fluorescence microscopy configuration includes:\r\n  \\(A) AttoArc 2 HBO, 100 W mercury lamp.\r\n\n\n\\(B) Neutral density filters to control illumination.\r\n\n\n\\(C) Standard FITC \\(ex 480/40 nm, beamsplitter 505 LP, em 535/50 nm) and Texas Red filters \\(ex 560/50x nm, beamsplitter 595 LP, em 645/75 nm) will work for this application.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n11. Identify a transfected cell by mRFP fluorescence using the Texas Red filter, then switch to LSM mode.  A power meter is used to directly measure the laser power at the specimen plane. The LSM configuration is shown in **Fig. 1**.    The initial laser power settings are:\r\n  \\(A)  405: 1.5 \u03bcW  \\(1% transmittance)\r\n\n\n\\(B)  488: 2-6 \u03bcW \\(1-5% transmittance)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n12. The detector gain is initially set to 700, but this will be adjusted later as needed.  The pinhole settings for each channel are initially set to 1 airy unit.\r\n  \r\n\n\n13. Using the red channel only, acquire a focused image of the selected cell. \r\n  \r\n\n\n14. **Scanner configuration \\(speed, zoom factor):**  Using the **_Crop_** function, crop the image to the size of the cell. Set the maximum scanning speed possible for the selected zoom factor. The typical scanning speed for our experiments was 0.64 \u03bcs/pixel. Using the **_Histogram_** function as a guide, adjust the gain and the laser power so that the brightest pixel in the 8-bit image is between 200 and 250 gray levels. \r\n  \r\n\n\n15. Open a new image window, then turn on the green channel and do a preliminary scan of the cell.\r\n  \r\n\n\n16. **Time Lapse Configuration:** Under the **_Time Lapse_** function, set the number of scans and the delay between scans. This step must be optimized for the individual PA-GFP-labeled protein. For proteins that have very high intracellular mobility, set the delay to zero.\r\n  \r\n\n\n17. **Defining the photoactivation spot:** Under the **_Edit Bleach_** function, set the activation pulse length and intensity. As a starting point, set the number of iterations to 15, and the 405-nm laser to 100% transmittance. Set the number of images that are going to be taken before the activation pulse.  Under **_Define ROI_** function, choose and draw the activation ROI. **Critical Step:** To avoid extensive photodamage, this ROI should be the smallest possible for efficient activation.  We typically used a 20 pixel-diameter, circular ROI.  Save the selected ROI for use in all future experiments. \r\n  \r\n\n\n18. **Photoactivation:** Place the photoactivation ROI in the area of the cell where PA-GFP is to be photoactivated. Return to the **_Time Lapse_** window and press **_Start Bleach_**. \r\n  \r\n\n\n19. **Data analysis at the microscope:**  After activation and acquisition are done, the image sequence can be reviewed by choosing the **_Slice_** function.  By choosing the **_Profile_** function, the change in fluorescence intensity over time in several different user-defined ROI can be determined.  Then, by using the **_Show Table_** function, the actual intensity values for each selected ROI can be displayed and saved for later analysis. \r\n  \r\n\n\n20. Repeat steps 16-19 using different cells until photoactivation pulse is optimized.\r\n  \r\n\n\n**PQ-FRET microscopy using PA-GFP and CFP - Timing 2-4 h**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n21. For cells that co-express PA-GFP- and CFP-labeled proteins, the transfected cells can be identified by fluorescence in the cyan channel using the visible \\(VIS) mode with the FITC filter. **Critical Step:** By using the FITC filter, sufficient CFP fluorescence can be detected without activating the PA-GFP or bleaching the CFP. \r\n  \r\n\n\n22. Switch back to the LSM mode, and turn off the red and cyan channels, and focus and crop the selected cell using the 488-nm laser line as described above. Then acquire the \u201cbefore photoactivation\u201d GFP image.\r\n  \r\n\n\n23. Turn off the green channel and turn on the cyan channel \\(ex 405 nm/em 475 nm) using approximately 1.5 \u03bcW laser power at the specimen plane.  Take a preliminary image in a new window. Adjust the detector gain so the brightest pixel is between 200 and 250 gray levels. Then acquire the \u201cbefore photoactivation\u201d CFP image.\r\n  \r\n\n\n24. Position the photoactivation ROI that was saved from the previous set of experiments and use the optimized photoactivation protocol described in steps 16-19. Images are collected with the 405-nm laser line at 1.5 \u03bcW laser power at the frequency determined as described above.\r\n  \r\n\n\n25. When this is complete, open a new image window. Turn off the cyan channel and turn on the green channel to acquire the \u201cafter photoactivation\u201d GFP image, under identical conditions to the first.\r\n  \r\n\n\n26. Repeat the data analysis described in step 10 using the cyan image sequence. Analyze the change in the cyan signal in different ROI positioned at different distances from the activation site. If FRET has occurred, there will be progressive quenching of the CFP signal in the various ROI following the activation of the PA-GFP  \\(see ANTICIPATED RESULTS).\r\n  \r\n\n\n27. **Critical Step:** Repeat steps 21 to 24 with cells that are transfected with the CFP construct only, to verify that the CFP is not photobleached by the repetitive scanning.\r\n  \r\n\n\n28. **Critical Step:** Repeat steps 21 to 25 with cells that are transfected with the CFP-labeled protein of interest and a PA-GFP-labeled protein that does not interact with the protein of interest.  Under these conditions, the activation of the PA-GFP should not affect the signal from the co-expressed CFP \\(see ANTICIPATED RESULTS). \r\n  \r\n\n\n29. **Data Processing:** Open the saved tables in Microsoft Excel. For each ROI, normalize the data to the initial fluorescence in that same area \\(intensity = 1) by dividing all the values by the first value in the column. Normalize the GFP-alone data so the highest value equals 1. The change in CFP intensity over time was measured for several different ROI and was normalized to the initial fluorescence in each ROI. Plot the data as relative intensity versus time.", "**Fabrication of microwell arrays**\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe polydimethylsiloxane \\(PDMS) stamps are formed through replica molding using microstructured silicon wafers. Wafers are processed _via_ deep reactive ion etching as we previously described in several publications 9\u201311. This fabrication process requires the use of a clean room and special equipment accessible in numerous universities. Once the PDMS stamps are produced, these are used to routinely imprint hydrogel microwell arrays.\r\n\n\nMicrowell arrays \\(1000 microwells) are produced in 6 well-plates and then cut and inserted into 12-well plates. Alternatively, microwell arrays are directly imprinted into 96-well plates \\(400 microwells). Microwells have a diameter and a height of 200 \u03bcm. The geometry of the interspace is shown in Figure 1a and allows to extrapolate all dimensions of the microwell array.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Culture of embryonic stem cells.**\r\n\n\nThe ESCs are maintained on a gelatin coating in medium #1 \\(2i medium) for 11 days. A bank of 50 vials containing 0.5 million cells per vial is prepared. When a blastoid experiment is started, a vial is defrosted and plated on gelatin in medium #1. After two days of culture, the cells are passaged, seeded at 15.000 cells/cm\n2\nand cultured for two days. In total, ESCs are thus cultured for 15 days in medium #1 before starting the blastoid experiment. This leads to the formation of tightly packed, medium-sized colonies with clear edges \\(see Figure 1b). Note that different ESCs lines can grow at different speed and that the initial seeding density must be adjusted accordingly to obtain such colonies. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Culture of trophoblast stem cells.**\r\n\n\nThe TSCs are maintained on Matrigel\u00ae coatings in medium #3 \\(TX medium5). The 10 ml bottle of Matrigel\u00ae is defrosted by standing overnight in a fridge and aliquoted in 1 ml Eppendorf tubes. Note that both the tubes and the pipet tips must be previously cooled down in a freezer and the aliquoting done on ice to prevent the premature gelification of the Matrigel. The stock of tubes containing Matrigel\u00ae is frozen. One tube is defrosted, the day before starting the TSC culture, by standing overnight in a fridge. The tube can then be maintained defrosted in a fridge for several weeks. Matrigel\u00ae is then resuspended 1/90 v/v in ice-cold DMEM/F12. The suspension is added to the cell culture dish \\(1ml/10cm\n2\n) and incubated for one hour inside a lamina flow hood, at room temperature. The Matrigel\u00ae suspension is then removed and the TSCs are seeded in medium #3. TSCs previously culture with serum12 are maintained in medium #3 for 3 weeks before making a bank. A bank of 50 vials containing 0.5 million cells per vial is then prepared. When a blastoid experiment is started, a vial is defrosted and plated on Matrigel\u00ae in medium #3. After two days of culture, the cells are passaged, seeded at 15.000 cells/cm\n2\nand cultured for four days. Note that, similar to ESCs, different TSCs lines can grow at different speed and that the initial seeding density must be adjusted accordingly to obtain colonies as represented in Figure 1b. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Formation of blastoids.**\r\n\n\nThe ESCs are washed with PBS, trypsinized for three minutes to form a single cell suspension. The trypsin is inhibited using the soya bean solution and the cells are carefully suspended in medium #2 \\(serum medium). Cell concentration is counted using a counting chamber. Cells are then seeded on top of the microwell arrays with a cell concentration resulting in the pooling of a mean of five cells per microwell. One ml of medium #2 is used for the aggregation of the ESCs. Within 24\u201336 hours, the cells form tight, round aggregates. All cells participate to the formation of the aggregate \\(see Figure 1b). \r\n\n\nAfter 24-36 hours, the TSCs are then washed with PBS, trypsinized for three minutes to form a single cell suspension. The trypsin is inhibited using the soya bean solution and the cells are carefully suspended in medium #4 \\(blastoid medium). Cell concentration is counted using a counting chamber. The medium #2 is largely removed from the microwell arrays and the TSCs are then seeded on top of the microwell arrays containing the ESCs aggregates, with a cell concentration resulting in the pooling of a mean of 12 cells per microwell. Upon settling of the cells within the microwells \\(15 minutes), one ml of medium #4 is added.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNota Bene: The difficulty is to synchronize the two cell cultures so that both cultures are ready, in a perfect state, for the experiment. The initial state of the cells \\(e.g. confluency, morphology of the colonies) is crucial for the success of the experiment.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe time of TSCs seeding is considered as the starting point \\(0 hours). Within 24 hours, the TSCs aggregate with the ESCs and initiate cavitation. At 24 hours, 1 mM 8Br-cAMP in a 10 ul of F12 medium is added to each microwell array. Within 48 hours, 2\u201310% of the aggregates formed a blastoid, which expanded and stabilized by 65 hours. A blastoid is defined based on morphological parameters of E3.5 blastocysts, as a cystic structure with an outer circularity superior to 0.9 \\(circularity = 4pi\\(area/perimeter\n2\n), and a diameter comprised between 70 and 110 micrometers, including a single regular cavity lined by a single layer of TSCs and including ESCs \\(Figure 1c).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nTrophospheres are obtained by seeding TSCs \\(mean of 12 cells per microwell) on top of microwell arrays that do not contain a ESCs aggregate, in the same medium as used for blastoids \\(Figure 1c).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Manipulation and dissociation for single cell analysis**\r\n\n\nUpon formation, blastoids can be harvested using a mouth pipet holding a glass capillary, just like blastocysts. Under a stereomicroscope, specific blastoids can be harvested from individual microwells and pooled into round-bottom 96 well-plates for fixation or dissociation.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Blastoid dissociation:**\r\n\n\n- Prepare dissociation capillaries of different sizes \\(75-150 um).\r\n\n\n- Warm up the incubator/shaker to 37deg.C and set up at ~350RPM. Warm up the hotplate. \r\n\n\n- Defreeze and warm up the Collagenase IV, TrypleE, RNA-free BSA and maintain them in the water-bath.\r\n\n\n- Prepare 15ml of PBS + 2% FBS \\(PBS+)\r\n\n\n- Prepare 1mL of PBS + 1uL of Hoechst\r\n\n\n- Add 150uL PBS in two rows of the 96 well plate; 50uL of collagenase IV 600U/ml in a third row; and 100uL of RNA-free BSA in a fourth row \\(These wells will be used for TrypleE dissociation)\r\n\n\n- Take 150 blastoids / EBs / Trophospheres out of the microwells and wash them with 2x in PBS-0 \\(without Ca/Mg)\r\n\n\n \r\n\n\n- Deposit blastoids / EBs / Trophospheres in 50 uL of Collagenase IV 600U/ml. Tape the plate at the bottom of a plastic box and place the box in the bacteria shaker, at 350RPM for 30 minutes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNota Bene: using bigger volume \\(> 50uL) reduces the mixing as it is the surface of the liquid, down to a certain depth, that moves. The 96 well-plate must be placed into a plastic box to prevent contamination. The speed of shaking can be tested using 40 uL of PBS + 10 uL of Laemmli buffer \\(blue ladder for SDS page): the buffer forms a disc at the bottom of the well that, above a certain speed, mixes with the PBS.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- During that time, trypsinize ESC and TSC from the 6 well-plate 2D culture. Block with the trypsine inhibitor. Spin down and re-suspend in 3mL of PBS+. Add 1mL to each FACS tube. Place on ice while waiting to FACS.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- Transfer the blastocysts to TrypleE 10X \\(no dilution) and shake for 20 minutes\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNota Bene: Upon collagenase treatment, blastoids will stay intact. However, they will collapse after TrypleE treatment. Blastoids / EBs / Trophospheres will gather into one cluster, in the center of the 96 well. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- Bring to the stereomicroscope and use a large capillary to dissociate the large cluster, and a small capillary to dissociate into single cells\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nNota Bene 1: Capillaries of different diameters should be available. EBs necessitate large dissociation capillaries only. Blastoids and trophospheres necessitate capillaries with intermediate diameter between the ones used for EBs and for single cells.\r\n\n\nNota Bene 2: EBs will give a lot more cells than blastoids. Blastoids will give more cells than trophospheres, which are the most difficult to dissociate.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n- Prepare a 1mL Eppendorf with 200uL of Trypsine inhibitor. \r\n\n\n- Harvest the cells with a P200 and place in the Eppendorf.

Probes were diluted and stored according to published protocol 18 and manufactures instruction. Pre-hybridizations and hybridizations were performed at temperature 20-25\u00b0C below the Tm of the given LNA probe. Working conditions and the efficiency of the in situ hybridizations were determined by using both positive \\(U6, miRNA known to be ubiquitously expressed in most of the tissues) and negative \\(scramble, has no homology to any known miRNA/ mRNA sequence) control probes\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nHybridization Mix 10ml: \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nAccording to published protocol 18 \\(To 1.8 ml DEPC-treated water add 5ml of ultra pure 50% formamide, 2.5ml of 20x SSC, 500\u03bcl of 10 ug/\u03bcl yeast t-RNA, 200 \u03bcl of 50x Denhardt\u2019s solution for a total volume of 10ml.

See the installation.md document for information on installing the necessary software, i.e., a Python environment, the head modelling and electric field simulation software SimNIBS, and the pyNIBS python package for pre- and post-processing. The provided scripts accompany this protocol and are documented extensively. All scripts may be customized to meet individual requirements. All paths and folders in this protocol refer to the repository root folder.\nPreparation\n1 Volunteer clearance\nObtain written informed consent from the volunteer for all subsequent procedures. Follow safety guidelines, applicable national laws, and possible insurance requirements (see REAGENT SETUP) while performing the medical screening.\nTIMING: 30 min\nBOX 1 | POSITION OF VOLUNTEER AND EXPERIMENTERS\nPosition of volunteer\nDuring TMS mapping, the volunteer sits comfortably with the right arm resting on a pillow on their lap at half abdominal height. The volunteer must wear earplugs and completely relax arm and hand muscles. The wrist is in a neutral position and the fingers are in a resting position with slight flexion. Use the electromyogram (EMG) signal to confirm complete relaxation. Remind the volunteer to avoid arm, hand, and finger muscle contractions throughout the TMS procedure. Small movements and adjustments are only allowed between stimulations.\nPosition of experimenters\nThe experimenter holding the TMS coil (a) stands sideways behind the volunteer, such that both the neuronavigation and the EMG signal can be watched. The second experimenter (b) starts, pauses, and stops the experiment and controls data recording.\nFIGURE B1:\nPosition of volunteer and experimenters. (a) One experimenter (KW) positions the TMS coil over the motor cortex of the volunteer (ON) and (b) a second experimenter (TRK) controls the stimulator and monitors the motor evoked potentials. (c) The belly tendon montage to measure motor evoked potentials from FDI, ADM, and FDI.\n2 MRI acquisition\nPrecise head models are constructed from high resolution (i.e., at most 1 mm\u00b3 voxel size) structural MRI scans. A 3 Tesla MRI scanner with a 32 channel head coil yields sufficient quality. The acquisition of a T1-weighted image is mandatory to proceed with the protocol. We strongly recommend acquiring a T2-weighted image with the same voxel size to improve skull segmentation26,31. To increase accuracy of the electric field calculations, a diffusion-weighted MR image (dMRI) can additionally be used to provide conductivity anisotropy information. The example data set contains a high-resolution T1-weighted image, a high-resolution T2-weighted image, and a diffusion MR image. Detailed sequence information is provided in the example data set.\nTIMING: image acquisition: T1: 10 min, T2: 10 min, DWI: 20 min\nFIGURE 2:\nExample MRI data for \u2018subject_0\u2019 used for head model construction and field modelling. Left: T1 weighted MRI. Center: T2 weighted image. Right: Fractional anisotropy (FA) map from the DWI scan.\n3 Creating the subject object file\nData organization of the individual volunteers is done with the pyNIBS package by using subject objects. The example data set provides an example of a fully configured subject object file. In the following steps we describe the general procedure to create a new subject.\nExecute the 01_create_new_subject.py script to create a new subject object template file and the folder structure as shown in Fig 3.\n> python scripts/01_create_subject_structure.py -f ./subject_0\nTIMING: 1 sec\nFIGURE 3:\nInitial structure of the subject data folder.\nConvert MRI scans into the NIfTI .nii format38 with dcm2niix (\nwww.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii\n) and copy them to the correct subfolders of subject_0/mri/0/original/nifti/. Edit create_subject_0.py and enter the filenames of the nifti files and the image properties into the MRI section as shown in Fig. 4. Enter the \u2018dti_readout_time\u2019 as stated in the .yaml file from dcm2niix.\nFIGURE 4:\nMRI section of create_subject_0.py script.\nEnter the mesh information in the mesh section as shown in Fig. 5. Mesh resolution can be controlled with the vertex_density option to set the vertex density of the surface meshes in nodes per mm\u00b2. For 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 nodes per mm\u00b2 the resulting head meshes will contain around 4, 9, and 18 million tetrahedra, respectively. For the current study, we recommend a density of 1 node per mm\u00b2.\nFIGURE 5:\nMesh information in the create_subject_0.py script.\nTIMING: 15 min\n4 Defining the region of interest\nTo speed up the data analyses a region of interest (ROI) is created to an a priori defined brain area. This ROI is typically defined halfway in between the grey and white matter surfaces, the \u2018midlayer\u2019, because field estimates (step 13) are more robust in the midlayer compared to tissue boundaries. A ROI can be defined based on the subjects masks from MNI or FreeSurfer39,40 (\nhttp://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/\n) fsaverage templates. Here, we use an fsaverage ROI template file covering the left somatosensory cortex (BA 1, BA 3), the left primary motor cortex M1 (BA 4), and the dorsal part of the left premotor cortex (BA 6). This file is provided together with other examples in the example data set (roi/lefthandknob_M1S1PMd.overlay).\nAdd the ROI information to the create_subject_0.py script (Fig. 6), including the filenames of grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and midlayer surfaces as well as of the individual ROI mask. Enter the path to the template ROI .overlay file in fn_mask_avg. The template ROI is later (step 5) transformed to the individual subject space and a subject specific .mgh mask file is created in fn_mask. For the example subject this transformation can also be skipped by copying the provided file mask_lefthandknob_M1S1PMd.mgh to the midlayer_m1s1pmd folder in case FreeSurfer is not installed. See the\nTMSloc_proto\nrepository for information on how to construct your own ROIs, for example based on group fMRI results.\nFIGURE 6:\nROI section in the create_subject_0.py script.\nFinally, execute create_subject_0.py to create the subject_0.hdf5 subject object file. Execute this script again in case of any changes updating the subject object file. The example data set contains a fully configured subject object file for comparison.\nTIMING: 10 min\n5 Constructing the head model and region of interests\nCRITICAL: The quality of the head model strongly affects the accuracy of the electric field calculations and should always be inspected visually for correctness and plausibility.\nConstruct the head model and the conductivity tensors from the acquired MR images by executing the following script:\n> python scripts/02_make_msh_from_mri.py -s subject_0.hdf5 -m mesh0\nParameters:\ns : Path to subject object file\nm : Mesh ID\nTIMING: Constructing mesh: 8.5 h; Creating ROI: 0.27 h ; Creating FA: 0.34 h\nThis utilizes the headreco pipeline of SimNIBS to segment the MR images into different tissue types and creates a volumetric head mesh. Diffusion tensors are reconstructed in GM and WM if a dMRI scan is provided. The mesh will be saved in the folder subject_0/mesh/mesh0. Locate this folder and visually inspect the quality of the meshing procedure:\n> headreco check subject_0\nThis shows the reconstructed surfaces overlaid on the raw MRI data with the freeview tool. A second instance overlays the subject\u2019s anatomical scan normalized to the MNI template to inspect normalization accuracy. Lastly, the final head mesh is loaded with Gmsh41. Carefully inspect the segmentation boundaries and the registration results for any implausible results.\nThe (optional) reconstruction of diffusion tensors from the diffusion MRI data is visualized with:\n> dwi2cond -c subject_0\nThe fractional anisotropy (FA) image before and after preprocessing is superimposed on the subject\u2019s anatomical scan with fslview or fsleyes for visual inspection of the coregistration.\nThe final mesh from the example data set with its six tissue types is visualized in Fig. 7. Here, a vertex density of 1.0/mm yielded 10.832.185 tetrahedra and 1.620.479 nodes.\nTROUBLESHOOTING:\nUnreasonable mesh geometries, e. g., wrong segmentation, cortical matter outside of the head, doubled or shifted brain segments, might occur due to bad MRI quality or incorrect coregistration. Check the quality of the MR images for low signal-to-noise or low intensity as well as a strong signal inhomogeneity. Manually set origins of the MRI coordinate systems for all images to a similar location, e. g., center of anterior commissure. If the segmentation was successful but the mesh construction fails, restart the script with a slightly different vertex density.\nFIGURE 7:\nHead model from the example data set \u201csubject_0\u201d constructed with the headreco25 pipeline.\nBOX 2 | VISUALIZATION OF HEAD MODELS AND RESULTS USING PARAVIEW\nThe generated head models as well as the electric field profiles and the cortical R\u00b2 goodness-of-fit maps can be visualized with ParaView42,43. We provide file tuples of .hdf5/.xmdf files containing the data and the geometry information, which can be loaded into paraview. We also provide ParaView state files of Figs. 7, 12, 15, and 16 in the corresponding git repository (\nhttps://gitlab.gwdg.de/tms-localization/tmsloc_proto\n) to allow reproducing the visualizations. When loading the state files select \u201cChoose File Names\u201d and select the .xmdf file you want to visualize. An example of how Figure 7 is created is shown in Figure B1.\nFigure B2:\nParaview window after loading the state file Fig_7_headmodel.pvsm from the git repository (\ngitlab.gwdg.de/tms-localization/tmsloc_proto\n)\nAfter constructing the head model, we suggest refining the mesh in relevant regions to increase accuracy of the electric field estimation in these areas. Edit the create_subject_0.py script and add a new refined mesh (Fig. 8) called mesh0_refinedM1 and set the refine_domains argument to increase mesh density in CSF, GM, and WM within a specified sphere. Here, we chose a point on the skin surface in the coordinate system defined by the NIfTI header of the SimNIBS-processes MR-image (subject_0/mesh/mesh0_refinedM1/subject_0_T1_conform.nii.gz) above the primary motor cortex, where the TMS coil touches the skin. Add the ROI to the refined mesh as well (Fig. 9). In addition to refining the mesh in the region of interest, the skin surface is smoothed by setting the argument smooth_domains to skin. A smooth skin surface is required when determining the optimal coil position in step 15 of the protocol because the induced electric field in the cortex is very sensitive to changes in the coil distance.\nFIGURE 8:\nInformation of the refined mesh in the create_subject_0.py script.\nFIGURE 9:\nROI information of the refined mesh in the create_subject_0.py script.\nUpdate the subject object file by executing create_subject_0.py and run the following script to create the refined mesh:\n> python scripts/03_refine_mesh.py -s subject_0.hdf5 -m mesh0 -o mesh0_refinedM1\nParameters:\ns : Path to subject object file\nm : Mesh ID (original)\no : Mesh ID (refined)\nTIMING: 2h\nThe refined mesh will be created in the folder subject_0/mesh/mesh0_refinedM1. Fig. 10 shows both head models side by side. Bone and skin regions are not refined because their influence on the TMS induced electric fields is weak44. All following analyses are performed with the refined mesh.\nFIGURE 10:\nOriginal (a) and refined head mesh with smoothed skin surface (b).\n6 TMS laboratory preparation\nThe initial motor threshold hunting procedure must be started with a reasonable cortical target, for example or from previous work2 (FDI: -34.19, -14.33, 66.83). Run the 04_get_initial_m1_coords.py script to transform template coordinates into subject space.\n> python scripts/04_get_initial_m1_coords.py -s subject_0.hdf5 -m mesh0_refinedM1\nParameters:\ns : Path to subject object file\nm : Mesh ID\nTIMING: .1 secs\nEnter these subject specific coordinates (see Table 1 for the initial target coordinates for the example subject subject_0) as the target coordinates in the neuronavigation system to start the initial motor threshold hunting procedure with (step 7).\nTable 1:\nTarget coordinates in MNI and subject space of example subject_0.\nTarget    Subject space                  MNI space\nleft-M1   [-35.96, -39.47, +45.74]   [-37, -21, +58]\nA modified T1 image is generated during head model construction with a coordinate system that corresponds to the mesh. Use this image, subject_0/mesh/mesh0_refinedM1/subject_0_T1_conform.nii.gz, for the neuronavigation system to minimize post-processing steps. Initialize the neuronavigation session according to the neuronavigation manual and use the individualized coordinates from 6.1) as the initial target.\nRecording valid MEPs relies on correct filtering parameters. These include gain (10,000) and filtering (highpass 30 Hz, lowpass 1 kHz). Different hardware setups might require different values or other parameters and should be checked carefully for artifacts before.\nThe interstimulus interval must not be shorter than 5 s to avoid facilitation or depression of the MEP amplitude45. Configure your stimulation/EMG setup to stimulate once approximately every 5 seconds with a short jitter of at least 200 ms46 and to record the EMG data in a time window of at least 200 ms starting at the TMS pulse, with at least 2 kHz sampling rate. We provide a configuration file for the Signal software in the example data set.\nTIMING: 10 min\nTMS experiment\n7 Electrode placement and EMG recording parameters\nAsk the volunteer to take a comfortable position in the lab seat. Apply EMG surface electrodes in a standard belly-tendon montage for the muscle or muscles for which the rMT is to be determined (Fig. 11). The first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the right hand for right-handed volunteers is commonly chosen for rMT estimation. Data from multiple muscles might be recorded during a single experiment. Place the active electrode over the muscle-belly, the reference over the proximal tendon and the ground electrode at the back of the wrist of the same hand (see Kleim et al.7 for detailed instructions). Both, pre-gelled self-adhesive electrodes as well as passive EEG electrodes have been used in our laboratories yielding similar results. Skin-preparation, i.e., fat removal and skin peeling, is advised. In addition, fixate all electrodes with strips of tape, as this has proven useful to keep skin-electrode contact stable. Ask the volunteer to place their arm and hand on a table, cushion, or similar to allow relaxation of all muscles. Perform an electrode impedance check and visually inspect the signal for an adequate low noise level (about 10 \u03bcV) and for correct muscle activity recognition.\nCRITICAL: If recording EMG data from multiple muscles simultaneously, note which channel records data from which muscle.\nTROUBLESHOOTING:\nIn case of a high noise level, assure that the volunteer\u2019s hand is in a relaxed position. Assure good skin contact of the electrodes or replace the electrodes with new ones. Check the amplifier settings for correct parameters. Remove any electronic devices with a high radiation power such as mobile phones from the proximity of measurement electronics.\nTIMING: 10 min\nFIGURE 11\n: Electrode placement for EMG recordings using a bipolar belly-tendon montage. Modified plates #424 and #425, originally published in 47.\n8 Neuronavigation preparation\nPreparation of the neuronavigation software might differ between manufacturers, but should include the following steps: 1) co-register the TMS coil, 2) co-register the volunteer to the anatomical scan, 3) record data.\nCRITICAL: A precise co-registration of volunteers to their anatomical MR image is indispensable for a valid and precise functional localization. Closely follow the manufacturer\u2019s manual for the co-registration. In addition to landmarks (e.g. nasion, tragi, lateral corners of the volunteer\u2019s eyes), experimenters should sample the volunteer\u2019s head surface evenly if possible, including the forehead, posterior areas (inion), lateral areas, and superior areas. Assure a stable fixation of the tracking device that is attached to the volunteer\u2019s head during the whole experimental process and take into account potential obstructions by the coil and its handle or cable while placing it.\nCRITICAL: Co-registration of the TMS coil is of similar importance and should be visually inspected throughout the experiment. Place the coil-tracker in a way that takes into account potential obstructions by the TMS coil and the experimenter. The coil has to be recognized from different angles, from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.\nCRITICAL: Record coil position/orientation, stimulation intensity, and MEP amplitudes for each pulse. Make sure that the connection from the neuronavigation computer to the stimulator is working, to record the realized stimulation intensity. Depending on the laboratory equipment, recording might be done in different ways, e.g., with separate systems for neuronavigation and EMG recording, or both on one computer.\nTIMING: 10 min\n9 Initial motor hotspot estimation\nPerform a rough estimation of the resting motor threshold (rMT) and the corresponding hotspot with a standard threshold hunting procedure, starting at the individualized coordinates from step 6.1. The rMT is commonly defined as the minimum stimulator intensity which leads to MEPs with an amplitude of at least 50 \u03bcV for at least 5 out of 10 consecutive TMS pulses48,49,50. Save the position of the hotspot by adding an instrument marker.\nTIMING: 15 min\n10 Determining the stimulation intensity for the localization procedure\nThe following procedure ensures that the I/O curve of the to-be-localized neural population is sampled with all its features, including lower plateau, turning point, and saturation. Start stimulating over the previously determined hotspot with rMT intensity and increase the intensity until MEP amplitudes reach the upper plateau of the sigmoidal I/O curve. As a guideline, it should be around 150% of the rMT. The realized amplitudes differ between individuals and EMG setup, but should be around 2-4 mV for FDI (lower for smaller muscles like ADM). Move the coil about 3 cm into the inferior, posterior, superior, and anterior directions and rotate the coil about \u00b130\u00b0 while observing the resulting MEPs. The MEPs should decrease to low amplitudes or to zero when tilting the coil 30\u00b0 and moving it far away from the initial hotspot. Increase the stimulator intensity if the MEPs vanish already before reaching the maximum coil deviations. If MEPs at the outer border of the search area are too high, decrease the stimulator intensity until they are in the expected range. If EMG data from multiple muscles are recorded, select an intensity that yields appropriate MEP responses for all muscles. Keep these stimulator intensities for later use.\nCAUTION: Stop increasing the intensity if it becomes uncomfortable for the volunteer.\nCRITICAL: If the stimulation intensity is set too low, the upper saturation of the MEP amplitude is not sampled. This negatively affects the localization because the I/O curve is not fully sampled. In this case more stimulations are required to determine stable results.\nTIMING: 10 min\n11 Applying TMS with arbitrary coil positions and orientations\nDuring this procedure, MEPs will be recorded for arbitrary coil positions and orientations to sample data from a wide range of parameter combinations. Coil positions (referring to the center of the coil) are chosen within an area of approximately 3 cm radius around the manually estimated M1 hotspot (Fig. 12). Start recording the coil position/orientation and the EMG signal. Set the stimulator to the intensity determined in step 10 and apply stimulations with an interstimulus interval of 5 s \u00b1 200 ms. Between stimulations, move the coil arbitrarily within the area and vary the coil angle in the interval \u00b190\u00b0 around the PA-45 orientation towards the fissura longitudinalis51,52.\nCRITICAL: Ensure that the coil gently touches the scalp of the volunteer. In later modeling steps, direct contact between the plastic housing of the coil and the skin surface is assumed (see step 14).\nCRITICAL: Choose an interstimulus interval that does not cause carry over effects (i.e. at least 5 s for single pulse motor cortex studies).\nApply at least 300 stimulations to ensure successful localization of the cortical muscle representation. Short breaks during the measurement process are possible. The EMG recording software should then be paused and not stopped to prevent the creation of multiple EMG data files. After completing the stimulation protocol, export EMG data to a .cfs file. Remove EMG cables and head tracker from the volunteer.\nTROUBLESHOOTING: If the volunteer reports discomfort during the protocol, decrease the stimulation intensity. More pulses will be needed if the intensity is too low (see above). Intensity changes are recorded by the TMS Navigator and will be considered during the post-processing automatically.\nTROUBLESHOOTING: Occasionally, pulses might be dropped from the neuronavigation recording. This is automatically taken care of by the post processing scripts. If multiple EMG .cfs files are saved instead of one, these can entered as a list for the exp[m1][\u2018fn_data\u2019] parameter (see below)\nTIMING: ~25 min for 300 pulses with 5 secs ISI\nPAUSE POINT: After completing the TMS session the protocol can be paused.\nFIGURE 12\n: Arbitrary coil positions/orientations over the motor cortex from the experiment. MEPs are recorded for every TMS pulse. Color codes the FDI MEP amplitude.\nPost-processing\n12 Post-processing of experimental data\nCopy the EMG .cfs file to the subject data folder subject_0/exp/m1/mep. Copy the latest trigger marker TriggerMarker%DATETIME%.xml file from the neuronavigation folder Sessions/Session_DATE/TMSTrigger and the neuronavigation T1 image from BinData/NIFTI to the subject data folder subject_0/exp/m1/tms_navigator. Add paths and filenames of the triggermarker file (exp[m1][\u2018fn_tms_nav\u2019]), the T1 image (exp[m1][\u2018fn_mri_nii\u2019]), and the EMG data (exp[m1][\u2018fn_data\u2019]) to the create_subject_0.py script (Fig. 13). Enter the muscle names in the correct EMG channel order in exp[m1][\u2018channels\u2019]. If changed, adjust the exp[m1][\u2018tms_pulse_time\u2019] parameter to indicate the TMS pulse onset in seconds. Save and execute the create_subject_0.py script to update the subject object file.\nFIGURE 13\n: Experiment information in the create_subject_0.py script.\nMerge and postprocess TMS navigator and EMG data:\n> python scripts/05_merge_exp_data.py -s subject_0.hdf5 -m mesh0_refinedM1 -e m1 -d -r -p\nParameters:\ns : Path to subject object file\nm : Mesh ID\ne : Experiment ID\nd : Apply coil/skin distance correction\nr : Remove outlier\np : Save MEP plots\nTIMING: 10 min\nThis matches the EMG data to the recorded coil positions of the neuronavigation system and saves the results in a file specified in exp[m1][\u2018fn_exp_hdf5\u2018]. EMG data is filtered using a 6th order Butterworth lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz. Subsequently, peak-to-peak amplitudes are extracted by a min-max search in an interval from 18 ms to 35 ms after the TMS pulse (Fig. 14).\nFIGURE 14\n: Postprocessing of recorded EMG data and extraction of peak-to-peak amplitudes of motor evoked potentials.\nTo compute the electric field distributions of the realized coil positions and orientations, coordinates recorded in the TriggerMarker%DATETIME$.xml file are converted to SimNIBS coordinates. Note that for other neuronavigation systems different coordinate system transformations might be in order. Coil positions are projected onto the skin surface to compensate for slight deviations (0.5-2 mm) that stem from the tracking system and the head surface reconstruction of the neuronavigation software. Coil positions with a distance greater than 2 mm from the head surface are excluded from the analysis.\n13 Electric field calculations\nCalculate the electric field distributions for the recorded coil positions with the script below. A configuration file (subject_0/results/electric_field/FEM_config.mat) is created including parameters to initialize the SimNIBS FEM solver. The transformed coil positions from subject_0/exp/m1/matsimnibs.hdf5 are read and fields are computed. Fields in the midlayer ROI (step 4) are calculated, scaled with the applied stimulator intensity, and stored (subject_0/results/electric_field/e_scaled.hdf5). The standard FEM solver requires about 10-12 GB of RAM for each parallel computation (8 GB without mesh refinement).. Depending on the available computational resources, the process can be accelerated by using the solver option \u201cPARDISO\u201d, which requires about 40 GB for each core for the given mesh size.\n> python scripts/06_calc_e.py -s subject_0.hdf5 -m mesh0_refinedM1 -e m1 -r midlayer_m1s1pmd -n 4 -a vn -p\nParameters:\ns : Path to subject object file\nm : Mesh ID\ne : Experiment ID\nr : ROI ID\nn : Number of parallel computations\na : Anisotropic conductivity (volume normalized): \"vn\", isotropic conductivity: \"scalar\"\np : Flag to use pardiso solver\nTIMING: 4-12 h (depending on the computational resources and the number of stimulations)\n14 Localizing the cortical muscle representation\nAfter calculating the electric field distributions and the MEP amplitudes for all stimulations, the data is fitted to cortical I/O-curves with linear, sigmoidal, or log-transformed sigmoidal functions for all examined muscles.\nCAUTION: Linear regression has the lowest computational cost but reduced resolution and biological plausibility (see2 for a comparison between different curve fitting approaches). We recommend using sigmoidal or log-transformed sigmoidal functions for the fitting.\nIn every element in the ROI, the goodness-of-fit is calculated using R\u00b2 scores, with a higher score representing a better fit between data and assumed activation function. Results are saved in subject_0/results/.../r2_roi_data.hdf5 together with a file containing the geometry information of the ROI and an .xdmf markup file. The latter can be used to visualize the results, for example with ParaView42,43 (see Box 2 \u201cVISUALIZATION OF HEAD MODELS AND RESULTS USING PARAVIEW\u201d). The fitting and goodness-of-fit quantification is implemented in the following script.\n> python scripts/07_calc_r2.py -s subject_0.hdf5 -m mesh0_refinedM1 -e m1 -r midlayer_m1s1pmd -n 10 -f sigmoid4_log -i 10 -v\nParameters:\ns : Path to subject object file\nm : Mesh ID\ne : Experiment ID\nr : ROI ID\nn : Number of parallel computations\nf : Fit function (\u201clinear\u201d, \u201csigmoid4\u201d, \u201csigmoid4_log\u201d)\ni : Number of refit iterations\nv : verbose, show output messages\nTIMING: With 10 parallel processes:\nlinear function: 6 secs (no refit)\nsigmoid/log-sigmoid function: 60 secs (20 refits)\nThe cortical origin of the MEPs can now be identified based on the goodness-of-fit results in the results .hdf5 file.\nFIGURE 15\n:\nGoodness-of-fit distribution.\nThe relationship between the induced electric field distributions and the motor evoked potentials from the arbitrary coil positions were fitted to log-sigmoidal functions. At each location, the goodness-of-fit is quantified by the R\u00b2 score between fit and data.\n15 The optimal coil position for motor threshold determination\nAfter identifying the cortical target, a coil position/orientation can be computed to optimally stimulate this area. The script 08_calc_opt_coil_pos.py chooses the cortical location with maximum goodness-of-fit value as the cortical target for the coil optimization from the results file of step 14 (subject_0/results/.../r2_roi_data.hdf5). Electric fields are computed for a number of candidate coil positions and orientations for this cortical target (Fig. 16a). An Localite \u201cinstrument marker\u201d to be used in the subsequent motor threshold determination experiment is exported for the coil position/orientation that maximizes the electric field magnitude at the cortical target. A different TMS coil type from the one used in the first TMS experiment can be used here as long as the correct coil model is specified during the optimal position/orientation calculation. In addition, a motor threshold estimation in %MSO can be computed from the available data after identifying the optimum coil position by executing the script 09_estimate_rmt_from_data.py. Instead of assessing the real rMT in a precise manner with a final experimental session (step 17) this computed rMT approximation can be used if \u00b13 %MSO accuracy suffices.\nElectric field results for the optimum coil position/orientation (Fig 16b) are stored in the .hdf5/.xdmf file tuple subject_0/opt/.../opt_coil_pos.hdf5, the instrument marker as subject_0/opt/.../opt_coil_pos.xml.\nPAUSE POINT: The protocol can be paused between post-processing and the second TMS session.\n> python scripts/08_calc_opt_coil_pos.py -s subject_0.hdf5 -m mesh0_refinedM1 -e m1 -n 4 -a vn -p -t subject0/results/.../r2_roi_data.hdf5 -c example_data/coils/MagVenture_MCF_B65_REF_highres.ccd.nii.gz\nParameters:\ns : Path to subject object file\nm : Mesh ID\ne : Experiment ID\nn : Number of parallel computations\na : Anisotropic conductivity: \"vn\", isotropic conductivity: \"scalar\"\np : Flag to use pardiso solver\nt : Cortical target (x y z coordinate or r2 result file)\nq : Electric field quantity to optimize (\u201cE_mag\u201d (default), \u201cE_norm\u201d, \u201cE_tan\u201d)\nc : Coil .nii.gz file\nTIMING: 6-24h (depending on the computational resources and the number of simulations)\nFIGURE 16\n:\nOptimal coil position for rMT determination.\n(a) Set of 4825 candidate coil positions and orientations. Color indicates the electric field magnitude in the cortical target (here: FDI); (b) Electric field magnitude on the GM surface from the optimal coil position. The black spot is the cortical target (R\u00b2 hotspot from Fig. 15) determined by the previous localization. Areas more superficial than the cortical target receive a stronger field exposure.\nDetermining the individual field threshold\n16 Session preparation\nThe exact resting motor threshold is determined in a separate TMS session. Create a copy of the first TMS session with the TMS Navigator software. Repeat steps 7-8 to prepare the volunteer.\nCAUTION: Use the TMS coil considered during the calculation of the optimal coil position for the rMT determination (step 15).\nTIMING: 20 min\n17 Determining the exact resting motor threshold\nLoad the instrument marker file opt/.../opt_coil_pos_m1.xml that contains the optimal coil position and orientation with the IMPorter tool. Determine the rMT for the muscle of interest (e.g. FDI) with this coil position/orientation. The rMT is defined as the minimum stimulator intensity which leads to MEPs with an amplitude of at least 50 \u03bcV in at least 5 out of 10 consecutive TMS pulses41,44,50. The rMT should be lowest for the optimized coil position/orientation compared to locations around the optimum.\nTIMING: 5 min\n18 Determining the individual cortical field threshold\nFinally, the individual cortical field threshold can be computed. This step combines the localization of the cortical origins of the MEPs (step 14), the exact rMT that activates these neuronal populations (step 17), and the field distribution of the optimal stimulation position/orientation (step 15). The electric field intensity in the hotspot (in V/m) for a stimulator intensity of 1 A/\u00b5s is saved in the file opt/.../opt_coil_pos_m1.hdf5. Multiplication with the vendor and coil specific current/intensity factor and the rMT yields the electric field strength needed to effectively stimulate the neural population. For a MagVenture X100 stimulator and a MagVenture MCF-B65 coil the factor is 1.43 A/\u00b5s/%.\nTIMING: 5 min", "Phenol-chloroform RNA isolation from Nematostella\r\n\n\n1.
