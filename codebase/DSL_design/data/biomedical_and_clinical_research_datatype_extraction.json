{"original_protocol": ["1. Protocol Text\nPatients are scanned by RTVue Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system (Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) using the circumpapillary double-circular scan (CDCS) and the 3D optic disc scan.\n\t\nThe CDCS pattern consists of two concentric circles around the optic nerve head. The inner ring diameter is 3.40 mm and the outer ring diameter is 3.75 mm. This pattern transects all branch retinal arteries and veins emanating from the optic nerve head. The double circles are performed 6 times in a single scan to cover about 2 cardiac cycles. To calculate Flow velocity, Doppler shift and Doppler will be estimated on vessel detected in the OCT image. (Figure 1a, Figure 1b)\nA \"dual angle\" protocol is used to acquire Doppler OCT scans. In the \"dual-angle\" protocol, 3 scans are obtained with the OCT beam passing through the superonasal portion of the pupil and 3 scans through the inferonasal portion.\nThe quality of each scan is evaluated for signal strength, motion error, and Doppler angle. The technician is required to re-do any scan that did not pass the quality check. A total of 6 acceptable CDCS scans are performed for each eye. The \"dual-angle\" protocol ensures that, for each vessel, at least half of the scans provide good Doppler angles.\nThe 3D disc scan pattern is a raster scan covering a 6x6 mm region around the optic disc. It is only done once and provides a detailed en face image of this area. (Figure 1b)\nA color photograph of the optic disc is also imported to help distinguish arteries and veins.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3524/3524fig1a.jpg\n Figure 1a.  Measuring total blood flow with the circumpapillary double-circular scan and the 3D disk scan using DOCTORC.The Doppler angle is the angle between probe beam and normal vector of the vessel, and the Doppler signal is the Doppler frequency shift proportional to the flow velocity component parallel to the axis of the probe beam. Thus flow velocity can be estimated from Doppler angle and Doppler signal. However, both Doppler angle and Doppler signal become unreliable when they are below the noise level. On the other hand, when Doppler angle is large, The Doppler shift will be out of the measureable range. When the Doppler angle is appropriate, about 5-15 degrees for the FD-OCT system used in this study, the flow velocity can be correctly estimated by Doppler shift and angle.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3524/3524fig1b.jpg\n Figure 1b. \nThe Doppler angle in each vessel is measured by the relative positions of the vessel lumina in the two concentric circular scans. The axial component of the flow velocity is obtained by the Doppler shift measured from the relative phase of adjacent OCT axial scans. The total flow velocity is calculated from the axial flow component and the Doppler angle. The flow in each vessel is then calculated by integrating the total velocity profile over vessel cross-sectional area. The vessel pattern is matched to the en face image of the 3D disk scan and fundus photograph to identify each vessel as either a vein or an artery. The total retinal flow is calculated by summing flow in the major retinal veins, i.e., those with luminal diameters above 33 \u03bcm.\nAll scans of the same eye are exported as raw data using the RTVue software. The raw OCT images, including both Doppler and intensity images, are first tested for image quality using \"Doppler optical coherence tomography of retinal circulation\" (DOCTORC) software.Eye movements are measured by the pooled standard deviation of the inner limiting membrane and the maximum difference between two frames that is estimated by the bulk motion.\nSignal strength (reflectance and estimation of average Doppler angle) are also calculated.\nAccording to the average eye movement and signal strength of the repeated scans, the data is classified as either \"good\" or \"poor\" in quality. Only good quality data are graded.\nFor acceptable scans, an automated segmentation algorithm is applied to each OCT image for vessel detection.\n\t\nAn automated algorithm that matches vessels is used to locate the same vessel in each frame. The frames on the same circle are registered, and two averaged frames of the inner ring and outer ring are created. Both reflectance and Doppler images are averaged.\nFor an overview, the detected vessel is projected as a line segment onto the en face fundus image calculated from the 3D disc scan.\nGraders review each vessel on a small portion of the averaged inner and outer ring frames overlaid with a circle that represents the automated segmentation result.\n\t\nThe grader judges if the location, vessel diameter, and vessel type (vein/artery) matching the vessel on the two rings are correct according to the OCT image, en face OCT image, and disc photograph of the same eye.\nThe grader is allowed to change any of the above values if he thinks it is necessary. The grader also judges the quality of the Doppler signal in the vessel and gives a subjective confidence score for the vessel label on each scan.A confidence score of 0-5 is automatically given to each vessel based on Doppler signal strength in the vessel area. It is then manually corrected by the grader based on the strength of the vessel Doppler signal, regularity of vessel boundary, agreement between inner and outer rings of vessel size, and sign agreement of Doppler shift between inner and outer rings.\nAfter all vessels are verified and corrected, an automated algorithm is applied to calculate the blood flow of each vein with a method adapted from our previous publication.1\nThe Doppler signal is integrated over the vessel area and then averaged among all frames. Then the Doppler flow is calculated as the summed Doppler signal divided by the Doppler angle.\nFor each vessel, 6 scans are evaluated on subjective confidence scores, Doppler angles, and Coefficient of variation of the Doppler angles. The flow of a vein is considered valid only if more than 1 scan passes the quality check. For vessels that pass the quality check, the flow is averaged among valid scans.\nFor vessel with invalid results, the flow is estimated using the vessel area and the average flow speed from valid veins. The average flow speed is calculated by summing the flows in the valid veins and dividing by the summed areas of those veins. The estimate of flow starts from the average flow speed and is then corrected for the dependence of flow velocity on vessel area. Larger vessels have a higher average flow velocity. Thus the correction is made based upon the slope of average velocity versus vessel diameter, 2.13, that we previously reported.2\nThe calculated flow of valid veins and the estimated flow of invalid veins are added to determine the total retinal blood flow.The total retinal blood flow result is evaluated based on the valid venous area percentage, eye movement, and signal strength.\nVenous area and total arterial area are also obtained by adding the vessel areas. Assuming the total retinal blood flow is same in arteries and veins, the arterial and venous velocities are calculated by dividing total blood flow with arterial area and venous area.\n2. Representative Results\nNormal and glaucomatous eyes are selected from the Advanced Imaging for Glaucoma Study (AIGS, www.aigstudy.net[href=http://www.aigstudy.net]). 48 eyes were scanned by the \"dual-angle\" protocol and produced scans that passed the image quality check. Using the DOCTORC software, valid flow measurements could be obtained from 83% of the eyes.\nTo evaluate the reproducibility of the DOCTORC system, another small dataset with 20 eyes was graded by 3 graders. This dataset was also used to train and test graders. 2 graders used the semi-automated DOCTORC software and 1 used an earlier totally manual software employed in previous publications.2,3 The total retinal blood flows (Table 1) determined by the two graders using DOCTORC software are similar to one another and to flow rates determined by the other grader using the manual software. Only 65% of the eyes had valid results because some of the data were not based on dual angle protocol, but single angle protocol.2 The single angle protocol includes 5 Doppler scans obtained with the OCT beam passing through the center of the pupil. Therefore the Doppler angle is more often small and therefore a greater portion of vessels are usually not gradable.For all graders, the inter-grader reproducibility, as measured by the coefficient of variation, is similar for both glaucomatous and normal eyes (Table 2). Likewise, the reproducibility measurements for the two methods, DOCTORC and the Manual software,1-5 are similar (Table 2). For three graders, a good correlation exists between total blood flow and the pattern standard deviation from visual field tests (Figure 2) for glaucomatous eyes.\ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2,3\n,DOCTORC software Manual software3,DOCTORC software Manual software3,DOCTORC software Manual software3\nCondition,Grader 1,Grader 2,\nNormal,47.0\u00b19.1,48.7\u00b17.2,48.0\u00b16.5\nGlaucoma,36.5\u00b15.5,36.7\u00b15.9,34.9\u00b15.1\nTable 1.

See list of cases used for this protocol (Table 1).\n1. Preparation of Buffers\nPrepare 1X TBS (Tris-buffered saline) buffer:\n\t\nPrepare 10X TBS as stock solution with 500 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 1,500 mM NaCl.\n\t\t\nWeigh out 60.5 g Tris-Cl pH 7.6 and 87.6 g of NaCl in 800 ml of high purity water. Adjust pH with 1 M HCl and make the final stock volume to 1 L.\nPrepare the final concentration of 1X TBS by diluting the stock 10 times in distilled water.\nAdd protease inhibitors (PI), (1 tablet per 50 ml buffer) and Phos-stop phosphatase inhibitor tablets (1 tablet per 10 ml of buffer) to abrogate the effects of non-specific enzymatic actions of proteases and phosphatases.\n\t\tNote: Here we have used the enzyme inhibitor tablets from Roche but equally other commercially available inhibitors can be used according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nPrepare TBS-SDS buffer by adding 5% w/v Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to 1X TBS (pH 7.4) buffer. Heat the solution to 60 \u00b0C with constant stirring using a magnetic stirrer to solubilize SDS.\nPrepare TBS-SDS-Urea buffer by adding urea to a final concentration of 8 M w/v to 1X TBS-SDS buffer (pH 7.4). Heat the solution to 60 \u00b0C with constant stirring on a magnetic stirrer to dissolve urea.\n2. Sample Homogenization and Differential UltracentrifugationNote: The following part of the work involves handling of human brain tissue according to the rules of HTA UK. Local standard operating procedures are followed at all times. Brain samples are dissected from frozen brain blocks and tissue material homogenized in a microcabinet maintained at negative pressure. Disposable gowns gloves, face-masks, over-shoe protectors and safety goggles are worn throughout the procedure. Human tissue waste is discarded after autoclaving at 121 \u00b0C for 20 min for safe disposal. Sharps (scalpel blades) are disposed in an appropriate sharps container for containment and safe disposal.\nTake a chunk of frozen human tissue (approximately 0.5 g in weight from the basal ganglia region) and rapidly mince into small fragments (approximately 1 mm2) on ice using a small petri-dish and a sterile scalpel blade. Use a separate petri-dish and scalpel blade for each sample. Collect the minced tissue in a 15 ml tube and add 10 volumes of ice-cold 1XTBS buffer to the tube.\nHomogenize the samples using a mechanical homogenizer at 20,000 rpm for 10 sec. Cool on ice for 2 min. Repeat this step three times.\n\tNote: This is done so that the samples are not heated up while homogenizing.\nClarify by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Discard pellet of non-homogenized material.\nTake supernatant (crude homogenate), add to polycarbonate centrifuge tubes (size of tube depends on rotor size) and balance carefully. Centrifuge at 100,000 x g for 1 hr at 4 \u00b0C.\nRetain supernatant as this is the TBS-soluble fraction.\nWash pellet twice in five volumes of 1X TBS buffer and centrifuge each time at 100,000 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Discard the supernatants.Resuspend the final pellet by sonicating the pellet for 10 sec at 20 KHz in approximately 5 volumes of 1X TBS-SDS at RT.\n\t\tNote: Before addition of the SDS containing buffer samples should be brought at 10 \u00b0C to avoid SDS precipitation.\nUltracentrifuge at 100,000 x g for 30 min at 25 \u00b0C.\nRetain supernatant as this is the SDS soluble fraction.\n\t\nWash pellet twice in 5 volumes of 1X TBS-SDS buffer at RT. Centrifuge each time at 100,000 x g for 15 min at 25 \u00b0C.\nSolubilize the final pellet in 50 \u03bcl of 1X TBS-SDS-UREA buffer using a sonicator set at 20 KHz for 10 sec\u00a0to attain complete solubilization; this is termed the urea soluble fraction.\nAssay each fraction for total protein content using a commercial protein assay kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Dilute TBS-SDS-Urea samples 1:1 with 1X TBS buffer to allow compatibility with protein assay reagents. Freeze samples in small aliquots (20 \u03bcl) at -80 \u00b0C to reduce freeze-thaw cycles.\n\tNote: Adding 10% glycerol to samples is recommended for long-term storage at -80 \u00b0C.\n3. Immunoblotting of Samples and Analyzing Results\nRun samples from TBS, TBS-SDS and TBS-SDS-Urea extracts on 10-well 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel with MOPS as running buffer using standard techniques. See Gallagher and Chakravarti (2008)29 for a detailed western blot protocol.\nLoad 10 \u00b5g of protein from each sample onto each lane along with a molecular weight marker for TBS and SDS and urea fractions.\nRun gel at 200 V for 1 hr or until the blue dye from loading buffer has reached the bottom of the gel.Transfer proteins from gels electrophoretically onto nylon membranes28, pre-wetted first in 100% methanol and then into transfer buffer containing 20% methanol. Provide an identification mark on the blot to determine the protein side and the orientation of the Molecular-Weight size markers.\n\t\nSandwich the gel with the membrane alongside wet filter paper. Correct placement of membrane is crucial with the membrane between the gel and the anode. Perform the transfer for 2 hr at 40 V.\nMake up 1X PBS-tween (1X PBS-T) buffer: Dissolve 1 tablet of PBS in 200 ml water to yield 0.01 M phosphate buffer, 0.0027 M potassium chloride and 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4.\nBlock the membrane in 5% BSA solution in 1X PBS-T for 30 min with shaking at 70 rpm. This prevents non-specific binding of primary antibody to the membrane.\nProbe the protein blot with 6 ml of \u03b1-syn primary antibody Syn-1 (BD Biosciences; mouse monoclonal antibody) at 1:750 dilution (O/N at 4 \u00b0C) followed by a series of washes with 1X PBS-T (3 x 5 min each time)28.\nIncubate the blot with the appropriate HRP conjugated secondary antibody at 1:2,000 dilution for 30 min. Perform a series of washes (3 x 5 min each time) with 1X PBS-T.\n\t\nImmerse blots in enhanced chemiluminescence solution for 15 sec\u00a0in a dark room. Cover blots with a cling film and place autoradiography films against the blot with protein side up in a light-proof cassette to capture the appropriate signals (appropriate size bands).\nDevelop autoradiography films in an automated developer.\n\t\tNote: Blots can also be developed manually using developer and fixer from a commercial source in case an automated developer machine is not available.Incubate the western blot with 6 ml of western blot stripping buffer for 10 min with constant shaking to strip the blot of \u03b1-syn antibody signal. Follow steps 3.43 through to 3.6.2 using beta-actin primary antibody (Mouse monoclonal) at 1: 8,000 dilution.\nScan and convert the final image into a Tiff image and measure densities using NIH ImageJ for quantitation purposes (a free downloadable software).\n\tNote: The software allows reading of densities of relative area of interest (the appropriate size bands) and the data can be expressed either as a ratio of \u03b1-syn density / \u03b2-actin (a house-keeping gene) as arbitrary units or on its own when a house keeping gene is not valid (as in the case of urea-soluble samples).", "All mouse studies were conducted after obtaining approval from the Emory University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.\n1. Preparation on the day of isolation\nPrepare an ice bucket to keep all reagents, buffers, and cell suspensions cold throughout the isolation procedure.\nPlace the bottle of 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (at least 1 L) at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min to 1 h prior to perfusion and keep 1\u00d7 PBS on ice during the perfusion and isolation procedure.\nPrepare working concentration of the density gradient medium (referred to as 35% SIP, see Table of Materials).\nLabel all the conical and flow cytometry tubes used in the experiment prior to cell isolation to avoid delays in processing times. Additionally, gather all other supplies necessary for the isolation prior to perfusion, such as 40 \u00b5m cell strainers, syringes, and needles.\n2. Acute isolation of adult mouse microglia\nAnesthetize an adult mouse by placing the mouse in a glass induction chamber with isoflurane (5 mL) until the mouse stops breathing and fails to respond to hindlimb paw pinch.\nUse a 26 G needle and 10 mL syringe to perform cardiac perfusion with 30 mL of ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS until there is no visual blood.\nDecapitate the mouse with surgical scissors. Use small scissors to cut the skin, exposing the skull. Remove the skull without damaging the brain tissue as described24. Remove the brain immediately and transfer to a sterile 40 \u00b5m cell strainer placed on top of a 50 mL conical tube.Use the backside of the plunger of a 3 mL syringe to push the brain through the strainer and mechanically dissociate the entire brain tissue. Wash the cell strainer and plunger intermittently during the dissociation with 2 mL of ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS each time to ensure all the tissue passes through the strainer.\nScrape the bottom of the cell strainer with the plunger to collect any residual suspension into the conical. Thoroughly flush the cell strainer with ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS and pour the suspension into the 50 mL conical tube.\n\tNOTE: When processing multiple animals in series, place the cell suspensions on ice until further processing.\nAdd ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS to bring the cell-suspension volume to 30 mL and centrifuge at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nPour off the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and re-suspend the pellet in 6 mL of 35% SIP with a 10 mL serological pipette. Transfer the cell suspension + 35% SIP mixture to a new 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 800 \u00d7 g for 25 min at 15 \u00b0C with no brake.\n\tCAUTION: Take special care to avoid introduction of bubbles during re-suspension. Excessive bubbles can be detrimental to cell yield.\nCarefully remove the 15 mL conical tube from the centrifuge without disturbing the layers and aspirate the top floating myelin layer.\nTransfer the cell suspension + 35% SIP mixture using a 10 mL serological pipette to a new 50 mL conical tube containing 30 mL of ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS and centrifuge at 800 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Carefully pour the supernatant off, leaving behind the cell pellet along with 500\u2012800 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS.Re-suspend the cell pellet by gently pipetting up and down with a p1000 pipette and transfer to a 5 mL round bottom tube. Add 2 mL of ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS to the round bottom tube and centrifuge at 1,400 \u00d7 g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C. Quickly pour off the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet containing CNS-MPs in about 100 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS (Figure 1).\n3. Phagocytosis set-up and flow cytometric staining\nTransfer 20 \u00b5L (\u2248200,000 cells) of the re-suspended CNS-MPs to a fresh 5 mL round bottom tube and add 80 \u00b5L of ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS. Do not add any fluorescent substrates or flow cytometry antibodies to this tube. These cells serve as a negative control to determine background fluorescence of CNS-MPs for flow cytometry analyses.\nTo establish the viability of the isolated CNS-MPs, use amine-based live/dead dyes (e.g., Fixable Blue UV).\n\t\nResuspend the rest of the cell pellet in 500 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS and add 1 \u00b5L of the reconstituted dye to each sample tube except the negative control.\nGently vortex, cover the tubes with foil, and incubate them at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, add 1 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS to each tube and gently vortex.\nCentrifuge the cells at 1,400 \u00d7 g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C. Quickly pour off the supernatant\u00a0and re-suspend the cell pellet in 100 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Amine-based dyes will bind to the extracellular A\u03b2 fibrils confounding the results of phagocytosis. Other live/dead indicators might interfere with the fluorescence of A\u03b2 fibrils/microspheres. Hence it is advised to used Live/dead indicator only in preliminary experiments to establish the viability of the isolated CNS-MPs.Thoroughly vortex the tube containing PE-polystyrene microspheres and add 2 \u00b5L (\u2248200 microspheres/cell) to 100 \u00b5L of cell suspension in flow tubes except for the negative control. Gently vortex each tube to ensure equal distribution of the substrate with the cells and place the round bottom tubes in a sterile humidified incubator for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2.\n\t\nGently vortex and incubate the negative control tube to ensure similar experimental conditions between positive and negative samples.\n\t\tNOTE: If using A\u03b2 fibrils instead of PE-microspheres, prepare fluorescent HiLyte488 A\u03b2 fibrils as described previously9. The final concentration of A\u03b2 fibrils is 200 \u00b5M which is then diluted to prepare fresh 20 \u00b5M stock in PBS of fluorescent A\u03b2 monomers. Add 12.5 \u00b5L of the 20 \u00b5M stock A\u03b2 monomers to each tube containing isolated cells.\nRemove the cells from the incubator and add 1 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS to each tube and gently vortex. Centrifuge the cells at 1,400 \u00d7 g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C and quickly pour off the supernatant. Repeat the wash with 1 mL 1\u00d7 PBS, centrifuge at 1,400 \u00d7 g for 2 min, pour off the supernatant, and re-suspend the cell pellet in 100 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS.\n\tNOTE: After each spin, it is important to keep the cells on ice to inhibit ongoing phagocytic uptake.\nVortex the flow-cytometry antibodies and centrifuge them in a microcentrifuge for 10 s. To each cell suspension tube add 1 \u00b5L each of CD11b-APC/Cy7 and CD45-PE/Cy7 for A\u03b2 phagocytosis assay, or CD45-FITC for PE-microsphere phagocytosis. Gently vortex each tube and incubate in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.NOTE: Users can also include a separate tube containing potent phagocytic cells such as cultured BV2 microglia or peritoneal macrophages as positive control and treat them with PE-microspheres, and flow cytometric antibodies as described above. Data from this sample can be used to define the positive control denoting true phagocytosis in preliminary experiments.\nWhile the cells are in incubation, set up compensation tubes using four round bottom 5 mL flow tubes. Thoroughly vortex the compensation beads and add 1 drop to each tube. Add 1 \u00b5L of CD11b-APC/Cy7 to the first tube and CD45-FITC to second the tube. Add 1 \u00b5L of PE-polystyrene to the third tube and keep unstained compensation beads in fourth tube. Use this fourth tube as a negative control to set up a compensation panel on the flow cytometer.\n\tNOTE: When A\u03b2 fibrils are used to study phagocytosis, add CD45-PECy7 to second tube instead of CD45-FITC. Add 1 \u00b5L of separate FITC tagged flow cytometry antibody or FITC-secondary antibody (any species) to the third compensation tube. This is important since the beads cannot bind to A\u03b2 fibrils and will get washed away upon washing of the compensation tubes.\nAllow the compensation beads to incubate with their respective antibodies for at least 10 min. After incubation, add 1 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS to each tube, centrifuge at 1,400 x g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C, and quickly pour off the supernatant. Place the compensation tubes on ice and cover them with the foil until flow cytometry.Following incubation with flow-cytometry antibodies, wash the stained cells with 1 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS. Gently vortex and centrifuge the cells at 1,400 \u00d7 g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C. Quickly pour off the supernatant and repeat the wash with 1 mL\u00a01\u00d7 PBS. After centrifugation, pour off the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 100 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS.\nPlace the sample tubes on ice and cover them with the aluminum foil until flow cytometry.\n\tNOTE: Use 1\u00d7 PBS (pH 7.0) without Ca2+/Mg2+ as flow buffer throughout the experiment. Ensure to exclude fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the flow buffer to avoid possible microglial activation.\n4. Flow cytometry and analysis\nInstrument set-up and compensation\n\tNOTE: The experiments in this manuscript were performed on a flow cytometer with ultra-violet, violet, blue, yellow-green and red lasers. This experiment can be also adapted to three-laser flow-cytometers with blue, yellow-green and red lasers only. Users need to undergo formal training before handling the instrument.\n\t\nRefill the flow sheath buffer tank and turn on the cytometer. \u201cPrime\u201d the cytometer with a 5 mL round bottom flow tube containing ddH2O. Log into the analysis software on the computer connected to the flow-cytometer. Create an \u201cexperiment\u201d and select FSC, SSC, FITC, PECy7 and APC-Cy7 as the parameters. If using PE-microspheres, select PE instead of PECy7 in the parameter panel.\nCreate an appropriate compensation panel.\n\t\tNOTE: In our experiments, typically the FSC/SSC voltages for compensation beads is around 350/280, whereas FSC/SSC voltages for CNS-MPs is around 320/260. These values can vary\u00a0between any two different cytometers and need\u00a0to be calibrated prior to the actual experiment.Reconstitute each compensation and cell suspension tube with 500 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS, briefly vortex, and place on ice. Run the negative control/unstained bead tube to set appropriate voltages such that the peak on each fluorophore histogram is below 102. Run the other single-color compensation tubes to identify their distinct positive peaks.\n\t\tNOTE: There should be at least half log (base 10) difference between the positive and negative peaks of each fluorophore.\nRecord 5000 events from each compensation tube to allow the computer to auto-calculate the compensation set-up. Link the compensation set-up to the current experiment25.\nCreate a new \u201ctube\u201d under the sample tab. Gently vortex and run the negative control tube containing unstained CNS-MPs. Adjust the forward and side scatter voltages to capture the population of interest. Record the events and sub-gate on the live CNS-MPs as mentioned below.\nCapture and record events from all subsequent tubes as separate files keeping the parameters and voltages consistent. Gently vortex each tube before running them on the flow-cytometer.\nGating strategy and measurement of phagocytosis\nDraw an initial mononuclear gate to capture all CNS-MPs. These live mononuclear cells must be gated in the following graph to include only single cells, excluding couplets and triplets.\nProject the gated single, live CNS-MPs population on a subsequent graph displaying CD11b and CD45 fluorophores.\n\t\tNOTE: Brain resident microglia are typically CD11b+CD45intermediate, whereas infiltrating macrophages are CD11b+CD45high. Additional markers such as Ly6c may be included in the panel to further confidently separate inflammatory monocytes (Ly6chigh and CD45high) from microglia (Ly6clow CD45intermediate).\nApply appropriate gates to further study phagocytosis in respective populations as shown in Figure 2F.NOTE: Phagocytosis in CNS-MPs is measured as a function of their Hilyte488/Alexa488 (A\u03b2) or PE (microsphere) fluorescence uptake. Distinct positive peak on their respective histograms indicate that the CNS-MPs have phagocytosed the substrate. Quantity of material phagocytosed is directly proportional to the intensity of the fluorescence. Hence, presence of multiple peaks must be interpreted as higher phagocytosis. These can be subsequently confirmed by immunohistochemistry.\nAfter recording all the sample tubes on the flow-cytometer, export the data files in .fcs format for further analysis.\nStatistical data analysis\nUse any flow-cytometry analysis software along with spreadsheets and statistical analysis software for all data analyses.\nAdd the .fcs\u00a0files to analysis software and double click on the first file. A\u00a0graph displaying all the recorded\n\t\tevents will appear. Follow similar\u00a0gating strategy as shown\u00a0in Figure 2 to subsequently gate\u00a0single, live mononuclear cells and\u00a0study phagocytosis on specific\u00a0population, for example CD11b+CD45intermediate\u00a0microglial cells\u00a0(Figure 2H).\n\t\tNOTE: Phagocytic index is assessed based on the proportion of cells internalizing fluorescent A\u03b2 fibrils or \u22651 microsphere(s). As defined previously, low-level phagocytosis is uptake of at least 1 microsphere and high-level phagocytosis is >1 bead uptake8,9. Based on prior experiments, inhibition of actin-dependent processes by cytochalasin D completely inhibits >1 bead uptake and partly inhibits 1 bead uptake9 as well as completely inhibits A\u03b2 uptake, confirming actin-dependent phagocytic uptake rather than passive binding to the cell surface. Immunocytochemistry also confirms that each sequential peak in the microsphere assay is representative of a unitary increase in the numbers of beads phagocytosed8,9.\nSubscription Required.

All the procedures involving animals described in this protocol must be carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the International Council for Laboratory Animal Science (ICLAS).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56291/56291fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Scheme illustrating the principal experimental steps of the procedure, i.e.: cell culture, live imaging, PICC and data collection, single cell tracking, and the final outcome. The steps are numbered according to the work-flow of the protocol. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56291/56291fig1large.jpg]\n1. Cell Culture: Isolation and Plating of the Selected Neural Population or Cell Lineage\nNOTE: In conjunction with this protocol, examples of its application to distinct cell populations are given to validate its utility to analyze the biology of neural cells. These include: Adult Neural Stem Cells (aNSCs) derived from the mouse SubEpendymal Zone (SEZ) (for a detailed isolation protocol see14); Postnatal cortical astrocytes to study neuronal reprogramming (for a detailed isolation protocol see15); Postnatal cerebellar astrocytes (for a detailed isolation method see16); and Mouse Neuro-2a Neuroblastoma Cell line (N2a).\nSeed the cells directly on poly-D-lysine coated 24-well plates. Use 1 mL of culture medium per well. Incubate the plates at 37 \u00b0C and 8% CO2 for aNSCs, or at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for the astrocytes/cell line for 2 h prior to live imaging. Avoid the use of coverslips to prevent undesired movement as the motorized microscope stage is displaced which makes single cell tracking unfeasible.NOTE: Cell densities and culture media employed in the experiments are: 30-40,000 cells/well for aNSCs in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM:F12 Nutrient Mixture medium); 20,000 cells/well for N2a cells in DMEM High Glucose medium, 80,000 cells/well for cerebellar astrocytes in DMEM High Glucose medium; and 55-65,000 cells/well for postnatal astrocytes in DMEM:F12 Nutrient Mixture medium.\nStandardize the culture protocol by adjusting the cell density of the culture to the lowest number of cells feasible. Nonetheless, the cell density must be sufficiently high to maintain the viability of the culture.\n\tNOTE: If the cell density is too high, the excess debris or poor dissociation (clumps) may hinder tracking of single cells.\n2. Live Imaging by Time-lapse Video-microscopy\nTurn on the microscope, camera, hardware, and incubation systems. Set the temperature and air pressure to 37 \u00b0C and 8% CO2 for aNSCs, or to 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for the astrocytes/cell line. Allow the temperature and CO2 levels to stabilize for 1-2 h.\n\tNOTE: Specific equipment is required to perform time-lapse video analysis, including: bright field/phase contrast/fluorescence microscopes with motorized components; incubation devices that control the temperature, CO2 and humidity; and finally, reliable and sufficiently powerful hardware and software capable of acquiring and handling the volume of pictures obtained during live imaging experiments (Please check the Table of Materials).\nOnce the cells are firmly attached to the plate (2 h after plating), use a permanent marker pen to make a small mark on the bottom of one well that will not be used for tracking, i.e., a well that does not contain cells.\n\tNOTE: This mark will be used as a reference to zero the xyz coordinates, and it can be used at any time during or after the experiment, or between the changes of medium, to return to the zero position.Place the plate inside the microscope's incubation chamber and firmly attach the plate to the stage to avoid any undesired movement during the displacement of the microscope's motorized stage.\nAllow the temperature of the cell culture medium to equilibrate in the chamber for approximately 20 min. This step will avoid a loss of focus during the recording due to the dilation of components.\nStart the live-imaging software and select the time-lapse module to set up the experiment.\nSet the total duration of the experiment and the image acquisition cycles in the \"time-schedule tab menu\". Due to the inherent phototoxicity of the transmitted or fluorescence light used, define an adequate interval to balance between the temporal resolution of the analysis and the potential cell death.\n\tNOTE: For example, a total of 120 h was selected for aNSC cultures, acquiring brightfield pictures every 5 min. Consider that the acquisition of 120 h of a single movie in this configuration will require 120-150 gigabytes of free storage space in the computer device.\nSelect the image positions defined by the x and y coordinates, and the focal distance (the z coordinate) in the \"xyz points tab menu\". Include the reference point (xyz zero coordinate) as the initial position in order to retrieve the coordinates at any time.\nSelect the type of acquisition in the \"wavelength selection tab menu\", brightfield only or in combination with epifluorescence excitation when required. Select the exposure time. Bear in mind that over-exposure to transmitted, and especially fluorescent light, may compromise cell viability (as indicated above).\n\t\nFor aNSCs, cerebellar astrocytes, and N2a cells, select brightfield (10-50 ms exposure time).For transduced cortical astrocytes select brightfield (10-50 ms exposure time) in combination with red/green fluorescence, depending of the reporter used for the experiment (red excitation wavelength: 550 nm and 400 ms exposure time; green excitation wavelength: 460-500 nm and 100 ms exposure time).\nDefine the name of the experiment and the folder where the images will be stored. Save the list of positions to reload the experiment at any time, and once all the conditions have been set, run the experiment by clicking on the \"run now\" button.\nPause the experiment and re-adjust the focus conditions clicking the \"overwrite z button\" once per day until the experiment is completed. If changes in the medium are required during the live imaging, pause the experiment and retrieve the plate from the time lapse chamber. Next, change the medium under sterile conditions and place the plate back to the stage (see step 2.3). Re-adjust the focus conditions and resume the experiment.\n\tNOTE: The changes in pH of the medium due to cell death or over-proliferation, as well as variations in room temperature, may affect the correct focusing of the microscope on the cells. For sensitive cultures (such as aNSCs) we recommend the use of medium supplemented with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (final concentration: 1 mM).\n3. Post-imaging Immunocytochemistry (PICC), Data Collection, and Processing\nOnce the experiment is completed, pause the software and retrieve the plate for fixation and PICC, as described in the next steps.\nPerform cell fixation: wash the cells once with 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and add 500 \u00b5L of paraformaldehyde (PFA) (4% in PBS), incubating 10 min at room temperature (RT).\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is a strong fixative and should be handled carefully to avoid contact with skin or eyes. It must be manipulated only inside a fume hood.Wash the cells three times with 1 mL of PBS and add 500 \u00b5L of the blocking solution (PBS containing 2% (wt/vol) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2% (vol/vol) of a non-ionic surfactant). Incubate 1 h at RT.\nRemove the blocking solution and add 250-400 \u00b5L of the primary antibodies solution. Incubate 2 h at RT. The primary antibodies solution contains primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 2% (wt/vol) of BSA and 0.2% (vol/vol) of a non-ionic surfactant. Antibodies used in the experiments described here: GFAP (1:500), \u03b2III-tubulin (1:1,000) and \u03b1-tubulin (1:1,000). As this is carried out directly in the well, larger volumes of the solutions are required (250-400 \u00b5L) to cover all the cells.\nWash three times with 1 mL of PBS and add 250-400 \u00b5L of the secondary antibodies solution (diluted as described in step 3.4). Secondary antibodies used in the experiments described here: Anti-Mouse Fluorescein (FITC) (1:800), Anti-Rabbit Cy3 (1:500). Incubate 1 h at RT in the dark.\nWash three times in 1 mL of PBS. Keep the cells in 1 mL of PBS for the subsequent steps of the protocol.\nPlace the plate back on the microscope stage and firmly attach it to the stage to avoid undesired movement during the displacement of the motorized microscope stage.\nRetrieve the xyz zero position using the mark made in step 2.2 and re-set the positions to this reference point by pressing the \"Offset All X, Y, Z\" button. Re-set the focal distance for each position.\nAcquire a final round of images, configuring the conditions necessary for fluorescence emission in the \"wavelength selection tab menu\" in order to detect the antigens previously targeted in the PICC.Briefly, in addition to brightfield, activate FITC (Excitation: 495 nm) and Cy3 (Excitation: 550 nm) acquisition options in the software. Use 10-50 ms for brightfield 400 ms exposure to detect the fluorophores and press the \"1 time loop\" button, to acquire a final round of pictures.\n\t\tNOTE: The intensity of the fluorescence may differ depending on the PICC outcome. Adjust the exposition time in order to obtain the optimal image quality.\nSelect the software's file/export option and export the pictures in Tagged Image File Format (Tiff) or Joint Photographic Experts Group format (Jpeg) to a pre-defined destination folder.\nConvert the images exported to the format required by the tracking software: The Tracking Tool17 (tTt). To achieve this, define the input and output folder in the \"tTt Converter tool\" operating window, as well as the markers used for the positions (xy), channels (c), and time-points (t), and press the \"convert images\" button.\n\tNOTE: The images must be renamed in accordance with the specific settings and they must be stored in individual folders for each position used in the experiment. Instructions for the installation, requirements, renaming of positions/images, and the use of the tracking tool are available for download at: https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/csd/software/tTt-and-qtfy.html.\n4. Single Cell Tracking\nAfter renaming the data, run the tTt software. Select a user name and tTt work folder.\n\tNOTE: The tracking tool work folder will hold all the analyzed data and the exported results. The work folder must be named tTtexport, containing subfolders named \"AVIexport\", \"Configs\", \"TreeExport\", and \"tTtfiles\".\nSelect the experiment to be loaded in the \"select experiment folder window\", indicating the folder path where the experiment is stored, and then click the \"Load experiment\" button.Run the log file converter to transform the loaded images into a format that can be read by the tracking software (for experiments loaded for the first time, this will be requested automatically by the software).\nSelect a position for tracking by clicking on its symbol (after conversion, an overview of the positions recorded during the experiments will be displayed in the \"position layout window\"). Each position will be represented by a symbol consisting in a picture of the position and its corresponding number (see Figure 1).\nOnce the position has been selected and a list of the images available is displayed on the right of the \"position layout window\", select them and click the \"Load images\" button.\nOnce loading is complete and the \"Cell Editor Window\" appears, select the wavelengths and image interval to be tracked in the \"Cell Editor Window\". Wavelength 0 corresponds to brightfield, 1 corresponds to FITC, 2 to Cy3, and 3 to DAPI. In the experiments described here, interval 1 was used, i.e., all images loaded. To clarify, interval 2 means loading of every second image.\nOnce the images have been loaded, go back to the \"position layout window\" and double-click on the icon representing the previously loaded position. The \"Movie Window\" will appear that allows the single cell tracking to be performed.\nFollowing the Tracking Tool instructions, proceed to tracking. Select the 0 channel (corresponding to brightfield), and adjust the brightness and contrast (\"adjust gamma button\"). Start the tracking by pressing the F2 key.NOTE: During tracking, the tracked cell will be followed by placing the mouse pointer on it and pressing the \"0\" key. The cell division, cell apoptosis and lost cell buttons are available to monitor these specific cell events. As the experiment is tracked, each of these options will be automatically displayed in the lineage tree drawn in the \"cell editor window\" as the experiment is being tracked.\nOnce the clone is tracked, match the brightfield pictures with the immunofluorescence images obtained by PICC to identify the nature of the cell progeny. Each epifluorescence channel will be represented in the \"Movie Window\" (channel 1, 2, etc.).\n5. Final Outcome\nOnce single cell tracking has been completed and the progeny identified, save the experiment (Cell Editor Window/File tab/ Save current tree as) and proceed to export the results.\nExport the lineage trees and cell data in the \"Export menu\" located in the \"Cell Editor Window\". Likewise, export the cell images and movies via the \"Export menu\" accessible through the \"Movie Window\". The images, lineage trees, data, and movies will be exported to the tTt work folder.", "1. Animal perfusion\nOn the day before perfusion, prepare:\n          - 2 L of phosphate buffer (PB; 100 mM, pH 7.4) and 1 L of sodium phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.9% NaCl in 50 mM PB, pH 7.4) in double distilled water. Store the PBS and 1L of PB at 4\u00b0C. These will be used for perfusion and pre-embedding immunocytochemistry.\n          - 1L of 4.0% paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH 7.4) fixative solution, which will enable the perfusion of 6 mice. For that purpose, heat up 1 L of PB under a fume hood. Weigh 40 g of granular paraformaldehyde (PFA) and pour into the PB solution when it reaches 60\u00b0C. When the solution is clear, with the PFA completely dissolved, cool to room temperature (RT) and store at 4\u00b0C.\nOn the day of perfusion, prepare 500 mL of 3.5% acrolein solution in PB under a fume hood. Then, filter the 3.5% acrolein and 4.0% PFA solutions using filter paper.\nFor mouse anesthesia, inject sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg) into the peritoneum with a 27 gauge \u00bd\" needle.\nDuring the perfusion, 50 mL of PBS, 75 mL of acrolein, and 150 mL of PFA will sequentially pass into the mouse circulation. To set up the peristaltic pump, fill the tubing with PBS and fix a 23 gauge \u00be\" butterfly needle at one end. Immerse the other end of the tubing into the perfusion solution (PBS, acrolein or PFA). Set the speed of the peristaltic pump to 20-25 mL/min for juvenile and adult mice. Throughout the perfusion, carefully avoid any bubbles of air forming in the tubing.Wait until the anaesthetized mouse no longer responds to painful stimuli, such as a tail pinch, before proceeding. Lay the animal in a dissection tray and fix the paws using tape. With tweezers and scissors, open up the skin and chest cavity to expose the heart. To minimize brain ischemia, the perfusion needs to be started rapidly. Cut open the right atrium with small scissors and start the peristaltic pump. While holding the heart with tweezers, insert the butterfly needle into the apex of the left ventricle.\nWhen changing solution, stop the peristaltic pump, transfer the tubing from one solution to another, and restart the pump immediately.\nWhen 150 mL of PFA has passed, stop the peristaltic pump. Using small scissors, cut off the head, open up the skin, and break the skull between the eyes. Using small tweezers, carefully chip off small pieces of skull until the brain can be easily removed. Post-fix the brain for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C in PFA. Wash 3 times 10 minutes in PBS.\nImmediately cut the brain in transverse (50 \u03bcm thick sections) in ice-cooled PBS using a vibratome. With a fine brush, transfer sections selected for immunocytochemistry into a glass vial containing PBS. Store the remaining sections at -20\u00b0C in cryoprotectant (30% ethylene glycol and 30% glycerol in PBS) for up to several years.\n2. Pre-embedding immunocytochemistry\nFor immunocytochemistry, sections are processed freely floating in glass vials. Throughout the procedure, one needs to carefully avoid letting sections dry out.\nFirst, remove the PBS using a transfer pipette and immediately replace with a fresh solution of 0.1% sodium borohydride in PBS for 30 minutes at RT.Rinse sections with PBS 3 times 10 minutes, removing all bubbles, and incubate for 2 hours at RT in a blocking solution of PBS containing 0.5% gelatin and 5% normal serum of the animal in which the secondary antibody was generated (normal goat serum in the present example of Iba1-immunostaining).\nIncubate for 48 hours with primary antibody in blocking solution. For Iba1-immunostaining, use rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody (1:1000).\nRinse sections with PBS 3 times 10 minutes and incubate in secondary antibody conjugated to biotin (1:1000) in blocking solution for 2 hours at RT.\n          For Iba1-immunostaining, use goat anti-rabbit IgGs.\nRinse sections with PBS 3 times 10 minutes and incubate in streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:1000) in blocking solution for 1 hour at RT.\nRinse sections with PBS 10 minutes and with Tris/HCl-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM, pH 7.4) 2 times 10 minutes. To reveal the labeling, incubate sections with 0.05% DAB and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in TBS (solution freshly prepared). When the staining is dark-brown (see example in Figure 1), stop the reaction by rinsing in TBS. In any case, end the reaction after a maximum of 5 minutes. Rinse sections with TBS 10 minutes and with PB 2 times 10 minutes.\n3. Processing for electron microscopy\nTransfer sections into PB in a multiwell culture plate using a fine brush. Prepare 1% osmium tetroxide solution in PB under a fuming hood. Remove PB from the wells of the culture plate and spread the sections flat with a fine brush. Immediately immerse sections in 1% osmium for 30 minutes at RT.Transfer the sections into glass vials, rinse with PB 3 times 10 minutes, and dehydrate through 2 minutes immersions into ascending concentrations of ethanol: 2 times 35%, 1 time each of 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 95%, 3 times 100%, followed by 3 times propylene oxide.\nTo prepare the Durcupan resin, combine 20 g of component A, 20 g of component B, 0.6 g of component C, and 0.4 g of component D into a disposable beaker, mix well until the color becomes uniform, and pour into an aluminum weigh dish. If needed, resin blocks can be prepared by pouring resin into embedding molds and curing in a 55\u00b0C oven for 48-72 hours.\nUsing a fine brush rinsed with propylene oxide, remove the sections from the propylene oxide and immerse into the Durcupan resin for impregnation overnight at RT.\nThe following day, put the aluminum weigh dish into a 55\u00b0C oven for 10 minutes to soften the resin. Using a brush rinsed with propylene oxide, coat an ACLAR embedding film with a thin layer of resin, lay down the sections, cover with another embedding film, and evenly distribute light weights (about 2 g; for example the plastic caps of glass vials) on top to help resin spreading. For resin polymerization, incubate in the oven for 48-72 hours (at 55\u00b0C).\nAfter polymerization, remove the light weights and embedding film on the top of the sections. Under a binocular microscope, select square areas of interest (about 2x2 mm) and carefully excise them from the film using a razor blade.\nGlue the areas of interest at the tip of resin blocks using Superglue and cure in the 55\u00b0C oven for 1 hour.\nIn preparation for sectioning, trim the resin block to the shape of an isosceles trapezoid with a razor blade.Using an ultramicrotome and a glass knife, remove the glue and resin at the surface of the tissue. Fill the boat of the glass knife with double distilled water and cut a few semi-thin sections (0.5-1 \u03bcm thick).\nTransfer the sections to a SuperFrost slide with a perfect loop. Dry the sections by placing the slide on a heating plate at 80\u00b0C for 1 minute. Cover with a few drops of 0.1% toluidine blue stain (2 g sodium borate and 0.2 g toluidine blue in 200 mL double distilled water) for 1 minute. Rinse the excess stain with double distilled water. Examination of the sections with a light microscope will enable to distinguish the stained tissue from the resin (Figure 2).\nResume cutting until the border between tissue and resin reaches the middle of the sections. Note that the following procedure requires training. Replace the glass knife with a diamond knife and fill the boat with double distilled water. Cut silver to silver-gold ultrathin sections (60-80 nm thick) and carefully collect them on copper mesh grids using fine inverted tweezers. Dry the grids on a filter paper.\nTo enhance contrast, ultrathin sections can be stained with lead citrate (0.03 g lead citrate and 0.1 mL 10N sodium hydroxide in 10 mL double distilled water1). Using fine inverted tweezers, transfer a grid to a drop of lead citrate for 2 minutes. Remove the grid and delicately rinse in 3 successive baths of double distilled water. Lastly, dry the grids on a filter paper and store them in a grid box until electron microscopic examination (Figures 3-6).\n4.

Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "All the procedures and experiments involving rats were performed according to protocols approved by Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. The SD rat OS cell line UMR-106 cell culture protocol\nGrow cells in DMEM, supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin (10 U/mL)-streptomycin (10 U/mL) at 37 \u00b0C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Perform experiments using cells with passages of 2-812.\n2. Intratibial injection of OS cells protocol\nNOTE: Time-mated pregnant SD rats give birth in the animal facility and at 3 weeks of age, litters are used (since UMR 106 cell line is syngeneic to SD rats, no irradiation is needed).\nInduction\n\t\nPlace the rat in a medium-sized induction chamber and induce anesthesia with 2%-3% isoflurane. Monitor the animal continuously for the depth of anesthesia by reflex to toe pinch, respiratory rate, and character.\nInsert the nose into the nosecone. Secure with tape, if necessary.\nRemove the hair on the right leg up to the ventral and the dorsal lower abdomen with clippers or use depilatory agent. Place the rat in a supine position.\nScrub the surgical area aseptically using 70% ethanol and dilute chlorhexidine acetate or dilute betadine. Begin around the area of the knee and scrub in a circular motion both proximally and distally. Repeat this step three times. No drape is used for tumor implantation.\nApply eye lubricant in both the eyes of the rat to prevent corneal desiccation caused by anesthesia. Place the rat on a low heat setting heating pad. Ensure that the rat has normal body temperature (37 \u00b0C) and normal respiratory rate.\nSurgery\n\t\nTurn on isoflurane at ~1.5%-2% (for maintenance). Ensure that the animal is at an adequate plane of anesthesia via lack of a toe-pinch reflex. If not, increase the isoflurane percentage to 2.5%.Mark a sterile needle (approximately 22 G) at 10 mm from the tip for guidance of depth to insert.\nInsert the needle 10 mm down into the diaphysis of the tibia by entering the bent knee in the middle of the tibial plateau, extending the needle through the metaphysis into the diaphysis using a light drill-like motion to make an opening. Remove the needle.\nLoad the cell suspension into the Hamilton syringe directly before injection into the tibia. To do this, gently mix the cells before drawing into syringe as gravity makes the cells settle in the bottom of the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells can be stored in a 1.5 to 2 mL tube (at room temperature) before drawing into the Hamilton syringe (100 \u00b5L) after careful mixing. Cells can be kept at room temperature for 2-3 h during the implantation procedure. Always check the cell viability of cells in the tube before and then after the implantation session. Trypan blue exclusion is the easiest method for cell viability assessment.\nOnce the bone is traversed with the first needle, insert a second (smaller diameter needle also marked at 10 mm) needle attached to the 100 \u00b5L Hamilton syringe loaded with cells. Ensure to insert the needle up to the 10 mm mark into the same hole extending into the diaphysis.\nGently discharge 20 \u00b5L of 75,000 OS cells suspension in PBS into the diaphysis and marrow cavity.\n\t\tNOTE: The needle should not wobble in the bone and should feel secure. If the needle easily moves, the cortex may have been traversed at the diaphysis. Repeat the insertion again to get a firmer placement before the injection of cells.\nRemove the Hamilton needle from the bone.NOTE: If a small drop of blood forms, apply light pressure. If clear fluid drop forms at the puncture site, the needle may not have been extended far enough in the bone and the tumor cell suspension may have leaked back through the hole. Record this in the notes but generally, tumor implantation will be successful. With experience, the tumor implantation procedure should take 5 min per rat. With experience, the tumor implantation of cells in the bone will become easier. Accidental injection of cells in the muscle around the bone, may not lead to the tumor microenvironment needed for pulmonary metastasis.\nRecovery\n\t\nEnsure that the rat is normothermic. Place the rat in a cage with a heating pad placed under the cage for recovery.\nAfter fully awake, mobile, and breathing well, inject the rats with Buprenorphine (1.0-1.2 mg/kg SC).\n\t\tNOTE: To get access to Buprenorphine, check with the institution to see options for approval through the veterinary staff to place the order.\nMove the rats back to clean cages and monitor once a day, each week.\n3. Measurement and monitoring\nMeasure the tumor size 9-10 days post-implantation and then every 2 days until 3 weeks post-implantation to establish a growth rate. Measure the maximum diameter of the tibia using an electronic or manual caliper. Store the data in a spreadsheet with a formula to calculate tumor volume. Measure the contralateral (not implanted tibia) as the baseline.\n\tNOTE: The implanted hindlimb diameters are used as a surrogate for tumor size. The hind limbs are measured perpendicular to the tibia long axis at the largest diameter for two measurements, ventral/dorsal and media/ lateral on the limb. The estimated tumor volume is calculated by the formula11: Tumor volume (mm3) = largest diameter (mm) x smallest diameter (mm)2/2.Consider the rats for survival amputation or chemotherapy treatment when tumors approach 15 mm in the largest dimension or 3 weeks post tumor implantation. The contralateral limb measures about 7-9 mm in most rats at this age.\n4. Doxorubicin intravenous administration\nAnesthetize the rats with 2% isoflurane. Prepare the skin over jugular vein with three surgical washes using betadine and alcohol as described13.\nUnder careful dissection, visualize the right or left jugular vein. Insert the needle into the overlying muscle and then direct toward the rat's head into the jugular vein lumen as it is visualized in the jugular vein anterior to the pectoralis muscle.\n\t\nWhen the needle is inserted into the jugular vein, gently draw blood into the syringe to ensure proper insertion. It is possible to believe that the needle is through the vein, but the needle is under the vein and not in the lumen. If the jugular vein becomes too small for injections when blunt dissecting to expose the jugular vein, use the other jugular vein for the injection.\nInject doxorubicin (2 mg/kg) slowly over 1 min in a volume of 100-150 \u00b5L. The solution can be visualized intravenously in the jugular vein during delivery.\nInject similar volumes of normal saline in control rats.\nRemove the needle and apply gentle pressure on the vein with a sterile gauze.\nClose the skin incision using 3-4 wound clips. Remove the clips at 7-10 days post injection.\n\tNOTE: Rats do not usually try to remove metal clips but will bite and remove sutures. The jugular injection method is preferable to tail vein injections for doxorubicin since any drug that leaks outside the vessel causes necrosis of tail that may require tail amputation.\n5. Hind limb amputation protocol\nInductionPlace the rat in a medium-sized induction chamber and induce anesthesia with 2%-4% isoflurane. Monitor the rat continuously for the depth of the anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: The induction chamber is scavenged to a charcoal canister and any other gases are removed by a down-draft table used for surgery.\nInsert the nose into a nosecone. Secure with tape, if necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: This procedure is done on a down-draft table to scavenge excess volatile gases (i.e., isoflurane).\nRemove the hair on the right leg up to the ventral and the dorsal lower abdomen with clippers or use depilatory agent. Place the rat in a supine position.\nScrub the surgical area aseptically using 70% ethanol and dilute chlorhexidine acetate or dilute betadine. Prepare the skin for surgery from middle of the calf to skin area just above the hip joint of the right lower abdomen. Scrub the leg proximal and the distal area circumferentially. Repeat this step three times.\nApply the eye lubricant in both the eyes of the rat. Ensure that the rat has normal body temperature (37 \u00b0C) and normal vital signs. Monitor and regulate body temperature using a heating pad that is connected to a rectal temperature probe monitor.\nSurgery\n\t\nTurn on isoflurane at 1.5%-3% (maintenance). Monitor for anesthetic depth, including reaction to toe pinch, respiratory rate, and character. Adjust the rate of isoflurane as needed to maintain an appropriate plane of anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: Respiratory rate while under anesthesia should be between 50-100 breaths per minute. Deep, infrequent breaths are an indication that the rat is too deeply anesthetized.\nOpen sterile instrument packs and drapes and don sterile gloves. Take care to maintain sterility through the duration of the procedure. Basic sterile surgical instruments needed include, scalpel blade holder, forceps, hemostats, needle holder, scissors, and wound clip applier.Pull the leg of the rat through the vent of the sterile surgical drape. Ensure that the animal is at an adequate plane of anesthesia via toe-pinch reflex.\nUsing a scalpel blade or surgical scissors, make a circumferential, cutaneous incision just proximal to the stifle (knee joint).\nDeglove the hind limb using gauze or blunt dissection to expose the femoral artery and vein on the ventral-medial surface of the hind limb.\nLigate the vessels using 4-0 absorbable sutures at the level of the mid-femur and transect distally.\nClamp the vein distally to reduce leakage during muscle dissection.\n\t\tNOTE: Circumferential musculature will be transected distal to the level of femoral artery vessel ligation and muscles elevated from the femur to the level of the coxofemoral joint.\nUsing blunt dissection, abduct the hip joint with lateral outward rotation.\nFind the head of the femur and disarticulate it from the acetabulum. Cut any remaining tissue keeping the leg attached to the body.\nGive a splash block to the acetabulum and sciatic nerve with approximately 6 mg/kg Ropivacaine.\nClose the musculature over the acetabulum using a simple interrupted suture (4-0, absorbable suture).\n\t\tNOTE: Additional 0.5% bupivacaine or lidocaine (0.15-0.2 mg total) may be injected in several sites along the closed muscle layer (local infiltration/splash block).\nOppose and close the edges of the skin using wound clips placed apart every 5-10 mm.\nRecovery\n\t\nPlace the rat in a clean recovery cage with heat support using a heating pad placed under the cage.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent hyperthermia, the heating pad should not be in direct contact with the animal and should not exceed 40 \u00b0C.\nMonitor the animal until it fully recovers and is normothermic (37.5-39 \u00b0C).NOTE: The animal should not be left unattended until fully conscious and sternally recumbent and moving easily around the cage.\nAfter fully awake, mobile, and breathing well, inject the rats with Buprenorphine (1.0-1.2 mg/kg SC).\n\t\tNOTE: Giving Buprenorphine in an anesthetized rat may impair recovery.\nAdminister 10 mL of warm lactated Ringer's solution subcutaneously between the shoulder blades.\nMove the rats back to the clean cage and reunite with conspecifics.\nMonitor all the animals twice daily for the next month for signs of pain and distress, including piloerection, hunched posture, or inappetence or signs of incision site infection, including erythema, purulent discharge, or wound dehiscence.\n\t\tNOTE: To date we have not observed clinical signs (such as infections) following post-operative recovery in any of the animals. Only one rat had a dehiscence with sutures, after which wound clips were used to close wounds with no further problems.\nAdminister buprenorphine or meloxicam to animals presenting clinical signs of pain at published doses in consultation with a laboratory animal veterinarian.\nAdminister antibiotics (i.e., cephalosporin) to animals presenting clinical signs of pain at published doses in consultation with a laboratory animal veterinarian.\n\t\tNOTE: Any animals exhibiting protracted signs of pain or distress that do not improve with analgesics or animals exhibiting signs of infection that do not respond to antibiotics need to be humanely euthanized.\n6. Imaging with X-ray\nAfter tumor implantation, image the tibias and lungs non-invasively to detect tumor growth using X-ray with a machine designed for rodents.\nAnesthetize the rats as previously done.\nTake images at 3x magnification for 6 s at 25 kV.\nProcess the film using the X-ray processor. Radiographs can be digitally scanned as well.\n7. Necropsy procedureEuthanize the rats with CO2. Confirm death via lack of heartbeat and immediately draw 3 mL blood from the heart for serum or plasma samples.\nOpen the thorax and abdomen for examination.\nIsolate the trachea and cannulate with a (18 G) catheter. To secure the catheter in the trachea, tie a silk suture around both the trachea with the catheter.\nConnect the infusion catheter to a 3 or 5 mL syringe. Infuse formalin or saline to gently inflate the lung lobes for better histology specimens. On infusion, the lungs will puff up and enable a better visualization of pulmonary metastases.\nExamine, dissect, and weigh all the selected thoracic and abdominal organs (such as liver, kidneys).\nFix the organs in formalin for histopathology or freeze on dry ice, 2-methylbutane, or liquid nitrogen.\nFor evaluation of protein expression using western blot, make lysates of frozen tissues.

Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "General Considerations:  All cell culture, media preparation, tissue culture vessels, and other laboratory work is to be conducted inside a Class 2 microbiological hood, using aseptic technique.The hood should be cleaned thoroughly before use with 3% of Distel (or equivalent disinfectant) and 70% ethanol.Prepare all media, solutions, and reagents at room temperature (RT). See the Recipes section for more detailed information on media preparation.Human induced Pluripotent Stem cell culture and expansionPrepare all cell maintenance base media and reagents, as described in the Materials and Reagents or Recipes sections.Prepare vitronectin plates. Vitronectin is a glycoprotein used to coat the surface of cell culture plates, to facilitate hiPSC attachment and spreading. Thaw one 60 \u03bcL aliquot to RT and dilute into 6 mL DPBS without Ca2+/Mg2+. If using a 6-well plate, add 1\u20131.5 mL per well; alternatively, add 6 mL to one 10 cm dish. Ensure the vitronectin covers the entire surface, and incubate in a hood for 1\u20132 h at RT. Vitronectin plates can be sealed with ParafilmTM and stored at 4\u00b0C for 5 days. Allow to warm to RT for 1\u20132 h prior to use.Prepare the E8 basal medium by adding the thawed supplement and allowing the media to warm to RT. We recommend that thawed hiPSCs are cultured and expanded in E8 basal media, and that a master stock of hiPSC lines is frozen and stored early on.Set up a 15 mL Falcon with 9 mL of E8 media plus 0.312 \u00b5M ROCKi for one frozen vial of 1 mL of hiPSC, i.e., 1 \u00b5L of ROCKi into a final volume to 10 mL. Although ROCKi allows attachment and recovery of hiPSC, whilst preventing apoptosis & spontaneous differentiation, it must be removed from the media after 24 h, to prevent interference with colony expansion.Partially thaw the frozen hiPSCs quickly until just defrosted, with some ice remaining in the vial, using the water bath at 37\u00b0C (thawing should be quick, to avoid prolonged contact with DMSO; however, do not warm the entire vial to 37\u00b0C). Add 1 mL of E8 in a drop-wise fashion to the vial and gently transfer the cells to the 15 mL Falcon, using a wide-bore pipette tip or stripette. Invert the tube to mix and dilute out the DMSO.Note: The exact cell number or density in a cryovial is usually not known nor determined at the time of freezing, to avoid creating a single cell suspension, and to improve recovery after thawing for subsequent culture. Between 6\u201310 cryovials are generated from one previously 70\u201380% confluent 10 cm plate of hiPSCs. Spin at 290 \u00d7 g and 20\u00b0C for 3 min. Discard the supernatant.Aspirate the diluted vitronectin from the plate surface. One thawed cryovial should give a small 5\u201320 \u00b5L cell pellet in a 15 mL Falcon after centrifugation. Resuspend the pellet gently in the desired volume of E8 medium supplemented with 3.12 \u00b5M ROCKi (1 \u00b5L: 1,000 \u00b5L), avoiding excessive pipetting.Note: ROCKi has been previously used in earlier adapted protocols at 10 \u00b5M, but we have titrated this down further, and have seen effective hiPSC attachment and recovery at a lower concentration of 3.12 \u00b5M. Plate 2 mL of cell suspension per well of a 6-well plate or 8 mL per 10 cm dish; aim to use minimum volumes of media to enhance adherence.One frozen vial of hiPSC (equivalent to 1 well of a 6-well plate, or one-tenth of a 10 cm dish at 70\u201380% confluence), can be split into 2\u20133 wells of a 6-well plate or if the hiPSC line demonstrates good recovery, then cells can be seeded less densely straight into a 10 cm dish. Recovery is described as good when multiple small colonies have attached to the vitronectin plate 24 h after seeding (see Figure 1), and colony expansion occurs in the following days (see Figure 2).Place the plate into a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. Ensure the plate is initially gently agitated to distribute the colonies evenly over the vitronectin.Check for attachment under a phase-contrast microscope after 24 h (see Figure 1).Change the medium every 24 h, remove the unattached colonies, dead cells, and spent media with a stripette or aspirator. If there are a lot of dead cells or debris, then wash the plate with DBPS before replacing the E8 media. Replace with fresh E8 basal media gently, using a stripette against the side wall of the vessel (ROCKi supplementation is not required after the first 24 h). hiPSCs are difficult to maintain in culture and are prone to differentiation, media cytokines, and factors that maintain pluripotency, necessitating daily media change.Continue to change media daily until the cells reach 70\u201380% confluency and ready for passaging. Do not allow the clusters/colonies to fuse together (see Figures 3, 4, and 5), which helps to avoid spontaneous differentiation. Once thawed hiPSCs are established, subsequent steps, culture systems, and further differentiation should take place after 1\u20132 passages.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4361/bioprotoc-12-06-4361-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Images obtained with a Olympus CKX41 Inverted Microscope, equipped with a 20\u00d7 objective. Passaging and freezing of hiPSCPrepare vitronectin plates as before.Remove the exhausted media from the plate with hiPSC at 70\u201380% confluency and wash the plate/wells twice with DPBS without Ca2+/Mg2+ (approximately 6 mL for 10 cm dish).Remove the DPBS and add 6 mL of 0.5 mM PBS-EDTA solution, allowing full coverage of the plate surface.Observe the cells under a phase-contrast microscope every 2 min for up to 4 min, to monitor cell morphology changes and detachment (bright halos and edge enhancement to the colonies) but do not to allow full detachment and separation of cells into single cells.Gently remove and discard the PBS-EDTA with a stripette by tilting the plate, but do not to dislodge the colonies.Using a stripette add 8 mL of E8 media to the 10 cm plate aiming to detach and wash the colonies in small clumps and clusters into suspension, by repeated aspiration and flushing of the media through the stripette up to four times with the same 8 mL volume. Collect the media and cells into a new 50 mL Falcon. Repeat this step up to twice more to maximise colony recovery, while avoiding excessive agitation and pipetting, which will result in single cells.Spin cells at 290 \u00d7 g and 20\u00b0C for 3 min. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the colonies in fresh E8 base media supplemented with 3.12 mM ROCKi at the desired splitting ratio (1:5\u20131:30, depending on the growth rate of the hiPSC line).Aspirate the vitronectin solution from pre-prepared plates. Transfer and seed the split colonies into a new vitronectin plate/well.Cryopreservation/freezing of hiPSC:To freeze hiPSC cells, freshly prepare freezing medium (10% DMSO in KSR) at RT. After harvesting the hiPSCs (Steps B2\u2013B7), resuspend the cell pellet in 10% DMSO-KSR and transfer 1 mL of cell suspension per cryovial. It is important that the cells spend minimal time in presence of DMSO at RT. Cryovials should be placed immediately into a Mr. Frosty or appropriate freezing container and into the -80\u00b0C freezer and then into liquid nitrogen after 24 h, for long term storage.Note: The volume of freezing medium to prepare will depend on the number of cryovials to be stored. We advise 1 mL of freezing media per cryovial and 2 cryovials per well of a 6-well plate and 6\u201310 mL or 6\u201310 cryovials per 10 cm dish at 70\u201380% confluency. Embryoid Body formation utilizing a feeder-free systemAfter harvesting the hiPSC (as described in Steps B2\u2013B7), add 1 mL of fresh E8 media and pipette the hiPSCs up and down more than usual (3\u20134 pipetting strokes), to break up clumps and create a single-cell suspension.Using a haemocytometer, count the cells in 10 \u00b5L of cell suspension, after adding 10 \u00b5L of Trypan blue (dilution factor = 2), and determine cell density:(Number of cells in 3 squares / 3) \u00d7 dilution factor \u00d7 10,000 = Number of cells/mLMake individual, homogenous, and equally-sized EBs using an ultra-low adherent U bottom 96-well plate (1\u00d7 EB per well).With the knowledge of the total cell number harvested above, both the desired EB size (cell number) and the overall total number of the individual EBs to be made, can be calculated. For example, if 3 \u00d7 106 hiPSCs are harvested = 100\u00d7 individual EBs of 3 \u00d7 104 size can be made. Note: The size of EB may need to be determined for each hiPSC line. However, in our hands, EB sizes of between 1 \u00d7 104\u20135 \u00d7 104 cells generate the highest yields of myeloid precursors for both the hiPSC lines used in the generation of this protocol (EBs up to 1 \u00d7 105 cells can also work well).  Each individual EB is made up in 100 \u00b5L of E8 media supplemented with 50 ng/mL recombinant BMP-4 and 3.12 \u00b5M ROCKi. Depending on the desired EB size, create a cell suspension of 1 \u00d7 105\u201310 \u00d7 105 cells per mL.For the example calculated above, a cell suspension of 3 \u00d7 105 cell/mL should be created to generate individual EBs of 3 \u00d7 104 size in 100 \u00b5L of supplemented E8 per well of ultra-low adherent U bottom 96 well plate.Transfer 100 \u00b5L of hiPSC cell suspension into each well of an ultra-low adherent U bottom 96-well plate.Spin the plate at 800 rpm for 1 min and transfer to a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2.Leave these EBs undisturbed for 48 h and, on day 2 of culture, remove 50 \u00b5L of spent media and carefully replace with 50 \u00b5L of E8 media supplemented with 50 ng/mL BMP-4 only, aiming to not disturb the forming EB. Repeat for day 3 (see Figure 6). ROCKi can interfere with late EB and germ layer formation.It is unusual to find more than one EB per well (see Figures 7 and 8); however, providing the appearance of each EB within one well is similar to that seen in Figure 6, with a clear rim and 3D structure, then all EBs within the well can be transferred. Whenever multiple small clumps or a broken and shattered EB appearance is found, the well and cellular material should be discarded.On day 4, prepare gelatin-coated 10 cm dishes. Add 6 mL of 0.1% gelatine solution to a 10 cm dish and incubate in a hood for 1\u20132 h, allowing the gelatin to coat the entire surface and warm to RT (plates can be pre-prepared and stored at 4\u00b0C for 5 days).Remove the gelatin solution from the plate prior to EB transfer.Using wide bore P1000 filter tips (alternatively, P1000 filter tips can be cut higher up their length with a scalpel, to create a wide bore orifice), carefully aspirate the individual EBs which are easily visible, and transfer them to the gelatin-coated plate (Figure 9). The number of EBs per cm2 may need to be determined per hiPSC line, nevertheless, in our experience, up to 35\u00d7 EBs per 10 cm dish provides a high yield of myeloid precursors.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4361/bioprotoc-12-06-4361-g006.jpgFigure 6. Embryoid Bodies should have this appearance after 24 h in culture. This is an EB in one well of a 96-well ultra-low adherent plate, on day 4 prior to transfer into a gelatin plate.

Once transferred, gently tilt the plate and remove the spent EB media from the plate, without removing EBs.Slowly add 10\u201312 mL of fresh EB-Myeloid precursor media supplemented with 50 ng/mL M-CSF, which is critical for myeloid differentiation, and 25 ng/mL IL-3, which is critical for hematopoietic specification and proliferation.Carefully move these plates to a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. And leave undisturbed for 1 week, to allow EBs to attach to the gelatin (see Figure 10).At day 7, carefully remove spent EB media with a large bore stripette to avoid damaging any unattached EBs. Take care not to dislodge any attached EBs and pass the media through a 70\u2013100 \u00b5m strainer over a 50 mL Falcon tube, to catch and retain all the unattached EBs that are in suspension.Return the EBs in the strainer back into the original plate, by inverting the strainer over the 10 cm dish and gently adding fresh EB media supplemented with 50 ng/mL M-CSF and 25 ng/mL IL-3 warmed to RT over the inverted strainer. Continue to take care not to dislodge the attached EBs in the plate.Once the EB media has been exchanged, and EBs returned to their dish, spin the 50 mL Falcon at 290 \u00d7 g and 20\u00b0C for 3 min. At week 3, this tube will contain the harvested myeloid precursors in suspension. Discard supernatant.Add 1 mL of macrophage differentiation media to the cell pellet and observe the appearance of the cells under a microscope, counting them with a haemocytometer (see Step C1).EB media should continue to be exchanged as described in Steps C14\u2013C17 each week. Depending on the hiPSC line, myeloid precursors should be harvested from weeks 3\u20134 of EB culture.EBs can be maintained in culture for several months. In our hands, myeloid precursor yields begin to fall from 12\u201316 weeks.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4361/bioprotoc-12-06-4361-g010.jpgFigure 10. Embryoid Body attachment: 1 week post transfer onto the gelatin plate. Images taken using EVOSTM XL Core imaging system, with a 4\u00d7 objective.Macrophage differentiationHarvest the myeloid precursors as described in Step C14\u2013C17. Following counting, resuspend the harvested myeloid precursors in the desired volume of macrophage differentiation media supplemented with high concentration 100 ng/mL M-CSF.Seed the cells into the desired culture plates, ideally 0.5 \u00d7 106\u20131 \u00d7 106 in approximately 8\u201310 mL of macrophage differentiation media per 10 cm dish, or alternatively 1.5 \u00d7 105 in 3 mL per well of a 6-well plate, or 1.5 \u00d7 104 in 150 \u00b5L per well on a 96-well plate (see Figure 11a).Transfer the cells to a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and leave undisturbed for 5\u20137 days (see Figure 11b).Cells can then be lifted with 0.5 mM EDTA solution, with or without the help of a cell scraper. The 0.5 mM EDTA solution should be left covering the cells for 10 min. Cells should be recounted and phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry or qPCR, or functionally thereafter (see Figures 12 and 13).Note: The number of macrophages should be similar to the number of myeloid precursors seeded onto the plate, but this number can vary between cell lines and also be dependent on EB size. Cells left in culture for 10\u201314 days post harvest tend to become fibroblast-like (Figure 11c).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220312/20220312164521_2949.jpgFigures 11.

As a landmark, the cut is made at -2 mm Bregma coordinates in the anterior-posterior axis according to the mouse brain atlas11 (Figure 1A, dotted line and Figure 1C).\nWith a Dumont forceps, hold one of the slices, and with fine-point Dumont forceps make a horizontal cut between DG and CA1 and then perform a vertical incision between the DG and CA3 to separate the DG (Figure 2B).\nRepeat the dissection in the first slice of the other hemisphere.\nRepeat the dissection in both hemispheres in the second slice.\nCollect the four DG pieces of each vole in a centrifuge tube. Do not pool the DG tissue of more than two animals.\n\t\tNOTE: If dissection of more than one animal is required, store the centrifuge tubes with the VZ or DG tissue on ice while continuing to dissect the rest of the brains. Remove all blood vessels that cover the brain tissue while dissecting. If the vessels are not discarded, the culture could be mixed with an excess of erythrocytes and disturb neurosphere formation.\n5. Isolation of neural cells\nPlace the centrifuge tubes inside the biosafety cabinet and wait about 10 min for the tissue fragments to precipitate by gravity.\nRemove the wash solution and add 1 mL of the warm enzymatic solution to each tube.\nIncubate the tubes at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min.\nDisintegrate the tissue fragments; pipette up and down with a 1 mL tip.

Neurospheres formation\nCulture the cells passed through the strainer into an ultra-low attachment, 24-well plate. Use two wells for the VZ and one well for the DG (1 mL of B27 medium/well).\nAdd 20 ng/mL of FGF2 and 20 ng/mL of EGF to each well (final concentration 1x).\nIncubate at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 and high humidity (90-95%). Do not disturb for 48 h (day 1 and day 2 of culture, D1-D2).\nOn the third day (D3), remove half of the culture medium and replace it with fresh B27 medium (500 \u00b5L per well) supplemented with double concentration (2x) of growth factors.\nRepeat every third day, change the culture medium (half of it) and replace it with a fresh B27 medium supplemented with double concentration (2x) of growth factors.\nOn days when it is not necessary to change the culture medium, add growth factors to a final concentration of 1x.\nEnsure that the neurospheres are formed around D8-D10.\nAt the D10, change the complete culture medium to remove all debris.Collect the medium and neurospheres individually of each well in centrifuge tubes.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature.

Passage of the neurospheres\nAt D15 of the primary culture, collect the neurospheres into centrifuge tubes using 1 mL pipette. Cut the pipette tip to increase the size of the opening to avoid damage to the neurospheres.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature. Neurospheres precipitate by gravity.\nRemove the medium and add 1 mL of the cell detachment medium per tube.\nIncubate the tubes for 7 min at 37 \u00b0C.\nPipette up and down with a 1 mL tip to dismantle the neurospheres.\nDilute the cell detachment medium with 3 mL of B27 medium per tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 200 x g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet with a fresh B27 medium supplemented with growth factors.\n\t\nResuspend the VZ-derived cells in 4 mL of medium and the DG-derived cells in 2 mL of medium.\nCulture the cells (passage 1) in a new ultra-low attachment plate by doubling the number of wells that were used in the primary culture (4 and 2 wells for VZ and DG, respectively).\nChange half of the medium every third day and add growth factors daily.\nAfter 10 days (D10) in passage 1, change to adherent conditions in the next passage.\n8. The passage in adherent conditions\nBefore carrying out the passage 2, prepare coated plates with poly-L-ornithine and laminin.In 24-well plates, add 500 \u00b5L of 1x poly-L-ornithine (20 \u00b5g/mL) per well.

We recommend using young wandering third instar larvae. Brain lobes contain a defined number of NSCs (\u2248100). These 100 cells are spatially much closer to each other in younger brains compared to older brain that have generated much more GMCs. Therefore, young wandering third instar larvae offer a better chance to isolate NSCs and greatly facilitate the subsequent imaging steps.\nLarval brain dissection and mounting on the incubation chamber\nTiming: 20\u00a0min\nNote: Culture medium must be pre-heated to 25\u00b0C prior to dissection and centrifuged at\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 1\u00a0min to remove debris.\nLarval brain dissection.\nWash the larvae 3 times in PBS and transfer the larvae in 200\u00a0\u03bcL of culture media.\nRemove the brain and surrounding tissues under a binocular using fine tweezers.\nSeparate the brain from the salivary glands and surrounding tissues.\nBrain mounting in the incubation chamber.\nGently aspirate the brain with a 200 Eppendorf pipet tip containing 50\u00a0\u03bcL of culture media and transfer the brain in the central well of the incubation chamber (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nImmediately cover the brain with 200\u00a0\u03bcL of mineral oil in the incubation chamber.\nRemove excess culture medium by aspiration with a fine homemade glass capillary through the mineral oil layer (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: Cut the end of the pipette tip off with a razor blade to avoid brain deformation during pipetting as the brain size may exceed the tip diameter.Note: Excess removal of culture media can trigger too much brain flattening on the coverslip and impair cell division. Aspiration is controlled under the binocular and should be stopped as soon as the brain lobes start to flatten.\nNote: Medium aspiration has the advantage of gently flattening the lobes and maintaining many NSCs in a close focal plane.\nCentrosome photo-ablation\nNCS Imaging and centrosome photo-ablation.\nImage larval brain explants under an inverted Leica SP5 confocal microscope maintained at 25\u00b0C.\nPerform photo-ablation with a Mai-Tai two-photon infrared laser on a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u03bcm region of interest\u00a0at the centrosome in metaphase cells.\nNote: Use the following parameters for the multi-photon ablation; Trans: 80%, Gain: 100, offset: 36, iterations: 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0ms.\nNote: NSCs can be distinguished as being the largest spherical cells, with a diameter of 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm. They are positioned in the central part of the brain and located below the brain surface. We found that a plasma membrane marker such as PH-PLC-GFP is the best marker to accurately identify NSCs for non-experts.\nNote: Centrosomes are identified by the presence of GFP-AurA dots located in the center of the RFP-\u03b1-tubulin microtubule aster during pro-metaphase and metaphase (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Apical and basal NSC centrosomes can be differentiated by their respective size; the apical centrosome recruits more peri-centriolar components (e.g., GFP-AurA) and appears larger and brighter than the basal centrosome (Rebollo et\u00a0al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Rusan and Peifer, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). In addition, the location of the GMCs that originate from previous NSC divisions (visible with the PH-PLC\u03b4-GFP marker) enables to determine the position of the NSC basal side.\nCritical: To avoid tissue damage and photo bleaching, a maximum of 4 photo-ablation experiments are performed on different neuroblasts from the same brain.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1755-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02.

The NCS and the GMC outskirts are visualized using the plasma membrane PH-PLC\u03b4-GFP marker. The diameters of the newborn NSC and the GMC after cytokinesis are measured using the \u201cline\u201d tool on Fiji. The mean of at least two diameter measurements is performed for each cell.

For useful information on establishing and running a patch-clamp setup and two-photon imaging system see Refs [7-12].\n1. Animal and tissue preparation\nKeep mouse dark-adapted for at least 3 h. In the meantime, prepare 1-2 l of extracellular solution consisting of (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1.6 MgCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 10 D-glucose and equilibrate it to pH 7.4 by gassing with carbogen (5 % CO2 in O2) at room temperature.\nEuthanize the mouse in an air-tight chamber by CO2 overdose followed by cervical dislocation. This procedure and the following steps should be performed in darkness. Use dim long-wavelength illumination (we block short wavelengths from a cold light source by a 690 nm-longpass filter) to support personal vision while keeping the animal's eyes dark-adapted (mice only have poor vision in the red part of the light spectrum). For work in complete darkness use infrared illumination (>800 nm) and wear night-vision goggles.\nEnucleate eyes with a pair of curved iris scissors and transfer them to a dish of extracellular solution placed under a dissecting microscope.Remove the cornea and ciliary body by opening the eye bulb along the ora serrata (the border between retina and ciliary body) with a pair of spring scissors (we first use a lancet to pierce a starting point for the cutting). Take out the lens and carefully separate the retina from the pigment epithelium. If the orientation of the retina is crucial to your study, indicate it like in Ref [12]. Cut the optical nerve between retina and pigment epithelium and remove the retina from the eyecup. Note the direction of the retinal surfaces: the inside of the curled-up retina is the ganglion cell side; the outside is the photoreceptor side.\nRemove the vitreous from the inner retinal surface by gently pulling it off with the aid of a wooden toothpick. For this purpose, use a small volume of extracellular solution that just covers the retina. The vitreous sticks to the toothpick and can be dragged centrifugally off the retina. Then, apply short incisions along the retinal perimeter to facilitate flattening of the tissue.\nTransfer the retina into the recording chamber photoreceptor-side down, spread it out on the glass bottom (we use a fine brush) and immobilize it with a nylon-strung frame of stainless steel. Prepare the second retina in the same way and keep it dark-adapted in carboxygenated extracellular solution for later use.\n2. RecordingsInstall the recording chamber in darkness under an upright laser scanning microscope and superfuse the retinal preparation continuously (not less than 5 ml/min) with carboxygenated extracellular solution heated to 35 \u00b0C. The microscope (also equipped with an infrared-sensitive CCD camera) is situated on a shock-absorbing air table inside a Faraday cage for electronic shielding. Cover the cage with a non-transparent curtain to keep the preparation in darkness. We also screen off light from computer monitors by red transparent film.\nTune the infrared laser to 850-870 nm or longer wavelengths, switch to mode-locked condition, and use two-photon excitation to visualize GFP-expressing cells. Attenuate the laser output using neutral density filters controlled by the laser scanning software down to a degree that is just sufficient for clear recognition of the fluorescent cell\nFor patch-clamp recordings in current-clamp mode use glass micropipettes (we use borosilicate glass tubing of 1.5 mm outer diameter and 0.225 mm wall thickness) filled with intracellular solution consisting of (in mM) 125 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with KOH (giving a pipette resistance of about 5 M\u03a9). Note that other experimental conditions like voltage-clamp recording require a different solution. If dye injections are desired, add a fluorescent probe (we use 10 mM Alexa Fluor 594) or a tracer molecule (3 % Neurobiotin). Insert the micropipette into the holder and make sure that the reference electrode (chlorinated silver wire) is in contact with the extracellular solution in the recording chamber.Apply pressure to the micropipette and target a GFP-expressing cell (we use a 40-fold water immersion objective; NA 1.25). Amacrine cell bodies are situated in the ganglion cell layer (directly beneath the surface in the current orientation of the retina) as well as in the proximal part of the inner nuclear layer (about 55-75 \u03bcm deep within the preparation). Before micropipette contact with the targeted cell, the inner limiting membrane (a sheath made of glial endfeet) at the retinal surface has to be penetrated. Successful penetration is recognized by intracellular solution that is driven out from the micropipette tip and detaches the inner limiting membrane from the underlying retinal tissue as can be observed on an infrared transmission image captured by the IR-CCD camera.\nApproach the desired cell by comparing the soma position from the two-photon image with the picture of the IR-CCD camera showing the position of the recording micropipette. Note that this step is not easily achieved and requires some practice, because the GFP-expressing cell has to be recognized in the infrared transmission image in order to direct the micropipette towards it. Correct targeting is achieved when the micropipette tip causes dimpling of the cell surface that can be seen in the two-photon image. Alternative to this procedure, use a fluorescent dye (e.g. Alexa Fluor 594, 100 \u03bcM) in the intracellular solution to reveal the micropipette position in the two-photon image. Two-photon infrared excitation allows for sufficient fluorescence of this dye to make the micropipette discernible. For this purpose, adjust the detection range in the laser scanning software to cover also red fluorescence.\nRelease pressure from the micropipette and obtain a whole-cell patch-clamp configuration in current-clamp mode. A usable recording should give a membrane potential of -50 to -55 mV and last for at least 20 min.Present visual stimuli created by a stimulation software (we use QDS by Thomas Euler, University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany)11 on a computer monitor. Adjust the spatial position of the stimulation to be centered on the recorded cell: Mark the cell position on the monitor showing the transmission image of the IR-CCD camera and center a spot-like stimulus onto it. Tune the stimulus intensity by inserting neutral density filters into the beam path. For calibration of monitor spectrum and intensity see Ref [14]. Choose a prolonged interstimulus interval (e.g. 15 s) to avoid adaptation. Include a photodiode within the beam path to keep record of the stimulus timing.\nStart the stimulation protocol and record the light responses (we use a sampling rate of 10 kHz with filtering at 5 kHz for non-spiking cells; for spike recording a higher sampling rate like 20 kHz is recommended). Use the light stimulation software to trigger the recording software.\nFor dye filling let the fluorescent agent diffuse into the recorded cell for 30-45 min before carefully retracting the micropipette from the cell. Take care not to pull out the cell body. If the non-fluorescent tracer Neurobiotin was used, it needs visualization by binding to streptavidin conjugated to a fluorophore (we use streptavidin-Cy3, 1:400 over night at 4 \u00b0C after 20 min paraformaldehyde fixation of the retina; for dye-coupling studies streptavidin incubation can be prolonged to 3 d). Alternatively, injections can also be performed with sharp electrodes (>100 M\u03a9) when the dye is driven iontophoretically into the impaled cell (rectangular pulses: 0.25-1 nA, 100 ms, interval 100 ms, total time 3-6 min).\n3. Representative Results:The following results originate from a study on a mouse expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the promoter for tyrosine hydroxylase13,14, the enzyme catalyzing the rate limiting step in catecholamine synthesis (TH::GFP mouse). Based on the brightness of the GFP-signal two distinct cell populations are distinguishable (Figure 2A). Cells expressing the higher GFP level possess cell bodies located in the inner nuclear layer (INL, Figure 2A) or displaced in the ganglion cell layer (GCL, Figure 2B) and stratify in the middle of the inner plexiform layer (IPL, Figure 2C). They were identified as type 2 cells14-16 and could systematically be studied with respect to morphology (Figure 3) and electrical activity (Figure 4) even though its population density only amounts to 250 cells/mm2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3457/3457fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the experimental setup. Two-photon excitation (red dotted light path) of fluorophore-expressing cells in the intact retina enables visual targeting by a micropipette (green emission light path).

Here, we describe the harvesting of transplanted and native hearts and livers from mice. Harvesting of tissues is ideally performed under terminal anesthesia to reduce the risk of thrombosis, though may be done immediately after euthanasia. The transplanted heart is located in the abdomen, thus harvesting of the transplant and native hearts require separate procedures. The transplanted liver replaces the native liver, thus the procedure for harvesting either a transplanted or native liver is the same.\nInduce anesthesia and place the mouse in a supine position with continuous anesthetic delivery. Secure the limbs with tape to provide access to the abdomen.\nSterilize the abdomen with 70% ethanol.\nOpen the mouse:\nWith forceps, lift the skin at the pelvis and make an incision with scissors.\nContinue the incision to the sternum, exposing the peritoneal cavity membrane.\nCarefully cut open the peritoneum from the pelvis to the sternum.\nFurther open the abdomen by incising along the flanks.\nMove the abdominal organs aside with cotton tip applicators to expose the transplanted organ.\nProceed with step 5 for liver transplant mice, and steps 6 and 7 for heart transplant mice.\nPerfuse and collect the transplanted liver (Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]):\nLocate and incompletely sever the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the top of the liver (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPerfuse the liver with 10\u00a0mL cold saline by inserting a 23\u00a0G needle attached to a 10\u00a0mL syringe into the IVC.

For detailed information for each of the recommended resources please refer to the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nCompensation Controls\nUltraComp eBeads compensation beads are recommended to achieve reliable and robust positive and negative populations for the fluorochromes listed in each suggested antibody panel.\nFlow cytometer setup and quality controlBD Cytometer Setup and Tracking (CST) Beads consist of bright, mid and dim beads dyed with a mixture of fluorochromes. Using CST beads, the BD acquisition software measures changes in median fluorescence intensity and robust CV for each bead intensity in all fluorescence detectors and reports on changes from baseline. It is recommended to run CST each time the cytometer is switched on to confirm consistency of data being acquired.\nUltra Rainbow Calibration Particle (URCP) Kits\nSimilar to CST beads, URCP allow for rapid routine calibration and long-term performance tracking of flow cytometers.

Dissection   Euthanize the mice, preferably by cervical dislocation.  Notes:    All procedures were performed in accordance with the Italian laws and policies (D.L. no 26 14th March 2014), with the guidelines established by the European Community Council Directive no 2010/63/UE and approved by the veterinary services of the University of Padova (O.P.B.A.-Organismo Preposto al Benessere degli Animali) (protocol 359/2015). All the procedures should be utilized according to the ethical standards of the Institution where experiments are carried out.   Exsanguination with decapitation can be carried out to avoid the presence of bleeding and clot formations within the rib cage.     Pin the mouse on a support in a supine position, remove the skin over the chest and the abdomen, and open the peritoneum under the rib cage.   Remove pectoral muscles to expose the rib cage.   Hold firmly the lower extremity of the sternum with a clamp, and make a central cut on it, approximately at the level of the second rib; keep on cutting the right and left side of the rib cage to get the diaphragm exposed (see Figure 2A).Note: While cutting, do not follow the course of the ribs, but chop them.   Completely remove the superior part of the rib cage (see Figure 2B).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228024957_1575.jpg Figure 2. Rib cage opening for diaphragm explantation    Gently, move away the heart and the pulmonary lobes to spot the left phrenic nerve (it forms a white arch, see Figure 3A). Using forceps, insert the cotton thread under the nerve, in the upper part and make two knots. Carefully, cut the nerve behind the knots; holding the thread (avoid excessive stretching which may cause nerve damage), isolate the nerve removing adherent tissue as much as possibile; it is advisable to start from the knots and gently proceed toward the diaphragm muscle. A cleared nerve is easier to mount and stimolate, yet this requires carefull handling to avoid nerve stretching or damage, particularly close to the nerve insertion point into the muscle. Gently depose the isolated nerve on the muscle (see Figures 3B and 3C). Repeat these operations for the right phrenic nerve. Be careful: the right nerve is very close to blood vessels whose damage may lead to annoying hemorrhages (see Figures 3D and 3E). The result of these steps is shown in Figure 3F.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228025026_3844.jpg Figure 3.

Red dotted line: blood vessel running along the right phrenic nerve. Yellow dotted line in A: whole diaphragmatic muscle area.    Hold the diaphragm using the lower part of the sternum, to avoid damage of muscle fibers; remove the connective tissue adhering the abdominal side of the diaphragm (arrow in Figure 4A). Explant the diaphragm by cutting the dorsal part of the muscle (arrow in Figure 4B).Note: Pay close attention to spot nerve insertion point and avoid their cleavage.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228025055_7010.jpg Figure 4. Diaphragm explantation    Transfer the preparation into a Petri dish (10 cm diameter), bottomed with sylgard and filled with 5-10 ml of complete Ringer\u2019s solution; pin the muscle as shown in Figure 5A.   Split the whole muscle into two hemidiaphragms, each innervated by its own phrenic nerve, by cutting along the dotted lines shown in Figure 5A and discarding the central wedge with the sternum attachment. The result of this processing is two triangles, one of which is shown in Figure 5B. Note: With the present dissection procedure, two hemidiaphragms are obtained allowing two parallel but independent analyses, which is a remarkable advantage.   Tie a cotton thread at the apex of the triangle to connect the preparation to the transducer, making double knots without drilling the tissue. Use the ribs at the base of the triangle to secure the preparation to the support: drill the tissue between the ribs, pass a cotton thread and make a double knot around the lower rib (Figure 5B). Position the support and tie the base of the triangle via a double knot around the holder (Figure 5C).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228025136_4180.jpg Figure 5. Hemidiaphragms separation and mounting on the tissue holder      Nerve stimulation and acquisition   Very carefully, transfer the preparation into the stimulation chamber (filled with 4 ml of complete Ringer\u2019s solution, at 37 \u00b0C). Set O2 pressure to have a continuous but gentle bubbling of gas. Fix the thread knotted at the triangle apex to the transducer sensor with a double knot (Figure 6A).Notes:   For a complete force transduction, the muscle must be perpendicular to the axis of the transducer sensor (thread vertical as much as possible); thread contact with other parts of the setup may alter the measurement and must be avoided (Figure 6B). Muscle twitching is recorded by an isometric transducer that translates the mechanical force in electrical signal and commutated into a digital signal displayed by the Labscribe software.   A calibration curve can be built by applying weights of known value to the transducer and recording the corresponding Volt values; this procedure allows to express the force of muscle contraction in Newton (or in grams). The unit of measurement is irrelevant when results are provided as normalized values (see below).     Stretch the muscles, using the lead screw positioner (Figure 6A), until its tension reaches about 0.2 V (resting tension).   Pass the cotton wire connected to the phrenic nerve through the two platinum rings of the stimulating electrode (arrow in Figure 6C). Using the micromanipulator, carefully move the electrode inside the stimulation chamber. Pull the cotton thread until the phrenic nerve gets in contact with the rings (Figure 6C). Note: The nerve must be completely immersed into the solution and ideally perpendicular to the muscle, avoiding excessive tension. The electrode must not be in contact with the muscle, to prevent direct stimulation of muscle fibers.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180228/20180228025312_8607.jpg Figure 6. Details of the experimental setup. A. Transducer sensor with the cotton thread knotted. The asterisk indicates the screw positioner. B. Connection between the cotton thread (parallel to the white dotted line) and the hemidiaphragm. C. Final positioning of the phrenic nerve in the chamber. Black arrow: electrode rings with the nerve passing through and contacting it.    Set the standard parameters for phrenic nerve stimulation. Amplitude: 5 V (supramaximal stimulus); pulse width: 0.1 msec; frequency: 0.1 Hz. Start the stimulation and test for muscle twitching.  Note: In these conditions, a hemidiaphragm muscle preparation can twitch at least 4 h.   If the muscle contracts properly, adjust the optimal tension for twitch response using the screw positioner. Slowly increase the muscle tension repeated times, alternating with 10-15 min periods of muscle stabilization, until, incrementing the resting tension, twitch amplitude does not increase any more. An optimal resting tension is around 0.3 V.   Let muscle twitch stabilize for further 20 min at 37 \u00b0C before starting the experiment or before adding a treatment.  Note: The mean twitch amplitude measured at the end of this period is used to normalize twitch values upon treatment.   Add the treatment directly into the stimulation chamber.    Using i-WORX 118 system with Labscribe software, record muscle twitch for the desired time or until muscle force completely drops.", "Note: The following is a step-by-step description of the experimental protocol we use to allow reliable triggering of aggression between pairs of male fruit flies (D. melanogaster).

The illustration below describes a possible manual analysis for a \"loser\" effect.Score the time of the first encounter between the flies on the food cup (encounters are interactions between pairs of flies that last at least 2 sec) and the time of appearance of the first lunge (a behavioral pattern in which one fly rises high on its hind legs and snaps down on and attempts to grab the opponent). Then, score the latency to lunge (the interval between the first encounter and the first lunge).\nCount the total number of encounters and lunges during a fight.\n\t\tNote: If desired, one also can score other behavioral patterns, like wing threat, boxing, fencing, retreat or the numbers of encounters before the first lunge, for example.\nScore the time of establishment of dominance (time between the first encounter and the time when one fly retreats for three consecutive times off the food cup after receiving lunges). Note which fly is the winner and which the loser of the fight.\nCalculating a \"Loser\" Effect\n\t\nDivide the number of fights in which previous losers lose 2nd fights (Losers that lose: LL) by the total number of fights, and multiply by 100. The percentage obtained represents the \"loser\" effect:\n\t\t[(# flies LL) / (# total fight)] x 100\nUse a Chi-square test to compare whether the \"loser\" effect is statistically different from the expected value of 50%.\nSubscription Required.

For 35\u00a0mm dish, appropriate number of cells was diluted to 1\u00a0mL culture medium and mixed well. Add the cells into dish and gently rock the dish to distribute the cells.\nNote: The proliferation rate of MEFs varies among different batches of mouse. We need to prepare 160,000 MEFs to repeat this experiment with appropriate cell confluence. The 30%\u201340% confluence of the initial cells will be hard for us to image at day 8 because of the rapid emergence of clones (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). So we need to prepare appropriate cell number in each dish and don\u2019t plate more than 40,000 cells per dish.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/692-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Calcein release assay\n(A) The morphological change occurs during reprogramming. The amount of cells is appropriate (Day 8-a) compared with too many ones, which form clones (Day 8-b). Scale bar corresponds to 100\u00a0\u03bcm.\n(B) Opening of mPTP was analyzed at days 0, 3, 5, and 8 during reprogramming. Scale bar corresponds to 20\u00a0\u03bcm.\nInfect MEFs with SKOM retrovirusesRemove the medium and add 2.5\u00a0mL SKOM viral supernatants to dish with 24\u00a0h incubation and infect two rounds (24\u00a0h each round).\nCalcein release assay\nTiming: [30\u201345\u00a0min]\nThis assay employs calcein-AM, a colorless and nonfluorescent esterase substrate, and CoCl2, a quencher of calcein fluorescence, to selectively label mitochondria. Cells are loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of calcein dye, calcein-AM, which passively diffuses into the cells and accumulates in cytosolic compartments, including the mitochondria. Once inside cells, intracellular esterases cleave the acetoxymethyl esters to liberate the very polar fluorescent dye calcein, which does not cross the mitochondrial or plasma membranes in appreciable amounts over relatively short periods of time. The fluorescence from cytosolic calcein is quenched by the addition of CoCl2, while the fluorescence from the mitochondrial calcein is maintained. When mPTP is open, more CoCl2 will go into mitochondria and quench calcein. The calcein fluorescence intensity indicates the opening of mPTP.\nWash cells twice with modified HBSS buffer.\nIncubate cells in 1\u00a0mL labeling solution for 15\u00a0min protected from light at 37\u00b0C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_692_4.csv\nNote: Labeling solution must be used immediately\nAfter incubation, cells were washed with 1\u00a0mL warm modified HBSS buffer for once to remove residual dye and minimize background.\nNote: Calcein release assay was carried out according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp35103.pdf&title=SW1hZ2UtaVQgTElWRSBNaXRvY2hvbmRyaWFsIFRyYW5zaXRpb24gUG9yZSBBc3NheSBLaXQ=[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp35103.pdf&title=SW1hZ2UtaVQgTElWRSBNaXRvY2hvbmRyaWFsIFRyYW5zaXRpb24gUG9yZSBBc3NheSBLaXQ=]) in Transition Pore Assay Kit. The hoechst and CoCl2 were stock solution in the Kit, we need to prepare the stock solution of calcein-AM (1\u00a0mM) with DMSO. Prepare labeling solution with these stock solutions and label cells for imaging as described at step 5.\nConfocal imaging\nTiming: [2 h/day]\nImage cells with Zeiss LSM710 (Calcein: Ex 488 and Emi 509; DAPI: Ex 405 and Emi 420) and find the reprogramming cells.At day 0, the reprogramming just begin and we can't select which cell will undergo reprogramming, so we image the cells at random.\nThe cells will go through MET (mesenchymal - epithelial transition) during reprogramming (Li et\u00a0al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and we found the cells begin undergoing epithelial-like morphological change from elongated cells to rounded cells at day 3 in our system (Ying et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] and Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). So image the morphology changed cells which are reprogramming cells at days 3, 5 and 8 during reprogramming process as shown in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nPrepare four dishes and the mPTP opening analysis was carried out at days 0, 3, 5 and 8 during reprogramming as shown in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nNote: In our system, the day that viral supernatants were removed was defined as day 0.\nAlternatives: Most confocal microscopes can image mPTP opening, such as Zeiss LSM 880 or Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope.\nSorting high and low mPTP opening cells\nCulture MEFs\nTiming: [2\u20133\u00a0days]\nAfter quickly thawing MEFs in a 37\u00b0C water bath, immediately transfer the thawed cell into a 15\u00a0mL tube containing 5\u00a0mL of fibroblast medium.\nCentrifuge the tube for 5\u00a0min at 200 g.\nDiscard the supernatant and transfer the cell to a 10\u00a0cm dish with 10\u00a0mL fibroblast medium and go to the next step at 2\u20133\u00a0days till the number of cells reach to 3\u20136 million (the confluence reaches to 60%\u201380%).\nStain MEFs\nTiming: [45\u201360\u00a0min]\nUse 1\u00a0mL DPBS to wash cells once and add 1\u00a0mL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 37\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL fibroblast medium, suspend MEFs and centrifuge for 5\u00a0min at 200 g.Suspend MEFs with modified HBSS buffer (Negative control, NC) or labeling solution without hoechst (modified HBSS buffer with 1\u00a0\u03bcM calcein and 1\u00a0mM CoCl2) at a final concentration of 1\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells/mL and incubate for 15\u00a0min protected from light at 37\u00b0C. The negative control is used to set up the MoFlo Astrios instrument with appropriate photomultiplier tubes (PMT) voltages refer to the guidelines for the use of flow cytometry (Cossarizza et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nAfter incubation, labeled cells were washed with 1\u00a0mL modified HBSS buffer and centrifuged for 5\u00a0min at 200 g and washed for twice to remove residual dye and minimize fluorescent background.\nSort the high and low mPTP opening cells\nTiming: [2\u20134 h]\nResuspend MEFs to 2% BSA in DPBS buffer and sort the mPTP opening cells according to calcein fluorescence intensity. Before sorting, we need to prepare the tubes with medium to collect the sorted cells. We also need to prepare the gelatin-coated 12-well plate for cell attachment after the sorting.\nCritical: The 12-well plate must be coated with gelatin otherwise many cells will die.\nSet the sorting parameters of flow cytometry with 488\u00a0nm excitation. We first gate the appropriate cells with signal cells and without debris (gate R1 and R2) and go to G2. And then in G2 we gate the low (R3) and high (R4) calcein fluorescence intensity cells (mean fluorescence intensity of high is about 10 times more than that of low) (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/692-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. The sorting parameters of flow cytometry\nWe first gate the appropriate cells with signal cells and without debris (gate R1 and R2) and go to G2. And then in G2 we gate the low (R3) and high (R4) calcein fluorescence intensity cells.Sort the cells with low and high calcein fluorescence intensity indicating high and low mPTP opening, respectively.\nPerform the reprogramming\nTiming: [18\u00a0days]\nPlate high and low mPTP opening cells to 12-well plate and incubate for 12\u00a0h for cell attachment.\nInfect the cells with SKOM retroviruses as described previous (In Prepare Viruses section and Prepare Cells section of Reprogramming cells)\nCount the efficiency of reprogramming at day 15. The reprogramming efficiency was determined by counting GFP-positive iPSC colonies.", "All surgical and animal handling procedures were performed as approved under the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council) and the Guidelines of the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. General Consideration\nUse adult female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (weighing 200 g, n=12) for this study. Habituate animals to all testing environments and collect baseline data for all behavior tests one week prior to the surgical procedure.\nPerform the behavioral assessments by two observers who are blinded to the experimental groups.\n2. Animal Preparation\nClean the surgical table with 70% ethanol. Place a pre-warmed heating pad on the surgical table. Cover the surgical area with a sterile surgical drape. Place the sterile gauze, cotton swabs, and autoclaved surgical tools on the surface of the surgical drape.\nTurn on a microbead sterilizer for the intersurgery sterilization of surgical tools.\n\tNOTE: An example of the tools used in this experiment is shown in Figure 1.\nAnesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine (87.7 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.3 mg/kg). Ensure that the proper plane of anesthesia is reached by no response to the toe pinch stimulus. Apply vet ointment to the eyes of the animal to prevent corneal drying during surgery.\nRemove the hair overlying the thoracic vertebrae by shaving (Figure 2A). Remove the shaved fur with a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter.\nClean the surgical area with three alternating scrubs of iodine-based scrub and ethanol.\nCover the animal with a sterile drape with a fenestration over the proposed incision site (Figure 2B). Note; In video, the surgical drape has been omitted for demonstration purposes.\u00a0\n3. Spinal HemisectionTouch the 13th rib which is the lowest rib in the rat and a floating rib that does not connect to the sternum. Follow the 13th rib dorsally to identify its connection with the T13 vertebra and then count up to identify the T10 vertebra.\nUse a scalpel blade (#15, Figure 1) to perform a 3 - 4 cm midline skin incision on the back overlying the 8-11th vertebral spinous processes.\nUnder a surgical microscope, bluntly dissect and separate the paraspinal muscles laterally from the spinous processes towards the facets of the T9 and T10 vertebrae on both sides using the same scalpel blade.\n\tNOTE: This approach will nicely tease the tissue apart without causing hemorrhage.\nStabilize the spine using a modified stabilizing holder. Make a slit on both sides of the lateral vertebral bone. Slide the stainless steel arms underneath the exposed transverse process facets and tighten the screws to secure stability.\nUse a retractor to retract muscles from the surgical area (Figure 2B) and to expose the T8-11 vertebral laminae and spinous processes (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: There is a large gap between the T8 and T9 spinous processes, which are landmarks for identifying T9 (Figure 2C, dorsal view). From the lateral view, the spinous process of the T9 vertebra points caudally, the T10 spinous process points dorsally, and the T11 spinous process points rostrally; so, the 3 spinous processes form a pyramid and the T10 spinous process forms the peak (Figure 2D, lateral view).Perform a dorsal laminectomy on the T9 vertebra using a rongeur. Snip away the T9 spinous process and remove a small portion of the lamina left to the midline (Figure 3A, dashed line), and the entire right portion of the lamina as laterally as possible (Figure 3A, dashed line). For laminectomy, insert the rongeur gently under the lamina and snip a small piece of bone at a time until a desired region of laminectomy is completed (Figure 3B and Figure 3C).\nUnder a surgical microscope, identify the dorsal midline of the spinal cord (Figure 3C). Insert a needle (30 G) vertically through the midline into the spinal cord with the beveled side facing the right side (Figure 4A).\n\tNOTE: The needle should penetrate the entire spinal cord to reach the ventral wall of the vertebral canal.\nStop any bleeding with a small piece of sterile gelfoam.\nInsert one tip of an iridectomy/microsurgical scissors through the midline needle track, and the other tip along the lateral surface of the right hemi-cord, and then make a complete cut on the right hemi-cord with the scissors (Figure 4B).\n\tNOTE: Use a sharp micro-scissors for the spinal cord cut to minimize compression lesion to the spinal cord during the cutting.\nUse the lateral edge of the same needle as a knife to cut through the lesion gap to confirm a complete right hemisection. Verify the completeness of the right hemisection by visualizing the bottom of the vertebral canal with the surgical microscope (Figure 4C, cross-sectional view; Figure 4D, lateral view; Figure 4E, dorsal view).\nPlace a small piece of gelatin sponge over the lesion site (Figure 4F). Use cement mixture and build a narrow bridge over the sponge and the spinous processes of T8 and T10 (Figure 4G, H).NOTE: The purpose of using a cement bridge is two-fold: 1) it separates the scar developed at the injury site from the rest of the tissue, and 2) it makes easier to dissect out the spinal cord segment after animal sacrifice.\nSuture the muscle and skin layers separately with 4-0 silk thread.\nInject 0.9% sterile saline subcutaneously to maintain hydration. Inject an analgesic agent Buprenorphine (0.05-2.0mg/kg S) 8-12 h/day subcutaneously for 2 days. Press urinary bladder 2-3 times daily for the first week and 1-2 times in the following weeks till spontaneous bladder voiding returns.\n4. Postoperative Animal Care\nReturn the animal to its single-housed home cage. Provide moist rodent chow or gel on the bottom of the cage to aid in animal\u2019s ability to eat/hydrate. Place a heating pad below the cage during post-surgery recovery. Make sure that the heating pad only covers half of the cage bottom to avoid overheating.\nInject 0.9% sterile saline subcutaneously to maintain hydration. Inject an analgesic agent Buprenorphine (0.05-2.0mg/kg S) 8-12 h/day subcutaneously for 2 days. Press urinary bladder 2-3 times daily for the first week and 1-2 times in the following weeks till spontaneous bladder voiding returns.\n5. Assess the Unilateral Hemisection Stepping (UHS)\nNOTE: The unilateral hemisection stepping (UHS) test is a direct measure of the ability of SCI animals to utilize their ipsilesional hindlimb in the open field. As mentioned in 1.1, the animals were acclimated to an open field environment (diameter 42 inches) 15 twice a day for 7 days. Two observers blinded to the animal groups perform the test. UHS score at both baseline (7 days prior to the T9 HX) and time points after injury will be collected. The steps for assessment are described as followed.Place the animal into an open field environment and examine the animal\u2019s locomotion for 4 min.\n\tNOTE: During testing, encouragement may be given to the animal to move actively.\nWith the form provided in Table 1, assign a value of 1 for Yes and 0 for No for each behavior category and then sum the total value to give a final UHS score of 0 to 8.\n\tNOTE: According to Table 1 0: no observable movement of the hindlimb; 1 \u2013 4: isolated movements of 3 hindlimb joints (hip, knee, and ankle); 5: sweeping with no weight support; 6: placing with no weight support; 7: placing with weight support; and 8: stepping with weight support.\nCollect UHS scores at both baseline (7 days prior to the T9 HX) and time points after injury.\n\tNOTE: The scores will be assessed at various time points after the T9 HX.\n6. Coupling\nAnalyze the CPL (gait coupling) with a video recording an animal walking on a narrow runway device or a simple open-field.\nIn the coupling section of Table 1, assign a score of 0 for \u201cNo\u201d, 1 for \u201cIrregular/clumsy\u201d, and 2 for \u201cNormal\u201d for each CPL category.\n\tNOTE: The coupling (CPL) test is to evaluate the coordination of alternating movements of limbs, including homologous CPL (front-front/rear-rear limbs, Figure 5A), diagonal CPL (front left-rear right or front right-rear left limbs, Figure 5B), and homolateral CPL (front-rear limbs on the same side, Figure 5C). Following a T9 HX, the deficits of the hindlimb on the ipsilesional side become visible resulting in the alternation of the homologous CPL (Figure 5D), diagonal CPL (Figure 5E), and homolateral CPL (Figure 5F).\n7. Contact PlacingNOTE: The hindlimb contact placing test is used to evaluate the motor integration of hindlimb responses to proprioceptive stimuli 16. Proprioception is considered to be intact if the animal steps up with its hindlimb onto the surface after the hindlimb is pulled down below the surface.\nHold the animal in a vertical position so that both hindlimbs are available for the placing response.\nBrush the dorsal surface of a hindlimb forward lightly towards the edge of a surface (e.g., animal working bench).\nObserve the foot placement onto the surface and assign a hindlimb contact placing score. 0: no placing; 1: placing.\n\tNOTE: The dorsal surface receives stimulation and the foot will subsequently extend and place the foot on the surface if the reflex is intact. The assessment form is also in Table 1.\n8. Grid Walking\nNOTE: The grid walking test assesses spontaneous motor deficits and limb movements involved in precise stepping, coordination, and accurate paw placement.\nPlace a rat on an elevated plastic-coated wire mesh grid (36 \u00d7 38 cm with 3 cm2 openings) and allow it to walk freely across the platform for 30 steps.\nCount the total number of footsteps and the number of foot missteps for each limb. Video recordings are made to confirm the counting.\n\tNOTE: Two blinded observers assess paw placement of forelimbs and hindlimbs as animals walk.\nAssign the grid walking scores for each hindlimb as follows \u2013 0: missteps greater than 15; 1: missteps less than or equal to 15; 2: missteps less than or equal to 10; and 3: missteps less than or equal to 5.\n\tNOTE: The scoring assessment is based on Table 1. The cutoffs scores are used as measures of severity of motor deficits.\n9. Perfusion and Tissue ProcessingAfter appropriate anesthesia similar in step 2.3, perfuse the animals carefully following the transcardial perfusion protocol 17.\nDissect and collect the spinal cord samples and post-fix them in 4% PFA overnight.\nThe samples can then be transferred to 30% sucrose solution.\nCut the spinal cord in cross sections and stain the selected sections with an axon marker SMI-31 and astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) according to standard procedures18.", "The procedure for folding and biotinylation of pMHC I complexes is based on previously described protocols, with some adaptations (Garboczi, Hung, & Wiley, 1992[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0006]; Rodenko et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0015]; Toebes, Rodenko, Ovaa, & Schumacher, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0019]). Conditional complexes are produced from MHC I heavy chain inclusion bodies, prefolded \u03b22m (described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0006]) and a template peptide (IAKEPVHGV for HLA-A*02:01 or FAPGNAPAL for H-2Kb). The MHC I heavy chain contains a 15-amino acid C-terminal recognition sequence for the BirA biotin ligase, which enzymatically conjugates a biotin molecule to the lysine in that sequence. The degree of biotinylation of pMHC I monomers following Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001] should be (near) complete, but it is recommended to determine the degree of biotinylation for each batch of pMHC I as described in Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0007].

Prepare 500 \u00b5l fresh denaturing buffer.\n2. In a 1.5-ml reaction tube, dissolve \u223c2.5 mg of MHC I heavy chain inclusion bodies (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0005]) in 500 \u00b5l denaturing buffer. Rotate at room temperature for at least 2 hr and preferably overnight to ensure complete dissolution.\n3. Set up 50 ml folding buffer in a 50-ml conical tube, rotate \u223c15 min at RT, and then cool on ice for 1\u22121.5 hr.\n4. In the meantime, dissolve 3 mg of template peptide in \u223c500 \u00b5l DMSO, and sonicate 10\u221215 min.\nPeptides that contain hydrophobic amino acids dissolve poorly in polar solvents, such as PBS or water. Therefore, it is recommended to dissolve peptides in DMSO and store them as 10-mM stocks at \u201320\u00b0C. Sonication of freshly prepared solutions, preferably in a warm water bath, improves solubility.\n5. Add template peptide solution to the tube containing 50 ml folding buffer (60 \u00b5M final concentration).\n6. Thaw a 1.2-mg aliquot of prefolded \u03b22m (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0006]).\n7. Microcentrifuge \u03b22m and MHC I heavy chain for 2 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, save 1 \u00b5l of each supernatant at \u221220\u00b0C as a reference for SDS-PAGE analysis (step 18), and add the remainder of each supernatant to the folding buffer containing template peptide (final concentrations: 6 \u00b5M \u03b22m and 3 \u00b5M MHC I heavy chain).\n8. Filter the folding solution through a 0.22-\u00b5m filter using a syringe and leave in a 10\u00b0C water bath for 4\u22125 days.\nLarge-scale reactions can be filtered using a bottle-top filter.\nBiotinylation of pMHC I complexesNOTE: Folded complexes will dissociate at elevated temperatures, so from this point, keep all solutions and reagents on ice and centrifuges at 4\u00b0C!\n9. Sediment aggregates in the folding solution by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C to, and filter supernatant through a 0.45-\u00b5m filter using a syringe.\nDepending on the purity of the inclusion bodies some protein aggregates may form during folding. Removing precipitates by centrifugation and filtering prevents obstruction of the filters used for concentration.\n10. Wash a 15-ml 30-kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator first with Milli-Q water and then with MHC buffer by centrifugation for 10 min each at 4,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Add the filtered folding reaction (from step 9) and concentrate to \u22641 ml by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C.\nFor concentration of large-scale reactions use a 30-kDa MWCO PES Vivaflow 200 protein concentrator system (Sartorius), driven by a peristaltic pump.\n11. In a cold room, recover concentrated sample and exchange the folding buffer for MHC buffer using a NAP-10 column: Wash the column 3 times with 1 ml MHC buffer, apply sample, and elute with 1 ml MHC buffer.\n12. Filter concentrated folding reaction through a SpinX centrifuge tube filter by centrifugation for 2 min (or longer if necessary) at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C.\n13. Prepare biotinylation solution (see recipe) on ice, and add 1 ml biotinylation solution to the 1 ml pMHC I solution. Incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C, preferably on a rotator.\nThe enzymatic activity of BirA biotin ligase is low at 4\u00b0C, and therefore the biotinylation reaction requires overnight incubation (\u223c16 hr).\nPurification of biotinylated pMHC I\n14. Sediment aggregates in the biotinylation solution by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C.Some precipitation may form overnight. Sedimentation prevents obstruction of the filters used for concentration.\n15. Wash a 0.5-ml 30-kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator with Milli-Q water and then with MHC buffer. Concentrate biotinylation reaction to \u223c500 \u00b5l by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C.\n16. Filter concentrated solution containing biotinylated pMHC I through a SpinX centrifuge tube filter by centrifugation for 2 min (or longer if necessary) at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C.\n17. Purify biotinylated pMHC I complexes by gel-filtration chromatography at 4\u00b0C, for example, using an FPLC system equipped with a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare).\nOne 50-ml folding reaction typically yields between 0.1 and 2 mg of folded complex depending on the peptide and MHC I allele. The total volume can be concentrated to \u223c500 \u00b5l for one injection on an S75 10/300 column. Larger-scale reactions yield higher protein quantities and should be purified in multiple 500-\u00b5l runs or using a larger column, such as an S75 16/600.\n18. Analyze fractions using SDS-PAGE. For reference include a protein standard, such as SeeBlue\u2122 Pre-stained Protein Standard, and the reference MHC I heavy chain and \u03b22m samples (set aside in step 7). Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0002] shows a typical FPLC chromatogram and corresponding gel.\nWe typically run our complexes on a 10% Bis-Tris gel for 30 min at 200 V in MES buffer. On a denaturing gel, the complex dissociates and two bands will be visible: one at \u223c36 kDa corresponding to the heavy chain, and one at \u223c10 kDa, corresponding to \u03b22m. The peptide is too small to visualize on gel.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6f84bf7c-e343-4b0a-b1d0-981fdda57dec/cpim85-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2SDS-PAGE analysis (10% Bis-Tris gel in MES running buffer) of a typical pMHC I purification using FPLC. The first peak in the chromatogram contains mostly aggregates, whereas the second peak (marked with an asterisk) contains properly folded, pure pMHC I complexes, visible on this denaturing gel as two separate bands for the heavy chain (\u223c36 kDa) and \u03b22m (\u223c10 kDa). Later peaks contain free heavy chain and free \u03b22m. A protein marker, MHC I heavy chain inclusion bodies and prefolded \u03b22m are included for reference.\n19. Pool fractions that contain pMHC I, and concentrate to 2\u22125 mg/ml using a 15-ml 30-kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator (prewashed with Milli-Q water and MHC buffer).\npMHC I complexes are more stable at higher concentrations.\nThe concentration can be measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and the Lambert-Beer Law: c = A/\u03b5\u00d7L. The extinction coefficient (\u03b5) at OD280 can be estimated from the number of tryptophans (W) and tyrosines (Y) in the protein sequence according to the following formula: \u03b5 = (nW \u00d7 5500) + (nY \u00d7 1490).\n20. Determine the volume of the sample and add glycerol to a final concentration of 15%.\nGlycerol is added as a cryoprotectant. It forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thus preventing the formation of ice crystals that can damage proteins.\n21. Aliquot the sample into PCR tubes or 1.5-ml polypropylene screw cap tubes, depending on the desired volume. Snap-freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at \u201380\u00b0C.\nWe typically store aliquots of 5, 10, and 25 \u00b5l. Frozen conditional pMHC I monomers can be stored at \u201380\u00b0C for at least a year. We recommend validation of the exchange performance (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0002]) before moving on to multimerization.For each batch of conditional pMHC I monomers, the thermal exchange performance should be validated. This protocol describes the use of gel filtration HPLC to confirm exchange at pre-established conditions, but can also be used to test additional exchange times and temperatures. When incubated at a higher temperature without peptide, the pMHC I monomer peak should disappear (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0003], magenta line compared to black line), but in the presence of an exchange peptide the complex is stabilized and the peak should remain visible (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0003], green line). For efficient stabilization the exchange peptide should have a higher affinity for its corresponding MHC I than the template peptide (<4,000 nM for H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL and <7,288 nM for HLA-A*02:01). A link to an affinity prediction tool is provided in Internet Resources.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bc602487-302c-40e2-8f02-03463e3abf71/cpim85-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nOverlay of typical gel filtration HPLC chromatograms that confirm thermal exchange of conditional HLA-A*02:01 monomers (left) and H-2Kb monomers (right). When incubated without peptide the HLA-A*02:01 monomer peak (0.5 \u00b5M) disappears (no peptide, magenta line), indicating dissociation, whereas in presence of a high-affinity peptide (50 \u00b5M) the complex remains stable (+peptide, green line) compared to nonincubated monomers (MHC input, black line). H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL dissociates at room temperature (pMHC I input black line), which can be \u201crescued\u201d by addition of a high-affinity peptide (+peptide, green line).\nMaterials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001])\nConditional pMHC I monomers (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001])\nCold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4; tablets reconstituted in 500 ml demineralized water; Gibco)\n10 mM exchange peptide in DMSO, higher affinity than the template peptide (e.g., cytomegalovirus peptide NLVPMVATV for HLA-A*02:01 or ovalbumin peptide SIINFEKL for H-2Kb)\nHPLC system with gel filtration column (e.g., 300 \u00d7 7.8-mm BioSep SEC-s3000; Phenomenex, cat. no. 00H-2146-K0)\nPCR machine, Thermoblock, or incubator\nTesting the stability of pMHC I monomers at room temperature1. Thaw conditional pMHC I monomers on ice. Typically, a 5-\u00b5l aliquot of 2\u20135 mg/ml pMHC I monomer is enough for four to ten 100-\u00b5l injections of 0.5 \u00b5M pMHC I monomers.\n2. In a 1.5-ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tube, dilute conditional pMHC I monomers to 0.5 \u00b5M in PBS.\nWe typically prepare 10% extra to allow for variance when drawing up the sample for injection.\n3. Sediment aggregates by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature.\n4. Analyze the sample by HPLC using a gel filtration column, such as a 300 \u00d7 7.8-mm BioSep SEC-s3000 column (Phenomenex) with PBS as running buffer.\nAnalysis of this sample provides information on the stability of the conditional complex at room temperature. Expect to see a sharp peak when injecting HLA-A*02:01-IAKEPVHGV, but no peak when injecting H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL, which is unstable at room temperature (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0003], pMHC I input; black lines).\nAnalysis of peptide-mediated stabilization of pMHC I monomers post thermal exchange\n5. Prepare 0.5 \u00b5M pMHC I in PBS containing 50 \u00b5M exchange peptide to confirm stabilization of the exchanged complex.\n6. Incubate at established exchange conditions in a PCR machine, Thermoblock, or incubator (3 hr at 32\u00b0C for HLA-A*02:01; 5 min at room temperature for H-2Kb).\n7. Sediment aggregates by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature.\n8. Analyze by gel-filtration HPLC.\nWhen incubated with an exchange peptide, the MHC monomer peak should be at least as high as the input peak.\nThermal dissociation of conditional pMHC I monomers\n9. Prepare a 0.5 \u00b5M pMHC I solution in PBS.\n10. Incubate at established exchange conditions in a PCR machine, Thermoblock, or incubator (3 hr at 32\u00b0C for HLA-A*02:01 or 5 min at room temperature for H-2Kb).11. Sediment aggregates by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature.\n12. Analyze by gel-filtration HPLC.\nAt the optimal exchange conditions (3 hr at 32\u00b0C for HLA-A*02:01, and 5 min at room temperature for H-2Kb) the monomer peak should virtually disappear when incubated without peptide (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0003]).The low affinity of a T cell receptor (TCR) for pMHC I monomers enables sequential activation of multiple T cells by one pMHC in vivo. Through multimeric binding, the avidity of pMHC binding to TCRs becomes sufficiently high to stably label specific CD8+ T cells for visualization and isolation (Davis, Altman, & Newell, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0005]). Therefore, pMHC I monomers are biotinylated for multimerization on streptavidin in order to create tetrameric complexes. In addition, labeled streptavidin can be used to incorporate desired fluorophores. Allophycocyanin (APC) and phycoerythrin (PE) are typically used, but other fluorophores have also been successfully used in combination with pMHC I multimers. This protocol describes the preparation of 80 \u00b5l pMHC I multimer solution (0.625 \u00b5M final), but the reaction can be scaled depending on concentration and volume of pMHC I aliquots.\nMaterials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0002])\nBiotinylated conditional pMHC I monomers (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001])\n1 mg/ml APC-conjugated streptavidin (SA-APC; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, cat. no. S868) or 1 mg/ml PE-conjugated streptavidin (SA-PE; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen, cat. no. S866)\nCold glycerol\nNOTE: Folded complexes will dissociate at elevated temperatures. Keep all solutions and reagents on ice and centrifuges at 4\u00b0C!\n1. On ice, dilute biotinylated conditional pMHC I monomers in cold PBS to a concentration of 5 \u00b5M.\n2a. If making APC-labeled multimers: Add 53.6 \u00b5l cold PBS to 10 \u00b5l of pMHC I monomers.\n2b. If making PE-labeled multimers: Add 52.4 \u00b5l cold PBS to 10 \u00b5l of pMHC I monomers.\n3. Add either 1.4 \u00b5l SA-APC or 2.6 \u00b5l SA-PE. To ensure saturation of all four biotin-binding sites, add streptavidin conjugates stepwise. For example, three 0.47-\u00b5l additions of SA-APC or three 0.87-\u00b5l additions of SA-PE at 5-min intervals.To saturate all four of streptavidin's binding sites, 0.125 \u00b5M streptavidin should be added to 0.5 \u00b5M pMHC I monomer, corresponding to 2 \u00b5g of SA-APC (molecular weight \u223c160 kDa) or 3.75 \u00b5g of SA-PE (molecular weight \u223c300 kDa) per 100 \u00b5l pMHC I solution. To ensure binding sites are fully saturated, we add 70% of these amounts for a ratio of \u223c6 pMHC I monomers to 1 streptavidin. With an excess of streptavidin not all binding sites would be saturated, resulting in the formation of lower order MHC I multimers that poorly bind T cells due to lower avidity. Ideally a little residual MHC I monomer remains present, ensuring full saturation of streptavidin.\n4. Add 15 \u00b5l cold glycerol and mix well.\n5. Aliquot into PCR tubes or 1.5-ml polypropylene screw cap tubes, depending on the desired volume. Snap-freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at \u201380\u00b0C.\nWe typically prepare 8-\u00b5l aliquots. Frozen pMHC I multimers can be stored at \u201380\u00b0C for at least a year.This protocol describes the thermal exchange of conditional pMHC I multimers for any number of desired peptides in parallel. Conditional multimers are temperature-labile and should be kept on ice until a peptide is added. For efficient stabilization the exchange peptide should have a higher affinity than the template peptide (<4,000 nM for H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL and <7,288 nM for HLA-A*02:01) for MHC I. One 10 \u00b5l aliquot of exchanged multimer is typically enough to stain ten to twenty samples, each containing 1,000,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).\nMaterials (also see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0001] to 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0003])\n10 mM exchange peptide(s) stock solution\nConditional pMHC I multimers (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0003])\n1. Dilute 10 mM exchange peptide stock(s) to 250 \u00b5M in PBS.\nHydrophobic peptides do not readily dissolve in PBS. Therefore it is recommended to dissolve peptides in DMSO and store them as 10-mM stocks at \u201320\u00b0C.\n2. Take an 8-\u00b5l aliquot of MHC I multimer from freezer and immediately place on ice.\nConditional MHC I multimers may dissociate at room temperature and should be kept cold prior to exchange, so make sure to keep them on ice when moving them from freezer to bench. Especially H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL is prone to rapid dissociation and should remain frozen until an exchange peptide is added.\n3. Add 2 \u00b5l 250 \u00b5M exchange peptide solution to frozen 8 \u00b5l MHC I multimer. As the mixture thaws, briefly pipette up and down to mix.\n4. Briefly spin and incubate exchange reactions in a PCR machine, Thermoblock, or incubator at defined temperature and time to induce exchange.\nH-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL readily exchanges within 5 min at room temperature. Exchange of HLA-A*02:01-IAKEPVHGV multimers is complete after a 3-hr incubation at 32\u00b0C.\n5. Briefly spin the tubes. The exchanged multimers are now ready for staining of T cells.Exchanged multimers can be stored at 4\u00b0C and used for at least a week without loss of function. They can typically be diluted 1:40 to stain 1,000,000 PBMCs in 40 \u00b5l of FACS buffer.The procedure for bacterial expression and purification of MHC I heavy chain and \u03b22m inclusion bodies is based on protocols described previously (Garboczi et\u00a0al., 1992[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0006]; Rodenko et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0015]; Toebes et\u00a0al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-bib-0019]).

Repeat steps 22 and 23.\n25. Suspend inclusion bodies in 10 ml wash buffer without Triton, and measure the protein concentration, e.g., using the Bradford assay.\nDepending on the construct, expression yields are between 50 and 250 mg/L with a protein purity of 90%\u201398%.\n26. Prepare desired aliquots, and pellet inclusion bodies by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, and discard the supernatant.We recommend freezing aliquots of 2.5 mg (or multiples thereof), since we typically use 2.5 mg inclusion bodies per 50 ml folding reaction. Inclusion bodies can be stored at \u201380\u00b0C for at least a year.Human \u03b22m is used for the production of both human and murine MHC I complexes, because of its higher stability compared to its murine counterpart. Using prefolded \u03b22m for folding of pMHC I ensures stabilization of MHC I and increases folding yields compared to using \u03b22m inclusion bodies.\nMaterials\nDenaturing buffer (8 M urea/100 mM Tris\u2022Cl, pH 8)\nPurified human \u03b22m inclusion bodies (Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-prot-0005])\n10 mM Tris\u2022Cl (pH 7) in PBS\nDialysis tubing (10 kDa MWCO) and large beaker or bucket\n1.

The next day, dialyze against two changes of fresh buffer, 4 hr each.\nDuring dialysis, some \u03b22m will precipitate, that can be collected, dissolved in fresh denaturing buffer and dialyzed in a new dialysis tube for increased protein yield.\n4.

Determine the concentration of the folded \u03b22m protein, e.g., using a Bradford assay.\n7. Prepare desired aliquots of folded \u03b22m, snap freeze, and store at \u221280\u00b0C.\nA typical 50-ml pMHC I folding reaction requires one aliquot of 1.2 mg \u03b22m.This protocol describes how to use HPLC to determine the degree of biotinylation of MHC I monomers. Each batch of pMHC I monomers and preferably each batch of streptavidin should be tested. MHC I multimers will form by addition of streptavidin, and the height of the monomer peak in the chromatogram will decrease with increasing ratios of streptavidin (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.85#cpim85-fig-0004]). Generally, 90%\u221295% of pMHC I monomers will be biotinylated. When testing highly unstable complexes, such as H-2Kb-FAPGNAPAL, exchange peptide should be added for stabilization. If samples can be measured on a cooled (4\u00b0C) HPLC system, the peptide can be omitted.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e2e4b93b-3f5b-4c78-b593-6326e228954a/cpim85-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nOverlay of HPLC chromatograms that confirm biotinylation of pMHC I monomers.

This direct delivery of drug into the vein allows it to rapidly reach the brain and link the operant response to the rewarding effects felt upon drug delivery. For a schematic of the catheters we use, refer to Figure 1B.Perform surgery to implant an intravenous catheter into the right jugular vein of each rat. For a list of parts for this surgery refer to the Equipment section, and for a detailed video of the steps of surgery please refer to Feng et al., 2015.We use short pieces of Tygon tubing that have been sealed off at one end (referred to as I.V . blockers; see Figure 1B: Item 4) to cap the entry port of the catheters. Zinc-coated hex bolts (referred to as bolts; see Figure 1B: Item 5) are also used to protect the threads and the entry port of the catheters. We have found that this combination works better for our catheters than other commercially available catheter blockers.\u00a0The bolt and I.V. blocker are removed prior to behavioral training, sterilized in 70% ethanol during behavioral sessions, and reattached prior to returning rats to their home cages. Post-surgery care Post-operative care includes daily monitoring of rats, and post-surgical observations are documented on each rat\u2019s cage card for at least three days.Measure and record body weight for each rat. Monitor weight loss and report to your institutional veterinarian if a rat loses > 10% of its body weight in a day. Typically, rats lose ~10 g the day after surgery and will regain this weight during their recovery period.Give rats subcutaneous injections of the veterinary nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketoprofen (2.5 mg/kg) once rats have shown complete recovery from anesthesia (approximately 1-2 h after surgery) and also the next day to provide analgesia and decrease inflammation. Discontinue this step after the first day unless rats show signs of distress on the following days.Fill a 1 ml Luer-lock syringe with gentamicin solution (4.25 mg/ml in sterile saline). Connect it to the catheter port using a piece of connecting Tygon tubing attached to a modified needle on the end of the syringe. Slowly inject 0.1 ml gentamicin solution into vein through the catheter. This step helps to minimize microbial infection following surgery and maintain catheter patency.Behavior room setupThe behavior room, sound attenuating chambers, and behavioral testing boxes should all be sanitized prior to starting any behavioral run. Additionally, test all equipment (pumps, lights, levers) and behavioral monitoring programs, assign rats to individual behavior boxes, and set up individual drug syringes for each rat on the day before the first session. In our original study, we used a cocaine dose of 0.75 mg/kg/infusion and an infusion volume of 0.1 ml/infusion during all phases of behavioral training. Please refer to Figure 1A for a detailed schematic showing the setup of the behavioral chambers and the components described during this protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191202/20191202012209_6923.jpgFigure 1.

B. Intravenous catheter with components.(1) Intravenous tubing, (2) Back-mount, (3) Threaded connection port, (4) Intravenous blocker, (5) Zinc-coated hex bolt.Drug syringes: Weigh each rat the day before the first training session and assign correct dosages based on individual weights. Refer to Cocaine dose calculations in Notes for an example of cocaine dose calculation. Label each syringe with the rat number, the number of the behavior chamber in which they are trained, and the dose of cocaine they need based on their weight. Each rat\u2019s drug dose should also be checked against their weight periodically to account for changes of dose based on weight increases during the course of training.\u00a0Counterbalancing cues: As discussed earlier, we used two different light cues as the discriminative stimuli in our task. We used different color caps (red vs. white) and different spatial locations (left vs. right side of the central lever) to help rats discriminate between these two stimuli during training. Although we did not observe any differences in training based on which light cue was used as the DS+ or DS-, it is advisable to counterbalance the two colors across your behavior boxes. For example, if the two light colors are white and red, set up your boxes so that the DS+ light is red in half of the boxes and white in the other half.\u00a0Lever tightness: When using Med Associates levers, downward deflection of the lever (i.e., a lever press) leads to the temporary closure of a switch that is in turn read as an operant response by the computer. The tension on these levers can be adjusted (by tightening a spring) to precisely control how much force is necessary to trigger the switch. As rats of different weights (e.g., male vs.female rats of similar ages) might have varying amounts of strength, we tune the lever \u2018tightness\u2019 based on the size of the rats but keep it consistent between boxes of rats with similar weights. To optimize lever tightness, we recommend that you observe the rats on the first few days of training and confirm that they are able to depress the lever (such that it reads as a response on the computer) when they lean onto it with both front paws. If a rat is unable to depress the lever (because it is too tight) and receive reinforcement, it will not learn that responses on the lever lead to reward, making it unlikely that it will learn the task.Cocaine self-administration training stage 1: Continuous access (2 x 3 h sessions per day, 3 consecutive days, see Figure 2A) The goal of this stage is to train rats to press the central retractable lever to receive an infusion of cocaine. In this stage, the lever is permanently available throughout the session, and the light on the left of the lever is always on. This is the light that will eventually turn on during DS+ trials in the trial-based task. Responses on the lever result in a single 3.5 s infusion of cocaine (0.75 mg/kg/inf) through the back-mounted intravenous catheter. Additional responses during this 3.5 s period are not reinforced. By the end of this stage, rats should stably administer 25-30 infusions of cocaine in each 3 h session.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191202/20191202012411_2614.jpgFigure 2. Behavioral procedure. A. Timeline-training.

Timeline-relapse tests. Relapse tests are conducted immediately following training, after increasing periods of forced abstinence. C. Trial design.Timing of events during a single trial block and distinction between the two trial types.Bring rats out of the vivarium and to the room in which behavioral procedures will be conducted.\u00a0Measure and record body weight for each rat at the start of the day. Always check to ensure that rats have not lost weight (> 10% decrease in body weight) compared to the previous day. Typically, rats will gain ~2-5 g each day during cocaine self-administration training.\u00a0Disconnect the bolt and I.V. blocker from the catheter port. Place them in 70% ethanol.\u00a0Administer 0.1 ml gentamicin intravenously (as described in Procedure B) to each rat and connect its back-mounted catheter to the drug line and swivel-tethered protective spring sleeve in its assigned operant box. Immediately prior to attaching a rat to its drug line, manually activate the pump motor to run the line through with drug and confirm that it is dripping consistently out of the end of the line. This allows you to test the infusion pumps and to ensure that there are no interruptions and/or air bubbles in the fluid line.\u00a0Close the doors of both the behavioral chamber and the sound-attenuating chamber. Once all rats are in their respective boxes, set up the MedPC program and start the behavioral session.\u00a0The sequence of steps described above in Steps D1-D5 is hereafter referred to in the protocol as \u2018loading rats\u2019.Perform checks on behavior of rats to ensure that they are not becoming tangled in their tethers and/or detached from their drug lines. Also, observe that the timing of infusions is regular and uniformly spaced during the session. Rats typically take 8-12 infusions per hour at the 0.75 mg/kg/inf. dose recommended for this procedure. It is recommended that you check on the rats once every 30-45 min.Perform checks more frequently if rats are rapidly increasing their levels of cocaine self-administration, as it may become more likely that they will become tangled/detached as a result of increased activity.At this stage of training, not all rats will readily pick up self-administration (i.e., press the lever to complete the operant requirement to receive cocaine reward). Priming may be necessary to facilitate learning for any rats that have not performed a lever press within the first 45 min of the first training session. Follow the Cocaine priming procedure in Notes. If any rats show signs of loss of catheter patency, conduct appropriate tests to confirm patency (see Notes 6-7).Wait 30 min after the end of the first session of each day before starting the second session. Do not remove rats from boxes between the first and second session of the day.At the end of the afternoon session, disconnect each rat from its spring and infusion line, flush with 0.1 ml gentamicin and reattach the bolt and I.V. blocker to its catheter. Place each rat back in its homecage and return to the vivarium. This sequence of steps is hereafter referred to in the protocol as \u2018unloading rats\u2019.Log the body weight of each rat, the number of lever responses made per session, and the number of infusions received during each 3-h session. Plot these measures as the mean of all rats in the group each day.Repeat Steps D1-D11 for 3 days. If rats do not achieve stable levels of drug intake, this stage of training can be extended for an additional 2 days (4 more sessions).Give rats a day off from behavior training prior to starting the next stage of training. We typically train rats that have not reached stable responding on two additional remedial sessions during this day off.Cocaine self-administration training stage 2: Introduction to trial format (2 x 3 h sessions per day, 30 DS+ only trials in the morning, 30 DS- only trials in the afternoon, 2 consecutive days, see Figures 2A and 2C) The goal of this stage is to train rats to continue pressing the central retractable lever when the task format is switched from continuous access to a trial-based design. In this stage, rats get 30 DS+ trials in the morning session and 30 DS- trials in the afternoon session. Each trial begins by the illumination of the respective cue light for 30 s, followed by the extension of the lever. After 60 s of lever access, the trial ends as the cue light turns off and the lever is retracted. The end of each trial is followed by a variable inter-trial interval (ITI-270 s average), after which a new trial begins. During DS+ trials, the light on the left side of the lever is illuminated and responses on the lever result in a single 3.5 s infusion of cocaine (0.75 mk/kg/inf). Additional responses during this 3.5 s period are not reinforced. During DS- trials, the light on the right side of the lever is illuminated and responses on the lever do not result in cocaine infusions. Thus, during this phase, rats learn the trial-based format and also experience both trial types, but in isolation. By the end of this phase, rats should still stably administer 25-30 infusions of cocaine in the DS+ only session but should reduce responding during the DS- only session.\u00a0Load rats and run them on the appropriate MedPC program by following Steps D1-D5.\u00a0Perform checks on behavior of rats as described earlier (Step D7).A sudden change in rates of responding can be an indicator that a rat is not receiving its expected level of drug reward per infusion\u2013this could happen because of pump failure, catheter failure, lever malfunction, depletion of the syringe, or disconnection of the rat\u2019s drug infusion line during the session. If this occurs, first disconnect the rat from its line and then perform necessary checks to determine the source of the problem. Only reconnect the rat once you have corrected the situation. For more details on loss of patency, refer to Checking for Catheter Patency in Notes.At this stage of training, prime any rat who appears to be responding significantly less in the morning sessions because of the switch to the trial format and/or those who are still not responding consistently. Do not prime the rats during DS- only sessions. Follow the Cocaine priming procedure in Notes. If any rat shows signs of loss of catheter patency, conduct appropriate tests to confirm patency (see Notes 6-7).Wait 30 min after the end of the first session of each day before starting the second session. Do not remove rats from boxes between the first and second session of the day.At the end of the afternoon session, disconnect each rat from its spring and infusion line, flush with 0.1 ml gentamicin and reattach the bolt and I.V. blocker to its catheter. Place each animal back in its homecage and return to the vivarium.Record the body weight of each rat, as well as the number of trials of each type in which an animal makes at least one response (\u201ctrials\u201d). Also, record the number of lever responses made during each trial type per session (\u201clever presses\u201d) and the number of infusions received across all DS+ trials in a 3 h session (\u201cinfusions\u201d).Plot these measures as the mean of all rats in the group each day.Repeat Steps E1-E7 for 2 days. If rats do not achieve stable levels of drug intake, this stage of training can be extended for an additional 2 days (4 more sessions).Give rats a day off from behavior training prior to starting the next stage of training. We typically train rats that haven\u2019t reached stable responding on two additional remedial sessions during this day off.Cocaine self-administration training stage 3: Discrimination (2 x 3 h sessions per day with pseudorandomized presentation of 30 DS+ and 30 DS- trials in every session, 5-10 days, see Figures 2A and 2C)The goal of this stage is to train rats to discriminate between DS+ and DS- trials and only respond on the central retractable lever during DS+ trials. In this stage, rats get 30 DS+ and 30 DS- trials in each 3 h session. Trial timing and reward rules for each trial type are the same as in the previous phase, but the inter-trial intervals are reduced to a 90 s average to accommodate for the additional trials in each 3 h session, and DS+ and DS- trials are presented in a pseudorandomized manner so that rats are required to pay attention to the DS in order to determine whether cocaine is available. Thus, during this stage, rats learn to respond discriminatively (i.e., to respond only during DS+ trials) and stably administer 25-30 infusions of cocaine in each 3 h session. We average each rat\u2019s discrimination ratio (DR, total number of lever presses during all DS+ trials/total number of lever presses during all DS- trials) over the last 3 sessions and consider a rat to be trained when its DR \u2265 3.Load rats and run them on the appropriate MedPC program by following Steps D1-D5.At this stage of training, prime rats who demonstrate low overall levels of responding (i.e., those who do not appear to be responding consistently enough to achieve at least 10 infusions per session-see Expected behavioral response timing in Notes for more details on \u201cconsistent\u201d responding). Do not prime during DS- trials. Cease all priming efforts starting at the third-to-last training session before the Day 1 relapse test. Follow the Cocaine priming procedure in Notes. If any rats show signs of loss of catheter patency, conduct appropriate tests to confirm patency (see Notes 6-7).Perform checks on behavior of rats as described earlier (Step D7).Continue to ensure that any apparent sudden behavioral changes are not the result of failures of any of the mechanisms involved in drug delivery (for more details on this, see Step E3).Wait 30 min after the end of the first session of each day before starting the second session. Do not remove rats from boxes between the first and second session of the day.\u00a0See Step D10 for details on unloading rats after the second session of the day and Step E7 for details on recording data.Repeat Steps F1-F6 until rats show stable discriminated responding for cocaine. Typically, rats achieve stable discrimination over 10-16 sessions (5-8 days).\u00a0Give rats a day off from behavior after 3-5 consecutive training days and ensure that they have at least 3 consecutive days of training prior to their first relapse test (day 1 relapse test).Abstinence (1- 400 days, see Figure 2B)In this phase, rats are kept in their home cages in the vivarium. They do not receive any additional training, and hence, do not have access to cocaine.Check on rats twice a week and ensure that they still have their bolts and I.V. blockers on their catheters.Handle rats to keep them socialized during long durations of abstinence. This can help to minimize handling-related stress during testing.Relapse to cocaine seeking test (1 x 3 h session on each test day with pseudorandomized presentation of 30 DS+ and 30 DS- trials, see Figures 2B and 2C)In this phase, we test rats for DS-controlled drug-seeking (i.e., responding on the lever that they previously associated with cocaine access, but while no drug is available during the session). The session format and trial spacing are the same as during discrimination training.Clean behavior boxes and set up the room in the same way as at the start of behavioral training (see Procedure C) but with the exceptions noted below. Turn off the syringe pumps and disconnect all syringes from their infusion lines.Ensure that all lines formerly used for drug delivery are cleared of any traces of drug by flushing first with D.I. water, then 100% ethanol, and finally with air through the line to clear traces of ethanol.\u00a0Load rats into individual operant boxes after weighing and mock intravenous gentamicin administration (follow the steps described in Post-Surgery Care, but do not infuse any gentamicin through the catheter). Perform only mock intravenous gentamicin administration during loading on relapse test days, as loss of catheter patency over time may cause flushing to become painful and thereby stress rats before the test.\u00a0Set up the MedPC program and start the behavioral session.\u00a0At the end of the session, disconnect each rat from its spring and infusion line, perform mock flush with 0.1 ml gentamicin and reattach the bolt and I.V. blocker to its catheter. Place each rat back in its homecage and return to the vivarium.Record the body weight of each rat, as well as the number of trials of each type in which an animal makes at least one response (\u201ctrials\u201d). Also record the number of lever responses made during each trial type per session (\u201clever presses\u201d). Plot these measures as the mean of all rats in the group each day.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBuilding brain implants\nTiming: 20\u201360\u00a0min\nThis step describes the construction of (1) a ground wire, (2) recording and stimulating electrodes, and (3) a cannula for local delivery of drugs. Stimulating and recording electrodes are identical except for the final cut (step 2.h). The implants described here can be modified to fit the specific experimental needs.\nPrepare a ground screw.\nCut 4\u00a0cm of stainless-steel wire.\nExpose 3\u00a0mm from both sides of the wire.\nSecure the wire tightly between your fingernails or a hemostat.\nPlace the wire 3\u00a0mm within fine tweezers and apply a small amount of pressure.\nRapidly pull the tweezers such that the protective sheet is removed from the edge of the wire.\nSolder one end of the wire to the head of the screw.\nPlace the screw on a table such that the shank is pointed upwards.\nSolder the tip of the wire to the edge of the head (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1379-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04.

Avoid circling the threads.Solder the wrapped wire at a point other than the first.\nMake sure that both the drive and threads of the screw are clear from tin (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nClean the screw from remnant soldering flux.\nLoop the free end of the wire around the tip of a thin tweezer. The loop should be big enough to surround a connector pin.\nSolder the looped end of the wire to a connector pin.\nHold the connector with helping hands or a secured tweezers such that the pins are freely accessible.\nPass the connector pin through the wire loop (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C)\nApply soldering flux and solder the wire to the pin.\nCut the excess length of the pin with a cutter. This reduces the amount of glue that will be used in the next step.\nCover the soldered pin with light curable glue and cure the glue. Use as little glue as possible to minimize mass and volume of the head construct.\nNote: Accurate soldering is more easily accomplished when only small amounts of soldering flux are applied with a fine (24\u201328G) needle.\nAlternatives: If only one recording electrode is to be implanted, we recommend using a 3-pin female connector for the recording electrode (two pins for the electrode wires and one pin for the ground screw; Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). If multiple recording electrodes are to be implanted, we recommend soldering one ground screw to a connector with multiple pins (one for each electrode) rather than preparing multiple ground screws.\nPrepare electrodes.\nCut 10\u00a0cm of stainless-steel wire.\nExpose 3\u00a0mm from both sides of the wire as in step 1.b.\nLoop the exposed ends of the wire as in step 1.d.Solder each end of the wire to adjacent pin connectors as in step 1.e. When bringing the second end of the wire in proximity to the second pin, make sure the wire is evenly bent throughout its length rather than folded at a single junction (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nTwist the connector relative to the farthest end of the loop to a thread pitch of \u223c0.5 (i.e., 1 complete turn every two mm).\nNote: Twisting the electrode can be done manually or with a magnetic stirrer (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). The number of twists can be approximated as the length of the wire [mm]/thread pitch.\nCover the pins and soldered wires with light curable glue as in step 1.f.\nBend the electrodes to 90\u00b0 twice: at 2- and 10-mm distance from the connector (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). This is so that during implantation the electrodes can be spread apart from one another (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]I). Use a table or other flat surface to assure right angles.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1379-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05.

The photograph in this panel depicts a mouse with three pairs of electrodes for simultaneous recordings of evoked responses from three different pathways. Note the metal head bar (dashed line) used for connecting the mouse to the head fixation apparatus. This construct weighs approximately 2.3 gr, measured as the difference in the animal\u2019s weight before and after the surgery. As a general guideline, head constructs should weigh no more than 10% of the total animal weight.\nCritical: Inserting the electrodes at a 90\u00b0 angle to the skull surface is crucial for reproducibility (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]; Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). This is mainly achieved by carefully aligning the electrodes to the manipulator during the surgical procedure (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F). Still, electrodes with round bends (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B) or bends other than 90\u00b0 (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C) are more\u00a0susceptible to deviate from the DV axis due to forces exerted by the brain during implantation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1379-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. Alignment of electrodes during implantation\n(A) An electrode bent properly. Note two sharp right angles (dashed lines).\n(B) An electrode bent improperly with a round bend. This may cause the electrode to deviate from the DV axis when penetrating the brain.\n(C) An electrode bent improperly. Although the electrode tip is parallel to the connector, the deviation from 90\u00b0 angles may cause the electrode to deviate during implantation.\n(D) Electrodes should be perpendicular to the bregma-lambda plane in both the AP and LM axes.(E) The line between the wire tips of the stimulating electrode should be perpendicular to the orientation of the axon bundle. If the orientation is unknown or disorganized, set the stimulating electrode such that the line between its wire tips is parallel to the interaural line. This default setting is arbitrary but may still help reduce variability between mice.\n(F) Alignment of electrodes during implantation should be done very patiently on all three axes.\nCut the end of the wires according to the electrode purpose.\nFor a recording electrode the cut should be 1\u00a0mm graded. This is achieved by cutting each wire individually (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nFor a stimulating electrode the cut should be straight. This is achieved by cutting both wires with a single cut.\nAlternatives: The wires of recording electrodes are graded so that during implantation one wire is positioned at the target site and one wire is positioned at a distant site inert to the stimulation. Using the SC synapse as an example, the wires should be positioned at CA1 stratum radiatum and the sensory cortex 1\u00a0mm dorsal to CA1 (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Alternatively, the ground screw described in step 1 may provide the reference potential for both wires such that two fEPSP signals are generated from one implant. This is common practice when recording from regions other than the hippocampus. In the hippocampus, the use of an inert wire as the reference typically produces cleaner signals mainly because noise is manifested similarly on conductors with identical properties.\nAlternatives: To reduce tissue damage during implantation, or if the target brain region is very small (e.g. midline thalamic nuclei; Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E) and/or very localized LFP events are of interest (e.g. hippocampal ripples), then a smaller diameter wire may be preferred (e.g. 790900 from A-M systems).Note: After an electrode is completed, measure resistance with a multimeter between the tip of each wire and the connector pins to make certain that conductance is exclusive to the appropriate pairs of wire and pin. For easy access to the connector and wire tips, connect a male connector to the female connector and attach rigid metal wires to the multimeter probes. This step cannot replace step 1 in the Prepare for surgery section.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1379-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07.

The surgery can be \u201cchronic\u201d, i.e., the animal is awakened and kept for future experiments, or \u201cacute\u201d, i.e., the experiment (e.g., injection of pharmaceuticals) is done during surgery while the animal is anesthetized.\nAnesthetize the mouse.\nPlace the mouse in a container connected to the isoflurane vaporizer and deliver 3% Isoflurane at a rate of 350\u00a0mL/min until the animal lies still in the container and the respiration rate becomes slow.\nMake sure that the animal is unresponsive by tipping the container.\nPlace the mouse on the stereotaxic instrument.\nSet the heating pad to 34\u00b0C and insert the rectal probe.\nInject i.p. the Ketamine/Xylazine solution.\nGradually reduce the concentration and flow rate of Isoflurane to 1% at 150\u00a0mL/min.\nCritical: Throughout the procedure, monitor the animal\u2019s anesthesia depth by occasionally testing the toe pinch reflex and observing its respiration rate.\nPrepare the mouse for incision of the scalp (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nFixate the head of the mouse to the stereotaxic instrument.\nInject s.c. the Carprofen solution.\nSpread eye protecting cream on the animal\u2019s eyes.\nRemove all hair from the scalp with scissors and/or hair removal cream.\nClean the surface of the scalp with povidone-iodine and wash with ethanol 70%.\nExpose the skull.\nMake an incision along the midline of the scalp from the area between the eyes to the back of the head with a scalpel or scissors.\nSpread both sides of the scalp with bulldog serrefines.Remove the aponeurosis and periosteum with a drop of 3% hydrogen peroxide and clean with PBS. You may also use the blunt end of a scalpel to make sure all connective tissue has been removed (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nPerform horizontal and vertical incisions to the skull with a scalpel without penetrating the skull. This strengthens the adherence of Metabond to the skull (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nMark implant coordinates.\nMeasure and log the anteroposterior (AP) distance between bregma and lambda. For adult (26\u201330 g) mice the distance should be 3.7\u20134.7\u00a0mm (Paxinos and Franklin, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nAlign the head on all three axes.\nFor pitch check that bregma and lambda are aligned in the dorsoventral (DV) axis.\nFor yaw check that bregma and lambda are aligned in the lateromedial (LM) axis.\nFor roll check that the DV height is identical\u00a0\u00b12.5\u00a0mm lateral to bregma.\nConnect a needle to the manipulator and mark the desired coordinates for all implants (electrodes, cannula/s, and ground screw). Do this by applying ink to the needle tip (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nNote: For convenience, we deposited in the accompanying GitHub repository a spreadsheet that can be used to align the skull and calculate distances relative to bregma (see resource availability[href=https://www.wicell.org#resource-availability]).\nPrepare craniotomies (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nHold the drill by hand or with a stereotaxic manipulator and slowly lower to the skull.\nGradually remove bits of skull by alternately lowering and retreating the drill. This prevents overheating of the skull.\nClean the skull with PBS.\nCover the craniotomies with Gelfoam soaked in PBS (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). This (1) coagulates the brain surface in case of bleeding, (2) maintains the brain tissue wet while the electrodes are mounted to the stereotaxic instrument, and (3) protects the craniotomies from the Metabond applied in step 11.Note: All implants described in this protocol fit best with a 0.7\u00a0mm diameter burr. Any modifications to the implants should also consider the burr size.\nNote: In mice, the dura is easily penetrated by both the electrodes and cannula. If the surgery is done on rats and/or the implants are modified to be less rigid (e.g. when using smaller diameter wires as electrodes), remove the dura with fine curved tweezers before step 8.d.\nInsert the ground electrode to the hole with a screwdriver. Leave a small gap between the screw head and the skull (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nImplant the cannula to its proper location (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G).\nConnect a small needle (e.g., 27 gauge) to the manipulator.\nPass the needle through the cannula until the tip of the needle almost emerges from the other side of the cannula. Glue the cannula in place with adhesive tape or plasticine.\nInsert the cannula into the brain until the proper coordinates are reached.\nCritical: Lowering an implant such as a cannula or electrodes into the brain must occur very slowly in order to minimize brain damage and dimpling; two major contributors to intra- and inter-subject variability (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], respectively). As a rule of thumb, we recommend advancing 300 um every 10\u00a0s and even slower as the target depth is approached.\nCritical: Validate the length of the cannula before implantation. This measurement will be used during the experiment to direct the syringe needle precisely through the cannula (step 20.b).\nSecure the cannula and ground screw with Metabond (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]H). Be careful not to cover any other craniotomies (e.g., for the electrodes). If Metabond reaches other craniotomies, remove the Gelfoam from the craniotomies before the Metabond cures and cover the craniotomies with a small drop of PBS.Critical: For maximal adherence to occur, make sure that the skull is completely dry before applying Metabond.\nNote: Most stereotaxic instruments allow the control of two manipulators. Thus, only two devices can be implanted simultaneously since they must be secured with Metabond to the skull before they are released from the stereotaxic manipulator. If multiple electrodes and/or cannulas are to be implanted, plan in advance the order of implantations such that Metabond is applied as few times as possible. For example, if only two electrodes and a ground screw are implanted, Metabond can be applied only once after positioning of the electrodes (step 14).\nNote: Most brain atlases provide DV coordinates starting from the skull surface at bregma. From our experience, calibrating depth coordinates from the brain (pia) surface reduces variability, especially for brain regions positioned laterally.\nCritical: We highly recommend performing histological verification of the implants\u2019 position after sacrificing the animal (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]; Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). To enhance the detection of the electrodes in a histological slice, dip the electrodes in a cell labeling solution (e.g. Vybrant CM-Dil by Invitrogen) prior to implantation (step 12).\nPause point: Take a break for 15\u201320\u00a0min while the Metabond is being cured. Do not be tempted to touch the implants even if the outer surface of the Metabond appears dry (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nInsert the electrodes to the brain.\nConnect the electrodes to the electrophysiological setup. Make sure the cables are long enough to permit free movement of the electrodes.\nMount the recording and stimulating electrodes on manipulators.\nMove the electrodes towards their holes and manually adjust their alignment.\nBoth electrodes are perpendicular to the bregma-lambda plane in both the AP and LM axes (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).The line between the wire tips of the stimulating electrode is perpendicular to the direction of axon travel (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nThe recording and stimulating electrodes are spaciously positioned such that they will not collide during implantation (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F).\nInsert the electrodes 200\u2013300 um into the brain.\nCritical: If the target region involves midline structures (e.g. thalamic nuclei), the implants must be inserted in an angle to prevent puncturing of the sagittal sinus. This should be done by adjusting the angle of the manipulator. Do not bend the electrodes to the desired angle as this will not hold true during implantation.\nSearch for an evoked response.\nLower the stimulating electrode 0.5\u00a0mm above the target depth.\nStart recording while delivering a medium (0.04\u20130.1 mA) intensity stimulus at 0.5\u00a0Hz.\nLower the recording electrode to 0.5\u00a0mm above the target depth.\nLower the stimulating and recording electrode one at a time in graduations of 0.05\u00a0mm until the \u201cbest\u201d signal is achieved (see CRITICAL remark below and troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).Critical: The evoked response of commonly investigated pathways (e.g. the SC) frequently exhibit characteristic waveforms which can be used to determine that the electrodes are in their proper position (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A). Specifically, four main parameters should be inspected while searching for a signal (step 13): (1) the delay of the response relative to stimulus onset, (2) the presence of STP (facilitation versus depression, depending on the frequency of stimuli and the type of synapse under investigation), (3) the waveform shape, and (4) the amplitude. For novel pathways, the main indication that the target has been reached is the evoked response amplitude. However, since a large response can be achieved by accidently recording other pathways, we recommend not to deviate from the DV coordinates by more than 500 um even if it produces larger response amplitudes.\nNote: All pathways investigated in our lab displayed some degree of synaptic facilitation when an STP protocol was applied (Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A). If synaptic facilitation is to be expected, STP protocols during implantations may serve as another indication that the target regions have been reached.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1379-Fig8.jpg\nFigure\u00a08. Representative fEPSP recordings for investigating short-term plasticity and its modulation by stimulus frequency and intensity\n(A) Traces of fEPSP recordings in response to a train of five stimuli delivered at various frequencies. Red \u2013 10\u00a0Hz; blue \u2013 20\u00a0Hz; green \u2013 50\u00a0Hz). Each trace is the average of 10 repetitions delivered with a 30\u00a0s inter-burst interval.(B) Quantification of short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is typically done by measuring the slope of each response and normalizing it to the slope of the first response. Synaptic facilitation is defined as a ratio greater than one and synaptic depression is defined as a ratio smaller than one. In the SC synapse, a train of stimuli at 20\u00a0Hz and 50\u00a0Hz typically elicits synaptic facilitation to a greater extent than a train of stimuli at 10\u00a0Hz.\n(C) Quantification of synaptic facilitation in response to various stimulus intensities (50\u00a0Hz burst).

Error bars represent SEM.\nOnce the desired signal is achieved, check stability of the signal by delivering a stimulus every 20\u00a0s for 5\u201310\u00a0min.\nPause point: Take a break for 5\u201310\u00a0min.\nNote: If an acute experiment is preferred, continue with the stimulation for 30\u00a0min or until a stable signal is achieved (i.e. the evoked response amplitude remains constant for at least 5\u00a0min; Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B). Afterwards, continue with the experiment according to the guidelines detailed in the experiment[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] section. Note that acute surgeries typically take > 5 hours and thus require that the animal be sacrificed at the end of the experiment.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1379-Fig9.jpg\nFigure\u00a09. fEPSP recordings of the SC in response to pharmacogenetic/pharmacological manipulation\n(A) Pharmacogenetic manipulation of CA1 pyramidal cells.

During this time the surgeon should check the animal\u2019s wellbeing twice a day and log its recovery.\nExperiment\nTiming: 1\u20134\u00a0h daily, for 7\u00a0days up to 6\u00a0monthsThis major step describes the conduction of experiments in mice implanted with fEPSP electrodes and a cannula. Here we focus on studying pharmacological agents but the general procedure can be easily expanded to a wide variety of other manipulations and/or behavioral settings. Before attempting any manipulations (step 20), we insist that the experimenter achieve stable baseline recordings for several consecutive days (step 19). Although the data acquired during this time is typically not reported, a stable baseline provides invaluable confidence when later trying to interpret the experimental results (See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPerform baseline recordings.\nConnect the mouse to the electrophysiological setup.\nPlace the mouse in the experimental arena (open field, home cage, etc.)\nCharacterize the I/O curve (see the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section).\nAnalyze the I/O curve with the MATLAB analysis package provided in this study.\nBased on the I/O curve, select 1\u20133 stimulus intensities for STP recordings.\nNote: The head fixation apparatus can be used during recordings to minimize movement artifacts (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) and variability in arousal state (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). However, if the head fixation apparatus is to be used during recordings, the animal must be accustomed to the apparatus several days before starting the recording sessions.\nNote: The overall number of stimulations per day should be limited to avoid long term plasticity effects (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Thus, to minimize the amount of stimulations while retaining enough repetitions for statistical analysis, we recommend fully characterizing the I/O curve only 2\u20133 times a week (e.g. at the beginning of the baseline period, one day before the perturbation and immediately after the perturbation). Daily measurements should include only 3\u20135 stimulus intensities selected as representatives of the full I/O curve.\nPerform the experiment.\nPerform a recording session as in step 19.Apply a sham (e.g., saline injection) or true manipulation (e.g., drug injection; Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]E and\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPrepare the syringe and drug delivery system with the desired solution (see the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] session).\nPosition the head fixation apparatus near the stereotaxic instrument and connect the animal.\nUsing the stereotaxic manipulator, direct the syringe towards the cannula opening.\nSlowly lower the syringe to a depth precisely equal to the cannula length.\nInject the solution and log in a notebook the volume, delivery rate, and time of injection.\nWait 10\u201320\u00a0min after the injection has been completed and before the needle is removed. This allows sufficient time for the drug to diffuse and minimizes the risk that pulling the needle will cause back propagation of the drug (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nSlowly raise the needle until it exits the cannula.\nRelease the animal back to its home cage.\nWait as much time as needed for the drug to produce its expected effect (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]) and perform another recording session.\nCritical: Before and after every injection with an electrical pump, we recommend releasing a small volume (100\u2013500 nL) of drug outside of the brain to make sure the needle is not clogged (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nAlternatives: If long term effects of the manipulation are of interest, we recommend performing a recording session once a day at the same time of day and comparing the data between days rather than comparing the data between two recording sessions of the same day. This increases statistical power since it allows for several days to be averaged and it also prevents differences between the first and second sessions that are due to the circadian rhythm (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1379-Fig10.jpg\nFigure\u00a010. fEPSP recordings of the SC in response to behavioral interventions.(A\u2013C) Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) increased synaptic transmission of the SC. In sum, mice were individually placed in an arena three times in two consecutive days. On the first day, after two min in the arena the mice received two 1 mA electric shocks 80\u00a0s apart through a metal grid placed on the floor. This typically causes the animal to associate the context (visual and olfactory cues of the arena) with an aversive stimulus (the electric shock). During the second day, mice were placed in the arena with the same contextual cues but no electric shock was delivered. Four hours later, the visual and olfactory cues were altered to represent a novel context and the mice were placed again in the arena for 2.5\u00a0min without an electric shock. The percent of time spent without movement (freezing) serves as a measurement for the association of the context with the electric shock (Curzon et\u00a0al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). fEPSP measurements were taken from head-fixed animals three times a day, two hr before and after the onset of behavioral experiments. Data presented is from 15 mice. (A) Percent freezing after CFC (orange) was significantly greater than before CFC (gray) in the same context (comparison of the behavioral session on day 1 with the first behavioral session on day 2). (B) Percent freezing in the context of the electrical shock (gray) was significantly greater than in a novel context (orange; comparison of the two behavioral sessions on day 2). (C) The I/O curve of the SC after CFC (red) was significantly greater than before CFC (blue). For each mouse, the average I/O curve from all sessions was used to normalize the I/O curve of a single session.For each session, the I/O curve was generated by five stimulus currents linearly spaced between values that elicit a minimal and maximal response. A significant difference in the evoked response amplitudes between the two recording times was found by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures (p\u00a0< 0.0001). This is in accordance with previous findings (Subramaniyan et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) and implies that fear conditioning induced LTP of the SC. Error bars represent SEM.(D) The I/O curve of the SC from 13 mice was significantly greater eight (8 ZT; blue) compared to two (2 ZT; black) hours into the light phase. I/O curves were generated and normalized as in (C). This effect of the circadian rhythm on neural excitability is in accordance with previous findings (Herzog, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).

The euthanasia steps are critical to prevent any lung hemorrhage and alveoli breakage caused by a high flow rate of CO2.\nLung insufflation (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). 10\u201330\u00a0min.\nSet up the insufflation apparatus using a 20\u00a0mL syringe connected to a 35\u00a0mL Extension Set Priming Volume, DEHP-Free and Latex-Free Male and Female luer locks with Slide Clamp to monitor PBS volume and flow rate.\nConsistency of insufflation of the lungs to the right size without under or over insufflation with PBS (approximately volume per lung 0.75\u20131.0\u00a0mL).\nSpray the mice with 70% alcohol before placing them in the tissue culture hood for lung extraction.\nA mid-transverse skin incision is made at the mid-abdominal area and the skin should be pulled over in opposite directions (cranial-caudal) to expose the thoracic and abdominal cavities.\nMake an incision on the ventral midabdominal line alba close to the xiphoid process, then follow with an incision into the abdominal cavity to expose the mouse diaphragm.\nCut into the mouse diaphragm without lacerating the lungs.Make a bilateral incision along the sternum to the first rib cage.\nPull the sternum cranially to expose the trachea.\nCanulate the trachea at the intercartilaginous ligament with a 20G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u2033 IV Angio-catheter approximately 1/2 inch.\nRemove the stylet needle and advance the catheter.\nPlace a single loose suture with 2-0 Vicryl underneath the proximal trachea and leave the suture loose.\nConnect the extension IV set primed with PBS into the IV catheter and hold it in place.\nNote: the lungs will be expanded approximately 30\u201345 seconds after insufflation is completed.\nLock the IV set with the slide clamp.\nSlightly pull IV catheter.\nGently tie up the distal trachea with 2-0 Vicryl suture without rupturing it to avoid any leakage of insufflated PBS.\nNote: This will prevent the mouse lung from collapsing.\nDissect the mouse lungs surgically.\nCut the trachea distally without compromising the suture on the trachea.\nUse the trachea or hold the mouse heart with a thumb dressing forceps to dissect the lungs out using straight iris scissors.\nCut the lung mediastinal ligamentum.\nCut the attachment of the diaphragm that connects to the mouse liver and gently remove the lungs.\nPlace and rinse the mouse lung in cold PBS for 30\u201345\u00a0s to get rid of any blood debris.\nThe lungs (L1, L2. L3, L4, L5) are then immediately transferred into a 50\u00a0mL conical tube containing 35\u00a0mL PBS at 4\u00b0C supplemented with penicillin 100\u00a0U/mL/streptomycin 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for surface fluoresce microscopy imaging on a Leica DM IRB Widefield Fluorescence Microscope equipped with a filter set appropriate for imaging green fluorescent protein (GFP).Note: Each mouse lung was imaged one time only per each time point at 1 h, 6 h, and 24\u00a0h by taking 10 random surface fluorescent pictures of each single mouse lung (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5) using Improvision's Openlab 3.1 scientific image acquisition software, then all lung pictures were saved until ready to be analyzed and quantified. In addition, Improvision's Openlab 3.1 scientific image acquisition software was programmed to read and analyze each event at a size of 10 photons or greater, any event smaller than 10 photons was not read or analyzed; this was considered an artifact or background noise (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAfter imaging each timepoint (1 h, 6 h, 24 h), place all five lungs in a 50\u00a0mL conical tube filled with 35\u00a0mL of 10% formaldehyde buffered for H&E analysis.\nImages analysis.\nUse Improvision's Openlab 3.1 scientific image acquisition software to analyze and quantify the total sum of the surface fluorescent area in the 10 images of each single mouse lung (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5) per timepoint.\nUse Microsoft Excel to graph the average number of all five-lung surface fluorescent events (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5) at 1 h, 6 h, 24 h.\nSubtract the average number of each timepoint at 6 h, 24\u00a0hr from the average baseline number at 1\u00a0h timepoint.\nNote: Quantification of lung fluorescent events was validated using both enumeration of surface fluorescent event counts and mean fluorescent area.Statistical analysis: Nonparametric t-test and ANOVA were used for image analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software). The percent metastatic survival is determined by normalizing the mean number of cells at 6\u00a0h or 24\u00a0h with the mean number of cells at 1\u00a0h for each mouse lung (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).

Store at 4 \u00b0C until the day of isolation.\nStabilizing platform creation: Mold playdough around the base of the needle screwed into the Luer stopcock. Mold to the Petri dish that will contain the heart and ensure that the needle is at proper height for ventricle injection (~5 mm above bottom of dish).\nThe day of isolation\n\t\nPerfusion buffer: On the day of the isolation, add 9.5 mg of MgCl2 to 100 mL of perfusion buffer base. Allow to mix completely before removing 30 mL of completed perfusion buffer and place in a clean, wide-mouth, 100 mL glass bottle with a screw cap lid (digestion buffer).\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: These additions can be made on the day of isolation without additional pH adjustments as their addition negligibly alters the pH.\n\t\t\nRemove 12 mL of perfusion buffer and set to the side (stop buffer). Pour the remaining 58 mL of perfusion buffer into another clean, wide-mouth, 100 mL glass bottle with a screw cap lid. Store the remaining perfusion buffer at 37 \u00b0C throughout isolation.Digestion buffer: Add 7.5 \u00b5L of 100 mM CaCl2 to 30 mL of perfusion buffer for a final concentration of 25 \u00b5M. Immediately prior to the isolation, add 770 \u00b5L of Liberase to the digestion buffer for a final concentration of 26 \u00b5g/mL.\nStop buffer: Dissolve 240 mg of BSA in 12 mL of perfusion buffer. Store at 37 \u00b0C throughout isolation.\nClearing buffer: Prepare a 3 mL syringe of clearing buffer and clear the needle of bubbles. Store on ice until isolation.\n2. Manifold preparation\nClear the temperature-controlled manifold with freshly prepared perfusion buffer, being careful to ensure no bubbles remain. Using a Luer lock connector, screw in a 27 G needle, and clear of bubbles. A cleared manifold is essential for a successful isolation.\n3. Animal preparation\nInject the mouse intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 20 mg/kg xylazine by body weight immediately prior to the isolation. This procedure used a male, 4-month-old C57Bl/6 mouse.\nIf needed, place the mouse on a heated surgical pad to encourage sedation. Tent the arms of the mouse, and tape the limbs and base of the tail to a blue lab diaper. Ensure that the animal is fully anesthetized\u00a0by the withdrawal of\u00a0toe-pinch reflex. Apply a sterile drape around the surgical area.\n4. Cardiomyocyte isolation procedure\nExpose the sternum of the mouse and, lateral to the midline, cut proximally through the ribs and to the axilla. Gently cut fully through the diaphragm, ensuring shallow cuts to avoid the heart. Clamp the sternum with a hemostat and fold the ribs backwards to expose the thoracic cavity.Gently remove the pericardium from the heart and cut fully through the inferior vena cava, immediately distal to the heart. Use a 3 mL syringe with a 27 G needle to quickly inject 3 mL of ice-cold clearing buffer into the right ventricle of the heart over 1 min.\nGently hold the heart using tweezers and pull away from the body, exposing as much of the aorta as possible. Using a hemostat, clamp the ascending aorta, being careful not to clamp the atria, and excise the heart from the chest.\nQuickly transfer the clamped heart to the lid of a polypropylene Petri dish with approximately 10 mL of warm perfusion buffer. Place the clamped heart into the supporting platform and use a stabilized 27 G needle attached to the manifold to inject 10 mL of temperature-controlled 37 \u00b0C perfusion buffer into the left ventricle over 5 min.\nTransfer the clamped heart and supporting platform to a Petri dish with approximately 5 mL of digestion buffer. Exchange input syringes for a 50 mL syringe with 25 mL of digestion buffer.\nClear the manifold of any bubbles and remaining perfusion buffer before injection. Carefully replace the needle into the same needle position in the left ventricular apex.\nUse a perfusion pump to inject temperature-controlled 37 \u00b0C digestion buffer into the left ventricle for 15 min using a 50 mL syringe. Control the temperature of the solution with a water jacket previously calibrated to eject 37 \u00b0C solution at the end of the needle.Remove the ventricles from the atria and transfer to a 10 mL beaker. Add 3 mL of digestion buffer to the beaker and, using sharp scissors, cut the ventricles into large chunks. Cover the beaker with aluminum foil and place in a shaking water bath preheated to 37 \u00b0C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, being careful to avoid removing any chunks of tissue. Resuspend the tissue chunks in 3 mL of digestion buffer and triturate for approximately 4 min or until a homogenous mixture is achieved.\nFilter the cells through a 70 \u00b5m nylon cell strainer into a 50 mL polypropylene tube.\nReturn the filtrate to a 14 mL round-bottom polypropylene tube and centrifuge for 1 min at 100 rpm. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of stop buffer.\nAdd 54 \u00b5L of 100 mM CaCl2 stock to the resuspended cells for a final CaCl2 concentration of 1.8 mM. This step can also be performed stepwise to increase cell yield.\nAllow live cells to settle by gravity for 10 min before removing the supernatant containing dead cells. Resuspend the pellet in storage solution (perfusion solution with 200 \u00b5M CaCl2). These cells can now be used for functional experiments (i.e., calcium imaging/contraction, patch clamp, etc.), culture, etc.\n\t\u200bNOTE: The cells may also be resuspended in lab- or experiment-dependent solutions.\n5. Cell culture\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer or by a field view count using a gridded cover slip. As myocytes are very large, counting using a hemocytometer is not always accurate. This is used to get an idea of approximately how many cells were obtained from the isolation.\nDilute the cells to ~25,000 cells/mL with DMEM media. Add 1 mL of cell solution to each well.Incubate at 37 \u00b0C, 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 2 h.\nGently aspirate DMEM media from each well and add 2 mL of M199 media.\nIncubate at 37 \u00b0C, 95% O2, 5% CO2 for up to 24 h.\nSubscription Required.

Pinch the toes to check if the animal is fully asleep then decapitate the mouse.Quickly and carefully remove cochleae from skull and put them in a Petri dish as follow:Cut the mouse head in half.Remove brain.Hold head on side so the 'bowl' of the skull is facing up.The temporal bone is in the back and is not continuous to the skull (there are many small bones attaching it to the skull).Push in the junctions between the skull and the temporal bone (away from the cochlea area) to break it away from skull.Carefully dissect extraneous bones away from the cochlea.The following video by Parker et al. (2010) shows, between min 3 and 4, how to dissect the temporal bone (cochlea) from a P3-5 mouse. The same procedure is done for an older mouse, but the only difference is the bone cochlea becomes harder. http://www.jove.com/video/1685/primary-culture-plasmid-electroporation-murine-organUse a syringe to push approximately 0.5 ml of ice cold 4% PFA-PB through the round and oval windows (RW and OW) after having made a small hole in the apex of the cochlea (for orientation refer to the whole cochlea picture with legends in Figure 1 (Glen et al., 2008)).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130213/20130213194703_5186.jpgFigure 1.

In this protocol, tissue blocks were mounted onto the chuck in the coronal plane.\n\t\tNOTE: Trim excess OCT from the tissue, using a razor blade, to minimize the amount of OCT being cut by the cryostat and subsequently transferred onto the glass slide.\nCut 14 \u00b5m thick coronal sections and mount them onto charged glass microscopy slides.\n\t\t\nWarm the slides to room temperature before mounting the sections. Once the section has been mounted, keep the slides in a slide box in the cryostat.\nIf more than one section needs to be mounted on one slide, warm the area for the second section by placing a finger on the opposite side of the slide for 5-10 seconds to aid adherence of the section to the slide. A cold tissue section will not attach to a cold slide. The sections should adhere to the slides flat; folding will cause them to fall off the slides during wash steps.\nIf cracks are noticed in the sections, increase the cryostat temperature by 1-5 \u00b0C to avoid this. It is particularly important to place tissue sections in close proximity to one another on the same slide. This will prevent wastage of FISH probes and reagents during the assay.\nStore tissue sections mounted onto glass slides in an air-tight container at -80 \u00b0C for up to 6 months.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the sections frozen at all times and avoid freeze thaw cycles, to prevent RNA degradation. Transport the slide box from inside the cryostat to the -80 \u00b0C freezer on dry ice.\nFixation of fresh frozen tissueOn the day the FISH probe assay is to be performed, prepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.5 (4% PFA solution). Filter by passing through filter paper (Grade 1: 11 \u00b5m, Table of Materials) in a Buchner funnel or crucible filter.\n\t\tCAUTION : PFA is harmful and toxic by skin contact or inhalation. All procedures with PFA solution should be performed in a fume hood cabinet. PFA solution waste should be disposed of carefully following institutional safety protocols.\nCool the 4% PFA solution to 4 \u00b0C. Transport the slide-mounted tissue from the -80 \u00b0C freezer in dry ice and immediately immerse it in the pre-chilled fixative for 15 minutes.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that this fixation step does not exceed 15 minutes as over-fixation will result in non-specific background labelling.\nDehydration of fresh frozen tissue\n\t\nDehydrate tissue sections by submerging the slides in graded concentrations of ethanol. In a Coplin jar, first submerge in 50%, then 70% and finally absolute ethanol, for 5 minutes each at room temperature. Repeat the final absolute ethanol incubation a second time.\nAir dry slides and, outline the group of sections using a hydrophobic barrier pen, ensuring that the internal area is kept to a minimum.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the glass slide is completely dry before drawing the hydrophobic barrier. The hydrophobic barrier should surround the tissue sections completely without gaps and must be dry before further processing.\n2. Sample preparation of fixed frozen brain tissue\nTranscardial perfusion fixation\n\t\nEuthanize mice by anesthetizing with sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg, i.p) followed by transcardial perfusion, first with 0.1 M PB then 4% PFA solution. Fix with 10 minutes of perfusion at 11-13 mL/min.\nIsolate the brain from the skull cavity following perfusion-fixation and submerge overnight in 4% PFA solution, at 4 \u00b0C.Tissue sectioning of fixed tissue\n\t\nRinse the brain in sterile 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before removing the meningeal layers, with the aid of a dissecting microscope, using fine forceps.\nCut the brain precisely into blocks (separate the brainstem from the forebrain prior to vibratome sectioning) using a brain matrix (Table of Materials). Specifically, cut the brainstem caudally at the pyramidal decussation and dissect away the cerebellum. Similarly, cut the forebrain immediately rostral to the optic chiasm.\nSecure the tissue onto a vibrating microtome chuck using cyanoacrylate and embed in 2% agar solution.\nCut 30 \u00b5m thick tissue sections using a vibrating microtome and store cut sections in cryoprotectant solution (30% RNase free sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40),\u00a0in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4). Tissue sections may be stored in cryoprotectant at -20 \u00b0C for up to 6 months.\nPreparation of fixed sections prior to FISH\n\t\nOn the day of FISH, wash free floating sections three times, for 10 minutes per wash, to remove the cryoprotectant solution. To wash, place sections in 0.1 M PBS in a 12 well cell culture plate and agitate on a rotating platform shaker (90 - 100 rpm).\nAfter washes, use a paintbrush to mount sections on glass microscopy slides and air dry for at least 2 hours.\n\t\tNOTE: The sections should adhere flat onto the slides as any pronounced folds will cause them to detach during washes.\nUsing a hydrophobic barrier pen, draw a barrier around the sections to restrict the FISH reagents to the sections. Once more, it is important to minimize the internal area of the outline drawn with the barrier pen.\n\t\t\u200bPOSSIBLE BREAK POINT: The sections could be stored at room temperature, overnight, to continue the assay the next day.\n3. FISH assayNOTE: The rest of the protocol applies to both fresh frozen and fixed frozen tissue.\nPrepare the reagents and instruments for hybridization and amplification steps.\n\t\nSet a benchtop incubator and water bath to 40 \u00b0C.\nPrepare a humidified, light-protected chamber for incubating slides. Humidification prevents drying of tissues - slides are securely located above a moist reservoir. Ideally, the chamber is made of heavy-duty polystyrene, it is light-proof and airtight to maintain a saturated water vapor atmosphere. Closure of the chamber relies on minimal friction to avoid movement. We used a slide box lined with wet laboratory wipes (Table of Materials) at the bottom. Place the slide box inside the incubator to prewarm it to 40 \u00b0C.\nWarm the 50x Wash Buffer (Table of Materials) and probes to 40 \u00b0C for 10 minutes, using the water bath, then cool to room temperature.\nPrepare 1 L of 1x Wash Buffer from the 50x stock concentration.\nPrepare probe mixture (Table of Materials): the C1 probe is ready to use at stock concentration whereas C2 and C3 probes are shipped as 50x concentration and require dilution with the diluent supplied in the kit.\n\t\tNOTE: Probe mixtures can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 6 months.\nProtease treatment\n\t\nIncubate sections with Protease III (Table of Materials) at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that Protease III and incubation reagents in downstream processes (probe mixture, amplification solutions, blocking buffer and antibody sera) cover the sections entirely. A pipet tip may be used to spread the reagent onto the section to cover the entire area inside the hydrophobic barrier.Wash slides twice with 0.1 M PBS, for 2 min each time, in\u00a0a large plastic square Petri dish. Here a 245 mm x 245 mm square bioassay dish was used (Table of Materials). Hold from one side of the dish and tilt gently 3-5 times. After washes, flick excess 0.1 M PBS from slide and immediately add the next reagent. Do not let tissue sections dry.\n\t\tNOTE: During each wash, the slides are immersed in solution at room temperature. This is the workflow for all subsequent wash steps. The fixed 30 \u00b5m thick sections dislodge from slides more easily than 14 \u00b5m thick sections, be gentle during the washes.\nHybridization and amplification\n\t\nAfter washing off the protease solution, place the slides in the humidified, prewarmed chamber. Incubate sections with probe mixture (Table of Materials) for 2 hours at 40 \u00b0C inside a benchtop incubator.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: Ensure there are at least 2 sections set aside for positive and negative control probes to assess sample RNA quality and optimal permeabilization. Positive control probes target house-keeping genes; here, these were a\u00a0cocktail of RNAs targeting ubiquitin C (UBC; high-abundance), peptidylpropyl isomerase B (PPIB; moderate-abundance) and RNA polymerase 2a (POLR2A; low-abundance). Negative control probes target the bacterial 4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate reductase (DapB) gene, which is normally absent in mouse brain samples. Positive DapB signal indicates non-specific signal and/or bacterial contamination of the sample.\nFollowing hybridization with the probe mixture, the signal amplification steps consist of incubation with Amp 1-FL (30 minutes), then with Amp 2-FL (15 minutes), followed by Amp 3-FL (30 minutes) and finally Amp 4-FL (15 minutes) - each at 40 \u00b0C. Using the dropper bottles provided, cover tissue sections with amplification solution. Proceed to IHC assay following the last amplification step.Rinse slides with Wash Buffer twice for 2 minutes between probe hybridization and each amplification step.\n4. IHC Assay\nIHC blocking step\n\t\nTo prevent non-specific binding of antibodies, incubate the sections for 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution containing 10% normal horse serum, 0.3% Tween20 in 1x TBSm (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% merthiolate) following the FISH assay. Prepare primary antibodies in a dilution buffer containing 1x TBSm, 5% normal horse serum and 0.1% Tween20. Primary antibody suppliers are listed in the Table of Materials.\nImmunohistochemistry\n\t\nRemove excess blocking buffer by flicking the slide and incubate sections with primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\nWash slides 3 times (5 minutes each) with 1x TBSm and incubate with secondary antibody in diluent containing 1x TBSm, 1% normal horse serum and 0.1% Tween20 for 2 hours at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used in this protocol are listed in the Table of Materials.\nWash slides 3 times with 1x TBSm (5 minutes each) before coverslipping with mounting medium with or without DAPI (Table of Materials).\n5. Imaging\nExamine immunostaining under an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a camera (see Table of Material for details). Acquire representative images at 20x magnification and save as TIFF files.\nExport representative images into an image processing software (Table of Materials) for brightness/contrast adjustment to increase the clarity and to reflect true rendering.\n6. OPTIONAL: Quantitative analysis of target transcripts\nNOTE: This is a methods article and quantitative results are not provided. The method of quantification presented here is sourced from Dereli et al.10.\nAcquire images from the regions of interest as explained in 5.1 and apply the same microscope and camera settings (such as exposure time and light intensity) to all images of the same fluorophore.Plot the neuronal profiles using an image analysis software (Table of Materials).\nAlign the sections with reference to Bregma level according to a stereotaxic brain atlas13.\nApply the same brightness and contrast to all the images of the same fluorophore. Only consider the neurons with DAPI-stained nuclei.\nManually count the number of mRNA, protein expressing, mRNA/mRNA, protein/protein and mRNA/protein coexpressing cells within the region of interest.\nTo decrease bias in the experimental results, have the person quantifying experimental outcomes blinded to the experimental groups.\nApply Abercrombie correction14 to total cell counts by using the following Abercombie equation:\n\tCorrected cell count = manual cell count x section thickness / (section thickness + nuclear size)\n\tFor example, for 14 \u00b5m thick sections, the average nuclear width is calculated to be 7.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m and average section thickness is 14 \u00b1 1 \u00b5m based on 30 cells and 10 sections respectively in 5 animals10. According to the Abercrombie equation, corrected cell count would be manual cell count x 14/(14+7.7).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61709/61709fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Parallel workflow of tissue pre-processing steps for both fresh-frozen and paraformaldehyde fixed tissue.

Following tissue pre-processing, the slide mounted tissue is encircled using a hydrophobic barrier pen, as seen in the first frame, and incubated in a protease solution at room temperature. Following washes, tissue is transferred to a benchtop incubator for hybridization for 2 hours before sequential amplification steps. The in situ hybridization system utilizes a proprietary 'Z probe' design, preamplifiers and amplifiers as seen in frames 3-66.

Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "This protocol describes methods for decellularizing, washing, and storing extracellular matrix scaffolds derived from apple tissue. Because the numerous washes in this protocol are time-consuming, it can be advantageous to make scaffolds in bulk and store them until use. At the end of this protocol, scaffolds should be rigid and translucent-white, not soft or oxidized (yellow-orange).\nThis protocol is described for a large but manageable batch of 20 apple slices, with each slice being used to prepare a single scaffold plate later in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002]. Details are provided for adjusting the protocol for more or fewer slices. The \u201cwash, sterilize, and store slices\u201d section can be carried out several times in one day by starting batches at 15-min intervals, so that transfers between washes are staggered and done continuously. To keep track of wash steps and incubation times, it is recommended to create a table of steps and fill it in as the steps are carried out. For additional details, see Critical Parameters.\nCAUTION: Extreme care should be taken when manipulating large volumes of ethanol, as they are a significant fire hazard. Ethanol should be kept away from fire and heat sources. Flame-sterilized forceps should be totally cooled before any contact with ethanol.\nCAUTION: Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) should be kept away from heat and manipulated with appropriate personal protective equipment as it is flammable and causes irritation. SDS solution is also slippery. All working areas, shaking platforms, and flasks should be wiped clean of any spill to prevent falls.\nMaterials\nFresh MacIntosh apples (Malus domestica \u2018MacIntosh\u2019)\n0.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Fisher Bioreagents, cat. no. BP166500) in deionized water\nDeionized water\n100% ethanol and 70% (v/v) ethanol in deionized water\nMandolin slicer\n4-cm-diameter round steel cookie cutter\n4-L glass wide-mouth Erlenmeyer flasks, sterile\nAluminum foil\nShaking platformStainless steel offset broad flat-tip forceps (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 16-100-116), sterile\nSterile sample bags (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 01-812-201)\nVacuum sealer\nDay 1: Cut and decellularize slices\nNOTE: Complete these steps as quickly as possible, as prolonged exposure to air increases the risk of scaffold oxidation. Manipulate apples and slices with gloves, as contact with human skin also speeds up oxidation.\n1. Make 3-mm-thick slices parallel to the core from two or three Macintosh apples using a mandolin slicer.\nThis will usually yield \u223c20 usable slices depending on the shape of the apples. The chosen thickness of 3 mm allows C. elegans to navigate the habitat freely in all spatial dimensions. The thickness can be adjusted, however, for different uses. Thinner slices increase visibility through the scaffold, whereas thicker scaffolds can host more animals. If thickness is changed, Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002] may need to be fine-tuned (also see Critical Parameters).\n2. Cut out circles of hypanthium tissue from the slices using a round cookie cutter with a 4-cm diameter. Discard skin and slices containing ovary core.\nA 4-cm-diameter circle is used to create an environment that is as similar as possible to a standard agar plate for C. elegans culture, but slices can be cut to any shape for other uses. As the risk of contamination increases through the steps, it is preferable to cut slices to the desired shape at this step rather than later.\n3. Immediately soak slices in 2 L of 0.5% (w/v) SDS in a sterile 4-L glass wide-mouth Erlenmeyer flask. Cover the mouth of the flask with aluminum foil to prevent introduction of debris and leave overnight (12-24 hr) at room temperature on a shaking platform at 125 rpm.Wide-mouth flasks facilitate transfer between flasks in later steps. Because slices float, a large flask with a relatively small volume of liquid is recommended to maximize surface area.\nFor a different number of slices, maintain a ratio of ten slices per liter of liquid and use a flask size that will accommodate the large volume of foam produced by shaking the SDS solution (\u223c1 L foam for 2 L solution). For different volumes, flask numbers, or flask sizes, adjust the speed of the shaking platform so that slices do not stay overlaid or clumped together while also avoiding spillage. If possible, set the shaking platform to reverse every 45 min to prevent clumps and free slices that have stuck to the sides of the flask. If several flasks are used, but only one shaking platform is available, position the flasks on the platform so as to keep track of batch identification, as markings or tape labels come off when cleaning.\nDay 2: Wash, sterilize, and store slices\n4. Add 2 L deionized water to a new sterile 4-L flask and transfer scaffolds to this flask. To do this, pour the liquid content of the flask into a waste container while using forceps (sterilized by flaming, but totally cooled) to catch the decellularized slices as they flow out of the flask and transfer them to the new flask.\nOffset broad flat-tip forceps are favored for scaffold manipulation throughout, as they minimize damage to the matrix and skin contact with solutions during transfer. Scaffolds should be grasped delicately, as squeezing them too hard with forceps can break them. Forceps should be sterilized between batches to prevent introduction of contaminants.\nCold or room-temperature deionized water should be used for washes, as warm water will damage scaffold integrity.Scaffolds should stay rigid and translucent-white, not soft or oxidized (yellow-orange), from this point on and throughout Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002]. If they are not rigid and translucent-white, they should be discarded.\n5. Cover the mouth of the new flask with foil, then shake and twirl by hand for 30 s.\nShaking too vigorously can break scaffolds.\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 for a total of three quick washes.\nUsing sterile flasks across steps is preferable to limit introduction of contaminants, but flasks can be reused for washing within a protocol run if rinsed thoroughly. To do this, rinse thoroughly with deionized water to remove residues, clean with 100% ethanol, and let dry upside down before the next wash. Cleaning and drying flasks takes \u223c10 min, so this should be done during wash wait times so the flasks are dry and ready when the next wash is done to minimize time between washes.\n7. Repeat step 4, then cover the mouth with foil and shake for 30 min at room temperature and 125 rpm.\n8. Repeat step 7.\n9. Add 2 L of 70% (v/v) ethanol to a sterile 4-L flask and transfer scaffolds to the ethanol.\n10. Cover the mouth with foil and shake for 1 hr at room temperature and 125 rpm.\n11. Add 2 L of 100% ethanol to a sterile 4-L flask and transfer scaffolds into it.\n12. Cover the mouth with foil and shake for 1 hr at room temperature and 125 rpm.\n13. Proceed directly to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002] or store if needed. To store, transfer to sterile sample bags, taking care not to transfer excessive amounts of ethanol. Vacuum-seal the bags and keep up to 3 weeks at 4\u00b0C.\nScaffolds in ethanol can be moved first to a small sterile beaker to facilitate transfer.Because opened sample bags should not be resealed, the scaffolds should be split according to future use, remembering that one scaffold is used to create one maintenance plate.\nExcessive ethanol in the bags will promote movement and tearing of the scaffolds. Failing to remove air or seal the bags properly can lead to scaffold oxidation, ethanol evaporation, and loss of scaffold integrity.This protocol is designed to create three-dimensional, controlled monoxenic maintenance plates (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-fig-0001]) from decellularized scaffolds. Due to the porosity of the scaffolds, it is not possible to obtain uniform bacterial growth throughout the scaffolds using standard methods (as outlined in Stiernagle, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014]). This protocol was developed to ensure uniform bacterial growth through a series of washes and incubations.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/af346211-cb14-48f7-9bdd-315be37bc289/cpz1288-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSeeded scaffold plate (reprinted from Guisnet et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0006]).\nFor parallel culture of animals on standard agar plates, we also describe how to prepare standard agar plates with a comparable cross-sectional bacterial density to the scaffold plates through a modification of the standardized methods outlined in Stiernagle (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014]). We describe how to produce two plates of each type at once, with additional details for adjusting the protocol to produce more plates.\nNOTE: Scaffolds are more susceptible to contamination than traditional agar plates. Throughout this protocol and when using the resulting plates, always work under sterile conditions close to a flame, with sterile reagents, equipment, and working surfaces.\nMaterials\nDecellularized scaffold slices (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0001])\nNGML (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-rec-0004])\nE. coli OP50 plated stock (e.g., Caenorhabditis Genetics Center; see Stiernagle, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014])\n6-cm NGM agar plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-rec-0003])\nSterile water\n250-ml glass wide-mouth Erlenmeyer flask\nAluminum foil\nShaking platform\nSterile scalpel (optional)\n125-ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks\n37\u00b0C shaking incubator\nSterile 6-cm Petri dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Transfer two decellularized scaffold slices to 100 ml NGML in a sterile 250-ml glass wide-mouth Erlenmeyer flask under sterile conditions. Cover the mouth with foil and shake overnight (8-16 hr) at room temperature on a shaking platform at 145 rpm to dilute out the ethanol.\nFor scaffolds in sample bags, use a sterilized scalpel to cut the bag open and retrieve scaffolds using sterile forceps.\nA wide-mouth flask facilitates transfer of slices to Petri dishes later. Because slices float, a large flask with a small volume of liquid is recommended to maximize surface area.\nFor a different number of slices, maintain a ratio of one slice per 50 ml liquid and use a flask size that accounts for liquid movement and avoids spillage. For different volumes or flask sizes, adjust the speed of the shaking platform so that slices do not stay overlaid or clumped together. If possible, set the shaking platform to reverse every 45 min to prevent clumps and free slices that have stuck to the sides of the flask.\nIt is not necessary to stagger the start time for this protocol.\nCAUTION: Because scaffolds are filled with ethanol, extreme care should be taken when working close to a sterilization flame or using warm forceps.\n2. Inoculate three sterile 125-ml flasks containing 50 ml NGML with a single colony of E. coli OP50 from a plated stock. Cover flasks with foil and incubate on a shaking platform at 37\u00b0C overnight.\nBecause contamination tends to be common in these cultures, it is recommended to prepare 1.5 times as many flasks as scaffolds. Always make fresh.\nDay 2: Inoculate scaffolds and standard culture plates\n3. Add 5 ml saturated OP50 culture to each of two sterile 6-cm Petri dishes.4. Transfer one scaffold into each dish. Add more culture if necessary to completely submerge the scaffold.\n5. Pipet 100 \u00b5l of the same culture onto each of two 6-cm NGM agar plates and shake briefly to spread. If there is condensation on the lid, wipe it off with delicate-task wipers.\n6. Line the interior of a water-resistant tight-seal box with delicate-task wipers and saturate them with sterile water.\n7. Place scaffold dishes and agar plates inside the box and close tightly. Make sure plates are flat and stable inside the box.\n8. Incubate 5.5-6 hr at 28\u00b0C.\n9. Take a scaffold with forceps (sterilized by flaming) and gently tap your wrist on the work surface to release 1-2 drops of excess culture. Deposit on a new NGM agar plate and gently lay the flat portion of the forceps over the scaffold to push out air from between the scaffold and the agar surface. Repeat with the second scaffold.\nTo increase depth of visibility and imaging quality, scaffolds can also be passed through a vacuum chamber for \u223c30 min or until all air is removed before moving them to agar plates. Note that this additional step tends to increase the risk of contamination and is thus not recommended for regular maintenance plates.\nTo restrict the bacterial culture to the scaffold, avoid moving the scaffold on the agar once it has been deposited.\n10. Seal scaffold plates and seeded agar plates with Parafilm and keep upside down in a closed box at room temperature for at least 24 hr before use. Store plates this way for up to 3 weeks.Several experimental designs require the use of synchronized eggs or animal populations. This protocol is adapted from Stiernagle (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014]) for collection of synchronized eggs from scaffold plates. The inhabited scaffold is sectioned and washed to release the eggs, which are then collected in a pellet and can be used directly or added to a fresh plate to grow the synchronized population to the desired stage.\nThis protocol is not recommended for quantifying egg laying inside scaffolds. Eggs tend to adhere to the surface on which they are laid, and it is not possible to assess the proportion of eggs collected with this protocol due to the dimensionality of the scaffold.It is not uncommon for C. elegans stocks on culture plates to develop a fungal or bacterial contamination, and scaffold plates are more prone to contamination than standard agar plates. To address this issue, we also describe how to clean contaminants from scaffold plate worm stocks using an adaptation of the bleach method from Stiernagle (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-bib-0014]). Contamination spreads easily within and between scaffold plates, so it is important to clean stocks or dispose of contaminated plates rapidly once contamination occurs. Using bleach to remove contaminants also dissolves hatched animals, but embryos are protected by the eggshell and will survive. The bleach is subsequently washed out to protect these animals as they hatch. It is thus essential to start the protocol with a plate that contains eggs or gravid adults. If all eggs have already hatched, it is preferable to transfer a few young contaminated animals to a fresh plate and proceed with the protocol when they have laid eggs, because excessive contamination can impede growth and egg laying. After cleaning contaminated stocks with bleach solution, a sterile pellet of eggs is collected in a small centrifuge tube and can be re-plated onto a fresh plate to resume animal culture.\nSynchronization and decontamination use the same basic egg extraction method, and the slight differences between them are outlined below. The Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0004] can be used to collect non-synchronized larval or adult worms from scaffold plates.\nNOTE: If collected eggs or worms will be re-plated, carry out these protocols under sterile conditions close to a flame, with sterile reagents, equipment, and working surfaces.\nMaterials\nScaffold plates with C. elegans:\n               \nlate-L4 from any growing condition (for synchronizing)\ncontaminated plate containing eggs (for cleaning)\nSeeded scaffold plate (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0002])\nNGML (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-rec-0004]) or bleach solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-rec-0004])\nSterile deionized, distilled waterSterile platinum worm pick\nSterile scalpel\nSterile stainless steel offset broad flat-tip forceps (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 16-100-116)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Diamed, cat. no.

For synchronizing only: Place ten late-L4 C. elegans larvae on a freshly seeded scaffold plate using a sterile platinum worm pick and keep overnight (8-12 hr) at 20\u00b0C.\nUp to 200 animals can be added per scaffold plate if a large number of eggs need to be collected. Some strains may lay eggs more slowly and need to be kept longer before proceeding, depending on the number of eggs needed.\nTo clean a contaminated plate, skip this step and start directly at step 2.\n2. Cut the scaffold in three parallel pieces of equal width using a sterile scalpel. Be careful not to cut or scratch the agar while cutting the scaffold as eggs and animals can get stuck in the interstices.\n3. Use flat-tip forceps to lay the pieces on top of one another on one side of the dish using sterile forceps (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f0f223d1-6983-4bd8-b25f-9d36cc846b87/cpz1288-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nCollection of eggs and animals from slices of scaffold. The dish is held at a 30\u00b0-45\u00b0 angle and liquid is spurted over scaffold pieces, washing the eggs and animals to the opposite side.\n4. Holding the dish at a 30\u00b0-45\u00b0 angle with the scaffold pieces at the top, wash 2 ml NGML over the scaffold pieces so that the eggs and animals are washed out and collected along the opposite edge (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-fig-0002]).\nTo clean a contaminated plate, use bleach solution instead of NGML.\nEggs and animals located under the scaffold pieces will also be washed out, so no other manipulations are required to collect them.5. Collect as much liquid without eggs or animals as possible from the bottom of the dish by observing under a microscope, and wash this solution over the scaffold pieces again.\nLiquid retained by the scaffold pieces can also be recovered by drawing it out delicately with the pipet.\n6. Repeat step 5 until no more eggs or animals are washed out of the scaffold pieces.\n7. Transfer the collected liquid to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nSome of the liquid should be absorbed by the agar, but use more than one tube if needed.\n8. Centrifuge for 1 min\u00a0at 2000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, in a tabletop microcentrifuge.\n9. Remove as much liquid (supernatant) as possible from the tube while being careful not to remove any eggs.\nIt is useful to carry out this step under a microscope. Eggs tend to sink in water but float in bleach.\n10. If eggs need to be washed completely of bacterial food before use, repeat steps 8-9 three to four times, filling the tube with sterile water each time.\nWhen cleaning a contaminated plate, it is absolutely necessary to perform this step in order to dilute out the bleach. Perform washes carefully, as residual bleach will kill hatching animals.\nEggs are now ready to use. If eggs were collected from a contaminated stock, they can be re-plated on a fresh uncontaminated plate and regular maintenance can be resumed.Animals can be picked directly from the scaffold, but a large portion of the population remains inaccessible within the scaffold. If the user requires a large number of animals, but does not need eggs or a synchronized population, this protocol can be used to force animals out of the scaffold and is faster than Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0003]. By shaking scaffold pieces in liquid, the animals are forced to exit the scaffold and can be easily collected with a pipet.\nAgain, this protocol is not recommended to assess population size, as it is not possible to know whether all animals have exited the scaffold. It is also not recommended as an alternative for collecting eggs, as cutting and shaking the scaffold breaks off pieces that are as small as eggs and can be difficult to differentiate from eggs.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.288#cpz1288-prot-0003])\nScaffold plate with growing C. elegans population\nReusable 6-cm glass Petri dish (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 08-747A)\nGlass Pasteur pipet\n1.

Use a scalpel to cut out 1- to 2-cm3 scaffold pieces from a plate of C. elegans and then use forceps to move them delicately to the Petri dish.\nCut out as many pieces as required to collect the desired number of animals. The Petri dish becomes saturated with material if more than half of the scaffold is added, however, so use more than one dish if needed.\n4. Release animals by shaking the scaffold pieces delicately in the liquid with the forceps.\n5. Collect animals with a glass Pasteur pipet under a microscope.\n6.

If the OD600 value is below 0.5, continue the incubation of the culture in the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask as described above until the OD600 value of 0.5 is reached. Of note , S. tm density duplicates every 20 min. If the OD600 value is above 0.7, dilute the culture 1:1 with LB medium and incubate the culture in the 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask until an OD600 value of 0.5.  Transfer the culture into a 50 mL Falcon tube.Centrifuge the S.tm culture at 4,600 \u00d7 g for 5 min at room temperature.Remove the supernatant by using a vacuum pump.Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of freshly prepared LB medium with 30% glycerol.Prepare 50 \u00b5L aliquots in 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.Store the aliquots at -20\u00b0C. Culturing and counting of S.tm  Notes:  Perform next steps in a sterile biosafety level 2 laminar flow cabinet. The procedures of culturing and counting of S.tm have been recently described in Brigo et al. (2022). Thaw an aliquot of S.tm at room temperature.Pipette 10 \u00b5L of the S.tm aliquot to 10 mL of LB medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask overnight at 37\u00b0C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm after covering the top with tin foil.The next day, prepare 10 mL of LB medium and pipette 50 \u00b5L of the overnight culture in a fresh 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask.Dispose of the remaining overnight culture and wash and sterilize the Erlenmeyer flask.Incubate at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 1\u20132 h.Measure OD600:Calibrate a photometer by measuring the blank with 500 \u00b5L of LB medium in a disposable cuvette.Pipette 500 \u00b5L of the S.tm culture in a new disposable cuvette and measure.OD600 should be between 0.5 and 0.7; in this state, S.tm are in their logarithmic growth phase.Pipette 5 \u00b5L of the S.tm culture to 10 mL Casy Ton buffer in a Casy cup and count living S.tm. Keep the remaining bacteria on ice until the infection of the cells is performed. Counting of viable S.tm using a Casy counting system  Note: The procedure along with the employment of the specific programs for the Casy counting system have been recently described in Brigo et al. (2022). Use the 45 \u00b5m capillary.Measure the background by placing a new Casy cup with fresh 10 mL of Casy Ton buffer under the measuring unit.Select Program for the background measurement.Measure the background activity. It should be below 30 counts and 1 \u00b5m size. Otherwise, wash the Casy counting system.Prepare a new Casy cup with 10 mL of Casy Ton buffer and add 5 \u00b5L of S.tm OD600 0.5.Shake gently.Place the sample in the measuring unit.Select the program for measuring between 1 and 3 \u00b5m.Measure.Click Next to get the number of viable counts/mL = viable S.tm /mL.Note: Viable counts from a freshly prepared S.tm culture with an OD600 of 0.5 is between 2.5  \u00d7  108 and 3  \u00d7  108 viable counts/mL.   Staining with CellROXTM and infection with S.tm   Note: Perform the next steps in a sterile biosafety level 2 laminar flow cabinet. The antioxidant NAC is used as a negative control, as it drastically decreases ROS stress in cells. Importantly, NAC is added before the infection or other treatments, to increase the antioxidant capacity of cells.We recommend at least triplicate well replicates per each treatment condition (e.g., four wells each of uninfected control, uninfected + NAC, infected, and infected + NAC, as depicted in Figure 1).  Add 5 \u00b5L of 500 mM antioxidant NAC (final concentration: 2.5 mM) to the negative control samples (Figure 1).Incubate the cells for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in a cell incubator.Pipette 1 \u00b5L of CellROXTM Deep Red reagent to each well (final concentration 2.5 \u00b5M).Incubate the cells for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in an incubator.Infect the cells with S.tm using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10; therefore, 10 times more S.tm than cells are added to each well.Example for calculation of S.tm:To gain a MOI10, multiply the cell number by 10: 1.5 \u00d7 105 \u00d7 10 = 1.5 \u00d7 106 Divide the calculated cell number by the gained viable Salmonella count (e.g., 2.5 \u00d7 108): 1.5 \u00d7 106 viable counts/mL: 2.5 \u00d7 108 viable counts/mL = 0.006 mL = 6 \u00b5LAdd the calculated amount of S.tm directly into the cell culture wells containing 1 mL of DMEM containing 1% L-glutamine and 10% FBS.Immediately after infection, place the plate into a pre-heated plate reader (TECAN Spark).Setup of the plate reader (TECAN Spark) and measurement of the infection phase  Note: A captured image of the setup screen is displayed in Figure 2.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4604/bioprotoc-13-03-4604-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Use this assay to avoid uncontrolled proliferation of bacteria that were not phagocytosed by macrophages. Gentamicin is not able to penetrate eukaryotic cells and therefore cannot affect internalized bacteria. Treatments or positive control (IFN\u03b3) is typically added during this bacterial clearance phase, as depicted in Figure 1.  Pre-warm the medium and PBS in a water bath at 37\u00b0C to avoid additional stress to the cells.Remove the medium containing non-phagocytosed S.tm using a cell culture aspiration pump.Wash the cells twice with 1 mL PBS + 25 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin.Add 1 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 25 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin.Add 100 ng/mL IFN\u03b3 to the positive control samples.Add 5 \u00b5L of 500 mM of the antioxidant NAC (final concentration 2.5 mM) to the negative control samples.During the bacterial clearance phase, incubate the cells for up to 24 h in a cell culture incubator (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity). Remove the cell culture plate only for hourly measurements.Setup of the plate reader (TECAN Spark) and measurement of the clearance phase  Note: During the bacterial clearance phase, we recommend single individual measurement in the plate reader. In between these measurements, the cell culture plate is kept in a cell culture incubator to ensure optimal environmental conditions for cells (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity). Furthermore, it is advised to keep the plate reader\u2019s temperature at 37\u00b0C and atmosphere at 5% CO2 all the time.

Note: Alternatively, the plate reader can also be set up for hourly measurements during the entire 24 h bacterial clearance phase with constant incubation of the 24-well plate in the plate reader, to minimize hands-on time.In this case, we recommend using a humidity cassette as well as the same environmental conditions as in the cell culture incubator (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2).", "All procedures described below are performed as standard of care for patients with cerebral AVMs, after obtaining informed consent as per institutional guidelines.\n1. Initial patient evaluation and imaging\nNOTE: Patients with unruptured AVMs often present after the malformation is discovered on imaging for headache or seizure workup. Patients with ruptured AVMs often present with acute onset of headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, numbness, and/or vision changes.\nObtain a thorough history by interviewing the patient and/or family (to determine previous rupture status, family history) and perform a detailed neurologic exam evaluating level of consciousness and orientation, cranial nerve function, extremity motor and sensory function, and reflexes. This exam may identify neurologic deficits as a result of occult vascular steal, local mass effect, and/or visual changes (with occipital AVMs). In cases of an AVM rupture, admit the patient to the intensive care unit (ICU), and care for according to American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines in conjunction with the neurocritical care team.9\nObtain a non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) per institutional protocol to evaluate for acute hemorrhage, i.e., an area of abnormal intracranial hyperdensity, often with mass effect. Obtain vascular imaging via CT- or magnetic resonance (MR)-angiography per institutional protocol to define cerebral vasculature and any underlying vascular abnormalities.10 Perform interpretation of all images by neurosurgical and radiology teams.\nIf the patient is neurologically stable, obtain informed consent and book the patient for definitive vascular imaging via six-vessel catheter angiography \u00b1 embolization (see sections 2 and 3 below). If the patient has progressive neurologic decline from a hemorrhage, place an intracranial pressure monitor and/or initiate osmotic therapies in accordance with AHA/ASA guidelines9. Pursue hematoma evacuation \u00b1 AVM resection (see section 4 below) prior to or immediately following diagnostic six-vessel catheter angiography.\n2. Six-vessel angiographyPosition the patient supine on the fluoroscopy table after administration of a light sedative if stable, or under general anesthesia if unstable with assistance from the anesthesiology team (typical induction for intubation with fentanyl [5-10 ucg/kg], midazolam [0.2-0.4 mg/kg], and 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium, followed by anesthesia maintenance with propofol at 50 -150 ucg/kg/min and remifentanil at 0.1-0.5 ucg/kg/min).11\nPlace a right femoral artery sheath using a micropuncture groin access kit and a modified Seldinger technique.12\nClean (with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol) and sterilely drape the groin.\nPalpate the femoral artery at the inguinal crease. Inject 1-2 mL of 1% Lidocaine HCl as a local anesthetic into the superficial subcutaneous tissue. Insert the micro-needle into the femoral artery lumen with the needle at a 45\u00b0 angle to the skin.\nAdvance a micro-wire through the micro-needle, and remove the micro-needle keeping the micro- wire in place. Make a 0.5cm skin puncture with a # 11 blade at site of microwire exiting skin.\nInsert a vessel dilator, and then remove the micro-wire and inner portion of the vessel dilator, keeping the outer portion of the vessel dilator in place.\nInsert a J-wire through the lumen of the vessel dilator, and remove the vessel dilator, keeping the J-wire in place.\nInsert a 5 or 6-French sheath over the J-wire into the femoral artery. Remove the J-wire, keeping the sheath in place in the artery.\nAdvance a 0.035 guidewire and 4-French diagnostic catheter cephalad under mono- or biplane fluoroscopy (3-5 frames per second) to the ascending aorta, and selectively catheterize and image via injection of 5-8 mL of radio-opaque contrast agent (240 mg/mL) the right external and internal carotid arteries, the right vertebral artery, the left internal carotid artery, the left external carotid artery, and the left vertebral artery.Review recorded angiographic images of the above vessel runs to determine the feeding vessels and draining veins of the AVM.\nIf acute embolization not pursued, remove the diagnostic catheter and guidewire, and secure the femoral artery with a sealant device as per manufacturer instructions,13 or by holding pressure for at least 10 min.\n3. AVM embolization\nNOTE: If the AVM is amenable to endovascular and subsequent surgical treatment (as defined by established grading scales1,8 as well as surgeon and multidisciplinary conference evaluations), the initial embolization may be performed in a delayed fashion or in the same session as the diagnostic angiography. Embolizations are often staged to decrease rupture and stroke risk from rapidly altered flow dynamics.\nObtain informed consent. With assistance from anesthesia place the patient under general anesthesia as in 2.1, and position the patient supine on the fluoroscopy table (if not at same time as initial angiogram).\nIn conjunction with a neuro-monitoring team, establish baseline neuromonitoring via somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), and/or electroencephalography (EEG). Continue neuro-monitoring throughout the case to track in real-time the function of critical neural pathways. SSEPs, TcMEPs, and EEG are used as part of a standard neuro-monitoring protocol, with addition of ABRs for vertebral/basilar artery lesions, and VEPs for visual cortex lesions.14\nObtain femoral arterial access utilizing the modified Seldinger technique and insert a 6- French femoral sheath as in 2.2.Introduce a pre-assembled co-axial system consisting of a 6-French guide catheter (a larger bore catheter on the outside of the system for stabilization), a 4-French diagnostic catheter (a smaller bore catheter positioned inside the 6-French guide for selective vessel catheterization), and a 0.035 guidewire (positioned within the lumen of the 4-French diagnostic catheter for system guidance) as one unit into the femoral sheath.\nAs in 2.3 advance the co-axial system cephalad and selectively catheterize the large-caliber cervical vessel (i.e. left or right internal carotid or vertebral artery) from which the desired feeding AVM vessel originates with the diagnostic catheter and advance the guide catheter to the appropriate cervical segment for support. Remove the diagnostic catheter, ensure adequate vessel runoff via rapid dispersion of a small injection of contrast, and perform a diagnostic angiogram (under mono- or biplane fluoroscopy, 3-5 frames per second) by injection of radio-opaque contrast (5-8 mL of 240 mg/mL)\u00a0to assess the blood supply of the AVM. An overlay guidance image (superimposition of desired vessel run with real-time fluoroscopy) or roadmap image (vessel subtraction template) is then created to assist with micro-catheterization of the target AVM vessel.\nIntroduce a dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) compatible microcatheter and microwire into the guide catheter at the groin, and advance the cephalad to selectively catheterize the desired feeding artery using overlay or roadmap guidance.Once the embolization position is reached with the microcatheter it is flushed with (DMSO). Once flushed, embolize the AVM nidus and desired feeding artery via controlled injection of a radio-opaque liquid embolic agent under a negative roadmap image until reflux tolerance is reached. Total volume of embolisate used is dictated by the size of the lesion, penetration of the nidus, and allowable reflux. Take care to avoid embolisate reflux into non-AVM arteries, or distal embolization into draining veins. Once the embolization is complete, back aspiration on the embolization syringe is held and the catheter is removed under fluoroscopic visualization.\nRepeat as needed by catheterizing other feeding vessels, with a goal of at least 50% pre-operative nidal embolization.15 Generally, only one or two feeding vessels and <40% of the nidus are embolized in a single procedure, making staged embolizations common.\nPerform final vascular imaging by contrast injection through the guide catheter as in step 3.5 to evaluate the AVM embolization and ensure patency of parent vessels.\nWithdraw the guide catheter and close the femoral artery as in step 2.5. If the patient is being taken directly to the OR for resection, the femoral sheath may be left in place for intra-operative angiogram (described in step 4.8).\n4. AVM resection\nObtain informed consent, with assistance from anesthesia place the patient under general anesthesia as in step 2.1, and position the patient based on location of AVM and desired craniotomy. Have blood consent and products available.\nIn conjunction with a neuromonitoring team, establish baseline neuromonitoring as described in 3.2, with continued monitoring throughout the case.\nSync pre-operative imaging with intra-operative neuro-navigation system using surface matching, marker, or pointer registration as per neuronavigation system specifications.\nObtain groin access as in step 2.2, if sheath is not already in place.Perform a craniotomy tailored to the specific AVM location within the cranium using a high-power drill system, ensuring a wide bony exposure.\n\t\nIncise the skin and galea using a #15 blade. Obtain hemostasis by placement of Raney clips on the skin edges and/or with Bovie electrocautery using the coagulate setting (Bovie Medical Products, Clearwater, FL). If the planned incision involves underlying muscle, incise the fascia/muscle with electrocautery. Expose the cranium by elevating the incised soft tissue flap from the bone with a periosteal elevator. Alternatively, a pericranial graft can be separately harvested at this time to assist later with closure. Hooks are used for soft tissue retraction.\u00a0 Irrigate and obtain hemostasis.\nCreate one or multiple burr holes on the periphery of the desired craniotomy with a 3 mm diameter matchstick drill bit using a high power drill system. Additional burr holes will allow for shorter bony cuts and for the dura to be stripped multifocally prior to performing the craniotomy.\nStrip the dura locally from the inside of the skull by scraping the inner surface of the bone with a bone elevator or footplate attachment, and complete the craniotomy by connecting the burr holes with a tapered drill bit with a footplate attachment for dural protection. If possible, plan the craniotomy to ensure early access to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cisterns for drainage.\nAlternatively, place an external ventricular drain into the lateral ventricle at either Frazier's or Kocher's point (after creating a small burr hole as in 4.5.1 and opening the dura sharply using a #11 blade) for CSF drainage. A lumbar drain placed in the lumbar thecal sac following puncture with a large bore Tuohy needle at approximately the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace may also be used for CSF drainage.After removal of the bone flap and obtaining hemostasis through bipolar electrocautery, place dural tack-up sutures to close off the epidural space by drilling small holes in the bone around the craniotomy with a C1 drill bit, and securing the dura to the bone at these sites using 4-0 sutures. Then, open the dura sharply using a #11 or #15 blade. Take great care to not injure the underlying cortex or cortical vessels. Once a small durotomy has been created, open the remaining exposed dura in either a cruciate or c-shaped fashion using Metzenbaum scissors, with Gerald forceps used to elevate the dural edge and visualize the tips of the scissors while cutting to preserve underling cortical structures.\nUsing an operating microscope with a variable magnification capacity of approximately 1.5X to 17.0X with a 10X eyepiece, excise the AVM.5 Other forms of surgical magnification, such as an exoscope, can also be used.\n\t\nStart microsurgical resection by first dissecting within the subarachnoid space (using a combination of blunt and sharp technique with bipolar forceps, a curved dissector, and microscissors) to define the AVM anatomy and expose its margins, free draining veins, and obtain proximal control by identifying and dissecting free all feeding arteries.\nTake great care to identify and preserve the draining veins early in the AVM dissection, as occlusion of the venous drainage prior to the arterial feeders results in engorgement of the AVM and increased rupture risk.\nAfter defining this anatomy, coagulate arterial feeding arteries as they enter the AVM in a proximal to distal fashion using bipolar electrocautery by gently holding the vessel between the tips of the bipolar forceps and using up to 30 watts of power, or by the placement of small aneurysm clips.Dissect circumferentially within the brain parenchyma immediately around the AVM nidus using bipolar forceps (for dissection and electrocautery) and a variable action suction tip. A brain retractor may be used to facilitate visualization for deep dissections.\nAfter completion of the AVM dissection, coagulate using bipolar electrocautery as in step 4.7.3 and/or clip any draining veins. Remove the AVM from the resection cavity. It is critical to remove the entire lesion to eliminate future hemorrhage risk.\nIf surgical resection is being attempted post-hemorrhage, perform removal of the hematoma remote from the AVM nidus until the brain is decompressed, and feeding vessels and draining veins are identified. After these landmarks are identified, continue AVM nidal resection as in step 4.7.\nAfter AVM removal, perform an intra-operative angiogram as in steps 2.1-2.4, using the arterial sheath placed in step 4.4. Use intraoperative single- or bi-plane angiography or C-arm fluoroscopy to ensure complete nidal resection.\nObtain meticulous hemostasis using bipolar electrocautery as in step 4.7.4 and by gently lining the resection cavity with absorbable hemostatic agents. Close or re-approximate the dura using 4-0 sutures and, if needed, a peri-cranial or synthetic dural graft. Replace and secure the bone flap using a plating system, and close the galea and skin using interrupted absorbable sutures for the deep layers and either staples or running suture for the skin. Remove the groin sheath and secure the groin as in step 2.5.\nExtubate if able, and transfer the patient to the ICU for close neurologic monitoring and recovery.\n5. Long term follow up\nAfter a radiographically confirmed complete AVM resection (either via intra-operative or post-operative catheter angiography), obtain remote imaging via catheter angiography at 1- and 5-year post-treatment.\nSubscription Required.

Preparations:\nFluorescent Dye for Labeling Platelets\nPrepare rhodamine 6G solution, 0.5 mg/ml, in saline and sterilize the solution with 0.22 \u00b5m filter.\nFeCl3 Solution\nMake a fresh stock solution of 30% FeCl3 (Anhydrous, equals 1.85 M) in pure water, and filter with 0.45 \u00b5m filter. Prepare 5 ml fresh FeCl3 solution at the desired concentration [e.g., 2.5% (0.154 M), 5% (0.308 M), 7.5% (0.463 M), 10% (0.617 M) and 12.5% (0.771 M)] by diluting the 30% FeCl3 solution with water in a 6 cm tissue culture dish and keep the lid closed.\nNOTE: Using the culture dish makes it easier to pick up the filter paper saturated with FeCl3 solution than to pick it up from a narrow container, such as a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\u00a0\u00a0FeCl3 is extremely hazardous and that precautions, such as wearing gloves and lab coat etc., Personal Protective Equipment, should always be taken.\nFilter Papers\nCut the filter paper to 1 mm x 2 mm size.

FeCl3 Induced Carotid Arterial Injury Thrombosis Model\nSurgical Procedures for the Thrombosis ModelUse 8 - 12 weeks old C57Bl6 mice (or other strains as necessary). Anesthetize mice with the mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Confirm the depth of the anesthesia by toe pinching.\nNOTE: This amount of ketamine/xylazine is sufficient to keep the animal in stable anesthesia and no pain (response to toe pinching) for at least 1 hr.\nRemove fur on the neck and upper chest with a small animal electric clipper. Depilatory cream is not necessary. Apply neutral petroleum eye\u00a0ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness during anesthesia.\nSecure the mouse in the supine position on the lid of 15 cm tissue culture plate. Use one long tape (~ 10 cm) to secure hind limbs and lower body, and two pieces of small tape (2 cm x 0.5 cm) to secure forelegs. Use a 4-0 suture to wrap around the incisors, tape the two ends of the suture to the lid to keep mouse neck straight (Figure 2).\nPlace plate with mouse head toward the operator under a surgical light source.\nSterilize the surgical site with alcohol pad. Use the Micro-Adson Forceps to hold the skin and use a surgical scissors to make a small incision (2 - 3 mm).\nHold the skin of the incision with the forceps and insert surgical scissors with jaws closed into the incision. Push the scissors subcutaneously toward the manubrium or chin, and then open the scissors to free the skin from the subcutaneous layer.\nCut the skin with the surgical scissors to make a midline incision from the manubrium to the level of hyoid bone (Figure 3A and 3B). Bluntly dissect the thin fascia (dotted line, in Figure 3B) between the submaxillary glands with a fine hemostat and a Graefe forceps (Figure 3B and 3C; blue arrows).NOTE: The manubrium (black arrow in Figure 3C) and the trachea (T in Figure 3C) will be seen after this step.\nHold the soft tissue and the skin seen at the right of the manubrium with the Graefe forceps, insert the hemostat under the fascia toward the 2 o'clock position (yellow dotted line in Figure 3C), open the jaws of the hemostat to free the jugular vein from surrounding tissue.\nCut the fascia, soft tissue and skin toward the 2 o'clock position (Figure 3C) with the surgical scissors to expose the right jugular vein (Figure 3D, arrow).\nDraw about 200 - 300 \u00b5l rhodamine 6G solution using a 1 ml syringe with 22 G needle, and then change it to 30 G needle.\nNOTE: This protects the 30 G needle from damage of its fine tip.\u00a0 Directly drawing the rhodamine 6G solution with the 30 G needle will not damage the tip; however touching the container wall accidentally will cause damage, which may make injection difficult.\nFlush the 30 G needle by slowly pushing out the rhodamine 6G solution, make sure no air bubbles remain in the syringe or the needle. Keep 100 \u00b5l rhodamine 6G solution for injection.\nBend 2 - 3 mm tip of the needle to a 90\u00b0 angle with the needle holder, which will prevent inserting the needle too deep to the jugular vein and makes the injection more easily controlled (Figure 3D).\nInject the rhodamine 6G solution into the right jugular vein to label platelets. To stabilize the syringe and keep the needle in position, hold the syringe with one hand and the needle with the Graefe forceps with another hand during the injection.After injection, clamp the injection site with the Graefe forceps to avoid bleeding.Open the jaws of the hemostat and insert it under the Graefe forceps to clamp the vessel wall of the injection site, and then ligate the injection site with a 6-0 suture.\nNOTE: As an alternative of step 2.1.15, applying pressure to the injection site with a finger for 2 min will stop the bleeding; however, this method has a risk of causing further bleeding if the clot at the injection site is removed accidently.\nBluntly dissect the soft tissue and fascia around the left submaxillary gland with the hemostat and the Graefe forceps and pull the gland toward the 7 o'clock position (Figure 3E) to expose the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (blue arrow in Figure 3E).\nBluntly dissect the fascia (Figure 3E, dotted line) between the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and the omohyoid muscle or the sternohyoid muscle (Figure 3E, green arrow) located to the left site of the trachea with the hemostat.\nPass a needle with 6-0 silk suture (about 15 cm long) under the middle of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (blue arrow in Figure 3E), put the two ends of the suture together and pull the suture laterally toward the 10 o'clock position.\nNOTE: This procedure should be performed carefully to avoid injury of the left jugular vein, which is located outside of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nBluntly separate the thin sternohyoid muscle and/or omohyoid muscle to expose the carotid artery (CA) (Figure 3F arrow) after pulling away the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Cut the sternohyoid muscle and/or omohyoid muscle as necessary. Use the hemostat to separate the soft tissue from CA without touching the CA.NOTE: CA is accompanied by the vagus nerve, the white structure seen in Figure 3G (green arrow), and in most cases it is under the thin sternohyoid muscle and/or omohyoid muscle (between the yellow dotted lines in Figure 3F).\nUse a fine tip forceps to pick up the lateral fascia around the CA while avoiding the vagus nerve and CA. Use another fine tip forceps to punch a hole on the fascia between the CA and vagus nerve.\nPass the hook through the hole and gently lift the CA, and then place the fine tip forceps under the CA. Move the hook and forceps in opposite directions along the CA to strip adventitial soft tissue. Free at least ~ 5 mm length of CA (Figure 3H, blue arrow) from surrounding tissue.\nTo block background fluorescence, press the end of a black plastic coffee stirrer to flat, crosscut the coffee stirrer into a 3 mm piece, and then cut longitudinally along the fold edges to get two pieces of \"U\" shape plastic (Figure 3H, green arrow).\nRinse one piece of this \"U\" shape plastic with saline and hold it with forceps and place it under the CA while gently lifting the CA with the hook (Figure 3H, green arrow). Immediately apply 2-3 drops of saline to avoid drying the CA.\nReal time Recording Video\nTransfer the mouse and plate lid together to the microscope stage and place in an appropriate position under the 10X water lens. Fill the space between the 10X lens and the CA with saline.\nStart the digital video recording software application, and launch a new file and name it accordingly. Record normal vessel images and write down the frame number when the video recording is stopped.NOTE: Reference the video recording software in the computer for recording. We use digital video recording software and the following descriptions are based on this application.\u00a0\nNOTE: Since mechanical trauma can injure the endothelium and lead to thrombus formation20, it is necessary to confirm that there is no surgical injury to the vessel wall prior to the FeCl3 injury. It is also necessary to confirm that there is no remaining tissue around the CA, which may form a barrier and attenuate the effect of FeCl3-induced injury. Write down the frame number of the records will make it easy to analyze the videos according elapsed times later.\nMove the mouse with plate lid out of the 10X lens. Fold a corner of a paper towel to make a thin and fine tip and use it to carefully blot the saline around the CA (avoid touching CA) as well as in other places in the surgical field. This is important to avoid dilution of the FeCl3 solution used.\nUse a fine tip forceps and pick up a piece of filter paper saturated with FeCl3 solution and place it directly on the CA and keep it on site for 1 min.\nNOTE: To aid visualization of the bloodstream and harvest accurate data, place the filter paper close to the distal end of the exposed CA (Figure 3I) and leave a short segment at the proximal site (green arrow in Figure 3I) for observing blood flow at late phase (see below).\nRemove the filter paper (this time point is defined as the start of \u201cafter injury\u201d) and rinse the CA with saline (at least 2 ml).Put the mouse with plate lid back to the 10X lens; observe the vessel and start to record video images. Write down the video frame number at the end of the first minute of recording.\nNOTE: Thrombus formation is identified by accumulation of the fluorescent platelets, which is observed in real-time video images on computer screen or under microscope. Record video images immediately after putting the mouse back under the microscope. Keep recording to the end of the first minute after removing the filter paper. Observe the entire vessel from the distal to the proximal sites to obtain information about the injury, and then focus on the area of interest (usually is the center of the injured area) for further imaging.\nRecord video images for 10 sec every minute for the first 10 min (e.g., 2:55 to 3:05) and then 10 sec every other minute until the end of the experiment. Write down the frame numbers when each recording is stopped.NOTE: The end points of the model are: 1) when blood flow has ceased for >\u00a0 30 sec; or 2) if occlusion is not seen in 30 min after injury. In this case, use 30 min for statistical analysis. Set Exposure Time of the video record as 10 msec at the beginning, so it will be easy to observe the blood flow over the thrombi. When the thrombi become large and the fluorescence saturates the camera\u2019s sensor, it becomes difficult to identify the blood flow over thrombi. To solve this issue, move the imaging center to the proximal uninjured site (Figure 3I, green arrow) where blood flow can still be clearly observed. We also increase the Expose Time to 15 or 20 msec when focusing on the proximal un-injured site, so the blood flow can be observed more clearly. When blood flow will cease, numerous larger cells (leukocytes) start to roll on the vessel wall at the proximal site of the thrombus. Flow usually stops within 2 - 3 min after the appearance of the large cells. Write down the Expose Time on the recording sheet if it is changed. It usually takes about 30 min from the anesthesia to the end of the experiment, if the normal wild type C57Bl6 mice were used.\nCAUTION NOTE: Don't use the white aggregated platelet clot as the sign of the blood flow cessation, which will not give an accurate data and it is affected by the exposure time. The white clot covered the vessel lumen does not mean blood flow ceased (see the representative video 1).\nAt the end of experiment, euthanize the mice using overdose ketamine/xylazine (200/20 mg/Kg), followed by cervical dislocation after confirming no breath and heartbeat.\n3. FeCl3 Induced Mesenteric Artery/Vein Thrombosis ModelAnesthetize 8 \u2212 12 week old C57Bl6 mice as mentioned in section 2.1.1. Apply vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness during anesthesia.\nInject Papaverine solution (total 0.4 mg/mouse) intraperitoneally to inhibit gut peristalsis.\nRemove fur on the neck and abdomen with an animal electric clipper. Depilatory cream is not necessary.\nSecure the mouse in the supine position on the lid of 15 cm tissue culture plate. Use four pieces of small tape (2 cm x 0.5 cm) to secure all legs. Use a 4 -0 suture to wrap around the incisors, tape the two ends of the suture to the lid to keep the neck straight (Figure 2).\nFollow procedures 2.1.4 - 2.1.15 to expose the jugular vein for injection of rhodamine 6G to label platelets.\nPerform a midline incision through the skin from xiphoid to lower abdomen using the surgical scissors (Figure 4A). Pick up the middle peritoneum (also called linea alba, Figure 4A, arrow) with Graefe forceps, which is clear and has no blood vessels, lift about 2 - 3 mm high, confirm no bowel under the cutting line, and cut the peritoneum open longitudinally with the fine scissors (Figure 4B).\nRe-secure the mice to right lateral position. Place the half-circle agarose gel close to the abdomen, and gently exteriorize the intestines and spread it on the top of the gel with the Graefe forceps (Figure 4C). Use the second branches for the thrombosis experiment (Figure 4C, arrow).\nNOTE: Use the hemostat or Micro-Adson forceps to help to exteriorize the intestines. Avoid hurting the bowel and the vessel.\nPlace 5 - 6 drops saline to keep the moisture of the bowel and vessel. Transfer the mouse with the plate lid together to the microscope stage and place in appropriate position under the 10X dry lens.NOTE: Use a dry lens because the jejunoileal membrane cannot hold saline solution. Make sure to drop saline solution on the exposed tissues to keep them moist.\nBlot the saline around the mesenteric artery and vein before treatment.\nUse a fine tip forceps to pick up a piece of filter paper saturated with 12.5% FeCl3 solution and place it directly on the mesenteric artery and vein for 1 min (Figure 4D).\u00a0 Remove the filter paper (this time point is defined as the start of \u201cafter injury\u201d) and rinse the injured mesenteric artery and vein with saline (at least 2 ml). \u00a0\nPut the mouse with plate lid back under the 10X dry lens; observe the vessels and start to record video images as mentioned in 2.2).\nNOTE: The end points of this experiment are: 1) when blood flow has ceased for > 30 sec; or 2) if occlusion is not seen in 30 min after injury, and in this case use 30 min for statistical analysis.\nAt the end of experiment, euthanize the mice using overdose ketamine/xylazine (200/20 mg/Kg), followed by cervical dislocation after no breath and heart beating are confirmed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "All the protocols in this study were reviewed and approved by the Simon Fraser University animal care ethics committee. Use Balb/cYJ (H2d) donor mice and C57Bl/6 (H2b) recipient mice to examine allogeneic reactions. Mice are used for experiments between the ages of 8 to 12 weeks. Use either female or male mice. Syngeneic controls consist of aortic segments from C57Bl/6 donors into C57Bl/6 recipients.\n1. Donor and Recipient Preparation\nNote: Both the donor and recipient are anesthetized and prepared before the surgery to minimize ischemia of the graft. Injectable anesthetics are used in the protocol to prevent obstruction of the animal by equipment needed for the delivery of inhaled anesthetics. However, if desired, inhaled anesthetic is an appropriate alternative. From the initial injection of the anesthetics, the entire procedure takes approximately 90 min to complete. Ischemic time of the graft is less than 30 min.\nAnesthetize the mouse with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (100 mg/kg; 10 mg/ml) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; 1 mg/ml). The mouse will be sedated within 10 to 15 min. Assess the depth of anesthesia by pinching the fatty part of the animal foot pad. Administer 1/3 of the original dose of the anesthetic cocktail, as needed, until the animal does not exhibit withdrawal reflex. Monitor the respiratory rate closely after every cocktail is administered. During surgery, assess the level of anesthesia every 15 min by pinching the anterior abdominal wall with a pair of forceps. The mice should remain deeply anaesthetized for 60 to 90 min.\nLubricate the mouse\u2019s eyes with an ophthalmic ointment to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.Shave hair as close to the skin as possible on the abdominal ventral region from the mid-thorax to the pubis. Be particularly careful not to nick any skin. Do not use depilatory cream because it may be absorbed into the skin and could be inflammatory.\nPlace the animal in supine position on a towel above the heating table or pad.\nClean the surgical site with a preliminary scrub with 2% chlorohexidine. Prepare a large working area to maximize the surgical field. Start scrubbing at the center of the surgical site and move to the outside in a linear or circular manner. Dispose of the gauze. Repeat this procedure at least 5 more times. Apply an alcohol prep pad to the same area. Once the alcohol is dry, prepare the clean area with Betadine solution and drape with sterile gauze.\n2. End-to-end Anastomosis Procedure\nDonor Operation\n\t\nMaintain aseptic technique throughout the operation. Clean all countertop and surgical table surfaces with 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide solution prior to use. Wrap and autoclave all surgical instruments, gauzes, drapes and gowns prior to use. Verify sterility of the instruments with a steam sterilizer indicator strip placed in each pack. Sterile surgical gloves are used and disposed of between surgeries. For multiple surgeries, sterilize the surgical instruments between uses with the hot glass bead sterilizer.\nPlace the donor mouse in a supine position on a clean, thin Plexiglas board wrapped with sterile drape under the operating microscope at 8-30X magnification.\nAfter ensuring adequate surgical anesthesia as outlined in section 1.1, proceed with surgery.\nUsing sterile scissors, make a single midline lower longitudinal abdominal incision, from the pubis to the xyphoid process.\nUsing a small retractor, open the abdominal walls to expose the cavity.Using sterile cotton tipped applicators, gently retract the intestines superiorly to the animal\u2019s left and cover with gauze moistened with saline solution. Move the reproductive organs inferiorly and locate the infrarenal aorta and the inferior vena cava (IVC). Moisten the exposed tissues periodically with saline solution.\nUsing the medical No. 5 forceps, separate the aorta from the IVC, from the level of the left renal artery to the bifurcation. Use 10-0 polyamide monofilament sutures to ligate the small branches near the aorta.\nOnce the donor\u2019s aorta has been separated from the IVC, saturate the vessel with saline, cover the exposed cavity with moistened gauze and set the donor aside onto a sterile area. Check the status of the donor (respiratory and cardiovascular function, and depth of anesthesia) every 15 min. Begin operating on the recipient, isolating the aorta as described below (Steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.7).\nOnce the recipient aorta has been separated from the IVC and set aside, return the donor under the microscope. Cross clamp (proximal and distal to the segment of interest) the donor aorta, approximately 5 mm apart, with two 4 mm microvascular clamps.\nUsing the Vannas-Tubingen microscissors, transect a small graft segment (3 to 4 mm in length) of the abdominal aorta.\nUsing a 25 G 5/8 needle attached to a syringe, flush the excised aorta with heparinized (100 U/ml) saline solution. Ensure the tip of the needle does not come into contact with the vessel.\nPlace aorta in heparinized (100 U/ml) saline solution on ice and set aside. While still under deep anesthesia, release the microvascular clamps. Euthanize the donor by exsanguination.Implant the donor vessel within 30 min of excision. Although it is possible to use one donor vessel for multiple recipients by excising a larger length of aorta, keep the ischemic time to less than 30 min.\nRecipient Operation\n\t\nMaintain aseptic technique throughout the operation, as in donor operation.\nPlace the recipient mouse in a supine position on a thin Plexiglas board wrapped with sterile drape under the operating microscope at 8-30X magnification.\nAfter ensuring adequate anesthesia, proceed with surgery when the animal does not exhibit withdrawal reflex.\nUsing sterile scissors, make a single midline lower longitudinal abdominal incision, from the pubis to the xyphoid process.\nUsing a small retractor, open the abdominal walls to expose the cavity.\nUsing sterile cotton tipped applicators, gently retract the intestines superiorly to the animal\u2019s left and cover with gauze moistened with saline solution. Move the reproductive organs inferiorly and locate the infrarenal aorta and the IVC. Moisten the exposed tissues periodically with saline solution.\nSeparate the aorta from the IVC, from the level of the left renal artery to the bifurcation. If necessary, use 10-0 polyamide monofilament sutures to ligate the small branches near the aorta.\nCross clamp (proximal and distal to the segment of interest) the aorta, approximately 5 mm apart, with two 4 mm microvascular clamps.\nUsing the Vannas-Tubingen microscissors, make a single horizontal aortotomy and resect a small segment (no more than 0.5 mm) of the abdominal aorta to accommodate the donor aortic graft.\nFlush the excised aorta with heparinized (100 U/ml) saline solution. The donor aortic graft should be of appropriate length to connect the recipient\u2019s transected aortic ends.\nPlace the donor aortic graft in the orthotopic position and anastomose the donor\u2019s graft end to the recipient\u2019s end, matching the respective graft anatomical orientation with that of the recipient.Gently grasp the tunica externa of the vessel and evert it slightly using the medical No.5 forceps. Using the forceps, drive the needle attached to the 10-0 polyamide monofilament suture through the full thickness of the vessel wall in order to secure the donor aortic graft to the recipient\u2019s resected vessel. Take care to ensure that the vessel opening is not closed off due to inadvertent stitching of the back wall of the vessel.\nFor continuous stitches, place stay sutures at 9 o\u2019clock in both the upper and lower ends of the graft. Starting at the upper end of the graft from 3 o\u2019clock, anastomose the resected ends with 2 running sutures and secure the suture to the stay suture.\n\t\t\nFlip the graft over and continue the running suture to dorsal part of the vessel, meeting the origin stay suture. Secure without applying much pressure on the vessel. Repeat the suturing for the lower anastomosis.\n\t\t\tNote: The interrupted sutures start the same way as the continuous suture with the exception that the vessel is anastomosed with three separated stitches between the stay sutures. Anastomosis time is usually 20 min.\nOnce the anastomosis is complete, release the distal microvascular clamp to allow retrograde blood to flow and check for leakage of the anastomosed sites. If there is a leakage, immediately place a stitch to close the defective site. If there is no bleeding at the sites, then release the proximal clamp.Examine the transplant and check that there is no blood obstruction in the graft, and the proximal and distal portion of the recipient\u2019s vessel. Vigorous pulse pattern in both the donor\u2019s and recipient\u2019s vessel is a primary indication that the blood is flowing freely. Using the pair of forceps, gently grasp one end of the stay sutures and slightly evert the vessel to inspect the back wall of the vessel.\n\t\tNote: There should be no puckering of the vessel wall at both ends of the anastomosed sites. Poor blood flow after removal of the clamps is a sign of thrombosis.\nUsing cotton tipped applicators, return the intestines into the abdominal cavity.\nWith the Castroviejo needle holder and Graefe forceps, close the abdominal wall with 5-0 polypropylene sutures using continuous stitching. Close the skin layer with the same sutures using subcuticular closure.\nAdminister Torbugesic (1 mg/kg) i.m. immediately upon completion of the transplant.\nGive immediately, in the order, Atipamezole (1 mg/kg), ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) and warmed Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution subcutaneously.\nImmediately after surgery, place mice in a heated cage under a water blanket overnight (12 hr). During the anesthetic-recovery period, place the animals alone in a clean, dry unobstructed area. Line the cage (autoclaved) with clean paper towels and adjust the temperature of the water blanket to approximately 20 to 22 \u00b0C. Provide dry and wet kibbles ad libitum on the cage floor.\n\t\tNote: An important component of post\u2013surgical care is the observation of the animal and appropriate intervention, as required, during recovery from anesthesia and surgery. The necessary intensity of monitoring will vary with the animal and might be greater during the immediate anesthetic recovery period as compared to later in postoperative recovery.Continually monitor animals having undergone anesthesia monitored until they recover completely. The animal must be able to maintain unassisted sternal recumbency and it must appear calm and free of pain before it can be left unattended.\nGive Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg BID) and ketoprofen (5 mg/kg SID) for a period of three days, both subcutaneously.\nMonitor cardiovascular and respiratory function, body temperature, and postoperative pain or discomfort during recovery from anesthesia for a minimum of three days. Additional care may be required, such as administration of analgesics and other drugs, and parenteral fluids to minimize dehydration and electrolyte loss.\nAssess the success of the transplant surgery by observing the motor function of the hind limbs. Complete success of the transplant involves unobstructed blood flow to the hind limb and tail, which should be immediate upon recovery of the animal, and complete recovery with no paralysis of the hind limbs on the second day\n3. Tissue Collection\nNote: Pre-determined end points range from 3-60 days depending on the type of analysis desired and the nature of the antigen mismatch. Generally, intimal thickening is robust at day 30 after transplantation across complete MHC mismatched mouse strains.\nAnesthetize the mouse with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (100 mg/kg; 10 mg/ml) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; 1 mg/ml). Assess the depth of anesthesia by pinching the fatty part of the animal foot pad. Proceed with surgery when the animal does not exhibit withdrawal reflex.\nClean the surgical site with water and ending with 70% alcohol.\nPlace the animal in supine position on a tray lined with absorbent pad.\nOpen the abdominal cavity with a large midline longitudinal incision. Place a self-retaining retractor to expose the cavity, the IVC and the abdominal aorta.Gently separate the transplanted donor aortic segment from the neighboring IVC using a pair of medical No. 5 forceps. Be particularly careful not to strip the adventitia of the transplanted vessel.\nExpose the thoracic cavity by cutting through the ribs along both sides of the thoracic spine all the way to the thoracic inlet. Reflect the anterior chest wall superiorly to expose the pericardium and secure the ribcage with a pair of hemostat.\nOnce the heart is exposed, insert a 25 G 5/8 needle (attached to a syringe) into the left ventricle and flush with 0.1 ml of heparinized (100 U/ml) saline solution.\nUsing a pair of scissors, remove the right atrium to allow the blood, heparinized saline, and fixative to leave the body during perfusion. Perfuse the animal with 5 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde or until the fluid runs clear. Remove the heart to ensure euthanasia.\nExcise transplanted vessel segment and immerse in 4% paraformaldehyde for no more than one hour. Set the transplanted vessel in OCT (optimal cutting temperature) matrix and flash freeze. Section the vessel under a cryostat set at 8 um thickness. Stain sections with Haematoxylin & Eosin and/or Verhoeff-van Gieson (van Gieson) elastic stain.\n4. Morphological Analysis of Grafts\nNote: TA is characterized by intimal thickening 13. In this model, intimal thickening and a resultant reduction in the size of the lumen are reflective of the severity of immune-mediated vascular injury. Syngraft controls are used to determine the baseline characteristics of vessels in the absence of allogeneic immune responses. These controls also permit evaluation of arterial damage that occurs as a result of the surgical procedure. There should be no intimal thickening in syngrafts.To examine intimal thickening and luminal occlusion, measure the area within the endothelial cell layer, internal elastic lamina (IEL) and external elastic lamina (EEL) on elastic van Gieson stained artery segments with an image analysis software. The parameters below can be used to determine arterial changes reflective of TA.\n\t\nMeasure the absolute intimal area: area within the internal elastic lamina - the area within the endothelial cell layer. This provides an absolute measurement of intimal expansion, which is the hallmark of TA.\nMeasure the absolute medial area: area within the external elastic lamina - area within the internal elastic lamina. This provides an absolute measurement of medial degradation or growth, which can occasionally occur as a result of immune-mediated changes to this region of the vessel wall.\nMeasure the total vessel area as the area within the external elastic lamina. This provides a measurement of vessel remodelling which involves expansion or constriction of artery as a result of immunological damage.\nMeasure the intima/Media: (area within the internal elastic lamina \u2013 area within the endothelial cell layer) / (area within the external elastic lamina \u2013 area within the internal elastic lamina). This provides a relative measure of intimal expansion and normalizes for differences in vessel size.\nMeasure the % Luminal Narrowing: [ (area within the internal elastic lamina \u2013 area within the endothelial cell layer) / area with the internal elastic lamina) ]*100. This provides a measure of the extent of luminal occlusion, which results from a combination of intimal expansion and remodeling (inward or outward) of the vessel wall.\nSubscription Required.

Device setup for patient at-home recordings\nWork with a representative from the device company to set four configured channels for acquisition, two from each implanted lead.\n\tNOTE: Each channel records a bipolar recording. Configured channels may use adjacent (e.g., 1-2, 3-4) or interleaved (e.g., 1-3, 2-4) electrode contacts. When leads with\u00a010 mm spacing are implanted, adjacent contacts are typically used. When leads with\u00a03.5 mm spacing are implanted, either adjacent or interleaved contacts are used. This is determined by examining the reconstruction of electrode implant location relative to anatomical targets and examining the amplitude of signals. If adjacent contacts produce low amplitude signals, interleaved contacts are preferable. Each contact can only be used in the montage once.\nEnsure the patient has fully recovered from surgery following the implantation of the device with cortical and/or depth leads (see24 for additional information on implantation technique).\nConnect the telemetry wand to the programmer (clinician tablet) and have the patient hold the wand over their INS or attach it to a tethering hat (custom-made, not part of the device system; see Figure 1).\nUsing the programmer, log on to the patient data management system (PDMS; https://pdms.neuropace.com/login.php), navigate to the correct patient, and select Programming and then Change ECoG Capture. Set the Capture Window to the maximum of 240 s for the four configured channels using the dropdown selection.\n\tNOTE: The device sampling rate is 250 Hz.\nOn the same settings page, set Reserve Space for magnet reservations to two and to zero for all other trigger types using the dropdown selections. This allows for prioritized saving of two recordings triggered by magnet swipes.NOTE: Scheduled storage can also be enabled, for automatic and non-prioritized saving of neural recordings at set times of day. These recordings will not be used for determining a biomarker but may be useful for other purposes.\nSynchronize the newly programmed settings with the patient's INS by selecting the Review & Program button, confirming changes shown in the presented table, and selecting the Confirm Programming button.\n\t\u200bNOTE: Detection and Stimulation should both be set to Disabled.\n2. Symptom collection during patient at-home recordings\nPrepare the web-based survey for the patient symptom report (e.g. REDCap25), including sliders for VAS-D, VAS-A, VAS-E, and selection responses for each question of the HAMD-6. Ensure the time of survey start and completion is logged.\nProvide the patient with the unique URL generated by REDCap to access the symptom surveys either via text message or email\n3. Procedure for concurrent at-home symptom reports and neural recordings\nInstruct the patient to set up the equipment, including a remote monitor (patient laptop) and wand, magnet, and device for completing survey (e.g. smartphone, tablet, or computer) (Figure 1). Steps 3.2-3.8 are performed by the patient.\n\tNOTE: Most patients quickly learn this procedure. In-person training sessions while the patient is still in the hospital following device implantation are helpful for familiarization with the components. After the patient has returned home, a video call while the patient is doing an at-home recording can serve as a useful refresher.\nTurn on the remote monitor and interrogate the\u00a0device using the wand, downloading electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings that have occurred since the last interrogation to the remote monitor.\nSwipe the magnet over the INS to trigger a magnet recording.NOTE: The magnet swipe triggers a recording with a 2:1 before:after the swipe ratio. In the case of an ECoG capture that is programmed to 240 s, this means that 160 s of data prior to the swipe and 80 s following the swipe will be stored.\nStart a timer. Use the unique URL to complete a symptom survey.\nAfter 4 min have elapsed or the patient finishes the survey (whichever happens later), swipe the magnet over the INS again to trigger another recording.\nAfter at least 80 s, use the wand to interrogate the device again, transferring the data from the two magnet swipes to the remote monitor.\n\tNOTE: Due to the limited on-board memory of the INS (up to 53 channel-minutes of data, depending on configuration13), it is desirable to immediately transfer these ECoG recordings to the remote monitor so that they are not overwritten by subsequent recordings.\nComplete steps 3.1-3.6 at least twice daily.\nAt least once daily, connect the remote monitor to the internet via ethernet and select Transfer Data and Synchronize on the remote monitor to send data to the cloud.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65177/65177fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Patient equipment for at-home recordings.

Determining a personalized biomarkerCreate a dataframe of self-reported symptom survey responses (e.g. JOVE.PR03_Symptoms.pkl).\nCalculate spectral power profiles for each channel of ECoG recording by convolving ECoG activity with a family of Morlet wavelets (40 kernels, 12 cycles, log-spaced between 1-120 Hz), creating a new dataframe (e.g., JOVE.PR03_NeuralPower.pkl).\nAssociate ECoG recordings with symptom reports that occurred within a time window spanning 5 min before to 5 min after initiation of the symptom report, using the trial_id field in the NeuralPower dataframe.\nIdentify symptom states (Figure 2)\n\t\nUsing Python 3.10, install requirements listed in the requirements.txt file (Supplementary Folder 1) to a new environment. This can be done using pip install -r requirements.txt.\nOpen JOVE-Symptom_State_and_Biomarker_Analysis.ipynb (Supplementary Folder 1) using the Jupyter Notebook.\nVerify the kernel is set to the environment into which requirements.txt were installed and run JOVE-Symptom_State_and_Biomarker_Analysis.ipynb.\n\t\tNOTE: JOVE-Symptom_State_and_Biomarker_Analysis.ipynb calculates the statistical similarity between scores on patient surveys using the cosine similarity metric, which ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical) and constructs a symptom state graph by aggregating the similarity values across all possible pairs of at-home patient symptom reports. Spectral power features for each symptom state are calculated by aggregating spectral power profiles associated with each inferred symptom state; this procedure yields a distribution of spectral power profiles linked to each symptom state (Figure 3).\nIn scenarios where more than two symptom states are identified, the distributions of spectral power corresponding to the most severe symptom state and the least severe symptom state are statistically compared.\nUse a cluster-based permutation t-test to identify spectral frequencies in which the spectral power of the severe symptom state is significantly greater than the spectral power of the least severe symptom state. The range of contiguous spectral frequencies that differentiate the symptom states is considered as a single candidate biomarker.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65177/65177fig02.jpgFigure 2: Schematic of the methodological approach for measuring symptom states, showing results from a representative example. Patient self-reported surveys are obtained and itemized symptom scores are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 (darker colors reflect lower symptom severity and brighter colors reflect higher symptom severity). (1) Each completed survey represents a snapshot in time of the patient's symptoms and is represented as a point (black) in high-dimensional space. (2) Time points are linked together in a symptom survey graph, which relates the cosine similarity between survey reports (lines between points). (3) Graph community detection assigns each time point to a community or symptom state (colored points and lines) based on the pattern of graph connections. (4) Symptom severity scores are averaged according to state assignment and provide a general symptom phenotype for each state. (5) The occurrence of each state may be tracked over time as a raster plot (vertical lines reflect a symptom report assigned to one state).

Programming device detector settings\nUsing the programmer, log on to the PDMS and select the correct patient, Programming, and Change Detection.\nBased on the selected personalized biomarker, select the correct channel for detecting activity.\n\t\nWhen creating a Pattern\u00a0for the first time, first select an ECoG by clicking on one from those shown below, a channel chosen from that ECoG, and a time period highlighted.\nWhen creating a pattern\u00a0from a preexisting one, change the channel by clicking on Pattern and selecting the Change Channel button.\nFor Detect, select Rhythmic Activity, which connotes a bandpass detector.Click More Controls and Adv Settings. Select the desired minimum frequency and maximum frequency. Ensure the settings are as follows: Bandpass: On; Line Length: Off; Area: Off; Inversion Logic: Not Inverted.\nProgram the Min Amplitude and Minimum Duration for the detector. Start with a minimum amplitude of 0.8% and a minimum duration of 0.64 s (equivalent to a Bandpass Threshold of five and Detect Analysis Window Size of 1280 ms).\n\tNOTE: Min Amplitude is a percentage of the total signal amplitude that the detected activity must exceed. Only amplitudes above this threshold can be used for detection. Minimum Duration is how long the high amplitude signal must be sustained. This is tracked as a count of fixed-duration time bins. Specifically, x of y 128 ms time bins must meet these criteria, where x is Bandpass Threshold and y is [Detect Analysis Window Size/128], as displayed in Technical Parameters. An episode (i.e. triggering of the detector) must be exited before a subsequent trigger can occur. Some settings may be too sensitive and result in staying in one episode indefinitely, thereby preventing subsequent triggers.\nOnce all the detector settings are selected, click Done to close all the programming windows.\n\tNOTE: Multiple detectors can be programmed; detection can be triggered based on AND/OR logic between these detectors. Start with one detector to understand the behavior before introducing a second detector.\nWith the wand placed over the patient's INS, select Review & Program and click through the confirmation messages to initialize this detector setting.\n6. Titrating device detector settingsAfter the device detector has been programmed and initialized on the device, conduct test recordings to assess if the sensitivity of the detector should be adjusted to achieve the desired triggering frequency. This can be achieved using Live ECoGs or the interrogation report. Adjustments to the sensitivity of the detector are determined empirically based on patient symptom reports, side effects, and outcomes. These adjustments may be needed throughout the course of treatment. Per day, 30 min of stimulation can be used as a conservative starting point to assess the clinical efficacy while also preserving battery life.\nLive ECoGs\n\t\nWith the wand placed over the patient's INS, select Live ECOGs on the programmer.\nDuring the live recording, count the number of detections that occur for the duration of the recording. This provides an indication of how often the detector will trigger.\n\t\tNOTE: Some detectors may be state-dependent, particularly detectors set to low frequencies (e.g., more active during periods of sleep or drowsiness). Thus, live recordings have limitations for estimating how often a detector may trigger. Live recordings may also suffer from electromagnetic interference (e.g., line noise) or poor wand positioning.\nInterrogation report\n\t\nMinutes to hours after setting the detector, place the wand over the patient's INS to interrogate the device.\nIn the PDMS, navigate to Activity, select Event List, and click on Initial Interrogation from the time of the recording. The table at the bottom provides a list, with times, of all the detection events. This document can be exported in pdf format and parsed for quantification.Based on the number of detections per unit time recorded versus the desired density of stimulation, adjust the detector duration and amplitude parameters if needed. Be sure to click on Review & Program after each set of changes to initialize these on the patient's INS.\n7. Programming device stimulation settings\nUsing the programmer, log on to the PDMS and select the correct patient, Programming, and Change Stimulation.\nSelect the desired lead contacts or Can (INS) to be anode(s) and cathode(s). Select the desired stimulation current, pulse width, duration, and frequency.\n\tNOTE: Up to five stimulation therapies can be programmed; each therapy comprises two bursts of stimulation, which can be programmed to be the same or different. A given detector trigger can lead to a variable number of stimulation therapies, depending upon the sustained duration of the episode. Only program Therapy 1, with both bursts having the same parameters, which will lead to a consistent duration of stimulation being delivered each time the detector is triggered. In this configuration, the total duration of stimulation delivered when the detector is triggered will be the sum of Stim 1 Burst 1 and Stim 1 Burst 2. If multiple therapies are programmed and delivered, a maximum of five therapies can be delivered during a given episode. The episode must be exited and a new episode triggered in order for subsequent stimulation to be delivered.\nIf desired to limit the total amount of stimulation delivered per day, select a value for Therapy Limit per Day and a Therapy Limit Reset Time.\n\tNOTE: The Therapy Limit Reset Time timezone is set to the patient's primary center. If patients have relocated, this may be different than the patient's home time zone.Specifically, if no overnight stimulation is desired, set the Therapy Limit per Day and Therapy Limit Reset Time\u00a0such that the detector achieves the therapy limit between the reset time and the patient's bedtime.\nWith the wand placed over the patient's INS, select Review & Program and click through the confirmation messages to initialize the stimulation settings.\nSubscription Required.

Startle-induced Negative Geotaxis Assay\nSelect flies of the desired genotype, separate them by gender, randomly group them in cohorts of 20-30 animals and flip them into new food vials every 2-3 days; test each set of flies (i.e. age-matched cohorts, one cohort/genotype) at least once a week.\nThirty minutes before the negative geotaxis test, anesthetize the flies with CO2 and place them in pre-labeled clear plastic tubes made with two empty food vials (see Materials Table) joined at their openings with clear tape (chamber dimensions: 19 cm x 2.85 cm). In our assays we typically use 25 flies/tube.\nNote. The recovery time from anesthesia can be varied from few minutes to several hours (e.g. O/N) and should be optimized for the specific genotypes tested.\nMark different heights (from 1 to 20 cm) on a piece of blotting paper and tape the paper on a vertical surface, perpendicular to the bench.\nPlace the tubes in front of the paper: the tubes should be all aligned and as close as possible to the paper to allow accurate height measurement.\nPlace the digital camera (see the \"Special Equipment\" Table) in front of the tubes, at a distance of 20-30 cm from the paper, on a stand (e.g. a pipette tip box), select the \"movie\" option and start recording; at this time you should also start a timer to keep track of the time between consecutive trials.\nAllow the flies to collect at the bottom of the tube by tapping the tube for few seconds (e.g. 10 sec). This step should be performed consistently (i.e. same duration, same strength, same operator) throughout the whole experiment.\nRecord flies' movements with the digital camera for 10 sec.\nRepeat steps 1.5-1.7 fourteen times at one-min intervals.\nAnalyze data:Count the number of flies that are above the 2 cm mark after 10 sec by visual inspection of the recorded movies.\nNote: In our assay conditions the flies' negative geotaxis behavior didn't last beyond the first 10 sec after startling (i.e. flies started moving in all directions 10 sec after startling them). The minimum distance climbed by control flies (i.e. 1 week old flies expressing the THGal4 driver, see legend of Figure 1) in this time window was 2 cm. Thus, we used the 2 cm mark as a reference for analyzing the climbing activities of flies of different ages and genotypes 10 sec after initiating the behavior. These parameters may require adjusting to account for differences in behavior of the flies tested (due for example to different genetic backgrounds or laboratory conditions). Notice that in our assay conditions, all the genotypes tested performed worse or similarly to the flies of the control genotype.\nTake the average of the results from the fifteen trials.\nExpress average as a percentage of the total number of flies in the tube (= % climbing activity); the number of repeats (N) is given by the number of independent cohorts tested for each genotype\nAssess statistical significance between different genotypes over time. This can be accomplished with a Student's t test (when comparing two genotypes) or a 2-way ANOVA analysis followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test (when performing multiple comparisons) using commercial softwares such as GraphPad (GraphPad Software, Inc.La Jolla, CA, USA).\nNote\nWe perform all our assays at the same time of the day, at RT and under the same light conditions. Keeping the flies in a 12 hr light/dark cycle environment is advisable to control for the effect of circadian rhythms on the flies' locomotor behavior.2.

PVA-polyacrylamide hydrogel preparation\nNOTE: As shown in Figure 1G, 1H, the PVA-polyacrylamide hydrogel is a water-absorbing polymer sheet. In the natural state, the gel is extremely difficult to cut into small pieces. The preparation is described as follows.\nPlace a PVA-polyacrylamide hydrogel in water for 24 h to make it easier to cut after hydration.\nUse a self-made cutting tool (Figure 1H) to divide the whole hydrogel into pieces, sized 2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm.\nTransfer these hydrogel pieces to an oven at 60 \u00b0C for 12 h for dehydration into small pieces of 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm as implantation materials.\n2. Anesthesia and preparation\nNOTE: Be sure to wear a surgical cap, disposable medical masks, and sterile surgical gloves throughout the sterile surgical process.\nPlace the rat on a heating pad, and ensure that rectal temperature is maintained at 37\u00b11 \u00b0C during anesthesia.\nPlace the rat into the anesthesia chamber filled with 3% isoflurane for 3 min.\nGently pinch the rat's limbs and toes with tweezers to test for loss of withdrawal response, indicating successful anesthetization.\nFix the rat on the operating table in a prone position, ensuring that the limbs and head of the rat are firmly fixed.Fix the anesthesia mask to the face of the rat.

Isolate plasmid as described in steps 1.2.2-1.2.4 and verify plasmid by sequencing with DBH Forward (5'-GAAGCTGTCACAGGGTTGTG-3') and LMO1 (5'-GGCATTGGACAAGTACTGGCA-3') primers.\nGenerate d\u03b2h:mCherry DNA construct with a gateway system by combining entry clones of a 5.2-kb d\u03b2h promoter, pME-mCherry, and p3E-polyA into the modified destination vector containing I-SceI recognition sites as mentioned previously in step 1.5.16. Isolate plasmid as described in steps 1.2.2-1.2.4 and verify plasmid by sequencing with DBH Forward primer (5'-GAAGCTGTCACAGGGTTGTG-3').\nLinearize d\u03b2h:LMO1 DNA construct and d\u03b2h:mCherry DNA construct (at a 3:1 ratio, respectively) in a total of a 15 \u00b5L reaction volume with 1 \u00b5L of I-SceI enzyme (5 U/\u00b5L) and 0.75 \u00b5L of buffer (10x), and incubate at room temperature for a minimum of 4 h or overnight. Ensure that DNA concentration does not exceed 750 ng in reaction.\nNext day and after linearization of constructs, add 0.5 \u00b5L of fresh I-SceI enzyme (5 U/\u00b5L) and 0.5 \u00b5L of 0.5% phenol red into 5 \u00b5L of total DNA mixture from previous step of 1.7. Microinject the total solution (of 50-80 pg of linearized DNA) into one-cell-stage wild-type AB embryos (and as many as 500 embryos) using 1.0 mm diameter glass micropipette needle as previously described17. Store the remaining DNA mixture at -20 \u00b0C for future injections.\n2. Screen and verify LMO1 transgenic fish line for germline transmission of LMO1 and mCherry\nAt 3-4 days-post-fertilization (dpf), anesthetize injected embryos with 0.02% tricaine and screen them for fluorescent mCherry expression, which presents anywhere throughout the fish body due to the mosaic transgenesis. Transfer mCherry-positive embryos into a Petri dish with fresh egg water and raise embryos to sexual maturity in accordance with the zebrafish book21.NOTE: Expect the ratio of positive fish to vary depending on the expertise and experience of research personnel. For example, beginning amateurs may have a low integration rate of 10%, compared to an expert's of \u226550%.\nTo determine the founder fish with d\u03b2h:LMO1 and d\u03b2h:mCherry transgenes integrated into germ cells, outcross single pairs of injected mCherry-positive F0 sexually matured fish from previous step (2.1) with WT AB fish. Screen the F1 generation for mCherry-positive embryos at 3-4 dpf.\nTo confirm that the mCherry-positive fish carry LMO1 transgene, isolate the gDNA from F1 mCherry-positive single embryo using the gDNA extraction buffer, which contains: 12.5 \u00b5L of 4x lysis buffer (500 \u00b5L of 1 M Tris with pH of 8.4, 2.5 mL of 1 M potassium chloride, and 47 mL of purified water), 35 \u00b5L of purified water, and 2.5 \u00b5L of proteinase K at 10 mg/mL. Incubate the sample for 16 h at 55 \u00b0C, followed by 10 min at 98 \u00b0C.\nUse the extracted gDNA (2 \u00b5L) as a template for the genotyping PCR with primers: LMO1 FW: 5'-GGCATTGGACAAGTACTGGCA -3' and LMO1 RV: 5'-CGAAGGCTGGGATCAGCTTG -3', and the following PCR program: 1 cycle of 94 \u00b0C, 10 min; 35 cycles of (94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s; 68 \u00b0C, 30 s); and 68 \u00b0C for 7 min. Confirm the amplified 182 bp fragment by sequencing.\nAfter confirmation of the genotype, raise the remaining mCherry-positive F1 embryos to maturity in accordance with the standard guidelines of the zebrafish book21. Fin clip and genotype them at 2-3 months of age using steps 2.3-2.4 from the protocol above to further confirm the integration of the LMO1 transgene in the fish.\n\tNOTE: The LMO1-positive F1 fish will be the stable transgenic fish [Tg(d\u03b2h:LMO1),Tg(d\u03b2h:mCherry)] (designated as LMO1 line).Breed F1 LMO1 stable transgenic fish with WT fish and repeat as needed to propagate this line.\n3. Outcross of LMO1  and MYCN  transgenic lines to create metastatic model\nOnce the LMO1 transgenic zebrafish line is generated, interbreed with MYCN line6,17 to develop heterozygous transgenic fish line overexpressing both MYCN and LMO1.\nAt 1 dpf, sort the progeny of outcross for EGFP expression with stereoscopic fluorescence microscope, which presents as EGFP-positive points in the hindbrain region.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, if not all embryos are sorted for MYCN at 1 dpf, raise the embryos to adulthood and genotype by fin clipping and using formerly stated guidelines from steps 2.3-2.4 for gDNA isolation and PCR genotyping, with primers: MYCN-F (5'-ATT CAC CAT CAC TGT GCG TCC-3'); MYCN-R (5'-TGC ATC CTC ACT CTC CAC GTA-3', and the following program with standard Taq polymerase: 1 cycle of 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, 35 cycles of (94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 3 min), and 68 \u00b0C for 7 min with expected amplicon size of 145 bp.\nAfter sorting for EGFP at 1 dpf, isolate screened embryos into separate Petri dishes and label dishes as: MYCN+ (EGFP-positive) or MYCN- (EGFP-negative).\nAt 3-4 dpf, visualize and sort embryos of both groups (step 3.3) for LMO1 expression with a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope. Look for red fluorescent protein expression as spots in both the superior cervical ganglion and non-PSNS dopaminergic neuronal cells in the head region, especially in oblongata medulla of the hindbrain6,13.\n\tNOTE:\u00a0Screen for mCherry/LMO1\u00a0before embryos reach 5 dpf, because air-filled swim bladders fully develop by then and will cause the embryos to float, resulting in difficult microscopic focusing of the PSNS cells during the sorting process.Once sorting is completed, isolate sorted fish into four groups of different genotypes and label as below. Raise the sorted fish in identical conditions according to the standard protocols from the zebrafish book21.\n\t\nMYCN-only (EGFP-positive),\nLMO1-only (mCherry-positive),\nMYCN; LMO1 (EGFP and mCherry double positive),\nWT (EGFP and mCherry double negative).\n4. Visualizing tumor burden in transgenic zebrafish lines\nAt 4 weeks-post-fertilization (wpf), anesthetize sorted fish from step 3.5 with 0.02% tricaine in a petri dish.\nVisualize tumors with a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope by gently flipping fish with a metal spatula onto both lateral sides to view tumor. Expect tumors to present as single EGFP-, single mCherry-, or double EGFP-and-mCherry-positive masses that arise from the interrenal gland region (near head and kidney).\n\tNOTE: It is possible that the initial tumor onset is typically presented with a brighter and larger fluorescence positive mass on one side of interrenal gland, which is why it is crucial to visualize both sides of fish to avoid missing early tumor onset.\nAfter identification of the possible tumor-bearing fish, isolate fish into a separate tank with appropriate labels, which includes date of birth, date when tumor screened, and genotype.\nAt 6 wpf, repeat previous steps 4.1-4.3 to screen tumor-bearing fish and non-tumor bearing fish again to confirm the presence of tumors for previously screened tumor-bearing fish or identify new possible tumor-bearing fish, respectively. Look for sustained or increased size of fluorescence-positive mass in confirmed tumor-bearing fish.\nAfter identifying tumor-bearing fish, monitor them biweekly for evidence of tumor cell migration, which presents as tiny EGFP- and/or mCherry-positive tumor masses far from the primary site of tumorgenesis (interrenal gland region). Isolate these fish into separate tanks as needed and label appropriately to indicate possible metastasis.To further confirm the metastasis, continue tracking these fish regularly (every two weeks) until the distant fluorescence-positive tumor masses show clearly increased size, indicating growth of tumors in the metastatic sites.\n5. Tissue processing and paraffin sectioning of tumor-bearing fish\nNOTE: Perform this step to characterize the spontaneously developed primary and/or metastatic tumors in MYCN and MYCN;LMO1 transgenic fish.\nAfter identification and verification of tumor-bearing fish, sacrifice fish from step 4.6 in a Petri dish by submerging fish in 0.02% tricaine to anesthetize first and then increasing tricaine dosage until fish is no longer respiring. Cut the fish into two pieces-with one piece containing the head and a portion of the body's middle section (including tumor), and another piece with the rest of the fish's middle section and tail.\nFix both fish sections with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker. To enhance fixation efficiency, replace buffer with fresh 4% PFA to increase penetrance to the internal organs effectively and quickly. Leave fish with fresh fixing buffer on a rocker at 4 \u00b0C overnight or for 48 h.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic. Since precautionary procedures and proper disposal of reagent depends on the regulations of your institution, seek proper guidelines before using and disposal of reagent.\nPrior to the processing, place sample(s) in 100% rapid decalcifier solution for 15-20 min at room temperature. Make sure to use a nonmetal container and to check sample(s) throughout incubation to prevent over decalcification. If sample tissue looks heavily degraded, place sample in water or at 4 \u00b0C to slow down the decalcification process.Once fixed and decalcified, wash fish sample(s) with running tap water for 1 h and place it into processor cassette(s). If there is more than one sample, separate each into its own cassette.\nDehydrate and prepare the tissue for paraffin embedding by placing cassette(s) with fish into the tissue processor where the sample(s) are submerged in various solutions, respectively, as follows: 70% ethanol (60 min, 40 \u00b0C), 85% ethanol (50 min, 40 \u00b0C), 95% ethanol (40 min, 40 \u00b0C)\u00a0twice, 100% ethanol (30 min, 40 \u00b0C), another fresh solution of 100% ethanol (50 min, 40 \u00b0C) twice, xylene (30 min, 40 \u00b0C), another fresh solution of xylene (50 min, 40 \u00b0C), another fresh xylene (50 min, 45 \u00b0C), paraffin (30 min, 45 \u00b0C), paraffin (20 min, 58 \u00b0C) three times.\nAfter the tissue is processed, unload the cassette(s) from the processor machine while maintaining organization of each cassette and making sure to prevent mixing up the fish samples.\nChoose the appropriate sized mold based on the size of the fish, making sure the mold will fit the entire cassette with the fish sample. Cover the bottom of the mold with liquid paraffin at 60 \u00b0C.\nImmediately place cassette with the fish on top of mold (making sure the fish is laid on its flat lateral side for sagittal sections) with liquid paraffin, and finish filling with paraffin to the top of the mold to completely embed the fish.\nPlace the completed mold on the cold plate of the sectioning microtome until the paraffin is hardened.\nOnce the paraffin block is hard, which can be judged by visually observing higher opacity and a firm touch to the block, gently remove the block from the mold. Carefully scrape off any excess paraffin from the sides of the cassette.Section the paraffin-embedded fish block sagittally at 4 microns on the microtome and float the sections on a warm water bath at 40 \u00b0C containing distilled water.\nCarefully transfer the sections onto positively charged slides and bake in oven at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min prior to staining before proceeding to either step 6, 7, or 8.\n6. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of paraffin sections for pathology review\nPlace slides containing paraffin sections from step 5.12 into a slide holder. Inside a chemical fume hood, deparaffinize with xylene 3 times, 5 min each. Discard solution after each use.\nRehydrate sections with 100% ethanol for 3 min, and repeat twice with fresh 100% ethanol. Replace 100% ethanol with 95% ethanol for 3 min and then, 80% ethanol for 3 min.\nRinse sections with distilled water for 5 min. While the sections are washing in water, make sure to remove oxidized particles from hematoxylin by either filtering or skimming surface of hematoxylin with a lint-free wipe.\nBlot the excess water from the slide holder with lint-free professional grade wipes, and stain slides in 50% hematoxylin (1:1 dilution with distilled water) for 2-5 min depending on desired staining preference and reagent deterioration. Discard hematoxylin when solution color changes from plum to blue/brown or when staining time becomes excessive. Rinse the slides with running tap water for 20 min.\nDecolorize the sections in 1% acid ethanol (3.3 mL of Hydrochloric acid with 50 mL of 70% ethanol) by quickly dipping the slides multiple times. Slides can be dipped up to 3 s, but the longer the slides are dipped, the lighter the sections become.Rinse the slides in tap water twice for 1 min each, and once with deionized water. As an option, slides can be left overnight at this stage, soaking in water.\nImmerse the sections in 1.36% lithium carbonate solution (47 g lithium carbonate, 3500 mL water) for 3 s. Make sure not to over incubate the sections since the longer the time in lithium carbonate solution, the more likely the tissue will float.\nRinse the sections in tap water for 5 min, and blot the excess water from the slide holder with lint-free professional grade wipes.\nCounterstain the slides in 100% ready-to-use eosin for 15-30 s, and immediately dehydrate with 95% ethanol twice for 5 min each. Replace with 100% ethanol twice for 5 min each, discarding the solutions after each use.\nClear the sections in xylene for 15 min and repeat twice for 3 times in total. Optionally, the slides can be left in xylene overnight at room temperature to better clear excess water.\nAllow the slides to air dry in the chemical fume hood and then mount a cover slip using mounting medium to seal tissue sample.\nVisualize and image the stained tissue sections under microscopy. Carefully examine the tumors at the primary site (the interrenal gland region in head kidney) and the distant sporadic metastases in other tissues and organs of the fish. Send out stained slides for tissue sections to be reviewed by pathologists. Based on the fish model's similar pathological features to human neuroblastoma, expect the tumors that arose in MYCN-only or MYCN;LMO1 fish to be first diagnosed as neuroblastoma by pathologists.\n7. Immunohistochemical Analysis (IHC) with antibodies against NB marker and overexpressed transgenes to further confirm the spread of tumor and their sympathoadrenal lineage property\nStaining with fully automatic staining systemTo better compare the IHC result with that of H&E staining, select adjacent slides from step 5.12 for IHC staining.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: Although an automated staining system allows for faster and less laborious results, a manual protocol for IHC staining can be used in the absence of such by referring to steps of subsection 7.2.\nDilute the primary antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:500), a neuroblastoma marker, based on desired concentration and total amount needed with the automated system's corresponding Primary Antibody Diluent.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: Optimal antibody concentrations may vary depending on antibody and tissue.\nSince the automated system uses onboard heat-induced antigen retrieval with epitope retrieval solution for 20 min and the system's corresponding detection reagent, ensure the parameters for the machine are set as: Peroxidase Blocking, 5 min; Primary antibody with desired concentration, 15 min; biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500), 8 min; Streptavidin HRP, 8 min; mixed DAB intense substrate, 5 min; and Hematoxylin, 5 min.\nOnce the settings are set, place the antibody tray into the machine. Set up the slides by creating a new case, which will label the slides. The machine is now loaded and ready to run (dewaxing, staining, and counterstaining).\nOnce the slides are dewaxed, stained, and counterstained using the automated machine, dehydrate the slides in ethanol gradients of 70%, 95%, and 100% for 5 min each. Submerge slides of sections in 100% fresh ethanol again for 5 min.\nClear the sections in xylene for 5 min, twice, or leave slides in xylene overnight to better clear excess water.\nAllow the slides to air dry in the chemical fume hood and then mount a cover slip using a mounting medium. Visualize and image the stained tissue sections with microscopy.To firmly confirm metastasis in the fish model, compare the slides stained with antibodies against neuroblastoma marker from step 7 to those stained by H&E from step 6.\n\t\tNOTE: Expect to see positive staining for neuroblastoma marker, TH, in all tumor cells identified by H&E staining. Also expect no positive staining for TH in adjacent tissues where the metastatic tumors were identified in LMO1;MYCN fish. Make sure to select control WT and MYCN-only fish that are of similar age to MYCN;LMO1 fish for this analysis to rule out the possibility that the metastatic tumors are multifocal primary tumors.\nManually staining without automated IHC staining system\n\t\nAfter the slides are baked, select adjacent slides from step 5.12 to allow better comparison between H&E and IHC staining to deparaffinize. Inside a chemical fume hood, dewax and rehydrate the slides with xylene using previous steps 6.1 and 6.2., respectively.\nAfter deparaffinization and rehydration, soak slides in endogenous peroxide blocking solution (1x PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 0.3% hydrogen peroxide) for 5 min at room temperature. Wash slides in fresh 1x PBS for 3 min and repeat twice for a total of 3 times.\n\t\tCAUTION: Sodium azide is acutely toxic. Ensure to practice precautionary procedures and proper disposal of reagent depending on the regulations of your institution.\nRetrieve antigen by incubating slides in solution with proteinase K (1:500 in 1x PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Wash slides 3 times with 1x PBS for 3 min each.\nBlock slides by incubating with 5% goat serum in 1x PBS for 30 min at room temperature on rocker. Wash slides with fresh 1x PBS twice for 3 min each.Add 4 drops of Avidin blocking solution directly onto slide and incubate for 15 min at room temperature. After washing slides with fresh 1x PBS twice for 3 min each, add 4 drops of Biotin blocking solution and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nAfter blocking slides, incubate in primary antibody of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:500) for 45-60 min at room temperature, or overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\n\t\tNOTE: Stain with additional antibodies against transgenes and other relevant markers to address physiology and activity of primary tumor and other metastatic sites. Optimal antibody concentrations may vary depending on antibody and tissue.\nWash slides with fresh 1x PBS for 3 min, repeating twice with a total of 3 times.\nIncubate slides in secondary antibody of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500) diluted in blocking solution for 45-60 min at room temperature. Repeat previous washing step 7.2.7.\nAdd HRP conjugated Avidin (1:300 in 1x PBS), and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Wash slides 3 times with fresh 1x PBS for 5 min each.\nPrepare 3,3\u2019-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution (2.5 mL distilled water, 1 drop of kit buffer, 1 drop of hydrogen peroxide, and 2 drops of DAB from kit), and place drops of DAB directly onto slides near a microscope. After adding DAB, observe the color change reaction on the slides under microscope. Once desired staining intensity is reached, stop reaction by placing slide sections in cold distilled water.\nCounterstain the slides with fresh 50% hematoxylin by submerging or dipping samples for a few short seconds and placing back into distilled water. Repeat as desired, but normally, once should be enough since tissue sections are thin.Dehydrate tissue samples on slides in alcohol gradient as previously described in step 7.1.5 and continue through the remaining steps (with the last step as 7.1.8) to finish the IHC analysis.\n8. Picrosirius red staining of paraffin slides for collagen accumulation in tumors as mechanism study\nRepeat steps 6.1-6.3 to dewax, hydrate, and wash paraffin sections on slides.\nAfter blotting the excess water from the slide holder with professional grade lint-free wipes, stain in 50% hematoxylin for 10 min. Rinse the slides with running tap water for 10 min.\nTransfer the slides into Picrosirius Red and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nWash the slides in acidified water (5 mL glacial acetic acid in 1 L of tap or distilled water) twice, incubating for 5 min on shaker.\nDecant most of the water from slides first before physically shaking and blotting sections on slides to remove as much water as possible.\nQuickly place slides into three changes of 100% ethanol to dehydrate paraffin sections.\nRepeat steps 6.10 and 6.11 to clear slides in xylene and mount sample. Next, image with compound microscope that is equipped with a camera.\nUsing ImageJ, count the picrosirius red-positive collagen fibers in at least three random fields for each section. Compare between slides of MYCN and MYCN;LMO1 fish sections.\nSubscription Required.

Quantification and analysis of tumor cell proliferation and apoptosisNOTE: In order to measure the potential effect of the different \u03b2-glucans on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, an in-house script was used in ImageJ software to quantify the number of positive pixels of Ki67 (proliferation) and cCasp3 (apoptosis)13.\nOpen ImageJ. Click on the Plugins button. Click on Coloc2, a plugin previously installed in the plugin folder, and finally select the image to analyze11.\n\tNOTE: This plugin was available following previous contact with Dr. Vasiliki Economopoulos (veconom@uwo.ca). Instead of the script, both ImageJ and Fiji software have different tools for colocalization analysis (see Table of materials), with similar properties.\nSet thresholds according to the control (untreated, DMEM only) conditions. Click on the OK button.\n\tNOTE: In order to avoid background and intensity discrepancies, all images must be taken under the same conditions. Preferably, imaging sessions should be performed on the same day, and microscope parameters unaltered across images.\nEnsure that the resulting images of the colocalized pixels and a summary window providing the percentage or raw number of pixels above the threshold pop up. Normalize the results with respect to the control (untreated) conditions.\n\tNOTE: All data are given as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using graphing and analysis software (see Table of Materials). A one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used.

DNA preparation for in vivo electroporation or IVE (1 day before surgery)\nGather the following materials: purified DNA (0.5-25 \u00b5g per animal), 3 M sodium acetate, ethanol, Fast Green dye, ultrapure distilled water, phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (see the\u00a0Table of Materials).\n\t\u200bNOTE: For DNA, a construct expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under a human ubiquitin promoter was obtained from Addgene (FUGW, https://www.addgene.org/14883/). Any construct expressing GFP or another fluorescent protein under the control of a ubiquitous promoter should work. CGN-specific labeling with this technique is not dependent on the construct, but rather on the electroporation.\nPrepare DNA for electroporation by mixing the desired amount of DNA, 10% by volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 250% by volume of 100% ice-cold ethanol. Note that the DNA will precipitate out of solution immediately.\nContinue to precipitate the DNA mixture overnight at -20 \u00b0C or for an hour at -80 \u00b0C.\nPellet precipitated DNA in a tabletop centrifuge at >16,000 \u00d7 g and wash twice with 70% ethanol.\nAllow the DNA pellet to dry completely, and reconstitute in a 1x PBS + 0.02% Fast Green solution.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62568/62568fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Limiting injection depth to 1.5 mm using a spacer.

In vivo  electroporation of granule neuron progenitors in seven-day old postnatal miceNOTE: All electroporation surgeries were performed in a sterile and highly ventilated surgical suite, and all personnel wore complete personal protective equipment including gloves, face mask, hair bonnet, gown, and shoe covers. Alternatively, the surgeries can be performed in a ventilated and sterile hood.\nGather the following materials: DNA for electroporation, small surgical scissors, small surgical tweezers, customized Hamilton syringe, cotton-tip applicator, heating pad, betadine, 70% ethanol, 1x PBS, parafilm, tissue adhesive (n-butyl-ester cyanoacrylate), isoflurane, electroporator, and tweezer-type electrodes (see the Table of Materials).\nCut a spacer from a sterilized loading tip to fit over the Hamilton syringe to limit the injection depth to 1.5 mm (Figure 1A,B). Secure the spacer with adhesive or parafilm.\nAnesthetize the P7 pup in an isoflurane chamber at a delivery rate of 0.8 L/min. Confirm full anesthesia by monitoring the animal for decreased respiration and a lack of a toe or tail pinch response (Figure 2A).\nOnce the animal is fully anaesthetized, place the pups on a pedestal fitted with a nose cone, delivering constant 4% isoflurane at a delivery rate of 0.8 L/min. Clean the top of the pup's head 3 times with a sterile swab of betadine then 70% ethanol, alternating between the two, to prepare the site.\u00a0Allow the solution to dry before proceeding.\nUsing a pair of sterilized scissors, make a small incision with one cut that spans the distance from the top to the base of the ears to reveal the hindbrain (Figure 2B).Locate the cerebellum (Figure 2C), insert the exposed tip of the Hamilton syringe through the skull, perpendicular to the brain, and inject 1.5 \u00b5L of DNA mixture into the cerebellar parenchyma by slowly pushing the back plunger of the syringe. After delivery of the DNA mixture, slowly pull the needle back to prevent back spills, and allow the DNA solution to diffuse for 30 s.\nTurn off the isoflurane, and place the pup on a 37 \u00b0C heating pad. Prepare the tweezer-type electrode for electroporation by dipping both ends into sterile 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: Wetting the tweezer-type electrode will prevent contact burns on the skin of the pup during administration of the electrical pulses.\nOrient the tweezer-electrode above the site of injection with the plus end facing downwards and the negative end above the animal's head (Figure 2D). Administer five electrical pulses from the electroporator with the following settings: 50 ms, 130 V, and 950 ms inter-pulse interval.\n\tNOTE: If needed, perform a test injection to ensure that the injection site is located on the cerebellar vermis (Figure 2E).\nPinch the incision closed, and seal the wound with a non-toxic n-butyl-ester cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Clean the wound with 70% ethanol as any trace amount of blood increases the likelihood of parental infanticide and cannibalism.\nAllow the animal to recover on a 37 \u00b0C heating pad before returning the pup to the dam. Monitor the pup(s) every 30 min for at least 2 h after the surgery to ensure full recovery.\u200bNOTE: Infanticide by either parent is quite common. To prevent cannibalism, house the sire in a different cage before starting the electroporation, and always return cleaned and recovered pups (i.e., no bloodstain, fully mobile) to the original cage on the original bedding. Pups can also be wiped with droppings from the original cage to minimize the smell of blood. The use of a surrogate dam may be necessary if the original dam continues to cannibalize her pups.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62568/62568fig2v2.jpg\nFigure 2: In vivo cerebellar electroporation of granule neuron progenitors in P7 wildtype mouse pups.

Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "The experimental protocol and procedures have received approval from the Administrative and Animal Research Committee of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Record number: 2022DL-010). Eight-week-old male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, weighing 180-200 g, were commercially obtained (see Table of Materials) and housed under a natural light/dark cycle with controlled temperature (23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) and relative humidity (55% \u00b1 10%). Twelve rats were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the AR group. All rats were acclimated to these conditions and provided with free access to food and water for one week before the trial.\n1. Establishment of a rat model of AR\nPreparing the sensitizing solution: suspend 30 mg of ovalbumin (OVA) and 3 g of Al(OH)3 in 100 mL of saline (see Table of Materials)14,15.\nBasic sensitization: grasp and hold the fully awake rat with its abdomen facing up. Disinfect the abdomen using 75% alcohol-soaked cotton balls. Use a 1.5 mL syringe to inject 1 mL of the sensitizing solution prepared in step 1.1 into the left abdominal cavity of the rats in the AR group. Repeat this injection once every two days for 14 days (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the rat's head is positioned lower than its tail to prevent damage to the large and small intestines when inserting the syringe. The injection site is located 1.5 cm from the ventral midline. Rats in the control group should receive intraperitoneal injections of 1 mL of normal saline once every two days for 14 days.\nNasal challenge: Administer 50 \u00b5L of 5% OVA via nasal drops using a 100 \u00b5L pipette (Figure 1B) on the day following the basal sensitization, repeating this procedure for 7 days (Figure 1C).\u200bNOTE: Prepare the 5% OVA solution by mixing 5 g of OVA with 100 mL of saline. For the control group, administer drops of the same volume of saline.\n2. Behavioral scoring of rats\nWithin 30 min after completing the final nasal challenge, observe and record the rats using a digital camera to identify symptoms such as nose scratching, sneezing, and a runny nose, based on the scoring criteria outlined in Table 1 (Figure 1D).\n\t\u200bNOTE: The confirmation of successful AR modeling is based on achieving a total score of \u22655 points14.\n3. Acquisition of nasal mucosa samples\nSacrificing rats: sacrifice the rats by exposing them to an overdose of CO2. Afterward, disinfect the rats with 75% ethanol (see Table of Materials). Use a scalpel to make an incision along the two corners of the mouth to expose the muscle tissue (Figure 2A). Next, cut the joints of the zygomatic bone and the mandible on both sides of the skull using tissue scissors (Figure 2B), and remove the mandible (Figure 2C).\nNasal cavity exposure: separate the skin of the maxilla using a hemostat (Figure 2D) to expose the nasal cavity (Figure 2E). Cut the bony connection between the nasal cavity and the maxilla with tissue scissors (Figure 2F). Then, sever the connection between the nasal cavity and the orbital bones on both sides at the infraorbital foramen (Figure 2G) and remove the nasal cavity (Figure 2H).\nFixation: place the extracted nasal cavity in 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation and store it at room temperature for 24-72 h (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the amount of paraformaldehyde fixative used is sufficient to completely cover the sections for proper fixation.\n4. Pre-processing of nasal mucosa samplesDecalcification: begin by fixing the removed tissues from step 3.1. Wash them three times with PBS for 20 min each. Follow this by washing them three times with distilled water, each time for 20 min. Subsequently, decalcify the tissues in a decalcification solution with a volume of 20-30 times that of the tissues at room temperature.\n\t\nThe decalcification solution (see Table of Materials) should maintain a pH of 7.2-7.4. Finally, place the decalcified tissue into a dehydration box.\n\t\tNOTE: The decalcifying solution needs to be changed weekly. The decalcification process can be concluded when the tissue softens (approximately 2 months).\nDehydration and waxing: transfer the dehydration box to a dehydrator (see Table of Materials). Begin with 75% alcohol for 4 h, followed by 85% alcohol for 2 h, 90% alcohol for 2 h, and 95% alcohol for 1 h.\n\t\nSubsequently, immerse the tissue in anhydrous ethanol for 30 min, repeat the process for another 30 min, use xylene for 5-10 min, repeat this step for another 5-10 min, immerse the tissue in wax for 1 h, repeat this step for another hour, and finally, immerse the tissue in wax for an additional 1 h.\nEmbedding: place the melted wax block into the embedding box (see Table of Materials) and store it in a -20 \u00b0C freezer. Once the wax solidifies, remove it and trim the wax block.\nSlicing: insert the trimmed wax block into a paraffin microtome (see Table of Materials) and cut it into slices with a thickness of 3 \u00b5m. Place the slices in a 40 \u00b0C water bath on a slide spreader. Flatten the tissue, then lift it with a glass slide and bake it in a 60 \u00b0C oven.After the water has evaporated, and the wax is properly set, remove the slides and store them at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C.\n5. H&E staining of nasal mucosal tissue\nDewaxing and hydration: place the slices in xylene for 20 min, repeat the process for another 20 min, absolute ethanol for 5 min, repeat this step for another 5 min, 75% alcohol for 5 min, and finally, wash for 5 min.\nHematoxylin staining: dispense 100 \u00b5L of hematoxylin staining solution (see Table of Materials) for 3-5 min using a 100 \u00b5L pipette, rinse for 5-10 s, add 100 \u00b5L of 0.5% hydrochloric acid ethanol for 10-30 s, rinse for 5-10 s, add 100 \u00b5L of 0.2% ammonia water for 10-30 s, and rinse for 30 s.\n\tNOTE: After hematoxylin staining, differentiation with 0.5% hydrochloric acid ethanol is necessary to remove excessive hematoxylin dye bound to the nucleus and absorbed by the cytoplasm. When eosin staining is performed, the nuclei and cytoplasm will be clearly stained. The slices will appear red or pink after differentiation with 0.5% hydrochloric acid ethanol, so rinse immediately after differentiation to remove the acid from the tissue slices to halt the differentiation. Then, use 0.2% ammonia water to enhance nuclear staining.\nEosin staining: use a 100 \u00b5L pipette to dispense 100 \u00b5L of eosin staining solution (see Table of Materials) for 5 min and rinse for 30 s.\nDehydration and sealing: immerse the slices in absolute ethanol for 5 min, repeat the process for another 5 min, repeat once more for 5 min, dimethyl for 5 min, and xylene for 5 min. Finally, seal with neutral resin (see Table of Materials).Placing the stained section on the microscope: position the stained section on the microscope, adjust the microscope's focus until the image is clearly visible, set the magnification to 40x, and capture the image.\n6. Multicolor immunostaining of nasal mucosal tissue\nDewaxing and hydration: follow the same as mentioned in step 5.1.\nCitrate-phosphate buffer treatment: place the citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) (see Table of Materials) into a microwave-safe container. Heat it until boiling, remove it, and then add the slides to the container. Microwave on medium heat for 8 min until boiling, turn off the heat for 8 min, and then switch to medium-low heat for 7 min.\n\t\nAfter natural cooling, transfer the slices to PBS (pH 7.4), shake, and wash them three times using a decolorizing shaker, each time for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the buffer does not evaporate during this process, and prevent the slices from drying out.\nBlocking endogenous peroxidase: dry the slices, draw a circle around the tissue with an immunohistochemical pen (to prevent the antibody from flowing away), and apply 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (hydrogen peroxide: pure water = 1:9).\n\t\nIncubate at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. After natural cooling, place the slices in PBS (pH 7.4) and shake them on a decolorizing shaker for three cycles of 5 min each.\nBlocking: apply 5% goat serum within the circle and incubate for 30 min.\nPrimary antibody addition: gently remove the blocking solution, add FOXP3 (dilution: 1:200, see Table of Materials) to the slice, and place it in a humid chamber. Incubate at 4 \u00b0C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Add a small amount of water to the humid chamber to prevent antibody evaporation.Secondary antibody addition: place the slices in PBS (pH 7.4) and shake them on a decolorizing shaker for three cycles of 5 min each. Gently dry the slices and apply the secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L, see Table of Materials) within the circle. Incubate at room temperature for 50 min in the dark.\nPreparation of Tyramide dilution solution: combine 100 \u00b5L of 3% H2O2 with 100 mL of 1x TBST (see Table of Materials).\nAddition of TSA working solution: Mix 1 mL of Tyramide diluent with 2 \u00b5L of CY3-Tyramide to prepare TSA working solution. Apply 100 \u00b5L of TSA working solution to each slice and incubate at room temperature in the dark for 10 min. Then, wash the slices with PBS three times, 5 min each time.\n\tNOTE: Prepare and use the TSA working solution immediately, and store it at 4 \u00b0C in the dark; it is valid for up to 24 h.\nRepeat Steps 6.2-6.8: switch to a 1:200 dilution of ROR\u03b3t (FITC fluorescent dye) and then to a 1:200 dilution of TICAM1 (TYP620 dye) (see Table of Materials).\nDAPI counterstained nuclei: shake the slices gently to dry them, apply DAPI staining solution, and incubate at room temperature for 10 min in the dark.\nQuenching autofluorescence: place the slices in PBS (pH 7.4) and shake them on a decolorizing shaker for three cycles of 5 min each. Apply the autofluorescence quencher (see Table of Materials) to the slices, wait for 5 min, and then wash for 10 min.\nBlocking: place the slices in PBS (pH 7.4) and shake them on a decolorizing shaker for three cycles of 5 min each. Gently shake the slices to dry them and seal them with the anti-fluorescence quencher (see Table of Materials).Microscopy: place the stained section on the microscope, adjust the microscope's focus for clear visibility, set the magnification to 20x and 40x, and capture the image.\n\tNOTE: DAPI has a UV excitation wavelength of 330-380 nm and an emission wavelength of 420 nm (blue light). FITC has an excitation wavelength of 465-495 nm and an emission wavelength of 515-555 nm (green light). CY3 has an excitation wavelength of 510-560 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm (red light). TYP-690 has an excitation wavelength of 630 nm and an emission wavelength of 690 nm (pink light).\nSubscription Required.

(certificate no. 2017-119). Prior to any animal studies, institutional approval should be obtained.\nNOTE: All surgical and anesthetic instruments/equipment and reagents recommended for successful surgical presentation and imaging of abdominal organs are detailed in Table 1.\n1. Preparation procedures for harvesting of rat kidneys\nIn preparation for surgery, place 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 200\u2013250 g) on a warming pad. Place a rectal thermometer probe in the rectum to monitor core temperature.\nAnesthetize the rat with a 5% mixture of isoflurane gas (induction: 5%, maintenance: 3%).\nTo start the operation, place the rat in a supine position after administration of anesthesia. Mount the four limbs of the rat on the operation table with tape.\nShave and clean the abdomen of the donor rat with germicidal soap. Apply 2% betadine for at least 1\u20132 min, and wipe with a 70% ethanol solution. Repeat this sequence three times.\nCover the operative field with a sterile fenestrated drape.\nMake a vertical abdominal incision and expose the left kidney, ureter, abdominal aorta, and inferior vena cava.\nVisualize and dissect the left kidney, ureter, abdominal aorta, and inferior vena cava just before cutting the pedicle.\n2. Transcardial perfusion\nBefore surgery, prepare the perfusion solution.\n\t\nMake 50 mL of perfusion solution per rat.\nMix 1x PBS with approximately 10 U/mL heparin (1 25 kU vial will make 2.5 L of PBS+Hep).\nMix equal volumes of 8% paraformaldehyde with 1x PBS to make the 4% PFA/1xPBS solution.NOTE: 8% PFA made in water can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 2 months. However, 4% PFA diluted in PBS is only stable for 1 week at 4 \u00b0C. Make the dilution fresh.\nExtend the vertical abdominal incision cranially. Be sure to draw the scissors away from the organs when cutting to avoid damaging the internal organs.\nContinue the incision through the rib cage, and then cut through the diaphragm by lifting the sternum.\nPin the loose flap of skin out of the way, and free the heart by tearing any connective tissue with the forceps.\n\tCAUTION: Do not use the scissors to free the heart and this could result in unwanted bleeding.\nOpen the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) line and ensure that the line is flowing before placing the needle into the left ventricle. Hold the heart gently with blunt forceps, and use a hemostat to control the needle. The needle should be inserted no more than 1/4 inch.\n\tNOTE: Insertion greater than 1/4 inch may result in perforation to the other side of the tissue.\nWhile supporting the heart with the needle and hemostat, locate the right atrium and snip through it with iridectomy scissors. Rest the hemostat on the rat\u2019s body, and make sure the needle is still positioned inside the heart.\n\tNOTE: If the cut is sufficient, there should be blood in the body cavity as the pressure from the PBS flowing into the rat is relieved.\nCarefully unpin the front feet and skin flap.\nContinue perfusing PBS for 4 min or longer if there is still blood visible in the kidney and liver.\n3. Kidney harvesting and decellularization\nHarvest the left kidney with the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava.Ligate the ureter, thoracic aorta, superior vena cava, and branches of the abdominal aorta.\nKeep the organ hydrated in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (DPBS) in a 10 cm Petri dish.\nCannulate the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava with a 23 Gauge catheter. To remove residual blood, connect the cannula with a peristaltic pump, and wash with DPBS (500 mL) and 16 U/mL heparin for 90 min at a rate of 5 rpm at 37 \u00b0C.\nTo decellularize the kidney, perfuse the kidney with 1% Triton X-100 (1 L) for 3 h and then with 0.75% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution (2 L) for 6 h at a constant pressure of 40 mmHg.\n\tNOTE: The kidney will become transparent after 8 h.\nTo remove residual SDS, perfuse the sample with 1% penicillin in distilled water (6 L) for 18 h (overnight) and then with sterile DPBS (500 mL) and 16 U/mL heparin for 90 min.\nSubscription Required.

These scores can be used to determine identities and cellular properties of single cells.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] Because the number of cells and gene signatures are high, we use parallel processing to accelerate the process. The timing of this step is reflected based on the glioma dataset,18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] which comprises around 6,000 cells.\nLoad the following R packages: 1) AUCell, 2) GSA, 3) doParallel, 4) GSVA, 5) effectsize.\nUse doParallel to call parallel processing for calculating signature scores for the five signature scoring tools (AUCell, JASMINE, SCSE, GSVA, ssGSEA; see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).For each tool, first load scRNAseq data into R using readRDS command. The RDS data object is saved in step 4 by removing gene names columns from the raw data.\n> GEdata\u00a0= readRDS(\u2018IDHAstrocytoma_GE_20210311.RDS\u2019)\nLoad the gene sets (C2, C3 and hallmarks) into R via GSA.read.gmt function from GSA package.\n> Genesets1\u00a0<- GSA.read.gmt('h.all.v7.2.symbols.gmt')\n> GSsize\u00a0= length(Genesets1$genesets)\n> Genesets2\u00a0<- GSA.read.gmt('c2.all.v7.2.symbols.gmt')\n> GSsize\u00a0= length(Genesets2$genesets)\n> Genesets3\u00a0<- GSA.read.gmt('c3.all.v7.2.symbols.gmt')\n> GSsize\u00a0= length(Genesets3$genesets)\nInitiate multiple threads with the registerDoParallel function and implement parallel processing by using dopar function.\nNote: We used 20 threads in this step for each signature scoring tool, except GSVA for which we used 200 threads.

The results are combined to get one file per tool.\nDivide the signature scores compiled in step 15 into tumor and normal cells using metadata file 'IDHAstrocytoma_Metadata.txt' saved in step 7.\n> Metadata\u00a0= read.table('IDHAstrocytoma_Metadata.txt',sep='\\t',head=T)\n> TumorCells\u00a0= Metadata$SampleID[which(Metadata$Clusters\u00a0== \"malignant\")]\n> NormalCells\u00a0= Metadata$SampleID[which(Metadata$Clusters\u00a0== \"Normal\")]\nCalculate effect size (ES) for each gene set using the tumor and normal cells scores from steps 15 and 16.\n> source(\u2018EScalculation.r\u2019)\nNote: Effect size is used to measure score differences between tumor and normal cells while controlling for score variance. Effect size is calculated using cohens_d function from the effectsize package. The code file used in this step will use combined data scores saved in step 15. The code snippet in step 16 is included in this code file.\nIdentify up regulated (ES   \u2265   1) and down regulated (ES   \u2264   -1) gene sets from step 17 for each signature scoring tool using the following codes.\nNote: These codes should be repeated for each tool. The file \u2018ES_AllMethods.txt\u2019 used to read ES values have been saved in step 17 and is used here for further processing. These cutoffs are arbitrary and thus can be tailored for different datasets.\n> EScheck\u00a0= read.table('ES_AllMethods.txt',sep='\\t',head=T)\n> EScheck\u00a0= EScheck[which(EScheck$GSsize\u00a0>\u00a020),]\n> ES_method_Up\u00a0= length(which(EScheck$ES >= 1))\n> ES_method_Dn\u00a0= length(which(EScheck$ES <= -1))\n> ESUp_Percentage\u00a0= ES_method_Up/nrow(EScheck) \u2217 100\n> ESDn_Percentage\u00a0= ES_method_Dn/nrow(EScheck) \u2217 100\nAssociate gene set sizes with ES for each tool using cor.test function. We used Spearman method, but Pearson or other methods can be used.

In this case, we used C2, C3 and hallmarks as 3 lists for all tools except GSVA where we divided them into 10 lists as they contain around 10,000 signatures in total. In our calculation we removed gene sets with less than 20 genes.\nCritical: GSVA is computationally less efficient than other tools used in this protocol. To obtain results within a reasonable time window, use 200 or more threads for big datasets and large lists of gene sets. In our experience, it took 5\u00a0days to complete the glioma data even when using 200 threads in parallel.\nDetection sensitivity\nTiming: 47 h\nThis step is to generate gold standard gene sets of various sizes to benchmark detection sensitivity for scRNAseq signature scoring. Gold standard gene sets consist of differentially expressed genes, either up or down, plus non-differentially expressed genes as noises. This step involves parallel processing using 10 threads, but more can be used to further reduce running time.

For each noise-gene set size combination, we randomly generated 200 gene sets.

To identify consensus up or down regulated gene sets, we use gene sets identified in step 18.

In analysis of large datasets like scRNAseq, it is important to design time and space efficient tools.\nImpact of dropouts on single cell scoring\nTiming: 6 h\nDropouts are the main reason for scRNAseq data sparsity.24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24] Dropouts arise from a low amount of input materials in sequencing and stochastic transcription. To check the effect of dropouts on scRNAseq signature scoring, we will simulate dropouts by down sampling scRNAseq data at different levels. The difference in signature scores between the down sampled cells and the original cells reflects the impact of dropouts on each tool.\nRun down sampling experiment at different rates using the following code.\n> data\u00a0= readRDS(\u2018IDHAstrocytoma_GE_20210311.RDS\u2019)\n> dataDN_Samp20\u00a0= downsampleMatrix(data, 0.2, bycol\u00a0= TRUE)\n> dataDN_Samp40\u00a0= downsampleMatrix(data, 0.4, bycol\u00a0= TRUE)\n> dataDN_Samp60\u00a0= downsampleMatrix(data, 0.6, bycol\u00a0= TRUE)\n> dataDN_Samp80\u00a0= downsampleMatrix(data, 0.8, bycol\u00a0= TRUE)Note: The down sampling rates can be customized. We use 4 different rates (20%, 40%, 60% and 80%) for this protocol.

Crude Dauer Pheromone Production\nGrow OP50 E. coli from a single colony O/N at 37 \u00b0C while shaking in 100 ml of LB broth at 200 rpm. NOTE: This O/N culture can be made in advance and stored at 4 \u00b0C.\nGrow N2 C. elegans on 15 - 20 6 cm Petri dishes with NGM agar (See recipe in Table 1) seeded with 50 \u00b5l of OP50 E. coli until the bacteria is almost depleted19.\nMake 5x 250 ml of S media (See recipe in Table 1) in 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks19. NOTE: This solution can be made in advance.\nGrow a culture of OP50 E. coli in 4 L of LB broth O/N by inoculating with 1 ml of OP50 in E. coli and shaking at 37 \u00b0C for 16 hr.\nWash the nematodes from plates (step 1.2) with 1 ml of S basal solution (See recipe in Table 1) and transfer nematodes from 4-5 plates into each of 4 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks with the S media prepared in Step 1.3 (4-5 plates for each flask)19.\nCentrifuge the OP50 from step 1.4 at 650 x g for 10 min and remove supernatant. Resuspend each bacterial pellet in 10 ml of S basal solution. Transfer equal amounts of resuspended bacteria to each flask of nematodes.\nPlace the flasks on an orbital shaker at room temperature (20 - 25 \u00b0C) and 100 - 150 rpm for 4 - 5 days until the solution begins to clear, indicating a depletion of food.Once the food is depleted, grow another O/N culture of OP50 E. coli in 4x 1 L of LB broth. Centrifuge the bacteria at 650 x g for 10 min and add a pellet from one flask to each of the S media flasks with nematodes. Return the S media flasks to the orbital shaker, as in step 1.7, for an additional 3-4 days until the food is depleted again.\nTake a ~1 ml aliquot of solution from each flask and estimate the nematode concentration by sub-sampling 1 \u00b5l from each 1 ml aliquot and counting the number of nematodes. NOTE: The nematode population should be 50,000 - 75,000 nematodes/ml. At this concentration the majority of nematodes are dauers.\nDiscard any contaminated flasks. NOTE: Contamination frequently manifests as fungal hyphae seen during step 1.9.\nCentrifuge nematodes at 4,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Discard the nematode pellet and retain the supernatant. Alternatively, see the discussion for using these animals to make a low-potency pheromone.\nFilter the supernatant through #1 Whatman filter paper. NOTE: A vacuum flask will expedite this process.\nFurther filter the supernatant through 0.45 \u00b5m sterile vacuum filtration units. NOTE: Filtrate can be kept O/N at 4 \u00b0C or proceed to 1.14.Add the filtrate to a 2 L beaker with a stir bar. Place in a fume hood on a heating stir plate. Bring to a boil while stirring and evaporate to approximately 200 ml. Transfer the solution to a 500 ml beaker. Continue boiling until approximately 50 ml are left. NOTE: Care should be taken during this step as it is possible for the solution to boil over. The color of the final 50 ml is a dark brown. At any time during the cooking process, the heat can be turned off and the filtrate stored O/N at RT or 4 \u00b0C.\nLet cool and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g. Pour the supernatant into a 100 ml beaker and discard the pellet.\nBoil the supernatant down to a brown crust. Remove from heat and break up the crust with a spatula. Add sufficient 200 proof ethanol to cover the crust. Cover the beaker with Parafilm and let it sit O/N at RT. Pour off the ethanol into a clean beaker and put to the side. Add fresh ethanol to cover the crust. Repeat O/N extractions 3 times. Pool the extracts.\nUse a vacuum pump to dry the ethanol extracts. If a vacuum pump is not available, add the ethanol extract to a clean beaker and warm to 50 \u00b0C while stirring in a fume hood. NOTE: Once the ethanol has evaporated a sticky residue of light brown color should remain. If heating is used, care should be taken to not burn the solution by heating for too long.Dissolve residue in 10 ml of distilled sterile water. Filter sterilize this solution with a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filter and store at -20 \u00b0C in 1 ml aliquots. NOTE: 1 ml of water is used for dissolving the residue for every 100 ml of the original liquid nematode culture. For example, if one of the liquid culture flasks is discarded due to contamination, then adjust the amount of water used to dissolve the residue.\n2. Determination of Pheromone Dose Response\nPrepare dauer pheromone by making 6x 5 ml of NGM media with Noble agar, without peptone, and supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin sulfate and a range of dauer pheromone (see recipe in Table 1)4, 19.   Mix components in a 13x100 mm glass culture tube, boil over a Bunsen burner, and then pour into 3 cm Petri dishes.\nWeigh a microcentrifuge tube.  Add 1 ml of O/N culture of E. coli OP50 to the tube and centrifuge at ~17,000 x g in a microcentrifuge tube.  Remove all of the supernatant.  Weigh the tube again and determine the weight of the bacterial pellet.  Resuspend the pellet with M9 buffer (See recipe in Table 1) for a final concentration of 4% (w/v).  Aliquot 10 \u00b5l of the bacterial suspension onto the center of each pheromone plate4.  Store plates O/N at RT.\nPick 10-15 gravid N2 wild-type hermaphrodites one day after the molt into adulthood onto the pheromone plates4.  Store the plates at 25 \u00b0C for 3 - 4 hr.\nPick off all of the adult hermaphrodites.  Record the number of eggs laid for each plate. Seal the plates with Parafilm and return to 25 \u00b0C for 3 days17.Count the percentage of dauers (Figure 2).  Note: For both methods it is important to note that dauers (and to a lesser extent non-dauers) will climb up the walls and onto the lid of Petri dishes. It is therefore important to examine all surfaces of the dish for nematodes.\nFit the data to a dose-response curve and estimate the EC90 concentration of pheromone (sufficient pheromone to induce 90% of animals to form dauers) as shown in Figure 3. Note: We typically use a logistic regression model to estimate the EC90, but different statistical software packages may have alternative methods that produce similar estimates.\n3. Live Imaging of Dauer IL2 Neurons\u200b\nPrepare dauer pheromone plates as in protocol 2 using the EC90 value determined in step 2.6.\nInduce dauers using the methods in protocol 2 with a strain carrying an integrated IL2 reporter transgene (myIs13[Pklp-6::gfp], myIs14[Pklp-6::gfp], myIs16[Pklp-6::tdTomato] or qIs56[Plag-2::gfp])12, 20, 21. NOTE: If qIs56 is used, expression of GFP will not be visible in the IL2Qs until several hours into the dauer molt and some of the initial remodeling events will not be visible. Additionally, while the fluorescent signal from the Plag-2::gfp transgene is ultimately brighter in the IL2s during dauer than the Pklp-6 fluorescentreporters, the Plag-2::gfp transgene also expresses weakly in the head muscles which can mask the fine IL2 branches.\nFollowing egg-laying, remove the adult hermaphrodites, seal the plates with Parafilm and incubate for 34 hr at 25 \u00b0C17. NOTE: The length of time to the dauer molt varies slightly among individuals. The most rapid period of dendrite arborization begins 4 - 5 hr following the onset of the dauer molt (39 - 44 hr post egg-laying at 25 \u00b0C)12.The day before imaging, make up a solution of 10% (w/v) agarose in M9 buffer with dauer pheromone at the EC90 concentration. Aliquot approximately 100 \u00b5l of agarose onto a microscope slide and quickly, but gently, place another slide on top to create a flat agarose surface. After the agarose has solidified, wrap the slides in saran wrap and store in a humidity chamber (pipette tip box with wet paper towels).\nAfter the 34 hr incubation period, examine pheromone plates for nematodes that have stopped pharyngeal pumping. Separate slides such that only one surface of one slide has agarose on it. Pick one or more nematodes onto a 10% agarose pad and 1 \u00b5l of 0.1 micron polystyrene beads22. NOTE: With a well-synchronized population, the majority of the nematodes on the plate will be entering into the molt from L2d to dauer. However, there may be variation among individuals. It is therefore important to note additional features (stoma occlusion, pharyngeal remodeling) to estimate the amount of time the animals have been within the dauer molt (see representative results for example).\nDetermine the orientation (left/right, dorsal/ventral) of the nematode. Capture Z-stack images of an IL2Q dendrite at 100x magnification with the lowest possible fluorescence intensity every 15 min or as needed for the specific experiment. Continue capturing images until the nematode has separated from the L2d cuticle and immobilization is impossible or if the animal recovers from dauer (pharynx begins pumping). When not actively imaging, place the slide in a humidity chamber. NOTE: We use an epifluorescent microscope with a motorized stage and differential interference contrast (DIC) optics.\nSubscription Required.

Establishment of RTX Neuropathy\nCAUTION: RTX is neurotoxic and hazardous. On contact, it acts as an irritant to the eyes, mucous membranes, and upper respiratory tract. Avoid inhalation and wear lab eyeglasses and coats during RTX preparation. Rinse with plenty of water in case of skin contact or after handling.\nAdd 1 mg of RTX powder to a 200 \u00b5L of mixture of equal volume of Tween 80 and absolute ethanol (100 \u00b5L for each solvent).\nAliquot the RTX solution (12 \u00b5L/vial) and store at -20 \u00b0C, for up to 3 months. This constitutes the RTX stock; discard the remaining RTX solution at expiration.\nDilute the RTX stock with normal saline to a final volume of 600 \u00b5L. The final concentration of the RTX solution should be 0.01%, which equals 1 \u00b5g RTX in 10 \u00b5L vehicle solution.\nUse 8-week-old adult male ICR mice (35-40 g) as experimental animals and administer a single dose of RTX solution (dose: 200, 50, and 10 \u00b5g/kg, respectively) intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a microinjection syringe to the mice.\u00a0Mice was anesthetized by inhaler with 5 % isoflurane for deep anesthesia. If mice showed withdrawal action of extremities during RTX injection, mice should take longer inhalation of anesthesia.\u00a0\u00a0\n\tExample: If the mouse weighs 40 g, then it will receive 20 \u00b5L of the RTX solution, representing the dose of 50 \u00b5g/kg.\nGive one group of mice an equal volume of vehicle (10% Tween 80 and 10% absolute ethanol in saline solution), as a control.After RTX injection, return the mice to a plastic cage on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and provide food and water ad libitum.\n2. Evaluation of Neuropathic Behavior\nNOTE: Maintain the animals in a comfortable environment (step 1.6) to allow recovery after injection. At day 7 post RTX injection (D7), each animal performs the hot plate and von Frey hair filament tests on the same day to reduce time bias and promote the efficiency of the behavioral tests. Bring the animals to a quiet room that is maintained at a stable humidity (40%) and temperature (27 \u00b0C) for optimizing animal acclimatization and reducing environmental effects during the behavioral testing. Do not disturb the animals during test periods; the behavioral tests are scheduled weekly.\nMeasurement of thermal latencies with the hot plate test\n\t\nPlace the animal gently on a metal hot plate (27 cm \u00d7 29 cm) with a transparent Plexiglas cage (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height: 22 cm \u00d7 22 cm \u00d7 25 cm; Figure 1A). Set the temperature of the metal hot plate to 52 \u00b0C.\nStart measuring the duration of the animal's thermal latency on the hot plate with the step-on, built-in timer of the hot plate once the animal's hindpaws touch the hot plate, and observe the responses of the animal's hindpaws. If the animal shows shaking, licking of hindpaws, or jumping while on the hot plate, remove it and record the duration that the animal remained on the hot plate. This time duration defines the thermal latency of an individual animal. Record the thermal latency to the nearest 0.1 s.For each test session, perform three trials with 30-min intervals for response normalization after the last hot plate test. If the animal shows no response on the hot plate, stop the session after 25 s to avoid potential tissue damage.\nMeasurement of mechanical threshold with the von Frey hair filament test\n\t\nPut the animal on the customized metal mesh (mesh size: 5 mm \u00d7 5 mm) with a semi-transparent cylinder Plexiglas cage (diameter: 13 cm; height: 12 cm) (Figure 1B) for acclimatization for at least 2 h.\nApply the different calibers of the von Frey hair filaments to the plantar region of the hindpaw with the up-and-down method31. Start initial application from the middle force of a set of von Frey hair filaments for a duration of filament application of 5-8 s.\nUse a 2 min interval between filament applications to optimize animal normalization. Change the applied filament force based on the animal's last response.\n\t\tNOTE: A set of von Frey hair filaments consists of 0.064, 0.085, 0.145, 0.32, 0.39, 1.1, and 1.7 g force application. For example, if hindpaw withdrawal occurred with an initial force of 0.32 g, then apply 0.145 g. In the absence of paw withdrawal, a 0.39 g force is then applied. Then four additional filaments of varying forces are applied based on the preceding responses and the mechanical threshold is calculated according to a published formula31.\nFor each test session, include the bilateral hindpaws. Perform three trials for each hindpaw. Express the average of these six mechanical thresholds as the mean mechanical threshold (mg) of each animal.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56651/56651fig1.jpgFigure 1.

Insert the coverslip into the vacuum chamber twice for 20 min each time, and leave PDL O/N to dry.\nPrepare Petri dish to create a supporting cell network:\n\t\nCover the surface of the dish (3.5 cm) with 1 ml of PDL for 2 hr in RT. Remove the PDL drop using a pipette.\nWash with distilled water and leave to dry. Place a very small drop of silicone grease on each corner of the coverslip.\nPlace the coverslip on the center of the Petri dish (i.e., the PDMS should be facing up) and press gently to verify attachment.\nGently remove PDMS from coverslip using tweezers. For sterilization, expose to UV illumination for 7 min.\n3. Multi-Electrode Array (MEA) Preparation\nClean MEA in this order (Table of Materials):\n\t\nWash with water under tap and sonicate in a concentrated, enzymatic detergent 3 times.\nSonicate in distilled water 3 times.\nWash with distilled water (in hood, 1,000 \u00b5l tip) for 3 times and place under UV for 30 min.\nSupporting network preparation:\n\t\nPrepare the designed support network mold.\n\t\t\nPour PDMS into a 12-well plate (22 mm diameter).\nWhen the PDMS is hardened take out the mold and using a scalpel, cut a hole in the middle to create a ring shape.\nPlace a designed support network mold on the center of the MEA (Figure 2A) and cover the rest of the surface with PDL for 2 hr at RT.\nRemove PDL using pipette and wash with distilled water.\nRemove the mold and leave to dry (Figure 2A).\nAlign stencil to MEA in the following way:Place stencil on designated micro manipulator. Use an inverted microscope to accurately align patterned structure to electrodes, and lower the stencil until it is placed on the MEA surface (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNote: Contact with a well cleaned MEA provides competitive adhesion between the PDMS and the MEA itself.\nLift the micromanipulator and if needed, use tweezers to apply a small amount of pressure above the PDMS to prevent it detaching from the MEA.\nGently press stencil to MEA surface, and use microscope to verify it is firmly attached, and well aligned. (Figure 2C-D).\nPlace MEA in vacuum chamber for 15 min; put a 1 ml drop of PDL on stencil.\nInsert into vacuum chamber 2 times for 20 min each. Leave PDL to dry O/N in the incubator.\nBefore plating, remove the PDMS stencils from MEAs and wash using sterile water. Place under UV illumination for 7 min.\n4. Dissection and Culture\nPrepare cultures as described in Herzog et al. 2011 21.\n5. Plating\nCalculate number of cells needed for plating, using a hemocytometer (optimal density according to the size of the circuit as discussed in the result).\n\t\nMake sure the counting chamber (hemocytometer) is clean and place a cover slip on it (use alcohol to clean).\nDilute 10 \u00b5l of the cell suspension in 190 \u00b5l of plating medium (dilution 1:20).\nLoad 10 \u00b5l of the diluted cells onto the edge of the counting chamber and slowly pipette the cells out allowing the chamber to fill itself.\nUsing an inverted microscope, visualise the haemocytometer grid. Determine the number of cells in the chamber by direct counting (healthy cells should be round). Count the cells within the large square without those crossing the edges.\nCalculate the concentration of cells:Total number of cells/1000 \u00b5l = Total cells counted \u00d7 dilution factor \u00d7 104 (area of the hemocytometer).\n\t\tNote: For example, if the dilution factor was 20 and the total cells counted were 100:\n\t\t100 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 104 = 0.1 x 107 cells/1,000 \u00b5l or 1 x 106/100 \u00b5l. In order to plate 0.75 x 106 cells, take 75 \u00b5l out of the cells.\nTake the number of cells needed for plating per single MEA or Petri dish, resuspend the cells to prevent aggregation, and plate them at the center, on top of the patternate area (if needed, it is possible to dilute the cells in the medium). For the MEA, place a 100 \u00b5l drop in the middle. For cover slip, place a 1,000 \u00b5l drop in the middle.\nIncubate the plated cells at 37 \u00b0C for 40 min. Add plating medium to the plated cells, up to 1 ml per MEA and 2 ml per cover slip.\nKeep at 37 \u00b0C and, every 4 days, dilute with fresh growth medium enriched with 0.5 Pen-Strep, 2% B-27 and 0.75% glutamax.\nFrom 6/7 DIV, after seeing connections between the islands, dilute medium with 10 \u00b5l/ml FUDR (25 mg deoxyuridine + 62.5 mg uridine in 12.5 ml MEM (Minimum Essential Medium Eagle)) or any other anti-mitotic agent to prevent glial overgrowth.\nSubscription Required.

Patient evaluation\nClinical evaluation\n\t\nEvaluate patients clinically to rule out symptoms propagating from other anatomical regions or other associated pathology in the shoulder that may be the source of symptoms.\nInclude shoulder inspection and palpation, evaluate the active and passive range of motion, and perform pain provocative maneuvers and integrity tests. In addition, evaluate the cervical spine and the elbow joint.\nRadiological evaluation\n\t\nUse radiographic anteroposterior (AP) projections, a lateral scapular view, and an axillary view of the shoulder.\nClassify the calcifications by their evolutionary stage according to G\u00e4rtner6. Request an MRI to rule out any associated pathology in the shoulder.\nInclusion criteria\n\t\nInclude patients classified as having G\u00e4rtner type I and II calcifications who have undergone at least 3 months of previous conservative treatment without result.\nNever inject corticosteroids into the subacromial space when treating rotator cuff tendinopathy, as they have a deleterious effect on the elastic fibers of the tendons40,41.\nExclusion criteria: Do not include patients with G\u00e4rtner type III calcifications or other associated pathology in the affected shoulder.\n2. Application technique\nPatient positioning: Position the patient comfortably and in a way that allows exposure to the area to be treated.\n\t\nSupraspinatus or infraspinatus tendon location: Treat by placing the patient in the supine or sitting position.\nSubscapularis: Treat by placing the patient in the supine position.\nTeres minor: Treat by placing the patient in the sitting, lateral decubitus, or oblique decubitus position for better access to the posterior aspect of the shoulder.\nCoupling pads\n\tNOTE: Three pad sizes are available, each determining a specific depth of treatment focus (Figure 1).Select a coupling pad size depending on the required penetration depth of the focused point (Table 1). The selection of the coupling pad varies in shoulder calcification cases according to patient's build and location. The most frequently used sizes are large and medium.\nLocation of the area to be treated: Locate the area to be treated, considering anatomical landmarks and, if necessary, with the help of ultrasound images (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: It is very important to locate the exact area of the calcification and to focus the treatment on it4,42. The use of anatomical references and the help of ultrasound localization allows identifying the correct location. The need for a diagnostic ultrasound to locate the area is disputed, as there are studies that have not found significant differences with its use43. The application of focused waves is risky if done on large vessels and nerves or in areas close to the pleura44. Anatomical approaches that avoid these structures should be used.\nOperator positioning: The use of this type of device implies the support of an applicator by the operator. Work in an ergonomic position.\n\tNOTE: The operator must always be aware of the condition of the patient, as exceptional cases of fainting during treatment have been reported44.\nAnesthesia: Do not use anesthesia. The use of local anesthesia is contraindicated because the presence of fluids alters the acoustic impedance of the tissue. In general, tolerance to treatment with this type of device is good, even when working with high energy levels.\nContact gel: Apply adequate contact gel to the skin in the area to be treated.Navigation controls: Turn on the computer and access the touch screen. Select the Manual option at the top of the screen. The controls of the various treatment parameters are displayed. Use the rotary selection knob to set the parameters, including the intensity, frequency, and number of shocks.\nIntensity: Set the initial intensity of the treatment. The energy flux density (EFD) is graduated in the device used in millijoules per square millimeter of tissue (mJ/mm2).\n\t\nIncrease the intensity progressively as tolerated by the patient. Start with low intensity. Reach at least an energy level above 0.40 mJ/mm2 to obtain reproducible results19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. The mean maximum intensity used is 0.50 mJ/mm2.\nFrequency: Select the frequency to be used. The equipment has a frequency between 1-25 Hz. Use 4-6 Hz.\nNumber of shocks: Select the number of shocks to be applied using the rotary selection knob. Apply at least 4,000 shocks per session.\nModification of parameters during treatment: Modify the frequency and especially the intensity during the application. Use the display located on the applicator head to easily modify the application parameters during the treatment without having to interrupt it.\nThe interval between sessions: Carry out three sessions at weekly intervals.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64426/64426fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Applicator and coupling pad variations.

Post-treatment protocolAfter the first session, alert the patients that in approximately 5% of cases, they may suffer an acute resorption process with intense pain. If discomfort occurs, recommend the patient to apply ice to the areas of pain in short sessions of no more than 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Paracetamol is preferred over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Shock waves modulate the inflammatory process, and it is better not to alter it by other means while the treatment lasts.\nImmobilization: It is not necessary to immobilize the treated limb. Advise the patient to avoid extreme efforts and range of motions that may cause pain.\nRehabilitation program\n\t\nAs the sessions progress, if tolerance is good, increase the range of movement and incorporate exercises to strengthen the depressors of the humeral head.\nIf symptomatic relapses do not occur, include recovery exercises for the extreme ranges of movement. The strengthening of the three portions of the deltoid and the scapular stabilizers are also indicated.\nRadiological follow-up:\n\t\nPerform the first radiographic examination at 6 weeks after the sessions and the second one at 12 weeks. In the case of observing a partial resorption process that has not been completed after 12 weeks, continue the radiological follow-up.\nIf there have been no changes, opt for a new treatment module or move on to invasive procedures.\n\t\tNOTE: In many patients, very important changes can be seen in the first control x-ray. In other cases, variable changes can be seen from baseline studies, and there may be no change even on long-term radiographs in other cases.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with an animal protocol approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Strains of male and female swine undergoing HC placement include miniature swine from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) swine colony, Yucatan swine, and Yorkshire-crossed swine from an agricultural vendor (20-40 kg). Swine ranged from 3-10 months of age when the HC was placed. The HC may be placed anytime relative to the animal's experimental procedure. However, it is recommended to place it beforehand to permit the collection of baseline blood values. It is also recommended to give the swine at least a 1 week acclimation period before undergoing any experimental manipulation.\n1. Preoperative planning\nPrior to surgery, have a veterinarian perform a thorough clinical evaluation of all the animals.\nFast the animals (no solid food) at least 12 h prior to the procedure. Provide water ad libitum at all times. Weigh the animals for controlled drug administration.\nOn the day of surgery, sedate the animals with ketamine (20-30 mg/kg) and xylazine (2-3 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM]) mixed into a single syringe. If necessary, administer sedative agents (ketamine and xylazine) slowly intravenously [IV]. Use a sterile ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to prevent desiccation while under anesthesia.\nPlace an intravenous catheter in a marginal ear vein and administer maintenance fluid at 5-10 mL/(kg\u2219h) of 0.9% saline or lactated ringers solution (LRS) throughout the procedure.\nWhen the animal is in dorsal recumbency, place an appropriately sized endotracheal tube,\u00a0connect it to the anesthesia machine, and place on\u00a0hand ventilation\u00a0(maintained on isoflurane at 0.5-3% with 1-2 L O2/min).Administer preemptive analgesia (0.02 mg/kg buprenorphine IV); administer additional doses of buprenorphine intraoperatively as needed. Administer prophylactic antibiotics (20-22 mg/kg cefazolin IV) 10 min before the start of the surgery and again every 90 min intraoperatively. Administer protonix (0.5-1.0 mg/kg IV) and maropitant citrate (1 mg/kg IV) once prior to the start of surgery.\nShave the ventral and dorsal neck, which will serve as the site for the placement of the central venous catheter. Perform preliminary preparation of the surgical area using chlorhexidine scrub.\nConfirm that the pig is within an appropriate plane of surgical anesthetic. Evaluate the anesthetic depth by testing the palpebral and jaw tone. If necessary, increase the inhalant anesthetic or administer additional sedative agents (such as ketamine) IV slowly to effect.\nTransfer the swine to the operating table.\n2. Intraoperative monitoring\nWhile under maintenance anesthesia, continuously monitor the heart rate and electrocardiography, the noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, capnography, and the esophageal or rectal temperature, recording at least every 15 min.\n\t\nNoninvasively monitor the blood pressure via a blood pressure cuff on an extremity or the tail.\nUse a ventilator to more accurately regulate the breathing and inhalant anesthesia administration. For ventilator parameters, ensure that tidal volume is in the range of 5-10 mL/kg. Adjust the respiratory rate throughout the procedure in response to the animal's anesthetic depth; set the maximum pressure limit to 20 mmHg.\nUse a temperature-regulated warm-air blanket or pad throughout the operation to prevent hypothermia.\n3. Surgical preparation\nDesignate at least two people to be sterile (surgeon and assistant) and at least two people to be non-sterile (circulator and anesthetist).\nUnder general anesthesia, position the swine in ventral recumbency on the operating table with its legs secured for stabilization (Figure 1).Aseptically prepare the surgical field with three alternating scrubs of chlorhexidine and 70% ethanol, followed by an ionophore on the surface of the skin for a minimum contact time of 10 min. Carry out a sterile prep of the following two areas:\n\t\nOn the ventral side, extend from the angle of the mandible to the middle of the sternum and extend bilaterally to the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid. Place sterile towels along the borders of the sterilely-prepped area.\nOn the dorsal side, prepare the dorsolateral neck ipsilateral to the target IJV. Place sterile towels beneath the dorsal neck and overtop the dorsal field to maintain sterility while working in the ventral field.\nPlace a sterile drape over the swine. Cut a rectangular area in the drape to expose the ventral field.\nOn a separate sterile-draped table, connect the double-lumen HC to a long introducer piece.\n\t\nScrew claves onto luer lock adapters at the end of each lumen line (wide: red; narrow: white). Flush the red and white lines with 10 mL of 0.9% saline. Then, clamp both lines.\n4. Internal jugular vein identification and preparation\nIn the ventral field, make a 4 cm incision between the trachea and the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid (Figure 2). Divide the platysma and dissect the connective tissue to reveal the IJV on the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nIsolate 3-4 cm of the IJV by dividing its branches with 4-0 coated and braided non-absorbable suture ties. Circumferentially dissect away from the surrounding connective tissue. Create two coated and braided non-absorbable suture ties to suspend and stabilize the IJV during catheter insertion (Figure 3).\n\t\nAt the cranial end of the IJV, pass a coated and braided non-absorbable suture tie twice underneath the vessel to create a loop around it.At the caudal end of the IJV, pass a coated and braided non-absorbable suture tie once underneath the vessel to create a sling.\nRelease traction from the suture ties. Place sterile saline-soaked gauze in the surgical site to protect the vessel and maintain the tie location.\n5. Catheter exit site preparation\nReposition the swine via lateral tilt toward the non-surgical side to expose the ipsilateral dorsal surgical field. Resecure the limbs (Figure 4).\nWith a #10 blade scalpel, make a 0.5 cm puncture in the skin at the desired catheter exit site-3 cm lateral to the vertebral column and 5 cm caudal to the head (Figure 5).\n6. Introduction and tunneling of the catheter\nIn the ventral field, remove the wet gauze and reidentify the isolated IJV segment. Choose a target entry site to introduce the catheter subcutaneously. Ensure that this is at the same depth as the IJV, deeper than the sternocleidomastoid, and between the two coated and braided non-absorbable suture ties (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE:\u00a0Subcuticular patterns should have suture knots buried below the skin. Because the deep dermal sutures are knotted several times to ensure stability and maintenance, they occasionally occupy a larger space than desired and may be exposed through the skin. This small area of exposure is not of significant concern, and the skin should heal appropriately despite this small area of exposure.\nPosition the dominant hand in the dorsal surgical field and the non-dominant hand in the ventral surgical field. Hold the HC introducer in the dorsal surgical field. Suspend the remaining length of the catheter in the air above the sterile field.\nInsert the introducer into the exit puncture site with the dominant hand, pointing the tip of the device toward the non-dominant hand in the ventral field.Push the tip of the introducer superficially and medially to tunnel the catheter through the adipose tissue, feeling for the emergence of the tip with the nondominant hand. Once the tip emerges at the target entry site, pull the introducer and catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel until the cuff of the main line is just underneath the surface of the skin in the dorsal field.\nCut the introducer from the line. Replace the wet gauze in the ventral surgical site.\n7. Insertion of the catheter\nReposition the swine in the supine position. Resecure the limbs, replace sterile gloves, and remove the gauze from the ventral surgical site.\nClamp the ends of the cranial and caudal coated and braided non-absorbable suture ties. Rest the clamps on the drapes so that the IJV segment is slightly elevated.\nCut the end of the catheter to approximately the length at which it would reach down to 1/3 of the length of the swine's sternum.\n\tNOTE: Minimize manipulation of the catheter tip by transecting the tip with a single cut perpendicular to the line so as to avoid fragmentation or clogging of the line. Once inserted, the HC should lie within the superior vena cava, immediately cranial to the right atrium (Figure 7).\u00a0\nUsing Adson-Brown forceps, grasp the middle of the isolated IJV segment. At that same point, make a cut halfway through the vessel with curved Metzenbaum scissors.\nWhile holding the IJV segment with the Adson-Brown forceps, insert the vein pick into the caudal segment of the vessel (Figure 6). While maintaining tension on the cranial suture tie, insert and thread the end of the catheter into the vessel caudally. Once the catheter is fully inserted, knot the caudal suture tie once to temporarily secure the HC.Test the patency of both lines outside the sterile field via blood draws and flushes using 3-5 mL of 0.9% normal saline followed by 5 mL of 100 USP units/mL heparinized saline.\nOnce patency is confirmed, knot the caudal suture tie one or two times more to secure the distal IJV segment around the intravenous catheter. Knot the cranial suture tie once to occlude blood flow in the IJV segment.\nClose the ventral surgical site in layers: platysma simple interrupted sutures with a 3-0 braided absorbable\u00a0suture, and subcuticular running sutures with a 3-0 monofilament absorbable suture.\n8. Securing the catheter\nUndrape the swine and reposition in dorsal recumbency. Resecure the limbs.\nSecure the HC to the animal's skin at more than three points to avoid catheter detachment (Figure 8).\n\t\nOrient the HC so that it forms a \"U\" shape.\nIdentify the points: ensure that the first point is within 2 cm of the exit site, the second point is over the forked portion of the catheter, where the red and white lines diverge, and the third point is at the top of the \"U\" between the first two points.\nAt each point, place a ~3 cm piece of 1 inch (in) medical tape over the catheter to create a wing on each side. With a 0 synthetic, monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene suture, secure each wing to the skin via a single simple interrupted suture. At the second point over the forked portion, add a single interrupted suture through the gap between the two lines and ensure that the knot lies on top of the tape to prevent irritation.NOTE:\u00a0Depending on the size of the dorsal neck puncture site, a simple interrupted suture may be placed to decrease the size and minimize the risk of inadvertent catheter displacement out of the skin. Ensure that the cuff around the catheter remains subcutaneous.\nTest the patency of both the white and red lines outside the sterile field via blood draws and flushes using 10 mL of 0.9% normal saline and 10 mL of heparinized saline.\nCreate a protective collar.\n\t\nWrap 4 in cotton padding around the neck three of four times in the following manner:\n\t\t\nStarting on the dorsal neck at the left-cranial corner, wrap diagonally toward the right-caudal corner, going above or below the red and white lines. Wrap underneath the neck toward the left-caudal corner. Wrap diagonally toward the right-cranial corner, above or below the red and white lines, and then wrap to the start point at the left-cranial corner. Alternate going above and below the red and white lines with each subsequent wrap.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The collar should completely cover the skin attachment sites and main line of the HC. Only the red and white lines should be left out and accessible.\nWrap 3 or 4 in elastic adhesive tape around the neck three or four times in the same manner as the cotton padding (step 8.4.1). If the bandage covers the lines, create a slit in the bandage to accommodate them.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care to not wrap this layer too tightly-a finger should be able to be easily slid under the protective collar circumferentially.\nWith a 0 synthetic, monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene suture, suture each corner at the end of the bandage to the underlying layers to maintain its position.With a 0 synthetic, monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene suture, secure the collar to the skin by tying a horizontal mattress suture lateral to the vertebral column on both the cranial and caudal end. Ensure that the knots lie on top of the bandage.\nCreate a catheter pouch to protect and store the red and white lines (Figure 9).\n\t\t\nCut a piece of elastic adhesive tape measuring ~100 cm in length and ~7.5 cm in width.\nMeasure a ~16 cm segment of tape. Fold the tape over on itself so that the adhesive sides are facing each other to create a 16 cm flap with two layers of tape. With the remaining tape, repeat this process two more times to create three flaps of equal length in a \"W\" shape (Figure 10).\nFold the remaining tail of tape over the edge of the three flaps. With the tail oriented on top, number the flaps 1-3 from top to bottom. Number the sides 1-4, starting from the tail edge and moving clockwise.\nOn Side 4, remove a lengthwise sliver from Flap 2, excluding 1 cm on either end. Ensure that the width of the sliver is ~1 cm.\nUsing a 0 coated and braided non-absorbable suture to perform running sutures: stitch Flaps 1 and 3 together on Side 4, Flaps 1, 2, and 3 together on Side 3, and Flaps 1 and 2 together on Side 2. Cut a 2 cm hole through the center of Flap 1.\nWith Flap 1 facing down, align the hole with the point where the lines exit the collar, and orient the pouch so that the opening is caudal. Make sure that the pouch is on the midline or slightly lateral to the dorsal neck.Pull the red and white lines through the hole in Flap 1. Make sure that the lines lay flat between Flaps 1 and 2, with Flap 3 facing up (Figure 8).\nUsing a 0 synthetic, monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene suture, secure the pouch to the collar with a simple interrupted suture at each corner and midway along each edge. Do not suture through the skin.\n9. Postoperative care\nFollowing recovery from anesthesia, return the pig to its home cage. Due to the chewing nature of swine, ensure that the pig is singly housed to prevent catheter removal by a conspecific pig. If housed next to other swine, place a barrier to prevent chewing of the catheter between the caging.\nDuring the immediate postoperative period, monitor the animal at least daily for signs of pain, infection, and healing. Respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, energy, appetite, and water consumption are good health indicators during this time. Administer additional doses of an analgesic (e.g., 0.12 mg/kg buprenorphine-sustained release [SR] LAB every 48 h) if signs of pain develop. Perform catheter maintenance (step 10) and visual inspection of the surgery site daily, starting at postoperative day (POD) 1.\n\tNOTE:\u00a0Researchers who choose to adopt this Hickman catheter insertion technique can modify this procedure with multimodal analgesia; however, NSAIDs may alter study findings depending on other elements of the experimental design. This should be considered before planning the analgesia regimen.\nOnce the catheter's surgery site is healed, perform maintenance monitoring checks on the animal: perform weekly body weight measurements and conduct visual checks during the daily catheter maintenance. Consult a veterinarian if signs of infection, such as decreased appetite or decreased energy, develop. If complete blood counts are needed, collect blood from the red line.\u200bNOTE: A leukocytosis characterized by a neutrophilia is often observed in animals with infection.\n10. Catheter maintenance\nDesignate the wider red line exclusively for blood draws and the narrower white line exclusively for medication administration. Always handle the catheter with gloved hands.\n\tNOTE: These roles may be different depending on the study design.\nFlush the red (designated blood draw) line daily to assess patency and prevent clotting as follows:\n\t\nUse aseptic technique: Wipe the clave and syringe tip with an alcohol pad in between each step. If the clave or syringe becomes unsterile, replace the contaminated material before continuing.\nFlush 1 mL of 0.9% saline into the line. Confirm the liquid is able to flush without excessive force in order to prevent pushing clots from the line into the animal.\nPull back 2 mL of fluid. Confirm line patency by observing the liquid pulled back is dark red blood.\nIf blood draw is necessary, attach an empty syringe to draw back the appropriate amount of blood.\n\t\tNOTE: If excess blood is taken, blood can be returned to the animal by pushing it back through the line to decrease blood loss. This should only be done if the syringe containing blood continued to be handled using aseptic technique. Do not put contaminated blood back into the central line.\nFlush the line with 5 mL of 100 USP/mL heparinized saline, or an amount necessary to flush the entire line. Clamp the line. Return the line to the protective pouch, taking care not to kink or knot the line.\nFlush the white (designed medication administration) line daily to assess patency and prevent clotting as follows:Use aseptic technique: wipe the clave and syringe tip with an alcohol pad in between each step. If the clave or syringe becomes unsterile, replace the contaminated material before continuing.\nFlush 1 mL of 0.9% saline into the line. Confirm the liquid is able to flush without excessive force in order to prevent pushing clots from the line into the animal.\nAdminister medications using this line at a medication-specific speed and dilution. Flush the line with 1-3 mL of 0.9% saline between medications.\nFlush the line with 5 mL of 100 USP/mL heparinized saline, or an amount necessary to flush the entire line. Clamp the line. Return the line to the protective pouch, taking care not to kink or knot the line.\nCheck the claves daily for signs of dysfunction, breakage, or overt contamination with blood, food, or feces.

Protocols should be approved by the animal welfare committee at the appropriate institution before proceeding.\n1. Preparing for the ECG\nNOTE: Before beginning, don personal protective equipment including gloves, eyewear and a clean laboratory coat or disposable gown.\nClean the ECG pad using a non-alcohol and non-bleach based decontamination solution. Gently use a delicate task wipe to blot off excess solution to ensure that the electrode pad does not become damaged.\nIf the ECG pad has a heating feature, use it. Anesthetized mice tend to lose body heat rapidly. Heat the pad to 40-42 \u00b0C to maintain normothermic body temperature of 37 \u00b0C throughout the surgery14. Monitor body temperature using a rectal thermometer. Adjust pad temperature as necessary to maintain the body temperature ~37 \u00b0C.\nAs most thoracotomies are performed with the mouse lying on its back (supine), ensure that the toggle is flipped to the \"supine\" setting. Many ECG pads have a function to toggle between prone and supine positions. Failure to select the right orientation can result in misrepresentation of electrocardiographic events.\nAnesthetize mouse using 5% inhaled isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen. Once mouse is anesthetized, transfer mouse to ECG pad equipped with an anesthesia nose-cone and reduce isoflurane to 2% and 1 L/min oxygen. Confirm proper anesthesia by ensuring mouse does not react when the mouse's foot is pinched with forceps.\nApply a thin coat of eye lubrication ointment over the mouse's eyes to prevent dryness and corneal damage while anesthetized.Clean the mouse's paws with a wet wipe to remove all visible bedding that may be stuck to the paws or may interfere with the transmission of electrical impulses from the paws to the ECG pad. Dry paws with a wipe.\nApply a small amount (slightly smaller than a USD dime) of highly conductive electrolyte gel to each of the four metallic electrodes on the ECG pad.\n\tNote: Be sure to only apply a small amount of gel as too much gel makes it difficult to restrain the paws to the pad using tape. Additionally, paws are likely to slip out of the restraint during surgery if they were wet before applying tape.\nWith the mouse in supine position, use clear medical tape to restrain each paw to its corresponding electrode (Figure 1). First press each paw to its piece of tape and then adhere the tape to the ECG pad. Ensure that each restrained paw is in contact with the electrolyte gel and the electrode.\n2. Acquiring the ECG\nDepending on the equipment used for ECG acquisition, configure the machine so that the ECG waveform can be visualized in real time. For ECG recordings using the physiologic monitoring settings on an echocardiography machine, a live B-mode image will have the ECG waveform running along the bottom of the screen.\n\tNote: See individual machine user guides to determine how best to configure that equipment.\nEnable real time visualization of ECG waveform by pressing the B-mode key on an echocardiography machine or the equivalent on other ECG recording devices.\n\t\nAdjust the resolution to account for differences in amplitude. If the peak of the R-wave or the trough (valley) of the Q-wave are out of the visual frame, adjust the resolution until the entire height of the waveform can be observed.Note: This can be done under the physiological settings tab on an echocardiography machine. Click the increase or decrease arrows until the entire waveform is visible.\nAny time that an image is to be obtained, clear the ECG pad of tools. Touching the mouse during ECG recording with forceps or fingers will disturb the waveform. Ensure that the mouse is still and untouched on the ECG pad before recording any ECGs.\nUse the machine's \"record\" or \"store\" feature before making any surgical incisions on the mouse. This image will be used as a baseline for comparison later on.\n3. Surgical Procedure and Recording ECG\nInject anesthetized mouse with analgesic (buprenorphine, 1.5 \u00b5g, intraperitoneal) before beginning. The details of the ischemia/reperfusion surgical procedure can also be found elsewhere5.\nRemove hair around the surgical site chemically or mechanically and disinfect the area with betadine solution. Use a scalpel to make a vertical incision parallel to the esophagus and trachea. Gently move the lymph nodes to each side of the incision until the thin tissue covering the trachea is exposed. Using forceps, gently separate the tissue until the white cartilage rings of the trachea are visible.\n\tNote: We generally use Nair hair removal lotion. The lotion is applied on the surgical site for ~1 min. Nair is then thoroughly washed off using saline or water. This method is preferred in our laboratory because high resolution echocardiography (which can detect hair follicles) is performed before and after surgery. However, caution should be taken to avoid sensitive areas such as genitals, and then thoroughly washing the Nair off to avoid potential skin burns.Quickly remove the mouse's nose from the nose-cone and insert ventilation tubing into the mouth of the mouse and towards the throat. When the tip of the ventilation tubing is visible through the exposed neck area, align the tube with the start of the trachea. Gently wiggle the tube side to side while applying upward pressure until the tubing slides into the trachea which can be confirmed visually through the translucent trachea.\nEnsure that the mouse remains anesthetized during the intubation procedure. Pause from intubation and return the mouse to the nose-cone if it begins to stir.\nUsing a loop of string, hook the mouse's two front teeth through the loop and tape the string ends to the ECG pad to steady the head of the mouse and to ensure the ventilation tubing does not move during surgery. Quickly attach ventilation tubing to rodent ventilator and adjust ventilation settings according to the weight of the mouse. Tape ventilation tubing in place.\nCover the mouse's exposed trachea with a gauze soaked in warm saline to keep tissue from drying.\nMake a vertical incision using a scalpel along the left side of the sternum.\nUsing forceps, gently separate the fascia layer from the muscle layer. Carefully cut the underlying muscle layers without cutting visible blood vessels.\nUsing forceps, grab the third rib and pull upwards gently. Maintain grip on the rib with one hand and use surgical scissors to carefully cut the intercostal tissue between the third and fourth rib. Ensure that the lungs are not damaged.\n\tNote: Lungs will retract deep into the chest cavity almost immediately after the chest cavity is punctured by the surgical incision due to the loss of the pressure gradient. Wait until the lungs have retracted before continuing.Use forceps to grab and gently separate the thin layer of pericardium which surrounds the heart.\nInsert retractors or manually use forceps as rib retractors to move the ribs into a position where the heart is visible between the ribs.\n\tNote: It is common practice to move the mouse's lower left paw so that it is overlapping the lower right paw during the placement of the ligature. This helps to position the heart so that the left atrial appendage, or auricle, is easily visible during placement of the ligature. Be aware that valid ECG waveforms will not be obtained while the lower left paw is off of the electrode. For this reason it is advisable to return the paw to its electrode after the suturing ligature is passed through the myocardial tissue but before a knot is tightened.\nLocate the LAD visually, beneath the left auricle. Swiftly insert a 7-0 silk tapered suturing needle into the myocardium deeply enough to pass under the LAD but not so deep as to penetrate the LV cavity. Pull the suturing ligature through until there is about 4 cm of suturing silk left on the free (non-needle) end of the suturing ligature.\nBegin to tie a simple suture knot. Once the free end of the suturing silk has been pulled through the loops to form the knot, pause.\nHolding both the free and needle ends of the suturing silk with forceps, insert a ~1 cm section of PE-10 tubing underneath the forming knot and atop the epicardial surface.\nIf the mouse's left paw is crossed, return the paw to its proper electrode. Tighten knot so that the PE-10 tubing is sutured to the heart. Release all physical contact with the mouse to allow ECG to be recorded.Allow ECG waveform to cycle through for ~10 sec. Check ECG waveform visually and record waveform as \"Time of Occlusion\". If the T-wave does not increase in amplitude within 1 min, reassess placement of ligature.\n\t\nIf the T-wave amplitude does not increase, either discard the animal from the study or attempt to correct the ligature placement.\nVisually check the color of the myocardium to confirm ischemic paling of the LV.\nIf ECG changes and myocardial color changes indicate ischemia, double knot the suture around the PE-10 tubing.\nCover the open chest cavity with warm saline gauze.\nRecord ECG every 5-10 min for the duration of the ischemic period.\n4. Confirmation of Reperfusion Using ECG\nRemove saline gauze covering the chest cavity and visualize the heart.\nUse a blade to cut the suturing silk atop the PE-10 tubing. Once the ligature is cut, remove the section of PE-10 tubing and gently remove the suturing ligature from the myocardium.\nRelease all physical contact with the mouse and allow the ECG waveform ~10 sec to cycle. Record waveform as \"Time of Reperfusion.\" Continue to record ECG waveforms every 5-10 min until the desired experimental time point is reached.\nAdjust resolution for changes in amplitude as needed. If the T-wave does not change upon removal of the PE-10 tubing and ligature, reperfusion is not confirmed.\n\t\nIf the T-wave does not change upon removal of tubing, either discard the animal from the study or attempt to correct the ligature placement.\nVisually inspect myocardium to additionally confirm reperfusion by return to red color.Close chest cavity by suturing the intercostal space with a 5-0 silk suture while applying gentle pressure to the mouse's chest to expel excess air that has entered during surgery. Then suture the muscle layers and finally, skin. Note: Applying pressure to the chest cavity may not be sufficient to evacuate the chest cavity of air in all mice.\u00a0 Therefore, the syringe and needle method of evacuation should be employed to ensure that all air has been expelled.\nRecord the last ECG before turning inhaled anesthesia off and removing the mouse's paws from the electrodes. Increase oxygen to 2 L/min and maintain ventilation until the mouse regains consciousness.\nAllow mouse to recover in a constant temperature controlled environment, e.g. heating pad or warm incubator, to avoid infarct variability. Treat mouse with buprenorphine 24 hr after the surgery and then as needed as indicated by the mouse grimace scale.\n\tNote: Procedure for reperfusion is also discussed in detail by Xu et al.5\nSubscription Required.

These enzymes should not cut your GOI. Use a DNA documentation program such as SnapGene Viewer to plan the cloning. To maintain the reading frame, bases might have to be added between the restriction site and the GOI. It is possible to use any base, but take care that no stop codon is generated.\nWe recommend adenosine or thymidine to have a lower melting temperature.\n2. Check which restriction enzymes cut your vector only once and not your GOI. If you have chosen two enzymes, check the efficiency of both enzymes in the restriction buffer, and if possible, use the same buffer for both enzymes.\nYou can use the following website for help: https://nebcloner.neb.com/#!/redigest[href=https://nebcloner.neb.com/#!/redigest].\n3. Design oligomers for cloning, which include the restriction site, additional bases, and around 20 to 30 bases of your GOI. Use the table from New England Biolabs, and add bases according to the restriction enzyme (https://www.neb.com/-/media/nebus/files/chart-image/cleavage_olignucleotides_old.pdf?la=en[href=https://www.neb.com/-/media/nebus/files/chart-image/cleavage_olignucleotides_old.pdf?la=en]).\nPCR amplify gene of interest\n4. As a template for the GOI, use either a plasmid or cDNA.In our case, we used the pLenti6/V5-p53-R249S plasmid (Addgene #22935).\n5. In PCR reaction tubes, set up a PCR as follows (50 \u00b5l total PCR volume):\n         \n32.5 \u00b5l water\n10 \u00b5l of 5\u00d7 Phusion buffer\n1 \u00b5l of 10 mM dNTP mix\n2.5 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M TP53 forward oligomer\n2.5 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M TP53 reverse oligomer\n2 \u00b5l DNA\n0.5 \u00b5l Phusion polymerase.\nIn the case of cDNA, plasmid DNA, and genomic DNA, dilute to 50 to 100 ng.\nUse a high-fidelity polymerase with proofreading function to get a high accuracy of your GOI. This is especially important if you have a gene with a point mutation.\n6. Run PCR using a thermal cycler and the following conditions:\n         \ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2,3\n1 cycle,30 s,98\u00b0C,(initial denaturation)\n29 cycles,10 s,98\u00b0C,(denaturation)\n,30 s,variable,(annealing)\n,30 s per kb,72\u00b0C,(extension)\n1 cycle,10 min,72\u00b0C,(final extension)\nFinal step,indefinitely,4\u00b0C,(hold).\nUse 60\u00b0C for the annealing temperature for the first time. If 60\u00b0C does not work, try a temperature gradient to detect the optimal annealing temperature.\n7. Prepare a 1% (w/v) agarose gel with 1\u00d7 TAE and SYBR\u00ae Safe (1:10,000 dilution) to assess PCR amplification. Run 5 \u00b5l sample mixed with 6\u00d7 DNA gel loading dye. Use a 1-kb DNA ladder to identify the size of your GOI. Run gel at 130 V for 15 min.\n8. Purify PCR products with a positive result using the E.Z.N.A.\u00ae Cycle Pure Kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\n9. Elute sample in 25 \u00b5l water. To achieve a higher concentration, prewarm water to 50\u00b0C. Measure concentration with a spectrophotometer.\nThe concentration of the sample should vary between 10 and 50 ng/\u00b5l.\n10. Freeze sample at \u221220\u00b0C, or proceed with digestion.\nDigest PCR product and vector\n11. Prepare each digestion in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube as follows (30 \u00b5l total volume):24 \u00b5l purified PCR product\n3 \u00b5l of 10\u00d7 CutSmart\u00ae Buffer\n1 \u00b5l restriction enzyme NdeI\n1 \u00b5l restriction enzyme PacI\n1 \u00b5l water.\n12.

Incubate both digestions overnight at 37\u00b0C. Do not incubate longer than 15 to 16 hr.\n14. Prepare a 1% (w/v) agarose gel with 1\u00d7 TAE and SYBR\u00ae Safe (1:10,000 dilution). Use a comb with a 30-\u00b5l volume capacity in order to load the entire digest.\n15. Mix whole digestion with 6\u00d7 loading dye, and load on gel. As a control, load 200 ng undigested vector. Use a 1-kb DNA ladder as a reference for the sample size. Leave one empty well between samples and DNA ladder to prevent contamination.\n16. Perform electrophoresis at 130 V for 15 min.\n17. Use a UV transilluminator to visualize bands of digestion. Wear protective equipment to protect from UV light.\n18. Cut out respective band with a scalpel, and place gel containing GOI in a prelabeled microcentrifuge tube.\n19. Purify sample using the E.Z.N.A.\u00ae Gel Extraction Kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\n20. Measure concentration.\n21. Freeze sample at \u221220\u00b0C, or proceed with ligation.\nLigate GOI and modulation vector\n22. Calculate amount of insert required for the ligation reaction using the free calculator available at http://www.insilico.uni-duesseldorf.de/Lig_Input.html[href=http://www.insilico.uni-duesseldorf.de/Lig_Input.html]. Use the following details for calculation:\n         \nVector size: 8324 bp\nVector amount: 50 ng\nInsert size: 1182 bp\nMolar ratio: 1:3.\nIf the insert size is more than 4 kbp use a molar ratio of 1:3 and 1:5 in the software.\n23. Prepare ligation as follows (10 \u00b5l total volume):\n         \n50 ng digested vector21.3 ng digested insert\n1 \u00b5l of 10\u00d7 T4 DNA ligase buffer\n1 \u00b5l T4 DNA ligase\nBring to 10 \u00b5l with water.\n24.

Incubate ligation mixture overnight at 16\u00b0C. Do not incubate longer than 16 hr.\n26. The next day, proceed with transformation.\nTransform\n27. Let TOP10 chemically competent cells thaw on ice for 10 min. Use one vial of competent cells per ligation reaction.\n28. Add 10 \u00b5l ligation mixture to chemically competent cells in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Mix gently by tapping tube.\n29. Incubate on ice for 10 min.\n30. Place reaction tube in a 42\u00b0C heating block for 1 min (heat shock).\n31. Stop reaction by placing cells on ice for 2 min (cold shock).\n32. Add 300 \u00b5l LB medium without antibiotics.\n33. Shake at 37\u00b0C for 40 min at 800 rpm.\n34. Spread 150 \u00b5l cells on 10-cm LB agar plates containing ampicillin.\n35. Incubate plate overnight at 37\u00b0C. Do not incubate longer than 16 hr.\nThe ligation control should technically have no clones. The ligation control is done to determine the experimental background. If colonies grow on the control plate, it might be undigested or contain religated vector. There should be no or a significantly lower number of colonies on the ligation control plate compared with the ligation plate of your GOI.\n36. Wrap plate with Parafilm\u00ae M, and store at 4\u00b0C until further use.\nAnalyze plasmid\n37. Pick 3 to 5 clones from each plate, and individually add to 15-ml conical tubes containing 5 ml LB medium with ampicillin.For each tube pick a separate colony (e.g., with a sterile pipet tip).\n38. Incubate culture overnight at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm. Do not incubate longer than 16 hr.\n39. Prepare a glycerol stock of the cultures in a cryovial by adding 500 \u00b5l culture to 500 \u00b5l glycerol. Store at \u221280\u00b0C for further use.\n40. Perform a mini-prep with the remaining culture using the E.Z.N.A.\u00ae Plasmid Mini Kit I following manufacturer's instructions.\n41. Perform a digest of plasmid to control integration of the insert. As a control, digest 200 to 300 ng plasmid as described above. Stop digestion after 2 hr.\n42. Check digestion on agarose gel to see whether two bands of the correct size are visible. Discard any plasmids that do not contain inserts or have fragments of the wrong size.\n43. Prepare sample for sequencing according to requirements.\nCheck how many micrograms of vector DNA are required by the chosen sequencing company and if the primer should be added or sent separately. Inform yourself how long the sequenced area is or if different lengths can be booked. For sequencing, you can use the forward or reverse primer from the PCR amplification. If you have a point mutation in your GOI, make sure the sequenced area covers the mutation. If the forward or reverse primer does not cover the point mutation, you can design your own sequencing primer. Choose a site around 20 to 30 bp before or after your point mutation because sequencing is poor at the beginning. The primer should have a length of \u223c20 bp.\n44. Compare sequencing results with your own vector, which contains the GOI. If it matches, proceed with the next step.\n45. Prepare a midi- or maxi-prep from the positive plasmid to obtain enough material for virus production.We recommend using a NucleoBond\u00ae Xtra Midi/Maxi Kit for plasmid purification and following manufacturer's instructions.\n46. Measure concentration.\n47. Freeze plasmid at \u221220\u00b0C until further use.This protocol describes the preparation of DMEM GlutaMAX\u2122 containing a final concentration of 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin for culturing HEK 293T cells.\nMaterials\nFBS\nDMEM GlutaMAX\u2122\nPenicillin-streptomycin\n0.45-\u00b5m bottle-cap filter\n1.

After 48 hr, remove all medium, and add 1 ml fresh medium.\n6. Perform antibiotic selection after 72 hr using culture medium containing 1 \u00b5g/ml puromycin.\nThe concentration of the antibiotic should be determined beforehand by performing a killing curve for each cell line. After 2 days of selection, it is possible to see if cells survive. Cells that do not survive selection will detach.\n7. Split cells at least once in a plate containing medium with puromycin to achieve a more efficient selection.\nYou can use a 6-well plate to expand the cells. On the next day, you can check if cells have attached and survived the splitting.8. After 1 week stop antibiotic selection, and culture cells without antibiotics.\n9.

The method to be performed first depends on whether the immune epitope can survive the in situ hybridization conditions. The polyclonal antibody against Calbindin-D28K, a Purkinje neuron-specific marker in the cerebellum, can be applied after C1q mRNA probe in situ hybridization. Thus, the immunostaining procedure for D28K can be performed after in situ hybridization. However, the monoclonal antibody against CD68, a microglial marker, cannot. Therefore, the immunostaining procedure for CD68 needs to be performed prior to in situ hybridization. Both processes are outlined.In situ 1st, immunostaining 2nd Isolate whole brain immediately from euthanized mouse and immerse in freshly prepared PFA. Incubate overnight at 4 \u00b0C nutating [for a standard mouse brain isolation procedure please refer to Stevens et al. (2007)].Wash fixed brains twice for 5-10 min each in RNase free 5x SSC buffer to remove excess PFA.Meanwhile, clean vibratome reservoir and blade holder with RNaseZAP and rinse with RNase free water in an effort to remove any RNases; operate with new blade.Vibratome section in RNase free 5x SSC buffer, 50 \u00b5m each section. Note: 5x SSC can be chilled while sectioning with vibratome to reduce potential RNase activity. We have not found this to be necessary but a precaution. Also, agarose embedding of the tissue for sectioning can be performed but is not essential. Transfer vibratome sections with sterile tweezers or brush to either a 1.5 ml or a 5 ml Eppendorf tube filled with 5x SSC buffer. Size of tube and volume used for incubating and washing will depend on amount of tissue sections. A 15 ml conical may also be appropriate. For a 1.5 ml tube washing and incubating are performed using 1 ml volumes.Note: Allow about 90% of total volume of liquid to be transferred between washes. For a 1.5 ml tube that would mean that free-floating tissue sections should fall and accumulate below the 100 \u03bcl mark so that 900 \u03bcl can be easily pipetted off and replaced. This approach should be adapted to greater volume tubes if used.Replace 50% of the 5x SSC buffer with Hybe and nutate for 5 min. Then allow sections to settle.Replace 90% of the supernatant with Hybe and nutate at 60 \u00b0C for ~10 min or more, until ready to add probe.Meanwhile, add 200 ng of purified DIG-labeled RNA probe per ml of Hybe to be used. Heat to 80 \u00b0C for 5 min to denature RNA probe into Hybe. Remove as much of the hybridization solution from the samples as possible and replace with Hybe with probe from step A8.Note: To conserve on probe and Hybe solution, samples can be incubated standing, without mixing, rotating or nutating, in the least amount of liquid needed to cover the sample, e.g. 100 \u03bcl if a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube is used. Hybridize at 60 \u00b0C for at least 16 h nutating. Note: Again, if using low volumes of Hybe w/probe to cover tissue sections, mixing while hybridizing is not necessary. The probe should diffuse adequately at high temperature and during long 16 h or more incubation periods.After hybridization, replace or dilute hybridization solution on samples with Hybe without probe and incubate at 60 \u00b0C for 15 min nutating.Note: Hybe and wash 1 and 2 buffers are usually prewarmed to 60 \u00b0C, but protocol has been successfully performed without heating the buffers for this and the following wash steps. Wash 2x with wash 1 at 60 \u00b0C for 15 min nutating.Wash 2x with wash 2 at 60 \u00b0C for 15 min nutating.Replace wash 2 with block and incubate at room temp for 10 min.Replace block again to dilute wash 2 further.Incubate hybridized sections at 4 \u00b0C overnight in fresh block containing 1: 1,000 dilution of anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments and Rabbit anti-Calbindin-D28K.Wash 4x with block at room temp, >10 min each wash.Incubate sections at 4 \u00b0C overnight in block containing 1: 1,000 dilution of anti-rabbit Alexa488 secondary, or other appropriate fluorescent secondary (available from Jackson Immunoresearch or Life Technologies). Note: Anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments at 1: 1,000 can be added again if fear of losing signal from overnight wash.Wash 4x with block at room temp, at least 10 min each wash.Gradually replace block with detection buffer, a 50% exchange followed by 90% exchange of liquid in tube and then a subsequent 90% exchange.Dissolve a ready-to-use NBT/BCIP tablet in 10 ml of dH2O.Exchange detection buffer with NBT/BCIP solution and incubate in the dark without motion.Samples can be transferred from tubes to dishes for better color monitoring.Note: Purple precipitate can form in a few minutes, hours or left overnight at 4 \u00b0C depending on probe and expression levels of target.Once color spots in tissue sections are detected, replace NBT/BCIP solution with stop buffer. After development mount sections on slides and coverslip with Fluoromount-G. mRNA in situ can be visualized with bright field or phase and immunostaining, Calbindin D28K can be seen by fluorescent microscopy. The images can then be overlayed using software: Photoshop, Image J, etc.Note: Alternatively, NBT/BCIP colormetric reaction can be replaced with a fluorescent substrate such as HNPP/Fast Red TR for double fluorescence detection.Immunostaining 1st, in situ 2nd Isolate whole brain immediately from euthanized mouse and immerse in freshly prepared PFA. Incubate overnight at 4 \u00b0C nutating.Wash fixed brains twice for 5-10 min each in RNase free PBS to remove excess PFA.Meanwhile, clean vibratome reservoir and blade holder with RNaseZAP and rinse with RNase free water in an effort to remove any RNases; operate with new blade.Vibratome section in RNase free PBS buffer, 50 \u00b5m each section.Transfer vibratome sections to either a 1.5 ml or a 5 ml Eppendorf tube, depending on amount of tissue sections used, and fill with PBS.Replace 50% of PBS with HPM (hydrogen peroxide in methanol to quench endogenous peroxidase activity) and mix.Replace as much of the mix with HPM.Incubate at room temp for 30 min nutating.Replace HPM gradually with RNase free PBS with a series of 25%, 50%, 100% volume exchanges for 1-2 min each.Replace PBS with DEPC block at room temp.Incubate for 10 min then replace with fresh DEPC block.Incubate free-floating sections at 4 \u00b0C overnight in DEPC block containing 1: 1,000 dilution of rat anti-CD68. Wash 4x with DEPC block at room temp, at least 10 min each wash.Wash 2x with RNase free PBS to remove DEPC block, ~2-5min each wash.Fix with PFA for 30 min-1 h at room temp.Wash sections for 5 min, 2x in RNase free 5x SSC buffer to remove excess PFA.Follow steps A6-15 above.Incubate hybridized sections at 4 \u00b0C overnight in block containing 1: 1,000 dilution of anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments and 1: 10,000 dilution of anti-rat HRP secondary. Wash 4x with block at room temp, at least 10 min each wash.Follow steps A20-24 above.After developing sections with NBT/BCIP reaction switch to PBS then develop DAB reaction according to Sigma protocol for FAST DAB reaction.Note: Do not use metal enhancer, as the purple-blue from the NBT/BCIP reaction overlayed with the brown produced from the DAB reaction can produce a blackish color that can be masked by metal enhancement of DAB reaction, which yields a blue-black color. If NBT/BCIP reaction is expected to take a long time to develop, the DAB reaction may be performed first. Optimum conditions would have to be worked out for each experiment.After development sections were mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G and imaged with light microscopy. Alternatively, for double fluorescence microscopy applications, HNPP/Fast Red TR for AP reaction and Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) with Alexa Fluor dyes for HRP reaction can be used.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      The present protocol describes the procedure for a conventional RT-PCR\n      reaction with locally produced enzymes (Mendoza-Rojas et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) coupled to CRISPR/Cas12a detection using a fluorescence microplate\n      reader, or direct fluorescence visualization (Alc\u00e1ntara et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). This protocol is intended to be used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.\n      However, the described methodology could be set up as a base protocol for\n      molecular detection of nucleic acid molecules (RNA/DNA) of any other\n      pathogen or microorganism of interest.\n    \nNote: In this protocol, we describe RT-PCR\n      and CRISPR/Cas recipes for 32 reactions, to fit in the BentoLab portable\n      system. All the examples in the article correspond to a 32 reactions\n      workflow (28 samples\u00a0+ controls). Scale the required volume of each\n      reagent depending on the total number of samples to test or if a 96-well\n      thermocycler is available.\n    \nSample RNA extraction\n      This protocol has been validated with nasopharyngeal swab samples. Use\n      your locally approved viral RNA extraction or other approved commercial\n      alternative kits. Here, the viral RNA material was extracted using the\n      QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN).\n    \n        To perform RNA extraction, 200\u00a0\u03bcL of sample or negative extraction\n        control (NEC) was used according to the manufacturer protocol (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=c80685c0-4103-49ea-aa72-8989420e3018&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=c80685c0-4103-49ea-aa72-8989420e3018&lang=en]).

A NEC could be a pool of verified\n      negative patient samples, commercial alternatives (i.e., human DNA in\n      stabilizing synthetic matrix, such as the one available in the HDPCRTM\n      SARS-CoV-2 assay (ChromaCode)), or even molecular-grade nuclease-free\n      water.\n    \nOne-step RT-PCR\nTiming: two hours from reaction\n      preparation to resultsThis protocol was standardized to amplify two gene SARS-CoV-2 targets, at\n      the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-end of the genome, as well as a region of the RNAseP human\n      gene as RNA extraction control using a one-step RT-PCR reaction. Examples\n      used M-MLV reverse transcriptase (RT) and Taq DNA polymerase produced in\n      the laboratory. Commercial enzymes can be used as an alternative.\n    \nAlternatives: The following\n      commercial kits have been evaluated in replacement of the enzymes\n      mentioned here, M-MLV reverse transcriptase and/or Taq-polymerase.\n      Commercial kits can be used as one- or two-step RT-PCR reactions without\n      interfering with the CRISPR/Cas detection assay. For one-step reactions we\n      tested the 2\u00d7 One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Cat. No. 28113, Norgen\n      Biotek). For two-step reactions we tested RevertAid First Strand cDNA\n      Synthesis Kit (Cat. No. K1622, ThermoFisher) coupled with DreamTaq Green\n      PCR Master Mix (2\u00d7) (Cat.

The following protocol is in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Rutgers University. It is estimated that the subsequent procedures will require 3-6 hr to complete.\nImplanting the Microwire Array:\nPlace animals under anesthesia using 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (i.p) and administer 10 mg/kg of atropine methyl nitrate (IP; Glycopyrrolate may be substituted) and 0.25 mg penicillin (300,000 U/ml i.m.) to maintain respiratory function and prevent infection, respectively.\n\tNote: With the 3-6 hr length of this implantation surgery, sodium pentobarbital is used because it is cost-effective and limits human exposure to anesthetics (as might occur with prolonged use of gas anesthetics) while still providing long-lasting anesthesia. Substitution of other anesthetics is acceptable.\nVerify that the anesthesia has taken effect using the tail pinch test before proceeding.\nAs necessary, give alternating injections of ketamine hydrochloride (60 mg/kg IP) and sodium pentobarbital (5-10 mg/kg IP) to maintain anesthesia throughout the surgery.\nShave the scalp using a #22 scalpel blade.\nDisinfect the shaved scalp with povidone iodine.\nGive subcutaneous injections of bupivacaine (~1 mg/kg SC spread over 4 injection sites) to locally anesthetize the scalp. Allow 5-10 min for the local anesthetic to take effect.\nPlace an ophthalmic lubricant over the eyes to maintain moisture during anesthesia.\nSecure the animal into the ear bars and nose clamp of a stereotaxic apparatus.\nUse visual landmarks (e.g. a horizontal bar on the stereotaxic frame) to approximately level the animal's head. This step is only meant to approximately level the skull.Make an incision along the midline of the scalp using a #11 scalpel blade mounted on a scalpel holder. The incision must extend from just behind the ears to the posterior portion of the nasal bone.\nUsing a dissection spatula, clear the skull of all remaining tissue until both lateral skull ridges and the posterior skull ridge have been reached.\nPull back the skin around the incision using a number of hemostats (6x).\nClean the skull of any blood and allow it to dry. If any remaining bleeding occurs, terminate the residual bleeding with a small cauterizing tool. Ensuring that the skull remains clean and dry allows the dental acrylic used in subsequent steps to bind to the skull permanently.\nMark bregma and lambda (Figure 2D) by interpolating the intersection of the skull sutures. A dissecting microscope is necessary to accurately mark these positions.\nAttach a small pointed item (e.g.\u00a0a pin or dental drill bit) to a stereotaxic arm and lower it to determine the dorsal/ventral (DV) coordinate of bregma and lambda.\nAdjust the nose clamp until the DV coordinates for bregma and lambda are within 100 \u00b5m (0.1 mm) of each other.\nOnce leveled, record the anterior/posterior (AP), medial/lateral (ML) and DV coordinates of bregma along with the position of the nose clamp. Double check the coordinates for accuracy, as the remainder of the surgery depends on the precision of these coordinates.\nUse the measured coordinates to calculate the ML and AP coordinates for the four corners of the \"skull window\" relative to bregma (i.e. craniotomy; Figure 1). The skull window is a precisely positioned rectangle through which the microwire array will pass.Use the calculated coordinates to mark the skull window coordinates on the skull using a pointed stereotaxic attachment and fountain pen ink. To obtain precise marks, apply only a small amount of ink to the tip of the marking tool using a cotton applicator.\nDrill out the skull window by removing the bone in a series of small layers.\n\t\nStart by drilling the marked corners of the window where the marks have been placed.\nNext, connect the corners and outline the window.\nFinally, clear out the area within the outline down to the depth of dura mater. The hole must be wider (i.e. beveled) below the superficial layers of the skull to ensure that the window maintains an appropriate width from top to bottom.\nUse microforceps to carefully remove any remaining bone chips, debris, or dura mater inside the skull window. This step is extremely important, as these bits of material can compromise the integrity of the array during lowering. Once cleared, one must keep the window moist with bacteriostatic saline for the remainder of the surgery.\nPlace markings on the skull for 5 skull screws and 1 ground wire (Figure 1). These positions will vary depending on the targeted brain region. The headstage will be most secure if one screw is placed on each of the 5 skull bones. Place both the skull screws and ground wire in locations that will not interfere with the microwire array placement.\nDrill holes for the skull screws and secure the screws in place. Screws must be lowered until only 3-4 threads are showing (or, if using screws other than those recommended, deep enough to traverse the thickness of the skull to promote array stability but not too deep so as to damage cortex). Clean the threads of the screws after placement.Drill a hole for the ground wire. Lower the wire slowly (over 1-2 min) to the target DV coordinate and fix the wire in place using dental acrylic.\nAdd acrylic around the threads of the skull screws. Before the acrylic dries, remove any excess cement that flows away from the ground wire or skull screws. Allow 15 min for the dental acrylic to dry/harden.\nAttach the array to the stereotaxic arm. Level the array and orient it so that it will squarely pass through the confines of the skull window.\nPlace saline in the skull window so that it is level with the skull. Lower the array until it creates a dimple in the saline. This coordinate is used as skull level for the array. Use this value to calculate the final DV coordinate of the array.\nLower the array slowly until it reaches its final DV coordinate. Stop every 1mm of lowering and wait for several minutes in order to allow brain tissue to recover from dimpling and to dissolve the bottom portion of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the array (PEG is used to temporarily keep the wires in their conformation while lowering, and dissolves slowly in saline).\nWhen the array is 1mm away from the target, lower it more slowly until the final target is reached. Lowering at 0.1-0.2 mm at a time before allowing the tissue to rest for a period of 5 min is intended to preserve the tissue at the target site as well as proximal synaptic connections. If the equipment is available, precision lowering of the array can be assisted using a motorized manipulator.Dissolve the remaining PEG and use dental acrylic to cement the microwires in place. Add multiple layers of cement to ensure that the wires are secure and then allow 15-20 min for the cement to harden before proceeding. This ensures that the wires will not be jostled from their final placement.\nBuild the remainder of the animal's headstage using dental acrylic. Use the acrylic to encase the skull screws, ground wire, and connector for the microwires. Allow the acrylic hat to harden sufficiently before proceeding.\nSuture the scalp incision using absorbable sutures and administer 2 ml of bacteriostatic saline (s.c.) to restore hydration from surgery.\nRemove the animal from the ear bars and place the subject in a clean area. Observe the animal frequently during the post-operative recovery until thermoregulation and locomotion have recovered. Following recovery from anesthesia, move the animal into single-housing for the remainder of post-surgical recovery.\nGive animals daily postoperative monitoring and care in the days following the procedure. Recovery from this procedure is optimal when seven or more days are allowed.\nGive animals injections of Carprofen (5mg/kg) and Enrofloxacin (5-10 mg/kg) or their equivalents during recovery per the schedule recommended by the attending veterinarian.\nSubscription Required.

Four-week-old male BALB/c athymic mice were acclimated for a week before the surgery for orthotopic injection of osteosarcoma cells. Mice were housed in individually ventilated\u00a0mice cages with five mice per cage in a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to SPF feed and sterile water.\n1. Preparation of cells\nOn the day of osteosarcoma cell (143B-Luciferase) injection, wash 80%-90% confluent cells cultured in a 10 cm cell culture dish twice with PBS (pH 7.4) and trypsinize with 1.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin for 3 min. Then, add 6 mL of 10% serum-containing MEM media to quench the trypsin, and collect the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: 143B-Luciferase cell line is obtained from 143B cell line transfect with pLV-luciferase vector23.\nAspirate 20 \u00b5L of cell suspension into the chamber of cell counting plate and calculate cell concentration using an automatic cell counter (see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge the cells at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the cell pellet in an 8.5 mg/mL basement membrane matrix (see Table of Materials) to a final concentration of 2 x 107 cells/mL.\nKeeping the cells on ice, bring them to the surgery room. The cells are to be used within 2 h.\n\tNOTE: To avoid inaccurate injection doses (for example, due to the dead space in syringes), an extra cell suspension is prepared (usually two times the required volume of cell suspension). The basement membrane matrix is kept on ice all the time since it has coagulation property above room temperature24.\n2. Surgery for orthotopic injection of the osteosarcoma cells\nNOTE: The surgery tools are shown in Figure 1.Mice were raised in specific pathogen-free conditions. All procedures were done in an aseptic cabinet with sterile tools.\nAnesthetize the mice by exposing them to 2% isoflurane and 98% oxygen (oxygen flow rate, 2 L/min).\nApply a small amount of ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Perform the entire procedure in a well-ventilated area. Before osteosarcoma cell injection, ensure that each mouse is under deep anesthesia by a toe pinch; if the mouse still has responses, such as twitch or jerk, wait for a long time until the above responses disappear.\nKeep each mouse in a supine position. Hold the ankle of the mouse using the thumb and index finger and disinfect the injection site of the tibia with a 70% ethanol swab.\n\tNOTE: To tightly hold the mouse ankle, both the thumb and index fingertips are of great importance for the subsequent procedures.\nRotate the ankle joint of each mouse outward to move the tibia and fibula, and bend the knee joint to a suitable position until the proximal tibia plateau (the top of the tibia) is clearly visible through the skin (Figure 2A).\nAttach the needle to a 1 mL syringe and point the needle tip toward the injection site. Ensure that the syringe needle is parallel to the long axis of the tibia.\n\t\nPercutaneously insert the needle through or adjacent to the patellar ligament as it goes through the skin/joint capsule; th0en, rotate the syringe (1/2 to 3/4-circle) to drill a hole through the tibia platform toward the distal end of the tibia (medullary cavity) for osteosarcoma cell injection with a micro-volume syringe (Figure 2B,C).NOTE: Simultaneous rotation of the tibia can be felt while drilling if the needle tip is accurate. Ensure the needling moves forward with the syringe rotation rather than being directly pushed forward until about half of the needle is in the tibia.\nCheck whether the syringe needle made a prominent movement into the medullary canal to ensure successful drilling.\n\tNOTE: Perform an X-ray examination (see Table of Materials) to confirm the proper position of the needle and collect the images.\nLoad 143B osteosarcoma cell suspension (from step 1.5) into a micro-volume syringe and replace the 1 mL syringe in the tibia with the 143B cell-loaded micro-volume syringe (Figure 2D). Slowly inject ~10 \u00b5L (ignore pre-existing solution in the needle) of 143B cell suspension into each athymic mouse's tibia (about 2 x 105 cells) without applying high pressure.\nPress the injection site with a cotton swab for 20-30 s when the micro-volume syringe is removed.\nPut each mouse back into a clean cage and closely monitor until the mouse is completely recovered from anesthesia (about 10 min).\nMonitor the tumor growth in vivo using an X-ray imaging system. Measure the longer diameter (a) and the short diameter (b) of the cancer mass every week with a caliper for tumor volume (V) calculation: V = 1/2 x a x b2.\n\t\u200bNOTE: Anesthetize the mice by exposing them to 2% isoflurane and 98% oxygen. The mice were anesthetized for x-ray imaging. Intratibia injection of luciferase or fluorescent protein labeled osteosarcoma cells enables tracking of primary and metastatic osteosarcoma lesions.NOTE: Humane endpoints of the mice with osteosarcoma due to tumor growth of the knee and lung metastasis were based on the following criteria: (1) Body Condition Score, (2) weight loss threshold of 20%, (3) average maximum diameter of tumors of 2 cm, or (4) severely limited animal behavior.\n3. Pathologic examination (collecting primary and pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma specimen for analysis)\nSix weeks after osteosarcoma cell injection, sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation after exposing them for CO2 inhalation.\nKeep the mouse in a supine position and stretch both the hind limbs.\nSeparate the whole legs bearing osteosarcoma from the inguinal area.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that all legs are separated from the same anatomical site.\nPrepare the histological specimen of legs bearing osteosarcoma by removing the skin, muscles, and feet, and then fix the specimen of each mouse in a 50 mL tube with 20 mL formalin solution (10%) for 24 h, followed by decalcification in 10% EDTA solution for 14 days with occasional buffer change.\nEmbed the specimen in paraffin and prepare sections for histological examination following previously published work25.\nGently separate the lungs and put them into a 50 mL tube filled with 20 mL formalin solution (10%). After 24 h, transfer the lungs of each mouse into a 15 mL tube with 70% ethanol. Embed the lungs in paraffin for Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry assay25.\nSubscription Required.

Animal Preparation and Anesthesia\nPorcine animal model\n\tNote: This study applied the protocol described in the literature to establish a prospective porcine model of IONM11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,22.\n\t\nUse KHAPS Black or Duroc-Landrace pigs (3-4 months old; weighing 18-30 kg).\nEnsure that the experimental protocol is consistent with national/international regulations and guidelines for animal experiments, including the 3R principles (replacement, reduction, and refinement). Obtain ethical approval of the experimental protocol from the committee for care and use of experimental animals at the relevant institution.\nAnesthesia induction\n\t\nPre-anesthesia preparations\n\t\t\nWithhold food 8 hours before anesthesia and withhold water 2 hours before anesthesia.\nPre-medicate with intramuscular azaperone (4 mg/kg) at 2 hours before anesthesia. Use a 500 mL saline bottle to fabricate a face mask for each piglet. Trim as needed to ensure a secure fit to the snout.\nUse the weighing function on the operating table to measure the net weight of each piglet (Figure 1A).\nMaintain body temperature with a circulating water mattress set to 40 \u00b0C.\nInduce general anesthesia (GA) with 2-4% sevoflurane at a fresh gas flow of 3 L/min via the face mask with the piglet in a prone position. GA can also be induced by intramuscular tiletamine and zloazepam. An adequate depth of anesthesia is usually achieved in 3-5 minutes. Confirm the depth of anesthesia by no severe movement to pain due to peripheral venous catheterization.\nIdentify a superficial vein on the outer side of one ear and sterilize the selected region (about 6 x 6 cm2) with 75% alcohol. For maximum safety, use a 24-gauge peripheral intravenous catheter.Administer intravenous anesthetic such as propofol (1-2 mg/kg) or thiamylal (5-10 mg/kg) to alleviate noxious stimulation by direct laryngoscopy.\n\t\tNote: Use of neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is not suggested. In subsequent experiments, NMBA may complicate intubation by depressing spontaneous breathing and may diminish electromyography (EMG) signals. Additionally, sevoflurane inhalation combined with a bolus of propofol or short-acting barbiturates is reportedly sufficient for facilitating tracheal intubation.\nTracheal intubation (Figure 1B)\nPrepare the equipment and materials required for EMG tube intubation: a size #6 EMG endotracheal tube, a face mask for assisted ventilation, two slings to hold the mouth open, one gauze strip to pull the tongue, a blunt tip suction catheter, a veterinary laryngoscope with 20cm straight blades, an elastic bougie, a 20-mL syringe, a stethoscope, and adhesive tape.\nPosition the piglet in a prone position on the operating table. Align the head and body to ensure clear visualization of the upper airway.\nDirect the assistant to apply traction of the upper and lower jaw to maintain an adequate mouth opening and to avoid rotation or overextension of the head. Cover the tongue with gauze and pull the tongue out to optimize the visual field.\nHold the laryngoscope and place it directly in the oral cavity to depress the tongue.\nDirectly visualize the epiglottis and use the laryngoscope to press the epiglottis downward toward the tongue base.\nWhen the vocal cords are clearly identified, gently advance the elastic bougie into the trachea. Slight rotation of the elastic bougie may be required to overcome resistance. Next, advance the EMG tube at the mouth angle to a depth of 24 cm.\nInflate the EMG tube\u00a0cuff to a volume no larger than 3 mL. If ventilation by manual bagging reveals no obvious air leakage, in situ deflation of the EMG tube is feasible.When the EMG tube is placed at the proper depth, confirm the free passage of fresh gas by manual bagging. Further confirm the proper tracheal intubation by end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) monitoring (capnography) and chest auscultation for early identification of inadvertent esophageal or endobronchial intubation.\n\t\tNote: Capnography showed both the etCO2 waveform and the digital value in mmHg. When esophageal intubation occurred, etCO2 was absent or near zero after 6 breaths. When the EMG tube was in the correct place, the typical etCO2 waveform and adequate value (usually >30 mmHg) was noted. Furthermore, the breathing sound of a bilateral lung filled is clear and symmetric as determined by chest auscultation.\nUse medical tape to fix the EMG tube at the mouth angle. Since the tube usually requires adjustment during IONM experiments, do not fasten the tube to the snout.\nConnect the EMG tube to the ventilator. Continuous capnography is mandatory for monitoring the etCO2 value and curve throughout the experiment.\nAnesthesia maintenance (Figure 1C)\nAfter the EMG tube is fixed, position the piglet on its back with the neck extended (Figure 1C). Maintain general anesthesia with 1-3% sevoflurane in oxygen at 2 L/min.\nVentilate the lungs in volume-control mode at a tidal volume of 8-12 mL/kg, and set the respiratory rate to 12-14 breaths/min.\nBegin physiologic monitoring, including capnography, electrocardiography (ECG)and monitoring of oxygenation (SaO2).\n2. Equipment Setting and Animal Operation (Figure 1D)\nEquipment Setup\n\t\nConnect the channel leads from the EMG tube to the monitoring system.\nSet the monitoring system to run a 50 ms time window. Set pulsed stimuli to 100 \u03bcs and 4 Hz. Set the event capture threshold to 100 \u03bcV.\nSurgical procedure\n\t\nWear sterile surgical gloves and use povidone iodine with cotton swabs to disinfect the neck surgical site.Make a transverse collar incision about 10-15 cm in length with a scalpel to expose the neck and the larynx.\nRaise the subplatysmal flap 1 cm cranially from the clavicle to the hyoid bone.\nRemove the strap muscles and visualize the tracheal rings and nerves. Use monopolar and bipolar electrocautery to assist the surgical dissection and hemostasis.\nLocalize, identify, and carefully expose the EBSLN, RLN, and VN with a handheld stimulation probe.\nPosition an automated periodic stimulation (APS) electrode on one side of VN for stimulating during continuous IONM (CIONM). Connect the APS electrode with the monitoring system. Set pulsed stimuli to 1 Hz, 100 \u00b5s, and 1 mA.\nAt end of experiments, euthanize all piglets by the veterinarian.\n3. Electrical Stimulation\nNote: To apply the 3R principle in porcine IONM studies, always perform repeatable electrophysiology studies that do not cause nerve injury before performing experiments that may cause nerve injury. This can be used to study the intensity, safety, and cardiopulmonary effects11,17. The IONM equipment can be classified as stimulation equipment or recording equipment (Figure 2A).\nEvaluate the baseline EMG responses of the target nerves, including the EBSLN, RLN, and VN (Figures 2B, 2C).\n\t\nStart with an initial stimulation current of 0.1-mA current and increase stimulation in 0.1-mA increments until an EMG response is detected and recorded.\nFurther increase the current until the maximal EMG response is obtained.\nRecord the baseline amplitude, latency, and waveform of the EMG response.\nDefine the minimal stimulus level as the lowest current (mA) that clearly evoked EMG activity of >100 \u00b5V. Define the maximal stimulus level as the lowest current that evoked the maximal EMG response.\nEvaluate the Safety of electrical stimulation11,19\nApply a continuous 1-minute stimulus at the fifth tracheal ring level of the VN or RLN.Progressively increase the stimulus current from 1 mA to 30 mA.\nDuring VN stimulation, evaluate hemodynamic stability by monitoring of heart rate, ECG, and invasive arterial blood pressure.\nFinally, evaluate nerve function integrity by comparing EMG responses proximal to the nerve stimulation site before and after each level of stimulation is applied.\nEffect of anesthetics (muscle relaxants and their reversals)12,20\n\tNote: Improper use of NMBAs is a potential cause of unsuccessful IONM. The proposed animal model was used to compare recovery profiles among different depolarizing NMBAs (e.g., succinylcholine) and nondepolarizing NMBAs (e.g., rocuronium) at varying doses and to identify the optimal NMBA for use in IONM. The animal model can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of NMBA reversal drugs (e.g., sugammadex) for rapidly restoring neuromuscular function suppressed by rocuronium.\n\t\nFirstly, apply C-IONM and use the automatically calibrated baseline latencies and amplitudes of EMG as control data.\nAdminister a bolus injection of 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium in a volume of 10 mg/mL and observe the real-time EMG changes.\nThree minutes after injection, perform one injection of 2 mg/kg sugammadex in a volume of 100 mg/mL as a rapid bolus. Record the recovery profile of laryngeal EMG for 20 minutes.\nStimulation electrodes (Stimulation probes/dissectors) (Figure 3)17\n\tNote: There are different types of stimulation electrodes that can be used for nerve stimulation during IONM, e.g., monopolar probes (Figure 3A), bipolar probes (Figure 3B), and stimulation dissectors (Figure 3C).\n\t\nTo mimic direct stimulation of nerves during surgery, apply 1 mA stimulation to the EBSLN, RLN, and VN without overlying fascia.\nTo mimic indirect mapping and localizing of the nerve position before visual identification during surgery, apply 1 mA stimulation at a 1- and 2-mm distance away from the nerves at overlying fascia.Record and compare the EMG responses between different types of stimulation electrodes.\nRecording electrodes (EMG tubes/needle electrodes/pre-gelled skin electrodes) (Figure 4)\nUse the animal model to evaluate how rotation or upward/downward displacement of the EMG tube electrode (Figure 4A) affects the stability of the EMG signal. Additionally, use the animal model to compare the EMG responses between different electrode types (e.g., needle electrodes and adhesive pre-gelled electrodes, Figure 4B) and different recording approaches (e.g., transcutaneous/percutaneous and transcartilage approaches, Figures 4C and 4D) in terms of feasibility, stability, and accuracy during IONM.\nFor a feasibility study, apply a 1 mA stimulus current to bilateral EBSLNs, VNs and RLNs. Record and compare EMG responses evoked by each electrode tested (i.e., EMG tube, transcutaneous, percutaneous, and transcartilage electrodes).\nFor a stability study, evaluate and compare EMG signal stability in C-IONM under experimentally induced cricoid/tracheal cartilage displacement.\nFor an accuracy study, evaluate and compare the accuracy of the tested electrodes in C-IONM for identifying EMG signal degradation under RLN injury.\n4. RLN injury study (Figure 5)\nIn accordance with the 3R principle, perform RLN injury experiments in the porcine model after all repeatable electrophysiology studies are completed. Perform tests of nerve segments from proximal nerve segments to distal nerve segments (i.e., proceed from the caudal part of the RLN to the cranial part of the RLN).\nUse C-IONM to confirm and compare patterns of real-time changes in evoked laryngeal EMG signals during and after acute RLN injuries with different injury mechanisms (e.g., traction, clamping, transection, or thermal injuries) (Figures 5A and 5B). Use C-IONM for continuous real-time display and recordation of EMG changes and sequential recoveries throughout the experiment (Figure 5C).\nCollect injured RLN segments for histopathological analysis of morphological alterations caused by the nerve injury experiments.\nTraction compression/stretch injuryNote: Traction compression or stretch injuries are the most common intraoperative RLN injuries. Experimentally induce traction stress and observe the resulting electrophysiological EMG changes and histopathological changes.\n\t\nTraction compression injury13\nWrap a thin plastic loop (e.g., a vascular loop 1.3-mm wide) around the RLN and use a force gauge to apply retraction with 50 g of tension (Figure 5A). This scheme mimics an RLN trapped against a dense, fibrous band or a crossing artery at the region of Berry\u2019s ligament during medial traction of the thyroid lobe.\nTraction stretch injury16\nWrap the RLN with a wider elastic material (e.g., a 10-mm wide silicone Penrose drain), and use a force gauge to retract the RLN with 50 g of tension) This scheme mimics an RLN adhered to or encased in the goiter capsule and stretched forward during medial traction.\nClamping injury\n\tNote: Intraoperative mechanical trauma to the RLN usually results from poor exposure or visual misidentification of the RLN. 13,16\nAfter the traction compression RLN injury experiment, pinch the distal segment of the RLN with hemostatic forceps for one second. This scheme mimics the nerve being inadvertently clamped owing to visual misidentification as a vessel during the operation. Record the accompanying EMG signal change for comparison with further histopathological findings of the nerve specimen.\nThermal injury\n\tNote: Most intraoperative RLN thermal injuries result from thermal spread when electrocautery devices and various energy-based devices (EBDs) are used to induce hemostasis near the RLN. Like traction injury, thermal injury is rarely visible to the naked eye. Therefore, perform animal IONM experiments to determine the best model for evaluating the pathophysiology of RLN thermal injury and to test the thermal tolerance14 and the safety of EBDs15,18.\n\t\nUse C-IONM to register the EMG changes continuously throughout the experiment.For the activation study, investigate how energy-based devices (EBD) can be safely applied for hemostasis and dissection near the RLN during surgery (Figure 5B).\n\t\t\nActivate the EBD (electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system, set power at level 2, and the energy discontinues automatically by 2 to 4 seconds) at a 5-mm distance away from the RLN.\nIf EMG signals remain stable after several tests, perform a further test at the narrower distance (e.g., 2-mm, and followed by 1mm distance).\nIf any substantial EMG change occurs after any test the experiment is complete and followed by continuous real-time EMG recording for at least 20 minutes.\nFor the cooling study, evaluate the cooling time to determine post-activation optimal EBD cooling parameters.\n\t\t\nContact the activated EBD on the RLN directly after a 5 second cooling time.\nIf the EMG signals remain stable after three tests, test the shorter cooling time (e.g., 2 seconds, and followed by 1 second).\nIf the EMG remains stable after repeated tests, confirm the safety of the EBD by touching the RLN immediately after activation.\nSubscription Required.

This procedure details how to obtain blood, xenograft tumor, bone marrow and spleen organ.\nNote: We recommend a direct cardiac puncture without opening the thorax for a quick and safe process.\nCritical: It requires practice and some prefer directly taking the blood from the visible heart, which particularly suits for smaller species.\nNote: Blood should be taken as soon as possible after the death of the animal as blood can coagulate rapidly.\nNote: Fix the needle to the 21G syringe and carefully loosen the needle cover. Expel the air from the syringe.Place the animal on its back, in a horizontal position. Clean the thoracic fur with ethanol.\nLocate the thoracic cage and xiphoid process (the lower part of the sternum) with one hand.\nNote: making sure that the animal is well positioned (i.e., the xiphoid process is well centered).\nWith the other hand, insert the needle under the xiphoid process at about 30 degrees to the left.\nWhile inserting the needle, gently pull the plunger to aspirate until the heart is perforated and blood begins to flow.\nAs soon as blood is flowing, continue pulling the plunger without moving the needle to avoid any more perforations in the heart, which will stop the flow.\nCritical: If no blood appears in the needle, the action should be repeated. If the flow stops rapidly, the heart may have been perforated on the back: slowly withdraw and adjust the needle to restore the flow.\nAs soon as enough blood is collected, release pressure on the plunger and withdraw the needle.\nSlowly expel the blood from the syringe into the Heparin/EDTA tubes.\nNote: To avoid damaging blood cells, we recommend disposing of the needle before expelling blood.\nOptional: A syringe previously soaked with heparin can be used.

Proper titration of antibodies, correct voltages and correcting for the spectral overlap are all part of a lengthy but very critical process to ensure that the panel works properly (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). To correct for this spectral overlap, a process of fluorescence compensation is used. This ensures that the fluorescence detected in a particular detector derives from the fluorochrome that is being measured.\nHere are some general steps for compensation and panel optimization (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nDetermine which fluorophores are involved in spectral overlap and select compensation controls.\nNote: Include an unstained sample to correct for autofluorescence inherent to cells.\nCritical: Compensation controls are samples stained with single-color antibodies that are conjugated to the same fluorophores as those used in the experiment. If sample availability is critical, consider using compensation beads instead of cells.\nCollect compensation controls and experimental samples on the flow cytometer using identical instrument settings.\nNote: Make sure that positive signal is as brighter as possible, at least as bright as your experimental sample positive signal.\nUse software to generate compensation matrices that describe the spectral overlap between the fluorophores.\nNote: These matrices are used to mathematically adjust the fluorescence signals in each channel to correct for the spectral overlap.\nApply the compensation matrices to the experimental data to correct for spectral overlap.\nAnalyze the data to identify the different cell populations.Critical: It is important to optimize the compensation settings to minimize compensation errors and to validate the compensation strategy using appropriate positive and negative controls. It is also important to note that over-compensation can lead to inaccurate measurements and should be avoided.\nControls and Fluorescent minus one (FMOs)\nSetting up the right controls is critical to determining how your cells are responding to treatment. It\u2019s also important for correctly interpreting your data and drawing correct conclusions.\nNote: Without the proper controls, you would not be able to neither compensate your flow cytometry experiments nor to identify your cells of interest correctly (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: The Fluorescence Minus One Control (FMO) is a type of control used to properly interpret flow cytometry data. It is used to:\nIdentify and gate cells in the context of data spread due to the multiple fluorochromes in a given panel.\nUse a FMO control that contains all the fluorochromes in a panel, except the one that is being measured (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: The FMO control ensures that the any spread of the fluorochromes into the channel of interest is properly identified.\nEach day that an experiment is carried out, an unstained sample has to be run to determine the autofluorescence of the samples.\nImmune cell staining\nThe aim of this part is to accomplish identification of immune cells that infiltrate or surround the tumor cells.\nMembrane staining\nTiming: 1\u00a0h 30\u00a0min\nThis section details the procedure of antibody staining of membrane antigen in single cell suspension.\nPrepare a single-cell suspension using the appropriate protocol (see Generation of single cell suspension protocol) and adjust the cell amount from 600.000 to 106 cells in staining medium in each tube.\nCentrifuge the single cell suspension 400\u2013600\u00a0g during 5\u00a0min.Note: Prepare as many staining tubes as needed: unstained control, and individually sample for each antibody mixture panel.\nAdd the optimized dilution mixture of antibodies (Table\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) to the respective tubes and incubate them 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark.\nCentrifuge the 1.5\u00a0mL tube at 400\u2013600\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min.\nWash the cells once with ice-cold staining medium at 400\u2013600\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min.\nResuspend with 100\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcL FACS buffer.\nNote: You can repeat the washing step to better remove the antibodies before analyzing the cells in the cytometer.\nOptional: You can fix the cells with PFA 1%. If the samples are fixed, they can be stored at 4\u03bfC during 24\u00a0h before analysis, otherwise they must be analyzed the same day.\nAnalyze the stained cell preparation in the cytometer (See flow cytometry acquisition section).\nIntracellular staining\nTiming: 2 h\u20132\u00a0h 30\u00a0min\nThis section delineates the procedure of antibody staining of intracellular antigen in single cell suspension.\nPrepare a single cell suspension using a specific protocol depending on the tissue (See generation of single cell suspension[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.3] section).\nFirst, we have to perform the cell membrane staining protocol or cell surface markers (See membrane staining[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.14] section).\nAfter this staining, centrifuge de 1.5\u00a0mL tube at 400\u2013600\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 100\u00a0\u03bcL of staining medium to wash the cells.\nAfter the last wash, discard the supernatant and pulse vortex the sample to completely dissociate the pellet.\nCritical: You should obtain a good suspension of individual cells in order to have a good preparation. You can also pipette up and down the pellet to homogenize better.\nFix the cells by adding 200\u00a0\u03bcL of Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer (Invitrogen, cat. no. 00-5123-43) (1:3 dilution with Fixation/Permeabilization Diluent (Invitrogen, cat. no. 00-5223-56) to each 1.5\u00a0mL tube.Pipette up and down the pellet to homogenize better.\nIncubate 30\u201360\u00a0min at RT.\nNote: Protect from light.\nOptional: Samples can be incubated for up to 18\u00a0h at 2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C in the dark.\nCentrifuge samples at 400\u2013600\u00a0g at room temperature for 5\u00a0min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200\u00a0\u03bcL 1\u00d7 Permeabilization Buffer (Invitrogen, cat. no. 00-8333-56) (1 part of 10\u00d7 Permeabilization Buffer with 9 parts of Milli-Q water) to each tube.\nCentrifuge samples 400\u2013600\u00a0g at room temperature for 5\u00a0min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRepeat Step 69.\nResuspend pellet in residual volume.\nOptional: Block with 2% normal mouse/rat serum by adding 2\u00a0\u03bcL directly to the cells. Incubate at room temperature for 15\u00a0min.\nWithout washing, add the recommended amount of directly conjugated antibody for the detection of intracellular antigen(s)/markers (See Table\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nIncubate for at least 30\u00a0min at RT in the dark.\nCentrifuge samples at 400\u2013600\u00a0g at room temperature for 5\u00a0min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nAdd 200\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 Permeabilization Buffer to each 1.5\u00a0mL tube.\nCentrifuge samples at 400\u2013600\u00a0g at RT for 5\u00a0min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRepeat Step 73.\nResuspend stained cells in an appropriate volume of Flow Cytometry Buffer (100\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcL of FACSFlow).\nAnalyze by flow cytometry (See flow cytometry acquisition and phenotyping section).\nFlow cytometry acquisition\nFlow cytometer setup and quality control\nTiming: 1 h\nSetting up a flow cytometer involves several steps. Here are some general steps that may vary slightly depending on the specific flow cytometer model.\nPower on the flow cytometer and the computer that controls it.\nCheck that the lasers are working correctly and calibrated according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.\nSet up the appropriate filters and detectors for the fluorophores used in the experiment.Adjust the gain and voltage settings for the detectors to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio for each fluorescence channel.\nPerform a quality control check with calibration beads to ensure the flow cytometer is working correctly.\nRun compensation tubes to perform compensation and correct for the spectral overlap. Once voltage settings are properly set and compensation done, make sure that your experimental samples are recorded using the same settings.\nPrepare the sample and load it into the sample injection port or chamber.\nRun the sample through the flow cytometer and collect data.\nAnalyze the data using appropriate software such as FlowJo 8.7 (FlowJo Software, BD) or BD\u00a0FACSDiva Software to generate scatter plots and histograms to identify the different cell populations.\nNote: It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for specific flow cytometer models and to maintain and clean the instrument regularly to ensure optimal performance.\nCollecting samples\nTiming: 1\u20134\u00a0h depending on the tubes\nThis step details the acquisition of our samples using the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer from our institution.\nNote: You might have to modify this step to accommodate to your institute\u2019s instruments and guidelines (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nTransfer the samples to individual FACS tubes.\nNote: If your instrument has a plate reader attached follow your institute\u2019s core facility\u2019s guidelines.\nUse your unstained control to set the voltages of your FSC-A, SSC-A plot depending on the cell type (Blood, Bone Marrow, Spleen or Tumor cells (Figures\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A\u20133D).\nIn the FSC-A and SSC-A plot, draw a gate around all cell events profile (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nIn the FSC-A and FSC-H plot, draw a gate around the diagonal to select only the single cells (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nDraw other dot plots showing the different fluorochromes combinations depending on each immune panel.Note: Use your FMO controls to set the proper gates in each dot plot.\nNote: These controls will allow you to identify data spread in your fluorochrome combinations (see controls and fluorescent minus one (FMOs)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.12] section).\nNote: Once spread has been identified, the gate will be correctly set to show real positivity/negativity for a given marker.\nAcquire all samples and ensure that record at least 10.000 events of your selected population.\nPerform the acquisition of the stained tubes using the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer.\nOnce acquisition is completed, export your data according to your institute\u2019s core facility\u2019s guidelines.\nNote: This procedure will be explained in detail in the next section.\nUsing BD FACSDiva (or the available acquisition software in your institute\u2019s core facility) create a new data acquisition matrix.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue dissection and embedding in LMA\nTiming: approximately 75\u00a0min\nThe subsequent procedure describes the embedding of the dissected brain tissues in low melting agarose in order to facilitate the generation of robust tissue sections.\nExpose pregnant mice to lethal overdose of isoflurane and euthanize by cervical dislocation.\nSection the abdomen to reveal the uterus. Remove the uterine horns and place them in cold PBS 1\u00d7.\nCarefully remove the embryos from their yolk sac and isolate their heads. For embryos at E10.5-E12.5 it is advised to dissect the heads while for embryos at E14.5 or later stages it is suggested to dissect out the brains.\nClean the isolated tissues by performing 3 PBS 1\u00d7 washes.\nPut a 48-well plate on ice and add 500\u00a0\u03bcL of LMA 3% while still in liquid form (45\u00b0C). Wait 1\u00a0min until the temperature becomes tolerable.\nRemove the excess liquid from each tissue using a perforated spoon and a piece of absorbent paper(\u223c40\u00b0C).\nPlace the tissue in the well and gently swirl with a pipette tip until the tissue is totally covered with LMA.\nPlace the tissue at the appropriate orientation carefully and support with the pipette tip until LMA starts to solidify.\nLeave the 48-well plate on ice until LMA is completely solid and afterwards place it at 4\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min.\nCritical: It is important for the tissue to be totally covered with LMA in order not to touch the bottom of the well plate and not to be exposed on the top.\nNote: The orientation of the tissue inside the well depends on the desired sectioning plane (coronal, sagittal, or transverse). For generation of coronal sections place the brain cerebellum vertically pointing the bottom of the well and the olfactory bulbs facing upwards.Pause Point: Place the remaining quantity of LMA that does not contain any tissue residue in a tube and when solid store at 4\u00b0C for up to 1\u00a0week.\nGeneration of brain sections\nTiming: approximately 15\u00a0min, depending on the tissue size\nThe following steps describe the generation of thick sections from freshly isolated mouse brain by using a vibrating microtome and highlight the appropriate settings depending on the developmental stage that is examined.\nRemove the embedded tissue from the 48-well plate by gently slide a micro spatula toward the well circumference until the embedded tissue springs out.\nRemove the excess amount of LMA with a scalpel and create a shape of trapezoid so that its bigger base touches the vibratome plate and its smaller base faces toward the vibratome blade. To generate coronal sections at the level of the cortex, the rostral part of the brain should face toward the blade\nStabilize the embedded tissue on the vibratome platform with a thin layer of instant glue and ensure that the sample will not be displaced by the vibratome blade. Wait 2\u00a0min until the glue is dried.\nPlace the vibratome plate in the tank with the appropriate screwdrivers and fill with cold PBS 1\u00d7 to fully cover the sample.\nCut serial sections of 250\u00a0\u03bcm thickness. Adjust the vibratome settings according to the developmental stage studied. For later embryonic stages (E14.5 to E18.5) adjust the speed at 0,225\u00a0mm/s and frequency at 50\u00a0Hz while for earlier developmental stages (E10.5 to E12.5) and smaller tissues it is preferable to modify the settings of the vibratome (speed: 0,125\u00a0mm/s and frequency 70\u00a0Hz) to avoid destroying the tissue. In general, the higher the speed and the lower the frequency, the more suitable it is for vulnerable tissues.Prepare a 24-well plate with cold PBS 1\u00d7 and keep it on ice.\nCollect consecutive sections of the brain with thin paint brushes and place them in separate wells of the 24-well plate on ice.\nNote: Given that the tissue at this stage is unfixed, the sections are fragile. Thus, it is advised to gently handle the sections by using the appropriate brushes. In case it is not possible for the sections to be removed of the brush try to slowly move the brush inside the well containing PBS 1\u00d7 or pour additional PBS 1\u00d7 over the brush. If the section tangles within the brush hairs, it becomes difficult to come out completely intact.\nPre-extraction and fixation of brain sections\nTiming: 1 h\nThe pre-extraction procedure aims to remove the freely diffusing proteins while the DNA-bound proteins remain intact within the cells. The following steps are performed in floating sections. It is important that the sections remain moist during the entire protocol to maintain tissue integrity and in order to avoid auto-fluorescence effect during subsequent imaging.\nSelect the sections that include the dorsal cortex. To get representative results, it is preferable to select two sections per sample in order to cover frontal and caudal cortical regions. For earlier embryonic stages one section is sufficient.\nTo remove the cytoplasmic soluble proteins, incubate the sections in the freshly prepared CSK buffer for 20\u00a0min on ice. Avoid shaking of the sections at this stage since the tissue is very fragile before fixation (Troubleshooting 2).\nWash once with cold PBS 1\u00d7 on ice.\nFix the sections with PFA 4% for 30\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C.\nWash once with cold PBS 1\u00d7 on ice.Critical: Keep 1\u20132 sections as control samples by skipping the incubation with the CSK buffer. Control sections are immediately fixed with PFA 4%.\nPause Point: Sections can be stored in 1\u00a0mM NaN3 solution in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 1\u00a0day in case that it is not possible to perform the following procedure at the same day.\nImmunofluorescent staining and EdU detection (day 1)\nTiming: at least 23 h\nThis process elaborates on the details of immunofluorescence, detection of thymidine analog, and mounting to the previously generated sections. Perform the staining in multiwell plates by removing and filling with the appropriate solutions the wells that contain the sections. The use of 24-well plates is recommended. Avoid transferring the sections within wells to maintain their morphology.\nWash the floating sections with PBT (PBS-Triton 0.1%) - BSA 1% three times for at least 30\u00a0min each. The first two washes should be performed at 4\u00b0C while the last one at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C.\nIncubate the sections in PBS-Triton 0.5% for 20\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C.\nWash with PBT-BSA 1% three times at 4\u00b0C for at least 30\u00a0min each.\nBlock the sections in blocking solution (1% FBS in PBT) for at least 1\u00a0h at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C.\nWash with PBT-BSA 1% for at least 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nPerform the step of EdU staining by incubating the sections with the EdU detection solution (reaction buffer 10\u00d7, catalyst solution, dye azide 10\u00a0mM, buffer additive 10\u00d7) at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. From this point the sections should be protected from light.\nWash with PBT three times at 4\u00b0C for at least 30\u00a0min each.\nIncubate the sections with the primary antibody against MCM2 (dilution 1:500 in blocking solution) for16\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nImmunofluorescent staining and EdU detection (day 2)\nTiming: at least 22 hRemove the primary antibody solution.\nWash the sections with PBT at 4\u00b0C three times for at least 2\u00a0h each.\nIncubate with fluorescent secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000 in blocking solution) for16\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nImmunofluorescent staining and EdU detection (day 3)\nTiming: 3.5 h\nRemove the secondary antibody solution.\nWash the sections with PBT at 4\u00b0C three times for at least 30\u00a0min each.\nPerform nuclear DNA staining with DAPI (dilution 1:1,500 in PBS 1\u00d7) for 7\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C.\nWash the sections with PBT at 4\u00b0C three times for at least 30\u00a0min each.\nAdd a drop of PBS 1\u00d7 on a microscope slide and transfer the sections by using thin paint brushes and sharp forceps.\nRemove the excess amount of PBS with a piece of absorbent paper.\nAdd Mowiol 4-88 solution on the top of the section until to fully covered (60\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcL per section) and gently drop the coverslip.\nKeep the slides horizontally at 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C until the Mowiol is polymerized. For long-term storage keep them at 4\u00b0C.\nImaging and analysis of DNA-bound MCM complexes\nFor the imaging of the mounted brain sections use a confocal system equipped with a fluorescent microscope. Use at least a 63\u00d7 high NA oil immersion lens to focus on the dorsal cortex. To analyze the MCM complexes, acquire images with an electronic zoom of 3 or higher with at least a 1,024\u00a0\u00d7 1,024 pixels resolution.Before the analysis, it is important to confirm that the soluble proteins have been sufficiently removed while the DNA-bound proteins are intact on the tissue. In the section incubated with CSK the cells that are in S phase (distinguished as EdU+) exhibit distinct patterns of nuclear MCM2 staining, which represent the recruitment of MCM complexes in the origins of DNA replication. In contrast, the cells in the section incubated without CSK present a uniform nuclear staining for MCM2, corresponding to both bound and soluble fractions of MCM proteins. A representative image of confocal acquisition of brain sections incubated or not in CSK buffer is shown in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/354-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

The nucleus volume of a mammalian cell is between 600\u20131,500\u00a0\u03bcm3, and therefore images of higher volume will include more than two layers of cells, making the analysis of single cells impossible.\nThe intensity of MCM staining in CSK treated sections is representative of the DNA-bound MCM complexes. Fluorescent intensity per nucleus is quantified with the open-source platform ImageJ.\nNote: Intensities measurements are performed in sum slices projection. If necessary, use the subtract background plugin of ImageJ with a rolling ball radius equal to the average size of the nuclei to remove the intensities of the background due to unspecific staining.", "Harvest mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from plates by gentle pipetting, give a wash with PBS and prepare the suspensions of 1.0 x 105, 2.0 x 105 and 4.0 x 105 cells per ml in RPMI-10 medium. (BMDCs are derived by culturing mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of GM-CSF. Briefly, add 4 x 106 bone-marrow cells per well of 6-well plate in RPMI-10 medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF. Remove culture medium along with non-adherent cells on day 3 and day 5, and fresh 4.0 ml GM-CSF-supplemented medium to each well. Harvest immature DCs on day 7 by gently pipetting. After giving a wash in RPMI-10 medium, cells can be used for subsequent experiments. The\u00a0purity of DCs derived following this protocol is ~85%. These cells can be used directly in allo-MLR or can be further purified.)To analyze the ability of DCs to induce T-cell proliferation, add 50 \u00b5l of DC suspensions (equivalent to 0.5 x 104, 1.0 x 104 and 2.0 x 104 DCs) per well in a round bottom plate in triplicates.(It is necessary to plate the increasing number of DCs to achieve an increasing ratio of stimulator cells to responder cells. It is advised not\u00a0to add DCs into outer wells of the plate because culture media tend to evaporate from these wells at higher rates. Instead, these wells can be filled with autoclaved distilled water).To analyze the ability of DCs to induce T-cell polarization, similarly add 50 \u00b5l of 2.0 x 105 cells/ml DC suspension (= 1.0 x 104 cells) per well in a round bottom plate in triplicates.Add the desired stimuli such as LPS or heat-killed mycobacteria to plated DCs and adjust final volume of total contents per well to 100 \u00b5l.[Dilute stock solution of LPS or mycobacterial suspension to required concentration in RPMI-10 medium. LPS could be used at a concentration of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5g/ml, whereas heat-killed bacteria (prepared by autoclaving) can be used preferably at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 to 10].Keep plates in a humidified CO2 incubator for 24 h.Next day, isolate CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from the spleen of na\u00efve allogeneic mice using a negative selection kit as suggested by manufacturer.

Note: If DCs are derived from C57BL/6 mice, lymphocytes can be prepared from Balb/c mice.Irradiate DCs with gamma-rays in a gamma-irradiation chamber (irradiation dose, 25 Gy). Irradiation will prevent the proliferation of DCs, which could otherwise give false results.Adjust concentration of lymphocytes to 1.0 x 106 cells/ml.

Animal Ethics\nBefore performing the long duration hyperthermia on mice make sure that the procedure has been approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All the procedures discussed in this paper and shown in the accompanying video were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Immunology.\n2. Understanding Hyperthermia\nWhole Body Hyperthermia (WBH) is delivered by placing the animals in prewarmed cages that are placed in incubator maintained at 39.5\u00b0C. During the standardization of protocol, a temperature sensor was surgically implanted in the mice and their body temperature was monitored in different experimental conditions. It was observed that upon placing the animals in heated environment, their temperature gradually increased from 37 \u00b0C to up to 42 \u00b0C over the duration of 100 min (Figure 1). The resulting \"spike\" in temperature is intriguing as the internal body temperature shot even higher than the external environmental temperature. \nWhen the body temperature exceeded 40 \u00b0C, the animal would show signs of stress and dehydration such as wetting around the snout. Increase the body temperature beyond 40 \u00b0C, will lead to wetting and irreversible stress or even death of animals due to heat stress. So it is important to prevent the temperature spikes during the course of hyperthermia. \nThis phenomenon of high temperature spikes is associated with the physical hyperactivity of animal during hyperthermia exposure. Similar temperature spikes were observed by other groups too and were associated with the physical hyperactivity of the animal upon being introduced to environment having higher temperatures 10. \nIn our protocol, mice are immobilized during the hyperthermia exposure. As shown in Figure 2, immobilization of animal prevents the temperature spikes.We have used 8-12 weeks old BALB/Cj mice for demonstrating this protocol. The protocol is not restricted to a particular type/strain of the mice.\n3. Preparing for the Experiment\n3.1 Incubator\nThis experiment can be performed in a normal CO2 incubator as they have a good temperature control. Disconnect CO2 gas supply and remove water holding tray of the  CO2 incubator. In some models of incubators it is possible to switch off the CO2 controller. Arrange shelves of the incubator so that a mice cage could be placed conveniently inside. Set the temperature of the incubator at 39.5 \u00b0C.\n3.2 Cages\nTypically, the hyperthermia experiment is performed on 4 mice at a time. Two cages are required; one is placed inside the incubator and the other is placed outside at room temperature. Bedding of cages is avoided, as the patches of bedding become wet with time which results in non-uniform temperature inside the cage. The outside cage should have food pellets and water bottle. \n3.3 Mice immobilization tubes\nDuring the course of first 4 cycles of hyperthermia mice are immobilized in perforated tubes. These immobilization tubes can be made from 50 ml 'centrifuge' tubes by piercing 3 mm holes all over its body and four of such tubes will be required. The 50ml tube can conveniently immobilize BALB/Cj mice which are older than 8 weeks.  Tubes of appropriate sizes may be required for some unusually different strain of mice or for mice which are very young or older than 50 weeks.\nPlace immobilization tubes and a cage inside the incubator maintained at 39.5 \u00b0C. Wait for at least 2 hour so that the cage and immobilization tubes attain the temperature of the incubator.  \n4.  First cycle of the HyperthermiaMice may experience dehydration during the hyperthermia exposure. Therefore before beginning the experiment, administer 0.5 ml normal saline intraperitoneally to every mouse.  Use a 26 G needle with 1 ml syringe.\nQuickly take out the cage placed in the incubator, place one animal in each immobilization tubes and place the cage back in the incubator. Record the time. It is essential to keep the cage at the same place in the incubator every time.\nAfter 90 min, take out the cage from the incubator. Release animals from the immobilization tubes and place them in the cage at normal temperature with easy access to food and water. Place empty immobilization tubes back in the incubator. \nAfter 15 min, the second cycle of hyperthermia is started by delivering 0.5 ml saline intraperitoneally to every mouse. \nThey are then immobilized in 50 ml perforated immobilization tubes and placed in the incubator. \n5. Subsequent Hyperthermia Cycles\nFor first 4 cycles, it is essential to immobilize mice during the hyperthermia exposure and for the first two cycles, saline injection is given before beginning the hyperthermia period. \nAfter these cycles of hyperthermia followed by rest are completed, mice get acclimatize and do not become hyperactive during the hyperthermia exposure. The intraperitoneal injection of saline may not be necessary if mice readily take food and water during the resting time.\n6. After All the Cycles Completed, the Final Step is to Examine the AnimalsThere should not be any death during the hyperthermia cycles. Every animal has to be watched very carefully in the first few cycles. Rapidly look for any wetting around the snout. This symptom is a signature of dehydration. Mice with such symptoms should immediately be given 0.5 ml normal saline i.p and rest at room temperature.  Most of the immobilized mice will not require any additional care and will successfully bear the stress the hyperthermia. \nAfter completing required cycles, animals may look weak and dehydrated but they will quickly recover within few hours. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3801/3801fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "The procedures described below have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. All rats received humane care in compliance with the Mount Sinai \u201cGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\u201d.\n1. Preparation for Surgery\nAutoclave Cooley-Mayo curved scissors (large scissors), straight Iris scissors (small scissors), McPherson-Vannas Iris scissors (back scissors), Wangensteen tissue forceps (atraumatic forceps), Gerald tissue forceps, plain wire speculum (self-retaining retractor), small vessel cauterizer, gauze, double-ended probe, thin vascular needle holder, and Micro-Jacobson mosquito hemostatic forceps (mosquito).\n2. Preparation and Intubation of Rats\nAdminister a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine analgesia (0.1 mg/kg) in 6\u20138 week old male, Sprague-Dawley rats, 30 min prior to surgery.\nPlace the rat individually in a chamber exposed to isoflurane 4% and oxygen (1 L/min) for 3\u20134 min until the rat is properly anesthetized (i.e., unconscious, breathing slowly, and unresponsive to touch or sound).\nIntubation of Rats\nRemove the rat from the chamber and tape the rat to a board so the rat lays flat on its back, with the mouth at the edge of the board. Use string to hold the rat by the two front teeth so that the neck remains flat/straight.\nPlace a fiber optic goose light source above the neck over the larynx, lift and hold the tongue with fingers, and move the epiglottis up to visualize the vocal cords. The trachea should be brightly lit behind the vocal cords; adjust the position of the light until the trachea is bright.\nIntubate the rats by inserting a 16 G catheter into the larynx within 60 s\u00a0of removing the rat from the chamber as they wake quickly. If the rat wakes before successful intubation, put the rat back and repeat.Immediately connect the rat to the ventilator to resume isoflurane and oxygen delivery. Confirm the intubation using a cold mirror to observe condensation of the humidity in the exhaled breath from the catheter. Make sure the animal is still breathing by the expansion of the chest.\nConnect the rat to the ventilator. Set the oxygen to flow at 1 L/min. Set the ventilation rate to 70 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.35\u20130.45 mL. Set positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 2\u20134 cm H2O. Reduce isoflurane to 2\u20133%.\nPlace the rat under the microscope in the right decubitus position on a heating pad at 37 \u00b0C. Tape the front legs down. Shave the left thorax behind the front leg until the end of the rib cage with clippers. Clean the surgical area with gauze and 10% povidone-iodine solution, followed by 70% ethanol (three times).\nPlace the pulse oximeter on the rat\u2019s foot and monitor the heart rate and oxygen saturation throughout the surgery. Heart rate should be between 200\u2013500 bpm and oxygen saturation should be >95%.\n3. Preparation of Sterile Environment\nVisualize the surgical area under the microscope. This must be done first because the microscope cannot be adjusted once the environment is sterile.\nPut on sterile, surgical gloves. Do not touch anything besides the sterilized instruments, the surgical drapes, and the surgical area of the rat\u2019s body.\nPlace a sterile drape over the rat\u2019s body and on the instrument tray to create a sterile environment.\nWith sterile gloves, place sterile instruments on the sterile instrument tray.\n4. Left Pneumonectomy Surgical ProcedureUse Cooley-Mayo scissors and Gerald tissue forceps to cut a small hole in the surgical drape. The hole should be about 2\u20133 cm in diameter to fully visualize the incision but not too large so that only sterilized skin is exposed.\nMake a 2 cm long lateral incision in the left thorax using a surgical blade. Use gauze and the electrocautery pen to manage bleeding/maintain hemostasis. Use the Cooley-Mayo scissors to cut each layer of tissue until the ribs and intercostal muscles are exposed.\nEntering Intercostal Space\nUse the mosquito to make a hole through the muscle of the third intercostal space.\nUse the double-ended probe to move the lung out of the way to visualize the pulmonary artery. The investigator may enter another intercostal space if the pulmonary artery is not accessible.\nUse iris scissors and McPherson-Vannas iris scissors (back scissors) to open the intercostal muscles to about 1\u20132 cm. Use the electrocautery pen to stop any bleeding.\nPlace a small, self-retaining retractor to hold the ribs and muscles open.\nOpen only the left pleura and move the left lung down lower in the abdomen to allow access to the pulmonary artery and bronchus. Load a medium hemoclip into the ligating clip applicator.\nLigation of the Left Main Bronchus and Left Main Pulmonary Artery\nLift the upper portion of the left lung carefully with the Wangensteen atraumatic forceps to expose the pulmonary artery.\nClip the pulmonary artery by closing the clip and applicator around the artery. Be careful not to close or rupture the left azygos vein. Do not clamp too forcefully otherwise, the vessel can rupture.\nOpen the incision further using the tonsil to separate the muscle fibers.\nLoad another medium hemoclip into the ligating clip applicator so that it is ready.Use the atraumatic forceps to lift the lower portion of the lung out of the incision until the left main bronchus and left pulmonary vein are visualized. Atraumatic forceps must be used pull to move the lung up and out of the incision. Since the lung is too large to be pulled out in one motion without tearing the tissue, the issue forceps are necessary to hold the lung in place while the atraumatic forceps are used carefully to pull more lung out.\nLigate the left main bronchus and left main pulmonary vein together by closing the applicator around them. Do not clamp the vein and bronchus too forcefully otherwise, the vessel can rupture.\nRemove the lung with scissors. Be careful not to cut or tear out the clip. Use a small piece of sterile gauze to absorb any blood and make sure there is no bleeding.\nClosure of the Ribs and Intercostal Muscles\nBefore closing the intercostal muscles, insert a 16 G catheter into the thoracic cavity away from the surgical incision and into the seventh intercostal space. Make sure the investigator can visualize the needle so as not to puncture any vital organs or vessels.\nImmediately remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place. This will be used as a chest tube.\nClose the ribs and intercostal muscles with a 4-0 prolene suture.\nClose the skin and subcutaneous space with a running 5-0 suture (Table of Materials).\nPlace a 5-0 suture (Table of Materials) into the skin and around the chest tube so when the chest tube is removed, the hole will be tied shut.Evacuate the air from the pleural cavity with a 3 mL syringe through the catheter to regain the negative normal pressure in the thorax. Immediately clamp the catheter with a needle holder to prevent air from going back into the thoracic cavity. Quickly remove the catheter and tie the suture to close the hole.\n5. Post-operative Recovery\nPlace the animal in the sternal position. Turn off the isoflurane but continue giving the rat oxygen via endotracheal tube. Do not leave the animal unattended at any point until it has regained sufficient consciousness to ambulate and the animal is safely in its cage.\nAdminister 2\u20133 mL of sterile lactated Ringer\u2019s solution subcutaneously.\nMonitor the heart rate (\u2248200\u2013500 bpm), oxygen saturation (\u226595%), and animal color to confirm the animal is breathing well.\nWhen the animal starts making spontaneous breathing motions and neck movements and responds to physical stimuli (such as eyes widening, nose moving, and ears responding to sound), extubate the animal by pulling out the catheter and disconnect the ventilator.\nReturn the animal to an empty cage, away from the company of other animals. The animal should be alone for at least 3 days.\nFor pain control, administer 0.1 mg/kg of Buprenorphine subcutaneously every 12 h for 3 days.\n6. Administration of \u201cSecond Hit\u201d MCT or Sugen\nAdminister 1 mL of MCT (60 mg/kg) or 1 mL of Sugen (25 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection, 1 week after the surgery.\n7. Terminal Harvest\nSeven weeks after MCT or Sugen administration, place the animal in a\u00a0chamber with flowing oxygen (1 L/min) and 4% isoflurane.\nConnect the animal to the ventilator via nose cone. Keep oxygen flowing and lower the isoflurane to 2.5\u20133%. Lay the animal on his back and tape down all limbs.\nShave the animal along the entire abdomen.Opening the Chest\nMake an incision down the chest\u00a0with a scalpel from the subclavian notch to the xyphoid.\nUse the tissue forceps to hold the xyphoid. Cut through the sternum with the Cooley-Mayo scissors until the heart and pulmonary artery are fully accessible. Use the electrocautery to stop the bleeding. Hold the ribs open with a retractor.\nIdentify the pulmonary artery. Adjust the orientation of the heart, if necessary, by adding gauze underneath. Use a 20 G IV catheter to puncture the pulmonary artery between the pulmonary valve and the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery. Advance only the 20 G catheter into the artery and remove the needle. Advance the 1.2 Fr transonic pressure catheter into IV catheter that is in the pulmonary artery. Once the PA curve is steady, record the pressure for at least 10 s. Repeat these steps to record the pressure in the right ventricle.\nRemove the heart and lungs. Place pieces of the lung in formalin to be fixed in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\nSubscription Required.

Growing of Mixed Glial Cultures\nDecapitate 1- 2 day-old pups quickly with 5.5 inch operating scissors, and place the heads immediately in a 50 mL tube on ice. Note that this decapitation is the mode of euthanasia.\nIn a laminar airflow hood, make a small incision in the skull and meninges using 4.5 inch straight micro-dissecting scissors. Begin cutting from the caudal end to the rostral end (nose). Get underneath the skin by using the opening formed by the decapitation.\nAfter the incision, peel one of the hemispheres to the side. Then use a pair of curved or hooked tweezers to remove the entire brain.\nImmerse the brain(s) in a new 50 mL tube containing 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetate acid (EDTA) for 15 min in a 37 \u00b0C water bath. Use 2 mL of trypsin-EDTA per brain.\nWash the brain(s) with fresh Growth Media (10% FBS, DMEM/F12, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% non-essential amino acids) by adding and removing the media. Repeat this 4x.\nFor each brain, plate two T-75 flasks containing growth media. Therefore, add 2 mL of growth media per brain to the tube. Thus, it will be an equivalent of 1 mL of homogenized brain with 8-9 mL of growth media per T-75 flask.\nHomogenize by triturating the brain(s) with pipettes of differing aperture sizes, in order from largest to smallest. When it is visible that the brain tissue is not getting smaller, transition to the next pipette. At the end of the trituration, the suspension should be clear, with no visible chunks.Use a 25 mL pipette, 5 mL pipette, and then a 10 mL pipette sequentially.\nPass each homogenous brain suspension through a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer to make it into a single cell culture.\nFor each homogenized brain, plate two T-75 flasks containing growth media, as described in step 1.5 (1 mL of homogenized brain with 8-9 mL of growth media per T-75 flask).\nChange growth media after 6 d and grow until isolation on the 16th day.\n2. Isolation of Microglial Cells\nAfter 16 days, remove the growth media from the flask and place it in a fresh 50 mL tube. Add 3 mL 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to each T-75 flask. Shake the flasks for 5 min at RT on an orbital shaker.\nCentrifuge the removed growth media at 0.4 x g for 5 min and use to stop the trypsin-EDTA reaction in the subsequent step.\nAfter shaking for 5 min, add a minimum of 4 mL of growth media (fresh or the used media from 2.1.1) to stop the trypsin-EDTA reaction.\nTriturate to ensure that all the cells have been detached.\nAfter trituration, pass the cells through a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer to make it into a single cell culture, perform a cell count, and then spin down the cells at 0.4 x g for 5 min.\nFor every 100 x 106\u00a0cells (roughly 15 x T-75 flasks), use 1 mL of Recommended Media (2% FBS, DPBS (calcium\u00a0and magnesium chloride-free), 1 mM EDTA) to resuspend the cell pellet.\n\tNOTE: All following steps are tailored for a 1 mL separation.Take a 5 mL polystyrene tube, add 1 mL of Recommended Media, and mark the meniscus. Add Recommended Media up to 2.5 mL and mark this as well.

Additional magnetic incubations may be performed to increase purity.\nAdd 3 mL of growth media and count the number of cells using a cell counter.\nPlate cells accordingly in Poly-D-Lysine (PDL)-coated plates for treatments. Treat the cells 48 h after seeding inPDL-coated plates. This allows the cells to recover from the stress of separation.\n\tNOTE: Check the purity of the culture using immunocytochemistry as described previously15.\nPlate the negative fraction (collected in a 15 mL tube), which mostly contains astrocytes, in T-75 flasks in the growth medium.After at least 6 h of incubation in 37 \u00b0C incubator, change the medium and let it grow O/N.

Harvesting Heart and Aorta\nAnesthetize the mouse and carefully open the chest cavity to reveal the heart and proximal aorta.\n\t\nExtract the blood from the mouse by direct punctuation of the right ventricle of the heart.\n\t\tNote: The blood can be stored and used for the analysis of plasma lipids and other blood borne factors.\nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nRinse the vasculature with 5 ml of saline.\n\tNote: This is accomplished by gravity perfusion through a needle puncture into the left ventricle. To permit drainage, a small incision is made in the right atrium. After rinsing the vasculature, tissue samples of liver, muscle and adipose tissue can be collected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 \u00baC for future analysis.\nThe vasculature is fixed by gravity perfusion into the left ventricle with 10% neutral buffered formalin.\n\tNote: Once the perfusion is started, the flow of 10% neutral buffered formalin is adjusted to a slow drip so that the process takes 1-2 min. Organs and tissues that have been perfusion fixed can be used to the study of protein expression through immunofluorescence or histochemistry, but they generally cannot be used as samples for western blotting or to the study of gene expression.\nCarefully extract the heart and approximately 2 mm of proximal aorta from the carcass. Other tissues including the descending aorta can be collected and stored for subsequent analysis.\n\tNote: The descending aorta (to the iliac bifurcation) can also be used to examine atherosclerosis.\nMake a transversal cut with a scalpel on the removed heart in a manner that is perpendicular to the ascending aorta.Note: This is facilitated by the use of a dissecting microscope and can be effectively done by cutting along a straight line joining the lower tips of the right and left atria (Figure 1).\nStore the apical (top) part of the heart in an embedding cassette and submerge it in neutral buffered formalin for processing.\n2. Preparation of the Aorta\nPlace the cassette with the dissected tissue into the tissue processor.\nProcess tissue samples.\n\tNote: Generally, tissue processors are programmed to work overnight because of the length of the operation and the solutions involved in this process. Samples are processed following an established protocol:\n\t\n10% neutral buffered formalin for 1 hr at 42 \u00baC.\n10% neutral buffered formalin for 1 hr at 42 \u00baC.\n70% ethanol for 30 min at 40 \u00baC.\n85% ethanol for 30 min at 40 \u00baC.\n100% ethanol for 45 min at\u00a040 \u00baC.\n100% ethanol \u00a0for 45 min at 40 \u00baC.\n100% ethanol for 45 min at 40 \u00baC.\nXylene for 1 hr at 40 \u00baC.\nXylene for 1 hr at 40 \u00baC.\nXylene for 1 hr at 40 \u00baC.\nParaffin wax for 45 min at\u00a063 \u00baC.\nParaffin wax for 45 min at 63 \u00baC.\nParaffin wax for 45 min at 63 \u00baC.\nParaffin wax for 45 min\u00a0at 63 \u00baC.\nMelt the paraffin wax overnight at 62 \u00baC (Figures 1D-E). Estimate the total amount of paraffin wax to be used base on the grams of paraffin wax needed to fill a histology mold and the number of blocks to be prepared.\n\tNote: A deep histology mold is preferred to shallow mold because it provides a wider potential angle of rotation when sectioning. A single deep histology mold requires 11 g of paraffin wax.Place each processed tissue into a deep histology mold and then pour melted paraffin wax to completely fill the mold (Figure 1F). Cover the mold with a labeled plastic cassette (Figure 1G).\nCool the filled mold on ice, or on a cold surface (Figure 1H), in order to create the solid block and separate the block from the mold (Figures 1I-J).\n\tNote: When placing the dissected heart in the mold, ensure that the inner face of the heart is touching the base of the mold, and then proceed to fill the block with melted paraffin. A labeled plastic cassette covers the mold before it solidifies in order to provide a base to handle the block. Once cooled, the mold is removed and the paraffin blocks can be stored indefinitely at room temperature.\n3. Sectioning of the Aorta\nPosition the block with the heart in the specimen holder of the microtome so that it can be sectioned from the inside toward the top of the heart (Figure 2)\nAdjust the microtome to cut a section thickness of 10 \u00b5m and proceed to section the heart.\nCollect sections on a glass slide and examine under a light microscope to determine position and orientation.\nWhen 1 or 2 valves of the aortic sinus become evident adjust the angle of the block as necessary (Figure 3A).\n\tNote: The sinus should appear as three bipartite valve bases with attached leaflets. If only one or two valve leaflets are observed then the cutting angle should be adjusted accordingly.\nAdjust the microtome to cut at 4-5 \u00b5m and collect the sections on coated glass slides.Note: Although the procedure can be varied, a systematic approach is recommended, by which the first 10 sections, from the aortic sinus advancing up the ascending aorta, are collected onto the top portion of a labeled glass slides (slides labeled 1-10). Subsequent sections are collected following the same pattern: #11-20, #21-30, #31-40 until the atherosclerotic lesions are no longer observed (Figure 3B). In this way the atherosclerotic lesions can be examined and characterized at precise locations along the ascending aorta. For example, Slide 1 holds sections 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, and 51, representing atherosclerotic lesions from the aortic sinus up the ascending aorta. Additional slides, labeled 11-20, can be included if the lesion is large, to collect more distal sections following the same pattern.\nContinue to collect sections until no atherosclerotic lesion is observed.\n\tNote: Slides can be stored at room temperature for months, before further analysis.\n4. Staining and Quantification of Atherosclerotic Lesions\nAtherosclerotic lesions can be analyzed in many different ways using a variety of techniques. The most basic analysis involves determination of lesion cross sectional area. In order to accurately compared lesion area, it is important that the starting point for lesion measurement is consistent from sample to sample. This is facilitated by using the valve leaflets for orientation. To facilitate the accurate identification and quantification of the lesion area, select cross sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin. This involves immersing the slides in a series of solutions for specified times, that will deparaffinize/stain the tissue.\nProtocol for hematoxylin and eosin staining:\nPut the slides in the air drier for 8 min then deparaffinize the sections by washing 4\u00d7 in xylene, for 3 min per wash.\nWash slides in 100% ethanol 3\u00d7 for 3 min each.Wash 3\u00d7 in 70% ethanol for 3 min each and then 2\u00d7 in 50% ethanol for 3 min each.\nRinse with distilled water and then immerse in Mayer\u2019s Hematoxylin for 15 min.\nWash in running tap water for 5 min then wash in distilled water for 5 min.\nImmerse in Eosin Y for 1-5 min.\nWash in distilled water 3\u00d7 for 5 min each, wash in 50% ethanol 2\u00d7 for 2 min each, then 70% ethanol 3\u00d7 for 2 min each.\nWash in 100% ethanol 3\u00d7 for 2 min each then wash in xylene 4\u00d7 for 2 min each.\nMount sections using xylene based mounting medium and capture images using a digital camera mounted on a light microscope.\nIdentify and quantify lesion area using imaging software.\n\tNote: The lesion area can be determined at specific distances from the aortic sinus at 40-50 \u03bcm intervals (depending upon the thickness of each section). A plot of these area measurements versus distance gives a profile of the atherosclerotic lesion (Figure 4). The area under the curve represents an estimate of the total volume of the atherosclerotic lesion. Additional characterization of the lesion can include the determination of necrotic area. The necrotic core (nc) of an advanced lesion is formed by apoptotic foam cells. With practice, this can be determined by examination of the acellular regions of the hematoxylin and eosin stained sections (Figure 4A). Early lesions tend to have very little necrosis while more advanced lesions have increased necrotic areas that may contribute to plaque instability. Serial sections of the same aorta should be examined to confirm the presence of a necrotic region.\n5. Further Characterization of the Atherosclerotic LesionSpecific details regarding the stage of atherosclerotic development can be determined by staining with antibodies directed against specific cell types or markers. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections is a standard technique that is used to identify specific cell types or markers within the context of the surrounding unstained tissue. Antigen detection is generally achieved using a horseradish peroxidase substrate.\nImmunofluorescence staining involves the use of fluorophore-conjugated antibodies and requires a fluorescence microscope and appropriate filters for detection. This technique permits simultaneous staining of two (or more) antigens.\nGeneral Protocol for Immunohistochemical staining:\nPlace slides in the air drier for 8 min.\nDeparaffinize sections in 4 changes of xylene, 3 min\u00a0each.\nWash in 100% ethanol 3\u00d7 for 3 min each to remove xylene.\nWash 3\u00d7 in 70% ethanol for 3 min each, then 2\u00d7 in 50% ethanol for 3 min each.\nWash in distilled water 5 min each then wash 3\u00d7 in PBS for 5 min each.\nPerform antigen retrieval. This can be accomplished using the Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) method in a microwave pressure cooker and antigen retrieval solution (10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0).\n\tNote: The process of formalin fixation may mask the antigens of interest. In our experience, the HIER significantly improves the performance of some antibodies, but is not required for others. In addition, there are other available alternatives to the HIER method of antigen retrieval.\nWhen the pressure cooker has cooled, place slides in PBS for 15 min.\nIncubate sections in normal serum (from the same species that the secondary antibody was derived from) for 30 min.\u00a0DO NOT WASH SLIDES - DRAIN SERUM OFF.\nIncubate with primary antibody diluted in normal blocking serum for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\nWash with PBS 3\u00d7 for 5 min each.Incubate sections with the biotinylated secondary antibody which has been diluted in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature.\nIncubate slides with horseradish peroxidase streptavidin for 30 min then wash with PBS 3\u00d7 for 5 min each.\nChromogenic reaction- incubate slides in fresh DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) for 5-30 min. This reaction should be monitored using a microscope. Stop the reaction by washing slides in tap water.\nCounter stain with hematoxylin for 1 min.

Human PSC should be seeded at least 48 hr before starting the experiment. Pulse labeling is performed sequentially with two thymidine analogs\u2014chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) and iododeoxyuridine (IdU)\u2014for 20 min each (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]). DNA labeling exploits the ability of in vitro\u2212cultured cells to incorporate nucleotide analogs into newly replicating DNA strands. To ensure consistent and robust labeling, the cells should be at \u223c50% confluency at the start of the experiment: this will ensure the cells are still in the growth phase and replication is not suppressed. Further, the labeling time should be strictly monitored. A deviation in timing will introduce inaccuracy and confound experimental results. Once labeled, the cells should be dissociated into single cells using TrypLE, to minimize stress and allow for accurate cell counting. Dissociated cells should be kept on ice to inhibit further enzymatic activity before spreading (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0002]).\nThis protocol should produce a homogenous single-cell suspension of pulse-labeled cells in ice-cold PBS for DNA spreading (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0002]).\nMaterials\n1\u00d7 PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0003])\nHuman PSC culture medium: mTeSR 1 (STEMCELL Technologies, 85850), E8 (in house; Chen et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-bib-0007]), or Nutristem XF (Biological Industries, 05-100-1A)\nRho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 inhibitor (Y-27632; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0009])\nOne T-12.5 flask of human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells\nTrypLE Express single-cell dissociation solution (Life Technologies, 12604-021)\n2.5 mM 5-chloro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (CldU) stock solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0005])\n2.5 mM 5-iodo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (IdU stock solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0005])\nIce cold 1\u00d7 Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0003])\nVitronectin-coated 6-well plate (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0011])\n15-ml conical centrifuge tubes (Falcon or equivalent)\nCell counter\nCentrifuge\nSeed human PSC for DNA labeling1.

Following DNA labeling (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0001]), a small droplet of cell suspension is lysed on a glass slide (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]) and then tilted to allow spreading. The droplet of cell lysate solution generates cohesive tension with the slide as it runs its length, stretching the DNA into fibers that can be later stained and visualized by immunofluorescence (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0003] and Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0004]).\nThe major factor requiring optimization in this protocol is the type of glass slide used. Before initiating this protocol, different brands and batches of slides should be tested to ensure the droplet runs slowly down the length of the glass slide when tilted at 25\u00b0-40\u00b0. If this protocol is conducted properly, a droplet of cell lysate solution should run the length of a glass slide in 3 to 5 min. Once dried, the path of the droplet should leave behind a cloudy precipitate. Depending on the temperature and humidity, it may be necessary to alter the volume of the spreading buffer or the angle at which the slide is tilted to ensure that the droplet runs at a slow, constant rate.\nMaterials\nCell suspension (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0001])\nSpreading buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0010])\nMethanol/acetic acid fixative (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0006])\nSuper premium microscope slides (BDH Laboratory Supplies)\nOther slides are also suitable, although each batch should be tested to optimize spreading.\nThe lid of a multi-well plate (or something similar) to hold the tilted slides in place\nCell lysis\n1. Working with one sample at a time, pipette 2 \u03bcl of ice-cold cell suspension at the top of each of 3-5 microscope slides, depending on the number of replicates to be performed (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).Be sure that the droplet does not touch the frosted end of the slide, as this will inhibit its ability to spread. It is a good idea to mark with pencil the position of the cell suspension, to aid in finding the fibers on the microscope.\n2. Allow to dry for 5-7 min.\nThis step will require optimization. Look for the edges of the droplet beginning to dry and for the droplet to become tacky. The time that this takes may vary depending on room temperature and humidity. However, do not allow the droplet to completely dry.\n3. Add \u223c7 \u03bcl of spreading buffer and stir with a pipette tip (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\nTo ensure that the droplet spreads down the slide slowly (step 5 to 6), the volume of spreading buffer may need to be adjusted.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Stir with the pipette tip; do NOT pipette up and down.\n4. Incubate for 2 min.\nSpreading\n5. Tilt each slide at an angle of 25\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 and hold in place on the lid of a multi-well plate.\n6. Let the droplet run down the slide slowly and at a constant speed. The droplet should reach the bottom edge after 3 to 5 min (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\nIt is important to ensure that the droplet spreads slowly and at a constant speed, so that the fibers do not clump and become uncountable during the analysis steps.\n7. Lay the slides flat and allow to air dry completely (approximately 15 min).\n8. Go back to step 1 and prepare the next sample.\nFixation\n9. Using a 1-ml pipette, gently add 1 ml methanol/acetic acid fixative to the bottom right-hand corner of the slide and allow it to spread over the entirety of the slide (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\n10. Incubate for 10 min.11. Tilt the slide to allow the excess fixative to run off, and allow to air dry completely.\nAt this point, the slides can be stored at 4\u00b0C overnight.This protocol describes the immunolabeling of DNA fibers spread onto glass slides. The protocol begins with an acid treatment to denature the DNA fibers before blocking for unspecific binding and labeling the CldU and IdU labeled fibers with rat and mouse anti-BrdU primary antibodies, respectively. Detection of the labeled DNA fibers is possible by immunostaining with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\nFollowing this immunostaining protocol, it will be possible to detect the labeled DNA fibers by confocal microscopy. The labeled DNA should be detectable as bi-labeled fibers in the 555 and 488 Alexa Fluor visible spectrum.

Make a fresh solution of secondary antibodies by mixing Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rat IgG (1:500) and Alexa Fluor 488 F (ab\u2032)2 goat anti\u2212mouse IgG (1:500) in blocking solution.\nAntibodies should be titered, as the optimal concentration will depend on the source and nature of the antibody.\n16. Using a 1-ml pipette, gently add 750 \u03bcl of the secondary antibody mix to the bottom right-hand corner of the slide, and allow it to spread over the entirety of the slide (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\nAs before, this step should be performed on a damp paper towel covered with a plastic lid. Alternatively, a slide staining tray can be used (e.g., Sigma, Z670146).\n17. Incubate for 2 hr in the dark at room temperature\n18. Rinse twice with 1\u00d7 PBS in a staining trough.\n19. Wash three times with blocking solution in a Coplin jar.\n20. Rinse twice with 1\u00d7 PBS in a staining trough.\n21. Using Fluoroshield, mount a coverslip onto the glass slide and allow to dry for 30 min in the dark.\nTo avoid bubbles while mounting the coverslip, place one end of the coverslip flush with the slide and slowly lower the other end. Store the slides at \u221220\u00b0C for up to 6 months.In support of the basic protocols above, we provide microscopy parameters and data-acquisition instructions to facilitate accurate data analysis (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0005]). It is important to take pictures of fibers from across the entire slide where fibers do not overlap, in order to ensure that robust measurements will be obtained. In total, 150-200 fibers should be acquired per experimental condition to enable reliable estimation of replication parameters. Three or more independent repeats should be performed.\nMicroscopy parameters\nThe parameters in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-tbl-0001] have provided robust measurements when using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope.\nTable 1.\n                Microscopy Parameters\ntable:\n\ufeffParameter,Setting,Description/notes\nObjective,\u00d763,Oil-immersion lens\nChannel (CldU),568,Detection of CldU-labeled Alexa Fluor 555 label\nChannel (IdU),488,Detection of IdU-labeled Alexa Fluor 488 label\nZoom,1,Increasing the zoom will limit the number of fibers per field and could confound measurements (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0005])\nScan format,1080 \u00d7 1080,Number of pixels in the field\nScan speed,\u223c8 \u03bcs,This can be optimized to produce the best image quality while minimizing photobleaching\nFile export,TIFF,Contains metadata of scaleThis protocol will describe the data analysis and replication-event characterization that can be achieved from DNA fiber assays as described above. In particular, we will describe how to measure DNA fiber length, replication fork speed, fork symmetry, and inter-replication origin distance, and how to detect and quantify different replication events.\nIn each case, a total of 150-200 fibers should be analyzed per condition for a reliable estimation of fiber length, and to account for the range of fiber lengths that can be attributed to the varied dynamics of replication forks. Only clear fibers that do not overlap should be included (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0002]). It is also important to image fibers from across the entire slide to ensure robust measurement of replication fork dynamics. Data should be plotted as scatter dot plots, or in box-and-whiskers plots. Statistical significance between two groups is normally assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test (unpaired and nonparametric).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f91a62aa-ac91-4364-826e-68b0193a83eb/cpsc115-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nRepresentative image showing a single field of DNA fibers. The image was taken using the described microscopy parameters (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0004] and Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-tbl-0001]). The fibers within the field show minimal overlap and can be easily measured. Analysis of fields with a high density of DNA fibers can confound measurements, as they are likely to overlap, hindering their measurement from end-to-end. The DNA fibers pictured were labeled sequentially with CldU and IdU for 20 min each. Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm.\nMaterials\nTIFF images from Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0004]\nImageJ software (Schneider, Rasband, & Eliceiri, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-bib-0024])\nDetermining DNA fiber length (\u03bcm)\nThe following steps are for determining total length covered by the replication fork within the 40-min pulse labelings.\n1.

Representative images of DNA replication events with the directionality of the CldU and IdU labeling presented. A description of the replication event is shown, and where relevant the formula required in the calculation of the specified replication dynamic is shown. (A) Ongoing replication fork. Analysis of these forks can be used to determine the fiber length and replication fork speed using the formulae shown. (B) Example of a bi-directional replication fork. Analysis of these fibers allows for the quantification of fork symmetry; loss of symmetry indicates that replication fork stalling has occurred. (C) Double replication origins allow for the distance between replication initiation sites to be measured. Inter-origin distance is a measure of the density of origin firing, which is often a symptom of replication stress in response to oncogene activation. (D) A representative image of replication fork termination. Two forks travelling in opposite directions, which meet and terminate fork progression. (E) The image shows the firing of a replication fork from a new origin of replication, which has occurred during the second pulse labeling with IdU. The presence of IdU-only tracts is a sign of origin firing, as the fork was not progressing during the period of the first labeling. (F) CldU-only labeled fibers indicate the stalling or collapse of replication forks prior to the addition of the second, IdU label. Quantification of CldU-only fibers, relative to the total number of fibers, can be used to indicate replication stress, and may be a prerequisite to genome instability. (G) Hydroxyurea arrests DNA replication in human PSC. The image shows the severely slowed or stalled progression of replication forks of hydroxyurea-treated human PSC. Scale bars = 10 \u03bcm.\nDetermining replication fork speed of a progressing forkThe following steps are for determining the average speed of the replication fork over the two sequential 20-min pulse labelings.\n5. Perform steps 1-3.\n6. Find the average length of each of CldU and IdU.\n7. Divide by the pulse length (20 min).\n8. To convert from \u03bcm/min to kb/min, a commonly used conversion factor of 2.59 kb per \u03bcm (Jackson & Pombo, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-bib-0015]; Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0003]) can be applied.\nFork symmetry\nThe following steps are for analysis of the synchronized progression of sister forks emanating from a single origin. Fork asymmetry suggests replication-fork stalling events. This analysis is performed on fibers that have contiguous IdU-CldU-IdU (green-red-green) signals.\n9. Perform steps 1-2.\n10. Measure the length of the two IdU (green) tracts emanating from a single CldU (red) origin (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0003]).\n11. Calculate the ratio between the two green tracts.\nInter-origin distance\nThe following steps are for determining distance between origins in two consecutive DNA tracts. Care should be taken when measuring the inter-origin distance using the DNA spreading technique, selecting only consecutive DNA tracts that are certain to be on the same DNA fiber. Ideally, DNA should be counterstained with a fluorescent dye, such as YOYO-1.\n12. Perform step 1-2.\n13. Measure the distance between two CldU (red) tracts of two consecutive and contiguous IdU-CldU-IdU (green-red-green) fibers (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0003]).\nReplication events\nThe frequency of replication events, detailed in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0003], can be quantified and normalized to the total number of fibers present.

This section describes steps in marker dataset preparation and assigning cell type identity to clusters.Dataset preparation. Marker dataset compilation will depend on the type of single cell data you are processing. Here, we composed an in-house database consisting of canonical markers for cell types associated to human lung region using a combination of literature search (Deprez et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Grant et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Madissoon et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Reyfman et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), PanglaoDB (Franzen et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), and CellMarker (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) databases. Deprez et\u00a0al. provided the single cell map for human healthy airway, constituted by 77,969 cells from 35 different locations, which were clustered into seventeen broad cell types. We extracted the unique markers from the heat map representing the marker gene expression across various cell types. Furthermore, we collected the marker genes from lung single cell map (Madissoon et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) consisting of 57,020 cells, classified into 25 different cell types. Similarly, we enlisted the lung specific markers from other largescale datasets, which characterized single cell heterogeneity of lung tissues. The steps for compiling marker genes are shown in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. In order to download the marker gene files from PanglaoDB and CellMarker database, first install curl on your PC through terminal window executing the following codes.\n#install curl\nsudo apt install curl\n#check if curl is installed\ncurl --version\nNext, open either R-studio or R-terminal and execute the following code which will:\nDownload the data from PanglaoDB and CellMarker database (You can either download the file or use the file we have deposited in Zenodo).\nSelect human, lung data which have sensitivity above 0.5 and keep the genes associated with each cell type in a new list.Identify only unique list of genes for each cell type and combine all the cell types (collected from literature as well as databases - Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) to generate the final database. In our study, we compiled 966 unique marker genes representing 38 cell types (Nassir et\u00a0al., 2021b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nlibrary(curl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n#PanglaoDB\nurl <-\n\"https://panglaodb.se/markers/PanglaoDB_markers_27_Mar_2020.tsv.gz\"\ndest<- \"/Users/ Desktop/STAR_protocol-\n_review_comments/new/PanglaoDB_markers_27_Mar_2020.tsv.gz\"\ncurl_download(url,dest)\n#tsv=gzfile(\"PanglaoDB_markers_27_Mar_2020.tsv.gz\")\n#or\ntsv=(\"PanglaoDB_markers_27_Mar_2020.tsv\")\npdb<- read.csv(tsv,header=T,sep\u00a0= \"\\t\")\npdb_filtered<-filter(pdb, species\u00a0== \"Hs\" | species\u00a0== \"Mm Hs\")\npdb_filtered<-filter(pdb_filtered,organ==\"Lungs\")\npdb_filtered<-filter(pdb_filtered,sensitivity_human>=0.5)\npdb1\u00a0<- split(as.character(pdb_filtered$official.gene.symbol), pdb_filtered$cell.type)\nView(pdb1)\n#Cellmarker\nurl2<-\n\"http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/CellMarker/download/Human_cell_markers.txt\"\ndest2<- \"/Users/ Desktop/STAR_protocol-\n_review_comments/new/Human_cell_markers.txt\"\ncurl_download(url2,dest2)\ncmdb<- read.csv(\"Human_cell_markers.txt\", header=T, sep=\"\\t\")\ncmdb_filtered<-filter(cmdb,cancerType==\"Normal\")\ncmdb_filtered<-filter(cmdb_filtered,tissueType==\"Lung\")\ncmdb1<-split(as.character(cmdb_filtered$geneSymbol),cmdb_filtered$cellName)\nView(cmdb1)\n# cmdb1[[\"T-cell\"]]<-c(\"CD3D\", \"CD3E\", \"CD3G\", \"CD4\", \"CD8A\",\"CD4\",\n\"CD68\", \"CD8A\")\nlis<-names(pdb1)\nlis2<-names(cmdb1)\n#making list of all cell types\nnam_all_cell<-unique(unlist(c(lis,lis2)))\n#compare cell type names\n#merge\n#Compare genes within- keep only unique\nfor(j in 1:length(nam_all_cell)){\n\u00a0\u00a0d=e=g=h=c()\n\u00a0\u00a0if(j==8)\n\u00a0\u00a0{\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0g<-grep(\"Brush cell\",lis2) #Brush cell labeled as Brush cell (Tuft\ncell) \u2013it gives error using Grep\n\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0\u00a0else if(j==18){\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0g<-grep(\"FOXN4\",lis2) #FOXN4 labeled as FOXN4\u00a0+) \u2013it gives error\nusing Grep due to \u2018+\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0\u00a0else{\n\u00a0\u00a0g<-grep(nam_all_cell[j],lis2)\n\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0\u00a0d<-length(g)\n\u00a0\u00a0h<-grep(nam_all_cell[j],lis)\n\u00a0\u00a0e<-length(h)\nif((d>0)&(e>0)){\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0x<-unique(unlist(pdb1[h]))\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0y<-unique(unlist(cmdb1[g]))\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ip<- unique(unlist(c(x,y)))\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0nam_ip<-names(cmdb1[g])\n\u00a0\u00a0}else if(d>0){\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ip<-unique(unlist(cmdb1[g]))\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0nam_ip<-names(cmdb1[g])\n\u00a0\u00a0}else if(e>0){\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ip<-unique(unlist(pdb1[h]))\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0nam_ip<-names(pdb1[h])\n\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0\u00a0DF<-as.data.frame(ip,col.names=nam_ip,row.names=NULL)\n\u00a0\u00a0DF<-t(DF)\n\u00a0\u00a0row.names(DF)<-nam_ip\n\u00a0\u00a0write.table(DF,file=\"cell_Type.csv\",row.names\u00a0=\nTRUE,col.names=FALSE, append=TRUE, sep=\",\")\n\u00a0\u00a0print(DF)\n\u00a0\u00a0}\nIf you are using R-studio, copy and paste the above code in the new R-Script.

Only going through the databases will hardly take few minutes to hours. It is the literature search which is time consuming, due to the exponential rate at which single cell analysis is being performed on different human tissues.\nCell type assignment Subsequently, use the marker dataset to find the cluster identity (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) employing these steps:\nExtract and plot (boxplot) the normalized expression for all the genes belonging to a specific cell type across all the clusters for the given dataset.

Since COVID-19 disease pathology is associated with enormous release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we included the list of cytokines and cytokine receptor genes, in addition to the rare infection and syndromic genes accounting for the genetic predisposition, lung channelopathy genes, differentially expressed genes from COVID-19\u2019s BALF transcriptome (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) and genes associated with key comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes. The list of cytokine and cytokine-receptor genes was retrieved from the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (Bhattacharya et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The monogenic infection gene list was collected from (Casanova, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Syndromic genes (category S) were collected from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative\u00a0(https://gene.sfari.org/[href=https://gene.sfari.org/]). Primary comorbid disease genes associated with COVID-19 were extracted from GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/[href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/]), where the selected genes had a probability\u00a0<\u00a010-7. The normalized expression of these gene sets was plotted for all the clusters of control, moderate and severe datasets. Refer the script at Github data: https://github.com/MBRULab/2021_Nassir-etal/blob/main/comorbidexpression.R[href=https://github.com/MBRULab/2021_Nassir-etal/blob/main/comorbidexpression.R].

This section describes identifying genes restricted to cell type of interest. Using step 3, we identified a severe cluster which has maximum enrichment of the comorbid genes, severe cluster 11, which was assigned the identity as monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (MoAM), indicated by the presence of CCL3L1 - MoAM_CCL3L1. One of the most important steps next is to identify the marker genes that are restrictively expressed in this cluster. Please follow the steps below.\nUse FindAllMarkers to compute the DEGs for each cluster using different tests - Wilcoxon-ranked sum test, t-test.\n>FindAllMarkers(seu_object, test.use= \u201cwilkox\u201d)\nSelect the genes which are differentially expressed (highest probability, combining all the three tests).\nRank the genes using their Log of fold change in descending order.\nUse top 20 genes and map them using feature plot and dot plot. Analyze the expression pattern and select the genes which are upregulated in severe cluster and have negligible expression in all other clusters in the dataset. Using this approach, we identified the most differentially regulated gene that demarcated cluster 11 in samples from severe COVID-19 patients, FCGR3B (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPathway enrichment.\nThis section describes pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes and visualization of pathways using Cytoscape tool.We used the DEGs from severe cluster 11 for enrichment analysis and mapping. For enrichment analysis, please follow the script at Github data: https://github.com/MBRULab/2021_Nassir-etal/blob/main/geneoverlap.R[href=https://github.com/MBRULab/2021_Nassir-etal/blob/main/geneoverlap.R]. This script takes the list of genes from severe cluster 11 as input and scans the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO (Gene Ontology) databases to identify the overlapping pathways. The input file required (KEGG and GO file and gene list file) are deposited in Zenodo. Here, the intersection of your set of genes over KEGG and GO pathway genes is computed. This script generates a csv file with the following information: pathway id, pathway name, pvalue and Odds ratio. This file is used as the input to Cytoscape where two main plugins are used: \u2018Enrichment map\u2019 and \u2018Autoannotate\u2019. Cytoscape is an open-source network visualization software which can be downloaded from https://cytoscape.org/download.html[href=https://cytoscape.org/download.html]. Further, \u2018App Manager\u2019 present in the \u2018APPS\u2019 tab within the Cytoscape can be used to add these plugins (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Then, use the Enrichment map and input the above-mentioned files using \u2018Generic/gprofiler\u2019 type of analysis. Set the FDR cut off (<0.01) OR p value cut off (<0.001) (after clicking the advanced icon). After building the map, use the auto annotate plugin and refine the network map.\nCritical: This script restricts the pathway to size 50 to 1,000 genes (which means only pathways having more than 50 and less than 1,000 genes are included \u2013 to account for housekeeping genes), that can be modified on line 17 of the script.\nCritical: We consider a pathway intersection\u00a0>\u00a05 as positive match. It means that pathway will be considered only if more than 5 genes are included in it. This can be relaxed (by reducing the number) on line 26 of the script.\nIn silico validation.This section describes validation of findings using other single cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets.\nOnce the cell type and specific marker gene has been identified, you will need to validate your findings, for which you need to decide and download required validation data sets. We used single cell BALF, bulk PBMC and bulk nasopharyngeal datasets for validation. This step involved comparing the expression pattern of FCGR3B in control and patient data and then calculating the significance using t-test p-values. The validation script deposited at Github data: https://github.com/MBRULab/2021_Nassir-etal[href=https://github.com/MBRULab/2021_Nassir-etal] (validation_BALF_SC.R, validation_nasph.R, validation_pbmc.R) can be directly used for this purpose.

Steps to perform Cytoscape analysis\nFlowchart representing pathway network creation using Enrichment Map and Autoannotate tool. The tab selections are highlighted in red.", "The protocol and video publication were approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital Jena. The patient gave his agreement for his anonymized data to be published for article purposes.\n1. Physiological monitoring\nAfter bringing the patient to the operating table, establish a peripheral venous access line and connect to 500 cc of NaCl. Fix the arms and legs of the patient.\nInitiate the ECG, peripheral oxygen saturation, and pulse measurements. Perform sterilization of the right groin using an iodine based solution (e.g., Betadine solution).\n2. Preparation of the sterile equipments\nPrepare sterile equipment with the materials required by the catheter assistant/nurse. Cover the sterilized femoral access site with a transparent foil plaster.\n3. Venous puncture, catheter introduction, and invasive arterial pressure measurement\nPrepare ultrasonic guidance under sterile conditions.\nProvide subcutaneous anesthesia with 10-20 mL of Lidocaine subcutaneously above the venous puncture of the groin. Then, access the right femoral vein through palpation, fluoroscopic and/or ultrasound guidance. Introduce a standard wire with a J-tip and a 5 F multipurpose catheter into the superior vena cava.\nPerform an arterial puncture of the femoral artery, and introduce a 4F sheath for pressure monitoring. Many interventional cardiologists may find non-invasive blood pressure monitoring reliable in stable patients. Once the arterial blood pressure measurement is established, start the conscious sedation of the patient.\nStart the conscious sedation with midazolam (3-5 mg as a bolus) and propofol (1% bolus of 0.05-0.01 mL/kg body weight, followed by approximately 0.25 mL/kg/h).\nMeasure the pressure in the right atrium. The central venous pressure (CVP) should be in a normal range around 6-12 mmHg. If the mean CVP is below 6 mmHg, give an NaCl infusion until a CVP of 6 mmHg minimum is reached to avoid air embolism during the procedure.4. Local oropharyngeal anesthesia and introduction of the TEE probe\nBefore the start of conscious sedation, apply a local anesthesia, xylocaine pump spray (10 mg/puff), to the oropharyngeal region 5-10 times.\nApply bite protection.\n\tNOTE: The echo imager should apply a xylocaine gel to the TEE probe. Introduce the probe carefully into the patient's mouth after the application of the sedation agent. Alternatively, a micro probe can also be introduced via the patient's nose.\nFurther, assess possible pre-existing pericardial effusion in a four-chamber view, and set the bicaval view to include the PFO.\n5. Wire passage through the PFO\nAdvance a J-tip standard wire and the multipurpose (MP) catheter into the left atrium (LA) by slightly pushing forward the wire, and place it in the left upper pulmonary vein under fluoroscopy and TEE guidance. Obtain optimal TEE imaging by sweeping from 30\u00b0 to 110\u00b0. Angiographically, the anterior-posterior projection is mostly used. Obtain a 45\u00b0 left anterior oblique (LAO) view, as this may be helpful.\n6. Heparin application and measurement of the left atrial pressure (LAP)\nOnce the catheter had been introduced into the left atrium, administer a bolus injection of 100 IU heparin/kg body weight to reach an activated clotting time (ACT) of around 250 s. The ACT should be controlled after around 5 min by a point-of-care ACT analyzer, which is used as standard in most catheterization labs.\nMeasure the left atrial pressure (LAP) via the multipurpose catheter. If it is below 5 mmHg, administer IV fluid to reach a mean LAP of 5-10 mmHg.\n\t\u200bNOTE: The risk of breathing-associated air embolism through the catheter is high when the pressure is below 5 mmHg. The measurement of the oxygen saturation with a blood gas test is optional.\n7. Advancing into the LAAdvance a stiff and long guide wire with a soft tip (e.g., Amplatz Super Stiff, length of 260 cm) along the catheter into the LA, targeting the upper pulmonary vein.\n8. TEE-guided balloon sizing of the PFO\nNOTE: Although balloon sizing is discussed critically by some experts, it is recommended to use a sizing balloon to determine the size of the PFO according to the instructions for use.\nExchange the MP catheter for a 24 mm sizing balloon.\nPosition the balloon across the PFO, and inflate it with a 0.9% NaCl/contrast agent solution (1:4). Use two perpendicular TEE projections (e.g., 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0) for the PFO measurement.\nConfirm the dimensions by angiography images. In both, the measurement of the smallest balloon tail is crucial.\n9. Occluder selection\nUse a sizing chart to select the size and type of the PFO occluder device using the PFO size and total septum length assessed by TEE or TTE according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n10. Introduction of the device delivery system\nPrepare an adequately sized closure device according to the instructions for use, and flush properly to eliminate air bubbles.\nDeflate the sizing balloon, and exchange it for the delivery sheath (e.g., Mullins sheath).\nIntroduce the delivery sheath into the LA via the stiff guide wire (7 Fr to 10 Fr depending on the device size). After the aspiration of blood, ensure a wet-to-wet connection between the sheath and the delivery system to guarantee air bubble-free advancement of the device.\n11. Deployment of the PFO occluder\nIntroduce the device through the sheath via a wet to wet connection.Once the device is visible within the sheath, observe if thee is no air bubble in front of the device (maybe cine imaging), then pull the device back approximately 2 cm to confirm the attachment of the device to the delivery cable.\nPush the device forward into the LA, and carefully retract the sheath into the mid-left atrium (push and pull movement) under echocardiographic guidance, which allows the left-sided disc to unfold. Here, TEE guidance instead of angiography is sufficient and recommended to reduce the radiation dose.\nWithdraw the left-sided disc toward the interatrial septum until a subtle resistance is felt and the left-sided disc is seen on the septum by TEE.\nUnder discrete tension, pull the sheath further back into the right atrium (RA), which leads to the expansion of the right-sided disc.\nPush the device gently against the interatrial septum until the discs attach.\n12. Evaluation of the correct device position\nAssess the correct position of the device with TEE and angiography. With the latter, the so-called \"pacman sign\" indicates correct device placement.\nInspect the edges of the device thoroughly for any misalignments with respect to the aorta or the roof of the LA, which may lead to localized compression damage. A push-pull \"tug test\" can help to show the stability of the device.\u00a0Beside the correct position of the device, the absence of gaps (color doppler) and pericardial effusion should be documented.\u00a0Furthermore surrounded structures like the Eustachian valve, the rete chiari etc. should not be interferred with by the device.\u00a0\nOnce the position of the device is found to be correct, disconnect the delivery cable, and remove the sheath.\nStop the concious sedation medication and remove the Echo probe.\u00a0\n13.

Construction of the Cry1 Fluorescence Reporter\nNote: Previous circadian studies using the bioluminescence system2,12,13 fuse a circadian promoter with a destabilized luciferase (dLuc) to induce rhythmic dLuc expression. To develop a fluorescence reporter, destabilized luciferase was replaced with destabilized fluorescence protein (dVenus) to induce rhythmic dVenus expression. The generation of the P(Cry1)-dVenus reporter is described below, the construct of which is currently being submitted to Addgene and will be available soon for academic use.\nAmplify the functional mouse Cry1 promoter (+328 to -1208 bp region of the Cry1 gene, transcription start site designated as \u2018\u2018-1\u2019\u2019).

Incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.\nRemove cellular debris by centrifuging at 3000 x g for 15 min. Further ensure that all debris has been removed by pushing the mixture through a 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filter; this step will help prevent blocking of heparin columns.Set up the heparin columns using a peristaltic pump; set the flow rate to 1 mL/min, ensuring that no air bubbles are introduced into the columns.\nEquilibrate the columns with 10 mL of a 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0. Add the solution containing the virus to each column. Wash the columns with 20 mL of a 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris solution, pH 8.0.

Centrifuge each 4-mL sample at 2000 x g for 5 min at room temperature, discarding the flow-through.\nWhen all extracted materials have been run through the centrifugal filter units, add 4 mL of PBS and centrifuge the mixture into approximately 250 \u03bcL. Remove rAAVs (viral titer should be about 2 - 8 x 1012 viral particles per mL) from the centrifugal filter units, aliquot and store at -80 \u00b0C until use. At this stage, the virus can be stored for several months.\n3. rAAV Injection and Optic Fiber Insertion into the Adult Mouse SCN\nInjection of circadian fluorescence reporter-carrying rAAVs into the SCNLoad 5 \u00b5L of rAAV (the virus titer is about 2 - 8 x 1012 virus particles per mL) into a micro-syringe.\nAnesthetize an adult mouse (2- to 5-month-old, C57BL/6 background) with Nembutal (80 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Check for sufficient depth of anesthesia by the lack of a toe-pinch response.\nUse scissors to remove fur from the head of the mouse and then mount the mouse into a stereotaxic apparatus. Provide a heat source to anesthetized animals via a circulating hot water blanket or another heating device.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, use depilatory cream or electric hair clippers to remove the fur.\nClean the surgical site with the appropriate disinfecting agents. For example, this could include sterile water or alcohol and iodine, betadine,\u00a0or dilute chlorhexidine in alternating scrubs. Repeat at least 3 times.\u00a0Drape the surgical site.\n\u00a0Use the scissors to make an incision in the scalp and expose the skull.\nAdjust the stereotaxic apparatus so that bregma and lambda are in the same horizontal plane; make two symmetrical points of bregma in the same horizontal plane.\nUse a sterile cotton swab soaked in 4% H2O2/H2O to corrode the brain periosteum. Then use a clean, sterile cotton swab to clear and dry the surface of the skull.\nUsing a micro drill, make a hole about 1 mm in diameter 0.46 mm posterior and 0.25 mm lateral to bregma.\nfiUse a clean cotton sterile swab with physiological saline solution to clear bone fragments from the exposed surface of the brain.\nInsert a micro-syringe into the brain, ensuring that the tip of the micro-syringe is 0.46 mm posterior and 0.25 mm lateral to bregma, and 5.7 mm deep from the surface of the skull.Inject 500 nL of rAAV (50 nL min-1) into the SCN, leaving the micro-syringe in place for 10 min after the injection to ensure complete diffusion of rAAV.\nSlowly withdraw the micro-syringe.\nInsert the optical fiber into the SCN area.\n\t\nUsing an optical fiber knife, cut a fiber 17-mm in length, making sure that each side of the optic fiber is smooth.\nInsert the optic fiber into the ceramic ferrule and fix the optic fiber to a ceramic ferrule with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (AB glue), ensuring that the surfaces of the optical fiber and ceramic ferrule are flush.\nClean the fiber with a cold sterilant solution or ethylene oxide.\nAfter rAAV injection (step 3.1.11), insert the ceramic ferrule-containing optic fiber into the SCN.\nFix the ceramic ferrule and optical fiber onto the skull using dental resin and allow to dry.\nSmear the surface of the dental resin with back nail polish. Repeat the procedures outlined in 3.1.2\u00a0to 3.2.5, omitting the actual injection of rAAV for control.\nPost-surgical care\n\t\nProvide mice with post-operative analgesics, such as buprenorphine 2 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously, twice a day.\nPlace mice in a recovery cage while they come out of anesthesia.\nHouse mice individually under a 12 h light/dark condition (light intensity ~100 lux at the bottom of the cage) with food/water available ad libitum. Eight days should be allotted before further experimentation to allow for sufficient recovery time and to ensure optimal fluorescence reporter expression.\n4. In vivo Fluorescence Signal Monitoring and Data Collection\nEight days after surgery, connect the fiber on the mouse head with the fluorescence signal monitor (e.g., Gene Observer). Check the fluorescence signal in the SCN of control mice to establish the background signal. Conduct the observation and measurement of this signal using fluorescence signal monitor.Evaluate the fluorescence signal of experimental mouse with the same operation of the control mouse. Exclude mice which have received the viral vector but which only display the background signal from analysis, as this likely indicates that the tip of the optic fiber has missed the SCN. After these initial measures, return mice to their home cages for another 3 weeks to allow the fluorescence signal to stabilize.\nAfter 3 weeks, connect the mice with the fluorescence signal monitor. Measure the fluorescence for 15 s every 10 min, at a frequency of 100 Hz. During these measurements, the mice are freely moving in their cages with food/water available ad libitum. Use a light intensity at the bottom of the cage of ~100 lux, and a the laser power at the tip of the optic fiber between 15 - 20 \u00b5W.\nAfter the completion of all recordings, perfuse mice with 4% paraformaldehyde, and remove and slice the brains to check placement of the optic fiber. Exclude mice from analysis if the optic fiber tip is not correctly implanted in the SCN.\n5. Data Analysis and Presentation\nMeasure fluorescence signal every 10 min for 15 s, at a frequency of 100 Hz, to yield 1500 data points. The average of these 1500 points translates to the fluorescence signal at any given time point. Plotting multiple averages over time produces a signal-to-time curve which corresponds to the transcriptional rhythm of Cry1 under a control light condition in the SCN of freely moving mice.\nSubscription Required.

Anesthesia and Pre-operative Procedures\nInduction of general anesthesia\n Approval by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee is obtained. Male C57/black mice, aged 10 weeks, are anesthetized. Deliver 4% isoflurane with 0.8 L/min oxygen to a Plexiglas box via an isoflurane vaporizer and place the mouse inside. Alternatively, if preferred by the surgeon, intraperitoneal anesthesia can be used.\nPreserving anesthesia\n After confirmation of anesthesia by lack of reaction to toe pinch, the mouse is put on the operation table in a supine position with a silicone mask. Isoflurane is decreased to 2% to maintain appropriate anesthesia level.\nHair removal\n Ventral hair is removed from the neck to lower abdomen using a hair remover. Hair remover is preferred because the hair that is left using a shaver may interfere with the Doppler ultrasound.\n2. Preoperative Ultrasound\nObjectives of the ultrasound\n Doppler ultrasound examination is performed prior to AVF surgery so as to record the base level findings that can be compared with post-operative findings to see anatomical and physiological changes.\nPoints of observation\n The jugular vein, supra- and infra-renal inferior vena cava (IVC), and abdominal aorta are examined using both pulse Doppler and B-mode.\nMeasurements\n Using the B-mode, diameter of each vasculature is measured. In addition, maximum velocity (peak systolic velocity in arteries) and waveforms are recorded in each of the measuring points described above.\n3. Operative Procedures\nMouse Preparation\nPrepare the incision site with a topical antiseptic and continue proper aseptic technique during the surgery including using a surgical drape, sterile gloves and instruments, etc.\nLaparotomy\n Midline abdominal incision is made from lower edge of the liver to just above the pubis.\nExposure of the aorta and IVC.A retractor is inserted and all of the bowels are pulled out of the abdominal cavity to the right side and kept wrapped in gauze soaked with saline. Dissect the membrane that connects the retroperitoneum and lower colon to get full view of the aorta and IVC. Apply pressure on the bladder if it is dilated and gets in way.\nExposure of the puncture site\n Puncture site will be between half to three quarters of the distance from left renal vein to aortic bifurcation. (Figure 1) Dissect the left margin of the aorta so that it can be punctured. Keep in mind that the aorta is positioned about 45 degrees behind the IVC and it must be dissected posteriorly in addition to the left. (Figure 2) The most important point of this surgery is not to dissect between the aorta and IVC. Keep far away from them.\nExposure of the clamp site of the aorta\n Dissect the infrarenal aorta from surrounding tissues. Be careful not to injure the IVC on the left and left renal veins with its tributaries on the right.\nClamping of the aorta\n Clamp the proximal aorta by applying microsurgery clips.\nRotation of the aorta\n By grasping the connective tissue surrounding the aorta, rotate the aorta so that the puncture can be made from slightly dorsal side of the aorta (Figure 2).\nPuncture of the aorta through to IVC\n Keeping the aorta in a rotated position, puncture the aorta through to IVC using a 25 G needle. (Figure 2) If successful, the needle can be seen through the thin IVC wall.\nHemostasis\n By pulling the retroperitoneal tissues, including the muscles, wrap the puncture site of the aorta. Do not compress the aorta against the IVC, as it may clot the AVF (Figure 3).\nDe-clamping the aortaAfter confirmation of the primary hemostasis, de-clamp the aorta. Additional bleeding may occur but it can be stopped with further compression described above. Upon de-clamping, arterial blood can be seen flowing into the IVC instead of dark venous blood flow.\nClosure of the abdomen\n Return the bowels into its natural position and close the abdomen.\n4. Post-operative Procedures\nPost-operative care\n After closure of the abdomen, isoflurane is stopped. Post-operative care including analgesia and wound care is applied in accordance with the instructions recommended by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For analgesia we use buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg intrasmuscularly every 12 hr for 24 hr following the surgical procedures.\nPost-operative ultrasound\n On the first day after operation, Doppler ultrasound is performed to confirm the AVF. In addition, other variables are measured to check the changes from pre-operative values.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "Note: All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio and were consistent with the ARRIVE guidelines.\n1.\u00a0Anesthetizing for Cortical Preparation\nPlace the mouse in an induction chamber with 2-3% isofluorane mixed with oxygen to induce anesthesia. Observe the respiration rate decrease as the mouse is induced. Pinch the paw of the mouse to determine whether the mouse is ready to move to the nose cone. Note: Anesthesia level is a critical step in any in vivo preparation and care should be taken not to induce a level that will cause global ischemia.\nOnce the mouse is sufficiently anesthetized, transfer the animal to the surgery/imaging platform and place the mouse\u2019s nose in the nose cone and apply 1-1.2% isofluorane to maintain an anesthetized state. Ensure that the mouse is lying on a temperature controlled heating pad to maintain the body temperature (37\u00b0C +/- 0.5\u00b0C) throughout the remaining procedures. Place vet ointment over the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nMonitor the physiology of the mouse using a pulse oximetry system using the tail or foot clip provided with the system. Check that the respiratory rate is maintained between 50-65 breaths/min. Check that the heart rate remains between 300 to 450 bpm and oxygen saturation is maintained between 97-98% to ensure long-term survival of the animal.\nWhen the mouse is adequately anesthetized, shave the hair over the cranium using electric clippers, remove residual hair and clean with betadine, followed by an ethanol swab. Repeat this procedure up to three times to ensure a sterile surgical environment.\n2. Surgical ProcedureWith the scalp fully cleaned and shaven, make a 5 mm incision in the scalp of the mouse to reveal the cranial fissures and to locate bregma.\nUse a sterile cotton applicator to remove any remaining fascia overlying the cranium.\nGlue a custom made stainless steel ring (Figure 1) with tissue adhesive to the bone overlying the parietal cortex using the stereotaxic coordinates of Bregma: -1 to -3 mm and lateral: 2-4 mm. Note: The glue typically sets within 2 min\u00a0after the placement of the ring onto the bone.\nAffix the ring to a stereotaxic holder (Figure 2) to stabilize the mouse and to prevent movement during imaging.\nUnder a surgical grade dissecting microscope, slowly drill a 1-2 mm section in the cranium using a speed controlled dremel-like tool (Meisinger 3.9 mm drill bit) making sure to keep the area level as it is drilled. Achieve this using a zig-zag pattern. To avoid heat build up, set the drill speed to low and take frequent breaks.\nWhen the cranial skull becomes shinny in appearance, continue the thinning of the skull using a scalpel blade utilizing the same zig-zag pattern to keep the thinned surface level to facilitate smooth removal of thin layers of cranial skull. Using the tip of the scalpel blade make small linear strokes with light pressure to remove thin layers of bone at a time. Continue this until the vasculature is clearly visible through the dissecting microscope.\nIf the experimenter punctures through or break the skull during the thinning process, euthanize the animal due to likely damage to the underlying cortex.Note: The mouse skull is approximately 300 \u00b5m in thickness and is comprised of two thin layers of compact bone (one external and one internal layer) and a layer of spongy bone sandwiched between the two layers of compact bone. The external layer of compact bone and most of the spongy bone are removed within the 5 mm drilling area resulting in an approximate 50 \u00b5m layer of compact bone remaining (see Figure 2B). Visualization of the vasculature will ensure that the final intact thinned skull is approximately 50 \u00b5m in thickness. The skull is therefore still present when thinned to this thickness.\n3. Microscope Set-up\nUse an inverted microscope system (conventional, confocal or two-photon systems) that has an objective inverter. Note: It is also possible to utilize a standard upright microscope. The limiting factor will be the space between the stage and the objectives. Modifications to the stage may be necessary to accomplish this setup.\nSecure the surgical/imaging platform to a custom made stage that is located aside the base of the microscope. Note: The platform is made using a laboratory jack to allow vertical movement of the surgical/imaging platform under the objective. The laboratory jack is mounted to a plate affixed to four cylindrical poles. (See Figure 2).\nPosition the objective inverter containing a 20X objective over the cranial window. Use an external light source to find the cranial window by looking through the eyepieces of the microscope and position the objective in the imaging area. Note: The imaging area will be denoted by the presence of the vasculature.For water-based objectives, use artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) (130 mM NaCl; 30 mM KCl; 12 mM KH2PO4; 200 mM NaHCO3; 30 mM HEPES; and 100 mM glucose) as the medium due to potential leakage into the cranial cavity during imaging (Figure 3).\n4. Rose Bengal Dye Preparation, Administration and Induction of Stroke\nPrepare a fresh 20 mg/ml solution of Rose Bengal in artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF); filter and sterilize before administration. Do not reuse or store the Rose Bengal once it has been mixed. Make a fresh solution for each experiment.\nGive a 0.1 ml tail vein injection of Rose Bengal while scanning the cranial window with a 561 nm laser to ensure adequate injection of the solution. Note: Rose Bengal will be visualized within 5 sec after injection in the vasculature of the brain. The entire vessel should be filled with Rose Bengal.\nFollowing adequate injection of Rose Bengal dye choose an appropriate vessel for thrombosis based on vessel diameter (40-80 \u00b5m) to ensure reproducibility of a particular lesion volume. Differentiate between arteries and veins by looking at the direction of blood flow: arteries will move from larger diameter to smaller diameter vessels, veins move from smaller to larger diameter vessels. This is easily accomplished by visualization once Rose Bengal is injected.\nChange the microscope setting as follows:\n\t\nIncrease the dwell time. Note: This will vary depending on the microscope system being utilized.\nIncrease the laser power to 100%.\nCollect time sequence images at 1 frame/sec\u00a0using the maximum scan speed.\nScan the mouse until a stable clot is formed within the vessel. Note: This typically is achieved within 5 min\u00a0of continuous scanning (See Figure 4).Following the induction of clot formation using Rose Bengal, remove the mouse from the imaging area back to the dissecting microscope. Carefully remove the stainless steel ring from the cranial skull. Examine the cranial window for any bleeding. If bleeding occurs, terminate the experiment.\nUse 6.0 monofilament suture to close the incision over the skull. Place antibiotic ointment along the suture line to prevent infection. Inject Buprenex (0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hr for three days for pain management.\nReturn the mouse to a recovery chamber following removal from the anesthetic until fully awake and freely moving.\nReturn the mouse to a clean cage for further investigation at a later time.\n5. Longitudinal Imaging on Subsequent Days\nEmploy the following methods to perform longitudinal imaging on subsequent days post-photothrombosis.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse as described in Section 1 of the methods.\nUpon adequate anesthesia re-open the scalp by removing any residual sutures to reopen the skin overlying the previously drilled imaging field.\nUse a sterile cotton applicator to remove any remaining fascia overlying the cranium.\nGlue a custom made stainless steel ring (Figure 1) with tissue adhesive to the bone overlying the previous imaging field.\nAffix the ring to a stereotaxic holder (Figure 2) to stabilize the mouse and to prevent movement during imaging.\nLocate the vasculature underlying the previously thinned skull. Use tail vein injection of FITC-Dextran to verify the presence of the previously induced clot.\nUse 6.0 monofilament suture to close the incision over the skull. Place antibiotic ointment along the suture line to prevent infection. Inject Buprenex (0.05mg/kg) subcutaneously every 12 hr for three days for pain management.\nReturn the mouse to a recovery chamber following removal from the anesthetic until fully awake and freely moving.\n6.

Quiescent cells are poorly transduced.\nFor infections performed in 96-well plates- the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay:\nDetach cells with 0.25% trypsin from an actively growing culture.\nPellet cells and resuspend in growth medium.\nCount cells in the suspension.\nDilute the cell suspension in growth medium to achieve a final concentration of 2\u20133\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells/mL.Thoroughly mix the cell suspension, transfer it into a sterile trough, and add 100\u00a0\u03bcL to each well (2\u20133\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells/well) with a multichannel pipette.\nFor consistent results, plate cells in the \u201cinner\u201d wells of the plate and reserve the \u201coutermost\u201d wells to fill with fluid (plain growth medium or PBS) in order to prevent drying of the inner wells that contain the plated cells.\nNote: For reproducible results, it is critical to maintain even distribution of cells among dishes and wells during plating. Therefore, we strongly advise repeated mixing of cell suspensions in-between plates and prompt plating, especially when dealing with multiple plates, to prevent cell sedimentation at the bottom of the trough or in the pipette. 2,000\u20133,000 cells/well is a good starting average number that provides room for SYO-1 cell division over several days. However, this number can be optimized (1,000\u20135,000 cells/well range), depending on the specific growth rate of the tested cell line.\nAlternatives: Lipid-based transfection reagents such as lipofectamine, have been successful alternates to the long-established calcium phosphate method. However, their cost has prohibited their use in large scale transfections. By contrast, the Polyethylenimine (PEI) polymer, with a significantly higher cost-effectiveness is considered a good substitute as a transfection reagent.\nStep 2. Lentiviral infection of sarcoma cells for protein and SRB growth analyses\nIn this section we provide a step-by-step description of lentivirus transduction in target cells on Day 3. We also include a direct lysis method for protein analysis and the details of the SRB assay to measure the effect of lentivirus expression on cell growth over three days.\nInfection plus protein analysis in SYO-1 and CDS-X1 cells (days 3-5)\nInfection plus growth analysis in SYO-1 cells (days 3-7)In this protocol 293T cells are transfected with the lentivirus vector pCW57.1-DUX4-CA for overexpression, and the sh-vectors PLKO.1-TRC2, PLKO.1-shSS18-1, and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 for depletion. The viral supernatant of one transfected 293T 6-well plate (\u223c18\u00a0mL yield) dedicated to each vector is sufficient for the infection of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0mm dishes or 180 wells of 96-well plates.\nDay 3\nTiming: 1 h for step 4\nTiming: 6\u00a0h for step 5\nTiming: 6\u00a0h for step 6\nTiming: 6\u201310\u00a0h for step 7\nTiming: 8\u00a0h and 40\u00a0min for step 8\nTiming: 2\u00a0days 4\u00a0h for step 9\nTiming: 2 h/plate/graph for step 10\nTiming: 2 h/graph for step 11\nLentivirus collection.\nAfter two days of virus production, collect the 293T medium containing the lentivirus and pass it through a 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm syringe filter (mixed cellulose esters; Millex-HA).\nNote: Alternatively, the virus can be harvested by centrifugation of the 293T supernatant at 500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C.\nAdd 36\u00a0\u03bcL of polybrene to the 18\u00a0mL viral supernatant collected from the 6-well plate (3\u00a0mL/well) and mix.\nFor best results, immediately infect SYO-1 cells with the virus thus produced.\nNote: Do not be alarmed if the transfected 293T cells appear to have detached from the plate after two days. Floating 293T cells do produce virus.Alternatives: The virus supernatant may be stored at 4\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u00a0days without losing potency. It may also be aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u00a0weeks. However, it loses titer, hence efficiency overtime. It is critical to avoid frequent freeze/thaw cycles of the supernatant. If long term storage is necessary or desired without loss of titer, the virus can be concentrated up to 100-fold as follows: 1) ultracentrifugation, or 2) mixing the virus with polyethylene glycol (PEG; TAKARA Lenti-X concentrator) followed by a slower spin cycle. The concentrated virus is aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nLentivirus infection of SYO-1 and CDS-X1 cells plated in 100\u00a0mm TC dishes.\nNote: One 6-well plate of transfected 293T produces enough virus for 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0mm dishes of target cells.\nAdd 8\u20138.5\u00a0mL of the filtered virus supernatant/polybrene to each 100\u00a0mm dish.\nPlace dish in the TC incubator on a flat shelf for even spread of the virus.\nAllow infection to proceed for 5\u20136 h.\nAspirate the infection medium and add to the dish 10\u00a0mL of growth medium.\nAllow cells to grow in TC incubator until time of analysis (direct lysis or ChIP).\nLentivirus infection of SYO-1 cells in 96-well plates- SRB assay.\nAspirate the growth medium of the cells plated on Day 2.\nAdd 100\u00a0\u03bcL/well of the filtered virus/polybrene supernatant with a multichannel pipette.\nAllow infection to proceed for 5\u20136 h.\nReplace the infection medium with 100\u00a0\u03bcL/well of fresh growth medium.\nAllow cells to grow in TC incubator until time of SRB assay (Day 5\u20137).\nNote: To build a growth curve over several days, remember to dedicate a separate 96-well plate for each consecutive day.\nSequential infections.Note: Sequential infections are beneficial when improved efficiency is needed, for transduction of different vectors, or when dealing with transduction-resistant cells.\nAllow the first infection to proceed for 3\u20135 h.\nDuring this time, store the virus supernatant destined for the second infection at 4\u00b0C.\nAspirate the first virus medium and replace it with the second virus.\nIncubate cells for additional 3\u20135 h.\nReplace the infection medium with fresh growth medium.\nNote: The results presented in this protocol- protein analysis, SRB assays, and ChIP assay -were all derived from single-round infections.\nDay 5\nTesting SYO-1 and CDS-X1 cells infection efficiency by direct lysis and western blotting.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Efficient lentiviral SS18-SSX2 depletion and DUX4 overexpression in sarcoma cells with one round of infection following the calcium phosphate/BES method\n(A) Immunoblot shows SS18-SSX2 depletion with sh-lentiviral vectors PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 in SYO-1 cells. PLKO.1-TRC2 is the non-target control vector. SS18-SSX2 band intensities were quantified after subtracting background values in ImageJ software. Each value was then measured as a ratio relative to the intensity of the corresponding actin in the panel below. Finally, the relative SS18-SSX2 intensity ratios of PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 were compared to the relative ratio of the control PLKO.1-TRC2 that was designated as 1.\n(B) Immunoblot shows inducible expression of lentiviral DUX4 in CDS-X1 sarcoma cells. DOX is doxycycline. \u03b2-actin (Actin) served as loading control.\nNote: We normally assess infection efficiency and protein expression by western blotting. DUX4 overexpression with pCW57.1-DUX4-CA in CDS-X1 cells, and SS18-SSX2 depletion with PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 vectors in SYO-1 cells, are shown in Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nPlace the 2\u00d7 SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 37\u00b0C to thaw.\nNote: Return the sample buffer to the \u221220\u00b0C freezer immediately after use.\nTake the infected SYO-1 and CDS-X1 cells out of the 37\u00b0C incubator.Under light microscope, thoroughly examine every dish and estimate the density of adherent/surviving cells in every dish; write this percentage on the lid of the dish with a magic marker (e.g., 30%, 50%, 80%, etc.).\nMake a mental or written note of the extent of dead/floating cells in every dish.\nNote: This visual test is very beneficial as it provides first clues of a growth phenotype caused by the transduced vectors. Recording percentage of cell confluency helps determine the appropriate volume of 2\u00d7 SDS-PAGE buffer later used for direct cell lysis.\nPlace cells on working bench and aspirate growth medium.\nWash the cells three times with ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS.\nDecant the last PBS wash.\nTilt the dish and let it stand on the bench to drain the remaining PBS.\nAspirate the last of PBS.\nAdd to each dish the quantity of 2\u00d7 SDS sample buffer adjusted according to cell density written on the lid. For example, if a 100% confluent dish that would count 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u2013107 cells is lysed in 1\u00a0mL 2\u00d7 SDS-PAGE buffer, a 50% confluent dish is lysed in 0.5\u00a0mL SDS-PAGE buffer.\nScrape the lysed cells with a cell lifter.\nPlace cell lysate in a 1.5\u00a0mL centrifuge tube.\nBoil lysate at 95\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, pulse spin tubes to set the condensation at the tube lids and store the lysates at \u221220\u00b0C until time of loading on SDS-PAGE gel for western transfer.\nNote: Frozen protein lysates are stable, they can be used in several immunoblots and withstand re-freezing. However, it is best to avoid re-boiling and instead warm the lysates at 50\u00b0C\u201360\u00b0C for 3\u20135\u00a0min in subsequent western blots to protect some labile proteins (e.g., ETV4) that degrade upon frequent boiling.Load and run on SDS-PAGE gel equal volumes of lysates which, according to the lysis method described above (i.e., adjusting lysate volumes to cell density), should contain equal protein concentrations. Assess protein expression levels by immunoblotting. Include a loading control (\u03b2-actin) for quantification of relative band intensities.\nQuantify changes in protein expression by comparing band intensities in ImageJ imaging analysis software.\nNote: For protein content, we estimate that on average, lysis of a fully confluent 100\u00a0mm dish that contains \u223c107 adherent (non-round) cells yields \u223c1\u00a0mg protein. Thus, 50\u00a0\u03bcL of \u223c1\u00a0mg/mL lysate are used to load \u223c50\u00a0\u03bcg of protein in a lane. We often study labile proteins that include transcription factors with short half-lives. Direct lysis and boiling in the protein sample buffer that contains 4% SDS and the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol protect and allow detection of unstable proteins that would otherwise be rapidly degraded in standard RIPA buffer, despite protective supplements such as protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Therefore, determining the volume of lysis buffer for every dish based on cell density estimate is a reliable method for equal protein loading. It does however require a practiced eye and a long-standing habit of observing cells under a microscope.\nAlternatives: Lysis with RIPA buffer and the Bradford assay for protein quantification are excellent alternatives to the direct lysis method, provided the tested cellular proteins are stable.\nDay 5\u20137\nThe SRB assay was developed by Vichai and Kirtikara5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] for cytotoxicity screening. We have been successfully applying this method to measure the effects of a variety of lentiviral vectors on cell proliferation. We also use this assay to build drug dose-response curves.One main advantage of the SRB assay is its performance in 96-well plates, which allows the inclusion of several experimental groups and acquisition of multiple data points for each group in one plate, two important criteria for reproducibility and statistical significance. SRB is a bright pink dye that binds basic amino acid residues under acidic conditions. It measures cellular protein content, and the dye intensity is proportional to cell mass. It is a highly sensitive assay and gives linear readings for cell densities ranging from 1,000 cells to 180,000 cells/well. With this wide room for growth, we can measure cell proliferation over several days under diverse conditions.\nFigures\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A show the effect of SS18-SSX2 depletion by lentiviral PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 on SYO-1 growth. Cell growth was measured in SRB assays over three days (Days 5, 6, and 7), as detailed below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. SRB assay to measure effect of SS18-SSX2 depletion on SYO-1 cell growth\nGrowth was measured 2\u00a0days (Day 5), 3\u00a0days (Day 6), and 4\u00a0days (Day 7) after infection of SYO-1 cells with lentiviral vectors PLKO.1-shSS18-1, PLKO.1-shSSX2-2, and PLKO.1-TRC2 (control) on Day 3, as described in the text.\n(A and B) (A) Shows digital images of SRB-stained 96-well plates of infected SYO-1, and (B)\u00a0displays corresponding absorbance reads at 570\u00a0nm on the respective days. The raw data (upper tables) were corrected (lower tables) by subtracting the average value of the background noise (blank wells) in each plate. Twenty wells were allocated to each vector in one plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04.

Note the continued proliferation of SYO-1 cells transduced with control vector PLKO.1-TRC2 versus the apparent cell growth arrest and eventual death with the SS18-SSX2-depleting vectors, PLKO.1-shSSX8-1 and PLKO.1-SSX2-2. The plots were built in RStudio. Error bars represent standard deviation. P values were calculated from Z scores of PLKO.1-shSSX8-1 and PLKO.1-SSX2-2 relative to control PLKO.1-TRC2 and two-tailed hypothesis. P \u2264 0.05 are considered significant. P\u00a0= 0.337 (in red) in Day 5 graph of PLKO.1-SSX2-2 indicates non-significant growth effect.\n(B) Screenshot shows imported Excel dataset of Day 7 SRB values into RStudio.\n(C) Screenshot displays the commands written to generate the bar graph of Day 7 SRB data.\nSRB staining performed on SYO-1 cells on designated days post-infection (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCell fixation.\nTake the 96-well plate out of the 37\u00b0C incubator and transfer to the working bench.\nAdd 100\u00a0\u03bcL of cold 10% TCA to each well with a multichannel pipette.\nTransfer plate to a flat surface at 4\u00b0C (cold room or fridge).\nAllow TCA fixation to proceed for 1 h.\nWash after fixation.\nAfter 1\u00a0h of TCA fixation, bring the plate to a lab sink.\nPlace a stack of folded paper towels on the edge of the sink.\nOpen the distilled water tap and regulate the water to a smooth jet.\nRemove the lid and tilt the 96-well plate at an angle.\nAllow the water to fill the 96 wells from one side of the plate.\nNote: Do not allow the water jet to hit the bottom of the wells as it can cause cells to detach.\nEmpty the wells by inverting the plate.\nTap the inverted plate on the stack of paper towels to remove remaining water.Repeat the wash three more times.\nLet the open plate air dry for 16\u201318 h, at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C.\nNote: The dry plate can be stored indefinitely at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C after fixation.\nCell staining.\nAdd 100\u00a0\u03bcL of 0.057% SRB solution to each well.\nLet the plate stain flat on the bench for 30\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C.\nWashes.\nBring to the sink: the stained plate, 500\u00a0mL of 1% acetic acid, and a stack of paper towels.\nInvert the plate in the sink to empty the SRB solution.\nWash the plate four times with 1% acetic acid, as described for the water washes.\nRemember to fill the wells by pouring the acid solution from the side, by tilting the plate.\nLet the plate air dry for 16\u201318\u00a0h on the bench at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C.\nNote: The dry plate can be stored indefinitely at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C.\nAbsorbance measurement (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nAdd 200\u00a0\u03bcL of 10\u00a0mM Tris to each well.\nAgitate the plate on a bench shaker at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min to dissolve the SRB stain.\nPlace the plate in a microplate reader, measure absorbance at wavelength 490\u00a0nm\u2013570\u00a0nm.\nNote: We routinely measure our assays at 570\u00a0nm wavelength, with consistent results. In the event the reads at 570\u00a0nm appear to be outside the linear range, a lower wavelength such as 490\u00a0nm is a good alternative.\nAlternatives: The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthazolk-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay has commonly been used to measure changes in cell viability/proliferation. This assay in\u00a0general represents a good alternative to the SRB assay. However, its high sensitivity to labile\u00a0metabolic conditions could be a source of false apparent fluctuations in viability/growth.\nData analysis and graphing (Figures\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nSave the absorbance data in Excel.In Excel, calculate the average of reads in one row at the edge of the plate that did not contain cells. This average will serve as \u201cbackground\u201d noise.\nAdjust reads in the experimental wells by subtracting the average background value in b).\nTransfer the \u201ccorrected\u201d values of each experimental group to RStudio to draw a bar graph with overlaid dots that represent individual values.\nBuild a basic bar graph in RStudio from an Excel sheet (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: RStudio is an excellent medium for building all sorts of graphs; bar graphs, box plots, dot plots etc.., for clear data presentation.\nFigure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] illustrates the steps for SRB data (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) retrieval and R wording to generate the bar graphs shown in Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nWatch a tutorial on the use of RStudio to learn R language. Several good tutorials exist online. b. Download and install R software (open source).\nDownload and install RStudio for data plotting.\nCreate a new excel sheet. Name the data of the Y axis (Absorbance) and under the name organize the SRB values in a continuous column according to sequential groups (control-TRC2, PLKO.1-SS18-1, PLKO.1-SSX2-2). In the adjacent column, give the X axis a name (Vector), and in the X axis column insert the name of each data point (control-TRC2, PLKO.1-SS18-1, PLKO.1-SSX2-2).\nOpen RStudio and import the Excel dataset in the Environment box, as depicted in Figures\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C.\nSelect the Excel data to be viewed in the Base box (top left, Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nTo build the SRB graph of Absorbance/growth values on Day 7 (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A), the following commands were written in the Console (lower left box, Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C):\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0p<-ggplot(data=Day_4_SRB, aes(x=Vector, y=Absorbance))\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+ geom_bar(stat=\u201dsummary\u201d, fill=\u201ddarkgreen\u201d, width=0.5)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+ theme_classic()\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0p+geom_point(position=position_jitter(0.1, size=0.7))\u00a0+ ylim(0,0.6)The graph image will appear in the plots box and saved as a TIFF file.\nStatistics.\nCalculate the mean, SEM (Standard Error of the Mean), and SD (Standard Deviation) in R or Excel.\nCalculate P values to compare means between 2 groups using 2-tailed tests.\nFor 3 or more experimental groups, use 1-way ANOVA F ratios and P values to compare multiple means.\nStep 3.

In this protocol we describe detailed steps of a CHIP experiment performed in SYO-1 cells transduced with the lentiviruses PLKO.1-TRC2 (non-target control), PLKO.1-shSS18-1, PLKO.1-shSSX2-2, to study the effect of SS18-SSX2 depletion on ETV5 binding to a recently discovered specific site located in intron 1 of the E2F1 gene locus (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B). This question arose when we discovered that E2F1 expression (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A) was significantly reduced upon SS18-SSX2 depletion (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), whereas ETV5 levels were increased in the same SYO-1 cells.Note: We have used this method to determine cell cycle genes occupancy by transcription factors such as Capicua (CIC), ETV5 and E2F1 in na\u00efve and lentivirus transduced sarcoma cells. The method is a modified version of the original protocol published by the Young laboratory.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] It was adjusted to fit a ChIP experiment with 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u20132.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 cells or the equivalent of five 100\u00a0mm dishes at 40%\u201350% confluency. This cell number is sufficient for four individual IP reactions. It is critical to conduct ChIP experiments with actively growing cells at \u223c 40%\u201350% density unless it is specifically intended for analysis during quiescence (full confluency).\nCritical: Cleaning of work surfaces and instruments: it is imperative to conduct any experiment that involves an extremely sensitive assay such as PCR in a clean, uncontaminated environment. Before the start of the ChIP experiment, thoroughly wipe the working surfaces and pipet aids with a 10% bleach solution (100\u00a0mL Clorox bleach/900\u00a0mL milli-Q water in a spray bottle). In addition, use RNAse-free and DNAse-free plasticware such as plastic pipettes, filtered (aerosol barrier) pipette tips, gloves (rub gloved hands every now and then with a spray of 10% bleach).\nDay 5\nNote: The quantities suggested throughout were fitted for 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u20132.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 cells or the equivalent of 4\u20135\u00d7 100\u00a0mm dishes at 40%\u201350% confluency. This cell number is sufficient for four individual IP reactions.\nSYO-1 cell crosslinking and harvest - 2\u00a0days post-infection with lentiviral vectors.\nHave ready: ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS, 16% formaldehyde (20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C), and 2.5\u00a0M glycine (20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C).\nRemove the cells from 37\u00b0C incubator and place them on a working bench (20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C).\nWith a 10\u00a0mL plastic pipette, adjust the volume of growth medium to 7.5\u00a0mL in each dish.Add to each dish 0.5\u00a0mL 16% formaldehyde to obtain a 1% final concentration.\nPlace the dish on a benchtop shaker platform and slowly agitate for 10\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C.\nQuench with 1/20th volume of 2.5\u00a0M glycine (0.42\u00a0mL/dish) and agitate for 5\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C on a benchtop shaker platform.\nWash cells with cold 1\u00d7 PBS, repeat wash twice.\nAfter washes, tilt the dishes on the bench and let stand for 1\u20132\u00a0min, then aspirate the last of PBS with vacuum.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL of cold PBS to each dish, collect cells with a cell scraper, and place cells in a 15\u00a0mL centrifuge tube kept on ice.\nNote: We typically combine the contents of 4\u20135\u00d7 100\u00a0mm dishes in one 15\u00a0mL tube.\nPellet cells in a benchtop (4\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C) centrifuge at 1,350\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min.\nAspirate the PBS supernatant.\nIf not used immediately, flash freeze the cell pellet in a dry ice-ethanol bath or liquid nitrogen for a few minutes and store at \u221280\u00b0C until IP.\nBlocking magnetic beads: conducted at 4\u00b0C with solutions and tubes on ice.\nPlace amounts of magnetic beads (protein A/G in this experiment) to be used for lysate preclearing or IP in two separate tubes.\nNote: We routinely use 15\u201325\u00a0\u03bcL of the bead slurry for every IP reaction. The choice of appropriate beads- protein G versus protein A/G -depends on the optimal binding affinity of the IP antibody.\nWash the beads 3 times with 1\u00a0mL cold PBS, by inverting the tubes 25 times.\nCollect the beads on a standing magnet and remove the PBS with a pipette tip.\nResuspend the beads in 1\u00a0mL cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA (mol biol grade).\nBlock beads for 2\u20134\u00a0h on an end-to-end rotator at 4\u00b0C.Collect blocked beads on a standing magnet and remove supernatants.\nKeep one tube of beads on ice for lysate preclearing. Store the second tube with blocked beads at 4\u00b0C for use in IP the next day.\nCell lysis while blocking beads: conducted at 4\u00b0C with solutions and tubes on ice.\nResuspend cell pellet in 3\u00a0mL cold lysis buffer 1 (LB1) and transfer 1.5\u00a0mL to two chilled 1.5\u00a0mL tubes.

Chromatin shearing with MISONIX XL 2000\nImages show sonicated DNA in two independent ChIP experiments with 10\u00a0s\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 pulse cycles and 3-min pauses between cycles. DNAs were run next to a 100\u00a0bp DNA ladder and a 1 kb DNA ladder (left image).\nNote: Below details describe chromatin sonication using a Misonix XL-2000 sonicator. Refer to Figures\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for illustration.\nAdjust the sonicator gauge to middle power- level 5.\nPlace the ice bucket containing the two tubes under the sonicator probe.Open one tube and with one hand hold it steady, centered (avoid touching the sides), with the probe tip near the bottom of the tube to prevent foam formation, as shown in Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nPulse for 10 s.\nReturn the tube to ice immediately and pulse the second tube for 10 s.\nSet the timer for a pause/cooling period of 3\u00a0min.\nNote: Pause time can be prolonged beyond 3\u00a0min to allow a larger number of tubes sufficient time to cool between pulses.\nRepeat this cycle nine more times, for a total of 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0s pulses.\nNote: The suggested sonication program is adequate for our ChIP-PCR or ChIP-qPCR assays as it reproducibly generates DNA fragments in the required size range (200\u00a0bp-600\u00a0bp; Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Sonication conditions must be optimized if different sonicators or a bioruptor are used for shearing chromatin.\nCritical: Chromatin sonication conditions are optimized before beginning the ChIP project. For this, 50\u00a0\u03bcL\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcL aliquots of lysates representing various sonication conditions are processed following steps 16 (h-l), 19, and 20 (below, with volumes adjusted accordingly), to obtain purified DNA. The size range of the sonicated DNAs is determined by electrophoresis on 1%\u20131.5% agarose gels. Once the optimal sonication conditions are established, the size of sheared DNA can be confirmed at the end of the ChIP assay by running 5\u00a0\u03bcL\u201310\u00a0\u03bcL of the input (whole cell extract; WCE) sample on an agarose gel.\nAfter sonication, add to each tube 1/10th volume of 10% Triton-X (100\u00a0\u03bcL).\nRotate tubes for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nSpin the lysates for 10\u00a0min at 20,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g in cold microcentrifuge.\nPool the supernatants in a 15\u00a0mL conical tube on ice.\nSave 50\u00a0\u03bcL of the lysate as WCE input control and store at \u221280\u00b0C.Days 5 and 6\nImmunoprecipitation of shSS18-SSX2 transduced SYO-1 lysates with ETV5 and rabbit IgG (R-IgG) antibodies.\nTransfer the combined lysate to two 1.5\u00a0mL tubes (1\u00a0mL each).\nPreclearing: resuspend the blocked beads (see above) in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of LB3, add 50\u00a0\u03bcL of the slurry to each tube and rock on rotator for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nCapture beads on a magnet and combine the precleared lysates in a 15\u00a0mL tube.\nDivide the lysate into individual 1.5\u00a0mL tubes. The lysate thus prepared is sufficient for up to four IP reactions.\nAdd antibodies to the tubes and incubate while rotating for 16\u201318\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nNote: We generally use 3\u20135\u00a0\u03bcg of antibody for 1\u00a0mL lysate.\nNext day: resuspend the BSA-blocked magnetic beads prepared on the previous day in cold LB3 (kept in the fridge from the day before), add equal amounts to the lysate/antibody IP tubes, and rock for 4\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nCollect bead-bound chromatin complexes on a magnet and remove supernatant.\nWash beads with 1\u00a0mL cold RIPA buffer by rocking for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and repeat wash 3\u00a0times.\nWash beads with 1\u00a0mL cold TE (Tris/EDTA), containing 50\u00a0mM NaCl by inverting tubes 25 times. Capture beads on magnet and remove supernatant.\nDay 6 to Day 7\nElution of ETV5-ChIP complexes and reverse crosslinking.\nResuspend beads in each tube with 70\u00a0\u03bcL elution buffer prewarmed at 65\u00b0C.\nIncubate tubes in a 65\u00b0C water bath. Set a timer for 20\u00a0min, and every 2\u00a0min briefly vortex tubes and return to 65\u00b0C water bath.\nAt the end of the 20-min elution, spin tubes in a microcentrifuge at full speed (20,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g) for 1\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C.Transfer 65\u00a0\u03bcL of the supernatant/eluate to a new tube and discard the beads. Incubate the eluates at 65\u00b0C for 16\u201318\u00a0h to reverse crosslinking.\nThaw the WCE/input tube (stored at \u221280\u00b0C), add 3\u00d7 volume (150\u00a0\u03bcL) elution buffer, and incubate at 65\u00b0C for 16\u201318\u00a0h to reverse crosslinking.\nDay 7 to Day 8\nETV5-bound DNA cleaning and precipitation.\nNext day: add an equal volume TE; 65\u00a0\u03bcL to IP tubes and 200\u00a0\u03bcL to WCE.\nRNA digestion: add RNAse A (10\u00a0mg/mL) to 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL final concentration to all tubes and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 2 h.\nProtein digestion: add proteinase K (20\u00a0mg/mL) to 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL final concentration to all tubes and incubate at 55\u00b0C for 2 h.\nDNA cleaning: add 5\u00a0M NaCl to 200\u00a0mM final concentration to all tubes. Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and mix by vigorous vortexing for 20 s. Spin tubes at maximum speed (20,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g) for 5\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C and carefully\u00a0transfer the top aqueous phase to a new tube. Add an equal volume of chloroform and repeat the same procedure, then carefully transfer the top aqueous phase to a new tube.\nDNA precipitation: add to each tube 35\u00a0\u03bcg of glycogen (7\u00a0\u03bcL of a 5\u00a0mg/mL solution) and \u2265 2\u00d7 volume of absolute ethanol. Thoroughly mix by inverting tubes several times and store overnight at \u221280\u00b0C.\nDay 8\u20139\nDNA reconstitution.\nNext day: pellet DNA at maximum speed (20,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g) for 40\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, carefully decant the supernatant without disturbing DNA pellet.Add 500\u00a0\u03bcL of ice-cold 70% ethanol to DNA pellet and spin at maximum speed for 3\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Repeat the ethanol wash once and sediment the last of the remaining ethanol with a pulse spin, then carefully remove the extra alcohol with a thin tip.\nAllow the DNA pellet to air dry for a few minutes on the bench.\nAdd to each tube 30\u00a0\u03bcL\u201350\u00a0\u03bcL of molecular biology grade H2O (without disturbing the DNA pellet) and allow the DNA pellets to dissolve for 16\u201318\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nNote: 10\u00a0mM Tris pH 8.0 may be used in place of H2O to immediately dissolve DNA, with pipetting, a brief vortex, then a pulse spin.\nNext day: mix dissolved DNA by pipetting, a brief vortex, followed by a pulse spin.\nMeasure DNA concentration in a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.\nNote: Glycogen may lower the 260/280 ratio; however, phenol/chloroform cleaning should ensure DNA purity.\nPretesting the ChIP DNA with PCR before qPCR.\nNote: To save time and costly resources, we routinely test the quality of ChIP DNA in a semi-quantitative PCR reaction before the qPCR assay; we consider it as a consolidation of the results obtained in the accompanying qPCR.\nWe present as an example the PCR experiment in Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B that we conducted on the ETV5-ChIP in SYO-1 cells. The results show an evident decrease in ETV5 specific binding to E2F1 intron 1 region upon SS18-SSX2 depletion with transduced vectors PLKO.1-shSS18-1, PLKO.1-shSSX2-2, compared to control PLKO.1- TRC2 vector.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07.

PLKO.1-TRC2 is non target control. Numbers under ETV5 image represent relative protein band intensities. ETV5 band intensities were quantified after subtracting background values in ImageJ software. Each value was then determined as a ratio relative to the intensity of the corresponding actin intensity in the panel below. Finally, the relative ratios of intensities of ETV5 in PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 cells were compared to that of the relative ratio of ETV5 intensity in control PLKO.1-TRC2 that was designated as 1.\n(B) semi-quantitative PCR that shows ETV5 specific binding to E2F1 first intron, performed on DNA purified from ETV5/R-IgG ChIP in na\u00efve SYO-1 cells.

The E2F1 primers used were the ones described in B). WCE is input DNA. Numbers above the PCR image represent relative intensities. E2F1 band intensities that reflect ETV5 binding were quantified after subtracting background values in ImageJ software. Each value was then determined as a ratio relative to the intensity of the corresponding WCE (input DNA) intensity. The relative ratios of intensities of E2F1 band in PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 cells were compared to that of the relative ratio of E2F1 band intensity in control PLKO.1-TRC2 that was designated as 1. 25\u00a0ng of DNA were used in every PCR reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2473_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2473_11.csv\nPCR products were resolved on a 2.5% agarose gel.\nRelative DNA band intensities were measured with ImageJ software.", "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Westlake University.\n1. Implant assembling\nNOTE: Assembling of the imaging implant is technically simple and requires only commercially available items (Figure 1, see also Table of Materials). The head plates can be manufactured at the local machine shop using stainless-steel or titanium plates. We suggest preparing a stock of fully assembled implants before starting the surgeries. After in vivo experiments are done, the implants can be recovered and reused multiple times. In some cases, it may only require reattaching the infusion cannula by soldering or replacing the cover glass.\nPrepare all six key hardware components for assembling and installation imaging implants (Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Six key hardware components for assembling and installation of the imaging implant.

In the case of other materials used to manufacture cannulas, end-user should select flux that can weld the selected material.\nMelt soldering tin and apply it to the connection spot treated with flux (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Avoid excess soldering tin, as it will require unnecessary larger craniotomy during the surgery.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic of assembling injection cannula, consisting of guide cannula with inserted dummy cannula, with the imaging cannula.

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig02large.jpg]\nWait for the soldering tin to cool down. Usually, it takes several seconds.\nConfirm that the injection cannula is not blocked by inserting the dummy cannula from both directions.\nApply UV-curing optical adhesive on the bottom side of the imaging cannula using a toothpick or 26 G syringe needle.\nUse a fine tweezer to carefully place a cover glass of the corresponding size to the imaging cannula.\n\tNOTE: The positioning of the glass must be done precisely onto the imaging cannula without moving the glass too much once it has touched the optical adhesive. Otherwise, the glass gets dirty, thus reducing the quality of imaging.Cure the adhesive for a least an hour by 350-400 nm UV illumination from a standard handheld UV lamp.\n\tNOTE: The used adhesive must be optically transparent. Otherwise, it will decrease the quality of the imaging window.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid skin and eye exposure by wearing UV-protecting glasses, gloves, and a lab coat.\nWash the cannula in 70% ethanol, air dry, and store in a sterile container until surgery.\n\t\u200bNOTE: It is very important to keep the cover glass as clean and intact as possible. The used optical adhesive is chemically stable in 70% ethanol.\n2. Window implantation\nPreparation steps before the surgery\n\t\nSterilize all the surgical instruments in an autoclave.\nPrepare 1x PBS and 70% ethanol in two separate Petri dishes.\nOptionally: Disinfect the surgery area using UV light for at least 20 minutes before starting the surgical procedure.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: Operating under the most sterile conditions possible will result in successful and long-lasting (as long as 6 months) glass-covered cranial windows. Contamination may result in reduced window transparency or severe inflammation in most cases.\nSurgical procedure\n\t\nSterilize the surgical area with 70% ethanol right before the surgery.\nWeigh the animal and administer a pre-surgical dose of analgesic subcutaneously according to the IACUC approved animal protocol.\nAnesthetize a mouse with isoflurane (4% for induction, 1.5-2% for maintaining, 0.3-0.5 L/min flow rate of air). Use a tail-pinch and toe-pinch technique to ensure the animal is fully sedated. Observe vital signs of the animal, such as respiration, SpO2, and heart rate for the duration of the procedure.\nUse a trimmer or depilatory cream to remove the fur from the back of the neck up to the eyes.Place mouse in a stereotaxic frame over a surgery heating pad (maintaining 37 \u00b0C). Secure the head with ear bars. Slightly push the head in all directions to make sure the head is secured firmly.\nApply eye ointment to prevent the animal's eyes from drying out during the surgery.\nSterilize the surgical site with betadine followed by 70% ethanol three times before making an incision.\nRemove the skin over the top of the skull, starting with a horizontal cut all along the base of the head, followed by two cuts in the rostral direction, almost reaching the eyelids, then two oblique cuts that converge at the midline.\nWith two sterile cotton swabs, retract the connecting tissue, as well as the musculature of the back of the neck, to the edges of the skull.\n\t\tNOTE: Try to avoid damaging blood vessels (especially ones hidden in the muscle) during manipulation.\nApply a drop of lidocaine solution (~0.1 mL) to the surface of the periosteum for 2 minutes to avoid excessive pain. Optionally to reduce the brain from swelling after removing the skull, 0.1 mL of 1% dexamethasone can be injected subcutaneously.\nGently scrape the entire exposed area of the skull with a scalpel to create a dry and rough surface that allows glue and the dental cement to adhere better and thus resulting in chronic implantation.\nPlace the tip of the needle mounted on the stereotaxic station onto the bregma, set all three coordinates (AP: Anterior-Posterior; ML: Medial-Lateral; DV: Dorsal-Ventral) as 0.Place tip of the needle onto the lambda and see if the AP coordinate is 0 to confirm that the head position is vertical, as well as if the ML coordinate is 0 to confirm the head is positioned horizontally. If not, adjust corresponding knobs on the stereotaxic station, until the AP and ML coordinates are both within 0.1 mm.\nMove the tip of the needle to find the corresponding points for craniotomy and mark their positions on the skull using a fine marker. In the case of implantation for hippocampus, there are 4 points with the following coordinates (AP: -0.68, ML: -2.0) (AP: -3.68, ML: -2.0) (AP: -2.18, ML: -0.5) and (AP: -2.18, ML: -3.5)11, as well as (AP: -4.0, ML: -2.0) for the most caudal point of the injection cannula.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: The marker used in this step must be sterilized using UV illumination for at least an hour before the surgery. The coordinates shown here are for 6-8-week old C57BL/6J mice. The coordinates may differ due to different ages or strains of mice.\nDraw a circle based on four marked points, as well as the outline of the injection cannula area on the caudal side of the circle (Figure 3).\nUse a pneumatic drill at the speed of 10,000 rpm to gently \"draw\" along the outline marked on the skull.\nDrill the skull until a very thin layer of bone is left, which usually starts to wiggle under gentle touch in the center.\nApply a drop of sterile 1x PBS to the center of the craniotomy, lift the bone flap from the skull with very thin tip forceps or two 26 G needles approaching from opposite sides.\n\tNOTE: The PBS will help remove the piece of skull and prevent possible bleeding of the dura12.Apply PBS, followed by gentle aspiration through a 26G blunt needle several times to clean the surface of the dura.\nGently remove the dura, either by aspiration or by ophthalmic scissors. Apply gentle suction (~-60kPa) to ablate the cortex, as well as the corpus callosum above the hippocampus.\n\tNOTE: The cortex is often more yellow than the corpus callosum, and the corpus callosum is usually whiter than the hippocampus. The corpus callosum is usually easy to distinguish by neuronal fibers going in the vertical and horizontal directions when observed from the top (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Stereotaxic coordinates of hippocampus location and brain ablation process. (A) Four coordinates for the edges of the craniotomy area. (B) Complete craniotomy area. (C-E) Representative images acquired during the surgery (left) and their schematic diagram (right) indicating the different colors and directions of neural fibers of (A) Cortex (B) Corpus Callosum, and (C) Hippocampus visible during cortex ablation. Scale bar: 1 mm. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig03large.jpg]\nBleeding at this point will affect the visibility of the brain tissue in the craniotomy. Apply 1x PBS, followed by gentle suction, while aspirating the cortex to get rid of the blood.\n\tNOTE: Continuous bleeding is inevitable during this step, and to some extent, continuous bleeding is a sign of normal blood pressure. Unlike cortex imaging window implantation, the presence of blood under the optical window is acceptable since it will be cleared several days after the surgery. Insertion of the imaging cannula to the created cavity as soon as possible after ablating the cortex is optimal.\nIf the craniotomy is larger by <0.5 mm than the imaging cannula, rescue the installation of the cannula to some extent by using extra Kwik Sil sealing before fixing the implant with SuperBond.If the craniotomy is smaller by <0.5 mm than imaging cannula, rescue the surgical procedure to some extent by trimming the edge of the craniotomy using a fine tweezer or a pair of ophthalmic scissors since the remaining bone at the edge of craniotomy is thinner than the skull itself as a result of drilling.\n\tNOTE: Craniotomies which are exceeding the ranges above 0.5 mm cannot be rescued. The corresponding actions in those cases should follow the termination procedure according to the animal protocol.\nGently insert the implant into the craniotomy.\nFirmly press on top of the implant with the L-shaped needle to position the optical window of the implant as close as possible to the exposed surface of the hippocampus. Repeatedly apply PBS on the skull around the implant followed by suction to remove blood as much as possible during implant insertion. Then apply a thin layer of Kwik Sil between the implant and skull to prevent dental cement from penetrating under the skull (Figure 4).\n\t\nEnsure the placement of the optical window of the implant is right against of hippocampus to avoid blood or other liquid accumulation underneath.\n\t\tNOTE: The critical point is to make sure that the cover glass of the imaging cannula is placed right against the hippocampus, which may require gentle pressure on top of the cannula during the installation and sealing process. Whether the upper side of the imaging cannula is parallel to the skull is not critical for the final optical access as long as the optical window is placed against the hippocampus.\nAccording to the average thickness of the cortex above the CA1 area, keep the upper surface of the imaging cannula above the skull surface by ~0.5 mm to facilitate attachment of the cannula to the skull (Figure 4).Once the Kwik Sil is cured, which usually takes no more than ~1 min, apply Super-Bond C&B evenly on the surface of the skull, the surface of Kwik-Sil, and the upper surface of the implant.\nOnce the Super-Bond C&B is cured, apply denture base resin above the Super-Bond C&B, as well as the skin around the incision made at the beginning of the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Alternative types of cement are available from multiple vendors. Follow the corresponding manufacturer's instructions.\nAfter the denture base resin is cured, place the head plate on the resin around the implant and make it concentric with the imaging cannula. Apply more denture base resin around and above the head plate to fix its position. Let it cure for several minutes.\n\t\nAvoid building up a thick layer of cement around the cannula to ensure better access to the imaging window with the objective lens (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Schematic diagram of window implantation in (A) coronal and (B) sagittal view.

Anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic are injected subcutaneously for two-three days post-surgery every 24 hours to release pain and reduce the inflammatory response.\n\tNOTE: Alternative monitoring procedures, drugs, and dosages are possible for postoperative care, refer to the IUCAC approved animal protocol for the exact procedure.\nCheck the window 5-7 days post-surgery to observe vasculature under the window. In the case of a clear window, the animal is ready for virus injection.\n3. Virus Injection\nNOTE: Virus injection is usually done in 5-7 days after the surgery. Before virus injection, it has to be confirmed that the imaging window is clear, and it is possible to observe brain vasculature (Figure 5). In some cases, it may take up to 14-16 days to clear the window, which is also acceptable if no brain inflammation is detected.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Representative image of optical window (A) before and (B) after virus injection supplemented with FastGreen dye.

Expression level and time depend on the virus serotype and promoter used to drive gene expression.\n4. Imaging of awake mice under wide-field microscope.\nNOTE: The prepared head plate provides extraordinary stability of imaging implant and thus allows for longitudinal imaging in awake and behaving mice with minimal motion artifacts.\nInduce the mouse with 4% isoflurane for a few minutes, fix its head plate to the head fork, and then fix the head fork to the treadmill.\n\tNOTE: The head fork and the treadmill are customized for the headplate used in this study, please see Supporting Materials for the corresponding cad files. Induction of mouse before head fixation is optional as it is possible to habituate animal for this procedure.\nMove the treadmill under the microscope stage and position the optical window under objective lens.Use a low magnification objective lens to find the best field of view (FOV) for functional imaging, then switch to a higher NA objective lens to record the neuronal activities at single-cell resolution.\n\tNOTE: If the injection cannula is still an obstacle for the objective lens to achieve its working distance, use a wire clipper to cut off the injection cannula from the head plate.", "1. Stain the Preparation with Supravital Dyes\nFor the garter snake dissection protocol see Stewart et al.5 and Teng et al.6 Reptilian tissue remains physiological for longer times, and with less bacterial contamination, when kept at low temperatures (see below). Mammalian tissue is usually maintained at room temperature or higher.\nFor lysosomal vital dye staining, dissolve the dye in cold reptilian Ringers solution 1:5,000 (0.2 \u03bcM). Incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. Wash several times with cold Ringers. Image as soon as possible.\nFor FM1-43 staining using KCl stimulation, dilute the dye in high-KCl Ringers 1:500 (7 \u03bcM). Incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 30-60 sec maximum. Wash quickly three times with cold Ringers, ~1 min/rinse. Image as soon as possible.\nFor FM1-43 staining using hypertonic (sucrose) stimulation, dilute the dye in 0.5 M sucrose Ringers as above. Incubate at 4 \u00b0C for 2-5 min. Wash as in step 1.3 above with cold Ringers. Image as soon as possible.\nFor FM1-43 staining via electrical stimulation, see Teng et al.6 Briefly, the preparation is placed a dish containing physiological saline solution and the dye. The nerve is stimulated with a preprogrammed train of 200 \u03bcsec rectangular pulses ( ~7 V, 30 Hz, 18 \u03bcsec). Wash as in step 1.3 above with cold Ringers. Image as soon as possible.\n2. Configure the Preparation for Imaging\nOrient the preparation so that structures of interest are as close as possible to the microscope objective.If an inverted microscope is used, utilize a chamber whose bottom contains a thin round cover slip. Typically, the imaging chamber should have a thin stainless steel bottom with a 25 mm diameter #1 thickness glass cover slip at the center. If an upright microscope is used, a bottom coverslip is not required but is useful to permit imaging with transmitted light (e.g. differential interference contrast, DIC) to orient the specimen and locate objects of interest.\nChoose an appropriate objective to obtain the highest possible 3D resolution. There are tradeoffs among numerical aperture (n.a.), working distance, magnification, and type of lens (dry, water- and oil-immersion). For thin preparations like tissue cultures, oil objectives are best. Using an upright microscope, float a cover slip on the aqueous bath, and use immersion oil between the top of the cover slip and the objective.\nIf deconvolution software is used, the vendor might provide predetermined point spread functions (PSFs) for certain objectives. If no such information is provided, or if an unsupported objective is chosen, determine the PSF by imaging fluorescent microdots or similar diffraction-limited objects7,8.\n3. Establish the Desired Depth of Field and Number of Images Desired per Time-lapse Frame\nSelect the total depth of field so that moving or interacting structures of interest do not disappear or go out of focus as they move in the z-direction. The z-field should slightly exceed the vertical dimension of the cell or cell process being imaged. For vertebrate motor terminals, 15-20 \u00b5m is typical.Calculate the z-axis step needed for each increment of focus. Resolution along the z-axis varies depending upon properties of the objective; it is about one-fourth of the x-y plane resolution. If either confocal imaging or deconvolution software is used, z-axis resolution is improved. Improve final resolution by deliberate oversampling in the z-direction 5, but see also step 3.3 below. A typical step interval is in the range from 400-1,500 nm for 40-100X objectives. Light should be shuttered off between each z-step image.\nSelect the number of images per z-stack, namely the desired depth of field divided by the step interval. Time to complete a typical z-stack is 1-10 sec. Fast-moving objects (100 nm/sec) can appear blurred in a 3D image stack because each image plane corresponds to a slightly different time point. Also, each additional image contributes to photobleaching and possible phototoxicity (see Discussion). If either situation pertains, choose a larger z-step to collect fewer images per stack. Compensate later using image interpolation software (step 6.3 below).\n4. Select the Time-lapse Frame Rate\nChoose by experimentation a rate that is just adequate to smoothly resolve changes with time such as movement, interactions or fusion events9. Under sampling can produce motion artifacts (sampling errors), while oversampling unnecessarily increases exposure to light. Collect either a single long sequence or several repeated sequences from the same preparation, each with a relatively small total time interval (e.g. 10 time points x 30 sec interval = 5 min). If possible, view the preparation with continuous epifluorescence illumination to roughly estimate movement velocities, including drift of the entire preparation if present.\n5. Complete All Live Imaging for a Particular Preparation\nReptilian preparations typically remain robust for ~1-2 hr, longer if cooled.\n6. Analyze Data According to Desired UseRetain all raw data files. While digital storage is usually not a problem, processing time is significant even with fast personal computers or workstations. For this reason, crop images into a region of interest [ROI]. Assure that the entire region of interest is in the cropped window during the entire time course.\nDeconvolve image stacks using appropriate software and the correct point spread function. Confirm that resolution is improved and that no artifact has been generated by the deconvolution algorithm. Figure 3 shows example images.\nUse an interpolation algorithm to expand z-axis apparent resolution. A 6X expansion from an actual 1.5 \u03bcm image plane separation to an apparent 0.25 \u03bcm separation is suggested. Alternatively, use some combination of oversampling (step 3.2) and interpolation.\nPerform contrast, brightness, noise filtering, photobleaching and other typical image processing adjustments if desired. Image manipulation standards dictate that for most scientific work, it is appropriate that the same corrections be applied to all images, both within a stack and at different time points. The consequence of a particular adjustment should be assessed among all images 9.\nSelect a particular display mode for export of data. The most straightforward display is stereo video using either red-green or red-blue anaglyphs (examples in Figure 3), stereo pairs, or alternating left/right eye frames with shutter glasses. Anaglyphs are limited to single-color. Enhance apparent image depth if desired to improve z-axis visual resolution.\nExperiment with various filtering and image enhancement techniques. For example, Laplacian filtering is useful to increase contrast of small structures above background. The brightness of pixels at the center of a running window is enhanced while brightness of surrounding areas is reduced. Note that some filtering methods do not work well in combination.Apply drift correction if there is substantial movement of the preparation over time. Such movement is common in living muscle, even with drugs added to suppress action potentials and synaptic potentials. A pixel registration algorithm (e.g. IMARIS, Adobe AfterEffects, TurboReg plugin for ImageJ) aligns time-lapse images and can reduce, but usually not completely eliminate, such motion.\nSubscription Required.

For a demonstration of an axillary and inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) dissection see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nEuthanize mouse\nFollow general euthanasia protocol (i.e., CO2 euthanasia followed by cervical dislocation.\nNote: This protocol is performed without perfusion. Any potential benefits or drawbacks of perfusion with this protocol have not been tested thoroughly at this time.\nCritical: Maintain inguinal scWAT orientation for all future steps, up to and including mounting. Most importantly, make note of whether the tissue was taken from mouse-left or mouse-right as the tissue will always curve towards the body when placed medial side up (congruent to tissue positioning during dissection, Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Additionally, the axillary end of the tissue will be wider than the posterior end. With these notes in mind, if it is known which side of the mouse the depot was excised from, it can always be returned to appropriate orientation when needed.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue dissection, related to step 2 and 3\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1364-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Excising intact subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) depots from mice\nA male C57BL/6J mouse had skin pinned back to display inguinal and axillary scWAT depots before and after excision. White dashed lines are used to accentuate tissue boundaries. Tissues were kept medial side up (as in the intact scWAT image) and directionality was maintained; anterior (A, towards head) and posterior (P, towards tail).Critical: Maintain axillary scWAT orientation for all future steps, up to and including mounting. The Axillary depot is more difficult to orientate than the inguinal depot as there are no obvious features for orientation. The most important step is to excise the tissue and place it medial side up into a well noting mouse-left or mouse-right. The axillary end of each tissue will have characteristic browning (in most cases) which can help orientate further, but this will be obscured with the addition of autofluorescence quenching stains described later.\nExcise inguinal scWAT depot.\nPlace mouse ventral side up, spray with 70% EtOH.\nMake a central incision from the base of the tail extending to the top of the sternum, being sure not to penetrate the underlying peritoneal cavity.\nGently use forceps and thumbs to pull ventral skin away from both flanks, pulling slowly with even pressure, making sure not to damage the underlying adipose tissue. The skin can be pinned back (as demonstrated in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) to better expose the adipose depots.\nIdentify the inguinal scWAT depot against the skin besides each hip (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] \u2013 boundaries of each depot). Use scissors to cut the large vasculature leading to the depot and then trace the edges of the tissue, cutting along the way.\nUse forceps to gently roll the adipose away from the skin \u2013 cutting the anchoring connective tissue as you go. Continue until the entire depot is free from the skin.\nWeigh the depot and place it into a 6-well plate with 3\u20135\u00a0mL ice-cold 2% PFA and fix at 4\u00b0C. Fix the tissue without agitation to prevent the tissue from folding onto itself during the fixation process.\n\u22640.08g ; fix for 8 h.\n>0.08g ; fix for 16\u201324 h.Note: Once tissues are adequately fixed without agitation, they are unlikely to fold during incubations performed on an orbital shaker as utilized in later steps.\nExcise axillary scWAT depot.\nIdentify axillary depot underneath both forelimbs (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nUse forceps to pull away a thin muscle layer enveloping the dorsolateral portion of each axillary depot.\nUse scissors to trace the edges of the tissue, cutting along the way.\nUse forceps to gently roll the adipose tissue away from the skin \u2013 cutting the anchoring connective tissue as you go. Continue until the entire depot is free from the skin.\nWeigh the depot and place it into a 6-well plate with 3\u20135\u00a0mL ice-cold 2% PFA to fix at 4\u00b0C. Fix the tissue without agitation.\n\u22640.08g; fix for 8 h.\n>0.08g; fix for 16\u201324 h.\nReducing tissue thickness and autofluorescence\nTiming: Z-depth reduction, 1\u00a0h 30\u00a0min; permeabilization, 12 h; autofluorescence quenching, 4 h-1\u00a0day\nAdipose tissue is notoriously difficult to image due to its size and inherent autofluorescence. In this step we will be using a combination of Z-depth reduction and various autofluorescence quenching techniques to greatly reduce tissue background autofluorescence. It should be noted that hypertrophic adipocytes, and human adipocytes, may be more prone to cell lysis on the surface of the tissue with this technique. In some instances, whole tissue imaging is not required, and instead smaller representative tissue pieces can be used. We have also outlined this alternative approach as an optional step below.\nNote: All washes and incubations are performed on an orbital shaker.\nZ-depth Reduction.Following fixation, aspirate PFA from each well of the 6-well plate and add 1\u00d7 PBS w/heparin. Wash tissues for an hour at 4\u00b0C, replacing 1\u00d7 PBS w/heparin after 30\u00a0min. Heparin is used here to help remove highly autofluorescent blood cells from the vasculature.\nPause point: The conclusion of any series of 1\u00d7 PBS washes throughout this protocol marks a good pause point if desired (e.g. washes following fixation, autofluorescence quenching, or antibody staining.) Tissues can remain in 1\u00d7 PBS for several days with no observed detriment to staining outcome. It is prudent to do antibody incubations immediately prior to imaging, for best results.\nUse forceps to take the tissue out of PBS and lay it flat onto the center of a large (75\u00a0\u00d7 51\u00a0mm) glass slide.\nUse a transfer pipette to add 2\u20133 drops of PBS onto the tissue to prevent the tissue from drying out.\nTake a second large glass slide and place it on top of the tissue; sandwiching the tissue betwixt.\nTake two large (5\u00a0cm wide) binder clips and clamp them onto the slides (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1364-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02.

Shown at two angles.\nAllow tissues to remain compressed for 1\u00a0h 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nRemove binder clips and gently separate the two slides without damaging the tissue. See Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for an example of what tissues should look like after Z-depth reduction.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1364-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Quenching scWAT autofluorescence\n(A and B) Intact axillary and inguinal scWAT depots immediately following Z-depth reduction (A) and subsequent autofluorescence quenching with typogen black (B).Optional: To entirely avoid compressing tissues, Z-depth reduction can be removed from this protocol by cutting each adipose tissue into 4\u20135 smaller pieces and following through with the remaining steps until mounting. Mount each piece of tissue onto a concave slide (0.8\u20131.9\u00a0mm deep, depending on tissue thickness). We do not recommend this alternative approach unless it is determined that tissue compression must be completely avoided. Only the most superficial structures will be visible. See Willows et\u00a0al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] for a comparison of both appropaches.\nBlocking and Permeabilization.\nOnce the slides are separated place the tissue back into a 6-well plate with 3\u20135\u00a0mL blocking buffer at 4\u00b0C for 16\u201324\u00a0h to reduce non-specific binding of antibodies.\nNote: Here, bovine serum albumin is used as the blocking agent with great effect. Alternatively, using secondary-matched sera as a blocking agent is common with many other immunostaining protocols, but has not yet been thoroughly evaluated for use with this protocol.\nNote: For larger tissues (>0.30 g) extend the blocking & permeabilization period to 3\u00a0days. Exchange fresh blocking buffer daily.\nAutofluorescence Quenching.\nThere are four approaches (used separately) that can be taken to mitigate tissue autofluorescence, each with their own pros and cons summarized here and in greater detail in Willows et\u00a0al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nOption 1 \u2013 typogen black: Incubate tissues in 0.1% typogen black for 20\u00a0min at \u223c20\u00b0C followed by washing the tissue in 1\u00d7 PBS for 4\u00a0h at \u223c20\u00b0C , replacing PBS every 1 h. See Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for an example of what tissues should look like after incubation in typogen black.\nPro \u2013 a good balance between blocking autofluorescence and maintaining fluorophore signal intensity.\nCon \u2013 typogen black staining fluoresces with far-red (647\u00a0nm) excitation.Option 2 \u2013 TrueBlack: incubate tissues in 1\u00d7 (0.1%) TrueBlack\u00ae Lipofuscin Autofluorescence Quencher for 10\u00a0min at \u223c20\u00b0C followed by washing the tissue in 1\u00d7 PBS for 4\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C, replacing PBS every 1 h.\nPro \u2013 does not fluoresce in far-red wavelength.\nCon \u2013 can diminish endogenous and immuno-fluorescence intensity by overly masking areas in black haze. This can hide low-intensity structures such as small neurites.\nOption 3 \u2013 H2O2 Bleaching: stepwise dehydration in MeOH diluted in 1\u00d7 PBS (50% MeOH, 1 h; 80% MeOH, 1 h; 100% MeOH, 2 h, replaced fresh after 1 h) at \u223c20\u00b0C Bleach in 5% H2O2 in 20% DMSO/MeOH (recipe in materials and equipment) for 16\u201324\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. This is then followed by rehydration (100% MeOH, 2 h, replaced fresh after 1 h; 20% DMSO/MeOH (recipe in materials and equipment), 1 h; 80% MeOH, 1 h; 50% MeOH, 1 h; 1\u00d7 PBS, 2 h, replaced fresh after 1 h) at \u223c20\u00b0C. Adapted from Renier et\u00a0al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nPro \u2013 reduces autofluorescence without affecting fluorophore intensity.\nCon \u2013 de/rehydration steps add several hours, and bleaching adds an additional day to the protocol. MeOH preparation has been demonstrated not to be compatible with some antibodies as it can denature epitopes (Renier et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) and should be tested and validated on a case by case basis.\nOption 4 \u2013 Room Temperature: doing all future steps at \u223c20\u00b0C (even when recommended at 4\u00b0C) will reduce tissue autofluorescence, but only slightly.\nPro \u2013 shortens protocol by at least 4\u00a0h while still offering some level of autofluorescence reduction.\nCon \u2013 the least effective means of reducing autofluorescence and performing all future steps at \u223c20\u00b0C can result in increased non-specific binding of antibodies.Optional: Washes following autofluorescence quenching techniques can be performed in 1\u00d7 PBS w/ heparin to further reduce vascular autofluorescence. Additionally, sodium azide can be added to PBS at a concentration of 0.02% for all future washes to prevent microbial growth.\nCritical: The addition of non-ionic detergents (Triton X-100, Tween 20) into wash buffers is common to many immunostaining protocols, but if using typogen black or TrueBlack autofluorescence quenching, avoid the addition of these detergents as they can wash out these stains from the tissue, greatly reducing their quenching potential. The use of detergents has not been tested with the other quenching techniques.\nFluorescent labeling\nTiming: 1\u20137\u00a0days\nThe following steps outline how to fluorescently label Z-depth reduced adipose tissues or tissue blocks with primary antibodies, secondary antibodies, isolectin-IB4, and DAPI. It is important that, to reduce non-specific binding and cross reactivity, co-staining follows the order outlined below.\nNote: All washes and incubations are performed on an orbital shaker.\nUsing a Direct Reporter with Endogenous Fluorescence\nFor mouse reporters with high signal intensity you can proceed directly to step 12 or if co-labeling is desired, proceed to step 8.\nFor mouse reporters with low signal intensity it is recommended to boost the endogenous signal with a fluorophore conjugated antibody raised against the fluorescent protein of interest (i.e., anti-GFP conjugated Alexa488). This should be conducted immediately after step 9 is completed.\nPrimary Antibodies.To make primary antibody solution, you will dilute desired primary antibody in 1\u00d7 PBS. Dilutions are antibody specific but typically range from 1:100 to 1:500. For antibodies not validated in this protocol, we recommend performing an antibody titration to find what works best. When titrating antibodies for this protocol, it is best to start with what works well for thin sections as this can provide decent enough staining. However, concentrating this further by two-fold typically results in the best outcomes. Concentrations for antibodies that we have validated with this protocol can be found in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nCritical: Non-ionic detergents are commonly added to antibody solutions to increase antibody permeation and reduce non-specific binding, however, as mentioned previously, detergents can reduce the effectiveness of typogen black and TrueBlack, and has not been tested with the other quenching techniques.\nYou will need 3\u20135\u00a0mL of antibody solution per tissue, 3\u00a0mL being the absolute minimum if using a 6-well plate (see \u201ctroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\u201d.)\nIncubate tissues in primary antibody solution for 2\u00a0days at 4\u00b0C.\nAfter incubation, wash tissues in 1\u00d7 PBS for 4\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C, replacing PBS every 1 h.\nNote: Perform sequential staining of antibodies when co-staining.\nNote: Only validated antibodies, tested in a Western Blot for specificity, and ideally with knock-out tissues and proper tissue controls, should be used for this procedure.\nSecondary Antibodies\nIf not using a directly conjugated primary antibody, dilute the desired secondary antibody in 1\u00d7 PBS. Again, dilutions will be antibody and fluorophore specific, and should be optimized by titration. Secondary antibody concentrations tend to be identical to that used for immunostaining thin sections as recommended by the vendor. Only Alexa Fluor conjugated antibodies have been validated for this protocol. See validated secondary antibody concentrations in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].Incubate tissues in secondary antibody solution for 16\u201324\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nAfter, wash tissues in 1\u00d7 PBS for 4\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C, replacing PBS every 1 h.\nIf co-staining with additional primary antibodies go back to step 8. If not, continue to step 10.\nCritical: We recommend avoiding the use of anti-mouse secondary antibodies. In most cases, non-specific binding has been unavoidable even with mouse-on-mouse blocking solutions. We recommend using antibodies raised in mice that are directly conjugated to a fluorophore, or preferably, using primary antibodies raised in alternative species such as rabbits.\nIsolectin-IB4 Vascular Staining\nIf desired, label tissue vasculature using an Isolectin GS-IB4 Alexa Fluor conjugate. See validated conjugates in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nStart by making Isolectin-IB4 working solution. This can be made up in advance and frozen until time of use. Recipe described in materials and equipment.\nAllow Isolectin-IB4 working solution to warm to \u223c20\u00b0C if not already. Add 3\u20135\u00a0mL to each tissue and incubate 16\u201324\u00a0h at \u223c20\u00b0C.\nWash tissues in 1\u00d7 PBS for 2\u00a0h at \u223c20\u00b0C, replacing PBS every 1 h.\nOptional: 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Isolectin-IB4 working solution can be further diluted to 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to save on reagents with only a slight decrease in fluorescence intensity.\nDAPI Nuclear Staining\nIf nuclear labeling is desired, start by making DAPI working solution from stock (described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]), to be used fresh.\nIncubate tissues in 3\u20135\u00a0mL DAPI working solution for 1\u00a0h at \u223c20\u00b0C.\nWash in 1\u00d7 PBS for 2\u00a0h at \u223c20\u00b0C, replacing PBS after 1 h.\nMounting tissues\nTiming: 3\u00a0days\nA benefit of our protocol is the ability to permanently mount entire subcutaneous adipose tissues onto glass slides. Below we outline the steps for mounting.\nMounting tissues.Label the top of a large glass slide with mouse and tissue identifying information.\nRemove tissue from 6-well plate and place it at the center of the large glass slide.\nAdd a generous amount (4\u20136 drops) of glycerol based mounting fluid to the tissue and place a large (48\u00a0\u00d7 60\u00a0mm) glass coverslip over the tissue.\nNote: Glycerol-based mountants are more compatible with lipid laden tissue, and the added viscosity aids in adhering the coverslip to the slide. Incomplete coverslip adherence will result in tissues drying out, tissue oxidation, and decreased fluorophore lifespan.\nApply gentle pressure to the coverslip to help it adhere to the tissue and slide. This is required for the next step to prevent the coverslip from sliding off the tissue.\nPlace the coverslipped slides underneath uniform weight (15\u201320\u00a0kg) for 3\u00a0days. Ten textbooks placed over a series of slides works very well.\nAfter 3\u00a0days, remove the slide from underneath the textbooks and seal the edges with nail polish (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1364-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Mounting whole scWAT onto glass slides\nWhole axillary and inguinal scWAT depots were fully mounted and sealed following immunostaining. Anatomical orientation was maintained by placing the tissues medial side up with the anterior portion of the tissue closest to the label.\nLet dry for 5\u00a0min and proceed to imaging.\nNote: For best outcome we recommend imaging within a week after mounting is complete. However, tissues are typically viable for imaging up to several weeks after mounting, and in some cases even several months.\nImaging\nTiming: 1\u00a0min-40 h\nUnique to this tissue processing approach is the ability to image whole adipose tissues effectively on standard widefield epifluorescence microscopes as well as confocal microscopes. Below are descriptions for best utilizing both methods of imaging.\nWidefield Epifluorescence Microscopy\nApplication:Suitable for single channel imaging, most qualitative analysis, and answering \u2018yes or no\u2019 questions through representative images. Fast time to image with only minutes needed to set up and capture several images.\nMagnifications:\nImages of adipose tissue can be captured on widefield microscopes easily using up to 40\u00d7 objectives. Higher magnifications are possible but the associated decrease in working distance will make it a challenge to capture an in-focus image of large tissues.\nExtended Depth of Field (EDF):\nAfter Z-depth reduction, tissue thickness will still range 40\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcm. It can be difficult to capture images with the entire field of view in focus. A widefield microscope equipped with software capable of EDF can generate images with more of the field of view in focus. However, if EDF is pushed passed reasonable limits it can create artefact in your image.\nBackground Autofluorescence:\nEven with autofluorescence quenching, background will still be present on epifluorescence microscopes (see \u201ctroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\u201d). Strong staining and bright fluorophores can help overcome this, but confocal microscopy will further help to reduce background.\nConfocal Microscopy\nApplication:\nSuitable for quantification, demonstrating colocalization, and generating 3D images of specific regions or entire tissues to capture total neurovascular structure.\nMagnifications:\nConfocal microscopy is capable of imaging whole adipose tissues with up to 63\u00d7 objectives without difficulty \u2013 further increased with confocal zoom. We have not tried higher objective magnifications at this time.\nTiled Z-stacks:Entire adipose depots can be imaged in a series of Z-stacks extending through the entire tissue thickness. These can be tiled together to create one large 3D image. These can then be maximum intensity projected to create a 2D representation of the 3D data. These tiled z-stacks of whole tissues can be very time consuming to capture; taking anywhere from 8 to 40\u00a0h depending on the size of the tissue, number of fluorophores being captured, and the desired XY and Z resolutions.", "Three month old female New Zealand rabbits weighing 2.5 \u2013 3.5 kg were used for this procedure. The study was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals and with the approval of the Animal Care Committee of the Canton of Bern, Switzerland (approval #105/13). All surgical procedures were performed under sterile conditions at the Experimental Surgical Institute of the Department of Clinical Research at Bern University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. A veterinary anesthesiologist monitored the animals during surgery and throughout recovery.\n1. Animal Preparation, Positioning and Subclavian Artery Cannulation\nInduce general anesthesia in the rabbit with intramuscular injection of ketamine (30 mg/kg; Ketalar, 50 mg/ml) and xylazine (6 mg/kg; Xylapan 20 mg/ml) and control depth of anesthesia by checking the rabbit\u2019s response to noxious stimulation (e.g., toe pinch). See 1.7 in case of positive response.\nPull down the lower lids of both eyes and apply a small amount of ointment to the eyelids to prevent dryness and further irritation.\nCatheterize the lateral ear vein with a 20 Gbutterfly venflon (20 G vascular catheter), fix with adhesive tape, and connect to a gravity bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride (500 ml/24 hr) and ketamine (40 mg/kg/hr) / xylazine (4 mg/kg/hr) for continuous intravenous (i.v.) anesthesia. Administer additional analgesics every 15 min i.v. (Fentanyl, 1 mcg/kg). Note: Avoid volatile gas anesthetics, which is associated with decreased CPP, increasing CBF, and decreasing cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen.11 Intravenous anesthetics provide more ideal characteristics for neuroanesthesia by preserving CBF and cerebral vasoconstriction,12 which is of uppermost importance when studying cerebral vasospasm. In addition, although mortality is increased in spontaneously breathing animals, it may better mimic the human situation of acute SAH.Provide oxygen (1 - 2 L/min) via a respiratory mask that allows end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring.\nInstall a 3 channel electrocardiogram (ECG).Place three subcutaneous electrodes in a triangular arrangement on the ventral side of the rabbit; specifically, place one electrode over the right midthoracic region (with distance to the sterile shaved field for the subclavian artery cannulation) and two electrodes in the lower abdomen distributed over both limbs.\nMonitor the depth of anesthesia every 15 min during surgery by following respiratory rate, heart rate (HR) monitored from the ECG signal, and reaction to noxious stimulation.\nIn case of positive response to noxious stimulation (toe pinch), adapt the depth of anesthesia by ketamine bolus (6 mg/kg) i.v. and xylazine bolus (0.05 mg/kg) i.v. and/or an additional analgesia bolus with Fentanyl (1 mcg/kg) i.v.\nFix the rabbit in a supine position on a body warming plate, tilting the head 20\u00b0 down and turning it slightly contralaterally to the side on which the subclavian artery will be exposed.\napply eye ointment and prepare the area for surgery by shaving the hair over the right pectoral muscle around the middle third of the clavicle, and over the frontal-, parietal- and occipital skull, the neck, and over the right common femoral artery.\nDisinfect the skin for 3 min with a broad spectrum antiseptic, e.g., Povidone-iodine.\nCover the rabbit with sterile sheets. Perform all further procedures under sterile conditions and frequently apply 4% papaverin HCl and antibiotic solution (neomycin sulfate 5 mg/ml) topically to prevent arterial vasospasm by vessel manipulation and local infections.Infiltrate the pectoral muscle with local anesthetics (Lidocaine 1% maximal 6 mg/kg). Make a parasternal skin incision and prepare the pectoral muscle. Using the microscope, dissect the subclavian artery and secure with a proximal and distal ligature (4-0 polyfilament sutures) around the exposed end. Keep one ligature close to the proximal control in place to secure the catheter and ligate the vessel distally.\nPerform an arteriotomy in the wall of the subclavian artery by incising the artery with a curved microscissor and cannulate the subclavian artery retrogradely with a small intravasal 3-way stopcock. Secure the catheter by double knot ligature towards the distal ligature in order to prevent arterial twisting or bending of the proximal part of the artery and to avoid slippage or massive bleeding.\n2. Blood Pressure and Arterial Blood Gas Monitoring\nConnect the 3-way stop cock to i) the intravasal cannula for arterial blood gas (ABG) analyses, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, bicarbonate, base excess, and SO2, ii) the invasive arterial blood pressure measurement device, and iii) the shunt device.\nCollect blood samples for ABG status (PaCO2, PaO2) and continuously monitor standard cardiovascular and respiratory parameters (blood pressure, HR, ECG, respiratory rate and end-tidal CO2) and transfer data via the analog output interface to an analog\u2013digital converter/data logger and store.\n\tNOTE: The pressures will be zeroed at heart levels before and after each session, and pressure calibration of the analog/digital-converter and data-logging system will be done once before the series starts.\n3. Baseline Digital Subtraction Angiography\nPlace an external sizing device (small sphere) over both mandible angles in order to calibrate the angiogram.\n\tNOTE: This allows exact comparison of post hoc measurements of baseline and follow up vessel diameter.Perform digital subtraction angiography (DSA) by retrograde intra-arterial bolus injection of non-ionic Iopamidol (0.6 ml/kg, 5 ml/sec for 2 sec) through the cannulated artery and flush the cannula immediately after bolus injection with saline in order to prevent occlusion of the latter.\nObtain images (7 images in 14 sec) of the vertebrobasilar system using a rapid sequential angiography recording in a 5\u00b0 left-anterior oblique position.\nInfiltrate the area around the right common femoral artery with local anesthetics (Lidocaine 1%, maximal 6 mg/kg). Make a small inguinal skin incision. Using the microscope for visualization, dissect the common femoral artery and secure with a proximal and distal ligature (4-0 polyfilament sutures) around the exposed end.\nAfter arteriotomy, cannulate the femoral artery with a 5-F sheath. Flush the side port of the sheath with saline.\nAdvance a 5-F catheter into the brachiocephalic artery through the sheath under fluoroscopy. Create a road map, then advance a guide wire to the vertebrobasilar system. Inject a bolus of non-ionic Iopamidol (0.6 ml/kg, 5 ml/sec in 2 sec) for DSA as described in step 3.2.\n4. Rotation to Prone Position\nFollowing baseline DSA, reposition the rabbit from supine to prone position. Be careful not to manipulate or relocate the position of the intra-arterial catheters.\nPosition the head in a head-holder at a 30\u00b0 angle, oriented head down.\n5. Cisterna Magna Puncture\nDisinfect the skin over the head and neck with Povidone-iodine 3 times for 1 min each, and cover the surgical area with sterile sheets.\nInsert a 22 G x 40 mm pediatric spinal access needle transcutaneously into the cisterna magna without any prior skin incision or muscle displacement.Confirm that the animal is fully anesthetized by ensuring a lack of toe-pinch response before sliding the needle down along the bony external occipital protuberance until a gap is detected; do not push the needle any further.\nConfirm the correct positioning of the needle by observing spontaneous dripping of cerebrospinal fluid with the rabbit\u2019s head tilted down at a 20\u00b0 angle for a few min.\n6. Installation of Intracranial Pressure and Cerebral Blood Flow Monitoring\nAfter midline skin and galea incision, insert a small surgical retractor.\nMake three round osteotomies (2 mm diameter) using a high-speed microdrill in the frontal part of the skull according to the outer skull landmarks (Figure 1)9, i.e., over the olfactory bulb and bilateral frontal for placement of a neuromonitoring device if necessary. Use a millimeter scale ruler to determine the coordinates for burr hole placement as follows: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in the midpupillary line, one to two mm from the midsagittal line; intraparenchymal laser-Doppler probes four to five mm anterior and lateral to the bregma (Figure 1).\nVisualize the dura, and perform meticulous hemostasis: use bone wax for bone hemostasis by virtue of its tamponade action and perform local hemostasis using bipolar coagulation of the dura.\nPlace the intraparenchymal intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor tip into the right olfactory bulb to a depth of 2 mm and then calibrate.\nPlace the two laser-Doppler flowmetry fine needle probes using an external clamp system and insert them into the corresponding burr holes in both the right and left frontal hemispheres lateral to the ventricular system, i.e., in the midline to avoid interference with cerebrospinal fluid. Place needle probes to a depth of 2.5 mm.After placement of the neuromonitoring probes, seal all burr holes with a thick plug of bone wax in order to keep the cranium fluid-tight.\nMeasure baseline parameters of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), ICP and cerebral blood flow (CBF)using a multiparameter monitor and four channel laser-Doppler tissue blood perfusion monitor.\n7. Shunt Induction\nConnect the spinal access needle in the cisterna magna to the previously catheterized subclavian artery via blood-filled pressure monitoring tubing. Use the 3-way stopcock for blood pressure measurement and as blood sampling port.\n\tNOTE: The severity of SAH depends on the amount of blood, and can be roughly estimated by the extensiveness of subarachnoid clots at the time of brain harvest5,11.\nContinuously monitor MAP, HR, ECG, respiratory rate and end-tidal CO2 at a sampling rate of 1 Hz from 6 min before until at least 20 min after SAH.\nConfirm that the animal is fully anesthetized by ensuring a lack of toe pinch response before opening the shunt connection between the subclavian artery and the cisterna magna to induce SAH by the pressure gradient.\n\tNOTE: A controlled SAH can be achieved by closing the shunt at any time point (e.g., at a desired level of ICP).\nRecord steady state values during a time period of approximately 15 min.\nAfter ICP reaches its peak, keep the spinal access needle in place until ICP returns to a steady state close to baseline values. If the ICP plateau is maintained for more than 10 sec or if ICP decreases spontaneously, close the shunt.\nRemove CBF fine-needle probes and ICP probe, plug burr holes with bone wax, remove all catheters (including subclavian catheter, since catheter manipulation with consecutive bleeding is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and increases infection rate), perform rigorous wound irrigation with Neomycin sulfate and suture the skin.8. Postoperative Management\nThe procedure lasts for about 2 hr. Due to the half-lives of ketamine and xylazine, the recovery time of the animal is quite short -- approximately 1 hr. The animals are kept under a heating lamp during recovery. Additional fluids are not provided. During this initial postoperative recovery phase, apply buprenorphine 0.02 mg/kg s.c. every 8 hr for 24 hr.\nApply transdermal fentanyl matrix patches releasing 12.5 \u03bcg/hr in the shaved neck region of the animals for effective analgesia over the next 72 hr.\nDo not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nDo not return an animal that has undergone surgery in the company of other animals until fully recovered.\n9. Follow up Digital Subtraction Angiography to Assess DCVS at Day 3\nPerform Steps 1.1 to 3.6 as described above.\nEuthanize the animals by intraarterial bolus injection of sodium thiopenthal (40 mg/kg) (Pentothal, Ospedalia AG, H\u00fcnenberg, Switzerland). In cases where histology and immunohistochemistry is needed, perform an intracardiac perfusion-fixation at RT at a perfusion pressure of 100 cm H2O.\nSubscription Required.

The nervous system develops from the anterior epiblast, a pluripotent epithelium overlaying the endoderm, and is in contact with a lumen -the amnion. Neural development is triggered by a combination of NODAL and BMP signaling from surrounding tissues<sup>7,8</sup>. Inspired by these events, we used micropatterning of stem cells<sup>9\u201311</sup>&nbsp;to create a pluripotent epithelium with controlled and reproducible dimensions (Fig. 1, Day 1). We than used low concentration Matrigel to drive robust folding into a 3D epithelium containing a single lumen. (Fig. 1, Day 3). Finally, we exposed the culture to TGF\u03b2 inhibition and BMP. The precisely controlled initial and boundary conditions of the sample triggered robust pattern formation and folding morphogenesis (Fig. 1, Day 7). In the following sections we describe in details the steps of the protocol. Key steps include microfabrication of PDMS stamps (4hrs), micropatterning of glass-bottom dishes (2hrs), stem-cell seeding (2hrs), lumen formation and differentiation protocol (9 days).

In previous publications<sup>12</sup>, a PDMS stencil is incubated in a bath of ECM protein, and then brought into contact with a glass surface for a short period of time. Then the microprinted surface is coated with PLL-PEG to passivate the glass surface outside the ECM printed regions. Our approach is slightly modified. We first apply PLL-PEG to passivate the surface, while protecting regions of interest using a PDMS stencil (Fig. 2). Then in a second step we expose the entire surface to ECM proteins and those assemble in the areas previously protected by the PDMS stencil.In our hands this approach has been more robust than contact-printing of the ECM protein.</p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drill 20mm hole in the bottom of 35mm petri dish.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean glass coverslip and 35mm dish using ethanol.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply a small amount of NOA-81 to dish bottom.

For this purpose we apply Matrigel, which has been previously used to generate lumens from small hPSC colonies<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;and in brain organoids<sup>2</sup>. We find that exposure of 2D hPSC cultures to low percentage Matrigel results in robust lumen formation. This occurs through folding of the 2D hPSC culture, and maintains the epithelial structure of the culture. Thus, the initial epithelial state of the culture is essential for the formation of a single lumen. This is in contrast to Matrigel embedding of brain organoids<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;in which the cell aggregate lacks epithelial organization prior to Matrigel exposure, and exposure to Matrigel results in the formation of multiple lumens.Another key point is the media in which Matrigel is diluted. Here we describe addition of Matrigel diluted in neural induction media, which is optimized for the neural tube morphogenesis protocol. However, to maintain the pluripotency of the culture during the transition to 3D, one should dilute Matrigel in mTESR. This allows further differentiation into mesendoderm cell types.</p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare neural induction media (N2).

The approach is based on exposure to BMP4, which is known to pattern the ectoderm into neural and non-neural domains in a concentration dependent manner<sup>8</sup>. A similar approach has been used in 2D stem cell cultures to drive pattern formation, however folding morphogenesis was not observed<sup>9\u201311</sup>. Thus, the presence of a 3D stem cell culture, and a lumen, are essential for folding morphogenesis. The timing of BMP addition is critical, and we find that a minimal neural induction period of three days is required before adding BMP.Adding BMP earlier than that results in mesendoderm fates and does not lead to folding morphogenesis.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media change (Day 4).</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check for lumen formation in brightfield.

BALB/c mice served as heart donors and C57BL/6J as transplant recipients. Mice were aged 8-12 weeks, weighed~30 g at transplantation and were housed under standard conditions.\n1. Preparatory steps\nFor anesthesia, give mice inhalative isoflurane (2%) until they fall asleep, followed by intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (100 mg/kg) + xylazine (10 mg/kg) + acepromazine (2 mg/kg). For postoperative analgesia, apply Metamizol (200 mg/kg) p.o. and Carprofen (5 mg/kg) s.c..\n\tNOTE: The application of antibiotics was abstained on purpose as these substances may influence immunological responses.\nFor surgery, use a set of microscopic instruments including a micro-scissor, micro-forceps, a needle holder and micro hemostatic clamps. An electrosurgical pen is also necessary. Perform sutures using 7/0er, 10/0er and\u00a04/0er nylon types.\nPlace the mouse in a box for isoflurane inhalation (2%) for 40-60 seconds. Determine the depth of anesthesia by squeezing the paw with tweezers. If there is a complete lack of response for this stimulus, go to the next step.\nOnce the mouse has fallen asleep, weigh the mouse.\nApply an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) + xylazine (10 mg/kg) + acepromazine (2 mg/kg) to the anesthetized mouse.\nClip the abdominal fur and place the mouse on the operation table. Perform disinfection using povidone iodide for 3 times, then properly drape the mouse using a fenestrated surgical towel.\n2. Donor operation procedure\nUse scissors to cut the skin from the neck to the lower abdomen, and peel off the full layer of the skin to the midline of both axillae.Use scissors to cut the muscles of the abdominal wall and gently move the viscera to the left (from the operator's view). Wrap away the viscera with a saline imbibed gauze to safely expose the inferior vena cava.\nUse a 1 mL syringe to inject 0.4 mL of the heparin solution (contains 500 U heparin) slowly into the lower vena cava and wait for 1 minute before pulling out the needle.\nPull out the needle and use a micro-scissor to cut both the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta\u00a0to accelerate exsanguination.\nUse scissors to open the chest cavity by performing a u-shaped cut; completely expose the heart, lungs and all chest blood vessels.\n\t\nExpose the thoracic aorta, cut 1/2 of the lumen, and then cut the pulmonary vein to facilitate irrigation and drainage.\nInsert an irrigation tube into the opening of the thoracic aorta, inject at least 2 mL of 4 \u00b0C cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate cardioplegia solution (Custodiol HTK solution)9 until the pulmonary vein outflow is completely clear and the heart completely stops beating.\nPull out the irrigation tube and detach the sternum.\nUse micro scissors to remove the thymus and to slightly strip the fat around the aortic arch.\nUse straight and curved forceps to expose and ligate the trunk of the arteria pulmonalis (on the right side of the aortic arch) with a 10/0 suture.\nUse micro forceps to separate the fat and connective tissue attached to the IIVC, expose and ligate the superior vena cava (on the left side of the aortic arch) with a 7/0 suture and use micro scissors to cut it behind the ligation.\nMake a 7/0 suture around the base of the heart underneath the aortic arch, the IIVC, and both auricles. Then ligate the pulmonary artery branches and venous lung vessels.Use micro scissors to transect the aortic arch as distal as possible, the lung vessels underneath the ligature and the IIVC near the diaphragm. Remove the heart out of the chest.\nPlace the explanted donor's heart into 4 \u00b0C cold HTK cardioplegia solution and preserve temporarily.\n3. Recipient operation procedure\nNOTE: The initial operation steps are similar to those previously shown for the donor mouse, including anesthesia and disinfection.\nPerform the abdominal skin cut in a transverse manner, cover the abdominal organs with a wet gauze using saline solution.\nUse micro forceps to expose the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta and free them from surrounding fat tissue.\nUse micro forceps to ligate or electrocauterize side branch vessels (lateral or under the vein/aorta) below the renal vessels.\nUse clip applicator forceps to position two micro hemostatic clamps at the abdominal part of vein/aorta coming from the right leaving more than 1 cm distance for both aorta/vein to ensure space for the construction of the anastomosis in between them.\nUse micro scissors to make an incision into the aorta a little nearer to the lower clamp than to the upper clamp. Alternatively, use a 30 G needle to make a small hole and open it up with micro scissors.\nPosition the recipient mouse so that the aorta is facing the operator with the vena cava on the other side. Then place the heart into the abdominal cavity and cover it with a small wet gauze pad.Use a 10/0 suture to adapt and stitch the donor aorta to the recipient aorta starting caudally, make a knot and proceed with a running suture to the top of the incision (about 4-5 stitches). Next, flip the heart over to the right (from the subject's view), cover it again and continue the suture on the left side until reaching the caudal end and knot it.\nUse an irrigation tube to inject at least 0.5 mL of 4 \u00b0C HTK cardioplegia solution to flush the donor's IIVC.\nUse micro-scissors to cut a round hole on the abdominal inferior vena cava of the recipient, which should have the same size of the donors IIVC lumen. The incision should be located above the aortic anastomotic opening. Make the vein incision larger than the aortic incision.\nUse a 10/0 suture to sew the donor IIVC to the recipient vena cava starting caudally. Tie a knot and perform a running suture until the top of the incision is reached. Use five stitches and continue the suture on the left. Finally, tie a knot in the tail corner, and carefully tighten (be careful not to pull too tight).\nPlace the small parts of the hemostatic sponge around the vein and aortic anastomoses.\nUse clip applicator forceps to remove first the lower and then the upper micro-hemostatic clamps and rinse the abdominal cavity with 38.0\u00b0C tempered 0.9% sodium chloride.\nUse micro forceps to take away the hemostatic sponge.\nObserve the heartbeat of the transplanted heart.\nUse forceps to put the intestines back into the abdominal cavity and two-layer sutures (abdominal muscles followed by skin) to close the abdominal wound with a 4/0 suture.Put the mice into an oxygen and temperature control workstation chamber (e.g., INVIVO2-400) to provide a warm and oxygen rich environment for the transplanted mice to recover, wait for the mice to wake up.\nFor postoperative analgesia, directly give Metamizol 200 mg/kg per os after operation. Four and 16 hours after operation give Metamizol 200 mg/kg per os+ Carprofen (5mg/kg) s.c. In the further followup, give Carprofen (5 mg/kg) s.c to the transplanted mice every 24 hours for three consecutive days after operation.\nSubscription Required.

All animal protocols were approved by the responsible local authority (\"Amt f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz, Hansestadt (Office for Health and Consumer Protection) Hamburg\").\n1. Animal Care\nObtain Lewis rats (LEW/Crl) rats and ROSA/luciferase-LEW transgenic rats weighing 300-350 g from the Institute of Laboratory Animals.\nKeep the rats under conventional conditions in ventilated cabinets and feed them standard rat chow and autoclaved water ad libitum.\nPerform a graft transplantation using the ROSA/luciferase-LEW transgenic rats as the donors and the syngenic LEW/Crl rats as the recipients.\n2. Preparation of the Donor Rat\nUse an induction chamber to anaesthetize a rat with isoflurane (2.5-3%).\nPlace the rat on its back and maintain the anesthesia with a facemask covering the mouth and nose. Check for sufficient depth of anesthesia by pinching the hind feet and verifying the absence of reflexes. Apply some vet ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\u00a0 \u00a0\nSpread the hind legs and fix their position using tape.\nShave the inguinal hair with a hair trimmer and disinfect the entire area using povidone-iodine followed by 80% ethanol. Repeat the disinfection step twice.\n\tNOTE: The surgical area, gauze, and surgical instruments should be sterilized. Maintain a sterile field throughout the procedure and wear single-use, sterile surgical gloves, masks, and caps.\nUnder a microscope, perform a vertical incision along the linea inguinalis. Use two forceps to gently separate the subcutaneous tissues and expose the superficial epigastric vein from its origin on the femoral vein. Carefully isolate the superficial epigastric vein from the surrounding tissues.\nStop blood flow in the superficial epigastric vein using two micro clamps.Harvest an approximately 0.5\u00a0to 1\u00a0cm segment of the vein by carefully lifting the isolated vein with forceps and cutting through the vessel with microscissors. Leave the micro clamps on the vessel stump to prevent the loss of blood. Place the removed piece of vein on sterile gauze. Carefully place a 30 G\u00a0needle inside one end of the harvested vein and flush the vessel with heparin (50 units/ml).\n\tNOTE: Handle the vein with care and avoid damage during lifting, cutting, and flushing. Make sure to flush the graft with the proper amount of heparin.\nKeep the vessel segment in 1% lidocaine on ice until transplantation into the recipient rat to prevent a vessel spasm.\nEuthanize the donor rat by increasing the anesthesia to 5% isoflurane. After 2-3 min, open the abdomen along the linea alba, cut through the diaphragm, and remove the heart to stop circulation.\n3. Preparation of the Recipient Rat\nAnesthetize and fix the recipient rat in the same way as the donor rat.\nShave the medial side of the legs with a hair trimmer and disinfect three times using povidone-iodine and 80% ethanol. \u00a0\nMonitor the depth of anesthesia and ensure that it is sufficient by verifying the absence of reflexes when pinching the hind feet.\nPerform a median femoral incision from the knee to the inguinal fold. Under a microscope, use 2 forceps to separate the femoral artery from its surroundings.\nUse micro clamps to stop the flow of blood. Place the proximal clamp first, followed by the distal clamp.\nCut out a short segment of the clamped femoral artery with microscissors and discard it. Shorten the remaining arterial stump with microscissors, creating a gap that is 1-2 mm larger than the vein graft. Flush the arterial stump with heparin using a 30 G\u00a0needle.NOTE: If the adventitia protrudes slightly beyond the vessel stump, use forceps to pull it slightly over the end of the vessel and remove a piece.\nPlace the harvested vein from step 2.8 between the arterial stumps and adjust the length so that it fits suitably into the gap. Note the direction of the vein.\nPerform the proximal anastomosis first using a 10-0 prolene suture. Conduct single stitches in the order shown (Figure 1D). Start with a suture on each lateral side before adding three more sutures on the ventral side. Afterwards, place three stitches on the dorsal side of the vessel to complete the anastomosis. \u00a0\nConnect the distal vessels with the graft using the same technique as for the proximal anastomosis described in step 3.8. Again, start with a suture on each lateral side, and then place three sutures on the ventral side and the dorsal side.\nLoad two 1-mL syringes with fibrin glue component 1 and 2. Carefully lift the graft with forceps and drop approximately 100 \u03bcl\u00a0of fibrin glue component 1 under the graft, followed by component 2.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that components 1 and 2 are applied in a 1:1 ratio.\nPlace the graft back in its position and drop an additional 100 \u03bcl of components 1 and 2 on top of the graft. Be sure that the glue covers both the graft and the anastomosis in order to prevent anastomotic insufficiency and over-distension of the vein graft. \u00a0\nCarefully open the distal clamp, followed by the proximal.\nConfirm a successful surgery by checking for a visible pulse in the transplanted vein and distal artery of the graft.\nRemove excessive glue, which impedes skin closure. Use forceps to lift the cured glue and remove the excess with microscissors. Close the skin layers with 5-0 prolene sutures.Inject 4-5 mg/kg Carprofen subcutaneously before allowing the rat to wake up. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Keep the animal in a single cage until it is fully recovered.\nAdd Metamizole to the drinking water (50 mg Metamizole per 100 ml) as pain medication for the following 3 days and monitor the animal daily. \u00a0\n4. Duplex Sonography\nNOTE: Use duxplex sonography to visualize blood flow non-invasively in rats14.\nAnaesthetize a rat in an induction chamber (isoflurane 2%). Place the rat on its back and maintain anesthesia with a facemask covering the nose.\nUse hair clippers and hair removal cream to remove the hair around the area of the thigh.\nApply ultrasound gel to the thigh. Make sure that there are no air bubbles. Acquire duplex sonography images using an MS 400 transducer (center frequency: 30 MHz) with a frame rate of 230-400 frames/sec. \u00a0\n5. Histopathology\nNOTE: Harvest and stain the vessel with Masson\u2019s trichrome staining for morphometric analysis15.\nFix the harvested vessel in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and dehydrate it in increasing concentrations of ethanol.\u00a0 Embed the sample in paraffin and cut it into 5 \u03bcm\u00a0thick slices using a microtome.\n\tNOTE: Paraformaldehyde is toxic and should be handled with special care.\nDeparaffinize the slides before staining them with trichrome staining solution. Dehydrate the stained slides, clear them with xylene, and mount them in mounting medium. After drying the slides, view the samples with a microscope.\u00a0 \u00a0\n6. Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI)\nNOTE: The postoperative graft was tracked over time in vivo by measuring bioluminescent signal16.\nDissolve 1 g of D-Luciferin potassium salt in 22 ml of PBS and inject it intraperitoneally into the rat (375 mg/kg body weight). Wait 15 min for the luciferin to circulate in the animal.Place the rat into a real-time bioluminescent quantification system and access the bioluminescence signal.\nSubscription Required.

Once validated for tissue of interest (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) frozen samples can also be used.\nCollect fresh tissue samples from the pTU or LM from the OR in D-PBS.\nCut 3\u00a0\u00d7 3\u00a0\u00d7 3\u00a0mm tissue blocks with razor blade or scalpel.\nFor each tissue block prepare 1.5\u00a0mL of 2% low melting point agarose in D-PBS and warm it to 37\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min.\nNote: 3%\u20134% agarose might be used to further stabilize very soft tissues prior to cutting (Wang et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nNote: In tissues with large pores such as lung or bone the agarose can infiltrates the tissue block and one risks measuring the mechanical properties of agarose instead of those of the tissue of interest. Such samples will require an optimization of the sectioning protocol. For example, by pre-inflating mouse lungs before embedding in agarose (Liu and Tschumperlin, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nRemove D-PBS from the tissue block with cotton pad.\nEmbed tissue block into pre-warmed agarose within a disposable cryomold (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Fresh Tissue Embedding on Agarose\n(A) Schematic of the protocol.\n(B\u2013E) Side and top pictures of the different steps.\nPlace cryomold into bath of D-PBS at 4\u00b0C for 15\u201330\u00a0min, keeping the liquid below the edge of the mold so it does not touch the sample directly. The agarose will gently stabilize the tumor tissue structures. If needed, the agarose-stabilized tissue can be stored at 4\u00b0C in a fridge till cutting (steps 7\u201320) and measuring on the same day (steps 28\u201339).Fresh Tissue Sectioning Using a Vibratome and Placement on AFM-Compatible Dishes\nTiming: 2 h\nFresh tissue blocks in cryomolds are cut in a vibratome. Sections are collected on AFM-compatible dishes, where they can be stained without prior fixation to evaluate orientation and identify areas of interest.\nTransport fresh tissue blocks embedded in solidified agarose (appears opaque) to a vibratome.\nWarm sample to 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min.\nLiberate the agarose-stabilized tissue block from the cryomold and trim the surrounding agarose using a disposable razor blade. Trim around the specimen leaving 3\u00a0mm of agarose on the top and side and 5\u00a0mm on the bottom to assure that the sample is not touching the vibratome plate (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Diagram of Preparation of Agarose-Stabilized Tissue Block for Vibratome Cutting\n(A) Bird\u2019s eye view of a vibratome stage showing the relative positions of the sample and blade, and approaching direction.\n(B) Transverse plane of the agarose block: gray area indicates non-interesting area, for example, adjacent healthy tissue; yellow area indicates interesting area, for example, tumor vascularized stroma; brown area indicates non-usable area, for example, necrosis in liver metastasis (LM) or lumen chamber of primary tumor (pTU).\n(C) Sagittal plane of the agarose block. 3\u00a0mm of agarose are left on the sides and 5\u00a0mm on the bottom of the tissue block. Dot lines along a, b, c, d indicate cutting paths, associated with height of blade and layer of tissue.\n(D) Transverse plane of the agarose slides: layers are corresponding to paths in (C): b and d layers should be discarded. Coordinate axes on the bottom-left corner indicate the axis and plane.Orient the agarose-stabilized tissue block so area of interest is facing up using forceps and gently place it on a couple of drops of superglue on the vibratome base. Allow it to bind for 20\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C.\nNote: To orient the tissue pay attention to the tissue color and texture. Healthy liver is much more pink than colorectal metastasis, which has more of a white tone.\nFill the chamber of the vibratome with cold D-PBS and ice.\nFill as many 12-wells plate wells with 1\u00a0mL ice-cold D-PBS as needed. Place on ice bucket.\nCut 100\u00a0\u03bcm sections using the vibratome. In short, lock the metal base with the agarose-stabilized tissue in the cold D-PBS-filled chamber. Secure a double-edge razor blade on the holder, with a sharpened edge facing upward. Carefully cut off the excess agarose from the block by advancing the vibratome (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: If the tissue is soft, once the blade touches the tissue it could push and deform it instead of cutting. To avoid that hold the tissue against the cutting-edge using a brush (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSpread the section evenly in the cold D-PBS. Due to surface tension, most tissue sections will spread. If that is not the case gently help using the forceps.\nPick up the floating sections by lifting them with a 10\u00a0mm round coverslip held by the forceps (end of Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nWash and remove excess agarose by transferring each section into a 6-well well with 2.5\u00a0mL of D-PBS at 37\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. To transfer the slices pick them up with a round coverslip as done in step\u00a015.\nTransfer slices to pre-prepared 12-well plates on ice bucket. Upon submersion of the forceps the slice will float and thus can be deposited in the well.Critical: This step is very important to remove any left-over agarose that could cover the sample. This could lead to the measurement of the enveloping agarose instead of the tissue sample. Repeat if any agarose remains on the tissue (appears opaque).\nTransfer the fresh section (as done in step 15) from the 12-well into a poly-L-lysine-coated AFM-compatible glass bottom dishes with 1\u00a0mL 50% FBS in D-PBS (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. Fresh Tissue Sectioning Using a Vibratome, Steps 13\u201315\nRemove most of the liquid gently by pipetting on the dish wall and let the tissue section settle down and spread evenly. Sandwich the section with a second clean, uncoated coverslip and apply very mild pressure to help the attachment to the poly-L-lysine-coated AFM-compatible glass bottom dish.\nOnce the tissue section is firmly attached, carefully fill the AFM-compatible dish with 1\u00a0mL of D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA (1 pill in 10\u00a0mL, according to the manufacturer), remove the coverslip and store till measurements within the same day at 4\u00b0C. The proteinase inhibitor together with the 4\u00b0C storage will slow down sample degradation.\nCritical: It is important to use proteinase inhibitors without EDTA as we have shown that EDTA is sufficient to alter the mechanical properties of tissues (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05.

Fresh Tissue Section Placement on AFM-Compatible Dishes, Step 18\nTissue Cryosectioning Using Cryostat and Placement of Sections on AFM-Compatible Dishes and Slides for ImagingTiming: 30\u00a0min\nFrozen tissue blocks in cryomolds are cut in a cryostat. Two sets of sections are collected, a first set for imaging-based assessments (quality control, evaluation of necrosis and immunochemistry) (steps 23\u201325) and a second set for AFS measurements (steps 26 and 27).\nTransport frozen tissue blocks in cryomolds on top of dry ice to a cryostat.\nCut 30\u00a0\u03bcm sections using a cryostat at \u221220\u00b0C.\nNote: A brush is useful to help guide the emerging sections from the knife blade. To prevent sections from melting some practice will be required. Try to cut each section in less than 30\u00a0s (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCritical: A smooth surface of the frozen section is key to guarantee adhesion to the glass bottom AFM-compatible dish. Adjust the cutting temperature (\u00b1 5\u00b0C) to avoid broken or melting and sticky sections. Tissue type and quality will determine the exact temperature needed.\nFor imaging transfer the sections directly to a 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C microscope slide by touching the frozen tissue with the slide (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nNote: Silanized and poly-L-lysine-coated slides improve the adherence.\nTo evaluate tissue preservation and orientation, stain the first slide of each set with H&E (Mendoza and Bishop, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nFor sections that will be immunostained immerse the slide immediately into a fixative (i.e., 4% PFA).\nFor AFS measurements transfer the section to a RT AFM-compatible glass bottom dish with the help of a brush and immediately fill with 1\u00a0mL of D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA till AFS measurements (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S3. Tissue Cryosectioning Using Cryostat and Placement of Sections on Slides for Imaging, Steps 22 S3\nStore at 4\u00b0C till measurement on the same day.Critical: Do not allow the section to air-dry at RT. It will lead to a loss of high-resolution mechanical details and can also change immunostaining results.\nNote: Left-over tissue can be stored back into disposable cryomold with a layer of OCT on top to prevent freeze-drying during storage at \u221280\u00b0C.\nNote: For long-term storage, a moistened tissue can be placed next to the sample in a paper box to prevent desiccation (particularly in a frost-free freezer).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S4. Tissue Cryosectioning Using Cryostat and Placement of Sections on AFM-Compatible Dishes, Step 26\nAtomic Force Spectroscopy and Fluorescence Imaging of Tissue Sections\nTiming: 3 h\nIn order to identify the relevant areas for AFS, tissue sections can be inspected by phase contrast microscopy, or immunostained without prior fixation and visualized by fluorescence microscopy on the AFM (steps 28\u201332). If live immunostaining is performed, coat the cantilever with Pluronic (step 33) in parallel to save time.\nFor live immunostaining, instead of filling dishes with D-PBS on steps 20 (for fresh slices) or 26 (for frozen slices), block tissue section with 5% serum (from the source of the desired secondary antibody) in D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA for 2\u00a0h at RT.\nIncubate the tissue section with primary antibody (e.g., rabbit anti-collagen I to visualize interstitial collagen (1:100 dilution), rabbit anti-\u03b1SMA (1:100 dilution) to visualize fibroblasts) in 5% serum, 0.2% Triton in D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA for 1\u00a0h at RT.\nNote: Triton can be present in the staining buffers as we have shown that it does not have an effect on tissue mechanics (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06.

Figure\u00a0modified from Shen et\u00a0al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nWash sample three times for 5\u00a0min each with D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA.\nIncubate with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore (e.g., Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200 dilution)) in 5% serum, 0.2% Triton in D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA for 1\u00a0h at RT.\nNote: When available we recommend using conjugated antibodies as this reduces the risk of slice detachment.\nWash tissue slices several times with D-PBS with proteinase inhibitors without EDTA.\nCoat the bead-attached cantilever with 1% Pluronic for 30\u00a0min \u2013 1\u00a0h to avoid adhesion to the sample. For this, mount the cantilever to the glassblock and either hang it into a dish or mount it to the AFM head. Lower it into a dish with Pluronic, so that the cantilever is freely submerged in liquid without touching surfaces.\nRinse cantilever by submerging it several times in dish with PBS and calibrate the cantilever in liquid.\nWipe the bottom surface of the AFM-compatible dishes with the tissue slice with tissue paper and mount on the AFM sample stage.\nAlign the cantilever to the center of the dish. Switch to phase contrast and/or fluorescence imaging to choose an area of interest on the tissue.\nTo ensure the fastest rate of elastic measurement without viscoelastic deformation the optimal indentation speed needs to be experimentally determined for each sample type as done in (Rosenbluth et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). In short, test a whole range and identify the maximum speed (to maximize throughput) with consistent Young\u2019s modulus. We found that for colorectal cancer a velocity of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm/s was ideal (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/276-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07.

Displayed dots are the average of three measurements. Figure\u00a0modified from Shen et\u00a0al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nNote: More sampling points will provide higher spatial resolution but lengthen the time required for mapping. We suggest to use a 5\u00a0\u00d7 5 sample grid to map a 20\u00a0\u00d7 20\u00a0\u03bcm2 area at an indentation velocity of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm/s, which can be completed in ~30\u00a0min.\nFor a single measurement, move the cantilever to the area of interest and perform a standard force-curve. Repeat three times on the same location.\nNote: We performed our indentation curves with a force of 2 nN as it provided enough depth to fit the Hertz model to the top 200\u00a0nm upon contact but at the same time did not damage the tissue upon repeated measurements.\nCritical: To use the Hertz model to determine the elastic properties of the tissue the flat area before contact with the sample is critical. For data fitting purposes make sure you collect data 2\u20134\u00a0\u03bcm above the surface of the tissue with the contact speed.\nFor automated mapping of the region of interest, switch to Force-Map mode, where the cantilever collects individual force-displacement curves at each point within a defined sample grid.\nNote: Avoid drying of the cantilever between switching samples.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMethodology of fresh tissue freezing (snap-frozen technique)\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\u00a0\u2013 1 h\nThis section describes the steps to prepare and snap-freeze small intestine.\nNote: In this protocol small intestine is used as an example of fresh-tissue freezing; this snap-freezing method of fresh tissue may be used with other tissues.\nNote: For tissues, such as lung tissue, may need to be inflated with a 1:1 ratio of warm 1\u00d7 PBS and Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) compound to maintain its shape.\nPreparation and snap-freezing of the small intestine (SI)\nEuthanize (decapitation, cervical dislocation, etc.) the mouse according to approved euthanasia procedures and immediately proceed with the protocol.\nCritical: Work with one mouse at a time; tissues should be snap-frozen within 5\u201310\u00a0min of euthanasia.\nDissect the small intestine.\nCut at the proximal end about 1\u00a0cm from the stomach and then cut at the distal end, 1cm from the cecum.\nPlace SI in a petri dish on ice filled with ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS.\nUsing a 10\u00a0mL syringe filled with ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS, equipped with an 18G feeding needle, slowly flush the SI to remove fecal matter.\nPlace SI on Whatman paper and, using forceps, gently remove any excess tissue/fat.\nStretch the SI into an S shape and cut it into three equal segments.\nNote: The proximal end is the duodenum (closest to the stomach), followed by the jejunum, and the ileum is distal (closest to the cecum). It is impossible to distinguish these three different segments histologically; hence, note which segment you are working with.\nCut the segment of interest longitudinally along the length of the fragment at the mesenteric line.\nWith the luminal side facing upward and the serosa side flat on Whatman paper, gently blot excess PBS with a Kim wipe.Wrap the proximal end of SI around a toothpick and gently and loosely roll the intestine to form a Swiss-roll with the aid of curved forceps (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: The Swiss-roll technique is useful for scanning a large section of the small intestine and for quantitative assessment.\nNote: For a more detailed protocol demonstrating the Swiss-roll technique, please refer to Bialkowska et\u00a0al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nSlowly submerge the rolled small intestine into the cryo-mold containing the O.C.T compound until the toothpick touches the cryo-mold\u2019s bottom.\nSlowly remove it by slowly pulling it up while holding down the tissue with small surgical forceps.\nCover the rest of the tissue with O.C.T..\nCritical: Avoid bubbles while adding O.C.T., especially around the tissue. If they occur, gently pop them with a toothpick.\nNote: Orientation of tissue in the block is important (the sectioning surface is at the bottom of the cryo-mold).\nHold the cryo-mold that contains the O.C.T. and the rolled tissue using large tongs/forceps.\nGently immerse \u00be of it into the container containing the cold isopentane. The freezing process should take about 30\u201360 s.\nNote: Be careful not to drop or not to submerge the samples fully; isopentane should not come in contact with the O.C.T. compound. Make sure the sample is fully frozen but ensure it does not crack.\nCritical: Tissues should be snap-frozen or placed in fixative within 5\u201310\u00a0min.\nNote: The faster you freeze the small intestine, the less chance of freezing (Swiss cheese holes) artifacts developing that can lead to crystal formation and tissue rupture; also, rapid freezing minimizes tissue desiccation.\nOnce the sample is frozen, tissue should be immediately stored in the foam container with dry ice until all the samples in the experiment are frozen.Pause point: Samples may be stored at \u221280\u00b0C until ready for sectioning and staining. Samples can be stored for up to 6\u00a0months without significant damage to the tissue integrity.\nWrap each frozen cryo-mold with the square pieces of aluminum foil.\nSeal in a zipper storage bag, removing any air.\nPlace in a cryogenic box at \u221280\u00b0C.\nCritical: Proper storage conditions include wrapping samples with foil, storing them in storage bags and removing the air. In addition, storing bagged samples in a cryogenic box will help preserve the tissue and prevent desiccation.\nTissue sectioning, staining, and mounting\nTiming: 2\u20134\u00a0days\nThese steps describe how to section frozen tissues, stain them with antibodies against the specific antigen of interest and the mounting of the slides for imaging.\nDay 1 focuses on sectioning and staining slides, and day 2 focuses on nuclear staining and mounting slides. This protocol may be used for fresh tissue freezing (snap-frozen technique) followed by freezing in O.C.T..\nDay 1:\nSet cryostat temperature between \u221220\u00b0C and \u221225\u00b0C.\nCritical: This is critical for fresh frozen tissue, temperature more than \u221216\u00b0C is not rigid enough to section.\nPlace samples for sectioning at \u221220\u00b0C freezer or inside the cryostat cooling chamber for 20\u201330\u00a0min for the tissue temperature to reach equilibrium.\nMount the tissue onto the cryostat specimen holder tissue \u201cchuck\u201d.\nAdd a drop of O.C.T to the chuck and adhere the tissue via the drop onto the cryostat chuck.\nFreeze using the Peltier option (rapid freeze) in the cooling chamber.\nSection SI (4\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm thickness) onto Superfrost\u2122 Plus charged slides.Critical: The thickness of the tissue sections depends on the type of microscope used to\u00a0visualize the staining. Conventional fluorescent microscopes (ex., Leica DM6000B fluorescent microscope) require the tissue to be under 10\u00a0\u03bcm, but for confocal microscopes,>10\u00a0\u03bcm thickness is preferred. Thicker sections can better preserve overall tissue architecture.\nImmediately after sectioning, place the slides in a Coplin jar containing \u221220\u00b0C cold histological grade, \u226599.5% acetone.\nFix and permeabilize for 7\u00a0min (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: Fixation time needs to be optimized depending on the thickness of the sections. Sections above 10\u00a0\u03bcm might require an increase in fixation time. Sections below 20\u00a0\u03bcm usually require under 10\u00a0min of fixation.\nAir dry slides for 30\u00a0min in a fume hood.\nRehydrate slides in a Coplin jar filled with 1\u00d7 PBS for 10\u00a0min.\nCritical: Once slides are rehydrated, slides should be kept in a moist chamber.\nAspirate any PBS surrounding the tissue and place it in a moist chamber box.\nImmediately add the blocking buffer mixture (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nBlock for 1\u00a0h at (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C).\nWash off the blocking buffer with 1\u00d7 PBS for 5\u00a0min each by placing the slides in Coplin jars.\nRepeat 3 times.\nAspirate any PBS surrounding the tissue and immediately add a pre-conjugated antibody.\nStore at 4\u00b0C in the dark overnight (\u223c12\u201316 h).\nDays 2\u20134:\nWash slides with 1\u00d7 PBS for 5\u201310\u00a0min each by placing the slides in Coplin jars.\nRepeat 3 times.\nStain with nuclear stain Hoechst 33422 (10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL 1:1000) (or DAPI) for 30\u00a0min at (20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C) in the dark.\nWash slides with 1\u00d7 PBS for 5\u00a0min each by placing the slides in Coplin jars.\nRepeat 3 times.\nAspirate any PBS surrounding the tissue.\nAdd a drop of Prolong gold mounting media.Slowly mount with a cover slip.\nWipe any excess mounting media from the corners using a Kim wipe.\nAllow slides to harden/cure in the dark for 24\u201348\u00a0h before visualizing on a microscope.\nNote: Prolong gold is a hardening medium; it allows slides to be visualized months after staining.

This protocol could be used for other tissue as well, but the time of fixation needs to be adjusted according to the thickness of the tissue being fixed.\nLung preparation and chemical fixation\nDay 1:\nDeeply sedate mice using Ketamine (80\u00a0mg/kg)/Xylazine (10\u00a0mg/mL) via the intraperitoneal route. Always make sure to sedate mice according to approved sedation procedures.\nPlace the mouse in the ventral position.\nGrasp the skin over the sternum and make an incision along the ventral midline from the groin to the chin.Grasp the peritoneal wall with forceps and make an incision to expose the gastrointestinal tract and chest cavity.\nMice are euthanized through induced bleeding by cutting into the abdominal aorta.\nUsing forceps, flip the small and large intestines to the right side.\nCut into the abdominal aorta to induce bleeding.\nMake an incision through the ventral diaphragm and cut the rib cage along the sternum to expose the lungs, trachea, heart, and esophagus.\nCarefully cut and remove the heart and esophagus.\nDissect the lung lobe of interest, or the whole pulmonary organ, trachea, and lung can be kept intact.\nImmerse each tissue individually immediately in 10\u00a0mL of fresh 1% PFA in 15\u00a0mL conical tubes.\nPlace on a nutator, rocking gently at 4\u00b0C.\nIncubate overnight (\u223c12\u201316 h) (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: Fixation time should be optimized according to the tissue of interest. Fixation time is also dependent on the thickness of the tissue. Over-fixation leads to excess cross-linking of biomolecules preventing access to the antigen of interest and increasing background auto-fluorescence. The overnight timepoint mentioned in the protocol is optimized for a single lobe of the lung from 8\u201310\u00a0week-old female mice.\nNote: Inflation of the lung with PFA is not recommended for imaging lungs infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb). This will allow for proper identification of worm location within the lungs and their proximity to cells of interest.\nDay 2:\nPlace the lung tissues in 6-well plates filled with 1\u00d7 PBS and place on a nutator, gently washing for 5\u00a0min.\nPlace the lung tissues in 6-well plates filled with 50\u00a0mM Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\nPlace on a nutator, gently washing for 5\u00a0min to quench free aldehydes.\nRepeat 3 times.\nPlace the lung tissues in 6-well plates filled with 1\u00d7 PBS.Place on a nutator, gently washing for 5\u00a0min.\nCryoprotect the lungs by placing them in 30% (w/v) sucrose in a 15\u00a0mL conical vial and place on a nutator, rocking gently at 4\u00b0C (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nIncubate tissue overnight (\u223c12\u201316 h) at 4\u00b0C or longer until the tissue sinks.\nDay 3:\nPlace tissue on Whatman paper and gently blot to dry with a Kim wipe.\nPlace 1/3 O.C.T. filled cryo-mold on dry ice.\nOnce it starts freezing, add the lung on top of the almost frozen O.C.T.\nCompletely cover the tissue with O.C.T. and keep it on dry ice until it\u2019s fully frozen.\nCritical: Avoid bubbles while adding O.C.T. if bubbles occur, you can gently pop them with a toothpick.\nNote: Orientation of tissue in the block is important (the sectioning surface is the bottom of the cryo-mold).\nOnce the sample is frozen, it can be stored in the foam container with dry ice until all the samples in the experiment are frozen.\nPause point: Samples may be stored at \u221280\u00b0C until ready for sectioning and staining.\nWrap each frozen cryo-mold with the square pieces of aluminum foil.\nSeal in a zipper storage bag removing any air.\nPlace in a cryogenic box at \u221280\u00b0C.\nCritical: Proper storage conditions that include wrapping samples with foil, storing them in storage bags, removing the air, and storing them in a cryogenic box will help preserve the tissue and prevent desiccation.\nTissue sectioning, staining, and mounting\nTiming: 2\u20134\u00a0days\nThis section describes how to section frozen tissues, stain them with antibodies against the specific antigen of interest and how to mount the slides for imaging.Day 1 focuses on sectioning and staining slides, and day 2 focuses on nuclear staining and mounting slides.

Preparation for Slicing (One Day Before Slicing)\nPreparation of the vibrating microtome\nPlace the ceramic blade into its holder by following these steps: after carefully unwrapping the blade, place the sharp edge first into the slot of the blade tool. Then, fit the blade into the holder by loosening the two screws on the arms of the holder and slide the blade under each washer and push it firmly back against the rear stops. Tighten the screws to secure the blade.\nNOTE: The screws should not be overtightened.\nCalibrate the blade using the calibration protocol and tools according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nNOTE: Briefly, in order to facilitate alignment of the blade with the axis of travel and to minimize the Z axis deflections, the vibrating microtome uses a demountable calibration device. When the calibration device is plugged into the instrument its presence will automatically be detected, and the vibrating microtome will take control of adjusting the amplitude and frequency settings of the blade to a magnitude which best allows the adjustment of the blade alignment error.\n\t\t\nPress the Slice button to start the alignment process which will automatically move the blade so that the cutting edge is in optimal position relative to the calibration device for best alignment evaluation. Follow the on-screen instructions to make adjustments to the blade using the provided screwdriver to ensure that the Z-alignment is within 1 \u00b5m.\nAutoclave the inner bath and all the metal parts of the vibrating microtome.Autoclave the large metal trays (for collecting the slices and soaking the electrical stimulation plate covers), any glass containers, regular rectangle blades, forceps, scissors, printer timing belt (cut them into 6 mm wide pieces), metal washers and 5 L of double distilled water (ddH2O).\nSterilize one 1 L jar, one 500 mL jar and one plastic tray for the heart in situ and in vitro perfusion with the cardioplegic solution.\nPrepare 2 L of the slicing Tyrode's solution in a 2 L beaker.\nFor 1 L of the slicing Tyrode's solution, mix 3 g/L 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM), 140 mM NaCl (8.18 g), 6 mM KCl (0.447 g), 10 mM D-glucose (1.86 g), 10 mM HEPES (2.38 g), 1 mM MgCl2 (1 mL of 1 M solution), 1.8 mM CaCl2 (1.8 mL of 1 M solution), up to 1 L of ddH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.40 using NaOH. Then, filter the solution using a 1,000 mL, 0.22 \u00b5m, vacuum filter/storage system and store at 4 \u00b0C overnight.\nPrepare 4 L of the cardioplegic solution.\nFor 1 L of the cardioplegic solution, mix 110 mM NaCl (6.43 g), 1.2 mM CaCl2 (1.2 mL of 1 M solution), 16 mM KCl (1.19 g), 16 mM MgCl2 (3.25 g), 10 mM NaHCO3 (0.84 g), 1 U/mL heparin, up to 1 L of ddH2O. Adjust the pH to 7.40 using NaOH. Then, filter the solution using a 1,000 mL, 0.22 \u00b5m, vacuum filter/storage system and store at 4 \u00b0C overnight.\nNOTE: Add 1,000 U/L heparin in cardioplegia solution the day of slicing (see step 2.1).Freshly prepare 500 mL of culture medium in the original bottle in a biosafety cabinet: mix medium 199, 1x insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) supplement, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 ng/mL vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 10 ng/mL FGF-basic, and 2x antibiotic-antimycotic. Filter sterilize through the 0.22 \u00b5m, vacuum filter/storage system and store at 4 \u00b0C overnight.\nNOTE: Do not adjust pH, add VEGF and FGF freshly before use.\nPrepare 4% agar gel plates.\nAdd 200 mL of sterilized ddH2O in a 500 mL sterilized flask. Weigh 8 g of agarose, and gently pour into the flask. Boil for 2 min in a microwave, then cool for 5 min at room temperature.\nPour 25 mL in each 100 mm Petri dish in a biosafety cabinet (prepare 6 dishes) and wait for 1 h to solidify. Then, seal the plates with paraffin film, wrap with clean wrap, and store at 4 \u00b0C.\nPrepare 4 L of 70% ethanol by diluting the 200-proof absolute ethanol in autoclaved ddH2O.\nPrepare 2x antibiotic-antimycotic in sterilized ddH2O: mix 980 mL of sterilized ddH2O with 20 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic under the biosafety cabinet.\n2. Pig Heart Perfusion\nAdd 1 mL of 1,000 U/mL heparin to each 1 L of cardioplegic solution. Keep the solution on ice.\nNOTE: At least 3 L are needed for the perfusion and preservation of the heart during the transfer to the tissue culture room.\nTake the following items to the pig surgery room: one large ice bucket full of ice, one sterilized metal tray (keep on ice bucket for heart perfusion), one sterilized 500 mL jar, one 1 L jar (to transfer the heart in cardioplegia solution back to the tissue culture room, on ice), and one sterilized plastic tray full of ice (to keep cardioplegic solution on ice).Prepare an in-situ heart perfusion system containing a 3-way stopcock, a 60 mL syringe, an 18 G butterfly needle catheter, and extension tubing to the cardioplegic solution reservoir.\nAnesthetize the Yorkshire male pig (2\u22123 month-old, 20\u221225 kg) first with an intramuscular injection of a ketamine (20 mg/kg)/xylazine (2 mg/kg) cocktail. Confirm proper anesthesia by the loss of jaw tension. Then, transfer the pig to the surgery room, intubate and mechanically ventilate the lungs as previously described14.\nMaintain anesthesia with (1.5\u22122%) isoflurane.\nPlace the animal on the right lateral position and shave the fur from the chest area. Clean the skin with alcohol scrub, then sterilize the surgical site with 10% (w/v) povidone-iodine solution.\nOpen the chest by left thoracotomy incision using a scalpel at the 4th intercostal space, and use a chest retractor between ribs to hold the chest open and expose the heart.\nNOTE: Use all sterilized instruments for this procedure.\nInsert the butterfly needle catheter into the left atrium and fix the needle with a purse string closure. After intravenous injection of a bolus dose of heparin (100 U/kg), start to perfuse the heart in situ with 500 mL of ice-cold cardioplegic solution (to slow down the heart rate) via the left atrial catheter.\nDeeply anesthetize the pig with 5% isoflurane. Quickly excise the heart out of the chest with surgical scissors. Cannulate the aorta with an aortic cannula and perfuse the heart in vitro with another 1 L of ice-cold cardioplegic solution (100 mL/min) to flush out vasculature blood.\nFollowing heart perfusion, keep the heart in a 1 L jar filled with ice-cold cardioplegia solution and keep on ice during the transfer to the tissue culture room.\n3. Pig Heart Tissue SlicingSet up the tissue bath on the vibratome, add ice to the tissue bath cooling jacket, then add Tyrode's solution into the tissue bath. Set up 1 L plastic jar to collect the disposal of melted ice from the tissue bath cooling jacket.\nUnder the biosafety cabinet, transfer the pig heart to a tray containing 1 L of fresh cold cardioplegic solution.\nDissect the heart to isolate the left ventricle using retractable sterile scalpels. Then, cut the left ventricle into blocks of 1\u22122 cm3 each using razor rectangle blades. Use one piece for slicing and keep the remaining pieces in a 50 mL tube in cold Tyrode's solution on ice for cutting later, if needed.\nNOTE: Massage the tissue before slicing with hands, especially if this is the second block. Massaging helps to restore the correct muscle fiber configuration and prevents any stiffness within the heart block.\nAdd 1\u22122 drops of tissue glue (Table of Materials) to the metal sample holder and stick a piece of the 4% agar block with a surface area of approximately 1 cm2.\nAdd 1\u22122 drops of tissue glue on the agar.\nStick the heart block to the agar with the cardiac epicardium side facing down on the tissue glue and make sure it is as flat as possible. Then, transfer the tissue holder with the heart block to its position in the slicing bath of the vibratome.\nAttach the oxygen tube to the slicing bath and the metal tray filled with Tyrode's solution for collecting the slices (oxygenated Tyrode's bath). Then, add 40 \u00b5m cell strainers in the metal tray to collect the slices after cutting.\nAdjusting the slicing positionUsing the vibratome operating software and the dashboard, adjust the height of the blade/sample. Select the height button and follow the on-screen instructions for adjusting the height. Ideally, have the blade close to the top of the tissue but below the papillary muscles and make sure there is liquid covering the tissue and the blade before slicing.\nAdjust where to begin slicing the tissue by selecting the advance button. Press the slice button and increase the speed using the knob to move the blade towards the edge of the tissue. Then, press slice again to stop, and press the advance button to inactivate the process.\nAdjust the cutting parameters: advance speed = 0.03 mm/s, vibration frequency = 80 Hz, and horizontal vibration amplitude = 2 mm. Then, start slicing by selecting the slice button.\nLet the vibratome slice until it reaches the end of the tissue but before it hits the back end of the specimen holder. At this point, press slice again to stop. Hit the Return button to go back to the start position.\nSelect auto repeat (clicking it twice) which will allow the vibrating microtome to auto repeat the slicing process for up to 99 times.\nCollecting slices\nWait until slices are full length and appear good (after getting past the papillary muscle layers), then start collecting the slices.\nCollect the slices using a plastic Pasteur pipette filled with cold Tyrode's solution to gently grab the tissue from the bath. If necessary, use forceps and spring scissors to dissociate the slice from the heart block if the tissue is still attached.Transfer the slice to one cell strainer in the oxygenated Tyrode's bath (see step 3.7) and use the liquid in the plastic Pasteur pipette to get the tissue to lie flat on one of the cell strainers, then add a metal washer on the top to hold the tissue down.\nNOTE: The slices need to be incubated at least for 1 h in the Tyrode's solution before processing (this is for the BDM to relax the tissue).\n4. Culturing Heart Slices\nPreparing the slices for culture\nTrim the slice from the edges to avoid any uneven edges. Then, glue it from both ends to sterilized polyurethane 6 mm wide printer timing belt with metal wires embedded using tissue glue.\nTransfer the supported heart slices to 6 well plates that contain 6 mL of culture medium in each well.\nPlace the stimulation plate cover (Table of Materials) on the top of the 6 well plate and connect the cover to the cell culture electrical stimulator (Table of Materials). Adjust the stimulator to electrically stimulate the heart slices at 10 V, 1.2 Hz continuously all the time.\n\t\tNOTE: After plugging in the stimulation, the heart slices will start to beat, and this movement will be visually obvious.\nTransfer the plates to an incubator and maintain at 37 \u00b0C with humidified air and 5% CO2.\nChange culture medium 3x per day and add 6 mL of culture medium per well during each media change.\nNOTE: Culture medium is oxygenated for 5 min prior to each media change. Medium must be changed at least 1x per day; this is okay on weekends if necessary. Two days of only 1 media change per day is the maximum that is tested.Change the stimulation plate cover every day to prevent release of toxic graphite particles in the culture medium (usually during the mid-day media change).\nRemove the stimulation plate cover from the culture dish and insert the white foam plug where the cover connects to the cable for the cell culture electrical stimulator, to prevent water damage to the electric circuit.\nPlace the plate cover in a bath of autoclaved water with 2x antibiotic-antimycotic. Keep it in this bath (i.e., rinsing bath) overnight.\nThe next day, move the plate cover into a 70% ethanol bath for 5\u221215 min to decontaminate. Shake off as much liquid from the device before switching baths.\nThen, transfer the plate cover to the third and final bath (i.e., clean bath), which consists of autoclaved water and 2x antibacterial-antimycotic, to rinse any remaining ethanol traces.\nAfter rinsing the plate cover in the clean bath, use a clean lint-free wipe (sprayed down with ethanol) to dry off any residual water on the plastic parts, then remove the white foam piece and carefully place the plate cover back on the culture plate.\nNOTE: Do not touch the black graphite electrodes that go into the well, as the device will no longer be sterile.\nUsing sterile forceps, make sure the tissue is in the center of the well so the plate cover does not touch the tissue. Ensure that the curved side of the plate cover matches up with the angled side of the plate and that the square corners line up.\n\t\tNOTE: To minimize contamination of the stimulation plate covers, keep them in clean and empty 6 well plates after finishing the experiment.Perform an MTT assay, calcium measurements and contractile function assessments on fresh pig heart slices (day 0), and after 6 days in culture according to Ou et al.13.\nSubscription Required.

The example video is included in our tutorial data (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19711738[href=https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19711738], containing an example video along with all the analysis results after \u201cPose estimation\u201d). If you want to skip the experiment and practice the pose estimation (refer to step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] \u201cPose estimation\u201d), download this tutorial data and perform the pose estimation (refer to step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] step 7).\nNote: We combined single-housed males with group-housed females to enhance courtship, as single-housing promotes male courtship while group-housing suppresses female receptivity.\nFemale starvation.\nNote: Females need to be starved 18\u201324\u00a0h before the beginning of the experiment.\nShift the group-housed flies (refer to before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step 9) into an empty vial with a sheet of wet paper.\nPut the empty vial back into the rearing incubator.\nFly loading.\nSwitch the incubator on and set the temperature to 22\u00b0C and the humidity to 50%.\nAssemble the chambers.\nRemove the chamber walls and top plates in Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nHeat the fly food (refer to before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step 3) by microwave until melted.\nPour the food into the holes at the center of each chamber on the bottom plate (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) with a pipette.Stack up the chamber walls and top plates with both the top and left edges aligned (Figures\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nInsert the four separators into the slits by rows.\nIntroduce males into the parts with food (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, the hole below the separation line) guided by a soft tube. Cover the holes on the top plate with the cover plates immediately after the fly is guided into the chambers.\nNote: To make an introducing tube, cut the two ends of a 2\u00a0mL pipette, and make sure that one end fits the microcentrifuge tube and the other end fits the introducing hole. Quickly open the lid of the microcentrifuge tube when the fly stays away from the lid, while aligning the end of the tube with the microcentrifuge tube. After the fly moves into the soft tube, pinch the big end to prevent escaping. Place the small end above the introducing hole and wait until the fly moves into the chamber.\nNote: Anesthetization affects the neural activity of the flies that may not recover immediately after waking up. We therefore recommend not to anesthetize the males to maintain the best condition of the animals at the cost of experiment difficulty.\nAnesthetize the group-housed flies by ice.\nPick the females with tweezers and gently moved them into the parts without food (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, the introducing hole above the separation line), thus preventing them from eating before the experiment.\nCover the holes on the top plate with the cover plates.\nAdaptation.\nLeave the flies in the chamber for 20\u201330\u00a0min for recovery and adaptation.\nClosing chamber.\nJust before the video acquisition, remove the separators and slide the top plate up to cover the introducing holes (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nRemove the cover plates to clear the view.Note: This operation should finish within 2\u00a0min to reduce the interaction time before video acquisition.\nCritical: When sliding the top plate, take care not to crush the flies with the introducing hole. When there are flies in the introducing hole, wait a short time until all the flies leave the holes.\nVideo acquisition.\nRun the video acquisition software (e.g., MIAS_FLIR.exe for FLIR cameras).

This configuration shows 3 dialog boxes in series (described in the following steps 9\u201311) to set the parameters for keypoint detection and behavior annotation.\nSetting the scale.\nThe first dialog shows a random sampled frame from the video for setting the scale, defined as the number of pixels occupying a 1-mm length.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1923-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07. UI for setting the scale factor(A) This UI shows the image of a frame with an auto-detected chamber diameter (blue line). Optionally, modify the textboxes below the image to change the experiment date (\u201cExpDate\u201d), female eclosion date (\u201cFemaleDoB\u201d), and temperature (\u201cTemperature\u201d). The textbox \u201cDiameter (mm)\u201d is for specifying the real length of the chamber diameter. \u201cScale (px/mm)\u201d is updated automatically when the diameter and the real length are both specified. Click button \u201cRandom\u201d to change a frame to show.\n(B and C) If the detected diameter is incorrect, label two points on the image by clicking to indicate a diameter. First, click the start point (B, red point). Second, click the end point (C).\nNote: The scale factor is calculated by automatic detection of the chamber diameter (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A blue line). Alternatively, the chamber diameter can also be specified manually (Figures\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B and 7C).\nInput the real diameter (in mm) of the chamber in the textbox \u201cDiameter (mm)\u201d.

Click again to re-include the circle as a ROI.(C) Input fly information for each ROI in the textbox \u201cFlyInfo\u201d. Specify all ROIs according to the order of top to bottom and left to right (skipping the excluded ROIs with red circles). The text for one ROI is composed of a group name and an age number, separate by \u201c_\u201d. The adjacent ROIs with the same group and age can be merged and represented by adding \u201c\u2217N\u201d (N is the number of the same ROIs). Different ROIs are separated by \u201c,\u201d. For example, the text \u201cCtrl_9\u22177,Exp_8,Exp_9\u22177\u201d (textbox \u201cFlyInfo\u201d) means the first 7 males are from \u201cCtrl\u201d group and are 9\u00a0d old, the eighth male is from \u201cExp\u201d group and are 8\u00a0d old, and the last 7 males are from \u201cExp\u201d group and are 9\u00a0d old. The red one (the third one of the fourth row) is excluded.\nOptional: If the detection is incorrect, change the parameters for circle detection (the textbox \u201cCircleParam\u201d) or use the manual mode (see problems 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.19] and 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.27] for the details).\nSome of the regions should not be analyzed due to the unsuccessful preparation. Click in any circle to exclude the region from being ROI (the circle will change to red, Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nClick \u201cConfirm\u201d to proceed to the next step.\nBackground subtraction.\nWait several seconds of computing until the appearance of the next dialog box.\nNote: The program computes the background image by averaging 100 frames that are uniformly sampled in time throughout the video.\nFly segmentation.\nNote: The program segments the flies in the images by detecting connected regions in binarized images.\nThe dialog shows the binarized ROI regions (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9], 15 ROIs are shown because one ROI is excluded).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1923-Fig9.jpg\nFigure\u00a09.

This is useful for inspecting the partial results quickly to find the problems. If the results are not satisfactory, you can stop the keypoint detection and make adjustments before running the \u201cSoAL_KptDetect.py\u201d command again.Note: The table file \u201cxxx_kpt.csv\u201d contains the following columns. \u201cframe\u201d is the frame number. The same frame number will appear twice for the two flies. \u201creg_n\u201d is the number of regions detected. This number is generally 2 for social behavior, but it becomes 1 when the two flies overlap. \u201carea\u201d is the area of one region. \u201cpos:x\u201d and \u201cpos:y\u201d is the position of the region center in the coordinate of the ROI (origin point on the upper left corner). \u201cori\u201d is the orientation angle. \u201ce_maj\u201d and \u201ce_min\u201d is the major and minor axis of the fitted ellipse. \u201cpoint:xs\u201d and \u201cpoint:ys\u201d are the horizontal and vertical positions of the 5 keypoints.\nBehavior annotation\nTiming: Several minutes depending on the specific case\nThe following step assigns the correct identities to the detected keypoints and annotates behaviors of each fly.

We recommend to process the sample few hours after the surgical collection, but the tumor can be stored into the medium tube at 4\u00b0C up to 24 h.\nDecontaminate working spaces under the hood and equipment (scissor and tweezers) with 70% ethyl alcohol before beginning.\nPrepare enzyme digestion mix in a 15\u00a0mL tube:\nAdd 4.7\u00a0mL of RPMI medium without serum and any other supplements.\nAdd 200\u00a0\u03bcL of enzyme H, 100\u00a0\u03bcL of enzyme R and 25\u00a0\u03bcL of enzyme A into the tube.\nMix well by vortexing.\nCut the tumor into small pieces of approximately 2\u00a0mm3 and place it directly into the enzyme mix.\nPlace the sample into a 37\u00b0C incubator under continuous rotation during 40\u00a0min.\nNote: Usually, we obtained 4 to 12\u00a0cm3 tumor sample. The protocol is for around 6\u00a0cm3 tumor sample volume and we recommend splitting the tumor into two mix enzyme tubes if it is larger than 6\u00a0cm3.\nPlace a 100\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer on 50\u00a0mL tube and rinse the cell strainer with 1\u00a0mL of culture medium.\nTransfer digested tumor pieces on the cell strainer with the enzyme digestion medium.\nSmash the tumor gently with the flat end of a 1\u00a0mL syringe plunger (remove the plunger from the syringe).\nRegularly wash the cell strainer with culture medium during smashing of the tumor.\nContinue to smash until the maximum of tumor tissue is dissociated.\nWash the cell strainer until reaching 48\u00a0mL of cell suspension volume in the 50\u00a0mL tube.Critical: At this step, if the tumor is over smashed or smashed with too much force, there is a risk to decrease cell viability, especially for tumor cells, which are often sensitive. Depending on the tumor features, some tissue fragments with calcifications are not well digested and cannot be dissociated in single-cell suspension. These fragments are tough to dissect and have to be wasted after the washing step of the cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 10\u00a0min at 400\u2013500\u00a0\u00d7 g.\nDuring the centrifugation, prepare 5\u00a0mL of Red Blood Cell (RBC) lysis solution 1\u00d7.\nDiscard the supernatant and keep a small volume of medium into the tube (around 500\u00a0\u03bcL).\nDissociate gently the pellet by tapping the tube.\nResuspend slowly the pellet with 5\u00a0mL of RBC lysis solution using a 5\u00a0mL pipette and make 5\u00d7 up and down.\nIncubate 3\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5\u00a0min at 400\u2013500\u00a0\u00d7 g.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20\u00a0mL culture medium.\nCount the number of cells and the viability with trypan blue solution.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5\u00a0min at 400\u2013500\u00a0\u00d7 g, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 10\u00a0mL of culture medium.\nSet apart around 0.5\u20131 million of total cells for flow cytometry staining in a 5\u00a0mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5\u00a0min at 400\u2013500\u00a0\u00d7 g, discard the supernatant and proceed to column cell isolation (see Isolation of tumor-resident memory T\u00a0cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]).Pause Point: It is possible to keep cells in culture for 24\u00a0h before the isolation of CD8+ T\u00a0cells; however, the viability could be reduced. For cell culture, plate cells in a 6-well cell culture plate at 2 million/mL in rIL2 culture medium, and place cells in 37\u00b0C incubator. Another possibility is to freeze cells in freezing media at 10\u201320 million cells/mL. However, this process will also give rise to cell mortality.

First, it consists in a positive selection of total CD8+ T\u00a0cell population with magnetic bead Miltenyi system and it is followed by the FACS isolation of CD8+CD103+ T\u00a0cells.\nCritical: This section has to be processed under biosafety hood and in sterile conditions.\nResuspend total cells in cold Miltenyi buffer at the concentration of 10\u00a0\u00d7 106 total cells for 80\u00a0\u03bcL.\nAdd 20\u00a0\u03bcL of human CD8 microbeads for 10\u00a0\u00d7 106 total cells and mix well with up and down pipetting. Incubate at 4\u00b0C during 15\u00a0min.\nNote: Always wait until the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\nAttach the magnet to the magnetic stand and place the LS column in the magnet field of a suitable Miltenyi magnet.\nAdd the 50\u00a0\u03bcm pre-separation filter in the LS column.\nEquilibrate the column by pipetting 3\u00a0mL cold Miltenyi Buffer into the 50\u00a0\u03bcm pre-separation filter. Wait until the column reservoir is empty.Place a 15\u00a0mL tube under the column to collect unlabeled cells. The unlabeled CD8-negative cells will be in the flow through from the column.\nAfter incubation with microbeads, wash cells by adding 5\u00a0mL cold Miltenyi buffer. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 5\u00a0min at 400\u2013500\u00a0\u00d7 g and aspirate the supernatant completely.\nResuspend cells in 1\u00a0mL cold Miltenyi buffer (or 500\u00a0\u03bcL if less than 10 million cells).\nApply cell suspension through the cell strainer in the LS column.

The isolation of tumor cells is based on Tumor Cell Isolation Kit from Miltenyi, designed for the enrichment of untouched tumor cells and depletion of non-tumor cells (see manufacturer protocol at https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/FR-en/products/tumor-cell-isolation-kit-human.html#130-108-339[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/FR-en/products/tumor-cell-isolation-kit-human.html#130-108-339]). The isolation of CD8+ T\u00a0cells and autologous tumor cells enable to perform in vitro functional experiments to assess the tumor specificity of CD8+ T\u00a0cell populations, as such cytotoxicity with chromium51 release assay or conjugate formation.\nDetermine the number of cells in the CD8-negative fraction.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5\u00a0min at 400\u2013500\u00a0\u00d7 g. Aspirate the supernatant completely.\nResuspend up to 10 million total cells in 60\u00a0\u03bcL of cold Miltenyi buffer (scale up according to cell number).\nAdd 20\u00a0\u03bcL of Non-tumor cell depletion Cocktail A and 20\u00a0\u03bcL of Non-tumor cell depletion Cocktail B for up to 10 million cells (scale up according to the cell number), mix well with up and down pipetting and incubate for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nNote: CD8-negative fraction cells could be kept at 4\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h before cell isolation; however, longer storage could result in reduction of cell viability.\nNote: For next steps, always wait until the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\nDuring incubation, place the LS column in the magnet field of a Miltenyi magnet.\nAdd the 50\u00a0\u03bcm pre-separation filter in the LS column.\nEquilibrate the LS column by pipetting 3\u00a0mL cold Miltenyi Buffer into the pre-separation filter. Wait until the column reservoir is empty.\nPlace a 15\u00a0mL tube under the LS column to collect unlabeled cells. The unlabeled tumor cells will be in the flow through from the column.Bring up the cell suspension to 500\u00a0\u03bcL of cold Miltenyi buffer for up to 10 million cells (scale up according to the cell number).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/366-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Purity of sorted CD8+ TRM cells post-FACS\nApply cell suspension through the cell strainer in the LS column.\nWhen the column reservoir is empty, perform washing steps by adding 1\u00a0mL of Miltenyi buffer in the column. Keep collecting the flow through from the washing steps into the 15\u00a0mL tube containing the unlabeled cells.\nRepeat step 49 once.\nOptional: The labeled fraction containing non-tumor cells can be recovered by removing the column from the magnet, placing it into a new 15\u00a0mL tube, adding 3\u00a0mL of Miltenyi buffer, and immediately flushing out the cells by pushing the plunger into the column.\nDetermine the cell number and viability with trypan blue solution of the untouched tumor cells.\nCentrifuge the tumor cell suspension for 5\u00a0min at 400\u2013500\u00a0\u00d7 g and discard the supernatant completely.\nResuspend in LC medium at 200,000 tumor cells/mL and plate them in 6/12 or 24-well culture plate depending of the number of cells.\nPlace the cells in incubator 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2.\nNote: The number of tumor cells recovered is extremely dependent of the tumor piece. A strong variability between patient tumors exists both for the cancer cell number and for immune cell infiltration.Note: For the majority of tissue samples, isolated tumor cells usually attached to the plastic culture plate after a few hours of culture. However, depending of the tumor sample, it appends that tumor cells do not attach on the plastic, reflecting a weak viability. To detach tumor cells, we recommend to remove the culture medium, wash with 2\u20133\u00a0mL of PBS, remove the remaining medium and then apply PBS with EDTA diluted at 1/1000. Incubate 2\u20133\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C and monitor the detachment of tumor cells under microscope. Perform gently up and down pipetting with a 1\u00a0mL pipette to continue detaching adherent cells. Stop the EDTA by adding LC medium and transfer cell suspension in 15\u00a0mL tube to centrifuge and resuspend in the desired volume of culture medium.", "The protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.

Instruments for operation\nEnsure the availability of the surgical microscope and microvascular doppler.\n2. Preparation for operation\nClean and shave the inguinal/subinguinal skin and scrotum before surgery.\n\tNOTE: Before surgery, the surgical site need not be sterilized. As a routine procedure, soap is used to clean the inguinal/subinguinal skin and scrotum, and then a razor is used for shaving the area.\nLet the patient lie on the operating table in a supine position after combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: The anesthetist performs anesthetization. The anesthetization agents are mainly routine, while sometimes personalized. The choice and the dose of the anesthetic agent used are made by the anesthetist.\n3. Procedure\nExpose and lift the spermatic cord out of the incision.\n\t\nPerform a 2 cm oblique skin incision below the external inguinal ring with a circular scalpel.\nThen, dissect the spermatic cord and deliver it through the incision with the help of appendix forceps (see Figure 1).\nMicrosurgical varicocelectomy\n\t\nBring an operating microscope into the operating field, and examine the cord under 8\u201312x power magnification.\nUse an electric knife to cut the external fascia and cremasteric fibers about 1 cm. Bluntly separate the internal spermatic fascia with its structures from the vas deferens and its vessels by a loop. Ligate the external spermatic vessels with 4-0 silk sutures.Drip 1% lidocaine solution on the spermatic cord. Use an intra-operative vascular Doppler flow detector (see Figure 2) to localize the internal spermatic arteries (pulse \u201cwhistle\u201d sound can be heard when the microvascular doppler probes the arterial surface while there is no sound on the veins).\nDoubly ligate all of the internal spermatic veins with 4-0 silk ties and divide them. Accurately separate and preserve all identified arteries and lymphatics by loops (see Figure 3). Use microvascular doppler to distinguish arteries from veins when necessary.\nMicrosurgical denervation (see Figure 4)\n\t\nNext, carefully divide the anterior cremasteric muscle. Cut off the fatty and connective tissues surrounding the spermatic cord blood vessels and vas deferens completely with an electric knife. Identify and preserve the vas deferens and its associated vessels.\nLigate and divide the vasal veins attached to the vas deferens when the vessels enlarge. Divide the posterior cremasteric fibers and fat components.\nFinish the operation\n\t\nSkeletonize (only the testicular arteries, lymphatic vessels, and vas deferens remained after the surgery) the spermatic cord completely. Use the microvascular doppler to examine the testicular arteries again (see Figure 5).\nThen, manually place the cord back into the incision. Suture the deep tissue and skin.\nSubscription Required.

This protocol\n      enables the identification of OSNs of specific subtypes born at defined\n      times. Using appropriate tissues and riboprobes, it can be applied to the\n      study of the birthrates and/or survival rates of OSNs of essentially any\n      subtype and how they change as a function of experience.\n    \nNote: Steps of this protocol involving the\n      transfer of slides from one solution to another can be performed either by\n      decanting the solution from the slide submersion chamber and adding new\n      solution, or by moving the slides to a different submersion chamber\n      containing new solution. Steps involving the transfer of slides from the\n      submersion chamber to the humidified horizontal slide chamber should be\n      done with care to avoid drying of tissue sections. For these steps, we\n      recommend removing one slide at a time, gently tapping an edge of the\n      slide on a paper towel to remove excess wash solution, wiping the bottom\n      and side edges of the slide on a dry paper towel, placing the slide into\n      the horizontal chamber, carefully adding the required solution dropwise to\n      cover all sections on the slide as evenly as possible, and, If applicable,\n      placing a #1 coverslip on the slide by gently letting it fall onto the\n      solution starting from the bottom edge. After all slides have been\n      processed, the chamber should be closed.

This threshold is based on the expected\n              incomplete colocalization of OR mRNA, which is concentrated in the\n              cytoplasm, and EdU, which is confined to the nucleus. To minimize\n              potential bias, we recommend that quantification be performed withthe investigator blinded to the identities of experimental groups.", "1. Identification of Animal Model\nThe California Deer Mouse (Peromyscus californicus) is an ideal model to explore paternal responses. As you see, this mouse grooms the pups just as the moms do - they even crouch over them so that it looks like the pups are nursing. The behavior of the California mice is compared to a species of the same genus, the common deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) which exhibits little interest in the pups, often trying to escape or even attack them. (See Figure 1 for pictures of these species interacting with pups.)\nOnce the species model has been identified then the various groups need to be established. In this study, biological fathers, virgins with no parenting experience, and virgins with limited pup exposure (pup-exposed or foster fathers) of both species are used so that both predisposed and acquired paternal characteristics can be assessed. In this particular study we also exposed all groups to a toy mouse pup to assure that the social interactions were specific to a pup and not a representative response to anything placed in the cage (See Figure 2.)\nBefore investigating neurobiological factors, it is important to confirm that the selected species exhibit clear differences in the behavior of interest. In this study, males are placed in a cage with a pup for five minutes and a paternal behavior ethogram (see Table 1 for example of ethogram) is used to score behaviors such as latency to approach the pup and amount of time spent in contact with the pup. If aggressive responses are observed, the pup is removed immediately. These sessions are often videotaped so a careful behavioral analysis can be subsequently conducted.\n2. Preparing Brain TissueFollowing a standard perfusion of each mouse (protocol attached), the brains are removed so that they can be sectioned in the specific area of interest (show brain).\nA standard mouse brain atlas (show atlas) is used to locate the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus, an area known to be rich in cells producing the neuropeptide of interest in this study - vasopressin (AVP).\nThe brain is then blocked and mounted on a freezing chuck so that the tissue will freeze before being sectioned with the microtome. The brain is sectioned in a trim mode until specific landmarks are identified, then the specific brain thickness, 30 microns in this case, is set for the brain sections used for analysis.\nThe brain sections are carefully placed in well plates filled with phosphate buffer saline (PBS); (protocol for PBS attached; please note that this is only one example of a standard immunocytochemistry protocol).\n3. Immunocytochemistry\nThroughout the various steps of this process (see attached protocol), it is important to have accurate pipetting skills to assure accurate measurements of chemicals and other ingredients important for this technique (show student pipetting).\nThe first step in this process is washing the brains which involves replacing the PBS in the well plates three to five times; between each wash the well plates are placed on a rocker for 10 minutes (show student replacing PBS and placing well plates on rockers).\nThe brain slices are then exposed to the primary antibody solution and stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight on the rocker (show process).\nFollowing another wash, the brain slices are exposed to a secondary antibody for one hour on the rocker at room temperature, then washed again.\nNext the brains are exposed to an Avitin-Biotin Complex solution to prepare for the visualization of the neurochemical-positive cells.For the final visualization step, the brains are exposed to DAB. This is a hazardous product and should always be handled with caution. As seen here, the brain slices begin to get darker before your eyes (show process).\nFollowing the DAB exposure, the brains go through the last series of washes and are then carefully placed on subbed microscope slides and allowed to dry overnight (show the placement of a brain slice on a slide; see attachment for subbed slides protocol).\nThe slides are then cleared through a series of distilled water and alcohol washes, finally being submerged in Citrosolv before being coverslipped and stored in a slidebox for safe keeping (show various aspects of this process; see attachment for clearing process).\n4. Neuroquantification\nAfter the slides have dried, they can be assessed with specialized neuroquantification software. Here Bioquant software is used to quantify the vasopressin-positive cells and fibers in the paraventricular nucleus of the mouse brains (show software on screen...and microscope).\nThe specific area of interest is identified using the measurement options of the software to establish the visual field for neuroquantification. It is important that a consistent visual field size is quantified for each animal (show student doing this).\nHere the darkly stained vasopressin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers are apparent. Because it is difficult to count or trace this tissue, a special feature of this software uses light thresholding to determine the total amount of positively stained tissue within the specified area of interest. This thresholding tells us how much of the specified area contained vasopressin-positive tissue (show the data value on the computer screen).\n5. Behavioral AnalysisIf more than one observer will be scoring the videotapes, it is important to establish inter-rater reliability to assure that the observers are scoring the behavior in a consistent manner. For the actual scoring session, a behavior scoring sheet should be prepared to allow for easy scoring of behavior during observation sessions (see Table 2 for example of scoring spread sheet).\nFor behaviors that aren't fast episodic responses, a microsequencing analysis can reveal subtleties about the progression of the specific responses. For example, grooming behavior consists of a chain of very fast responses. Although one option is to simply record the presence and duration of grooming, another is to document the chain of events accompanying this response. Using this microsequencing software, observers score the presence of a particular behavior every second, as prompted by the software (show software and video).\nFollowing data collection, the parameters of interest are determined and the appropriate behavioral scores are analyzed. Examples may be total duration of time spent in contact with the pup, or number of disruptions in the grooming sequence (show computer with spread sheet with data entered for each animal).\nOnce the behavior is scored it is important to confirm that the two species exhibited different response strategies for the behavior of interest in the study. In this case the California deer mice should exhibit more paternal behavior than the common deer mice. Additionally, various behavioral measures can be correlated with brain measures to get a more informed view of relevant influences.\n6. Representative Results:\nTo validate the model, the data should clearly indicate that the two species performed differently with regard to the behavior of interest. Here you see that the P. californicus males spent more time grooming and crouching over the pups, two hallmarks of paternal responses (See Figure 4).In order to determine if the neurobiologial variable of interest is important in paternal responses, the amount of vasopressin (AVP)-positive tissue was quantified for several relevant brain areas; as can be seen, the paternal P. californicus animals had more immune-positive tissue in several of these brain areas. (see Figure 5).\nIn a related study using the microsequencing analysis, it was hypothesized that paternal California mice would exhibit less anxiety than their virgin counterparts; accordingly, when exposed to a predator odor, the fathers exhibited fewer interruptions in the grooming sequence than the virgin animals (see Figure 6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3173/3173fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: (A) Male California mice exhibiting paternal responses toward conspecific alien pup. (B) Male deer mouse exhibiting a cautious approach (stretch attend) and avoidance response in the presence of a conspecific alien pup. Note: In these social interaction assessments, if a male exhibits aggressive responses toward the pup, the experimenters immediately hit the top of the cage to distract the male. At this time the session is terminated and the pup is removed, inspected for any wounds and returned to the mother. In our laboratory, this rarely is observed with P. californicus males but is occasionally observed with P. maniculatus; close observation and immediate intervention, however, prevent harm from occurring to the animals.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3173/3173fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: A California mouse interacting with a toy mouse; most tried to chew on these stimuli.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3173/3173fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Experimental design of study; there were approximately 6 animals in each group for each species.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3173/3173fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Graphic of immunocytochemistry process.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3173/3173fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

After treatment, harvest the cells in Buffer M containing a high concentration of chaotropic salts (GTC) to stabilize the protein-DNA adducts (including the TOP1 molecules engaged with the DNA) and to remove all non-covalently bound proteins.\nCritical: Due to the transient nature of TOP1ccs, small differences in handling samples during this step might result in high variability. It is very important to be consistent with the time of treatment and harvest.\nCritical: While it is recommended to work at cold temperature (10\u00b0C), it is also important to not place the sample in direct contact with ice since Buffer M easily precipitates (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: As this is the most crucial and time-sensitive step, make sure you have the following reagents prepared and thawed before starting: MG132, CPT, Buffer M (without precipitates).

Several short pulses with a Sonopuls HD 2070.2 probe sonicator (Bandelin, 2451) with MS-73 probe (Bandelin, 529) significantly increase the precipitation efficiency.\nAlternatives: You can use other probe sonicators, upon previous optimization.\nCritical: Avoid heating the sample.

Avoid having direct contact of ice with the tube, as Buffer M can easily precipitate. If this happens, follow troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1: Precipitation.\nCritical: Place the tip of the probe about 0.5\u00a0cm from the bottom of the tube and avoid foaming of the sample.

Do not increase the volume of the sample above this threshold. Divide samples with bigger volumes in 2.5\u00a0mL aliquots.\nNote: Over time probe tips degrade and the sonication efficiency decreases. If this happens, increase the amplitude of sonication or replace the probe.After sonicating pulse-spin the tubes in a pre-cooled centrifuge to collect all material and pool both 2.5\u00a0mL aliquots in the same tube.\nPrecipitation\nTiming: 1 h\nAdd 0.5 volume of 100% cold Ethanol to precipitate the DNA-covalent adducts.\nPause point: Optionally after precipitation and resuspension in TE-SDS 0.1% you can freeze the samples at \u221280\u00b0C and continue later.\nNote: Always keep the samples on ice or in cooled racks.\nNote: If you freeze the sample, do not store it for longer than 5\u00a0days.\nPrecipitate all the samples with 0.5 volumes of 100% cold Ethanol (VWR, 437435L).\nAliquot 1.3\u00a0mL of the samples in 2\u00a0mL Eppendorf tubes.\nAdd 650\u00a0\u03bcL of 100% cold Ethanol to each tube.\nMix and incubate at \u221220\u00b0C for at least 10\u00a0min.\nSpin the samples at 21,000\u00a0g (or maximum speed), 4\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the pellet three times with 800\u00a0\u03bcL of cold Wash Buffer.\nRemove the supernatant by pouring it out.\nAdd 800\u00a0\u03bcL of cold Wash Buffer and vortex the pellet shortly (until it detatches) at high setting to facilitate mixing with the Wash Buffer.\nSpin down the sample at 21,000\u00a0g (or maximum speed) and 4\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min.\nRepeat steps 13a\u201313c two more times.\nPour out the supernatant and remove as much Wash Buffer as possible. Specifically, after the final wash, decant the supernatant, keep the tube inverted and drain the excess of liquid on a tissue. Finally, delicately aspirate the remaining liquid with a vacuum device (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]):\nCritical: Be careful not to touch the pellet during aspiration with the vacuum device. Avoid shaking or inverting the tube after decanting.\nDry the pellet for 5\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C.Note: Be careful to not over-dry the pellet. Longer drying might impair the resuspension of the pellet.\nNote: When dry, the pellet becomes transparent.\nResuspend each pellet in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of TE-SDS 0.1%\u00a0+ protein inhibitors cocktail\u00a0+ AEBSF (0.5\u00a0mM, Sigma, A8456).\nLeave the aliquots on ice for 5\u00a0min (the pellet will start to dissolve) and then mix with a pipette to resuspend the pellet. Pool the aliquots from the same samples together and rotate the sample at 4\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min or until they become completely resuspended.\nNote: In case of problems with resuspension follow troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3: Resuspension.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S4.

Sonication with Covaris ME220 (Covaris, 500506) has been proven very effective for fragmentation of samples prepared for sequencing.\nAlternatives: Other sonicators with similar properties might work upon optimization.\nNote: While you wait for the samples to sonicate, we advise to start preparing the antibody-beads complexes. In that case, after you start the sonication, follow Immunoprecipitation with anti-TOP1 antibody, part I[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]:\nNote: Always keep the samples on ice or in cooled racks.\nPause point: Optionally, after sonication you can freeze the samples at \u221280\u00b0C and continue with the IP on the next day or within up to three days. However, if you decide to freeze the sample, we suggest doing it before sonication with Covaris, as the TOP1ccs are more stable.\nSonicate each sample for 5\u00a0min with Covaris.\nTransfer 1\u00a0mL samples into Covaris milliTUBE 1\u00a0mL with AFA Fiber (Covaris, 520130).Note: Fill up the tube to the very top and remove bubbles. If necessary, add more TE-SDS 0.1%\u00a0+ protein inhibitors cocktail\u00a0+ AEBSF before carefully screwing the cap.\nCritical: It is important to not have any bubbles inside the tube because they can decrease the efficiency of sonication. Check for absence of bubbles by gently inverting the tube.\nSet up the \u201cHigh Cell\u201d protocol for Covaris ME220 and sonicate the samples for 5 minutes.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1868_15.csv\nAfter sonication, transfer 20\u00a0\u03bcL of each sample into 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tube.

Keep the remaining sample on ice or at 4\u00b0C in the fridge.\nImmunoprecipitation with anti-TOP1 antibody, part I\nTiming: 4 h\nOptional: Perform this step during the sonication, so that you will have the antibody-beads complexes ready to start the IP once the samples are sonicated and the fragment size is verified.\nNote: Always keep the samples on ice or in cooled racks.\nTransfer 25\u00a0\u03bcL\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(number of samples\u00a0+ 10%) of Protein A/G beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88803) to a 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tube.\nNote: Do not transfer more than 150\u00a0\u03bcL of beads (6 samples) in one 1.5\u00a0mL tube because the beads will be later diluted in 200\u00a0\u03bcL\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(number of samples\u00a0+ 10%).\nNote: Mix the stock of beads by inverting at least 20 times and vortexing gently (until visually homogenous) before pipetting.\nNote: Perform all pipetting of Protein A/G beads using filter tips with the tip cut off using sterile/clean scissors to prevent clogging of the tip and avoid shearing forces on the beads.Note: Preparing 10% extra beads will also limit the possibility of running out of beads in the last aliquot due to pipetting variability. For this reason, the protocol says \u201cnumber of samples\u00a0+ 10%\u201d in some steps.\nPlace the tube with beads in a magnetic rack, wait until beads are collected and remove the clear supernatant.\nWash the beads with RIPA thrice.\nAdd 800\u00a0\u03bcL of RIPA.\nResuspend beads by inverting tubes 30 times and vortex 3\u20134\u00a0s at low setting. Pulse spin to eject buffer from the lid (no more than 1000\u00a0g for 5 s).

At some point the aqueous phase will form a bubble on the side of the tube, which is easier to collect with a pipette. If you accidentally collect the lower organic phase or interface, follow troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 4: Organic phase.\nDilute RNase (Roche, 11119915001) 1:10 in TE, add 2\u00a0\u03bcL to each sample and incubate for 10\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C.\nTake 18\u00a0\u03bcL of each sample and add 2\u00a0\u03bcL of DNA gel loading buffer 10\u00d7.Note: We recommend using a reduced amount of dye in the DNA gel loading buffer because during the gel run the bromophenol blue can overlap with the fragments of interest, interfering with the visualization under UV light.\nLoad 6\u00a0\u03bcL of gene ruler mix (1 \u03bcL of gene ruler (Thermo Fisher, SM0311), 1 \u03bcL of DNA gel loading buffer 10 \u00d7 and 4 \u03bcL of deionized water) into the first well and 15 \u03bcL of samples + DNA gel loading\u00a0buffer\u00a0into the other wells.\nNote: Scale down the amount of loaded sample if you have lower volume of wells.\nRun the gel at 200\u00a0V for 20\u00a0min in Bio-Rad Wide Mini-Sub Cell GT System (adjust the time and voltage for other gel chambers accordingly) or until the bromophenol blue reaches about 2/3 of the gel.\nStain the gel with Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) (Sigma, E1510).\nNote: Post-staining is preferable as it results in a clearer image.\nAlternatives: You can also use SYBR\u2122 Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S7563) instead of EtBr as a safer and more sensitive alternative for DNA staining.\nTransfer the gel in special EtBr container (work under the fume hood). Pour approximatively 100\u00a0mL of TAE\u00a0+ EtBr (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) in the container with the gel.\nNote: Adjust the volume depending on the size/height of the gel to cover the gel completely with TAE\u00a0+ EtBr.\nIncubate for 30\u00a0min on a rocking platform.\nCritical: Cover the container with aluminum foil as EtBr is light sensitive and make sure that the rocking is gentle, to avoid spills of EtBr.\nImage the stained DNA in a Bio-Rad Gel Doc EZ Imager and check the fragment size.\nAlternatives: You can use other gel imagers.Critical: Do not touch anything with the gloves you used to work with EtBr and trash them every time you are not working with EtBr.\nTrash the gel in a specialized EtBr chemical disposal. Rinse with water and 70% Ethanol all the containers contaminated with EtBr.\nThe DNA fragment size should be below 1000\u00a0bp (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).

Therefore, the MYC promoter was chosen as a positive control.\nNote: The MYC promoter should work as a positive control in all cell lines where MYC is highly expressed.\nNote: When designing additional primers for qPCR before library preparation, we advise to select regions upstream the TSSs of highly expressed genes.\nNote: The qPCR will work with conventional primers. In the first qPCR cycle the strand complementary to the TOP1cc (with free ends) will anneal with the primer and will be subjected to polymerase synthesis.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1868_16.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1868_17.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1868_18.csv\nLibrary preparation and sequencing\nTiming: 3 h\nWe provide an example of one of the library preparation strategies, ThruPLEX DNA-seq kit, which\u00a0we\u00a0have used with this protocol. You can skip this section if you choose another library preparation kit. However, please read the information below marked CRITICAL.Critical: During the catalytic cycle TOP1 cleaves the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA and forms a covalent link between its tyrosyl residue and the 3\u2032 end of the DNA molecule. This covalent link can block adapter ligation during library preparation. Thus, it is required a suitable kit for library preparation. In case of ThruPLEX DNA-seq protocol, stem-loop adapters are ligated to the 5\u2032 end of DNA. Even with 3\u2032 end blocked by a covalently bound tyrosyl residue, the library preparation will work for the complementary strand (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1868-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. ThruPLEX library preparation works with TOP1 tyrosyl residue bound to the 3\u2032 of a DNA molecule\nNote: If you aim to detect TOP2ccs, after IP with anti-TOP2 antibody and DNA purification, an additional step of Exonuclease VII (NEB, M0379S) treatment and purification is required for removing the covalently bound tyrosyl residue which can block both 5\u2032 ends of DNA and completely prevent adapter ligation and amplification during library preparation (Das et\u00a0al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nBased on the Qubit DNA quantifications (step 49) take equal DNA amounts of each sample and transfer to 200 \u03bcL PCR tubes. The volume should not exceed 10\u00a0\u03bcL and the optimal DNA amount is 1\u201310\u00a0ng.

If you are sequencing with another machine, follow the manufacturer\u2019s manual.\nNote: The final diluted libraries have low molarity, we advise to prepare the library pool right before sequencing and avoid storage for long periods. The library pool can be stored for a day at \u221220\u00b0C.\nTake an aliquot of library pool for sequencing with NextSeq550.\nFollow NextSeq550 Denature and Dilute Libraries Guide from Illumina (link[href=https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/system_documentation/nextseq/nextseq-denature-dilute-libraries-guide-15048776-09.pdf]).\nAt the end of a sequencing run, download BCL or fastq files for further processing.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample procurement\nThis section describes the isolation of lipidome and metabolome fractions from patient-derived\u00a0medulloblastoma (MB) tumor samples and donor-derived NSCs. Procurement of these samples is performed under approval of a human integrated research ethics board, and in collaboration\u00a0with a clinical team that will provide surgically resected tumor tissue(s), or donor-derived fetal tissue(s). Collection and establishment of MB tumorspheres and NSC neurospheres should be performed as described in Chokshi et\u00a0al. (2020) and Suk et\u00a0al. (2022), respectively.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nNote: Prepare process blanks at the same time as sample procurement. A process blank is comprised of all sample preparation components (excluding the sample itself) and is subjected to the same sample preparation steps. In this case, the process blank should not have any cells, but should have all the reagents used in sample procurement and should be subjected to the same sample preparation steps as described in the following sections. Process blanks ensure that detected metabolites are derived from the biological sample itself.\nSample preparation for LC-MS analysis of metabolome and lipidome\nTiming: approx. 1\u20132\u00a0h depending on number of samples, plus 12\u201316\u00a0h sample drying time.\nThis section describes the extraction of metabolites and lipids from donor-derived human NSCs, and patient-derived MB stem-like tumor cells. This extraction method was adapted from the methyl tert-butyl ether-methanol (MTBE) method described in Matyash et\u00a0al. (2008) and Ding et\u00a0al. (2021).7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nCritical: The solvents (i.e., acetonitrile, methanol, MTBE) used in this section are flammable and volatile. Safety goggles, gloves and lab coats are to be worn while handling solvents. Ensure there is adequate ventilation place prior to starting this section of the protocol.\nCritical: Extraction solvents, samples, and pipette tips should be kept chilled throughout the extraction process.Note: The sample preparation protocol has been optimized for the extraction of metabolites and lipids from a cell pellet of \u223c1\u00d7106. The volumes in this protocol can be scaled according to the number of cells harvested.\nRe-suspend cell pellets in 255\u00a0\u03bcL of ice-cold H2O/methanol (30:225, v/v).\nAdd 10\u00a0\u03bcL of UltimateSPLASH ONE (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) to each sample.\nCritical: UltimateSPLASH ONE is provided in volatile solvents (i.e., dichloromethane and methanol). Appropriate PPE (i.e., laboratory coats, goggles etc.) are to be worn while handling. UltimateSPLASH ONE internal standard will drip when added to samples. Care should be taken to prevent loss of the internal standard.\nNote: It is recommended to use isotopically labeled internal standards (like UltimateSPLASH ONE) to achieve the highest confidence level of identification. No analogous comprehensive internal standard mix is available for polar metabolites; however, internal standards should be added for known metabolites of interest. Alternatively, the TruQuant Yeast Extract Semi-targeted QC Workflow Kit (IROA Technologies, Sea Girt, NJ, USA) have been used as internal standards for the polar metabolome.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nVortex samples for 30 s.\nSonicate samples for 5\u00a0min in a cold-water bath.\nAdd 750\u00a0\u03bcL of ice-cold MTBE to each sample.\nVortex samples for 30 s.\nShake tubes samples for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C at 650 RPM in the Thermomixer R (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) temperature block.\nAdd 188\u00a0\u03bcL of LC-MS water to each tube to induce phase separation.\nVortex samples for 30 s.\nCentrifuge samples for 20\u00a0min at 16,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at 4\u00b0C.\nTransfer 700\u00a0\u03bcL of the top (non-polar) component of each sample to a new microcentrifuge tube.

Sample normalization is crucial for minimizing non-biological variation. Normalization of metabolite/lipid extracts to DNA levels is recommended as it correlates well with cell number.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] The DNA content is quantified from the residual cell pellets that remain after sample preparation. Other common normalization methods include the use of total protein levels or cell count. Normalization to protein content has been reported to have large variability in metabolite-extracted samples.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nCritical: Cancer cells are often aneuploid. The ploidy of the cell line or cells needs to be taken into account when normalizing to DNA levels.\nFrom the remaining cell pellets, remove as much excess solvent as possible.\nAllow the cell pellets to air-dry the excess solvent at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C until dry.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 200\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00a0M urea and 0.2% SDS.\nSolubilize the cell pellets at 85\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min at 650\u00a0rpm in the Thermomixer R.\nOnce the cell pellets are dissolved, quantify the DNA content in the solubilized samples in triplicate according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the Quant-iT 1\u00d7 dsDNA BR Assay Kits, high sensitivity (HS) and broad range (BR) (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA).Using the quantified DNA values, adjust dried sample reconstitution volumes accordingly.\nCritical: Dried lipid fractions are typically resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcL of isopropanol:acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) for every 6\u00a0\u03bcg of DNA for the lipidomics method. Dried aqueous fractions are typically resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of water:acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) for every 6\u00a0\u03bcg of DNA.\nLC-MS analysis\nTiming: 17\u00a0min/sample for lipidomics method; 21\u00a0min/sample for HILIC method\nPrepare mobile phase A and B for the corresponding LC-MS method according to the \u201cmaterials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]\u201d section.

LC-MS mobile phases can be stored at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C just prior to use.\nPurge the LC lines with the mobile phases.\nEquilibrate the LC system by running the mobile phase A and B at starting conditions.\nAllow source parameters to reach desired conditions.\nConduct the necessary LC-MS pre-run checks according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines before running any analysis.\nNote: Pre-run checks of the instrumentation include minimizing background signal by cleaning the ionization source, performing mass calibration, and monitoring pump pressures and spray stability. These pre-run checks help to ensure the acquisition of high-quality data.\nCritical: Dried samples should be resuspended just prior to LC-MS analysis to avoid sample degradation. Reconstitution solvents and reconstituted samples should be maintained at 4\u00b0C.\nResuspend the dried fractions in DNA-normalized volumes isopropanol:acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) for the lipidomics method or water:acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) for the HILIC method.\nPrepare LC-MS vials with glass inserts or conical vials for maximum recovery and transfer the resuspended samples to them.\nIn a separate sample vial, transfer an aliquot (\u223c5\u00a0\u03bcL) from each sample to make a pooled quality control (QC) samples for column conditioning and analysis stability monitoring.\nReconstitute the process blank samples (See sample procurement[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section) with the same solvents as the samples.Prepare a simple blank vial with the same solvent as the samples.\nNote: Blank and QC injections are needed to ensure reproducibility and stability of the instrument. Blank and QC samples are to be monitored through the course of the experiment for carry-over. Signal intensities, retention time, and pump pressure should be monitored. During acquisition, blank and QC samples can be monitored in real-time in FreeStyle (Xcalibur) or other vendor software.\nTransfer all vials to the autosampler, noting the position of each sample in the autosampler.\nIn Xcalibur, click on \u201cSequence Setup View\u201d.\nBuild the sample worklist by filling in the fields according to the headers for each sample. This includes Sample ID, File Name, Path, Instrument Method, Position, Injection Volume, etc.\nRandomize the injection order of the samples to avoid order-dependent biases.\nNote: An analysis should begin with a minimum of three simple blank injections. Blank vials are needed to check for the presence of contaminants and carry-over. This is followed by 8\u201310 QC loads for LC column conditioning. Following the injection of column conditioning samples, several simple blanks (2\u20133) and process blank samples (2\u20133) should be analyzed. Blank and process blank samples should also be periodically injected to monitor sample carry-over. Once complete, a final QC sample should be injected prior to sample analysis. Pooled QCs are injected regularly throughout the run and at the end of a run to monitor reproducibility and stability of the instrument. A blank injection should also be conducted immediately following any QC injection.\nSubmit the sequence worklist.\nLC-MS analysis using AcquireX\nTiming: 17\u00a0min/injection for lipidomics method; 21\u00a0min/injection for HILIC methodAcquireX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) is a generalized data acquisition workflow that generates inclusion and exclusion lists from precursor m/z values and enables acquisition of MS/MS spectra through iterative injections in an automated manner.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] This results in more MS/MS spectra than standard data-dependent methods, which improves compound identification. The AcquireX acquisition can be used in both the untargeted lipidomics and metabolomics workflows to maximize MS/MS spectra acquisition.\nClick on \u201cAcquireX View\u201d to build the worklist for an AcquireX analysis.\nSelect the \u201cDeep Scan\u201d workflow.\nNote: Deep Scan is one of four data acquisition workflows found in AcquireX. It allows for automated generation of both inclusion and exclusion lists. Using these inclusion and exclusion lists, the workflow determines whether MS/MS is acquired based on user-defined parameters like signal intensity.\nDefine the \u201cExperiment Folder, \u201cExperiment Name\u201d, \u201cFull Scan Method, and \u201cMSn Template Method\u201d.\nNote: The \u201cFull Scan Method\u201d in AcquireX is defined as the method that encompasses the\u00a0entire mass range and focuses on data acquisition at the MS1 level. The parameters for the \u201cFull Scan Method\u201d are identical to the method described previously in this protocol\u00a0except for the exclusion of the MS/MS fragmentation parameters. The MSn Template\u00a0is identical to the full data-dependent MS/MS method described earlier in the protocol.\nSet the AcquireX Experiment Parameters to the appropriate values (Table\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3152_12.csv\nAdd three header blank injections of the solvent blank and define the second header blank as the \u201cExclusion Reference\u201d.\nAdd three deep scan injections of the pooled QC sample to the end of the header blank injections.\nNote: Three deep scan injections provide deep coverage of the metabolome/lipidome of a particular sample. Additional deep scan injections provide only minimal gain in MS/MS spectra as low intensity precursor ions generate low quality and intensity spectra.Save and submit the AcquireX worklist.\nMonitor the sample files throughout the entire analysis to ensure instrument stability.\nNote: Monitoring samples and pooled QCs involve checking pressures to ensure stability. The base peak chromatograms of pooled QCs should also be monitored for retention shifts and changes in signal intensity. Internal standards spiked into the pooled QCs can be used as marker compounds to ensure retention time and signal reproducibility. For a given internal standard, retention time shifts should be within 10\u00a0s for the lipidomics method and 30\u00a0s for the HILIC method. It is recommended that signal intensities of a given internal standard should have coefficient of variations (CV) <15% when comparing repeated injections. CV values are dependent on the abundance of a given metabolite/lipid. As a result, metabolite/lipid levels near the limit of detection may have CVs>15%. Matrix effects are contributors to retention time shifts. They can be identified by comparing the retention time of spiked internal standard in a sample with the retention time of the internal standard alone. Matrix effects should be noted if retention times are used for metabolite/lipid identification.\nData processing using Compound Discoverer\nTiming: 2\u20136\u00a0h depending on the number of files and type of analyses being conducted\nCompound Discoverer (v3.3) is a mass spectrometry data processing and analysis software used for the investigation of metabolites and lipids. It performs peak picking, retention time alignment, MS/MS matching, and local/online database searching to identify metabolites and lipids. It also provides data visualization tools and statistical analysis capabilities to aid in data interpretation.\nOpen Compound Discoverer (v3.3) and click on \u201cNew Study and Analysis\u201d.\nDefine the \u201cStudy Name\u201d and the \u201cStudies Folder\u201d.\nSelect the desired template workflow to be used in the analysis.Note: Compound Discoverer provides template metabolomics and lipidomics workflows that can be customized based on various parameters.

Common statistical tests include Student\u2019s t-test and ANOVA with post hoc Tukey\u2019s HSD. A common multiple test correction method is Benjamini-Hochberg correction. In datasets where normality or homoscedasticity assumptions are violated, non-parametric statistical tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test can be considered.\nCalculate the fold-changes (FCs) between the groups being compared.\nUsing p-values and FCs, select significantly different (e.g., p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 with multiple test correction) metabolic features with large FCs (e.g., FC\u00a0>\u00a01.5) for identification.Alternatives: The process of identifying metabolites and lipids is very time-consuming. Thus, it is recommended to have an organized approach to checking identifications. One method is to specifically identify only significantly changing metabolic features. Alternatively, metabolites/lipids in specific metabolic pathways of interest (i.e., glycolysis, TCA cycle) can be selected for identification.\nIdentification of metabolites and lipids\nTiming: varies\nThis section describes strategies for identifying metabolites and lipids from an untargeted metabolomics or lipidomics experiment. Compound Discoverer searches acquired MS/MS spectra against local and online spectral libraries (e.g., mzCloud) to make identifications. Spectral libraries contain reference MS/MS spectra, which can be matched against acquired MS/MS data. Metabolites/lipids identified using this method cannot be completely relied upon due to the presence of in-source fragments, adducts, and co-isolating ions. Because of this, manual curation/annotation of MS/MS data is often required using mirror plots for high confidence identifications.\nCritical: The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) categorizes the identification of metabolites into five confidence levels.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] The highest confidence level of identification (MSI level 1) requires a reference standard to confirm the structure. Reference standards are not available for every single metabolite/lipid; thus, MS/MS data can be sufficient for putative identification if it matches spectra from literature or spectral libraries (MSI level 2). Typically, identified metabolites and lipids should have at least MSI level 2 and the level of identification should be reported.\nFrom the completed Compound Discoverer Result file, check the MS/MS spectra of individual metabolites and lipids with reference MS/MS spectra.Note: The performance of these computational tools for identification can vary depending on the metabolite and its fragmentation pattern. Thus, there is no single search tool or algorithm that can reliably match experimental MS/MS data to those found in databases. Generally, an ideal MS/MS match has the correct diagnostic fragments within a small error (<5 ppm) and limited co-isolating/contaminating ions at similar collision energies.\nIf isotopically labeled/reference standards are available, analyzing them using identical LC-MS methods to confirm retention time and MS/MS provides the highest confidence level of metabolite identification (MSI Level 1). If the resulting retention time the reference standard does not match, then additional analyses may be needed to determine the metabolite identity as matrix effects can contribute to retention time shifts.\nNote: Isotopically labeled standards have the same retention times, but m/z shifts corresponding to the incorporated isotopic atoms.\nNote: The combinatorial nature of lipids makes it impossible for authentic reference standards to be available for every single lipid. For species that do not have standards, natural lipid mixes could be used instead. Natural lipid mixes consist of lipids belonging to the same class extracted from a specific source (i.e., Ceramide (Brain) Cat. No. 860052, Avanti Polar Lipids). Lipid species of the same class fragment in a predictable manner. Rules for lipid fragmentation have been previously established and should be used to enhance lipid identifications.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\nValidate the fragmentation spectra of lipids using reference standards or lipid mixes.\nPlot mass-to-charge vs. retention time plots (m/z vs. RT) to ensure identified lipids belong to the same class.Note: In reversed-phase chromatography, lipid species within the same class will elute in a linear manner. Retention time will increase as the length of acyl chains increases. Lipids that violate this trend likely do not belong in the given lipid class. The use of both fragmentation patterns and retention time trends strengthens the lipid identifications when authentic reference standards are unavailable.\nCorrect any incorrect or ambiguous annotations provided by Compound Discoverer.\nData visualization and interpretation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes data visualization methods used to understand and depict metabolomics/lipidomics\u00a0data. Clear and visually appealing figures simplifies data interpretation. Data plots described here can be generated using programming languages like R and Python.\nOnce metabolite/lipid identifications are complete, export the Compound Discoverer Result file with peak areas as a CSV file.\nGenerate boxplots using peak areas to compare the relative levels of metabolites of interests between groups. This can be done using the ggplot2 package.\nGenerate principal component analysis (PCA) plots. This can be generated using the ggplot2 and ggfortify packages.\nPerform log-transformation and z-score standardization (auto-scaling) on the exported peak areas.\nNote: The scaling and transformation of metabolomics data is dependent on the data acquired. It is important to note that no single scaling and transformation method is suitable for all datasets.\nFrom the analyzed data, perform hierarchal clustering to represent the data.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3152-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Fatty Acid Composition Heatmaps (FACHs) reveal a decrease in saturation levels in the diglycerides of MB cells compared to NSCsThe x-axis of the heatmap depicts the total number of carbons while the y-axis depicts the total number of double bonds on the fatty acids of a particular lipid class. The color scale corresponds to the proportion by which a lipid species makes up the total signal intensity of the lipid class. The gray bars outlining each FACH depict histograms representing the proportional abundance of total carbons or total double bonds for any given lipid species within a class. The lines on the FACHs show the mean fatty acid composition (number of carbons and number of double bonds) of a given lipid class, considering the relative abundance of each individual lipid.\nAlternatives: Pathway analysis (i.e., MetPA, MSEA etc.) can also be done to determine the metabolite classes and metabolic pathways enriched in a particular sample group.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] It is important to note that the method in which the data is shown depends on the content being conveyed.Alternatives: Information about individual lipid classes\u2019 selectivity for specific fatty acids (chain length and saturation) can be gained by creating Fatty Acid Composition Heatmaps (FACHs). FACHs depict all lipid species within a class based on the number of carbons and double bonds within its acyl chains (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The colors on the heatmap represent the proportion (percentage) of lipid species containing a specific number of carbons and double bonds within a specific lipid class. Using FACHs, shifts in fatty acid elongation and saturation levels can be visualized and interpreted. This analysis is independent of the amount of sample injected and the absolute concentration levels of lipids within each class, as only the proportions of the FA composition within the same lipid class are considered and compared. This ultimately allows comparisons between different types of cells (size and morphology). Source code for the generation of FACHs is available in our Zenodo data repository.", "All procedures performed in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The exams can be performed using either a sector array (sometimes colloquially referred to as a \"phased array\") or a low-frequency curvilinear transducer based on the sonographers' preference. For the figures and scans, a curvilinear probe was used for the anterior sagittal views, while a sector array probe was used for the gastric body scans. The commercial details of the probes are provided in the Table of Materials.\n1. Subxiphoid sagittal gastric antrum views (aka \"Subxiphoid Views\")\nSupine view\n\t\nPatient positioning: place the patient in the supine position. If the patient is unable to tolerate being fully supine, up to 30 degrees head up is an acceptable alternative.\nProbe selection: select any low-frequency probe (e.g., curvilinear or sector array) (see Table of Materials).\nMode selection: set the preset to abdominal mode.\nProbe placement\n\t\t\nPlace the probe on the patient's sub-xiphoid region in the sagittal plane (Figure 1).\nOrient the probe marker in a cephalad direction.\nImage optimization\n\t\t\nFan the probe from the patient's left to right until one can visualize the following structures on the screen: (1) liver on the left side of the screen; (2) pulsatile aorta in the long-axis deep in the image; and (2) gastric antrum just caudal and deep to the superficial liver edge (Figure 2).Ensure the abdominal aorta is positioned at the deeper edge of the image. If the inferior vena cava (IVC) is seen instead, correct the ultrasound beam angle if angled too far towards the patient's right. In this case, visualize the stomach at the pylorus level rather than the antrum. If that happens, adjust by fanning leftward until the aorta becomes visible. This is the appropriate position to analyze the gastric antrum (Figure 3).\n\t\t\tNOTE: If only the stomach is visible at the IVC level and not the aorta, the qualitative sonographic data is still valuable, but remember that this view has lower sensitivity for detecting a \"high-risk\" stomach. In such cases, a volume assessment will probably underestimate gastric volume (Figure 3).\nIdentify the muscularis propria (hypoechoic, thickest gastric wall layer) to ensure focusing on the stomach. Large, dilated bowel can be misidentified as the gastric antrum (Figure 4).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The pancreas may be visible posterior to the gastric antrum (Figure 2).\nImage acquisition: click on Acquire to save a video clip of this sonographic view.\nRight lateral decubitus view\n\t\nPatient positioning: position the patient in the right lateral decubitus (Figure 5).\nProbe selection: follow step 1.1.2.\nMode selection: follow step 1.1.3.\nProbe placement: follow step 1.1.4.\nImage optimization: follow step 1.1.5.\nImage acquisition: follow step 1.1.6.\nQuantitative estimation of gastric volume\n\t\t\nIf the gastric antrum appears to contain only clear liquids, quantify the total gastric volume by obtaining an image of the gastric antrum as described above, with the patient in the RLD position (refer to step 1.2.5).\nWhen a view of the gastric antrum is obtained during its maximal expansion, freeze the image.Activate the Trace tool and trace out the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum along the outer hyperechoic layer of the wall representing the serosa (Figure 6).\n\t\t\tNOTE: An antral area greater than 10 cm2is unlikely consistent with normal baseline volume and suggests a \"full stomach\".\nClick on Save.\nEstimate the gastric fluid volume using the following formula13: stomach volume (mL) = 27 + 14.6 ACSA (in RLD) (cm 2) \u2212 1.28 x age (years).\n\t\t\t\u200bNOTE: This formula has been validated for clear liquids in the antrum. This formula was also validated in a separate study of morbidly obese individuals14.\n2.

The spleen is identified by its rounded capsular shape. The left hemidiaphragm appears as a hyperechoic line, superior to the spleen, and moves with the normal respiratory cycle.\nOnce the spleen is identified, fan posteriorly to identify the kidney, which will appear as the oblong structure inferior and posterior to the spleen.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The spleen offers less of an acoustic window than the liver does on the right abdomenOnce these landmarks are identified, angle the transducer in an anterior direction to obtain a view of the gastric body (Figure 7).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The anatomic structures will likely shift as the diaphragm moves.

Tissue is dissociated into small epithelial fragments that are embedded into extracellular matrix \u201cdomes\u201d using basement membrane extract (BME) and then supplemented with medium containing growth factors for organoid expansion.\nSmall intestine and colon biopsies are both suitable organoid culture sources. Because organoids maintain region-specific characteristics, pooling biopsies from different intestinal regions or different donors is not recommended. In the case of CRC biopsies, a paired normal sample should be collected from surrounding healthy tissue.\nMaterials\nFresh tissue biopsy from human small intestine or colon (healthy or tumor tissue)\n70% (v/v) ethanol\nAdvDMEM+++ (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-rec-0001])\nPrimocin (InvivoGen, cat. no. ant-pm-1)\nCollagenase type II (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Collect tissue sample from the tissue sample source site in a 50-ml Falcon tube containing 25 ml AdvDMEM+++ and 100 \u03bcg/ml Primocin. Keep at 4\u00b0C until use.\nUse 30 mg tissue for optimal organoid line establishment. For increased efficiency, isolate tissue within 24 hr after surgery. Avoid freezing the tissue, as this will result in cell death.\n2. Start up the biosafety cabinet. Disinfect the work area surface and pipets by spraying with 70% ethanol and allow to air dry.3. Prepare fresh digestion medium for each tissue sample: Aliquot 5 ml AdvDMEM+++ into a 15-ml plastic tube and add 5 mg/ml collagenase type II and 10 \u00b5M RhoKi. Mix by inverting and store on ice until use.\n4. Transfer tissue to a 10-cm Petri dish.\nOptionally, excise a tissue piece and place in a cryovial. Snap-freeze and store in liquid nitrogen for additional DNA/RNA analysis and/or fix tissue for histology.\n5. Using two scalpels, mince tissue into pieces of \u223c1 mm3. Add the 5 ml digestion medium and mix by pipetting.\n6. Transfer digestion medium with tissue to a 15-ml plastic tube. Rinse the dish with the medium, returning the medium and all tissue pieces to the tube.\n7. Close tube lid and seal with Parafilm. Place tube tilted at a low angle on an orbital shaker. Digest tissue for 30 to 45 min at 37\u00b0C and 140 rpm.\nCheck the turbidity of the solution regularly. If the tissue is dissociated (typically after \u223c30 min), the solution will look turbid without any large clumps.\n8. Pipet the digested tissue onto a 100-\u00b5m cell strainer on a 50-ml plastic tube. Use a 5-ml pipet to help pass the cell suspension through the filter.\nLarge tissue pieces will be retained on the filter.\n9. Rinse the strainer with 5 ml AdvDMEM+++ and transfer the solution (total 10 ml) to a fresh 15-ml plastic tube.\n10. Centrifuge 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Aspirate the supernatant.\nIf red blood cells are present (observed as a dark red pellet), resuspend the pellet in 3 ml red blood cell lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. After incubation, add 5 ml AdvDMEM+++ to the cell solution, centrifuge 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C, and aspirate the supernatant.11. Wash pellet three times with 10 ml AdvDMEM+++. Each time, spin 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C, and aspirate the supernatant.\n12. Resuspend final pellet in undiluted BME.\nThe volume of BME depends on the pellet size. Usually, a pellet from \u223c30 mg primary tissue is plated in 300 \u00b5l BME. Cells plated at the right density have enhanced efficiency of organoid culture establishment. Plating too densely will result in increased cell death at the core of the dome.\nPlate cells and grow as organoids\n13. Plate 50 \u00b5l cell suspension per well as multiple \u223c15-\u00b5l droplets in a prewarmed 24-well cell culture plate.\n14. Place plate upside-down in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator and allow droplets to solidify for 20 min.\nAs the BME solidifies, the cells/organoids will spread over the volume of the BME, locating closer to the dome surface. This will maximize nutrient exchange and minimize organoid attachment to the plate. This also applies to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002].\n15. Carefully add 500 \u00b5l expansion medium supplemented with 10 \u00b5M RhoKi to each well and return the plate to the incubator.\nWhen establishing tumor lines, use expansion medium depleted of Wnt3A-CM or Wnt surrogate. In this way, tumor cells with acquired Wnt pathway independence will be selected in culture.\n16. After \u223c1 week, expand organoids by mechanical disruption and splitting (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002]).Due to donor-to-donor variability, the time required for a human intestinal organoid culture to reach confluence varies among organoid lines. Seven days is a standard estimation, but expansion time should be determined empirically for each individual line. Passaging organoids too early will result in increased cost in materials and suboptimal expansion speed. Passaging too late may result in spontaneously differentiating organoids, decreased cell viability, and suboptimal expansion. See Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0001] for a reference for estimating the optimal time to perform the first split and expansion. This also applies to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/76a10624-b34b-4c84-a65f-4afae7c75fb1/cpim106-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nEstablishment of human colon organoid lines from fresh biopsy of normal tissue. Representative images from two organoid lines. Cells are shown after establishment of cultures (left), before the first split (middle), and after the first split (right). P indicates passage number; d indicates days after seeding or passage; scale bars, 0.5 mm.The process of mechanical splitting and passage is similar for organoids from human small intestine and colon due to the high similarity of these two organoid types. In short, organoids are recovered from the basement membrane matrix and broken mechanically into smaller fragments. The fragments are then resuspended in fresh BME and replated. They will self-assemble as new organoids, and the stem cells and transit-amplifying cells present in them will continue to proliferate, giving rise to a fully grown expanded organoid culture (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0da71a91-fd5d-4cc9-bb83-7dc053315a45/cpim106-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nMechanical splitting and expansion of human intestinal organoids.

Using a P1000 pipette, flush the organoids with 1 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++ to disrupt the BME droplets. Collect the organoids and transfer to a 15-ml plastic tube containing 4 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++.3. Centrifuge the organoids 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.\nDuring this step, undissolved BME often accumulates over the organoid pellet as a cloudy mesh. It is important to remove as much BME as possible without taking the organoids. If organoids do not separate from the BME, resuspend the pellet with the BME mesh in the AdvDMEM+++, incubate on ice for 10 min, and then repeat step 2.\n4. Resuspend pellet in 1 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++ using a P1000 pipette.\n5. Attach a sterile 10-\u03bcl pipette tip to the tip of a glass Pasteur pipette (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0002]). Pass the organoids through the pipette opening five to ten times until large clumps are no longer visible.\n6. Add 4 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++ and centrifuge 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.\nFoam formation at this step usually leads to loss of cells. To avoid this, pipette the cell solution against the middle part of the tube wall.\nAlternatively, mechanical disruption can be done using a fire-polished glass pipette with the tip narrowed down to a diameter of \u223c0.5-1 mm using a Bunsen burner.\n7. Resuspend pellet in 300-400 \u03bcl BME using a P1000 pipette.\nSome residual AdvDMEM+++ is acceptable in the resuspension step, but the final BME concentration should be 75%-100%.\nAvoid bubble formation, as this will render the BME droplet unstable and lead to its disruption before splitting time.\n8. Dispense 100 \u03bcl suspension per well as multiple \u223c15-\u03bcl droplets in a prewarmed 12-well culture plate (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0002]).\nSee Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-tbl-0001] for dome numbers and volumes in different plate formats. The split ratio for a fully grown culture is typically 1:3 to 1:4 (of BME volume).9. Flip the plate upside down and place plate in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 20 min to let domes solidify.\n10. Add 1 ml expansion medium and keep in the incubator, refreshing the medium every 2-3 days.\nUnder these conditions, organoids containing proliferating stem cells should look cystic and have a thin wall (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0002], upper panel). If organoids look dense and have a thick wall, they show signs of cell differentiation (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0002], lower panel), which will lead to loss of the cultures.\n11. After 7 days, expand organoids further by repeating this process.\nAs mentioned previously, the optimal time between passages varies and must be determined empirically for each line.This protocol describes ways to differentiate organoids to the various cell types of the small intestinal and colonic epithelia. By withdrawing growth factors, which enforce a stem cell state, and adding components that skew differentiation trajectories, different types and proportions of mature cells can be obtained within 5 days. These mature cell types can be used for functional studies of the human gut epithelium.\nAdditional materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0001])\nEstablished human intestinal organoid culture (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002])\nDifferentiation medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-rec-0003])\n1. Aspirate medium from one well containing an established organoid culture grown to an average size of 100 \u00b5m (usually 5 days after splitting).\nSmaller organoids are sensitive to some of the small molecules used for differentiation at later steps.\n2. Add 1 ml prewarmed AdvDMEM+++ and incubate at least 15 min in the 37\u00b0C incubator to allow diffusion of growth factors from the BME domes.\nFor domes larger than 15 \u00b5l, the incubation time must be extended to allow proper diffusion.\nVolumes are based on a 12-well plate. For other plate formats, see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-tbl-0001].\n3.

Refresh differentiation medium the next day to wash away any residual growth factors. Continue to refresh differentiation medium every 2-3 days.\nAs organoids differentiate, some cells undergo apoptosis and are shed to the organoid lumen. Together with more granular differentiated cells, this results in a darker appearance of the organoids, with thicker organoid walls and accumulation of debris in the organoid lumen. This can be used as an indicator of the progress of differentiation (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0003],B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0003]).\nAfter 5-7 days, fully differentiated cells will be present in the organoids and the organoids can be used for downstream assays. Organoid viability can decrease substantially within days after terminal differentiation, so assays should be performed as early as possible for optimal results.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f1c8f28b-aec5-4cd2-8403-b4305761eac1/cpim106-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nDifferentiation of human intestinal organoids.

Scale bar, 0.1 mm.This protocol details the steps for cryopreservation and thawing of intestinal and colon organoids. Cryopreservation is especially advisable when storing organoids for years in liquid nitrogen, but also for shipping organoid lines on dry ice. Briefly, organoids are freed from the BME and resuspended in freezing medium. To restart the cultures, organoids are carefully thawed, washed, and plated in BME domes. Thawed organoids are passaged according to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002]. After one passage, organoids should have normal growth characteristics and can be used for any downstream assay.\nAdditional materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0001])\nEstablished organoid culture (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002])\n2\u00d7 freezing medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-rec-0005])\nCryopreservation tubes\nFreezing container\n37\u00b0C water bath\nFreeze organoids\n1. Passage organoids 2-3 days before cryopreservation (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002]).\nFor optimal recovery, small organoids in exponential growth phase should be frozen.\n2. Remove medium from one well of a 12-well plate of established organoid culture.\nThe process can be scaled up or down using different plate formats. For a guide to other formats, see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-tbl-0001].\n3. Using a P1000 pipette, flush the organoids with 1 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++ to disrupt the BME droplets. Collect the organoids and transfer to a 15-ml plastic tube containing 4 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++.\n4. Centrifuge organoids 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.\nDuring this step, undissolved BME often accumulates over the organoid pellet as a cloudy mesh. It is important to remove as much BME as possible without taking the organoids. If this is not possible, resuspend the pellet in 10 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++, incubate on ice for 10 min, and then repeat step 3.\n5. Resuspend pellet in 1 volume of ice-cold AdvDMEM+++ using a P1000 pipette, then add 1 volume of 2\u00d7 freezing medium dropwise under constant shaking.The volume used in this step depends on the number of cryopreservation tubes being prepared and the organoid number per vial. For one densely plated well of a 12-well plate, 500 \u00b5l each of AdvDMEM+++ and 2\u00d7 freezing medium are recommended.\nEnsure slow addition of freezing medium to avoid an osmotic shock to the cells.\n6. Transfer 1-ml aliquots of organoid suspension to properly labeled cryopreservation tubes.\n7. Place tubes in a freezing container and freeze at \u221280\u00b0C overnight.\n8.

Prepare AdvDMEM+++ and labeled 15-ml tubes while organoids are still frozen to minimize thawing and processing times.\nDelays will lead to a decreased recovery rate.\n10.

Transfer thawed organoid suspension to 15-ml Falcon tubes (one per cryotube) and add 10 ml AdvDMEM+++ dropwise under constant shaking.\nEnsure slow addition of AdvDMEM+++ to avoid an osmotic shock to the cells.\n13. Centrifuge 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.\n14. Resuspend each cell pellet in 100 \u03bcl BME using a P200 pipette, being careful to avoid bubble formation.\n15. Dispense as \u223c15-\u00b5l drops in a well of a 12-well cell culture suspension plate.\n16. Place the plate upside-down in the incubator for 20 min to let domes solidify.\n17. Add expansion medium and keep in the incubator. Refresh medium every 2-3 days.\nAfter 7 days, organoids can be further expanded as in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002].This protocol describes a way to perform immunofluorescence staining compatible with fluorescence and confocal microscopy. For this purpose, organoids must first be released from the BME without disrupting their 3D architecture. Subsequent fixation, permeabilization, blocking, staining, and washes are performed with the organoids in suspension. This method can be applied to organoids that have been subjected to various experimental conditions.\nMaterials\nEstablished organoid culture (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002])\nFetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Remove and discard medium from one well containing organoids.\nStarting with small organoids will help keep their structure intact. Starting with large and cystic organoids is more likely to result in disruption.\n2. With sterile scissors, cut the opening of a 1000-\u03bcl pipette tip 2-3 mm from its end. Coat the tip and a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with FBS by pipetting 1 ml up and down once.\nCutting the tip is required to avoid disrupting the organoid structure while pipetting. Coating with FBS minimizes adhesion of organoids to plastic surfaces.3. Using the coated pipette tip, pipette 1 ml Cell Recovery Solution to the well, collect the organoids, and transfer to the coated microcentrifuge tube.\nRepeat steps 1-3 for each well of cells to be stained (e.g., for different experimental conditions).\n4. Incubate on ice for 20-30 min, inverting regularly to prevent clumping and heterogeneous BME dissociation.\nCell Recovery Solution dissolves the BME, freeing the organoids without disrupting their structure. Alternatively, the culture can be preincubated with dispase for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Efficient dissolution of BME is key, as remaining BME can result in poor staining and higher background signal.\n5. Monitor BME dissociation under a microscope, stopping when BME is sufficiently dissolved.\n6. Let organoids settle by gravity to the bottom of the tube and remove the supernatant.\nFix and permeabilize organoids\n7. Add 1 ml of 4% formaldehyde and incubate 16 hr at 4\u00b0C (or 2 hr at room temperature) with constant rolling of the tube to ensure homogeneous fixation. Let organoids settle by gravity and remove supernatant.\nCAUTION: Formaldehyde is toxic. Avoid contact with skin and dispose of formaldehyde according to institutional and governmental safety rules.\n8. Add 1 ml permeabilization solution and incubate with constant rolling for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Let organoids settle by gravity and remove supernatant.\nPermeabilization time and temperature may need to be optimized for particular staining methods.\nStain organoids\n9. Add 1 ml blocking solution and incubate 15 min at room temperature under constant rolling. Let organoids settle by gravity and remove supernatant.\n10. Add 200 \u00b5l of 500 ng/ml mouse anti\u2013human KI67 primary antibody in blocking solution and incubate for 16 hr at 4\u00b0C under constant rolling. Let organoids settle by gravity and remove supernatant.\nIf using a different primary antibody, the final concentration must be optimized.11. Resuspend pellet in 1 ml PBS and incubate 10 min at room temperature with constant rolling. Let organoids settle by gravity and remove supernatant. Repeat wash two more times.\n12. Add 200 \u00b5l of 4 \u00b5g/ml Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody, 10 nM phalloidin-Atto 647N, and 2 \u00b5g/ml DAPI in blocking solution and incubate 1-2 hr in the dark at room temperature with constant rolling.\nFrom this point, samples must be kept in the dark to protect the fluorophores from bleaching.\nIf using a different secondary antibody, the final concentration must be optimized.\n13. Wash three times as in step 11.\n14. Wash once with Milli-Q-purified water to prevent crystal formation.\n15. Cut the tip of a low-retention 300-\u03bcl tip 2-3 mm from its end and then coat the tip with FBS by pipetting 200 \u03bcl up and down once.\nThe FBS coating and low-binding tips minimize the number of organoids lost due to adhesion to the plastic surface in the next step.\n16a. For imaging in 96-well plates: Use the coated tip to resuspend organoids in 150-200 \u03bcl PBS and transfer them to one well of a 96-well black glass-bottom plate. For optimal results, image samples immediately after staining (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/52e08407-9a1d-4033-a218-aa337330e3f7/cpim106-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nConfocal immunofluorescence images of human intestinal organoids cultured under expansion conditions.

For imaging on microscope slides: Use the coated tip to resuspend organoids in 50 \u03bcl ProLong Gold mounting solution and transfer them to a microscope slide. Apply Vaseline at the edges of the slide so that the coverslip does not disrupt organoid structure after mounting. Seal the slide using nail polish.\nSlides can be stored at 4\u00b0C, maintaining the fluorescence signal for months.Many downstream applications of organoid cultures (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering, whole-genome sequencing) require generation of clonal cultures derived from single cells. To efficiently generate such cultures, organoids are first dissociated to single cells and seeded sparsely. After 10-15 days, individual organoids are picked using a pipette tip, gently disrupted by enzymatic means, and reseeded. After this step, grown organoids can be mechanically split following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002]. For a general overview, see Figure 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0005]. This protocol can be carried out using established organoids from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002] or organoids subjected to various experimental conditions, like genetic engineering, treatment with mutagens, or other experimental setups requiring WGS.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/52988800-a98c-4b47-897a-32c716b4a494/cpim106-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nClonal expansion of human intestinal organoid cultures.

Remove medium from one well of a 12-well plate culture of established organoid culture.\nThe process can be scaled up or down using different plate formats. For a guide to other formats, see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-tbl-0001].2. Using a P1000 pipette, flush organoids from the well with 1 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++ to disrupt the BME droplets. Collect the organoids and transfer to a 15-ml centrifuge tube containing 4 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++.\n3. Centrifuge 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.\nDuring this step, undissolved BME often accumulates over the organoid pellet as a cloudy mesh. It is important to remove as much BME as possible without taking the organoids. If this is not possible, resuspend the pellet in the AdvDMEM+++, incubate on ice for 10 min, and then repeat step 3.\n4. Resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml prewarmed (37\u00b0C) TrpLE.\n5. Incubate 5 min in a 37\u00b0C water bath, vortexing at regular intervals to increase dissociation. Check progress regularly under a microscope, and stop once the majority of fragments consist of single cells.\n6. Coat a plugged glass Pasteur pipette with FBS to prevent cells from sticking to the glass. Connect a sterile 10-\u03bcl tip to the Pasteur pipette and use to mechanically disrupt the organoid fragments to obtain single cells (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002], step 5).\n7. Check cell suspension under the microscope. If organoids are not dissociated into single cells, repeat steps 5 and 6.\nLong incubation times with TrpLE will lead to increased cell death. It is important to maximize the number of single cells while minimizing dead cells.\n8. Add 4 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++ with 10 \u00b5M RhoKi to the cells.\n9. Move a small fraction of cells to another tube to use as a DAPI-negative control in the FACS gating.\n10. Centrifuge for 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.\n11. Resuspend cells in 0.5 ml ice-cold AdvDMEM+++ supplemented with 10 \u00b5M RhoKi and 2 \u00b5g/ml DAPI. Omit DAPI in the negative control sample.12. Pass cells through the strainer of a 35-\u03bcm mesh-cupped flow cytometry tube. Transport cells to the flow cytometer on ice and protected from light.\nDAPI will only stain apoptotic cells with disrupted cell membrane integrity.\nPerform sorting and start cultures from single live cells\n13. Sort living cells (DAPI-negative) into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0.5 ml AdvDMEM+++ supplemented with 10 \u00b5M RhoKi (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0005]).\n         \nUse FSC and SSC to gate intact epithelial cells with intact morphology (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0005], left panel, P1).\nOn the gated population, use FSC and Trigger Pulse Width to select single cells and deplete cell duplets or triplets (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0005], middle panel, P2).\nUse the [405]460/50-DAPI channel to gate and sort living DAPI-negative cells (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0005], right panel, P3).\nAt this step, note the number of cells sorted in the tube in order to calculate seeding cell density in the following steps.\nThe cells not treated with DAPI can be used as a negative control in the FACS gating strategy (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0005]).\nSorting is important to make sure that single cells are used grow clonal cultures. It is very important if WGS will be performed, as loss of clonality prevents interpretation of WGS data.\nAlternatively, if cells have been subjected to CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, cells can be passed through a 40-\u00b5m cell strainer to increase the likelihood that dissociated single cells are seeded. After this, living cells are counted using a hemocytometer so that the seeding density can be estimated. While this approach is less stringent than sorting, it may enhance outgrowth efficiency and is acceptable if many clonal lines will be generated and screened later. Double-picking strategies can be applied in order to increase the likelihood of obtaining clonal cultures.\n14. Centrifuge cells 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.The pellet may not be visible due to a low number of sorted cells. Be extremely careful when removing the supernatant, and do not touch the tube walls with the pipette tip.\nIt is important that the BME droplets are solid after seeding to prevent dissociation before picking time and to avoid loss of organoid clones. To this end, make sure to remove as much supernatant as possible to increase the BME concentration.\n15. Resuspend cells homogeneously in BME to a density of 50-100 cells/\u00b5l. Pipette cells in \u223c15-\u00b5l domes in a 12-well plate.\nThe final cell concentration should be 50-100 cells per \u00b5l BME in order to maximize organoid outgrowth and minimize organoid fusion afterwards. Sparse seeding will impair organoid outgrowth, while dense seeding could lead to organoid fusion and loss of clonality of the future culture.\n16. Place the plate upside-down in the incubator for 20 min to let the domes solidify.\n17. Add expansion medium supplemented with 10 \u00b5M RhoKi and keep in the incubator, refreshing the medium (with RhoKi) every 2-3 days.\nAfter 7-14 days, single cells should have formed organoids (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0005]). Due to donor-to-donor variability, some cultures will take longer. If this is the case, keep organoids expanding for an extra week before continuing with the next step.\nIsolate and expand clonal organoid cultures\n18. Remove medium from the organoid well. Collect organoids in 1 ml Cell Recovery Solution and incubate on ice for 30 min.\nThis should liberate organoids from the BME, making them easier to pick in the next step.\n19. Pipette solution containing organoids in \u223c500-\u00b5l drops in a sterile 100-mm cell culture dish.\nIt is important that the drops not touch the dish walls, as organoids on the walls will not be visible under the microscope.20. Place the plate under a brightfield microscope and open the lid.\nAvoid moving or speaking above the opened plate. Make sure to add Primocin to the expansion medium at step 26.\n21. Using a P20 pipette, pick individual organoids from the drop and transfer each one to a separate 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 300 \u00b5l TrypLE at 4\u00b0C.\nIt is recommended to pick a high number of clonal organoids, because the outgrowth efficiency is not 100%. We recommend picking \u223c20 organoids per condition in an optimal growth state.\n22. Incubate in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 1 min.\n23. Add 700 \u00b5l AdvDMEM+++ containing 10 \u00b5M RhoKi and pipette up and down three to five times using a P1000 pipette.\n24. Centrifuge 5 min at 500 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant.\nAgain, the pellet may not be visible due to the low number of cells in the organoid. Be extremely careful when removing the supernatant, and do not touch the tube walls with the pipette tip.\n25. Resuspend in 20 \u00b5l BME and seed in a well of a 48-well plate (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-fig-0004]).\n26. Add expansion medium supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml Primocin and 10 \u00b5M RhoKi.\n27. After organoids grow out, pass them as in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002].Wnt3A-CM is an important component of the human intestinal organoid expansion medium. Its role in activating the Wnt pathway is key to maintenance of the stem cell population. Thus, the production of high-quality Wnt3A-CM is essential for successful establishment and culture of human intestinal organoids.\nMaterials\nL-Wnt-3A cells from frozen cryovial (from a T25 flask cultured to 95%-100% confluence) (provided upon request and after material transfer agreement)\nDMEM++ (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-rec-0004])\nZeocin (Gibco, cat. no.

Grow at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 until the culture reaches 90%-100% confluence (~3-4 days).\nA key component of DMEM++ medium is the FBS, to which L cells are very sensitive. Different batches of FBS should be tested to find one that efficiently supports growth of both L cells and organoids.\n2. Split cells to two T175 flasks using TrypLE and grow cells in DMEM++ with 125 \u00b5g/ml Zeocin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 until they reach 90%-100% confluence (~3-4 days).\n3. Split cells to a total of twelve T175 flasks. Add DMEM++ supplemented with 125 \u00b5g/ml Zeocin to two flasks and use these for a new round of Wnt3A-CM production (step 2). Add DMEM++ without Zeocin to the other ten flasks and use these for steps 4-7.\nL-Wnt-3A cells should only be used until passage 10-12.\n4. Allow cultures in the ten flasks to grow to confluence (~1 week).5. Trypsinize cultures, pool the cells, and seed in sixty 145-cm2 dishes in 20 ml DMEM++ without Zeocin per plate. Incubate cells for 1 week at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.\n6. Harvest medium and centrifuge for 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C.\n7. Collect supernatant and pass through a 0.22-\u00b5m Stericup-GP filter.\nIt is important to remove all L-Wnt-3A cells from the conditioned medium, as they will otherwise overgrow the organoids when the Wnt3A-CM is used for organoid culture.\n8. Test the quality of every batch of Wnt3A-CM using a luciferase-based assay in the HEK 293T-STF Wnt reporter cell line (Xu et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-bib-0030]).\nAs a reference, an optimal batch induces 15- and 300-fold increases in signal when used at concentrations of 12.5% and 50% (v/v), respectively. Using Wnt3A-CM at 1%-2% (v/v) should give a signal similar to background.\nFreshly prepared Wnt3A-CM can be stored at 4\u00b0C for long periods of time (>6 months).Rspo1-CM is used to prepare organoid medium as well as all of the differentiation media described here. The presence of Rspo1 in organoid expansion medium results in a synergistic increase in Wnt pathway activation levels compared to those achieved by Wnt3A-CM alone. Thus, Rspo1-CM is another key component of the medium used for establishment and expansion of human intestinal organoids.\nAdditional materials (also see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0007])\n293T-HA-RspoI Fc cells from frozen cryovial (from a T25 flask cultured to 95%-100% confluence) (R&D Systems, cat. no. 3710-001-01)\nT75 cell culture flasks (Greiner Bio-one, cat. no. 658170)\n1.

Add DMEM++ without Zeocin to the other ten flasks and use these for steps 4-6.\n293T-HA-RspoI Fc cells should only be used until passage 10-12.\n4. Grow cells in the ten flasks to 75% confluence (2-3 days).\n5. Remove DMEM++ from the culture and add 50 ml serum-free AdvDMEM+++ without Zeocin per flask. Incubate cells for 1 week at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nDuring the week, the culture medium will acquire a yellow color. The medium should not be refreshed, because Rspo1 is being secreted during this time.\n6. Harvest medium and centrifuge for 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C.7. Collect supernatant and pass through a 0.22-\u00b5m Stericup-GP filter.\nIt is important to remove all 293T cells from the conditioned medium, as they will otherwise overgrow the organoids when the Rspo1-CM is used for organoid culture.\n8. Test the quality of every batch of Rspo1-CM using a luciferase-based assay in the HEK 293T-STF Wnt reporter cell line.\nAs a reference, an optimal batch induces 100- and 600-fold increases in signal over background levels when used at concentrations of 0.25% and 2.5% (v/v), respectively, when used in combination with 12.5% (v/v) Wnt3A-CM. In the absence of Wnt3A-CM, Rspo1-CM does not significantly activate the Wnt pathway. However, its presence there contributes to increased viability of terminally differentiated organoids.\nThe process can be scaled up if larger volumes of Rspo1-CM are required. The ratio of medium volume to culture surface should be maintained.\nFreshly prepared Rspo1-CM can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for 6 months. The CM should be dispensed in aliquots adequate to your needs before freezing. Once thawed, store at 4\u00b0C and use preferably within 4 weeks. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.This protocol can be used with established organoid cultures, including those subjected to various experimental conditions.\nMaterials\nEstablished organoid culture (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.106#cpim106-prot-0002])\nColumn-based extraction kit (RNAeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, cat. no. 74104)\nFreshly prepared 70% (v/v) ethanol\nRNase-free DNase set (Qiagen, cat. no. 79254)\nRNase-free 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\n1. Remove medium from organoid well and dissolve the BME drop containing the organoids directly in 350 \u00b5l RLT buffer from the RNAeasy Mini Kit. Pipet several times up and down and transfer the suspension to a 15-ml plastic tube.\nThe starting material should be at least one full well of a 24-well culture plate. To ensure there is enough RNA material, it is preferable to use one full well of a 12-well plate. If organoids are cultured under differentiation conditions, expect the yield to decrease and use increased amounts of organoids for RNA assessments.\n2.

Standardization of Neuronal Cultures Using Microfluidic Devices: Device Assembly\nSelect a suitable microfluidic device for the desired experiment. To connect neurons within the same population, use the Neuro Devices (Figure 1) and to connect neurons in different populations use the Co-Culture Devices (Figure 6).\nClean and prepare the desired number of sterile coverslips or glass bottom dishes. For best results on plastic surfaces use 35 mm dishes, on glass use 25 mm coverslips, or 35 mm glass bottom dishes. Select glass thickness based on the imaging system, for instance 0.15 mm.\nCoat the dishes or coverslips with 0.5-1 mL of 100 \u00b5g/mL PDL for 2 h or overnight at room temperature.\n\tNote: Protocol can be paused here and resumed the following day if desired. Furthemore, dishes can be coated with borate buffer-diluted PDL, Poly-L-Lysine (PLL), laminin or any other cell adhesion molecule.\nWash the dishes twice with water (do not use phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as salt crystals may block the channels), remove all the liquid and let it dry in a sterile environment such as a biosafety cabinet for 5-10 min or until the surface is completely dry.\n\tNote: Be careful to ensure that the coverslips are absolutely dry, as any remaining liquid will interfere with the adherence of the microfluidic systems.\nPlace microfluidic devices with patterns facing up under UV light in a sterile environment (biosafety cabinet) for 10 min. Be sure to follow sterile procedures when working in the biosafety cabinet10.\nUsing tweezers place a microfluidic device with pattern facing down in contact with the clean coverslip/dish. Use the tweezers to softly press the device so that it adheres to the glass.Note: The transparency of the adhered region will be visible when looking against the light. Make sure all corners are contacting the glass. Do this to all microfluidic devices. See Figure 1a .\nTo fill the single population device with medium, point the pipette towards the channels and add 50 \u00b5L of complete cell medium supplemented with serum-free B-27 (volume ratio 1:50) and 500 \u00b5g/mL penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (collectively called NBM) to the right upper well, and then add another 50 \u00b5L to the well lying diagonally to it. Do this for all devices, making sure that the medium flows between wells. Next, add 50 \u00b5L of medium to the remaining 2 wells. See Figure 2a .\nTo fill the multiple population device with medium, point the pipette towards the channels and add 30 \u00b5L of complete NBM to the right wells, refer to Figure 6a. Do this for all devices, making sure that the medium flows between wells. Next, add 50 \u00b5L of medium to the remaining 4 wells.\nPlace the devices in a bigger plate with an open dish with autoclaved water (wet chamber) and place in the incubator (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity) for 1-2 h while preparing the cell culture. See Figure 2b .\n2. Plating Neurons in Microfluidic Systems\nFollowing the protocol outlined in Ref.8, obtain dissociated hippocampal or cortical neurons from Sprague Dawley rat embryos (either gender).\nResuspend embryonic neurons in NBM at a concentration of 1-2 million neurons/mL. Verify cell concentrations in the microscope using a hemocytometer and following reference8. Adjust the cell concentration according to the desired cell density. To increase the chances of obtaining single hippocampal axons per channel, plate 10,000 neurons per device. To have multiple axons in the same channel, plate 60,000 neurons per device.Note: These numbers vary according to the neuronal type used.\nRemove the medium from the microfluidic devices without emptying the wells. Leave approximately 5 \u00b5L in each.\nTo plate cells in the single population device, add 50 \u00b5L of NBM to the lower right well. At this point the medium flows by itself to fill the other lower well. Add 20 \u00b5L of the concentrate cell solution into the top right well of the microfluidic device, as indicated in Figure 1b .\nTo plate cells in the multiple population device add 20 \u00b5L of the concentrate cell solution into each of the right wells in Figure 6a.\nCheck in the microscope if cells are inside the chambers and place the devices in the incubator for 15-30 min to promote cell attachment to the substrate.\nCheck in the microscope if there are enough cells in the chambers. If more are needed, repeat steps 2.4 and 2.5.\nAdd 50 \u00b5L of NBM to the 2 top wells of the single population device and 20 \u00b5L of NBM into the same well as the cells were injected in the multiple population device. The media protrudes slightly to form a positive meniscus giving the wells a muffin top aspect. Again, see Figure 2a.\nMaintain the cells at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\n3. Maintaining the Neuronal Cultures\nRemove NBM (roughly 30 \u00b5L with a pipette) from the cells and apply new pre-warmed NBM the day following their introduction to the devices (that is 1 d after step 2).\nCheck every 2 days if there is enough medium in each channel. If the muffin top is low just add more medium to the top wells.Culture cells for at least 7 d before removal of the microfluidic devices. The cells can survive in these devices for several weeks. Remove the devices 1-2 days before experiments are performed on samples.\n4. Removal of Microfluidic Devices\n1 - 2 d before removal of microfluidic devices, add 2 mL of NBM prewarmed to 37 \u00b0C to each sample dish, flooding the chambers, and maintain the devices in the incubator.\nUse sterile tweezers and one tip to remove the microfluidic devices from the coverslips leaving a patterned configuration of neurons. Use the tip to hold the coverslip in place and the tweezers to clasp the edge of the device at the bottom left corner of the well. Delicately apply torsion, raising the device up with the tweezers so that it peels off the coverslip. See Figure 2c-2d.\nEvery 2-3 days, replace half the NBM until the sample is used for experiments.\nBefore performing rewiring experiments on the sample, verify that neurites in the single population device channels and the neuronal populations in the multiple population device are isolated by examining the gaps between them in the microscope to ensure there are no filaments linking neuronal populations.\n5. Preparing PDL-coated Beads\nAdd 2 x 50 \u00b5L drops of either 4, 10 or 20 \u00b5m polystyrene beads diluted in water (1:500) to 1 mL of PDL (100 \u00b5g/mL). Leave for at least 2 h at room temperature.\n\tNote: Protocol can be paused here and resumed the following day.\nCentrifuge the solution at 8,820 x g for 1 min. Carefully remove supernatant without disturbing the beads accumulated at bottom of container.\nWash the beads twice with 1 mL of sterile 10 mM HEPES pH 8.4 solution.\nResuspend the PDL-coated beads in 200 mL of 10 mM HEPES pH 8.4 solution.6. Preparing Micropipettes\nPrepare pipettes from glass capillary tubes (1 mm inner diameter, 1.5 mm outer diameter) using a horizontal electrode puller. Adjust settings so the outer tip of the pulled micropipette is ~ 2-5 \u00b5m. Before pulling, ensure the glass tubes are clean.\nFix pipettes to glass slides for storage, and ensure that the tip does not contact the surface of the slide as the tip is fragile. Store at room temperature in a covered container to protect from dust. Use pipettes the same day they are pulled.\n7. PDL-bead Adhesion to Neurons\nAdd 40-60 \u00b5L of PDL-coated beads prepared in step 5 to a cell culture prepared in step 4. Center the pipette tip over the neurons, which are faintly visible on the coverslip, and add the beads (See Figure 3).\nReturn the sample to the incubator for 1 h to promote the formation of synaptic contacts8,9.\nAfter the incubation, remove any un-adhered beads by gently washing the culture with pre-warmed NBM.\n8. Preparing Physiological Saline Solution (for Room Temperature Experiments)\nPrepare physiological saline solution by combining the ingredients listed in references7,8. This is to regulate the cell environment outside the incubator.\nVerify osmolarity and pH levels as indicated in references7,8.\nContinuously infuse solution with O2 to minimize pH fluctuations while conducting experiments.\nHeat to room temperature.\nSet up the perfusion system by inserting one end of a plastic tube (optional dimensions) in O2-infused physiological solution and fixing the other end to a needle inserted in the sample holder. Place the tubing and solution higher than the sample (See Figure 4).\nDisconnect the tube from the needle and connect it to a syringe. Use the syringe to exert pressure and draw liquid, filling the tube. Seal with a roller clamp and reconnect the needle.\n9. Bead MicromanipulationInstall sample in an experimental set-up such that cells can be accessed from above by two micropipettes mounted in micromanipulators and accessed optically below, for instance with the 40X-phase objective (numerical aperture of 0.6) of an inverted optical microscope. In this configuration, mount a CCD camera for image capture on the side port of the microscope. Connect each pipette to 1 mL syringes via plastic tubing. At this step, replace NBM with physiological saline solution (1-2 mL) (See Figure 4).\nDuring experiments, continuously perfuse cells with the physiological saline solution prepared in step 8 at a rate of 0.5-1 mL/min.\nSelect a PDL-bead NOT attached to a neuron in the field of view. Align the bead with a micropipette tip by focusing onto the bead then up to the micropipette. Bring the tip down as close as possible to the bead by monitoring it through the microscope.\nApply negative pressure with the 1 mL syringe connected to the pipette to pick up the bead. Maintain negative pressure throughout the experiment.\n10. Pulling Neurites\nSelect a PDL-bead attached to a neuron in the field of view and attach it to the second micropipette using suction as described in steps 9.3-9.4.\nPull the PDL-bead-neuron complex by slowly (~0.5 \u00b5m/min) moving either the micromanipulator or the sample stage by 1 \u00b5m and pause for 5 min to allow neurite initiation.\nRepeat step 10.2 twice.\n\tNote: The first 3 \u00b5m have to be pulled very slowly to guarantee experimental success, which occurs over 95% of the time.\nPull the PDL-bead-neuron complex by slowly (~0.5 \u00b5m/min) moving either the micromanipulator or the sample stage by 2 \u00b5m and pause for 5 min to allow neurite elongation.After successful initiation and neurite extension for the first 5 \u00b5m, pull the neurite at 20 \u00b5m/min over millimeter-scale distances.\n\tNote: Pulling can be performed continuously or in steps and at varying rates. See Figure 5b-5c .\n11. Connecting Neurons\nSelect a region rich in neurites and lower the PDL-bead-neurite complex so that it physically contacts it. Use other beads to gauge tip height above coverslip surface. See Figure 5d.\nLeave the PDL-bead-neurite complex in contact with the target neurite while manipulating the second micropipette. Lower the second pipette with the second PDL-bead on top of the newly formed neurite about 20 \u00b5m form the first bead. Use the second PDL-bead to push the new neurite filament towards the target cell.\nHold both beads in place for at least 1 h. Verify the absence of focal swelling, a thickening of the neurites contacting the bead, with the microscope16.\nDuring this time, use perfusion to slowly change the medium of the sample from physiological saline to pre-warmed, CO2-equilibrated NBM.\nRelease the bead from the second pipette by releasing suction. If the new neurite remains attached, release the first bead as well. See Figure 5e .\nGently remove saline solution and replace with NBM (~2 mL).\nCarefully place the sample back in the incubator to strengthen the neuronal connection for future experiments. This connection is stable for >24 h7.\n12. Verifying the Functionality of the New Connection via Whole-cell Paired Patch Clamp Recordings\nFollow references7,18,19. to assemble an electrophysiology set-up.\nFollow references7. to prepare the pre- and postsynaptic electrodes.\nGather patch clamp data, again following references18,19.\nCompare the results to naturally occurring signals7 to determine the connection type.\nSubscription Required.

This method for tissue preservation overcomes the limitation of specimen transportation time and enables wider application of the TIL analysis method.\nTumor tissue preservation.\nGently rinse the fresh specimen with saline to remove blood from tissue and place into a TTPR tube.\nMake sure the sample is completely immersed in the TTPR solution, and then close the cap tightly.\nPlace the TTPR tube with specimen in a styrofoam box filled with crushed ice and store the box at 2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C for up to 72 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1843-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Box preparation for TTPR preservation\n(A) TTPR tubes are placed in a styrofoam box filled with ice.\n(B) The lid is sealed with plastic tape.\nNote: Rinsing step with saline can be skipped unless an obvious blood contamination is seen. If using surgically resected samples instead of biopsy, the tissue samples should be cut into small pieces of biopsy size (approximately 5\u00a0mm3 as shown in Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) before placing sample into TTPR for preservation. Up to 100\u00a0mg of tumor tissue can be preserved in a TTPR tube (20\u00a0mL).\nNote: A styrofoam box or the substitute should be filled with as much ice as possible, and the lid should be sealed with plastic tape (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Size of the box should be large enough to keep ice during the storage time.\nTumor tissue dissociation and isolation\nTiming: 60\u00a0minThis step describes the approach to dissociate tumor tissue to obtain single-cell suspensions. The expected outcome is to extract a sufficient number of various types of immune cells although other types of cells which comprise the tumor microenvironment including tumor cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial and endothelial cells are also isolated simultaneously. We show data of isolated TILs with this method in comparison with the conventional mechanical dissociation method, which was reported previously (Sugiyama et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Saito et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The cell number and the immune phenotype of cells isolated from multiple types of tumors, various tissue sizes and different preservation time are presented.\nNote: All reagents are stored at 4\u00b0C or on ice unless otherwise specified. Sample incubations and centrifugation are performed at 4\u00b0C or on ice unless otherwise specified.\nTumor tissue dissociation.\nPrepare 1\u00d7 TTDR by adding 5\u00a0mL of TTDR reconstitution buffer at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C to each TTDR vial and incubate for 5\u201310\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C. Mix well by pipetting and transfer reconstituted TTDR to a 15\u00a0mL conical tube containing additional 5\u00a0mL of TTDR reconstitution buffer. Keep it aside at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C while preparing the sample. Do not leave the reconstituted TTDR at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C longer than 30\u00a0min prior to use.\nNote: Make sure that dried reagent at the bottom of the vial is completely reconstituted.\nCentrifuge the TTPR tube containing the tissue at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 2\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nAspirate the supernatant down to approximately 0.3\u00a0mL in the tube.\nCut tissue into small pieces (around 0.5\u20131.0\u00a0mm per side) using scissors (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).Critical: Excessive cutting with scissors may increase cell death. Cutting time should be usually about 20\u201340 s and no longer than 90\u00a0s when the scissor stroke is about 100 times per 60 s. In the case of hard tissues and/or large tissue size, place tube on ice for about 1\u00a0min to cool down and resume cutting.\nPlace the tube at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C and add 5\u201310\u00a0mL of 1\u00d7 TTDR at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C into the tube, rinsing the scissors while adding it.\nNote: We recommend 5\u00a0mL of 1\u00d7 TTDR for up to 50\u00a0mg and 10\u00a0mL for up to 100\u00a0mg. Insufficient volume of 1\u00d7 TTDR may cause poor cell recovery.\nClose the cap tightly and incubate at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min on the nutator. Gently tilt and check every 5\u00a0min that the tissue pieces are not stuck to the walls of the tube without touching the solution.\nDuring the incubation, place a 50\u00a0mL conical tube with a 40\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer directly on ice and add 10\u00a0mL cold stop buffer to equilibrate the filter membrane.\nCritical: Incubation time with TTDR should not exceed 20\u00a0min.\nNote: The use of a 40\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer is recommended to eliminate cell aggregates and/or tissue debris as much as possible, as the purpose of this protocol is mainly to isolate immune cells for flow cytometry analysis. Please choose a larger pore size strainer if you need to isolate larger cells as well.\nAfter the incubation, place the incubation tube at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C and immediately add 5\u00a0mL cold stop buffer to the tube and the cap.\nCell isolation.\nImmediately decant the solution in the cap to the tube, and then transfer the solution into the strainer.Note: Pour the solution into the strainer slowly while avoiding overflowing (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Exercise caution with mucosal samples (e.g., colorectal tissues) since they may be stickier and often disrupt the flow of the solution from the strainer.\nAdd an additional 10\u00a0mL cold stop buffer in the TTDR incubation tube for rinsing and decant the solution into the strainer.\nLightly grind the pieces of tissue on the strainer using the top of the syringe plunger for 20\u201330\u00a0s (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nAdd an additional 8\u00a0mL cold stop buffer in the strainer, rinsing the tip of the plunger.\nCentrifuge the tube with the strainer at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 2\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to drop the remaining solution into the tube.\nRemove the strainer and close the cap tightly.\nMix by inverting of the tube 10 times.\nCritical: The mixing step is indispensable to achieve optimal cell recovery.\nCentrifuge at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 12\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatant cautiously, leaving approximately 5\u00a0mL in the tube.

Repeat this step; total volume is 13\u201315\u00a0mL.\nClose the cap tightly and invert the tube at least twice.\nCentrifuge at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatant cautiously, leaving approximately 100\u00a0\u03bcL in the tube.\nResuspend the pellet in a total of 2\u20135\u00a0mL Stain Buffer (FBS), and pipette appropriate volume of the cell suspension for cell count.Note: We recommend hemolysis of cell counting portion if the suspension looks reddish or pinkish. Up to 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 viable cells can be stained in a tube in this protocol. Optimization of antibodies and reagents are required for your staining panel.\nCentrifuge at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatant cautiously, leaving 100\u00a0\u03bcL in the tube for cell staining. Pipette the cell suspension carefully and transfer the cell suspension to a 5\u00a0mL round bottom tube. The volume can be adjusted depending on the assay needs.\nNote: Leaving 50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcL in the tube is recommended for cell surface staining. Different types of tubes can be used although a 5\u00a0mL round bottom tube is recommended here.
