Motor performance was assessed by recording the time and number of foot slips as mice crossed the ladder, with trials repeated 4-5 times daily after a 15-minute interval for 3-4 days to evaluate motor learning. Data analysis involved calculating daily averages of time and foot slips and comparing these between groups. If a mouse failed to place its paws correctly or slipped, this was noted for further analysis, and if video recording was possible, missteps were reviewed afterward."

A questionnaire was designed to explore breakfast habits among schoolchildren and their sociodemographic correlations, incorporating a transcultural adaptation of the PERSEO program's abridged questionnaire validated for the Spanish population. The draft was created using word editing software, covering variables like gender, age, family situation, parent’s occupation, and breakfast habits based on recommendations by the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition and WHO. This draft was reviewed by external experts for item comprehension, leading to a final version submitted to the university's scientific and ethical committee. A reliability analysis was conducted by applying the questionnaire twice to a pilot group to check consistency. A cross-sectional descriptive study was then carried out, with questionnaires administered in silence by teachers in classrooms, instructing students to answer honestly within fifteen minutes. Sampling involved random selection from urban public schools, requiring informed consent from parents. Data were analyzed using statistical software (e.g., SPSS), with responses transferred to a database for analysis. Reliability and reproducibility were assessed using Kappa indexes for dichotomic items and the summatory value of scores for polychotomic items, considering values ≥0.40 as acceptable. Descriptive analyses calculated frequency distributions and central tendency measures, while hypothesis testing was conducted via Chi-square and Student’s t-tests, setting statistical significance at p < 0.05."
