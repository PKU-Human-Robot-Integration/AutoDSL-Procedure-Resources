        "1. Prepare the experiment: prepare the PCR reaction mixture including template DNA, primers, dNTPs, buffer, DNA polymerase.\n2. Set up the PCR program: repeat a fixed number of cycles (e.g. 30), each cycle consists of three main steps: denaturation (94-98°C to separate the DNA double strands), annealing (50-65°C, primers bind to the template DNA), and extension (72°C, DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands).\n3. Perform PCR: place the PCR mixture into the PCR instrument and start the preset cycling program.\n4. Analyze results: Analyze PCR products using methods such as gel electrophoresis to confirm that the target DNA fragments have been successfully amplified."

        "1. Prepare medium: prepare appropriate medium according to cell type.\n2. Inoculate cells: Add cell suspension to culture flasks containing culture medium.\n3. Continuous monitoring: Observe the cell growth status and density periodically. Repeat the culture as long as the cells have not reached the harvested density.\n4. Harvest cells: When the cells reach the expected density, harvest the cells for the next experiment or for passaging culture.",
        "1. Lysis of cells: cultured cells are collected and lysed to release intracellular proteins.\n2. Detection of proteins: Proteins in the lysate are detected using SDS-PAGE or other methods.\n3. Purification step: If the target protein is detected, perform the protein purification step (e.g. by affinity chromatography).\n4. Evaluate purification: After purification, evaluate the purification again using SDS-PAGE or other methods.\n5. Repeat purification if needed: Depending on the purification effect, decide if the purification step needs to be repeated or if further purification is needed."

        "1. Collect a cell sample.\n2. Make cell staining, which defines the fixed staining steps.\n3. Observe and record the staining results.\nCell staining：\n1. Fixation of cells: Cells are fixed using an appropriate fixative (e.g. 4% paraformaldehyde) to maintain their morphology and structure.\n2. Permeabilization: permeabilization of the cell membrane with a permeabilizing agent (e.g., 0.1% Triton X-100) to allow the dye to penetrate the cell membrane and enter the cell.\n3. Blocking of non-specific binding: Use an appropriate blocking agent (e.g. 5% BSA or 10% FBS) to block non-specific binding sites and reduce background signal.\n4. Staining: Add appropriate dyes (e.g. DAPI, Hoechst, Propidium Iodide, etc.) to stain nuclei or organelles.\n5. Wash: Perform multiple washing steps to remove excess dye and other impurities.\n6. SEALING: Stained cells are added to a slide and appropriate sealing solution is added to cover the slide to protect the cells and minimize the effects of light."
