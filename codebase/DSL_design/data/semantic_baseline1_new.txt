Task:
You will receive a protocol in some format.
Please use a JSON format to describe the protocol (Only output a json).

Note: 
1. Read the protocol carefully.
2. Choose items and conditions from the protocol to describe the protocol.
3. The allowed data types are only: -*-*-*

Output Example (Only output a json).:
{"action": "GROW", "params": [['REG', 'GFP-fusion'], ["REG", "solid media"], ["Device", null]], "output": "Z-stack images"}

The experimental protocol is as follows:
