{"original_protocol": ["Note: The photomask designs for our microfluidic device fabrication were drawn by using a computer aided design (CAD) software. The designs were then utilized to fabricate chrome photomasks using a commercial service. The PDMS devices were made using soft lithography techniques.11\n1. Fabrication of Master Molds by Lithography\nBefore the photolithography process12, use the 4-inch silicon wafers as a substrate and dehydrate the wafers in a conventional oven at 120 \u00b0C for 10 min.\nClean the dehydrated silicon wafers by using oxygen plasma treatment at 100 watts for 30 sec in a plasma cleaner.\nPreheat two hotplates at 65 \u00b0C and 95 \u00b0C, respectively, for the following baking process.\nCoat 5 g of negative photoresist (PR) on the cleaned silicon wafers by a spin coater; spin at 1,200 rpm (SU-8 50) for 30 sec to produce the microchannel layer.\nPlace the PR coated wafer on a preheated hotplate at 65 \u00b0C for 12 min and transfer it to another preheated hotplate at 95 \u00b0C for 33 min (for 100 \u00b5m thick patterns) to perform a soft bake process.\nAfter baking, place the PR coated silicon wafer on the holder of a semi-automated mask aligner and align it to a 25,400 dpi resolution transparency photomask.\nExpose the PR coated silicon wafer to UV light (365 nm) at a dose of 500 mJ/cm2 to create the PR pattern on the silicon wafer.\nRemove the wafer from the aligner and place it on a hotplate for post-baking at 95 \u00b0C for 12 min.\nSoak the wafers in SU-8 developer (propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, PGMEA) solution to wash off uncrosslinked PR for 12 min and gently dry with nitrogen gas to expose the alignment marks.Again, coat 5 g of negative photoresist on the wafers by a spin coater; spin at 700 rpm (SU-8 100) for 30 sec and 1,200 rpm (SU-8 10) for 30 sec for 300 \u00b5m thick pattern and 27 \u00b5m thick pattern respectively to make the microwell layer.\nPlace the PR coated wafer on a hotplate at 65 \u00b0C for 4 min and at 95 \u00b0C for 8 min (for 27 \u00b5m deep capture-well layer); and at 65 \u00b0C for 40 min and at 95 \u00b0C for 110 min (for 300 \u00b5m deep culture-well layer).\nAfter cooling, place the PR coated silicon wafer on the mask aligner equipped with UV light.\nExpose the PR coated silicon wafer to the UV light (365 nm) at a dose of 250 mJ/cm2 (for 27 \u00b5m thick pattern) and 700 mJ/cm2 (for 300 \u00b5m thick pattern).\nBake the wafers at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min (27 \u00b5m thick pattern) and 30 min (300 \u00b5m thick pattern), respectively.\nWash off the uncrosslinked PR by the PGMEA for 6 min (27 \u00b5m thick pattern) and 25 min (300 \u00b5m thick pattern), respectively, and then dry them with nitrogen gas.\nMeasure the height of pattern features on the wafer with a scanning laser profilometer by placing the wafer on the xy-stage of a scanning laser profilometer.\n\t\nAdjust the focal plane to clearly show the pattern features on the wafer by using the \"camera view\" observation mode under a 20X objective lens.\nSwitch the observation mode from \"camera view\" to \"laser view\", and set the upper and lower positions of the features.\nSet the measurement mode, area, quality, and z-pitch up to transparent (top), 1 line (1,024 x 1), high-accuracy and 0.5 \u00b5m, respectively, and then press the start bottom to begin the measurement.2. Preparation of PDMS Devices for Single-cell Isolation\nBefore PDMS casting, silanize the master molds with trichlorosilane to create a hydrophobic surface, which makes it easier to peel off the PDMS replicas from the master molds.\n\t\nPlace the master molds and a weighting boat containing 200 \u00b5l of trichlorosilane in a desiccator, and apply vacuum (-85 kPa) for 15 min.\nStop the vacuum and then leave the master molds in the desiccator to silanize the master molds at room temperature for at least 1 hr.\nRemove the master molds from the desiccator and place each master mold in a 10 cm Petri dish.\nMix a total amount of 17.6 g PDMS polymer kit containing a base and a curing agent at a ratio of 10:1, and then pour the PDMS onto the master mold in the Petri dish.\nPlace the Petri dish in a desiccator and apply vacuum (-85 kPa) for 1 hr to remove air bubbles in the PDMS.\nRemove the Petri dish from the desiccator and place it in a conventional oven at 65 \u00b0C for 3 - 6 hr to cure the PDMS.\nRemove the cured PDMS replicas from the master molds and punch two holes as an inlet and an outlet at the two ends of the microchannel on the capture-well array PDMS replica by a puncher with inner-diameter of 0.75 mm for the fluidic channel (Figure 2A).\nUse tape to clean the surface of the PDMS replicas, and then place the PDMS replicas in a plasma cleaner for brief oxygen plasma treatment (100 watts for 14 sec).\nRemove the PDMS replicas from the oxygen plasma machine.\nAlign a top (containing the capture microwells) and a bottom PDMS (containing the culture microwells) replica by hand under a stereomicroscope and bring them into contact.Place the aligned PDMS replicas in an oven at 65 \u00b0C for 24 hr to achieve permanent bonding between the PDMS replicas to form the final device.\nSoak the PDMS device in a deionized (DI)-water filled container and place the container in a desiccator under vacuum (-85 kPa) for 15 min to remove air from the microchannel of the PDMS device.\nPlace the DI water-filled PDMS device in a tissue culture hood and use UV light (wavelength of light: 254 nm) to sterilize of the device for 30 min.\nReplace the DI water in the PDMS device with a 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1x PBS solution and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min to prevent cells from sticking to the PDMS surface.\n\tNote: The BSA coating is critical to improve the transfer efficiency of isolated cells from capture-well to culture-well.\nReplace the 5% BSA solution in the PDMS device with sterilized 1x PBS solution.\n3. Preparation of Single-cell Suspension\nCulture Neural stem cell KT98, and human carcinoma cell A549 and MDA-MB-435 we in Petri dish in conventional cell culture incubator (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity) to prepare cells for the PDMS device cell experiment.\nRemove and discard the spent culture medium (DMEM basal medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics) from the culture dish with cells grown to 70 - 80% confluence.\nGently wash the cells with sterilized PBS three times.\nRemove and discard the PBS, and add 2 ml of a recombinant enzyme mixture with proteolytic, collagenolytic, and DNase activities (please see the Materials List for the detailed information).\nIncubate the culture dish at room temperature for 5 min, and then tap the culture dish to facilitate cell detachment.Add 4 ml of sterilized PBS to disperse cells, and then transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 3 min and remove the supernatant.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml sterilized PBS and count the live cell number using the standard Trypan Blue exclusion method13.\n\tNote: This resuspension step is critical for preparing well-dissociated single-cell suspension to improve the single-cell isolation efficiency.\n4. Single-cell Isolation and Clonal Culture\nLoad 50 \u00b5l of cell suspension at a concentration of 2.2 - 2.5 x106 cells/ml into the microchannel of the PDMS device via the device's outlet hole with a handheld pipette.\n\tNote: The cell suspension loading pipette needs to be stopped and held at the first stop position to avoid introducing air bubbles into the microchannel.\nLoad another 50 \u00b5l of cell suspension through the inlet hole to evenly fill up the whole microchannel with cells.\nSeal the outlet hole with a plug (a 3 mm long, 1 mm diameter cut nylon fishing line) to avoid flow induced by hydrostatic pressure from the droplets on inlet and outlet holes.\n\tNote: The plugs were UV sterilized inside a tissue culture hood prior to use.\nFill up a 1 ml sterile syringe with culture medium, eject air bubbles from it, and set it up on a syringe pump.\nConnect the medium loaded syringe to the inlet hole of the PDMS device via a 23 G blunt needle and a poly-tetrafluoroethene (PTFE) tubing.\nRemove the plug from outlet hole and allow a 2-min time interval to allow the cells to settle into the single-cell capture-wells by gravitational force.\nWash away the uncaptured cells with 300 \u00b5l of culture medium at a flow rate of 600 \u00b5l/min driven by the syringe pump.Wait for 2 min to stabilize the device, and seal the inlet and outlet holes with plugs to form a closed culture system.\nFlip the device by hand to transfer the captured single-cells to the culture microwells.\nPlace the PDMS device in a 100-mm tissue culture dish, and add 10 ml of sterilized PBS around the device to avoid culture medium evaporation from the microchannel.\nMove the culture dish to a conventional cell culture incubator (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity) for clonal culture of the single-cells.\n5. Culture Medium Replenishment\nAfter 1 d of culture, replace the culture medium in the PDMS device with fresh medium to improve cell proliferation.\nPlace two droplets of culture medium on top of the PDMS device near the inlet and outlet holes areas to avoid introducing air bubbles into the microchannel while performing the next step.\nPunch two holes from the top of the PDMS device near the two ends of the microchannel as an inlet and an outlet for the microchannel.\n\tNote: Do not punch through the whole two layers of the PDMS device; instead, just punch through the top layer of the PDMS.\nConnect a 1 ml plastic syringe containing fresh medium to the inlet via a 23 G blunt needle and PTFE tubing.\nFlow 120 \u00b5l fresh medium into the device for 5 min to replace the old medium.\nInsert two plugs to seal the inlet and outlet holes, and return the device to the cell culture incubator.\nRefresh the culture medium every 2 d during the period of culture by removing the sealing plugs, followed by repeating steps 5.4 to 5.5.\nSubscription Required.

The protocol was optimized so that it is usable with very sparse amounts of cells.\nPrepare EM fixative according to the recipe provided above in the \u2018materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]\u2019 section.\nTransfer a minimum of 100.000 live cells into a 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf protein LoBind tube.\nNote: Usage of protein LoBind tubes is crucial especially when working with small samples to preserve as many cells as possible during preparation steps.\nFill up the Eppendorf tube with 1\u00d7 PBS.\nSpin the cells down for 10\u00a0min with 1000 g at 4\u00b0C in a swing-out centrifuge.\nLocate the newly formed cell pellet on the bottom of the tube. Gently remove and discard supernatant, then add 1\u00a0mL of 4\u00b0C cold fixative and resuspend well.\nNote: Always leave the cell pellet slightly covered in liquid when discarding supernatant after centrifugation. This will prevent dehydration of the sample.\nNote: If available, use a glass pipette since cells are more likely to adhere to plastic pipettes.\nIncubate at 20\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min, then centrifuge again (swing-out, 10\u00a0min, 1000 g, 4\u00b0C).\nRemove supernatant, then add 1\u00a0mL of fixative and resuspend well.\nContinue fixation in the fridge at 4\u00b0C for 12 h.\nOn the next day, centrifuge again (swing-out, 10\u00a0min, 1000 g, 4\u00b0C).\nRemove supernatant and add 1\u00a0mL of 0.1\u00a0M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Store sample in the fridge at 4\u00b0C.\nDay 2: Agarose pre-embedding\nTiming: 30\u201360\u00a0min preparation time, 90\u00a0min benchIn this step, cells are embedded into agarose in order to form a stable, dense pellet for consecutive Epon embedding and sectioning.\nPreparation:\nPrewarm a 37\u00b0C water bath, heat up a heating block to 37\u00b0C and prewarm a swing-out centrifuge to 37\u00b0C.\nMelt low melting point agarose in a microwave (max. 10 s) and keep it in water bath at 37\u00b0C.\nCut 4\u00a0mm of pipette tips off to facilitate handling of low melting point agarose\nPre-heat pipette tips and 200\u00a0\u03bcL PCR tubes on the heating block.\nNote: Give equipment at least 30\u00a0min to reach a stable temperature. This is paramount for the formation of a proper cell pellet.\nStain cells by adding 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 20\u00a0mg/mL Evans Blue in 0.1\u00a0M cacodylate buffer to your sample. Incubate at 20\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min.\nWash your sample 2\u20133 times until supernatant is almost clear and a blue pellet is visible on the bottom of the tube:\nCentrifuge (swing-out, 10\u00a0min, 1000 g, 37\u00b0C).\nRemove supernatant and add 1\u00a0mL of 0.1\u00a0M cacodylate buffer.\nCentrifuge again (swing-out, 10\u00a0min, 1000 g, 37\u00b0C).\nRemove supernatant completely and immediately add 150\u00a0\u03bcL of low-melting agarose. Carefully resuspend once and put agarose and cells into 200\u00a0\u03bcL PCR tube.\nCentrifuge (swing-out, 10\u00a0min, 1000 g, 37\u00b0C).\nNote: It is crucial to carry out steps 15 and 16 as quickly as possible. If the agarose cools down too much, cells cannot make it to the bottom of the tube during centrifugation and you will not obtain a usable cell pellet.\nLet the pellet solidify on ice for 10\u00a0min.\nContinue with Epon embedding or store the pre-embedded sample in the fridge at 4\u00b0C.\nDay 2\u20134: Post-fixation, dehydration and Epon embedding\nTiming: 90\u2013120\u00a0min preparation, 120\u2013150\u00a0min bench, 48\u201360\u00a0h polymerizationDuring post-fixation, heavy metals are used so that cells can be visualized in EM later with adequate contrast. Afterwards, water is replaced by acetone and cells are embedded into Epon resin as preparation for sectioning. You will end up with at least one Epon block per sample. These steps are carried out using a temperature-controlled microwave (Pelco BioWavePro) at 23\u00b0C equipped with a vacuum pump to speed up the embedding process.\nCritical: Since you will work with cacodylate, OsO4, uranyl acetate and acetone, the microwave needs to be set up under a fume hood.\nNote: You can find a detailed microwave protocol on Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/ct23zrnxc2.1[href=https://doi.org/10.17632/ct23zrnxc2.1]\nPreparation:\nPlace all components (Epon mixture A, Epon mixture B, DMP-30, and acetone (50%, 70%, 90%, 100%) at 20\u00b0C for 1 h.\nCalculate the necessary amount of resin: You will need 15\u00a0mL Epon resin per sample.\nIn a 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube, mix Epon mixtures A and B according to \u201chard\u201d formula:\nPer 15\u00a0mL resin, you will need 4.5\u00a0mL (4.85 g) Epon mixture A and 10.5\u00a0mL (12.72 g) Epon mixture B.\nMix them together in a 50\u00a0mL Falcon Tube.\nLet the components mix well for 30\u00a0min, then add 0.225\u00a0mL DMP-30 per 15\u00a0mL resin. Let mix well again.\nNote: Mix gently and do not shake to avoid the formation of small air bubbles inside the resin.\nPrepare at least 2\u00a0mL each of the following EPON concentrations (v/v%) in 100% acetone: 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%\nOn a glass dish under the fume hood, cut the PCR tube to free your cell pellet. Add a few drops of 0.1\u00a0M cacodylate buffer to prevent dehydration. If necessary, trim the pellet into appropriate pieces with a scalpel.Note: Trimming larger pellets into small pieces (e.g., cubes of 0.5\u00a0mm side length) is necessary to ensure penetration of the post-fixation agents.\nCarefully transfer the cell pellet or its pieces into a new 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tube containing 1\u00a0mL 0.1\u00a0M cacodylate buffer.\nNote: In the upcoming steps, you will be required to remove the respective supernatant and add another substance. To prevent desiccation and subsequent damage to your sample pellet, it is safer to leave a few \u03bcl of supernatant in the tube. This is especially important for steps involving acetone due to its volatility.\nRemove buffer and add 400\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% OsO4 in water.\nTransfer samples into microwave and start the protocol.\nWhen the microwave is finished, remove OsO4 and wash with dH2O twice.\nRemove supernatant and add dH2O again. Put into the microwave, continue protocol, then repeat this step once.\nRemove supernatant and add 500\u00a0\u03bcL 1% uranyl acetate in dH2O.\nTransfer samples into microwave and continue protocol.\nRemove uranyl acetate and wash with dH2O twice.\nRemove supernatant and add dH2O again. Put into the microwave, continue protocol, then repeat this step once.\nFor dehydration, remove supernatant and add 50% acetone in water.\nTransfer to the microwave and continue protocol.\nRepeat steps 30 and 31 with 70%, 90%, and 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100% acetone to complete dehydration.\nTransfer cell pellets into small glass vials containing enough 100% acetone to cover the pellet(s).\nRemove acetone and start Epon embedding:\nAdd 10% Epon in acetone, then put the sample in the microwave.\nAfter microwave step, remove Epon.\nRepeat steps 34a and 34b with the following Epon concentrations: 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100%\nAdd the pellet(s) and enough Epon to an embedding mold. Incubate at 20\u00b0C for 12 h.Polymerize blocks in an oven at 60\u00b0C for 48 h.\nDay 4: Serial sectioning and post-staining\nTiming: 3\u20134\u00a0h for serial sectioning; 2\u00a0h post-staining\nIn this step, Epon blocks are serially sectioned and then loaded onto formvar-coated grids. A post-staining is applied to enhance contrast in electron microscopy images.\nNote: We used five serial sections measuring approximately 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0800\u00a0\u03bcm in length and width, respectively, and of 200\u00a0nm thickness each per grid, yielding a total of 1\u00a0\u03bcm in Z dimension. You can increase or decrease your final volume by either fitting more sections on one grid, increasing the section thickness, or analyzing several consecutive grids. The choice of your section thickness depends on your feature of interest and the available microscope. Thicker sections will lead to more blur in transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and since you will use 2D TEM images to screen for your target feature, still being able to identify your regions of interest limits your section thickness choice. As an example, larger features (e.g., mitochondria) might still be visible in 300\u00a0nm thick sections, whereas for small structures such as cell junctions, you might even have to use thinner sections of 100\u2013150\u00a0nm thickness. Additionally, your choice is limited depending on your available electron microscope since for greater section thicknesses, a higher acceleration voltage (200 or even 300\u00a0kV) might be necessary to achieve an adequate electron penetration depth, especially at high tilt angles during tomography acquisition. Thus, depending on the cellular ultrastructure you want to analyze, your sample, and the available microscope, we recommend planning your sectioning conditions accordingly.\nSectioning: Trim the block, then make serial sections of 200\u00a0nm thickness. Carefully place 5 or more consecutive sections on a formvar coated slot grid (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm).Note: If you are a novice to serial sectioning of resin blocks, you should consider practicing both sectioning and picking up of the sections with a trial sample (e.g., cells from a cell line) before working with precious, scarce samples. For very detailed information regarding ultramicrotomy techniques, refer to Kolotuev et\u00a0al.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Additionally, at SynapseWeb, the University of Texas provides a well-described step-by-step protocol for serial sectioning for beginners (link in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nPlace parafilm on a wet surface and use a lid to cover it to create a slightly moist chamber.\nUranyl acetate staining:\nPer grid you want to post-stain, prepare one row of drops (content of drops see below) to the parafilm:\n50% methanol.\n2% (v/v%) uranyl acetate in 70% methanol.\n4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050% methanol.\n3\u00d7 dH2O.\nNote: All solutions should be filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter prior to use to avoid precipitation of reagents.\nCarefully place your grid onto the methanol drop.\nProceed to uranyl acetate. Let the grid incubate for 5\u00a0min. Cover parafilm with a lid.\nNote: Grids should float on the surface of the drops during incubation, sections facing down.\nRinse the grid in all 4 methanol drops, then place it in the first water drop.\nLet sit in the water for 1\u00a0min with the lid on, then proceed to the next drop. Repeat until last drop of water.\nLead citrate staining:\nAdd potassium hydroxide (KOH) pellets to the parafilm.\nNext to that, add one drop of lead citrate and cover with a lid for 2\u00a0min.\nAdd 4 drops of water next to lead citrate.\nPlace grid on lead citrate drop and incubate for 3\u00a0min with a lid on.Place grid in first drop of water and let it sit in the water for 1\u00a0min with the lid on, then proceed to the next drop. Repeat until last drop of water is reached.\nTransfer grid to a rubber plate with the sections facing upward.\nDay 4\u20135: Transmission electron microscopy screening acquisition\nTiming: 2\u00a0h at the electron microscope\u00a0+ automated acquisition, \u223c 8\u201312 h\nIn this step, images of each cell will be acquired on the central section at 1000\u00d7 and 3000\u00d7 magnification semi-automatically using SerialEM,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] KNIME,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] IMOD5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] and pyEM.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] These should thus be installed on your TEM computer before you start. 3000\u00d7 magnification images will be needed to screen through cells and identify cells with target features (in our case: centrioles), whereas 1000\u00d7 images will be used to trace cells on adjacent sections on the same grid.

Hence, it is important that as many cells as possible were picked up correctly.\nRight-click on \u2018Python Script\u2019 node, then click execute.Note: KNIME will now create individual virtual maps at each labeled position at 1000\u00d7 magnification using the reference map. This is needed because SerialEM cannot use low magnification maps for the \u2018Realign to item\u2019 command. A new Navigator file (\u2018nav_automaps.nav\u2019) containing all items will be generated automatically.\nAutomated acquisition of each cell on the central section at 1000\u00d7 and 3000\u00d7 magnification, respectively:\nIn SerialEM, open the new Navigator file: \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Read and Open\u2019 \u2192 select \u2018nav_automaps.nav\u2019.\nStill at 1000\u00d7 magnification, record an image and save it as \u2018anchormaps.mrc\u2019.

Depending on your microscope, about 150 cells will be acquired per hour.Let the microscope run for the estimated run time. Remember to refill cooling agent (e.g., liquid nitrogen).\nDay 5: Screening evaluation\nTiming: 60\u201375\u00a0min per 1000 cell images at 3000\u00d7 magnification\nIn this step, 3000\u00d7 magnification images from the previous step will be used to identify cells of interest (i.e., cells containing target features, in our case centrioles) using ImageJ software.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Images/maps of these cells will be kept for further targeting, whereas all other items, such as images of cells without interesting features, will be discarded after this step.\nLaunch ImageJ on your PC and drag and drop your folder \u2018cells\u2019 there. Load it as a stack.\nCheck your images for features of interest and note the image number of your target cell. You can use your own sheet or the excel template provided on Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/ct23zrnxc2.1[href=https://doi.org/10.17632/ct23zrnxc2.1]\nIn SerialEM, prepare your Navigator file:\nSet the following items to \u2018Acquire\u2019 in the Navigator window:\nAll polygons.\nAll virtual maps.\nThe reference map (\u2018refmap\u2019).\nAll maps (both lower and higher magnification) of cells without target features.\nAll 3000\u00d7 magnification maps (\u2018hm_xxx\u2019) of cells containing target features.\nThe \u2018anchormap\u2019.\nThe following items need to be kept and therefore must not be set to \u2018Acquire\u2019:\n1000\u00d7 magnification maps (\u2018lm_xxx\u2019) of cells containing target features.\nThe 400\u00d7 magnification overview of the central section (\u2018400_s3\u2019).\nSave the Navigator file, then save as \u2018nav_prepared\u2019.\nIn the main window, select \u2018Tools\u2019, run \u2018Delete Navigator\u2019s Acquire Items\u2019. Once the script is finished, re-open \u2018nav_prepared\u2019.\nCheck that all relevant data is still stored in the Navigator file. If not, re-open your old navigator (\u2018nav_automaps.nav\u2019) and check that all items are set to \u2018Acquire\u2019 correctly. Repeat from step 50.a.\nDay 5\u20136: Targeting and tomography acquisition\nTiming: 3\u20134\u00a0h to set up; for 1\u00a0h per 6\u20137 tomograms (automated acquisition)In this step, maps of cells containing centrioles and points defining the exact location of the centrioles will be created to serve as target coordinates for tomography on the central section. Afterwards, these will be duplicated and then shifted to all adjacent sections of the grid using registration/transformation and SerialEM\u2019s RealignToItem feature. Thereafter, an automated tomography acquisition is initiated at the points of interest.\nNote: Steps 51 to 56 only need to be performed if you removed the grid or if you use two different electron microscopes for the workflow. If in your setup, everything is performed on a single microscope, you will only have to acquire the section overviews as described in step 54 and then continue with step 57.\nSet up your microscope: Cool it down and load the grid. Launch SerialEM and load your settings.\nOpen the Navigator file \u2018nav_prepared\u2019. In the Navigator window, change \u2018Registration\u2019 to 2 using the arrow buttons.\nSwitch to 110\u00d7 in the Imaging states. Add a polygon around the whole grid in Preview mode and acquire a montaged image using the instructions from step 43. Name it \u2018ov_new\u2019 and label the item in the Navigator window as well.\nAcquisition of section overviews at low magnification:\nNote: These section overviews will be used for transformation of duplicate items in step 59.\nSwitch to 450\u00d7 magnification in the Imaging states.\nOpen \u2018ov_new\u2019 and click on a corner of one of the outmost sections. Navigate to this position by clicking \u2018Go to marker\u2019.\nDraw a polygon around each section. When you are finished, set\u00a0all polygons to \u2018Acquire\u2019 in the Navigator window.\nMark the first polygon in the Navigator window, then click \u2018New file at item\u2019 and \u2018Montaged images\u2019 with 15% overlap. Choose MRC format and name the file \u2018s1\u2019.Note: SerialEM will now automatically name the subsequent files (\u2018s2\u2019, \u2018s3\u2019, and so on)\nIn the main window, go to \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 Acquire at items. Select \u2018Acquire map image or montage\u2019 as Primary Task, and tick \u2018Skip Z moves\u2019, then click \u2018GO\u2019.\nOnce the acquisition is finished, relabel the new maps in the Navigator file and save the Navigator.\nRegistration:\nDisplay your new image of the central section (in our case \u2018s3\u2019) by double-clicking on it in the Navigator window.\nClick \u2018New window\u2019 in the buffer control menu of the main window.\nNow double-click on \u2018400_s3\u2019. It will appear in your new window. Arrange both windows so that they are displayed side by side.\nSet registration points to shift the coordinates from the old items to the newly acquired ones: Set corresponding points on correlating structures on both images by clicking \u2018Add points\u2019 in the Navigator window. Evenly distribute 6\u20138 pairs of these points on the whole section.\nMake them \u2018registration points\u2019 in the Navigator window.\nSave the Navigator file, then save the Navigator as \u2018s3_pretransform\u2019.\nIn the main window, click \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Transform items\u2019.\nNote: This will transform the coordinates of all images acquired during the screening to the new, correct coordinates.\nIf the mean deviation is higher than 10\u00a0\u03bcm between the old and the new coordinates, an error box will show up. In that case, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5], potential solution 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.6].\nUpdate microscope states for the old 1000\u00d7 magnification maps:Note: Moving a grid from one microscope to another usually requires applying a large scaling factor and rotation to maps. This script therefore creates virtual maps with a modified header from the old 1000\u00d7 modification maps which can then be utilized for the \u2018RealignToItem\u2019 procedure on the second microscope. These virtual maps are eventually replaced by newly acquired maps on the second microscope (step 57).\nSelect 2300\u00d7 in the Imaging states and adjust the beam.\nRecord an image, save the image as \u2018refmap_new\u2019, make it a map in the Navigator window and label the new item as \u2018refmap\u2019.\nNote: Even a blank image with a blocked beam is fine.\nSet\u00a0all 1000\u00d7 magnification maps (\u2018lmxxx\u2019) to \u2018Acquire\u2019 and save the Navigator file.\nIn the main window, click \u2018Tools\u2019 \u2192 Update Microscope States for Selected Maps\u2019 to generate a new Navigator file called \u2018s3_pretransform_updated\u2019.\nClick \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Read and Open\u2019 and open the newly generated Navigator file. All maps acquired at 1000\u00d7 earlier will now be converted into virtual maps at 2300\u00d7 magnification.\nCheck whether your transformation was successful: Choose a virtual map in the Navigator window and click \u2018Realign to item\u2019. Continue with the next step if you are content with your results. If not, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nRe-Acquisition of target cells and defining target points.\nNote: In this step, you will reacquire the maps of cells containing centrioles to replace the virtual maps from step 56. On these new maps, you will define your points of interest (where tomography will be performed eventually) by setting points to the centrioles. These points and maps on the central section of the grid will be used in step 59 to semi-automatically target the same cells on adjacent sections.\nSet\u00a0all created virtual maps to \u2018Acquire\u2019.Move the stage to a point on the central section. In the main window, click \u2018Task\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Eucentric Rough\u2019.\nClick \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Acquire at items\u2019. In the upcoming dialog, choose \u2018Run script\u2019 as a Primary Task and select the script \u2018serial section_initial map\u2019 from the drop-down menu. Then click \u2018GO\u2019.\nAfter the first map, an error message will pop up asking for the saving directory of the new maps. Simply click \u2018yes\u2019.\nWhen the script has finished, control whether all cells were identified correctly comparing the newly acquired maps with the virtual maps. If an incorrect cell was targeted, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.8].\nWhile controlling all maps, set points to your feature of interest (in our case, centrioles) by clicking \u2018Add points\u2019 in the Navigator window.\nRename points and add a section index.\nSet\u00a0all points to \u2018Acquire\u2019.\nIn the main window, click \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Acquire at items\u2019. As Primary Task, run the script \u2018Name_pts\u2019, and tick \u2018Skip initial stage move\u2019 and \u2018Skip initial Z move and realign\u2019. Click \u2018GO\u2019 and confirm the upcoming error message.\nNote: This will rename all points according to the map they were added on (e.g., a point on the map \u2018lm001\u2019 will be named \u2018c001\u2019)\nSet\u00a0all 2300\u00d7 maps and all corresponding points to \u2018Acquire\u2019.\nIn the main window, click \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Acquire at items\u2019. Run the script \u2018Add Section Index\u2019.\nNote: This will add the index \u2018_s03\u2019 to the name of your maps and points. If you did not screen on section 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details], edit the script accordingly in the \u2018Scripts\u2019 window.\nSave the Navigator file.\nTransfer acquired maps and coordinates to adjacent sections to locate target cells:Note: In this step, three major steps are involved: First, the maps and points on the central section are duplicated. Second, these duplicates are shifted from the central section to another using transformation on low-magnification overviews of the respective sections. Third, a SerialEM script utilizes the \u2018RealignToItem\u2019 feature to locate the exact cell and centriole point on the adjacent section and labels the points automatically.\nMark the map \u2018s3\u2019 in the Navigator window and change its Registration to 3. To do that, in the main window, click \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Change registration\u2019.\nDisplay \u2018s3\u2019 side by side with the overview map of an adjacent section by clicking \u2018New window\u2019 in the Buffer controls menu.\nAdd 6\u20138 pairs of registration points (as described in step 55).\nChange the registration of s3 back to \u20182\u2019 using \u2018Navigator\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Change registration\u2019 in the main window.\nSet the target points (the ones named \u2018cxxx_s03\u2019) to \u2018Acquire\u2019 and save the Navigator file.\nIn the main window, click \u2018Tools\u2019 \u2192 Duplicate Navigator\u2019s Acquire Points and associated maps\u2019 to create a new Navigator file with the suffix \u2018_duplicated\u2019.\nNote: This tool duplicates the selected points and maps. Subsequently, the duplicates will be shifted to an adjacent section using a transformation, while the original items on the central section remain unmoved.\nRead and open the new Navigator file.\nFind the points from the central section and \u2018De-Acquire\u2019 them. Instead, find the duplicated points at the bottom of the Navigator file and set them to \u2018Acquire\u2019.\nThe registration was automatically set to \u20183\u2019 in the process.

Crystals can be damaged quickly at room temperature (20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C).\nNote: When crystals (such as Wy14643-bound PPAR\u03b1-LBD crystals) are used for seeds in cross-seeding, tiny crystals obtained within 1\u20132\u00a0weeks are fine.Optional: To prepare PPAR\u03b1-LBD/ligand/coactivator (peptide) crystals, use 0.25\u00a0\u03bcL ligand solution and 0.25\u00a0\u03bcL peptide solution (4\u00a0mM in water) instead of the 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL ligand solution. This method was used to prepare crystals deposited in PDB with codes: 7BPY (with clofibric acid\u00a0+ SRC1); 7BQ0 (with fenofibric acid\u00a0+ SRC1); 7BQ1 (with iFA\u00a0+ SRC1); 7BQ3 (with GW7647\u00a0+ SRC1); and 7BQ4 (with eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]\u00a0+ SRC1).\nNote: To obtain co-crystals with PPAR\u03b1 ligands whose binding affinities are lower than iFAs, the use of delipidized hPPAR\u03b1-LBD was necessary. Clofibric acid-SRC1 (peptide)-bound delipidized hPPAR\u03b1-LBD crystals that gave high (2.09\u00a0\u00c5) resolution in X-ray crystallography were obtained after a 2-week incubation at 4\u00b0C in 0.1\u00a0M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 30% (w/v) PEG 3350 Crystallization Buffer (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. Clofibric acid-SRC1 (peptide)-bound delipidized hPPAR\u03b1-LBD crystals (PDB: 7BPY)\nClofibric acid is a relatively low-affinity PPAR\u03b1 ligand (the EC50 value for clofibric acid in coactivator recruitment assay is 574\u00a0\u03bcM, which is slightly higher than iFAs (428\u00a0\u03bcM for stearic acids and 471\u00a0\u03bcM for palmitic acid) (Kamata et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])). Clofibric acid-bound hPPAR\u03b1-LBD co-crystals were only obtained in the presence of SRC1 or GW9662 (PDB: 6KYP) using delipidized proteins. These crystals were used for soaking in bezafibrate (another low-affinity PPAR\u03b1 ligand)-rich buffer to obtain bezafibrate-SRC1-bound crystals (PDB: 7BPZ). Bar, 200\u00a0\u03bcm.\nCase 2: Cross-seeding\nTiming: 3\u00a0days to several weeksNote: Cross-seeding is generally applied when new protein-ligand co-crystals have not been obtained. Micro-seeds derived from previously obtained crystals of closely related complexes can be used for cross-seeding (Benvenuti and Mangani, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Hassell et\u00a0al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; McPherson, 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). This method was used to prepare crystals deposited in PDB with codes: 6KAX (with iFA); 6KB3 and 6KB8 (with GW7647); 6KB4 and 6KB9 (with pemafibrate); 6KB5 (with 5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid [ETYA]); 6KB6 (with tetradecylthioacetic acid [TTA]); 6KB7 (with Wy14643); 6LX6 (with palmitic acid); 6LX7 (with stearic acid); 6LX8 (with oleic acid); 6LX9 (with arachidonic acid); 6LXA (with EPA); and 6LXC (with saroglitazar).\nDilute ligand stock solution with Buffer A.\nMix 25\u00a0\u03bcL each of hPPAR\u03b1-LBD solution (20\u00a0mg/mL in Buffer A, either delipidized or not) and ligand solution in a 1.5-mL plastic tube on ice.\nDispense 200\u00a0\u03bcL Crystallization Buffer to each well of an EasyXtal 15-Well Tool X-Seal plate at 4\u00b0C.\nMix 1\u00a0\u03bcL of Crystallization Buffer and 1\u00a0\u03bcL PPAR-ligand mixed solution on the backside of the screw cap at 4\u00b0C.\nFasten the screw cap.\nCrush the seed crystals (Wy14643 or iFA-bound crystals) in 10\u00a0\u03bcL of Crystallization Buffer (crystal nuclei solution) using a needle tip (Dual-Thickness MicroMounts) at 4\u00b0C (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07. Crush of crystals to prepare crystal nuclei\nScale bars, 200\u00a0\u03bcm\nNote: Crushing the crystals may produce too many crystal nuclei. Only small numbers of nuclei (obtained by serial dilutions with Crystallization Buffer) are needed. As a rough estimate, the nuclei obtained from the crush of a 10 x 10 x 50\u00a0\u03bcm crystal could provide 40\u201380 diffraction quality crystals.\nTransfer the crystal nuclei via a single streak with a human hair to 2\u00a0\u03bcL mixture of hPPAR\u03b1-LBD/ligand in Crystallization Buffer (as used in step 10) at 4\u00b0C (Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig8.jpgFigure\u00a08. Crystal nuclei transfer to another hPPAR\u03b1-LBD/other ligand solution using a human hair\n(A) A single streak with a human hair is used for crystal nuclei transfer.\n(B) In some (bad) cases (such as iFA-bound hPPAR\u03b1-LBD crystals in 0.1\u00a0M HEPES (pH 7.5)/25% PEG 3350 buffer), many small crystals form along the lines streaked by the hair.\n(C) In some (good) cases (such as iFA-bound hPPAR\u03b1-LBD crystals in 0.1\u00a0M Bis-Tris (pH 6.5)/25% PEG 3350 buffer), small numbers of large diffraction quality crystals form independent of the streaked lines. Scale bars, 2\u00a0mm (A) or 200\u00a0\u03bcm (B and C).\nNote: We use our own (young adult males') hairs and have not compared those with commercially available hairs/whiskers of the other animal species such as horses and cats.\nFasten the screw cap.\nIncubate the plate at 4\u00b0C (see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: Steps 9\u201315 above should be performed in the cold room (4\u00b0C). Crystals can be damaged quickly at room temperature (20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C).\nNote: When only small crystals are obtained, repeat the procedure or try other conditions (different buffers) (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B and C) or lower protein concentrations (McPherson and Gavira, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) to obtain larger crystals.\nNote: The iFA-bound hPPAR\u03b1-LBD crystals that gave very high (1.23\u00a0\u00c5) resolution in X-ray crystallography were obtained after a 2-week incubation at 4\u00b0C in 0.1\u00a0M HEPES-NaOH (pH\u00a07.0) and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 Crystallization Buffer (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig9.jpg\nFigure\u00a09.

(2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (PDB: 6KAX). Scale bar, 200\u00a0\u03bcm.\nOptional: To prepare hPPAR\u03b1-LBD/ligand/coactivator (peptide) crystals, use 0.25\u00a0\u03bcL ligand\u00a0solution and 0.25\u00a0\u03bcL peptide solution (4\u00a0mM in water) instead of the 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL ligand solution.\nCase 3: SoakingTiming: 1\u00a0day to 2\u00a0weeks\nNote: The resolution of iFA-bound hPPAR\u03b1-LBD crystals was the highest in our experience (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Therefore, ligand replacement by soaking in iFA-bound crystal solution may produce high-resolution crystals with ligands that have higher affinities than iFAs (such as palmitic and stearic acid). This method was used to prepare crystals deposited in PDB with codes: 6KAY (with GW7647); 6KAZ (with pemafibrate); 6KB0 (with ETYA); 6KB1 (with TTA); 6KB2 (with Wy14643); and 6LXB (with saroglitazar).\nNote: Obtaining crystals with ligands that are only slightly soluble may be difficult (Hassell et\u00a0al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPrepare iFA-bound crystals by cross-seeding.\nDilute ligand stock solution with Soaking Buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Try 1\u00a0mM initially.\nDispense 200\u00a0\u03bcL Soaking Buffer to each well of an EasyXtal 15-Well Tool X-Seal plate at 4\u00b0C.\nPlace 5\u00a0\u03bcL ligand solution (in Soaking Buffer) on the backside of the screw cap at 4\u00b0C.\nPick up the iFA-bound crystals with a CryoLoop, wash the crystals with Soaking Buffer, and soak in 5\u00a0\u03bcL ligand solution at 4\u00b0C (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/493-Fig10.jpg\nFigure\u00a010. Transfer of crystals with a CryoLoop for soaking in other ligand solutions\nScale bar, 5\u00a0mm.\nNote: The wash step may remove precipitates around crystal surfaces. Some crystals may be cracked in this transfer step, but such fragile crystals do not finally provide high-resolution profiles.\nFasten the screw cap.\nIncubate the plate at 4\u00b0C (see troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nOptional: The iFA-SRC1-bound and clofibric acid-SRC1-bound crystals (PDB: 7BQ1 and 7BPY) were used for soaking to obtain other SRC1-bound crystals; the former was used to prepare co-crystals with pemafibrate\u00a0+ SRC1 (PDB: 7BQ2) and the latter was used to prepare co-crystals with bezafibrate\u00a0+ SRC1 (PDB: 7BPZ).Critical: Steps 17\u201322 should be performed in the cold room (4\u00b0C). Crystals can be damaged quickly at room temperature (20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C).\nNote: Ligand concentration and incubation time should be optimized for each ligand.\nCryoprotection of crystals for X-ray crystallography\nTiming: 1 h\nMix 400\u00a0\u03bcL of Crystallization Buffer and 100\u00a0\u03bcL of 100% (v/v) glycerol (Cryoprotection Buffer) in a 1.5\u00a0mL plastic tube.\nMake 5\u00a0\u03bcL drops of Cryoprotection Buffer on the backside of the screw cap of an EasyXtal 15-Well Tool X-Seal plate at 4\u00b0C.\nPick up the crystals with a CryoLoop, and soak into Cryoprotection Buffer at 4\u00b0C.\nFreeze under liquid nitrogen until X-ray diffraction data collection.\nNote: Lowering PEG 3350 concentration (from 25% to 20%) by 100% glycerol dilution could damage crystals or even dissolve them in some cases but not in our case on hPPAR\u03b1-LBD crystals.\nCritical: The use of liquid nitrogen in a walk-in cold room demands great attention. Only small volumes of liquid nitrogen should be brought into a large well-ventilated room by two or more researchers; oxygen concentrations in this room should be monitored during these procedures. Crystals can be damaged quickly at room temperature (20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C).", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDifferentiation of pluripotent stem cells into keratinocyte progenitors\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis section provides detailed description of obtaining keratinocytes from hPSCs. The first stage is the differentiation of hPSCs into keratinocyte progenitor-like cells by using retinoic acid (RA) to promote ectodermal fate (Bain et\u00a0al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) to block neural fate (Gambaro et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), which together can induce epithelial differentiation from hPSCs.\nNote: Ensure the quality of hESCs before starting the differentiation by checking the cell morphology and expression of key pluripotency markers, such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2. The cells should have a confirmed normal karyotype, free of differentiated cells, and mycoplasma contamination.\nOn day 0, remove the culture medium from the cells and wash with 1\u00a0mL PBS to remove dead cells. Treat the cells with RelesR for 4\u20135\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, then remove ReLeSR and detach the cells with media by gentle pipetting. Collect the cells in a 15\u00a0mL Falcon tube, centrifuge at 130\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 22\u00b0C and plate on Geltrex (1:100) coated plates as small clumps in mTeSR1 containing 10\u00a0\u03bcM Rock inhibitor. Split one confluent well of 6-well plate into two wells of a 6-well plate (1:2 ratio) to attain a confluency of 90\u2013100% next day. The cells can be maintained in culture until they reach 90\u2013100% confluency.\nRemove the hESC medium and wash the cells with 1\u00a0mL of DMEM/F12 basal medium. Start the differentiation by adding 2.5\u00a0mL of unconditioned medium (UCM) supplemented with 1\u00a0\u03bcM RA and 20\u00a0ng/mL BMP4.\nContinue to culture the cells for five days in UCM containing 1\u00a0\u03bcM RA and 20\u00a0ng/mL BMP4 with media change every day.On day 5, treat the cells with ReLeSR for 4\u20135\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, and then completely remove the dissociating reagent. Dissociate the cells with media and pipette gently to make small clumps of approximately 10\u201320 cells, centrifuge at 130\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 22\u00b0C, and plate the cells at 1:2 ratio onto Geltrex-coated plates. For RNA extraction and immunostaining, one well of 6-well is splitted into 4 wells of a 12-well plate and 3 wells of a 24-well plate. Add 10\u00a0\u03bcM Rock inhibitor during passaging the cells in addition to RA and BMP4.\nSwitch the media stepwise from UCM to N2 medium. On day 6, mix UCM and N2 medium at 1:1 ratio and add to the cells for stepwise transition. Change the media completely to N2 medium on day 7 and continue to treat the cells with RA and BMP4 until day 8 with media change every day.\nOn day 8, withdraw RA and BMP4 and add 10\u00a0ng/mL EGF to the N2 medium.\nContinue to culture the cells until day 14 with media change every day to differentiate the cells into keratinocyte progenitors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1885-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Gently remove the TrypLE and detach the cells with N2 medium. Following centrifugation at 130\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 22\u00b0C, plate the cells at 1:2 ratio onto Geltrex coated plate. Add 10\u00a0\u03bcM Rock inhibitor to the fresh media during passaging the cells.\nOn day 15, withdraw the Rock inhibitor and add N2 medium containing 10\u00a0ng/mL EGF.\nContinue to grow the cells in N2 medium containing 10\u00a0ng/mL EGF for 8-days with media change every other day.\nOn day 23, add 1.2\u00a0mM CaCl2 to the N2 medium containing 10\u00a0ng/mL EGF for one week to induce maturation of keratinocytes and change media every other day.\nOn day 30, check the expression of mature keratinocyte markers using Western blotting and immunostaining. The mature keratinocytes can be passaged and kept in culture until day 45 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nFor passaging keratinocytes, treat the cells with TrypLE for 4\u20135\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C.

Store the medium at 4 \u00b0C until further use.\nCalculate the volume of the enzyme solution.\n\t\u200bNOTE: The volume of the enzyme solution is the volume of the medium containing the enzymes (collagenase and DNase I) that will be needed to digest diced tissue in 6-well plates; it depends on the number of samples.\n\t\nUse the following equation to calculate the required volume:\n\t\t(Number of samples to be digested) \u00d7 5 mL of serum-free RPMI with 10 mM HEPES buffer\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: For example, for 0.1 to 0.3 g of dissected spleen, use 5 mL of medium to prepare the enzyme solution. The enzymatic digestion protocol described in this manuscript is primarily for soft tissues (ranging from 0.1 to 1 g) dissected from mice which include the brain, kidney, skin, liver, lungs, spleen, muscles, as well as capsules around subcutaneous implants made of synthetic materials or extracellular matrix proteins. Digesting hard cartilaginous tissues might require different conditions and volumes of digestive enzymes, which can only be ascertained by optimization.\nCalculate the amount of collagenase and DNase I needed for the enzyme solution.\n\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, 0.25 mg/mL of collagenase and 0.2 mg/mL of DNase I were used. The working concentrations required for collagenase and DNase can vary for different types of tissues19.\nPrepare a 1:1000 viability dye solution by adding 1 \u00b5L of the viability dye (see Table of Materials) to 999 \u00b5L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vortex the solution. Store the solution in the dark at 4 \u00b0C until further use.Prepare the staining buffer by adding 1 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to 100 mL of PBS, and vortex the solution until BSA is completely dissolved. Store the solution at 4 \u00b0C until further use.\n2) Setting up enzymatic digestion plates\nSet up a 6-well plate with 70 \u00b5m cell strainers in each well. Add 3 mL of the prepared medium from step 1.1.1 into each well, and incubate on ice.\nStore the remaining media (2 mL/well) in an incubator or water bath at 37 \u00b0C for suspending the calculated amount of collagenase and DNase I (step 1.2.2).\n3) Isolation of cells\nPlace the dissected implants/tissue into plates, and dice finely using scissors. Alternatively, utilize a mechanical disruption method using a tissue dissociator or hand-held homogenizer. Owing to the high number of leukocytes, dissect out the spleen to utilize as a staining control in each run.\n\tNOTE: As some materials induce higher levels of fibrosis, this protocol is applicable for both highly fibrotic and minimally fibrotic materials. However, each processing method should be evaluated for both cell yield and viability after digestion prior to staining. Avoid peripheral blood contamination during dissection.\nAdd collagenase and DNase I (volume calculated in step 1.2.2) to the remaining RPMI (2 mL) that has been warmed to 37 \u00b0C. Add 2 mL of the complete enzyme solution to each well.\nPlace the plates in an incubated shaker for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C and 100 rpm.\n\tNOTE: Be cautious when stacking plates as this can inhibit proper heat transfer.Meanwhile, prepare a suspension-dispensing tip by chopping 3-4 mm from the end of a 1000 \u00b5L tip with scissors. After incubation, pipette the suspension in the wells up and down to mix it thoroughly using the chopped tip. Place the cell strainer on the top of a 50 mL conical tube and pass the digested solution through the cell strainer.\n\tNOTE: The 70 \u00b5m cell strainer is sufficient to separate cells from implanted biomaterial, such as alginate. If greater purity is required, use processes such as density gradient separation to obtain an enriched population of leukocytes.\nRinse the wells with 1x PBS solution, and transfer the rinse volume through the strainer, followed by adding the washes of the strainer with 1x PBS solution until the volume in the tube reaches 50 mL.\n\tNOTE: The 1x PBS must be at room temperature to prevent any increase in the viscosity of the digest and to allow cell pelleting during centrifugation.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at room temperature. Following centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant carefully using a serological pipette without disturbing the pellet. Re-suspend the pellet in 1000 \u00b5L of 1x PBS, and transfer the suspension to a microcentrifuge tube.\nMix 10 \u00b5L of the cell suspension with 10 \u00b5L of trypan blue, and load the suspension on counting chamber slides for counting cells using an automatic cell counter or on a hemocytometer to count via the conventional method under a microscope. Alternatively, use flow cytometry cell counting beads.\n4) Staining for flow cytometrySee Figure 2 for an example plate layout for a 14-color experiment with 45 samples, fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls, compensation controls, and a fully stained spleen sample control. After estimating the total number of cells, calculate the volume of the cell suspension required for staining 1 \u00d7 106 cells for each sample, and 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells for each compensation and FMO control. Dispense the required volume of the cell suspension into the wells of a V-bottom 96-well plate, and make up the volume to 100 \u00b5L with 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: As an example, if 1000 \u00b5L of cell suspension obtained at step 3.6 contain 40 \u00d7 106 cells, then for 1 \u00d7 106 cells, 1000/40 \u00d7 106 = 25 \u00b5L of cell suspension will be required.\nCentrifuge the plate at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, aspirate the supernatant, and then resuspend the cells in the sample wells and in a compensation control well to determine viability, with 100 \u00b5L of a 1:1000 solution of the viability dye (see Table of Materials).\nFor cells in the other compensation wells as well as FMO and unstained wells, resuspend them with 100 \u00b5L of 1x PBS.\nIncubate the cells in the dark for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nIn the meantime, prepare a surface antibody cocktail for staining the sample and FMO controls: 50 \u00b5L per sample or FMO. See Table 1 for an example of the antibody cocktail.\nAfter incubation, add 100 \u00b5l of 1x PBS to each well, spin down at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 200 \u00b5L of staining buffer (1x PBS + 1% BSA); centrifuge at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.Aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in the compensation, FMO, and unstained wells with 50 \u00b5L of 1x PBS. Add 50 \u00b5L of the antibody cocktail to the respective sample wells and FMO wells. Add the respective antibodies to the different compensation wells.\nIncubate the plate for 45 min in the dark at 4 \u00b0C. After incubation, add 150 \u00b5L of staining buffer in each well, and centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells with 200 \u00b5L of staining buffer, and centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nIf analyzing samples without fixation, resuspend them in 200 \u00b5L of staining buffer, and proceed to section 6 on cytometer setup and sample analysis. If fixing the cells, aspirate the supernatant after washing, and add 100 \u00b5L of a fixative such as 4% paraformaldehyde. If staining for intracellular markers, proceed to section 5 on intracellular staining, and fix and permeabilize the cells (see Table of Materials). Incubate cells for 20 min in the dark at 4 \u00b0C.\n\tNOTE: As fixation can affect the fluorescence intensity of some fluorophores, evaluate each panel both with and without fixation.\nAfter incubation, add 100 \u00b5L of 1x PBS, followed by centrifugation at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend in 1x PBS, and centrifuge at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nRe-suspend the cells in 200 \u00b5L of staining buffer, and store at 4 \u00b0C prior to flow cytometric analysis.\n5) Intracellular stainingContinuing from step 4.11 for fixation and permeabilization for intracellular markers, add 100 \u00b5L of the appropriate buffer. Centrifuge the cells at 350 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Aspirate the supernatant, and re-suspend the pellets in 200 \u00b5L of the fixative-permeabilizing agent solution; centrifuge the cells at 350 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the pellets with intracellular antibodies diluted in the appropriate buffer.\n\tNOTE: Antibody types and dilutions will depend on the target cells. For example, one common intracellular marker is forkhead box P3 for regulatory T cells, which is frequently used at a 1:100 dilution.\nIncubate the cell suspension in the dark for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C. After incubation, add 150 \u00b5L of the appropriate buffer, and centrifuge the suspension at 350 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatant, and re-suspend the cells in 200 \u00b5L of staining buffer followed by centrifugation at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Aspirate and re-suspend the cells in 200 \u00b5L of staining buffer for flow cytometric analysis.\n6) Cytometer and compensation setup\nImmediately before running the samples, prepare compensation beads (see Table of Materials) if utilizing bead-based compensation as opposed to cell-based compensation.\n\t\nLabel separate microcentrifuge tubes for each fluorochrome-conjugated antibody, and add 100 \u00b5L of 1x PBS followed by one full drop of anti-mouse negative control compensation beads and one drop of positive control compensation beads to each tube. Add 1 \u00b5L of the appropriate antibody to each separate tube. Vortex and incubate for 5 min before acquisition.\n\t\tNOTE: As some dyes, such as BUV737, cannot be bound to beads, use a cell-based control.Calibrate the flow cytometer before each experiment by running the cytometer setup with the tracking beads, and maintain the flow cytometer settings for each experiment.\nBefore analyzing the sample, adjust the flow cytometer by running an unstained sample to adjust the cell population on a side scatter (SSC) versus forward scatter (FSC) plot so that the cell population falls in the center of the plot and is not off-scale.\nRun the stained sample briefly to adjust the voltages for FSC and SSC and for each channel to make sure that no events fall outside the logarithmic scale of each channel. Record 5,000 events for each compensation control, followed by gating of positive and negative populations. Calculate the compensation matrix and then run the samples, gathering at least 1,000 events for the populations of interest.\n\tNOTE: Compensation on larger-color panels should be verified, as automated compensation can be prone to over- or under-compensation. Each parameter should be graphed against every other parameter to monitor for signs of over- or under-compensation, and each single-color control should be evaluated. Complex compensation of larger-color experiments should be carried out with the assistance of a collaborator or a core facility with extensive flow cytometry experience. Newer types of flow cytometers such as spectral cytometers utilize the full spectrum of a fluorophore through a process known as spectral unmixing, which can yield a cleaner distinction of fluorescent overlap as compared to standard compensation alone22.\nSubscription Required.

Anesthesia Using Isoflurane Gas\nPre-fill the acrylic glass incubation chamber with high-quality O2 at a continuous flow rate of approximately 1-2 L/min from an anesthetic machine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nTransfer the rat to the incubation chamber tail first and close the incubation chamber lid to create an airtight seal.\nBegin to fill the incubation chamber with veterinary-grade isoflurane at 3-4% v/v dissolved in O2 at a continuous flow rate of 1-2 L/min (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\tCAUTION: Waste anesthetic gases can adversely affect handlers. A scavenger system (i.e., a charcoal filter or exhaust directly into a fume hood) must always be in place.\nWhen the rat is no longer able to stand, transfer the rat to a face mask or nose cone receiving 1-3% isoflurane dissolved in O2 at a flow rate of 1-2 L/min. Rats primarily breathe through their nose and so, as long as the nose is covered by the face mask or nose cone, there will be sufficient anesthesia delivery.\nApply ophthalmic lubrication to the delicate membranes of the eyes to protect them from any escaped isoflurane gas.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that ophthalmic lubrication is without antibiotic, as this may affect outcomes from an intervention.\nMeasure palpebral (eye blinking response to gentle stimulation of palpebral opening) and pedal (withdrawal of hind limbs in response to pinching) reflexes; with increasing depth of anesthesia, palpebral reflex will be absent before pedal reflexes (Supplementary Figure 2).\nWhen an appropriate level of anesthesia is reached and the rat has lost both palpebral and pedal reflexes, maintain the rat on 0.5-2% isoflurane dissolved in O2 at a flow rate of 1-2 L/min.Continuously monitor the breathing rate of the rat throughout the procedure by keeping a constant visual on the rat either directly with an internal monitoring system or through the live-video feed (Supplementary Figure 3).\n2. Positioning and Restraint of the Rat Hind Limb\nLay the rat in the supine position on the carbon-fiber scanner bed (Supplementary Figure 4).\nRestrain the right foot in a malleable, foam tube, with the toes extending out of the end of the tube. Apply dental wax to hold the foot tightly within the foam and tape the tube closed tightly. Ensure that the diameter of the tube holding the foot is enough to fit firmly into the plastic tube.\nSlide the plastic tube into the X-ray scanner bed (Supplementary Figure 5).\nExtend the rat hind limb until it is taut. Do not over-extend the leg as to cause any harm to the rat (Supplementary Figure 5) as this may induce involuntary movement in the limbs due to labored respiration.\nPull the left leg (non-scanned hind limb) along with the tail out of the scanning field of view and toward the torso, away from the extended leg to be scanned.\nSecure the left leg (non-scanned hind limb) and the tail in position using masking tape. Do not use anything more or less sticky (i.e., duct tape or painter's tape) as these materials will either harm the rat when they are removed (duct tape) or not provide a strong enough hold (painter's tape) (Supplementary Figure 6).\nSecure the rat body into position at the hips, shoulders, and head with the masking tape. Secure the face mask or nose cone to the rat (Supplementary Figure 6).NOTE: Blot the adhesive side of the masking tape to remove its ability to stick to the rat fur. Do not blot the ends of the masking tape so that it may be firmly secured to the scanning bed.\nWrap the rat in vet-wrap to limit heat loss (Supplementary Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: When under general anesthesia, rats lose heat rapidly due to their large surface to body weight ratio 19,20.\nContinuously monitor the breathing rate of the rat throughout the procedure by keeping a constant visual on the rat (either directly or through a live-video feed).\n\tNOTE: Here set up takes 5 min, scan acquisition is acquisition setting-dependent, and recovery time is 60 mins.\nProceed to acquire the \u00b5CT images.\n\tNOTE: The exact specifications for scan acquisition are specific to each scanner type, software system and the specific research question, however, several methodological publications exist throughout the literature 1,2,9.\n3. Recovery from Anesthesia\nAfter in vivo \u00b5CT scanning is complete, stop the flow of isoflurane to the rat but maintain a 1-2 L/min flow of O2.\nWhen the rat regains motor control (1-2 min), remove it from the respirator and allow it to recover individually in a cage placed partially on a general-purpose heating pad at low heat. Rats are known to reduce their body temperature by 1 \u00b0C when under general anesthetic19. Do not leave the rat unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n\tNOTE: Anecdotal evidence from our research group reports that immediately following recovery from isoflurane anesthesia, rats begin to eat and so it is important to have their food and water available to them during recovery. Although we have observed this behavior, repeated general anesthesia does not cause a significant increase in food intake or body weight 1,9.", "**Ubp-M knock-down cell lines**\nUbp-M knock-down cell lines were generated using a vector-based knockdown strategy as previously described \\(Wang et al., 2004). \n1.

The estimated time for cutting depends on the cohort size and experience.\nTissue collection and sectioning.\nCollect fresh, unfixed tissue samples.\nPlace the tissue, with the cutting plane down, in a labelled cryomold and add OCT compound until the tissue is completely covered.\nTransfer the cryomold into a dry ice-cooled container of isopentane and let it float until the OCT has solidified.\nStore the cryomold on dry ice until all samples are collected and store them at \u221280\u00b0C in sealed bags or wrapped in aluminum foil to minimize drying out.\nCut 7\u00a0\u03bcm thick cryosections (e.g., with Cryostat, CM 3050, Leica) and collect them on sequential microscopy slides.\nNote: Sequential cutting will furnish flanking tissue sections, positioned on consecutive slides, to enable complementary analyses to the multispectral image, such as immunohistochemistry, mass spectrometry or spatial transcriptomics.\nDry the slides in a desiccator for several hours at room temperature (at around 20\u00b0C) before storing them at \u221280\u00b0C (for up to several months).\nCritical: It is important to air-dry the tissue sections completely before freezing to prevent tissue damage through crystallization.Critical: For mass spectrometry imaging, conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) slides are used to mount the tissue sections. The use of OCT medium for embedding is not advisable as residues of OCT may remain on the tissue sections and cause analyte signal suppression in mass spectrometry imaging through competition with tissue compounds for ions during the ionization process.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Instead, tissue sections can be cut from non-embedded snap frozen tissue. Cut tissue sections on ITO slides should be kept at \u221220\u00b0C and not be dehydrated. For spatial transcriptomics, continue with specific slides and/or collect tissues in a confined area of the slide, as recommended by the respective manufacturer.\nAntibody titration and the composition of a spectral library\nTiming: 2\u00a0days\nThis section describes the preparation steps for multispectral imaging. It details how the fluorescent emission spectrum for each individual fluorochrome must be recorded on tissue sections single-stained with correspondingly labelled antibodies to compose a spectral library. In Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], the principle of multispectral imaging and spectral unmixing can be observed, while Table\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] shows the filter setup used by Goossens et\u00a0al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] which can still be further adapted to the users\u2019 preferences. When combining a set of fluorochrome-coupled antibodies for multispectral imaging only dyes should be included that are excited by a similar electromagnetic wavelength but whose emissions have different peak intensities and limited spectral overlap.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3011-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Principle of multispectral imaging and spectral unmixing\nThe tissue section is incubated with a set of dye-coupled antibodies and subsequently imaged using the Nuance FX camera. Spectral unmixing of the composite image will produce an image cube containing the spectral contributions of each dye to the composite image. Using a spectral library, this image cube can be deconvoluted into single grayscale images, each representing one spectral component (dye).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3011_1.csvFix, block and optionally bleach cryosections.\nThaw and air-dry cryosections.\nFix 5\u00a0min with dry acetone.\nImmerse slides in blocking buffer.\nOptional step: Overnight exposure slides in blocking buffer to high-power near-UV light in a cold room (4\u00b0C), as we previously described.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] An alternative bleaching method is detailed in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3011-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Bleaching of tissue autofluorescence and subsequent immunofluorescent imaging of atherosclerotic plaque tissue\n(A) Schematic representation of the custom-designed bleaching box, as previously described by us.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This box features a mounting plateau that can accommodate up to 12 tissue slides (orange); near-UV (400\u00a0nm) light (purple) by 4 rows of 7 high-power (3 W) LEDs (yellow), evenly distributed over the box; two power sources (green), and both active (fans) and passive (fins) cooling units to prevent the LEDs and tissue sections from overheating.

This could for instance be done via the custom-designed bleaching box, depicted in Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A which proved very effective to reduce tissue autofluorescence, increasing the stainings\u2019 signal-to-noise ratio and thereby facilitating spectral unmixing.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This measure makes multispectral imaging also suitable for analysis of previously challenging tissues where high levels of autofluorescence competed with the dyes\u2019 signal.\nFluorescent staining.\nDilute antibodies individually in cold blocking buffer containing 7-AAD nuclear dye just prior to staining.\nApply antibody solution on tissue sections and incubate for 4\u00a0h in the dark at 4\u00b0C.Note: Optionally, tissues can be lined with a PAP pen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to avoid spill-over of the antibody mix on neighboring tissue sections.\nWash three times with PBS.\nMount coverslip with 50\u00a0\u03bcL water-based antifade mounting medium (e.g., Prolong Gold, Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nLeave the mounted slides to dry for 60\u00a0min at room temperature (around 20\u00b0C) in the dark before imaging or storing at 4\u00b0C.\nSpectral library composition.\nFor each stained tissue section, acquire image cubes for each of the excitation filters (Table\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: This is done to visualize the antibody-specific signal and possible bleed-through in different image cubes.\nNote: Repeat for different antibody concentrations to titrate the optimal dilution.\nDefine the mean emission spectrum over several pixels with sufficiently high signal-to noise ratio. Check if the detected spectrum corresponds with the theoretical spectrum (as provided by the manufacturer).\nCritical: Assess the risk of bleed-through in other spectra and image cubes. For example, when imaging a signal from a dye that is excited at 420\u00a0nm and detected at around 650\u00a0nm, check whether a similar signal is also detectable upon excitation with 488\u00a0nm (problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nSave the spectrum in the spectral library as a reference for this dye.\nNote: These individually recorded fluorescent emission patterns will be combined in a spectral library, which aggregates the dyes\u2019 spectra for a fixed excitation wavelength with the tissue\u2019s endogenous autofluorescence spectra, recorded on an unstained section.\nUnmix the image cube into background and dye-specific signal components to assess the specificity of the newly defined spectrum.\nRepeat for the individual dyes and combine the reference spectra into spectral libraries.Note: When a tissue section is stained with a combination of dye-coupled antibodies and imaged using the exact same settings, this spectral library can be used as a reference to computationally deconvolute each of the pixels into their individual fluorescent components, thereby creating a series of images that represent each fluorochrome\u2019s contribution to the overall-measured fluorescence (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: Contrary to conventional immunofluorescence, where the signal from each fluorochrome is measured as the average intensity in a broad, dye-specific wavelength range, multispectral fluorescence imaging is based on full emission spectra detected for each pixel. In brief, while keeping the excitation constant, multiple images of one field-of-view (FOV) are recorded at narrow, stepwise incrementing wavelength ranges covering the whole visible spectrum. All these two-dimensional images are assembled into a so-called image cube, thereby creating for each individual pixel a third \u201cwavelength\u201d dimension.\nNote: In order to increase the number of compatible antibodies per staining, spectral scans with different excitation wavelengths can be combined. As an example, Table\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] shows the setup as used in the article by Goossens et\u00a0al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Different sets of dye-coupled antibodies were excited using four consecutive filter cubes: blue (I3 filter), green (N2.1 filter), UV (A filter) and near-UV light (S Blue Aqua filter, all Leica). Every excitation filter comes with its own spectral library, covering the corresponding excited fluorochromes and tissue autofluorescence.\nNote: Compare the fluorescent emission pattern of each dye with the theoretical pattern on the manufacturer\u2019s website. Both experimental and manufacturer\u2019s pattern should resemble each other in peak emission, range and shape.Note: The antibody titration and composition of spectral library must be repeated for every tissue type because of tissue-specific autofluorescence that can contribute to the detected fluorochrome-specific spectrum. Thus, separate spectral libraries should be created for every tissue type/species. When designing variations of a library to allow the combination of several custom markers with a fixed set of antibodies, consider assigning the varying slot to a commercially common fluorochrome, such as Alexa Fluor 488.\nCritical: Fluorescent dyes strongly differ in emission intensity and the intensities of fluorochromes cannot be scaled individually. Therefore, it is important to stain the markers that show the lowest expression with antibodies coupled to the brightest fluorochromes. In addition, antibody concentrations should be titrated for each of the markers in the panel until similar signal intensities are detected for each, which reduces spectral overlap-based erroneous identification of combined dyes upon unmixing.\nCritical: For staining we strongly recommend the use of primary dye-conjugated antibodies to minimize the risk of cross-reaction between antibodies resulting from a limited number of commercially available species during multiplexing. The associated disadvantage is that signal amplification is not possible and that relatively high antibody concentrations are required for detectable signal.\nCritical: After the short fixation step, tissue sections must stay hydrated during the whole procedure. Drying will decrease staining quality and increase tissue autofluorescence.\nCritical: It is important to keep all variables (e.g., magnification, lamp intensity, exposure time) constant during spectral library composition and multiplex imaging.\nMultispectral imaging\nTiming: 3\u00a0days\nAfter definition of the spectral library and titration of all markers according to step 3 and 4, tissue sections will be stained with the complete antibody panel in one single shot.Note: This single-shot approach is less time-consuming and laborious compared to sequential staining methods that often compromise antigen and fluorochrome stability as well as tissue integrity over the course of several staining cycles.\nNote: The images shown in this protocol were obtained from multiplex staining on murine atherosclerotic plaques.\nFix and bleach cryosections.\nRepeat procedure as in Step 2.\nMultiplex antibody staining.\nDilute antibodies included in the complete antibody panel, using the appropriate titration in cold blocking buffer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3011_2.csv\nNote: The complete 15-plex antibody panel and the respective dilutions used for staining of murine atherosclerotic plaque are listed in Table\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nApply the antibody mix on PAP pen-lined tissue sections.\nIncubate the slides for 4\u00a0h in the dark at 4\u00b0C.\nWash 3 times by fully immersing the slides in PBS.\nNote: If required, incubate another 60\u00a0min with secondary antibodies, each specific for not more than one of the primary antibodies, and wash again 3 times with PBS.\nMount coverslip with 50\u00a0\u03bcL water-based antifade mountant (e.g., Prolong Gold).\nLeave slides to dry for 60\u00a0min at room temperature (at around 20\u00b0C) in the dark.\nPause point: The slides can be stored at 4\u00b0C in the dark until the next day for imaging.\nAcquire image cubes for every region of interest.\nUnmix the image cubes based on their corresponding spectral libraries to obtain single channel grayscale images.\nSave each grayscale image as a .jpg file.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3011-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03.

A Schematic representation of the dye combination used for Figures\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A\u20133P and shown in Table\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] is depicted in Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nCritical: The tissue section must not be moved in between the acquisition with different excitation filters to allow alignment of all grayscale images.\nNote: The acquisition of multiple, non-overlapping images from one tissue section ensures a better definition of cell subsets as it reduces the possible bias inherent to a manual selection of a field of view.\nNote: Depending on the study objective, parallel cell type-specific markers or several phenotypic markers to distinguish subsets of a single cell type, if desired complemented with reporters of the cell\u2019s status (e.g., activation, proliferation, ROS), can be utilized to visualize cells and their cellular context.Note: In case of a high similarity between emission spectra, the use of a negative control and fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) stainings is necessary to validate the correct unmixing of the staining.\nNote: Documentation of the localization of each field of view on the slide will facilitate retracing it on the subsequently H&E-stained tissue section. This can be done by either annotating a schematic drawing of the tissue section or by annotation on a histology image of an adjacent section.\nNote: To limit undesired photobleaching, we recommend starting exposure with the image cube requiring the shortest exposure time. Starting with the highest excitation wavelength could also prevent spectral bleaching at lower wavelength due to Stokes\u2019 shift.\nNote: For optimal visualization, signal-to-noise ratios for each image can be increased in ImageJ. Apply the same settings for all images of the same marker over the different fields of view to avoid bias.\nH&E staining.\nSubmerge the fluorescently imaged slides, angled and with the coverslip facing down, in PBS and leave them at 37\u00b0C until the cover slip spontaneously detaches (about 20\u201330\u00a0min) to avoid tissue damage during coverslip removal.\nProceed with a standard H&E staining.\nMount the slide with a non-aqueous mounting medium (e.g., Prolong Gold) to allow long-term storage.\nAcquire images of the same regions of interest that were fluorescently imaged, but at a lower magnification (e.g., multispectral imaging with a 20\u00d7 objective, subsequent bright-field imaging with a 10\u00d7 objective) to later allow cropping it to the same dimensions.\nMultispectral imaging data preparation for downstream analysis\nTiming: 1\u20135\u00a0daysHere we describe steps that serve as a guideline on how to prepare the acquired multiplex images for downstream analysis. The H&E image acquired in Step 7c will be aligned with the fluorescent images and used for cell segmentation. Afterwards, the mean fluorescent intensity of every dye can be measured for each segmented cell.\nAlignment of the H&E image and the fluorescent images.\nNote: Alignment of the H&E image allows the quantification of fluorescence intensities of each marker per individual cell, as well as histopathological characterization of the cells\u2019 morphology, location and microenvironment\nDownload the \u2018AutoRegi_Nuance_HE.mlapp\u2019 app from GitHub.\nInstall it in MATLAB.\nNote: Make sure you have previously added the 'Image processing Toolbox\u2019 to your MATLAB.\nRun the script, a pop-up window will appear.\nClick \u201cload\u201d to open a fluorescent image of the nuclear staining (7-AAD) and the corresponding H&E image file (H&E) from the same tissue section.\nStay in the \u2018manually\u2019 panel to align the image manually by selecting landmarks on both fluorescent image and H&E image.\nNote: Use the \u2018auto\u2019 panel for automatic alignment.\nSelect the \u2018selectpoint\u2019, and click \u2018run\u2019, a new window will show the fluorescent and bright-field images next to each other.\nClick to place a crosshair on a recognizable landmark in one image and select the corresponding point in the other image.\nRepeat this step several times until minimally 5 landmarks, spread over the field of view, are assigned.\nNote: To verify accuracy of overlay, click the icon depicting two landmarks to let the script predict additional points.

After cooling, sections were washed and blocked for 1 h at 20 \u00b0C using TNK buffer \\(0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.55 M NaCl, 0.1 mM KCl, 0.5% BSA, and 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS) containing either 1% normal goat serum \\(for subsequent detection of DDX4-COOH in human ovary, YBX2 and LHX8 in human ovary) or 1% normal donkey serum \\(DDX4-NH2 in human ovary and KIT in human ovary). Sections were then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of primary antibody \\(in TNK buffer with 1% normal serum) overnight at 4 \u00b0C washed in PBS, and incubated for 30 min at 20 \u00b0C with a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 \\(DDX4-COOH detection in human ovary), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 \\(LHX8 detection in human ovary) or donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 \\(DDX4-NH2 detection in human ovary and KIT detection in human ovary). For assessment of YBX2 expression in human ovary, primary antibody was detected using a goat anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG for 1 h at 20 \u00b0C, followed by reaction with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 568.

Next, the human oocytes were transplanted within oviduct and were grown during 24 weeks within the oviduct.\nStep 6: Human Follicle Counting\n Follicles were only counted when the dark-staining nucleolus was seen within the nucleus of the oocytes to prevent recounting of the same follicle.", "NOTE: This protocol describes the preparation of cell-free TX-TL system from recombinant components. For convenience, the work is separated into five parts. The first part describes preparation steps, which should be done before starting the protocol. The second part describes the preparation of the OnePot protein solution. The third part describes ribosome purifications, the fourth part details the preparation of the energy solution, and the last part provides a manual for setting up a PURE reaction. For convenience, the protocols are divided into days and summarized in daily schedules in Table 1. Following the schedule, the whole system can be prepared in 1 week by one person.\n1. Preliminary work\nPrepare the bacterial culture media and media supplements as described in Supplementary Table 1. Prepare and sterilize the materials required, including pipette tips, 96 deep-well plates.\nStrain preparation\n\t\nTransform the expression strains indicated in Table 2 with the corresponding expression vectors using the heat shock method.\n\t\t\nAdd purified plasmid to the chemically competent bacteria and incubate on ice for 20-30 min.\nPlace the mixture at 42\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 s (heat shock) and then place it back on ice for 2 min.\nPipette 20\u00a0\u00b5L of the bacteria directly onto agar plates containing ampicillin (AMP) and incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight.

After 2 h, induce the cells with 100 \u00b5M of Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and grow for an additional 3 h.\nMix 10\u00a0\u00b5L of the culture with 10\u00a0\u00b5L of 2x Laemmli buffer and heat to 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10 min. Spin the samples for 1\u00a0min using a table centrifuge and load 10\u00a0\u00b5L of the supernatant on a PAGE gel. Run the gel in Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer at 200 V for 30 min. Rinse it well with deionized water. Cover the gel with a Coomassie protein stain and incubate for 1 h. Destain the gel in water if necessary (representative results for the expression test in Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Use gradient (4%-15% or 4%-20%) PAGE gels to achieve a good separation.\nIMAC Sepharose resin restoration and cleaning\n\t\nColumn preparation.\n\t\t\nMix the Sepharose resin well by vortexing.\nPipette the required amount of resin into an empty gravity flow column.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The amount of resin required varies between His-ribosome purification and protein purification and is specified in the respective sections.\nWash the resin with 30\u00a0mL of deionized water.\nProceed with column re-charge as specified in section 1.4.4.NOTE: Always let all the liquid pass through the column before continuing with the next step. However, make sure that the column never runs dry. Whenever running any liquid through the column, ensure to stop the flow or continue to the next step as soon as the liquid reaches the resin.\nRestoration.\n\t\t\nWash the column with 30\u00a0mL of deionized water.\nApply 10\u00a0mL of a 0.2 M EDTA and 0.5 M NaCl solution.\nAdd 30\u00a0mL of a 0.5 M NaCl solution.\nWash the column with 50\u00a0mL of deionized water.\nStore in 20%\u00a0(v/v) ethanol at 4\u00a0\u00b0C or continue with the next step.\nCleaning.\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear protective equipment.\n\t\t\nWash the column with 30\u00a0mL of 0.5 M NaOH.\nWash the column with 30\u00a0mL of deionized water.\nWash the column with 30\u00a0mL of 0.1 M acetic acid.\nWash the column with 30\u00a0mL of deionized water.\nWash the column with 30\u00a0mL of 70%\u00a0(v/v) ethanol.\nWash the column with 50\u00a0mL of deionized water.\nStore in 20%\u00a0(v/v) ethanol at 4\u00a0\u00b0C or continue with the next step.\nRe-charging.\n\t\t\nAdd 10\u00a0mL of 0.1 M nickel sulfate solution to the column.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: Nickel sulfate is toxic.

OnePot protein solution expression and purificationNOTE: The protocol consists of three parts divided into days (Figure 2). An ideal preparation procedure produces 1.5\u00a0mL of 13.5 mg/mL OnePot protein solution, which corresponds to more than one thousand 10\u00a0\u00b5L PURE reactions. However, the amount and the ideal concentration of the solution will vary from batch to batch. Experienced users can perform multiple OnePot PURE preparations at a time.\nDay 1:\nPrepare bacterial culture media and media supplements as described in Supplementary Table 1.\nPrepare and sterilize the required materials, including pipette tips, two 96 deep-well plates, and one 1 L baffled Erlenmeyer flask.\nPrepare buffers and supplements as described in Supplementary Table 2. Filter sterilize all buffers using bottle top filters (0.45\u00a0\u00b5m) and store them at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Supplement all the buffers with 1\u00a0mM TCEP right before use, unless indicated otherwise.\nUse 2\u00a0mL of sepharose resin for the OnePot protein purification. Prepare the column as described in section 1.4.\nTo prepare the starter cultures, combine 20\u00a0mL of LB media with 20\u00a0\u00b5L of AMP. In a sterile 96, 1.3\u00a0mL deep-well plate, add 300\u00a0\u00b5L of the media into 35 wells. Inoculate each of them with its respective strain, except elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu), and seal the plate with a breathable membrane.\n\tNOTE: Inoculate the plate using a 96-well replicator (see Table of Materials). The well volume of the deep-well plate and the volume of the starter culture are essential. Larger media volumes or smaller well volumes will lead to a different bacterial density due to aeration inconsistencies.\nFor the EF-Tu culture, inoculate 3\u00a0mL of LB media in a 14\u00a0mL culture tube with a snap cap. A single 3\u00a0mL of culture for EF-Tu is sufficient for one OnePot expression culture.Incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C while shaking at 260\u00a0rpm overnight.\nDay 2:\nNOTE: Perform all the steps at room temperature unless indicated otherwise.\nTransfer 500\u00a0mL of LB media and 500\u00a0\u00b5L of AMP into the sterile baffled flask.\nInoculate the OnePot PURE culture with 1675\u00a0\u00b5L of the EF-Tu culture and 55\u00a0\u00b5L of each of the cultures from the deep-well plate (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: During this step, the overall protein composition can be adjusted by tuning the inoculation ratios. Make sure that the overall inoculation volume remains constant at 3.6 mL.\n\tOPTIONAL: To confirm that all strains have grown overnight, measure the optical density of the overnight cultures at 600\u00a0nM (OD600) in a 96-well plate using a plate-reader. Use a dilution of 10x for the optical density measurement.\nIncubate the culture for 2\u00a0 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with a shaking of 260\u00a0rpm, or until the OD600 of the culture reaches 0.2-0.3.\nInduce the culture with 500\u00a0\u00b5L of 0.1\u00a0mM IPTG and grow for an additional 3 h.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 3220 x g for 10\u00a0min and store the cell pellet at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further use.\n\tNOTE: To optimize the timing, prepare the energy solution described in section 4 during the incubation times on day 2 (Table 1).\nDay 3:\nMeasure the amounts of buffers needed for the purification described in the steps below and add TCEP to all of them as indicated in Supplementary Table 2. Store the remaining buffers without TCEP at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for future purifications.\nEquilibrate the charged column (section 2.4) with 30\u00a0mL of buffer A. After 25\u00a0mL of buffer A have passed through, close the column from the bottom. In parallel, continue with steps 2.15-2.17.Thaw the cells and use a serological pipette to resuspend the cell pellet in 7.5\u00a0mL of buffer A.\nLyse the cells using a 130-watt probe sonicator (see Table of Materials, probe tip diameter: 6\u00a0mm) with the following parameters: 4 x 20 s pulse on, 20 s pulse off, 70% amplitude. If sonication is successful, the solution will turn darker (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Make sure to keep the cells on ice during sonication. Place the probe deep enough into the solution without touching the tube. If a large amount of foam is generated, the energy transfer will be damped. In that case, let the foam settle, lower the probe deeper into the solution, and extend the sonication time.\nRemove the cell debris by centrifugation at 21130 x g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C immediately after sonication. Keep the lysate on ice.\nAdd the supernatant to the equilibrated column. Close the column from the top and make sure there is no leakage. Incubate the column for 3\u00a0 h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C under rotation using a tube rotator.\nElute unbound components from the column and wash with 25\u00a0mL of buffer A.\nWash the column with 25\u00a0mL of 25\u00a0mM imidazole buffer (23.95\u00a0mL of buffer A and 1.25\u00a0mL of buffer B).\nElute the proteins with 5\u00a0mL of 450\u00a0mM imidazole buffer (0.5\u00a0mL of buffer A and 4.5\u00a0mL of buffer B). Keep the eluted proteins on ice at all times.\nDilute the eluate with 25\u00a0mL of HT buffer, keep the mixture on ice. Add 15\u00a0mL to a 15\u00a0mL centrifugal filter and concentrate to a volume of 1.5 mL. Add the remaining 15\u00a0mL to the filter with the concentrated solution and concentrate to 1.5\u00a0mL once more.Add 10\u00a0mL of HT buffer to the concentrated sample and concentrate to 1 mL. Add an equal amount of stock buffer B and store at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further use.\n\tNOTE: One round of exchange/concentration takes about 60\u00a0min spinning at 3220 x g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nDuring the buffer exchange, restore the column as specified in section 1.4.\nDay 4:\nMeasure the protein concentration using the Bradford assay as described by the supplier. Concentrate the sample with a 0.5\u00a0mL of 3 kDa cutoff centrifugal filter to 20 mg/mL.\n\tNOTE: Dilute the protein solution 25-fold or 50-fold before the concentration measurements to avoid oversaturating the Bradford assay.\nTo establish the ideal protein concentration, perform an expression test at this stage (section 5.2) with different concentrations of the protein solution. To perform the titration, keep the total volume of the solution constant and pipette the OnePot protein solution, including stock buffer B, at five different ratios (Supplementary Table 7).\nVerify the OnePot PURE protein composition using SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A). Dilute 2.5\u00a0\u00b5L of the sample with 7.5\u00a0\u00b5L of water, mix with 10\u00a0\u00b5L of 2x Laemmli buffer and then load 5\u00a0\u00b5L and 2.5\u00a0\u00b5L of the samples to the gel. Run the SDS-PAGE as specified in section 1.3.3.\nAliquot the protein solution into 50\u00a0\u00b5L aliquots after verifying the expression and adjusting the concentration. Store the OnePot PURE protein solution at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further use.\n\tNOTE: If a protein component is suspected not to be present, or is present in a lower-than-expected concentration in the OnePot PURE, perform the following steps.\nCheck whether the overnight culture of the respective strain has grown at a comparable rate to the other cultures by performing optical density measurements (OD600) of all cultures.Perform an additional expression test of the specific strain to verify the expression of the suspect protein.\n3. Ribosome solution\nNOTE: Two different ribosome purification strategies are introduced, one for hexahistidine-tagged and one for non-tagged ribosomes. The major advantage of the purification method using His-purification on a standard affinity Ni-NTA gravity flow column is that the purification is easy, fast, and does not require additional laboratory equipment, such as a FPLC system and an ultracentrifuge. However, the protein production capacity in OnePot PURE reactions is around one-third compared to tag-free ribosomes. Therefore, choose the method for ribosome production based on whether a high yield is important for the given application.\nHis-tagged ribosome purification\n\tNOTE: This protocol utilizes the E. coli RB1 strain, a gift from Professor Wang (Columbia University, USA)18. This strain has a genomic insertion of a hexahistidine tag on the C terminus of 50S ribosomal protein (L7/L12), allowing for purification using a Ni-NTA gravity-flow column. The usual yield is around 0.5\u00a0mL of 3.45 \u00b5M ribosomes, which is sufficient for more than five hundred 10\u00a0\u00b5L PURE reactions.\nDay 1:\nPrepare bacterial culture media and media supplements as described in Supplementary Table 1.\nPrepare and sterilize the required materials, including pipette tips, one 5 L Erlenmeyer flask, and one 100\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nPrepare buffers and supplements as described in Supplementary Table 2. Filter sterilize all the buffers using bottle top filters (0.45\u00a0\u00b5m) and store them at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nDay 2:\nPipette 5\u00a0mL of resin to a column and prepare the column as specified in section 1.4.\n\tNOTE: Due to the higher volume of the resin, the restoration and purification take significantly longer. Use a different column for ribosome purification to avoid cross-contamination and thoroughly clean it before the purification.Prepare an overnight culture of E. coli RB1 strain by inoculating 35\u00a0mL of LB media in a 100\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C while shaking at 260\u00a0rpm.\nDay 3:\nNOTE: Perform all the steps at room temperature unless indicated otherwise.\nAdd 2 L of LB media into a 5 L sterile flask, inoculate with 12\u00a0mL of the overnight culture, and then incubate for 3-4\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C while shaking at 260\u00a0rpm.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, perform bacterial culturing in 4 x 500\u00a0mL of cultures in 1 L baffled flasks.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 10\u00a0min at 3220 x g and 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Store at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further use.\nDay 4:\nEquilibrate the column prepared in step 3.1.4. with 30\u00a0mL of lysis buffer.\nResuspend the pellet in 20\u00a0mL of lysis buffer using a serological pipette.\nLyse the cells with a 130-watt probe sonicator (see Table of Materials, probe tip diameter: 6\u00a0mm) on ice with the following parameters: 11 x 20 s pulse on; 20 s pulse off, 70% amplitude (see step 2.16 for procedure details).\nImmediately after sonication, remove the cell debris by centrifugation for 20\u00a0min at 21130 x g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Keep the lysate on ice.\nLoad the supernatant to the columns and let it pass through.\nWash the column with the following mixtures of lysis and elution buffers.\n\t\nWash 0: use 30\u00a0mL of lysis buffer.\nWash 1: use 30\u00a0mL of 5\u00a0mM imidazole (29\u00a0mL of lysis buffer, 1\u00a0mL of elution buffer).\nWash 2: use 60\u00a0mL of 25\u00a0mM imidazole (50\u00a0mL of lysis buffer, 10\u00a0mL of elution buffer).\nWash 3: use 30\u00a0mL of 40\u00a0mM imidazole (22\u00a0mL of lysis buffer, 8\u00a0mL of elution buffer).Wash 4: use 30\u00a0mL of 60\u00a0mM imidazole (18\u00a0mL of lysis buffer, 12\u00a0mL of elution buffer).\nElute the ribosomes with 7.5\u00a0mL of the elution buffer. Keep the eluted proteins on ice at all times.\nAdd 22\u00a0\u00b5L of pure \u03b2-mercaptoethanol to 45\u00a0mL of ribosome buffer.\n\tCAUTION: \u03b2-mercaptoethanol is toxic. Take safety precautions and work in a fume hood.\nAdd the eluate to a 15\u00a0mL centrifugal filter and concentrate to 1 mL.\nAdd 15\u00a0mL of ribosome buffer to the concentrated sample and concentrate again to 1 mL.\n\tNOTE:\u00a0Repeat the previous step twice.\nStore at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further use.\n\t\u200bNOTE: One round of exchange/concentration takes about 60\u00a0min of centrifugation at 3220 x g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nDuring the buffer exchange, restore the column as specified in section 1.4.\nDay 5:\nDetermine the ribosome concentration by measuring the absorbance at 260\u00a0nM of a sample diluted 1:100 in ribosome buffer. An absorbance value of 10 of the diluted solution corresponds to 23 \u00b5M of undiluted solution as previously described16.\nImplement a final stock concentration of 3.45 \u00b5M. To adjust the concentration, dilute the ribosomes with ribosome buffer or concentrate them further by centrifugation at 14000 x g in a 3 kDa 0.5\u00a0mL centrifugal filter at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\tNOTE: To achieve optimal system expression, perform a ribosome concentration titration (section 5.2, Supplementary Table 7).\nVerify the ribosome composition using SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A) as specified in section 1.3.3. Dilute 2.5\u00a0\u00b5L of the sample with 7.5\u00a0\u00b5L of water, mix with 10\u00a0\u00b5L of 2x Laemmli buffer, and then load 5\u00a0\u00b5L and 2.5\u00a0\u00b5L of the samples onto the gel.\nTag-free ribosome purificationNOTE: Tag-free ribosome purification is performed using a FPLC system (Table of Materials) and is based on hydrophobic interaction chromatography using 2 x 5\u00a0mL Butyl columns (Table of Materials). Although ribosomes may be purified from any strain, using the E. coli A19 (E. coli Genetic Resources at Yale CGSC) strain is advantageous due to its RNase I deletion22. Perform the purification at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in either a cold room or a cooling cabinet. The usual yield is around 0.5\u00a0mL of 10\u00a0\u00b5M ribosomes, which corresponds to more than five hundred 10\u00a0\u00b5L PURE reactions.\nDay 1:\nPrepare bacterial culture media and media supplements as described in Supplementary Table 1.\nPrepare and sterilize the required materials, including pipette tips, 5 L Erlenmeyer flask, and 100\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nPrepare buffers and supplements as described in Supplementary Table 2. Filter sterilize all the buffers using bottle top filters (0.45\u00a0\u00b5m) and store them at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nDay 2:\nTo prepare an overnight culture of the E. coli A19 strain, inoculate 35\u00a0mL of LB media in a 100\u00a0mL Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C while shaking at 260\u00a0rpm.\nDay 3:\nTransfer 2 L of LB media into the 5 L sterile baffled flask, inoculate with 30\u00a0mL of the overnight culture, and then incubate for 3-4\u00a0 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C while shaking at 200\u00a0rpm.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 4000 x g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Resuspend the pellet in 25\u00a0mL of suspension buffer and store at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further use.\nDay 4:\nPerform steps 3.2.8-3.2.12 in parallel with steps 3.2.13-3.2.19.Thaw and lyse the cells using a 130-watt probe sonicator (see Table of Materials and probe tip diameter: 6\u00a0mm) on ice with the following parameters: 12 x 20 s pulse on; 20 s pulse off, 70% amplitude (see step 2.16 procedure details).\nImmediately remove the cell debris by centrifugation at 20000 x g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatant and measure the volume. Add an equal volume of suspension buffer (high salt) to adjust the final concentration of ammonium sulfate to 1.5 M and mix well.\nRemove the precipitate by centrifugation at 20000 x g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\nFilter the supernatant using a 0.45\u00a0\u00b5m polyethersulfone membrane syringe filter before FPLC purification and collect the filtrate in a 100\u00a0mL glass bottle. Keep the supernatant at 4\u00a0\u00b0C at all times.\nSet up the FPLC system for hydrophobic-interaction chromatography purification using a double Butyl column (2 x 5 mL) as follows. For this setup, one column volume (CV) refers to a volume of 10 mL.\nThree inlets will be needed: two as buffer lines and one as the sample line. Due to the default settings of the purifier, it is convenient to choose lines A1 and B1 for buffer C and buffer D, respectively, and line A2 as the sample line. Apply a default flow rate of 4 mL/min, except for pump washes (10 mL/min) or unless indicated otherwise.\n\tNOTE: As TCEP is a costly reagent, add the corresponding amount to buffers C and D only after the equilibration step.\nPerform a system pump wash in 20%\u00a0((v/v)) ethanol to clean the system and remove potential contamination from previous purifications. Manually set a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min and mount the column. Stop the flow.Execute a system pump wash with water. Wash the column with 3\u00a0CV of water.\nEquilibration: place inlets A1 and A2 in buffer C and inlet B1 in buffer D without TCEP. Execute a pump wash and equilibrate the column with 4\u00a0CV of buffer C.\nAdd TCEP to buffers C and D.\nPrepare 15\u00a0mL tubes or clear round fraction collector tubes to the fraction collector to collect 4-5\u00a0mL elution fractions.\nLoading: Place the inlet A2 into the bottle with the filtered sample. Load approximately 90% of the sample volume onto the column. Dilute the sample with 20\u00a0mL of TCEP-containing buffer C, and load 10\u00a0mL of the sample onto the column. Repeat the dilution step at least twice and load as much sample onto the column as possible. It is critical to ensure that no air is sucked into the machine.\nWashing step 1: wash with 3\u00a0CV of buffer C to remove the unbound components.\nWashing step 2: wash with 5\u00a0CV of 80% buffer C and 20% buffer D.\nElution: elute the product by applying 50% of buffer C and 50% of buffer D, with a total elution volume of 5\u00a0CV. Collect this fraction in the collector tubes.\nWashing step 3: Elute all strongly interacting contaminants using 100% buffer D with a total volume of 5\u00a0CV.Analyze the absorption spectrum of the sample fraction at 260 or 280\u00a0nM (Figure 4). The first peak shows the non-absorbed proteins eluted during loading and the first washing step; the second peak shows contaminants that have been eluted during the second washing step. The third peak monitors the final product, and the last peak shows the strongly interacting contaminants. Pool all sample fractions corresponding to the third peak for further processing. Keep the eluted proteins on ice at all times.\nGently overlay the recovered fraction onto 15\u00a0mL of the cushion buffer in four polycarbonate ultracentrifugation tubes. Add a maximum of 15\u00a0mL of the sample to 15\u00a0mL of the cushion buffer. Make sure to balance the weight of the tube well. Pellet the ribosomes by ultracentrifugation at 100000 x g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 16 h.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that no cracks are present in the ultracentrifugation tubes.\nClean and reset the column as follows. A flow rate of 5 mL/min works well. Place all the inlets into the water and execute a pump wash. Wash the column with 2\u00a0CV of water.\n\t\nPlace the inlet into a 0.5 M NaOH solution, perform a pump wash, and subsequently wash the column with 3\u00a0CV of NaOH.\nPlace the inlet into water, perform a pump wash, and then wash the column in 2\u00a0CV of water.\nPlace the inlet to a 0.1 M acetic acid solution, perform a pump wash, and subsequently wash the column with 3\u00a0CV of acetic acid solution.\nPump wash and wash the column with 2\u00a0CV of water.\nPlace all inlets into 20%\u00a0((v/v)) ethanol, execute a pump wash step, and store the column in 20%\u00a0((v/v)) ethanol by washing it with 3\u00a0CV of a 20%\u00a0((v/v)) ethanol solution.NOTE: Ensure that the system never runs dry or sucks in air. Never apply buffer directly to ethanol, or ethanol to buffer. Always add a water washing step in between, as otherwise there is a risk of precipitates clogging the column. Make sure to add enough sample collection tubes.\nDay 5:\nDiscard the supernatant and carefully, without disturbing the translucent pellet, wash each pellet with 0.5\u00a0mL of ice-cold ribosome buffer. Repeat this step twice.\nResuspend each of the clear pellets in 100\u00a0\u00b5L of ribosome buffer on ice using a magnetic stir bar (3\u00a0mM diameter, 10\u00a0mM length) on a magnetic stirrer using the lowest possible speed. Collect the resuspended ribosomes and wash the tubes with an additional 50\u00a0\u00b5L of ribosome buffer.\n\tNOTE: The translucent pellet is difficult to see. Therefore, carefully wash the pellet from the sides of the tube.\nDetermine the ribosome concentration by measuring the absorbance at 260\u00a0nM of the sample diluted at a ratio of 1:100 in ribosome buffer. An absorbance of 10 of the diluted solution corresponds to 23 \u00b5M of undiluted solution as previously described16.\nImplement a final stock concentration of 10\u00a0\u00b5M. To adjust the concentration, dilute the ribosomes with ribosome buffer or concentrate them further by centrifugation at 14000 x g in a 3 kDa centrifugal filter at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\tNOTE: To achieve optimal system expression, perform ribosome titration (section 5.2, Supplementary Table 7).\nVerify the ribosome composition with SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A) as specified in section 1.3.3. Dilute 2.5\u00a0\u00b5L of the sample with 7.5\u00a0\u00b5L of water, mix with 10\u00a0\u00b5L of 2x Laemmli buffer, and then load 5\u00a0\u00b5L and 2.5\u00a0\u00b5L of the samples to the gel.\n4. Energy solutionNOTE: The composition for the 2.5x energy solution introduced here is an example of a solution that worked well for a standard TX-TL reaction. To optimize the timing, prepare the energy solution during day 2. The preparation of the amino acid solution is explained in detail, followed by the final preparation procedure.\nAmino acid solution\n\tNOTE: Prepare the amino acid solution in bulk. Preparing the amount of amino acid stock solutions required for a final volume of at least 2000\u00a0\u00b5L will reduce the weighing error for the otherwise very small amounts. The overall concentration of the amino acid solution is limited by the solubility of the amino acids and the respective stock solution concentrations. For the standard PURE system, prepare a solution with a final concentration of 3.25 mM. Use the amino acid solution calculation table (Supplementary Table 3) as a template. Use cysteine in the salt form to ensure sufficient solubility. Avoid using KOH-based amino acid preparation methods. It is possible to directly weigh the exact amounts of amino acids into the final amino acid solution without preparing stock solution for all the amino acids. However, this is more challenging and less precise.\n\t\nPrepare stock solutions for each amino acid as described in Supplementary Table 3, except for Tyrosine.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the different solubilities of the amino acids in water, the respective suggested concentrations of the stock solution differ.\nMinimal mass [mg] provides the approximate minimum mass required to obtain a sufficient amount of stock solution for the target overall volume, as a reference.\n\t\tNOTE: The minimal mass is calculated with a surplus of 10%.For an easier preparation of the solutions, do not weigh the exact amount of amino acid, but instead, for the mass at hand, adjust the amount of water to achieve the desired concentration. Calculate the amount of deionized water (Water to add [\u00b5L]) needed, based on the actual mass filled in (light yellow cells) and the desired concentration using the spreadsheet in Supplementary Table 3.\nSolubilize the amino acid stock solutions by vortexing until all precipitate has dissolved. The individual amino acid stock solutions can be stored at -20\u00a0\u00b0C for several weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: Some amino acids are difficult to dissolve in water; the process may take some time.\nWeigh the exact amount of tyrosine required to obtain a final concentration of 3.25\u00a0mM directly into the tube for the amino acid solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Tyrosine is very difficult to dissolve in water. Add it directly instead of preparing a stock solution.\nAdd the corresponding amounts of amino acid stock solutions and water as indicated in the Final volume to add [\u00b5L] column (light blue cells) and vortex the solution well. Store the completed amino acid solution at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further use.\nPreparation of the energy solution\n\tNOTE: In total, the 2.5x energy solution contains 0.75\u00a0mM of each amino acid, 29.5\u00a0mM of magnesium acetate, 250\u00a0mM of potassium glutamate, 5\u00a0mM of ATP and GTP each, 2.5\u00a0mM of CTP, UTP, and TCEP, respectively, 8.75 mg/mL of tRNA from E. coli MRE 600, 50\u00a0mM of creatine phosphate, 0.05\u00a0mM of folinic acid, 5\u00a0mM of spermidine, and 125\u00a0mM of HEPES. First-time users prepare the energy solution in small batches of 200\u00a0\u00b5L. Store the individual solutions prepared according to Supplementary Table 4 at -20\u00a0\u00b0C or -80\u00a0\u00b0C for later use.Thaw all aqueous solutions mentioned in the Supplementary Table 5 on ice.\nMeanwhile, prepare the stock solutions for the remaining components listed in Supplementary Table 4. Keep all the solutions on ice after preparation.\n\t\tNOTE: Add 500\u00a0\u00b5L of RNase and DNase-free water directly to the vial to dissolve the lyophilized tRNAs. Mix well by gentle vortexing; limit pipetting to avoid introducing RNases.\nAdd the calculated volumes (Supplementary Table 5) of stock solutions and water and mix well using a vortex. Keep the solution on ice at all times.\nMeasure the pH of the solution by pipetting 1\u00a0\u00b5L onto a pH strip, to ensure that the pH of the solution is neutral.\nAliquot the energy solution at 50-100\u00a0\u00b5L per tube on ice and store at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further use. While aliquoting, vortex the main stock frequently to prevent the components from precipitating.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: Optionally, conduct an activity assay of the newly made energy solution against commercial energy solutions, e.g.\u00a0Solution A in PURExpress. If a significantly lower performance of the system with the energy solution is observed, optimizing the ion concentrations, especially magnesium ions, by titration (5-20 mM) may be advantageous.\n5. OnePot PURE reaction\nDNA template\n\tNOTE: Proteins encoded downstream of the T7 promoter can be expressed in PURE from either linear or circular DNA. By generating a linear DNA template using extension PCR, tedious cloning steps can be omitted. The linear templates for this study were generated by PCR as described below, using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Table of Materials). Primer sequences, melting temperatures, and the thermocycler settings used in this study are specified in Supplementary Table 6. The preparation of the DNA template is not included in the daily schedule.\n\t\nSet up a PCR reaction as recommended by the polymerase supplier.NOTE: Optimized parameters for a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Table of Materials) are given in Supplementary Table 6.\nAmplify the target gene (e.g., eGFP) as a linear template from a plasmid or genome using gene-specific primers (500\u00a0nM) (for the parameters, see Supplementary Table 6).\nThe amplification generates short extensions to provide annealing sequences for the following extension PCR steps.\nCheck the amplicon on an agarose gel for correct size and purity.\nUse the amplified DNA as a template for the subsequent extension steps. Set up a reaction of at least 50\u00a0\u00b5L.\nRun 10 PCR amplification cycles with the extension primers (2.5 nM). After completing the amplification cycles, immediately add the final primers (500\u00a0nM) to the same reaction and run 30 cycles to amplify the extended PCR product. Find the melting temperatures and primer sequences in Supplementary Table 6.\nPurify the DNA fragments using a DNA purification kit and elute the DNA in nuclease-free water instead of EDTA containing elution buffer.\nCheck the linear template on an agarose gel for correct size and purity.\nMeasure the DNA concentration in ng/\u00b5L using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nSetting up the PURE reactionNOTE: The final reaction composition is 1x energy solution, tag-free ribosomes or His-tag ribosomes, OnePot PURE proteins, and DNA template. The reaction volume ratio comprises 40% energy solution, 30% protein and ribosome solution, and 30% DNA and water. Typical reaction volumes vary between 5\u00a0\u00b5L and 25\u00a0\u00b5L. Quantify the expression of a fluorescent protein continuously on a plate-reader. Use a Green Lys in vitro Translation Labeling System, which incorporates fluorescently labeled Lysine residue into newly synthesized proteins, to verify the expression of non-fluorescent proteins on a SDS-PAGE gel. An example reaction template is given in Supplementary Table 7 to help establish a PURE cell-free expression reaction. Cells in yellow indicate user-input values, and cells in orange indicate additional reagents to be optionally added to the reaction. Keep the volume ratios of the components precise to ensure the correct ion balance. For instance, to achieve a higher protein concentration, increase the OnePot protein solution concentration; however, do not increase the volume of protein solution added to the reaction.\n\t\nFill in the concentration [ng/\u00b5L] and length [base pairs] of the DNA in the corresponding yellow cells in the spreadsheet. Use 2-10\u00a0nM of DNA for the reaction.\nFill in the desired total reaction volume in\u00a0\u00b5L.\nRemove the required reagents from the freezer and thaw them on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Refreezing of the components is possible without a decrease in functionality. However, minimize the number of freeze-thaw cycles and the time samples are stored on ice as much as possible.Pipette the calculated amounts of water, DNA, and energy solution to one side of the PCR tube or one corner of a well on the 384-well plate. Add the required amount of any additional reagent on the same side. Minimize the number of samples per experiment to avoid sample evaporation and experimental start time bias.\n\t\tNOTE: It is crucial to keep the energy component physically separated from the protein components to avoid premature consumption of the energy sources and lower yields.\nPipette the calculated amounts of protein and ribosome solution to the other side of a PCR tube or the opposite corner of the 384-well plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Use master mixes whenever possible to reduce the impact of pipetting errors. After initial testing, the ribosome and protein solutions can be mixed and stored as one solution.\nSpin for a short time (30 s) to merge the reaction components. To prevent evaporation during plate-reader experiments, add 35\u00a0\u00b5L of liquid wax and seal the plate with a transparent sealant (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate for a minimum of 3\u00a0 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C.\nFor readout on a plate-reader, measure the fluorescence intensity at the required wavelength every 2\u00a0min (representative results are shown in Figure 3B).\nPerform the following steps for Green Lys labeled samples.\nAfter the cell-free expression, incubate the sample with 0.16 \u00b5g/\u00b5L of RNase A for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C to remove the fluorescent background of the Green Lys labeling kit.\n\t\tNOTE: Use RNase A, as other types of RNases do not remove the background sufficiently well.\nVisualize the protein expression by running SDS-PAGE as specified in section 1.3.3. Wash the unstained gel gently in deionized water, and image it on a fluorescent imager using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm.Subsequently, stain the gel using conventional Coomassie staining methods. For the suitable parameters see section 1.3.3.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform a titration of the protein solution with the recommended ribosome concentration and, if required, titrate ribosomes with the optimal OnePot protein concentration afterward. Use the commercial PURExpress \u0394Ribosome kit as a positive control. Solution A, Factor Mix, and the ribosome solution correspond to the prepared energy, the OnePot protein solution, and the purified ribosomes, respectively.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSynthesis of citrate-capped Au nanoparticle seeds\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nThis preparation describes the synthesis of Au seed using the Turkevich method (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] \u201cSynthesis of Au Seeds\u201d).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nPreparation of 10\u00a0mM HAuCl4 and 100\u00a0mM trisodium citrate precursor solutions:\nCarefully weigh 39.4\u00a0mg of HAuCl4 trihydrate on an analytical balance into a 20\u00a0mL glass scintillation vial.

Choosing the appropriate stream\nFollow the decision tree outlined in Figure 1 to determine the best workflow (stream) (Figure 2) for the experimental setup used. Refer to the discussion for further comments on this choice of stream.\nIf following the Cytometer Stream, continue with steps 2.1.1-2.2.7. If following the Bulk Stream, continue with steps 3.1.1.1-3.1.5.7.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Workstream decision tree. The decision as to which Stream to use depends primarily on the carrier type of interest. Larger carriers and carriers with high scattering properties can more easily be detected individually on cytometers, thus making them suitable for quantification using the Cytometer Stream. The Bulk Stream is suitable for all other carrier types. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259fig01large.jpg]\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Overview of workstreams. This protocol is split into two different Streams. The Cytometer Stream uses a sensitive cytometer to count the carriers in suspension, measure their individual fluorescence, and then determine the fluorescence of cells incubated with carriers. The Bulk Stream uses non-cytometry-based techniques, such as Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, to count the carriers in suspension. The individual carrier fluorescence is then quantified using a microplate reader or spectrofluorometer. The use of the flow cytometer is, therefore, restricted to measuring the final fluorescence of cells incubated with carriers, a measurement that can be done on a wider range of cytometers and that is independent of the carrier type used. Abbreviations: MESF = Molecules of Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome; MFI = median fluorescence intensity. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259fig02large.jpg]\n2. The Cytometer Stream\nCarrier countingNOTE: Any flow cytometer can be used for this measurement, provided the flow rate (\u00b5L/s) is known. If the flow rate is unknown and cannot be determined, do not proceed with this step. Instead, proceed with step 3.1. Counting the carriers in suspension allows accurate and reproducible determination of the number of carriers incubated in each cell experiment.\n\t\nSet up the cytometer to detect carriers, both by an optical scattering channel (typically side scatter [SSC]) and fluorescence. Make sure to adjust the threshold to allow detection of the carriers.\n\t\tNOTE: Iteration through different optical scattering channels may be required if SSC does not provide a clear signal (e.g., forward scatter [FSC]).\nRun a diluent-only sample to quantify the background event count in both the SSC and fluorescent channels.\n\t\tNOTE: Ideal background event counts are <100 events/s.\nPrepare the carriers for flow cytometry.\n\t\t\nEnsure the carriers are well suspended by vortexing or sonication, depending on the carrier system involved.\nIf possible, ensure the carrier concentration is between 1,000 carriers/\u00b5L and 10,000 carriers/\u00b5L. An event count of one to two orders of magnitude higher than the background is a good start. If the order of magnitude of the carrier concentration is unknown, a good start is to prepare a 1:1,000 dilution from stock. Use the initial results as feedback to inform future sample dilutions.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A cloudy suspension is generally too concentrated.\nLoad the first carrier sample onto the cytometer and start recording.\nCompare event counts resulting from both the SSC and fluorescence channels; these should be approximately equal (<10% difference). If not, check the cytometer settings, e.g., photomultiplier tube (PMT) settings and laser intensity for the fluorescent channel. Alternatively, use other methods such as confocal microscopy to validate that the fluorescent labeling of the carriers is present and uniform.Repeat steps 2.1.3-2.1.5 two or more additional times with different dilutions from the stock. Ensure that the event count in each sample is at least one order of magnitude higher than the background event count.\nVerify that three or more samples show a linear trend, that is, a two-fold sample dilution should result in a corresponding two-fold reduction in the measured carrier concentration.\nUse the samples within the linear range, corresponding dilution factors, and the known cytometer flow rate to calculate the stock carrier concentration according to equation (1):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259eq01.jpg\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(1)\n\t\twhere C is the stock carrier concentration in carriers/mL. It is recommended to use the event count derived from optical scattering detection rather than fluorescence.\nFlow cytometry readout of the carrier-cell experiment, including determination of fluorescence intensity per carrier\n\tNOTE: Ideally, the fluorescent intensity per carrier will be determined as close as possible to the carrier-cell experiment. This is to ensure that the MFIs obtained for individual carriers can directly be compared to the MFIs of cells associated with the carriers. In practice, a cytometer will usually generate similar results when used on consecutive days using the same PMT voltages, but this cannot be guaranteed.\n\t\nDesign the carrier-cell experiment. Use the carrier concentration determined in step 2.1 to administer the desired dose of carriers.\nSet up the flow cytometer for the final carrier-cell experiment by determining optimal PMT voltage settings in the relevant channels. Set the thresholds to allow carrier detection.\nRun the carriers in suspension to determine the fluorescence intensity per carrier under the current PMT settings.\nIf needed, change the cytometer thresholds to detect the cells and not the carriers.\nRun a negative control sample-cells not incubated with carriers-to determine the background fluorescence (autofluorescence) of the cells.Run the carrier-cell samples to determine the fluorescence intensity per cell. This fluorescence is a linear combination of cellular autofluorescence and the presence of fluorescent carriers.\nCalculate the number of carriers per cell using the following equation (2):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259eq02.jpg\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(2)\n\t\twhere Passoc is the number of carriers associated per cell, FIcell is the MFI of cells incubated with carriers, FIbackground is the MFI of cells not incubated with carriers, and FIcarrier is the MFI of carriers in suspension.\n3. The Bulk Stream\nCarrier counting: nanoparticle tracking analysis\n\tNOTE: In the Bulk Stream, carrier counting is a necessary step to quantify the absolute fluorescence intensity per carrier (see step 3.1.4). In addition, counting the carriers in suspension allows the accurate and reproducible determination of the number of carriers incubated in each cell experiment.\n\t\nPreparation\n\t\t\nMount the flow cell onto the laser module and lock the entire laser module in place inside the instrument.\nSlowly (not faster than 0.1 mL/s) flush the flow cell with ~1 mL of distilled water. If bubbles form within the flow cell, retract the suspension partially to merge the bubble with the air-liquid interface before proceeding.\nStart the camera roughly halfway through flushing; be sure to confirm that carrier debris is washed out. Select Capture to open the Capture Settings tab and click Start Camera.\nDry the system with 1 mL of air. If any static carriers are visible on the screen, clean the flow cell according to the manufacturer's instructions.Prepare the carriers for Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis by ensuring the carriers are well suspended via vortexing or sonication, depending on the carrier system involved. If the order of magnitude of the stock concentration is unknown, prepare a 1:100 dilution from the stock and use the initial results as feedback to inform future sample dilutions. Dilute the carriers in water and not phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to prepare at least ~0.6-1 mL of each sample with a carrier concentration between 1 \u00d7 107 carriers/mL and 1 \u00d7 109 carriers/mL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A cloudy suspension is generally too concentrated. Buffers and salts can generate high background noise.\nMeasurement\n\t\t\nTake out the laser module and place it upright.\nDraw up the first carrier sample into a 1 mL syringe. Attach the syringe to the tube inlet and carefully load the sample into the flow cell. If bubbles form within the flow cell, retract the suspension partially to merge the bubble with the air-liquid interface before proceeding. Ensure the entire flow cell is filled with liquid, then pause.\nAdjust the camera focus if needed to visualize individual carriers. Make coarse focus adjustments with the rotating knob on the right-hand side of the instrument. Make finer adjustments by selecting the Hardware tab | Pumps/Stage. Change the focus by adjusting the Focus slider.\nAdjust the camera level to make sure there is no oversaturation. Within the Capture tab, select the optimal Camera Level by adjusting the slider.\nIf the instrument is equipped with this accessory, load the syringe containing the carrier sample into the Syringe Pump to ensure continuous sample flow during measurements.Under the SOP tab, select Standard Measurement to take five captures of 30 s each. Enter Base filename and, if desired, add additional sample information by clicking the Advanced button (which opens a modal dialogue with a variety of choices).\n\t\t\tNOTE: If a dilution factor is entered, the final carrier concentration measurement will be adjusted automatically by the software. Entering this factor is advised against. Instead, perform the adjustment manually, which facilitates the analysis and allows the assessment of whether each dilution falls within the dynamic range of the instrument (step 3.1.3.4).\nPress Create and Run Script and wait for a pop-up to appear asking to Please advance sample.\nIf using the Syringe Pump, select the Hardware tab | Syringe Pump tab | set the Infusion Rate at 30-80 and press Infuse. If not using the Syringe Pump, manually advance the sample.\nIn the pop-up window, select OK to start capturing. After each of the five captures, when the Please advance sample pop-up reappears, check that the sample is still moving through the flow cell, either manually or via the Syringe Pump. Then, select OK to proceed with the next capture.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After five captures, the software automatically opens the Process tab and opens a pop-up asking to adjust the process settings.\nAnalysis\n\t\t\nIn the Process tab, adjust the Detection Threshold slider (between 4 and 8) to correctly identify distinct carriers visible on the screen. Adjust the Screen Gain too to aid visualization; it will not affect the downstream analysis. Use the slider under the capture screen to scroll through multiple frames of the video to aid detection threshold setting.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The detection threshold should be set once and, subsequently, should not be altered between measurements or samples.In the pop-up (note after step 3.1.2.9), press OK to initiate tracking analysis. Monitor the progress of the analysis by clicking on the Analysis tab | Single Analysis tab.\nOnce the analysis is finished, look for an Export Settings prompt to appear, in which Include PDF and Include Experiment Summary should be selected by default. Select any other export formats as desired.\nIn the Results section of the PDF data export, to ensure the concentration measured is reliable, verify that the measured carrier concentration is between 1 \u00d7 107 carriers/mL and 1 \u00d7 109 carriers/mL-the dynamic range of the instrument-and check for any error messages or messages of caution underneath the concentration measurement result.\nRepeat steps 3.1.2.1-3.1.3.4 two or more times with different dilutions from the stock. Ensure that the concentration of each sample falls within the linear range of the instrument.\nSelect three or more samples that show a linear trend, that is, a two-fold sample dilution should result in a corresponding two-fold reduction in the measured carrier concentration. Use the selected samples and corresponding dilution factors to calculate the stock carrier concentration.\nDetermination of the absolute fluorescence intensity per carrier\n\t\tNOTE: Since the fluorescence of individual carriers in this stream cannot be characterized directly, the fluorescence intensity is quantified in bulk. This method relies on the fact that fluorescence intensity is linearly related to the fluorochrome concentration according to the Lambert-Beer law. When such bulk quantification of carriers in suspension is done on a suspension of known carrier concentration (see step 3.1), the fluorescence per carrier can be derived. This step can be done on either a fluorescence plate reader or a spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence intensity is compared to a standard curve of samples with known absolute fluorescence, given in number of MESFs.Use a solution of the free fluorochrome to label the carrier: resuspend the dye in the appropriate buffer (e.g., DMSO) and perform further dilutions in the same buffer as the carrier diluent. Alternatively, use a solution of an antibody conjugated to the fluorochrome. Calculate the concentration of the stock solution (MESF/mL) from the concentration in mg/mL, the molecular weight in mg/mole, and Avogadro's number using equation (3). Perform a serial dilution in the carrier diluent to generate standard curve samples.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259eq03.jpg\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(3)\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use a fluorochrome-conjugated antibody only if the degree of labeling, i.e., the molar ratio between the fluorochrome and antibody in the solution, is known. Initially, generate a standard curve with a wide range, as the fluorescence intensity of the carrier sample is still unknown. From here, narrow it down to include the range required.\nPrepare the carrier samples.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The best practice is to test two or more carrier dilutions to validate that the measurements are linear and fall within the range of the standard curve.\nMeasure the fluorescence of equal volumes of each sample, i.e., both carrier and standard curves.\nGenerate a standard curve and deduct the bulk absolute fluorescence intensity in MESF/mL for the carrier samples measured.\nCalculate the absolute fluorescence intensity per carrier (MESF/carrier) by dividing the bulk fluorescence (MESF/mL) by the carrier concentration (carriers/mL) as in equation (4):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259eq04.jpg\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(4)\nCell experiment (including the determination of the equivalent fluorescence intensity per carrier)NOTE: In this step, flow cytometry quantitation beads are used to generate a standard curve of the relationship between MESF and MFI. These quantitation beads consist of multiple bead populations with a known number of MESF per bead, and these individual beads can be detected by any cytometer. Ideally, the MESF standard curve is determined at the same time as the readout of the carrier-cell experiments. This is to ensure that the MFI values calculated for individual carriers can directly be compared to the MFI of cells associated with carriers. In practice, a cytometer will usually generate similar results when used on consecutive days using the same PMT voltages, but this cannot be guaranteed.\n\t\t\nDesign the carrier-cell experiment. Use the carrier concentration determined in section 3.1.3 to administer the desired dose of carriers.\nSet up the flow cytometer for the final carrier-cell experiment by determining optimal PMT voltage settings in the relevant channels.\nRun a negative control sample, that is, cells not incubated with carriers, to determine the background fluorescence.\nPrepare and resuspend the flow cytometry quantitation beads. Use the same buffer as used for the cell samples (e.g., PBS). If the bead populations are provided separately, pool them together.\nRun the flow cytometry quantitation bead sample.\nRun the carrier-cell samples to determine the fluorescence intensity per cell.\nUse the quantitation bead sample to generate a standard curve converting the absolute fluorescence intensity (MESF) into MFI. Use this standard curve and the results from step 3.1.4 to calculate the theoretical MFI of the carriers. Calculate the number of carriers per cell using equation (5):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64259/64259eq05.jpg\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(5)Where Passoc is the number of carriers associated per cell, FIcell is the MFI of cells incubated with carriers, FIbackground is the MFI of cells not incubated with carriers, and FIcarrier\u00a0is the calculated MFI of carriers in suspension (step 3.1.4).\nSubscription Required.

The following protocol is an adaptation of our previously developed CTOS method, in which cell\u2013cell contacts are maintained throughout organoid preparation, culture, and passage.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2783-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Preparation of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids from primary tumor tissue\n(A) Schematic overview of the cancer tissue-originated spheroid method.\n(B) Images of tumor fragments dissected into small pieces.\n(C) Image of the mesh filters (hole size 500, 250, and 40\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively) and the 50\u00a0mL conical tubes.\n(D\u2013F) Representative phase-contrast images of colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor organoids growing in suspension. (D) Image of the tumor fragments immediately after preparation. (E) Image of CRC organoids one day after preparation. (F) Image of CRC organoids immediately after disruption. Scale bar\u00a0= 100\u00a0\u03bcm.\nNote: Fresh primary CRC tissues obtained from the surgical samples or xenograft tumor were preserved on ice in a 50\u00a0mL conical tube (or equivalent) containing 15\u00a0mL of fresh DMEM/Ham\u2019s F12 medium or a physiological saline solution (such as HBSS buffer), supplemented with 100\u00a0U/mL of penicillin-streptomycin (150\u00a0\u03bcL).\nCollect a fresh surgical CRC sample as described above and immediately proceed to tissue dissociation in a biological safety cabinet.\nTransfer the CRC sample to a 90\u00a0mm petri dish and, utilizing tweezers to immobilize the tumor fragment; apply a scalpel to cut the tumor fragment into pieces less than 2\u00a0mm in size (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCritical: Tumor samples were cut into smaller pieces to prevent excessive tissue damage.Wash the minced tumor fragments with 20\u00a0mL of HBSS buffer, gently mix up and down a couple of times, and transfer to a new 50\u00a0mL conical tube.\nAfter waiting approximately 1\u00a0min for the tumor fragments to sink to the bottom, discard the supernatant (composed mainly of blood cells, single cells, and debris).\nResuspend the tumor fragments with 10\u00a0mL of the tumor dissociation solution.\nNote: To successfully maintain the cell\u2013cell contact, we used Liberase\u2122 DH as a blend of digestion enzymes.\nTransfer the minced tumor fragment suspension to a 100\u00a0mL sterile conical flask with a magnet bar.\nTo digest the tumor tissue, incubate the sample for \u223c15\u201330\u00a0min in a 37\u00b0C water bath with constant stirring (700\u00a0rpm); adding 10\u00a0\u03bcL of DNase I for the last 15\u00a0min of incubation.\nCritical: Digestion time depends on the CRC sample. In some cases, it can be up to 60\u00a0min. Excessive digestion decreases the yield of the organoid preparations. The decision to stop the digestion step is based on visual inspection by the researchers and their judgement regarding the size of the tumor clusters by checking under a microscope and observing the conical flask containing the tumor fragment suspension. Therefore, researchers should carefully monitor the progression of digestion. In the CTOS method, avoiding complete tissue dissociation into single cells is essential because over-digestion can cause significant cell damage.\nSerially strain the suspension of digested tumor fragments using mesh filters and 50\u00a0mL conical tubes (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPass the digested tumor suspension through a sterile stainless-steel wire mesh (hole size: 500\u00a0\u03bcm), and transfer the flow-through into the next mesh filter.\nWash the tumor fragments trapped in the mesh with 5\u00a0mL of HBSS buffer.\nRepeat these steps for each filtration step.Note: The following mesh filters can be applied in the following order. Stainless-steel wire mesh (hole size: 250\u00a0\u03bcm); 100-\u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon\u00ae Cell Strainers); 40-\u03bcm cell strainer (Falcon\u00ae Cell Strainers).\nCritical: When the number of tumor fragments is low, fewer filters should be used; for example, the 500- and 40-\u03bcm filters can be used to reduce material loss during the passage procedure.\nIndividually recover the tumor fragments, with a P1000 Pipette, in the fraction of 250\u2013500, 100\u2013250, and 40\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm with 1\u20132\u00a0mL of the CTOS organoid medium:\nTransfer the mesh filter containing the tumor fragments to a non-treated 60\u00a0mm Petri dish.\nAdd 1\u20132\u00a0mL of the CTOS organoid medium to the filter.\nUsing a P1000 Pipette, scratch and collect the tumor fragments, and proceed to step 10.\nPause point: The protocol can be paused at this point if the user makes freeze-stocks of the collected tumor fragments. To freeze-stock the tumor organoids, use the StemCell Keep reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (https://www.diagnocine.com/Content/Upload/Product/datasheets/VPL-A1_Diagnocine_Manual.pdf[href=https://www.diagnocine.com/Content/Upload/Product/datasheets/VPL-A1_Diagnocine_Manual.pdf]).\nNote: If the sample is frozen after step 9 of the protocol, proceed to step 10 after thawing and follow the protocol as described.\nTransfer the collected tumor fragments to a non-treated 6-well plate dish containing 2\u20133\u00a0mL of CTOS organoid medium per well (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: If only a few tumor fragments are obtained, a smaller plate such as a 12-well plate is used. Confluency is a crucial factor for organoid growth since it affects the nutrient and oxygen availability in cells. Approximately 50\u2013100 fragments are seeded in 2\u20133\u00a0mL of CTOS organoid medium. However, optimal confluency may vary for each CRC organoid. It is recommended to optimize it based on the growth rate, the size of the organoids, and/or the colour change of the medium.Incubate the culture in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nNote: After 12\u00a0h of culture, the tumor fragments became transparent and spherical with a smooth surface (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nMaintenance of the CRC organoids\nTiming: 2\u20133\u00a0weeks\nThis section describes the steps required to efficiently maintain, culture, passage, and expand CRC organoids for establishing CRC organoid lines. The following protocol is an adaptation of the methods described by Kondo et\u00a0al.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nThe day after organoid preparation, CRC organoids should be washed twice with HBSS buffer to remove cellular debris.\nCollect the CRC organoids and transfer into a 1.5\u00a0mL tube.\nUsing a P1000 Pipette, mix the suspension up and down ten times, and wait approximately 1\u20132\u00a0min for the CRC organoids to sink to the bottom. Then, discard the supernatant (mainly composed of debris and/or dead cells).\nWash the CRC organoids with 1\u00a0mL of HBSS buffer.\nRepeat steps b and c.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL of CTOS organoid medium to the CRC organoids, and transfer them to a non-treated 6-well plate dish containing 2\u20133\u00a0mL of CTOS organoid medium per well.\nIncubate the organoid culture in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C for 6\u00a0days. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nNote: Once established, CRC organoid cultures are monitored daily and passaged once a week to expand and maintain their viability. CRC organoids can be cultured in suspension. Some CRC organoid lines might require the addition of Matrigel GFR and/or growth factors (e.g 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of bFGF and/or 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of Rho-kinase inhibitor) in the CTOS organoid medium to promote their growth and/or survival rate. The organoids may be embedded in Matrigel GFR (5\u00a0\u03bcL of Matrigel GFR containing 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0102 organoids) in the CTOS organoid medium, depending on their viability and growth rate.For passaging, CRC organoids should be dissociated using the syringe disruption method once a week13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]:\nOne week after the organoid preparation or the previous disruption step, or when the diameter of the spheroids reaches 200\u2013300\u00a0\u03bcm, collect the CRC organoids and transfer into a 1.5\u00a0mL tube.\nUsing a P1000 Pipette, mix the suspension up and down ten times. After waiting approximately 1\u20132\u00a0min for the CRC organoids to sink to the bottom, discard the supernatant liquid (composed mainly of debris and/or dead cells).\nNote: If the CRC organoids do not settle at the bottom, one can subject them to centrifugation at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C.\nWash the CRC organoids with 1\u00a0mL of HBSS buffer.\nRepeat steps b and c.\nAdd 200\u00a0\u03bcL of the CTOS organoid medium to the CRC organoids.\nDisrupt the CRC organoids into smaller fragments by passing them through a 1\u00a0mL syringe with a 27\u00a0G needle at a high flow rate (\u223c0.5\u00a0mL/s) \u223c5\u201310 times. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nCritical: The number of syringe strokes required to disrupt the organoids may depend on the CRC organoid line. Excessive disruption leads to decreased organoid viability. To ensure proper disruption, bubble formation should be avoided during this step.\nResuspend the disrupted CRC organoids in a non-treated 6-well plate containing 2\u20133\u00a0mL of CTOS organoid medium per well (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: CRC organoids are spontaneously re-formed from these fragments within hours.\nIncubate the culture in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C for 1\u00a0week.Note: Although this step depends on the seeding density of the CRC organoids, it is safer to replace the medium once every 3\u20134\u00a0days as a standard. If the organoids are in suspension, the plate can be swirled clockwise to allow them to gather at the centre of the plate. Using a P1000 pipette, carefully aspirate the old medium from the edge of the plate and replace it with fresh medium. Alternatively, one can pellet the organoids using centrifugation at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C. After pelleting the organoids, carefully aspirate the old medium and resuspend them in a freshly prepared medium.\nCritical: The CRC organoids should be subjected to further experiments at least one day after passaging to avoid the influence of organoid disruption and remodelling.\nNote: Organoids prepared from freshly harvested primary CRC tumors should be cultured and expanded for 2\u20133\u00a0weeks before being subjected to SSFG assay. This step avoids contamination with stromal cells.\nWithin 2\u20133 passages, organoids should be freeze-stocked with StemCell Keep according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (https://www.diagnocine.com/Content/Upload/Product/datasheets/VPL-A1_Diagnocine_Manual.pdf[href=https://www.diagnocine.com/Content/Upload/Product/datasheets/VPL-A1_Diagnocine_Manual.pdf]).\nNote: A CRC organoid \u2018line\u2019 is defined by the following criteria: i) growing continuously in culture, ii) generating xenograft tumor (at least two passages in\u00a0vivo), and iii) being sufficiently freeze-stocked in order to reproduce the experiments.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nSingle-cell-derived spheroid-forming and growth (SSFG) assay\nTiming: 2\u20133\u00a0weeks\nIn this section, we describe a phenotypically trackable cell culture system with single-cell resolution (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The SSFG assay allows us to precisely track not only the capacity of spheroid formation but also the cell fate of growth of each spheroid-forming cell in CRC organoids with single-cell resolution. For the complete details of this protocol, please refer to Coppo et\u00a0al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2783-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02.

(2023).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCollect one hundred to a thousand CRC organoids and transfer into a 15\u00a0mL conical tube containing 10\u00a0mL of HBSS buffer.\nNote: The SSFG assay can also be performed using a small number of organoids (e.g ten CRC organoids). Four hundred cells at least are required for the assay and a CRC organoid with a diameter of 100\u00a0\u03bcm approximately consists of \u223c100 cells.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nCentrifuge the CRC organoids at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the organoid pellet with 10\u00a0mL of HBSS buffer.\nCentrifuge the CRC organoids at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C, and then discard the supernatant.\nAdd 2\u00a0mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the organoid pellet. Using a P1000 Pipette, mix the suspension up and down ten times, and incubate for \u223c5\u201310\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C in a water bath.\nCritical: The incubation time with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA required to dissociate organoids into single cells may vary among CRC organoid lines. Excessive treatment impairs cell viability.\nMix the cell suspension by gently pipetting a hundred times to promote organoid dissociation into single cells. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nCritical: The number of pipetting steps required to promote cell dissociation varies among CRC organoid lines. Thus, the number of pipetting steps can be reduced to prevent cell death.Add 6\u00a0mL of the CTOS organoid medium to inactivate trypsin.\nAdd 8\u00a0\u03bcL of DNase I (10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and incubate for 1\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C.\nDiscard the supernatant liquid and wash the cell pellet with 10\u00a0mL of HBSS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C, and then discard the supernatant.\nCritical: It is essential to carefully remove the supernatant to avoid the loss of the cell pellet, which is invisible when working with a low number of CRC organoids.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1\u00a0mL of HBSS buffer and filter into a 5\u00a0mL round bottom tube with a 35-\u03bcm cell strainer cap in order to remove cell clusters (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nKeep the cell suspension on ice and determine the cell count.\nCritical: To increase the probability of seeding cells at a ratio of one cell per well, it is essential to count the number of cells precisely. In addition, it is crucial to examine the single-cell status under a microscope. If organoid dissociation into single cells is incomplete and there are many small clusters, dissociation using steps 23\u201326 should be repeated.\nDilute \u223c300\u2013400 cells in a 20\u00a0mL cold SSFG medium. Keep the cell suspension on ice.\nNote: The amount of medium used depends on the experiment. For example, 20\u00a0mL of SSFG medium is required to seed a 384-well plate with 50\u00a0\u03bcL of medium per well. The amount of medium required may vary depending on the number of 384-well plates to be prepared, the number of cells to be seeded, or both (approximately 300\u2013400 cells per plate).\nDispense the cell suspension into a sterile reagent reservoir and gently mix.Using an E1-ClipTip electronic pipette (or equivalent), seed the cell suspension into a non-treated 384-well plate with a ratio of one cell per well (50\u00a0\u03bcL/well) (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCentrifuge the plate at 400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C.\nNote: Centrifugation of the cell plate is used to concentrate the cells at the bottom of the U-bottom wells and eliminate any bubbles to facilitate picture acquisition in step 33.\nIncubate the plate in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C and culture for 2\u20133\u00a0weeks.\nNote: The growth rate of single cells may differ between different CRC organoid lines. The culture timing should be adjusted for each line.\nWithin 2\u00a0h of cell seeding (D0), the presence of one cell per well is strictly confirmed by image acquisition using a LEICA DMI4000B microscope equipped with Lumina Vision (or equivalent).\nNote: Lumina Vision equipment allows automatic image acquisition of the entire 384-well plate. Alternatively, the YAMAHA CELL HANDLER\u2122 (https://global.yamaha-motor.com/business/hc/[href=https://global.yamaha-motor.com/business/hc/]) is an automated system that can be used to detect, select, and seed individual cells as well as for image acquisition.\nAfter 7\u00a0days of culture (D7), add 30\u00a0\u03bcL of fresh SSFG medium (without Y-27632) per well (total amount: 12\u00a0mL) using an E1-ClipTip electronic pipette (or equivalent) and a sterile reagent reservoir. Add the medium to the top of the 50\u00a0\u03bcL previously seeded (D0).\nThe growth of single cells into spheroids are monitored by image acquisition on different culture days (D0, D4, D7, and D14), as shown in Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nOptional: The spheroids are further cultured after D14 by adding the SSFG medium without Y-27632 (30\u00a0\u03bcL/well) until D20 when the growth rate of the CRC organoid line is low.Note: The spheroid-forming capacity (percentage of single cells which can grow and form spheroids) ranged from \u223c19\u201359% in different CRC organoid lines.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nIsolation and culture of slow-growing cells from CRC organoids\nTiming: 1\u20132\u00a0months\nThis section describes the application of the SSFG assay to identify, isolate, and culture slow-growing cells from CRC organoids (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The SSFG assay revealed that the CRC organoids are composed of two types of cells: S-cells, generating small spheroids, and L-cells, generating large spheroids (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). For complete details regarding the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Coppo et\u00a0al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2783-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Isolation and culture of slow-growing cells from colorectal cancer organoids\nSchematic overview of the experiments to confirm the slow-growing phenotype of the isolated small spheroid clones.\nNote: To identify small and large spheroids, the results of the SSFG assay were quantified as described in the Quantification and Statistical Analysis section. Because each spheroid was strictly derived from a single cell, it can be called a clone.\nAt the end of the SSFG assay (D14 or D20), pick-up the small spheroids and individually transfer (one clone per well) into a well of a non-coated 96-well plate containing 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the CTOS organoid medium supplemented with 2% Matrigel GFR.\nIncubate the spheroids in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C and culture for 2\u00a0weeks.\nNote: The slow-growing spheroids might be monitored daily, and the CTOS organoid medium supplemented with 2% Matrigel GFR changed after one week of culture. The medium is replaced by carefully aspirating the old medium from the top using a P200 pipette, ensuring that the spheroids are not aspirated or lost. Following aspiration, fresh medium is added to each well.When the slow-growing spheroids reach a size of 3\u20134\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 \u03bcm2, individually dissociate them by the syringe disruption method as described in the section maintenance of the CRC organoids[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], step 13.\nCulture the disrupted spheroids (one clone per well) in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of the CTOS organoid medium supplemented with 2% Matrigel GFR into a well of a non-coated 24-well plate.\nIncubate the spheroids in a 5% CO2-humidified chamber at 37\u00b0C for 1\u00a0week.\nNote: The growth rates of slow-growing spheroids may differ among CRC organoid lines. The culture timing should be adjusted for each line. The organoids should be expanded to perform the next assays and to prepare sufficient freeze stocks.\nOnce isolated the slow-growing spheroids, a subsequent round of SSFG assay should be performed to confirm the slow-growing pattern.\nOne hundred organoids from a slow-growing clone are subjected to the SSFG assay, as described in the Single-cell-derived spheroid-forming and growth assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] section.\nThe results are quantified as described in the section quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section, confirming the slow-growing phenotype.", "All institutional approvals were obtained before patient imaging.\n1. Image Acquisition and Segmentation\nAcquire a thoracic MRI scan of a neonate in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. Capture every slice of the scan in the ventricular diastolic stage of the heart cycle or obtain a thoracic MRI from an autopsy.\n\tNOTE: A visibly clear definition of the heart muscle, as well as atria and ventricles, is essential.\nUsing processing software (see Table of Materials) import the DICOM file of the thoracic MRI. Using the 'Editing Masks' menu item, select the area of the heart muscle on each MRI slice where the heart is present. The atria and ventricles, in this case, can be covered as well.\nCreate a new sketch layer and separately segment the two atria and two ventricles in the same manner as the selection for the heart muscle. Do not segment the valves present between the atria and ventricles, and between the ventricles and arteries.\nRender the muscle and chambers into separate 3D representations using the 'Calculate 3D' menu item and export them as five STereoLithography (.stl) files using the optimal resolution settings by using the 'STL+' menu item.\nLoad the.stl files into the CAD software (see Table of Materials). Use the fix wizard menu item to repair the.stl files for overlapping triangles and bad edges. Save the.stl files again.\n\tNOTE: If no heart MRI is available, consider using the heart model used in this protocol. This file also contains separate heart valve models. Please click here to download the files[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56710/Cardiac_model_parts.zip].\n2. Processing and Mold Printing\nLoad the set of atria and ventricles into a computer-aided design software (see Table of Materials).\u00a0Please click here to download the files[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56710/Cardiac_model_parts.zip].Determine the position of the aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid valves using the original MRI (Figure 1).\nAdd the positive and negative mold halves of each valve to their respective position in the loaded set of atria and ventricles by dragging the valve file (obtained through the link above) into the current file activating the 'insert part' function. Indicate the position of placement by clicking the location of the surface of the atria or ventricles.\n\t\nExtrude the base of the positive and negative valve using 'features tab > extrude boss/base' to protrude into their respective chambers and merge the valve parts to their respective chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: The mitral valve consists of two semilunar parts, while the tricuspid, aortic, and pulmonary valves consist of three.\nAdd the pulmonary and aortic valve file to their respective ventricle location using the procedure described in step 2.2. From the top of these valves, sketch two arching cylinders of 5 mm diameter by clicking the 'sketch tab > circle' following a sketched arched line using the 'features tab > sweep boss/base' until both circular cylinder surfaces reach the horizontal position. Merge the valve parts to their respective ventricles and arteries.\nFrom the base of each of the four chambers, as well as the two arched cylinders, draw vertical cylinders of 5 mm diameter by clicking the 'sketch tab > circle' item and extrude them to 40 mm in length by clicking the 'features tab > extrude boss/base' item. Let each cylinder protrude into their respective chamber.To ensure the chambers positioning when assembling the six inner parts in the mold, add differential notches to the six cylinders (Figure 2) by sketching semicircles on top of the cylinders: click the 'sketch tab > sketch circle' menu item and use the 'feature tab > cut/extrude' menu item to create different depth indentations.\n\t\t\nSubtract their shapes from the chambers and arteries by selecting the solid body of the chamber and artery, right clicking, and pressing the 'combine' function after which the subtract setting can be selected. Do not merge these parts. Save all chambers and arteries separately.\nImport the heart muscle model. Offset the six-cylinder base sketches by starting a new sketch and selecting all cylinder base sketches by holding down the 'shift' key. Then, select the 'sketch tab > convert entities' menu item. Select the 'sketch tab > offset entities' menu item to offset the sketches by 2 mm.\n\t\nExtrude and merge these sketches by clicking the 'features tab > extrude boss/bass' menu item with the heart muscle model; repeat for the arching cylinders. Merge these cylinders with the heart muscle model by clicking the 'features tab > extrude boss/bass' menu item.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the heart muscle model opposite of the atria is over 2 mm in distance (Figure 1). Otherwise the wall will rupture when removing the inner molds.\nModel a cube from the base of the six cylinders down by first placing a reference plane by clicking the 'features tab > reference geometry > plane'. After this, click the 'sketch tab > square' menu item and sketch a square with a length and width that is 4 mm wider than the widest part of the heart muscle model.Extrude this downwards with a thickness of 8 mm by clicking the 'features tab > extrude boss/base' menu item, and merge this to the base of the six cylinders marking the 'merge parts' menu item. On the four corners of the base, add 4 mm cubes using the same method.\nUsing the square base as a sketch, extrude it to cover the entire heart model and subtract all other parts from this. Split the top part of the leftover rectangle at the widest part of the heart model. First place a reference plane at the desired height using the 'features tab > reference geometry > plane. After this, use the menu item 'insert > molds > split' to select the surface over which the split has to take place and the object requiring splitting.\n\t\nSplit the leftover rectangle again at the most convenient mold release position using the same method described in step 2.7 yet in a vertical position. Sketch 4 mm cubic sockets in the corners of the longitudinal parts of the mold and add 4 mm cubes to the corners of the top cover using the 'sketch tab > square' and 'features tab > extrude boss/base' menu items.\nSketch 50 circles of 1 mm in diameter covering the top of the entire outer mold model and cut-extrude these through all outer molds. Also, extrude several 1 mm cylinders on the side of the top cover at the widest locations of the heart muscle model. Cut-extrude a single 8 mm injection hole from the top cover.\n\t\nSave all four outer mold parts separately.CAUTION: In total, there should be ten mold components: the base of the mold, two outer mold side panels, one outer mold top cover, two inner mold atria with valve attachments, two inner mold ventricles with valve attachments, and one of each aortic and pulmonary inner mold artery with valve attachments.\nUse a jetting printer for printing with rigid and rubber-like photopolymer materials installed\n\t(see Table of Materials). When placing the parts for printing on the print bed, ensure the valve negatives are all printed facing upwards (vertically) (Figure 3).\n\t\nSelect the print settings to glossy. For the four chambers as well as the pulmonary and aortic mold attachments, select the flexible S95 material; for the other four mold parts, select the rigid print material.\nAfter printing the mold parts, remove the support material built up during printing by waterjet (see Table of Materials). After cleaning the mold parts, place the parts in a 5% sodium hydroxide solution for 24 h. After removing the parts from the solution, rinse them using cold water and leave to dry for 48 h before casting.\n3. Cold Injection Molding and Finishing\nSpray all surfaces of all mold parts with a release agent (see Table of Materials), except the valves, and wipe clean with tissue paper. Leave to dry for 15 min.\n\t\nClose the base of the mold and two side panels, and place on top of two spacers, so the base of the mold is not in direct contact with the table surface. Prepare the silicone by inserting a silicone cartridge into the manual dispensing gun (see Table of Materials).Add 5 mL of silicone squeezed from the dispensing gun into a measuring cup and mix using a toothpick. Using a toothpick, apply a generous amount of melted silicone to the negative and positive side of the right atria and ventricle valves. Make sure there are no air bubbles entrapped in the silicone (Figure 4).\n\t\nConnect the two chambers at the right valve angle, and push them onto their respective cylinders of the base mold. Repeat this for the left side. Finally, attach the pulmonary and aortic arched cylinders similarly. Leave these valves to solidify for 2 min, then attach the top part of the mold.\nAttach a static mixer to the cartridge, squeeze until the silicone is exiting the nozzle, then release the pressure. Position the entire mold on two spacers (Figure 5), insert the gun into the 8-mm injection molding socket, and squeeze with low pressure over the course of 3 min until all the air vents show signs of silicone overflow.\n\t\nStop injecting the silicone at this point, remove the mixer, and place the mold onto the table surface so that all bottom air vents are sealed, and no more silicone can flow from the bottom of the mold. Leave the silicone to solidify for 30 min.\nOpen the top part of the mold by prying and lifting a metal spacer into the crack between the top and lower part of the mold. Remove the side parts of the mold using the same method, removing one side at a time.\n\tNOTE: Make sure not to puncture the heart wall when inserting the spacer.Detect any air bubbles at the heart exterior after releasing the three outer mold components (Figure 6). Use a scalpel to pierce the bubble and fill it with a small amount silicone using a toothpick, then leave to cure for another 30 min.\nUse compressed air (see Table of Materials) to blow the heart model off the base of the mold leaving the six inner molds in the heart model. Make sure to firmly enclose the heart model with one hand to prevent air rupturing the heart wall.\n\t\nUse a syringe with water to fill and pressurize the left and right ventricles to release the inner molds. After this use a Magill forceps (see Table of Materials) to grab and pull out these inner two mold parts. Repeat this process for the pulmonary and aortic arteries and lastly for removing the left and right atria inner molds.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the positioning of the forceps does not compress the valve segment when clamp pressure is applied; it will destroy the printed valve.\nBind the two tubes leading directly downwards from the ventricles at the base of the heart model using tie wraps and remove access air vent strings by plucking them at the heart wall surface.\nSubscription Required.

However, older printers tend to work better as they use ink cartridges with larger diameter nozzles, which do not clog as easily. In addition, older printers tend to use mechanical paper feed sensors that are easier to bypass. Printers with optical sensors can be tricked but using a small strip of paper on the far edge of the printer during each cycle, but is a bit more difficult than the mechanical system to \"trick\". The currently commercially available printers that work the best have low resolution (DPI).\nHigher resolution printers tend to clog more easily. The resolution of the HP Deskjet 500 is 300 DPI. There are many commercially available printers (HP Deskjet series and others) that have a resolution of 600 DPI. This type of printer can be used with only a small increase in nozzle clogging issues that can be alleviated using careful cleaning (section 3).\nRemove the top plastic case of the printer by unlocking several plastic clips from the bottom base of the printer and slowly lifting the top off.\nUnscrew button/display light panel from top of printer, leaving it connected to the printer's motherboard.\nClean the inside of the printer, especially the areas where the ink cartridge rests and where printing occurs.\nLocate the cables supplying power to the paper feed mechanisms and unplug them from the motherboard.\n\t\nIn the HP DeskJet 500, these are found just below the paper tray towards the left of the front.\nLocate paper detection mechanism. Bypass the mechanism by affixing a string or wire loop to serve as a manual pull handle.In the HP DeskJet 500, the paper detection mechanism is a gray plastic lever found above and behind the printing/paper feed mechanism.\nCreate a stage in front of the paper feed mechanism (where the paper would be fed from and deposited) in order to bring the desired printing slides to a level just below the cartridge print head.\n\t\nFor our experiments, the foam shipping holder for 15 mL centrifuge tubes was used with several microscope slides taped in place in the printing region to bring the final level of the slides to the desired height.\nTo maintain aseptic technique, the printer can be placed inside a standard biohazard cabinet or tabletop laminar flow hood.\nIt is important to note that modifying a commercially available ink-jet printer will usually void the printer's manufacturer warranty.\n2. Converting Stock HP Ink Cartridges (HP 26 Black ink cartridge)\nRemove the cartridge from its packaging, leaving the protective tape covering the printer contacts and print head for the time being.\nStabilize the body of the cartridge (black portion) either with a clamp or vise (simply firmly gripping the cartridge by hand usually worked as well), leaving the green top clear of any obstacle.\nUsing pliers or an adjustable wrench, grasp the green top of the cartridge and twist back and forth several times until it breaks free.\n\t\nThis should not take much force, but the top is no longer needed, so it is okay if it breaks when removing it.\nUsing screwdrivers, pry off the clear plastic piece now exposed.\n\t\nAgain, this should not take much force, but it will not be needed, so it is okay if it breaks during removal.\nEmpty any remaining from the reservoir.\nRemove the plastic protective tape covering the printer contacts and print head.Thoroughly flush the reservoirs with water.\n\t\nUse a pipette or syringe to push water through the channels.\nWater will likely leak from the print head during this process; this is acceptable, and does not cause any damage to the functionality of the cartridge.\nWhen the water runs clear, allow the cartridge to dry.\n3. Cleaning Ink Cartridge\nIn order to maintain a clean printing environment, the ink cartridge should be cleaned before and after use.\n\t\nThis also helps with avoiding crystallization of salts and other biological material in the cartridge that could cause blockages.\nFully submerge the cartridge in a beaker full of de-ionized water, and sonicate for 15 minutes before and after printing.\nAfter sonication, remove the cartridge from the water, and shake out excess water.\nSpray 70% ethanol into the cartridge to create a more aseptic environment.\n\t\nEnsure that the ethanol has dried before adding the bioink printing solution.\n4. Making Cell Suspension - \"Bioink\"\nCulture cells until ready to passage.\n\t\nFor 3T3 fibroblasts: Seed cells on T-75 flasks at approximately 1.3x104 cells/cm2 in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Culture cells for two days in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nMake fluorescent g-actin stock solution at concentration 50 \u03bcg/ml in Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS).\nPassage cells.\n\t\nFor 3T3 fibroblasts: Remove media from flask and rinse twice with PBS. Cover cells with 5 ml 0.25% Trypsin+EDTA and incubate for 5 mins.\nAdd 5 ml of fresh medium and pipette the cell suspension into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate spent medium.\nResuspend the cells in PBS with fluorescent g-actin stock solution to create bioink.Bioink should have a final concentration of g-actin of 10 \u03bcg/ml and a cell concentration of 1x105 cell/ml. This concentration has been optimized to limit amount of cells per drop and clogging of the printer head.8\nNote that 250 \u03bcl of bioink prints three cover slips with the pattern shown in Figure 2.\n5. Bioprinting\nPower on and let the printer warm up.\nPlace desired printing surface (here, we use 22 mm x 22 mm coverslips) on the center of the stage prepared in step 1.6.\nCreate a printing pattern file.\n\t\nOpen Microsoft Word (or any other drawing software), and draw the desired pattern.\nPick a desired print pattern for cell printing in the premade file.\nLoad the prepared cartridge with desired cell suspension.\n\t\nPipette suspension into the small circular well at the bottom of cartridge compartment. Use approximately 100-120 \u03bcl of solution. The printed drop size is around 130 picoliters.8\nPrint the file with the HP Deskjet 500 Printer.\n\t\nFor best results, print smaller patterns multiple times (5), by changing the amount of copies desired in the word processing program.\nPrinter will warm up again, then cartridge will move to the \"ready position\".\nWhen cartridge moves into the ready position (slightly to the left of the ink drip well below and stays there), pull up on the paper feed mechanism wire, and printing should commence.\n\t\nFor multiple copies of the printing, the paper feed mechanism will have to be released after every cycle or page printed. The cartridge will then return to the \"ready\" position, and the paper feed mechanism wire should be raised again.\nThe printer will print onto the coverslip placed on the center of the printing stage in step 5.2 (see Figure 2).\n6. Representative ResultsThe representative results of the entire conversion process of a standard, off-the-shelf HP Deskjet 500, standard HP 26 series cartridges will create a printer with the capability of printing cell solutions for many types of analysis as stated before. The completed printer after conversion is shown in Figure 3, with a printing stage to place the microscope cover slip onto. The printer can be useful in analysis in many fields, including but not limited to: single cell mechanics, tissue engineering, gene transfection, biosensor micropatterning, and direct cell therapies. 1-10, 16-22\nIn this example, an HP Deskjet 500 printer and HP 26 series ink cartridges were modified for bioprinting. Using this printer setup with a bioink consisting of a fibroblast cell suspension in a g-actin monomer solution, cells were printed onto glass microscope coverslips. Figure 1 illustrates representative results of printed fibroblast cells, which show incorporated fluorescent actin monomers. The results were obtained in a controlled aseptic environment in which the cells were printed into customizable patterns.\nThe pattern used in this example was created in Microsoft Word (Figure 2). This pattern created a continuous line of the printing solution across the majority of the microscope slide. Figure 4 shows the straight line in which the bioink and cells are mutually deposited. It should be noted that immediately after printing, there is an increase of background fluorescence because the bioink solution, in which the cells are suspended, contains free excess fluorescent actin monomers. This background fluorescence significantly decreases after the addition of growth media on the cells (Figure 1), which washes excess monomer from the substrate.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3681/3681fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

At \u03bb >1 encapsulated cells compete for resources and favor success of the faster growing variants. At \u03bb< 1, more evolutionary trajectories can be maintained as slower growing phenotypes will not be readily eliminated by competition within the microdroplet. The experiment can thus be tuned for more or less clonal interference by altering \u03bb and provides yet another controllable parameter for the investigator.\nPrepare at least four populations of 2\u00a0mL growth media containing the desired number of cells to 50-mL conical-bottom tubes.Critical: Maintain the same \u03bb value during experimental evolution to eliminate the effects of \u03bb change on the evolutionary trajectories. We typically maintain the starting population of \u223c2.6\u00d7106 CFU mL-1 of E.\u00a0coli in microdroplets of 247\u00a0\u00b1 3.5\u00a0\u03bcm for \u223c20 \u03bb. The average number of cells per microdroplet used was \u223c20. The choice of \u03bb determines the extent of clonal interference within each microdroplet. Values of \u03bb significantly less than 1 will dramatically decrease clonal interference and may allow the investigator to identify more evolutionary trajectories than higher values in which different variants within a microdroplet will compete against each other for resources based largely on growth rate. The number of cells in a microdroplet can be derived from the Poisson distribution, as P(X\u00a0= x)\u00a0= \u03bbxe-\u03bb/x!, where P is the probability of finding x cells per microdroplet and the parameter \u03bb is the average number of cells per microdroplet which is calculated by multiplying the cell concentration by microdroplets volume.Emulsions of microfluidic generated microdroplets can provide spatially segregated micro-environments in experimental evolution. Microorganisms of interest can be trapped within a microemulsion. One milliliter of emulsion contains millions of microdroplets (e.g., size 90\u00a0\u03bcm and volume \u223c380 pl) and thus, each milliliter can be thought of as having millions of individual bioreactors. We use an iterative cycle of encapsulation, adaptation/selection, and decapsulation followed by deep sequencing of the populations to identify genetic changes associated with antibiotics of interest. Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows schematic diagrams of the geometry of microdroplets-based microfluidic and the protocol of serial propagation in the emulsion for experimental evolution. A flow-focusing geometry in a microfluidic chip consists of two microchannels (100\u00a0\u03bcm wide) for a dispersed phase and one microchannel (200\u00a0\u03bcm wide) for a continuous phase converging into the main microchannel (200\u00a0\u03bcm wide) for two-phase microdroplet flows. The height of all microchannels is 80\u00a0\u03bcm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1605-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Microdroplets-based microfluidic platform for experimental evolution for identification of antimicrobial biomarkers or the production of synthetic ecologies for use in multi-species studies\n(A) Encapsulation process: Antibiotic susceptible cell is compartmentalized in the desired size of microdroplets with an appropriate antibiotic concentration. Representative optical microscopy images of monodispersed microdroplets immediately after the junction and in the observation chamber are shown in the inset (Scale bar: 200 \u03bcm).(B) Iterative culturing, selection, and amplification process: An optical micrograph of the compartmentalized model organism (Escherichia coli) after the incubation process is shown in the inset (Scale bar: 200 \u03bcm). For propagating the emulsion, the microdroplets are broken after incubation, and the cells are diluted in fresh media before inoculating into new emulsion microdroplets containing higher antibiotic concentrations. After dilution, if 5 resistant variants are encapsulated in new microdroplets, then these can multiply once again. Through this repeated series of processes, the evolved resistant mutants increase in frequency with each iteration.\n(C) Applications of microdroplets-based experimental evolution: Optical microscopy images of compartmentalized Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptomyces venezuelae, and fluorescence microscopy images of encapsulated green and red fluorescent proteins labeled P.\u00a0aeruginosa and S.\u00a0venezuelae and their co-encapsulation after the incubation process are shown in the inset (Scale bar: 100 \u03bcm).Founder cells are encapsulated in a water-in-oil emulsion system that includes the antibiotic. While the initially inoculated cells are reproduced within microdroplets, mutant cells that are resistant to an antibiotic are evolved. After incubation under appropriate conditions, the resistant cell multiplies to reach the carrying capacity of the microdroplet while the others may not grow at all or to a much lower density in the presence of antibiotics. In this highly simplified illustration, only 12 microdroplets are shown for simplicity on day 1. The microdroplets are broken for propagating the emulsion, and the cells are diluted in fresh media before inoculating into new emulsion microdroplets containing higher antibiotic concentrations. After dilution, if 5 resistant genotypes are encapsulated in new emulsion microdroplets, then these can multiply once again. This cycle is then repeated, and the more resistant genotypes will increase in frequency with each iteration. At the end of the experiment, deep sequencing of the entire population and individual endpoint isolates will identify the genes associated with resistance to antibiotics. This section describes step-by-step instructions of cell encapsulation for one control and five biological replicates using prepared bacterial cell liquid cultures and microdroplet generators in the previous step as outlined in Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1605-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03.

Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9]. The ImageJ software, an open-source image processing program, can be used for analyses of microdroplet diameters. After collecting microscopy images of more than 50 microdroplets, their projected areas were used to calculate the diameters of microdroplets because they are an elongated shape when the diameter of microdroplets is longer than the wide or depth of the microchannel. Histograms of the microdroplet diameters are then made for evaluation. The average diameter values with standard deviations of microdroplets are accurately determined by fitting Gaussian or Lorentzian models to the histograms.\nCollect \u223c2.0\u00a0mL of emulsions (1.0\u00a0mL of microdroplets) for each population to a 50-mL conical-bottom tube for 10\u00a0min (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: The production rate of parallelized six microfluidic chips is 36\u00a0mL/h which is equivalent to 4.6\u00d7106 microdroplets/h (production rate of the individual chip is 6\u00a0mL/h, 7.6\u00d7105 microdroplets/h).Critical: In our optimal microdroplets-incubation method, we achieved a comparable bacterial growth rate within microdroplets compared to a flask, which was shaken for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C using an orbital shaking incubator (calculation based on E.\u00a0coli).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S1.

Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9].\nOptional: Use a sterile capillary tube to take microscopy images of microdroplets after incubation. Recommend using a capillary tube with a path length similar to microdroplets\u2019 diameter for a clear image as the morphology of microdroplets can be distorted by smaller path lengths.\nAfter adding 250\u00a0\u03bcL of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-octanol (PFO) to 1.0\u00a0mL of microdroplets, gently mix to break microdroplets by tapping a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube with a finger for 30\u00a0s (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).

Preparation of low-fouling background\nWeigh out 2 g of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) (Sigma - cell culture tested) into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Dissolve in 50 mL of 95% (v/v) ethanol in water. This typically takes 24 hrs of sonication.\nDip-coat epoxy-functional glass slide (Genetix) with the pHEMA solution. The epoxy groups will rapidly form covalent linkages with the pHEMA coating. Dip-coating is achieved by holding the glass slide with tweezers and dipping the slide into the solution. Typically 5 mm of the slide is left uncoated, which is useful for orientating the slide and can also act as a positive control as an adhering surface. The slide is then withdrawn from the pHEMA solution over a period of 1 s, inverted and left to dry in a near horizontal position for 10 min before placing in a slide holder.\nThe pHEMA coated slides are then left at atmospheric conditions for 1 week to allow the complete evaporation of the solvent.\n2. Preparation of monomer solution\nWeigh 120 mg of the photoinitiator 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone and add to 3 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) to make a 4% (w/v) photoinitiator solution. This is best done fresh before each print run, so the mass and volume of the solution made can be varied to suit how much photoinitiator solution is required. The solution is stable up to a month.\nMonomer solutions are made by adding 1 part of the photoinitiator solution to 3 parts of the neat monomer. This is achieved by pipetting 5 \u03bcL of photoinitiator solution and 15 \u03bcL of monomer into a 384 well source plate. A total volume of 20 \u03bcL is ideal for spot formation. Higher volumes require additional blotting before uniform spots can be produced. Smaller volumes may result in incomplete loading of the pin.This method is currently limited to the use of acrylate/methacrylate monomers that are soluble in DMF by virtue of these being the only combinations that have been explored; acrylamides and other solvents are likely to be amenable to the printing process. To achieve the monomer concentration suggested (75% w/w) liquid monomers are also required, although lower monomer concentrations can be used for solid monomers (the reduced monomer concentration does not appear to adversely alter the surface chemistry of the resultant polymer however it is likely that the molecular weight and glass transition temperature is altered). Highly volatile monomers are also difficult to use due to the rapid evaporation of monomer prior to the UV curing step when polymerising. Depending on the number of monomer solutions a run can take as long as 6 hours and towards the end of the run volatile monomers will have evaporated from the source plate. Use of volatile monomers can be achieved by cooling the printing stage and using short print runs only.\nWith the exception of a few highly hydrophilic monomers such as poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate, the dissolution of the resultant polymer spots in aqueous buffers has not been observed, thus, the use of a crosslinking monomer is not required, although is not excluded.\n3. Polymer microarray formation\nThe typical procedure for polymer microarray formation is depicted schematically in Figure 1.\nMicroarray formation is achieved using a contact robot (Biodot) using a XYZ stage (Figure 2). Slotted pins of 220 \u03bcm diameter are used (Arrayit 96B). All pins should be cleaned by sonication in dichloromethane for 10 mins prior to the print run and likewise the pin holder should also be cleaned.Pins are loaded into the holder, blotting and array slides are loaded and then the entire chamber is filled with argon to reduce the oxygen level to below 2000 ppm, which is sufficiently low to avoid quenching of the polymerization radicals by oxygen. The humidity is maintained at between 30-40%. Including humidity allows for the pHEMA to swell allowing for the formed polymer to interpenetrate the pHEMA layer and become physically entrapped to the surface 2.\nThe print run is commenced. Each run consists of:\n \nLoading sample from source plate. The pins are lowered into the solutions at a speed of 25 mm/s, held in solution for 2.5 s and then withdrawn at a speed of 25 mm/s (Figure 2).\nPins must be blotted before printing to remove monomer solution from the outside of the pin. Subsequently monomer delivery occurs from the quilled part of the pin to achieve consistent spot formation. The blotting sequence used consists of 33 contacts with a clean glass slide. For the first four positions the number of contacts made is 10, 5, 4 and 3 respectively. The next four positions 2 contacts are made and in the last 3 positions 1 contact is made. Total contact time for each contact is 10 ms and approach and withdrawal speed is 175 mm/s. By this point the spots formed should have a consistent shape and geometry. Failure at this point indicates unclean pins or dust contaminant in the monomer solutions.The monomer solutions are then printed onto the pHEMA coated glass slides (Figure 2). One contact is made per spot at a pin movement of 175 mm/s and contact time of 10 ms, which depending on the viscosity and surface energy of the monomer solution gives an average spot diameter of 400 \u03bcm. Typically 3 replicate arrays are printed onto each glass slide and a total of 10 slides are printed on a single run. This equates to 30 spots per cycle.\nPins are washed in DMF. 2.5 L of fresh DMF is provided for the entire wash run. Pins are washed in a flow bath with agitation.\nConcurrent with the wash, the freshly printed slides are irradiated with a short wave UV (365 nm) source at a density of 30 mV/cm2 for the duration of the wash period that lasts 30 s.\nAfter all monomer solutions are printed the arrays are irradiated with UV (365 nm) for additional 10 min.\nThe freshly printed arrays are kept at low pressure (<50 mTorr) for 1 week to remove unpolymerized monomer and solvent.\n4. High throughput surface characterization (HTSC)\nA general scheme of the HTSC techniques is shown in Figure 3. Central to the automated, high throughput approach is the alignment of the polymer microarray with the characterization apparatus. In all cases this is achieved using a camera that gives a top view of the array. Initially, the array is rotated to align with the X-Y movement of the stage. A corner spot of the array is then located and designated specific coordinates. The position of each polymer spot can then be predicted using the dimensions of the array.\nWater contact angle (WCA) measurementsWCA measurements are taken using the sessile drop method on an automated Kr\u00fcss DSA 100 instrument. A single water drop with a volume of ~400 pL is dispensed using a piezo-driven print head onto each polymer spot. The diameter of a polymer spot is typically 300 \u03bcm and the base diameter of the water droplet on the polymer spot is typically 100 \u03bcm, thus, only one measurement can be obtained per polymer spot.\nAn X-Y stage allows for the automated positioning of each polymer spot under the print head 7. This is achieved using a camera located above the sample that provides a top view of the array. Initially, the camera position must be adjusted to align the dispensing of the water droplet to the centre of the camera view and then the array can be aligned to the print head.\nA high speed camera records the side profile of the droplet upon hitting the surface and subsequently evaporating. The frame that captures the initial impact of drop is used to measure the contact angle. A circle is fitted to the drop profile and the contact angle subsequently determined.\nTime-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)\n \nSample is loaded onto stage. This involves firstly lining the stage with clean Al foil, which helps with charge compensation, and then holding the slide in place by use of metal screw tabs.\nSample stage is placed into the transfer chamber of the ToF-SIMS and allowed to pump down until 1.6 \u00d7 10-6 mbar. The sample is then transferred to the main analysis chamber, which typically has a vacuum pressure of 1.0 \u00d7 10-8 mbar.ToF-SIMS measurements are conducted using an ION-ToF IV instrument operated using a monoisotopic Bi3+ primary ion source operated at 25 kV in \"bunched mode\". A pulsed 1 pA primary ion beam is rastered over the analysis area, with both positive and negative secondary ions collected from a 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm area of each polymer spot in the microarray for a 10-second acquisition time. Ion masses were determined using a high resolution Time-of-Flight analyzer allowing accurate mass assignment. The typical mass resolution (at m/z 41) was just over 6000. Low energy electrons (20 eV) were used to compensate for surface charging caused by the positively charged primary ion beam on the insulating surfaces 8.\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM)\n \nA large stage AFM with an automated stage is required for analysing the arrays on the glass slide. A Dimension or ICON microscope is ideal for this purpose.\nSample is placed on stage and stage position is homed to top right corner of the array.\nThe position of the bottom left corner of the array is found, which allows the position of all other spots to be interpolated.\nA position list is generated and fed into the auto-sampling feature of the software.\nAFM measurements are taken using a Nanoscope 3000A instrument in tapping mode. Silicon tips with a resonant frequency of approximately 300 kHz and a force constant of 40 N/m are used (Tap300Al, Budget Sensors). 5x5 \u03bcm regions of the polymer are measured 9.\nThe root mean square (RMS) roughness is measured across this region for each image using SPIP batch processing software. Each image is initially flattened prior to roughness measurements.All images require a manual viewing to identify imaging artefacts that may need to be removed from roughness measurements. During this step images may also be categorised based upon common surface features 9.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)\n \nA microarray slide is affixed to a sample bar using double sided tape and subsequently loaded into the sample chamber of a Kratos Axis Ultra XPS instrument.\nEnter into the sample chamber and wait until it reaches a pressure below 10-8 Torr.\nThe appropriate operation parameters, such as a monochromated x-ray source (Al, 1486.6 eV), anode potential and current (10kV and 15mA), aperture size (110\u03bcm), pass energy (80 eV for wide scan and 20 eV for high resolution scan) are selected. The X-ray source is focused using two opposite corners of the microarray and optimizing the oxygen signal from the sample. The x and y positions of individual spots is then determined and logged as a position list.\nA program chart is written and then run for the acquisition of data, including wide scans and high resolution scans for specific elements.\nRaman spectroscopy\n \nRaman spectra are taken for each polymer spot using a Raman microscope LabRAM HR (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Initially, the Raman signal is calibrated using a silicon wafer and the Raman shift of Si at 520.7 cm-1.\nThe sample is then placed on the stage and the focus of the laser (wavelength = 523 nm) is adjusted to maximize the C-H Raman shift at 2950 cm-1.\nThe position of the centre of the top left spot on the microarray is then set as the origin and a map of the microarray is setup using the array function on the labRAM HR software.\n10 spectra are acquired cumulatively for each sample with an irradiation time of 0.5 s.\n5. Bacterial assayThe array can be exposed to many different biological assays including attachment and proliferation of stem cells, other cells types and bacteria 3,10,4. Here we describe a bacterial attachment assay, which is shown schematically in Figure 4.\nA bacterial strain transformed with GFP expressed plasmid is cultured overnight at 37 \u00b0C in 10 mL of LB media in a 50 mL falcon tube with shaking at 200 rpm.\nThe OD600 of the bacterial culture is measured and sufficient overnight culture is inoculated into 15 mL RPMI-1640 defined media to result in a final OD600 of 0.01.\nArrays are prewashed in sterilized distilled water for 10 mins to remove any dissolvable components from the arrays (unpolymerised monomer, oligomers and solvent)\nWashed array slides are placed in a clean petri dish and UV sterilized for 10 min.\nA slide with the array is placed into a petri dish and 15 mL of the inoculated RMPI-1640 media is added. Concurrently another slide is placed in a petri dish and incubated with non-innoculatd RPMI-1640 as a control.\nSlides are incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 72 hours with shaking at 60 rpm.\nSlides are washed twice with 15 mL of sterile PBS.\nSlides are washed twice with 15 mL of sterile distilled water.\nSlides are air-dried.Slides are imaged using a GenePix Autoloader 4200AL Scanner (Molecular Devices, US) with a 488 nm excitation laser and standard blue emission filter (510-560nm). A representative polymer autofluorescence image is shown in Figure 2. This should be done as soon as possible to avoid the decay of the GFP. If this is not possible the cells should undergo fixation. Furthermore, the inclusion of appropriate positive controls with a known bacterial response is imperative to be able to normalize the results and allow experiments conducted on different days to be quantitatively comparable. The total fluorescence intensity from polymer spots is acquired using GenePix Pro 6 software (Molecular Devices, US). This is done for both slides incubated with bacteria and just media. To find the fluorescence due to growth of bacteria the fluorescence on the media control is subtracted from the fluorescence measured on the slide incubated with bacteria.\nSlides can also be stained by 20 \u03bcM SYTO17 nucleic acid dye (Invitrogen, UK) at room temperature for 30 minutes and imaged using a Carl Zeiss LSM 700 Laser Scanning Microscope with ZEN 2009 imaging software (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The coverage of bacteria on the surface is determined using open source Image J 1.44 software (National Institute of Health, US).\n6. Representative ResultsThe conditions of printing have been optimized to print the highest quality polymer microarrays. The humidity should be kept at between 30-40%. The delamination of polymer spots in aqueous environments was observed frequently for arrays printed at a humidity below 30%, suggesting that this humidity is insufficient to swell the pHEMA layer and allow for the physical entrapment of the polymer to the substrate. The humidity can be increased further to alter the diameter of the polymer spots, but this is dependent on the monomer chemistry. For example, where equal volumes of polymerization solution were printed and as humidity was increased from 40 to 80 % the spot diameter decreased from 430 \u03bcm to 370 \u03bcm for a monomer containing a hydrophilic ethylene glycol moiety equal volume whilst for a monomer containing a hydrophobic aliphatic carbon ring structure the spot diameter increased from 290 \u03bcm to 350 \u03bcm (Figure 5).The degree of polymerization can be monitored using Raman spectroscopy to measure the C=C Raman shift that is detected at 1640 cm-1, which should be normalized with the C=O Raman shift at 1720 cm-1. The Raman spectra was measured for polymer spots polymerized for varied UV exposure (Figure 6). The C=C:C=O ratio decreased as UV exposure increased from 0 to 50 s, whereupon no further decrease in the C=C:C=O ratio was observed with further UV irradiation (Figure 6). Raman spectra were also measured for polymer spots polymerized at varied O2 level and the C=C Raman shift was observed as the O2level was decreased to 2000 ppm, however no further reduction was observed for an O2 level below this (Figure 7A). Raman spectroscopy also demonstrated the ability of the vacuum extraction step to remove unpolymerized monomer. Prior to vacuum extraction the C=C Raman shift was greater for the polymer polymerized at 3300 ppm compared with 2000 ppm (Figure 7A), however, after vacuum extraction the height of the Raman shift is indistinguishable (Figure 7B), suggesting all unpolymerized monomer has been removed during the vacuum extraction step. To summarize, polymerization conditions include a humidity of 30-40%, UV exposure greater than 50 s at an O2 level below 2000 ppm with a vacuum extraction step after printing for 7 days.After printing and vacuum extraction the success of the polymerization of polymer spots can be assessed by simple light microscopy to identify and anomalous spot morphologies. Typically, spots should appear circular and uniform, as shown in Figure 8 on the left. The likely cause for a change in geometry is a damaged or unclean pin. For a small number of monomer combinations we have observed misshapen spots, for example a central spot with a satellite of small spots, shown in Figure 8 on the right, or a fried egg shape where there is a central spot on top of large, flatter spot. This may be caused by phase separation prior to printing relating to differences in the viscosity, hydrophilicity, volatility or surface tension of the monomers and suggests that the monomer combination is not compatible with this format. Additional chemical mapping of polymer spots by techniques such as ToF-SIMS is also an important and sometimes necessary quality control step to determine the distribution of the materials' chemistries across the spots and the array. This technique can identify excessive spreading of some materials not visible by light microscopy and identify phase separation within individual polymer spots.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3636/3636fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

They were housed in isolators and fed with a pathogen-free diet and water. The climatic conditions, lighting program, and chicken fodder and water were manually-operated and the chicks were cared for in agreement with the approved guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Committee of China Agricultural University. Sporulated oocysts \\(2.5 x 103) were inoculated into broiler chicks by oral gavage, and faeces were collected at 5-9 days post-inoculation according to eimerian species and the experimental requirements 19-21. The collected oocysts of Eimeria  mitis were used to spike other oocyst-free chicken faeces.\n     Seed-and- recovery experiment for validation of the current method by using different irrevelant matrices.\n    The use of E. mitis oocysts recovered from freshly experimental infection to spike different chicken and rabbit pure food used alone or in combination with fresh chicken and rabbit faecal materials in a ratio of 1 \\(chicken food) to 5 \\(chicken or rabbit faecal materials). Furthermore, the ratio of 1\\(rabbit faecal material) to 5 \\(rabbit food) was tested. Faeces from experimentally infected animals were collected from chicken and rabbit. Each sample was mixed with a known amount of freshly collected oocysts. The seeded matrices were homogenized with saturated NaCl solution at a 1\\(80 g):12.5 \\(920 ml saturated NaCl solution) ratio employing a suitable laboratory mixer until the mixture was homogeneous as described below.\n**Trichostrongylid egg preparation.**Two-month-old sheep \\(Ovis aries) that were raised under confined living conditions to avoid worm exposure were moved from a local farmer in Jin Zhan village, Chaoyang, Beijing, China with an average liveweight of 25.02 kg  \u00b1  2.2 kg.  Faecal materials and blood were collected for parasitological, haemato-biochemical, immunological analyses \\(unpublished data) to confirm absence of infection. Upon arrival in China Agricultural University facilities, all sheep were tagged \\(each sheep was assigned an arbitrary number for sample identification purposes), weighed, and then treated with double doses of ivermectin \\(Shijiazhuang Fengqiang Animal Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) and a single dose of levamisole \\(Hebei New Century Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd). The sheep were acclimatized for four weeks before infection experiments initiated. The animals received a diet containing forage \\(grass silage): concentrate \\(barley, maize, wheat, wheat bran and bruised soya) 1:1 ad libitum. Sheep were exposed to a 12 h/12 h light/darkness regimen at mean internal relative humidity \\(23.4  %  \u00b1  2.5 %) and temperature \\(19.28  \u00baC \u00b1  0.94 \u00baC) within the dwelling facility. Infective 3th stage larvae \\(L3) of H. contortus were kindly provided by Professor Dr. Hu from State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, China. A total of three; 3-month-old sheep were orally infected with a single dose of 5,000 H. contortus infective 3rd-stage larvae \\(L3) and maintained for 50-day post-infection. Faeces were collected at 14-50 day post-inoculation according to the experimental requirements.\n  \n**PROCEDURES**\n**Oocyst and egg concentration by the electrical cream separator machine.**Cream separator machine \\(MOTOP C14-100, Ukraine) can be used throughout the separation process, which can be looked at as the three-phase separator machine \\(Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The cream separator machine consists of a bowl spinning around a vertical axis, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Faecal suspensions are introduced through the feed inlet under centrifugal force. The heavier liquid and faecal residue pass to the distant regions of the bowl, while the lighter layer \\(oocyst- and egg- enriched layer) moves to the center. The conical plates \\(inclined discs) are arranged as shown in Fig. 3 to give smoother flow and better separation. For maximal recovery rate, the heavier layer can be reprocessed again, and the pellet can be collected and blended with the fluid floatation medium for 1 min to separate the remaining number of the parasite oocysts and eggs. The manual cleaning and discharge of faecal residue from the conical bowl can be carried out between runs. However, the fully automatic centrifugal cream separator machine with mechanical washing and discharge of faecal residue \\(conical bowl with nozzle) can process unlimited amount of faecal materials \\(i.e. continuous feeding of faecal suspension and ceaseless discharge of faecal residue).\nCream separator machine assembling procedure\nThe cream separator machine set up can be divided into ten steps. These are:\nStep 1: Put the rubber ring into the slot, and mount the inclined discs sequentially.\nStep 2. Cover the discs with the separating plastic plate and then with bowl cover. \nStep 3. Screw the nut with a hand and then tighten it with a bowl wrench by inserting two jets of the bowl wrench into two holes of the nut.Step 4. Install the assembled drum onto the spindle, and then install the following parts: Heavier layer discharge, lighter layer discharge and cream separator container.\nStep 5: Close the cork of the cream separator container. \n\u25baCritical step: The installation area shall be horizontal and adjusted with a level gauge. \nStep 6: Turn on cream separator and wait 30 seconds until it reaches its maximum speed.\nStep 7: Pour the sieved faecal suspension into the cream separator container.\nStep 8: Open the cork of the cream separator container. \nStep 9: Collect the lighter and heavier layers. \n\u25baCritical step: The bowl disassembly is achieved in reverse order of its assembly.\nStep 10: Boil the bowl components for 10 min after washing to switch between different eimerian oocyst and haemonchine egg species.\n**Adjustment of oocyst- and egg- enriched lighter layer volume**\nStep 1. Adjust the lighter layer volume by turning the lighter layer regulating screw at the upper part of the separating plate using the lighter layer regulating key. \nStep 2. Turn the lighter layer regulating screw clockwise for smaller volume, and counterclockwise for larger volume \\(Fig. 4).\n\u25baCritical step: it is desirable to drive the lighter layer regulating screw out for oocyst- and egg- enriched lighter layer.\n**Procedural steps for coping with the egg-/oocyst- containing faecal material.**The oocyst- / egg- containing faecal material was mixed with saturated solution of sodium chloride \\(NaCl) in the ratio of 80 g of faecal material diluted and rehydrated with 920 ml salt solution. After being blended for 1 min \\(i.e. to avoid trapping of the oocysts and eggs) and squeezed through four layers of cheese cloth \\(the residue on the cheese cloth is again diluted and resqueezed), the oocyst- / egg- containing faecal material is placed in the electrical cream separator container and centrifuged at a high speed \\(approximately 10000 rpm) for 5 min. \n**Vacuum filtration for residual faecal material removal.**\n    Filtration is the passage of the lighter layer through a filter with pores small enough to remain oocysts and eggs and to eliminate fine debris. With respect to mesh sieve pore sizes, mesh sieve filters \\(ELKO Filtering Co, LLC, USA) ranged from 5 \u00b5m \\(E. mitis) to 35 \u00b5m \\(H. contortus) were used throughout this study. A 10 \u03bcm mesh sieve filter is the correct size for Eimeria maxima, Eimeria brunetti and Eimeria praecox and for other chicken eimerian parasites the 5 \u03bcm mesh sieve filter is applied to avoid leakage. The oocysts and eggs accumulated on the mesh sieve filter were washed with distilled water and collected using 2.5 % potassium dichromate and distilled water, respectively for parasite development. As shown in Fig. 5, the mesh sieve filter is present at the top of ceramic funnel and the flask with one side-arm attached to rubber tube connected with another vacuum trap flask. The latter is connected with vacuum pump, which has an advantage over the ordinary gravitational force.\n**Cream separator machine coupled with vacuum filtration procedure**The whole separation process for eimerian oocyst of chicken and trichostrongylid egg of sheep employing cream separator machine can be listed as follows:\nStep 1: Mix 80 g of faecal material with 980 ml of saturated salt solution \\(1:12.5). \n\u25ba Critical step: keep some salt solution from step 1 to add them to the residue \\(step 4) on the cheese cloth and resqueeze again. \nStep 2: Homogenize with a laboratory mixer until the mixture is homogeneous \\(i.e. approximately 1 min).\nStep 3: Squeeze homogenate through four layers of wet cheese cloth \\(i.e. immersed in saturated salt solution) to remove large debris. \n\u25ba Critical step: Soak the cheese cloth in saturated salt solution to avoid trapping of oocysts and eggs\nStep 4: Repeat step 3 using the residue on the cheese cloth and resqueeze again.\nStep 5: Mix the filtrate from step 1 and step 3\nStep 6: Apply filtrate to the faecal suspension container of cream separator machine, when it reached its maximum speed.\nStep 7: Collect the lighter, heavier layers and pellet in separate containers\n\u25ba Critical step: Reapply the heavier layer as described above \\(step 6) and the pellet \\(faecal residue) as above \\(step 1) to increase the recovery of the oocysts and eggs from the faeces.\nStep 8: Apply cream separator machine-purified oocysts and eggs \\(lighter layers) to vacuum filtration for salt and fine debris removal using a suitable mesh sieve filter and plain tap water for 2 min.\nStep 9: Collect the accumulated oocysts and eggs using plastic pasteur pipette and the suitable incubation solutions \\(2.5 % potassium dichromate for eimerian oocysts and distilled water for trichostronglid eggs) for subsequent processes.\u25ba Critical step: Bleach the collected oocysts in 4 to 5 volumes of ice-cold household bleach \\(sodium hypochlorite, ~ 5 % w/v aqueous) and placed on ice for 10 min with occasional shaking. Then wash thoroughly as described above \\(step 8) under aseptic conditions. Similarly, sterilize the accumulated eggs by washing twice with 2 % sodium hypochlorite for 20 s each followed by five times with sterile distilled water under disinfected conditions. Conduct this critical step for metabolic studies of oocysts/eggs, sporozoites/larvae used for cell or tissue culture inoculation or studying the microbial community associated with nematode eggs \\(unpublished data). \n      \n      A Flow chart recapping the concentration and purification of eimerian oocysts and trichostrongylid eggs are set out in Figure 6.**Oocyst and egg separation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient**                                                                        Oocysts and eggs were recovered according to 10 with major modifications as follows: The buffered sucrose solution \\(PBS-Ca buffer, PBS, PH 7.4 plus 1 mM CaCl2) is an ideal density gradient material owing to low cost, inertness, stability, high solubility, and non-toxic nature. Furthermore, removal of fine debris and sucrose from separated oocysts and eggs is best achieved by repeated washings with distilled water or a suitable buffer under vacuum filtration. To decrease the osmotic strength with sucrose solutions and the effect of the centrifugal force, the centrifugal speed and time \\(i.e. 2000 rpm for 10 min) are reduced to maintain high oocyst and egg viabilities.  Preformed gradients of the discontinuous sucrose are prepared by carefully layering two consecutive solutions \\(15 ml each) of different density \\(i.e. 60% and 30%) on top of each other in the 50 ml centrifuge tube with a concrete shift in density \\(a step) between each \\(Fig. 7A).  A small amount of phenol red was added to the 30 % sucrose solution to easily discriminate between the gradient layers. Preformed gradients of discontinuous sucrose used for oocyst and egg separation can be prepared using over-layering \\(Fig. 8A and Fig. 8B) and under-layering techniques \\(Fig. 8C). The gradient is prepared by layering progressively less dense 30 % sucrose solution upon 60 % by slowly allowing it to run down inside the yellow \\(200 \u03bcl) pipettor tip, which is placed on the end of the blue \\(1000 \u03bcl) pipettor tip, and gravity will drain the solutions down the side of the tube steadily as shown in Fig. 8A.  Other applications of the discontinuous sucrose solutions included the setup described below in Fig. 8B using the peristaltic pump \\(Peristaltic pump, HL-2B; Shanghai Jingke industrial co.LTD) and the under-layering technique \\(Fig. 8C)\\[a syringe with a large needle is employed to introduce the denser sucrose solution \\(i.e. 60 %) under the lighter one \\(i.e. 30 %)]. A 7.5 ml of oocyst- or egg- suspension \\(80 g of faecal material diluted and rehydrated with 980 tap water) after being blended for 1 min \\(i.e. to avoid trapping of the oocysts and eggs) and squeezed through four layers of cheese cloth \\(the residue on the cheese cloth is again diluted and resqueezed) is layered on top of the gradient as a narrow band \\(i.e. to avoid streaming) and centrifuged at a low speed. On centrifugation, the oocysts and eggs mainly banded at the interface between the two densities \\(i.e. lighter oocyst- and egg- containing suspension and denser sucrose solutions, 30 %). As most of the oocysts/eggs are collected at the interface between the sample \\(oocyst- and egg-containing solutions) and the 30 % sucrose, this one-step method involving sucrose step-density gradient centrifugation for concentration and recovery of eimerian oocysts and trichostronglyid eggs free from residual fecal materials could be simplified to have one continuous gradient \\(30 %), which will produce the so-called concentrated oocysts and eggs on top of the 30 % sucrose solution \\(Fig. 7B). This additional sucrose float is necessary to minimize faecal debris carried over the suitable mesh filter under vacuum for further purification and collection.Oocysts and eggs isolated \\(enriched) by the sucrose method were subjected to a vacuum filtration through 5 \u00b5m \\(E. mitis) and 35 \u00b5m \\(H. contortus) nylon meshes for fine debris and sugar removal using thorough washings with plain tap water. The accumulated oocysts and eggs by filtration over the sieve were collected in 2.5 % potassium dichromate \\(eimerian oocysts) and distilled water \\(haemonchine eggs), respectively. The numbers of oocysts and eggs recovered were adjusted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min and addition of the required volume of the previous solutions.\n**Recovery rate**  \n    The average oocyst recovery rate \\(as a percentage) was calculated by using the formula \\[\\(oocyst number recovered / \\(oocyst number experimentally detected or seeded)] \u00d7 100; however, the average egg recovery rate was computed by employing the sentential function \\[\\(egg number recovered / \\(egg number experimentally detected)] \u00d7 100. To ensure the procedure in use harvests reliable and reproducible estimates, the flotation time \\(i.e. the interval between loading the McMaster chamber and counting the oocysts/eggs) in the well-mixed oocyst/egg saturated NaCl suspension is 5 min at room temperature. In order to obtain accurate oocyst numbers using McMaster chamber22,23, several counts from different samples are performed.\n**Viability assay**\n_Eimerian oocyst sporulation_For sporulation, the freshly purified oocysts were transferred into 2.5 % potassium dichromate solution \\(w/v, aqueous) in Erlenmeyer flasks covered with a perforated lid on a rotary shaker at 26 \u00b0C and 80 % relative humidity for approximately 72 h20. Sporulation was confirmed by examining a drop from each aliquot under the microscope. The examined oocysts were considered to be sporulated when four sporocysts were apparently distinguishable in each oocyst. At least five hundred oocysts were checked in each aliquot, which was regarded as the satisfactory number for statistical analysis and the number of sporulated oocysts was recorded. The average viability rate \\(as a percentage of sporulation) was calculated by using the formula \\[\\(sporulated oocysts) / \\(total number of oocysts)] \u00d7 100.\n_Trichostronglyid egg hatching_\n    The extracted nematode eggs were washed on a 35 \u00b5m nylon filter with distilled water to remove fine debris and salt \\(cream separator machine) or sugar \\(modified sucrose gradient). The egg was adjusted to 500 eggs per well in 6-well cell culture plate containing distilled water. The plate was incubated for 7 days at room temperature to allow parasite development to the L3 larval-stage. The total number of L3 larvae was recorded. The average viability rate \\(as a percentage of hatching) was calculated by using the formula \\[\\(total number of L3 larvae) / \\(total number of eggs)] \u00d7 100.\n**Optical microscopic observation**\n   Optical microscopic observation was used for purity \\(qualitative) evaluation of oocyst and egg purification. More than 100 microscopic fields from different prepared slides of coccidian oocysts and nematode eggs were investigated before considering the oocysts, and eggs are pure without any faecal contaminants.\n**Statistical analysis**A two-tailed t-test using Instat software \\(Graphpad Software, San Diego, Calif) was employed to determine statistical difference between recovery and viability rates, and required time of oocysts and eggs harvested by cream separator method and modified sucrose gradient method. Statistical analysis \\(a two-tailed t-test) was carried out to determine the superiority of 1:12.5 faecal dilution ratio over other faecal dilution ratios. A P- value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAdministration of cuprizone, tamoxifen, and EdU\nTiming: 7\u00a0weeks\nIn this step, the Gli1 expressing cells are fate-mapped by intraperitoneal administration of Tamoxifen to Gli1CreERT2;Ai9 mice and demyelination is induced 1\u00a0week later by feeding 0.2% cuprizone diet for 5\u00a0weeks. In addition, the proliferating cells are labeled by intraperitoneal administration of EdU a day prior to euthanasia.\nInject 5\u00a0mg tamoxifen per day intraperitoneally on alternate days for 4 injections (total 20\u00a0mg/mouse).\nFill the 1\u00a0mL tuberculin syringe with Tamoxifen and wipe the tip of the filled syringe with a kimwipe, before attaching a 27G needle to the syringe.\nAdminister 250\u00a0\u03bcL/day (5\u00a0mg/day) of 20\u00a0mg/mL Tamoxifen by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection to each mouse, on alternate days, for a total of 4 i.p. injections.\nScruff the mouse and insert the needle into the lower left or right quadrant of the abdomen, perpendicular to the surface of the skin.\nAfter insertion, aspirate to check for the presence of fluid prior to injecting the drug.\nAlternate between the left and right side for i.p. injections.\nCritical: Ideally there should not be any fluid aspirate before injecting the drug. If a blood vessel is punctured by the needle, the aspirated fluid will be red blood and if the urinary bladder is punctured by the needle, the aspirated fluid will be clear or yellow urine. Injecting Tamoxifen into the bladder can lead to urinary tract inflammation and death if not treated promptly. In case fluid is aspirated, remove and discard the needle properly. Using a clean syringe, perform the i.p. injection again at a different site. If the bladder is punctured, watch for turbid white discharge from the urethra for about 2\u00a0days, which indicates a urinary tract infection.Note: The typical dose of Tamoxifen is 100\u00a0mg/kg live weight. However, we examined the recombination efficiency with i.p. injections of 1\u20136\u00a0mg/day tamoxifen on 4 alternate days and found that 20\u00a0mg Tamoxifen ensures recombination of the floxed allele in adult mice of C57bl/6 and swiss webster background strains with weights ranging from 20\u00a0g to 60 g, without any toxic effects on neural stem cells. We have also used this dosage in multiple CreER and floxed mouse lines.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nOne week after the last Tamoxifen injection, change the diet to 0.2% cuprizone pellets.\nTransfer the mice to a clean cage before starting cuprizone diet to prevent the mice from eating any leftover regular chow buried in the bedding.\nProvide the cuprizone diet and water ad libitum for 5\u00a0weeks.\nDiscard the pellets in the cage, every 2\u20133\u00a0days and replenish with fresh cuprizone pellets, since the drug degrades gradually with time.\nCritical: Feeding 3\u00a0g per mouse per day is sufficient to avoid discarding excessive amounts of food.\nAfter 5\u00a0weeks of cuprizone diet, change the diet to regular chow to allow for remyelination.\nNote: Analyze remyelination from 2\u201310\u00a0weeks after cessation of cuprizone diet.\nNote: Store the vacuum sealed bags of Cuprizone pellets at \u221220\u00b0C. Refrigerate the opened bag at 4\u00b0C, away from light and use within 4\u00a0weeks.\nAlternatives: Instead of the pellets, provide 0.2% Cuprizone diet in the powdered form by mixing 0.2\u00a0g of cuprizone with 99.8\u00a0g of powdered chow. For the healthy control mice, feed regular chow in the powdered form. Place the powdered diet in a feeding jar on the floor of the cage and change the diet every day to minimize consumption of food contaminated with urine and feces.\nAdminister EdU by i.p. injection, 24\u00a0h prior to euthanasia.Prepare working solution of EdU (2.5\u00a0mg/mL).\nAdminister 20\u00a0\u03bcL of 2.5\u00a0mg/mL working solution per gram body weight of mouse, or 50\u00a0mg/kg body weight, by a single i.p. injection following the precautions mentioned in step 1.\nIntracardiac perfusion and harvesting the brain\nTiming: 30\u00a0min per mouse\nIn this step, Gli1CreERT2;Ai9 mice are perfused by intracardiac administration of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) and their brains are cryopreserved by embedding in OCT.\nSet up the peristaltic pump.\nConnect the scalp vein set tubing to the outlet tube of the peristaltic pump.\nInsert one tube of the pump into a container with 1\u00d7 PBS (30\u00a0mL/mouse) and another tube into a container with 4% PFA solution (30\u00a0mL/mouse).\nAttach the tubing from the two containers to a 3-way stopcock.\nSet the pump speed at 8\u00a0mL/min and fill the main outlet line with 1\u00d7 PBS until there is a steady stream without bubbles from the needle.\nTurn off the peristaltic pump and turn the stopcock to allow the flow of 4% PFA.\nPump 4% PFA until the fluid has reached the stopcock but not entered the main line.\nTurn off the peristaltic pump and turn the stopcock to allow the flow of 1\u00d7 PBS.\nAnesthetize the mouse.\nAdminister 120\u00a0mg/kg of Fatal Plus (390\u00a0mg/mL Pentobarbitol sodium), via i.p. injection using a tuberculin syringe with 27G needle.\nCritical: Fatal-Plus is a controlled substance.

Each aliquot of matrix can coat two 6-well plates.\nIncubate the coated plates at room temperature for at least 1 hr.\n\t\tNote: In our experience, coated dishes sealed with paraffin can be stored in matrix solution at 4 \u00b0C for up to 10 days before use.\nAt approximately 75% confluence, dissociate the H7 hESCs from the 10 cm dish using 6 ml of the non-enzymatic dissociation reagent. After 5 min, gently scrape the cells from the culture surface using a disposable cell scraper and transfer the cell suspension to a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube.\nRemove 0.5 ml of the dissociation solution with the cells from the 15 ml tube and transfer to a new sterile 15 ml tube (leaving 5.5 ml of the dissociation reagent to further dissociate the hESCs) for stem cell line propagation.Pellet the 0.5 ml of cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. Remove the supernatant and gently resuspend in 8 ml of pluripotent stem cell media containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin then transfer to a new, coated, 10 cm tissue culture dish and maintain 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 to maintain the stem cell line.\n\t\tNote: Keep pluripotent stem cell media on ice during media changes.\nMeanwhile, add 5.5 \u00b5l of 10 mM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to the remaining 5.5 ml of dissociation solution and continue to incubate at room temperature for another 5-10 min. Gently mix the cells with a 5 ml serological pipet. Continue to incubate until a single cell suspension is achieved, then pellet the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the cells in 5 ml of pluripotent stem cell media and perform a cell count using a hemocytometer.\nSeed each well of the 6-well dish at a density of 140,000 cells per well. Seed two 6-well plates to create a total of six defined tissues. Dispose of any remaining cells after plating.\nFill the well to 1 ml with pluripotent stem cell media and incubate at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours later, remove the media and add 2 ml of fresh pluripotent stem cell media to each well (Figure 1A).\nCheck the confluence of the plates each day and begin the differentiation once the cells reach approximately 75% confluence (Figure 1B-D).\n2. (Day 4-24) Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells to Cardiomyocytes30,31\n(Day 4-7, Differentiation Day 0-3) Mesoderm InductionPrepare RPMI differentiation media I (Table 1) by combining 500 ml RPMI 1640 with 10 ml B27 supplement (without insulin) and 5 ml of penicillin-streptomycin stock solution (10,000 IU/ml penicillin; 10,000 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin). Aliquot, on ice, into 50 ml tubes and store at 4 \u00b0C.\n(Day 4, Differentiation Day 0) Prepare mesoderm induction media by adding 2.4 \u00b5l of the small molecule GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 (10 mM stock, 6 \u00b5M final concentration) to 12 ml of RPMI differentiation media I. Remove pluripotent stem cell media from each well and replace with 2 ml of the mesoderm induction media per well. Return the plate to the incubator.\n\t\tNote: Significant cell death typically occurs with the addition of CHIR99021 (Figure 1E). The monolayer will recover, but it is important to rinse the dead cells away with the DMEM/F12 rinse.\n(Day 5, Differentiation Day 1) Prepare fresh mesoderm induction media as described above. Remove the old media from each well and rinse once with 1 ml of DMEM/F12 per well. Add 2 ml of fresh mesoderm induction media to each well.\n\t\tNote: Rinsing each day from Day 0-10 greatly increases yield and purity of the cardiac myocytes.\n(Day 6, Differentiation Day 2) Remove the cardiac induction media and rinse once with 1 ml DMEM/F12 per well. Replace the rinse with 2 ml RPMI differentiation media I (no small molecules added but still with the B27 (without insulin) supplement) and return to the incubator.\n(Day 7-13, Differentiation Day 3-10) Cardiac Mesoderm Induction\n\t\n(Day 7, Differentiation Day 3) Prepare cardiac mesoderm induction media by adding 6 \u00b5l of the small molecule Wnt inhibitor IWR-1 (10 mM stock, 5 \u00b5M final) to 12 ml of RPMI differentiation media I.Remove the media from each well, rinse once with 1 ml DMEM/F12 per well and replace with 2 ml of cardiac mesoderm induction media per well.\n(Day 8, Differentiation Day 4) Prepare an additional 12 ml of cardiac mesoderm induction media as described above. Remove the media added the day prior, rinse once with 1 ml DMEM/F12 per well and replace with 2 ml of fresh cardiac mesoderm differentiation media per well and return to the incubator.\n(Day 9-10, Differentiation Day 5-6) On both days, remove the cardiac mesoderm induction media and rinse each well with 1 ml of DMEM/F12.\nAdd 2 ml of fresh RPMI differentiation media I (no small molecules added but still with the B27 (without insulin) supplement) to each well and return the plate to the incubator.\n(Day 11-24, Differentiation Day 7-20) hES-derived Cardiac Myocyte Organization/Maturation\n\t\nPrepare the RPMI differentiation media II (Table 1) by combining 500 ml RPMI 1640 with 10 ml B27 supplement (with insulin) and 5 ml of penicillin-streptomycin stock solution. Aliquot, on ice, into 50 ml tubes and store at 4 \u00b0C.\n(Day 11, Differentiation Day 7) Remove RPMI differentiation media (without insulin) from each well and rinse with 1 ml DMEM/F12. Replace with 2 ml of the new RPMI differentiation media II (with insulin) to each well and return to the incubator.\n\t\tNote: Spontaneous beating should first be observed between days 7 and 10. If beating is not observed during this time, it typically indicates poor differentiation efficiency. The protocol can be continued until day 15 in an effort to observe beating, but if no beating is observed by day 15 it is best to start a new differentiation.(Day 12-24, Differentiation Day 8-20) Every day, remove the old differentiation media and replace with 2 ml of fresh RPMI differentiation media II per well to permit cell maturation and organization of the beating monolayer (Figure 1F, Video Figure 1).\n\t\tNote: Depending on the residual cell death, it may be necessary to rinse with 1 ml of DMEM/F12 through differentiation day 10.\n3. (Day 24, Differentiation Day 20) Isolation of Cardiac Myocytes and Fibroblast-like Cells\nDissociate Cells from the Monolayer\n\t\nRemove differentiation media and rinse once with 1 ml PBS.\nDissociate the monolayers with 1 ml of the enzymatic dissociation solution (0.04% Trypsin/0.03% EDTA) to each well.\nMove plate into incubator for 10 min. Meanwhile, add 12 \u00b5l of ROCK inhibitor to 6 ml of trypsin neutralization solution.\nGently add 1 ml of the trypsin neutralization solution containing the ROCK inhibitor to each well of the plate to neutralize the trypsin solution.\nUsing a sterile transfer pipet, gently mix each well to break apart the cell clusters.\nTransfer all 12 ml from the 6-well plate to a 15 ml centrifuge tube.\n\t\tNote: Since two 6-well plates are used in this protocol, two 15-ml tubes will be needed.\nTransfer 3 ml of PBS to one well of the plate, and then sequentially transfer the same 3 ml to each subsequent well to collect any residual cells on the dish. Transfer the remaining 3 ml from the final well into the same 15 ml centrifuge tube containing the cells.\nPellet at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.\nPrepare Cells for Live Cell Sorting by FACS\n\t\nPrepare the staining buffer by adding 5 ml of Fetal Bovine Serum to 45 ml of PBS on ice with 50 \u00b5l of ROCK inhibitor.Remove the supernatant from the cell pellet (in 3.1.8) and resuspend in 1.2 ml of staining buffer.\nTransfer 200 \u00b5l of the cell suspension to a new, pre-chilled, 50 ml centrifuge tube on ice. This will be the negative staining control.\nTransfer the remaining 1 ml of cell suspension to a new, pre-chilled, 50 ml centrifuge tube on ice and add 2 \u00b5l SIRP\u03b1-PE/Cy7 (1:500 dilution) and 4 \u00b5l of CD90-FITC (1:250 dilution). Gently mix the cell suspension with a transfer pipet and return to the ice.\nIncubate both the negative control and sample, on a rocker shaker, on ice, at 4 \u00b0C for 1 hr.\nPrepare sample collection tubes by adding 3 ml of RPMI media (with insulin) to two 15 ml centrifuge tubes. Add 3 \u00b5l of ROCK inhibitor to each tube and store on ice.\nPellet the stained cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C and rinse twice with at least 10 ml of ice-cold PBS per rinse.\nAdd 1 \u00b5l of DAPI (1 \u00b5g/ml) to 5 ml of staining buffer. Gently resuspend the sample pellet with 1-3 ml of the DAPI-containing staining buffer using a transfer pipet.\nAdd 500 \u00b5l of staining buffer (with no DAPI added) to the negative control.\nGently filter both the negative control and sample through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer to remove clumps of cells and transfer to polystyrene FACS tubes on ice. Immediately bring samples to the cell sorter.\nSimilar to established live cell sorting methods18, use the negative control to set the gates, select for live cells (DAPI negative) and collect both the FITC+ (i.e., CD90+ fibroblasts) and PE/Cy7+ (i.e., SIRP\u03b1+ cardiomyocytes) populations independently at 20 psi (Figure 2).Note: After setting the gates, the negative control can be fixed in 4% PFA to determine differentiation efficiency by staining for cardiac troponin-T.\n\t\tNote: Some researchers prefer to use an isotype control rather than unstained control to set the gates in order to compensate for non-specific antibody binding. A so-called fluorescence minus one (FMO) control is another possibility. Due to the clear bimodal distribution of the FITC, DAPI and PE-Cy7 signals, we gated from the positive population, conservatively aiming far into the positive gate, which possibly excludes some true positives but helps to minimize any false positives.\nCell Reaggregation in Preparation for Tissue Engineering\n\t\nAfter the cell sort, pellet both collection tubes and resuspend in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% Neonatal Bovine Serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 0.2% Amphotericin B (\u201cNBS media\u201d).\nRecombine the SIRP\u03b1+ and CD90+ cells in a 3:1 ratio and plate the combined cells in a non-tissue culture treated petri dish at a density of 2 million cells per 60 cm2 (10 cm dish). Add 10 ml of NBS media and 10 \u00b5l of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.\nPlace cell suspension in the tissue culture incubator for 48 hours to allow cell reaggregation into small clusters.\n4.

The purpose of the frame is to hold the PDMS posts (constructed from the cast made above) in alignment with the wells in the baseplate.Using a 1-mm endmill, machine 6 wells (6 x 1 x 1 mm3), 4 mm apart into a 20 x 40 x 5 mm3 piece of black polytetrafluoroethylene to form the baseplate.\nMix the elastomeric base and curing agent for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in a 10:1 w/w ratio and add to the custom polytetrafluoroethylene mold (step 4.1.1) to create two rows of six force-sensing posts, and incubate overnight and under vacuum at 80 \u00b0C. After curing, gently remove the PDMS from the master mold and carefully mark the tops of each post with a black permanent marker for enhanced contrast and automated real-time post deflection tracking.\n\t\tNote: Polytetrafluorethylene is fairly soft and can be damaged easily. Use care when cleaning the master mold prior to PDMS casting to ensure longevity of the system and consistent PDMS post geometry. A 0.5 mm wire can be used to clean the holes for the posts after each use, but take care to not scrape the inside of the holes.\n\t\tNote: An alternative is to degas the PDMS under vacuum for several hours at room temperature, then let the mixture cure at ambient pressure. This may lead to fewer residual gas bubbles forming in the PDMS during the curing process.\nSterilize all Components in a Steam Autoclave.\n\t\tNote: The PDMS master mold (step 4.1.1) and polysulfone frame (step 4.1.2) are both reusable. The PDMS posts created from the cast (step 4.1.4) is also reusable but only for approximately 10 uses. However, more PDMS posts can be created as needed using the master mold.\nCollect Reaggregated Cardiac Cells\n\t\nRemove the reaggregated cells from the incubator and transfer all 10 ml of the reaggregation media to a 50 ml centrifuge tube.Rinse the plate with 3 ml of PBS and transfer the rinse to the same 50 ml centrifuge tube containing the reaggregation media.\nAdd 3 ml of 0.04% Trypsin/0.03% EDTA to the 10 cm dish and return to the incubator for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, examine the plate with an inverted compound microscope at 10X magnification to ensure complete cell dissociation from the dish. If some residual clusters are still attached, gently agitate the plate to detach the clumps. If the clusters remain attached, return to the incubator for another 2-3 min. Do not incubate longer than ten minutes or significant cell death may occur.\nOnce all cells are detached, add 3 ml of trypsin neutralization solution. Gently mix the neutralization solution with the trypsin-cell solution and transfer to the 50 ml centrifuge tube containing the reaggregation media and rinse once with PBS.\nRinse the entire dish with 5 ml of PBS and transfer to the same 50 ml tube containing the cells.\nPellet the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of NBS media, then transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nPellet at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant. The cardiac cells (CD90+ stromal cells and SIRP\u03b1+ myocytes) are now ready for tissue construction.\n(Optional) Collect Supplemental Cells of Interest\n\tNote: In addition to the defined tissues containing only SIRP\u03b1+ cardiomyocytes and CD90+ fibroblast-like cells, it is possible to add additional cells of interest to interrogate their effect on tissue function. For example rat MSCs have been shown to enhance the function of rat engineered cardiac tissues1. The following optional step describes the collection of supplemental cells for the defined system.Collect the supplemental cell type of interest (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells) using 0.25% trypsin/0.1% EDTA.\nPellet the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature then resuspend in 5 ml of appropriate cell culture media for the cell type of interest. For instance, for MSCs, use DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 0.2% amphotericin-B to culture the cells.\nPerform a cell count using a hemocytometer, then pellet the cells again at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend in 1 ml of cell culture media and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant. The supplemental cells are now ready for tissue construction.\n\t\tNote: if the supplemental cells are added at a concentration of 10% of the total cell number in the tissue, then for the defined tissues, this will require 50,000 supplemental cells per tissue as each tissue contains 500,000 cardiac cells (both CD90+ stromal cells and SIRP\u03b1+ myocytes).\nCreate the Human Engineered Cardiac Tissues\n\tNote: Store all solutions on ice and the cells at room temperature. All volumes listed below are per tissue. Typically, approximately six tissues can be constructed from two 6-well plates of cardiac differentiations.\n\t\nDilute 60.0 \u00b5l of the 5 mg/ml collagen stock to 3.125 mg/ml with 1.5 \u00b5l of 1 M NaOH, 9.6 \u00b5l of 10x PBS and 24.9 \u00b5l of sterile ultrapure deionized water.\n\t\tCritical step: Avoid the introduction of air bubbles to each solution during preparation as air bubbles will disrupt proper tissue formation.Add 12.0 \u00b5l of both 10x MEM and 0.2 N HEPES pH 9 to the dilute collagen mixture to create the collagen mix. Add both solutions down the side of the 15 ml centrifuge tube in order to avoid the introduction of air bubbles into the collagen mix.\nAdd the basement membrane matrix to a final concentration of 0.9 mg/ml to the collagen mix and store on ice to create the final tissue mix. The final concentration of collagen should be 2 mg/ml.\nAdd 500,000 of the reaggregated cells to the tissue mix (myocyte + fibroblast concentration is 20 million/ml) and fill to a final volume of 25 \u00b5l per tissue with either cell-free NBS media or 50,000 cells of the supplemental cell type of interest (e.g., hMSCs) and mix well to form an even cell suspension.\n\t\tNote: The number of supplemented cells will vary from for different applications. Here 10% supplementation is used.\nWith care, pipet 25 \u00b5l of the cell suspension into each of the six wells in the bioreactor baseplate, without introducing air bubbles into the well.\nPush two rows of the PDMS force sensors onto either side of the polysulfone frame, forming 6 pairs of opposing posts, then invert the frame on top of the baseplate so that one pair of posts enters each well containing the cell suspension.\n\t\tNote: The polysulfone frame includes tabs to aid in alignment of the PDMS.\nCarefully place the bioreactor, baseplate down, into a 60 mm dish, then place the dish without its cover inside of a 10 cm dish, place the 10 cm cover on top, and move the entire bioreactor assembly into the tissue culture incubator, waiting two hours for the tissue to gel.After 2 hr, remove the bioreactor from the incubator and add 14 ml of NBS media to the entire assembly, enough to cover the baseplate. Return to the incubator, and change half of the media every day.\nForty-eight hr later, carefully remove the baseplate by gently moving each side of the baseplate off the frame a few millimeters at a time, change the media, then return the bioreactor, tissues facing down, to the media.\nContinue changing half of the NBS culture media every day.\n\t\tNote: Spontaneous contractions of the tissue can be observed as early as 3 days after tissue construction, generating measureable twitch forces as early as day 5 to 7.\nSubscription Required.

Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "**Protocols and procedures for surgery and imaging:**\nThe following protocols for &#x201C;open-skull&#x201D; and &#x201C;thinned-skull&#x201D; surgery are similar to those described previously \\(1-6).\n**Thinned-skull preparation:**\n1. Anesthetize transgenic mice by intraperitoneal injection \\(0.2 ml/20 g body weight) of 20 mg/ml Ketamine and 3 mg/ml Xylazine in 0.9% NaCl.\n  2. Thoroughly shave the hair over most of the scalp with a conventional razor blade.      Perform a midline scalp incision using microsurgical tools. Incision should extend     approximately from the neck region to the frontal area.  The brain area to be imaged can be localized based on stereotactic coordinates \\(7).\n  3. Remove soft tissue attached to the skull over the area to be imaged with fine forceps. High-speed micro-drill is used to thin a circular area of skull \\(typically ~1 mm in diameter) over the region of interest under a dissection microscope. Drilling should be done intermittently and the drill bit can be immersed periodically in cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid \\(ACSF) solution to minimize heat induced tissue injury. \n  4. The mouse skull consists of two thin layers of compact bone, sandwiching a thick layer of spongy tissue. This spongy bone contains tiny cavities arranged in concentric circles and multiple canaliculi that carry blood vessels. After removing the external compact bone, the middle layer of spongy bone is carefully thinned to about 75% of its original thickness. Some bleeding from the blood vessels running through the canaliculi may occur during the thinning process.  This bleeding will usually stop spontaneously.  \n  5. After removing the majority of the spongy bone, concentric cavities within the bone can usually be seen under the dissecting microscope, indicating the drill is close to the internal compact bone layer.  At this stage, skull thickness should be more than 50 &#xB5;m and the edge of the thinned region is thicker.6. The mouse skull is then immobilized by gluing it to a metal plate made by gluing 3 razor blades together. Place a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue around the edges of the internal opening of the blade and press the blade against the skull leaving the area to be imaged uncovered and surrounded by the internal blade opening. Pay special attention to avoid contamination with glue of the thin skull area.\n  7. Wait 10&#x2013;15 minutes until the metal plate is firmly glued to the skull and place the mouse face down with the blades supported by the acrylic blocks. Tighten up the screws to completely immobilize the blades. Wash the area to be imaged extensively with ACSF to remove remnants of non-polymerized glue.  We have observed that the microscope objectives retain trace amounts of glue remnants if the preparation is not washed thoroughly.  We recommend keeping the objectives immersed in water after imaging and cleaning them periodically with 100% ethanol.\n  8. After the immobilization of the mouse skull, a microsurgical blade \\(Surgistar, Cat# 38-6961) is used to continue thinning a smaller area \\( <sub>200 &#xB5;m in diameter) to </sub>20 &#xB5;m in thickness. The bone is shaved by using the blade at <sub>45 degree angle, taking great precaution not to push the skull downwards against the brain surface or to break through the bone, as minor brain trauma or bleeding may potentially cause inflammation and disruption of neuronal structures. The thinning continues until a very thin \\( </sub>20 &#xB5;m) and smooth preparation \\( ~200 &#xB5;m in diameter) is achieved.  The optimal degree of skull thinning is ultimately determined by looking at the preparation with a conventional fluorescence microscope. Dendrites and spines in the area of interest should be clearly visualized at this stage.\n  \n**Open-skull preparation:**1. Anesthetize transgenic mice and shave the hair over most of the scalp according to steps 1&#x2013;2 as described in thinned-skull preparation.\n  2. Administer dexamethasone \\(0.02 ml at 4 mg/ml) by intramuscular injection and remove soft tissue attached to the skull over the area to be imaged with fine forceps. \n  3. Use a high-speed micro-drill \\(1/4 bit, Fine Science Tools) to thin a circumference of a 5 x 5 mm region of the skull over the region of interest under a dissection microscope. Drilling should be done intermittently and the drill bit can be immersed periodically in cold ACSF solution to minimize heat induced tissue injury. \n  4. Take great caution to lift up the island of bone within the drilled circle with a pair of sharp forceps. Immediately after removing 5 x 5 mm region of the skull, bleeding above dura may occur in 2&#x2013;3 locations as such tiny bleeding is presumably from small blood vessels attached to the removed skull.  But such bleeding should stop spontaneously within 10&#x2013;20 seconds. Rinse the cortex with room temperature ACSF once or twice if necessary. At this step, make sure there is absolutely no bleeding under the dura.   \n  5. Cover the clear dura with a thin layer of low-melting-point agarose \\(Sigma) \\(1.2% in ACSF). Make sure that 1.2% freshly-made agarose is cool than 37 &#xB0;C before applying it to the cortex. \n  6. A custom-made circular coverslip \\(5&#x2013;7 mm diameter, No. 1 thickness) is gently lowered to cover the open-skull region. Take great caution not to push the cortex underneath and remove any excess agarose with sterile cotton applicators.7. Seal the edge of the optical window to the skull with a thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue and then with dental acrylic.  The dental acrylic will also cover all the exposed areas of skull.  A small custom-made steel bar will be embedded into the acrylic to stabilize the animal during subsequent imaging.\n  8. Allow the mice to recover 7&#x2013;14 days before chronic imaging starts. \n  \n**Mapping the imaging area for future relocation:**\nIn order to identify the same imaged area at a later time point, a high quality picture of the meningeal blood vessels is first obtained as landmark for relocation.   This can be done with a CCD camera attached to a stereo dissecting microscope.  Subsequently, the mouse is placed under an epi-fluorescence microscope and a specific area is selected for two-photon imaging. The selected area is then carefully identified in the CCD camera map by observing on the epi-fluorescence microscope the pattern of brain vasculature adjacent to it and then marking it on the map.  \n    \n**Two-photon imaging of neuronal structures.**\n1. Tune the TPM to the appropriate wavelength \\(e.g. 920 nm for YFP). Imaging is done by using a 60x water-immersion objective \\(Olympus, N.A. 0.9). ACSF should be used at all times during imaging for objective immersion.\n  2. Obtain a stack of fluorescently labeled neuronal processes at a digital zoom of 1x. These low magnification images are useful as a more precise map for relocation of the same area at a later time point in conjunction with the CCD camera picture of meningeal blood vessels.3. Without changing the position of the stage, take a zoomed image of the same area \\(e.g. 3x zoom). The stack depth is typically 100 &#xB5;m below the pial surface.  Additional zoomed images can be taken around the central image by electronically moving the imaging position 360&#xBA; around the initial imaged area. We typically use laser intensities in the range of 10 to 20 milliwatts \\(measured at the sample) to minimize phototoxicity \\(8). So far, our studies have limited to spines within the first 100 &#x3BC;m from the pial surface.  It is worth to point out that we found that the open-skull window is somewhat better for imaging structures &gt; 200 &#x3BC;m deeper under the pial surface than the thinned-skull window. Presumably this is because the coverglass and thinned-skull induce different degrees of spherical aberration and spherical aberration has a larger effect on imaging of deeper tissues.  \n  4. Following imaging, the head immobilization device is gently detached from the skull with thinned-skull preparations.  The scalp is sutured with 6-0 silk \\(LOOK, Reading, PA) and the mouse is kept in a separate cage until fully awake then put back in the original cage until the next viewing.  For open skull preparations, simply dismount the steel bar from a fixing post. \n  5. Image stacks can be viewed and analyzed with ImageJ software obtained from the NIH.", "1. Construction of the Magnetic Devices\nNOTE: The devices used for cell seeding vary depending on the application (Figure 1). To form aggregates, the number of cells is limited to 2.5\u00d7105/aggregate, so the magnetic tips must be very thin (750 \u00b5m in diameter). To seed the 1.8 cm2/7 mm-thick scaffolds, the magnets must be larger (3 mm in diameter) and will ensure cell migration through the pores of the scaffold.\nConstruction of a device with micro-magnets for aggregate formation (Figure 1A)\n\t\nMake micro-holes with a 0.8-mm drill through aluminum plates (3 cm in diameter and 6 mm thick).\nInsert a magnetic tip (750 \u00b5m in diameter) into each hole of the plate.\nPlace this disk over a permanent neodymium magnet, which ensures magnetization to saturation.\nConstruction of a device for scaffold seeding (Figure 1B)\n\t\nCut hard polystyrene into 2.4 cm2 squares.\nInsert 9 small magnets (3 mm in diameter, 6 mm long) at an equal distance over a surface area of 1.6 cm2.\nPlace this device over a permanent neodymium magnet.\n2. Stem Cell Labeling\nNOTE: Stem cells were labeled with 0.1 mM magnetic nanoparticles for 30 min (2.6 \u00b1 0.2 pg iron/cell) to form aggregates, while they were labeled with 0.2 mM magnetic nanoparticles for 30 min (5 \u00b1 0.4 pg iron/cell) to seed scaffolds. These nanoparticle concentrations and incubation times have been used previously and published for MSC and other cells18,19, and it has been determined that nanoparticles impacted neither cell viability nor MSC differentiation capacity. The iron mass incorporated by the stem cells was measured via single-cell magnetophoresis19,20.\nCulture human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in complete mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (MSCGM) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 until near to confluence (~90%).Prepare the magnetic labeling solution by mixing 0.1 or 0.2 mM maghemite citrate-coated iron oxide (\u03b3Fe2O3; core: 8 nm diameter) in serum-free McCoy's 5A medium modified at Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RMPI) without glutamine and containing 5 mM sodium citrate.\nDiscard the medium, rinse the cells with serum-free RPMI medium without glutamine, and add 10 mL of iron oxide nanoparticle solution per 150-cm2 culture flask, the minimum volume required to cover all the cells.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 and then discard the nanoparticle solution. Rinse for 5 min with serum-free RPMI medium without glutamine to internalize the nanoparticles still attached to the plasma membrane.\nDiscard the RPMI medium and add 25 mL of complete MSCGM medium per flask. Incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\n3. Magnetic Cell Seeding\nFreshly prepare the chondrogenic medium using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high glucose with L-glutamine by adding 50 \u00b5M L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 0.1 \u00b5M dexamethasone, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.35 mM L-proline, 1% universal culture supplement containing insulin, human transferrin and selenous acid (ITS-Premix), and 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-\u03b23).\nDetach the magnetic cells using 8 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA per 150-cm2 culture flask and centrifuge the dissociated cells at 260 \u00d7 g for 5 min. Aspirate the medium and count the re-suspended cells.\nPlace a glass-bottomed cell culture Petri dish (35 mm) on top of both magnetic devices.To magnetically form aggregates, add 3 mL of chondrogenic medium to the Petri dish and gently deposit the smallest volume possible (no more than 8 \u00b5L) containing 2.5\u00d7105 labeled cells per aggregate (up to 16 aggregates can be deposited). Leave the Petri dish for 20-30 min without moving it, allowing it to form spheroids, and then place the complete device, including the Petri dish containing the 16 aggregates, into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\nForm control aggregates following the same protocol and replace the complete medium with chondrogenic medium without TGF-\u03b23.\n\t\nTo generate the 3D aggregate construct, place 2 aggregates in contact on day 8 to form 8 doublets and initiate the fusion. On day 11, merge 2 doublets to form 4 quadruplets. Finally, fuse the 4 quadruplets on day 15 to obtain the final structure.\nAt the same time, form aggregates by centrifuging 2.5\u00d7105 labeled stem cells at 260 \u00d7 g for 5 min in 15-mL tubes with 1.5 mL of chondrogenic medium with or without TGF-\u03b23 (for sample and control, respectively).\nTo magnetically seed scaffolds, place each dried scaffold into a Petri dish. Use polysaccharide porous scaffolds made of pullulan/dextran21. For each scaffold, dilute 2\u00d7106 labeled stem cells in 350 \u00b5L of chondrogenic medium without TGF-\u03b23 and carefully pipette the cells onto the scaffold.\n\t\nIncubate for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C to allow for full cell penetration within the scaffold and then gently add 3 mL of chondrogenic medium with or without TGF-\u03b23 (for sample or control, respectively) to the Petri dish.\nIncubate the cellularized scaffold on its magnetic device at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 4 days to allow for cell migration through the scaffold pores and confinement.At the same time, seed scaffolds with 2\u00d7106 labeled stem cells following the same method and incubate without the magnet to obtain uniformly seeded scaffolds as positive controls.\n4. Differentiation into Chondrocytes\nNOTE: After 4 days of incubation, remove the magnets and continue the chondrogenic maturation either in a Petri dish (static conditions) or in a bioreactor (dynamic conditions). Negative control samples are matured in static conditions with chondrogenic medium without TGF-\u03b23.\nIn static conditions, keep the cellularized scaffolds or aggregates in the same Petri dish. Change the chondrogenic medium twice a week for 21 days.\nIn dynamic conditions, prepare the bioreactor.\n\t\nCut silicone tubing at the appropriate length according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nAutoclave all materials: 500-mL culture chamber, tubing, 2-way rotators, and cages.\nPlace the bioreactor parts into a sterile microbiological safety station. Connect the tubing to the 2-way rotators and to the culture chamber following the manufacturer's instructions.\nCarefully transfer the cellularized scaffolds into sterilized cages using a sterile spatula. Place 2 scaffolds per cage. When the cages are ready, insert them into the needles of the lid to keep them from moving during further rotation. Fill the culture chamber with chondrogenic medium and close it with the lid containing the cages.\nTurn on the peristaltic pump to fill the tubing with chondrogenic medium and to eliminate air bubbles.\nPlace and secure the filled chamber into the motor of the bioreactor and turn on the computer, which controls the rotations both of the arm and of the chamber.\nApply a rotation speed of 5 rotations per min (rpm) on both the arm and the chamber. Adjust the peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 10 rpm for continuous feeding of the cellularized scaffolds.\n5. RNA Extraction and Gene Expression AnalysisNOTE: Prior to RNA extraction, digest the scaffolds with an enzymatic solution.\nPrepare 1 mL of enzymatic solution by adding 100 \u00b5L of pullulanase (40 U/mL) and 50 \u00b5L of dextranase (60 mg/mL) to 850 mL of serum-free DMEM medium.\nRinse the scaffolds twice with serum-free DMEM medium, discard the medium, and add 800 \u00b5L of the enzymatic solution per scaffold. Incubate for 15-30 min at 37 \u00b0C under gentle agitation.\nWhen the scaffold is completely dissolved, transfer the solution containing the cells to a 1.5-mL tube, centrifuge at 300 \u00d7 g for 10 min, carefully aspirate the medium, rinse twice with sterile 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuge at 300 \u00d7 g for 10 min, and re-suspend the cells in the RNA isolation solution.\nTo extract the RNA from the aggregates, place the spheroids in the RNA isolation solution and completely crush them using a homogenizer before performing RNA extraction.\nIsolate the RNA using a kit for total RNA extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nSynthesize complementary DNA from 400 ng of total RNA using reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 250-ng random primers, 1 \u00b5L of dNTP mix (10 mM each), and 40 U/mL RNase inhibitor; the final volume of reaction is 20 \u00b5L.

LNT network characterization\nTransfer the flow chamber to an inverted microscope for imaging.\nChoose the appropriate filter set based on the wavelengths of the fluorescent lipids or tubulin used.

LNTs much smaller than GUVs and have weaker fluorescence signals. Thus, the exposure and contrast must be adjusted accordingly to image LNTs. These adjustments also lead to overexposure of the GUVs, and thus, it is recommended that the lamellarity and phase separation in GUVs be characterized independently.\nFocus the microscope on a network of interest and take a standard or tiled image.\nAdjust the exposure time and neutral density filters to image the LNTs and minimize saturated exposure of the GUVs. Acquire images both in red and green channels.\n\tNOTE: Here, the red channel permits visualization of the Texas-Red lipids, while the green channel permits visualization of the microtubules (e.g., Oregon Green lipids and HiLyte488 dyes).\nCreate a composite image by overlaying the red and green channels (Figure 1).\nCharacterization of LNT networks by measuring LNT length\n\t\nOpen the acquired images using an image analysis software such as ImageJ.\nCalibrate the scale for the microscope by using the set scale feature, fill in the pixels to the mm conversion factor, and click OK.\n\t\tNOTE: The conversion factor is dependent on the microscope, objective lens, and camera, and it can be obtained using a microscope calibration slide.

It is possible to use this protocol for isolation of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) from the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ).\nIn the protocol, two separate sets of surgical kit are required to prevent contamination from mouse tissue, hair or other sources. Surgery Kit A: To harvest the brain tissue from the adult mouse (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and Surgery Kit B: for further dissection of the required brain regions (dentate gyrus of the hippocampus or the subventricular zone tissue) (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/642-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Through coronal sections the brain is dissected while being placed on its dorsal surface. The black arrowhead points to the Optic chiasm (C), the regions between the white lines and blue lines represent the SVZ and DG isolation sections respectively (D).\n(F\u2013K) Steps of SVZ isolation.

The blue arrowheads show the isolated DG tissue (P-Q).\nNote: 1-mm thick sections were measured and used for isolation of both DG and SVZ. Moreover, the use of an angled forceps to fix/stabilize the brain sections during the isolation steps is preferred. Scale bars, 5\u00a0mm.\nCritical: Good handling and quick transition between the steps of the procedure is desired.\nEuthanize one adult (age 6\u201324\u00a0weeks) C57BL/6 mouse.\nSterilize the dissection area, surgery tools, and the head of the euthanized mouse with 70% ethanol.\nSurgically remove the brain and transfer it to a 50-mL tube with ice cold dissection buffer.\nUsing the Optic Chiasm as an anatomical landmark (\u22480\u00a0mm Bregma point) slice the brain into 1.0\u00a0mm coronal sections using a Mouse Brain Slicer Matrix at 0 -+1\u00a0mm Bregma and -1\u2013-2\u00a0mm Bregma for the SVZ and the hippocampal DG respectively.\nCollect the slices containing the hippocampus or the SVZ into a 10\u00a0cm petri dish filled with ice cold dissection buffer.\nUnder a microscope, quickly but carefully isolate the dentate gyrus or SVZ out of each relevant slice.Use a scalpel or a needle (26 or 27 G) to dissect the DG or SVZ while stabilizing the slice/section using angled forceps for easier and much accurate tissue isolation. Please refer to (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]) Then:\nImmediately transfer the dissected tissue into the cap of a 15-mL tube or another petri dish and mince it with a fine scissor.Once minced, attach the cap to its 15-mL tube with 10\u00a0mL ice cold dissection buffer and rotate slowly once to suspend the tissue chunks. Keep the tube on ice during further dissection.\nKeep adding the dissected and minced tissue to the same 15-mL tube.\nAfter finishing the dissection of all relevant brain sections, spin down the tissue at 200 g for 1\u00a0min at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C.\nIn a laminar flow cabinet aspirate the dissection buffer and add 1\u00a0mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to the 15-mL tube containing tissue chunks.\nIncubate at 37\u00b0C with slow mixing such as gentle rotation or light shaking in a water bath.\nAfter the 15-20\u00a0min, confirm adequate digestion by pipetting slowly up and down a few times with a p1000 pipet.\nIf the digestion is inadequate, continue digestion at 37\u00b0C for 5-15\u00a0min. However, do not exceed 30\u00a0min of digestion as this can severely affect viability of the cells and result in increased debris in the culture afterward.

Scale bars, 100\u00a0\u03bcm.\nCritical: Avoid generating excess air bubbles during the triturating and wash steps as this can affect cell viability.\nOptional: In the last wash step, it can be beneficial to pass the cells through a 100\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer to remove undigested tissue.\nAlternatives: Mice strains other than the C57BL/6 background can in principle be used. However, cell yield and viability might be affected. Thus, some method optimization for other mice strains might be required.\nPassage of aNSCs\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nThis step outlines how to passage isolated aNSCs. We recommend to culture the aNSCs in low adherence 6 well plates or 35\u00a0mm petri dishes. Neurospheres should be passaged at around a size of 50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) as described (Guo et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Liu et\u00a0al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Growing the neurospheres larger than 250\u00a0\u03bcm, could result in reduced growth rate (Mori et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) and inner core cell death due to lack of nutrients and oxygen.Carefully collect all neurospheres using a p1000 into a 15-mL tube and spin down at 200\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C.\nAspirate the media and add 1\u00a0mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for each well/dish.\nIncubate at 37\u00b0C with slow mixing for 1\u20132\u00a0min.\nAdd equal volume of Trypsin inhibitor and triturate into single cells (first using a p1000 then p200).\nAdd equal volume of growth media and spin down at 200g 5\u00a0min.\nAspirate and suspend the cells in growth media.\nCount cell number and viability.\nSeed cells at 1\u00d710\u02c65 cells/mL (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) into a low adherent 6-well plate (3\u00a0mL per plate) or low adherent 35mm petri dishes (2\u00a0mL per dish) and incubate the cells in a 5% CO2 37\u00b0C incubator.\nPassage the neurospheres every 2\u20134\u00a0days. Neurospheres should be around 50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter when passaging (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCritical: Larger formation of spheres should be avoided as cell loss, mainly of inner/core cells due to reduced access to nutrients and oxygen.\nFor general experimental usage, we recommend using the cells between passage 3 and 10.\nNote: During the initial first passages, small tissue debris or clumps of dead cells can remain present. Thus, when collecting the neurospheres, try to avoid disrupting such debris on the bottom of the well. Furthermore, most of the neurospheres tend to accumulate in the center of the well, so collecting from the center only can also reduce the amount of debris.\nNote: At times, instead of growing as neurospheres, some cultured aNSCs can start growing as adherent cells which can lead to differentiation and growth arrest. To avoid this, use low adherent cell plates for suspension culture.\nDifferentiation of aNSCs\nTiming: 7\u00a0days\nHere we outline a simple 5-day differentiation protocol for the aNSCs.Two days before seeding the cells for differentiation, coat flask/wells with 20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of Poly-L-ornithine solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 37\u00b0C.\nNext day, wash 3\u00d71\u00a0min with PBS and coat with 5mg/mL Laminin in PBS over night at 37\u00b0C.\nOn the day of cell seeding, wash flask/wells 3\u00d71\u00a0min with PBS. On the last wash, wait to aspirate PBS just before adding media/cells. Please refer to (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7])\nCollect neurospheres and triturate them into single cells as described for passaging.\nSeed aNSCs as appropriate for the cell flask/well (approximately 40000 cells per cm2, depending on downstream analysis) and keep the cells in a 5% CO2 37\u00b0C incubator.\nCritical: Please refer to the Limitations section under Seeding density part.\nThe next day, exchange half the media with freshly prepared differentiation media. Repeat this every day for the neuron/astrocyte differentiation media and every other day when using the OPC medium to differentiate the aNSCs into neurons/astrocytes and OPCs respectively. This should be continued for a total of 5\u00a0days for differentiation.Please refer to (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9])\nAfter 5\u00a0days, differentiated cells can be analyzed by quantitative methods such as qPCR, immunofluorescence-based assays, and flow cytometry.\nConfirming aNSCs identity\nTiming: 4\u00a0days\nIn this final step, we suggest simple immunofluorescence-based assays to confirm aNSCs identity before using the cells in experimental assays.\nConfirming presence of neural stem cell markers\nSeed aNSCs in Poly-L-ornithine/Laminin coated cell culture slides and incubate the cells for 12\u201316\u00a0hrs in a 5% CO2 37\u00b0C incubator.\nNext day, aspirate medium and wash 2\u00d71\u00a0min with ice-cold PBS.\nAdd ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 and incubate for 30\u00a0min at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C.\nWash 3\u00d75\u00a0min with PBS.Incubate fixed cells with 0.1% T\u00d7100 in PBS 15\u00a0min at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C , followed by 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01% T\u00d7100, in PBS for 30\u00a0min.\nIncubate fixed cells with neural stem cell marker antibodies such as anti-nestin (1:400) and anti Sox2 (1:400) in 3% BSA, 0.01% T\u00d7100, PBS for 2\u00a0h at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C or at 4\u00b0C for 12-16\u00a0hrs.\nWash 3\u00d75\u00a0min in PBS.\nIncubate fixed cells with secondary fluorescence conjugated antibody (1:800) in 3% BSA, 0.01% T\u00d7100, PBS for 1\u00a0h at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C in the dark.\nWash 1\u00d75\u00a0min in PBS\nIncubate cells with DAPI (1:2000) for 5\u00a0min.\nWash 2\u00d75\u00a0min in PBS and mount cell slides with coverslip.\nApproximately >90% of all cells should be positive for nestin and Sox2 (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C respectively).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/642-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03.

On the other hand, around 55%\u201365% of cells cultured in OPC media are positive for the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells marker Olig2 (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol provides detailed guidelines for performing genome editing of archaeal lytic viruses, exemplified here with the virus SIRV2. Essentially, the entire procedure relies on the construction of a genome editing plasmid, based on the shuttle vectors pGE1/pGE2. S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 carries one subtype I-A, one subtype I-D and two subtype III-B (Cmr-\u03b1 and Cmr-\u03b3) systems along with five CRISPR arrays. Arrays neighboring subtype I-A encompass repeat sequences (referred to as type I-A repeats) that are utilized by subtype I-A and subtype III-B (Cmr-\u03b1), the other three arrays encompass repeat sequences (referred to as type I-D repeats) utilized by subtype I-D and subtype III-B (Cmr-\u03b3) (Bhoobalan-Chitty et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Once transformed into S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 \u0394arrays, a fully assembled pGE1/pGE2 allows the endogenous type I and type III CRISPR-Cas systems of the host cell to be repurposed to perform genome editing of SIRV2 during infections.\nTwo variable DNA elements in pGE1/pGE2 make this genome editing possible:\nA spacer DNA element that promotes targeting of the original virus but not the mutant virus. This is made possible by the mini-CRISPR array harbored on the genome editing plasmid. Briefly, the spacer is inserted between two type I-A repeats (for pGE1) or two type I-D repeats (for pGE2) located downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), causing CRISPR RNA (crRNA) species to be produced. The crRNAs will in turn guide the endogenous CRISPR-Cas effector proteins towards the cognate protospacer in the original virus, leading to mostly fatal breaks in its DNA genome.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1031-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. The concepts of the CRISPR-Cas based genome editing of lytic archaeal virusesGenome editing of lytic archaeal viruses takes place during infection of a host cell that carries the appropriate genome editing plasmid (pGE1/pGE2). The genome editing plasmid harbors a mini-CRISPR array constituted by a single repeat-spacer-repeat unit located downstream from an arabinose-inducible promoter (ParaS). The resulting CRISPR RNA (crRNA) will help the endogenous CRISPR-Cas systems to recognize and cleave the protospacer of the infecting virus, as determined by the spacer sequence defined by the researcher. Some viruses will followingly repair their genomes through a double-crossover event with the donor DNA element present on pGE1/pGE2 (highlighted in gray), thus giving rise to a mutant virus that will not be targeted. This method has been used previously to delete the gene gp48 from SIRV2M (A) and to insert an affinity tag onto the C-terminus of gp48 (B). Primers are indicated above/below the regions of the virus genome to which they anneal.\nA donor DNA element, which represents the desired virus mutation. This mutant allele is flanked by regions perfectly homologous to the regions flanking the corresponding wild-type allele in the virus. This shared homology allows the donor DNA to be inserted into the viral genome via a double-crossover event (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), thus generating the mutant virus.\nThe result is that the original virus is eliminated while the mutant virus remains untargeted and is allowed to propagate.\nThroughout this protocol, we will occasionally help explain selected steps by giving examples from two previous works: the targeted deletion of gp48 from the genome of SIRV2M (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), and the insertion of an octahistidine (8xHis)-tag onto the C-terminus of gp48 in the genome of SIRV2M (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) (Bhoobalan-Chitty et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nConstruction of the genome editing plasmid\nDesign, assembly, and insertion of the spacer DNA element\nTiming: 4\u00a0daysWithin the region of interest in the virus genome, select a 39- to 45-bp protospacer (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) that fulfills the following criteria:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1031-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Design of the spacer DNA element and sequence features of pGE2\nThe region of interest in the virus genome (A, top) is screened for a non-redundant protospacer with a 5\u2032-end flanked by a 5\u2032-GTN-3\u2032 protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatible with the type I-D CRISPR-Cas systems of the host. Here, \u2018N\u2019 can assume any nucleotide. Based on the selected protospacer, the spacer DNA element is assembled from two ssDNA oligonucleotides with sequences complementary to each strand of the protospacer (A, bottom). Furthermore, each ssDNA oligonucleotide includes 3-nt 5\u2032-overhanging sequences, allowing the final spacer DNA element to be cloned in between the type subtype I-D repeats found in pGE2. The backbone of pGE2 (A, top) contains an ampicillin resistance marker (AmpR) and the pyrEF operon which allows for stable maintenance of pGE2 in E.\u00a0coli DH5\u03b1 and S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1, respectively. The multiple cloning site of pGE2 (A, bottom) consists of an insertion site for the donor DNA (between the PaeI and XhoI restriction sites) as well as a type I-D mini-CRISPR-array where the insertion site for the spacer is located (between the two oppositely oriented LguI sites). An arabinose promoter (ara-box), B recognition element (BRE), and TATA-box ensure that the mini-CRISPR-array is transcribed. Please note, the multiple cloning site shown here neither contains a spacer nor a donor DNA. TSS\u00a0= Transcriptional Start Site.\nThe protospacer should be absent or disrupted in the desired mutant virus.\nIdeally, the protospacer should be chosen from the template strand, as type III CRISPR-Cas systems can only recognize and bind transcript-RNA rather than DNA.The 5\u2032-end of the protospacer should be flanked by a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatible with the subtype I-A or subtype I-D CRISPR-Cas systems of S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1, i.e., 5\u2032-CCN-3\u2032 or 5\u2032-GTN-3\u2032, respectively (Gudbergsdottir et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Lin et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Here, \u2018N\u2019 can assume any nucleotide.\nTo create the spacer element, design and order a pair of single-stranded (ss)DNA oligos that are complementary to the two strands of the selected protospacer. The two ssDNA oligos should have 3-nucleotide (nt) 5\u2032-overhangs with sequences AAG/AGC or AAC/TAC to match the oppositely oriented LguI sites of pGE1 or pGE2, respectively (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAdd equal volumes of the two ssDNA oligos (10\u00a0\u03bcM stocks) to a microcentrifuge tube, mix by vortexing, and incubate at 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min in a heat block.\nOnce incubation is done, turn off the heat block and allow the mixture to cool down to RT gradually to promote the hybridization of the two ssDNA oligos.\nThe resulting double-stranded (ds)DNA spacer element will be 39\u00a0bp in length with 3-nt 5\u2032-overhangs that allows it to be inserted in pGE1 or pGE2. Store at \u221220\u00b0C until needed.\nNote: The backbones of pGE1 and pGE2 contain mini-CRISPR arrays made with type I-A repeats and type I-D repeats, respectively, but apart from this the two plasmids have identical sequences. For clarity, the map and sequence of the multiple cloning site (MCS) of pGE2 is shown in Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B. For the rest of the protocol, we will keep using pGE2 as an example.\nClone the dsDNA spacer element (from step 2) into a linearized (FD LguI) sample of pGE2 to construct a plasmid encoding a mini-CRISPR array expressing a spacer targeting the original SIRV2 genome (pGE2-Spcgp48).\nThe purified pGE2-Spcgp48 sample should be stored at \u221220\u00b0C until needed.Design, assembly, and insertion of the donor DNA element\nTiming: 6\u00a0days\nThe donor DNA element is assembled via fusion PCR by overlap extension (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). To do this, design and order two pairs of primers which will anneal to and amplify the regions of the virus genome located immediately up and downstream, respectively, from the target gene (deletions) and target site (modifications). The resulting amplicons are referred to as the left and right arm of the donor DNA. Each arm should be 200\u2013500\u00a0bp in length. Importantly, every primer used for donor DNA assembly should include a 5\u2032-overhang of a particular sequence:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1031-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Assembly of donor DNA elements via fusion PCR by overlap extension\nThe examples shown illustrate how the donor DNA elements were generated that promote (A) the deletion of gp48 and (B) the insertion of a histidine tag onto the C-terminus of gp48, as originally performed by (Bhoobalan-Chitty et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Here, the SIRV2 genome serves as template in the first round of PCRs [1], by which two DNA fragments are formed, denoted as the left and right arm of the donor DNA. Due to the specific sequences included in the 5\u2032-overhangs of the inner (fusion) primers, the left and right arms will contain overlapping sequences that allow the arms to hybridize when mixed [2]. In these hybrids, the strand from either arm can use the strand from the opposite arm as a template for extension in the second round of PCR [3], thus yielding a complete, double-stranded donor DNA. This is further amplified by the outer primers, which are also responsible for integrating restriction sites PaeI and XhoI in the ends of the donor DNA. PS\u00a0= protospacer.The two outer primers (e.g., gp48 Kn PaeI F and gp48 Kn XhoI R, as shown in Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) should include sequences for the restriction sites PaeI and XhoI in their 5\u2032-overhangs such that the donor DNA will have restriction sites matching those found in the MCS of pGE2 (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nThe two inner (fusion) primers should contain a shared sequence in their 5\u2032-overhangs, thus allowing the left and right arms of the donor DNA to overlap and fuse. The specific sequence of the 5\u2032-ends of these inner primers also determine the kind of mutation made:\nFor deletions (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), the 5\u2032-overhanging sequence of each inner primer should be identical to the sequence on the opposite side of the region intended for deletion.\nFor insertion of affinity tags (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), the genetic sequence encoding the tag should be included within the 5\u2032-overhanging sequences of both inner primers.\nSet up the first round of PCR reactions according to the tables below. To exemplify, we here describe how the arms for the donor DNA promoting the insertion of the 8xHis-tag on the C-terminus of gp48 (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) were made:\nTwo individual PCR mixtures, one for each arm of the donor DNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1031_19.csv\nThe PCR program is the same for either PCR:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1031_20.csv\nThe annealing temperature is equal to the salt-adjusted melting temperature of the primers, as calculated by OligoCalc (Link: OligoCalc: Oligonucleotide Properties Calculator (northwestern.edu[href=http://northwestern.edu])).\nVerify the length/purity of the left and right arm PCR fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nPurify the PCR fragments of the left and right arm with the GeneJET\u2122 PCR Purification Kit.\nSet up the second round of PCR according to the tables below:\nThe PCR mixture should contain both arms of the donor DNA at equal concentrations.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1031_21.csvaThe two outer primers should not be added to the reaction mixture until after the hold at 4\u00b0C.\nThe PCR program is split into two stages, the two outer primers are not added until the completion of the first stage. This is because the left and right arms of the donor DNA should first denature, mix, and reanneal, thus allowing for DNA polymerase extension from the exposed 3\u2032-ends of the overlapping sequences (as shown in Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1031_22.csv\nThe annealing temperature is equal to the salt-adjusted melting temperature of the primers/overlapping sequences, as calculated by OligoCalc (Link: OligoCalc: Oligonucleotide Properties Calculator (northwestern.edu[href=http://northwestern.edu])).\nAnalyze the fusion PCR fragment by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify that the left and right arms have fused together and made a full-length donor DNA element.\nPurify the donor DNA element with the GeneJET\u2122 PCR Purification Kit and digest the donor DNA element (FD PaeI/XhoI).\nClone the digested donor DNA element into the linearized (FD PaeI/XhoI) and dephosphorylated (Fast AP) sample of pGE2-Spcgp48, resulting in a plasmid carrying both the donor DNA and a spacer-harboring mini-CRISPR array (pSIRV2Mgp48his). We routinely used Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 for cloning work and for purifying plasmids at high yields. Plasmid preparations of high yield and purity are crucial for successful electroporation into S. islandicus LAL14/1.\nAs a final validation to mark the end of the cloning efforts, send a sample of the purified pSIRV2Mgp48his for sequencing at an external partner (e.g., Eurofins Genomics, Germany).\nThe purified pSIRV2Mgp48his should be stored at \u221220\u00b0C until needed.\nElectroporation of the genome editing plasmid\nTiming: 13\u201318\u00a0days\nThe electroporations should be performed with the Gene Pulser Xcell\u2122 electroporation system with parameters set to 1.5 kV, 600 \u03a9 and 25\u00a0\u03bcF (Deng et\u00a0al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Schleper et\u00a0al., 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).Note: Transforming plasmid DNA into S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 cells by electroporation is a difficult task that depends on the purity of the plasmid sample, the density of the competent cells, and the timing of each step in general.\nFor each constructed plasmid to be electroporated, prepare the following materials:\nCast a 0.7% gelrite/SCV plate.\nTransfer 5\u00a0mL 2\u00d7SCV medium and 5\u00a0mL 0.4% gelrite into separate glass tubes and preheat them in an incubator set to 78\u00b0C.\nTransfer 950\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 medium salts solution to a microcentrifuge tube and preheat it to 78\u00b0C on a heat block placed next to the Gene Pulser Xcell\u2122 electroporation system.\nUnpack the Gene Pulser/MicroPulser electroporation cuvettes (0.1\u00a0cm gap) and place them within reach on the same workbench as the Gene Pulser Xcell\u2122 electroporation system.\nFrom the \u221280\u00b0C freezer, take out the microcentrifuge tubes containing the 50-\u03bcL aliquots of electrocompetent S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 \u0394arrays cells (described in previous sections) and thaw the cells on ice for \u223c5\u00a0min.\nOnce thawed, transfer 1\u00a0\u03bcL of a purified plasmid sample (corresponding to 300\u2013500\u00a0ng of plasmid DNA) to the 50\u00a0\u03bcL aliquot of cells. Gently flick the microcentrifuge tube a few times to ensure proper mixing. As a negative control, make a mixture with milliQ-H2O instead of the plasmid.\nTransfer the mixture to a Gene Pulser/MicroPulser electroporation cuvette (0.1\u00a0cm gap), place the brown cap back on, and tap the cuvette on the desk a few times to thoroughly collect the mixture in the bottom of the gap. Place the loaded cuvette in the shockpod of the GenePulser Xcell\u2122 electroporation system.\nPulse the mixture and note the time of conductance.\nNote: Successful electroporations of plasmid DNA into S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 cells usually have a time of conductance around 9.6\u20139.8 milliseconds.Immediately after electroporation, rescue the cells by transferring \u2245 600\u00a0\u03bcL of the preheated medium salts solution to the cuvette, mix briefly by pipetting up and down, and then transfer the cells and the medium salts back into the microcentrifuge tube on the heat block, set to 78\u00b0C. Allow the cells to recover and incubate for 30\u00a0min.\n10\u00a0min before incubation is done, place the 0.7% gelrite/SCV plates (with their lids still on) in the 78\u00b0C incubator.\nAdd 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the electroporated cell suspension into the 5\u00a0mL of preheated 2\u00d7SCV medium, then add the 5\u00a0mL of preheated 0.4% gelrite, and swirl the tube thoroughly to ensure proper mixing. Gently distribute this mixture onto the preheated 0.7% gelrite/SCV plate.\nOnce the top layer has solidified (after approx. 30\u00a0min), stack the plates in sealed plastic bags and place them in an air-tight container. Incubate the plates for 7\u201310\u00a0days at 78\u00b0C.\nSingle colonies will have emerged on the plates (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). They appear as sparks of an irregular shape. Use a pipette to inoculate individual colonies into 15\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 medium salts solution and resuspend the cells by vigorous pipetting.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1031-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04.

Transformations performed with milliQ-H2O instead of plasmid (A, right panel) is a useful negative control to identify possible false positives. To obtain a decent amount of cells, the transformants are inoculated, resuspended, and spotted onto a new Gelrite/SCV plate followed by incubation for another 3\u20135\u00a0days at 78\u00b0C (B). Any spots showing growth (e.g., Col. 1) are tested for plasmid presence by PCR (C), using Seq-F and Seq-R primers that anneal to the backbone of pGE2. As negative control (\u2013), the PCR was performed with milliQ-H2O instead of cells.\nOnce resuspended, spot the cell suspension onto a fresh 0.7% gelrite/SCV plate (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Pack these plates as described previously and incubate for 3\u20135\u00a0days at 78\u00b0C.\nIn case of growth, scrape a small amount of the Sulfolobus cells from the spot with a pipette tip or inoculation loop and resuspended in 20\u00a0\u03bcL milliQ-H2O. Dilute the resuspension 50-fold with milliQ-H2O.\nPerform a PCR to confirm the presence of the plasmid pSIRV2Mgp48his within the inoculated colonies using the primers Seq-F and Seq-R (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nTransfer positive spots into 20\u00a0mL of 1\u00d7 SCV medium and incubate at 78\u00b0C for 1\u20132\u00a0days.\nFor long-term storage of the constructed strains, we recommend preparing glycerol stocks:\nSubculture transformants at a starting OD600 of 0.05.\nAfter incubation for 36\u00a0h or when OD600 \u2245 0.6\u20130.7, centrifuge 10\u00a0mL of the culture at 6,300\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min.\nResuspend the pellet in 670\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 medium salts solution and add 200\u00a0\u03bcL of sterile 87%\u00a0(v/v) glycerol in a microcentrifuge tube.\nThe glycerol stocks of the cells can be stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nGenome editing of SIRV2\nTiming: 12\u00a0daysInoculate the S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 \u0394arrays strain carrying the genome editing plasmid (hereafter, referred to as \u0394arrays/pSIRV2Mgp48his) into 30\u00a0mL fresh SCV medium in an Erlenmeyer flask such that the initial OD600 will be around 0.05. Start incubation.\nOnce the culture of \u0394arrays/pSIRV2Mgp48his has reached OD600\u00a0= 0.6\u20130.8 (after approx. 36 h), transfer a specific volume of the suspension into fresh SCV medium to a final volume of 30\u00a0mL, such that the OD600 of the new culture starts at 0.05. This volume is calculated by Equation\u00a0(1)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1] as used in previous sections. Allow this culture to incubate for 1\u00a0h at 78\u00b0C.\nAdd a specific volume of the titrated virus sample to the 30-mL culture of \u0394arrays/pSIRV2Mgp48his\u00a0such that the MOI of the culture will be around 0.1.\nIn general, the volume Vvir of virus sample required to reach any given MOI is calculated according to Equation\u00a0(4)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd4]:\n   (Equation\u00a04)    V  v i r   =   M O I \u22c5 O  D 600  \u22c5    10 8     C F U   m l    0.2  \u22c5  ( 30  m l  \u2212  Y )   X      \nHere, OD600 is the measured optical density of the 30-mL culture after 1 h, Y is the volume (in ml) that was removed from the 30-mL culture to measure the OD600, and X is the titer (given in PFU/mL) of the virus sample, as determined by plaque assay in a previous section.\nIn addition, prepare the following two cultures:\nA culture of plasmid-free \u0394arrays infected with the virus sample at an MOI around 0.1\nAn uninfected culture of \u0394arrays/pSIRV2Mgp48his where the virus sample is replaced by a similar volume of sterile 1\u00d7 medium salts solution.Incubate the suspensions for two days while monitoring the OD600 regularly (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Around 24 and 48\u00a0h post infection (hpi), take out 1-mL samples from the culture and store them at RT.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1031-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05. Genome editing of SIRV2\nGrowth curves (A) of a genome editing host (\u0394arrays/p\u0394SIRV2gp48) in the presence and absence of an infecting virus. Results from three biological replicates are shown and error bars indicate the corresponding standard deviations. The double-headed arrows indicate the crucial difference in OD600 that should be observed between infection of the genome editing host and infection of a CRISPR deficient (\u0394arrays) host. A plaque assay (B) is performed to allow for the isolation of viruses with a single genotype. The genotype of each inoculated plaque is verified by PCR (C). For illustration, we here show the PCR fragments amplified from the original virus (SIRV2M) as well as the two mutant viruses (SIRV2M\u039448 and SIRV2Mgp48his) mentioned throughout this protocol. The PCRs check for the presence of the genomic region of interest containing gp48 (C, left panel), the absence of gp48 in the virus genome (C, middle panel), and the presence of an octahistidine (8xHis)-tag in the virus genome (C, right panel). The primer pairs are shown below each panel and are further illustrated in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nIsolate the virus particles by centrifuging the collected samples at 10,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 6\u00a0min and transfer the supernatant into new microcentrifuge tubes.Analyze the virus samples by PCR to point out the positive virus sample. The PCR mixture should contain a primer that anneals specifically to the donor DNA that has been inserted (e.g., virus his chkF) and another primer that anneals to the flanking region in the virus genome (e.g., gp48 out chkF). This setup is illustrated in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. Importantly, the latter primer should not anneal to pSIRV2Mgp48his, as this would give rise to false positives.\nNote: If the band corresponding to the mutant virus is either absent or faint, repeat the genome editing protocol from step 33 by propagating an aliquot of the latest virus sample for a further two days in a fresh culture of \u0394arrays/pSIRV2Mgp48his.\nUpon confirmation, the supernatants containing the positive virus mutants should be employed in a plaque assay, following the protocol described in step 20 of the \u201cbefore you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]\u201d-section.\nNote: While the purpose of the plaque assay in the \u201cbefore you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]\u201d-section was to determine the virus titre, the purpose of the present plaque assay is to isolate individual plaques with the mutant genotype.\nUsing the 1000-\u03bcL pipette, pick 10\u201320 individual plaques that have emerged from the 0.7% Gelzan CM/SCVU plates (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) and inoculate them individually into 20\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 medium salts solution. Resuspend the plaques thoroughly by pipetting up and down a few times.\nRepeat the PCR from step 36, this time using individual, resuspended plaques as template. Analyze the amplicons by agarose gel electrophoresis in order to identify the plaques with the desired mutant genotype (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).As a final validation of the selected virus, send the amplified genomic fragments for sequencing at an external service (e.g., Eurofins Genomics, Germany). Align the mutant virus sequence with the reference genome using pairwise sequence alignment tools (BLAST) to confirm the accuracy of the desired virus modification.\nPull-down of a genomically tagged virus protein expressed during infection\nAs a proof-of-concept of the methods presented above, we will end this protocol by giving an example of how the constructed mutant viruses can improve research within the field of archaeal host-virus interactions. Specifically, we will describe how a virus protein such as gp48/AcrIIIB1, which has been genomically tagged with an 8xHis-tag, can be purified from an infected host culture. Compared to having the virus protein expressed from an expression vector inside the host, expressing and purifying the protein from the virus itself during infection ensures accuracy in terms of expression levels and native interaction partners.\nVirus preparation\nTiming: 5\u20137\u00a0days\nInoculate the \u0394arrays/pSIRV2Mgp48his strain from the \u221280\u00b0C glycerol stock (described in step 30) into 30\u00a0mL fresh SCV medium in an Erlenmeyer flask. Allow the culture to incubate for two days at 78\u00b0C and 150\u00a0rpm.\nOnce the 30-mL culture has reached OD600 \u2245 0.8\u20131.0, dilute the culture with fresh SCV medium to a final volume of 1 liter. Measure the initial OD600 (should be around 0.025) and allow the 1-liter culture to incubate until OD600 \u2245 0.1.\nPrepare a 10\u22123 dilution of the latest SIRV2Mgp48his sample in 1\u00d7 medium salts solution and transfer 300\u00a0\u03bcL into the 1-liter \u0394arrays/pSIRV2Mgp48his culture to start the virus propagation. Incubate the host-virus suspension for 36\u00a0h while monitoring the OD600 regularly every 12 h.Note: If the OD600 of the host-virus suspension is above 0.4 at 36\u00a0hpi, repeat the procedure from step 43 with a fresh 1-litre host suspension and a less diluted virus sample.\nIsolate the SIRV2Mgp48his virus particles by centrifuging the 1-liter culture at 10,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 6\u00a0min and transfer the supernatant into a new flask.\nPerform a plaque assay to determine the virus titer in the infected culture supernatant, following the instructions described previously in step 20 of the \u201cbefore you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]\u201d-section.\nInfection and harvesting of cells\nTiming: 6\u00a0days\nInoculate the S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 \u0394Cas6(I-D) and S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 \u0394Cas6(I-D)/pCmr6\u03b1-HA host strains from their respective \u221280\u00b0C glycerol stocks into individual Erlenmeyer flasks each filled with 20\u00a0mL fresh SCV(U) medium. Allow the two cultures to incubate for two days.\nNote: Be aware that S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 \u0394Cas6(I-D) should be grown in SCVU medium whereas S.\u00a0islandicus LAL14/1 \u0394Cas6(I-D)/pCmr6\u03b1-HA should be grown in SCV medium due to its plasmid.\nOnce the 20-mL cultures have reached OD600 \u2245 0.8\u20131.0, transfer each culture into fresh, pre-heated medium to final volumes of 120\u00a0mL. Incubate the cultures for approximately 24 h.\nSplit each 120-mL culture in two and transfer each half into fresh, pre-heated medium to a final volume of 1 liter (i.e., two liters of culture is started per strain in this step). Allow these cultures to incubate for \u223c20 h.\nNote: When incubating large batches of an S.\u00a0islandicus culture, we recommend dispersing the culture volume into 1-litre aliquots and growing each aliquot in parallel in 2-litre Duran\u00ae bottles which can fit in an incubator large enough to contain and heat all flasks to 78\u00b0C simultaneously. In our case, we have used two New BrunswickTM INNOVA 44 incubator shakers.When the four 1-liter cultures have reached OD600 \u2245 0.4, transfer 150-mL of each culture into new 2-liter Duran\u00ae bottles containing 850\u00a0mL fresh, pre-heated medium. In total, 12 liters will be made for each host strain. The initial OD600 of these cultures should be around 0.06. Allow all parallel cultures to incubate in the same incubator overnight (approx. 12\u201314 h).\nOnce the cultures have reached early exponential growth phase (OD600\u00a0= 0.2\u20130.3), infect each culture with a specific volume of the SIRV2Mgp48his sample (from step 44) to arrive at a MOI\u00a0= 1. This volume is calculated by Equation\u00a0(4)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd4], remembering to replace \u201c30\u00a0mL\u201d with \u201c1000\u00a0mL\u201d in the formula. Allow the infected cultures to continue their incubation for 3 h.\nNote: The incubation time depends on the expression phase of the target protein. Purification of target proteins corresponding to early expressed genes should be harvested 2\u20133\u00a0hpi, those corresponding to middle/late expressed genes should be harvested at a later time point, but prior to cell lysis (8\u00a0hpi).\nRemove the bottles from the incubator and allow the cultures to cool down to RT.\nOnce cooled, harvest the cells from the 2\u00d712 liters of culture by centrifugation at 6,300\u00a0\u00d7 g and 16\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. We recommend using the Sorvall LYNX 6000 superspeed centrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatants and weigh the cell pellets.\nResuspend the cell pellets in cool (4\u00b0C) lysis buffer, using 5\u00a0mL of buffer per gram of pellet. This step should be performed on ice. Resuspend by pipetting, not by vortexing.\nTransfer the resuspended cell pellets into Falcon tubes and store at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.\nProtein purification/protein pull-down\nTiming: 2\u00a0days\nThaw the resuspended cell pellets by placing the Falcon tubes in a water bath for \u223c 30\u00a0min.Lyse the archaeal cells by the following steps:\nFirst, a round of sonication (30 cycles of 3-s pulses intervened by 3-s pauses).\nThen, two rounds of homogenization with a French press equilibrated with the lysis buffer.\nFinally, end with another round of sonication, using the same program as above.\nCritical: To avoid contamination between the two host strain suspensions, rinse the sonicator rod with 70% ethanol and run some 20% ethanol through the French press several times between individual samples. This clean-up should also be done before and after the instruments are used.\nRemove all cell debris from the lysed cell samples by centrifugation at 16,000\u00a0\u00d7 g and 4\u00b0C for 45\u00a0min. The precipitate will be dark brown/gray, while the supernatant appears beige. Move both supernatants to new Falcon tubes and repeat the centrifugation until the precipitates become smaller than a fingernail and the supernatants become slightly transparent.\nMeanwhile, equilibrate 2\u00d72\u00a0mL of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose resin (QIAGEN):\nSpin down the agarose resins at 800\u00a0\u00d7 g for 3\u00a0min in a swinging-bucket centrifuge.\nDiscard the storage buffer and resuspend each resin bed in 10\u00a0mL of lysis buffer.\nRepeat substeps 57.a and 57.b at least five times.\nFilter the supernatants (from step 56) through sterile, non-pyrogenic, hydrophilic filters (0.45\u00a0\u03bcm) and mix with the equilibrated Ni-NTA agarose resins (from step 57) in 50-mL Falcon tubes. Allow both mixtures to incubate overnight (approx. 14 h) at 4\u00b0C on a rotary wheel set to 10\u00a0rpm.\nNote: The slow rotation speed is applied to minimise the generation of foam, which is a potential source of protein loss in this protocol. Furthermore, use the two Falcon tubes as counterweights for each other to stabilise the rotor speed.Spin the protein-bound Ni-NTA resins at 800\u00a0\u00d7 g for 3\u00a0min in a swinging-bucket centrifuge.\nDiscard the supernatants and wash the protein-bound Ni-NTA resins:\nAdd 10\u00a0mL of lysis buffer to each resin bed and incubate for 5\u00a0min on the rotary wheel set to 10\u00a0rpm to ensure proper mixing.\nSpin down the agarose resins at 800\u00a0\u00d7 g for 3\u00a0min in a swinging-bucket centrifuge and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat substeps 60.a and 60.b at least five times to remove all unbound proteins.\nAfter the last centrifugation, resuspend the resin beds in 0.8\u20131.0\u00a0mL lysis buffer each and transfer the mixtures from the Falcon tubes to microcentrifuge tubes.\nSpin down the microcentrifuge tubes at 800\u00a0\u00d7 g for 3\u00a0min and discard the supernatant.\nElute the proteins that are bound to the Ni-NTA resins:\nAdd an equal volume of elution buffer to the protein-bound Ni-NTA agarose resin beds and incubate the tubes for 5\u00a0min on a rotary wheel set to 10\u00a0rpm.\nSpin down the microcentrifuge tube with the elution mixture at 800\u00a0\u00d7 g for 3\u00a0min and transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube. Refill the microcentrifuge with a fresh bed volume of elution buffer.\nRepeat substeps 61.a to 61.b at least five times to extract all proteins from the resin.\nCombine the collected eluates into one volume and concentrate the proteins via spin filtering, e.g., by using the Pierce\u2122 Protein Concentrator PES (10K MWCO). Briefly, the protein solutions are added to separate spin columns and centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0\u00d7 g in rounds of 4\u00a0min until only 100\u00a0\u03bcL is left in each spin column. Transfer the retentates into new microcentrifuge tubes and store them at 4\u00b0C until needed.Resolve the concentrated protein samples by SDS-PAGE using the mini-PROTEAN\u00ae Electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad, USA).\nPrior to gel loading, mix 15\u00a0\u03bcL of each concentrated protein sample with 5\u00a0\u03bcL of 4\u00d7 SDS loading buffer, incubate for 5\u00a0min on a heat block set to 95\u00b0C, and collect the mixtures at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube by a brief spin down.\nThe samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel at 16 mA for up to 2\u00a0h with the voltage set to a maximum of 120 V.\nAfter the run, remove the gel from the chamber and stain it for 1\u00a0h with a Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250)-based staining solution.\nDestain the gels repeatedly in destaining solution until the protein bands can be distinguished clearly from the background (as shown best in Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1031-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. SDS-PAGE and Western Blots showing virus protein expressed and purified during infection\nThe His-tagged copy of gp48/AcrIIIB1 was expressed from the virus SIRV2Mgp48his during infection and subsequently used as bait in a protein pull-down. The proteins in the pull-down samples were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (left panel). The migrations and relative intensities of the bands that appear in the gel correspond well to the size and stoichiometry of the six subunits of the Cmr-\u03b1 complex (indicated to the right of the gel). The concentrated pull-down samples were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the presence of human influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tag on the target protein (Cmr6\u03b1) was detected using the primary and secondary antibodies, HA Tag Monoclonal Antibody (2\u20132.2.14) and Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Secondary Antibody, HRP respectively (right\u00a0panel).\nWestern blot analysis\nTiming: 1\u20132\u00a0daysResolve the concentrated protein samples on another 12% SDS-PAGE gel, this time without staining and destaining the gel after the run. Instead, wash the separation gel with distilled H2O.\nTransfer the proteins from the SDS-PAGE gel to a Nitrocellulose membrane by Semi-Dry transfer:\nPrepare the blotting papers and the Nitrocellulose membrane (AmershamTM ProtranTM 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm NC) by soaking them individually in the transfer buffer.\nThe transfer assembly should be arranged top-to-bottom in the following order: cathode, blotting paper, SDS-polyacrylamide gel, nitrocellulose membrane, blotting paper, anode.\nRemember to remove any air bubbles during this assembly by gently rolling a cylindrical object over the setup before placing it between the cathode and anode.\nConnect the transfer assembly to the power source and perform the protein transfer at 70 mA for 75\u00a0min. The voltage should be set to any value >20\u00a0V to prevent the voltage from being the limiting factor during the transfer.\nOnce the transfer is complete, carefully separate the nitrocellulose membrane from the gel and the blotting papers, and incubate the membrane in wash buffer (WB) for 2\u00a0min.\nPrepare blocking buffer by dissolving 1.5 grams of skim milk in the WB.\nReplace the WB with 30\u00a0mL of blocking buffer (the exact volume depends on the size of the membrane incubation tray) and incubate for 30\u00a0min at RT on a shaking platform.\nPause point: The membrane soaked in the blocking buffer can be placed overnight (approx. 14 hours) at 4\u00b0C (no shaking).\nWash the nitrocellulose membrane three times with the WB for 3\u00a0min each. Incubate at RT on a shaking platform.\nIf the membrane was incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight, it should first be allowed to incubate at RT for 30\u00a0min on a shaking platform before this washing step.Prepare the primary antibody solution by mixing \u201cHA Tag Monoclonal Antibody (2\u20132.2.14)\u201d and WB at 1:10000 (v/v) final ratio.\nDiscard the WB and incubate the membrane in the primary antibody solution for 1\u20134\u00a0h at RT on a shaking platform.\nRepeat step 69.\nPrepare the secondary antibody solution by mixing \u201cGoat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Secondary Antibody, HRP\u201d, and WB at 1:3000 (v/v) final ratio.\nDiscard the WB and incubate the membrane in the secondary antibody solution for 1\u00a0h at RT on a shaking platform.\nRepeat step 69. After the final wash, mix equal volumes of Stable Peroxide Solution and the Luminol/Enhancer Solution from the SuperSignalTM West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Substrate mixture).\nAfter the final wash, remove the WB as much as possible without drying the membrane and transfer the Nitrocellulose membrane into a dry container. Spread the substrate mixture uniformly across the membrane and incubate for 2\u20133\u00a0min.\nPlace the membrane between two transparent plastic sheets, remove any air bubbles, and bind it within a Kodak BioMax Cassette.\nSignal development:\nIn a darkroom, place an X-ray film (AGFA CP-BU, Kruuse) directly on top of the plastic-wrapped membrane.\nAfter 30\u201360 s, develop the film using the developer and fixer solutions.

Observe a thin lipid film on the bottom of the flask.\nHeat 10 ml of a 10% sucrose solution to 55 \u00b0C.\nPour the heated 10% sucrose solution onto the thin lipid film slowly, i.e. 1 ml/min, while gently swirling the flask. Maintain the 10% sucrose and flask with lipids at 55 \u00b0C so that the lipid molecules remain in the gel-liquid phase. Rehydration results in multilamellar vesicle (MLV) formation.\nAllow lipids to rehydrate at 55 \u00b0C for at least one hr before sizing the liposomes.\nAssemble an extruder per manufacturer's instructions with 1.0 \u00b5m filters or use 1.0 \u00b5m syringe filters for sizing.\nAdd 1 ml of the heated liposome suspension to one of the syringes on the extruder, and pass the suspension between the two syringes 11 times. Make sure that the suspension is in the opposite syringe than the starting syringe after the 11 passes.\nSize the liposomes again through 0.45 \u00b5m then 0.2 \u00b5m filters to generate large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). Keep the liposome suspension heated for easier sizing.Incubate 20 \u00b5l of the 4 nmole liposome suspension (200 \u00b5M) with 200 \u00b5l of a 20 \u00b5M (4 nmole total) stock siRNA solution for 10 min at room temperature.\nIncubate 80 \u00b5l of a 500 \u00b5M (40 nmole total) stock RVG-9r solution with the siRNA/liposome solution for 10 min at RT.

Preparation of PALETS\nUse a 55:40:5 molar ratio of either DSPE (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine):cholesterol:DSPE-PEG or DOTAP:cholesterol:DSPE-PEG for PALETS. For a 4 nmole liposome preparation, mix 2.2 nmoles of either DSPE or DOTAP, 1.6 nmoles of cholesterol, and 0.2 nmoles of DSPE-PEG into 10 ml of a 2:1 chloroform:methanol solution in a flask.\nPrepare liposome suspension exactly as described in Step 1.1 and 1.2 above.

Stocks that have been maintained in vitro for more than 30 passages may produce more variable results.\n- Culture cells to 40-60% confluence at the point of passaging or experimental use. A density of 1.8x10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> is recommended, but this should be optimised for each cell line.\n- Routinely test all cell lines for Mycoplasma contamination and maintain stocks under antibiotic free conditions to quickly identify microbial infections.\n**0 hours: Preparation of Gastruloids from mESCs and miPSCs \\(one 96-well plate)**\n**Note 1:** The following protocol describes generation of gastruloids from mESCs and miPSCs. Gastruloids can be reproducibly generated with mESC and miPSC lines from genetic backgrounds that include the 129 strain. The culture requirements may differ for mESCs and miPSCs \\(e.g. the use of ES+LIF Medium1 or 2, respectively). Such differences can also be observed between different mESC lines from different genetic backgrounds.\n**Note 2:** Gastruloids derived from miPSCs generally require higher starting cell numbers \\(e.g. 600-800 cells/well) compared to mESC-derived gastruloids \\(e.g. 300 cells/well). The optimum starting cell number should be defined empirically.\n**Note 3:** Gastruloids can be formed successfully from cells cultured in 2i conditions \\(N2B27 + 3\u00b5M Chi + 1\u00b5M PD0325901 + LIF), although the process of elongation is slightly delayed with respect to cells from ESL medium.\n**1.** Pre-warm PBS, ESLIF, N2B27 and Trypsin-EDTA in a 37\u00b0C waterbath.**Optional:** If maintaining the cell stock, pre-coat a T25 tissue culture flask with 5mL 0.1% Gelatin in PBS.\n**2.** Aspirate the medium from the T25 tissue culture flask and rinse gently with 5mL PBS, twice.\n**3.** Aspirate the PBS and add 1mL of pre-warmed Trypsin-EDTA.\n**4.** Rock the flask to detach the colonies of cells.

Chemical Solution Preparation\nNOTE: The following steps are for preparing chemical solutions required in later steps. These can be made in bulk and stored for several months.\nTo begin, prepare 50 mL of purified, deionized water by sterilizing in a 254 nm UV crosslinking oven for 15 min (15 mJ/cm2 total exposure) to neutralize any contaminating DNA. Heat to 37 \u00b0C for use in following steps.\nMake 10 mL of a 40% total (T) and 3.3% crosslinker (C) (29:1) polyacrylamide precursor solution. Weigh 3.867 g of acrylamide monomer and 0.133 g of bis-acrylamide monomer. Combine and bring volume up to 10 mL with warm purified water and vortex until dissolved. Store protected from light at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Premixed 40% T, 3.3% C (29:1) polyacrylamide solutions can be purchased commercially.\nMake 10mL of 50% T, 5% C gel solution. Weigh 4.750 g of acrylamide monomer and 0.250 g of bis-acrylamide monomer. Combine and bring volume up to 10 mL using warm purified water and vortex until dissolved. Store protected from light at room temperature.\nMake 10 mL of a 50% (w/v) sucrose solution. Add 5 g sucrose to a graduated cylinder and add warm purified water up to a total volume of 10 mL. Vortex until dissolved and store at room temperature.\nMake 10 mL of 10% APS (w/v). Add 1 g of ammonium persulfate (APS) to a graduated cylinder. Add cold (~4\u00b0 C) purified water up to a total volume of 10 mL and vortex until dissolved. Immediately freeze in aliquots of 200 \u00b5L.\n2. Gel-seq Cassette Fabrication\nNote: Gel-seq was originally developed with upright cassettes (see Table of Materials for more information); however, this protocol can be adapted to work with any standard gel electrophoresis cassette.Prepare gel precursors in three separate plastic tubes by adding reagents as shown below in Table 1. Do not add either APS or Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) until directed in the following steps.

Submerge this assembly in an ultrasonic bath set to high and wait until bubbles stop emerging from the liquid before moving to next step (~60 seconds / tube).\n\tNOTE: The quality of the vacuum and power of the ultrasonic bath is not critical so long as bubbles can be seen emerging from the solution.\nAdd TEMED and APS to the filler gel precursor and vortex briefly. Immediately add 6 mL of the filler gel precursor to each gel cassette by pipetting the solution into the top of the cassette. Use a 1 mL micropipette to add the precursor in six increments to avoid spilling. The total time for this step should be less than 3 minutes.Ensure the fluid is level by positioning the cassettes upright on a level table. Fill the remainder of the cassette with deionized, degassed water. Pipette the water, again using 1 mL increments, slowly into the center of the cassette to minimize mixing. Allow the polymer to cure for at least one hour, up to overnight.\nAfter the polymer has cured, invert the gel cassettes over a sink to remove the water overlay. A compressed air gun can be used to gently dry the interface by blowing air through the top opening of the cassette from a distance of 6 inches.\nAdd TEMED and APS to the high-density gel precursor and vortex briefly. Immediately add 320 \u00b5L of the high-density precursor to the cassette, again using a 1 mL pipette. Ensure the fluid evenly coats the filler gel layer by rocking the cassette back and forth around 3 times. This step should take less than three minutes.\nFill the remainder of the cassette with deionized, degassed water. Pipette slowly with a 1 mL pipette into the center of the cassette to minimize mixing. Allow the polymer to cure for at least fifteen minutes, preferably an hour.\nAgain, invert the gel cassettes to remove the water overlay. Compressed air can be used to gently dry the interface. Add TEMED and APS to the low-density gel precursor and vortex briefly. Immediately fill the remainder of the cassette (~1.65 mL) with the low-density gel precursor and insert the gel comb.\nPipette an excess of reserve precursor at the top of the comb as it will be absorbed during polymerization. Allow the polymer to cure at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Gels can be stored for a week or more in a buffer of Tris-Borate-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (TBE buffer).\n3. Sample Preparation and Reverse TranscriptionStarting with a suspension of the cells of interest, and working in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laminar flow hood, use a hemocytometer or an automatic cell counter to calculate the cell concentration. Dilute the cells to a concentration of 100 to 1000 cells per \u00b5L in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: This protocol has been validated on a range of cells including PC3, HeLa, and mouse liver cells.\nUsing reagents provided in the WTA kit (see Table of Materials), mix 19 \u00b5L of lysis buffer and 1 \u00b5L of RNase inhibitor to prepare a 10X stock solution of reaction buffer. Create a lysis master mix of sufficient volume containing 0.5 \u00b5L of reaction buffer and 2.75 \u00b5L of nuclease free water for each sample.\nPipette the cell suspension up and down 5 times to re-suspend settled cells and then pipette 1 \u00b5L of sample into a 200 \u00b5L nuclease free strip tube sterilized by UV. Repeat as necessary depending on number of samples. Be sure to include a negative control by pipetting 1 \u00b5L of nuclease free water instead of cells for one reaction. Next, add 3.25 \u00b5L of lysis master mix to each sample and mix by gently pipetting up and down 5 times.\nPreheat a thermal cycler (with heated lid) to 72 \u00b0C. Add 1 \u00b5L of RT primer and 1 \u00b5L of 20 \u00b5M random hexamer with WTA adapter (5\u2032-AAGCAGTGGTAT-CAACGCAGAGTAC-NNNNNN-3\u2032) to each sample. Reserve at least one tube as a positive control for gDNA library preparation and add 2 \u00b5L of water instead of primers.\n\tNOTE: Random hexamer with WTA adapter is optional and has minimal impact on sequencing results.Incubate samples at 72 \u00b0C in the preheated thermal cycler for 3 minutes to lyse the cells. Remove cells from thermal cycler and place on ice for 2 minutes. Store the positive control at 4 \u00b0C until step 5.\nWhile the cells are lysing, create a sufficient volume of reverse transcription master mix for all RNA samples containing the following reagent ratios: 2 \u00b5L of first strand buffer, 0.5 \u00b5L of template switch oligonucleotide (TSO), 0.25 \u00b5L of RNase inhibitor, and 1 \u00b5L of reverse transcriptase (100 U/\u00b5L).\nPreheat thermal cycler to 42 \u00b0C. Add 3.75 \u00b5L of reverse transcription master mix to the remaining samples, bringing the total sample volume to 10 \u00b5L. Mix by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nPerform reverse transcription by immediately placing samples in a preheated thermal cycler. Run the following program: 42 \u00b0C for 90 min, 70 \u00b0C for 10 min, 4 \u00b0C forever. This is a safe stopping point.\n4. Gel Separation and Sample Recovery\nCarefully clean a gel electrophoresis chamber using a DNA removal product. Apply several mL of the liquid cleaning agent to a disposable lint free wipe and wipe across all surfaces of the chamber, and then fill the chamber with clean 0.5x TBE. For optimal results, place the entire apparatus in a 254 nm UV crosslinking oven and sterilize for 15 minutes (15 mJ/cm2).\nInsert the Gel-seq cassette into the gel electrophoresis chamber and lock it into place. Slowly remove the gel comb by pulling straight up. Move slowly to avoid tearing the gel or ripping any of the arms.Keeping the samples from step 3 on ice, reserve at least one sample as a positive control for cDNA library generation. Store this control at 4 \u00b0C until step 6. Add 2 \u00b5L of 6X loading dye to the remaining samples, bringing the total volume to ~12 \u00b5L. Thoroughly mix the samples by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nCombine 1 \u00b5L of a DNA ladder with 2 \u00b5L of 6x loading dye and 7 \u00b5L of water. Pipette this mixture into lane 1 of the Gel-seq cassette as an electrophoresis control. Pipette the samples from the previous step into separate lanes of the Gel-seq cassette. Be careful to prevent contamination between wells by inserting the pipette fully into each well and removing it using only a vertical motion.\nUsing a standard gel electrophoresis power supply, apply an electric field of 250 V across the Gel-seq cassette for 30 minutes to separate the gDNA from the cDNA/RNA hybrids. Once separated, remove the Gel-seq cassette from the gel electrophoresis chamber and open the two halves of the cassette by prying the edges with a scraping tool.\nUsing a scalpel, cut the gel in half just below the high-density layer. Discard the half that contains filler gel by picking it up with your gloved hand. Gently peel the remaining gel off of the cassette by scraping it with a paint scraper or other similar tool. Place this section of the gel into a dish containing ~30 mL of 0.5x TBE with 3 \u00b5L of gel stain.Cover the container to minimize photobleaching and soak the gel while gently shaking the container for 5 minutes. Place the gel on plastic wrap and take a UV image using a gel documentation system (for further detail see Ref. 13). A 30 second exposure typically produces clear images. Verify that separation has occurred.\nMove the gel to a UV transilluminator to facilitate visualization of the nucleic acids. Wearing appropriate UV glasses, confirm the results from the gel documentation system. The gDNA should be located at the start of the low-density gel and the cDNA at the interface of the low-density and high-density regions.\nUse a scalpel, cut out the regions of the gel containing the gDNA and cDNA. Samples are best recovered by cutting a 4 mm by 10 mm rectangular section of gel; however, the exact geometry will depend on the gel electrophoresis system used. Remember to also cut the lane loaded with the negative control.\nPlace each excised section of gel into a strip tube by using a pair of blunt end tweezers. Be careful not to apply too much force or the gel will split into multiple pieces. Should this happen, simply pick up each piece and add it to the tube.\nGrind the gel in each tube using the tip of a pipette (200 \u00b5L pipette tips work well) by moving the pipette tip in a circular fashion against the bottom of the tube. Add nuclease free water (40 \u00b5L into the gDNA samples and 80 \u00b5L into the cDNA samples) to each tube before removing the pipette tip used to grind the gel to minimize sample loss.Place the strip tubes to a vortex mixer inside of a 37 \u00b0C incubator and shake for 8 - 12 hours. This allows the nucleic acids to diffuse out of the gel and is a natural stopping point for this multi day protocol.\nPipette the samples into an 8 \u00b5m mesh filter plate and spin the plate at 2600 x g for 5 minutes to strain out the gel fragments. Lift the mesh filter plate away from the housing plate and pipette the gel-free water samples into a new 200 \u00b5L strip tube.\nAdd 1 \u00b5L of protease (0.9 AU/mL) to each sample containing gDNA, mix well by pipetting up and down, and incubate at 50 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by a heat inactivation at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. This step is critical for depleting nucleosomes and makes the gDNA accessible for subsequent reaction steps.\nUsing an 18 gauge needle, poke holes in the caps of all sample tubes. Place the samples in a vacufuge to reduce liquid volume. gDNA samples should be reduced to 5 \u00b5L and cDNA samples reduced to 10 \u00b5L.\nDepending on the vacufuge and number of samples, the total evaporation time will vary between 30 and 60 minutes. If the sample volume falls below the target volume, simply add nuclease free water to increase the sample volume.\n5. gDNA Library Preparation\nUsing a fluorometer or similar technology, quantify the DNA concentration in each gDNA sample from step 4 as well as the positive control from step 3. For a detailed protocol see the fluorometer reference manual.14Dilute the samples to 0.2 ng/\u00b5L of DNA. Depending on the starting cell type and quality of results required, lower concentrations may still produce viable libraries. Some experimentation will be required; however, the authors had success with libraries as low as 0.1 ng/\u00b5L.\nComplete gDNA library preparation by following the library preparation half reaction volume protocol in Step 7.\n6. cDNA Library Preparation\nStarting with the 10 \u00b5L cDNA samples and positive control from step 4, add 12.5 \u00b5L of 2X qPCR mix, 0.5 \u00b5L cDNA PCR primer, and 2 \u00b5L nuclease-free water.\nPerform PCR in a real-time thermocycler using the following protocol: hot-start at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 20-30 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 65 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 3 min. Total sample volume is 25 \u00b5L. Monitor the reaction curves and stop the amplification before the reactions leave the exponential phase (linear signal increase versus cycle number) in order to avoid PCR artifacts due to overamplification. For more on avoiding overamplification, see the discussion section of this paper as well as Ref. 15.\nAfter amplification, clean the product using solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads following the protocol in step 8. Once completed, proceed to the next step.\nUsing a fluorometer or similar technology, quantify the DNA concentration in each cDNA sample as well as the positive control from step 4. Dilute the samples if necessary to contain approximately 0.2 ng/\u00b5L of DNA. Slightly lower concentrations still produce viable libraries. Some experimentation will be required, however the authors had success with libraries as low as 0.1 ng/\u00b5L.Optional step: Perform a standard polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation on 1 - 2 \u00b5L of each the qPCR product to validate the library generation reaction worked. A sample image of successful result is shown in Figure 4. For a detailed protocol on how to conduct polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, see Ref. 16.\nComplete cDNA library preparation by following the library preparation kit half volume reaction protocol in Step 7.\n7. Library Preparation with Half Volume Reactions\nLibrary preparation follows the library preparation kit protocol using half volume reactions.17 All reagents referenced in this section of the protocol are from the library preparation kit (see Table of Materials). Begin by UV sterilizing a sufficient number of strip tubes for the number of samples to be processed.\nPerform the transposase reaction by adding 5 \u00b5L transposase buffer to each strip tube to be used in the assay. Then add 2.5 \u00b5L input DNA at 0.2 ng/\u00b5L (0.5 ng total) followed by 2.5 \u00b5L transposase. Mix by pipetting up and down 5 times.\nIncubate at 55 \u00b0C for 5 minutes, then hold at 10 \u00b0C. After the sample reaches 10 \u00b0C, remove it from the thermocycler and immediately add 2.5 \u00b5L transposase stop buffer to each sample. Keep the samples at room temperature for 5 minutes.\nPrepare the PCR reaction to amplify the transpose treated sample by adding 7.5 \u00b5L library prep PCR mix, 2.5 \u00b5L of an index 1 primer, and 2.5 \u00b5L of an index 2 primer. These primers are proprietary and are supplied by the manufacturer of the library preparation kit. Mix well by pipetting up and down 5 times.NOTE: Ensure that unique primer combinations are used for each sample. There are 12 different index 1 primers and 8 different index 2 primers, making it possible to uniquely label up to 96 different samples. Choose a unique combination of primers for each sample.\nPerform PCR using the following program on a thermocycler.

The libraries should be validated using gel electrophoresis or a similar assay. Refer to the library preparation kit manual for details on how to validate libraries.17\n8. Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization Bead Library Cleaning\nSolid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads should be stored in 1.5 mL aliquots and should be brought to room temperature before each use. It is also recommended to prepare fresh 80% ethanol for each experiment. The following steps are based the SPRI bead protocol in the WTA kit manual.18\nAdd 1 \u00b5l of the WTA kit lysis buffer to each PCR product. Vortex the SPRI beads until evenly mixed, then add 50 \u00b5l of SPRI beads to each sample. Mix by pipetting the sample up and down 10 times and then incubate the samples at room temperature for 8 minutes.\nBriefly spin the samples to collect the liquid from the side of the tubes. Place the samples on a magnetic separation device for ~5 minutes until the liquid appears completely clear.While the samples are on the magnetic separation device, slowly pipette off the supernatant and discard - be careful not to disturb the ring of beads on the tube. Next add 200 \u00b5L of 80% ethanol to each sample without disturbing the beads. Wait for 30 seconds and then carefully pipette off the supernatant. Repeat this step (ethanol wash) once.\nAllow the samples to dry for 30 s - 1 min. Do not over-dry the samples as large fragments will become permanently bound to the beads.\n\tNOTE: A brief dry time is recommended to ensure all traces of ethanol are removed. Should trace amounts of ethanol remain behind they can slightly inhibit downstream reactions.\nRemove the samples from the magnetic separation device and add 15 \u00b5L of water to each sample to elute the DNA from the beads. Pipette up and down and ensure the beads are removed from the sides of the tubes. Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. Briefly spin the samples and then place them on the magnetic separation device for ~1 minute until the solution appears clear.\nWhile the samples are on the magnetic separation device, slowly pipette up the supernatant and transfer it to clean tubes. Be careful not to disturb the ring of beads on the tube. Discard the tubes with beads.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "1. Preparation of Cardiomyocytes\nCoat 6-well plates with basement membrane matrix and culture human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as previously described17.\nDifferentiate hiPSCs into hiPSC-CMs using previously described methods18.\nAt 16 - 18 d post-differentiation, suspend the cardiomyocytes by rinsing each well with 2 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium or magnesium, followed by incubation with 1 mL/well of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) for 5 min at room temperature.\nNeutralize the trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) using an equal volume of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) cell media supplemented with B-27 (RPMI/B-27 cell media). Pipette up and down to loosen any adhered cells.\nCollect the suspended cardiomyocytes with a 10-mL serological pipette and transfer them to a 50-mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain a cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of RPMI/B-27 cell media.\nCombine 20 \u00b5L of cell suspension with an equal amount of 0.4% Trypan blue solution and mix gently.\nUse a manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the cell suspension.\n2. Preparation of Fibroblasts\nInitiate a culture of a human cardiac fibroblast (HCF) (adult ventricular type) cell line as described previously16.\nSuspend the HCFs by incubating them with an appropriate amount of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) for 5 min at room temperature16. For a T175 flask, 10 mL of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent was used.Neutralize the trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) using an equal volume of medium, then transfer the sample to a 50-mL conical tube and centrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain a pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of fibroblast growth medium (see Table of Materials).\nCombine 20 \u00b5L of the HCF cell suspension with an equal amount of 0.4% trypan blue solution and mix gently.\nUse an automated cell counter or manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the new cell suspension.\n3. Preparation of Endothelial Cells\nInitiate a culture of a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line as described previously17. Suspend the HUVECs by incubating them with an appropriate amount of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) for 3 min at room temperature17. Neutralize the trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) using an equal volume of medium, then transfer to a 50-mL conical tube and centrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain a pellet.\n\tNOTE: For a T175 flask, 10 mL of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent was used.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of endothelial cell growth medium (see Table of Materials).\nCombine 20 \u00b5L of the HUVEC suspension and stain it with an equal amount of 0.4% Trypan blue solution and mix gently.\nUse an automated cell counter or a manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the cell suspension.\n4. Creation of Hanging Drop Spheroids\nPlace the hanging drop device which contains 850 micropores (each with a diameter of 350 \u00b5m) into sterile 6-well plates.Isolate the three types of cells as described above: hiPSC-CMs, HCFs, and HUVECs. Combine them in a ratio of 70% iPSC-CMs, 15% HCFs, and 15% HUVECs in a 50-mL conical tube with RPMI/B-27 cell media at a concentration of 2,475,000 cells per mL.\nDispense 4 mL of the cell suspension (2,475,000 cells per mL) to each well of an ultra-low attachment hanging drop system (with a micropore diameter of 350 \u00b5m) seated in a 6-well plate.\nSpheroids will spontaneously form within 12 h of dispensing the cell suspension into the hanging drop device. Continue to culture for a total of 72 h (3 d) at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity for the maturation of the spheroids.\nAfter 72 h of culture, harvest the spheroids through the pores at the bottom of the hanging drop system by placing the device into a dish with medium and swirling it gently to release the spheroids from the hanging drop device.\n5. 3-D Patch Creation Using the Novel Net Mold\nThe base, bottom square plate, bottom net, and 10 layered side nets are assembled to create the novel mold with the aid of a pair of sterile forceps. First, stack and align the base, bottom square plate, and bottom net using the corner posts. Then, stack and layer the 10 side nets in alternating directions to create a net of fine stainless-steel prongs.\nFlush the filling base with PBS or medium to reduce the surface tension and, then, transfer the assembled mold onto the filling base.\nWet the net mold cavity with PBS or medium in the same method. Slowly fill the spheroids into the presupposed cavity of the desired size (2 x 2 x 1 mm, 4 x 4 x 1 mm, or 6 x 6 x 1 mm).Note: Make sure that 120% of the anticipated volume of spheroids is fed into the cavity so that the cell aggregates are in tight connection and stay static.\nAssemble the top net and top square plate onto the corner posts and secure the stoppers and holding tubes to prevent a washout of the spheroids.\nTransfer the filled net mold system to a 6-well plate with 6 mL of RPMI/B-27 cell media or into a sterile container with enough medium to cover the entire assembled mold.\nIncubate the 6-well plate with the filled mold system on a swinging shaker for 7 - 10 days at 3,000 - 4,000 x g.\n\tNOTE: The duration of the incubation is decided by the size of the cardiac patches. With larger patches, the incubation time will need to be increased for cardiac patch maturation.\n6. Removal of the Patch from the Novel Net Mold\nRemove the mold system from the media and place it on the sterilized handling mat in a sterile 10-cm dish.\nRemove the holding tube, stoppers, the top square plate, and the top net. Carefully slide out the layered side nets one by one with a pair of sterile forceps. After decannulation, an intact cardiac patch is obtained atop the bottom net.\nPick up the bottom net with the patch using sterile forceps and transfer the bottom net into a 35-mm dish with 5 mL of RPMI/B27 media. Gently loosen the patch from the bottom net by slowly swirling the net in the dish, or with a sterile cell scraper. After detachment from the bottom net, the cardiac tissue can be cultured with RPMI/B27 media.Continue to incubate the free-floating 3-D cardiac patch in the 35-mm dish. Functional synchronous beating can be observed as early as 24 h after the removal from the mold.\nAfter removing the patch from the net mold, observe that its shape is maintained with integrity and the intensity of synchronous beating increases with time.\n\tNOTE: The 3-D net mold-based cardiac patches exhibited electrical integration of component cardiospheres after decannulation. We observed a beating frequency ranging from 60 to 80 beats per minute that persisted for more than 60 days.\nSubscription Required.

Animals are sacrificed either by bleeding out via heat puncture (after step 1) or by bleeding out through transection of the abdominal vena cava (step 5).\nSubject laboratory animals to deep anesthesia according to approved protocols e.g., with 3-fold overdosed anesthetics. Confirm depth of anesthesia by loss of pedal withdrawal reflex.\nNote: If working under BSL-3 conditions, make sure to wear appropriate PPE including chain gloves when handling animals while they are still awake and to use appropriate safety needles and sharps.\nNote: If protocol without perfusion is performed animals can be sacrificed at this step by bleeding out via heart puncture. If analysis of blood or serum is to be performed in parallel, it can be collected here and placed in an EDTA or clotting tube, respectively. EDTA blood should be kept on ice, whilst clotting should be allowed to occur at 20\u00b0C.\nNote: Protocols with and without perfusion generated valid results. Past reasons to follow a protocol without perfusion were in our case e.g., i) necessity to increase speed of experimental procedures, ii) regulatory limitations restricting use of sharps in biosafety level 3 laboratory and iii) approved animal experimental protocols for sacrifice by bleeding out via heart puncture instead of vena cava.\nPlace anesthetized animals in a secured supine position.\nSoak abdominal and thoracic areas with 70% ethanol to disinfect the fur and keep the surgical instruments sterile.\nCritical: Ensure that the laboratory animal does not aspirate ethanol as it could potentially damage cells in upper and lower airways.Open the abdominal cavity by incising the abdominal skin and peritoneum from the sternum to the pubis using surgical scissors and forceps.\nSacrifice the animal by bleeding out through transection of the abdominal vena cava (in case bleeding out via heart puncture has not been performed after step 1).\nNote: If analysis of blood or serum is to be performed in parallel, it can be collected here from the abdominal vena cava in a 1\u00a0mL syringe using a 27G needle and placed in an EDTA or clotting tube, respectively. EDTA blood should be kept on ice, whilst clotting should be allowed to occur at 20\u00b0C.\nOpen the thoracic cavity and expose the heart and lungs.\nWithout perfusion continue with step 9, with perfusion proceed with step 8.\nPerfuse the pulmonary vessels through the animals\u2019 right heart ventricle by slowly flushing with 5\u00a0mL lung perfusion medium using a 5\u00a0mL syringe capped with a 26G needle (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Clean forceps with 1\u00d7 PBS before moving on to the next well.\nCritical: Rapid, yet gentle cell isolation reduces cell stress and ensures high quality transcriptome data.\nWithin the digestion medium, mechanically dissociate the tissue by securing it with straight anatomical forceps in one hand and repeatedly hitting it with a second curved anatomical set of forceps held in the other hand for approximately 2\u20133\u00a0min. Alternatively, lungs can be cut into <1\u00a0mm pieces using pointed scissors (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02.

Incubate the suspension for 2\u20135\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C.\nNote: The required volume and incubation time is dependent on the rodent species and prior vascular perfusion of lungs. We recommend testing appropriate volume and incubation times for individual experimental settings. In our hands, 2\u00a0mL RBC lysis buffer and 2\u00a0min incubation time was sufficient for perfused mouse lungs while 10\u00a0mL RBC lysis buffer and 5\u00a0min incubation time was sufficient for non-perfused hamster lungs.\nStop RBC lysis by adding at least 10\u00a0mL 0.04% BSA/PBS buffer.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 6\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and discard supernatant.To ensure that RBC are lysed, check if pellet has turned colorless (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).

If a particular population of cells is of specific interest, we highly recommend carefully practicing the protocol and analyzing the samples via flow cytometry prior to proceeding with single-cell barcoding experiments. For instance, staining for major cell populations of the lung (e.g., CD45+  leukocytes, CD326+ epithelial cells and CD31+ endothelial cells) and for cell viability (via measuring 7AAD- or FVD-  cells) can be performed, which allows the frequencies of viable singlets amongst the parent population (or total numbers of cells) to be determined.\nBioanalyzer and QubitBefore sequencing the final single-cell gene expression libraries, quality control measures should be performed to determine the concentration (Qubit) and cDNA fragment sizes (Bioanalyzer) (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. Quality control of generated gene expression libraries\nExample of a final gene expression library with fragment size distribution suitable for next generation sequencing.\nNote: Instead of using a Bioanalyzer, the fragment sizes can also be measured using a fragment analyzer or tape station.\nLimitations\nAlthough the demonstrated protocol was established to represent all major lung cell types, we observe that the distribution of isolated cell types might not necessarily represent cellular frequencies of physiological lung tissue. Estimates based on morphological identification and counting of cells in normal lung tissue sections across species suggest that alveolar type 1 epithelial cells represent between 8%\u201312%, alveolar type 2 epithelial cells 8%\u201316%, endothelial cells 30%\u201346% and alveolar macrophages 3%\u201310% of total lung cells.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Over- or underrepresentation of cell types of interest depend on the type and amount of enzymes used during digestion and processing of the tissue.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOrganoid dissociation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes a step-by-step protocol for the enzymatic dissociation of cerebral organoids into a single cell suspension for downstream analysis. The exact timepoint to take organoids out of\u00a0the culture will depend on the expression levels of the peptides of interest. In our work, we have used cerebral organoids that were 4\u20138\u00a0weeks old (Melliou et\u00a0al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). However, we have tested our protocol for organoid cultures up to 10\u00a0weeks old. Interestingly, we found that the DCX positive compartment show more dynamic temporal changes than the SOX2 positive populations across the collected 2-week intervals. This observation will vary according to the cell biology of the specific population/marker chosen.\nTransfer the cerebral organoids from the 6-well plate used for culturing to a 5\u00a0mL falcon tube, separated by condition.\nCritical: Only healthy organoids should be used for organoid dissociation and further analysis. Ensure that hESCs show healthy stem cell morphology and are 70%\u201380% confluent before seeding. In addition, observe cultures regularly under light microscope and monitor the growth and development of cerebral organoids after every critical step (embryoid body formation, neuroepithelium induction, organoid formation, etc.) as it is previously discussed in (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Although, cerebral organoids can be variable within and between the batches, proper formation is necessary in order to better investigate their molecular proteomic patterns in a reproducible manner (Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nNote: This step should be performed using a cut 1,000\u00a0\u03bcL tip, to avoid disruption of the organoid.\nNote: You can use 5\u20137 organoids per falcon tube, depending on their size and age. In our experience, organoids growing for more than 10\u00a0weeks are harder to dissociate with the conditions described in this section (Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).Remove excess medium from each tube and wash with cold PBS (1\u00d7) three times.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2086-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Proper formation and differentiation of cerebral organoids\nExamples of appropriate and poor cultures at different stages.\n(A) Brightfield image of a healthy (top) and unhealthy (bottom) hESC colony prior to seeding. The scale bar represents 460\u00a0\u03bcm.\n(B) Brightfield image of successful (top) and failed (bottom) formation of embryoid body 5\u00a0days after plating into single cell suspension. The scale bar represents 180\u00a0\u03bcm and 360\u00a0\u03bcm respectively.\n(C) Brightfield image demonstrating an example of an acceptable organoid (top) for further analysis, and a failed organoid, that lacked to produce neuroepithelium and showed large fluid cysts structures (bottom). The scale bar represents 960\u00a0\u03bcm.\nNote: Using cold PBS serves as an effective way not only to remove traces of culture medium, but also to mechanically remove the extracellular matrix (Matrigel) that surrounds cerebral organoids and reduces peptide degradation. Remaining matrix may interfere with peptide extraction and LC-MS/MS. Thus, cerebral organoids are advised to be washed with ice-cold PBS until no visible matrix remains (normally 2\u20133 times).\nAlternatives: Other experimental approaches to eliminate interference of Matrigel contaminants efficiently can be used for proteomic sample preparation of organoids (Wang et\u00a0al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nRemove PBS and add 1\u00a0mL TrypLE in each tube. Place all the tubes in a 360\u00b0 rotating shaker for 30\u00a0min and incubate at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\nUsing a 1,000\u00a0\u03bcL tip, pipette up and down vigorously to break the cerebral organoid in cell clumps and individual cells.\nIncubate for another 15\u00a0min.\nNote: The incubation time with TrypLE varies and depends on the age and complexity of the organoid cultures (Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]). Alternative enzymes or commercially available dissociation kits with similar features should be suitable after optimization.Add 2\u00a0mL of FACS buffer, containing PBS/FBS 98/2 (v/v) to stop the enzymatic reaction and pipette up and down to break down the last clumps with a 1,000\u00a0\u03bcL pipette tip.\nSpin down the tubes (5\u00a0min in 200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at room temperature; 20\u00b0C\u201323\u00b0C). Resuspend the cell pellet in 1\u00a0mL of FACS buffer.\nTo remove remaining cell aggregates and non-dissociated tissue, pass the cell suspension through a 37\u00a0\u03bcm strainer.\nMoisture the strainer with 200\u00a0\u03bcL of FACS buffer before loading the cell suspension.\nAspirate the resuspended cells in FACS buffer and dispense it over the top of the strainer and into the flow tube.\nNote: It is important to add the solution in parts and push down on the mesh strainer slowly so you won\u2019t damage the strainer. It is also advised to tap and slowly pipette if needed before adding more of the solution.\nPerform a viable cell count using trypan blue.\nNote: To proceed with downstream analysis, it\u2019s advised to have more than 80% viability in all cell samples (Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nCell sorting and lysis\nTiming: 1 h/sample\nThese next steps describe how to set the compensation parameters and appropriate gates for multicolor FACS to isolate the cerebral organoid\u2013derived cells by cell type (neurons and neural progenitors) based on their fluorescent reporters. In addition, we describe the subsequent lysis with 8\u00a0M urea for the downstream proteomic analysis.\nUse unstained organoids as a negative control to determine optimal settings for gating and discerning positive from negative cells.\nNote: Unstained control samples should be processed exactly as the stained ones, using the protocol described in the previous section.\nAdd a viability dye (such as DAPI, 1:100) in all samples, including the controls, to separate live from dead cells during cell sorting.Note: The use of a viability marker is important since it could reduce noise and improves separation of cell populations.\nFollow manufacturer instruction regarding use of cell sorters and sort the enriched (i.e., YFP+) and depleted (i.e., YFP-) populations. Certain parameters are also mentioned in Table\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nAlternatives: Alternative tagged lines or fluorophores can be used to identify more than one cell population at a time. However, it is strongly recommended to optimize all the parameters and use all the necessary controls.\nCollect cells in 15\u00a0mL falcon tubes with sorting efficiency of 90% or higher (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2086-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. FACS analysis of single cells after dissociation using trypLE\nRepresentative sort layout from 500k events, showing data from cerebral organoids expressing YFP. Single cells were selected based on their side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) (top row) and live single cells were further isolated from dead cells and debris based on DAPI fluorescence as indicated. Cells were further distinguished from non-fluorescent negative (YFP-) cells (bottom row).\nNote: The number of organoids required for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) must be determined based on the cell population(s) of interest; we recommend collecting >100,000 cells per sample for the downstream proteomic analysis (Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nWash samples.\nCentrifuge at 1,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nRemove supernatant without disturbing the pellet and wash with cold PBS.\nCentrifuge at 1,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C (optional to spin supernatant as well).\nTransfer samples to Eppendorf tubes.\nCentrifuge at 1,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nCell lysis.\nRemove supernatant.\nAdd around 200\u00a0\u03bcL of UREA lysis buffer.\nIncubate for 30\u00a0min in ice.\nSnap freeze in liquid nitrogen.Note: Upon cell lysis, urea is the preferred cell lysis reagent because of its low cost (compared to RapiGest) and its high compatibility for mass spectrometry workflows. Indeed, it has been previously shown that users are able to achieve higher protein yields using Urea compared to RIPA for cell lysis (Ngoka, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nPause point: Samples can be frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until ready to continue with peptide extraction.\nPeptide extraction\nTiming: 2\u00a0days\nThis method describes peptide extraction of lysed and sorted cells derived from cerebral organoids.\nDefrost the samples on ice.\nSonicate the samples, using a water bath sonicator (Bioruptor Pico) at 4\u00b0C to allow complete cell disruption and lysis.\nNote: For this step we have followed a protocol with ultra-high (ultrasonic wave frequency 20\u201360 kHz), 30\u00a0s on, 30\u00a0s off for 30\u00a0min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and transfer the supernatant to a clean Eppendorf tube.\nNote: It is advised to keep the samples in ice at all times before proceeding with protein purification.\nQuantitate the total protein by sample by running a BCA assay as per manufacturer instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011430_Pierce_BCA_Protein_Asy_UG.pdf].\nNote: It is required to have a minimum of 12\u00a0\u03bcg of protein concentration per sample for further analysis.\nTop up the sample volumes to 100\u00a0\u03bcL with 50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate.\nAdd 10\u00a0\u03bcL of 60\u00a0mM DTT in 50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate for protein denaturation, to a final concentration of 6\u00a0mM.\nNote: This solution is prepared fresh immediately before use. For its preparation personal protective equipment and the use of fume hood is required.\nIncubate the samples on a thermoblock at 1,200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 45\u00a0min at 45\u00b0C.Add 11\u00a0\u03bcL of 100\u00a0mM iodoacetamide in 50\u00a0mM of ammonium bicarbonate for protein alkylation, to a final concentration of 18\u00a0mM.\nCritical: Iodoacetamide is unstable and light sensitive. Thus, this solution is prepared fresh immediately before use, and it is advised to perform alkylation in the dark.\nIncubate the samples on a thermoblock at 1,200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 45\u00a0min at room temperature in the dark.\nTrypsinize all samples by adding Trypsin/Lys-C Mix, Mass Spec Grade (1:25 protein ratio).\nIncubate the samples overnight (around 5\u20138\u00a0h in total) on a thermoblock at 1,200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at room temperature.\nDilute the samples with 13.8\u00a0\u03bcL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate, for a final concentration of 1% (v/v).\nCritical: TFA is toxic and volatile. Therefore, use the fume hood when preparing the solution by adding the TFA first and then the ammonium bicarbonate.\nIncubate the samples on a thermoblock at 1,200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 20\u00a0min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 13,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min and transfer the supernatant to a clean Eppendorf tube.\nBy using Pierce C18 zip tip pipette tips, as per manufacturer instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0011713_Pierce_C18_Tip_UG.pdf], the salts, lipids, DNA, and other contaminants are removed.\nElute the bound peptides with 3\u00a0\u03bcL of ACN/H2O 65/35 (v/v)\u00a0+ 0.1% TFA.\nDilute the samples in 42\u00a0\u03bcL with H2O\u00a0+ 0.1% TFA.\nProteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS\nTiming: 90\u00a0min per sample\nThis step describes sample data acquisition of trypsinized samples by LC-MS/MS analysis. The samples are analyzed using a Thermo Fisher nano liquid chromatography setup that was coupled to Q Exactive HFX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer using a nanoelectrospray ionization source. The analytical parameters are stated previously in Table\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].Prior to injection onto the liquid chromatography system, centrifuge samples at 3,500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min.\nInject samples onto LC-MS/MS system for analysis.\nNote: It is recommended to load a volume of 40\u00a0\u03bcL per sample, in order to have two technical replicates (18\u00a0\u03bcL per injection).", "1. Setup of the Rapid Scan Coil Driver at 250 MHz\nCalculation of Rapid Scan Experimental Conditions\n\tNote: The most important parameter in RS-EPR is scan rate, \u03b1, which is the product of scan frequency and scan width (Equation 3). For narrow scan widths, faster scan rates are used, and for wider sweep widths, slower scan rates are used. The following instructions step through the latter case and show how to arrive at the experimental coil driver parameters of 7 mT sweep width and 6.8 kHz scan frequency.\n\t\nDetermine the resonator bandwidth (BWRes).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54068/54068eq1.jpg (1)\n\t\twhere vres is the operating frequency of the resonator and Q is the quality factor.

Resonance occurs at a scan frequency where the inductive and capacitive reactances are of equal magnitude and opposite signs, so that total reactance is close to zero.\n\t\nDetermine the proper capacitance for the frequency determined in 1.1.3 using the inductance, L, of the rapid scan coils and (Equation 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54068/54068eq8.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54068/54068eq9.jpg\nDivide CTOT from (Equation 4) in half to get the capacitor values for each side of the coil driver capacitor box.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54068/54068eq10.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54068/54068eq11.jpg\n\t\tNote: The rapid scan coil driver has two amplifiers.

The two sides are in series.\nUnscrew the top cover of capacitor box and insert capacitors on both sides that are equal to the value determined in step 1.2.2.\nReplace the top of the capacitor box and screw it down to ensure it stays on.\nUsing the front panel of the resonated coil driver, adjust the output frequency until the sinusoidal waveform has the maximum amplitude.\n2. Preparation of Reagents and Phantoms\nPreparation of radicals\nRemove 15N-PDT from the freezer and allow the container to come to room temperature (10-15 min).\nWeigh out 1.4 mg of 15N-PDT using an analytical balance.\nAdd 1.4 mg of 15N-PDT to 15 ml de-ionized (DI) H2O for a final concentration of 0.5 mM.Note: 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetra(2H3)methyl-1-(3,3,5,5-2H4,1-15N)piperdinyloxyl (15N-PDT), 4-1H-3-carbamoyl-2,2,5,5-tetra(2H3)methyl-3-pyrrolinyloxyl (15N-mHCTPO) and 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetra(2H3)methyl-1-(3,4,4-2H3,1-15N)pyrrolidinyloxy (15N-Proxyl)25 (Figure 1E-G) radicals have long term stability (2 years) in aqueous solution and at room temperature. Their solid forms are usually stored in a freezer or refrigerator to keep these radicals stable for years. The stability of nitroxide radicals generally make them non-toxic, and their preparation can be done on a normal benchtop when the solvent is water. When using organic solvents, prepare nitroxide solutions inside a fume hood while outfitted with the proper personal protective equipment (PPE).\nPreparation of pH sensitive trityl radicals\nWeigh out 0.7 mg of triaryl methyl radical (aTAM4)26 radical (1,400 g/mol) and dissolve in 200 \u00b5l of absolute ethanol.\nWeigh 0.00681 g of KH2PO4 (136.1 g/mol) and dissolve in 50 ml DI water for a final concentration of 1 mM.\nWeigh 2.8 g of KOH (56 g/mol) and dissolve in 50 ml of DI water for a final concentration of 1 M.\nAdd KOH drop wise to the phosphate buffer (2.2.2) to adjust the pH of 7.0.\nAdd 800 \u00b5l of 1 mM phosphate buffer and the 200 \u00b5l of aTAM4 in absolute ethanol for a final concentration of 0.5 mM in 80:20 buffer:ethanol.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1-2.2.5 to create the aTAM4 sample at pH = 7.2.\nPlace the aTAM4, pH=7.0 and aTAM4, pH=7.2 into separate 6 mm quartz sample tubes.\nPlace both 6 mm quartz EPR tubes into a 16 mm quartz EPR tube, with a 2 mm thick Styrofoam spacer in between.Note: The walls of the quartz sample tube are 0.5 mm thick, and in addition to the 2 mm spacer yield a 3 mm separation between the aTAM samples. The pH sensitive trityl radicals used were synthesized at the Ohio State University26. The example that was used for imaging is called aTAM4. The reaction which accounts for the pH sensitivity is shown in Figure 1A.\nGeneration of BMPO-OH\nWeigh out 680 mg of KH2PO4 and dissolve in 100 ml DI water for a final concentration of 50 mM.\nAdd 1 M KOH drop wise to the phosphate buffer to pH=7.3.\nWeigh out 50 mg of BMPO (199.25 g/mol).\nCombine the 50 mg of BMPO with 5 ml of phosphate buffer in a 16 mm quartz irradiation tube.\nAdd 100 \u00b5l of 300 mM hydrogen peroxide.\nIrradiate the mixture in the 16 mm quartz irradiation tube with a medium pressure 450 W UV lamp for 5 min.\nUsing a glass transfer pipet, transfer 2.5 ml of irradiated BMPO-OH solution out of the quartz irradiation tube and into one side of a 16 mm quartz sample tube with 3 mm divider.\nTransfer the remaining 2.5 ml of irradiated BMPO-OH into the other side of the 16 mm quartz sample tube with 3 mm divider.\nPreparation of dinitroxide radical\nWeigh out 24.7 mg of 2H,15N-disulfide dinitroxide (Figure 1C) in 1 ml DMSO for a stock solution of 47.5 mM.\nPrepare 10 mM Tris buffer and adjust to pH 7.2.\nTake 40 \u00b5l dinitroxide stock solution and dilute with Tris buffer to a final concentration of 1 mM.\nPlace 250 \u00b5l of dinitroxide solution in buffer in a 16 mm quartz sample tube with a 10 mm divider in the center.Weigh out 154 mg of glutathione and add to 5 ml of Tris buffer for a final concentration of 100 mM.\nAdd 5 \u00b5l of the 100 mM glutathione solution to 250 \u00b5l of 1 mM dinitroxide solution on one side of the 10 mm divider to convert the diradical into monoradical.\nPreparation of nitronyl nitroxide\nRemove the radical from the freezer and allow the container to come to room temperature (10-15 min).\nWeigh out 1.9 mg of nitronyl (390 g/mol).\nWeigh out 0.56 mg of KOH and dissolve in 10 ml DI water for a final concentration of 1 mM.\nMix the 1.9 mg of nitronyl into 10 ml of 1 mM KOH solution for a final concentration of 0.5 mM nitronyl.\n\t\tNote: If necessary, use a vortexer or sonicator to speed solvation of the nitronyl.\n3. Setup of the Rapid Scan Instrument at 250 MHz\nNote: Tuning of the resonator with an aqueous sample of nitroxide radical, which has a similar effect on resonator Q and tuning as buffer solution, is a good way to set up for the sample to be imaged\nTune the resonator with an aqueous sample of nitroxide radical.\nInsert the 15 ml of 0.5 mM 15N-PDT in water sample into a 16 mm quartz EPR tube.\nInsert the quartz tube into the detection side of the cross-loop RS-EPR resonator.\nChange the frequency of the instrument source until it matches the frequency of the detection side that contains the sample. Manually change the carrier frequency of the 250 MHz source by entering the desired value in software.Change the frequency of the excitation side to match the frequencies of the experiment source and detection side of the resonator. Change the frequency of the excitation side by turning a variable capacitor within the resonator cavity according to manufacturer's protocol.\nSet up Instrument Console and Main Magnet\nTurn on the spectrometer and choose an experiment which records transient data with time on the abscissa.\nWithin the software, set the number of points to 65,536 and the time base to 10 nsec.\nSet the number of averages to 10,000 for a strong or narrow signal, and to 45,000 for a broad or weak signal.\nPress the \"engage\" button in the software to send the experimental parameters from the software to the console and energize the main field magnet.\nSet the main magnetic field to 9 mT.\nSet the power attenuation knob to 50 dB, and turn on the 7 W high power amplifier.\n4. Execution of Rapid Scan Experiment\nNote: Specific instructions related to analysis of phantoms containing BMPO-OH24, pH sensitive TAM radicals19,27 and redox sensitive dinitroxides28 are provided in the literature.\nPower saturation of standard nitroxide sample\n\tNote: It is advantageous to do a power saturation curve on a standard nitroxide radical sample under the same experimental conditions which will be used to look at radicals sensitive to pH or redox status.\n\t\nTurn on the rapid scan coil driver, with the values from Section 1 (scan frequency of 6.8 kHz and scan width of 7 mT).\nStarting at 50 dB, collect a rapid scan spectrum with 100k averages. Decrease the attenuation by 3 dB and repeat the measurement. Continue until an attenuator setting of 0 dB, or for as long as the isolation measurement on the bridge readout is < 0.Transfer the raw rapid scan data into a deconvolution program (for example written in Matlab) and process the raw data into the absorption spectrum.\nEnter the scan frequency, sweep width, number of points and timebase into the program, and run the program to process the raw rapid scan signal into an absorption signal.\nPlot the amplitude of the absorption signal as a function of the square root power (in Watt) incident on the resonator. In the non-saturating regime, the amplitude is linearly dependent on the square root of the incident power.\nFit a trend line starting at 0,0 and include all data points which fall into the linear response region. In the linear response region, signal amplitude increases proportional to the square root of microwave power.\nExtrapolate this trend to higher powers, and compare the EPR signal intensity. Use the highest power for which the signal amplitude does not deviate more than 3% from the extrapolated trend line. In order for the deconvolution of the rapid scan signal to work properly, the signal must still be in the linear response region with respect to incident power.\n\t\tNote: Transfer of the raw rapid scan data can be done over a network connection or via thumb drive. In this case the transfer is necessary because the program to process raw data (Matlab) is not on the same computer which has data collection software. The deconvolution algorithm which processes raw data is described in 29.\nSubscription Required.

Using low-capacity staining containers \\(~50-60 ml reagent volume), it is assumed that no more than 10 slides holding 10-20 sections \\(1-2 sections/slide), are handled simultaneously. If required or available, the protocol can be adjusted to fully or semi-automated staining systems. However, given the complex nature of teratoma samples and the time required for microscopy and image taking, it is reasonable to limit the number of analysed specimens to a maximum of around six per run. Cyclophilin A stainings and respective reagent controls \\(e.g. isotype control) are performed on serial sections of the same tissue mounted onto one slide to sustain identical experimental conditions. Tissues from hESC- and control \\(Matrigel)-injected mice are never run separately but always processed in parallel.\n**Deparaffinization and rehydration of tissue sections**, Timing ~1 h 40 min\nFor this protocol, formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues \\(**Box 2**) are sectioned at 2-5 \u03bcm, mounted onto positively charged slides and dried overnight at room temperature in an upright position to allow sections to firmly adhere. Slides stored in a slide box at ambient temperature are then typically processed within 3-5 days. The effect of prolonged slide storage on staining quality is generally quite variable and largely depends on the individual protein, and thus has to be established empirically. In our experience, singleplex stainings of cyclophilin A can be performed on slides stored at room temperature for up to six months, with only minor to moderate loss in overall signal intensity. However, for any systematic comparisons, either qualitative or quantitative, and especially if co-staining for other proteins is performed, it is best to use freshly sectioned tissue stored for less than one week.1 Pre-heat a Coplin staining jar \\(glass-based variant) in an incubator at 60\u00b0C for ~30 min. Do not screw on the lid.\n2 Load jar with slides positioned upright. Place slides either individually or arrange them back-to-back, and incubate for another 30 min at 60\u00b0C to allow the paraffin wax to melt.\nCRITICAL STEP This is a preparative step to soften the paraffin wax and to prime tissue sections for deparaffinization in xylene. It supports the efficient removal of paraffin which is essential to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio in subsequent immunostaining. Although most protocols do not include a \"slide baking step\" prior to solvent-based dewaxing, this approach has proven extremely useful in the context of the procedure and thus should not be omitted.\nAll subsequent washes are performed at room temperature under constant, mild agitation on an orbital shaker. Make sure that slides are fully immersed to compensate for varying reagent levels during rotation. Do not submerge the slide grip \\(~30-40 ml reagent volume/staining jar). \n3 After slide baking, immediately proceed to deparaffinization by incubating sections in two washes of xylene, 10 min each.\nCAUTION Xylene is volatile and toxic, and should be handled carefully. Perform steps in a chemical fume hood or screw on the jar cap to reduce solvent evaporation and to avoid spill during incubation. For re-use, store tightly capped in a fume hood.CRITICAL STEP Xylene solutions are typically re-used but will exhaust over time and gradually loose the ability to dissolve the paraffin wax completely. Make sure to replace solutions on a regular basis, depending on the sample throughput \\(e.g. once every 60-120 sections). Streaking is highly indicative of exhausted solutions which should be replaced with fresh xylene immediately. Insufficient removal of paraffin will significantly impact overall staining quality, mostly by causing uneven, spotty background staining and by generally decreasing the efficiency of antigen detection.\n4 Using forceps, transfer slides into a staining jar with 2-propanol and incubate for 5 min. Make sure to carefully wipe off the xylene to minimize carryover.\nCRITICAL STEP Propanol and anhydrous ethanol are considered to perform more or less equally well in tissue de- and rehydration, with propanol being cheaper and readily accessible but requiring prolonged incubation. This protocol employs propanol as an intermediate step to roughly clear most of the xylene before proceeding to 100% ethanol for ultimate removal. Additionally, unlike ethanol, propanol is somewhat miscible with molten paraffin which might favour wax removal. Overall, this step reduces the total amount of ethanol required, and has proven beneficial to the overall outcome of the procedure. Do not reduce incubation time.\n5 For rehydration, transfer sections through a series of graded ethanol solutions, that is once through 100%, 70% and 50% ethanol, 2 min each.\nCRITICAL STEP Xylene does not mix with water. For its efficient removal, always use ethanol with low water content \\(\u22641%) \\(absolute grade ethanol). Flow marks indicate the use of inappropriate ethanol formulations. Propanol and ethanol solutions can be re-used but are exhanged on a daily basis in this protocol. If re-used, store in staining jars with the cap screwed on to minimize evaporation.6 After rehydration, rinse sections three times in dH<sub>2</sub>O, 5 min each. Keep slides in dH<sub>2</sub>O until ready to perform antigen retrieval.\nCRITICAL STEP Once the deparaffinization and rehydration steps have been completed, it is essential that sections do not dry out at any time during the subsequent procedure. Depending on the extent of drying, this will either prevent any specific staining with no or only very weak signals being detected, or promote non-specific antibody binding, causing extensive background staining.\n**Heat-induced epitope retrieval \\(HIER)**, Timing ~60 min\nFor this protocol, antigen unmasking for subsequent immunostaining has been established using a domestic, 800-watt microwave oven of standard quality. It is operated manually in a discontinous mode by following a defined sequence of on/off cycles at two different power levels. If using a scientific microwave with more even heating and especially accurate temperature and timing control, prior testing might be required to convert the here specified parameters into instrument settings that perform equally well.\n7 While performing step 6 of the procedure, prepare a sufficient amount of 1X antigen retrieval buffer and pre-warm in an incubator at 60\u00b0C until ready to proceed \\(~10-15 min).\nCRITICAL STEP For best results, prepare 1X solutions freshly right before use or on a daily basis. Make sure to include some extra buffer to compensate for evaporation or boilover during microwaving, altogether ~50 ml retrieval buffer per staining jar.\n8 Transfer ~40 ml pre-heated 1X antigen retrieval buffer into a microwaveable staining jar \\(e.g. plastic Coplin staining jar). Save the rest.CAUTION For reasons of safety, always use vessels or racks made of microwave-proof plastic \\(e.g. polypropylene or high-density polyethylene). Standard histology glass is heated more unevenly and will mostly crack when microwaved. It should be noted however, that during the set-up of the procedure, the heating protocol outlined below could successfully be completed using the glass Coplin jars specified in the Materials section. For this, only use intact jars with no visible signs of glass damage or fatigue, and allow the heated jar to rest in the oven for ~1-2 min before taking it out to proceed. This minimizes the likelihood of cracking by avoiding a sudden drop in temperature. Do not use these jars in combination with any other heating protocols than the one specified in this procedure.\n9 Remove slides from water \\(step 6) and immediately place in retrieval buffer. Make sure that slides are covered with buffer by at least one centimeter, that is fully immersed including half of the slide grip, to allow for evaporation during boiling. Do not screw on the jar cap.\n10 Center the jar inside the microwave and adjust the power level to \"low\". For the device specified in this protocol, this level equals 10% of the total power, that is 80 W, and very roughly corresponds to a temperature of <100\u00b0C \\(~65-90\u00b0C).\n11 Turn on the oven and wait until the solution comes to an initial boil, typically 3-6 min. Keep boiling for <sub>3-5 sec and immediately turn off. Pause for </sub>10 sec, with the door open.CRITICAL STEP Microwaves in general, but especially those for domestic use, are known to produce uneven standing wave patterns, leading to the formation of so called hot and cold spots and thus uneven heating. This can cause unbalanced epitope retrieval and hence uneven staining due to a variance in antigen accessibility. For uniform epitope retrieval, always microwave with the rotation dish on to balance hot and cold spots during heating.\n12 For non-continous heating at 25% power \\(<sub>200 W) and </sub>90-110\u00b0C, switch to the \"defrost\" level.\n13 Turn on and wait until boiling is initiated, typically <30 sec. Keep boiling for <sub>1-2 sec and immediately turn off. Pause for </sub>10 sec, with the door open.\nCRITICAL STEP This procedure uses non-sealed vessels. While heating, be sure to monitor the buffer level in the jar and to watch out for excessive evaporation or boilover. Fill up with retrieval buffer if necessary. Do not allow the slides to dry out at any time during microwaving.\n14 Repeat on/off cycles \\(step 13) for ~2-4 times.\n CRITICAL STEP For best results, follow the antigen retrieval protocol as outlined above. Importantly, these conditions have been proven to work well in both, cyclophilin A singleplex and double staining approaches. Do not reduce the number of boiling steps as this might leave the antigen\\(s) largely un-retrieved and thus poorly accessible for detection. Excessive boiling on the other hand, either due to multiple boiling steps or an increase in power/temperature, might result in over-retrieved epitopes, leading to high background staining. But more often, rigorous boiling significantly increases the chance of sections dissociating from the slide, and thus should be largely avoided.15 After the last boiling step has been completed, remove the staining jar from the microwave and allow the slides to cool to room temperature on benchtop for ~30 min.\nCAUTION Be careful when handling hot liquids.\nCRITICAL STEP Do not omit this step to directly proceed to immunostaining. Cooling slides to room temperature does not only permit to handle them properly, but allows the antigens to recover from heating and importantly, reduces the likelihood of sections coming off during the subsequent staining procedure.\n16 To eliminate the retrieval buffer and to prepare sections for immunostaining, transfer slides into a staining jar with 1X DPBS and rinse three times, 5 min each.\n**Immunostaining**, Timing ~20 h\nAll subsequent steps are performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted. The blocking and antibody incubation steps are routinely carried out in a light-proof moisture chamber to prevent tissues from drying, and to protect fluorophores from light. During the set-up of the procedure, two different blocking agents have been tested for their ability to reduce non-specific binding, i.e. bovine serum albumin \\(BSA) \\(option A) and normal \\(unchallenged) serum from the host species that the secondary antibody was raised in \\(normal goat serum) \\(option B). In our hands, either condition consistently yields a good signal-to-noise ratio in both, cyclophilin A singleplex as well as double staining approaches. In summary, both options give very comparable results, making them virtually interchangeable in this procedure.17 While performing steps 15 and 16 of the procedure, prepare an appropriate amount of blocking solution \\(option A or B), enough to perform the subsequent blocking and primary antibody incubation steps \\(~200-400 \u03bcl/tissue section). Tissue sections processed in this protocol have an average size of 1.0-1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> and are typically covered with 100-200 \u03bcl reagent volume. 10 ml blocking solution is therefore sufficient to complete the maximum amount of 20 sections per run, including some extra solution to compensate for pipetting errors or other mistakes. For optimum results, prepare freshly right before use or on a daily basis.\nCRITICAL STEP Detergent-mediated permeabilization can greatly improve antibody access to antigens inside the cell, including nuclear proteins. Moreover, the addition of a harsh detergent such as Triton X-100 might also help to decrease the general background by clearing the tissue from potential non-specific binding sites. The blocking solution employed in this protocol contains 0.3% \\(v/v) Triton-X100, and has been optimized for the detection of cyclophilin A and other intracellular proteins, e.g. \u03b1-smooth muscle actin \\(SMA) or phosphorylated S6, and has been demonstrated to perform equally well for the adhesion molecule CD31. It should be noted however, that these conditions might be too harsh if co-staining of other cell surface epitopes is required, as those might get disrupted or partially dissolved, and consequently loose their antigenicity. For this, Triton X-100 could be exchanged for a somewhat milder detergent such as Tween 20 or saponin, but this has to be tested empirically.\n18 Humidify the moisture chamber by adding dH<sub>2</sub>O to the bottom of each slide compartement \\(~6-7 ml). Refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for detailed information on how to humidify your incubation box.\nFor subsequent steps, process slides one after another to prevent them from drying-out.19 Remove slides from 1X DPBS \\(step 16) and quickly drain on a paper towel to remove most of the excess liquid. Do not allow slides to dry completely.\n20 Using a liquid-repellent slide marker, draw a narrow circle around the tissue section and wait for ~5-10 sec. \nCAUTION The pen contains hazardous ingredients including bromopropane and ligroin \\(a fraction of petroleum). Avoid contact with skin and eyes and wear gloves.\nCRITICAL STEP Liquid-repellent slide markers can be used to draw hydrophobic barriers on glass slides that confine the flow of a reagent to a defined area, providing a water-resistant containment to which various reagents can be applied. They are extremely useful in this procedure and allow to independently process two sections on the same slide \\(e.g. specific staining and respective reagent control). Moreover, they help to save precious reagents and to locate the tissue after mounting. It should be noted however, that it is essential that slides are not allowed to dry out during any time of the staining procedure. For the liquid blocker to be applied, slides need not to be dry, and the markings can be well drawn on wet slides. The hydrophobic properties of the barrier will force the residual 1X DPBS on the slide towards the center of the encircled area, preventing the tissue from drying out. Markings are insoluble in aqueous buffers, detergents, alcohol and acetone but can be removed with xylene, if necessary. Shake pen well before use.\n21 Shake off any residual 1X DPBS from the slides and transfer them to the moisture chamber. If excessive amounts of 1X DPBS are left, especially on top of the sections, carefully pipette them off. Do not allow the tip to touch the tissue.22 Immediately apply ~100-200 \u03bcl blocking solution \\(option A or B) to the sections. Add dropwise. Make sure to not only cover the tissue itself but the entire area encircled by the hydrophobic barrier. If applied correctly, the liquid will form a dome-shaped small heap within the markings.\nCRITICAL STEP For teratoma tissue engrafted into mouse skeletal muscle, blocking option A and B perform equally well in our hands, and are thus mutually exchangeable. This might also be due to the fact that monoclonal primaries are used which in general show reduced cross-reactivity towards unrelated epitopes. If other tissues are injected, or if double stainings with polyclonals are planned, option B might give better results but this has to be tested empirically.  \n23 Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\n24 While blocking, prepare primary antibody and isotype control. \nA. First option: singleplex staining \\(cyclophilin A only)\ni. Dilute Cyclophilin A \\(D2Y4M) rabbit monoclonal antibody in blocking solution \\(option A or B) to a final concentration of 1.3 \u03bcg/ml. Mix gently by inverting and spin down briefly. Keep at 4\u00b0C until ready to proceed.CRITICAL STEP For optimum results, do not switch the type of blocking solution between blocking and antibody incubation steps, i.e. option A to B or B to A. The given working concentration is based upon antibody titration to obtain a high signal-to-noise ratio in cyclophilin A single and double stainings. It lies within the range of commonly applied concentrations \\(~0.5-10 \u03bcg/ml, occasionally up to 25 \u03bcg/ml) but at the lower end, with relatively small amounts of antibody being sufficient to achieve a good staining. For lot #1 of the antibody, which has been used throughout, this working concentration corresponds to a dilution of 1:100, i.e. 1-2 \u03bcl cyclophilin A antibody per 100-200 \u03bcl blocking solution per tissue section. At Cell Signaling Technology, antibody concentrations are lot-specific and may vary between two different lots of the same antibody. Hence, if using a different lot, do not dilute according to the ratio notation but always refer to the antibody concentration of the respective lot to calculate the amount of antibody actually required. Lot-specific antibody concentrations are available upon request \\(support@cellsignal.com). Be aware that knowledge of the actual working concentration is a prerequisite for the correct application of isotype controls. For best results, stick to the conditions specified above. No further optimization of antibody concentration is required.ii. Pre-dilute rabbit \\(DA1E) monoclonal IgG \\(isotype control) 1:20 in 1X DPBS to a concentration of 125 \u03bcg/ml, and further dilute in blocking solution \\(option A or B) to a final concentration of 1.3 \u03bcg/ml. This corresponds to 1.04-2.08 \u03bcl pre-diluted rabbit IgG per 100-200 \u03bcl blocking solution per tissue section. Mix gently by inverting and spin down briefly. Keep at 4\u00b0C until ready to proceed. Pre-diluted IgG can be aliquoted into working volumes and stored at -20\u00b0C for further use. Thaw only once, with the remainder kept at 4\u00b0C for ~1-2 weeks.\n CRITICAL STEP Always make sure that the primary antibody and the respective isotype control are concentration- \\(not dilution-) matched. Incorrect dilution of the isotype control can cause either false-positive or false-negative results. Pre-dilution of the control IgG is recommended to avoid inaccuracy through pipetting errors. For lot-independent concentration of the rabbit IgG, see the datasheet or the supplier\u2019s homepage \\(https://www.cellsignal.com/)\nB. Second option: double staining \\(cyclophilin A and SMA), simultaneous protocol\ni. Prepare cyclophilin A antibody as described above \\(step 24, A, i) and add SMA \\(1A4) mouse monoclonal antibody to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml. This corresponds to 1-2 \u03bcl SMA antibody per 100-200 \u03bcl cyclophilin A antibody-containing blocking solution per tissue section. Mix gently by inverting and spin down briefly. Keep at 4\u00b0C until ready to proceed.\nii. Prepare rabbit isotype control as described above \\(step 24, A, ii) and add mouse \\(MOPC-173) monoclonal IgG<sub>2a</sub> \\(isotype control) to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml. This corresponds to 2-4 \u03bcl mouse IgG<sub>2a</sub> per 100-200 \u03bcl rabbit IgG-containing blocking solution per tissue section. Mix gently by inverting and spin down briefly. Keep at 4\u00b0C until ready to proceed.25 After blocking is completed, remove slides from the moisture chamber and quickly tilt, long edge down, to drain off the blocking buffer. Using a small piece of paper towel, carefully blot off the liquid next to the hydrophobic barrier. Do not allow slides to dry completely. \n \n26 Put slides back in the moisture chamber and immediately apply 100-200 \u03bcl diluted primary antibody or isotype control to the sections. Make sure to use sufficient volumes. To protect against spill-out during long-term incubation, a second hydrophobic barrier can be drawn right next to the first one. Do so before antibody solutions are applied.\n27 Place the moisture chamber in a fridge or cold room, and incubate overnight \\(~16 h) at 4\u00b0C.\nCRITICAL STEP The procedure has been optimized for a low cyclophilin A antibody titer and  overnight incubation to achieve a slow but targeted binding and to reach a saturation point as possible where all antigen is bound. Incubation periods up to 24 h consistently yield good staining results. Do not reduce incubation time.\n28 On the next day, prepare a sufficient amount of blocking solution \\(option A or B) \\(~100-200 \u03bcl/tissue section). Stick to the option used the day before.\n29 Remove slides from the moisture chamber and drain off the antibody solution on a paper towel. If slides are mounted with two sections that are incubated with different antibodies and/or control reagents, take care to tilt them against their long edge to prevent solutions from blending into each other.\n30 Transfer slides into a staining jar with 1X DPBS and wash three times, 5 min each.\n31 While washing, prepare fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody.\nA. First option: singleplex staining \\(cyclophilin A only)i. Dilute Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG 1:500 in blocking solution \\(option A or B) to a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. This corresponds to 0.2-0.4 \u03bcl anti-rabbit IgG per 100-200 \u03bcl blocking solution per tissue section. Mix gently by inverting and spin down briefly. Protect from light until ready to proceed.\nB. Second option: double staining \\(cyclophilin A and SMA), simultaneous protocol\ni. Prepare Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as described above \\(step 31, A, i) and add Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:500 to yield a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. This corresponds to 0.2-0.4 \u03bcl anti-mouse IgG per 100-200 \u03bcl anti-rabbit IgG-containing blocking solution per tissue section. Mix gently by inverting and spin down briefly. Protect from light until ready to proceed.\n CRITICAL STEP The staining of mouse tissue using a mouse primary antibody is often associated with increased levels of background staining, mainly caused by the secondary antibody binding to endogenous mouse IgG or Fc receptors on tissue cells \\(e.g. macrophages). The latter can be largely eliminated by using F\\(ab')2 fragment antibodies as outlined in this procedure. See also the Materials section. The remainder of background staining is usually fixed via a separate blocking step, mostly by using commercially available kits. At this point however, it has to be noted that the mouse-on-mouse detection using this protocol \\(e.g. SMA or phosphorylated S6 on mouse cells/ mouse tissue)<sup>7</sup> did not result in a decreased signal-to-noise ratio. However, if other tissues are injected, an additional blocking step might be required.\n32 After the last washing step is completed, remove slides from 1X DPBS and shake off excess liquid. Place slides in the moisture chamber and immediately add 100-200 \u03bcl diluted fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody onto the sections.\n33 Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.34 Remove slides from the moisture chamber and drain off the antibody solution on a paper towel. Transfer slides into a staining jar with 1X DPBS and wash three times, 5 min each.\nCRITICAL STEP Thorough washing of sections between and after antibody incubation steps is crucial to minimize background staining and to contrast the specific signal. For optimal results, do neither reduce the number nor the duration of washing steps.\n35 While washing, prepare an appropriate amount \\(~30-40 ml) of DAPI working solution and transfer into a staining jar.\n36 Remove slides from 1X DPBS and quickly drain on a paper towel. Counterstain sections by immersing slides for 3-5 min. Alternatively, 100-200 \u03bcl DAPI solution can be directly applied to the sections. Do not incubate for more than 5-8 min. The DAPI solution can be re-used for several times when stored at 4\u00b0C. However, for consistent results prepare solutions freshly right before use.  \n37 Carefully drain off the DAPI solution and rinse slides once in 1X DPBS for 5 min. Keep slides in 1X DPBS until ready to perform coverslipping.\n38 Apply ~4-8 20 \u03bcl-drops of antifade mounting medium directly to a coverslip.\n39 Remove slides from 1X DPBS and quickly drain on a paper towel. Eliminate residual liquid by vigorously shaking it off. Lay slides, section side down, over the coverslip. Absorb excess mounting medium with a paper towel.CRITICAL STEP Store mounted slides flat or on the edge at 4\u00b0C protected from light, e.g. in a slide folder or slide box, until further processed. Sections are ready for viewing and image taking right after coverslipping but for best results, store overnight \\(8-12 h) at 4\u00b0C. Cyclophilin A-stained samples are typically assessed within 2-5 days but might be stored longer \\(2-3 weeks). The aqueous mounting medium is non-hardening, i.e. it remains liquid on the slide and does not solidify. Mounted slides are usually stored without sealing. However, for long-term storage, coverslips can be sealed with nail polish or an appropriate sealant.\n40 Subject slides to microscopic evaluation.\nCRITICAL STEP For optimum results, run a pilot experiment with a limited number of samples to establish an appropriate imaging protocol which can be used throughout experimentation. This protocol typically includes parameters such as excitation intensity, detector gain and exposure time, and many more. If available, a transmitted light imaging mode \\(e.g. phase contrast) should be incorporated into these settings. The phase contrast and confocal epifluorescence images can be acquired simultaneously, and when merged, give valuable information about the precise location of the labeled cells within the tissue. This feature is especially helpful for studies of the teratoma/tumor microenvironment since it allows to track host cell infiltration, and at the same time to evaluate its impact on tissue properties and condition. Always use the same imaging and post-acquisition protocols to analyse your samples of interest and the respective positive and/or negative controls.", "CRITICAL STEP: During the whole procedure it is crucial to keep all working spaces sterile.\n**Faecal sample dilution** \uf0a8\nTIMING: 5 min per sample\n1| Weigh the faecal material \\(\uf0bb50 mg) and add 500 \u03bcL of sterile PBS to attain a 10% \\(m/v) suspension.\n**Sample homogenisation** \nTIMING: 1 min per sample\n2| Set the MINILYS homogeniser for 3000 rpm \\(speed 1) for 60 seconds using 2 mL tubes with O-ring\ncaps.\nCRITICAL STEP: Tubes should not have any type of beads, this results in massive loss of viruses.

Similarly for samples with a high level of input material, 12 cycles can be used.\n29| Mix 0.5 \u03bcL of Library Synthesis Solution with 2.82 \u03bcL of extracted viral sample by pipetting and incubate in a thermocycler programmed for 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes then cool down to 18\u00b0C.\n30| To the cooled-primed DNA and RNA \\(18\u00b0C) sample, immediately add the following:\n0.78 \u03bcL RNAse free water\n0.5 \u03bcL Library Synthesis Buffer\n0.4 \u03bcL Library Synthesis Enzyme\n31| Mix and incubate in a thermocycler programmed for:\n18\u00b0C for 10 minutes \n25\u00b0C for 10 minutes \n37\u00b0C for 30 minutes \n42\u00b0C for 10 minutes \n70\u00b0C for 20 minutes \n4\u00b0C\n32| To the DNA library add the following mix to each sample:\n7.5 \u03bcL Amplification mix \n60.2 \u03bcL RNAse free water\n1.5 \u03bcL WTA dNTP mix \n0.75 \u03bcL Amplification enzyme \n33| Mix by pipetting and incubate in a thermocycler programmed for:\n94\u00b0C for 2 minutes.\n**94\u00b0C for 30 seconds**\n**70\u00b0C for 5 minutes**   **x17 cycles**\n34| Purify the PCR product using any standard PCR purification kit.

Assembly of Probe to Stiffener\n\tThis section of the protocol describes fabrication of a silicon stiffener, and the assembly of a thin-film polymer probe to the stiffener. Figure 1 illustrates a typical polymer neural probe along with the proposed stiffener. The details of the stiffener design are shown in Figure 2. The novel feature of this design is the shallow \"wicking\" channel running along its length which is used to distribute liquid adhesive during assembly. The wider portion of the stiffener is a tab for handling during assembly and surgical insertion. A reservoir on the tab connects to the channel. The component is fabricated from silicon using standard microfabrication processes.\n\t\tThe silicon stiffener with a wicking channel was fabricated from a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer with a device layer thickness equal to the desired thickness of the stiffener (Figure 3A). A reasonable range of stiffener thickness is 20-100 \u03bcm. It is recommended that the width of the stiffener be 20-30 \u03bcm smaller than the probe width, which helps to prevent overflow of the adhesive from the bond interface to the top of the probe. First the wicking channels are dry-etched using the standard Bosch process (Figure 3B). Next, the stiffener geometry is defined by a longer etch that stops on the buried oxide layer (Figure 3C). Finally, the stiffeners are released by wet-etching the buried oxide layer in 49% hydrofluoric acid (Figure 3D). After thoroughly rinsing the stiffeners, soak them in deionized water for 15 min.\n\t\tPlace a pellet of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of molecular weight 10,000 g/mol into the reservoir (Figure 4). Heat the stiffener to 65 \u00b0C so that the PEG melts and wicks into the channel by capillary action. Then cool to room temperature to solidify.Figure 5 shows a schematic of the flip chip bonder set up. Place the stiffener upside down on the base stage of the flip chip bonder, then pick up the stiffener with the tool head. Place the probe upside down on the base stage. Using the flip chip bonder, align the stiffener and the probe and then lower the stiffener and place it onto the probe.\n\t\tThe base stage of the flip chip bonder should have a heating element to apply heat to the substrate. After placing the stiffener, heat the assembly once again to 65 \u00b0C. Allow one minute for the PEG to remelt and begin to fill in the interface between the probe and stiffener. Cool to solidify.\n\t\tTurn the assembly over and inspect from the top. Reheat as needed to allow the PEG to completely fill the interface between the probe and the stiffener. This can be visually evaluated since the probe is transparent. As the assembly is sitting on the heater top- (probe-) side up, manually place 1-3 extra pellets of solid PEG onto the tab so that they melt over the probe, providing additional reinforcement in this region (Figure 6). Finally, allow the assembly to cool so that the PEG solidifies. At this point, the assembly is ready for surgical insertion.\n\t2. Insertion and Extraction\n\t\tMount the probe-stiffener assembly to a micromanipulator as illustrated in Figure 7A by adhering the back of the stiffener to the micromanipulator arm at the tab region. This may be done with double-sided tape or cement, but take care not to contact the probe with adhesive. Temporarily secure the connector end of the probe to the micromanipulator with a small piece of adhesive putty such that it can be easily removed with low force.Position the probe assembly over the target and insert the probe with the desired insertion speed. Insertion speeds of 0.13-0.5 mm/sec were used when developing this protocol.\n\t\tImmediately remove the connector end of the probe from the micromanipulator gently and rest it on a nearby surface, such as a second manipulator arm (Figure 7B). This must be done before the PEG begins to dissolve to avoid displacing the probe.\n\t\tAllow time for PEG to dissolve. This amount of time will depend on PEG molecular weight and area of contact between the probe and stiffener. For example, with PEG molecular weight of 10,000 g/mol, a microelectrode probe about 6 mm and a matching stiffener that is 306 \u03bcm wide, 15 min has been found to be an adequate amount of time. Section 3 of the protocol presents a method to test the required dissolution time. During this time, apply phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using a dropper around the tab and insertion point to dissolve any PEG that is above the target (Figure 7C).\n\t\tUsing a motorized micropositioner, begin extraction of the stiffener by applying a displacement of 100 \u03bcm at a speed of 5 mm/sec. This initial fast motion helps to overcome any static friction and minimize probe displacement. Then, complete the stiffener extraction at a slower speed of approximately 0.1 mm/second (Figure 7D).\n\t\tIn the case of an actual surgery, continue with normal procedures to apply gel, silicone, and/or dental acrylic at the insertion site to secure and protect the probe, as demonstrated in 21.\n\t3. Agarose Gel TestThis section of the protocol describes a set up and procedure to examine the extraction of the stiffener in a 0.6% agarose gel that approximates the bulk mechanical properties, pH, and salinity of brain tissue 17,22. Since the gel is nearly transparent through short distances, stiffener separation and probe displacement can be observed.\n\t\tPrepare a solution of 0.6% agarose in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Mix at an elevated temperature to completely dissolve the agarose powder. Pour the solution into a shallow acrylic box; gel should be 3/4- 1 in deep. Allow to the gel set at room temperature for an hour.\n\t\tEnsure that the hardened gel is saturated with PBS so that it does not dry out, and heat the gel to 37 \u00b0C.\n\t\tSet up the micromanipulator, box of agarose gel, and microscopic camera system as shown in Figure 8.\n\t\tInsert a glass reference fiducial into the box of gel by sliding it between the gel and the side of the box (Figure 8). Use a dental pick to square the features on the reference fiducial to the field of view of the digital microscope.\nMount the probe assembly to the micromanipulator as described in step 2.1.\nPosition the probe assembly over the gel about 1 mm behind the reference fiducial.\nInsert the probe into the gel, using the camera to guide it to a desired depth in the field of view.\nImmediately move the connector end of the probe to rest on a nearby surface.\n\t\tMake any required adjustments to the camera image to focus on the probe (the reference fiducial features may be slightly out of focus). Take a snapshot of the probe location.Allow PEG to dissolve (this time may vary, and in fact may be a parameter to be tested). Apply PBS near the tab to dissolve PEG that is above the gel.\n\t\tStart video capture if desired, and begin extraction of the stiffener as described in step 2.5. When extraction is complete, take a final snapshot of probe location.\n\t\tUse image processing tools to compare the images before and after stiffener extraction. Use the features on the reference fiducial that are visible in the field of view to register (align) the images. Calibrate the scale of the image based on the size of known features on the probe. Measure the distance of probe displacement.\nSubscription Required.

This will orient the tissue so that the blade cuts parallel to the dorsoventral/septotemporal plane.\nSubmerge the disc inside the buffer tray.\nNote: Orient the disc so that the tissue is sliced from the septal to the temporal end (or vice versa) rather than from CA1 to DG (or vice versa) (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nProduce hippocampal slices using the vibratome.\nSet the thickness to 300\u00a0\u03bcm (whole-cell patch recording) or 400\u00a0\u03bcm (extracellular field recording).\n0.05\u00a0mm/s speed and 1.20\u00a0mm amplitude are recommended.\nCut away the top 500\u2013600\u00a0\u03bcm of tissue (depending on the age of the animal), and slice until the CA1 and DG are visible. When visualized under light, the CA1 is clearly visible with bare eyes.\nNote: The best longitudinal slices will contain one layer of CA1 and two layers of DG when observed under a light microscope (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J). One block of the hippocampus may produce 2\u20133 slices.\nUsing a blunted disposable pipette, gently but quickly transfer the slices into the inner chamber of the oxygenated holding chamber containing ACSF or slicing medium (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nCritical: Always keep the slices submerged. Prevent the inner chamber from floating up. Remove any air bubbles from the inner chamber using a pipette, but avoid touching the slices.\nNote: The middle part of the chamber provides the best oxygenation for slices.\nRecover slices\nTiming: 60\u00a0min\nLet the brain slices rest inside the holding chamber, which is to be continuously oxygenated.\nFor whole-cell patch recording, place the entire holding chamber inside a 32\u00b0C water bath for 30\u00a0min, then transfer it to room temperature to rest for an additional 30\u00a0min minimum.For extracellular field recording, rest the brain slices inside the holding chamber at room temperature for at least 1 h.\nSet up electrophysiology equipment\nTiming: 5\u00a0min\nTurn on the electronic equipment and computer software. The following should be set up on a vibration-free table.\nFor both whole-cell patch recording and extracellular field recording:\nMolecular Devices Axon CNS MultiClamp 700B Microelectrode Amplifier.\nAxon\u2122 Digidata 1550B Data Acquisition System.\nMolecular Devices Clampex software.\nDual-arm micromanipulator.\nPerfusion pumps.\nPerfusion temperature controller.\nFor whole-cell patch recording only:\nUltima In\u00a0Vitro Multiphoton Microscope System.\nBruker Galvanometer Driver.\nPrairie Technologies Galvanometer Control.\nBruker Prairie View software.\nFor extracellular field recording only:\nMASTER-9 Pulse Stimulator.\nISO-Flex Stimulus Isolator.\nWhole-cell patch clamp\nTiming: 1 h\nSteps 9\u201332 help achieve whole-cell patch recording of DG granule neurons (DGGCs) in longitudinal DG slices. Subsequently, focal glutamate uncaging on the dendrites of neighboring DGGCs will elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the patched cells (steps 33\u201355). EPSPs will be recorded from patched DGGCs.\nNote: DGGCs in slices may survive for up to 5\u00a0h after dissection.\nThaw an aliquot of internal solution on ice.\nConfigure the following:\nOn one arm of the micromanipulator, mount the Current Clamp and Voltage Clamp Headstage. Then attach the silver chloride recording electrode/pipette holder (do not fit the glass micropipette yet).\nAdjust the angle of the Current Clamp and Voltage Clamp Headstage to 15\u00b0 from the horizontal plane.\nAttach 1\u00a0mm diameter tubing (approx. 50\u00a0cm long) to the suction port of the pipette holder. At the other end of the tubing, attach a 1\u00a0mL syringe connected via a three-way valve.\nInsert a silver chloride reference electrode into the bath solution without touching the brain slice. Then ground the reference electrode.\nAdd picrotoxin to the ACSF perfusion solution (final concentration at 50\u00a0\u03bcM).Perfuse the specimen stage with oxygenated ACSF maintained at 31\u00b0C\u201332\u00b0C by an automatic temperature controller, supplied and discharged at a steady rate (1.5\u00a0mL/min) using peristaltic pumps.\nCritical: Check frequently to make sure that the stage does not flood and that there are no excessive vibrations or fluid currents.\nGently transfer one brain slice to the specimen stage with a blunted disposable pipette. Place a harp on top of the slice to secure its position.\nNote: For glutamate uncaging, the laser path should not intersect with the pipette. Mind the orientation of the slice on the specimen stage so that the laser path can reach the molecular layer of the DG blade, but it does not contact the pipette and its path during whole-cell patch recording.\nAcclimatize the slice on the specimen stage for an additional 30\u00a0min.\nVisualize one slice with a 10\u00d7 air objective under bright-field illumination. Check that the fluid level is stable and that there are no vibrations that could interfere with the patch process.\nSwitch to a 40\u00d7 water immersion objective. Locate the dorsal blade (the DG layer closer to CA1).\nNote: DG granule cells can be identified by the densely packed arrangement of their soma into rows, which appear darker in color under bright-field illumination (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nSwitch to a water immersion 40\u00d7 objective and find a healthy cell to patch. Mark the position of the cell with masking tape on the computer monitor.\nNote: Healthy cells have oval-shaped soma. Unhealthy cells have shrunken, misshapen, or circular-shaped (swollen) soma with visible nuclear membranes and nucleolus. Unhealthy cells may also have a dark \u2018shadow\u2019 around the soma.\nAdd Alexa Fluor 594 to the K-based internal solution (20\u201350\u00a0\u03bcM) and backfill the pulled glass micropipette with the mixed solution.Aspirate internal solution into a 1\u00a0mL syringe.\nAttach a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm membrane filter to the syringe.\nAttach a 70\u00a0mm blunt tip microcannula to the filter.\nGently tap the patch pipette to remove any air bubbles from the tip.\nAttach the filled micropipette onto the pipette holder, making sure that the silver chloride wire touches the solution.\nSet to voltage-clamp mode [VC] on [MultiClamp 700B commander]. Load the [Membrane Test] function on [Clampex] software and set it to [Bath] mode.\nApply constant positive pressure inside the pipette by injecting a small amount of air with the 1\u00a0mL syringe (approximately 0.2\u00a0mL).\nCarefully position the patch pipette into the bath solution between the objective and the brain slice.\nLift the objective until it just remains in contact with the bath solution (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Do not adjust the X and Y-axis positions of the stage, so you know where to approach the pipette.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2335-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Schematic diagram of how to approach a target neuron with a patch pipette\n(A) The water immersion 40\u00d7 objective is raised up while maintaining contact with the bath solution.\n(B) The patch pipette is positioned under the objective so that the shank becomes visible.\n(C) The tip of the pipette is found under the microscope.\n(D) The patch pipette and objective are lowered simultaneously until the pipette tip is just above the target neuron.\nWith a fine control mode of the micromanipulator, position the patch pipette just below the lens until it becomes visible as a shadow under the microscope (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: Keep the pipette tip clean by not touching it with anything but the brain slice.\nAs soon as the pipette touches the bath solution, click [Auto] under [Pipette Offset] on [MultiClamp 700B] software.Check the tip resistance. The Rt in [Clampex] [Membrane Test], as well as the Resistance in [MultiClamp], should be the same.\nFor DGGCs, target the tip resistance to be 5\u20137 M\u03a9 for whole-cell patch recording and 3\u20134\u00a0M\u03a9 for extracellular field recording.\nCheck the waveform of the membrane current and remove any electrical noise (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\u00a0\u2013 problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]) by monitoring the [Scope] window (10\u201320 kHz sampling rate).\nMove the patch pipette until the tip becomes clearly visible under the microscope (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCheck that the tip is not broken and that there are no debris or air bubbles inside.\nLower the pipette towards the slice while maintaining the tip in focus (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Use a finer control mode on the micromanipulator and the fine adjustment knob of the microscope.\nOnce the target neuron and pipette tip are visible at almost the same Z-axis position, focus on the target neuron and slowly approach the pipette towards the cell.\nWhen they come into contact, the positive pressure inside the pipette should produce a slight dent on the cell surface. The current pulse shown on the [Membrane Test] should also start to decrease.\nCell attachment\u00a0\u2013 Immediately apply gentle suction by pulling out the syringe plunger or via mouth pipetting. The cell is successfully attached when the tip resistance reaches at least 1\u20135 G\u03a9.\nNote: Holding the membrane potential at -81\u00a0mV in [MultiClamp], which is the typical resting membrane potential of DGGCs, helps to counteract membrane hyperexcitability that may occur immediately after breaking into a patched cell. The seal should form within around 1\u00a0min.\nClick Cp Fast: [Auto] in [MultiClamp] to correct for fast capacitance.\nBreak-in\u00a0\u2013 Apply more potent suction to rupture the cell membrane.Optional: Use the [Zap] function in [MultiClamp] to deliver a pulse that may help with membrane rupture.\n1\u00a0min later, switch to current-clamp mode [IC] and measure the resting membrane potential (mV).\nConfiguration of two-photon laser microscope\nTiming: 15\u00a0min\nConfigure a two-photon laser microscope (e.g., Bruker Ultima In\u00a0Vitro two-photon microscope) equipped with two lasers (e.g., Coherent Chameleon Ultra Ti: Sapphire), each of which is tuned to an excitation wavelength of 810\u00a0nm (for image acquisition) or 720\u00a0nm (for glutamate poststimulation) and modulated by an electro-optic modulator (or Pockel cell, Conotopics, M350).\nNote: It may take approx. 10\u00a0min for the laser to warm up after turning on the power.\nNote: The microscope is set up so that the epi-fluorescent and trans-fluorescent signals are captured through a 60\u00d7, 1.0 N.A. objective and a 1.4 N.A. oil-immersion condenser (Olympus). The fluorescence is split into red and green channels using dichroic mirrors and band-pass filters (ET545/30\u00d7 and ET620/60 m, dichroic T570LP; ET470/40\u00d7 and ET525/50\u00a0m dichroic T495LPXR). Red fluorescence (Alexa Fluor 594) signals are captured using R9110 photomultiplier tubes. Prairie View 5.4 software (Bruker) is used for image acquisition and photostimulation.\nTwo-photon imaging of a patched neuron and its neurites\nTiming: 45\u00a0min\nSteps 34\u201343 allow high-resolution visualization of a single DG neuron that was patched in steps 9\u201332.\nExternal light sources should be minimized in a darkened room, including any halogen light sources.\nSwitch to a 60\u00d7 objective lens.\nOn [Clampex], run a pre-configured protocol to inject the threshold current (pA) once every 10\u00a0s for 5\u00a0min.\nThe threshold current is determined as the lowest current level required to induce a single action potential.\nConstant threshold current (pA) is applied for 100\u00a0ms.Note: This process helps to monitor neuronal viability and promotes the fluorescence dye to spread to distal dendrites for clear visualization.\nIn the main window of [Prairie View 5.4] software:\nStart with 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 in [Image Resolution] field.\nActivate [Ch1 (Channel 1)] button in [Image Window].\nClick on [Live Scan] in [Scanning] field.\nIn [Power/Gain] tab, increase the power of the [Imaging] laser by clicking the right arrowhead.\nCritical: Increase the power one by one to prevent photodamaging the brain slice with the high laser intensity.\nIn [Power/Gain] tab, adjust the PMT intensity until an appropriate amount of brightness is visible in [Image Window].\nDefine a region of interest around the cell body of the patched neuron and its neurites.\nSet [Image resolution] at 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512 with [Average Every] 4 Frames in [Scanning] field or 1024\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01024 with 2 Frames.\nOptional: Increasing [Dwell Time Per Pixel (\u03bcs)] may give a clearer image.\nTo obtain serial Z-stack images of the patched neuron and its neurites, configure settings in the [Z-Series] tab as below:\nBring the microscope focus to the very top of the neuron (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.a), then click the imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2335-Fx4.jpg button to set the [Start Position (\u03bcm)].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2335-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04.

To maintain a stable whole-cell configuration, the pipette position may need to be readjusted at least every 5\u00a0min to stay close to the cell body (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nZ-stack images are automatically saved in a folder defined by the user. Alternatively, the brightness or contrast can be adjusted for individual images and later use [ImageJ] software to create a stack with specified images.\nGlutamate uncaging at presynaptic neurons\nTiming: 2\u00a0hSteps 44\u201352 describe the procedure for evoking an EPSP in the patched DG neuron by photostimulation of another DG neuron(s) located in the same DG layer (ventral or dorsal). Steps 53 and 54 repeat the procedure with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) to confirm that the EPSP was evoked by the vesicular release of neurotransmitters from the photostimulated DG neuron.\nFreshly prepare 500\u00a0\u03bcM MNI-caged-L-glutamate in ACSF solution and perfuse it into the recording chamber. Wait at least 3\u00a0min for the solution to diffuse entirely throughout the recording chamber (for a perfusion speed of 1.5\u00a0mL/min).\nCritical: Maintain a stable whole-cell configuration during the whole experiment.\nVisualize the unstained brain slice without a halogen light source using Dodt Gradient Contrast (DGC), which improves the contrast of images.\nDeactivate [Ch1 (Channel 1)] in [Image Window] and activate [DODT] button.\nIn [Misc] tab, change [Mirror] to [In] in [Dodt Detector] field.\nClick [Live Scan] in [Scanning] field.\nFind a target area to apply photostimulation (glutamate uncaging), which should contain neurons that are highly likely to have synaptic connections with the patched neuron.\nTarget the molecular layer (ML) hundreds of microns away from a patched neuron.\nBe careful not to shoot the laser on the patch pipette.\nRefer to the imaging to make sure that the target area excludes any dendrites extending from the patched neuron.\nNote: A hippocampal longitudinal slice contains two distinct layers of dentate gyrus granule cells (GC), which are the dorsal and ventral blades of granule cell layers.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Therefore, target the molecular layer that is continued from the granule cell layer of the patched granule neuron. For example, do not apply photostimulation on the molecular layer that extends from the ventral blade of GC layer, if you have patched a neuron in the dorsal blade of GC layer (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).Open [Mark Points] from [Image Window] and configure the settings as follows:\nBe sure to optimize the laser duration, power, number of stimulation spots, and dot size beforehand to ensure that they can elicit an action potential in a neuron.\nStart by applying the minimum power (10 mW) for 1\u00a0ms laser duration and increase incrementally.\nRest the slices for 30\u00a0s between stimulations to avoid hyperexcitation and to give time for presynaptic neurons to recover neurotransmitter vesicles.\n3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 grid of point stimulation (5\u00a0ms laser duration, 10\u00a0\u03bcm spot spacing, and various interpoint delays,\u00a0>\u00a00.12\u00a0ms) at an average power of 42 mW (ranging from 7.5 to 78.08 mW) was used previously3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; the spot size ranged from a diffraction-limited spot of 0.2\u20131\u00a0mm (with laser intensity and objective dependency).\nMake sure to set [First Repetition] under [Wait for Trigger] as well as [Start with external trigger (Trig 1)] under [Trigger Selection] for the Mark Points to hold until you run the protocol under [IC] mode in [Clampex] software that records excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).\nStop [Live Scan].\nClick [Run Mark Points].\nOn Clampex, click [Record] and visualize the EPSP.\nRest the slices for 30\u00a0s between stimulations.\nIf an EPSP was evoked, place the stimulation point grid in the middle of [Image Window] and record the position    P 2  =  (   x 2  ,  y 2  ,  z 2   )    under [Stage Control].Calculate the distance between the patched neuron and the glutamate uncaging spot (the spot\u00a0where EPSPs are evoked) (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). The approximate distance between two points    P 1  =  (   x 1  ,  y 1  ,  z 1   )    and    P 2  =  (   x 2  ,  y 2  ,  z 2   )    in a three-dimensional space is calculated by the following generalized distance formula:\n      d ( P  1  ,  P 2   )  =     (   x 2  \u2212  x 1   )  2  +   (   y 2  \u2212  y 1   )  2  +   (   z 2  \u2212  z 1   )  2     \nTo confirm that the EPSP was evoked from presynaptic vesicular release, add 0.1\u00a0mM cadmium chloride (CdCl2) to the perfusate and wait a few minutes for it to diffuse entirely throughout the recording chamber.\nRepeat steps 45\u201350 at the position    P 2    and record EPSPs under the effect of CdCl2.\nNote: CdCl2 blocks chemical synaptic transmissions at presynaptic terminals. If the photostimulated neurons (presynaptic neurons excited by uncaged glutamate) have synaptic connections to the patched neuron (postsynaptic neuron), the peak amplitude of EPSPs of the patched neurons should decrease or disappear after the application of CdCl2. As the effects of CdCl2 are reversible, recovery of EPSPs can be observed if steps 45\u201350 are again repeated without CdCl2.\nAfter the experiment, analyze the peak amplitudes of all EPSPs offline using [Clampfit] software.\nExtracellular field recording\nTiming: 45\u00a0min\nExtracellular field recording using longitudinal DG slices allows assessment of the long-term synaptic plasticity of the DG-DG network. Steps 56\u201369 help to prepare brain slices for extracellular field recording.\nAfter producing 400\u00a0\u03bcm-thick brain slices, set up the electrophysiology equipment as follows:\nOn one arm of the micromanipulator, secure the concentric bipolar microelectrode (stimulating electrode) that is connected to the electrical stimulus isolator.On the other arm, mount the Current Clamp and Voltage Clamp Headstage (recording electrode headstage, angled at 20\u00b0). Backfill the pulled capillary pipette (recording electrode) with ACSF and mount the glass micropipette to the Headstage.\nAdd picrotoxin to the ACSF perfusion solution (final concentration at 50\u00a0\u03bcM).\nPerfuse the specimen stage with oxygenated ACSF maintained at 31\u00b0C\u201332\u00b0C by an automatic temperature controller, supplied and discharged at a steady rate (1.5\u00a0mL/min) using peristaltic pumps.\nCritical: Check frequently to make sure that the stage does not flood and that there are no excessive vibrations or fluid currents.\nGently transfer one brain slice to the specimen stage with a blunted disposable pipette. Place a harp on top of the slice to secure its position.\nAcclimatize the slice on the specimen stage for an additional 30\u00a0min.\nLocate the dorsal DG blade under a 10\u00d7 objective.\nLoad the [Membrane Test] function on [Clampex software].\nRecord the tip resistance as you lower the recording electrode with the micromanipulator until it touches the solution.\nReplace the glass tip if the resistance is out of the desired range (3\u20134 M\u03a9).\nVisualize the signals on the Scope window at a 10\u201320 kHz sampling rate to check for electrical noise.\nNoise range within 0.2\u00a0mV is acceptable.

The DM RC is a derivative of the wild type RC, where all native Cys are replaced with Ala or Ser (C(H156)A, C(H234)S, C(L92)S, C(L108)S, C(L247)S) (Mahmoudzadeh et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]); two Cys are introduced in hydrophilic regions to promote binding to a gold surface via a gold-thiol covalent bond (Jun et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nNote: This step is based on a previous protocol (Jun et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nDay 1. In a test tube, inoculate 10\u00a0mL LB supplemented with kanamycin at a final concentration of 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL with a few crystals from a glycerol freezer stock of R.\u00a0sphaeroides cells containing the pIND4-DM plasmid encoding the DM RC. Grow for approximately 24\u00a0h at 30\u00b0C, shaken or rotated on a wheel.\nDay 2. Add the 10\u00a0mL overnight culture to a 1\u00a0L Erlenmeyer flask containing 200\u00a0mL LB supplemented with kanamycin at a final concentration of 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Grow for approximately 24\u00a0h at 30\u00b0C, shaken at 200 RPM.\nDay 3. Split the 200\u00a0mL overnight culture into four 50\u00a0mL aliquots. Use these aliquots to add to four 2\u00a0L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500\u00a0mL RLB supplemented with kanamycin at a final concentration of 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. To each flask, add isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1\u00a0mM to induce protein production. Grow for 16\u00a0h at 30\u00b0C, shaken at 200 RPM.\nDay 4. At the end of the 16\u00a0h induction period, optical density (OD650) of the cell culture should be 1.5\u20132 and orange-red in colour.Pellet cells by centrifuging at 12000\u00d7g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in a J-LITE JLA 8.1000 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent.\nDiscard the supernatant and weigh the cell pellet (wet mass). Typical yields are 7\u00a0g cell pellet per L culture.\nPause point: If necessary, the pellets can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for up to 6\u00a0months.\nPurification of the DM RCs\nTiming: 3\u00a0days\nThis step extracts and purifies the DM RCs from the cell pellet. Keep the sample and buffers on ice or 4\u00b0C throughout the duration of the purification process.\nDay 1. Resuspend the cell pellet by stirring in the resuspension buffer, using 2\u00a0mL of buffer per gram of cell pellet (e.g., resuspend a 7\u00a0g pellet with 14\u00a0mL buffer).\nIf the pellet is frozen, add the resuspension buffer to thaw before resuspending by stirring.\nLyse the cell suspension using a French pressure cell press chilled to 4\u00b0C. Maintain a pressure between 22500 and 25000 PSI.\nNote: Ensure that the lysate is not very viscous. Lysate should flow easily in well-defined drops. A gooey lysate indicates that not enough DNase was added. Add a few more crystals of DNase to the lysate and stir gently (to not cause frothing) for 1\u20132\u00a0min. Ensure that lysate is no longer viscous before proceeding to the next step.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 10000\u00d7g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in a JA-20 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent.\nNote: The pellet contains unwanted whole cells and large cell membrane fragments. The chromatophores, containing the RCs, are found in the supernatant.\nPipette the supernatant into a separate beaker. Note the supernatant volume.Using a magnetic stir bar, stir the supernatant in the dark at room temperature (19\u00b0C\u201321\u00b0C and add 30% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide solution (LDAO) (w/v) dropwise to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). Add 2\u00a0M imidazole to a final concentration of 5\u00a0mM. Stir for 20\u201330\u00a0min.\nCentrifuge the solubilized solution at 164000\u00d7g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in a Type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent.\nNote: The pellet contains insolubilized cell membrane fragments and precipitated proteins. Solubilized RCs are found in the supernatant.\nPipette the supernatant (avoid the loose pellet) into a new beaker.\nNote: To ensure that RCs are present in the supernatant, dilute (10-fold) the supernatant with the wash buffer and measure the absorbance spectrum (250\u00a0nm\u20131000\u00a0nm). Absorbance peaks should be present at 760, 804, and 860\u00a0nm (corresponding to the cofactors in the RCs), as shown in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] (blue trace).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Absorbance spectra of 10-fold dilutions of solubilized RCs prior to incubation with the Ni2+-NTA resin (precolumn sample, blue) and following incubation with the Ni2+-NTA resin (column flowthrough, red)\nThe decrease in absorbance at 804\u00a0nm in the flowthrough compared to the precolumn sample indicates successful binding of the RCs to the resin.\nCritical: The supernatant should not be turbid. Turbidity indicates that proteins are precipitating and will clog the column in subsequent steps. If turbidity is observed, centrifuge again at 164000\u00d7g for 20\u00a0mins at 4\u00b0C in a Type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent. Further addition of LDAO or imidazole is not recommended. Ensure the supernatant is on ice and work quickly.\nEquilibrate clean Ni2+-NTA agarose resin (approximately 4\u20135\u00a0mL of resin in a gravity column) with 2 column volumes wash buffer. Transfer the resin into a 50\u00a0mL conical tube.Add the supernatant to the 50\u00a0mL conical tube containing the equilibrated resin. Rock gently overnight (15\u201318 h) in the dark at 4\u00b0C.\nDay 2. Pour the overnight resin suspension onto a gravity column. Allow liquid to flow through into a clean beaker.\nMeasure the absorbance spectrum of the flowthrough, diluted 10-fold in wash buffer.\nNote: Compare this spectrum of the flowthrough to the spectrum of the starting material supernatant. The 804\u00a0nm peak should be much smaller in the flowthrough, indicating that RCs have bound to the resin (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: The binding of the RCs, which are dark purple in colour, should cause the Ni2+-NTA agarose resin to also turn dark purple. (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. The Ni2+-NTA agarose resin appears dark purple in colour after the binding of RCs\nAdd wash buffer continuously to the column.\nMeasure the absorbance spectrum of the flowthrough, undiluted, after approximately 5 column volumes of wash buffer, then every 50\u2013100\u00a0mL of wash buffer.\nMonitor the absorbance at 280\u00a0nm. Wash until this value plateaus to <0.05 AU, then allow the wash buffer to drain to the surface of the resin (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Absorbance spectra of column washes during purification by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography\nSpectra are measured approximately every 5\u201310 column volumes and shows a decrease in absorbance at 280\u00a0nm with continued washing.\nNote: The absorbance at 280\u00a0nm indicates the presence of proteins, due to aromatic amino acids (Trp, Tyr, Phe).\nAdd 5 column volumes of elution buffer to the column, then allow the buffer to flow slowly.\nMonitor the colour of the eluent. Once a pale purple colour is visible (i.e., A804 >0.015 AU), start collecting the sample. Collect until the flowthrough is no longer coloured.Measure the absorbance spectrum of the elution, diluted 20- or 50-fold in elution buffer. A clean protein will have an A280:A804 ratio of <1.4.\nCritical: If the A280:A804 ratio is <1.4, proceed to step 17. If the ratio is >1.4, proceed to\u00a0steps 18\u201324, where the RCs can be cleaned up further using anion exchange chromatography.\nNote: If storing RCs overnight, since there may not be enough time to complete step 17 in a single day, dilute 10-fold in wash buffer as they are less stable at the high imidazole concentrations found in the elution buffer.\nBuffer exchange the RCs into PBS pH 7.2 and 0.03% LDAO using a 15\u00a0mL 100\u00a0kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit.\nAdd the eluent (from step 16) to a 100\u00a0kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit. Centrifuge at 5000\u00d7g for 25\u00a0min at a time at 4\u00b0C in a JS-5.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent, until the volume of the retentate is less than 0.5\u00a0mL, then discard the flowthrough.\nAdd PBS to the retentate to a final volume of 15\u00a0mL. Centrifuge at 5000\u00d7g for 25\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in a JS-5.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent, or until the volume of the retentate is less than 0.5\u00a0mL, then discard the flowthrough.\nRepeat the previous step.\nNote: This step exchanges the RCs in Tris to PBS in preparation for electrochemistry.\nPause point: Store the RCs in PBS and 0.03% LDAO in the dark at 4\u00b0C for up to a week or \u221280\u00b0C for up to 2\u00a0months. If stored at \u221280\u00b0C, avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles as this will damage the protein.Day 3. If necessary (i.e., A280:A804 ratio is >1.4), an anion exchange chromatography step yields higher purity RCs (steps 18\u201324). Buffer exchange the RCs into the anion loading buffer using a 15\u00a0mL 100\u00a0kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit.\nAdd the eluent (from step 16) to a 100\u00a0kDa NMWL centrifugal filter unit. Centrifuge at 5000\u00d7g for 25\u00a0min at a time at 4\u00b0C in a JS-5.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent, until the volume of the retentate is less than 0.5\u00a0mL, then discard the flowthrough.\nAdd anion loading buffer to the retentate to a final volume of 15\u00a0mL. Centrifuge at 5000\u00d7g for 25\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in a JS-5.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or equivalent, or until the volume of the retentate is less than 0.5\u00a0mL, then discard the flowthrough.\nRepeat the previous step.\nNote: This step removes the NaCl in the elution buffer in preparation for loading onto an anion exchange chromatography column.\nEquilibrate the anion exchange resin with approximately 5 column volumes of anion loading buffer, then allow the buffer to drain to the surface of the resin.\nGently add the RCs to the column, ensuring the resin bed is not disturbed. Let the sample flow through.\nCritical: Make sure that the RCs are in a buffer that does not contain NaCl.\nAdd 5 column volumes of anion loading buffer and collect the flowthrough in approximately 5\u00a0mL aliquots.\nMeasure the absorbance spectrum of each flowthrough aliquot. Monitor the absorbance at 804\u00a0nm to determine if RCs are bound or eluting. RCs can be considered to be eluting if A804 is over 0.015 AU.\nAdd more buffer until the RCs have stopped eluting, then proceed to the next step.Repeat the previous step at increasing concentrations of NaCl: 5\u00a0mM, 10\u00a0mM, 30\u00a0mM, 60\u00a0mM, and 80\u00a0mM.\nPool the fractions of RCs with sufficient purity (i.e., A280:A804 ratio of <1.4, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Absorbance spectrum of pooled and concentrated elution fractions after purification by anion exchange chromatography\nFractions collected from the column are analyzed for the presence of RCs (A804 >0.015 AU) and for protein purity (A280:A804 <1.4).\nProceed to step 17 to buffer exchange the RCs into PBS pH 7.2.\nNote: RC concentrations can be calculated by using the Beer-Lambert law, given the extinction coefficient (\u03b5804\u00a0nm\u00a0= 288\u00a0mM\u22121-cm\u22121) for the RC (Straley et\u00a0al., 1973[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) and the absorbance value at 804\u00a0nm corresponding to the accessory bacteriochlorophylls. For example, if A804\u00a0= 0.288, then the [RC]\u00a0= 0.288 / 288\u00a0mM\u22121-cm\u22121 / 1\u00a0cm\u00a0= 1\u00a0\u03bcM.\nCritical: Monitor for changes in the absorbance spectrum of the RC, which may indicate loss of structural integrity. For example, a decrease in the 804\u00a0nm peak and a concomitant increase in the 760\u00a0nm peak indicates that the RCs are degrading (Hughes et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nPreparation of gold flag electrodes for RC and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) deposition\nTiming: 30\u201345\u00a0min\nIn this step, gold flag electrodes are cleaned electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a potentiostat.\nRinse a glass electrochemical cell with ddH2O followed by 100\u00a0mM KOH. Fill the cell with 100\u00a0mM KOH such that the gold electrode is fully immersed.\nNote: Ensure the electrochemical cell has been cleaned previously in a hot acid bath (1:1 ratio (v/v) of H2SO4:HNO3) and rinsed thoroughly in pure water (>18 M\u03a9-cm).\nGently bubble the electrolyte with argon gas to remove dissolved oxygen.Once degassed, connect the gold electrode to the working electrode lead from the potentiostat. Similarly, connect a flamed annealed platinum electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode rinsed in ddH2O to the counter and reference electrode leads, respectively. Ensure that the electrodes are fully submerged in the electrolyte.\nSet up a CV with the following parameters:\nScan rate: 25\u00a0mV/s\nLower vertex: \u22121.25\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl\nUpper vertex:\u00a0+0.55\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl\nCycles: 15\nNote: Cleaning is considered complete once the CV has reached an equilibrium and displays features that are consistent with gold (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05. CVs of gold flag electrodes are measured in 0.1\u00a0M KOH at 25\u00a0mV/s of a cleaned gold electrode (blue) and an RC- and MCH-covered electrode (orange)\nThe well-defined oxidation peak for the cleaned gold electrode at\u00a0+0.3\u00a0V is an indication that the surface is free from contaminants.\nRinse the gold electrode with ddH2O and remove from the holder and using tweezers to hold the gold stem, flame anneal (heat in a butane flame until the gold electrode is dark orange in colour).\nCritical: Careful that the gold does not overheat and melt.\nPause point: The cleaned electrode can be stored in a clean and sealed container, in a position such that the surface is not in contact with the sides.\nDeposition of RC and MCH on gold electrodes\nTiming: 1\u00a0h to 2\u00a0days\nIn this step, RCs purified from previous steps are deposited onto gold electrodes. This procedure applies to both the gold flag electrodes for photocurrent measurements and single crystal gold bead electrodes for AFM imaging. MCH is used to displace multilayers and non-specifically adsorbed RCs. Varying the MCH incubation time period controls the formation of different RC structural assemblies.Fully submerge a cleaned gold electrode in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of an RC solution in a 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube of the desired concentration (e.g., 0.5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM). Incubate for the desired period of time (e.g., 10\u00a0min to 24 h) in the dark at 4\u00b0C.\nRinse the electrode to remove excess RCs by gently dipping in PBS.\nCritical: Be cautious to not aggressively agitate or contact the sides of the container while rinsing.\nFully submerge an RC-deposited gold electrode in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of a 100\u00a0\u03bcM MCH solution in a 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube. Incubate for the desired period of time (e.g., 1\u201324 h) in the dark at 4\u00b0C.\nCritical: MCH will adsorb to many things. Take caution to avoid contaminating other experiments.\nRinse the electrode by gently dipping in PBS. The electrode should be used immediately.\nCritical: As formation of well-defined structural assemblies of RCs is the purpose of the experiment, the variables here control the structures. For example, the incubation time and concentration of RCs control how much protein material is initially bound to the electrode surface. The incubation time and concentration of MCH control how much protein material is displaced \u2013 non-specifically bound proteins are removed preferentially over those bound covalently.\nMeasuring photocurrents from RCs\nTiming: 6\u20138 h\nIn this step, the gold flag electrodes with RCs and MCH deposited on the surface are tested to measure the generation of photocurrents under an intensity-modulated illumination from an LED light source.\nNote: This step is based on a previous protocol (Jun et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).Set up an electrochemical cell with 2\u00a0mL of PBS in a cuvette (plastic or glass). Insert the gold working electrode (from the previous step), platinum counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Connect the electrodes to a potentiostat. See Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] for an example of the equipment setup.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. A schematic of the spectroelectrochemical cell\nThe cell is constructed in a plastic cuvette with the gold flag electrode oriented perpendicular to the LED positions, which are indicated by the holes in the bottom piece into which the cuvette is placed during measurements.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07. Example of the equipment setup for photocurrent measurements using a modulated light intensity LED, lock-in amplifier, linear potential sweep generator, and potentiostat\nAdd an aliquot of 1\u00a0M hydroquinone (in DMSO), the sacrificial electron donor, to achieve the desired final concentration (e.g., 1\u201320\u00a0mM).\nRun a CV as follows:\nScan rate: 2\u00a0mV/s\nNote: Not all potentiostats can scan at such low rates. We find that faster CV scan rates do not allow the use of low pass filters on the lock-in amplifier, resulting in large noise in the photocurrent signals.\nUpper voltage: 0.30\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl\nLower voltage: \u22120.10\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl\n2 scans\nNote: Ensure that the currents measured are small (i.e., <10\u00a0\u03bcA/cm2). This indicates that the MCH layer is effectively blocking faradaic reactions that occur on bare gold or through the MCH layer. While larger faradaic currents can be tolerated, we obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio of the photocurrents by minimizing the faradaic reactions at the electrode surface.\nNote: The photocurrents are measured at the same time as the faradaic current. The lock-in amplifier extracts the photocurrents from the total current (faradaic and photocurrent).Apply a 13\u00a0Hz sine wave to the LEDs (to illuminate the front and back of the gold flag electrode).\nEnsure that the amplitude of the sine wave (center-to-peak) does not exceed the offset current to make sure that the sine wave applied to the LEDs is not clipped. For example, in this work, the LEDs had a 40-mA offset and a 70-mA peak-to-peak current.\nNote: The sine wave generated by the lock-in amplifier is used as the input to the LED driver and subsequently converted to a current (100 mA/V, e.g., 70 mA peak-to-peak current). This signal is added to the constant current set on the LED driver (e.g., 40 mA offset).\nAdjust the amplification settings on the lock-in amplifier to increase the signal to a measurable level at the lock-in amplifier outputs. This is a heuristic approach to find the right settings. Set the lock-in amplifier filters at 24 dB roll-off and time constant of 1 or 3 s. Ensure the lock-in is measuring the amplitude (if using a dual-phase lock-in amplifier like the SR830, a non-zero amplitude should be accompanied by a relatively steady phase signal,).\nThe demodulated signal amplitude output from the lock-in amplifier is connected to the auxiliary input on the potentiostat.\nNote: Ensure that the total current and the amplitude of the photocurrent are measured at the same time.\nNote: The total current from the potentiostat is output as a voltage (converted at a value determined by the settings on the potentiostat, e.g., 1 mA/V) and passed into the input of the lock-in amplifier. Adjust the conversion to ensure the input to the lock-in amplifier is not too large, otherwise an input overload will occur.The photocurrent magnitude is determined by using the potentiostat setting for the current (e.g., 1 mA/V) and the amplification setting of the lock-in amplifier (e.g., 10\u00a0\u03bcV/V). For example, using the previously mentioned settings, if the photocurrent amplitude from the lock-in amplifier is 2 V, then this would correspond to a photocurrent of 2\u00a0V \u00d7 10\u00a0\u03bcV/V \u00d7 1 mA/V\u00a0= 20 nA.\nCritical: Care must be taken to ensure the setting are accurate, as some instruments output a 10\u00a0V full scale signal for the setting on the front panel. Make sure to read the manual to be sure of the conversion factor.\nBegin the photocurrent measurements at 0\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl. After a stable photocurrent signal is obtained (approximately 15\u00a0s at 0\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl), scan the potential slowly to\u00a0+0.3\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl and then to \u22120.1\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl (repeatedly) at 2\u00a0mV/s. Record the potential, total current, and amplitude from the lock-in-amplifier every 0.1 s.\nDC photocurrents are measured at the open circuit potential (OCP) of the electrochemical cell. Monitor the potential in the dark (LEDs off) until stabilized (approximately 2\u00a0min).\nApply the OCP and continuously measure the current. Monitor the change in the current as the LEDs are cycled on and off (approximately 10\u201330 s) using a constant current (i.e., sine wave is not used here).\nNote: Since the photocurrents are very small (on the order of nA), the OCP should be adjusted and optimized to ensure the smallest current possible, which would be achieved once the potential is set to a value where no net current flows (i.e., the net rate of HQ redox is zero).\nPreparation of a single crystal gold electrode for AFM imaging\nTiming: 2\u20133 hIn this step, a single crystal gold electrode is prepared and cleaned.\nCut approximately 1.5\u00a0cm of gold wire (1\u00a0mm in diameter) and secure to a holder using additional gold wire and glass tubing.\nRinse the gold wire with ddH2O thoroughly. Immerse the wire in a solution of aqua regia (1:3 ratio (v/v) of HNO3:HCl) for 10\u00a0min. Rinse with ddH2O again.\nFlame the gold wire until the tip of the wire melts. Stop melting when the bead climbs slightly up the wire.\nNote: When the wire begins to melt, it turns from a bright yellow colour to bright orange. Stop melting when a very small bead can be observed moving up the wire.\nRinse the gold wire with ddH2O thoroughly. Immerse the wire in a solution of aqua regia for 10\u00a0min. Rinse with ddH2O again.\nRepeat the previous two steps until the bead reaches approximately 2\u20133\u00a0mm in diameter.\nAfter immersion in aqua regia, the etching pattern is examined under a microscope to look for a highly symmetrical pattern that corresponds to the crystallography. Once the surface of the bead has a symmetric etch pattern and does not have any grain boundaries (these show up clearly as dark lines in the microscope images of the electrode), melt the electrode for the final time to smooth out the surface.\nAlternative: Check for the presence of a large flat reflective region on the surface \u2013 this is the 111 facet. Repeat the melting and cooling until this region is large enough to place the AFM tip on it (approximately 0.1\u00a0mm in diameter). For AFM measurements, the need for a single crystal bead electrode is not critical, just the presence of large 111 facets.Critical: Once the highly symmetric pattern is achieved on the surface without evidence of grain boundaries, when remelting the electrode, do not let the molten gold go past the top of the bead (i.e., stop melting before it reaches the stem). If the flame is not withdrawn in time, there is a high chance the single crystal pattern will not be retained. Such an electrode will most likely not regain its single crystal character.\nAssemble a glass electrochemical cell for cleaning the electrode surface using a 0.1\u00a0M solution of NaOH and purged with argon. Connect the single crystal gold electrode to the working electrode lead from the potentiostat. Similarly, connect a flamed annealed platinum electrode and rinsed saturated calomel reference electrode to the counter and reference electrode leads, respectively.\nNote: Ensure the electrochemical cell has been cleaned previously in a hot acid bath of H2SO4 and HNO3.\nSet up a CV with the following parameters:\nScan rate: 50\u00a0mV/s\nLower vertex: \u22121.4\u00a0V vs. SCE\nUpper vertex:\u00a0+0.6\u00a0V vs. SCE\nCycles: 30\nNote: Cleaning is considered complete once the CV has reached an equilibrium and displays features that are consistent with gold (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nRinse the gold electrode with ddH2O and flame anneal.\nCritical: Careful that the gold does not overheat and melt.\nThe clean single crystal gold bead electrode can now be used for the deposition of RCs as previously described in the section deposition of RC and MCH on gold electrodes[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] for future AFM imaging.\nPause point: The cleaned electrode can be stored in a clean, sealed container such that the surface is not in contact with the sides.\nAFM imaging of a single crystal gold electrode\nTiming: 1\u20132\u00a0h (setup: steps 50\u201356); 8\u201324\u00a0h (imaging: step 57)This step outlines the procedure to image a 111 facet on a single crystal gold bead electrode.\nRinse the single crystal gold bead electrode with PBS for 10 s. Rinse with ddH2O for 30\u00a0s to remove residual salt. Dry under a stream of argon.\nMount the electrode on the AFM stage and transfer to an optical microscope to coarsely align the 111 facet horizontally (i.e., parallel to AFM stage that has been pre-aligned to be perpendicular to laser beam).\nNote: The 111 facet is a darker circle or an oval spot on the electrode (Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). It can be distinguished from the rest of the surface as it appears more matte. The rest of electrode surface is lustrous like a mirror, whereas the 111 facet is not, since it tends to reflect light in a direction away from the viewer and so appearing as though it was matte when viewed under the microscope and illuminated from the sides of the electrode.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig8.jpg\nFigure\u00a08. Optical microscope image of the whole gold bead electrode without white light illumination\nThe oval matte regions represent the 111 surfaces (black circles). The scale bar is 0.5\u00a0mm in length.\nNote: Do not illuminate the electrode with white light directly, as the reflection from the 111 facet will make it hard to visualize.\nIlluminate the electrode surface in the AFM holder with the output from a columnated laser diode. The resulting reflection off the 111 facet is directed onto the surface of paper and will be visible as an intense circular reflection pattern.\nNote: Take care to wear appropriate laser safety glasses, as the reflection from the bead can be difficult to control.By moving the bead using tweezers, align the reflected beam with the path of the incident light, resulting in a 0\u00b0 angle between the incident and reflected beams. This ensures that the 111 facet of the electrode is aligned horizontally for optimal AFM imaging conditions. The electrode is now finely aligned with the AFM sample holder. This procedure does not eliminate sample tilt as the AFM tip/cantilever may not always be parallel to the AFM sample holder.\nNote: The alignment does not have to be exactly 0\u00b0. Some tolerance is acceptable as the tilt can be corrected during image processing.\nTransfer the finely aligned electrode on the AFM sample holder to the AFM microscope. The 111 facet is found as a bright oval spot, when illuminated with white light in the AFM (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig9.jpg\nFigure\u00a09. Optical microscope image of the 111 facet on the gold bead surface illuminated with white light\nThe oval spot represents the 111 surface with an AFM cantilever hovering above the surface. The scale bar is 0.5\u00a0mm in length.\nNote: The best spot for imaging is the center of the 111 facet, as it has the flattest surface. Avoid imaging on the edge of the facet as multiple atom high steps are present.\nNote: The suggested cantilever for imaging is one with a nominal resonance frequency of 150 kHz and a spring constant of 5 N-m.\nApproach the tip to the surface as usual. Perform a force curve measurement using tapping mode to ensure good contact with the surface and to determine the surface quality. The force curve should consist of clean approach and withdraw lines with relatively small hysteresis (i.e., no cusps or steps on the vertical part) (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig10.jpgFigure\u00a010. The approach curve represents the forces acting on the AFM tip\nThe red and blue traces represent the approach of the tip to the surface and withdrawal, respectively. The green box illustrates the optimal range for the setpoint to be selected before the scan begins.\nNote: Cusps on the vertical part, may indicate adherence of contaminants to the tip from the surface.\nManually set the optimum setpoint at approximately 80%\u201390% of the value between surface and the approach cusp (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10], green box).\nScan at a frequency of 0.14 lines/sec, sampling 4096 lines per image.\nRepeat as necessary. Scans can be completed overnight.\nProcessing of a raw AFM image\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step outlines the procedure to process AFM images using Gwyddion, an open-source software available for all major operating systems. The following steps correct for the background and tilt of the AFM images taken from the 111 facet.\nEven after aligning the surface using steps 52 and 53, the AFM image will still be tilted. Removing this planar background or tilt from the image is performed using the \u201cRemove Polynomial Background\u201d method.Optimal results are obtained by trial-and-error, but some simple guidelines are provided to ensure that the flattening does not introduce artifacts. Correction for the background is accomplished by fitting a polynomial to the whole image in both the X and Y dimensions. The choice of the polynomial is never usually above 3rd order. As shown in Figure\u00a011[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11], 1st order correction removes the tilt, but low frequency waves are still present. This can be corrected using the \u201cAlign Rows\u201d option to align the rows of lines that are out of the average plane (Figure\u00a011[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). The RMS roughness can be monitored, using the \u201cStatistical Quantities\u201d, method to evaluate the flattening process. As shown in Figure\u00a011[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], the RMS height stays constant after 2nd order background correction and performing \u201cAlign Rows\u201d function. This characteristic is a reasonable metric to limit background correction to where it no longer affects the RMS roughness values (shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1300-Fig11.jpg\nFigure\u00a011. Example of the AFM flattening procedure\nThe scale bar is 3\u00a0\u03bcm in length.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1300_8.csv\nPerform a particle analysis (size, height) after obtaining a flattened image.\nSet a threshold of 1\u00a0nm and create a mask. Erode the mask twice and dilate once to facilitate watershed separation of the particles. Watershed the resulting image to delineate or separate the particles. Convolution with the tip limits the accuracy of particle footprint estimates; therefore, accurate watershed is considered to be more important than accurate particle footprint determination.\nNote: The mask is used to analyse the AFM image by restricting the particles to be >3 pixels in area and exclude any particles on the edge of the image.\nCreate a histogram of the maximum height and the distribution of the footprint area for each particle.", "1. Stock Solutions\nResuspend the lyophilized active motif powder in sterile H2O to a final concentration of 2 \u00b5g/\u00b5l. Tap carefully for mixing.\nPrepare small aliquots (e.g., 12 \u00b5l each, 2 \u00b5l are required per reaction) and store them at -20 \u00b0C.\n2. Preparation of Cells\nSeed mammalian cells such as HEK293 cells or primary neurons on a 24 well plate in 500 \u00b5l growth medium including antibiotics.\n\tNOTE: When using neurons, seed the cells at low density and use only the two middle rows of the 24 well plate. Each well will thus have an empty counterpart to harbor the medium during incubation (step 4.2). When handling neurons, always make sure that the cells are not kept outside the incubator for more than a few minutes.\nCulture the cells at appropriate conditions (humidified, 5% CO2 and 37 \u00b0C) until the cells are app. 50% confluent.\n\tNOTE: When using neurons, culture the cells until the desired developmental stage is reached and change app. 25-50% of the medium twice a week. Medium: Neurobasal medium (containing 1x B27, 5 mM L-glutamine and 1x Penicillin and Streptomycin; compare with ref 16).\n3. Chariot Complex Formation\nPer reaction, dilute 0.1-2 \u00b5g of the POI or the corresponding antibody as well as the control protein, or control antibody, respectively, in 50 \u00b5l of PBS.\n\tNOTE: The technique also works with macromolecular complexes consisting of pre-bound primary and secondary antibodies (cp. 'Representative Results', Figure 1). Mix and spin.\nFor each sample, dilute 2 \u00b5l Chariot stock solution in 50 \u00b5l of PBS using separate tubes in order to avoid self-association of Chariot. Mix and spin.\nTransfer the diluted POI or antibody (step 3.1) to the Chariot dilution by pipetting. Mix and spin.\nIncubate the mixture for 30 min at room temperature (Chariot-POI complexes will form).4. Transfection of Cells\nDilute the\u00a0Chariot complexes (step 3.4) in 100 \u00b5l pre-warmed growth medium (37 \u00b0C, no additives). Remove the medium and wash the cells once using pre-warmed 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: When using neurons, do not discard the medium, it will be reused. Keep it at 37 \u00b0C. For washing, use PBS containing 0.5 mM MgCl2 and CaCl2.\n\tSuggestion: keep the medium in empty wells while incubating the plate (step 4.5).\nApply the Chariot complex solution (step 4.1) to the cells and rock the cells gently to ensure an even distribution of the solution. Grow the cells under standard conditions (step 2.2) for 1 hr. Add serum to a final concentration of 10%. When using neurons, add the medium from step 4.1. Grow the cells for 1 to 2 more hours.\n\tNOTE: The optimal incubation time depends on the size and properties of the cargo and may need to be adjusted empirically. The following suggestions may serve as a guideline: For peptides, 1 hr is usually sufficient, for proteins 1-2 hr are recommended, for antibodies 2 hr, and for the transfection of neurons with antibodies 4 hr.\nProcess cells for analysis as usual. Please note: the technique is compatible with experiments using fixation protocols as well as live imaging.\n5. Imaging\nUsing a laser scanning microscope, take z-stacks of cells and/or cell compartments of interest using approximately 0.25-0.5 \u00b5m distance. The precise layer distance depends on the size of the structure to be reconstructed and needs to be determined individually.\n6. Reconstruction\nIn the following steps, use the Esc bottom to switch between Select and Navigate, Cntr\u00a0to select multiple objects by clicking on them and shift\u00a0key to cut objects (cp. step 6.10).\nOpen the lsm-file in Imaris.Using the Display Adjustment for each channel, contrast the picture until the brightest structures reach saturation. Please note that this adjustment will not influence the surface construction, it only serves to assist the experimenter in thresholding the image.\nClick on the Add new Surfaces icon. A wizard will open.\nSelect: Segment only a Region of Interest. Proceed to the next step.\nAdjust the margins of the selection box to fit your object of interest. Please bear in mind that the image has 3 dimensions and that the selection needs to be adjusted at the z plane as well. If the rectangular shape of the selection box should not match the object of interest properly, turn the object and/or enlarge the box until all required structures are embedded. Undesired objects may be removed later on (cp. step 6.10). Proceed.\nSelect the appropriate channel. The Surface Area Detail Level or sphere diameter should be set to match the structures being reconstructed.\u00a0 Depending on the signal characteristics, either Absolute Intensity or Local Contrast can be used.\u00a0 Generally, Local Contrast works better for diffuse signals. In any case, the settings need to be adjusted separately for each signal or structure of interest, respectively.\nUsing the Thresholding tool, reconstruct the structure of interest.\nComplete the reconstruction by clicking on the green arrow bottom.\nAdjust the object further by using the pencil tool to cut and remove surfaces as required. It is only possible to cut in north-south direction, therefore, tilt the image in order to cut the desired object.\nObtain measurements of volume, area and intensities for each surface by selecting Statistics, Detailed Statistics, and Average Values.(Optional step) To observe color-coded statistics (cp. Figure 2E and F), select the color tab of the corresponding surface and mark 'Statistic Coded' instead of 'Base'. Several options will be displayed.\nSubscription Required.

Sterilize and inject Locke\u2019s solution and collagenase solution into the adrenal glands with a 0.22-\u03bcm syringe filter attached to a 30-mL syringe. Exercise care when performing the injections as the glands may rupture with excessive pressure.

Smaller glands normally yield cells with better release activity (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nRemove the surrounding fat and connective tissue from the glands. Try to remove as much fat as possible. Also remove the fat and connective tissue surrounding the adrenal vein (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).Place the glands in a sterile petri dish for adrenal glands cleaning. To remove blood, inject each gland from the adrenal vein 10\u201320 times with 1.5\u20133\u00a0mL Locke\u2019s solution at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: When injecting Locke\u2019s solution into the glands, you should feel it swell slightly.\nNote: It is essential to remove all blood when washing the glands.\nWash the glands with 2\u20133\u00a0mL collagenase solution to get rid of the Locke\u2019s solution remaining in the glands. Hold the syringe and maintain constant pressure for a few seconds to keep the collagenase solution in the end of the adrenal vein.\nInject the glands with 2\u20133\u00a0mL collagenase solution and maintain constant syringe pressure for a few seconds to ensure the collagenase solution reaches the end of the adrenal vein. Place the glands in a glass beaker. Cover the beaker with foil and incubate for 10\u00a0min in the 37\u00b0C water bath (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nAfter 10\u00a0min, inject another 1\u20132\u00a0mL collagenase solution into the adrenal vein. It is not necessary to maintain constant syringe pressure for the second injection, as the gland is partially digested, and the collagenase solution will get into the vein easily. Cover the beaker with foil and incubate for another 10\u00a0min in the water bath.\nNote: Use less collagenase solution for the second injection to avoid over-digestion and rupture of the glands.\nAfter 10\u00a0min, take the glass beaker out of the water bath. The glands should be noticeably softer, indicating success of the digestion.Unfold autoclaved surgical pack \u0399\u0399 (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and open the gland longitudinally (along its length) using a sterile scissor. It should appear with the cream-colored section representing the medulla (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F). Use curved fine forceps to collect the medulla material and transfer it to a clean petri dish containing 50\u00a0mL Locke\u2019s solution (Figures\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F\u20131H). Do not collect any red or purple material that contains cortical cells.\nUsing a sterilized small scissor, cut the medulla tissue into small pieces (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).\nTriturate the material 5\u201310 times with a 50-mL stripette (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J). Pass the dissociated material into a beaker through an 80\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm sterilized nylon mesh to remove the bulk debris (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).

Resuspend the pellet in 20\u00a0mL Locke\u2019s solution and triturate it with a stripette 5\u201310 times.\nPass the cell suspension through an 80\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer and add fresh Locke\u2019s solution to produce a final volume of 40\u201350\u00a0mL (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L).\nCentrifuge at 48\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for another 3\u00a0min; discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet by 20\u00a0mL culture medium and triturate it with a stripette 5\u201310 times.\nCount the cell number in a Neubauer hemocytometer.\nNote: Use low acceleration and deceleration speed when centrifuging to avoid cell damage.\nNote: Avoid air bubbles when triturating or transferring cells to avoid cell damage.\nNote: A typical yield is around 3\u20139\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 chromaffin cells from three adrenal glands.\nNote: Normally, two repetitions with 10\u00a0min each are optimal for digestion. However, the total digestion time may need to be adjusted according to the activity of the collagenase P, which may vary from one batch to another. A total of 18\u201325\u00a0min digestion time is recommended.Note: In general, optimal exocytosis and endocytosis are usually observed up to 3\u00a0days after plating.\nBovine chromaffin cells electroporation \u2013 day 1\nTiming: 1.5\u20132 h\nCells are transfected by electroporation using the Basic Primary Neurons Nucleofector Kit and NucleofectorTM 2b device (both Lonza), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (https://bioscience.lonza.com/protocol[href=https://bioscience.lonza.com/protocol]). Here we describe the transfection of mNeonGreen (mNG)-tagged phospholipase C \u03b41 PH domain (PH-mNG) (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]). PH-mNG binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2), a phospholipid that labels the plasma membrane. Other plasmids or siRNAs can be transfected using the same method.\nCentrifuge 2.5\u20133\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells at 48\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 2\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C in a 15-mL conical tube.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet carefully in 100\u00a0\u03bcL Nucleofector\u00ae solution per sample.\nCombine 100\u00a0\u03bcL cell suspension with 1\u20135\u00a0\u03bcg PH-mNG plasmid, appropriate amount of siRNA or other substrates.\nTransfer cell/plasmid suspension into a certified cuvette (sample must cover the bottom of the cuvette without air bubbles).\nSelect program O-005 from the program list of the electroporation device.\nNote: Different programs were tested for bovine chromaffin cell electroporation. With program O-005, about 20%\u201330% transfection efficiency of PH-mNG could be obtained with high viability of cells, whereas other programs tested for bovine chromaffin cells are either with lower efficiency or higher toxicity.\nInsert the cuvette with the cell/plasmid suspension into the Nucleofector\u00ae cuvette holder and start the selected program.\nTake the cuvette out of the holder once the program is complete.\nImmediately add 1,500\u20131,600\u00a0\u03bcL pre-warmed culture medium to the cuvette and gently aspirate 2\u20133 times.

A duration of 1\u00a0s depolarization is used for stimulation in chromaffin cells. Although this section does not cover imaging, patch-clamp recordings are performed simultaneously with either confocal or STED imaging described in the following two sections. Hence, start the steps described in this section only after the imaging configurations are ready and a good cell has been chosen for either confocal or STED imaging.\nNote: The experiments could also be performed at physiological temperature (37\u00b0C) using a temperature-controlled recording chamber.\nFilter recording electrode internal solution using a 1-mL syringe attached with a 0.20-\u03bcm Millex-FG syringe filter unit; keep the internal solution on ice during the experiment.\nPlace the coverslip with cells in the chamber (Figures\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A\u20132E, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).

Set the amplifier to voltage-clamp and correct the pipette offset.\nApproach the coverslip by moving the micromanipulator and monitoring the pipette height closely. Stop moving the glass pipette just before touching the cell layer on the coverslip and change the settings of the micromanipulator to smooth and slow motion (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nApproach the cell body by moving the glass pipette carefully until the tip touches the cell, and a very small dimple is seen on the cell membrane (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nRelease the positive pressure and apply negative pressure gently with the syringe to obtain a giga \u03a9 seal.

We used this stimulus because it induces robust exo-endocytosis as reflected in capacitance recordings (Shin et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24], 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

The protocol described here is for imaging PH-mNG (excitable at 514\u00a0nm, labels plasma membrane), A655 (excitable at 633\u00a0nm, labels opened \u03a9-shaped profiles) and FFN511 (excitable at 458\u00a0nm, fluorescent false neurotransmitter for labeling intracellular vesicles). However, this protocol is also applicable to any other fluorescent molecules excitable at other wavelengths (e.g., mTFP-1, Alexa Fluor 488, FFN206). The imaging Z-axis location is fixed to focus on the cell foot, about 200\u2013300\u00a0nm above the cell bottom adhering to the coverslip. PH-mNG expression shows the contour of plasma membrane at the XY-plane except the cell foot. At the cell foot, A655 spots can also be observed, reflecting \u039b-shape or \u03a9-shape membrane invaginations (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nIncubate cells with 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM FFN511 for 20\u201330\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C to label intracellular vesicles.\nSet up microscope and imaging chamber (Methods videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nTurn on Leica SP5 microscope.\nTurn on light source.\nSelect 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.4 NA oil objective on the microscope.\nPrepare 300\u2013600\u00a0\u03bcL bath solution with 50\u00a0\u03bcM A655.\nGently remove the FFN511 solution and rinse the chromaffin cells two times with bath solution at 20\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C.Use a pair of fine forceps to transfer the coverslip into the magnetic imaging chamber and add 300\u2013600\u00a0\u03bcL bath solution with 50\u00a0\u03bcM A655 (Figures\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A\u20132G).\nApply Leica immersion oil to the objective and mount the chamber on the confocal microscope (Figures\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H\u20132J).\nConfigure Leica software (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nOpen LAS X software (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).

Right click then \u2018Extrude\u2019 these circles outwards a few millimeters on one face and extrude them inwards on the corresponding face.\n\t\tNOTE: The circles that are extruded inwards need to be slightly bigger - approximately 1.5 mm - than those that are extruded outwards, so that they will fit together snugly.\nSave each piece of the mold as a separate STL file.\nRepeat steps 3.1.4 \u2013 3.1.14 for \u2018Brain left\u2019, \u2018Brain right\u2019 and \u2018Cerebellum tumor\u2019.\n\t\tNOTE: Using the file \u2018Cerebellum tumor\u2019 rather than just \u2018Cerebellum\u2019 to create the mold means that the mold will have a space in it for the tumor to be inserted during construction.\nPrint the 3D molds\n\t\nInstall or open 3D printing software.Open the STL file for each piece of the mold in the printing software and rotate it so that it lies flat against the build plate. It is possible to add multiple mold pieces to the build plate and to print these simultaneously.\nChoose a large layer height (around 0.2 mm) and low infill value (around 20%) for faster printing. Print the molds using a rigid material such as Polylactic acid (PLA). If the molds are positioned appropriately, support material is not necessary.\nPrint the Skull\n\t\nOpen the \u2018Skull Top\u2019 file in the printing software and choose a large layer height (around 0.2 mm) and low infill value (around 20%).\nPrint the skull model in PLA but in contrast to step 3.2.3, support material will be required, so select to \u2018Add support\u2019 in the software. PVA is used as the support material as it can later be dissolved away with water.\nRepeat steps 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 for \u2018Skull Bottom\u2019.\nOnce the top and bottom of the skull have been printed, submerge them in water overnight to dissolve away the PVA support material.\n\t\tNOTE: The support material will dissolve away much faster if warm water is used, but if the water is too warm, it will deform the printed PLA. Therefore, it is preferable to use cool water and leave the print submerged overnight.\n4. Preparation of PVA-c\nMeasure 200 g of PVA powder and set to the side.\nHeat 1800 g of deionized water to 90 \u00b0C and add to a 2L conical flask.\n\tNOTE: The water needs to be almost boiling so the PVA powder will dissolve readily, but if the water reaches 100 \u00b0C, some will be lost to evaporation, which is to be avoided.\nSuspend the conical flask in a temperature-controlled water bath set at 90 \u00b0C.Position an electronic stirrer in the flask, ensuring it does not touch the bottom or sides, and set the speed to 1500 rpm.\n\tNOTE: Check that the water is stirring evenly and there are not stagnant points at the sides or bottom.\nGradually add the PVA powder to the conical flask, over around 30 min, then leave it to stir for around another 90 min. The resulting gel is the tissue-mimicking material PVA-c.\nRemove conical flask from the water bath and pour the contents into a beaker. Cover the top with cling film to prevent the formation of a skin on top of the PVA-c. Leave the PVA-c to cool to room temperature (around 20 \u00b0C). Once cooled, the PVA-c will be transparent. Tiny white crystals may be seen in the PVA-c, but any bubbles appearing on the surface must be gently scraped off.\nAdd 0.5 w/w% potassium sorbate to the PVA-c as a preservative, and manually stir well.\nThe PVA-c can be left at room temperature if covered in cling film for a few days before it is poured into molds.\n5. Phantom Assembly\nMeasure out enough PVA-c to fill the tumor mold into a beaker.\nTo the PVA-c for the tumor, add 1 w/w% glass microspheres for ultrasound contrast and 5 w/w% Barium Sulfate for X-ray contrast, and stir by hand.\n\tNOTE: It may be necessary to measure out excess PVA-c for the tumor so that these percentages are a measurable amount.\nSonicate the beaker to ensure homogenous mixing of the additives.\nLeave to cool and allow any bubbles formed to escape, around 10 min, then scrape any bubbles from the surface.NOTE: Do not leave for extended period once the glass spheres have been added, no longer than around 10 min, before pouring the PVA-c into a mold, as the glass spheres will settle to the bottom of the beaker. Once the phantom has been frozen, this will no longer be a concern, and the final phantom can be used at room temperature.\nSecure the tumor mold together (tape can be used to cover the joins in the mold) and pour in the PVA-c through the hole in the top of the mold. Leave for a few minutes to allow any bubbles formed in the pouring process to escape through the hole, then place straight into the freezer.\nPerform two freeze-thaw cycles on the tumor; each cycle here consists of 6 h of freezing at -20 \u00b0C and 6 h of thawing at room temperature. Then, carefully remove from mold.\nPlace the tumor into the corresponding space for it in the cerebellum mold, then construct the rest of the cerebellum mold and secure it together.\nTo the remaining PVA-c add 0.05 w/w% glass microspheres, then repeat steps 5.1.3 and 5.1.4.\nPour the PVA-c into the cerebellum mold, allowing it to surround the tumor that has been placed inside. Additionally, pour the mixture into the molds for each brain hemisphere.\nPerform two freeze-thaw cycles on each brain hemisphere and the cerebellum; each cycle here consists of 24 h of freezing at -20 \u00b0C and 24 h of thawing at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Cycles with 12 h freezing followed by 12 h thawing also effective, to allow the phantom to be created in less time. 24 h was chosen for ease of application, to avoid returning to the lab every 12 h.Once the phantoms have thawed for the second time, carefully remove them from the molds and place into the printed skull.\n\tNOTE: When not in use, the completed PVA-c phantoms should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge, and can be kept for a few weeks in this way\nFor completion, place the \u2018Cerebellum tumor\u2019 phantom on the spike at the base of the \u2018Skull Bottom\u2019 model. The models of two brain hemispheres (\u2018Brain left\u2019 and \u2018Brain right\u2019) are placed on top and slot into the uppermost part of the \u2018Cerebellum tumor\u2019.\nPlace the four dowels in each space on the \u2018Skull Bottom\u2019 model and place \u2018Skull Top\u2019 model on top. If required, the model may then be maneuvered into the desired position to simulate intraoperative use in surgery.\n6. Phantom Imaging\nUltrasound Imaging\n\t\nApply ultrasound gel to the imaging probe.\n\t\tNOTE: Gel is not used intraoperatively but may be used in simulation and does not significantly change the clinical workflow or the quality of the acquired images.\nImage the brain and tumor through the craniotomy, with a clinical scanner and burr hole probe.\nCT Imaging\n\t\nImage the whole phantom in a CT scanner.", "NOTE: Do the following steps while wearing the proper personal protective equipment, such as a lab coat and gloves.\n1. Mounting Non-functional Silicon Probe for Focused Ion Beam (FIB) Lithography\nNOTE: For the complete procedure describing the fabrication of the SOI wafer with the 1,000 probes, please refer to Ereifej et al.39.\nIsolate a strip of 2-3 silicon probes from the silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer containing 1,000 probes. Do not make strips containing more than three silicon probes. This may increase the chances for loose mounting and may cause misalignment resulting in the FIB to etch incorrectly.\n\tNOTE: Strips/probes not firmly sitting on the aluminum stub can cause two complications: 1) when the stage moves to work on the next section, there will be vibrations and the milling will not be accurate until the probe settles and 2) it can cause a high variation and be out of the focus plane.\n\t\nWhile wearing gloves, use fine forceps to put pressure around the probes to break off a small section containing two to three probes.\nCarefully clean the silicon probe of all dust and debris prior to FIB etching. Prepare a 6 well polystyrene plate by pipetting 3 mL/well of 95% ethanol into three wells.\n\t\nCarefully pick up the cut strip of silicon probes using fine tip or vacuum forceps and place it into cell strainer. Place only one strip of silicon probes per strainer to prevent breaking the probes. Place the strainer containing the silicon probes strip into the first well containing 95% ethanol for cleaning. Keep the strainer in the first well for 5 min.\nMove the strainer containing the silicon probes from the first well and place it into the second well containing 95% ethanol for another 5 min. Repeat once more in the third well.Place the strainer containing the cleaned silicon probes onto a polytetrafluoroethylene plate to air dry. Do this step in a sterile hood to avoid contamination from dust.\nPlace the air-dried strip of silicon probes in a sealed container for transport to the SEM-FIB. Wrap the strainer containing the air-dried samples with a plastic or aluminum foil wrap for transport and/or storage to maintain cleaning.\nUse fine tipped or vacuum forceps to carefully pick up the clean strip of silicon probes and place them onto a clean aluminum stub (used for SEM-FIB imaging/etching) to prepare for mounting.\nUse a toothpick (or other fine tipped instrument like a thin electrical wire), to place a tiny drop (~10 \u00b5L) of silver paint on the edge of the silicon substrate surrounding the probes. Secure the strip down by spreading the silver paint around the sides of the silicon substrate surrounding the probe. Allow the silver paint to dry completely before placing the aluminum stub into the SEM-FIB.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to get silver paint on the shank of the electrode because that is the part that will be etched. If the strip of probes is not securely anchored to the aluminum stub, the strip may move during processing or have a different focal plane, thereby resulting in incorrect milling by the FIB. Several strips of silicon probes can be mounted onto the same aluminum stub, making sure there is ample space between the strips to allow for removal from the stub after etching. This will allow more efficient etching of multiple probes using the automated feature described below.\n2. Aligning the FIB to the Silicon ProbesClick on vent button in the beam control tab to vent the chamber. Press Shift+F3 to perform home stage. Confirm the selection by selecting the Home Stage button in the popup window.\n\tNOTE: Running the home stage operation is a preventative step to ensure the stage axis are read correctly by the software and the microscope is in good condition.\nAfter the Home Stage is complete, move the stage to coordinates X = 70 mm, Y = 70 mm, Z = 0 mm, T = 0\u00b0, R = 0\u00b0. Once the chamber is vented, put on clean nitrile gloves and open the chamber door.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the previous user's application, it may be necessary to change the stage adapter. The standard stage adapters (e.g., FEI style) can be removed by unscrewing the central bolt counterclockwise and installed by screwing clockwise into the rotation plate of the stage.\nInsert the aluminum stub holding the probes into the top of the stage adapter. Secure the aluminum stub by tightening the set screw on the side of the stage adapter. Use the 1.5 mm hex wrench for this task.\nAdjust the height of the stage adapter by turning the adapter clockwise to lower it or counterclockwise to raise it. Secure the stage adapter to the rotation plate by turning the locking cone nut clockwise until the nut is secure against the stage rotation plate. Hold the stage adapter with the other hand to prevent the rotation of the adapter and samples while tightening the locking cone nut.NOTE: Use the provided height gauge to determine the appropriate height. The top of the aluminum stub should be the same height as the maximum line shown on the height gauge. Over tightening the cone nut can cause damage to the stage and adapter. Only use enough force to secure the samples.\nAcquire a navigation camera image. Carefully swing the navigation camera arm open until it stops. The microscope stage will automatically move to a position beneath the camera. Watch the live image shown in Quadrant 3 of the microscope user interface (UI).\n\t\nOnce the brightness level auto adjusts to an appropriate level, acquire the image by pushing the button down on the camera bracket. Be sure to wait for the entire image acquisition to finish, which is indicated by a pause symbol appearing in Quadrant 3 and the illumination of the camera turning off. This takes approximately 10 s. Swing the camera arm back to the closed position. The stage will return to the original position.\nCarefully close the microscope chamber door. Watch the CCD camera image in Quadrant 4 while closing the door. Ensure that the samples and stage are a safe distance away from any critical component in the microscope chamber.\nSelect the down arrow next to the Pump button in the beam control tab. Select Pump with Sample Cleaning button in the UI software to start the chamber vacuum pump and built in plasma cleaner. Ensure the door is sealed by gently pushing on the face of the door while the pump is running. Wait for approximately 8 min for the pumping time and plasma cleaning cycle for the microscope chamber to be completed.NOTE: A vacuum seal can be confirmed by gently pulling on the chamber door, which should remain closed if the system is under vacuum.\nOnce the icon in the bottom right corner of the UI turns green, press the Wake-Up button in the beam control tab which turns on the electron and ion beams. Select quadrant 1 and set the beam signal to electron beam (if not set already), set quadrant 2 to ion beam (if not set already).\n\t\nSet SEM voltage to 5 kV, set SEM beam current to 0.20 nA, set SEM detector to ETD, set detector mode to Secondary Electron. Set FIB voltage to 30 kV, set FIB beam current to 24 pA, set FIB detector to ICE detector, set detector mode to the secondary electron.\nDouble click on the silicon probe in the navigation camera image, quadrant 3 to move the stage to the approximate location of the probe. Click on quadrant 1 to select it as the active quadrant and hit the pause button to start SEM scanning. Set the scan dwell time to 300 ns and turn off scan interlacing, line integration, and frame averaging. Set scan rotation to 0 in the beam control tab and right click on the beam shift 2d adjuster and select zero.\nAdjust the magnification to the minimum value by turning the magnification knob counterclockwise on the MUI panel. Adjust the image brightness and contrast using the knobs on MUI panel or the Auto Contrast Brightness toolbar icon.\nMove the stage by either double-left-clicking the mouse on a feature to center it, or by pressing down the mouse wheel and activating the joystick mouse mode. Move the desired silicon probe to be patterned into the center of the SEM image.Locate an edge or other features such as a dust particle or scratch. Increase magnification to 2,000x by turning the magnification knob clockwise. Adjust the focus of the SEM by turning the coarse and fine focus knobs on the MUI until the image is in focus. Once the image is in focus, select the Link sample Z to working distance button in the toolbar.\nConfirm that operation was completed by looking at the Z-axis coordinate in the navigation tab. The value should be approximately 11 mm. Type in 4.0 mm in the Z axis position and push the Go To button with the mouse or hit the enter key on the keyboard and the stage will move to 4 mm working distance.\nMove the stage in X and Y to locate the shoulder of the silicon probe. Position it as close to the center of the SEM as possible. Change the stage tilt to 52\u02da by typing in \"52\" in the T coordinate and hitting enter. Observe whether the shoulder of the probe appears to move up or down in the image. Use the Stage Z slider to bring the shoulder of the probe back to the center of the SEM image. Only adjust the Z position, do not move X, Y, T, or R axis.\nRun the built in \"xT Align Feature\" command located in the stage drop down menu. Use the mouse to click on two points parallel to the edge of the probe. Make sure the horizontal radio button is selected in the popup window and click finish. The stage will rotate to align the probe with the X axis of the stage. Adjust the stage in X,Y using the mouse to put the lower shoulder of the probe in the center of the SEM image again.NOTE: The first point should be towards the probe's grip and the second point should be towards the probe's point.\nSelect the FIB in quadrant 2 and make sure the beam current is still 24 pA. Set the magnification to 5,000x and the dwell time to 100 ns. Type Ctrl-F on the keyboard to set the FIB focus to 13.0 mm. In the beam control tab, right click in the stigmator 2d adjuster and select zero and, also, right click in the Beam Shift 2d adjuster and select zero. Set the scan rotation to 0\u00b0 and push the auto contrast brightness button in the toolbar.\nLook for an image of the probe shoulder in quadrant 2. Use the snapshot tool to acquire an image with the FIB. Confirm the probe shoulder is in the center of the FIB image, if not, double click on the probe shoulder to move it to center. Move the stage to the left by pushing the left arrow key on the keyboard approximately 10-15 times. Take another snapshot and observe whether the probe side is still in the center of the FIB.\n\tNOTE: IF not, the stage rotation must be adjusted slightly. If the probe is above the image center, the stage must be rotated in the negative direction. If the probe is below center, the stage must be rotated clockwise. Enter a relative compucentric rotation of 0.01 to 0.2 degrees depending on which way is necessary to align the probe.\nRepeat steps 2.16 to 2.17 as many times as necessary until the edge of the probe shoulder is perfectly aligned with the X axis of the stage, (the edge stays in the center of the FIB while moving left).Using the FIB, move the stage back to the lower shoulder of the probe. Save the stage position in the position list by clicking the Add button. Change the FIB beam current to 2.5 nA and make sure the magnification of the FIB is still 5000x. Run the auto brightness contrast function and set the FIB dwell time to 100 ns.\nHit the pause button to start scanning. Adjust the FIB focus and astigmatism, as quickly and precisely as possible, using the Coarse and Fine focus knobs, and the X and Y stigmator knobs on the MUI panel. Hit the pause button to stop the FIB scanning.\n3. Writing an Automated Process for Etching\nStart the software by locating it in the Windows start menu (i.e., Start\\Programs\\FEI Company\\Applications\\Nanobuilder). Position the software window on the side monitor so the UI is not covered up. Open the file for patterning the silicon probes by clicking file and then open. Direct the windows browser to the location of the software script (Supplementary File 1 - the file name is \"Case_Western_2000_micron_Final_11H47M_runtime.jbj\").\nWithin the software, select the microscope dropdown menu and select Set stage origin. Within the software, select the microscope dropdown menu and then select Calibrate Detectors.\nOn the microscope UI, click in Quad 1 once with the mouse to select Quad 1. Ignore the other instructions shown in the popup window, they are not necessary for this project. Click OK to start the calibration. The process will take about 5 min. Make sure the ETD and ICE detectors calibrate. It is ok if any other detectors have calibration failures.\nWithin the software, select the microscope dropdown menu and choose Execute to start the patterning sequence. When the pattern is complete, close the software.NOTE: The software will take over quad 3 and 4 for the patterning and alignment functions. The script will take approximately 12 h to run. While the script is running, do not change any parameter on the microscope.\nHit \"Vent\" in the microscope UI beam control tab to shut down the microscope beams and start the vent cycle. While the chamber is venting, move the stage to coordinates X = 70 mm, Y = 70 mm, Z = 0 mm, T = 0\u00b0, R = 0\u00b0. Once the chamber is vented, put on clean nitrile gloves and pull open the chamber door.\nLoosen the set screw on the stub adapter using the 1.5 mm hex wrench. Remove the aluminum stub containing the patterned probe from the chamber. Carefully close the microscope chamber door. Watch the CCD camera image in Quadrant 4 while closing the door. Ensure that the stage adapter is a safe distance away from any critical component in the microscope chamber.\nSelect the down arrow next to the Pump button in the beam control tab. Select Pump button to start the chamber vacuum pump. Ensure the door is sealed by gently pushing on the face of the door while the pump is running.\n\tNOTE: A vacuum seal can be confirmed by gently pulling on the chamber door, which should remain closed if the system is under vacuum. The pumping time will be approximately 5 min. Only one side of the probe can be etched during a single run.If the front and back side of the probe requires etching, then carefully remove the etched strip of silicon probes after checking the final etch and imaging the front side (if images are needed). Dissolve the silver paint with acetone, by cautiously dabbing/brushing the acetone on the silver paint. Carefully turn the strip around to the backside, re-mount, align and etch following the steps described above.\n4. Checking the Final Etch and Imaging\nOnce the milling is complete verify the uniformity of the different sections using SEM imaging at a higher magnification.\n\tNOTE: Imaging at the tilted angle allows a better assessment of the variation in the milling depth. Special attention should be given to the transition regions between the milling locations.\nImage the samples again after milling with an optical microscope.\n\tNOTE: The periodic milled lines result in a refraction effect giving rise to different colors as a function of the imaging angle. If the color is not continuous along with the probe that is a clear indication of the disruption in the milled lines.\n5. Mounting a Functional Silicon Probe for FIB Etching\nGently remove the functional silicon electrode from its packaging. Use forceps to carefully lift the plastic protective tab covering the head stage. Start lifting one corner of the tab up from the sticky glue holding it in place and keep lifting until the entire electrode is removed.\nCarefully clamp the electrode with hemostats to prepare for mounting into the stereotaxic frame. While holding the covered tab with the forceps, gently place curved hemostats around the green shaft above the silicon shank, with the curved part of the hemostats facing upwards towards the tab. Lock the hemostats in place to ensure the electrode will not drop out of the hemostats.Gently remove the plastic protective tab covering the head stage. While holding the electrode with the hemostats, carefully clip the electrode into the stereotaxic frame for cleaning.\nFill 3 Petri dishes with 95% ethanol (~10 mL per petri dish). Place the Petri dish under the electrode that is mounted into the stereotaxic frame for cleaning. Slowly lower the electrode by turning the micromanipulator downwards (100 \u00b5m/s) so that the shank is submerged into the 95% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to turn the micromanipulator too fast or too deep, this can cause the electrode to break (i.e., the electrode should not touch the Petri dish).\nLeave the electrode shank in the 95% ethanol for 5 min, and then slowly raise the electrode out of the 95% ethanol by turning the micromanipulator upwards (100 \u00b5m/s). Repeat this step two more times, for a total of three washes. Allow the electrode to air dry for five minutes.\nUse the same technique for mounting the electrode into the stereotaxic frame, to remove the electrode from the stereotaxic frame. Carefully place the hemostats around the shaft of the electrode. Once the hemostats are clasped tight, release the electrode from the stereotaxic frame, return the plastic protective tab covering the head stage, and put the cleaned electrode back into its packaging.\n6. Etching Functional Silicon Probe Using FIB\nMount the cleaned functional silicon electrode onto an aluminum stand. Carefully pick up the cleaned functional silicon electrode using forceps and remove the protective tab from the headstage. Place the electrode shank on the aluminum stub so it does not hang over any edge, then using a small piece of Cu or carbon conductive tape, pin the headstage securely to the aluminum stub.NOTE: Alternatively, a low-profile clip holder can be used to hold the electrode down. Be careful not to touch the electrode shank.\nFollowing the steps described above (Section 2), position the electrode at the eucentric height and make sure the electrode is at the coincidence point of the SEM and FIB beams. Align the shank with the \"X\"direction of the stage.\nSet the FIB to the optimal current for milling the required the nano-architecture and make sure the focus and stigmation are properly corrected. Prepare an array of lines with desired spacing and length to cover the field of view of the shank (500 \u00b5m sections). Adjust the line lengths as etching gets down the shank to the thinner sections.\n\tNOTE: When etching the functional electrode, it is not possible to add fiducial marks to automate the process. Therefore, moving between the sub-sections (~500 \u00b5m) is done manually.\nAfter the milling of the first section is complete, make sure to check the milling quality before moving on to the next section. Repeat step 6.3 to etch the next section of the shank. Align the milled lines from the previous section to the patterns used for the next section to prevent large gaps between runs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell seeding \u2013 1st day\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step is very important to equalize the number of cells in every sample. This will improve the reproducibility of the experiments. The following steps must be done under sterile conditions.\nResuspend the cells in the culture flask for equal distribution (due to gravity, these cells fall to the bottom of the cell culture flask but remain in suspension) and transfer them into a 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube.\nPipette a volume of 50\u00a0\u03bcL cell suspension into a 1.5\u00a0mL centrifugation tube.\nCount the cells with a Neubauer counting chamber. Calculate the number of cells per mL.\nNote: Certain leukemic cells fall to the bottom of the flask and must be resuspended more vigorously (for example, we see this with erythroleukemic HEL cells). Solid tumor-derived cells usually attach to the bottoms of flasks and must be detached by trypsinization.\nNote: Prepare a dilution of the cell suspension with PBS for more reliable cell counting results. For MV4-11 cells, a dilution of 1:2 works best (this step can be done under non-sterile conditions because the counted cells shall not go back to the main culture). Add 50\u00a0\u03bcL PBS to the cell suspension and make sure that the cells are resuspended thoroughly.\nSeed 0.75\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells per mL in a final volume of 4\u00a0mL in a 6 well plate (final number of cells per sample: 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells in 4\u00a0mL medium). This will yield material for about two immunoblot analyses and one flow cytometry analysis.\nCalculate for 3 samples: siRNA control, siRNA against FLT3, and one additional sample to facilitate accurate pipetting. In total, 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells are necessary.Centrifuge the 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells in a 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube for 5\u00a0min at 200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g and room temperature (15\u00b0C up to 25\u00b0C).\nDuring the centrifugation step, prepare a 6 well plate with 3\u00a0mL fresh complete growth medium for the samples that will be electroporated and place it in the incubator to prewarm the media.\nAfter centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 3\u00a0mL fresh complete growth medium thoroughly (1\u00a0mL for every sample) by pipetting.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL cell suspension to every well of the prewarmed media in the 6 well plate. Thus, you will have two wells with 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells each.\nLet the cells adapt overnight (approximately 16 h), incubate them at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.\nNote: The cell line MV4-11 should be cultured at a density between 0.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u02c66 and 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u02c66 cells per mL to achieve the best growth. This gives a volume of 18\u201330\u00a0mL of cell suspension, i.e., a volume that fits in a 50\u00a0mL Falcon tube.\nNote: The optimal cell numbers for electroporation must be adjusted for every cell line. For different leukemia cell lines, cell numbers between 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells per sample usually gives good results.\nCritical: Make sure that the medium that is used for electroporation does not contain antibiotics. All buffers and media should have room temperature (15\u00b0C up to 25\u00b0C) to not stress the cells.\nTransfection of cells \u2013 2nd day\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following part is the key step. The siRNA is transferred into the cells. All steps are done under sterile conditions.\nPrepare a NeonTM Electroporation tube with 3\u00a0mL Electrolytic Buffer E2 and place it in the transfection unit as shown in Figures\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A\u20133C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1801-Fig3.jpgFigure\u00a03.

Make sure that it is placed correctly. You can feel it click into place.\n(C) The tube is correctly placed when there is no large gap under the tube in the unit.\nNote: The NeonTM Electroporation tube can be used several times. It is highly advisable to renew the Electrolytic Buffer E2 between different siRNAs and when using different cell lines.\nPrepare the cells for electroporation. Transfer the cells from the 6 well plate into 15\u00a0mL conical centrifugation tubes.\nResuspend the cells in the well thoroughly and transfer them with a 1\u00a0mL pipette into the centrifugation tube.\nWash each well with 1\u00a0mL PBS and transfer it into the tube as well.\nCentrifuge for 5\u00a0min at 200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at room temperature (15\u00b0C up to 25\u00b0C).\nAspirate the supernatant with a vacuum pump and resuspend the cells in 2\u00a0mL PBS.\nCentrifuge for 5\u00a0min at 200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at room temperature (15\u00b0C up to 25\u00b0C).\nDuring centrifugation, prepare a 6 well plate with 2\u00a0mL complete media per sample and place it in the incubator to warm the media.\nAspirate the supernatant to remove remaining FBS and resuspend the cells in 100\u00a0\u03bcL resuspension buffer R from the Thermo Fisher transfection kit.Note: It is very important to aspirate the supernatant very thoroughly. This can be done with a 1\u00a0mL pipette if there is no vacuum pump available. A significant excess of PBS leads to strong dilution of the resuspension buffer R. The NeonTM Electroporation Pipette is adjusted for exactly 100\u00a0\u03bcL; excess of PBS leads to a loss of cells that can be electroporated.\nTransfer the cells in the electroporation buffer into a 1.5\u00a0mL conical centrifugation tube.\nAdd 100 pmol siRNA to the cells. A stock concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM is used for siRNAs (recommended by the manufacturer), so add 10\u00a0\u03bcL to the cells.\nNote: This concentration of siRNA is useful to decrease several proteins in our hands. To transfect cells by electroporation, higher amounts of siRNA are necessary than for liquid-/polymer-based transfection protocols. It is necessary to adjust the concentration for every siRNA of interest and for each cell type.\nUse the Neon Electroporation Pipette and place the cells in the electroporation unit as shown in Figures\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B (see also troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]). Use the following settings for electroporation of MV4-11 cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1801-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Correct placement of the NeonTM Pipette\nThe correct placement of the electroporation tip is required for the proper working of the electroporation device.\n(A) There should be no gap between the electroporation tube and the pipette.\n(B) If the pipette is placed correctly, you can feel it click into place.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1801_5.csvNote: The Neon\u2122 Tips can be used several times. Change the tips between different cell lines and different siRNAs. It is possible to use the same tip for siRNA control first and siRNA of interest second. It is necessary to adjust the correct settings for every cell line. Thermo Fisher provides a database with protocols of selected cell lines (https://www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/de/de/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html]). Even if the cell line of interest is not listed, the database can help to establish the correct settings.\nCritical: Other settings can be more useful for other leukemic cell types. We effectively decrease proteins by electroporation and RNAi in MOLM-13 acute myeloid leukemia cells (voltage: 1,600 V, width: 10\u00a0ms, 3 pulses), in RS4-11 B cell precursor leukemia cells (voltage: 1,750 V, width: 20\u00a0ms, 1 pulse), and in HEL erythroleukemia cells (voltage: 1,400 V, width: 20\u00a0ms, 2 pulses). For K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells and NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells, see our recent publications (Pons et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nTransfer the cells into the 6 well plate (as shown in Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) with the prewarmed medium. Let the cells adapt overnight (approximately 16 h).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1801-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05. Transfer of electroporated cells into 6 well plate\nStimulation/incubation of cells \u2013 3rd day\nTiming: 1 h\nAfter adaption time, count and reseed the cells as necessary for the experiment of interest. In this protocol, the cells are analyzed using immunoblot. The following steps are done under sterile conditions in a clean bench.\nCount the cells using a Neubauer counting chamber as described in step 1.Seed 0.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells per mL in a final volume of 5\u00a0mL in complete medium (final number of cells per sample: 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells in 5\u00a0mL medium). Pipette the volume of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells in a 6 well plate and adjust a final volume of 5\u00a0mL with complete medium in every well.\nCritical: It is advisable not to stress the cells. Avoid any centrifugation steps because the cells are very sensitive after electroporation. It is recommended to test the viability of the cells after electroporation; for example, by flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide staining for early and late apoptotic events (Beyer et\u00a0al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The samples can be divided in the experiment and a small amount of 1\u00a0mL cell suspension can be used to evaluate apoptosis or cell cycle distribution. The control transfected samples typically show viability of over 80%. If the cells show a high apoptosis rate see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nLet the cells adapt for at least 1\u00a0h before stimulation (e.g., with drugs if necessary) or let the cells incubate overnight (approximately 16 h) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere before harvesting.\nNote: For MV4-11 cells, incubation of 48\u00a0h after electroporation gives the best results regarding knock-down efficiency. Using another cell line, the ideal time for gene silencing must be identified.\nNote: This protocol is not only working for siRNA. It can also be used for plasmids and the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. It can likewise be used to decrease RNAs of interest, e.g., miRNAs or long non-coding RNAs with known or to be identified biological functions.\nHarvesting and lysis of cells \u2013 4th day\nTiming: 2 hIn this protocol, the cells are analyzed by immunoblot. The following steps can be done under non-sterile conditions and must be performed on ice if indicated.\nCell harvest.\nTransfer the cells from the 6 well plate into conical 15\u00a0mL centrifugation tubes.\nCentrifuge for 5\u00a0min at 800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at room temperature (15\u00b0C up to 25\u00b0C).\nAspirate the supernatants with a vacuum pump and a Pasteur pipette or with a 1\u00a0mL pipette. Resuspend the cells in 1\u00a0mL PBS and transfer the cells into 1.5\u00a0mL centrifugation tubes.\nCentrifuge for 5\u00a0min at 800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at 4\u00b0C.\nAspirate the supernatants thoroughly.\nNote: Make sure that there is as little PBS left as possible after aspiration. A high excess of PBS will dilute the lysis buffer and lead to incomplete cell lysis.\nCell lysis.\nAdd an appropriate amount of complete NET-N lysis buffer (i.e., containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors and DTT) to the cells. As rule of thumb add around 100\u00a0\u03bcL of complete NET-N lysis buffer to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells.\nLyse the cells for 30\u00a0min on ice.\nSonicate the samples for 10\u00a0s and an amplitude of 40%. This shears DNA and thereby facilitates the loading of protein samples into the SDS-PAGE gel. Benzonase might alternatively be used to shear DNA.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 25\u00a0min at 17,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at 4\u00b0C.\nDetermination of protein concentration and final sample preparation.\nTransfer the supernatants into new 1.5\u00a0mL centrifugation tubes and determine protein concentrations (e.g., Bradford or BCA assays).\nEqualize the amount of protein in every sample and add 6\u00d7 sample buffer to a final concentration of 1\u00d7 buffer.\nDenature the proteins by boiling for 5\u00a0min at 95\u00b0C.Note: Certain proteins do not tolerate boiling for 5\u00a0min at 95\u00b0C. If necessary, reduce boiling time and/or temperature.\nNote: If cytosolic fractions are collected, shearing/degradation of genomic DNA is not necessary. Together with nuclear proteins, it will remain in the centrifuged nuclear fraction; see (G\u00f6der et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) for further details.\nPause point: After preparing the lysates and boiling, it is possible to continue the next day. You can freeze the samples at \u2013 20\u00b0C for several weeks, until running the immunoblot.\nRun immunoblot and analyze the proteins of interest. For complete details on the use and execution of performing an immunoblot, please refer to (Beyer et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: Primary antibodies are prepared in TBS-T buffer with 2% skim milk powder; dilutions of antibodies are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. Secondary antibodies are prepared in TBS-T buffer.\nAlternatives: The high starting numbers of cells for this experiment provide the ability to perform other experiments of interest after gene silencing.", "1.

Preparation of the shear force microscope\nNOTE: The shear force microscope contains two parts, a reaction unit (homogenizer) and a detection unit (fluorescence microscope). The magnification of the eyepiece is 10x, and the magnification of the objective lens (air) is 4x.\nAssemble the homogenizer and the microscope on a mounting table. Wear goggles and turn on the fluorescence microscope, and then adjust the homogenizer to make sure that the excitation light beam of an appropriate wavelength (here, 488 nm was used) passes through the center of the dispersing tip of the homogenizer.\nPrepare a flat-bottomed reaction chamber that is 5 cm in height and 1.5 cm2 x 1.5 cm2 in cross-section. To reduce the background, ensure that the selected chamber material does not fluoresce, such as glasses (some plastics have fluorescence).\nChoose an appropriate homogenizer dispersing tip that can provide the desired shear force.\n\tNOTE: The shear rate is dependent on the distance between the rotor and stator at a fixed rotating speed11 according to the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63741/63741eq01.jpg\n\twhere \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity of water at 20 \u00b0C; D is the inner diameter of the stator; d is the outer diameter of the rotor, and V is the shear speed (rpm/s).\nClamp the reaction chamber on the sample stage of the fluorescence microscope, and then adjust the chamber to hold the dispersing tip of the homogenizer (Figure 1). Make sure the dispersing tip is slightly above (~1\u00a0mm) the bottom surface of the reaction chamber.Adjust the vertical position of the homogenizer and the chamber together to ensure the focus of the microscope is on the surface of the dispersing tip. Then, adjust the horizontal position of the dispersing tip to ensure that the detection area (field of view) is set between the rotor and stator (Figure 1).\nSwitch on the fluorescence channels according to the fluorescent dye used in the experiment.\nBefore the high-speed shearing experiment, use deionized (DI) water to test the shearing with a low shearing speed (e.g., 2,000 rpm) to ensure the dispersing tip can work appropriately without touching the reaction chamber.\n2. Unfolding i-motifs with and without ligands\nPrepare a human telomeric i-motif DNA (Table of Materials) labeled with a dye and a quencher at its two ends, respectively, in DI water, as described in Hu et al.11.\n\tNOTE: i-motif containing sequence: 5'-TAA CCC TAA CCC TAA CCC TAA CCC TAA.\nDilute the DNA to 5 \u00b5M in the 30 mM MES buffer at pH 5.5 or pH 7.4. To the DNA solution, add ligand L2H2-4OTD, which was synthesized according to Abraham Punnoose et al.13, in a concentration range of 0-60 \u00b5M. Mix the solution gently for 10 min to fold the i-motif structures without light.\nCheck and minimize the background fluorescence intensity of the reaction chamber that is filled with deionized DI water using the fluorescent microscope without shearing. An easy way to minimize the background fluorescence is to wash the reaction chamber with DI water. The background fluorescence value needs to be subtracted in the data analyses later.\n\tNOTE: Stray light should be avoided from this step onwards.Set the parameters of the CCD camera using the software. The recommended parameters are as follows: exposure time = 0.5 s, CCD sensitivity = 1600, and recording time = 20 min.\nUsing a long pipet, add the DNA solution into the empty and clean reaction chamber. Cover the reaction chamber with a black box. Then, start the homogenizer to perform shearing at a selected shear rate ranging from 9,724 s\u22121 to 97,245 s\u22121 (selected using the software associated with the homogenizer) for 20 min with the CCD camera turned on to record the data.\nAfter the experiment, remove the chamber and wash it with DI water.\n3. Shear force-actuated click reaction\nPrepare i-motif DNA in DI water. Incubate 10 \u00b5M i-motif DNA in 300 \u00b5L of 30 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 150 \u00b5M CuCl and 300 \u00b5M ascorbic acid for 10 min to fold the i-motif structures (all concentrations are final concentrations in the solution).\n\tNOTE: CuCl is the catalyst of the click reaction. Ascorbic acid will prevent copper (I) oxidization.\nUltra-filtrate the solution with an ultrafiltration device at a centrifugal force of 14,300 x g. Replenish the solution to ~500 \u00b5L with 30 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 300 \u00b5M ascorbic acid after each filtration.\nRepeat the filtration 3x.\nCollect the residual solution and make a final volume of 300 \u00b5L by adding 30 mM Tris (pH 7.4) supplemented with 300 \u00b5M ascorbic acid along with 20 \u00b5M Calfluor 488 azide, 20 \u00b5M HPG, and 10 \u00b5M TBTA. Once the reagents are added, move the solution to the darkroom.\n\tNOTE: Light should be avoided after this step.Check and minimize the background fluorescence intensity of the reaction chamber filled with DI water using the microscope before the shearing experiments. An easy way to minimize the background fluorescence is to wash the reaction chamber with DI water.\nAdd the DNA solution into the empty reaction chamber with a long pipet, and then start the homogenizer shearing at a shear rate of 63,209 s\u22121 for 20 min with the CCD camera turned on.\nAfter the experiment, remove the chamber and wash it with DI water.\nSubscription Required.

Determination of Cell Viability Using a Mixing Unit Compared to Manual Spatula Mixing\nDetach human fibroblasts (passage 7) with a 0.5% trypsin/EDTA solution at 80% confluence, count the number, and resuspend in culture medium at sufficient cell density to achieve a final concentration after blending with the bioink (1:10 cell:bioink ratio) of 5 x 106 cells/mL.\nBlend cells into the bioink using either the passive mixing unit technique (Step 2) or via spatula to evaluate the effect of both techniques on cell viability.\nBlend the cells into the bioink using the passive mixing unit technique 1, 2, or 3 times prior to dispensing into a mold for cross-linking using 100 mM CaCl2.\n\tNOTE: To perform additional blends, mix the cell/bioink directly into a syringe rather than a cartridge. Then remix the blend through the mixing unit following the previous protocol but without the cell syringe component.\nBlend the cells into a separate bioink using manual mechanical mixing via a spatula for durations of 30, 60, or 90 s.

Convert to a Gcode file for bioprinting and load the Gcode file on the bioprinter1.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, a square structure with dimensions 4.8 x 4.8 x 0.9 mm3 was exported as an STL file. A Gcode file was generated of the lattice structure using the following settings: layer thickness, 0.3 mm; infill pattern, rectilinear; infill density, 25%; speed, 10 mm/s.\nIsolate and cryopreserve primary human nasal chondrocytes (hNC) from patients following the referenced protocol1.\nThaw and expand cryopreserved hNCs and expand once in monolayer culture using standard culture medium at 37 \u00b0C.

Bioprint cell-free constructs (blended with cell medium containing no cells) as a control.\nCross-link the constructs by adding an ionic solution of 100 mM CaCl2 for 5 min. Rinse the constructs and incubate in culture medium under standard culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity). Change the media every second or third day.\nCollect samples for histological analysis at weeks 2 and 4. Stain the samples for GAG production using an Alcian blue stain18.\n5. Bioprinting of Skin Analogs with Two Cell Types\nDraw a 3D model of the desired tissue analog and convert to a Gcode file for bioprinting. Load the Gcode file on the bioprinter.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, a square structure with dimensions 4.8 x 4.8 x 0.9 mm3 was exported as an STL file. Then a Gcode file was generated of the lattice structure using the following settings: layer thickness, 0.3 mm; infill pattern, rectilinear; infill density, 25%; speed, 10 mm/s.\nPrepare the cells for blending into the bioink for bioprinting. For the fabrication of skin analogs, two cell types were utilized. The two cell types were blended into the bioink and bioprinting.Obtain primary HDF. Maintain these cells in DMEM growth media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 \u00b5g/mL ascorbic acid. Detach cells at 80 - 90% confluence with a 0.5% trypsin/EDTA solution and count.\nIsolate and cryopreserve primary hNC from patients following the referenced protocol1.

Bioprint cell-free constructs (blended with cell medium containing no cells) as a control.\nCross-link the constructs by adding an ionic solution of 100 mM CaCl2 for 5 min. Rinse the constructs and incubate in culture medium under standard culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity). Change the media every second or third day.\nCollect samples for histological analysis at weeks 2 and 4. Stain the samples for collagen I production using a Masson's trichrome stain19.", "1. Preparing the Perfusion System\nSet up the perfusion system consisting of a water bath, a perfusion chamber, two columns for oxygenation, two peristaltic pumps, two bubble traps, two flow heaters and one pressure sensor (Figure 1). Connect these components with tubing sections composed of silicone and polyvinyl chloride materials according to the scheme in Figure 2. Finally there are two circuits representing the fetal and maternal circuit, respectively.\nTurn on the water bath, the flow heaters and the heating for the perfusion chamber. The temperature should be 37 \u00b0C.\nWarm up the perfusion medium (NCTC-135 tissue culture medium diluted 1:2 with Earle's buffer (6.8 g/L sodium chloride, 0.4 g/L potassium chloride, 0.14 g/L monosodium phosphate, 0.2 g/L magnesium sulfate, 0.2 g/L calcium chloride, 2 g/L glucose) supplemented with glucose (1 g/L), dextran 40 (10 g/L), bovine serum albumin (10 g/L), sodium heparin (2,500 IU/L), amoxicilline (250 mg/L) and sodium bicarbonate (2.2 g/L); pH 7.4) in the water bath.\nConsecutively rinse the arterial systems of the fetal and maternal circuit with a) 200 ml distilled water, b) 50 ml 1% sodium hydroxide, c) 1% phosphoric acid and d) again 200 ml distilled water (flow rate: 15 - 20 ml/min).\nConnect the fetal cannula (\u00d8 1.2 mm; blunt needle should be attached to a modified winged needle infusion set) to the fetal arterial tubing.\nRinse the arterial systems of the fetal and maternal circuit with perfusion medium until all tubes contain medium (flow rate: 15-20 ml/min). During this step fill up the bubble traps and remove all bubbles downstream of the trap. Then stop the pumps. It is really important that the afferent arterial tubes are always free of bubbles; otherwise after cannulation especially the fine fetal vessels can rupture.Turn on the gas flow. The maternal circuit is oxygenated with 5% carbon dioxide and 95% synthetic air and the fetal circuit with 5% carbon dioxide and 95% nitrogen.\nStart the recording of the pressure sensor.\n2. Cannulating the Placenta\nObtain intact placentae from uncomplicated term pregnancies after primary cesarean section. Written consent has to be given (was obtained in the case of our studies) by the mothers before delivery and the study has to be approved by the local ethics committee (was the case in our studies). First visual control should be done by midwives to assure a healthy and intact placenta.\nCannulation of the placenta is a critical step! During perfusion every small disruption in the tissue can lead to a leak between the maternal and fetal circulation. The placenta has to be obtained within 30 min after delivery.\nSelect an intact cotyledon at the marginal zone of the placenta without visible disruptions on the maternal side. At the chorionic plate, tie up both associated branches of the umbilical artery and vein upstream to the later cannulation side (towards the umbilical cord) by using surgical suture material. Make always two knots.\nCannulate the fetal artery first. The fetal placental arteries are always smaller and thinner than the veins.\nMake a suture around the fetal artery, but do not tie it up immediately. Hold the vessel with a forceps, cut the vessel carefully and put the small cannula (\u00d8 1.2 mm) in the artery. Then tie up the suture (two knots).\nProceed with the fetal vein in the same manner but use a bigger cannula (\u00d8 1.5-1.8 mm; blunt needle should be attached to a modified winged needle infusion set).Turn on the fetal pump (2 ml/min). If there is no visible leak and blood emanates out of the fetal vein cannula, slowly increase the flow up to 4 ml/min. Observe the pressure in the fetal artery, it should not exceed 70 mmHg. If fluid leaks out at the fetal or maternal cannula fix them with another suture.\nPlace the placenta on the tissue holder with the fetal side up and pull the placental membrane and tissue over the spikes. In the end the perfused cotyledon should be in the middle of the hole in the tissue holder.\nStabilize the part where only the membrane holds the placenta with a silicone membrane (\u00d8 1 mm) or alternatively two parafilm pieces.\nAssemble the complete tissue holder, tighten the screws and cut the overhanging tissue. Please note that the venous and arterial cannulae are not pinched but instead lay in the small channels of the tissue holder.\nTurn the tissue holder upside down, put it into the perfusion chamber and add the cover. Now, the maternal side should be at the top. Check always if the fetal circuit is still intact and the medium is flowing out of the fetal vein tubing.\nTurn on the maternal pump (12 ml/min). Introduce the three blunt cannulae (\u00d8 0.8 mm) at the end of the maternal artery tube into the intervillous space by penetrating the decidual plate. To return the perfusate to the maternal circuit put one tube as venous drain which is also connected with the maternal pump to the lowest position in the upper part of the perfusion chamber.\nConnect the fetal vein cannula to the fetal vein tube.\n3. Executing the Pre- and Experimental Phase of PerfusionTo allow the tissue to recover from the ischemic period after delivery and to flush out the blood in the intervillous space, an open pre-phase of 20 min is necessary. That means the maternal and fetal vein are not leading back to the arterial reservoir containing the perfusion medium. Collect the fetal and maternal venous outflow in a bottle and discard it after the pre-phase.\nTo assess the integrity of the perfusion perform another pre-phase of 20 min but in a closed circuit. Use two separate reservoirs with perfusion medium for the fetal and maternal circuit and close the circuits by leading the fetal venous outflow back in the fetal reservoir and the maternal venous outflow back in the maternal reservoir.\nFor the main perfusion experiment prepare two flasks with 120 ml perfusion medium (one for the maternal and one for the fetal reservoir). Add the radiolabeled 14C-antipyrine (4 nCi/ml; serves as positive control; CAUTION: radioactive substance) and the fluorescently labeled xenobiotic or nanoparticles which one wants to analyze to the maternal reservoir. Mix the maternal perfusate well.\nStart the experiment by exchanging the pure perfusion medium with the two prepared flasks (fetal and maternal reservoirs). Close the circuits by leading the fetal venous outflow back in the fetal reservoir and the maternal venous outflow back in the maternal reservoir.\nContinue the perfusion for 6 hr and take samples regularly. Always resuspend the medium in the fetal and maternal reservoir before withdrawal.\nControl the pressure in the fetal artery (should not exceed 70 mmHg), pH in both circuits (should be in a physiological range 7.2-7.4) and the volume of both reservoirs (fetal volume loss should not exceed 4 ml/hr) during perfusion. If necessary adjust the pH values using either hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide.If the volume loss in the fetal reservoir exceeds 4 ml/hr there is a leak in the tissue and one has to stop the perfusion. The success rate of a perfusion for 6 hr without leak is about 15-20%.\nStop the perfusion after 6 hr. Turn out the pumps, water bath, flow heaters and gas flow.\nRemove the placenta from the tissue holder, cut the perfused cotyledon (brighter than the unperfused tissue) and weigh it.\nTake samples from unperfused (part of the placenta which was cut in the beginning; could be already taken during the pre-phase) and perfused tissue (each about 1 g) and store them at -20 \u00b0C until homogenization or in liquid nitrogen for later analysis. Fix another tissue sample in 4% formalin for histopathological evaluation. The samples should include all layers of the placenta.\nClean the tubes after perfusion by successively rinsing the arterial systems of the fetal and maternal circuit with a) 200 ml distilled water, b) 50 ml 1% sodium hydroxide, c) 50 ml 1% phosphoric acid and d) again 200 ml distilled water (flow: 15-20 ml/min).\nThe entire working procedure of the placenta perfusion experiment is depicted in Figure 3.\n4. Analyzing the Samples\nCentrifuge the perfusate samples for 10 min at 800 x g before analysis to remove residual erythrocytes. Take the supernatant for the further analysis. The samples can be left overnight at 4 \u00b0C. For the analysis of leptin and hCG production the samples can be stored at -20 \u00b0C.\nTo evaluate the permeability of the placenta analyze the 14C-antipyrine by liquid scintillation. Mix 300 \u03bcl of the fetal and maternal samples with 3 ml scintillation cocktail and measure for 5 min in a beta counter.To assess the transfer of the fluorescent nanoparticles or the xenobiotic of interest read the fluorescence at 485 nm excitation and 528 nm emission in a microplate reader (indicated wavelengths are for analysis of the yellow green label which we used for the nanoparticles).\nTo determine the viability of the placental tissue during perfusion measure the glucose consumption and lactate production in the fetal and maternal circuit with an automated blood gas system. Additionally, evaluate the production of the placental hormones human choriongonadotropin (hCG) and leptin in the homogenized tissue samples and the perfusates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nSubscription Required.

Preparation of pDawn-Ag43 Bacterial Strains\nTransform pDawn-Ag43 into an E. coli strain of interest (Figure 1).\n\t\nGrow a cloning strain hosting pDawn-Ag43 plasmid (obtainable from a plasmid repository) by inoculating the strain in LB broth supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL spectinomycin (LB+spec) in a culture tube (overnight in a shaking incubator at ~250 rpm, 37 \u00b0C). Then, use a miniprep kit to harvest the purified pDawn-Ag43 plasmid10.\nChoose an E. coli strain of interest to be patterned. Thus far, pDawn-Ag43 has been verified to work in MG16553 and BW25113.\nUse an established protocol to generate competent (e.g., chemically competent11 or electrocompetent12) stocks of the chosen E. coli strain (e.g., MG1655).\nTransform pDawn-Ag43 plasmid into the competent bacteria11,12, followed by 1 h recovery, and plate\u00a0on LB+spec agar plates. Allow colonies to grow overnight at 37 \u00b0C.\nStore the pDawn-Ag43 transformed strains.\n\t\nInoculate a single colony of pDawn-Ag43 from an LB+spec agar plate into LB+spec broth in a culture tube and grow it in a shaking incubator (at ~250 rpm, 37 \u00b0C) to exponential phase (OD600 ~0.4 - 0.8).\nPrepare stock to store the pDawn-Ag43 transformed strain at -80 \u00b0C long-term by mixing 1 mL of culture with 1 mL of 50% sterile glycerol in a cryo-tube to obtain a 25% glycerol freezer stock. Store this in a -80 \u00b0C freezer.\nIf additional plasmids (e.g., fluorescent reporter plasmids) need to be transformed, create competent cells11,12 from the pDawn-Ag43 transformed strain and repeat the transformation process11,12 for additional plasmids as needed.\n\t\tNOTE: If using electroporation8, it is possible to cotransform multiple plasmids (including pDawn-Ag43) simultaneously; however, a simultaneous transformation is not recommended using chemical transformation methods, as the large size (> 10 kB) of pDawn-Ag43 means transformation efficiencies are reduced.\n2. Preparation of the Projector Optical Set-up for Illuminating BacteriaObtain a bacterial incubator with non-transparent walls and a hole for passing cables, a portable projector capable of fitting and functioning inside the bacterial incubator, and a laptop equipped with software for presentation-projection (see Table of Materials). When choosing the projector and incubator, ensure that the minimal focus distance of the projector is less than the interior height of the incubator.\nPlace the projector inside the incubator at the bottom, with the aperture pointing directly upward, at the ceiling, where the biofilm culture chamber is attached (Figure 2).\nFix the projector in place by constructing a set-up with an optical breadboard base connected to a vertical post, in turn connected to a horizontal post which screws into the projector (Figure 2). Note that this set-up can be modified depending on the projector/available parts. Ultimately, the key requirement is that the projector is solidly fixed near the bottom of the incubator, with the aperture pointing upward.\nConnect the laptop via the display cable (e.g., HDMI) to the projector inside the incubator.\nIf the surfaces\u2014especially the ceiling\u2014of the interior of the incubator are reflective (e.g., metal polished surface), cover them with dark matte surfaces to minimize reflections.\nUse tape to attach an empty 'dummy' culture dish to the ceiling of the incubator. Note that, as with the projector, there are multiple acceptable ways to attach a culture dish; ensure that the transparent bottom surface of the culture chamber, where illumination occurs, is not covered.Adjust the focus on the projector by turning the focusing knob so that the focusing plane coincides with the bottom surface of the biofilm culture dish (e.g., a well plate) attached to the ceiling of the incubator (Figure 2). The projector should illuminate a sharp, non-blurry image onto the bottom of the culture dish. Remove the 'dummy' culture dish once the projection has been optimized.\nUsing laptop software, direct the projector to illuminate the full field of view with maximum blue illumination (e.g., RGB = [0, 0, 255]) by presenting a full blue slide.\nMeasure the illumination intensity of the projector using an optical power meter by placing the photodetector head at the incubator ceiling and reading the intensity on the corresponding power meter calibrated to light wavelength 460 nm. Follow the instructions on connecting and calibrating the photodetector for the specific power meter used.\n\t\nReduce ambient light (e.g., turn off room lights, or place the incubator away from light sources) as much as possible prior to making illumination intensity measurements.\nAdjust the illumination intensity using an adjustable neutral density filter placed at the projector aperture. Rotate the filter to adjust the illumination intensity measured by the power meter, until the illumination intensity in the center of the blue-light projected region reads 50 \u03bcW/cm2.\n\tNOTE: While it is possible to adjust the illumination intensity by using lower blue RGB values on the software end, using a filter while maximizing the blue RGB value has the advantage of maximizing the optical contrast of the system between illuminated vs. dark regions.\nDraw arbitrary patterns using the presentation/projector software on the laptop and display these patterns on the ceiling of the incubator, using the projector.NOTE: Biofilm-forming regions should be drawn with maximum blue illumination (e.g., RGB = [0, 0, 255]), non-biofilm-forming regions with no illumination (e.g., RGB = [0, 0, 0]).\n3. Culturing Patterned Biofilms\nPrior to illumination, prepare the pDawn-Ag43 bacteria, starting from the glycerol freezer stock, so that they are reliably induced at the late exponential growth phase for illumination (Figure 3A).\n\t\nStreak a pDawn-Ag43 strain from glycerol stock onto LB+spec agar plates. Allow colonies to grow overnight (37 \u00b0C).\n\t\tNOTE: From here until the illumination culture step, ensure the cells stay in the dark as much as possible\u2014brief periods at ambient illumination (e.g., for subdilution) are acceptable.\nInoculate a colony of pDawn-Ag43 bacteria from an agar plate in LB+spec broth and grow the culture overnight to\u00a0stationary phase (in a shaking incubator at ~250 rpm, 37 \u00b0C, for ~16 h).\nSubdilute the culture at a ratio of 1:1,000 with LB+spec broth (e.g.,\u00a0add 1 \u03bcL of overnight culture to 1 mL of fresh LB+spec).\nAllow the subdiluted culture to grow until\u00a0late exponential/early stationary phase (OD ~1.0, ~6 h in a shaking incubator at ~250 rpm, 37 \u00b0C).\nWhile waiting for the culture to grow, prepare M63 media with 1x M63 salts, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.2% glucose, 0.1% casamino acids, and 50 \u03bcg/mL spectinomycin in water (ensure the constituent parts are sterile).\nSubdilute the late-exponential-phase culture at a ratio of 1:100 with M63 media supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL spectinomycin. Then, introduce the dilution into a biofilm culture dish (e.g., pipette the diluted sample into a well plate).NOTE: The volumes required for this 1:100 subdilution depend on the culture dish being used (e.g., if using a 6-well polystyrene well plate [non-tissue-culture treated], a single sample would require adding 20 \u03bcL of culture to 2 mL of M63+spec, as the standard well volume of a 6-well plate is ~2 mL).\nAs the samples are now ready for illumination, tape the culture dish to the ceiling of the incubator, ensuring that the surface at the bottom of the dish is transparent for illumination from below by the projector.\n\tNOTE: It is important to ensure that the ceiling of the incubator is not reflective, to minimize stray illumination. Stray illumination can also be reduced by using black-walled plates as culture dishes, although this is not strictly necessary\u2014if using such plates, ensure the bottom surface is transparent.\nAllow the biofilms to culture in the incubator overnight (16 h with no shaking, at 37 \u00b0C). Note that some projectors become less reliable at higher temperatures. If that is the case, culture at lower temperatures (e.g., 30 \u00b0C), keeping in mind that the incubation time may need to be\u00a0increased, depending on the E. coli strain.\n4. Imaging Patterned Biofilms\nAfter the overnight growth of the biofilm samples, remove the culture dish from the incubator. The dish will have biofilm bacteria attached to its bottom surface where it has been illuminated, as well as planktonic bacteria dispersed in the liquid media above.\nDiscard the planktonic cells by removing the liquid media from the culture dish (e.g., by gently aspirating with a pipette).\nRinse the sample 2x with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to remove the remaining planktonic cells (Figure 3B) by gently pipetting in PBS, followed by aspiration.If the cells are fluorescently tagged, directly image the samples using fluorescence microscopy13 (e.g., wide-field13, 3-D confocal14, etc.).\n\tNOTE: Fluorescent biofilms can also be preserved using a self-hardening mounting medium. Apply one drop of mounting media to a biofilm sample, cover it with a glass coverslip, taking care not to capture any bubbles underneath, and allow it to harden overnight before imaging.\nIf the bacterial cells used are not fluorescently tagged, apply the crystal violet stain technique15 (Figure 3B) to enhance biofilm contrast prior to imaging.\n5. Protocol Modifications/Alternatives\nGrow pDawn-Ag43 bacteria on different surfaces.\n\t\nPut glass or poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) coupons (e.g., coverslips or thin strips of PDMS) into well plates prior to the addition of a bacterial sample/illumination, and follow the same protocol as before to pattern pDawn-ag43 biofilms on glass and PDMS.\nGrow pDawn-Ag43 bacteria inside a transparent, enclosed culture chamber.\n\t\nGenerate a culture chamber mold for PDMS.\n\t\t\nFor a basic culture chamber, generate mold by attaching a hard, rectangular prism to a flat surface (the prism will become a cavity in the PDMS that serves as the culture chamber once the mold is cast). Note that more intricate culture chamber molds can be fabricated using soft lithography16.\nCast a PDMS cavity by pouring PDMS into the mold and allowing it to cure (for a detailed soft lithography protocol, see JoVE's Science Education Database16).\nAfter curing, trim any excess PDMS, punch inlet/outlet channels into the cavity/culture chamber and bond the cavity to a flat surface (e.g., glass/polystyrene) by firmly pressing the PDMS onto the flat surface, leaving the cavity between the surface and the PDMS ceiling as the biofilm culture chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: More permanent bonding based on plasma treatment16 can also be used, but the chips will then not be reusable.Follow the culture protocol as before, using a syringe with blunt tip needles (instead of a pipette) to introduce the bacterial sample into the culture chamber/rinse with PBS buffer (Figure 3C).\n\t\t\nIf using a temporarily bonded cavity, use only negative pressure to pull liquid into/out of the chamber, to ensure that the cavity does not become unbonded from the underlying glass/polystyrene surface.\nGrow pDawn-Ag43 bacteria using a film photomask for structured illumination.\n\t\nDesign a biofilm pattern using CAD software compatible with a film photomask printer/print service. The photomask film design should be clear in regions where the biofilm is meant to be printed, and black/opaque elsewhere. When complete, send the photomask file to the printer/printing service and await the return of the physical photomask.\nInstruct the projector to illuminate a full field of view with maximum blue illumination (e.g., RGB = [0, 0, 255]) using laptop software.\nCut out a region of interest from the larger film photomask, and tape it directly to the bottom of the biofilm culture dish prior to introducing the bacterial sample for overnight illumination (Figure 3D). Culture the biofilms as before and remove the photomask after culturing, prior to imaging.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue dissociation\nTiming: 1\u20132 h\nThe protocol below describes the steps required to process whole tumor tissue specimen into a homogenized cell suspension required to establish cell lines.\nPrepare complete papain solution for tissue dissociation:\nNote: Thaw DNase and Papain aliquots on ice prior to starting.\nActivate the papain by adding 1\u00a0mL of activating papain solution to an aliquot of 81\u00a0\u03bcL papain.\nIn a 15\u00a0mL falcon tube, mix 4\u00a0mL of PBS, 100\u00a0\u03bcL of HEPES and the activated papain solution.\nFilter the mixture through a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm syringe filter into a new 15\u00a0mL falcon tube.\nNote: This mixture should be used within 45\u00a0min of activation.\nTransfer the tissue specimen and the DMEM/F12 transport media into a 50\u00a0mL falcon tube, and centrifuge at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nNote: The described protocol is optimized for tissue specimens of at least 100\u00a0mg which typically yields sufficient number of cells to test several media conditions.

Blood sample preparation\nDraw approximately 10 mL of whole blood from a Stage IV Cancer patient into two 5 mL vacutainers.\nCentrifuge the tubes for ten minutes at 3,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).\nThe blood sample will separate into three different layers: the bottom layer comprises the erythrocytes, the middle layer, also called the buffy coat, contains leukocytes and melanoma cells, and the top layer contains plasma and platelets. Remove as much plasma as possible without disturbing the buffy coat.\nPlace 250 \u03bcL of Histopaque 1077 in two 1 mL Wintrobe tubes.  \nUsing a 9\u2033 Pasteur Pipette, extract the remaining plasma, the entire buffy coat, and even the top layer of erythrocytes, making sure to collect < 500 \u03bcL.\nPlace the solution atop the Histopaque layer and centrifuge the Wintrobe tubes in 15 mL conical tubes for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm.  \nThe blood will again separate, but this time the erythrocytes will be separated by the Histopaque, allowing for easy extraction of the buffy coat.  Use a 9\u2033 Pasteur Pipette to obtain the entire buffy coat and place it in a 2 mL eppendorf tube.  \nSuspend the buffy coat in 1.5 mL of PBS with 2% v/v Tween 20.  \n2. Flow Chamber Construction\nObtain an acrylic cylinder, 20 mm outer diameter, 17 mm inner diameter, and 8 mm tall.  Drill three 5 mm diameter holes through the side of the cylinder at 90 degree angles from each other. Cut three pieces of polymer tubing (1.6 mm inner diameter, 5 mm outer diameter), and place them into the drilled holes.\nStretch Parafilm across the bottom of the acrylic ring to make a water tight seal. The parafilm forms a shallow bowl with the acrylic ring and will hold the acrylamide solution that will form a flow chamber.Suspend a 1.6 mm diameter wire through the pieces of tubing that are across from each other, making sure that the wire alone is visible through the middle of the ring. Fill the third piece of tubing with a 1.6 mm diameter wire and position the tube 1 mm away from the suspended wire.  These wires prevent acrylamide from entering the tubing.  After the acrylamide solidifies, the wires will be extracted, leaving a cylindrical flow path and a place to position an optical fiber focuses onto the flow path.\nAdd 5 mL of prepared acrylamide [20 g acrylamide (Sigma Aldrich), 0.7 g bisacrylamide (Sigma Aldrich), 100 mL of distilled water] to a small beaker. Measure out 0.02 g of ammonium persulfate (Sigma) and add it to the beaker. Mix with a stir bar for 3 minutes. Add 20 \u03bcL tetramethylethylenediamene (Fisher Scientific) to the beaker. Quickly pour the mixture into the acrylic ring, filling to the top. After a few seconds, the solution will gel, making a flow chamber mold. Carefully pull the wires out, making sure not to disturb the acrylamide gel. The flow chamber is now ready for use.\n3. Photoacoustic flowmetry set-up\nAcoustically couple a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric acoustic transducer (Panametrics) to a flow chamber using ultrasound gel directly above the flow path.\nUsing a Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) cable, connect the transducer to the input of a RITEC Broadband Receiver-640A (lowpass filter: out, highpass filter: 1 MHz, imput impedance: 50 Ohms, amplification: 35 dB). Connect the output of the filter to the oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 2024B). To trigger the oscilloscope, a photodiode (Thorlabs) is set up near the transducer and is plugged into the oscilloscope using a BNC cable.A t-connector (Small Parts) is attached to one arm of the flow chamber. Two syringe pumps (Braintree Scientific) are connected to the other branches of the connector. One syringe contains air, while the other will contain the cell suspension prepared in part 1. Set the flow rates to 100 \u03bcL/minute.\nExtract the small tubing of the flow chamber until a small pocket of air forms, and insert a 1 mm diameter core optical fiber with a 0.37 numerical aperture in that slot. Fill the pocket with water to reduce interface signals and increase the amount of laser light applied to the flow path.  Due to the numerical aperture of the optical fiber and short distance to the flow path, the laser will only irradiate one slug of sample at any given time, ensuring that the sample directly in front of the laser is the same sample creating photoacoustic signals.  The laser energy should be approximately 28 mJ/cm2 with a spot size of 7 mm2.\nTurn both syringe pumps on. When the two immiscible fluids reach the t-junction they will be partitioned into homogeneous slugs and flow past the transducer.\nIrradiate the flowing sample with a nanosecond pulsed laser to generate photoacoustic waves in the melanoma cells.  As melanin is a broadband optical absorber, any visible laser wavelength can be used.  \nIf a signal appears on the oscilloscope when a slug is atop the transducer, the slug contains melanoma, and should be tracked through the system until dropping into a collection vial.\n4. ImmunocytochemistryTake the captured slugs to a Cytospin 4 Centrifuge (Thermo Scientific) in order to fix them to glass slides. Place glass slides into Cytofunnels (Shandon EZ Single Cytofunnel with Brown Filter Card Thermo Scientific) and load them into the Cytospin 4 Centrifuge. Put 100 \u03bcL of 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma) in PBS into each funnel and then centrifuge at 600 rpm for 3 minutes to help the captured cells stick to the glass slides.\nAfter centrifugation, add the cell samples to the Cytofunnels and then centrifuge at 600 rpm for 3 minutes. Then spray the slides with an ethanol based fixative.\nWash the slides in PBS for 10 minutes twice.\nTo block nonspecific binding, incubate each slide with a mixture of 10 \u03bcL of Goat Serum (Sigma) and 90 \u03bcL of PBS for 1 hour at room temperature.\nAfter the incubation, decant the slides and incubate with the primary antibody solution for 1 hour in a humidified chamber at room temperature. Each slide should contain 1% MART-1 antibody raised in rabbit, 1% CD-45 antibody raised in mouse, 10% Goat serum, and 89% PBS.\nAfter incubation, wash the slides in PBS for 10 minutes three times.\nThe slides are then incubated in a secondary antibody solution, which has fluorophore bound to the antibodies. The mixture contains 0.05% goat anti-rabbit antibody, 0.05% goat anti-mouse antibody, 0.1% goat serum, and 99% PBS. The slides are incubated in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature.\nAfter incubation, decant the slides wash in PBS for 5 minutes three times.\nTo stain for a nucleus, incubate the cells with 0.1 \u03bcg/mL of DAPI (Invitrogen) for 1 minute. Then decant the slides and wash in PBS.Mount a coverslip over the cell sample using 20 \u03bcL of a resin-based mounting media per slide. Seal the coverslip with clear nail polish to preserve the slide. Now the slides are ready to be imaged with a fluorescent microscope.\n5.

Place the bones in sterile PBS in a 50 ml plastic tube.\nRemove all muscles and ligaments from the bones without breaking them. NOTE: It is important that the bone remains intact to avoid linkage of flushing solution or contamination with ethanol. Rinse the peeled bones in 70% ethanol for 5 min.\nUnder the sterile laminar flow hood, cut both tips of the bones with scissors. Flush the bone marrow by injecting sterile PBS from the bone extremity. Collect marrow into a 15 ml tube. Centrifuge 7 min at 300 x g.\nRemove the supernatant.

Connect the intubation catheter to a rodent ventilator programmed for 2.5 L/min oxygen, 2.5% isoflurane, tidal volume of 2 ml, and a breathing frequency of 90 breaths/min.\nPrepare a buprenorphine solution at 0.1 mg/kg. Inject subcutaneously one third of the solution. Shave the left part of the thorax. Disinfect with a 1% Betadine solution.\nIncise the skin perpendicular to the sternum at the fourth intercostal space. Separate the 3 layers of thoracic muscle (pectoralis major, ascending pectoralis, and external oblique pectoralis). Open the fourth intercostal space (between ribs 4 and 5).Use a small retractor to spread the ribs and to expose the heart. Open the pericardium carefully. Locate and ligate the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with a 7.0 suture 4 mm below the atrium.\nClose the intercostal space with two stitches using 3.0 sutures. Position the two sutures proximally and distally from the sternum. First, tighten the distal suture. Clamp the ventilator exhaust tubing for 2 sec in order to inflate the chest and avoid any pneumothorax. Tighten the second suture. Position the muscles layers back in place (no sutures are needed). Close the skin with a 5.0 suture.\nDisinfect the suture with 1% Betadine solution. Inject the rest of the buprenorphine solution. Turn off the anesthesia system. Remove intubation catheter.\nKeep the rat in the cage under a warm Lamp for 1-2 hr. Keep a thermometer in the cage and control the distance between the warm lamp and the cage in order to avoid over heating.  Return the rat in the IVC unit.

Epicardial Administration of the Treatment Via a Second Thoracotomy\nRepeat steps 2.1-2.3.\nIncise the skin perpendicular to the sternum at the fifth intercostal space. Separate the 3 layers of thoracic muscle (pectoralis major, ascending pectoralis and external oblique pectoralis). Open the fifth intercostal space (between ribs 5 and 6).\nUse a small retractor to spread the ribs and to expose the heart. If there is some adherence, carefully remove them with fine forceps.Locate the infarct area that appears as a pale area below the ligature. NOTE: When necessary, use a 10 cm piece of suture (7.0) inserted at the apex to better visualize the left ventricle. Pull gently to the suture maintained loosely by a clamp to expose the heart.\nApply one of the following treatments:\n\t\nPosition the biograft at the surface of the heart. Use the prefilled fibrin sealant syringe prewarmed at room temperature for 10 min. Apply a drop (50-100 \u03bcl) of fibrin sealant under the biograft using a 25 G Luer needle.

Twenty-four hours later, transfer the cryovial to liquid nitrogen (\u2212196 \u00b0C) for long-term storage.To defrost the cryopreserved cells, remove the cryovial from the nitrogen storage and, within 1 min, transfer 1 mL of the content into a 15 mL conical tube containing 9 mL of the transport medium preheated to 37 \u00b0C.\nCarefully resuspend and then centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 200 x g. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in the required volume of the growth medium and place them on a Petri dish of the required diameter.\n3. Cell cultivation\nCover the dish bottom with autoclaved 0.1% gelatin solution prepared in distilled water. Incubate for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: For transfection visualization, glass-bottom plate dishes (confocal dishes with glass thickness 170 \u00b5m) should be used.\nPrepare a culture medium having the following composition: DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Mix thoroughly and store at 4 \u00b0C. Warm the medium to 37 \u00b0C before adding to the cells.\nAssess the culture under the microscope. Remove the medium and wash the fibroblasts with Dulbecco's phosphate-salt solution (DPBS).\nAdd 1 mL of pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin solution to the cells. Check the cells under the microscope if they detach from the substrate completely. Deactivate trypsin with 1 mL of the culture medium.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the tube at 200 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of the culture medium.\nCount the number of cells. Calculate the required number of cells to seed them with a density of 8-15 x 103/cm2 and resuspend in 2 mL of the culture medium.\nRemove the gelatin solution from the culture dish and immediately add 2 mL of the cell suspension. Cultivate fibroblasts at 37 \u00b0C in a CO2 incubator.Refresh the medium every 2-4 days.\n\t\u200bNOTE: For experiments, use the cells of 4-11 passages.\n4. Transfection\nReplace the culture medium with a fresh culture medium 24 h before transfection.\n\tNOTE: The cell confluence should be 70-80%.\nPrepare a DNA-lipid complex based on the area and density of the cell seeding. Use liposome-based transfection agent.\n\tNOTE: Use the cell seeding density as 1 x 104 cells/cm2.\nAdd 3 \u00b5L of commercial transfection reagent to 125 \u00b5L of optimal minimal essential medium (Opti-MEM) not containing any antibiotics, without touching the walls of the tube.

Analyze the efficiency of transfection after 24 h and 48 h.\n\t\u200bNOTE: 24 h after transfection, the efficiency was 10-15%, and after 48 h up to 40%.\n5. Preparing for imaging\nBefore live imaging of cells, change the culture medium to a medium without pH-indicator dye to reduce autofluorescence.\nCarefully apply mineral oil to the medium surface to completely cover the medium, isolating it from the external environment to reduce the O2 penetration and the medium evaporation.\nUse a mercury lamp and oil immersion 60x or 100x objective lens with a high numeral aperture to take the images.NOTE: For in vivo observations, the microscope must be equipped with an incubator to maintain the necessary conditions for the cells, including heating the object table and the lens to +37 \u00b0C, a closed chamber with CO2 supply, and humidity level support. Use double distilled water to create humidity. Check the level of double distilled water before filming.\nPlace the confocal dish with the cells in the microscope holder before imaging. Ensure that the dish and the camera are securely attached to the holder to avoid drifting while taking images.\n6. Setting the imaging parameters\nChoose the low exposure values since light induces cell-damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n\tNOTE: To study the dynamics of microtubules in human skin fibroblasts, a 300 ms exposure was selected.\nFocus on the object of interest.\n\tNOTE: For long-term time-lapse imaging, use the automatic focus stabilization system to compensate for a possible shift along the z-axis.\nChoose the optimal imaging conditions depending on the cells' photosensitivity and the rate of the fluorochrome fading.\n\tNOTE: Since microtubules are highly dynamic structures, a reasonably short time interval can be selected, and the frame rate must be sufficiently high. To investigate the microtubule dynamics in skin fibroblasts, we used at a frequency of 1 frame/s for 3-5 min.\nWhen selecting the next object to get the image, move away from the already imaged area. Since this area was under the influence of light, there will be noticeable photo-bleaching.\n\tNOTE: Since a relatively high imaging frequency was used, the shutter did not close between images, and the lamp was lit for the entire period of imaging, which is why fading increased.Choose the optimal video for studying the microtubules' dynamics visually, taking into account the quality of transfection, the quality of the microtubules' images (optimal signal-to-noise ratio), and the absence of drifting in case of the analyzed cell (Figure 3).\nUse the selected videos to study the microtubules' plus-ends dynamics by tracing them in the ImageJ or Fiji program (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: For quantitative analysis instructions see Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary File 1.\nSubscription Required.

This cannot be achieved by stimulating RGCs in a single retina (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) because lateral connections within the retina result in the retinal ganglion cells receiving input from photoreceptor cells over large areas of the retina and interferes with the ability to control visually driven activity in individual neighboring RGCs (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/361-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Visual stimulation strategy\nRetinal ganglion cells (RGCs) on a retina cannot be stimulated independently. (A) Cartoon showing an attempt to stimulate two RGCs on a retina. (B) Drawing of retinal ganglion cells in frog (Cajal, 1972[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). RGCs extend dendrite over wide area in the retina. This induces unintended interaction of the two visual inputs within the retina. (C and D) To control visually driven activity in convergent RGCs, animals in which one tectal lobe is ablated are used, so both eyes innervate the remaining optic tectum. Each eye can be stimulated independently. The green and pink traces are activity in the tectal cells evoked by the green and pink retinal ganglion cells, respectively.\nTo resolve this issue and test the effect of sequential patterns of afferent activity on axon arbor plasticity and visual system plasticity, we used a classical experimental protocol to ablate one optic tectal lobe, which induces inputs from both eyes to converge on the remaining tectal lobe (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Under these conditions, stimulating the left and right eyes in sequence allows temporal control over the activity in the convergent inputs and the ability to study visual experience-driven plasticity in the convergent retinal inputs independent of potential effects within the retina.Electroporate retinal ganglion cells\nTiming: 4\u00a0h (over 2\u00a0days)\nPlasmid solution containing p \u03b1-actinin:GAL4/UAS:TdTomato ((Bestman and Cline, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Koster and Fraser, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) https://www.addgene.org/161712/[href=https://www.addgene.org/161712/]) and pUAS:Synaptophysin-GFP (Hiramoto and Cline, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Ruthazer et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) is pressure injected into the intravitreal space between the retina and the lens using a Picospritzer. An electric pulse is applied immediately after injecting the plasmid solution. A single high voltage electric pulse (52 V) is used to drive plasmids into the RGCs. The relatively high voltage is necessary because the efficiency of electroporating RGCs is relatively low, for instance compared to optic tectal cells, where pulses of <35\u00a0V are sufficient. Applying a single pulse will label a single RGC or a few identifiable cells suitable for in vivo imaging. Using a small anode targets electroporation to a few cells, while using a large cathode reduces potential tissue damage by decreasing the density of the electric field at the cathode (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAnesthetize animals: Place an animal in 0.02% MS-222 at 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C for less than 1\u00a0min. As soon as the animal stops moving, transfer it to Steinberg solution.\nMake an incision in the skin beneath the eyeball for inserting the anode behind the eye\nNote: Most of the retina is not close to the skin. To electroporate RGCs near the center of the retina, make an incision in the skin ventral to the eye ipsilateral to the ablated tectal lobe with a #30-gauge needle. Before making the incision, locate the optic nerve and be sure to avoid touching it with the needle (or the anode).\nSet the animal on the electroporation setup: Place the tadpole ventral side up on the stage of the electroporation rig. Remove excess water from around the tadpole during electroporation.\nInjecting plasmid solutionCentrifuge the plasmid solution at 20,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min. Take the supernatant and make a solution containing 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl p \u03b1-actinin:GAL4/UAS:TdTomato and 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl pUAS:Synaptophysin-GFP. Add Fast Green (0.01% final) to monitor the solution during injection.\nLoad a glass pipette with the plasmid solution. Use a commercially available loader (Eppendorf, Microloader #930001007) or one made from 1\u00a0mL plastic syringe (Bestman et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAttach the pipette to the Picospritzer. Break the glass pipette tip by gently touching it with a Kimwipe. Test the pipette by applying 90 psi pressure for 100\u00a0ms. If a drop of the solution does not come out of the pipette, break the pipette tip again and retest.\nHold the eyeball with forceps to prevent it from rotating. Pierce the skin over the eye at the border between the lens and the retina with the glass pipette. Inject the plasmid solution into the eye until the blue color of the solution can be seen in the eye. The more volume the better for the electroporation but do not overfill the eye or the solution will leak out.\nInsert the anode through the incision underneath the eye and position the tip of the anode behind the retina (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Gently place the cathode on top of the eye. Do not to push the solution out of the eye. Apply a single pulse of electric shock (52 V, 1.6\u00a0ms).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/361-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05. Electroporating the eyeAn incision (red line) is made in the skin to insert the anode to contact the back of the eye. The cathode is placed on the skin in front of the eye to make a large contact area. Electroporate immediately after injecting the DNA solution. Make sure that the DNA solution is retained between the retina and the lens before electroporation.\nTransfer the tadpole into fresh Steinberg solution.\nPrepare 100\u2013200 samples by repeating a\u2013f.\nCritical: If the solution leaks out of the eye, the cells will not be transfected. Discard these samples.\nAblate one tectal lobe\nTiming: 23\u201327\u00a0h (2\u00a0days)\nWait 24\u00a0h after electroporation. Anesthetize an animal in 0.02% MS-222 in Steinberg Solution. Then, transfer the animal into Steinberg solution. Make an incision at the center of the dorsal surface of the midbrain. Cut the entire anterior-posterior extent of the midbrain. Simultaneously, cut both optic nerves at the optic chiasma so inputs from both eyes regrow simultaneously into the remaining optic tectal lobe. This prevents differences in the degree of innervation from the left and right eyes. This protocol is modified from (Ruthazer et\u00a0al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCut the boundary between the right half of the midbrain and the hindbrain. The incision should extend to the ventral aspect of the midbrain to cut through both the tectum and tegmentum. Cut at the anterior edge of the optic tectum.Pull a glass capillary and attach it to the microcapillary holder (Drummond). Break the tip to make an 100\u00a0\u03bcm diameter opening. Connect the tube to a vacuum line. Suck out the right tectal lobe and tegmentum. (The tegmentum is removed to decrease the likelihood of the right optic tectum regenerating.) Transfer the tadpole to fresh Steinberg solution. Maintain the animals at 18\u00b0C 20\u201324\u00a0h to slow down development during recovery, then move the animals to an incubator at 22\u00b0C.\nCritical: Never expose the animals to MS222 after surgery. Animals with incisions are very sensitive to MS-222. This surgery needs to be precise. If the ablation is incomplete, the tectum will regenerate. If the ablation extends beyond the optic tectum, the midbrain will become deformed.\nScreen samples\nTiming: 1\u20132 h\nSet an animal on a Sylgard block with a hole carved in the Sylgard to hold the tadpole comfortably. Add a few drops of Steinberg\u2019s solution and place a coverslip over the tadpole. Use a regular fluorescent microscope or a spinning disc confocal microscope (ex, Perkin Elmer/Yokogawa CSU-X1) with a 20\u00d7 objective lens to identify animals in which one or a few labeled RGC axons project to the single ipsilateral tectal lobe. Screening with a spinning disc confocal microscope produces less damage than a regular fluorescent microscope.\nProvide visual stimulationNote: To stimulate only one eye, it is important to prevent stimulation of the other eye. This is particularly a problem in tadpoles and some fish because the animals may be translucent at stages when experiments are done. As shown in Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A, light presented to one of the two eyes results in activity in both eyes, seen by recording the optic nerves and neurons in each optic tectal lobe. One way to prevent indirect activation of the \u201cother\u201d eye is to stimulate it with persistent illumination (masking light) of sufficient luminance, because the RGCs respond to changes in luminance (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). Provide a masking light to one eye and a light OFF stimulus to the other eye. This produces robust eye-specific OFF responses, compared to the less robust ON stimulus response. In addition, the light OFF stimulus causes less relative illuminance change in the \u201cother\u201d eye. To further optimize control of the eye-specific light OFF responses, when the off stimulus is generated, the LEDs can be dimmed instead of turned off completely.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/361-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. Strategy to stimulate one eye\n(A) Unilateral visual stimulation activates both eyes. Electrophysiological recordings from the left and right optic nerves and whole cell recording from neurons in the left and right optic tecta show responses in the retinal ganglion cell axons and the tectal cells respectively following unilateral visual stimulation (red LED and lines indicate visual stimulus). In tadpoles each eye projects axons primarily to the contralateral optic tectum. Stimulus timing is indicated with arrowheads. The light presented to one eye stimulates both eyes due to scattering and reflection.(B) Masking light presented to one eye (red) prevents the indirect activation of the eye receiving the masking light and results in unilateral responses to the eye receiving the direct visual stimulation (black LED and lines indicate OFF visual stimulation).\n(C) For repeated presentation of OFF stimuli, the LED has to be turned on for the next OFF stimulation; however even a stepwise increase in light intensity can indirectly stimulate the other eye (red circle).\n(D) Gradually increasing LED intensity prevents the unintended indirect stimulation of the eye. In this example, the ramp of increased intensity was 11\u00a0s long. The recordings were collected in voltage clamp mode at \u221270\u00a0mV.\nNote: To turn the light on in preparation for the next OFF stimulation, the LED intensity is gradually increased over a period of 5\u00a0s or longer (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C and 6D). Gradually turning the light on or off enables generation of exclusive OFF or ON stimuli, respectively. Since ON responses and OFF responses are thought to encode different information in the visual system (Kremkow et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Lee et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), the opportunity to provide one or the other stimulus independently would be useful for studying the contributions of ON responses and OFF responses to the sensory experience-dependent plasticity. In addition to the convergent circuit shown here, this method is also useful to study inter-tectal communication in the visual system.\nInducing plasticity in the visual circuit with sequential visual inputs\nSet the visual stimulator (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1])\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_361_2.csv\nKey# corresponds to the number of the keys from the left top. To start the stimulation program, push key#7. To stop and reset, push key#8.Start with an example to generate sequential OFF stimuli with a 15\u00a0ms interval between the right and left eye stimulation, with the right eye stimulated first. Set the stimulation cycle to 11 s.\nConnect the circuit board to 12\u00a0V AC adaptor.\nConnect the wires from the tadpole stimulation chamber to the circuit board. The sockets are located on the upper edge of the circuit board. The LEDs on the left and the right acrylic plates are connected to left and the right slots, respectively. Up to 8 animal chambers can be connected.\nTurn on the two toggle switches at left corner.\nPush key#2 and push key#5/6 until dt is set at \u201c15\u201d ([ms] interval between left and right eyes (L/R)).\nPush key#3 and push key#5/6 until u is set at \u201c1024\u201d (light ON intensity for right LED, \u201c1024\u201d is a setting for the maximum intensity. \u201c0\u201d is off.).\nPush key#4 and push key#5/6 until d is set at \u201c192\u201d (light OFF intensity for right LED).\nLong push key#2 and push key#5/6 until it is set at \u201c1024\u201d (light ON intensity of left LED).\nLong push key#3 and push key#5/6 until D is set at \u201c192\u201d (light ON intensity of left LED).\nPush key#1 and push key#5/6 until I is set at \u201c11\u201d ([s] cycle time interval).\nLong push key#4 and push key#5/6 until p is set at \u201c1\u201d (ramp speed).\nLong push key#7 until \u201c10 h\u201d is displayed (stimulation time).\nPush key# 7 to start stimulation. This switches LEDs on. Then, the cycles of OFF stimulus followed by ramping ON start.\nPlacing animals in the stimulation chamberSelect a chamber in which the gap between the acrylic plates fits the width of the tadpole. The anterior of the animal is supported with a Sylgard block and the tail is supported by Sylgard strips (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The dorsal side is covered with a coverslip. The coverslip is attached to the acrylic plate with utility wax.\nDrug application\nTo investigate the mechanisms regulating plasticity, drugs can be introduced to the bath solution (tank water) at different times depending on the experimental design.\nUse-dependent NMDAR block to dissect plasticity mechanisms\nNMDAR are thought to play several roles in neuronal and circuit plasticity. Because MK801 is a use-dependent NMDAR antagonist, this drug enables analysis of the requirement for NMDAR in specific components of neural circuits if they can be selectively stimulated. In addition, NMDAR response amplitudes are thought to encode information regulating plasticity. Here, we demonstrate how to take advantage of the use-dependent blockade by MK801 to address this hypothesis. We used MK801 to attenuate the NMDAR activity in one of the two retinotectal pathways. This procedure needs to be done in a dark room because visual stimulus from room lights is sufficient for MK801 to block NMDAR. To stimulate one of the two eyes, the \u201cother\u201d eye is illuminated with 100% intensity of LED light to avoid either ON or OFF responses and the active eye is stimulated with light off stimulus from LED. We stimulated OFF responses only and avoided ON responses by gradually turning on the LED.\nPlace animals in the stimulation chamber and put the chamber in a light-tight black container with about 150\u00a0mL capacity. Fill the container with 50\u00a0mL Steinberg solution.Stimulate the right eye with dimming light (from maximum illumination to complete off, 20% change /s in the turn on period, 5.5 s/stimulation cycle). Stimulate the left eye with persistent light at 100% luminance. Continue stimulation for 5\u00a0min. This pre-stimulation prevents strong activation by the first light stimulus after the dark environment.\nAdd 50\u00a0mL of 4\u00a0\u03bcM MK801 in Steinberg\u2019s solution to the chamber so the final concentration is 2\u00a0\u03bcM MK801. Continue the stimulation protocol for 14\u00a0min.\nAfter a total of 15\u00a0min exposure to MK801, turn off the stimulation and immediately pour 50\u00a0mL Steinberg solution into the chamber to rapidly dilute the MK801. Then, drain all the MK801 solution and replace with 50\u00a0mL fresh Steinberg\u2019s solution. Wash with 50\u00a0mL fresh Steinberg solution three more times.\nSet the controller for both eyes at 100%\u201318.8% (max-min luminance) for the off stimulation, 11\u00a0s per stimulation cycle, and 8\u00a0h for duration.\nWhen 15\u00a0min has passed after the LED was turned off, start the visual stimulation.\nImage the RGC axonsTo analyze structural changes in axon arbor morphology, collect time-lapse images of the axons at intervals from 1 to 24 h, depending on the experimental design. Quantifying branch dynamics can demonstrate directed growth of axon arbors. Our previous experiments showed that projection sites of convergent axons within the optic tectum shift relative to one another when they are stimulated in a sequence. Axons that are stimulated 15\u201350\u00a0ms earlier or later shift their arbor position in the rostral or caudal direction, respectively. Daily imaging is suitable to detect directed growth of axons. Image samples at shorter intervals, such as every 1\u20132\u00a0h over 4\u20138 h, to analyze the spatial distribution of branch dynamics that contribute to the directed arbor growth (Hiramoto and Cline, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Ruthazer et\u00a0al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). For time-lapse in vivo imaging, collect the images with a spinning disc microscope, confocal, or multiphoton microscope immediately before the next visual stimulation period. An advantage of multiphoton microscopes is that animals are not exposed to visual experience from the scanning laser during the image acquisition. The image data are analyzed with Imaris (Oxford Instruments) or other image processing software.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransformation and expression of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro\nTiming: 4\u00a0days\nTransform pET28a(+) plasmid, which contains target gene, to the E.\u00a0coli BL21 (DE3) Rosetta\u2122 2 competent cells.\nResuspension of plasmid\nTake a sterile 50\u00a0mL falcon tube and fill it with EDI ultrapure water.\nTake the commercial plasmid tube.\nSpin lyophilized plasmid down at 5000\u00a0rpm (2650 g) for 2\u00a0min.\nAdd 25\u00a0\u03bcL EDI ultrapure water directly on lyophilized plasmid (bottom of the tube).\nVortex it for 10 s.\nSpin it down at 5000\u00a0rpm (2650 g) for 2\u00a0min.\nRepeat steps c. and d. three times.\nCritical: Do NOT open the commercial plasmid tube without spinning it down.

Consider a minimum pixel count above 2 and adc-threshold of 500 with a minimum signal to noise ratio of 7 as a peak. Classify an image with a minimum of 20 peaks as a crystal hit.\nGenerate the small data providing each event including hits, resolution.\nThe hits were calibrated (detector gain threshold applied) and converted to HDF5 file format using Cheetah, including entries for the image data, instrument data and event codes.\nObservable hot pixels and bad detector areas (such as the panel edges) were masked out during peak finding by applying a mask in HDF5 format (consisting of zeros and ones, which gets multiplied with the image data).\nCritical: Accurate peak positions are required for correct indexing and reflection intensity determination of the diffraction pattern, hence it is critical to complete this step meticulously.\nOptimize the detector geometry by updating the mask as well as optimizing the mapping\u00a0of the detector panels to the lab frame. The latter can be done using geoptimiser, which is included in the CrystFEL package up to version 0. 9.1.

For an indexing solution to be correct, it is important for any observed peaks to align with these predictions.Critical: For accurate intensity determination of the individual reflections, the integration rings should be adjusted for optimal local background subtraction. In detail, the narrowest integration radius should be set to the size of the broadest peak observed and the middle and widest integration radii set an annulus between which the local background contribution to the respective reflection is estimated and subsequently subtracted.\nObtain CrystFEL stream file that contains a list of intensity values for every reflection predicted by the indexing solution in every indexable pattern.\nReiterate through the detector geometry optimization, adjusting the panel positions relative to the beam ensuring the most accurate indexing results.\nCritical: Detector geometry correction is exceedingly important for SFX experiments. Normally, the same geometry files from the previous experiment are used. However, detector geometry optimization is inevitable when the interaction point or the detector motor position has changed.\nIndex the hits by using CrystFEL version 0.9.0.

If performing differentiation in a smaller plate adjust media volume accordingly \\(for instance 3ml of N2B27 in a 12 well).\n**Maintenance of hPSCs**\n1. Human pluripotent stem cells are routinely cultured on matrigel in mTeSR1 medium. Cultures are passaged every 3-5 days using Accutase. \n  2.

Magnetic separation \\(MACS) of CD144-positive cells\n  \nNote: The following protocol describes the enrichment of CD144 positive endothelial cells using an autoMACSpro. Those cells can also be sorted using a manual MACS or by FACS using the PE-CD144 antibody.\nBefore starting sorting coat the appropriate type and number of plates required with fibronectin.

Seed 2x10<sup>6</sup> cells in 20 ml StemPro34 + 50ng/ml VEGF on fibronectin coated plates or flasks \\(about 26000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>).\n  \n6. Differentiation and MACS sorting efficiency \\(optional)\n  Note: Differentiation and MACS sorting efficiency can be determined using flow cytometry and the CD144-PE antibody.  \n1. For differentiation efficiency keep 1x 105 as isotype control \\(IgG-Ab) \\(= sample 1), 1x 105 cells as unstained control \\(= sample 2), and label 1x 105 cells with CD144-PE antibody \\(sample 3).2. For sorting efficiency label 1x 105 cells of CD144 positive and negative fraction with CD144-PE antibody \\(sample 4 and 5).\n  \n3. Centrifuge the 5 samples in FACS tubes for 5min at 1\u2019000 rpm \\(210g).\n  \n4.  Resuspend each sample in 90\u00b5l cold MACS-Buffer.\n  \n5.  Keep sample 2 and add 10\u00b5l IgG Isotypic control or CD144-PE antibody in sample 1, 3, 4 and 5.\n  \n6.  Incubate for at least 15min at 4 \u00b0C.\n  \n7. Add 1ml cold MACS-Buffer and centrifuge 5min at 1\u2019000rpm\n  \n8.  Resuspend all samples in 250\u00b5l cold MACS-Buffer\n  \n9. Samples are ready for flow cytometry analysis.\n  10. \n7. Expansion of CD144-positive cells\n  1. Culture stem cell derived endothelial cells in StemPro34 + 50ng/ml VEGF until they reach confluency \\(usually 3-5 days). Cells can then be cryopreserved for further use \\(1.5x10<sup>6</sup> cell/vial) or expanded for functional assays such as in vitro angiogenesis assay. \n  Note: \nFor consistent reproducible results experiments should be conducted always at the same passage. We recommend to use differentiated endothelial cells between passage 3 and 4 and to not use them after passage 5. If compared to primary cells such as HUVECs, differentiated endothelial cells can be cultured in other media such as EGM2 medium \\(Cat# CC-3162, Lonza).", "Sampling: at least 1-cm- long fragment of PFD is sampled directly into the skull, ideally during anthropological or archeological survey.\nCleaning/decontamination: each sample is then cleaned by a fine scraping with non-contaminating plastic instruments and a delicate vaporization of pressured air on all the faces during 10 min. No gold covering is realized in order to be able to perform elemental analysis on the surface.\nEnvironmental SEM examination of each sample is directly performed on a Philips XL30 CP with X-ray microanalysis \\(energy-dispersive X-ray spectros- copy). The resolution of the microscope is 3.5 nm at 30 kV using the secondary electron detector. All images are stored using a standard resolution digital frame store.\nOptical microscope sample preparation is as follows:\n- The first step consists in a very fine fragmentation of the sample. This is justified by the fact that the PFD has no architecture of it own and that this fragmentation does not consist in a loss of information \\(since we worked in a microscopic scale). In addition, this reduction allows for a better penetration of the fixative substances.\n- In order to rehydrate and fix the samples, they are immersed in 20% diluted acetic acid for 48 h, in order to slowly decalcify the fragments of PFD.\n- A solution is obtained using the following two phases: a liquid phase made of the PFD in suspension and a solid-phase slope. These two phases are studied separately.- The cytological analysis of the PFD in suspension began with the sampling of 200 \u03bcL from the supernatant. This liquid is then centrifuged \\(800 turns per minute for 10 min) in order to obtain two spots per slide. Four slides are produced by sample: two slides are colored by the technique of Papanicolaou after a fixing of the spots with a lacquer; the two other slides are colored by the technique of the May\u2013Gr\u00fcnwald\u2013Giemsa \\(MGG) after fixing of the spots to the air.\n- The study of the remaining solid phase \\(base of centrifugation) is carried out after a new centrifugation \\(3,500 turns per minute for 10 min). The supernatant is kept in reserve \\(for a later possible cytological study) while the base is recuperated, then fixed 24 h in the AFA \\(acetic acid, formaldehyde, alcohol). As soon after fixation and decalcification, the sample is put in cassette on a foam, followed by the traditional circuit of inclusion \\(dehydration in xylene and increasing alcohol baths, then inclusion in liquid paraffin, cooling, section with the microtome \\(from 6 to 10 \u03bcm), deposit on an albumenized slide, air-drying free, dewaxing and rehydration by immersion in xylene then in decreasing alcohol baths to distilled water). Several colorations are carried out for each sample: periodic acid Schiff, Gram, toluidine blue, and hema- toxylin, eosin, saffron \\(HES).", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHuman lung tissue processing\u00a0& cryopreservation\nTiming: 2\u00a0days\nThis step allows the selection of suitable tissues for cryopreservation and airway organoid generation based on tissue anatomy, elimination of necrotic or damaged areas, and cryopreservation of multiple vials from different regions of the lung.\nLung tissue processing (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]): Receive human lung tissue under clean/sterile conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3147-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Count the cells within 3\u20135\u00a0min of mixing with trypan blue, on the four corner squares plus the central big square of the chamber (5 big squares total). At this point, we expect to obtain 5 to 7.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells/mL with a viability of 80%\u201390%.

This leads to a distinct single cell suspension, free from intact organoids. If necessary, repeat the steps above from (vi) to (x).\nResuspend the cells in a mix of ice-cold AO media and liquid Cultrex growth factor reduced BME type 2.\nReplate 300 000 cells/40\u00a0\u03bcL as a dome.\nRepeat the steps above from (b)\u00a0to (i).\nAfter each dissociation, count cells.\nCryopreserve at least 3\u20134 cryovials with 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells/mL/vial in FBS with 10% DMSO.Note: Having these backup stocks for later expansion is critical as bacterial or fungal contamination may occur during the expansion, which is a risk while working with primary tissues. Once the organoids are clear of the connective tissue, (after approximately 4\u20137 passages), generate a large frozen stock of dissociated organoids at 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells/cryovial. At this stage, there are usually 3\u20134, P24-well plates of organoids in culture from which you could expect to produce 20\u201325 cryovials.\nCritical: During the initial 1\u20134 passages, there is a substantial amount of connective tissue, which gradually decreases with each passage (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Perform a quality control check on domes containing spherical organoids free of connective tissue (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).

After viral exposure, harvest ALIs daily from 1 to 6\u00a0days post-infection.

Readouts to assess response to a virus, ALI culture OCT embedding, and OCT cutting\n(A) Schematic workflow presenting five methods to assess response to virus. Flow cytometry and RNA extraction require tissue dissociation versus Immunofluorescence, plaque assay (viral titer on apical supernatant) and GeoMx WTA do not require tissue dissociation.\n(B) Procedure of embedding ALIs in OCT and cryopreservation. First, turn the insert upside-down, and with a scalpel cut the mesh in the middle and partially around the edges, enough to hold the mesh and pull out from the insert. Be careful not to damage the cell layer. Place the ALI mesh on top of a layer of OCT and cover it with OCT to fully embed the ALI insert. Gently, with a pipette tip make sure the ALI is not curved or too close to the bottom or surface of the cryomold. Then, snap freeze in liquid nitrogen. To ensure no liquid nitrogen (LN) enters the tissue, the cryomold should be placed on top of a plastic lid resistant to LN.(C) ALI section cutting and transfer to Superfrost plus slides. Make a mark with a Sharpie pen to indicate the location of the ALI culture on the cryomold then on the solidify OCT block.

Examples of expected outcomes of transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 variants and ROI selection for GeoMx data(A) Heatmap representing differentially expressed genes over time in response to SARS-CoV-2 variants. ALI cultures from four donors were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and harvested for sequencing at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 dpi, and mock-infected (control media without virus) samples were collected from days 1 through 6\u00a0days as well. The sequencing was performed in multiple batches with at least 2 independent experiments at each time-point, the cut-off used for defining differentially expressed genes: |logFC|\u00a0>\u00a01;   adjusted  p \u2212  value  \u00a0<\u00a00.01; normalized counts   >   10. Rows represent individual transcripts and columns represent individual biological replicates ordered by time-points and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Batch effect was removed using SVAseq R package. All variants induced expression of genes associated with the viral response at later time-points. This response to the virus from 1 to 6 DPI is depicted by the schematic covering the heatmap, with two \u201cclusters\u201d: one on the lower part \u201cdown-regulation\u201d from 1 to 6 DPI, enriched for cilia and epithelium maintenance signatures whereas the upper part showed \u201cup-regulation\u201d of signatures enriched for inflammatory, immune and IFN response.(B) ROI selection for GeoMx data: Representative image of infected ALI culture section with SARS-CoV-2 (105 PFU), at 6DPI stained for nuclei (DAPI), viral nucleoprotein (red), spike viral protein (yellow) and cytokeratin 5 (CK5).

Organoid Units Preparation\nInstruments appropriate for mouse dissection (scissors and forceps) should be sterilized by autoclave.    \nHumanely euthanize the donor mouse according to local IACUC protocols. Ensure that the animal is dead before proceeding. \nMake a midline incision to gain access to the peritoneal cavity. Skin flaps can be reflected as needed to improve exposure.\nEviscerate the small bowel and divide it just distal to the ligament of Treitz. Separate the small bowel from its mesentery using sharp and gentle blunt dissection. Identify the ileocecal junction and divide the small bowel 5 mm proximal to this. \nUsing scissors, open the intestine lengthwise along the antimesenteric border in a Petri dish with 10 ml 4 \u00b0C, sterile Hanks' buffered saline (HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) / 1X antibiotic-antifungal (Anti-Anti, Invitrogen) solution.

Each wash can be performed with mild shaking of the 15 ml tube for 30 sec.  After shaking, the intestinal tissue sinks to the bottom of the tube. Discard floating material, which is mesenchymal debris. Remove the washing solution carefully with a pipet.\nMince the washed intestine in a Petri dish with 10 ml of 4 \u00b0C, sterile HBSS / 1X anti-anti to less than 1 mm square pieces using a scissors. Gather the minced material up with an automatic pipet and place it into a test tube.    \nCentrifuge the tube at 500 rpm for 8 min. Discard the supernatant, which contains fat and mesenchyme.Digest the minced, washed material with 10 ml of sterile HBSS / 1X anti-anti plus 0.125 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen) and 800 units/ml collagenase type 1 (Worthington, Lakewood NJ). To prepare 40 ml of the digestion solution, weigh out 5 mg of dispase, 142 mg of collagenase, and add sterile HBSS up to a volume of 40 ml. Prepare this solution freshly each time organoid units are prepared, and keep at 4\u00b0 C until ready to use. Add the digestion solution directly to the pellet from step 1.8.    \nIncubate the test tube containing the minced, washed material with the digestion solution at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min.\nRetrieve the test tube and further disrupt the digested tissue by trituration with a 10 ml pipet.

Load the organoid units onto the scaffold with the 1,000 microliter pipet, first into the lumen and then onto the outer surface. Use a forceps to ensure coating of the lumen. Do not disrupt or break open the cylindrical shape of the polymer. \n3. Implantation into Host Mouse\nUse a syngeneic host mouse on the same background as the donor if available. Otherwise, employ an immunocompromised nonobese diabetic / severe combined immunodeficient or NOD / SCID animal (Jackson Laboratories, Sacramento CA).\nInduce general anesthesia with isoflurane. Shave, prep and drape the mouse's abdomen.    \nMake a 5 mm midline incision to gain entrance to the peritoneal cavity. Identify and carefully eviscerate the greater omentum. Place the loaded polymer onto the omentum and wrap it with the tissue. Do not tear the omentum.\nSecure the polymer to the omentum with a 5-0 monocryl suture. Gently replace the omentum with the wrapped polymer into its anatomic position.\nClose the abdominal incision in layers using 4-0 vicryl sutures. Run the muscle closure and take care not to injure the abdominal viscera below the incision. Use interrupted sutures for the skin.\nAdminister postoperative analgesia with 2 mg/kg ketoprofen (Ketofen, Fort Dodge Animal Health) in sterile water as a subcutaneous wheal adjacent to the incision.  Animals should be evaluated daily and if the animal is demonstrating signs of pain or distress, an additional dose of ketoprofen may be administered on post operative day 2.  By the third postoperative day, the animal should be fully recovered without evidence of pain or distress.  If pain or distress continues on post operative day 3, this is considered abnormal and should be addressed in accordance with the IACUC and animal care facility protocols.Allow the mouse to recuperate and the tissue-engineered intestine to grow for four weeks. Give the animal ad libitum access to rodent chow (Lab Diet 5001, PMI Nutrition, St. Louis MO) and water with Septra 200 mg / 40 mg per 5 ml (Hi-Tech Pharmacal, Amityville NY) at 1:100 dilution. \n4. Harvest\nHumanely euthanize the host animal four weeks after implantation.\nReopen the original incision and reflect the skin cephalad to facilitate access to the peritoneal cavity.\nOpen the muscle layer and identify the tissue-engineered construct as a globe of tissue.\nTake down adhesions to the construct from intraabdominal viscera using sharp dissection.\nFix the construct in formalin for later paraffin mounting, or use the tissue fresh for biochemical assays such as real-time PCR or protein isolation.    \nSubscription Required.

Use minimal medium M9 (48 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 19 mM NH4Cl, 9 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1 mM CaCl2) supplemented with 0.04% glucose (wt/vol) and 0.2%(wt/vol) casamino acids) for P. aeruginosa flow cell biofilms.\nAliquot fluorescent microspheres into microcentrifuge tubes and spin down in sterile H2O for 5 min in centrifuge at 9,391.2 g. Remove supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml growth medium to remove sodium azide (disinfectant) prior to adding to growth medium in 2 L or 5 L medium bottles.\n\t\tNOTE: Different sizes of microspheres come in different concentrations and should be diluted accordingly to instructions. For example, disperse 120 \u00b5l of 1.0 \u00b5m diameter microspheres, 15 \u00b5l of 0.5 \u00b5m diameter microspheres and 0.96 \u00b5l of 0.2 \u00b5m diameter microspheres into 2 L of growth medium to give 2.18 \u00d7 106 microspheres ml-1 for each particle size.Attach medium bottle to upstream of flow cell and allow growth medium to flow through entire setup. Stop flow and inject diluted overnight cultures into flow cell chambers. Allow bacteria to attach to the coverslip substratum for 1 hr before continuing flow of growth medium at a flow rate of approximately 5.5 x 10-3 m sec-1,or 8 rpm with a peristaltic pump.\n\t\tNOTE: Biofilms are usually grown at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) for 3-7 days.\nAlternatively, for static culture setup, dilute overnight cultures 100 fold in microcentrifuge tubes by adding 10 \u00b5l of overnight culture to 1 ml growth medium with particles. Increase the particle concentration in the growth medium for static culture by approximately 500-fold compared to that used for flow biofilms (e.g. wash and resuspend 600 \u00b5l of 1.0 \u00b5m diameter spheres in 10 ml of growth medium) as flow cell biofilms are constantly replenished with particles but static cultures are not.\n\t\t\nAdd 200 \u00b5l of diluted overnight culture with particles to the chambers of 8 well slides. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C under static conditions. Biofilms are usually grown for 1 day. Replace spent growth medium daily with fresh growth medium with particles if biofilm is grown for more than 1 day.\n2. Microscopy\nOn day 3 and 5, switch off flow from peristaltic pump and bring flow cell setup into the microscopy room. Clamp tubing near the entrance and exit of the flow cell chambers to prevent drift (a systematic error cause by changes in the environment) from flow. Place the flow cell onto the microscope stage of an upright microscope.\n\tNOTE: Use an inverted microscope for imaging of microwells.Use fluorescent microscopy with 40X oil objective to take videos of microsphere motion embedded in the biofilm at various locations (microcolonies and flat undifferentiated layers) and in different days (day 3 and 5) for temporal and spatial investigations. Take shorter videos with higher frame rate to investigate events occurring within short time scales (e.g. 1.5-3 min videos at frame rate of 25-50 frames per second for fast dynamics), and longer videos with lower frame rate to investigate events over longer time scales (e.g. 15-30 min videos at frame rate of 2.5-5 frames/sec for slower dynamics).\n\tNOTE: A video typically contains 5-10 particles, and is typically of 1.0-2.5 GB in file size. Larger microcolonies may hold more particles. Take 5-10 videos for each category (e.g. 5-10 videos of different microcolonies and of different locations in flat undifferentiated layers). The biofilm has a heterogeneous architecture that may consist of microcolonies, channels, voids and flat undifferentiated layers.\nSave videos in appropriate format that can be read by Fiji/ImageJ (e.g. czi, tif).\nCheck videos for drift by scrolling through finished video and observing that the particles do not move in the same direction simultaneously. Drift can be caused by z-stage motion, currents in the flow cell, imbalance of anti-vibration table, air pressure or temperature changes. Correct minor drifting using post-processing techniques usually provided with microscope software. Discard any videos wherein drift cannot be corrected. Record the following parameters, which are required during Particle Tracking Analysis: Resolution (px/um), Number of Frames, Duration.\nRemove flow cell from microscope stage and restart peristaltic pump to continue cultivating the biofilm.\n3. Particle Tracking Analysis\nObtain particle trajectories by using the plug-in TrackMate in open source software (ImageJ). Download Fiji at\u00a0 http://fiji.sc/Fiji[href=http://fiji.sc/Fiji]. Open the video with Fiji and under the Plugins menu, select Tracking and TrackMate.Check or adjust settings in the window suggesting initial calibration settings to match the video parameters as recorded in step 2.4.\nDetect particles in TrackMate using ImageJ.\n\t\nSelect 'LoG detector', input particle diameter and threshold value (e.g. 1,000). Scroll through the video whilst clicking on 'Preview' button to check that the purple circles follow the particles throughout the video. Adjust the diameter and threshold values as necessary: increase the threshold value if purple circles appear in the empty space. Reduce the threshold value if not enough particles are detected. Click the next button to complete detection the particles.\nClick the next button when presented with the option to add or remove particles detected in 'Initial thresholding', 'Select a view' and 'Select a filter' windows to continue without adjustment if initial particle detection was satisfactory.\nSelect 'Simple LAP tracker' in the option bar of 'Select a tracker method' window as particles rarely move out of focus in the biofilm and are easily tracked. Use the suggested or low linking and gap-closing max distance values, and click next.\nCheck that particle tracking is satisfactory by scrolling through the video to see that particles follow the tracks drawn by TrackMate, and that there are no unwanted or missing tracks. Skip the various filtering steps. Go to the final window 'Select an action'. Select 'Export tracks to xml file' from the drop down menu and click 'Execute'. Choose a folder to save the tracks.\n\t\tNOTE: There are various programs available in the public domain for the analysis of particle trajectories and use of microrheology. msdanalyzer and TrackArt are examples of particle tracking analysis programs that run in the Matlab environment.Prepare Matlab to import the particle trajectories in the xml files by selecting in the menu of Matlab File>Set Path... and add the scripts folder available with the Fiji package.\nTo analyze the particle trajectories with msdanalyzer, download the link to the zip file or the tar.gz file at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40692-mean-square-displacement-analysis-of-particles-trajectories[href=http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40692-mean-square-displacement-analysis-of-particles-trajectories].\n\t\nExtract the @msdanalyzer folder15 and drop it in a folder that belongs to the Matlab path (e.g. C:\\Documents and Settings\\<Username>\\My Documents\\Matlab).

Part 1: Culture of hNPCs in PuraMatrix\nIn advance to the generation of a scaffold with a PuraMatrix concentration of 0.25% without laminin one needs to prepare the following solutions\nPrepare a solution containing 20% sucrose and a solution containing 10% sucrose dissolved in sterile distilled water.\nFor solution 1 mix 120 \u03bcl of the 20% sucrose solution with 120 \u03bcl of distilled water in a 1.5 ml conical tube.\nFor solution 2 mix 60 \u03bcl of the PuraMatrix solution with 60 \u03bcl of 20% sucrose solution in a 1.5 ml conical tube.\nFor a Preparation of a scaffold with a PuraMatrix concentration of 0.25% supplemented with laminin (8 \u03bcg per 100 \u03bcl Matrix) one needs to prepare the following solutions.\nFor solution 1 mix 72 \u03bcl of distilled water with 120 \u03bcl of 20% sucrose solution and 48 \u03bcl laminin in a 1.5 ml conical tube.\nFor solution 2 mix 60 \u03bcl PuraMatrix solution with 60 \u03bcl of the 20% sucrose solution in a 1.5 ml conical tube.\nFor the embedment of cells in the PuraMatrix prepare a 4-well cell culture plate and place a sterilised glass cover slip (diameter 13 mm) in two wells. Store the plate in the clean bench for the later use. Glass cover slips are only used for the immunocytochemical studies. If no immunocytochemical stainings are intended, the step can be skipped.\nTo prepare the hNPCs for encapsulation in 3D scaffolds one has to prepare the following solutions. Dilute the Benzonase in the Trypsin/EDTA solution, using a dilution factor of 1:10.000. For a Trypsin-Inhibitor/Benzonase solution mix: DMEM/F12 + Benzonase 25U/\u03bcl + 1% HSA + Trypsin-inhibitor (0.5mg/ml).Detach the cells by adding 500 \u03bcl Trypsin/Benzonase solution and incubate for 5 min in an incubator (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2). Stop the reaction with Trypsin-Inhibitor/Benzonase solution. Subsequently centrifuge the detached cells for 5 min at 3000 x g. Wash cells with 5 ml 10% Sucrose solution and centrifuge again. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 10% sucrose solution, the final cell solution should contain 1x106 cells/ml.\nThe next steps, 1.8 to 1.11, should be done as fast as possible, because of the low pH of the PuraMatrix solution, which might be harmful for the cells.\nMix 60 \u03bcl of cell suspension with solution 1.\nAdd 120 \u03bcl of solution 1, containing the cells, to the conical tube with solution 2 and mix carefully.\nPlace 100 \u03bcl of the mixture immediately on each cover slips resided in the 4-well plate.\nAdd slowly 200 \u03bcl cell culture medium per well and after 2-3 minutes another 200 \u03bcl. This will initiate the self-assembly of the matrix.\nIncubate cells at 37 \u00b0C, for 1h in the clean bench on a heating plate or the heated area of your clean bench. As far as possible do not move the plate as this might harm the assembling of the matrices.\nRemove most of the medium but not all, to avoid the matrices falling dry, with a 1000 \u03bcl pipette. Add 500 \u03bcl of medium to wash matrices for 10 min. Finally remove the medium and add 500 \u03bcl fresh medium and place the culture plate in an incubator (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2). As the matrices are sensitive to shock the plates should be moved as less as possible and stored, if possible, in a separate incubator.The here used hNPCs were proliferated for 7 days in the 3D-scaffolds and differentiation was initiated by withdrawal of the growth factors 13. Medium was changed every 2-3 days.\n2. Part 2: Immunocytochemical staining of entire matrices\nIn advance to the staining procedure one needs to prepare: a blocking buffer solution consisting of 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% of Triton X-100 dissolved in PBS, a 4% paraformaldehyde solution based on 0.1 M PBS and if needed a solution with 4',6-Diamidin-2'-phenylindoldihydrochlorid (DAPI) for a nuclei staining containing 100 ng DAPI/ml dissolved in PBS. Samples were mounted with a mixture of Mowiol and DABCO.\nTo wash the matrices remove the medium with a 1000 \u03bcl pipette and wash the scaffolds with PBS once for 5 minutes.\nTo fix the scaffolds remove the PBS and add 400 \u03bcl of paraformaldehyde (4% in 0.1 M PBS) to each well and incubate the matrices for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixed Scaffolds can be stored in PBS supplemented with 0.02% NaN3 at 4\u00b0C for several weeks up to several months.\nIn advance of a staining wash the scaffolds with PBS for 5 minutes.\nIncubate the scaffolds in blocking buffer solution. Blocking solution was changed three times every 2-3 hours and subsequently scaffolds were incubated in blocking solution over night at 4\u00b0C.\nRemove the blocking buffer solution and add the primary antibody dissolved in PBS supplemented with 1% normal goat serum and incubate the matrices over night at 4\u00b0C.\nRemove the primary antibody solution and wash scaffolds 4 times for 2 h and subsequently over night at 4\u00b0C with PBS.\nRemove the PBS and add the solution with the secondary antibody, dissolved in PBS supplemented with 1% normal goat serum, for 4 h at room temperature in the dark.Wash the samples with PBS 4-6 times for 1 h and subsequently over night at 4\u00b0C in the dark.\nFor a nuclei staining one can add 400 \u03bcl of the DAPI solution for 30 min.\nTo mount the samples one needs microscope slides. Add 50 \u03bcl Mowiol/Dabco on the microscope slides. Remove the cover slips from the 4-well plate and put them carefully on the mounting medium.\nHere we used a Biozero 8000 microscope (Keyence, Germany, Karlsruhe) to obtain single micrographs and z-stacks. Each stack contains 30 single pictures with a distance of 1-2 \u03bcm. Using the corresponding analyser software the blur inherent to fluorescence was removed before full projections of the z-stacks were produced.\n3. Part 3: Release of hNPCs from the scaffolds for flow cytometry analysis\nIn advance to the release of the cells from scaffolds wash the scaffolds with 500 \u03bcl HBSS.\nTransfer the scaffolds by means of a 1000 \u03bcl pipette to a 15 ml conical tube containing cell culture medium.\nTo disrupt the scaffolds mechanically resuspend the cell solution several times with a 1000 \u03bcl pipette and subsequently centrifuge the solution at 3000 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant with a pipette, add 500 \u03bcl of Trypsin/Benzonase solution and resuspend the cell pellet several times.\nIncubate the cells for 5 min at 37\u00b0C in the Trypsin/Benzonase solution. To stop the reaction add 1 ml Trypsin-inhibitor/Benzonase solution and pipette up and down several times.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension 5 min at 3000 x g, remove the supernatant and wash the cells with 2 ml HBSS buffer. Repeat this step two times. This procedure will remove matrix debris.Pass the cell suspension solution trough a cell strainer (pore size 70 \u03bcm) to remove aggregates and collect the cells in cell culture medium. The obtained cells can be seeded again e.g. on cover slips for functional studies as patch clamp or fluometric measurements. To process the cells for flow cytometry, fix the cells immediately (see 4.1).\n4. Part 4: Quantification of \u03b2III-tubulin positive cells by flow cytometry\nFix the released cells obtained in step 3.7 with 1% PFA for 15 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 3000 x g and remove the supernatant. If needed, the cells can be prepared to be stored at 4\u00b0C for later analysis. Therefore resuspend cells in wash buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% Na-azide).\nTo proceed with the preparation for the flow cytometry, centrifuge the cell suspension for 10 min at 350 x g, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 25 \u03bcl of the antibody solution. Therefore the first antibody is mixed with saponin buffer at a concentration 1:100 e.g. \u03b2III-tubulin. The saponin buffer consists of PBS with a saponin concentration of 0.5%, a BSA concentration of 0.5% and a Na-azide concentration of 0.02%.\nIncubate the cell suspension with the first antibody for 2 h at room temperature on a shaker. As a negative control prepare a sample without the first antibody.\nFor the first washing step add 300 \u03bcl saponin buffer directly to the cells. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 350 x g. For the second washing step, discard the supernatant, add 300 \u03bcl buffer and centrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 350 x g.Remove the supernatant and add 25 \u03bcl solution containing the secondary antibody (e.g. Alexa Fluor 647, 1:1000, dissolved in saponin buffer). Incubate cells with the secondary antibody 1h at room temperature, in the dark.\nFor the first washing step add 300 \u03bcl saponin buffer directly to the cells. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 350 x g. For the second washing step, discard the supernatant, add 300 \u03bcl buffer and centrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 350 x g.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 500 \u03bcl wash buffer for the flow cytometry analysis.\n5. Representative ResultsAn example of hNPCs cultured in the self-assembling hydrogel scaffold PuraMatrix is shown in figure 1. The hNPCs grow in spheric like structures in unmodified PM. In this culture conditions, cells can hardly be recognised in a transmission light, although bundles of processes between the spheres are visible (fig 1A). Depending on the culture conditions of the used cell type, the matrix can be modified e.g. by adding laminin. For the hNPC cell line ReNcell VM (Millipore) laminin is necessary to induce a growth pattern with less dense aggregates but a more homogeneous distribution of the cells (fig 1B). Independent of modifications, the matrix can be used to study e.g. neuronal differentiation. Figure 1C presents a staining of the hNPCs for the neuronal marker \u03b2III-tubulin. In this example the cells were grown for 7 days in the matrix and subsequently differentiated for 4 days, where differentiation was induced by withdrawal of the growth factors EGF and bFGF.13 Cell bodies and a dense network of processes built up by the cells can be recognised easily. However, it is obvious that a quantification of the cell number is time consuming, as a large number of pictures of different regions of the matrix has to be analysed, to obtain a reliable data base for a statistical analysis. In fig 1D one can see an example of cells released from the matrix and subsequently platted on cover slips. These cells might be used for functional studies.The release of the cells from the 3D-scaffolds offers the possibility to analyse different parameters like expression of marker proteins or survival rate of the cells by AnnexinV/PI staining or a TUNEL assay. Figure 2 shows an example of a flow cytometry analysis of the percentage of \u03b2III-tubulin+ cells. The negative control (cells not marked for \u03b2III-tubulin) is shown in figure 2A. These controls are used to determine the gate for the later detection of \u03b2III-tubulin+ cells (fig 2B). A comparison of a manual counting of cells and an analysis by flow cytometry is shown in figure 2C. The percentage of \u03b2III-tubulin+ cells was determined by counting the total cell number (by means of a nuclear DAPI staining) and the number of \u03b2III-tubulin+ cells in the fluorescence pictures.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3830/3830fig1.jpgFigure 1. hNPCs cultured in the self-assembling peptide hydrogel PuraMatrix.  A) hNPCs encapsulated in PuraMatrix (PM) grow in spheric, dense packed structures, where the diameter of the spheres can be up to several hundred \u03bcm. In between the spheres one can recognise bundles of processes built up by the cells (arrows). B) Cells encapsulated in PuraMatrix supplemented with laminin (PML) grow in less dense structures, more homogenously distributed. In the laminin supplemented matrix one can recognise single cells in less dense areas (arrows), however it is hardly possible to quantify the number of cells. C) hNPCs differentiated for 4 days in PML express neuronal marker like \u03b2III-tubulin (green). To evaluate the percentage of positive cells one has to determine the total cell number by a nuclei staining like DAPI (blue). The microphotograph presents the full projection of a z-stack of pictures taken with Biozero-8000 microscope. D) Cells released from the matrix can be seeded on e.g. cover slips for further functional studies. The microphotograph shows cells cultured for 3d, subsequently to the release procedure. The staining for \u03b2III-tubulin (red) reveals a comparable morphology to the cells hosted in the 3D scaffold.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3830/3830fig2.jpgFigure 2. Flow cytometry analysis cells released from PuraMatrix.  To overcome the time consuming quantification of microphotographs we used a protocol to release cells cultured in PuraMatrix giving access to faster analysis by flow cytometry. A) Unstained cells were used as negative control, to set the gate (black frame) for the subsequently analysis of e.g. \u03b2III-tubulin cells. B) To quantify the percentage of \u03b2III-tubulin+ cells the same gate, set in the negative control, was used. Positive cells appear in the right part of the x-axis, where also an intermediate population was observed (dotted frame), most likely representing cell debris. C) The comparison of manual counted cells and cells counted by flow cytometry revealed a much higher proportion of positive cells, where the time dependency of the number of \u03b2III-tubulin+ was comparable, indicating the reliability of the flow cytometry protocol.Subscription Required.

Informed consent is obtained for the tissue to be used for research purposes, and the tissue used anonymously under the appropriate ethical approvals (SSREC 165/03, Human Research Tissue Bank Licence 12179).\n1. Isolation of Human Esophageal Epithelial Cells\nWorking in a laminar flow tissue culture hood and using sterile technique, prepare the epithelial culture medium by mixing Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and Ham\u2019s F12 in a 3:1 ratio (v:v). Add 10% (v/v) FCS, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.4 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone, 1.8 x 10-4 M adenine, 5 \u00b5g/ml insulin, 5 \u00b5g/ml transferrin, 2 x 10-7 M triiodothyronine, 1 x 10-10 M cholera toxin, 2 x 10-3 M glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 0.625 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B.\nUsing standard sterile techniques, put 11 ml of DMEM, 10% FCS, 2 x 10-3 M L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 0.625 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B into a T75 tissue culture flask. Add 1 x 106 lethally irradiated mouse 3T3 fibroblasts12 in 1 ml of the same medium and incubate overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. This will produce a feeder layer for the subsequent culture of epithelial cells.\nUsing a scalpel and following the recommendations of a histopathologist, dissect an approximately 2 cm2 sample of tissue from the disease-free background region of esophageal squamous mucosa obtained from patients undergoing gastric or esophageal surgery. Transport to the laboratory in a 50 ml container of sterile transport medium (PBS 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 0.625 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B) at room temperature.At this point, store the tissue in the transport medium for up to 12 hr (overnight) at 4 \u00b0C, for convenience; however do not use longer storage periods as they result in reduced cell viability.\nWorking in a laminar flow tissue culture hood and using sterile technique, sterilize a scalpel blade by soaking in 70% ethanol for 5 min. Rinse in sterile PBS.\nPlace the tissue in a sterile Petri dish and use the scalpel to cut it into 0.5 cm strips. Add 5 ml of 0.1% (w/v) trypsin in PBS to the Petri dish, place the lid on the dish and incubate for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C.\nAdd 5 ml of FCS to the tissue in the Petri dish to inhibit the trypsin. Holding the strip of tissue with sterile forceps, gently scrape the epithelial surface with the scalpel blade for 1-2 min per strip to remove the epithelial cells into the surrounding medium. Remove the scraped tissue and set aside. Repeat the process for all the tissue strips.\nCollect the medium containing the detached epithelial cells into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge (5 min, 200 x g). Pour off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 12 ml of epithelial medium (described in step 1.1).\nPour off and discard the medium from the feeder cell layer in the T75 flask prepared in step 1.2. Use a sterile pipette to add the cell suspension containing the freshly isolated epithelial cells to the flask and incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere.After 24 hr pour off and discard the culture medium, which will also contain cell debris, and replace with 12 ml of fresh epithelial medium. Continue incubating at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. Colonies will start to appear over the next 24 to 48 hr and can be viewed by placing the culture flask under a standard light microscope. Pour off the spent culture medium and replace with an equal volume of fresh medium every 2 to 3 days.\nOnce the flask has reached 80% confluency, passage the cells13. Split the cells in a ratio of 1:5 to increase cell numbers for use in the model. Follow step 1.2 to establish feeder layers of irradiated 3T3 cells in each flask that will be receiving epithelial cells 24 hr prior to passaging the cells.\n\tNote: Use the epithelial cells in the esophageal model described below between passages 1 and 4 only.\n2. Isolation of Human Esophageal Fibroblasts\nWorking in a laminar flow cabinet and using sterile technique, take the tissue set aside in step 1.7. Place in a sterile Petri dish and mince finely by chopping with a sterile scalpel blade. Add 10 ml of 0.5% (w/v) collagenase A solution and place the lid on the Petri dish and incubate at 37 \u00b0C overnight in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere.\nTransfer the digest to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge (10 min, 200 x g), carefully pour off and discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of fibroblast culture medium (DMEM 10% FCS, 2 x 10-3 M L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 0.625 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B).Place the suspension into a T75 flask and incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. After 24 hr pour off the medium, which will contain debris and replace with 12 ml of fresh fibroblast medium. Replace the culture medium every 2 to 3 days and passage cells once they have reached 80% confluency13, splitting the cells in a 1:5 ratio to increase cell numbers.\n\tNote: Use the fibroblast cells in the model described below between passages 4 and 10 only.\n3. Preparation of the De-cellularized Esophageal Scaffold\nObtain intact porcine esophagi at an abattoir from freshly slaughtered Landrace pigs that are used for food production. One single esophagus will provide sufficient scaffolds for approximately 30 separate constructs.\n\tNote: Due to the extensive and time consuming sterilization protocol required, it is normally worth obtaining and processing a minimum of 10 esophagi at one time.\nImmediately place the freshly excised esophagus into a 180 ml sterile pot containing approximately 150 ml of 10% povidone-iodine solution for 5 min to reduce any contaminating microbial load. Transfer the esophagus to a second pot containing approximately 100 ml of sterile PBS containing 200 IU/ml penicillin, 200 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 1.25 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B.\n\t\nReplace the lid on the container and transport the esophagi back to the laboratory at room temperature. Two or three esophagi can be transported in each container, depending upon their size.\nOnce at the laboratory, handle the tissue in a laminar flow hood using aseptic technique to minimize microbial contamination. Sterilize tweezers, scissors and scalpel blades by soaking for 5 min in 70% ethanol, and rinsing in sterile PBS.Handle the esophagus using sterile tweezers. Using the scissors, cut open the esophagus longitudinally. Rinse the tissue by placing the esophagus into a 180 ml sterile pot containing approximately 100 ml of sterile PBS and shaking gently to remove any debris.\nClean a cork dissection board by spraying liberally with 70% ethanol and allow to dry.\nRemove the esophagus from the PBS, and using sterile needles, pin out the esophagus onto the board, mucosal surface uppermost. Grasp the mucosal surface at one end of the esophagus with sterile tweezers and pull away from the board. This will separate the mucosa from the underlying submucosa.\n\t\nThen, use a sterile scalpel blade to dissect the esophagus longitudinally along the lamina propria, removing pins as the dissection progresses to allow the mucosa to be lifted away.\nRetain the dissected mucosa and discard the underlying submucosa.\nCut off and discard the most proximal and distal 2 cm of the mucosa as there is a greater number of submucosal glands and a thicker lamina propria in those areas, respectively7.\nUse a scalpel to cut the remaining tissue into 5 cm2. Place all the cut tissue into a 180 ml sterile pot containing approximately 150 ml of sterile PBS and agitate gently to rinse the tissue. If processing more than five esophagi at one time it may be necessary to use multiple pots for this and the three subsequent steps.\nUsing sterile tweezers, transfer the cut tissue into a 180 ml pot containing 150 ml of sterile 1 M NaCl, 200 IU/ml penicillin, 200 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 1.25 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B. Incubate for 72 hr at 37 \u00b0C.Place the tissue into a fresh 180 ml pot containing 150 ml sterile PBS. The epithelium will have begun to visibly separate from the underlying tissue. Gently peel the detaching epithelium from the pig esophagus using sterile forceps and discard.\n\t\nPlace the remaining tissue into a fresh 180 ml pot and add 150 ml of sterile PBS. Agitate gently for 5 min to wash. Pour off the PBS and repeat a further two times with fresh PBS.\nPlace all the tissue into a 500 ml glass bottle containing 400 ml of sterile 80% (v/v) glycerol solution for 24 hr at room temperature. Transfer to 400 ml of sterile 90% (v/v) glycerol solution for a further 24 hr.\nStore in 400 ml of sterile 100% glycerol solution at room temperature for a minimum of 4 months to dehydrate and sterilize the tissue while preserving the integrity of the basement membrane.\n4. Production of the Culture Media\nPrepare chelated newborn calf serum for use in the culture medium.\n\t\nPour 100 g of Chelex 100 into a glass 1 L bottle and add de-ionized water. The exact volume is not critical but sufficient water must be added to cover the Chelex powder. Add a magnetic stirrer and sterilize by autoclaving (121 \u00b0C for 15 min).\nAllow the bottle to cool and the Chelex to settle. In a laminar flow cabinet pour off the excess water, add 500 ml of newborn calf serum (NCS) and leave to stir overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\nStop stirring and allow the Chelex to settle, this can take up to 30 min. In a laminar flow cabinet decant the chelated serum using a sterile pipette, taking care not to disturb the Chelex, and store in 10 ml aliquots at -20 \u00b0C.Prepare three different media in a laminar flow cabinet, commencing with pro-proliferative and ending with pro-differentiative formulations.\n\t\nPrepare Composite Medium I comprised of DMEM and Hams F12 in a 3:1 ratio (v:v), 4 x 10-3 M L-glutamine, 0.5 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone, 1 x 10-4 M O-phosphorylethanolamine, 2 x 10-12 M triiodothyronine, 1.8 x 10-4 M adenine, 1.88 x 10-3 M CaCl2, 4 x 10-12 M progesterone, 10 \u00b5g/ml insulin, 10 \u00b5g/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml selenium, 1 x 10-3 M ethanolamine and 0.1% (v/v) chelated NCS.\nPrepare Composite Medium II as Composite Medium I except replace chelated serum with 0.1% (v/v) non-chelated NCS.\nPrepare Composite Medium III as Composite Medium II except omit progesterone and increase serum to 2% (v/v) non-chelated NCS.\n5. Production of the Human Esophageal Mucosa Model\nPerform all work in a laminar flow hood, using aseptic technique to maintain a sterile environment. Sterilize all tools by soaking in 70% ethanol for 5 min, before rinsing in sterile PBS.\nThe day before it is required, rehydrate the acellular porcine esophageal scaffold. One piece of scaffold is required for each construct to be prepared.\n\t\nTo rehydrate the tissue place sufficient pieces of porcine scaffold into a pot containing 100 ml of sterile PBS, agitate and soak for 10 min. Decant the PBS and replace with fresh PBS. Repeat the washing process five times to ensure removal of all glycerol traces.\nTest the scaffold sterility by incubating the rehydrated tissue overnight in 100 ml of DMEM at 37 \u00b0C. If there is no change to the color or turbidity of the culture medium at the end of the incubation period the scaffold is assumed to be sterile. Once sterility has been confirmed, place the 5 cm2 acellular scaffold into a 6 well plate, submucosal side uppermost.Place a sterile medical grade stainless steel ring (internal diameter 10 mm, external diameter 20 mm) onto the center of each scaffold and gently press down using sterile forceps, to ensure an adequate seal with the tissue.\nHarvest the fibroblasts using Trypsin-EDTA13 to produce a cell suspension. Count the cells using a haemocytometer14. Centrifuge the cell suspension (10 min, 200 x g). Resuspend the cell pellet into an appropriate volume of fibroblast medium to produce a final cell count of 2.5 x 106 cells per ml.\nAdd 0.2 ml of fibroblast medium, containing 5 x 105 human esophageal fibroblasts, within each ring. Flood the area around the outside of the ring with approximately 2 ml of fibroblast medium. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere.\nAfter 24 hr remove the rings and fibroblast medium and add at least 5 ml of fresh fibroblast medium to each well, ensuring that the scaffold is totally immersed in medium. Culture for 1 week, at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere replacing the medium every 2 to 3 days.\nAfter 1 week remove the 6 well plates containing the scaffolds to a laminar flood hood, remove the medium and invert each scaffold using sterile forceps, placing the mucosal surface uppermost. This time point is referred to as Day 0.\nPlace the steel rings on the mucosal surface in the center of the tissue as in step 5.4.\nPrepare the T75 flasks of epithelial cells for trypsinization13. After the PBS wash and prior to the addition of trypsin-EDTA solution, add 2 ml of sterile 0.02% (w/v) EDTA solution to each flask. Incubate for 2 min at 37 \u00b0C. Tap the flask gently to selectively detach the i3T3 feeder layer while leaving the epithelial cells attached.Note: It is generally not practical or necessary to patient match the epithelial cells to the fibroblasts already incorporated in the model the previous week.\nPour off the EDTA solution containing the feeder layer and add trypsin-EDTA solution to harvest the epithelial cells13. Count the cells using a haemocytometer14. Centrifuge the cell suspension (10 min, 200 x g). Resuspend the cell pellet into an appropriate volume of Composite Medium 1 to produce a final cell count of 5 x 106 cells per ml.\nAdd 0.2 ml of Composite Medium I, containing 1 x 106 epithelial cells, within the ring. Flood the area around the outside of the ring with approximately 2 ml of Composite Medium I and place the constructs into the incubator at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere.\nAfter 24 hr (Day 1) remove the rings and medium and add at least 5 ml of fresh Composite Medium I, ensuring the scaffolds are fully submerged and return to the incubator. After a further 24 hr (Day 2) remove the medium and replaced with at least 5 ml of Composite Medium II, again ensuring the scaffolds are fully submerged and return to the incubator.\nOn Day 4 place sterile medical grade stainless steel mesh grids (2 cm wide x 2 cm long x 0.5 cm high), into fresh 6 well plates, one per construct. Use sterile tweezers to transfer the constructs onto the top of the steel grids, mucosal surface uppermost.Add sufficient Composite Medium III so that the liquid reaches the underside of the composite, but the surface is exposed to the air, this ensures that the sample is maintained at an air-liquid interface. The exact volume of medium required will vary depending upon the thickness of the scaffold, the volume of the well and the precise height of the stainless steel grid.\nMaintain the composites at an air-liquid interface for between 10 and 20 days (Day 14 to Day 24), depending upon the requirements of the experiment. Replace the Composite Medium III with fresh medium every 2 to 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday is a user-friendly regime).\n\tNote: After 5 days at an air-liquid interface (Day 9) the constructs have a sufficiently mature esophageal epithelium to be used in experiments of the impact of environmental factors on the esophageal epithelium.\nAt the end of the experiment, fix the constructs for histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining7, or extract protein15 or RNA11,16 from the epithelium for further analysis. If required, retain the conditioned culture medium for analysis of extracellular signaling molecules17.\nSubscription Required.

Computational analysis becomes difficult if cells form clusters on the coverslip.\nResuspend trypsinized cells in culture medium and remove trypsin by gentle centrifugation and subsequent aspiration of medium.\nResuspend cell pellet in an appropriate volume of culture medium, or at a desired cell concentration.\nPrepare coverslips.\nBy using appropriate forceps, put sterile coverslips at the bottom of the well(s).\nCritical: We recommend using round 10mm coverslips for 24-multiwell plates or 13mm for 12-multiwell plates, which will minimize any issue (i.e.: breakage, overlay) during their handling. Coverslips must be clean; if they are not, clean them with 1% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), followed by extensive washes with deionized water. Moreover, coverslips must be sterile; if they are not, sterilize them at 200\u00b0C for 2h in a heater.\nWash the coverslips 1 time with 1\u00d7 PBS. Make sure they adhere to the bottom of the well(s) by gently pushing them with sterile forceps after cell seeding.\nCritical: This step is crucial to ensure cells do not grow below the coverslips.\nPlate cells on coverslips.\nSeed cells to have about 50% confluency.Critical: Do not seed too many cells, if characterized by a high growing rate, as the over-confluency will hamper the consequent computational analysis.\nOn the same line, spread cells properly by extensively moving the multi-well (or whichever type of plastic support you are using) in multiple directions, to avoid the formation of cell clusters.\nCoverslips can be coated with specific adhesion agents depending on the cell type used.\nUsing a sterile tip, push gently the coverslips to the bottom of the well since you want cells to adhere on top of the coverslip.\nPut cells in the humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 16\u00a0h before proceeding.\nStep 2: Treat cells with amino acid analogs\nTiming: \u223c3 h\nAmino acid analogs are methyl ester group-bearing amino acids, which cause the rapid, osmosis-driven, expansion of lysosomes. We tested three types of such compounds on cells (individually): L-Leucine methyl ester hydrochloride, L-Alanine methyl ester hydrochloride, L-Histidine methyl ester hydrochloride. L-Leucine methyl ester hydrochloride caused the strongest effect in our cell models.\nTreat cells with amino acid analog.\nDilute amino acid analog stock solution in culture medium at the desired concentration.\nNote: The expansion effect is dose and time-dependent. Use a working concentration between 1mM (mild expansion) and 10mM (maximum expansion) up to at least 2h of incubation to reach the maximum effect. Moreover, if you are using phenol red-containing medium, you will notice a change in color towards yellow. Indeed, amino acid analogs are slightly acidic compounds.\nTake cells from point 6d and gently remove culture medium.\nAdd culture medium supplemented with amino acid analogs and put back cells in the incubator for 2\u00a0h.\nNote: After having removed culture medium (7b) add the one containing amino acids analogs (7c) without introducing any further cell starvation step.\nCell fixationTiming: \u223c30\u00a0min\nFixation is the most critical step of the protocol. The membrane of expanded lysosomes is extremely fragile, and their morphology can be strongly affected by the fixation method. Hence, the aim of this section is to describe a detailed protocol based on three different fixation procedures, which allows to preserve at its best the lysosomal morphology.\nMethanol-based fixation procedure:\nPour pure methanol in a multi-well or in any kind of plastic support you need to use.\nPut methanol-containing multi-well at \u221220\u00b0C in a fridge.\nWait approximately for 15\u00a0min.\nPut multi-well from 6d on ice.\nUsing the appropriate forceps, transfer coverslips-containing cells into cold methanol.\nWait 5\u00a0min.\nCritical: Do not extend fixation time over 5\u00a0min, as the methanol fixation also promotes membranes permeabilization and, as such, a longer exposure could eventually affect per\u00a0se the lysosomal morphology.\nAspirate methanol and wash with 1\u00d7 PBS by 4 or 5 rapid washes before proceeding with immunostaining step or confocal microscopy analysis.\nGlutaraldehyde-based fixation procedure:\nAspirate culture medium and wash the cells one time with 1\u00d7 PBS at room temperature (Alcantara-Ortigoza et\u00a0al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nFix the cells by adding a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.05% glutaraldehyde (GA) prepared in 0.2M HEPES buffer for 10\u00a0min (Alcantara-Ortigoza et\u00a0al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nWash the cells once with 4% PFA (prepared in 0.2M HEPES buffer) to remove the residual GA and fix them again by adding 4% PFA and incubate them at RT for 30\u00a0min.\nWash the cells three time with 1\u00d7 PBS solution before proceeding with immunostaining step or microscopy analysis.\nCritical: Upon fixation, cells can be stored at 4\u00b0C for few days. If a longer period is needed, it is recommended to seal up the multi-well plate with Parafilm to avoid any evaporation of the PBS solution.Formaldehyde-based fixation procedure:\nAspirate culture medium and wash the cells one time with 1\u00d7 PBS at RT.\nFix the cells by adding formaldehyde solution (3.7% in 1\u00d7 PBS) and let it to act for 30\u00a0min at RT.\nDuring incubation, prepare the glycine-based blocking solution (0.1M Gly in 1\u00d7 PBS). This solution must be freshly prepared and cooled in ice before use.\nAspirate fixation solution and replace it with glycine-based blocking solution. Incubate on ice for 5\u00a0min.\nWash the cells two times with 1\u00d7 PBS before proceeding with the immunostaining protocol.\nCell immunostaining of lysosomal endogenous proteins\nTiming: \u223c3 h\nThis section describes the immunostaining method for the endogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1 protein. This is a critical step for both the visualization of enlarged lysosomes by means of confocal microscopy and for the quantitative analysis of their morphological changes (i.e.,: number, size, diameter).\nIn our study, we used anti-Lamp1 antibody to visualize the lysosomal compartment.\nAfter having treated cells with amino acid analogs and proceeded with fixation protocol, cells were permeabilized by using blocking buffer (0.05% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin in 1\u00d7 PBS) for 15\u00a0min at RT.\nNote: Methanol fixation method already promotes cell permeabilization. Thus, step 6a can be omitted.\nDuring the blocking step, dilute at a 1:500 ratio the anti-Lamp1 antibody in blocking buffer.\nWash cells once with 1\u00d7 PBS at 25\u00b0C.\nMix the diluted antibody by inverting or vortexing, and spin down for a second.\nPrepare a rectangle of parafilm on the working bench by spreading a few drops of water between the parafilm and the bench to let it to adhere.Add 50\u00a0\u03bcL of the diluted primary antibody solution on the parafilm. This volume is appropriate for 10\u00a0mm and 13\u00a0mm coverslips. Add more volume for larger coverslips. The right volume is the one that allows the coverslip to float on the drop.\nGently put the coverslip upside-down with the cells in contact with the drops of antibody-containing solution and incubate for 1\u00a0h at RT.\nNote: This drop-based protocol allows one to reduce the consumption of the antibody for each experiment, yet without influencing the efficacy and/or reproducibility of the procedure.\nCritical: Before positioning the coverslip on the drops, remove the excess PBS solution that is still adsorbed on the coverslip by letting it touch the surface of a piece of adsorbing paper. This step is fundamental to avoid any further and undesired dilution of the antibody.\nAfte the incubation with primary antibody, add 150\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00d7 PBS between parafilm and coverslip to let it float on the drops.\nCritical: This step is instrumental for transferring back coverslips from Parafilm to multi-well without damaging or leaving cells on the Parafilm bedding.\nWash cells three times with 1\u00d7 PBS for 5\u00a0min each.\nDilute the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies at a ratio of 1:500 using blocking buffer.\nMix the diluted secondary antibodies by inverting or vortexing, and spin down for a second.\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL drops of the diluted secondary antibodies solution.\nCritical: Incubation with secondary antibodies must be performed in the dark. Cover the coverslips with a cover to protect them from light and prevent photobleaching.\nIncubate for 45\u00a0min at RT.\nWash cells three times with 1\u00d7 PBS 5\u00a0min each.\nAdd 10\u00a0\u03bcL of mounting solution on the slide.Dip coverslips in sterile water before putting them on the drop of mounting solution to remove any trace of salts.\nLet them dry in a dark chamber before proceeding with microscopy analysis.\nStep 3: Confocal microscopy acquisition\nTiming: 1\u00a0day\nIn this section we describe in detail the setting and acquisition mode applicable to either living or fixed cells by using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk system (PerkinElmer) (D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or the LSM700 confocal system (Carl Zeiss) (D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; D'Agostino et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), respectively. The protocol described here is applicable for any fluorescent molecule excitable at 488\u00a0nm (such as a GFP, FITC, Alexa Fluor 488, etc.), as well as for other fluorescent molecules excitable at any other different wavelengths.\nLive-imaging acquisition procedure: This section of the protocol describes the visualization of the exogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1-mGFP protein. For the live-based visualization, cells must be grown in multi-well with glass-bottom and the microscope must be equipped with a dedicated chamber necessary to maintain temperature and CO2 at 37\u00b0C and 5%, respectively.\nSwitch on the microscope and set up parameters to the thermostatic chamber to let it reach the selected temperature and CO2.\nAll samples are observed by using an oil immersion objective (63\u00d7 1.4 NA).\nThe channel is set to 488-nm laser by using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk software.\nAdjust the laser power and time exposure. For this study, the variables were adjusted as follows: laser power at 50% and time exposure between 200 and 500\u00a0ms.\nResearchers should optimize the settings for optimal image intensity.\nAfter capturing, images can be processed using the Ultraview VoX spinning disk software to adjust their intensity.\nCapture images from at least 20 different fields for the quantification of lysosomal diameter.Acquired images are saved as .Tiff, .JPG or .PNG formats and can be visualized for quantitative analysis by using the ImageJ Fiji software.\nAcquisition procedure from fixed cells: This section describes the visualization of stained cells to analyze the endogenous lysosomal marker Lamp1 protein. All images are acquired by confocal microscopy. To use LSM700 software, researchers need to refer to the manufacturer\u2019s manual for the Zeiss LSM700 instrument.\nAll samples are observed using a confocal microscope equipped with a 63\u00d7 or 40\u00d7 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. The observation can be made even with a non-confocal microscope.\nCritical: Do not use non-oil objectives. The oil is necessary to improve the resolving power of the microscope which is crucial to get high-resolution images that allow the best estimation of the dimension from the smallest to the largest lysosomal structures.\nThe channel is set to 488-nm laser by using the LSM700 Zeiss software.\nAdjust the pinhole, laser power, PMT gain, and offset. For this study, the variables were adjusted as follows: pinhole at 0,42 A.U., laser power at 2.0, PMT gain between 500 and 700, and the offset at \u221220.\nResearchers should optimize the settings for optimal image intensity varying and keeping laser power or PMT gain always under the maximum before bleaching. Anyway, the instructions we have provided on the Lamp1-mGFP expressing cells, the antibody against Lamp1, and the fixation procedures guarantee the optimal outcome which can be easily reached also with other acquisition systems including the non-confocal ones.\nAfter capturing, images can be processed using LSM700 Zeiss software to adjust their intensity.\nCapture images from at least 20 different fields of three independent experiments. For a good statistically significant quantification, one need to analyze at least 50 lysosomal diameters for 20 cells/experiment for a total of 3000 lysosomal diameters.Acquired images are saved as \u201c.lsm5\u201d format and can be opened using LSM700 or ImageJ Fiji software. Images can then be exported to the .Tiff, .JPG, .PNG, and many others for the post-processing analysis.", "The Exemplar modules to be utilized are the:\n1 Genetic Algorithm Module \\(GA Module) &#x2013; This module implements an Artificial Intelligence approach to finding logical combinations of SNP&#x2019;s for association based studies\n2 Association Study Module \\(AS Module) &#x2013; this module calculates many useful statistics like Chi Square, Yates, Fisher Exact, Odds Ratio, LD, D&#x2019;, etc.\n3 Chromosome Alteration module \\(CA Module) &#x2013; this module performs LOH analysis on the dataset using user-specified controls as the reference set to identify possible deletions in the chromosome.\nThe difficulty with such a small sample size is the lack of statistical power. Nonetheless, we hoped that by performing multiple types of analysis on the data, we could reduce the problem space from ~10,000 SNP&#x2019;s to &lt;50 SNP&#x2019;s for consideration.

These steps do not need to be carried out within the confines of a biological safety cabinet unless the downstream application is culture of isolated microglia (not recommended). If cell culture is the downstream application, perform all steps where the cell solution is exposed to the atmosphere in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet.\nPerfuse adult mouse transcardially with 20\u00a0mL of ice-cold HBSS and dissect entire brain or brain\u00a0region of interest (see note) with razor blades on ice and keep in ice-cold HBSS until homogenization. For a visual reference on transcardial perfusion with a syringe, please see Method Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nNote: Following the perfusion of mouse with ice-cold HBSS, microdissection of brain regions of interest and whole brain razor blade chopping should be performed on a petri dish embedded in wet ice.\nNote: Meninges do not need to be removed at this step, meningeal removal will be accomplished via discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation.\nNote: A perfusion rate of 10\u00a0mL/min is recommended to prevent vessel rupture and ensure a thorough perfusion.\nNote: Mice below 2\u00a0months of age may not require 20mL to achieve a thorough perfusion, although there is minimal risk in over-perfusing, so we recommend using 20mL regardless of age, with the exception of neonates which cannot be perfused, and brains can be directly extracted following euthanasia.Note: This protocol can be applied to brain regions as small as an adult mouse hippocampus, although experience with the protocol is recommended as the Percoll layers and cell pellets will be difficult to identify with such a limited input.\nNote: If performing this procedure on multiple mice, brains should be dissected and kept in ice-cold HBSS (7\u00a0mL) until razor blade chopping and homogenization. This volume of HBSS is ideal for downstream homogenization. Do not proceed directly to homogenization after dissection.\nNote: Our experience finds that one adult mouse forebrain hemisphere is the ideal amount of tissue for this procedure to achieve the most efficient yield. This procedure can be completed with an entire brain, however in our experimental design, another hemisphere is used for drop fixation or freshly snap frozen. It is recommended to process by half brains for beginners and move to whole brain when protocol is mastered.\nNote: Chopping once or twice sagittally and 3\u20134 times coronally will reduce the time homogenization takes in the next portion of this protocol and will contribute to a successful homogenization.\nNote: In our experiments, the cerebellum is excluded on account of transcriptional distinction of microglia within this brain region. Depending on the downstream experiment, the experimenter may wish to remove the cerebellum for microglia isolation. This protocol can be performed with the cerebellum intact.\nDump entire contents of one brain in HBSS into a clean ice-cold Dounce homogenizer pre-rinsed with ice-cold HBSS.\nNote: Clean glass homogenizers with soap and water, then rinse 3x with ample distilled water. Finally, ensure that the homogenizers are rinsed with ice-cold HBSS before brain homogenization to ensure proper tonicity within the homogenizer environment.\nVery gently and slowly begin to homogenize the brain tissue with the A pestle (or loose pestle).Push down on the tissue with the pestle until brain tissue is slightly expelled up and around the sides of the pestle foot and in-between the wall of the homogenizer.\nGently twist to separate the expelled tissue from the rest of the brain tissue.\nNote: For a guide on how to homogenize brain tissue with pestle A, see Method Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nCritical: The quality of homogenization is the single most important factor in determining downstream cell quality. Because this is a mechanical dissociation, it is imperative to be gentle and slow when beginning the homogenization.\nContinue homogenizing gently with pestle A until all remaining chunks can bypass the foot of pestle A upon depression and retraction with minimal resistance. When the mixture is similar in appearance to the image shown in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, begin homogenization with pestle B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1990-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Representative images of the homogenization solution after completion of pestles A and B\n(A) Once the homogenization mixture reaches the consistency shown in this image, the suspension is ready to begin homogenization with pestle B.\n(B) Once the suspension reaches the consistency shown in panel B, the suspension is ready to be poured into a 15\u00a0mL tube for centrifugation.\nBegin homogenization with pestle B.\nNote: Similar to pestle A, moving too fast or applying too much force with the pestle will apply excessive shear force and will destroy microglia. Therefore, it is critical to apply slow, even strokes with pestle B. For a visual reference on the proper homogenization technique to follow with pestle B, please see Method Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nHomogenize with pestle B until barely any visible chunks are visible.Note: Some myelin debris will be impossible to homogenize into a single cell suspension but ensure that no pink brain tissue chunks are visible. Consult Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B for a visual guide to what can be considered thorough homogenization.\nCritical: In addition to maintaining cell viability, it is critical that as close to a single cell solution as possible is achieved. Doublets and other large cell aggregates will be excluded upon cell sorting, which can reduce microglia yield. However, over-homogenization will also reduce the viability of the preparation and should be avoided.\nOnce thoroughly homogenized, dump contents into a fresh, pre-chilled Falcon 15mL tube.\nRinse homogenizer with ice-cold HBSS (7\u00a0mL) and do five slow passes with both pestles A and B. Add the contents of this wash step to the tube containing the homogenization mixture.\nNote: If interested in analyzing homogenous mixture, 500\u00a0\u03bcL can be taken, centrifuged to pellet the cells and snap frozen for downstream applications.\nRinse the homogenizer with 7-mL ice-cold HBSS and apply vigorous strokes (10 times) with both pestles A and B to ensure no stuck cells which could be added to downstream homogenizations.\nDiscard the HBSS. Repeat the homogenization process for the remaining brains.\nWhen all samples are homogenized, pellet the mixture by centrifuging at 350 g at 4\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min.\nNote: Given that a slow and careful homogenization is key to the success of this protocol, each brain can take upwards up 15\u00a0min to complete with an average of 5\u00a0min per homogenization step. Therefore, if many samples are being used in one experiment, multiple people homogenizing can expedite this protocol.If not already prepared, prepare however many Falcon tubes equal to the number of samples in the experiment by adding 5\u00a0mL of 70% Percoll to the 15-mL Falcon tubes and leaving them at room temperature.\nNote: Ensure that 70% Percoll and 37% Percoll solutions are prepared and at room temperature prior to this step.\nRemove tubes from centrifuge and dump out the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet, and place in a rack holder.\nNote: For a visual reference of what the homogenate will look like after centrifugation, please refer to Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1990-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

A thorough resuspension will ensure that microglia clumped to other cell types will not get pulled away from the interphase layer. We recommend initially re-suspending with one mL of 37% Percoll with a P1000 and adding the additional 4\u00a0mL of Percoll with a pipette controller.\nSlowly and carefully layer the 37% Percoll resuspension on top of the 70% Percoll layer previously prepared in step 11.\nNote: For a visual reference of what the separated layers should look like prior to centrifugation, please refer to Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nCritical: Mixing of the layers will destroy the interphase separation. To avoid this, use the gravity setting of the pipette and very slowly apply the first milliliter of the 37% layer. Hold the tube containing the 70% Percoll at a 65\u00b0 angle initially to slow liquid travel down the tube. Adjust the angle of the tube to vertical (90\u00b0) as you add more 37% Percoll. For a visual guide of this process, please refer to Method Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].\nOnce all samples are layered, carefully return them to the centrifuge in the respective swinging bucket and set the centrifuge settings to 23\u00b0C, 25\u00a0min, 800 g, acceleration 3 and brake 1.\nNote: Given the minimal brake, this step will take around 30\u00a0min total.\nNote: Remove tubes from centrifuge very gently so as not to disturb the interphase layer.\nNote: Set the centrifuge temperature to 4\u00b0C immediately after removing the tubes.\nWhile these tubes are spinning, prepare the necessary number of Falcon 15-mL tubes by dumping out the blocking buffer and filling the tubes with 8\u00a0mL of FACS buffer.Bring all tubes back to the workspace and, using a P1000, collect the interphase layer of cells. Collect between 2 to 3\u00a0mL, expelling into the appropriately labeled Falcon 15-mL tube containing FACS buffer.\nNote: For a visual reference of what the layer should look like, please refer to Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Method Video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]. For a visual guide of the vacuuming procedure, please see Method Video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6].\nNote: The interphase layer may look like a hazy disc and should appear exactly at 5\u00a0mL. After vacuuming this layer with your pipette, the separation between the two layers should become glassy.\nNote: While it is not necessary, it may be helpful to aspirate the layer of myelin debris which will be on top of the 37% layer, with either an aspirator connection or a P1000 to facilitate interphase layer collection.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 4\u00b0C, 350 g for 5\u00a0min.\nFollowing centrifugation, aspirate or remove all but 300\u00a0\u03bcL of liquid from the Falcon 15-mL tubes and re-suspend the pellet.\nNote: At this point forward, it will be difficult to identify the pellet and gauge whether the pellet is re-suspended. Ensure even and thorough resuspension by agitating all sides of the bottom of the Falcon 15-mL tubes for subsequent resuspension steps with at least 10 pumps of a P1000.\nNote: fill an extra 15-mL Falcon tube with 300\u00a0\u03bcL of liquid to give you a reference of the volume to keep in your experimental tubes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1990-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

We recommend beginners to stain for acetylated-tubulin or polyglutamylated-tubulin as centriolar markers, which are used as landmarks to control intracellular isotropic expansion.\nSecondary antibodies should be coupled to fluorophores that remain stable in water, such as Alexa 488, 555, or 568. For example, Rhodamine fluorescence is lost when placed in water.\nOptional: ATTO 647N NHS ester labeling, as in section 14.\nWe recommend beginners to add this step to visualize the embryo in the gel and trim it easily.

Incubate 1 h.\nPlace the gel on a parafilm and measure its final size (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Water-rehydrated is the most unstable state for antibodies and fluorophores. Expand only prior to imaging and prefer PBS immersion for storage.\nCritical: Do not let the gel dry, otherwise it will fragilize its structure, make it brittle, and eventually break. If the gel becomes opaque and porous during one of the transfer steps, rehydrate with a few drops of water. The gel should become translucent again instantly.\nMounting for imaging\nTiming: 10\u00a0min\nThis step is usually performed at the microscope once the optimal orientation of the gel has been defined. You will have to consider the working distance of the objectives, which can be a major limitation. We detail the mounting for inverted microscopes here. We recommend using Attofluor chambers for two reasons: 1/ PDL-coated coverslips can easily be prepared and replaced, 2/ the weight of the chamber helps stabilize the sample, compared to a plastic confocal dish. Mounting is a crucial step to prevent the gel from drifting while imaging.\nMounting.Prepare the mounting station with a parafilm, Kimwipes, and a spatula Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPlace a PDL-coated coverslip in the Attofluor chamber.\nWith a spatula, dry the gel on a Kimwipe by blotting it several times on a Kimwipe. It is essential to remove as much water as possible to favor grip on the coverslip.\nPlace the gel in the chamber. Press very gently if air bubbles are between the coverslip and the gel, troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nOptional: trim the corners of the gel if needed to close the chamber.\nAdd 1\u20132 drops of water on top of the gel. The gel is now ready to be imaged (Methods video\u00a0S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6], mounting, related to step 5).\nCritical: Make sure the gel stays hydrated by adding a drop of water every \u223c30\u00a0min during the imaging session. Artifacts such as sudden drift or fluorescent increase may mean that the gel is shrinking due to dehydration. In this case, rehydrate the gel and wait 5\u00a0min until the gel stabilizes before imaging more.\nNote: Once adherent to the PDL-coated coverslip, the gel will be difficult to detach. You can use a pipet to add water between the gel and the coverslip. When detaching, be very gentle not to break the gel.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S6.

Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Reserve a small amount for cardiac perfusion.Anesthetize the research animal according to institutional requirements. Vaporized isoflurane will anesthetize the mice and slow the breathing rate. Animals should be alive, but non-responsive to serious toe pinch.

Ensure that sections are submerged and loosely separated. Continue bubbling at 20\u00b0C\u201324\u00b0C for 1\u20131.5 h. Take care that bubbling is not so vigorous as to cause turbulence/tumbling of the sections. Continue shielding from light with sheets of aluminum foil.Critical: All materials and equipment involved in the preparation of acute brain slices must not have come in contact with fixative (paraformaldehyde or equivalent). Reserve glassware, dissection tools, and vibratome for \u201clive tissue only.\u201d Do not share equipment with lab personnel that use fixative or other harsh chemicals, as it will seriously compromise your tissue. It is recommended not to use detergents or use department dishwashers. Thorough rinsing in water and scrubbing with reserved glassware brush will suffice. Application of 70% ethanol may be used to keep bacteria from growing on tools or slice chambers.\nCritical: GCaMP indicators are light sensitive and will bleach if exposed to intense light. Slice in low light conditions if possible, and ensure that sectioned tissue is shielded from room illumination by covering water-baths and slice-storage chambers with aluminum foil during recovery. Brain slices from juvenile animals are typically healthier and offer good expression of GCaMP indicator. Tissue from aged animals may be less healthy, but this is not limiting. See Ting et\u00a0al. (2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) for additional tips on preparing slices from aging animals.\nCalcium imaging\nTiming: 4\u20137 h\nThe techniques to keep brain slices alive and heathy for calcium imaging are identical to those used for electrophysiological recordings. Illumination of tissue with a blue LED and collecting green fluorescence is done using a standard GFP filter-set.\nThe sCMOS camera used here is controlled via Micromanager software, which can also interface with the SliceScope microscope stage (Scientifica). Many popular microscope cameras, such as Hamamatsu or Photometrics cameras, use CCD or sCMOS sensors that offer high sensitivity and speed, and are excellent for detecting fluorescent calcium signals. Most devices are\u00a0already compatible with the Micromanager software (https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Device_Support[href=https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Device_Support]).Prepare the 1\u00d7 ACSF recording solution. Calcium events are very numerous in astrocytes, while very sparse in granule cells. It is often beneficial to adjust the levels of Ca2+ and Mg2+ depending on which cells you will observe to slightly increase or decrease network excitability.\nCombine in ddH2O\nFor Astrocytes:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_446_5.csv\nFor granule cells and mossy cells:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_446_6.csv\nFor CCK Cells:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_446_7.csv\nBubble for at least 10\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201324\u00b0C with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\npH to 7.24.\nAdjust osmolarity to \u223c 305 mOsm.\nBegin perfusion of ACSF on the microscope, continuing to bubble, and use an IV dripper and flow regulator to control the perfusion rate to about 1\u20132\u00a0mL/min.\nIdentify regions to image.\nPlace a single slice in upright microscope recording chamber. Secure with a slice anchor.\nLocate the dentate gyrus with a 10\u00d7 air objective.\nSwitch to a long-working distance water-dipping objective with 40\u00d7 magnification. Confirm the presence of mCherry+ virally targeted CCK neurons containing DREADD construct, and green GCaMP expression in neurons or astrocytes. GCaMP has a low baseline fluorescence, which can be observed as a diffuse green signal. Typically, spread of injected AAV2/5-GCaMP is not spatially restricted as tightly as AAV2-hM3Dq virus, and expression can be found in cells beyond the hilar region, presumably due to differences in capsid or infectability of different cell types. See Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for typical live-fluorescence appearance of hM3Dq-mCherry and GCaMP expression in astrocytes or neurons in the dentate gyrus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/446-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

(2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] for additional examples and resolutions.\nSet up an imaging session that acquires data at two different XY stage positions and extends for several different depths into the slice. Adjust the number of cycles to last approximately 10\u00a0min.\nNote: Calcium events in acute slice preparation can last several seconds at 20\u00b0C\u201324\u00b0C, depending on the specific GCaMP variant that is utilized (fast or slow) and the cell type. Since the frame-rates of most cameras greatly exceed the duration of these calcium events, some time resolution can be sacrificed in order to gain additional image planes. Adjustment of specific imaging parameters may be required for your application.\nThe main limitation on time resolution of image acquisition is the refocusing and movement of the XY translational stage. The following parameters worked well for a Scientifica microscope and Micromanager software and gave an effective time resolution of 2.85 s. While some fast events may be missed, this is acceptable for detecting the majority of slow buffered calcium events.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_446_8.csv\nPower the camera and stage and then start the Micromanager software.

As the fluorescent signal does indeed bleach over time, and cellular activities may be susceptible to phototoxicity, it is critically important not to over-illuminate the tissue.\nPush \u201cAcquire!\u201d to start collecting Data_1.\nWhen complete, turn off the LED and briefly review the dataset. Save the data to disk with an appropriate filename.\nAdd CNO to the ACSF reservoir to begin circuit stimulation of CCK cells.

For examples, see Asrican et\u00a0al., (2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nOptional: Some researchers may wish to acquire calcium data during the 10\u00a0min delay in step 8d, or perhaps an additional 10\u00a0min period of washout. In this case there will be a total of 3\u20134 datasets from each slice.\nNote: A highly sensitive CCD camera is useful when imaging calcium, so that the intensity of the illumination light can be minimized. An Optimos sCMOS camera from Q-Imaging is used in this example. While not used here, TTL control of the LED, or addition of a mechanical shutter in the light path can prevent excitation of the sample during non-imaging episodes of the acquisition, such as during focusing or stage-translation.\nNote: Halogen lamps as illumination sources have some intrinsic fluctuations in intensity and result in signal disturbances when sensitive cameras are used. LEDs are typically much more reliable in terms of constant output and have the advantage of also permitting control via TTL signals.", "**A. Isolation of embryos**\n1.

Briefly, the mature miRNA sequence\\(s) of interest is retrieved from miRBase \\(http://www.mirbase.org/, current release 15). The reverse transcription \\(RT) primer is designed such that at the temperature used for reverse transcription it adopts a stable stem-loop structure \\(dG < -1.5), while under qPCR conditions the stem-loop structure is no longer favored \\(dG > -0.5). mFold software10 \\(http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/) is used to predict conformations and free energy values of the reverse transcription primer under the conditions used for reverse transcription and qPCR respectively \\(Fig. 2b). The last 6 nucleotides at the 3\u2019 end of the reverse transcription primer are the reverse complement of the last 6 nucleotides of the miRNA of interest.A pair of qPCR primers is then designed where the reverse primer \\(with respect to the original miRNA sequence) extends at least one nucleotide beyond the 6 nucleotides used for reverse transcription priming while the 5\u2019 end anneals to the stem-loop region of the RT primer \\(Fig. 2a). The forward primer extends such that it is at most head-to-head with the reverse primer \\(i.e. PCR gap = 0 nt) and will usually requires a 5\u2019 GC rich sequence for efficient amplification. Due to the short lengths of the miRNAs, qPCR amplicons generated may be of almost indistinguishable size compared to primer-dimer products, unless dissociations are carried out using high-resolution melt analyses. It is thus critical to minimize primer-primer hybridization to avoid non-specific amplification. Most primer designing softwares \\(e.g. Beacon Designer, DNAman, Premier Primer) allow the evaluation of primer-primer complementarity. There is also a free online edition of Beacon Designer \\(http://www.premierbiosoft.com/qOligo/Sequence.jsp?PID=1) that is adequate for this purpose \\(Fig. 2c).\nFigure 2.\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1681/original/figure1.png?1292738298\" > <img src=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/1681/thumbnail/figure1.png?1292738298\" > </a>\nCell Culture\nCells can be lysed in a 96-well format to minimize reagents requirements. Typically, 10,000 cells can be seeded per well without being over-confluent or forming multiple-layers.\nCell Lysis\n1. Observe wells using a microscope to ensure cells are evenly seeded within and between wells.\n  \n2. Prepare the lysis buffer as specified in Table 1.\n  \nIn our experience, as little as 25 \u00b5l of lysis buffer can be used to efficiently lyse up to 10,000 cells in 96-well format. This would result in significant reagent savings. However, it is advisable to first use 40 \u00b5l to ensure sufficient surface coverage and efficient lysis of cells.\n3. Aspirate cell culture media from wells and wash cells gently once with 100 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline \\(PBS). Before lysis, remove PBS as completely as possible.4. Add 40 \u00b5l of lysis buffer to cells. Gently triturate the cells, minimizing bubble formation.\n  \n5. Transfer the lysate from the cell culture wells to a 96-well PCR plate or PCR tubes as appropriate.\n  \n6. Centrifuge briefly to collect the lysate to the bottom of the wells/tubes.\n  \n7. Incubate the lysate for 37\u00baC for 30 min, followed by 70\u00baC for 10 min to deactivate the DNase.\n  \nReverse Transcription \\(Timing: 35 min)\n8. Prepare the RT master mix as specified in Table 2:\n  \n9. Carefully aliquot RT master mix into the DNase-treated samples.\n  \n10. Vortex samples and centrifuge briefly to collect samples at the bottom of the wells/tubes.\n  \n11. Carry out the RT reaction at 42\u00baC for 30 min, followed by 70\u00baC for 5 min to inactivate the RT enzyme.\n  \nWe find that it is not necessary to allow primer annealing with an additional heating/cooling step in the presence of the RT primers.\nPause point: The cDNA products may be stored at -20\u00baC for at least 1 year.\n12. Dilute cDNA product to 10% vol/vol with nuclease free water. Aliquot cDNA products into PCR reaction vessels.\n  \nQuantitative PCR \\(Timing : ~90 min depending on thermal cycler)\n13. Prepare the qPCR master mix as specified in Table 3.\n  \n14. Perform qPCR with the following thermal cycling parameters on an appropriate qPCR-enabled thermal cycler. Table 4 is an example of cycling parameters on the CFX96\u2122 Real-Time PCR System.\n  \n15. Analyze qPCR results with software compatible with the data generated.", "1. Glass surface treatment and passivation:\nNOTE: This section includes three major steps (see Figure 1): (i) cleaning and hydrophilization, (ii) silanization, and (iii) surface passivation.\nCleaning and hydrophilization\n\t\nUse Piranha solution for glass surface cleaning.\n\t\tNOTE: Piranha solution is a mixture of 30% H2O2 and 70% H2SO4 (Table of Materials). Its prime goal is to remove organic contaminations from coverslip surfaces and expose the OH groups on the glass surface. In this manner, the glass surface becomes hydrophilic.\nPlace 10-12 #1.5 (22 mm x 22 mm) glass coverslips (Table of Materials) in a homemade polytetrafluoroethylene holder (base area: 5.5 cm\u00a0x 5.5 cm). Transfer the polytetrafluoroethylene holder into a 400 mL beaker (Table of Materials), and incubate it with 300 mL of Piranha solution for 2 h. Do this step on ice and in a chemical hood.\n\t\tNOTE: The polytetrafluoroethylene pole screwed to the holder base is 12 cm long, longer than the beaker (11 cm), which allows for the safe transfer/pull-out of the holder into/from the Piranha solution. Since the Piranha solution can still be highly reactive and very hot, it is imperative to stop the reaction. The easiest way to stop the reaction is to pour the Piranha solution into (tap) water to achieve a 50x dilution (at least). The solution can then be safely discarded. Never keep the used Piranha solution in a closed glass bottle \u2013 this could end in a bottle explosion.\nTransfer the polytetrafluoroethylene holder into a clean beaker filled with fresh double-distilled water (DDW) to wash excess Piranha from the coverslips.\nTransfer the beaker into a sonication bath (Table of Materials), and sonicate at 80 Hz at full power for 10 min at 25 \u00b0C. Repeat this step two more times with fresh DDW. Use fresh DDW at each time.\nSilanizationTransfer the holder into a clean beaker (400 mL) filled with 300 mL of pure methanol (Table of Materials) and then into a sonication bath (Table of Materials). Sonicate at 80 Hz at full power for 30 min at 25 \u00b0C.\nAfter sonication, transfer the holder into a silane solution prepared using 15 mL of DDW, 3.1 mL of acetic acid (Table of Materials), 340 mL of methanol, and 7.6 mL of silane ((3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane) (Table of Materials). Seal the beaker with parafilm, and keep it in the fridge at 4 \u00b0C overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: The preparation and handling of the silane solution must be performed in a chemical hood. After the silanization step, put the used silane solution (waste) in a dedicated glass bottle within the chemical hood.\nOn the next day, transfer the holder into a clean beaker filled with 300 mL of pure methanol for 15 s. Then, transfer the holder into a clean beaker, not before drying the bottom of the polytetrafluoroethylene holder to remove excess methanol. Transfer the beaker to the oven (Table of Materials) to dry the glass coverslips for 5 min at 120 \u00b0C.\nSurface passivation with an inert polymer\n\t\nAchieve surface passivation by incubating the glass coverslips with an inert polymer (Table of Materials). For each experiment, take two coverslips and place them in a Petri dish coated with a parafilm layer initially cleaned with ethanol (EtOH) (DDW/EtOH: 30/70 vol/vol) (Table of Materials).\nIncubate each coverslip with 1 mL of a 4 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 5 kDa molecular weight methoxy polyethylene glycol maleimide (mPEG-mal, Mw = 5 kDa) (Table of Materials) in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Table of Materials) for 1 h at 22 \u00b0C.NOTE: Placing the coverslips on a hydrophobic parafilm layer confines the hydrophilic PEG polymer solution to the glass coverslip surface. The incubation time is critical for achieving optimal passivation. Use incubation times ranging between 45 min and 2 h. Above this incubation time, the glass coverslips surface can deteriorate, leading to protein adhesion and a loss of transparency.\nAt the end of the incubation process, rinse each coverslip with 5 mL of DDW, and dry with a flow of N2 (gas). Do not dry the coverslips under a vacuum. Since the coverslips must be kept wet after passivation, immediately put 1 mL of 10 mM Tris on the pegylated surfaces. Use the coverslips within 2 h.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: The various steps must be performed in a laminar flow chamber to prevent glass surface contamination.\n2. Protein purification\nPurify G-actin from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder using the gel filtration method24.\n\t\nActin purification takes 1 week. Keep the purified G-actin in G-buffer (5 mM Tris pH 7.8, 0.01% NaN3, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, and 1 mM DTT), and store it on ice. Use the solution within 2 weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: Replace the ice every couple of days.\nLabel the actin with a maleimide-modified fluorescent dye16 (Table of Materials). Purify the GST-fascin based on the method of Ono et al.25. Flash-freeze both proteins in liquid N2, and store at \u221280 \u00b0C.\nUse a standard protocol to purify myosin II from rabbit skeletal muscle26. The purified myosin II (dimers) stock buffer includes 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.5 M KCl, and 35% w/v sucrose. Flash-freeze the myosin in liquid N2, and store at \u221280 \u00b0C.NOTE: The high concentration of KCl keeps the myosin motors in a dimeric form, while the high percentage of sucrose assures that the activity of the motors is not hampered upon freezing. Use a dedicated pipette for viscous fluid handling when working with myosin II stock solutions (Table of Materials).\n\t\nLabel the myosin II dimers with a fluorescent dye (Table of Materials) at pairs of engineered cysteine residues19,27. Use a chicken gizzard RLC mutant A for that purpose26. Flash-freeze the labeled myosin II in liquid N2, and store at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\t\tNOTE: This labeling procedure assures that the labeled myosin is active as the native myosin II protein.\nUse a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Table of Materials) to measure the absorbance of the stock protein solutions, and deduce the protein concentrations with the Beer-Lambert law using the following extinction coefficients: G-actin (\u03b5290 = 26,460 M\u22121\u00b7cm\u22121), GST-fascin (\u03b5280 = 99,330 M\u22121\u00b7cm\u22121), myosin II dimer (\u03b5280 = 268,800 M\u22121\u00b7cm\u22121), and RLC mutant A (\u03b5280 = 3,960 M\u22121\u00b7cm\u22121)19.\n3. Sample preparation\nNOTE: Polymerize the actin monomers in the presence of large aggregates of myosin II motors and the strong passive crosslinker fascin to produce macroscopically contractile elastic actomyosin networks19,23. Adding fluorescent beads to the solution allows for tracking the solvent flow during gel contraction.\nProtein (\"actomyosin\") solution\n\t\nExcept for G-actin, keep the proteins at \u221280\u00b0C in small aliquots, and thaw them at 37 \u00b0C before use. The actomyosin solution's total volume is 40 \u00b5L.Prepare the solution by mixing 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM ATP, an ATP regenerating system (0.5 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 creatine kinase and 5 mM creatine phosphate), 200 \u00b5M EGTA (chelates Ca2+ ions), an anti-bleaching solution (0.1 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 glucose oxidase, 0.018 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 catalase, and 5 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 glucose), 5 \u00b5M G-actin, 280 nM GST-fascin, and 1.67 nM myosin II. The percentage of labeled G-actin is 5% (molar percentage).\n\t\tNOTE: Use a low percentage of labeled G-actin to avoid the saturation of the fluorescent signal at the advanced stages of gel contraction.\nPreparing myosin II motor aggregates\n\t\nAdd the myosin motors to the protein solution in the form of aggregates. To form large myosin aggregates (150 myosin dimers/aggregate), dilute the myosin stock solution with 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 to reach a final concentration of 25 mM KCl.\nKeep the diluted myosin solution for 10 min at room temperature (RT), and then transfer it to ice until use. The motors are fully active for up to 2 h.\nMeasuring the solvent flow\n\t\nTo track the solvent flow across the gel pores, add the fluorescent beads to the actomyosin solution. Reduce the interaction between the beads and the actomyosin network by passivating the beads. Practically, incubate 1 \u00b5L of beads (Table of Materials) with 5 \u00b5M G-actin for 20 min at RT, and then remove excess G-actin by centrifugation (Table of Materials) (conditions: 6,000 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C).\nRepeat this step with 10 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Table of Materials) to block (possibly) the remaining uncoated surface. Use the beads at a final dilution of 1:10,000 vol/vol in the experiments.NOTE: It is important to adapt the beads' diameter to the gel pore size such that the bead/pore size ratio is <1 at all stages.\nEffect of solution viscosity\n\t\nControl the viscosity of the solution by adding glycerol (Table of Materials) to the actomyosin solution. Adding glycerol at a weight percent ranging from 0% to 34% induces a corresponding increase in the solution viscosity from \u03b7\u03c9 to 2.76 \u03b7\u03c9, where \u03b7\u03c9\u00a0is the viscosity of water at 20 \u00b0C28.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: It is essential to use a dedicated pipette for viscous fluid handling when working with glycerol (Table of Materials).\n4. Running an experiment\nHomemade sample holder handling\n\t\nTake one of the PEG-passivated coverslips, place a greased parafilm spacer on top of it, and place it in the sample holder.\n\t\tNOTE: One can replace the parafilm spacer with any spacer.\nPreparing the actomyosin solution\n\t\nPrepare the actomyosin solution on ice in a microcentrifuge tube by incorporating the various microscopic constituents, adding the myosin II motor aggregates, and adding EGTA last. Mix the solution well. The addition of EGTA initiates actomyosin network polymerization, which sets the starting time of the experiment.\nPut 1.1 \u00b5L of that solution on the holder-mounted coverslip, and place the second coverslip on top. Screw the holder to seal the sample. This process slightly squeezes the drop, which adopts a disc-like shape. The drop diameters range between 2,800-3,000 \u00b5m.\nPlace the sample holder on the microscope, and start the acquisition. Prepare the microscope in advance to reduce the initial acquisition time. It typically takes 1-2 min after mixing to start the sample imaging.\n5. Microscopy techniques\nImage the samples using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Table of Materials) controlled by dedicated software (Table of Materials).Use low magnifications of 2.5x/0.075 Plan-NEOFLUAR objective (Table of Materials) to visualize the whole gel area and follow its macroscopic contraction with time.\nUse a 10x/0.3 Ph1 UPlanFL objective (Table of Materials) to characterize the network porosity and structure and to follow the network self-organization and contraction with time.\n\t\tNOTE: This objective is also useful for localizing the myosin II motor aggregates within the network and following the movement of fluorescent beads across the gel pores. Higher magnifications can be used at the expense of a reduced field of view, which is even more significant in dual-color imaging mode (Table of Materials).\nExcite the samples at 488 nm (actin/fluorescent beads) and 561 nm (myosin motor aggregates/fluorescent beads). Acquire the images at 100 ms per frame with dedicated software (Table of Materials) in streaming mode with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The fluorescent lamp (Table of Materials) intensity should be kept at the lowest possible value to avoid signal saturation during network contraction.\nSimultaneous two-color imaging\n\t\nUse this mode for two purposes: (i) detecting the localization of the myosin motor aggregates within the actin network, and (i) characterizing the outward solvent flow inside and outside during network contraction.\nExcite the actin and myosin II motors at 488 nm and 561 nm, respectively, and record the images simultaneously on an EMCCD camera (Table of Materials) using a dual-emission apparatus (Table of Materials). Use the same imaging system to simultaneously image the actin gel (488 nm) and the fluorescent beads (561 nm).\nSubscription Required.

Ensure that the periosteum is incised.\nGently elevate the periosteum (with a periosteal elevator) on both side of the incision. Rinse the site with sterile saline.\nCylinder placement\nLocate the median and coronal sutures on the skull (Figure 2A,B). Note that these anatomical lines form a cross. The cylinders will be placed in each of the quadrants defined by the cross, ensuring that the edge of the cylinder is not over the suture (Figure 2C).\nPlace the first cylinder on the left upper quadrant (left frontal bone), and try to lay the device flat. Fix in the position with strong hand pressure and screw a micro-screw, until resistance is felt. Ensure that the screw head is flush with the surface of the cylinder tab.\nRepeat the same procedure on the other tab to fix the cylinder tightly onto the skull.

Ensure that bleeding appears.\nDrill two more intramedullary holes along the axis passing through the two tab screws, at the inner edges of the cylinder. Along the perpendicular axe, drill two more intramedullary holes at the inner edges of the cylinder. Ensure that bleeding appears.\nRepeat the operation within the three other cylinders.\nFilling cylinders with material samples and capping (Figure 3)\nPrepare the desired bone substitute material according to manufacturer instructions or material specifications.\nFill the first cylinder to the brim with the material sample and close the cylinder by fitting the cap.

Open-top UV-PAM system (Figure 1)\nOptical illumination\n\t\nUse a Q-switch diode-pumped solid-state laser (266 nm wavelength) as an excitation source.\nUse two convex lenses to expand the laser beam and place a pinhole close to the focal point of the first convex lens to perform spatial filtering.\nReflect the laser beam upward using a 1D galvanometer mirror (1D GM).\nUse an objective lens to focus the laser beam and pass through the center of a ring-shaped ultrasonic transducer (UT) before being tightly focused on a sample.\nUltrasonic detection\n\t\nUse a ring-shaped focused UT to detect ultrasonic waves. The inner and outer diameters of the UT active area are 3 mm and 6 mm, respectively. Focal length: 6.3 mm; center frequency: 40 MHz; -6 dB bandwidth: 84%.\nFix the UT into a lab-made water tank with an optically transparent window at the bottom, covered by a thin quartz coverslip to allow UV light to pass through. Ensure that the active area of the UT is facing upward. Attach the water tank to a two-axis manual stage for controlling the lateral position of the UT.\nTurn on the UV laser, adjust the position of the UT to allow the laser beam to pass through from the center of the UT. Turn off the UV laser. Then, fill the water tank with deionized water to fully immerse the UT.\nConnect the output of the UT to two amplifiers (total gain = 56 dB) and connect the output of the second amplifier to a data acquisition card (DAQ).Attach a sample holder to a z-axis manual stage which is connected to xy-motorized stages. The sample holder has an empty hole that allows UV light to pass through. Attach four pieces of double-sided tape surrounding the hole.\nSystem alignment\n\t\nAttach black tape to a glass slide and place the glass slide to cover the hole of the sample holder, with the black tape facing downward. Press the glass slide to ensure that it is fixed on the sample holder. Then, lower the sample holder to immerse the glass slide into the water.\nDisconnect the ring-shaped UT and amplifiers, connect the UT to the pulser/receiver, and connect the output of the pulser/receiver to an oscilloscope. Operate the pulser/receiver into the Pulse-Echo mode. Set the pulse amplitude and the gain of the pulser/receiver to 6 and 20 dB, respectively.\n\t\t\nEnable the pulser/receiver and adjust the z-position of the sample holder to find the position of the acoustic focal plane where the ultrasonic signals are maximum.\nChange the pulser/receiver to the transmission mode and set the gain to 60 dB. Enable the laser output. Adjust the z-position of the objective lens to maximize the PA signals that are measured by the oscilloscope.\nAdjust the lateral position of the ring-shaped UT to make the generated PA signal symmetric and maximum, which represents that the optical and acoustic foci are coaligned in the lateral plane. Then, adjust the z-position of the sample holder to maximize the PA signals.\nRepeat steps 1.4.3 and 1.4.4 to optimize both the symmetry and amplitude of the PA signals. Record the time delay (i.e., the time it takes for the PA waves to reach the UT) on the oscilloscope when the PA signals are optimized.Move the sample holder to image different positions of the black tape. Adjust the sample holder's flatness such that the PA signals generated from each position of the black tape have the same time delay as the one measured in step 1.4.5.\nTurn off the laser and connect the UT to the two amplifiers.\n2.

Place the sample slices on quartz slides. Dry the slides in an oven at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h.\nDeparaffinize the sections using a clearing agent (see Table of Materials), which removes the paraffin to avoid high background signals as paraffin is highly absorbing with UV excitation.\n\t\tNOTE: Process the sample in a fume hood.\nFresh mouse brain slice\n\t\nSacrifice a mouse with an overdose of anesthesia. Then, harvest the mouse brain following the protocol stated in reference18.\nWash the mouse brain with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the blood.\nCut a slice of the brain sample (~5 mm thick) by hand, and then wash the sample with PBS to remove the blood on the cross section.\n3.

Add a drop of water to the membrane and then place the biological sample on the sample tank to cover the water. In the case of the FFPE slice sample, use tape to fix the glass slide on the membrane.\nPlace the sample-containing sample tank on the sample holder, ensuring to cover the empty hole of the sample holder.\nSet the UV laser to the external-trigger mode. Using our lab-built LabVIEW program (see Table of Materials), set the scanning parameters as follows.\n\t\nSet the laser repetition rate to 55 kHz; set the signal type of the GM driver to triangular and the driving voltage range to 0.018 V (representing \u00b10.018 V; scale factor: 1 V/\u00b0). Set GMnum to 22 and dy to 2 so that after every 22 laser triggers, the GM finishes a quarter of the scanning period, and the y-axis motor moves a step size of 0.3125 \u00b5m. Set dx to 192 so that when the y-axis motor reaches the preset position (e.g., 5 mm), the x-axis motor moves a step size of 30 \u00b5m.\n\t\tNOTE: The smallest incremental step size is set to be 0.15625 \u00b5m for both the x- and y-axis motors. Therefore, when dy = 2, step size equals 0.15625 x 2 = 0.3125 \u00b5m, and when dx = 192, step size equals 0.15625 x 192 = 30 \u00b5m. To scan the entire area of 5 x 5 mm2, the x-axis motor will move 5000 \u00b5m /30 \u00b5m = 167 times, which means that 167 sub-images would be stitched to obtain a whole image. See Figure 2 for the scanning trajectory of the UV-PAM system.Start trial scanning on a small region by setting the number of moving steps of the x- and y-axis motors (xn = 10 and yn = 1000). Adjust the z-axis manual stage to place the sample on the focal plane for obtaining maximum PA signals.\nMove both x- and y-axis motors to the desired starting point, set the scanning region by setting the xn and yn values, and then start the image acquisition program (see Table of Materials).\nAfter the image acquisition, turn off the laser, remove the sample holder, and store the biological samples.\nFor fresh biological tissues, store the samples in 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nFor the FFPE mouse brain slices, stain with H&E following the protocol stated in reference20 to obtain the corresponding H&E-stained images.\nUse the collected PA signals to reconstruct the maximum amplitude projection image using a lab-built image processing algorithm (see Table of Materials).", "This protocol is associated with the following reference:\nW.W.M.

We would recommend using any plastic, collapsible strainer that fits within your specific cooler dimensions.\nNote: We recommend storing the packed cooler at 15\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C within the main compartment of the vehicle when transporting ovaries as to not expose them to extreme temperatures (hot or cold). Although, we also recommend that each individual laboratory should assess if 15\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C is the best ovary storage condition for them and their needs.\nDrive to an abattoir to collect heifer or cow ovaries.Note: Depending on the situation, it may be best to prepare oocyte collection and maturation media before departing for the abattoir. However, if someone else is driving to the abattoir for the person needing ovaries, they would have the luxury to prepare media dishes anytime in this process as long as it is before the 2-hour minimum mark (see below for more information on media equilibration times). Conversely, if the user is responsible for both going to the abattoir and media equilibration, it would be most beneficial if media equilibration started before their departure to the abattoir. This way the user can get started immediately upon arriving with ovaries to the laboratory and not have to wait 2-hours for media equilibration before starting work.\nPreparing oocyte collection and maturation media (Day -1)\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nThis step helps the user ensure their medium needed for oocyte collection and maturation are properly warmed and equilibrated for use upon ovary arrival for cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) collections. All media preparation needs to be done with aseptic technique within a laminar flow hood.\nTwo hours before use, warm pre-made oocyte collection media in a water bath set to 38.5\u00b0C.\nMinimally two hours before use, oocyte maturation media needs to be plated and equilibrated. Two options exist (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Maturation plate and dish options\n(A) The 4-well Nunc\u2122 plate maturation option. Each well of the 4-well Nunc\u2122 plate is filled with 500\u00a0\u03bcL of oocyte-maturation media (OMM) and covered in oil. Next to it is a 35\u00a0mm petri dish filled halfway with OMM and covered in oil, which will serve as the \u2018wash\u2019 dish.(B) The 60\u00a0mm petri dish maturation option. Each micro-drop of the 60\u00a0mm petri dish is 50\u00a0\u03bcL of oocyte-maturation media (OMM) and covered in oil. Next to it is a 35\u00a0mm petri dish filled halfway with OMM and covered in oil, which will serve as the \u2018wash\u2019 dish.\nOption 1:\nUsing 4-well Nunc\u2122 plates, sterilely add 500\u00a0\u03bcL oocyte maturation media (OMM) into the desired number of wells.\nCompletely cover each well with mineral oil using a transfer pipette.\nTransfer OMM Nunc\u2122 plate(s) to a humidified incubator set at 38.5\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\nNote: In option 1, each well can hold and mature 20-35 COCs; although 25-30 is preferred.\nOption 2:\nUsing a 60\u00a0mm petri dish, sterilely add 50\u00a0\u03bcL drops of OMM for desired number of times.\nAdd mineral oil using a transfer pipette to the petri dish until each drop is fully covered.\nTransfer OMM petri dish(es) to a humidified incubator set at 38.5\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\nNote: In option 2, each micro-drop can hold and mature 10 COCs.\nMinimally two hours before use, plate and equilibrate wash dishes containing OMM.\nUsing 35\u00a0mm petri dish(es), sterilely add \u223c3\u00a0mL of OMM using a transfer pipette.\nCompletely cover each dish with mineral oil using a transfer pipette.\nTransfer OMM wash dish(es) to a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator set at 38.5\u00b0C.\nNote: It is recommended to use one wash dish per 400 or fewer COCs.\nNote: Media can be equilibrated 12\u201316\u00a0h without apparent issues; however, we would not recommend extending the equilibration time too far as to conserve the antimicrobial activities of the antibiotic within these media.\nProcessing abattoir-derived ovaries (Day -1)\nTiming: 10\u00a0minThis step helps rid the ovaries of any blood and contaminants that could interfere with the in\u00a0vitro embryo production process. This should be done at the abattoir immediately after ovary collection and before transportation back to the laboratory.\nOnce the desired number of ovaries have been collected from an abattoir, they need to be rinsed and strained using one of the 2\u00a0L PYREX glass bottles containing 0.9% sodium chloride with 1\u00d7 ABAM.\nTo do this, place unwashed ovaries into a strainer and pour an entire 2\u00a0L of 0.9% sodium chloride with 1\u00d7 ABAM over them.\nNote: If there are too many ovaries that are unable to fit in the strainer at one time, the process of straining and rinsing may be done in multiple groups separately.\nNote: Since the dirty rinsed material will be discarded, it does not matter where the user decides to strain their ovaries (over grass, into a separate bucket, etc.).\nNote: To determine the desired number of ovaries that need collected depends on several factors. The ovaries received are of unknown quality as they are collected and distributed at random off of the kill-floor; however, we have estimated that around a third of ovaries received are of \u2018good\u2019 quality, a third are of \u2018medium\u2019 quality, and the last third are \u2018low\u2019 quality. While this provides a good estimate, quality and numbers of ovaries per quality category can vary from collection to collection.Our laboratory generally considers ovaries with \u2265 10 antral follicles, 6\u201310 antral follicles, and \u2264 5 antral follicles as high, medium, and low quality, respectively. Other quality factors such as ovary color and size of follicles are also assessed with off-colored ovaries (brown or yellow) and small follicles \u2264 2\u00a0mm considered as low quality. We expect each \u2018good\u2019 ovary to yield \u223c10 COCs, sometimes more. We are unaware of any data to suggest that number of antral follicles per ovary corresponds to greater quality of COCs. However, by selecting ovaries with the most follicles, and therefore most COCs, users can spend less total time \u2018slashing\u2019 ovaries. This is not only more efficient, but getting COCs into an incubator faster can only be positive to their maturation and development.\nPlace rinsed ovaries directly into the bottom of the insulated cooler.\nPour the remaining 2\u00a0L PYREX glass bottle containing 0.9% sodium chloride with ABAM on top of the ovaries to submerge and prevent them from drying out.\nTransport the insulated cooler containing rinsed and submerged ovaries back to the laboratory.\nNote: Reminder, we recommend storing the cooler at 15\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C within the main compartment of the vehicle when transporting ovaries as to not expose them to extreme temperatures (cold or hot). Although, we would recommend that each individual lab should assess if 15\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C is the best ovary storage condition for them and their needs.\nOvary arrival and sorting (Day -1)\nTiming: 15\u201330\u00a0min\nThis step helps to select ovaries of the highest quality, which are anticipated to yield greater numbers of COCs. The time of 15-30\u00a0min given for this step is an estimate; the exact timing will depend on the total number of ovaries being sorted and how many people are helping.Set out three reusable polypropylene low-form graduated beakers to sort ovaries into three main categories based on quality: high, medium, or low.\nSort the ovaries into their respective quality beakers (high, medium, or low; Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Cow ovaries of various quality\nOvaries are of high, medium, and low quality from left to right, respectively.\nNote: See Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for examples of ovary quality.\nNote: Reminder, ovaries with \u2265 10 antral follicles, 6\u201310 antral follicles, and \u2264 5 antral follicles are considered high, medium, and low quality, respectively.\nNote: Reminder, \u2018good\u2019 ovaries are expected to yield \u223c10 COCs, sometimes more.\nAfter the highest quality ovaries are sorted, count individual ovaries until desired amount is reached and placed into individual reusable polypropylene low-form graduated beakers for each user.\nPour new 0.9% sodium chloride with 1\u00d7 ABAM on top of ovaries until they are submerged.\nOnce submerged, gently massage the ovaries and drain the liquid down the sink to further rid them of blood and contaminants.\nRepeat this step until the saline and antibiotic solution remains clear after massaging.\nNote: In general, our laboratory finds 3\u20134 rounds of massage and rinses to be sufficient.\nOnce finished rinsing, add enough saline and antibiotic solution to each user(s) polypropylene low-form graduated beaker to fully submerge ovaries to prevent them from drying out.\nCumulus-oocyte complex (COC) collection and maturation (Day -1)\nTiming: 2\u20134 h\nThis step accomplishes selecting the highest quality of immature oocytes that will be matured in order to create embryos later on in this protocol. The exact time will depend on total number of COCs needing to be matured and the number of people assisting.\nPrepare a slashing station: 1 absorbent underpad, scissors, scalpel handle and blades, a 250\u00a0mL beaker, and a hemostat.Immediately before slashing, add 75\u00a0mL oocyte collection media (OCM) to each beaker and place one at each slashing station (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. A slashing station\nA slashing station is complete with one absorbent underpad, scissors, scalpel handle and blades, a 250\u00a0mL beaker filled with 75\u00a0mL of OCM, and a hemostat.\nNote: Our laboratory generally follows the guidelines of 10\u201315 ovaries per 75\u00a0mL OCM.\nCarefully attach a scalpel blade onto the scalpel handle.\nUsing a hemostat, clamp the utero-ovarian ligament so that the ovary is held tightly.\nTrim away excess utero-ovarian ligament with scissors (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04.

A user uses a scalpel handle with blade to make an \u2018X\u2019 incision over a follicle on the ovary.\n(C) Ovary with all follicles \u2018slashed\u2019.\nIf there are any large follicles (\u2265 8\u00a0mm), rupture them off to the side over the absorbent underpad making sure to avoid getting the follicular fluid in the OCM beaker as larger follicles are more prone to cause clotting in the OCM media.\nBegin \u2018slashing\u2019 any visible (antral) follicles \u02c28\u00a0mm over top of the OCM filled beaker by scalpel with a scalpel blade attached (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: This can be done by making an \u2018X\u2019 incision over each follicle (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).Note: If the user prefers, they can make several horizontal slashes into the ovary and then come back and do several vertical slashes like a \u2018checkerboard\u2019. The \u2018checkerboard\u2019 slashing technique can be useful by saving time if there are a large number of follicles present on the ovary instead of paying individual attention to each follicle by the single \u2018X\u2019 method.\nCritical: Avoid slashing highly vascularized parts of the ovary or slash shallower to prevent bleeding as it can cause media clotting.\nOnce each follicle has been slashed, submerge the slashed ovary still attached to the hemostat into the OCM beaker and swirl intensely.\nOnce swirled, scrape all sides of the ovary up against the inside of the beaker.\nRepeat this process for each ovary making sure to switch out scalpel blades whenever too much resistance is felt due to a dulling blade.\nAfter slashing, transport the beaker containing COCs to a filtering station: 1 absorbent underpad, a tube rack capable of holding (2) 50\u00a0mL conical tubes, transfer pipette, search plate, and 100\u00a0\u03bcM strainer (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05.

In(1) 15\u00a0mL conical tube, add 4\u00a0mL BoviPure and 6\u00a0mL BoviDilute to make a 40% solution. We use serological pipettes for this task.\nWrap each cap in parafilm and set in a 38.5\u00b0C water bath.\nFor the fertilization plates or dishes, two options exist:Option 1: fertilize COCs in a 35\u00a0mm petri dish filled with 2.8\u00a0mL SOF-FERT covered in oil. One may fertilize 120\u2013200 COCs per 2.8\u00a0mL SOF-FERT dish. Once made, place dishes in a humidified 38.5\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator.\nOption 2: fertilize COCs in a 4-well Nunc\u2122 plate with 500\u00a0\u03bcL SOF-FERT covered in oil for each well in use. One may fertilize 20\u201350 COCs per 500\u00a0\u03bcL SOF-FERT well. Once made, place plates in a humidified 38.5\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator.\nFor COC fertilization washes: Two SOF-FERT wash dishes should be made for each \u2018set\u2019 (400 COCs or fewer) of COCs that the user is working with.\nTo make, fill (2) 35\u00a0mm petri dishes halfway with SOF-FERT media using a transfer pipette.\nDo not cover these in oil.\nOnce made, place dishes in a humidified 38.5\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator.\nFor the sperm pellet wash: In(1) 15\u00a0mL conical tube, add 8\u201310\u00a0mL of SOF-FERT using a serological pipette.\nOnce prepared, place the conical tube in its stand and place into a humidified 38.5\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator with its cap off for gas exchange to equilibrate.\nFor the HEPES-SOF wash: In(1) 15\u00a0mL conical tube, add 12\u00a0mL HEPES-SOF per one set of COCs (\u2264400) using a serological pipette.\nWrap the cap(s) in parafilm and set in a 38.5\u00b0C water bath.\nNote: While not required, our lab likes to use parafilm here as a protective barrier between water bath and media should the water bath contain contaminants such as bacteria.\nNote: If processing more COCs (>400), simply prepare more fertilization washes and/or plates and another 15\u00a0mL conical tube filled with 12\u00a0mL HEPES-SOF.\nPreparing for IVF (Day 0)\nTiming: 15\u00a0minThis step helps the user ensure they have all materials ready for use during the IVF process. It is pivotal to adhere to the time constraints detailed in this section; therefore, setting up for the entirety of the IVF process prior to beginning is instrumental to its success.\nTurn on microscope warmers.\nNote: Our lab uses the Nikon SMZ800N stereomicroscope for COC processing and an entry level research grade inverted microscope (FisherBrand, catalog number 03-000-013) for sperm counting. The inverted microscope does not need warmed since sperm on hemocytometer are dead and discarded after counting.\nFill Citothaw with water and plug-in to warm.\nCritical: The Citothaw must warm to and remain at 95\u00b0\u201398\u00b0F for proper semen thawing.\nTurn on centrifuge and preheat it to 37\u00b0C.\nNote: In addition to being heated, the centrifuge needs the capacity to hold 15\u00a0mL conical tubes.\nWipe down all countertops, tables, microscopes, and plate warmers with 70% ethanol.\nOn the countertop, set out: P1000 pipette with corresponding filtered tips, P200 pipette with corresponding filtered tips, P20 pipette with corresponding filtered tips, several transfer pipettes, (1) 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube, hemocytometer, scissors, (1) 50\u00a0mL conical tube, (1) 15\u00a0mL conical tube, and two conical tube stands (one for the 40/80% sperm gradient tubes, and one for holding the empty 50 and 15\u00a0mL conical tubes needed to collect semen and pelleted sperm, respectively).\nSet (3) empty 35\u00a0mm petri dishes on the plate warmer.\nRemove (1) 15\u00a0mL conical tube of HEPES-SOF from the water bath and wipe down with 70% ethanol.\nUsing a transfer pipette, fill each 35\u00a0mm petri dish halfway with HEPES-SOF from this conical tube.\nPlace (1) 70\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer in the first HEPES-SOF 35\u00a0mm petri dish.\nProceed directly to the next major step, IVF (Day 0).IVF (Day 0)\nTiming: 1\u00a0h and 15\u00a0min\nThis step accomplishes fertilizing COCs in order to produce zygotes.\nNote: The IVF process begins by handling the semen. During its first centrifugation is when the user will have time to process the COCs.\nRemove the (2) 80% and (1) 40% BoviPure/BoviDilute tubes from the water bath and wipe down with 70% ethanol.\nCritical: Carefully handle the tubes containing the layered gradient to prevent mixing of the layers to maintain their integrity.\nAfter they are wiped down, they can be placed in a conical tube stand.\nTo create the 40/80% gradient, very slowly layer 5\u00a0mL of the 40% solution on top of the first 80% tube using a transfer pipette.\nCritical: It is very important to layer the gradient slowly or else the user risks mixing the gradients which can impair its function of separating normal purified sperm from dead or abnormal sperm.\nRepeat the same process for the remaining 80% tube.\nNote: The end result is (2) 15\u00a0mL conical tubes each filled with 10\u00a0mL of media: the top 5\u00a0mL are of 40% solution and the bottom 5\u00a0mL are of 80% solution.\nNote: If using less than 4 straws of semen, it is recommended to put all semen into(1) 40/80% tube to increase visibility of the resulting sperm pellet since it will be small in size.\nWhen gradients have been prepared, set them back into the water bath to remain warm.\nProceed to the liquid nitrogen tank with a warmed Citothaw (set to 37\u00b0C) to thaw straw(s) of semen.\nQuickly remove the desired amount of semen straws needed to fertilize COCs and immediately place into the Citothaw to thaw for 45 s.Note: The desired number of straws will depend on number of COCs needing fertilized and how many spermatozoa are loaded into individual straws. The latter number is bull dependent determined and set by the semen company.\nRemove the thawed straws of semen and wipe down with 70% ethanol.\nCritical: Make sure the semen straws and the user\u2019s gloves are completely dry as water and ethanol will kill sperm.\nOnce everything is dry, cut the tip end of the straw(s) with scissors and move straw(s) over the top of an opened 50\u00a0mL conical tube.\nNext, cut the other end of the straw(s) under the cotton plug to expel their contents into the 50\u00a0mL conical tube.\nGently flick the straws against the sides of the 50\u00a0mL conical tube to ensure all contents are expelled.\nNow, hold the conical tube containing semen and extender in the user\u2019s hand to keep it warm and decrease the likelihood of cold shock.\nQuickly, but gently, remove the (2) 40/80% gradient tubes out of the water bath, wipe down with 70% ethanol, and set them in a conical tube rack.\nUsing a transfer pipette, slowly aspirate up the semen and extender and slowly deposit it equally across the tops of both gradient tubes (or one gradient tube is using less semen) (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig9.jpg\nFigure\u00a09. Before and after centrifuging semen\n(A) Semen on top of a gradient. The right 15\u00a0mL conical tube contains the warmed 40/80% gradient where bull semen (5 straws worth) has been thawed at appropriate temperature and carefully layered on top of the gradient. The left 15\u00a0mL conical tube contains water that will be used as the balance for the other tube. At this point, these tubes are ready to begin the first centrifugation.(B) A visible sperm pellet after the first centrifuge spin. Live sperm has migrated down the 15\u00a0mL conical tube to form a pellet after the 25-min centrifugation.\nNote: Ensure that the final volume in each tube is identical before centrifugation for balancing purposes.\nGently place each gradient with semen and extender across from each other in the centrifuge for balancing.\nCentrifuge at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 25\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C.\nOptional: Set a timer for 24\u00a0min and ensure completion of COC processing before centrifugation finishes.\nAs the semen is centrifuging, remove matured COCs from the incubator.\nNote: We recommend that the user takes note of how their COCs visually appear post-maturation at this exact point. If maturation was successful, the cumulus cells should have grown and expanded to where they appear much larger and \u2018fluffy\u2019 than before maturation (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). If the COCs have poor cumulus expansion, it is recommended to take note of this but continue processing them regardless as some will still develop into a blastocyst. This visual assessment and recording will be useful when trying to explain or troubleshoot any reasons for poor blastocyst rates if improper expansion was to occur.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig10.jpg\nFigure\u00a010. Representative image of mature COCs\nA microscopic view of COCs after successful maturation in OMM for 23\u201324 h. The cumulus cells have expanded in size and acquire a \u2018fluffy\u2019 appearance.\nThe scale bar represents 670 \u03bcm.\nUsing a P200 set to 200\u00a0\u03bcL, move COCs using gel-loading tips from their maturation plates into the center of a 70\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer within the first HEPES-SOF wash.\nNote: The outside of the gel-loading tip needs to be wiped with a Kimwipe to remove oil before depositing COCs into the cell strainer.After the COCs are dispensed into the cell strainer in the first HEPES-SOF wash, gently swirl them around to wash.\nOnce swirled, move the filter into the second HEPES-SOF wash and swirl again.\nRepeat this for third and final HEPES-SOF wash.\nWhen the filter with COCs is in the last HEPES-SOF wash, remove the (2) 35\u00a0mm SOF-FERT wash dishes out of the incubator and place onto the plate warmer.\nMove the filter from HEPES-SOF into the first SOF-FERT wash, swirl, and repeat for the second and final SOF-FERT wash.\nOnce the filter with COCs is in the last SOF-FERT wash, remove the final IVF plate(s) or dish(es) (4-well Nunc\u2122 or 35\u00a0mm dish, respectively) from the incubator.\nUsing a P200 set to 200\u00a0\u03bcL with gel-loading tip, pipette up desired number of COCs and transfer into 35\u00a0mm petri dish(es) for IVF, if using.\nNote: The final volume in this dish will now be 3\u00a0mL.\nAlternatively, if using a 4-well Nunc\u2122 for IVF, it is recommended to transfer COCs into each 500\u00a0\u03bcL in as little volume as possible to keep the final volume as close to 500\u00a0\u03bcL/well.\nWhen finished plating, return IVF plate(s) or dish(es) into the humidified 38.5\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: When sperm is ready, it will be directly added into these plates at a final concentration of 1 million sperm/ 1\u00a0mL of fertilization media.\nNote: At this point, sperm centrifugation should be close to being complete. If time allows, the user can clean up their microscope plates and dispose of used plates, dishes, tips, and strainer(s). It is important to remove tubes from the centrifuge as soon as it finishes or else there is risk of sperm migrating up from the pellet.Gently remove the (2) 15\u00a0mL conical tubes containing sperm to a conical tube rack.\nCritical: A visible sperm pellet at the bottom of the conical tubes must be observed (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). The user must aspirate the sperm pellet and transfer into a new 15\u00a0mL conical tube. If a sperm pellet is not observed, the user likely needs to start the entire process again as there likely will not be enough viable sperm to perform fertilization.\nTo aspirate the sperm pellet, use a transfer pipette to pick up the sperm pellet from the bottom, collecting as little excess of BoviPure/BoviDilute as possible, and release it into a new 15\u00a0mL conical tube.\nRepeat for the remaining tube (if using) containing the other sperm pellet and combine into the same 15\u00a0mL conical tube used in the previous step.\nOnce the sperm pellet(s) have been isolated into a new 15\u00a0mL conical, wash it by adding 7\u20139\u00a0mL of SOF-FERT from the SOF-FERT tube that has been equilibrated in the incubator to the 15\u00a0mL conical tube containing the isolated sperm pellet(s).\nMix the SOF-FERT and sperm pellet gently by doing a soft inversion twice to combine.\nCritical: Leave at least 1\u00a0mL of SOF-FERT behind and return to the incubator because SOF-FERT is used to dilute sperm if the concentration determined by the hemocytometer is excessive.\nCentrifuge the washed sperm pellet for 5\u00a0min at 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g at 37\u00b0C.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully remove the tube containing the sperm pellet.\nTo isolate the sperm pellet, use a transfer pipette to slowly aspirate off the supernatant down to the 2\u00a0mL mark.\nOnce at 2\u00a0mL, switch to a P1000 set to 1,000\u00a0\u03bcL for better hand control to decrease the likelihood of disrupting the pellet.Note: If the sperm pellet moves or is no longer visible, re-centrifuge at the same parameters above.\nPipette off excess liquid off the top using the P1000 pipette until you have about 100\u00a0\u03bcL of SOF-FERT remaining on top of the sperm pellet.\nAgitate the tube to mix.\nDetermine sperm concentration using a hemocytometer.\nNote: Our lab reads the hemocytometer with sperm on an entry level research grade inverted microscope (FisherBrand, catalog number 03-000-013).\nNote: A 1:10 dilution of sperm to water may be helpful prior to loading the hemocytometer. Using water as the diluent is important to kill sperm in order to immobilize them to provide an accurate cell count. Other dilutions may be used; the exact dilution will depend on sperm per straw (bull and semen company dependent). Regardless, any dilution used will need factored into the calculation for determining sperm concentration.\nOnce the concentration has been determined, add sperm to the plate or dish containing fertilization media and COCs at a final concentration of 1 million sperm/1\u00a0mL fertilization media.\nNote: As an example, if a user has a fertilization dish with 2.8\u00a0mL of fertilization media, the user would use a P200 pipette set to 200\u00a0\u03bcL and collect all COCs that will be fertilized in that dish within that volume. Therefore, the final volume of the dish would now be 3\u00a0mL. Therefore, it would require 3 million sperm in order to achieve the final concentration of 1 million sperm/1\u00a0mL fertilization media.\nOnce sperm is added into IVF dishes, it is recommended to zoom in on the microscope to visualize sperm motility to get an idea of technical success.\nNote: Our lab uses the Nikon SMZ800N stereomicroscope for COC work and visualizing sperm motility.After adding sperm into the dishes containing COCs, move all IVF dishes into a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set at 38.5\u00b0C and incubate for 16\u201322 h.\nPreparing culture plates, HEPES-SOF, and hypoxia chamber (Day 0 or 1)\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nThis step helps the user ensure their medium needed for embryo culture are properly warmed and equilibrated for use.\nNote: If using a hypoxia chamber, it needs prepared the evening prior (Day 0) to IVC (Day 1). A hypoxia chamber should be used and prepared the evening prior if the lab does not have access to an incubator flowing with tri-gas (5% CO2 and O2 and 90% N2). However, if entire incubator(s) exist with tri-gas, users do not need to use a hypoxia chamber since its function is to serve as a tri-gas containment vessel.\nTo clean a hypoxia chamber, thoroughly spray it with 70% ethanol, and let air dry overnight in a clean space.\nNote: If using an incubator filled with tri-gas (5% CO2 and O2 and 90% N2), you can bypass the above step.\nAt least two hours before culturing, prepare culture washes, final culture plates, and HEPES-SOF wash.\nFor culture plates:\nUsing 4-well Nunc\u2122 plates, sterilely add a 50\u00a0\u03bcL drop of SOF-BE1 into the center of each well.\nCompletely cover each drop with mineral oil using a transfer pipette.\nTransfer the 4-well Nunc\u2122 culture plate(s) to a humidified incubator or chamber set at 38.5\u00b0C filled with 5% CO2.Note: Each 50 \u00b5L culture drop can hold and culture 20\u201330 embryos; preferably 25 per drop. We have noticed that development can be decreased when culturing less than 20 embryos in a 50 \u00b5L drop of SOF-BE1. In theory, a user may be able to culture 15\u201319 embryos in a drop if drop size is changed accordingly. We would not suggest testing fewer numbers like individual culture since embryos thrive growing in groups for exchanging beneficial factors to one another. However, we have not tested this enough to suggest it as a viable option. Each lab should do a few replicates of testing out lower group sizes if they want to adopt that option.\nNote: Our laboratory likes to use 4-well Nunc\u2122 plates for embryo culture because each well will contain a single culture drop. Therefore, if contamination were to occur, it may just affect a single drop contained within a single well rather than the entire plate. For example, if culturing in a 35 mm petri dish containing multiple culture drops, contamination may be more likely to affect the entire plate since there is no separation boundary of individual wells.\nFor culture washes:\nUsing two 35\u00a0mm petri dishes, sterilely add \u223c3\u00a0mL of SOF-BE1 using a transfer pipette to create two SOF-BE1 wash plates, which are recommended per 400 or fewer presumptive zygotes being cultured.\nCompletely cover one of the two SOF-BE1 wash dishes with mineral oil using a transfer pipette.\nRepeat making additional sets of wash dishes if needed.\nTransfer culture washes of SOF-BE1 to a humidified incubator or chamber set at 38.5\u00b0C filled with5% CO2.\nFor HEPES-SOF washes:\nUsing a serological pipette, sterilely add 12\u00a0mL of HEPES-SOF to a 15\u00a0mL conical tube.Wrap each conical tube cap with parafilm and place in a 38.5\u00b0C water bath until use at IVC.\nNote: While not required, our lab likes to use parafilm here as a protective barrier between water bath and media should the water bath contain contaminants such as bacteria.\nNote: It is recommended to use 12\u00a0mL HEPES-SOF per 400 or fewer presumptive zygotes.\nIVC (Day 1)\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\u20131\u00a0h and 30\u00a0min\nThis step accomplishes denuding presumptive zygotes, and transferring them into culture media. The exact time will depend on how many presumptive zygotes the user is handling, and how experienced they are as more experienced users will be faster at this process.\nNote: At time of IVC, the user will 1) remove a 15\u00a0mL HEPES-SOF conical tube from the water bath and disinfect it using 70% ethanol, 2) use a transfer pipette to add \u223c3\u00a0mL pre-warmed HEPES-SOF into three, new 35\u00a0mm petri dishes placed on a plate warmer, and 3) add a 70\u00a0\u03bcM strainer into the second HEPES-SOF wash.\nRemove fertilization plates containing presumptive zygotes from the incubator onto the warmer of the microscope or nearby plate warmer.\nNote: If using 35\u00a0mm fertilization dishes, gently swirl the dish to try to group the presumptive zygotes close together in the middle of the dish for easier collection and pipetting.\nUsing a P200 set to 200\u00a0\u03bcL with gel-loading pipette tips, aspirate up all presumptive zygotes.\nUse a Kimwipe to wipe the outside of the pipette tip to remove oil that originated from the fertilization plate or dish.\nOnce wiped, release presumptive zygotes into the first 35\u00a0mm dish containing HEPES-SOF and no strainer.Note: If the user was unable to gather all presumptive zygotes in the first aspiration, this process may be repeated; although, it is best to minimize the addition of extra SOF-FERT into the HEPES-SOF dish for pH stability of the media.\nAfter the presumptive zygotes are dispensed into the first HEPES-SOF wash, gently swirl them around to wash and to collect them tightly into the center of the dish for easier pipetting.\nNext, denude (remove cumulus cells; see note) presumptive zygotes from the first HEPES-SOF wash dish.\nTo denude, set a P200 pipette to 180\u00a0\u03bcL with a gel-loading tip attached.\nAspirate up all presumptive zygotes in 180\u00a0\u03bcL of volume and dispense into a sterile, 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube.\nIf repeat pipetting: reset the P200 pipette to 150\u00a0\u03bcL. Set a timer for 4\u00a0min and proceed to repeatedly pipette up and down continuously.\nIf vortexing: close the tube lid and vortex the 1.5\u00a0mL microcentrifuge tube containing presumptive zygotes for 5\u00a0min.Note: Two mechanical options exist for denuding which is dependent upon personal preference: repeat pipetting or vortexing. Both denuding methods have positives and negatives. Some users opt to use the vortex method for denuding because it takes less technical skill. For instance, to repeatedly pipette up and down, the user has to determine 1) the speed at which to pipette up and down continuously, and 2) the force of each pipette motion. Too slow or soft will result in minimal cumulus cell removal whereas too fast and hard can result in breaking the zona pellucida, which effectively compromises the zygote making it unusable. Those two main factors are issues that the user will have to perfect by trial and error in order to get the correct feel for timing and force required to completely denude but still keep the zona pellucida intact. Furthermore, repeatedly pipetting requires that the user pay close attention to prevent the pipette tip from hitting the bottom of the tube and crushing zygotes. However, negatives of denuding by the vortex method exist. These include 1) displacement of the HEPES-SOF containing the presumptive zygotes up higher above the undisturbed media level, so there is greater chance of losing zygotes that were displaced above this level, and 2) little ability for optimization.\nCritical: Failure to denude in a hepes-buffered media with a surfactant such as BSA can cause 1) clotting and 2) pH destabilization of media which can negatively affect the presumptive zygote.\nCritical: Care must be taken to not create bubbles nor crush the presumptive zygotes during denuding and recovery.\nTo recover denuded presumptive zygotes from the 1.5\u00a0mL centrifuge tube, reset the P200 pipette to 180\u00a0\u03bcL with a gel-loading tip attached.\nAspirate up all media containing presumptive zygotes.Critical: Caution should be taken to prevent the tip from hitting the bottom of the tube to prevent crushing of presumptive zygotes.\nNote: The 1.5\u00a0mL centrifuge tube used for denuding can be rinsed a couple times with additional HEPES-SOF in effort to recover more presumptive zygotes that may not have been collected from the first aspiration.\nRelease the denuded, presumptive zygotes into the center of a 70\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer in the second 35\u00a0mm petri dish containing HEPES-SOF and swirl to wash.\nOnce swirled, move the strainer into the third and final HEPES-SOF wash and swirl again to wash.\nOnce the strainer with denuded presumptive zygotes is in the final HEPES-SOF wash, remove the (2) 35\u00a0mm SOF-BEI petri dishes (one has oil overlayed on top and one has no oil) out of the incubator and onto the plate warmer.\nMove the strainer from HEPES-SOF into the first SOF-BEI dish that does not contain oil and swirl to wash.\nOnce washed, using a P200 pipette set to 200\u00a0\u03bcL with gel-loading tip attached, aspirate up all denuded, presumptive zygotes and dispense underneath the oil of the second 35\u00a0mm dish containing SOF-BE1.\nNow, switch to using a Captrol (or other similar devices: Drummond\u2122 Wiretrol\u2122, The STRIPPER\u00ae or mouth pipette) with a hand-pulled Captrol tip attached.\nFrom the last SOF-BE1 petri dish containing oil, aspirate up 20\u201330 presumptive zygotes and dispense into 50\u00a0\u03bcL culture drops of a 4-well Nunc\u2122 plate.\nRepeat until all adequate quality (i.e., homogenous ooplasm, symmetrical, and dark in color) presumptive zygotes have been plated into culture drops.\nOnce a 4-well Nunc\u2122 plate has been filled, place it into a humidified incubator or hypoxia chamber containing tri-gas at 38.5\u00b0C.Critical: Our protocol requires that cow zygotes and embryos must be cultured in tri-gas (5% CO2 and O2 and 90% N2) in a humidified environment at 38.5\u00b0C.\nIncubate embryos until desired endpoint or at specific stages to evaluate development (i.e., day 2 post-IVF for cleavage, day 7 post-IVF for day 7 blastocysts, and day 8 post-IVF for day 8 blastocysts).\nNote: Bovine embryos are generally not cultured past day 8 post-IVF.\nCleavage assessment (Day 2)\nTiming: 15\u201330\u00a0min\nThis step accomplishes determining the success rate of fertilization. Embryos will only cleave (not including parthenogenic embryos) if they were fertilized. Cleavage is mandatory for progression of embryonic development to the blastocyst stage and beyond.\nTurn on microscope warmers.\nNote: Either the stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ800N) or inverted microscope (FisherBrand 03-000-013) that we mentioned will work for assessing cleavage; however, the inverted microscope can zoom in more if desired.\nWipe down all tables, microscopes, and plate warmers with 70% ethanol.\nIn a lab notebook, record 1) how many presumptive zygotes were cultured, 2) how many did not cleave and remained as a 1-cell (unfertilized), and 3) how many cleaved at least to the 2-cell stage.\nNote: See Figure\u00a011[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11] for representative development and cleavage of bovine embryos at day 2 post IVF.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig11.jpg\nFigure\u00a011. Representative image of bovine embryos at cleavage assessment\nA microscopic view of twenty bovine embryos in a 50\u00a0\u03bcL drop of SOF-BE1 for culture. This image was taken at day 2 post IVF. All but one embryo has cleaved at least the first time (i.e., at the 2-cell stage or beyond). A red arrow is pointing to an unfertilized oocyte (UFO).\nThe scale bar represents 270 \u03bcm.\nTo determine the cleavage rate, divide number of embryos that cleaved over the total number of presumptive zygotes cultured.Note: If the cleavage rate is <70%, there is likely room for improvement. Please see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section at the end of this protocol for more tips on how to increase it. Lastly, be aware of our protocol limitations (season and training); please see the limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section below for more detail.\nBlastocyst assessment (Day 7 and 8)\nTiming: 15\u201330\u00a0min\nThis step accomplishes determining the success rate of generating a blastocyst. Blastulation is a mandatory event in the progression of embryonic development and eventual live birth.\nTurn on microscope warmers.\nNote: Either the stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ800N) or inverted microscope (FisherBrand 03-000-013) that we mentioned will work for assessing blastulation; however, the inverted microscope can zoom in more if desired.\nWipe down all tables, microscopes, and plate warmers with 70% ethanol.\nIn a lab notebook, record how many cleaved embryos progressed into a blastocyst.\nNote: A key feature of a blastocyst is the presence of the blastocoel cavity. This can be further broken down by staging the blastocyst (i.e., regular blastocyst, expanded blastocyst, hatching or hatched blastocyst). See Figure\u00a012[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12] for examples of different blastocyst stages.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2263-Fig12.jpg\nFigure\u00a012.

It is classified as an \u2018expanded\u2019 blastocyst because there is a blastocoel cavity present, and it has expanded to where pressure is pushing against the ZP making it appear \u2018thinned\u2019.\n(C) A \u2018hatching-stage\u2019 bovine blastocyst. A microscopic view of a bovine embryo that has progressed into a hatching blastocyst at day 8 post IVF. It is classified as a \u2018hatching\u2019 blastocyst because there is a blastocoel cavity present, and it is beginning to hatch out of its ZP.\nThe scale bar represents 130 \u03bcm.\nTo determine the blastocyst rate, divide the number of blastocysts over the total number of presumptive zygotes cultured.\nNote: If the blastocyst rate on day 8 post IVF is <20%, there is likely room for improvement. Please see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section at the end of this protocol for more tips on how to increase it. Lastly, be aware of our protocol limitations (season and training); please see the limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section below for more detail.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBreeding of experimental MADM mice for the generation of genetic mosaic tissue\nTiming: 4\u20137\u00a0months\nIn order to generate genetic mosaic mice, you can either chose a breeding strategy maximizing the efficiency of experimental MADM animal output (here called \u201cstrategy 1\u201d) or a breeding strategy maximizing the speed of obtaining experimental MADM animals (here called \u201cstrategy 2\u201d) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). We provide an estimated amount of breeding mice required to obtain a realistic number of experimental MADM animals (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). We provide step-by-step breeding guidance in the following section of this protocol (also see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]):\nFor both breeding strategies, perform Breeding step 1 for gene-X of interest: In order to link the mutation of gene-X to the MADM TG cassette, cross MADMTG/TG animals with a mouse line mutant for gene-X (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(i) and 2C(i)). The resulting F1 generation will be trans-heterozygous for the MADM TG cassette and the mutation of interest (genotype will be MADMTG/+; gene-X+/-).\nFor both breeding strategies, perform Breeding step 1 for the Cre driver (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(iii) and 2C(ii)): cross MADMGT/GT animals with a Cre driver of choice. The resulting F1 generation will be double heterozygous for the MADM GT cassette and the Cre driver specific for the cell type of interest (MADMGT/+; Cre+/-). Perform this step in parallel to the above step.\nAllow F1 generation mice to grow up to 8\u00a0weeks of age. For breeding strategy 2, proceed to step 6. For breeding strategy 1, continue with steps 3, 4 and 5.\nFor strategy 1, perform Breeding step 2 for the mutant by crossing MADMTG/+;gene-X+/- mice with MADMTG/TG animals in order to generate F2 offspring homozygous for the MADM TG cassette and meiotically linked gene-X (MADMTG/TG,gene-X) (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(ii)).For strategy 1, perform Breeding step 2 for the Cre driver by intercrossing MADMGT/+; Cre+/- mice with MADMGT/+; Cre+/- animals in order to generate F2 offspring homozygous for the MADM GT cassette and the Cre driver. The resulting genotype will be MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(iv)). Perform this step parallel to step 3.\nAllow F2 generation mice to grow up to 8\u00a0weeks of age.\nFor the generation of experimental MADM animals according to strategy 1, cross MADMTG/TG,gene-X mice with MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ animals in order to generate experimental offspring with genetic mosaic tissue with green mutant, red wild-type and yellow heterozygous cells (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(v)). The genotype of the experimental MADM animals is MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/- (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(v)). The probability to obtain experimental MADM animals from this breeding is 50%. The probability for control-MADM animals is also 50%, i.e., animals with MADM-labelling but without mutation. With an estimated litter size of 10 pups per litter, this means that you require 1 breeding cage to obtain a total of 5 experimental MADM mice (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B(vi)).\nCheck for the vaginal plug to monitor successful mating and to expedite the experimental planning.\nMale and female offspring can be used as experimental animals.\nPerform experiment at developmental stage(s) of choice.\nFor the generation of experimental MADM animals according to strategy 2, cross trans-heterozygous MADMTG/+;gene-X+/-mice directly with double heterozygous MADMGT/+; Cre+/- animals in order to generate experimental MADM offspring with genetic mosaic tissue with green mutant, red wild-type and yellow heterozygous cells (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(iii)). The genotype of the experimental MADM animals is MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/- (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(iii)). The probability to obtain experimental MADM animals from this breeding is \u223c5%. With an estimated litter size of 10 pups per litter, you require \u223c10 breeding cages and \u223c100 pups to obtain a total of 5 experimental MADM mice (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(iv)).Check for the vaginal plug to monitor successful mating and to expedite the experimental planning.\nMale and female offspring can be used as experimental animals.\nPerform experiment at developmental stage(s) of choice.\nNote: In the following examples described in this protocol, all tissue was analyzed at specific postnatal stages. However, experimental animals can also be used at embryonic stages, P0, and any postnatal age depending on your experimental needs.\nIn order to provide a broad overview of applications suitable for histological analysis using MADM in this protocol, we made use of a number of different Cre drivers: (1) constitutively active Emx1-Cre and TM-inducible Emx1-CreER that primarily targets radial glia progenitors in the dorsal forebrain, which give rise to excitatory projection neurons and glial cells in the cerebral cortex (Gorski et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Kessaris et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). (2) We include an example using constitutively active Nestin-Cre and inducible Nestin-CreER (Petersen et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Imayoshi et\u00a0al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), which is a marker of stem cells across the nervous system and therefore results in MADM labeling in all neural cell types including Purkinje cells; (3) and make use of constitutively active Hprt-Cre (Tang et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) which shows ubiquitous spatiotemporal expression. The Hprt-Cre driver was utilized to investigate peripheral organs, in particular the intestine. MADM can also be applied for experiments involving flow cytometry. For details and a step-by-step protocol on the experimental workflow specific for flow cytometry experiments, we refer to (Laukoter et\u00a0al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Specific considerations when breeding experimental MADM animals are provided in the next two sections of the protocol:\nGeneration of experimental MADM mice for postnatal histological analysis in brain\nTiming: 3\u00a0weeks\u201312\u00a0monthsFor population analysis, cross MADMGT/GT; Emx1Cre/Cre or MADMGT/GT; Nestin-Cre+/+ females with MADMTG/TG;gene-X males in order to generate offspring with genetic mosaic brain tissue (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, bottom panel) (also see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]). For clonal analysis, cross MADMGT/GT; Emx1CreER/CreER or MADMGT/GT; Nestin-CreER+/+ females with MADMTG/TG;gene-X males in order to generate offspring with genetic mosaic brain tissue following TM injection at a time point of choice (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, bottom panel) (also see troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]). For simplicity, the above mentioned distinct Cre/ER drivers will be abbreviated as \u201cCre\u201d throughout step 7.\nCheck for the vaginal plug to monitor successful mating and to facilitate the experimental planning.\nMales and females of the resulting F1 generation can be used as experimental animals (genotype will be MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/-).\nNote: Upon crossing MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ females with MADMTG/TG,gene-X males to generate MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/- mosaic animals, green cells harboring a homozygous mutation in gene-X will show uniparental paternal chromosome disomy (patUPD, PP), while red wild-type cells will show uniparental maternal chromosome disomy (matUPD, MM) (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). We refer to this breeding scheme as \u2018default breeding scheme.\u2019\nNote: In order to reverse the fluorescent colors to control for a potential bias of the fluorescent reporter (color swap), couple the mutation to the MADM GT cassette and use MADMTG/TG females and MADMGT/GT,gene-X; Cre+/+ males (Laukoter et\u00a0al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Here, red cells harboring a homozygous mutation in gene-X will show patUPD (PP), while green wild-type cells will show matUPD (MM) (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). For efficient conduction of this control experiment, we recommend to perform the color swap in the context of population analysis using a constitutively active Cre driver and not a TM-inducible CreER.Note: In order to reverse the parents to control for a potential genomic imprinting bias of\u00a0the parental origin of the mutation (parent swap), use MADMTG/TG,gene-X females and MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ males (Laukoter et\u00a0al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) to generate MADMGT/TG,gene-X; Cre+/- mosaic animals. Here, green cells harboring a homozygous mutation in gene-X will show\u00a0matUPD (MM), while red wild-type cells will show patUPD (PP) (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Given\u00a0that the generation of stock lines for your experiments will yield MADMTG/TG,gene-X females and MADMGT/GT; Cre+/+ males in any case, use the opportunity of having these mice\u00a0available and perform the parent swap in parallel to your \u2018default breeding\u2019 setup. For efficient conduction of this control experiment, we recommend to perform it in the context of population analysis using a constitutively active Cre driver and not a TM-inducible CreER.\nPerform experiment at your desired postnatal time point, for example when generation of cell types is completed and the cells have reached a fully developed, mature state (in our examples shown in this protocol we chose time points between P1 and P21).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1163-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Breeding schemes for default setup, color swap, and parent swap\n(A) Schematic showing the default breeding scheme using males where gene-X is meiotically linked to the MADM TG cassette, while females transmit the GT cassette and the Cre driver. Resulting offspring will contain red wild-type cells with uniparental maternal chromosome disomy (matUPD, MM), while green mutant cells will harbor uniparental paternal chromosome disomy (patUDP, PP).\n(B) Schematic of the breeding scheme for a color swap experiment using females homozygous for the MADM TG cassette, while males transmit the Cre driver plus gene-X meiotically linked to the GT cassette. Resulting offspring will have green wild-type cells with matUPD (MM), while red mutant cells will harbor patUPD (PP).(C) Schematic of the breeding scheme for a parent swap experiment using females where gene-X is meiotically linked to the MADM TG cassette, while males transmit the GT cassette and the Cre driver. Resulting offspring will contain red wild-type cells with patUPD (PP), while green mutant cells will harbor matUPD (MM).\nParts of the figure were reproduced and adapted with permission from (Beattie et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nGeneration of experimental MADM mice for postnatal histological analysis of genetic mosaic tissue in peripheral organs\nTiming: 3\u00a0weeks\u201312\u00a0months\nCross MADMGT/GT; HprtCre/+ females with MADMTG/TG,gene-X males in order to generate offspring with genetic mosaic tissues.\nCheck for the vaginal plug to monitor successful mating and to facilitate the experimental planning.\nMales and females of the resulting F1 generation can be used as experimental animals (genotype will be MADMGT/TG,gene-X; HprtCre/+).\nCritical: The Hprt-Cre transgene is located on the X chromosome, with one of the two X chromosomes undergoing random inactivation in females. Thus, Cre activity and MADM labelling are highly variable in MADMGT/TG,gene-X; HprtCre/+ females. We therefore recommend to primarily use males for your analysis in order to obtain reproducible results.\nNote: Upon crossing MADMGT/GT; HprtCre/+ females with MADMTG/TG,gene-X males to generate MADMGT/TG,gene-X; HprtCre/+ mosaic animals, green cells harboring a homozygous mutation in gene-X will show patUPD, while red wild-type cells will show matUPD.\nNote: If desired, perform color swap and parent swap (Laukoter et\u00a0al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) as described in the notes for step 7 of the protocol.\nPerform the experiment at the desired postnatal time point, to e.g., analyze cellular phenotypes arising during development in mature tissue and/or trace disease phenotypes when a disease phenotype is evident (up to several months of age).\nMouse perfusion and dissection for collection of MADM-labelled tissue for histological analysis\nTiming: 12\u201316\u00a0hThis section of the protocol documents the perfusion and dissection of postnatal mice for organ removal and further downstream histological analysis.\nCritical: 4% PFA should be ice-cold and protected from light.\nArrange all solutions and tools required for the tissue collection at the dissection area\nAnesthesia\n1\u00d7 PBS\n4% PFA\nPeristaltic pump or perfusion syringes\nDissection tools\n6-well plates\nCritical: Make sure no air bubbles are trapped in the tubes of the peristaltic pump or within the syringe containing the perfusion buffers. Bubbles may destroy the tissue during the perfusion process. Run the tubes of the pump with PBS prior to starting the perfusion procedure to make sure all air is removed.\nAnesthetize the animal by intraperitoneal injection of anesthesia working solution at a volume of 0.16\u20130.24\u00a0mL/10\u00a0g mouse (equivalent to 400\u2013600\u00a0mg/kg).\nCritical: Mice require deep anesthesia before any further procedure can be applied. Test the efficiency of anesthesia by pinching a paw with forceps. Only when the mouse does not display any movement after pinching, you can proceed with the dissection and perfusion.\nPlace the anesthetized animal in supine position on a perfusion tray and disinfect fur with 70% ethanol.\nBelow the rib cage, make a medial incision with scissors and surgical forceps through the skin and the underlying muscle layer (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Continue to cut laterally.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1163-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Tissue harvesting for histological analysis of experimental MADM mice\n(A\u2013C) Mouse dissection and initiation of perfusion.\n(D\u2013Q) Mouse dissection to isolate and embed brain.\n(R\u2013V) Isolation and embedding of colon.\nLift the tip of the sternum and snip the diaphragm. Then trim the rib cage to expose the heart.\nUsing small iris scissors make an incision to the posterior end of the right atrium for the blood to drain during the following perfusion procedure (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).Insert a needle attached to a peristaltic pump or a syringe filled with 1\u00d7 PBS into the lower left ventricle (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nPerfuse with PBS until the liver turns pale (requires approximately 5\u201310\u00a0mL of PBS).\nOnce complete, switch the perfusion solution to 4% PFA.\nNote: Perfusion requirements need to be adjusted according to the age of the animals. (a) For the perfusion of pups: perfuse manually using 10\u00a0mL syringes. Prepare 2 distinct 10\u00a0mL syringes: one filled with 1\u00d7\u00a0PBS and another filled with 4% PFA. Once perfusion with PBS is completed, replace PBS-containing syringe plus needle with fresh needle and syringe containing PFA through the same puncture hole in the heart. (b) For the perfusion of juvenile and adult mice, use a peristaltic pump. Place one end of the tube of the peristaltic pump into a flask or Falcon tube filled with PBS. After perfusion with PBS (speed: 5\u00a0mL at 2\u20134\u00a0mL/min in juvenile animals; 10\u00a0mL at 4\u20136\u00a0mL/min for adult mice), switch to 4% PFA.\nCritical: briefly stop the peristaltic pump and exchange the PBS solution with ice-cold 4% PFA. This is critical to avoid bubbles in the pump tubing. Resume perfusion with PFA at the same speed.\nRemove mouse from perfusion pad and dissect the organ of interest. If organ of interest is brain, continue to follow the protocol. If organ of interest is a peripheral organ, proceed to step 27.\nDissection of brain:\nDecapitate mouse.\nRemove the skin over the skull (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nCut the skull at the naso-frontal suture (in front of the olfactory bulbs) (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nThen cut along the midline (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F), followed by a cut along the parietal-interparietal sutures.\nLift the skull to the side to expose the brain (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).Place curved forceps or a thin spatula underneath the brain and remove it from the skull (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nCritical: Avoid mechanical damage of brain tissue during the dissection to ensure you obtain intact tissue for high quality analysis.\nTransfer the brain to a well filled with ice-cold 4%PFA in a 6-well plate (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\nIncubate at 4\u00b0C for minimum 10 h.\nNext day, wash 3\u00d7 with 1\u00d7 PBS for 5\u00a0min each.\nTransfer brain to a 15\u00a0mL Falcon tube filled with 10\u00a0mL of 30% Sucrose.\nIncubate at 4\u00b0C until the brain has sunk to the bottom of the Falcon tube.\nRemove brain from sucrose and gently remove residual sugar from the surface of the brain using lint-free tissues.\nDepending on the cell type of interest and the needs of the experiment, embed brain in coronal or sagittal orientation:\nFor coronal orientation (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J), place brain ventral-side down on a piece of lint-free tissue and remove the cerebellum using a razor blade (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K and 4L). Place brain with the caudal side down in an embedding mold (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]M), fill mold and cover tissue with O.C.T. Tissue tek and freeze. Once frozen, store it at \u221280\u00b0C.\nFor sagittal orientation (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]N), place brain ventral-side down on a piece of lint-free tissue and cut it in two halves along the midline using a razor blade (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]O and 4P). Place brain with the medial side down in an embedding mold (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]Q), fill mold and cover tissue with O.C.T. Tissue tek and freeze. Once frozen, store it at \u221280\u00b0C.\nPause point: You can keep the frozen tissue at \u221280\u00b0C until further usage.\nDissection of peripheral organ (this protocol is using the colon as an example):\nRemove colon from the mouse and place it on lint-free tissue.Cut open longitudinally (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]R).\nRemove faeces.\nMake colon into a Swiss roll by using a pipet tip to roll it up (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]S).\nTransfer colon into a histosette (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]T) for further handling.\nIncubate in a beaker filled with 4% PFA for 4\u00a0h at 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]U).\nWash 3\u00d7 with 1\u00d7 PBS for 5\u00a0min each.\nIncubate in 30% Sucrose at 4\u00b0C for minimum 10 h.\nRemove histosette with colon from sucrose, take out colon and gently remove residual sugar from the surface of the organ by using lint-free tissues.\nTransfer colon to an embedding mold, fill mold and cover tissue with O.C.T. Tissue Tek and freeze (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]V). Once frozen, store it at \u221280\u00b0C.\nPause point: You can keep the frozen tissue at \u221280\u00b0C until further usage.\nCritical: Optimal tissue freezing during embedding is achieved when embedding molds are placed on dry ice. Control the tissue during the freezing process from time to time and avoid loss of position within the mold.\nTissue sectioning for histological analysis\nTiming: 30 min\u20133 h\nThis section of the protocol lists details on sectioning MADM-labelled tissue for confocal microscopy.\nRemove tissue from \u221280\u00b0C and transfer to a cryostat cooled to \u221220\u00b0C.\nLet tissue adapt to temperature change for 20\u00a0min.\nRemove tissue block from the embedding mold.\nAttach the tissue block to the specimen disk in the cryostat by applying a drop of OCT to the disk and placing the tissue block directly into the OCT. Allow to freeze for 1\u20132\u00a0min.\nInsert disk with attached tissue block in the sectioning holder by placing the tissue in a correct orientation.Note: For brain sections, insert sectioning disc with cortex facing towards the top. For peripheral organ sections, insert sectioning disc with organ of choice in an orientation that guarantees good sectioning quality for your required analysis.\nStart cutting by trimming the tissue block in 45\u00a0\u03bcm thick sections until the region of interest is reached.\nSlice the tissue in 30\u00a0\u03bcm thick sections. Either collect the slices in individual wells of a 24 well plate (= floating sections) or mount them directly onto frosted glass slides.\nPause point: Floating sections can be kept in PBS at 4\u00b0C for up to 48 h. When longer storage is required, exchange the PBS with cryoprotectant and store at \u221220\u00b0C.\nPause point: Directly mounted sections can be stored in a slide box at \u221220\u00b0C until further usage.\nTissue mounting\nTiming: 15\u00a0min\u20131 h\nThis part of the protocol can be skipped if the sliced tissue is directly mounted onto frosted glass slides in the course of the sectioning process. In that case, immediately proceed to step 45 of the protocol. If you prepared floating sections, continue with step 40.\nFill a Petri dish with PBS-T.\nPlace a frosted glass slide at the edge of the petri dish so that is covered up nearly to the label with PBS-T.\nTransfer all of your desired sections into the dish filled with PBS-T.\nUse a small paint brush to maneuver the sections onto the slide and arrange them side by side.\nOnce all sections are placed onto the slide (for brain usually \u223c12\u221216 sections/slide), horizontally transfer the slide to a dark slide chamber and let the sections dry completely (\u223c15\u00a0min) to make them adhere to the glass. Either proceed to the next steps of the staining procedure or pause the protocol at this point.Pause point: Store the mounted slides at 4\u00b0C for 10\u201316 h and continue with the protocol on the next day.\nStaining\nTiming: 3\u201316 h\nThis section of the protocol explains the staining procedure for MADM-labelled cells together with an additional, cell-type specific marker staining. All steps are performed at 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C unless otherwise stated. Please refer to troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] when observing variable signals.\nIf your sections were floating sections and have been freshly mounted and dried, immediately proceed to step 46 of the protocol. If your sections were already mounted during sectioning and stored at \u221220\u00b0C, take the slides from the freezer and let them dry for 15\u00a0min.\nEncircle staining area with a hydrophobic pen.\nRehydrate and wash sections 3\u00d7 5\u00a0min with 1\u00d7 PBS to remove residual PBS-T.\nMeanwhile, heat up an oven to 85\u00b0C. Take the opportunity to put the antigen retrieval buffer into the oven to have the solution pre-heated. Our most commonly used antigen retrieval solution is Citrate Buffer pH 6.0.\nIncubate your sections with 1\u00a0mL pre-heated citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 25\u00a0min at 85\u00b0C in a dark and closed staining chamber (make sure it is closed. If it is open, buffer will evaporate and samples will dry out).\nRemove the staining chamber and let chill on your bench for 15\u00a0min. Open it on one corner a tiny bit so the samples can cool down more efficiently (don\u2019t open too much, otherwise the buffer will evaporate and samples will dry out).\nWash 3\u00d7 5\u00a0min with 1\u00d7 PBS.\nIncubate with 500 \u03bcL Blocking Solution for 1 h.\nPlace humidified tissues into the staining chamber to prevent your samples from dehydration during the next steps of the protocol.Dilute primary antibodies in Staining Solution, add 250 \u03bcL antibody mix for one sample and incubate 8\u201312\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.\nWash 3\u00d7 5\u00a0min with 1\u00d7 PBS.\nDilute secondary antibodies in Staining Solution, add 250 \u03bcL antibody mix for one sample and incubate for 2 h.\nWash 3\u00d7 5\u00a0min with 1\u00d7 PBS.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL DAPI working solution for 15\u00a0min.\nWash 1\u00d7 10\u00a0min in PBS\nEmbed the slides with Mowiol and let dry at 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min.\nPause point: Keep the slides at 4\u00b0C until imaging. Image quality is highest upon timely acquisition of images following the staining procedure. We recommend to image the sections within 14\u00a0days after completion of step 60.\nNote: Instead of mounting the floating sections onto glass slides prior to the staining procedure, the whole staining protocol can be performed on floating sections in a 24well plate. Buffers are removed manually using a pasteur pipet or a P1000. We recommend the following volumes when performing stainings in 24well plates:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1163_17.csv\nHere, sections should be mounted after the final washing step following the secondary antibody staining.

For MADM tissue with additional marker staining, select excitation: 405\u00a0nm (for DAPI), 488\u00a0nm (for FITC / GFP), 561\u00a0nm (for Alexa568 / tdT) and 640\u00a0nm (for Alexa647).\nSet to pinhole to 1 airy unit for optimal imaging quality.\nSelect the functions \u201cZ-stack\u201d and \u201cTiles\u201d from the acquisition dashboard.\nSelect objective, scanning speed, resolution and averaging appropriate to the needs of your experiments.\nAdjust laser intensity and gain for each channel.\nIdentify your area of interest and set position and imaging tiles to cover the area of interest. Adjust the z-stack so that all MADM-labeled cells in the tissue are captured.\nAssign the center position of your Z-stack to the tiles and the positions and click \u201cStart\u201d to initiate image acquisition.\nSave the image in .czi file format.\nNote: For tissue overview images and cell number quantification, select a 10\u00d7 objective and use a scanning speed pixel dwell value of 1.52\u20132.06\u00a0\u03bcs (values 7\u20138 in the ZEN blue\u00a0image acquisition software) with resolution 1024 \u00d7 1024 and no averaging. For high-quality images and morphological analysis, use a high magnification objective (e.g. 63\u00d7) and use a scanning speed pixel dwell value of maximum 2.06\u00a0\u03bcs (up to value 7 in the ZEN blue image acquisition software) with resolution 1024 \u00d7 1024 and 2\u00d7 or 4\u00d7 averaging.\nPause point: The protocol can be stopped at this point. Image processing and analysis can be performed at any time after image acquisition.Once image acquisition is completed, use the image processing dashboard in ZEN blue and perform maximum intensity projection using the \u201cOrthogonal Projection\u201d function.\nFollowing projection, perform \u201cStitching\u201d function by fusing tiles.\nSave the projected and stitched image as a new .czi file.\nExport the projected and stitched .czi file to TIFF format. Export DAPI / GFP / tdT / Alexa647 channels individually for subsequent image analysis.", "1.

Avoid the generation of bubbles.\n\u2022 Aspirate the residual vitronectin solution from the pre-coated dish and add 2 ml of pre-warmed E8 medium. \n\u2022 Mix the cell suspension by gently inverting several times, then transfer the appropriate volume into each well containing pre-warmed E8 medium according to the desired split ratio. \n\u2022 Gently place the plate into a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. \n\u2022 No media change should be performed after the day of passage. Afterwards, replace medium daily \\(2\u20132.5 ml per well).\n\u2022 Cultures should be checked regularly for Mycoplasma contamination and the presence of genomic abnormalities. \n2. \\[Optional step] Differentiation day \u20132: DMSO pre-treatment \n  \u2022 Two days prior to starting neural differentiation, and one day prior to spheroid formation, pre-treat hiPSC with 1% DMSO \\(120 \u03bcl per 12 ml of E8 medium for one 100 mm culture dish).\n\u2022 This stage is optional, and based on ref \\(4). \n3. Differentiation day \u20131: Generation of 3D spheroids from hPSC maintained in FF\u2022 To generate spheroids, passage hPSC from a 6-well to a 100 mm culture dish, and culture them to 80\u201390% confluency.\n\u2022 Pre-warm E8 medium, Accutase, and DMEM/F-12 at RT. Supplement E8 medium with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 \\(1:1000) to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM.\n\u2022 To remove air bubbles from the AggreWell plate, add 1 ml per well of E8 supplemented with Y-27632 and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 minutes in a swinging bucket rotor that is fitted with a plate holder. Check under the microscope to ensure bubbles have been removed from microwells. Set the plate in an incubator while preparing the single cell suspensions of hPSC. \n\u2022 Aspirate maintenance medium from the hPSC plates and rinse cells twice with DPBS \\(no calcium, no magnesium).\n\u2022 Add 4 ml of Accutase per 100 mm culture plate and incubate for 7 minutes at 37\u00b0C, in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. \n\u2022 Add pre-warmed E8 medium up to 10 ml volume and centrifuge the cell suspension at 200 x g for 4 minutes.

Collect the spheroids and pass over the strainer as described. Repeat this step 3\u20135 times.\n\u2022 Invert the strainer, and place over a new 50 ml conical tube. Collect the spheroids by washing with Essential 6\u2122 \\(E6) medium for neural induction.\n\u2022 Observe the AggreWell\u2122800 plate under the microscope to ensure that all aggregates have been removed from the wells. Repeat wash if necessary. \n5. Neural induction and differentiation \n  \u2022 Harvested spheroids are placed in ultra-low attachment 100 mm plates in E6 medium supplemented with 2.5 \u03bcM Dorsomorphin \\(DM) and 10 \u03bcM SB-431542 \\(SB). Optionally, 2.5 \u03bcM XAV-939 \\(XAV) can be added for the first five days.

Figure 1a shows a flower photo of \u2018Old Blush\u2019.\n- In a pilot experiment, harvest flower buds at different development stages, and assess microspore cytological stage by DAPI staining<sup>12</sup>: prepare a 5\u00b5g/mL DAPI working solution in citrate/phosphate buffer containing Triton X-100; dilacerate 2-3 anthers in this solution on a microscope slide, remove anther debris and apply a coverslip; observe with fluorescence microscope under UV excitation. This experiment should allow to identify the correct developmental stage based on approximate bud size and morphology, at which the majority of microspores are at the mid-late uninucleate/early bicellular cytological stages \\(Figure 1e-f), according to plant growing conditions. This stage approximately corresponds to when sepals just start to open up and when petals just become visible between sepal margins \\(Figure 1b).\n- Harvest ca. 10 flower buds at the correct development stage.\n- Surface-sterilize buds with Pursept\u00ae A Xpress for 1 minute, followed by a treatment with a bleach solution \\(1.5 % active chlorine) containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 15 minutes, with periodic manual stirring\n- Thoroughly rinse buds 4 times with sterile de-ionized water.\n- Aseptically dissect anthers from buds: longitudinally split open buds using a scalpel blade; then harvest anthers with forceps and transfer them into a glass vial containing 6 mL of B medium.\n- Isolate microspores as previously described7: stir for 2-3 min. at 1500 rpm \\(maximum speed), until the mixture of microspores, anther debris and medium becomes milky; collect the resulting suspension, and filter it through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer \\(nylon sieve).- Centrifuge the filtrate at 100 g for 3 minutes; discard supernatant and carefully remove the top green layer of the two-layered pellet \\(which contains anther wall debris), using a 1 mL pipette or a P1000 micro-pipet.\n- Resuspend the whitish pellet composed of microspores in 6 mL B medium and centrifuge at 65 g for 3 minutes, discard supernatant. Repeat this procedure once more.\n- Discard the supernatant and resuspend well the microspore pellet in 3 mL B medium; immediately pipet a 100 \u00b5L aliquot for cell counting and for FCR/ DAPI assays.\n- Check microspore viability using FCR test<sup>13</sup>: add FDA \\(to 2 \u00b5g/mL) to a microspore suspension aliquot and observe with the fluorescence microscope under blue excitation. Viable microspores display a bright yellow/green fluorescence. A microspore viability rate around 50% or above is appropriate for the subsequent steps. This observation also provides indication about the cytological stage of the purified microspores.\n- Determine microspore number in the purified fraction, using a Malassez counting chamber.\n- Optional: check microspore cytological stages with DAPI staining applied to a microspore suspension aliquot, as described above.\n- Adjust microspore density to 100,000 microspores/mL with B medium.\n- Keep the microspore suspension at 4\u00b0C in darkness for 21 days in Falcon 353001 Petri dishes sealed with Parafilm\u00ae. Use about 1.5 mL microspore suspension per dish.\n- Rinse microspores twice with cold B medium with centrifugations at 50 g for 3 min at 4\u00b0C.\n- Suspend fractions containing about 160,000 microspores in 600 \u00b5L of AT12 medium. Incubate in a 12-well plate sealed with Parafilm\u00ae at 25\u00b0C in the dark.- After 3 weeks, replace the medium with 600 \u00b5L of fresh AT12 medium, by carefully pipeting with a P200 micropipet; re-seal the 12-well plate with Parafilm\u00ae and continue incubation at 25\u00b0C in the dark.\n- Observe for developing micro-calli \\(ca. 0.5 mm diameter). Developing micro-calli start to be seen about 8 weeks after subculture \\(Figure 1g).\n- Isolate developing micro-calli, under the stereo-microscope, by carefully pipetting them with a P200 micropipet \\(with cut tip). Subculture them individually in 300 \u00b5L of AT12 medium in a 24-well plate sealed with Parafilm\u00ae in the same conditions.\n- After 2 weeks, plate individual calli onto CM3 solid medium in 100 x 20 mm round tissue culture dishes \\(30 mL medium per dish), and incubate dishes at 25\u00b0C in darkness \\(Figure 1h).\n- After 7 weeks of culture, subculture developing calli once on CM3 medium for 12 weeks \\(30 mL medium per dish, 4 calli/dish), at 25\u00b0C in darkness.\n- Check for calli that display somatic embryos \\(Figure 1i).\n- For DNA isolation, harvest developing calli and propagate them by repeated subcultures every 4-6 weeks on callus maintenance medium<sup>10</sup> in 100 x 20 mm round dishes \\(30 mL medium per dish, 9 calli/dish), at 25\u00b0C in darkness.\n- For embryo production and further plantlet regeneration, propagate embryogenic calli by repeated subcultures of embryogenic tissues on EMM<sup>11</sup> in 100 x 20 mm dishes \\(33 mL medium per dish, 9 calli/dish), at 25\u00b0C with 16/8h day/night regime.- For plantlet regeneration, dissect cotyledons from embryogenic calli, plate them onto SIM in 100 x 20 mm dishes \\(33 mL medium per dish, 20 cotyledons/dish) and incubate them at 25\u00b0C with 16/8h day/night regime; after 4 weeks, dissect regenerated shoots and transfer them to multiplication medium, incubate them at 22\u00b0C with 16/8h day/night regime; propagate and maintain regenerated plantlets \\(Figure 1j) in the same conditions, by subculture every 4 weeks.\n_**Homozygosity determination:**_\nTo check the homozygosity of developing embryogenic calli, either proceed \\(1) with High Resolution Melting \\(HRM) analyses using primer pairs known to amplify heterozygous loci. In our case, we used the Applied MeltDoctor TM HRM master mix; ThermoFisher Scientific following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; \\(2) by using SSR primers amplifying single heterozygous loci distributed along the chromosomes/genetic linkage groups; and/or \\(3) by observing the k-mer spectrum of Illumina reads derived from this homozygous material.\nDNA genotyping \\(HRM) of isolated calli showed that all tested loci were homozygous \\(Figure 2a). All developing calli displayed the same homozygous profile indicating that they likely derived from a unique microspore development event. This callus was designated R. chinensis HzRDP12 \\(hereafter RcHzRDP12; Figure 1h,i). The k-mer spectrum of Illumina reads derived from RcHzRDP12 provided the final proof that the genome of RcHzRDP12 genome was homozygous, demonstrating a loss of heterozygosity in \u2018Old Blush\u2019 \\(Figure 2b). Experiments exploring the potential of RcHzRDP12 material have revealed that it is possible to maintain the embryogenic capacity of produced calli through several subcultures. Furthermore, we readily able to regenerate plantlets with normal morphological phenotype from RcHzRDP12 somatic embryos \\(Figure 1j). \n_**Ploidy determination:**_\nTo determine the ploidy level of the developed homozygous calli and plants, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting \\(FACS) analysis:- Isolate nuclei from homozygous calli samples or from young leaves of regenerated plantlets, as previously described<sup>14</sup>. Leaves from the heterozygous \u2018Old Blush\u2019 rose plants from which the homozygous material derives was used as control.\n- Stain by adding 1\u00b5g/ml DAPI \\(Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature. In our case, FACS analyses were performed using MACSQuant VYB \\(Miltenyi Biotec) cytometer and analyzed by FlowJo software \\(FlowJo LLC). \n- Compare the ploidy profile of the homozygous material with that of the heterozygous mother plant used as a control.\nIn our case, one major peak corresponding to diploid \\(2N) cells was observed after DAPI staining for RcHzRDP12 \\(Figure 2c) and the ploidy profile of the homozygous rose material was identical to that of the heterozygous rose R. chinensis \u2018Old Blush\u2019 mother plant, used as a control. In all samples, the majority of cells were diploid and low proportion of polyploid cells \\(4N and 8N), frequently observed in young tissues, was detected. These data demonstrate that haploid cells originating from the homozygous callus did undergo spontaneous genome duplication during regeneration resulting in diploid homozygous R. chinensis \u2018Old blush\u2019 callus and plant material.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTumor dissociation\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step combines mechanical and enzymatic dissociation using gentleMACS Dissociator and gentleMACS Tubes.

Proceed immediately to dead cell removal.\nDead cell removal\nTiming: 45\u00a0min to 1 hThis step allows for reducing the amount of non-viable cells from a single cell suspension using Dead Cell Removal MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). A large number of dead cells containing mitochondrial transcripts will be (by default) removed from the downstream analyses in Seurat or other platforms.

A \u00bc (25%) fraction of the total cDNA is used for sequencing index PCR (SI-PCR). The yield of cDNA, however, defines the number of the SI-PCR cycles.\nNote: 10X Genomics recommends sequencing a minimum of 20,000 read pairs/cells for Single Cell 3\u2032 v3/v3.1/HT v3.1/LT v3.1 and Single Cell 5\u2032 v1.1/v2/HT v2 gene expression libraries. For Single Cell 3\u2032 v2 libraries, we recommend 50,000 read pairs/cells.\nBioinformatics analysis of single-cell RNA sequencingIn the original paper (Gabitova-Cornell et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), analysis of scRNA-Seq data was conducted by manual command line and R processing. However, due to potential changes in tool versions, libraries and execution environments simply repeating the sequence of commands used in processing is likely to produce different results for different users (Sandve et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). In order to guarantee the reproducibility and portability of our analytic approach, we converted our analysis into reproducible Common Workflow Language (CWL) pipelines (https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/releases/tag/1.0.20170828135420[href=https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/releases/tag/1.0.20170828135420]) and executed them on user-friendly Scientific Data Analysis Platform (SciDAP, https://scidap.com[href=https://scidap.com]). Open source CWL Pipelines used here are available at https://github.com/datirium/workflows[href=https://github.com/datirium/workflows]. As a workflow runner we used CWL-Airflow (Kotliar et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), however, the same pipelines (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5339177[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5339177] ) can be executed in any other CWL-based execution environments (https://commonwl.org[href=https://commonwl.org]).CWL specification was developed (https://w3id.org/cwl/v1.0/[href=https://w3id.org/cwl/v1.0/]) in order to make workflows portable and reproducible. It is a data-driven standard that describes tools and pipelines as YAML or JSON structured linked data documents. For each workflow step (\u201ctool\u201d), CWL defines inputs and outputs in a formalized way that allows for linking of tools into workflows. Moreover, CWL tool description includes a Docker (or Singularity) container supporting execution in an isolated runtime environment with a pre-installed and tested version of the required software. Therefore, the pipeline becomes independent of the execution platform and can be run in exactly the same way anywhere CWL standard is supported. A basic outline of scRNA-Seq pipeline as well as the structural schema of data processing on SciDAP is shown on Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. The processing time for all Cell Ranger based workflows will depend on the quality of the input datasets, sequencing depth, number of detected cells, and available hardware resources. As for Seurat clustering pipeline, its performance will be mostly influenced by the input cells number, filtering thresholds and clustering resolution.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05. scRNA-Seq data analysis on SciDAP and by manual command line processingTimings calculated for the scRNA-Seq data analysis pipeline (A) show an actual processing time for each workflow run sequentially. All Cell Ranger based pipelines were limited both by 10 CPU and 30 GB of RAM. Seurat clustering analysis was limited only by 10 CPUs and at maximum used 20 GB of RAM. Disk usage to store data analyses results does not include the size of the input and temporary files. The preparation steps, such as downloading or uploading input data, installing and configuring required software are not included in timings. On the structural schema (B) all required pipelines are saved on GitHub repository following CWL specification that makes them portable and reproducible. After the user selects a workflow type, uploads or sets SRA run accession numbers for input data, the system automatically schedules workflow for execution on one of the available workers (personal computer, in-house or cloud server). When workflow finishes running, the user gets access to the data processing results.We recommend using specialized data analysis platform as it doesn\u2019t require from a user having powerful computational resources. It also keeps data organized and guarantees workflows reproducibility as each workflow step is run inside a Docker container with the pre-installed and tested version of the required software. SciDAP provides a graphical user interface that allows biologists to analyze data using transparent, reproducible, and portable CWL pipelines without the need for coding. After the analysis is complete, biologists can explore results using interactive visualization tools and produce publication-ready images. Advanced users can adjust CWL pipelines and visualizations to suit their specific analysis needs. Below we will discuss how scRNA-Seq data analysis can be performed in SciDAP, how analysis parameters are chosen and briefly discuss what happens under the hood. The CWL pipelines used here are available on GitHub and can be used with any other CWL runner (see https://commonwl.org[href=https://commonwl.org] for full list), but without the graphical interface described here.\nCreate a new project and attach workflows. In SciDAP, projects keep data organized by the study. Attaching workflows to projects ensures that similar data are processed by compatible pipelines.\nLog in or create a new user account on https://scidap.com[href=https://scidap.com]. Follow the on-screen guides to set up your own laboratory or to join an existing one.\nCreate a new project by clicking the New Project button on the Projects page.\nSet an arbitrary Project title and Project subtitle to distinguish the newly created project from the others (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). Optionally, add detailed project description in the Abstract field below the Project subtitle section (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06. Creating a new project for scRNA-Seq data analysisSetting project title and subtitle helps to distinguish it from the other projects (A). A detailed project description can be added as a Markdown-formatted text (B). Since there are many ways to process the same data, only workflows that have been attached to the project can be used for data analyses to ensure that samples are directly comparable(C). The list of available workflows can be edited after project creation as well.\nSelect the following workflows (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C) for single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis. For your convenience, use the search bar to find the required workflows faster.\nCell Ranger Build Reference Indices\nCell Ranger Count Gene Expression\nCell Ranger Aggregate\nSeurat Cluster\nClick the Save button at the top right corner of the screen.\nBuild Cell Ranger reference indices. To build reference genome indices Cell Ranger runs STAR (Dobin et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Genome indices are used to make alignment algorithms fast and efficient. For Cell Ranger both genome sequences (FASTA) and gene annotation (GTF) files should be provided. The gene annotation file is required for splice junction extraction which improves mapping accuracy of scRNA-Seq data. More details about preparing genome references for Cell Ranger can be found on the official 10X Genomics documentation page (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references]).\nEnter a newly created project.\nCreate a new experiment by clicking the Add sample button on the Sample tab.\nSelect Cell Ranger Build Reference Indices workflow from the Experiment type dropdown menu (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07. Building Cell Ranger reference indices\nAfter the user selects experiment type (A), they are presented with a form that allows them to specify experiment/analysis parameters (B). SciDAP automatically creates these input forms based on CWL pipelines. Optional experiment details can be added as a Markdown-formatted text (C).On the General info tab set an arbitrary Experiment short name to distinguish the newly created sample from the others. Select Mus Musculus (mm10) genome from the Genome type dropdown menu (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B). Optionally, add detailed experiment description in the Details section (Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C). SciDAP already has the genome and annotation in its database and they will be used for indexing.\nClick the Save sample button at the bottom of the screen.\nPause point: Before proceeding to the next step make sure that building Cell Ranger reference indices finished running successfully. If the analysis failed SciDAP displays an error marker with the percentage and the name of the last executed workflow step on the right side from the failed experiment on the Sample tab. SciDAP will not allow using failed experiments for further analyses.\nQuantify gene expression. Cell Ranger gene expression quantification starts with read trimming (for Single Cell 3\u2032 Gene Expression) and running STAR for splice-aware read alignment. Only the reads that are uniquely mapped to the transcriptome are used for analysis. PCR duplicate reads are removed based on Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI). Cell Ranger supports automatic sequencing error corrections in UMIs, which allows saving more reads. The unique reads that have valid cell barcodes and UMIs, and that are mapped to exactly one gene are used to create cell by gene matrix. More details about the Cell Ranger gene expression quantification algorithm can be found on the official 10X Genomics documentation page (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/algorithms/overview[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/algorithms/overview]).\nEnter the project where the sample with the Cell Ranger reference indices was created.\nCreate a new experiment by clicking the Add sample button on the Sample tab.\nSelect Cell Ranger Count Gene Expression workflow from the Experiment type dropdown menu (Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig8.jpg\nFigure\u00a08. Gene expression quantification for KPPC 1 SRR12450154 datasetExperiment entry form allows users to select workflow type (A), set general parameters (B) and attach data files or provide accession number/URL to the data (C). For data from NCBI short read archive (SRA) SciDAP will automatically download and extract raw sequencing data into a pair of FASTQ files based on the SRR accession number (D). Same SRR number should be provided for both FASTQ R1 and R2 input files (C).\nOn the General info tab set an arbitrary Experiment short name to distinguish the newly created sample from the others. Select the experiment with the Cell Ranger reference indices from the Genome type dropdown menu (Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B). Optionally, add detailed experiment description in the Details section.\nClick the Use File Manager button under the FASTQ file R1 label (Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).\nOn the Attach from URL tab provide SRR run accession number in a form of geo://SRR12450154 (Figure\u00a08[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]D). Click the Use custom URL button.\nProvide the same SRR run accession number when clicking the Use File Manager button under the FASTQ file R2 label.\nClick the Save sample button at the bottom of the screen. SciDAP will not allow adding failed or unfinished samples as input into ther next step. Users will be notified with the correspondent warning message about missing upstream analysis.\nNote: Repeat the same steps for each experiment to be analyzed (e.g. every SRX run in the PRJNA657051 BioProject). The KPPC 1 SRR12450154 dataset is shown as an example. To obtain a list of required SRR run accession numbers open https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA657051[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA657051] (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A) and copy SRR identifiers for each of the SRX experiments (Figure\u00a09[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B).Optional: If sequence data from the multiple SRR runs belong to the same SRX experiment and should be processed as a single sample, SRR run accession numbers should be provided in a form of comma-separated list. In addition to downloading from NCBI SRA, Attach from URL tab also supports direct URLs to the FASTQ files deposited to other repositories.\nAlternatives: Input FASTQ files can be uploaded from the user\u2019s computer using the File Manager tab or downloaded from the FTP server through the FTP Connection tab.\nThe results of each successfully finished gene expression quantification experiment can be explored in a form of web-based report generated by Cell Ranger, and interactively in the UCSC Cell Browser (Speir et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Additionally, a file compatible with the Loupe Browser (10X Genomics) can be downloaded from the Files tab. The user is presented with QC measures including the number of reads mapped to intergenic, exonic or intronic regions; the barcode rank plot and others.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig9.jpg\nFigure\u00a09. Searching for SRR run accession numbers that belong to the PRJNA657051 BioProject\nOn NCBI SRA the raw sequencing data is saved in a form of SRA archives that can be accessed by their SRR run accession numbers (B). Multiple SRR runs can belong to the same SRX/GSM sample which in turn belongs to an SRP/GSE study (A). The same pages can be found via GEO search.\nPause point: Before proceeding to the next step make sure that gene expression quantification experiments successfully finished running for all five datasets.Aggregate cells by gene data from multiple samples. To proceed to the clustering analysis, the results of all five gene expression quantification experiments should be merged into a single feature-barcode matrix. However, since for each scRNA-Seq experiment, cell barcodes were drawn from the same pool of whitelisted barcodes (10X Genomics) a simple merging may result in having duplicated barcodes. To avoid this scenario Cell Ranger updates each barcode with an integer suffix pointing to the dataset the cell came from before running aggregation. Optionally, Cell Ranger may run a depth normalization algorithm to make all merged datasets have a similar number of uniquely mapped to transcriptome reads per cell. This approach may be suboptimal since all data will be downsampled to match the worst sample. Here we aggregate samples without normalization, leaving normalization to Seurat. More details about the Cell Ranger aggregation algorithm can be found on the official 10X Genomics documentation page (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/aggregate[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/aggregate]).\nEnter the project where the sample with the Cell Ranger reference indices was created.\nCreate a new experiment by clicking the Add analysis button on the Analysis tab.\nSelect Cell Ranger Aggregate workflow from the Experiment type dropdown menu (Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig10.jpg\nFigure\u00a010.

Additionally, a file compatible with the Loupe Browser (10X Genomics) can be downloaded from the Files tab.\nPause point: Before proceeding to the next step make sure that gene expression aggregation experiment finished running successfully\nCluster and identify gene markers. The joint analysis of multiple scRNA-Seq datasets with Seurat (Hao et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) starts with evaluation of common single-cell quality control (QC) metrics \u2013 genes and UMIs counts, percentage of mitochondrial genes expressed. QC allows to get a general overview of the dataset quality as well as to define filtering thresholds for dead or low-quality cell removal. Filtered merged datasets are then being processed with the integration algorithm. Its main goal is to identify integration anchors \u2013 pairs of cells that can \u201cpull together\u201d the same cell type populations from the different datasets. An integration algorithm can also solve batch correction problems by regressing out the unwanted sources of variation. The integrated data then undergo the dimensionality reduction processing that starts from the principal component analysis (PCA). Based on the PCA results the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and clustering analysis are run with the principal components of the highest variance. Clustered data are then used for gene markers identification. These genes are differentially expressed between clusters and can be used for cell types assignment. More details about scRNA-Seq integration analysis with Seurat can be found on the official documentation page (https://satijalab.org/seurat[href=https://satijalab.org/seurat]).Enter the project where the sample with the Cell Ranger reference indices was created.\nCreate a new experiment by clicking the Add analysis button on the Analysis tab.\nSelect Seurat Cluster workflow from the Experiment type dropdown menu (Figure\u00a011[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig11.jpg\nFigure\u00a011.

It also runs a preliminary clustering analysis that may be sufficient for some cases. However, in addition to that, we recommend exploring commonly used QC metrics for the merged datasets that are produced by Seurat. These will help to evaluate how filtering parameters influence the number of remaining cells, define datasets dimensionality, perform clustering, identify gene markers, and evaluate expression levels of genes of interest to assign cell types to clusters. All of these are accessible on the QC (not filtered), QC (filtered), Dimensionality evaluation, QC (integrated), Clustering, Gene expression, and Putative gene markers tabs of the successfully finished clustering experiment.\nCell count bar plot (Figure\u00a012[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A) allows to examine the number of cells per dataset. Cell counts mainly depend on the number of loaded cells and on the capture efficiency of the used single-cell protocol. The minimum required number of cells can be estimated based on the assumed number of cell types, the minimum fraction of the rarest cell type in population, and the minimum required number of cells per type (https://satijalab.org/howmanycells/[href=https://satijalab.org/howmanycells/]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig12.jpg\nFigure\u00a012.

Genes per cell density distribution plot (C) is split into KPPC and KPPCN groups. Zoomed in section of the density plot (D) displays all 5 datasets within the selected boundaries. Cell rank plot (E) displays cells sorted by gene per cell counts within each dataset. The lower and upper limits for genes per cell values are shown as red and green lines correspondingly. On the genes per cell over UMIs per cell correlation plot (F) a vertical red line indicates the minimum threshold for UMIs per cell values. All the cells with the percentage of transcripts mapped to mitochondrial genes below 5% are marked as\u00a0blue.The violin plots (Figure\u00a012[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]B) are used to visualize per cell density distributions of the following metrics: UMI counts, gene counts, the percentage of transcripts mapped to mitochondrial genes, and novelty score. Embedded box plots help to spot outliers and define filtering thresholds for each metrics. In general, it is recommended to filter out all of the cells with less than 500\u00a0UMIs per cell. The abundance of cells with low UMIs per cell values may indicate a small number of reads uniquely mapped to transcriptome or low sequencing depth. The percentage of transcripts mapped to mitochondrial genes correlates with the number of dying cells. In most of the cases cells with more than 5% of the reads mapped to mitochondrial genes should be discarded. The novelty score indicates the complexity of the dataset and is calculated as the ratio of genes per cell over UMIs per cell. Typically, the novelty score should be above 0.8. Higher novelty score implies higher diversity of genes per UMIs and requires more cells to be called per dataset.\nTo evaluate the lower and upper limits for gene per cell counts not only the density distribution (Figure\u00a012[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]B\u201312D), but also the cell rank plot (Figure\u00a012[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]E) can be used. The latter allows to visually identify the cells with extremely low or extremely high number of genes for each dataset. In general, to filter out low-quality cells or empty droplets the minimum threshold for gene per cell counts should be set to 500. Setting the upper limit for these metrics can be used to remove cell doublets.All three metrics combined (UMI counts, gene counts, the percentage of transcripts mapped to mitochondrial genes) are shown on the genes per cell over UMIs per cell correlation plot (Figure\u00a012[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]F). This plot can be used to evaluate whether a certain threshold has already discarded all unnecessary cells, so the other filtering criteria can be omitted, thus avoiding accidental removal of viable cell populations.\nA combined effect of filtering by UMI counts, gene counts, and by the percentage of mitochondrial reads is shown on the genes per cell over UMIs per cell correlation plot (Figure\u00a013[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]A). The plot displays the remaining cells after all QC filters have been applied.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig13.jpg\nFigure\u00a013. QC metrics and dimensional reduction analysis of filtered integrated datasets\nCombined effect of multiple filtering parameters can be explored on the genes per cell over UMIs per cell correlation plot (A). Elbow plot (B) helps to define datasets dimensionality, but it is rather a subjective measure and should not be used as the main criteria. Final clustering results (C) as well as split by condition clusters (D) are used to evaluate cell populations present in datasets.\nThe Elbow plot (Figure\u00a013[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]B) is used to evaluate the dimensionality of the filtered integrated datasets by selecting only those principal components that capture the majority of the data variation. Typically, it is defined by the principal component after which the plot starts to plateau.\nUMAP plot shows cell clusters in the filtered integrated dataset (Figure\u00a013[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]C). The same plot but split into KPPC and KPPCN groups (Figure\u00a013[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]D) allows to spot clusters distinctive for each group.Dot plot with scaled gene expression (Figure\u00a014[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]A) is used to visually evaluate the average expression levels and the percentage of genes of interest per cluster. It helps to explore the similarities between clusters and identify cell types.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig14.jpg\nFigure\u00a014. Gene expression plots for assigning cell types to clusters\nClusters on a dot plot (A) are grouped together based on the similarities of the expression levels of genes of interest. On the feature plots (B) cells are highlighted correspondingly to the normalized expression levels of each of the genes of interest. Violin plots (C) show gene expression for genes of interest in each cluster.\nFeature plots (Figure\u00a014[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]B) highlight normalized expression levels of genes of interest over the identified clusters.\nThe violin plots (Figure\u00a014[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]C) show the density distributions of the normalized expression levels of genes of interest per cluster. Altogether with above mentioned plots they are used for manual assigning cell types to clusters.\nClustering results loaded in UCSC Cell Browser allow to interactively explore identified clusters (Figure\u00a015[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]A), highlight cells belonging to various samples and conditions (Figure\u00a015[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]B), explore expression of genes of interest (Figure\u00a015[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]C), and export barcodes of selected cells (Figure\u00a015[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]D) for further analyses.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1211-Fig15.jpg\nFigure\u00a015.

We have deposited this plasmid with Addgene (ID number 166504). Sub-clone the cDNA encoding your protein of interest into pCDNA5_FRT-TO_TurboID-mCherry-Cry2 using standard molecular biology procedures. You can use a variety of cloning strategies. For example, the cDNA can be sub-cloned in the KpnI site of the vector (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) using the In-Fusion HD cloning system (Takara Bio, USA).

This protocol describes the analysis of TopBP1 proximal proteins by immunoblotting using 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 Flp-InTMT-RExTM293 cells stably transfected with the doxycycline-inducible TurboID-TopBP1WT-mCherry-Cry2 construct.\nDay 1 Morning:\nPrewarm cell media, PBS, and trypsin at 37\u00b0C in a water bath.\nSeed 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 Flp-InTMT-RExTM293 cells/per 10\u00a0cm dish in 5\u00a0mL of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) without any selection antibiotics. Use three dishes for a typical experiment:\nwith doxycycline/ Light OFF\nwithout doxycycline/ Light ON\nwith doxycycline/ Light ON\nDay 1 Evening:\nAdd 4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of doxycycline in a falcon tube containing 5\u00a0mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to reach a final concentration of 2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL doxycycline, as described in step 18.\nAdd the 5\u00a0mL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL doxycycline to the 5\u00a0mL cells culture from step 16. The final concentration of doxycycline is 2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Allow protein expression for 16\u201324 h.\nDay 2:\nPrewarm the DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C.\nThaw the biotin stock solution.\nPrepare in 15\u00a0mL Falcon tube 10\u00a0mL of DMEM supplemented with 500\u00a0\u03bcM biotin and keep at 37\u00b0C.\nPlace the illumination box in a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nReplace the cell culture medium with 10\u00a0mL of DMEM media supplemented with 500\u00a0\u03bcM biotin and 2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL doxycycline.\nCritical: Add the medium from the wall of the cell culture dish and not directly on the cells to avoid cell detachment.Transfer rapidly the cell culture dish without cover into the custom-made illumination box and turn ON the device.\nNote: At this stage, it is not essential to manipulate cells in a sterile environment because the cells will be collected and lysed for biochemical analyses immediately after optogenetic induction of condensates.\nExpose the cells to blue light for 10\u00a0min of light-dark cycles (4\u00a0s light followed by 30\u00a0s dark).\nNote: In principle, high doses of 488\u00a0nm light could generate reactive oxygen species. However, in comparison with dental photo-polymerization sources, for example, the light intensity used here (10 mW/cm2) is weak. Yet, it would be wise to minimize exposure times. For example, 3\u00a0minutes of light dark cycles (4\u00a0s light followed by 10\u00a0s resting in the dark) induce robust TopBP1 condensation. After optogenetic activation, condensates will dissolve progressively. Five minutes after light activation, approximatively 40% of TopBP1 condensates have dissolved (Frattini et\u00a0al. 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The light-dark cycle parameters required for the maintenance of condensates during proximity labeling depends on the cellular concentration and on the sequence of the protein that holds condensates together via multiple weak and cooperative interactions. The parameters of optogenetic activation need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.\nTurn OFF the device.\nRemove medium completely by aspiration and wash the cells carefully at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C with 5\u00a0mL/ of 1\u00d7 PBS per dish.\nGently scrape all the cells off the plate with a cell scraper and place the cell suspension in a 15\u00a0mL Falcon tube.

Resuspend gently the stock of streptavidin beads by tapping/flicking the bottom of the tube. Wash the beads twice with RIPA/SDS lysis buffer and resuspend in RIPA/SDS buffer.\nTransfer the cleared supernatant to a new 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tube.\nDetermine total protein concentration using Bradford protein assay.\nTo isolate biotinylated proteins from cell lysates, incubate up to 1\u00a0mg of cell lysates with the pre-washed agarose-streptavidin beads for 3\u00a0h on a rotating wheel at 4\u00b0C.\nSpin the bead suspensions for 1\u00a0min at 400\u00a0\u00d7 g, at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C , and carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting.Wash the beads via resuspension and incubation on a rotating wheel for 3\u00a0min as indicated below. Between each step, pull down the beads by centrifugation for 1\u00a0min at 400\u00a0\u00d7 g at 18\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C and remove carefully the supernatant:\nWash with 1\u00a0mL of RIPA/SDS Lysis buffer\nWash with 1\u00a0mL Wash buffer 1\nWash with 1\u00a0mL Wash buffer 2\nWash with 1\u00a0mL Wash buffer 3\nWash with 1\u00a0mL Wash buffer 4 (twice)\nCritical: Avoid pipetting the beads excessively, as they can bind to the pipet tips, leading to sample loss.\nAdd 60\u00a0\u03bcL of 2X Laemmli Sample buffer to each sample and flick to mix.\nHeat samples for 10\u00a0min at 95\u00b0C to elute the proteins.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C or \u221280\u00b0C for at least 1 year.\nCritical: Avoid multiple boiling and freezing cycles of your samples.\nFor western blot analysis, resolve proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

We have adopted an established protocol3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] to induce iPSCs into NPCs. The iPSCs to NPCs induction takes 7\u00a0days.\nCritical: iPSCs are from a frozen stock and need to be passaged at least once before the induction is initiated (around 2\u00a0weeks for iPSC thawing and maintenance).\nThaw iPSCs from a frozen stock.\nThaw the vitronectin aliquot at 20\u201325\u00b0C and prepare for each well of a 6 well vessel (10\u00a0cm2) 40\u00a0\u03bcL of vitronectin diluted in 1\u00a0mL of Cell Adhere dilution buffer.\nCoat culture vessels with vitronectin and incubate at 20\u201325oC for 1 h.\nNote: The temperature range 20\u201325\u00b0C corresponds to the room temperature (or RT) conditions.\nCritical: It is essential to use non-tissue culture treated culture plate for vitronectin coating.\nAlternative: Matrigel can be used as an alternative to vitronectin. See point 3.a for Matrigel coating instructions.\nPrepare complete StemFlex media with the Rock Inhibitor Y27632 (5\u00a0\u03bcL of 10\u00a0mM Y27632 stock in 10\u00a0mL for a final concentration of 5\u00a0\u03bcM).\nCritical: The ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) is only added for the first 24 hours of culture (5\u00a0\u03bcL in 10\u00a0mL) to promote cell survival.\nIncubate the frozen stock of iPSCs in a 37\u00b0C water bath until the ice in the tube disappears.\nTransfer the thawed iPSCs in an empty 10-mL Falcon tube and then add 4\u00a0mL of StemFlex media to the iPSCs drop-wise while shaking the tube to avoid an osmolarity shock and to obtain the iPSC suspension.When ready, aspirate the vitronectin from each well of the 6 well plate and replace with fresh StemFlex media, 2\u00a0mL per well.\nAdd 100\u00a0\u03bcL of iPSCs suspension to one coated well as a starting point.\nCheck the cell density and add more iPSC suspension if needed to achieve an optimal cell density (see Figures\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3106-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. iPSC density\n(A and B) Optimal iPSC seeding densities and confluency. Since iPSCs grow in colonies instead of single cells, it is difficult to calculate the seeding density of iPSCs using number of cells per cm2. Here, two illustrations were drawn, looking down a brightfield microscope with a 4X objective, for references of: (A)\u00a0optimal seeding density of iPSCs, showing floating aggregates of cell clusters each consisting of 5\u20126 cells, and (B)\u00a0optimal confluency of iPSCs colonies ready for passaging. Colonies should not merge with each other and have defined edges.\n(C and D) Morphology of iPSC colonies before NPC induction. Morphology of different iPSC colonies before NPC induction. Phase contrast images were taken using a FLoid imaging station. (C) A good iPSC colony with defined edges and a compact center. (C) A pre-differentiated iPSC colony with loose edges and differentiated cells, which should not be used for the NPC induction.(E) Cell confluency affects NPCs induction. In this example, 75, 100 or 150\u00a0\u03bcL of the iPSC stock were seeded at the beginning of the induction which results at different cell density in each well. Medium is turning yellow in the well labeled \u201c150\u201d after 24\u00a0h of media change which indicates that the cell confluency is too high and therefore there is a risk that small molecules might be insufficient for the induction of all iPSCs inside the well. We recommend that the medium is closely monitored for color changes during NPC induction. Do not use cells from wells which have a decoloration of the medium for the NPC bank.\nMaintain the iPSC culture plate in the incubator, 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2.\nNote: Don\u2019t let the vitronectin solution dry on the wells before addition of the cell suspension.\nMaintenance of iPSCs in culture.\nThe StemFlex culture medium needs to be changed the next day without the ROCK inhibitor and will then be changed at least every 2\u20133\u00a0days.\nNote: Considerable cell death could occur and changing media helps to remove floating dead cells. Adherent cells should be visible as small colonies.\nNote: During iPSC thawing and passaging, different seeding cell densities could be tried to obtain the best density. Ideally, there should be enough distance between individual cell colonies to provide space for cell growth (see Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Adapt the volume of the media and timing of media change in relationship to the cell density to ensure that all iPSCs are well supported (ie: more frequent media changes are needed when there is a high number of cells in one well).Note: Small iPSC colonies should appear over 2\u20133\u00a0days with only one cell type visible. If there are multiple pre-differentiated cell types, the iPSCs need to be passaged further to obtain high quality iPSCs. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] \u201cproblem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\u201d.\nNote: iPSCs need to be passaged before the individual colonies merge with each other as seen in Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nNote: It is difficult to give an optimal iPSC seeding density because they are in colonies and a count of the individual cells is an inaccurate parameter for cell seeding of colonies.\nCritical: It is crucial to start the NPCs induction with well-formed iPSC colonies at the optimal confluency (70%\u201380%). The iPSC colonies should have a compact centre and well-defined edges with no differentiated cells (see Figures\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). Undifferentiated iPSCs are the rounded cells inside the cluster.\niPSC to NPC induction.\nCoat a 6-well plate with Matrigel (pure Matrigel solution prepared following the manufacture\u2019s instruction, see \u201cbefore you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] point 1a\u201d) for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C, 1\u00a0mL Matrigel each well.\nNote: Matrigel will start to gel up above 10\u00b0C, so materials and solutions need to be cold for the coating. It is recommended to incubate the plate and pipette tips in the freezer 10\u201315\u00a0minutes before starting the coating and to keep the Matrigel on ice.\nNote: Matrigel coating needs to be coated at 37\u00b0C at least 30\u00a0min. The coating can be done overnight (up to 16 hours) but it is not recommended to coat the plate more than 24 hours.\nMake up basal [RDM] and [RDMi] media according to the materials tables. Prepare 2\u00a0mL [RDMi] media for each well (6-well plate).\nAspirate the media carefully in the wells with good iPSC colonies.\nWash the iPSCs gently with warm DMEM-F12. Aspirate gently.Add 1\u00a0mL ReLeSR per well, and then aspirate ReLeSR after 5 s.\nNote: Make sure that ReLeSR is in contact with all the iPSC colonies. This is usually achieved by rotating the plate a few times before aspirating the ReLeSR.\nStart the timer for 7\u00a0min at 20\u201325\u00b0C. Wells are dry (without media) during this period.\nNote: It is recommended that colonies are observed under a microscope during the detachment step. Once the central cells in the colony start to break away with visible gaps, the cell monolayer is ready to be harvested. It generally takes 5\u20136\u00a0minutes but can fluctuate depending on the iPSC lines and the cell density.\niPSCs should detach spontaneously, if not gently tap the plate.\nNote: Do not let the colonies break into single cells. At the start of NPC induction, the cells are still pluripotent and need to be in colonies/aggregates to survive (3\u20136 cells).\nAdd 1\u00a0mL [RDM] basal media to each well and collect detached iPSCs colonies gently into 10\u00a0mL tubes to obtain the iPSC suspension.\nNote: Do not pipette up and down too many times (3 times at most), otherwise the colonies will disaggregate into sizes that are too small for the cells to survive. An optimal size is 3\u20136 cells per colony.\nAspirate Matrigel and add [RDMi] media to the coated well, 2\u00a0mL per well.\nAdd 20\u00a0\u03bcL, 50\u00a0\u03bcL or 100\u00a0\u03bcL of iPSCs suspension into each well of the coated plates, with a dilution factor of 1:50, 1:20 and 1:10, respectively. Check the cell density under the microscope.Critical: It is fundamental to use different dilutions of iPSC suspensions for the NPC induction to optimise the seeding density of iPSC colonies. It is critical to have the correct density of iPSC colonies seeded. The cells need to be induced for 7\u00a0days without passaging; if too many colonies are seeded, cells will rapidly exhaust the supply of small molecules present in the induction media [RDMi] by the end of the induction (days 5\u20137). If insufficient colonies are seeded it can affect the cell survival. When starting with iPSC at 70%\u201380% confluency in the well prior to harvesting, a dilution factor of 1:20 should be optimal. However, as the extent of iPSCs disaggregation into small colonies is difficult to control, it is highly recommended to trial out different dilutions to obtain the optimal seeding density (see Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nIncubate cells at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, for 7\u00a0days.\nChange media with fresh [RDMi] and small molecules every day for 7\u00a0days.\nNote: Cells need to be carefully monitored, specially at days 5\u20127. If the media becomes yellow, it indicates that the cells might have exhausted the small molecules, with the risk of a poor NPC induction. If the cell density is not ideal, the volume of the media per well may need to be increased or changed twice a day (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nNPCs maintenance and creation of a NPCs cell bank\nTiming: 4\u00a0days per passage\nAt day 7 of induction, the cells should have adopted a NPC fate, and they are ready to be passaged, expanded and frozen down to generate a cell bank for subsequent neuronal differentiation.Note: For NPC quality control, cells can be stained with iPSC and/or NPC specific marker antibodies at different stages of induction. For a list of recommended antibodies, please refer to Wang et\u00a0al. 2023.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNPCs passage.\nCoat a 6-well plate with Matrigel for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C, 1\u00a0mL Matrigel each well.\nNote: Matrigel needs to be coated at 37\u00b0C for at least 30\u00a0min. The coating can be done overnight (up to 16 hours) but it is not recommended to coat the plate more than 24 hours.\nMake up basal [RDM] and [RDMm] media according to the materials tables. Prepare 2\u00a0mL [RDMm] media for each well.\nAspirate the media carefully.\nWash NPCs gently with DMEM-F12. Aspirate gently.\nAdd 0.5\u00a0mL accutase in each well.\nNote: Accutase is frozen as stock in 5\u00a0mL aliquots and should be thawed at 20\u201325\u00b0C. Do not thaw accutase at 37\u00b0C.\nNote: DMEM-F12 used for the washes doesn\u2019t need to be pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C.\nIncubate 5\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C.\nAdd 1.5\u00a0mL -DMEM-F12 to each well.\nDetach the NPCs gently by tapping the plate.\nPipette up and down three times and collect detached cells gently into 10-mL Falcon tubes to obtain the NPC suspension.\nNote: Pipetting up and down three times should be enough to detach the cells and generate a single cell suspension.\nAlternative: If pipetting doesn\u2019t break up the cell clusters, a cell strainer (40\u00a0\u03bcm diameter) can be used to break the cell clusters and to obtain a single cell solution.\nFor the first passage of NPCs (Induction P0 to NPC P1), dilute the cell suspension by a 1:3 dilution factor (therefore 2\u00a0mL of cell suspension obtained from each well can be expanded into 3 new wells at 2\u00a0mL per well).Centrifuge cell suspension at 200 g for 3\u00a0min at 20\u201325\u00b0C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in [RDMm] media with small molecules.\nNote: For 2\u00a0mL of cell suspension centrifuged, cells should be resuspended in 6\u00a0mL [RDMm] media and will then split into 3 different wells.\nNote: For reference, NPCs can be passaged and seeded at 30,000 cells/cm2. However, the cell survival rate of single-cell NPC suspension can fluctuate between 50%\u201290% depending on cell density and passage number. Hence, seeding a definitive number of NPCs may result in varied confluency of surviving NPCs. Applying the 1:3 dilution factor generally results in more consistent NPC cultures than following exact seeding numbers.\nOptional: The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 can be added to the [RDMm] media to promote cell survival during NPC passaging. However, do not leave Y27632 in the media longer than 24 hours.\nAspirate the Matrigel and add resuspended cell suspension to the coated well, 2\u00a0mL per well.\nIncubate the NPCs at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2.\nNPCs maintenance.\nChange media every 2\u00a0days.\nNPCs monolayer are ready for the next passage at 80%\u201390% confluency. Repeat step 6 to expand the NPCs further.\nNote: it takes 3\u20135\u00a0days for the NPCs to reach confluency again and to be passaged.\nTo freeze down NPCs, repeat steps 6a to 6i to detach the NPCs and collect the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge NPCs suspension at 200 g for 3\u00a0min at RT.\nCount NPCs and freeze 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 NPCs in one vial.\nResuspend NPCs in CryoStor CS10 (freezing media).\nTransfer 500\u00a0\u03bcL of NPCs in freezing media per vial.\nTransfer vial in a special freezing container to allows the temperature to slowly cool down and keep at least 4\u00a0h at \u201280\u00b0C.\nTransfer NPCs frozen vial in the liquid nitrogen for longer storage.Pause point: NPCs can be frozen and thawed when needed.\nIf thawing NPCs:\nRepeat steps 6a and 6b coat the plate and prepare media.\nTransfer the NPCs from liquid nitrogen and thaw cells quickly in a water bath at 37\u00b0C.\nAdd 5\u00a0mL [RDM] basal media to the cells drop-wise while shaking.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 3\u00a0min at 20\u201325\u00b0C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in [RDMm].\nAspirate the Matrigel and seed NPCs into the Matrigel-coated 6-well plates, incubate at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, until the NPCs are confluent (80%\u201390% confluency) and ready for the next passage or to be seeded for the neuronal differentiation.\nNote: It is recommended to include the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 in the [RDMm] media when thawing NPCs. Do not leave Y27632 in the media longer than 24 hours.\nNote: NPCs can be expanded and frozen down from many passages. However, for an optimal neuronal differentiation, it is recommended to use NPCs passaged between P3 and P10.\nNote: For each new batch of NPCs induction, it is important to test that neurons can be generated from the NPC cell bank following after a freeze/thaw cycle.\nNPC to neuron differentiation\nTiming: 7\u201328\u00a0days\nIn this third step, NPCs are terminally differentiated into neurons. An established protocol has been adapted to differentiate NPCs into mature neurons3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] with modification.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Seeded NPCs are noted as \u201cdifferentiation day 0\u201d in the differentiation timeline. Using NPCs as the starting point generates a highly reproducible timeline for neuronal differentiation. We decided to stop the neuronal culture after 28\u00a0days, but it can be stopped at any time.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3106_9.csv\nNote: Researcher should label each new procedure with the date of differentiation to maintain a comprehensive record.\nSeeding NPCs for neuronal differentiation.Coat wells, coverslips or chamber slides with poly-L-ornithine at 20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 250\u00a0\u03bcL per well for 24-well plates, for at least 2\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C.\nNote: Poly L-ornithine is diluted at 1:5 in ultra-pure water at 0.01% ; ie: 1\u00a0mL of poly-L-ornithine in 4\u00a0mL of water.\nPause point: The coating with poly-L-ornithine can be done overnight.\nWash the wells or coverslips with ultrapure sterile water (or PBS) 3 times.\nNote: Make sure that wells or coverslips are dry before adding the laminin.\nCoat wells, coverslips or chamber slides with laminin at 20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 250\u00a0\u03bcL per well for 24-well plates, 37\u00b0C for at least 2 h.\nNote: Laminin is expensive, so it is recommended to calculate exactly how much is needed for the seeding according to the laminin aliquot available. One aliquot of 1\u00a0\u03bcg laminin is diluted in 5\u201310\u00a0mL of cold PBS, and stored at \u201220\u00b0C. The frozen laminin aliquot needs to be spun down few seconds and thawed on ice for 10/15\u00a0minutes. Pipette tips need to be pre-cooled in the fridge when handling laminin.\nAlternative: Matrigel can be used as a cheaper alternative to laminin with 1\u00a0mL per well (6 well plate), but neurons seeded on Matrigel tend to detach more easily than those seeded on laminin from the second week of differentiation onwards.\nMake up basal [N2B21] media and [N2B21+] media with growth factors according to the materials tables. Prepare 250\u00a0\u03bcL [N2B21+] media per well for a 24-well plate.\nAspirate media on NPC monolayers carefully.\nWash NPC monolayers gently with -DMEM-F12. Aspirate gently.\nAdd 0.5\u00a0mL accutase to each well.\nIncubate 5\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C.\nAdd 1.5\u00a0mL DMEM-F12 to each well.\nDetach NPCs gently by tapping the plate.Collect detached cells gently into 10-mL Falcon tubes to obtain the NPC suspension.\nCount cells.\nNote: 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 NPCs are seeded into one well of a 24-well plate, which corresponds to a cell density of 1.58\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells/cm2. The number can be adjusted according to the purpose of the experiment (ie: seeding higher number of cells to obtain a denser neuronal network). Do not seed cells at a density lower than 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells per well; neurons will be too sparse and without adequate neuronal connections will affect the cell survival.\nOptional: If the NPCs are to be cultured for multiple purposes (ie: neuronal differentiation, NPC maintenance and/or NPC freezing), distribute the specific volume of NPC suspension for each purpose in individual 10-mL Falcon tube. Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] above can be used as an example to calculate the correct volume of NPC cell suspension required for each purpose.\nCentrifuge NPC suspension at 200 g for 3\u00a0min at RT.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend NPCs in [N2B21+] media with small molecules and the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (5\u00a0\u03bcL in 10\u00a0mL final).\nNote: if the NPC are divided into individual Falcon tubes for different purposes, resuspend with the correct media and correct volume for each purpose (ie: N2B21 for NPCs seeding, RDM for NPCs maintenance and CryolStor for freezing NPCs). See Table\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nAspirate laminin from the coated cultureware and add resuspended cells to the coated well, 250\u00a0\u03bcL per well for 24-well plates.\nNote: To be sure that the laminin does not run dry, it is better to perform step o. well by well.\nIncubate the NPCs at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. The seeding day corresponds to neuron differentiation Day 0 and plastiware should be labeled with the date of the differentiation day/Day 0).\nDuring the neuronal differentiation:Do a full media change with [N2B21+] containing fresh growth factors (without Y27632) at Day 1.\nFrom day 1 onwards, replace half the media volume with an equivalent volume of fresh [N2B21+] containing fresh growth factors added every 2\u20133\u00a0days.\nNote: By day 1 differentiation, NPCs should be in clusters, at 15/20% confluency. Dendrites can already be seen in presence of the ROCK inhibitor.\nNote: Examine the cells daily for morphological changes. A reference timeline of cell morphology during neuronal differentiation is shown in Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nNote: The identities and development of the neurons can be validated by immunofluorescence using different NPC and/or neuronal markers at different developmental stages. For recommended antibodies working in human neurons, see Wang et\u00a0al. 2023.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nAlternative: If NPC number is low at the beginning of the neuronal differentiation, the proliferation of NPCs can be enhanced by replacing the NBM basal medium with 50% DMEMF-12 and 50% NBM basal medium from day 1 to day 3. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] \u201cproblem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\u201d.\nCritical: Do not let the wells dry when changing for fresh [N2B21+] medium. The neuronal cell layer is highly likely to detach from the surface of the well if the laminin coating is dry during media changes. Always leave a portion of a small volume of conditioned media in the well, sufficient to cover the cells.\nNote: \u201cConditioned media\u201d refers to the media already used to maintain the cell culture, containing growth factors and protein secreted by the cells, present in the well.Optional: If proliferative non-neuronal cells arise in the culture, 2\u00a0\u03bcM of 5-FdU (a thymidylate synthase inhibitor) can be added to the culture around Day 10 until fixation at Day 14 to kill proliferating cells. Alternatively, neurons can be detached and replated to physically separate the neuronal layer to non-neuronal cells from the more adherent non-neuronal cells. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] \u201cproblem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\u201d and Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nMonitoring neuronal differentiation using the IncuCyte\nTiming: 7\u201328\u00a0days\nThe complete timeline of the neuronal differentiation from NPCs (differentiation day 0), can be monitored with long-term live cell imaging using the IncuCyte instrument. The IncuCyte is a wide-field imaging system inside of an incubator which can image cultured cells without disturbing their environment. This protocol can be adapted for other cell imaging microscopes (i.e.,: CELLCYTE X\u2122, Olympus Viva View FL). In this last step, a protocol is described which can record the neuronal dynamics during the different steps of the neurogenesis, as well as the dynamics of intracellular organelles, such as the Golgi apparatus (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Organelles can be followed in live cell using specific dye and/or by the transfection or transduction with fluorescent tagged-organelle markers plasmids (for reference see Wang et\u00a0al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nSeed NPCs with [N2B21+] in culture dishes compatible with the IncuCyte system (and begin NPC differentiation to neurons as described in steps 10a to 10q). In this protocol an 8 wells iBidi \u03bc-Slide was used for imaging.Note: Most of the common culture well plates or chambers are compatible with the IncuCyte. To check if a specific cultureware is supported, search in the \u201cVessel Type Search\u201d page which lists all the cultureware that could be used inside the IncuCyte. If a glass-bottom cultureware is needed for high imaging resolution and/or neuronal attachment, it is recommended to use slide chambers such as an iBidi \u03bc-Slide.\nOn day 1 of neuronal differentiation, add BODIPY TR Ceramide Golgi dye to the culture media (ready-to-use solution) at 1:1000 dilution.\nNote: Add the Golgi dye to the culture media every 2\u20133\u00a0days.\nPut the iBidi \u03bc-Slide inside the IncuCyte imaging system and clip it securely on the slide holder.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3106-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Set-up of the IncuCyte system at the start of the long-term imaging experiment\n(A) In \u201cScan Settings\u201d, select objectives, acquisition channels and acquisition time. An example is shown with a 20X objective and two channels (phase contrast and Red channel) set to default acquisition time.\n(B) In \u201cScan Pattern\u201d, select wells to be imaged and positions imaged per well. Two example patterns are shown: one with 16 positions per well and 4 wells selected (left), and one with 9 positions per well and 8 wells selected (right).\n(C) In \u201cScan Schedule\u201d, select the scan interval/frequency and the end point of the imaging experiment. An example imaging timeline is shown to acquire images every 2\u00a0h indefinitely until the experiment is stopped.\nNote: To achieve long-term imaging of the same field, it is important to secure the plates firmly on the plate holder. This is to ensure that the same position in the well is imaged at each timepoint. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] \u201cproblem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\u201d.Alternative: Other methods to identify the Golgi or other organelles can be adopted, such as transducing the neurons with fluorescently labelled organelle markers, or the use of other cell painting reagents such as the lysotracker or mitotracker.\nSet-up the parameters for imaging following the prompt from the system (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nNote: The IncuCyte scans cultured cells on a selected schedule (e.g. every hour) which can continue indefinitely as long as the cells to be imaged are healthy (up to 28\u00a0days in this protocol). Each scan will take a defined time, and the maximum duration for a single scan need to be half of the acquisition time interval (ie: to scan every 30\u00a0minutes, the duration for a single scan cannot exceed 15\u00a0minutes). It is important to set up the scan time and frequency so that it is within the limit but maximised to generate sufficient data for the purpose of the experiments. The duration of a single scan depends of: (1) number of channel used, (2) duration of the acquisition for each channel, (3) number of chambers, (4) number of wells imaged, and (5) number of positions or fields imaged per well, which is explained in the following steps.\nIn \u201cScan Settings\u201d, select objective, acquisition channels and acquisition time (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Here, a 20X objective is used with two channels (phase contrast for neuronal morphology and RFP for Golgi dye) with default acquisition time (400\u00a0ms).Note: The default acquisition time (300\u00a0ms for the green channel, 400\u00a0ms for the red channel) works well for most experiments. The acquisition time can be increased for dim signals, but this risks phototoxicity and prolonged scanning time for each scan. Phenol red in culture medium does not generate any noticeable effect on the red channel. If phenol red generates autofluorescence on the green channel, phenol-free media should be used.\nIn \u201cScan Pattern\u201d, select wells to be imaged and positions imaged per well (for pattern examples see Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In this protocol, 16 positions/fields imaged per well were imaged for the 8 wells of the iBidi \u03bc-slide.\nNote: The more wells imaged and/or more positions imaged per well, the longer the duration for each scan will be. A \u201cscan duration\u201d is estimated at this set-up step for the pattern chosen (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The scan duration should not exceed half of the acquisition interval/frequency.\nIn \u201cScan Schedule\u201d, select the scan interval/frequency (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Set up the end point of the imaging experiment as well (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In this protocol, cells are imaged every 30\u00a0min for up to 28\u00a0days.\nNote: The default scanning schedule starts on the hour (i.e: scanning will start exactly at 10 am, 11 am, 12 pm, if chosen to image every hour). This can be changed by dragging the timeline as seen in Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], but it is recommended to follow the default schedule so that it is clear at what time the IncuCyte is imaging. This is convenient for changing media for the cells (see step 15).\nNote: It is recommended to select \u201cScan indefinitely\u201d (see Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The experiment can be stopped at any time by deleting the schedule. The IncuCyte will continue scanning the slide until the experiment is deleted.Change the media every 2/3\u00a0days as you would do for neurons cultured in the incubator.\nNote: Only change media when the IncuCyte is not imaging/operating. The available time to change media can be calculated by the scanning duration and frequency. For example, if (1) the IncuCyte is imaging every 30\u00a0minutes, (2) each scan takes 7\u00a0minutes, and (3) the scan starts exactly on the hour; then the IncuCyte will be imaging from 10:00 to 10:07 am, and a media change can be performed from 10:08 to 10:29 am.\nCheck the status of the cells and the IncuCyte regularly during the long-term imaging to make sure neurons are healthy and the imaging settings are good.\nNote: In the middle of an imaging experiment, scans already done are accessible anytime in the \u201cView\u201d function of the IncuCyte software.\nNote: After two weeks of differentiation, neurons can be in a 3D cluster instead of a monolayer, in which case they can be detached and re-seeded in a new coated slide and the analysis continued. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] \u201cproblem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\u201d.\nNote: Having a duplicate neuron plate in the cell culture incubator (not the IncuCyte incubator) can be a good quality control and a backup in case of any technical fault associated with collection of images during the IncuCyte experiment.\nExport the image series from the IncuCyte when the imaging is finished.\nAnalyze the image series using the image analysis software according to the requirements of the experiment.\nNote: When exporting data, it is recommended to choose the option to export images \u201cas stored\u201d. This will export the raw images for each timepoint with full image quality.

Differentiation of neurons derived from healthy human iPSC with phase contrast images taken using the IncuCyte every 30\u00a0min from day 1 to day 28, related to step 11", "The fabrication sequence (see Fig. 1) consists of making molds for vocal fold model layers, sequentially casting silicone layers, and mounting the models for testing. The model has four distinct layers: body, ligament, superficial lamina propria, and epithelium, in addition to a single fiber. A backing layer is added to facilitate the accurate placement of individual layers to the vocal fold model. The model geometric parameter definitions are shown in Fig. 2, with parameter values for the current model given in Table 1. In the following sections, different silicone mixing ratios are specified for the different layers; these produce material properties that are similar to those reported for human vocal fold tissue in the small strain regime 13 (see Table 2).\n1. Mold fabrication and preparation\nCreate solid models of three vocal fold layers: superficial lamina propria, ligament, and body layers. This is typically done by creating 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models with the desired geometries, exporting the CAD models as stereolithography (STL) files, and sending the STL files to a custom machine shop for rapid prototyping.\nCreate a box-shaped mold form using thin pieces of acrylic material. Approximate dimensions (not critical) are 2.54 cm high \u00d7 5.72 cm wide \u00d7 6.35 cm deep. Make the bottom of the form by adhering it to a flat acrylic plate. Seal all interior edges with vacuum grease.Place a small amount of vacuum grease on the lateral side of the solid model of desired geometry (i.e., the body, the ligament, or the superficial lamina propria). Press model into bottom of mold form cavity, vacuum grease side down, so that the vacuum grease holds the part in place. Liberally coat mold form and solid model with release agent. Using a paint brush, ensure release agent reaches into all corners of the mold form cavity.\nMix 10 parts A and one part B of Smooth-Sil 950 platinum silicone rubber (parts measured by weight) in a container that has sufficient room for expansion. To remove air bubbles place mold form with uncured silicone rubber in a vacuum chamber and reduce pressure (e.g., to around 26 inches Hg below atmospheric pressure) for approximately three minutes (or more or less as necessary). Remove degassed silicone from chamber and pour into mold form cavity. Place mold with uncured silicone into vacuum chamber and degas again. Remove from vacuum chamber and place on level surface. Allow to cure for 24 hours and remove mold from mold form.\nRepeat steps 1.1 through 1.4 to create molds for each of the superficial lamina propria, ligament, and body layers.\nCut ligament layer mold at the center of the medial surface in the anterior-posterior direction with a straight razor to allow for fiber insertion.\n2. Casting of each layerBody Layer: Apply thin layer of release agent to body mold cavity with paint brush. Mix one part B and one part A of Ecoflex 00-30 Supersoft Platinum Silicone (by weight). Add one part Silicone Thinner (by weight) to reduce the eventual cured stiffness of the material. Mix together for 30 seconds and place in vacuum chamber for one minute to remove entrapped air. Remove mixture from vacuum and pour into the body mold cavity, but do not fill to the top of the entire mold cavity. Place in oven at 250 \u00b0F for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool.\nBacking: Mix one part B and one part A of Dragon Skin and add one part Silicone Thinner (by weight). Mix vigorously for 30 seconds, place in vacuum for 1 minute, and pour into the body mold cavity until full. Place in oven at 250 \u00b0F for 30 minutes. Remove mold from oven and cool. Remove model from mold, allow to cool to room temperature, and remove any release agent on the surface of the body layer with paper towel.\nLigament Layer: Apply thin layer of release agent on ligament mold cavity surface with paint brush. Place a 30 cm thread in the mold by pushing it into the cut from the straight razor. Thoroughly mix one part B and one part A of Ecoflex 00-30 and four parts of Silicone Thinner (by weight). Place in vacuum chamber to remove air bubbles and pour mixture into ligament mold cavity.Ligament Layer (continued): Press body-backing model (from Steps 2.1.1 and 2.1.2) into the ligament mold cavity. Begin insertion at one side and gently move to the other so that the model pushes the excess uncured silicone and air bubbles out of the mold cavity. If air bubbles are present, remove the model from the mold cavity, refill with uncured silicone, and repeat pressing model into the mold. Place mold in oven for 30 minutes, remove, and cool to room temperature. Remove model from mold. Remove excess release agent with paper towel.\nSuperficial Lamina Propria Layer: Apply thin layer of release agent on superifical lamina propria (SLP) mold cavity surface with paint brush. Mix one part B, one part A of Ecoflex 00-30, and 8 parts Silicone Thinner by weight. Vacuum as done previously and pour into SLP mold cavity. Use the same process described in Step 2.1.4 to insert the ligament-body-backing model into the superficial lamina propria mold cavity. Place in an oven at 250 \u00b0F and cure for one hour. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Remove model slowly and with extreme care so that the superficial lamina propria remains intact.\nEpithelium Layer: Place vocal fold model on a flat surface with the backing down. Remove support material with a straight razor. Suspend threads in air by attaching them to an object of greater height than the model. Mix one part B and one part A of Dragon Skin with one part of Silicone Thinner, mix, vacuum, then pour over the model and allow to cure for one hour. Repeat the process to create a thicker layer. Remove excess material with a straight razor.Optional: If each layer is desired to be a different color (for visible inspection of different layers), add dye to part B of either the Ecoflex or Dragon Skin during the mixing process.\nOptional: If material property data will be collected, create tensile and rheological specimens simultaneously with fabrication of each model layer. Do this by pouring extra uncured material into release agent-treated molds of desired material property specimen shape and size.\nOptional: If measurements of layer thickness are desired, cut a cross section of the model with a straight razor and inspect with microscope.\n3. Final model preparation for testing\nMount each completed vocal fold model into an acrylic mounting plate by first applying a thin layer of silicone glue on the back (lateral) and side (anterior-posterior) model surfaces. Insert model into recessed cut of mounting plate. Align the model medial surface with the top of the acrylic plate. Wipe away excess glue. Allow glue to cure for one hour.\nApply talc powder to the model surface to reduce surface tackiness.\nFor medial surface tracking use a fine-point Sharpie pen to mark dots on the model. Best results occur if marking is done after application of talc powder.\nPlace long bolts through holes of the mounting plate with the threaded ends pointing toward the model to which the existing model will be paired. Lay threads over the bolts. Put closed cell foam over the bolts to close any air gaps.Pair this prepared model with another vocal fold model that has been similarly mounted to an acrylic holder using Steps 3.1 and 3.2. Tighten screws to compress the foam and bring the medial surfaces together until the desire pre-vibratory gap is reached. Ensure both sets of threads are placed over the bolts and extend outward from the acrylic plates in the anterior-posterior direction.\nMount vocal fold pair on air supply tube.\nTie the anterior threads together to form a loop. Repeat for the posterior threads. Hang desired weight on the loops simultaneously.\nModels are now ready for testing and data collection.\n4. Representative Results\nVibratory response data from one model created using this fabrication process are as follows; these results are typical. With tension of approximately 31 g applied to the fibers, the onset pressure was 400 Pa. At a subglottal pressure of 10% above onset pressure (440 Pa), the model vibrated at 115 Hz with a glottal flow rate of 210 ml/s. These values are in good agreement with values reported for those of humans (Table 3). Using high-speed videokymography to analyze model motion showed evidence of a phase difference between the superior and inferior margins, i.e., the superior margin concealed the inferior margin during the open phase of the vibration period (Fig. 3). Trajectories extracted from stereo images of the dots applied to the medial and inferior surfaces of the vocal fold model showed that the model exhibited an alternating convergent-divergent profile that is typical of human phonation, a mucosal wave-like motion, and a lower inferior-superior motion than in previous models (Fig. 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3498/3498table1.jpg\nTable 1.

Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "Three automated TruTip extraction protocols are described and demonstrated here: 1) medium-throughput RNA extraction from NPA on an Eppendorf epMotion 5070; 2) high-throughput genomic DNA extraction from low volumes of whole blood on the Hamilton STAR, and 3) selective isolation and enrichment of fragmented fetal DNA from large volumes of maternal plasma on the Hamilton STARplus. Automated scripts are available from Akonni and only high-level program descriptors are provided here. The extraction and elution reagents are automatically dispensed from bulk reagent troughs to 96-well plates by the automated script(s) before the clinical samples are processed.\n1. Automated RNA Extraction from Nasopharyngeal Aspirate\nThe previously described manual TruTip method 15 is now adapted to run on an Eppendorf epMotion 5070 liquid handling robot, using a large pore TruTip matrix embedded in 1.0 ml Eppendorf pipette tips, a 2 ml deep-well plate (USA Scientific), Akonni TruTip extraction reagents, and NPA as the sample type. The epMotion 5070 liquid handling robot holds up to 8 tips simultaneously, so a baseline automated protocol is described for 8 parallel extractions. However, up to 24 samples can be processed during a single program in one deep-well 96-well sample plate. A separate epMotion program is available (and required) in order to process 16 or 24 samples. The protocol outlined below is for an 8 sample automated script.\nSetup\nBring nasopharyngeal samples to RT before starting the extraction.\nDispense 100 \u03bcl nasopharyngeal aspirate plus 150 \u03bcl nuclease-free water into column 1 of the sample plate (Figure 2A).\nPlace the sample plate into position B1 on the epMotion Worktable (Figure 2B).\nPlace pipette tips, TruTips and 30 ml reagent troughs onto their respective epMotion Worktable positions (Figure 2B).Open the Eppendorf epBlue software, select the Run file provided by Akonni for 8 samples, and load the method by clicking the RUN button on the RUN tab.\nUnder Level Sensor Settings, select Levels and Tips, and click the RUN button.\nInput the sample volume into the software and click RUN.\nThe epMotion script will prompt the user to add extraction and elution reagents to the reagent reservoirs located at position B2 on the Worktable. Add the recommended volumes of each reagent to the respective trough. For 8 samples, the minimum reagent volumes are:\ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2\nReagent,Volume (ml),Trough Position\n95% ethanol,3.5,2\nWash Buffer D,9.0,3\nWash Buffer E,9.0,4\nElution Buffer A2,1.3,5\nLysis and Binding Buffer D,11.0,6\nInput the reagent volumes into the Table presented by the epMotion software during the prompt from Step 8 above. The input value should reflect the actual volume of buffer dispensed by the user into each respective reagent reservoir, and must be greater than or equal to the minimum volumes noted above. Incorrect volume entries could result in incorrect volumes delivered by the epMotion hardware to each tube or well in the 96-well plate(s).\nAutomated Program\nSelect RUN to start the automated method. The automated script will move through the following steps without user intervention:\nSample Lysis and Reagent Distribution:\nDispense 375 \u03bcl Lysis Buffer D into column 1 and mix for 10 cycles (apirate + dispense = 1 cycle). This step starts the lysis incubation process while the remaining reagents are aliquotted.\nDispense 1.6 ml Wash Buffer D into column 2.\nDispense 1.6 ml Wash Buffer E into column 3.\nDispense 50 \u03bcl Elution Buffer A into column 4.\nPause for 6 min to complete the 10 min sample incubation in Lysis Buffer D.Add 375 \u03bcl ethanol to each well in column 1, mixing each sample with ethanol through 10 pipetting cycles.\nExtraction:\nLoad 8 TruTips from position A2 on the Worktable, and begin the extraction process outlined in Figure 1.\nAspirate and dispense sample/lysis buffer/ethanol mixture from column 1 of the sample plate for seven cycles to bind the nucleic acid to the TruTip monolith. Although sample flow through the TruTip may vary (due to differences in clinical sample viscosity), nucleic acid yield for these sample was not affected by flow variation. Options for improving sample flow are described in the Discussion.\nMove TruTips to sample plate column 2, and cycle Wash Buffer D 5x over the monolith to remove residual lysis buffer and sample matrix.\nMove TruTips to sample plate column 3, and cycle Wash Buffer E 5x over the monolith to remove proteins and other contaminants from the bound nucleic acid.\nMove TruTips to the empty reagent reservoir position 1 (in Worktable location B2) and cycle 80x (at a fast flow rate) to dry the monolith. It is important to thoroughly dry the TruTip, as residual solvents in eluted nucleic acid preparations will negatively affect enzymes such as reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase.\nMove TruTips to sample plate column 4 and cycle 5x in Elution Buffer A. The extracted and purified nucleic acid is now in elution buffer in sample plate column 4 wells.\nEject TruTips into the epMotion waste bin.\nWhen the program is finished, manually remove the sample plate from the instrument and transfer the purified nucleic acid to new tubes for long-term storage or further use. Advanced epMotion users can add instructions to the Run file to transfer eluted samples into separate storage tubes or PCR plates, if desired.The program for 16 total samples will repeat steps 10.1 through 10.13 using sample plate columns 5-8. For the 24-sample program, steps 10.1 through 10.13 are repeated 2x using sample plate columns 5-8 and 9-12, respectively.\n2. 96-well Genomic DNA Extraction from Whole Blood\nA Hamilton STAR liquid handling robot is used to demonstrate automated extraction of 96 samples simultaneously from whole blood. The Hamilton STAR differs from the epMotion system in that an optional heater/shaker unit is available on the deck, which is important for enzymatic digestion of certain clinical matrices, such as whole blood. Because the system can be fitted with a 96-channel pipette head, there is a dedicated 96-well plate for each of the TruTip steps and reagents.\nSetup\nTurn on the STAR instrument and computer.\nOpen the Hamilton Run Control software.\nOpen the Run file provided by Akonni for 96 samples.\nPlace labware onto the STAR deck as shown in Figure 3.\nDispense reagents into their corresponding troughs (volumes denote the minimum required to process 96 samples):\ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2\nReagent,Volume (ml),Trough Position\nLysis and Binding Buffer F,75,5\n95% ethanol,100,6\nWash Buffer J,175,7\nWash Buffer K,175,8\nElution Buffer A2,12,9\nProteinase K (20 mg ml-1),8,15\n6. Allow samples to equilibrate to RT.\n7. Place the sample tubes in the Sample Carrier racks (deck position 4 in Figure 3). Place Sample 1 in the rear of the far left carrier and move sequentially down each carrier with Sample 96 ending in the front right position.\nAutomated Program\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Run file window and input the number of samples being processed. The automated script will then move through the following steps without user intervention:\nSample Lysis and Reagent DistributionTransfer 200 \u03bcl from each sample tube to the incubation plate at position 14 on the heater/shaker module (Figure 3).\nDispense 80 \u03bcl proteinase K into each sample well of the incubation plate.\nDispense 600 \u03bcl Lysis Buffer F into each well of the incubation plate.\nMix the solution for 10 cycles, and then incubate for 20 min at 70 \u00b0C and 500 rpm. The 70 \u00b0C set temperature results in an ~60 \u00b0C sample temperature within the deep well plate, which is within the range of proteinase K activity. While the samples are incubating, the liquid handling system continues operating by dispensing reagents into their corresponding plates and wells:\n\t\t\n100 \u03bcl Elution Buffer A into each well of the deep well plate at position 13.\n800 \u03bcl ethanol into each well of the deep well plate at position 10.\n1.6 ml Wash Buffer K into each well of the deep well plate at position 12.\n1.6 ml Wash Buffer J into each well of the deep well plate at position 11.\nAfter the 20 min incubation, the sample mixture is transferred from the incubation plate to the deep well plate at position 10, and mixed through 12 pipetting cycles.\nEject reagent tips into the waste bin.\nExtraction\nThis portion of the gDNA blood procedure is very similar to the epMotion influenza protocol, except for the composition of wash reagents and cycle numbers. The Hamilton TruTips tips are black, so the flow of liquids through the TruTip is not visible.\nLoad 96 TruTips from deck position 3.\nAspirate and dispense the sample/lysis buffer/ethanol mixture in position 10 for 10 cycles to bind nucleic acids to the TruTip monolith.\nMove TruTips to position 11 and cycle Wash Buffer J 5x over the monolith to remove residual lysis buffer and sample matrix.Move TruTips to position 12 and cycle Wash Buffer K 5x to remove proteins and other contaminants from the bound nucleic acid.\nCycle the TruTip 40x at high speed to air dry.\nMove TruTips to position 13 and cycle 5x in Elution Buffer A2. The extracted and purified nucleic acid is now in elution buffer in the deep well plate.\nEject TruTips into the waste bin.\nWhen the program is finished, remove the Elution Plate from the instrument and transfer the extracted samples to the appropriate tubes for storage or downstream applications.\n3. DNA Extraction from Large Volume Plasma Samples\nThe Hamilton STARplus instrument is used to demonstrate an automated protocol for extracting freely circulating fetal DNA from 5 ml of maternal plasma. The STARplus system can support two automated pipette channel arms, one with 8 x 5 ml channels and one with 8 x 1 ml channels. These arms can operate in parallel for staggered processing in batches of 8 samples each. A 5 ml TruTip is used for the initial large-volume extraction, and a 1 ml TruTip is used for size separation and further concentration of the extracted nucleic acid.\nSet-up\nTurn on the STARplus instrument and computer.\nOpen the Hamilton Run Control software.\nOpen the Run file provided by Akonni for 8 large volume plasma samples.\nPlace labware onto the STARplus deck as shown in the Figure 4.\nDispense reagents into their corresponding reservoirs:\ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2\nReagent,Volume (ml),Trough Position\nCN-W1,17,5A\nCN-W2,17,5B\nCN-W4,21,5C\nProteinase K (20 mg ml-1),5,6A\nEBB,17,6B\nEBA2,5,6C\nCN-W3,5,6D\nCN-B2,5,6E\nCN-B3,5,6F\nCN-L1,52,7\nCN-B1,175,8\nAllow sample to equilibrate to RT.\nPlace the sample tubes in the Sample Carrier racks (deck position 3 in Figure 4). Place Sample 1 in the rear and move sequentially toward the front of the deck.\nAutomated ProgramBecause of the large input sample volume, lysis and homogenization steps must be performed off of the Hamilton STARplus instrument in a water bath. Steps requiring user intervention within the automated protocol are indicated with an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the sentence, and bold type.\nSample Lysis and Reagent Distribution: The sample is incubated with proteinase K and lysis buffer to homogenize the sample and release the DNA.\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Run file window. Input the number of samples being processed, the location of pipette tips on the deck, and the location of TruTips on the deck.\nThe automated script adds 615 \u03bcl proteinase K, 5 ml plasma, and 6.2 ml Lysis Buffer CN-L1 to each 50 ml conical tube, and will then PAUSE.\n*Remove the 50 ml conical tubes from the sample deck, vortex for 30 sec on high speed, and incubate off-line for 30 min at 60 \u00b0C in a water bath or heat block. After the conical tubes are removed from the Hamilton deck, RESUME the automated script to continue dispensing reagents into their respective plates and wells (Figure 4B and 4C):\n\t\n2 ml CN-W1 to every other well in position 9 column 1.\n2 ml CN-W2 to every other well in position 9 column 2.\n2 ml CN-W4 to every other well in position 9 column 3.\n250 \u03bcl EBA2 to every other well in position 9 columns 4 and 5.\n495 \u03bcl CN-B2 to every other well in position 10 column 1.\n1 ml EBB to every other well in position 10 column 2.\n500 \u03bcl CN-W3 to every other well in position 10 column 3.\n500 \u03bcl CN-W4 to every other well in position 10 column 4.50 \u03bcl EBA2 to every other well in position 10 column 5.\nBecause the 5 ml channels are too wide to use adjacent wells for each sample, the automated program dispenses reagents into every other well of the deep well plate in deck position 9. The mechanical arm used for the 1 ml channels also requires the use of every other well in reagent plates for the exclusion and concentration steps of the protocol.\nAfter dispensing reagents, the program will PAUSE.\n*After the 30 min, 60 \u00b0C incubation, place the 50 ml conical tubes on ice for 5 min.\n*Return the 50 ml conical tubes to their original positions within the sample carrier rack at deck position 4, and RESUME the automated script.\nAdd 12 ml Binding Buffer CN-B1 to each sample tube and mix 10x.\nLarge Volume Extraction: 5 ml TruTips are used for extracting total DNA from the lysed plasma sample.\nPick up 5 ml TruTips from position 2 for the large-volume nucleic acid extraction.\nCycle the sample mixture15 times in the 50 ml conical tube, starting at the bottom of the tube and moving 3 mm higher after each pipetting cycle. This step binds the total nucleic acid to the TruTip monolith.\nMove TruTips to the deep well plates at position 6 column 1, and cycle 1x in Wash Buffer CN-W1.\nMove TruTips to position 9 column 2 and cycle 1x in Wash CN-W2.\nMove TruTips to position 9 column 3 and cycle 2x in Wash CN-W4.\nMove TruTips to position 9 column 4 and cycle 40x at high speed to dry binding matrix.\nMove TruTips to position 9 column 5 and cycle 10x to elute the bound nucleic acids from the 5 ml TruTips. This is large-volume elution #1.Move TruTips to column 6 and repeat the step with the second aliquot of elution buffer. This is large-volume elution #2.\nTransfer elution #2 into position 9 column 5 to combine it with elution #1, and discard the TruTips.\nExclusion and Concentration: The high molecular weight DNA is removed from the extracted sample, and the remaining DNA is isolated and concentrated.\nAdd combined eluant from step 22 to position 10 column 1 and mix thoroughly 10x.\nPick up 1 ml TruTips from position 13 and cycle 20x to bind the high molecular weight DNA to the monolith.\nMove the TruTips to position 10 column 2 and cycle 5x to rinse the tip and remove high molecular weight DNA. The TruTips are retained and placed back in the tip rack at position 13.\nWith reagent tips from position 12, add 575 \u03bcl of Binding Buffer CN-B3 to the sample in position 10 column 1 and mix 10x.\nPick up the TruTips from step 25, return to position 10 column 1, and cycle 20x to bind the remaining DNA from the sample to the 1 ml TruTip.\nMove TruTips to position 10 column 4 and cycle 1x in Wash CN-W3 to remove any remaining inhibitors.\nMove the TruTips to position 10 column 5 and cycle 1x in Wash CN-W4 to rinse residual salts from CN-W3.\nRaise TruTips over position 10 column 5 and cycle air through the tips 35x to dry the monolith.\nMove TruTips to position 10 column 6 and cycle 10x in EBA2 to elute the purified, size-selected and concentrated nucleic acid.\nDiscard TruTips.\nTransfer the eluted sample from column 6 to 1.5 ml tubes in position 11. Extracted samples are ready for storage or downstream processing.", "1. Large Fixture Attachment\nRemove standard fixtures from the machine.\nMove crosshead apart to accommodate the in-house fixture.\nPlace the aluminum block (part No. 1 in Figure 1A) on the machine and securely fasten on the machine using two bolts; the hole in the center accommodates the machine load cell.\nPlace the main fixture structure (part No. 2 in Figure 1B) on the aluminum block and securely attach it to the block using 4 bolts.\nPlace a four-ton jack under the part of fixture that does not rest on the aluminum block to support the fixture (Figure 1C).\nMount the 6-channel load cell fixture (part No. 3 in Figure 1D) on the main fixture and secure it using 6 screws.\n2. Crosshead Fixture Attachment\nSet the machine crosshead to absolute zero using crosshead lift control.\nAttach first baseplate (part No. 4 in Figure 2B) to the crosshead using 7 screws with its curved edges facing the front of the testing machine.\nAttach second baseplate (part No. 5 in Figure 2C) using one pivoting screw. The screw accommodates left and right bones during testing. The second baseplate (part No. 5) is free to swivel about the pivot screw relative to first baseplate (part No. 4). Orientation of the second baseplate determines if the setup is for right or left femur.\nAttach the assembly of the two slide bearings (part No. 6 in Figure 2D) to the second baseplate (part No. 5) using 4 screws (two screws can be accessed from one side of the first baseplate). Rotate the second baseplate in such a way that the second set of screws can be accessed from the top of the first baseplates.NOTE: To change the orientation of the slides from left bone to right bone, the 4 screws on top of the first baseplate are unfastened, and then slides are rotated about the pivot screw and fastened again at the required orientation.\nManually rotate the slides which are orthogonal to 6-channel load cell by setting the machine crosshead to relative position of 65\u00b0.\n3. Instrumented Fixture, High-speed Camera, and Lighting Setup for Experiment\nSet up the instrumented bottom fixture on a standard servo hydraulic testing machine. This fixture will hold the femur and accommodate both left and right femora in fall on the hip configuration (Figure 1).\nSet up high-speed camera and lighting equipment (Figure 3A-3D).\nPosition high intensity lights on tripods with one on each side of the machine and secure them (Figure 3A).\nSet up tripods for high-speed cameras on either side of the testing machine and connect each camera to data acquisition units (Figure 3B-3C).\nWith the cameras on and connected to the acquisition unit, configure camera settings; set frame rate to 6000 frames per second (fps) and resolution to 1,024 x 512 pixels; resolution can be reduced to accommodate camera internal memory (Figure 3D).\nSet shutter to 1 frame/sec (1/6,000 fps). Also set the camera option such that the recordings begin before the actuator moves (100 ms for fast tests and 200 ms for slow tests).\nConnect the synchronizing cable between the two cameras; select trigger mode in the software setting of the cameras.\n4. Checking/Calibrating Load Cells for Proper Data Acquisition System (DAQ)\nSetting up DAQ unit\nConnect the DAQ to the testing machine, high-speed video camera, load cells, and linear potentiometer as shown in wiring schematic in Figure 4.Check the proper connection of trochanteric load cell, head load cell, linear potentiometer, 6-channel load cell, and trigger signal to the DAQ device by observing data signal traces in the view panel of the DAQ software by manually pushing on the load cell.\nVerify that the DAQ, Signal Conditioner, and Pulse Generator are all powered ON.\nConfigure the DAQ software for all signals from the load cells and the linear potentiometer. In the DAQ software, select the \"Step setup >> Configuration\" tab and set up the acquisition rate (Hz) for each signal input associated with each load cell. On the \"Triggering\" tab, select the appropriate triggering option. Video equipment should also be triggered during trial runs to ensure video/DAQ system synchronicity.\nApply a nominal load (for example a minimum of 200 lbs to a maximum of 1600 lbs) to the femoral head and trochanter load cells using the standard servo hydraulic machine to verify reasonable load cell measurements and compare to manufacturer calibration data sheets (Figure 5A).\nSimilarly, apply static loads to the 6-channel load cell by using a dead weight as shown in Figure 5B. Check the functionality and verify the performance of the 6-channel load cell (Figure 5A-5B) by calculating percent differences between measured and theoretical force and moment values. The error should be less than 5%.\n\tNOTE: All load cells must have been calibrated by their manufacturer in advance. This step only checks that the load cells are functioning, all connections are made and the signals are reasonable.\nCalibrating the linear potentiometer\nSecure the linear potentiometer fixture to the crosshead and place the linear potentiometer in the fixture (Figure 5C). Tighten screws to lock the potentiometer body and plug the connector into the DAQ unit.Manually move the actuator (25 mm) on the load frame so that the potentiometer position translates from maximum compression to maximum extension and record displacements and the corresponding voltage (for at least three data points). Plot displacement vs. voltage and fit a linear function to the data (R2\u00a0>0.95). Input the slope of the linear equation (mm/V) as the calibration factor into the \"Scaling parameter\" box of the DAQ software.\nVerify the overall testing machine setup by testing a surrogate fiberglass bone to fracture to make sure all data acquisition is functional and reasonable. This includes trochanter load cell, femoral head load cell, linear potentiometer, the six-channel load cell, and the trigger signal (Figure 6).\n5. Preparing Bones for Testing\nThaw bones at room temperature for 24 h and remove moisture, excess fat, and any remaining soft tissue using paper towels.\nPlace bone in the acrylic scanning fixture, and prepare dental cement. Measure 60 g of PMMA powder and mix with 30 g of liquid resin under fume hood until the powder has dissolved. The mixture should be pourable. Use a disposable paper cup for this process. This step is for potting the greater trochanter in an aluminum cup (Figure 7A).\nAlign the aluminum cup below the trochanter. Then, pour PMMA cement to half the height of the cup, and raise the fixture platform to fit the bone into the cup. Allow 10-15 min for polymerization.\nWrap bones in saline soaked towels to avoid tissue dryness during bone cement polymerization.\nMove bone to the test fixture in the testing machine with aluminum cup attached to trochanter (Figure 7B)Center the aluminum cup on the plate attached to the trochanteric load cell and adjust slide bearings so that the aluminum cup slightly touches the load cell. Remove the pin from the fixture to allow for rotation of the fixture\nCenter and lower the crosshead for contact with the femoral head.\nReview setup, bone position, load cell signals, and cup position. Also review DAQ device; ensure that all the equipment and load cells are connected properly, and verify that all are powered on. Check software setup for proper signal response from each load cell.\nTake pictures of the femur placed in the fixture from 2 sides.\nSet the aperture to allow enough light onto the camera sensor and control the depth of field. Check image quality by focusing on the femoral neck. This process should prevent any glare and glossy bone regions in the image that would affect capturing the fracture event.\n6. Testing to Fracture\nVerify the servo mechanical load frame is programmed for appropriate displacement control of 25 mm for the fracture test in the servo mechanical load frame for both loading and unloading.\n\tNOTE: These are manufacturer specific settings and should be input and verified in the control panel of the testing equipment according to manufacturer specifications.\nVerify lighting to minimize reflections in the video cameras, and the data acquisition system one final time.\nClick on the start icon from the control panel to initiate test sequence to fracture test femur (Figure 7C).\nTake pictures of the fractured femur from 2 sides.\nManually retract actuator and remove femur from machine.\n7. Post-fracture Preparation\nRemove bone from fixture.\nTape proximal broken end of bone to shaft, wrap in wet towels and plastic bags (Figure 7D), and then freeze at -20 \u00b0C.Preserve the bones for further post-fracture X-ray and CT imaging.\n\tNOTE: Details for these processes have been previously explained in another protocol from our group (under review at JoVE) (Figure 7E).\nSubscription Required.
