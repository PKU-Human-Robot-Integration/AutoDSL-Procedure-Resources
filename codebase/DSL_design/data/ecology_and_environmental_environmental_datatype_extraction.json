{"original_protocol": ["This study was conducted with the approval of the Faculty of Social Welfare & Health Sciences at the University of Haifa, ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained, and research was performed in compliance with Helsinki guidelines for human welfare.\nNOTE: The research is conducted at a table, using art materials and a portable, wireless and non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) recording device.\n1. Participant selection\nRecruit healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 40. For a wider range of ages, a division to sub-groups is recommended due to age related changes in heart rate variability.\nExclude participants with current or a history of heart disease as heart disease can affect heart rate variability, thus limiting the ability to examine whether change is due to the behavioral activity.\nInvite all subjects to the laboratory between 08:00-15:00, to ensure similar conditions. Set any time frame as long as the experiment can be conducted within it.\nGreet the participant and confirm that in the 2 hours before the experiment the participant did not drink coffee, eat, smoke or vigorously exercise.\nObtain written informed consent to ensure that participants know they are free to leave the experiment at any point in time without consequence and are aware of any risks and benefits to participation.\n2. Experimental protocol\nAdhere the biopatch two fingers below the sternum with 2 Ag-AgCl disposable electrodes. The ECG is sampled (1000 Hz, 16 bit) and recorded with the biopatch.\nExamine that the values of the data collected (i.e., heart rate, HRV) appear on the graphic interface ensuring that data is being collected. The software will also transmit an audio alarm when the biopatch goes offline.After the participant adapts to the environment and wears the biopatch, measure 5 min of resting heart rate in a sitting position to establish baseline HRV. Instruct the participant to sit still, and avoid chewing or talking, which affects the HRV.\nFollowing the 5 min rest to establish baseline HRV, instruct participants to fill out pencil and paper questionnaires with demographic data, a question about art making habits and the self-assessment manikin (SAM)5. Instruct participants to mark the drawing that is closest to how they feel at the current moment (See Figure 2).\nTo establish a comparable emotional state, have participants listen to 5 min of relaxing music of their choice (nature sounds, new age or classical music) before each artmaking session. The relaxing music is purposely chosen by the participant to ensure that it is relaxing for them6.\nProvide participants with a (50 cm x 35 cm) sheet of paper and instruct them to engage in a 10 min artmaking session (pencil, oil pastels or gouache paint). To reduce an order affect, randomize the order of the art materials.\n\tNOTE: Here, after drawing with pencil, the participants used oil pastels and then gouache paint.\n\t\nEncourage participants to engage in an exploration of the materials in any way they feel fit and use the entire 10 min for artmaking. Provide encouragement by reminding participants that the art product and its aesthetics are not important and that they can draw anything at all.\nPresent the pencil with a pencil sharpener and an eraser.\nInstruct participants to report their emotional state using the SAM.\nTurn on music and instruct participants to listen to 5 min of relaxing music of their choice (nature sounds, new age or classical music).Place an open box of 12 colors of oil pastels on the table and instruct participants to use them in any way they choose including peeling the wrapper and breaking the pastel if needed.\n\t\nReplace the box of pastels for the next subject if their general appearance is significantly affected by use.\nInstruct participants to report their emotional state using the SAM.\nTurn on music and instruct participants to listen to 5 min of relaxing music of their choice (nature sounds, new age or classical music).\nPresent gouache paint in primary colors (yellow, red and blue), black and white in a plastic palette, divided into 6 bowls and 4 mixing surfaces, to control the quantities of paint. In addition, provide a jar of water, a soft, flat-headed brush (size 6) and a cloth.\n\t\nTell the subjects that they can request additional paint if needed.\nProvide a short explanation of mixing colors and cleaning the brushes.\nInstruct participants to report their emotional state using the SAM.\nRemove the biopatch from the participant at the end of the session. Download the data recorded with the biopatch to the computer using the biopatch download log.\n3. Data analysis\nConvert the data to a text file that is appropriate for import to the visual analysis software (e.g., QRSTool)7, saving only the time stamp and voltage vectors, using a MATLAB script. The MATLAB script* is helpful in saving the timestamp and voltage vectors, while erasing the rest. This can be done manually but is very time consuming. The resulting text file example is presented in Figure 3.Import the text file created by the MATLAB script to the QRSTool using the graphical user interface: File | Import | (Choose File). Make sure that the sample rate 1000 Hz button is pressed. The ECG will then be graphically displayed in the window of QRSTool.\nVisually inspect the ECG series for artefacts. Identify the R component of the ECG using the QRS-tool software (See Figure 4). The software automatically detects the R spikes, by flagging all points with a red hourglass, above a threshold marked manually.\n\tNOTE: For more information contact the third author at: jallen@email.arizona.edu\n\t\nVisually inspect each ECG series alongside the identified heartbeats, time points and artefacts (missed or wrongfully identified heartbeats), which may have an excessive or missing heartbeat in the inter-beat intervals graph. Correct this manually by clicking to remove the extra heartbeat or adding one where missing.\nIn areas of data with noise, not showing an identifiable QRS waveform, divide the data into several chunks, of 30 seconds at least.\n\t\tNOTE: Remember, tails of cropped data cannot be added together. Analyze these separately and create a mean of all chunks.\nMark or divide the data according to various phases of the experiment. To do so, use the visual interface to cut off and save only the data for each event and export them separately to CMetX (described below). Divide the data based on the experiment stages described above (baseline, music listening and art making with the various materials).\nWhen all data is clean, export to CMETX by using the visual interface File | Export, or directly by a command line. This will open the CMetX viewer window with an added line with the indices of HRV.\nExport HRV indices to a CSV file for data analysisUse two indices of HRV: the estimated respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA) as a vagal or parasympathetic index and the cardiac sympathetic index (CSI) \u2013 based on a Lorenz plot that estimates sympathetic influence. Figure 4 is an example of the output provided by the CMetX software.\n\t\tNOTE: Choosing the appropriate HRV index to represent vagal or sympathetic cardiac regulation can be tricky and requires some methodologically and theoretically based decisions that are beyond the scope of this presentation. For further information we recommend reading: Allen, J. J., Chambers, A. S., & Towers, D. N. (2007). The many metrics of cardiac chronotropy: A pragmatic primer and a brief comparison of metrics8.\nEstimate HRV reactivity by subtracting the mean HRV index during music listening from the mean HRV index during the following artmaking session (i.e., positive values represent higher HRV during artmaking compared to the proceeding relaxation).\nSubscription Required.

The parents of all children included in this study provided signed and informed consent. In the study, we used the Actigraph GT3X+ device which is referred to as an accelerometer hereafter.\n1. General aspects of method development\nObtain accelerometers to evaluate PA. The accelerometer is a small (3.3 cm x 4.6 cm x 1.5 cm, 19 g), watch-like unobtrusive device that measures acceleration in three axes: vertical, antero-posterior, and medio-lateral.\nConnect the device to a laptop PC with USB cable. Use an exclusive software for data recording, processing, and analyzing.\nSelect participants according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\t\nInclude 20 children between 7-12 years of age who accept table tennis training as the Sports group. Include children who attend the table tennis club regularly, with three-to-five weekly training session,s with each training session lasting 2 h. Include children living majorly in a house or rented flat with their parents with a short home-to-club distance.\nSelect 20 children from the same class as the Sports group as an age and gender matched Control group. Children of the Control group don't attend any sports club.\nExclude participants whose parents do not know their children's PA information at school and home.\nExclude participants who were diagnosed to have any neurodevelopment disorder such as Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), etc.\n2. Initialization of data collection using the accelerometer\nDownload and run the software for the device.\nType in the duration for collecting data by clicking the button Select Start Time and entering the date (e.g., 2022/2/9) and time (e.g., 13:00).Click the button Enter Subject Info to enter the next step about demographic information setting. Type in the demographic information of the participant, including name, gender, height, weight, date of birth, ethnic, side (right), limb (waist), and dominance (dominant).\n\tNOTE: For the left-handed participants, in step 2.4 select the opposite side.\nInitialize the data collection by clicking Initialize 1 device. Make sure that the battery is charged to more than 80%, otherwise the initialization will fail. Initialize to record raw accelerations at a frequency of 30 Hz.\nInstruct the participants to wear the accelerometer on the right hip with an elastic waistband. Ensure that the accelerometer is positioned on the right mid-axilla line at the level of the iliac crest.\nRepeat step 2.2. Set the same start date (e.g., 2022/2/9) and time (e.g., 13:00), to ensure that the data from both devices is collected at the same time.\nRepeat 2.4 with the following modifications: side (left), limb (wrist), dominance (non-dominant).\n\tNOTE: For the left-handed participants, in step 2.8 select the opposite side.\nInstruct the participants to wear the accelerometer on the wrist of the non-dominant hand on a watch belt.\nRemind the participants to wear the devices all day long, except while bathing, swimming, and showering.\n\tNOTE: The duration of data collection should not be shorter than 7 days. (e.g., from 13:00, 2022/2/9 to 12:59, 2022/2/16).\nFor the raw data collected, get the data confirmed by a physician, institutional researcher, or professional coach, according to the VM chart and counts (Figure 1).\nDelete any extreme data that is unexplained (e.g., from 21:41, 2022/2/12 to 22:07, 2022/2/12, the data was zero, and cannot be explained). Delete such data from the collected raw data.\n3. Data collection from diary entriesAsk the participants to wear the device all day long. Ask the trainers to maintain a diary of table tennis training, including the exact time schedule. For the children of the Control group, no diary of training is needed.\nMake sure that the participants performed their daily routines during data collection.\nAsk the parents to maintain a diary of leisure time at home. Instruct the parents to collect the data of sleep, the time to bed, and the time of waking up in the diary.\n4. Accelerometer data output\nTake off the device from the right hip and connect it to a laptop/PC with a USB cable. Run the software of the device.\nDownload the accelerometer data of the participant, by clicking Download. Analyze raw accelerometer data in 60 s epochs.\nTake off the device from the non-dominant hand and connect it to a laptop/PC with a USB cable. Repeat step 4.2.\nRaw acceleration outcome variables for the accelerometer are based on vector magnitude (VM) counts. Confirm the accelerometer data of LTPA according to the diary of training, leisure time, and sleep.\n5. Scoring the data\nOpen the scoring page of the software (Figure 2).\nSelect Algorithms > Cut Points and MVPA > Puyau Children (2002) on the left of the page.\n\tNOTE: Other algorithms for the cut points of PA can be selected if necessary.\nClick Calculate and then Export, and the scoring output will be displayed automatically, including SBs (sedentary behaviors), LPAs (light physical activities), MPAs (moderate physical activities), and MVPAs (moderate-to-vigorous physical activities).Obtain everyday-LTPA by adding diary timing and defining leisure time (e.g., the leisure time of 2022/2/9 is from 19:00, 2022/2/9 to 21:00 2022/2/6, according to the diary). Then, define the mean VM counts during this time as 715.75, and the LTPA for this epoch as 715.75.\nAverage all the everyday-LTPAs, to get the LTPA for the participant.\n6. Statistical analysis\nUse Student's t-test to measure group differences with a P value less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Use a commercially available statistical software package to conduct all statistics.\nUse the Bland-Altman procedures to assess agreement for each PA, including MPA, VPA, and MVPA, between hip-worn and wrist-worn devices based on raw data and counts. Calculate the mean difference between the two methods of measurement and 95% limit of agreement for the mean difference calculated.\nSubscription Required.

Written informed consent was obtained either from participants enrolled in the study or their legal guardians. Figure 1 represents the protocol steps.\n1. Participant Recruitment\nRecruit patients with the following characteristics: between 7-14 years of age with refractive amblyopia and/or successfully treated strabismic amblyopia (strabismus children are only eligible to participate if misalignment of the visual axes has been successfully corrected with glasses, visual therapy, and/or strabismus surgery); with monocular best corrected distance visual acuity of \u22650.1 logMAR21; and stereoacuity measured in the 800\"-200\" range (coarse-moderate stereo-deficiency)22 according to a random-dot stereogram test23.\n\t\nTo determine \"refractive amblyopia\", consider the interocular refractive difference error by means of autorefraction under cycloplegia.\n\t\tNOTE: Anisometropic amblyopia is defined when a patient presents an interocular refractive difference error of \u22651 spherical dioptre (D), (spherical equivalent). Isometropic amblyopia is defined when the cycloplegic refractive error in each eye of \u22654.00 D hypermetropia or myopia and/or \u22652.00 D astigmatism and the interocular refractive difference error is <1 D.\nTo determine successfully treated strabismic amblyopia, check for the absence of strabismus using a monocular cover-uncover test and stimulating accommodation with a letter acuity score of 20/30 to ensure that the subject looks at the letter with the fovea when performing the fixing movement24.\nExclude patients with the following characteristics: strabismus; hyperphoria (upward deviation) of 2 prism diopters or more; nystagmus; hypermetropic anisometropia, in which the patient presents a spherical equivalent difference between the eyes of 3 diopters (or more) if corrected with glasses (to prevent aniseikonia); any ocular pathology; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and any cognitive disorder. Exclude patients without access to a computer or without internet connection at home.\n2. Visual EvaluationsPerform the Baseline Optometric Evaluation prior to beginning this section for collection of baseline data and ensure all appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\t\nMeasure best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS visual acuity chart).\nCheck for the absence of strabismus as explained in step 1.1.2.\nMeasure stereoacuity at a constant distance of 40 cm, under light illumination of 120 cd/m2.\n\t\tNOTE: Illumination control guarantees contrast consistency between dots and background in the test pattern. Patient head-to-test distance is a critical variable because it is included in the equation that sets stereoacuity result.\n\t\t\nMeasure global stereoacuity with a random-dot stereogram (to avoid monocular cues) conducted according to the test manufacturer's instructions.\nMeasure local stereoacuity using a contour test despite the presence of monocular cues with a Wirt Circles test conducted according to the test manufacturer's instructions.\nMeasure the refractive error by cycloplegic refraction (1% cyclopentolate) following Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) guidelines25,26.\nRule out any ocular pathology with an in-depth study of the anterior (slit lamp) and posterior (indirect ophthalmoscope) poles.\nConducting the optometric center first visit with patients.\n\t\nCreate a patient profile in the game service application.\n\t\t\nSet the patient's user identifier and password.\nSet the patient's interpupillary distance.\nInstall the computerized stereoscopic game on the patient's computer.\nConfigure the game by clicking on the configuration panel.\n\t\t\nSet the physical dimensions of the patient's computer screen.\nEnsure that the user is wearing the anaglyph glasses correctly (with the red filter over the left eye).\nMeasure the patient's stereopsis basal acuity using the computerized stereoscopic game.\n\t\t\nAsk the patient to play the game under supervision, as explained in section 3.4.\nConsult the result stored in the cloud using the game service application.Using patient stereopsis basal acuity, set the patient's basal level in the game service application.\n\t\t\nThe computerized stereoscopic game defines three stimulation categories, each associated with a stereoscopic acuity interval value: poor (840\"-300\"), coarse (480\" -210\") and moderate-fine stereopsis (300\" -30\"). Patients begin with the finest level at which they can identify the stereopsis stimulus. For example, in a patient with a stereo threshold of 720\", assign the poor stereopsis level on the patient's profile.\nExplain to participants how to perform the exercises at home, as explained in section 3.\nPerform check-up visits on completion of every 15 therapy sessions with the computerized stereoscopic game during the training period.\n\t\nOpen the game service application, open the patient profile and check both compliance and stereopsis results data.\n\t\t\nRemind parents and participants about the importance of respecting the working distance from the screen.\nRemind parents and participants about the importance of compliance.\nEvaluate the logMAR BCVA at distance with an ETRDS test to check for any deterioration from the starting values.\nMeasure the patient's stereopsis acuity using the computerized stereoscopic game (step 2.2.4)\nSet the patient's basal level in the game service application (step 2.2.5).\nPerform the final optometric evaluation on completion of 60 therapy sessions with the computerized stereoscopic game (end of treatment) to collect outcome data.\n\tNOTE: This evaluation reproduces the baseline optometric evaluation, stressing the measurement of global and local stereopsis.\nPerform the follow-up optometric evaluation 6 months after completion to ensure stability of the results.\n\tNOTE: This evaluation reproduces the baseline optometric evaluation, stressing the measurement of global and local stereopsis.\n3. Treatment Exercises Performed at Home\nExplain to participants that they must follow a course of training using the computerized stereoscopic game at home for sixty 8 min sessions.Explain that each session must be performed on a different day and that five sessions per week must be completed. Explain to patients that the research team will have access to their compliance and results data in the cloud.\nInstruct patients to visit the optometry center for a check-up visit after every 15 sessions, which should be completed within 3 weeks to consider compliance as 100%, and in all cases, within a maximum of 6 weeks.\nExplaining how to use the computerized stereoscopic game\n\t\nAsk the participant to sit at a distance of 80 cm from the computer screen. Make it clear that patients should not try to cheat the program by moving closer to the screen.\nEnsure that the room is dimly lit, avoiding any reflections on the computer screen.\nExplain that the program takes the form of a videogame, in which a random-dot image conceals a hidden silhouette. The silhouette can only be seen in three dimensions while wearing anaglyph glasses.\nGive the patient a pair of anaglyph glasses and explain how to wear them, focusing on which filter goes to which eye (with the red filter over the left eye).\nProvide the patient with an identifier and password to log in to the game (step 2.2.1).\nInstruct the patient to use the mouse to select which silhouette appears, selecting one figure from the four options shown at the bottom of the screen (Figure 2).\nExplain what happens after the selection of a silhouette.\n\t\t\nIf the answer is correct, the software emits a high-pitched sound, and the correct image appears in the form of a full-color picture as a reward.\nIf the answer is incorrect, the software emits a deep sound. The player still has two more attempts to find the right answer.If there are three consecutive wrong answers, the software will show the correct answer.\nExplain to the patient that after each trial, the software generates a new screen with a random-dot image concealing a new hidden silhouette.\nExplain to the patient that the hidden silhouette becomes more difficult to find as the session progresses and that this is normal.\nExplain to the patient that, once the session is complete, the software stores the outcomes in a cloud server, allowing the optometrist to track compliance and stereoacuity evolution remotely.\n\t\tNOTE: Stress the importance of a stable Wi-Fi connection and of closing the computerized stereoscopic game properly.", "This protocol follows the guidelines of the local ethics committee of the University of Marburg; for all reported studies19,20,21, approval was obtained. Obtain approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB), with special attention to potential intrusiveness of study participation on daily-life routines and with special attention to the collection of salivary biomarkers for stress.\n1. Study Design: Sampling Protocol\nDecide on the number of days, as most studies involving multiple assessments typically run from 3 d\u00a0to 3 weeks22. Choose multiple consecutive days (e.g., at least 7 d, to encompass both weekdays and weekend days) in order to gain representative insights into the daily life of the participants.\nDecide on a number of assessments per day. Distribute assessments over the day, spanning representative periods between awakening and bedtime (e.g., 6 assessments/d).\nDecide on the distribution of assessments per day (e.g., assessments can either be event-based, time-based, or a combination of these two designs)9.\nNOTE: Keep in mind that current recommendations prefer event-based procedures for the sampling of rare events only, mostly for the reason of compliance and to keep up the motivation of participants. Use a combination of event-based and time-based assessments.\n\t\nDue to the diurnal rhythm of salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase, use an event-based assessment directly after waking up.\nRelative to this assessment, schedule one subsequent assessment 30 min after waking up and schedule further fixed assessments at 12:00 h (before lunch), 14:00 h, 18:00 h, and 21:00 h (bedtime).\nNOTE: The study protocol described here scheduled the following assessments in each study: directly after awakening (event-based), 30 min after awakening, 10.0019,21/11.0020 (fixed), 14.00 (fixed), 18.00 (fixed), 21.00 (fixed).\n2. Selection of Participants\nPerform an a priori power analysis, as recommended by Bolger, Stadler, and Laurenceau23, if one has a priori knowledge on the expected effect sizes.Cautiously select the study participants and define the following inclusion criteria:\n\t\nEnsure that the participants' age range is as narrow as possible (e.g., 18 to 35 years of age) or consider it to be a confound and treat it statistically as such. Participants' Body Mass Index (BMI) should be equal to or lower than 30 (see step 3.1). The participants should either be nonsmokers or should smoke less than five cigarettes per week.\nMake sure to only include participants who do not consume drugs (no consumption of cannabis within the last 2 weeks, no consumption of any other psychotropic substances within the last 4 weeks). Furthermore, ensure that the participant does not take any medication (except for Hormonal Contraceptives (HC) in females, which should be recorded and considered within statistical analyses).\nOnly include participants who do not have any chronic somatic or psychiatric disease (according to self-reports based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 24.\nNOTE: If interested in the effects of music listening on psychobiological stress in specific patient populations (e.g., patients with fibromyalgia syndrome), please adjust these inclusion criteria (e.g., define inclusion criteria for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome based on the research criteria25,26).\nAssess the following covariates.\nNOTE: Covariates should be assessed once using paper-and-pencil questionnaires.\n\t\nDue to the assessment of biological parameters, control for BMI\u00a0and gender. Either define inclusion criteria regarding BMI and gender (e.g., include only those subjects who have a BMI equal to or lower than 30, or include only men or women), or statistically control for the influence of BMI and gender.Concerning the association between music listening and stress, control for musical expertise and music preference (e.g., by means of the Music Preference Questionnaire (MPQ))27 in order to test hypotheses on differential effects concerning the association between music listening and stress based on personal music preference and expertise.\nAsk participants to complete the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress28 and/or the Perceived Stress Scale29 to test hypotheses regarding the influence of overall stress levels on the association between music listening and current stress.\n3. Meeting with the Participants before the Assessment\nSchedule an introductory session with the participants to familiarize them with the electronic diary device, questionnaires, and saliva collection method.\nProvide participants with a mobile electronic diary device on which they can address the items occurring during the ambulatory assessment\n\t\nFamiliarize all participants with how to handle the electronic diary device.\nProvide each participant with information on how the mobile electronic diary device is used (e.g., how to turn it on and off, how to mute and unmute the alarm, how to react when an assessment is missed, how frequently to recharge it and how to start the application presenting the items).\nExplain and demonstrate all functions concerning the study.\nPrepare a study manual in which the study material, the items occurring in the ambulatory assessment, and the procedure for the collection of saliva are explained in sufficient detail. In this manual, describe each item in detail by explaining each response option.\nNOTE: Make sure to do a trial run and review the manual with each participant. Thus, provide particular instructions to the participant, both face-to-face and written in the manual, before the assessment period starts.\nProvide the participant with contact details in case of technical problems.\nInstruct the participant to start the first assessment the day following the introductory session.Set a date for the postmonitoring session after completion of data collection.\n4. Items on Music Listening\nNOTE: All items on music listening are presented via the electronic diary device.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54920/54920fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Exemplary Screenshots from Mobile Diary Devices. Using electronic diary devices, participants can be investigated in their daily lives while they go about their daily routines. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54920/54920fig1large.jpg]\nFirst, use a filter question and ask whether music listening has occurred since the last assessment.\nDefine what is meant by music listening by providing examples for music listening in daily life. Distinguish between passive music listening (e.g., background music while shopping) and active or deliberate music listening (e.g., music listening that is in the focus of attention).\nAsk subsequent items (e.g., valence, arousal, and reasons for music listening) that cover a more in-depth characterization of the music listening episode when participants report having listened to music.\n\t\nAsk for the perceived valence (ranging from sad to happy on a visual analogue scale) and perceived arousal (ranging from relaxing to energizing on a visual analogue scale) of the music that was listened to.\nAsk the participant to define two qualitative characteristics of the music they listened to using different response scales. On the one hand, ask them to rate whether the experience is sad or happy. On the other hand, ask whether the music is relaxing or energizing.\nNOTE: The ratings refer to the participant's subjective experience of the music.\nAsk the participant to try to make a rating. If this is not possible, ask the participant to choose the middle of the scale.In case the participant listens to more than one piece of music, please ask the participant to make a rating representing the majority of music listened to. That is, if the participant listens to both sad and happy music on the radio, ensure that the classification represents the predominant experience of the music.\nAssess the reasons for music listening by asking the participant to choose the main reason for music listening (among relaxation, distraction, activation, and reducing boredom).\nNOTE: We selected the reasons for music listening that have been reported most frequently in previous research5,6. Depending on the research question, other reasons may be chosen as well (e.g., emotion regulation, aesthetic enjoyment, and cognitive stimulation). However, please remember to keep the number of items to a minimum in order to maintain high compliance with the protocol.\n\t\nAsk the following questions:\nAsk if the participant listened to music in order to relax.\nNOTE: This can be due to some prior stressful event or to the general need to relax.\nAsk if the participant listened to music for activation.\nNOTE: For example, this means that music was chosen to sing along to, to move with, or to activate oneself.\nAsk if the participant listened to music for distraction.\nNOTE: Meaning, to distract from a certain topic or from certain thoughts.\nAsk if the participant listened to music because there were no other alternatives available for reducing boredom.\nNOTE: In contrast to distraction as the reason for music listening, here, music is not meant to distract from a certain topic or thoughts. Rather, music is listened to in order to pass time.\nAssess the characteristics of the listening situation.\n\t\nAsk the participant who else was present during listening to music.NOTE: In accordance to Juslin et al.6, ask the participant to choose among the following response options: \"I was alone while listening to music,\" \"Friends were present while listening to music,\" and \"Acquaintances were present while listening to music.\"\nAdditionally, ask whether the participant was in the presence of strangers while listening to music6.\nNOTE: If anyone is specifically interested in the role of social context factors on the stress-reducing effect of music listening, consider asking\u00a0the participant whether interactions with other people occurred and how these interactions are rated (negative-positive). Furthermore, assess social support/attachment to determine whether these factors moderate the stress-reducing effect of music listening.\nConsult the appropriate literature on studies investigating music listening in daily life to learn more about these context variables6,18.\n5. Assessment of Psychobiological Stress\nNOTE: Stress is a multidimensional phenomenon that is assessed via subjective self-report as well as via physiological markers of stress. At each assessment, both data on subjective stress levels and on physiological markers of stress must be collected.\nMeasure subjective stress using a single-item30 indicating how stressed they feel at the moment (e.g., on a five-point Likert scale ranging from \"not at all\" to \"very much\").\nNOTE: This item should be presented using the electronic diary device.\nImmediately after having provided subjective information on music listening and stress, collect saliva samples for the later assessment of salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase as neuroendocrine and autonomic stress markers, respectively, using standard procedures.\nNOTE: There are commercially available assays for both analytes, e.g., enzyme linked immunosorbent assays.\nPreparation of saliva vials\nNOTE: For the concomitant assessment of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase, use the passive drool method, which controls for the effects of mastication, textual stimulation, or interferences of absorbent material with assay procedures31.Prelabel the saliva vials. Use a simple, unique code for each vial.\nNOTE: This code consists of the study number + participant code + day of sampling + time of day.\nWeigh the saliva vials both before and after study participation to determine the salivary flow rate (which is calculated by determining the saliva volume (the post- to pre-weight difference) divided by the collection time (mL/min)).\u00a0\nSplit the samples according to the day of sampling by placing all samples from one day and the corresponding numbers of straws into a small plastic bag.\nSaliva Collection\n\t\nProvide participants with particular instructions for the saliva collection as follows.\n\t\t\nIn order to avoid contamination with blood, sugar, or acidity, instruct the participants not to brush their teeth within 30 min prior to saliva sampling or to have dental treatment 24 h before saliva sampling.\nNOTE: Major meals should not be consumed within 60 min prior to sampling; snacks and caffeinated or alcoholic beverages should not be consumed within 30 min prior to sampling.\nDocument the intake of food, drinks, and nicotine by means of the mobile electronic diary device by asking if the participate ate/drank/smoked within the last two hours (0: \"no,\" 1: \"yes\").\nInstruct the participants to rinse their mouth with tap water 10 min prior to sampling.\nInstruct the participants to document vigorous physical activity 2 h prior to sampling. Ask the participants if they were active. If yes, ask how active they have been during the last 2 h. Instruct the participants to respond with \"not at all,\" \"very little,\" \"moderately,\" or \"vigorously.\"Instruct the participant to store the samples at or below -20 \u00b0C as soon as possible (on the evening of each day at the latest) to prevent bacterial growth. In case participants do not have immediate access to a freezer, they should be asked to store the samples in a refrigerator in the meantime.\nCollect a saliva sample for demonstration purposes.\n\t\t\nAsk the participant to swallow once. Then, ask the participant to accumulate saliva by not swallowing for the next 2 min.\nSet a timer (2 min are usually sufficient) on the mobile electronic diary device.\nHold the vial and straw ready. After 2 min, ask the participant to transfer all accumulated saliva into the vial.\nNOTE: Participants can either use the straw to transfer all accumulated saliva into the vial, or they can transfer all accumulated saliva without the straw into the vial.\nThen, ask the participant to enter the code written on\u2028the vial as a compliance check at the end of each assessment time point.\n6. Meeting with the Participants after the Assessment\nAsk participants to return to the laboratory to hand over the study equipment after study completion (i.e.\u00a0the electronic diary device and the saliva samples).\nConduct a standardized post-monitoring interview asking for any problems that may have occurred during the study, interference of study participation with daily-life routines, and overall satisfaction with the study participation.\n7. Statistical Handling\nPrepare the data set by excluding participants with less than 50% of the assessments completed.\nCheck the data for a normal distribution. As salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase are usually not normally distributed, transform the data (e.g., using the formula ln(x) + 10).NOTE: Due to the nested structure of the data (i.e.\u00a0repeatedly-assessed music listening and psychobiological stress are nested in each person), analyze the data using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM)32 in accordance with the procedure described by Woltman, Feldstain, MacKay, and Rocchi33. Analyses should at least control for the time of day on level-1 and for BMI and gender on level-2. Calculate the amount of explained variance as an indicator for effect size using the formula provided by Singer and Willet34.\nSubscription Required.

In line with the ethical guidelines published by the American Psychological Association and the general rules of institutional review boards for ethical issues, all participants were informed in advance about the nature of the study (i.e., informed consent). This informed consent explained the nature of the research project and all potential risks and benefits to the participating persons. Also, it was clearly communicated that the data obtained from the study is anonymous and confidential and that participation is voluntary and can be stopped at any time. After the experiment, participants were always fully and extensively debriefed. As participants carried out a sequence of non-invasive, harmless tasks at separate workspaces to elicit anonymous choices, no potentially critical ethical implications of the research results were expected.\n1. (Un)Certainty Induction\nNote: This is an experiential priming method, in which participants are asked to read a paragraph describing several (un)certain events and are then asked to write how (un)certainty shapes their own lives.\nInvite participants into the laboratory. Ask them to sit down in a cubicle behind a desk and then introduce them to the paper and pencil questionnaire.\nTell the participants that they will take part in two (or more) unrelated tasks (which are in fact related to each other). This is important, so participants are ignorant about the fact that the first (priming) task actually influences the performance on the second task (choice, evaluation, etc.). Specifically state which task they have completed and which task will start next.\nTell participants that in the first task they will read a paragraph about general life events and they will then be asked to write about a personal experience.Give half of the participants the \u201cUncertainty\u201d questionnaire and half of the participants the \u201cCertainty\u201d questionnaire.\nPrint either the paragraph containing uncertain events or the paragraph containing certain events on the first page of the questionnaire.\nLet participants read the following paragraph in the \u201cUncertainty\u201d condition: \u201cOur lives are characterized by high levels of uncertainty. This seems to hold true on all levels, the societal, economical, as well as the personal. On the societal level, there is an ongoing relocation of industries and we currently experience great shifts in the political climate. Our mobility has increased to such an extent that we do not know whether where we live today will in two years time still be our home. We are also facing extremely high levels of uncertainty at the economical level: The financial markets are highly volatile, the most reliable economy \u2013 the U.S. economy \u2013 has lost its creditworthiness after the debt crisis, and the collapse of Lehman Brothers made us unsure whether our own money and pensions are save in our banks. On the personal level, our positions are more uncertain than was ever true before: long-term planning is becoming more and more difficult as permanent job positions are scarce, marriage is not certain, as people go through many different relationships, and we are nowadays confronted with so many good choice options (of what to do, where to go, what to buy) that we are constantly uncertain whether we made the best decision.\u201dLet participants read the following paragraph in the \u201cCertainty\u201d condition: \u201cOur lives are characterized by high levels of certainty. This seems to hold true on all levels, the societal, economical, as well as the personal. On the societal level we experience great levels of certainty: We can always trust on reliable healthcare when we are sick, we know for sure that the standard of education will be high from a very young age, and we are certain that the insurance will cover the repair of our car after an accident. This is also true at the economical level: Germany has, even during the current tough economical times, proven to be stable. It shows a constant increase in productivity and a minimal inflation, the banks have a very high creditworthiness, and Germany is the most stable economy of Europe. On the personal level, there are more certainties compared to other countries: For instance, if we want to study, we always have the possibility to do so. Furthermore, we are certain that the government will support us financially when we encounter problems or suffer financial hardship. Thanks to the current communication systems in place, we know for sure that we can always stay in contact with our friends and family, even when we are separated.\u201d\nLet participants then read the introduction of the writing task: \u201cNow think about how uncertainty shapes your own life. Please think of an example and write on the lines provided underneath the situation, how you felt, etc. Please provide as many details as possible.\u201dMake participants write a maximum of one page. After a maximum of 10 min ask them to stop and to continue to the next task. Make sure participants write enough. No minimum amount of writing was required, but it is likely that more writing intensifies the manipulation. Use a software program, e.g., Medialab or a market research survey software, e.g., Qualtrics, when a paper-and-pencil task is not appropriate (for instance because pens are used as the dependent measure and no unintended additional contact with pens should occur).\n\t\nFollow immediately with the manipulation check: \u201cHow do you feel right now?\u201d from 1 (very uncertain) to 9 (very certain).\nMeasure participants\u2019 mood either with one item \u201cHow do you feel at this moment\u201d, from 1 (very negative) to 9 (very positive) or with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)13.\n\t\nGive the manipulation checks (level of uncertainty and mood) either directly after the manipulation or after the dependent variable. If measured after the dependent variable, ask participants to recall the personal experience they wrote down in the first task.\nTo test whether the manipulation was successful, analyze the manipulation checks \u201clevel of uncertainty\u201d and \u201cmood\u201d with a t-test. When mood is measured with the PANAS, analyze with a MANOVA. Read the experiences that participants wrote down to get further insight into the particular situations participants described.\nUse equal numbers of male and female participants. Exclude non-native speakers, as the priming method is less effective when participants are not fluent in the language in which the priming paragraph is written. Exclude also participants that have a significant background in social psychology, as priming tends to be ineffective when participants are highly knowledgeable of priming methods.\n2. Dependent Variables\nSoftness seeking: Preference and choice of products with softer propertiesNote: These tasks are used to demonstrate that when people feel more uncertain, they prefer products with softer properties as compared to products with harder properties. When feeling certain, participants do not show such a preference.\n\t\nSelect two products that are equal in attractiveness but differ in softness (e.g., one pen with a hard grip vs. one pen with a soft grip or a soft candy (marshmallow) vs. hard candy (bonbon). Pretest this by asking a separate (between-subjects) sample how attractive and how soft the soft-grip pen (soft candy) or the hard-grip pen (hard candy) is on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not attractive at all/very soft) to 9 (very attractive/very hard). All other features of the objects should be as equal as possible (quality, color, price, taste).\nLet an experimenter blind to the hypotheses run the whole experiment, because the crucial dependent measure is a choice measure, which the experimenter has to register manually. At the start of the experiment make sure that the products (e.g., pens) are not visible.\nMake participants experience the softness of the objects unobtrusively with an unrelated filler task. For instance, let participants use both pens (and thus feel the soft versus hard properties of the pens) in a separate task by asking them to draw any two objects, one with each pen. Make sure both pens work equally well, to avoid frustration or a low quality experience with the pen.\n\t\tNote: When using food with soft versus hard, properties or anticipation of the experience seems to be sufficient, such that the soft versus hard candy does not need to be touched (and felt) before the choice is made. Counterbalance the order of pen usage to cancel out order effects on subsequent choice.Tell participants that the experiment is finished and that they can come out of the cubicle. Tell them that they can choose one of the products (e.g., pen/sweet) as a token of appreciation for their participation in the study. To present the products orderly, put the soft product (e.g., soft-grip pen) on one serving tray and the hard product on another tray. Present both trays on the desk of the experimenter.\n\t\t\nChange the position of the trays (left or right) per day (or half day), to control for right-handed preferences. Fill trays up so they never look empty.\nAsk them to choose one of the products. Let the experimenter register which of the two products was chosen (soft or hard). Ask participants which product they would take if they indicate that they do not want to have anything.\nProbe for the hypothesis and exclude participants who guessed the hypothesis.\nAnalyze the data using a Chi-square test (for choice) and a t-test (for the manipulation checks) with any statistical program (e.g., SPSS, SAS, R).\nUncertainty reduction: Certainty ratings on an ambiguous task and over time\n\tNote: This task is used to test whether the level of uncertainty induced through the priming task is reduced more after holding something soft, than after holding something hard. When certainty is primed, pen usage should not influence the level of uncertainty on a later task.\n\t\nSearch for an ambiguous task to test participants\u2019 level of uncertainty after holding something soft. Use for instance the Snowy Pictures Task (SPT)11, which is a task that consists of a set of pictures in which objects are embedded in visual snow.Select seven relatively easy items of the original SPT. Select easy items (criterion: at least 65% of the participants have to indicate the correct answer in a pretest in which people are asked to write down the image they believe to see behind the visual snow). This is done because the task should not evoke too much arousal. Use for example the boot, tent, chair, horses, fish, hand/glove, and rugby ball of the original SPT task and exclude the more difficult items (torch/flashlight, duck, fly, knife, flying saucer).\nIntroduce the task as a pretest for new material for a visual perception task.\nPrint each picture (size 8.5 cm (w) X 6 cm (h)) on one page. On the line underneath the picture, ask participants to write down which object they think is hidden behind the snow. Let participants indicate on a Likert scale from 1 (very uncertain) to 9 (very certain) how certain they feel about their answer.\nAsk half of the participants to hold something soft while doing the task and the other half to hold something hard (e.g., ask participants to do the SPT task either with a soft-grip or a hard-grip pen). Make sure that the participants do not use their own pen when using a pen as manipulation of softness and check whether the pen works well before giving them to the participant, in order to avoid frustration or a low quality experience with the pen.Ask participants to indicate their general level of uncertainty after the SPT task, using the same question as the manipulation check (How do you feel right now?). This measure is used to test the level of uncertainty over time (Time 1 = Manipulation check immediately after prime (see 1.12) and Time 2 = After participants held something soft (e.g. after the SPT task)).\nAnalyze the level of uncertainty on the ambiguous SPT task with a 2-way ANOVA with prime and pen as between-subjects variables. Analyze level of uncertainty over time with a 3-way repeated measures ANOVA with time as repeated measures (within-subject) variable and prime and pen as between-subjects variables (using SPSS, SAS, or R).\nAssess demographics, probe for the hypothesis and debrief.\n3. Reversed Link: Softness Affects Tolerance of Uncertainty in Daily Life\nNote: This task is used to demonstrate that the uncertainty-softness link is bidirectional: It is examined whether higher levels of uncertainty not only make participants seek experiences of haptic softness but whether experiences of haptic softness (e.g., holding a soft vs a hard cloth) also make participants to tolerate higher levels of uncertainty in daily life.\nSelect two different cloths that differ in texture and are as much as possible equal in quality, color and size. In the current experiment use a soft cloth (suede) and a rough cloth (fabric for furniture or curtains). Because a between-subjects design is used, minor differences between the two cloths are acceptable.\nPretest the cloths on degree of softness. Ask a separate sample of participants (between subjects) to hold the piece of fabric in their hands and to answer the question: \u201cHow does this fabric feel from 1 (very soft) to 9 (very rough).Program the experiment software (step 1.9) and write in the instructions that participants will first do a product testing task (as a cover story) and will then fill out a personality questionnaire. Ask them to read all the instructions on the computer screen carefully.\nRandomly assign half of the participants to hold the soft fabric for 1 min and the other half to hold the hard fabric. Tell them that they have to move the cloth in between their fingers in order to feel the fabric well, as they will be asked to evaluate the fabric afterwards.\nLet participants rate the quality of the fabric with three questions \u201cHow attractive do you think the fabric is?\u201d from (not attractive at all) to (very attractive), \u201cHow soft do you think the fabric is?\u201d from (very rough) to 9 (very soft), and \u201cHow do you evaluate the fabric from 1 (very negative) to 9 (very positive) to back up the cover story.\nLet participants fill out two subsets of the Uncertainty Intolerance Scale using a 9-point scale ranging from \u201cStrongly disagree\u201d to \u201cStrongly agree\u201d12.\n\tNote: The scale is a German translation of the original scale developed by Dugas, Gosselin, & Ladouceur (2001)14. Use the two subscales (\u201cBurden due to uncertainty intolerance\u201d and \u201cVigilance due to uncertainty intolerance\u201d) of the Uncertainty Intolerance Scale. These subscales focus on the inability to predict the future (e.g., \u201cI always want to know what the future has in store for me\u201d and \u201cA small, unforeseen event can spoil everything, even with the best of planning\u201d) and are therefore of interest to test the current hypothesis.\nAnalyze the data, after averaging the two Uncertainty Intolerance subscales into one measure, with a t-test.\nUse equal numbers of male and female participants. Probe for the hypothesis and debrief.Subscription Required.

Following sampling, the liver is then excised, and blood samples centrifuged to obtain plasma. Plasma samples can then be utilized to assess the net uptake and release of measured analytes to and from the liver.\nNote: Prior to starting the experimental protocol, a station for dissections and blood sampling should be set up with the necessary surgical and laboratory tools and reagents. In addition, a centrifuge should be set to cool to 4\u00b0C for the later spinning of blood samples obtained.\nLoad a 1\u00a0mL syringe with pentobarbital saline solution (50\u00a0mg/mL).\nScruff and inject the mouse intraperitoneally with pentobarbital solution (100\u00a0mg/kg).\nCritical: The correct use of anesthesia is particularly important to keep the heart continuously pumping during the blood sampling. Cervical dislocation for example, will prevent this. We have routinely used pentobarbital for this protocol, however, other anesthetics may be used. Note, however, that metabolic effects of anesthetics vary markedly.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nReturn the mouse to an empty clean cage. Anesthesia should take approximately 3\u20135\u00a0min.\nOnce under anesthesia, place the mouse supine on the dissection station.\nUsing forceps, pinch the paw to check for a reflex response. If there is no reflex response, proceed to next step. If a response is obtained, wait until there is no response.\nNote: Once the animal is anesthetized, you may work under normal light conditions if previously working under red light.\nTo open the mouse, make an incision with scissors at the base of the abdomen.

(Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nThe ligature is then pulled to the right side of the mouse to further isolate the portal vein and create tension, making it easier to draw a blood sample (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nUsing a 1\u00a0mL syringe and 27-gauge needle, collect a 150\u2013160\u00a0\u03bcL blood sample from the portal vein (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nRemove the needle from the syringe and decant the blood sample into a Microvette\u00ae blood collection tube containing EDTA. Place the tube on ice.\nCritical: If there is bleeding upon removing the needle from the portal vein, it is recommended that gentle pressure is applied to the portal vein with sterile gauze in order to stop the bleeding before moving onto the next blood sample.\nNote: Prior to decanting, the needle is removed from the syringe to prevent hemolysis of the blood sample.\nNote: The Microvette\u00ae collection tube is narrow at the bottom and particularly suited to the collection of small blood samples.\nNow tie the ligature around the inferior part of the caval vein.\nUsing scissors, cut the ribcage to expose the heart and upper part of the caudal vena cava (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).Expose the upper caudal vena cava and loosely tie a ligature around it (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nBegin inserting the catheter into the proximal caudal vena cava from the right heart chamber.\nFollowing the perforation of the heart chamber by the needle, remove the needle from the catheter.\nFurther guide the catheter with the forceps down through the vena cava so the tip of the catherter is as close to the liver as possible.\nTie the ligature around the catheter once it is in place (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nBlood is sampled from the catheter by attaching a 1\u00a0mL syringe to draw 80\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcL of blood from the catheter (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nRemove the syringe from the catheter and decant the blood sample into a Microvette\u00ae blood collection tube containing EDTA. Place the tube on ice.\nDissect the liver, rinse in phosphate buffered saline to remove excess blood and flash freeze the liver in liquid N2.\nNote: The liver may be flash frozen via the use of a freeze clamp.

Sterilize the dehusked seeds in a 50-ml conical tube filled with 40 ml of sterilization solution made with 10% bleach plus 0.1% Tween-20 for 10 min on rotating mixer at 30 rpm (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c3f830e9-07eb-4c8f-92a9-94849a7893c1/cpz1127-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nVarious steps of seed sterilization. (A) Treatment of dehusked seeds with bleach solution. (B) Sterilized seeds in water. (C) Sterilized seeds poured on to Whatman filter paper. (D) Sterilized seeds under stereomicroscope.\n3. Rinse seeds five times with sterile deionized water, gently rocking the tube for 1-2 min during each rinse step (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0003]).\n4. After the completion of the final rinsing step, remove the excess water and transfer the sterilized seeds on top of two to three pieces of dry, sterile Whatman paper (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0003] and 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0003]). Allow seeds to dry in a laminar flow hood for 20-30 min.5. Plate out \u223c25 evenly spaced seeds (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0004]) with the intact embryo facing upwards onto each plate containing CIM medium (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0004]). This orientation is important for the development of high-quality, regenerable callus compared to seeds with the embryo side plated touching the medium surface (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0004]). Wrap plates with plastic wrap or Micropore tape and place plates in a growth chamber maintained at 24\u00b0C with a photoperiod of 16 hr for 1 week (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005]) followed by 4-5 weeks incubation in the dark at 24\u00b0C.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c5c88111-43b5-4701-a7e4-782dad1430b7/cpz1127-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nSterilized seeds plated on CIM medium to initiate callus.

Remove any leaves, roots, and gelatinous or dead tissue from the callus (Fig. 5E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005]) and sub-culture calli (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005] and 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005]) onto freshly prepared CIM (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005]). Incubate newly sub-cultured calli in the dark at 24\u00b0C for 1 week (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005] and 5F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005]) prior to transformation with Agrobacterium (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0002]).\nCallus quality is the most important factor in achieving high and reproducible transformation frequencies. When possible, use the youngest available material that has reached a size of 2-4 mm. Subsequent sub-culturing of poor-quality callus onto new medium results in a significant decline in the transformation efficiency.\u2014The following protocol describes the generation of transgenic plants via A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation using callus derived from mature seeds, as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0001]. This basic protocol is divided into three steps: (i) preparation of Agrobacterium for transformation, (ii) inoculation and co-culture of explants derived from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0001] with Agrobacterium strain AGL1 containing binary plasmid, and (iii) selection and regeneration of plants.\nMaterials\nA. tumefaciens (AGL1) containing a binary vector that contains a selectable marker gene cassette comprising a ubiquitin promoter driving hygromycin phosphotransferase (hyg) e.g., binary vector pANIC10A (Mann et\u00a0al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-bib-0009]; pANIC10 vector obtained from Addgene); see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0004] for culture and preparation\nLB plates containing appropriate antibiotics (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-rec-0005])\nLiquid CIM (liquid callus induction medium; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-rec-0004])\n200 mM acetosyringone (Solution F; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-rec-0008] for Stock solutions)\nCallus generated from mature seeds of S. viridis (ME034V-1) (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0001])\nCo-culture medium plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-rec-0001])\nPlant regeneration medium plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-rec-0006])\nPlant rooting medium plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-rec-0007])\nGrowth chamber with following condition:\n               \n24\u00b0C light/dark photoperiod (16 hr/8 hr)\n21\u00b0C dark\n50-ml conical tubes (Falcon, cat. no. 352070)\nDisposable loops (VWR, cat. no. 30002-090)\nSpectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, GENESYS 30)\nSterile filter paper, 85 mm diameter (Whatman, cat. no. 1001-085)\nPetri plates, 20 \u00d7 100 mm (VWR, cat. no. 25384-342)\nAluminum foil\nSolo cups, 8 oz, 236 ml; Solo Cup Company, cat. no.

Take 2-3 loops of Agrobacterium lawn (using a 1-\u03bcl loop) and inoculate into a 50-ml conical tube containing 10 ml of liquid CIM medium supplemented with 200 \u03bcM acetosyringone. Gently shake the tube until all Agrobacteria have evenly dispersed in the liquid medium to form a homogeneous suspension (Fig. 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0006]).\n3. Measure OD600 and adjust to 0.25-0.4 with liquid CIM supplemented with 200 \u03bcM acetosyringone (Fig. 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0006]).\nOD600 measurement can vary dependent on the type of instrument. We use GENESYS 30 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher) for optical density measurements.\nInoculation of explants and co-culture\n4. Transfer \u223c100 calli from 1-week-old sub-cultured callus (step 6 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0001]) into a sterile 50-ml conical tube.\n5. Add liquid CIM containing Agrobacterium suspension (from step 3) so that the callus is completely submerged in the Agrobacterium suspension solution (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0006]).\n6. Vortex gently for 10 s and incubate for 5 min.\n7. Pour calli and Agrobacterium solution onto a stack of 2-3 sterile sheets of filter paper placed inside an empty Petri plate. Swirl plate until solution has soaked into the filter paper (Fig. 6D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0006]).8. Transfer 100 calli per petri plate from step 7 directly onto a sterile sheet of filter paper that is placed on top of co-culture medium in a Petri plate (Fig. 6E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0006]).\n9.

Transfer \u223c12 callus pieces per fresh regeneration medium plate and incubate at 24\u00b0C under a 16-hr photoperiod for 2 weeks. Repeat for additional 2 weeks under same conditions with \u223c 8 callus pieces per medium plate (Regeneration-II; see Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0001]).\n13.

When the shoots have well established primary and lateral root systems (Fig. 8C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0008]), transplant them into soil (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0003]).The shoots from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0002] that have well-developed root systems are transferred to soil for further growth and seed collection. The method outlined below offers the highest survivability potential for putative transgenic plantlets under greenhouse conditions.

Fill 1801 cells with Jolly Gardener potting soil. Do not pack or compact soil. Use RO water to thoroughly saturate the soil (Fig. 9E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0009]).\n3.

Remove plantlets individually from the Petri dish by separating them gently from the callus at the juncture between the shoot and the roots (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0010]). Remove all medium that is still attached to the roots by rinsing with RO water before placing the plantlet into the designated cell. Cover the roots with soil by gently tapping the soil around the root mass and stem base. Do not compress the soil excessively, as this can lead to root and plant stunting (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0010]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3261d7a2-ffcf-4026-b110-654b88f86f9e/cpz1127-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nTransplantation of plantlets from tissue culture medium to soil.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all plantlets have been transplanted to soil.\n6. Place flats with plantlets in the greenhouse with a Humi-Dome and spray with RO water 2-3 times daily for approximately 3 days after which the Humi-Dome is removed.\n7. Supplement bottom water as needed 1-2 times per week with Jack's 20-20-20 fertilizer mixed at a concentration of 200 ppm.\nIt takes approximately 2-3 weeks for plants to begin to develop inflorescence.\nOptionally, a total dissolved solids (TDS) meter can be used to test and confirm the ppm of the solutes in the water.\n8. Bag plants with maturing inflorescence, which have approximately \u00bc of their seeds dark in color, using perforated clear plastic bags by gently pulling the bag over the plant to the base where it can then be tied off using a 4-in. twist-tie. Secure the plants around the stake using 7-in. twist-ties (6 plants per stake).Staking will keep plants erect and allow for better airflow as plants mature (Figs. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0011] and 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0012]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6099bcdc-419f-43a3-9193-31dcdc36bad9/cpz1127-fig-0011-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 11\nGrowth of transgenic plants in soil.

(B) Close-up of inflorescence: representative example of the stage of inflorescence before stopping the irrigation and starting the plant dry-out process.\n9. Continue monitoring plants for signs of fungus, pests, and condensation near the panicle and address those accordingly.\nIf condensation is observed inside bags, reduce watering frequency, as this can lead to fungus or other plant health issues causing poor seed development or premature plant death and consequent loss of transgenic lines).\n10. Once approximately 50% of the seeds on the panicle have matured and turned darker in color, stop watering to allow plants to completely dry down prior to harvest (Fig. 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0012]).\n11. Harvest seeds from a single plant at a time by cutting off the base of the plant at the soil level using a pair of scissors while keeping the 4-in. twist tie in place to prevent the loss of any seed that has already shattered from the dry inflorescence (Fig. 13A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0013] and 13B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0013]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ead8774d-00fa-4b90-b9a1-edbe78b7af43/cpz1127-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nSeed drying and harvest.

The steps outlined below should serve as a guide for programming and conducting a delay discounting task.\n1. Setting up a Delay Discounting Task\nChoose the range of delays for which discounting will be assessed.\n\tNOTE: For example, a typical scenario would use delays that range from 1 week to 25 years. The selected delays should follow, by convention, an approximately exponential progression (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 25 years)\nChoose the maximum amount of money that will be used in the task. For example, typical amounts of money used in the task are $100 or $1,000.\nChoose the number of trials that must be completed to determine an indifference point at each delay.\n\tNOTE: For example, a typical number of trials for each delay should be between 6 to 8 trials to balance data resolution and participant fatigue.\n2. Obtain Informed Consent and Login Participant\nHave the participant sit in an isolated room in front of a computer. Ask the participant to turn off their cell phone and/or any other electronic devices.\nProvide the participant with an informed consent form to review and sign if they agree to participate in the task.\nStart the program by clicking the icon associated with the task on the computer.\nObserve the dialogue box and enter a unique participant ID tag that will be attached to the participant's data.\n\tNOTE: Because the task must be programmed by experimenters, this step could be automated by having the program assign a participant tag automatically.\n3. Provide Instructions and Practice Trials\nGive the participant instructions about what he or she will experience in the task.Provide practice trials that will not be included in data analysis.\n\tNOTE: The practice trials are designed to familiarize participants with the task design and provide participants the opportunity to ask questions if they fail to understand what is expected of them without threatening the integrity of the data collected at the beginning of the task. Practice trials should not use the adjusting procedure outlined below. Instead, practice trials should simply consist of a series of choices between immediate outcomes and delayed outcomes.\n\t\nFor example, begin the practice trials by showing a question on the computer screen and asking the participant to choose between $10 available immediately and $100 available in 1 month. Observe the choice made on the screen.\nAsk the same question on the next screen but for subsequent choices increase the immediate alternative by an increment of $10 on each trial (regardless of the choices made by the participant) until the immediate and delayed alternatives are equal to $100.\nCarry out ten practice trials to allow the participant to acclimate to the task.\n4. Assess a Single Indifference Point\nNOTE: Indifference points serve as the major dependent variable from delay discounting tasks and represent a point at which the present value of the delayed alternative is equal to that of the immediate alternative.\nDisplay the starting amounts for the delayed and immediate alternatives to participants. For the first trial, display the maximum amount as the amount for the delayed alternative. Simultaneously display the immediate amount as \u00bd of the maximum amount. Set the mouse cursor to the center of the screen (equidistant from each of the choice alternatives) at the beginning of the trial.\n\tNOTE: The side (right or left side of the screen) on which an alternative is presented should be randomly determined on each trial.Observe the participant's choice.\nAdjust the amount of the immediate alternative by \u00bc of the maximum for the second trial based on the participants choice.\n\t\nDecrease the amount of the immediate alternative for the second trial if the participant chose the immediate alternative on the first trial. For example, if the immediate amount was $50 and it was chosen on the first trial, then on the second trial display the immediate amount as $25.\nIncrease the amount of the immediate alternative for the second trial if the participant chose the delayed alternative on the first trial. For example, if the immediate amount was $50, but the delayed amount was chosen on the first trial, then on the second trial display the immediate amount as $75.\nDisplay the new amount of the immediate alternative and the constant delayed alternative to the participant and allow them to make their next choice.\nObserve the participant's choice and adjust the amount of the immediate alternative by \u00bd of the previous adjustment.\n\t\nDecrease the amount of the immediate alternative for the next trial if the participant chose the immediate alternative on the current trial. For example, if the immediate amount was $25 on the second trial and it was chosen, then on the third trial display the immediate amount as $12.50.\nIncrease the amount of the immediate alternative for the next trial if the participant chose the delayed alternative on the current trial. For example, if the immediate amount was $25 on the second trial and it was chosen, then on the third trial display the immediate amount as $37.50.\nRepeat steps 4.4 and 4.5 until the participant has made the required number of choices\n\tNOTE: The number of choices is up to the discretion of the experimenter; see discussion for further detail.NOTE: The adjustment for the upcoming trial should always be equal to the maximum amount multiplied by 2-n, where n is the trial number for the current adjustment (see Figure 1).\nMake the final adjustment to the immediate amount based on the participant's choice. Use this new amount as the indifference point for that delay.\n5. Determine Indifference Points at Each Delay\nFully repeat Step 4 for each of the chosen delays, resetting the amount of the immediate outcome and the amount of the adjustment for the first trial at each delay.\n6. Assess Delay Discounting of Qualitatively Different Outcomes (Optional)\nAsk the participant to provide an example of the chosen outcome. For example, if the chosen outcome is food then ask the participant \"What is your favorite food?\"\nObserve the participant's response and ask the participant how much a unit of the outcome costs (e.g., \"What is the cost of the preferred food?\").\n\tNOTE: If experimenters are interested in assessing differences in discounting across commodities, this step will equalize commodities in terms of value so that any differences in discounting are not due to differences in the amount being discounted.\nDisplay the values of the immediate and delayed starting values based on the price reported by the participant. Set the delayed amount of the outcome to be equal to the maximum value divided by the per unit price that was provided by the participant and then set the immediate alternative to \u00bd of that amount.NOTE: For example, if 1 serving of ice cream costs $5 and the maximum is $100 then there are 20 servings of ice cream in $100. Use this calculated value as the delayed alternative (e.g., \"20 servings of ice cream in 1 week\") and \u00bd of that amount as the immediate alternative (e.g., \"10 servings of ice cream now\").\nRepeat all of Steps 4 and 5 with the recalculated value of each outcome.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53584/53584fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.\u00a0Trial Structure of the Adjusting Amount Task. The starting value for the delayed alternative, Y, should equal the maximum. The starting value for the immediate alternative, X, should equal .5Y. If X is chosen then the value of X should be decreased on the next trial. If Y is chosen then the value of X should be increased on the next trial. The amount of the adjustment is .25Y on Trial 1 and is .5 of the previous adjustment on each subsequent trial.

Data Analysis\nImport data into any preferred data analysis program. Isolate the indifference point for each delay for each participant. Calculate the median indifference point for each delay for each group.\n\tNOTE: Calculation of median indifference points is only necessary if a group design is used.\nChoose a curvilinear regression model (see representative results for examples). Use curvilinear regression to fit the model to the (median) indifference points. This will generate relevant parameter estimates for the selected model (see below for an explanation of the parameters).\n\tNOTE: We have provided code to conduct curvilinear regression in Supplemental Materials for the statistical program R to aid the reader with Step 7.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "All methods described here were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Johns Hopkins University, where the original study6 was performed.\n1.Creating Stimuli\nCreate an initial list of concrete nouns from which prime-target pairs will be made.\nFrom a selected corpus such as Subtlex19, select approximately 500 concrete nouns and obtain variables of interest (e.g., frequency, length, concreteness, imageability, etc.) for each word.\n\t\tNOTE: Other corpuses, such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) Psycholinguistic Database18 or Corpus of Contemporary American English20, can also be used. Subtlex was used in the original study because this database is just a large Excel file and thereby easily allows for searching for stimulus generation. Other corpuses have different graphical interfaces and may require the user to input a specific text string into an input box and check the variables of interest being requested.\nPerform latent semantic analysis (LSA) between stimuli to establish semantic relatedness\nSelect LSA method or tool. A useful online tool is provided by Colorado University Boulder (http://lsa.colorado.edu/).\n\t\t\nFrom the main landing site, click on Matrix Comparison.\nEnter individual words to compare, separated by a blank line.\nClick Submit Texts.\nUsing a spreadsheet, create a matrix of LSA values between each word and every other.\nDivide stimuli into related and unrelated conditions based on LSA (Figure 1A).\nManually select 200 word pairs with high LSA values (approximately 0.5 or higher)for the \"related\" condition.\nManually select 200 word pairs with low LSA values (approximately 0.1 or lower) for the \"unrelated\" condition.NOTE: The experimenter may need to manually inspect word pairs to ensure that the semantic relation makes sense for the category. Some word pairs may have high LSA ratings but the semantic relatedness may not be immediately apparent to participants. Similarly, some may have low LSA ratings but may be semantically related in other ways.\nWhen creating related and unrelated pairs, manually match words on frequency, length, and any other variables that have been noted to be relevant in the literature (e.g., direction of association7,8) or that are of interest for the specific study. Match words as closely as possible on the variables of interest (e.g., within 1-2log10 frequency units; within 1-2 letters or syllables).\nDivide stimuli into word and picture modalities (Figure 1A).\nWithin the stimulus file in the spreadsheet, add another column of \"condition\".\nIn the \"condition\" column, label 100 of the related pairs and 100 of the unrelated pairs as \"picture\" condition. Label the other remaining stimuli as \"word\" condition.\nObtain picture stimuli.\n\tNOTE: Picture stimuli may be obtained from online sources (e.g., Google image searches) or from other sources available to the experimenter.\n\t\nSelect 2\u20133 pictures to represent each word.\nPerform initial pilot testing by having one or more independent raters (e.g., students, research assistants who have not been involved in stimulus development) decide which picture best represents the concept.\n\t\t\nOpen all potential picture files at once using a photo viewer program, then read the word aloud and ask the rater to choose the most representative picture. Record each rater's responses for every word.\nFor each word, identify the picture that the majority of raters selected as best representing the concept, and use this file as the stimulus for that word. If no majority exists, select a different array of pictures and repeat step 1.5.Using GIMP (or another photo editing program of choice), scale pictures to all be the same size (approximately 400 pixels or 3\u20135 inches height or width).\n\t\tNOTE: The precise size of the pictures may differ depending on the size of the monitor stimuli will be presented on. Horizontal and visual angle of the stimuli should be between 7 and 13\u00b0.\nPerform pilot testing\nPilot test word and picture pairs by asking 3\u20134 independent raters (e.g., students, research assistants who have not been involved in stimulus development) to rate each pair as related or unrelated.\n\t\t\nProgram the experiment in E-Prime (or other stimulus presentation program of choice) to present both words on the screen at once, either one above the other or side by side. Ask participants to rate the words as related or unrelated by pressing a button (e.g., 1 for related, 2 for unrelated). See the E-Prime manual21 for details on how to program an experiment in this software package.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Pilot testing can take place in the lab where the experimental testing will take place, or at any computer running the stimulus presentation program. No special room is required.\nRepeat pilot testing (with new independent raters who have not seen the stimuli) until a set of words and pictures is obtained with reliable ratings of related and unrelated. Obtain a total of 100 related word pairs, 100 unrelated word pairs, 100 related picture pairs, and 100 unrelated picture pairs.NOTE: It has been suggested that investigators using the N400 component to investigate cognition in clinical populations collect a minimum of 40 usable trials per trial type to elicit a reliable effect22. Anticipating that some trials will be lost during the data cleaning process, the number of trials included in the paradigm should be increased. In prior work using this specific paradigm 6, 100 trials per trial type was more than enough to ensure robust N400 effects on both an individual and group basis. Because the N400 component is similar between words and pictures10, this estimated number of trial types is recommended to be kept consistent between modalities.\nRetain an additional 8 pairs (4 words, 4 pictures) for a practice session (see step 2.2.1below)\n2. Task Programming\nCreate stimuli lists.\nFrom the final set of stimuli, sort stimuli into 8 blocks. Modality (picture/word) should be blocked (4 blocks each).\nWithin each block, ensure an equal number of related and unrelated stimuli.\nManually pseudo-randomize presentation lists within each block such that there are no more than 5 related or unrelated stimuli in a row, and pairs next to each other are not semantically related. Avoid trials such as \"carrot-broccoli\", \"apple-pear\" immediately next to each other.\nProgram the task using E-Prime, or other stimulus presentation software of choice.\n\tNOTE: Steps described here are specific to E-Prime and NetStation, and will differ if another stimulus presentation software or EEG acquisition software is used. Please see the E-Prime manual21 and the E-Prime Extensions for NetStation tutorial23 for more specific details on how to program an EEG experiment in this software package and how to enable communication between E-Prime and NetStation.\n\t\nProgram two practice sessions for the picture and word blocks (4 pairs each), to be performed before the experimental testing begins.Program an instruction screen at the beginning of the practice session to read: \"You will see two words presented on the screen one after the other. Please try to sit as still as possible and do not blink while the words are being presented. After the pair is presented, you will see a black cross on the screen. When you see the black cross, please indicate if the words were related or not. Press button 1 if the words ARE related. Press button 2 if the words are NOT related. Press any key to start the practice session.\"\nFor each of the word stimuli, double-click on the TextDisplay icons in the experiment structure. Click the Properties icon at the top left. Under the Font tab, select Courier New font size 28. Under the General tab, select ForeColor as black and BackColor as white to present the words in black font on a white background.\n\t\tNOTE: The specific font size may need to be amended depending on the size and resolution of the monitor used for presentation. Horizontal visual angle of the words should be between 1 and 6\u00b0.\nFor each of the picture stimuli, double-click on the Slide icons in the experiment structure. Click the Properties icon at the top left. Under the General tab, select BackColor as white to present pictures on a white background.Program each trial to present the following stimuli in this order: a red pre-trial fixation cross (400 ms); stimulus 1 (1,000 ms); interstimulus interval (blank white screen; 300 ms); stimulus 2 (1,000 ms); blank screen (400 ms); intertrial interval (black fixation cross; randomly jittered between 1,000\u20131,400 ms in 100 ms intervals, average 1200 ms); see Figure 1B. To set durations, double-click the TextDisplay or Slide icons in the experiment structure and hit the Properties button on the top-left of the window. Set the duration under the Duration/Input tab.\n\t\tNOTE: The blank screen is included before the intertrial interval to provide a visual break between the second stimulus and the black cross, and to provide a subtle prompt for the upcoming semantic relatedness judgment.\nProgram a TextDisplay object called \"Break\" after each block is completed saying \"End of block, please take a break\"\nInclude parameters for communication between E-Prime and NetStation. See the E-Prime Extensions for NetStation manual23 for specific instructions on how to include this information.\nFor each \"word1\" or \"word2\" Text Display object, select the object in the Experiment structure. Under the \"Properties\" window, set the Tag as \"WRD1\" or \"WRD2\", respectively.\nFor each \"picture1\" or \"picture2\" Slide object, set the Tag as \"PIC1\" or \"PIC2\", respectively.\nUnder \"Unreferenced E-Objects\", create a new List called \"CellList\". Enter the cell numbers as: 1 = picture related; 2 = picture unrelated; 3 = word related; 4 = word unrelated. Within the trial list for each block, include a column called \"CellNumber\" and enter the corresponding cell numbers for each trial according to condition and modality.\n3. EEG Testing\nNOTE: The specific procedures described here are for an EGI system. Procedures may differ if other systems are used.\nPrepare for EEG testing.Mix 2 teaspoons (10 g) of potassium chloride with 1 quart (1 L) of water and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of baby shampoo in a clear plastic bucket to create electrolyte solution\nMeasure circumference of participant's head, passing through the inion and nasion, to determine appropriate net size. Select the appropriate sized net according to the participant's head circumference.\nImmerse the electrodes in the electrolyte solution, ensuring that all sponges are fully submerged, and let soak for at least 5 minutes.\nApply EEG net.\nHave participant sit comfortably in a chair, facing the experimenter. Explain to the participant that you will be putting the net on now, then will adjust it and check the signal before beginning the test.\nPlace towels around participant's shoulders. Instruct participant close their eyes, then apply net to participant's head. Adjust the net and tighten ties to ensure a snug fit to participant's head.\nWork through all electrodes to seat them against the scalp. Use a sweeping motion with the electrode to move hair away. Rewet sponges using a pipette if necessary.\nOnce all electrodes have been seated, check impedances. Reseat or rewet any electrodes with impedances above 50 kiloohms (k\u03a9).\nRun semantic priming experiment during EEG recording.\nOnce the net is applied, impedances have been checked, and the participant is ready to begin, start the semantic priming task.\nReiterate the instructions to participants before testing. Instruct participants to judge whether the word or picture stimuli are related or unrelated by pressing a button on a keyboard or button-box. To avoid motor artifacts confounding the EEG signal, instruct participants to wait to make their response until the second stimulus has disappeared from the screen and the black cross has appeared.\nRun the practice session at least once to ensure that participants understand the task.After every 2 blocks, during the break, rewet electrodes and recheck impedances.\n4. EEG Preprocessing\nOpen NetStation Tools.\n\tNOTE: The steps described here are specific to preprocessing in NetStation 5. See the NetStation 5 User Manual24 for more details on how to use NetStation Tools. Other preprocessing packages may include EEGlab, ERPlab, FieldTrip, or other software of the experimenter's choice. Note that preferred order of preprocessing steps may differ between software packages. Observation of an N400 effect should not differ based on choice of analysis package.\nFilter the data.\nAt the bottom of the NetStation Tools window, create a new filtering tool by selecting \"Filtering\" in the 'Create' drop-down menu. Rename the tool appropriately.\nSet the highpass filter to 0.1 Hertz (Hz) and the lowpass filter to 50 Hz.\n\t\tNOTE: The highpass filter can be lower than 0.1 Hz but it is not advised to exceed this cutoff, to avoid risk of introducing spurious effects25. A lowpass filter as low as 30 Hz can be used.\nSave the tool, then drag the original EEG recording file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nSegment the data into trials.\nCreate a new \"Segmentation\" tool and name it appropriately.\nUnder \"Categories to create\", hit the plus sign to create a new category and rename it \"picture related\". Drag the \"Code\" icon into the \"Create category based on criteria\" box and set it as \"Code is PIC1\" to time-lock to the presentation of stimulus 1. Drag the \"Key Code\" icon into the \"Create category\" box and set it as \"Key Code cel# is 1\".\n\t\t\nTo include only correct trials, drag another \"Key Code\" icon into the \"Create category\" box and set it as \"Key Code eval is 1\".At the bottom of the window, set the segment length to \"Extend segment 100 ms before and 2,300 ms after\".\n\t\tNOTE: Segments may be time-locked to the onset of either the first or second stimulus. If locked to the first stimulus, segments should extend 100 ms before to 2300 ms after (to include presentation duration of both stimuli (1,000 ms each) plus inter-stimulus interval (ISI) time (300 ms)). If locked to the second stimulus, segments should extend 100 ms before to 1,000 ms after.\nClone the category by hitting the \"Clone\" button and rename it \"picture unrelated\". Set the Code to PIC1 and the Key Code cel# to 2.\nClone the category and rename it \"word related\". Set the Code to WRD1 and the Key Code cel# to 3.\nClone the category and rename it \"word unrelated\". Set the Code to WRD1 and the Key Code cel# to 4.\nSave the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nPerform artifact detection.\nCreate a new \"Artifact Detection\" tool and name it appropriately.\nUnder \"Artifact Detection Settings\", hit the plus sign at the bottom of the window to add a new setting. Select \"Bad Channels\" from the dropdown menu under \"Operation\". Leave all of the default settings (max-min > 200 microvolts (\u00b5V); Entire segment; Moving average of 80 ms).\nAdd a new setting and select \"Eye Blink\" from the \"Operation\" dropdown menu. Leave all of the default settings (max-min > 140 \u00b5V; window size 640 ms; moving average of 80 ms).\nAdd a new setting and select \"Eye Movement\" from the \"Operation\" dropdown menu. Leave all of the default settings (max-min > 55 \u00b5V; window size 640 ms; moving average of 80 ms).Save the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nOpen the resulting file in NetStation Review and scroll through every trial by hitting the arrow buttons under the \"Categories\" menu on the right side-bar. Mark trials as good or bad by hitting the green or red circles, respectively. When done, close the file to save the results.\nPerform bad channel replacement.\nCreate a new \"Bad Channel Replacement\" tool and name it appropriately. No parameters need to be set by the user for this tool, so save the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nPerform single-subject averaging to collapse over trials.\nCreate a new \"Averaging\" tool and name it appropriately. Under \"Averaging Settings\", select \"Handle source files: Together\" and \"Handle subjects: Separately\".\nSave the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nReference data to the average reference26.\n\tNOTE: The average reference is used here because EGI provides dense-array EEG (128 and 256 channels). It has been suggested that an average reference be used with dense-array recording systems26; other semantic priming ERP studies using 128-channel or 256-channel nets have used the average reference6,27,28. Other reference choices include the average of the right and left mastoids, the nose, or the earlobe29. There is no optimal choice of reference electrode, and the experimenter should note that choice of the reference electrode may affect the resulting ERP waveforms26,29.\n\t\nCreate a new \"Montage Operations\" tool and name it appropriately.Select the appropriate net from the dropdown menu under \"List Montages for Sensor Layout\". Select \"Average Reference\" and make sure the \"Exclude bad channels from reference\" box is selected. Save the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nPerform baseline correction using the first 100 ms of the segment10,28.\n\tNOTE: A baseline period of 200 ms can also be used29.\n\t\nCreate a new \"Baseline Correction\" tool and name it appropriately.\nUnder \"Baseline Correction Settings\", select \"Select baseline from portion of segment\", \"Select baseline with respect to segment time = 0\", and \"Baseline begins 100 ms before time zero and is 100 ms long\".\nSave the tool, then drag the most recent preprocessed file into the \"Input Files\" box at the top left of the window and hit \"Run\".\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57217/57217fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental examples and timeline.

The final volume of medium in each well is exactly one milliliter, and all nutrients excepts for the glucose are the same among the different experimental samples.\nCritical: One milliliter, neither more nor less, of media in each well of 6-well plate is critical for depleting the plant\u2019s endogenous sugar in this liquid culture system. Less than one milliliter will not efficiently block the carbon dioxide absorption by the plant seedlings, which may then trigger weak photosynthesis activity in the seedlings and cause insufficient sugar depletion. More than one milliliter medium in the well might cause undesired hypoxia responses.\nPhenotype observation and analysis of sugar depletion seedlings\nTiming: 2\u20134\u00a0days\nAnalysis the root growth phenotype in the sugar depletion seedlings\nCapture the photos of the seedlings growing in sugar-free or sugar-containing medium at 1 to 4 DAG (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1137-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nNote: EdU staining is a stable chemical labeling method. It is not necessary to observe the EdU signal right after the last washing step. But we recommend finishing the observation within 12 h.\nAnalyze the root meristem cell proliferation activity by measuring the fluorescent intensity and counting the number of EdU staining dots to evaluate tnitrogen starvation depletion on root meristem activity (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1F).\nNote: More detail information for the EdU staining assay please refer to https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/C10350#/C10350[href=https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/C10350].\nNote: Besides EdU staining, other optional methods could also be used to monitor the cell proliferation activity in the root apical meristem, such as using the cell cycle reporter lines pCYCB1; 1::GUS (Li et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), or PlaCCI (Plant Cell Cycle Indica tor) (Desvoyes et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: In addition to the root apical meristem, the cell proliferation activity in the shoot apex is also decreased to a very low level in 4 DAG glucose depletion seedlings (Li et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nLiquid culture system for Nitrogen-TOR signaling study\nPreparation mitotic quiescent shoots by inorganic nitrogen depletion\nTiming: 10\u00a0days\nPrepare inorganic nitrogen depletion seedlings with mitotic quiescent shoots.\nAdd 1\u00a0mL of 1/4 MS nitrogen-free or nitrogen-containing liquid medium in each well of 6-well plates.Note: 6-well plate is highly recommended for this assay. To fit the experiments that need less or more plant materials, 12-well or 9\u00a0cm round plates could also be used. But the volume of media per well should to be scaled up or down based on the size of the wells.\nPlant 10 surface-sterilized WT or pCYCB1; 1::GUS Arabidopsis seeds in each well.\nNote: The number of seeds for each well should be identical for each biological experiment and not exceed 15 seeds.\nGrow the plants in an environment-controlled growth room or chamber at 22\u00b0C, 65% humidity, and 75\u00a0\u03bcmol m \u20132 s \u20131 light intensity under a 12\u00a0h light/12\u00a0h dark photoperiod for up to 10 DAG.

Refreshing the medium before treatment is to make sure the final volume of growth medium in each well is exactly one milliliter, and all macro- and micro-nutrients excepts for nitrogen are the same among different experimental samples .\nPhenotype observation and analysis of nitrogen depletion seedlings\nTiming: 10\u00a0days\nAnalysis of shoot growth phenotype in the inorganic nitrogen depletion seedlings\nObserve the shoot phenotype every day and capture the photos of the seedlings growing in nitrogen-free or nitrogen-containing medium at 4 to 10 DAG under a Leica stereoscope microscope (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).

This is the set up for the positive control. 9 DAG nitrogen depletion seedlings pretreated with DMSO for 1\u00a0h before recovery with 1\u00a0mM KCl (0.0075% (w/v)), or pretreated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM Torin2 for 1\u00a0h before recovery with 1\u00a0mM KNO3 (0.01% (w/v)), respectively, are used as the negative controls.\nNote: For the quantification of GUS staining intensity, GUS staining time is important in this step. A shorter time may cause insufficient staining, longer time may lead to unspecific staining.\nDe-stain the seedlings with 75% (v/v) ethanol at room temperature (23\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C), add 3\u00a0mL of 75% (v/v) ethanol in each well of 6-well plate and replace the ethanol every hour until the leaves of seedlings turn transparent and white.\nObserve the GUS staining in the shoot apexes and capture the photos using a Leica microscope (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2D). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nNote: The cell division activity in leaf primordium is continually decreased from 4 to 10 DAG.Note: In the sugar depletion system described above, both the root apical meristem activity\u00a0and shoot apex cell division activity are decreased to a very low level after 4 DAG. However, for the inorganic nitrogen depletion system, only the shoot apex cell division activity is decreased to a very low level after 9 DAG. The root apical meristem cell division activity still remains at a relatively higher level, which might be caused by nitrogen nutrient remobilization between the shoot and root parts ( For details, see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A\u20131D, (Liu et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])).\nAnalyze the GUS staining area in shoot apexes by software image J to evaluate the effect of nitrogen depletion on cell proliferation activity in the shoot apex (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2E).\nProtein blots analyses of TOR activity based on P-T449 level of S6K1\nTiming: 1\u20132\u00a0days\nTo investigate tnitrogen starvation /nitrogen starvation on endogenous TOR kinase activity, we monitored TOR kinase activity based on the phosphorylation of T449 in the TOR-conserved substrate ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1, (Xiong and Sheen, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]); Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G, 1H, 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F, and 2G).\nPrepare sugar/ nitrogen depletion and sugar/ nitrogen recovery samples of 35S::S6K1-HA as described above.\nNote: 10\u00a0mg of plant powder is enough for 3 rounds of protein blots analyses. The collected samples can be stored at \u221280\u00b0C for up to 30\u00a0days.\nNote: The 35S::S6K1-HA transgenic line (in Col-0 background) shows no obvious phenotype compared with Col-0, and has been used to monitor the in vivo TOR kinase activity in multiple studies (Cai et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Fu et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Li et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Liu et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; O'Leary et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Xiong et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Xiong and Sheen, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).Note: In this step, positive controls, e.g. sugar/nitrogen recovery samples, and negative controls, e.g. 5\u00a0\u03bcM Torin2 (TOR kinase specific inhibitor) treatment samples are strongly recommended.\nNote: In addition to S6K1-pT449, as an alternative method, RPS6-pS240, a direct phosphorylation site of S6K1, was also used to monitor the endogenous TOR kinase activity in recent years (Dobrenel et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nGrind the samples into fine powder with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen.\nAdd 60\u00a0\u03bcL of 2\u00d7 SDS protein extraction buffer in 10\u00a0mg plant powder and vortex for 15 s.\nBoil the protein extracts at 95\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min.\nSpin at 13523 X g for 2\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.\nTake 20\u00a0\u03bcL of the supernatants and load onto an 8% SDS-PAGE gel.

The anti-HA antibody we used in step 35 is a conjugated-HRP anti-HA antibody. So it does not need to incubate with the secondary antibody before incubation with chemiluminescent subatrate.\nWash the membrane with TBST buffer 3 times with agitation (10\u00a0min each time), and incubate the blot with 2\u00a0mL SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate for 5\u00a0min in the dark.\nExpose to film for 30\u00a0s to 1\u00a0min and develop the film in an ECOMAX X-Ray film processor with developing solution and fixing solution in the dark room. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]", "The following procedures were approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from the caregivers of all infants. We recruited infants being raised in environments with more than 50% exposure to English11,17. Infants in all experiments first listened to a soundtrack in which we manipulated their exposure to either lemur vocalizations or backward speech; they then participated in an object categorization task. What varied across infants was (a) the kind of signal they heard in the exposure manipulation and the categorization task (either lemur vocalizations or backward speech) and (b) the extent of the exposure phase (either brief exposure in the lab or prolonged exposure at home). For all infants, the categorization task took place in the lab.\n1. Materials\nHow to create the exposure manipulations\nSelect 8 distinct samples of lemur vocalizations and 8 distinct samples of backward speech, each 2 to 4 s in duration. Together, the 8 samples should yield 30 s of each acoustic signal. Ensure that the lemur and backward speech segments are matched as closely as possible for duration (e.g., ~3 s in duration) and for mean frequency (e.g., ~300 Hz).\n\t\t\nTo obtain lemur vocalizations, search a database of animal vocalizations or contact a researcher who collects animal vocalizations.\nTo create backward speech segments, use a laptop and a software program (e.g., Audacity) to (1) record a research assistant speaking ~3 s sentences in infant-directed speech and (2) temporally reverse (in Audacity: Effect > Reverse) each speech segment.\nChoose a piece of classical instrumental music that is longer than 4 min. Here, we used the first 4 min of Beethoven's String Quartet in C Minor, Op 18 No. 4: III. Menuetto.Use an audio editing software program (e.g., Audacity) to import the music (in Audacity: File > Import) and select a portion of the piece that is approximately 4 min in duration (highlight and delete the remainder of the piece).\n\t\t\nCreate 2 distinct soundtracks by inserting (i.e., copying and pasting) the 8 selected segments of each type (lemur vocalizations or backward speech) into the musical soundtrack.\nTo create the \"Lemur\" soundtrack, open the 8 lemur vocalization sound files in the same software program (e.g., Audacity) and insert them into the file with the music.\n\t\t\t\nTo do so, highlight an entire lemur vocalization, navigate to Edit > Copy, place the cursor in the music file, and navigate to Edit > Paste. Insert the vocalizations at irregular intervals throughout the soundtrack. Do not place them at musical phrase boundaries. Do this twice for each lemur vocalization, inserting them in a pseudorandomized order to ensure that no 2 identical vocalizations occur in a row. Together, this yields a 5 min loop (4 min of music, interspersed with 1 min of lemur vocalizations).\nRepeat this 5 min soundtrack so that the entire soundtrack lasts approximately 10 min. To do so, highlight the entire 5 min section, navigate to Edit > Copy, place the cursor at the end of the 5-min section, and navigate to Edit > Paste.\nTo create the 10 min \"Backward Speech\" soundtrack, replace each lemur vocalization in the Lemur soundtrack with a selected segment of backward speech, using the same pseudorandomized order.\nHow to create the categorization taskVisual materials: Create 2 sets of line drawings by hand. In each set, include 9 members of the same object category (here, use 9 distinct drawings of dinosaurs and 9 distinct drawings of fish). Use a different bright color for each drawing within a given category. Scan these drawings onto a computer and save them as image files. Note that the drawings should be unfamiliar objects to infants at the ages tested.\nAcoustic materials: Select one lemur vocalization and one backward speech segment that were not included in either of the exposure manipulations (1.1.3). Match the lemur and backward speech segments as closely as possible for duration (e.g., ~3 s in duration) and for mean frequency (e.g., ~300 Hz).\nProgram a task in MATLAB that includes a familiarization phase and a test phase; this task will be projected onto a 5 ft by 5 ft screen in front of the infant.\n\t\t\nProgram the familiarization phase such that 8 of the visual exemplars from a single category (e.g., 8 dinosaurs, each a different color) appear sequentially. Each exemplar should appear for 20 s, on either the right or left side of a screen, in alternating fashion. Create 2 distinct versions, pairing each familiarization exemplar with one of the acoustic stimuli below (\"Lemur\" and \"Backward Speech\" conditions, respectively). In both conditions, the acoustic stimulus should occur twice on each familiarization trial; once when the visual exemplar appears, and once again 10 s later.\n\t\t\t\nIn the Lemur condition, program each familiarization exemplar to appear simultaneously with a lemur vocalization.\nIn the Backward Speech condition, program each familiarization exemplar to appear simultaneously with a backward speech segment.During the test phase, present the 9th exemplar from the familiar category (e.g., another dinosaur) and an exemplar from the other category (e.g., a fish). These two images should be identical in color and presented simultaneously (one presented on the right and the other on the left side of the screen) in silence for 20 s.\nIn programming the categorization task, counterbalance (1) which category will be presented during the familiarization phase, (2) the side on which the first familiarization image will appear, and (3) the side on which the novel and familiar test images will appear.\n2. General Procedures\nExposure phase\nPlace the infant close to the caregiver or on their lap in a quiet area. Place a laptop or tablet within the infant's viewing range (from 1 to 4 ft from the infant).\nUse the laptop or tablet to present either the Lemur or the Backward Speech soundtrack.\nCategorization task\nIn a semi-darkened test room in the lab, seat the caregiver on a chair 4 ft from a 5 ft by 5 ft screen. Connect the laptop with the categorization task programmed in MATLAB to (1) the screen that will display the categorization task and (2) a projector that will project the task onto the screen.\nSeat the infant on the caregiver's lap, facing forward.\nInstruct the caregiver to avoid influencing the infant's behavior in any way. More specifically, instruct them to remain quiet and still throughout the duration of the task and to keep their infant centered, using their midline as a guide. Provide caregivers with a pair of blacked-out glasses to ensure that they cannot see the visual materials.\nTurn on the projector.\nTurn on recording equipment to capture the infants' behavior throughout the task.Begin the categorization task by pressing \"Run\" in MATLAB: Present the Lemur condition if the infant was exposed to the Lemur soundtrack and the Backward Speech condition if the infant was exposed to the Backward Speech soundtrack.\nCoding (categorization task only)\nCode the onset and offset of each infant's left and right looks during both the familiarization and test phases.\nExclude infants who (1) look at fewer than 6 of the familiarization exemplars; (2) look during less than 40% of the familiarization phase. Also exclude infants if there is parental interference, experimental error or technical failure, or if their performance at test is greater than 2 SD from the mean.\nAnalyses\nFor the familiarization phase, calculate the total the amount of time each infant looked at the familiarization objects.\nFor the test phase, calculate a preference score for each infant: (total looking time to novel test image)/(total looking time to both test images).\n3. Experiment 1: Brief Exposure to Lemur Vocalizations\nParticipants\nRecruit 14 infants at 6 to 7 months of age.\nProcedure\nInvite the caregiver and infant into a quiet, comfortable room. In our lab, this room is adjacent to the testing room.\nExposure manipulation: Play the Lemur soundtrack once, with the music visualizer (e.g., iTunes) present on the screen.\nCategorization task: When the soundtrack finishes, guide the caregiver and infant into the testing room. Begin the categorization task (Lemur condition).\n4. Experiment 2: Brief Exposure to Backward Speech\nParticipants\nIdentical to Experiment 1.\nProcedure\nInvite the caregiver and infant into a quiet, comfortable room.\nExposure manipulation: Play the Backward Speech soundtrack once, with the music visualizer present on the screen.\nCategorization task: When the soundtrack finishes, guide the caregiver and infant into the testing room. Begin the categorization task (Backward Speech condition).5. Experiment 3: Prolonged Exposure to Lemur Vocalizations\nParticipants\nRecruit 14 infants at 4.5 months of age.\nProcedure\nBy phone, invite the caregiver to participate in a 6 week long study. Explain that the study requires them to expose their infant, at home, to a 10 min soundtrack that contains 8 min of music and 2 min of lemur vocalizations (i.e., Lemur soundtrack). Explain that the study lasts for 6 weeks, beginning when the infant is 4.5 months and ending when the infant is 6 months of age.\nProvide caregivers with this precise tapering schedule7,8,18\nWeek 1: Play the soundtrack to infant once a day, every day.\nWeek 2: Play the soundtrack to infant once every other day.\nWeek 3: Play the soundtrack to infant 3 times during the week.\nWeeks 4-6: Play the soundtrack to infant 2 times per week.\nTo ensure the fidelity of the exposure manipulation throughout the 6 week exposure manipulation, share with caregivers an online interactive document that (a) outlines their role at every step throughout the 6 week period and (b) asks them to record each date and time at which they played the soundtrack to their infant.\nSend weekly reminders by phone or email to keep caregivers engaged and on track.\nDuring Week 5, schedule a lab visit for the following week (Week 6). Instruct caregivers that infants should listen to the soundtrack 2 to 4 days before their scheduled lab visit; infants should not listen to the soundtrack either on the day of or the day preceding their visit.\n\t\tNOTE: At the lab visit, there is no exposure manipulation: Infants participate only in the categorization task from Experiment 1 (Lemur condition).\nSubscription Required.

The software, imFLUX \\(YoungeUSA), controls several basic components of this system by adjusting the power supply, imaging with a digital camera, and managing the main component: the optrodes. \n   The following describes the construction of the measuring system: A LED power supplier controls the voltage signal to a blue LED \\(503\u2013505 nm). A 20\u00d7 microscope \\(Newport, USA) objective focuses light from the LED onto the optical fiber, which is coupled to a blue filter leading the excitation light to the MicroTip-Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor \\(World Precision Instruments, USA). Fluorescence emission is conducted by the fibers and split by the fiber coupler again. When the red fluorescence signal reaches the PMT \\(Hamamatsu, Japan), the signals are transformed into electrical signals and conducted into a Lock-in-Amplifier \\(SRS 530). Then, the phase shift and fluorescence intensities are recorded by the computer and analyzed by imFLUX \\(YoungerUSA\uff0cUSA). \nPROCEDURE\nExperimental measurements\n1. Calibration of the optrode: We calibrated the optrode in the calibration medium with two different concentrations of oxygen \\(0 and 21% oxygen). The phase angles of the fluorescence signals of these two concentrations were measured and a linear slope was calculated. ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n  2. Equilibration of plant material: The 4-day-old seedlings were dipped into the measuring buffer \\(\u00bd MS liquid medium) for 30 minutes before measuring.3. Immobilizing the plant material: The measurement of oxygen flux with the optrode occurs in an aqueous environment; therefore, we needed to immobilize the sample to avoiding unwanted stirring, and movement. The method used to immobilize the sample must be gentle enough to prevent mechanical damage to the tissues and allow free access of the optrode to measure the tissue. As shown in Figure 3a, we used two small pieces of filter paper to clamp the root of Arabidopsis, leaving about 2\u20133 mm of the root tip free for microsensor measurement. ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n  4. Adjusting the measuring position of the optrode by a stepper motor: Caution\\! The tip of the optrode sensor is fragile. Move the optrode gently to avoid breaking the tip. \n  5. At each measuring point, the optrode is vibrating between two positions at a distance of 30 \u03bcm \\(Figure 3a). We set an optimal vibration frequency to avoid stirring and to obtain stable results with 2 seconds of quiet time before measuring and 1.92 seconds of measurement at each position in our experiments. Thus, time of measurement at each position is 8.6 seconds at each measuring point. ? TROUBLESHOOTING\n  6. Start the measurement with a reference measure by placing the optrode in a background place, i.e., in the medium as far away from the sample as possible \\(Figure 3b). When the base level of oxygen flux in the environment is steady at a baseline, move the tip of the optrode to a position near \\(5 \u03bcm) the periphery of the sample root \\(Figure 3b). Measurement of oxygen flux in the background position and the rhizophere of Arabidopsis are shown in Figure 3c.7. Based on the aim of the experiment, we can adjust control probe positioning and angle of oscillation. As shown in Figure 4a, we mapped the oxygen flux rate on the periphery of the root apical region in Arabidopsis. We also analyzed the effect of hydrogen peroxide \\(H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) on the oxygen flux rate as shown in Figure 4b.", "This present study has been developed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, which establishes ethical principles for the development of research with humans.

Stage of Protocol of Evaluation of Dyslexia Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60858/60858fig6large.jpg]\n1. Stage 1: Assessment of instruction\nInform parents that their children will be assessed, in order to analyze whether they are at risk of having dyslexia.\nObtain informed consent from parents so that students can be assessed periodically.\nAssess the reading and writing performance, based on the curriculum (CBM), of all the students in class, following adequate reading and writing instruction in in their regular classroom20, for two hours every day over the course of approximately six months. For the assessment of reading and writing performance based on the curriculum, use the indicators recommended by the National Reading Panel (NRP): phonological awareness, knowledge of the alphabet, vocabulary, reading fluency and comprehension24.\nFor the evaluation of these indicators, administer the test to detect dyslexia25,26 either collectively or individually, informing participants of the instructions for performing each test.\nAnalyze the scores obtained. If the majority of the students have achieved similar appropriate scores in the assessment, rule out the possibility of inadequate teaching.\n2. Stage 2: Multilevel assessment of student performance\nLevel 1: Screening\n\t\nAfter analysing the scores obtained in stage 1, identify students who are at risk of dyslexia, according to the standards established for the tests administered.Include students identified as being at risk in the next level.\nLevel 2: Assessment following group instruction\n\t\nAfter any students identified as being at risk have received frequent reading and writing instruction in small groups, (30 minutes, three to five times a week, for approximately 10 sessions), evaluate their response to that instruction, either collectively or individually24.\nTo perform this assessment, administer screening tests for dyslexia25,26, which take the aforementioned indicators into account, informing the participants of the instructions to perform each test.\nIdentify students who present a risk of dyslexia determined on the basis of low test scores, following the instruction received.\nInclude the selected students in the next level.\nLevel 3: Assessment following intensive instruction\n\t\nAfter students identified as being at risk have received even more frequent reading and writing instruction in smaller groups, evaluate their response to that instruction24.\nTo perform this assessment, administer screening tests for dyslexia, collectively or individually25,26, which take the aforementioned indicators into account, informing the participants of the instructions to perform each test.\nIdentify students who present a risk of dyslexia determined on the basis of low test scores, following the instruction received.\nInclude the students selected in the next level.\n3. Stage 3: Specific student assessment\nTo corroborate the diagnosis of dyslexia among students identified as being at risk, carry out the following assessment protocol for each student.\n\tNOTE: Students who do not present any intellectual disabilities or sensory-motor handicaps, but who do perform poorly in reading comprehension and fluency and written accuracy, and present problems in most of the cognitive-linguistic variables evaluated, as well as possible socio-emotional, family and/or school repercussions, shall be classed as having dyslexia.\nInterview with parentsTo begin the specific student assessment protocol, inform parents that their child needs to be evaluated extensively because they have suspected dyslexia.\nObtain informed consent from parents so that students can be assessed specifically.\nConduct a structured interview with the student\u2019s parents, in order to gather information about their child in terms of their personal development (biological, motor, sensory, social, communicative-linguistic) and the family setting (family history, family organisation, expectations about their child's difficulties, family impact of the child\u2019s difficulties).\nHave the psychologist ask the parents about their child's development, the existence of family history and the family setting.\nInterview with the teacher\n\t\nConduct a structured interview with the teacher, in order to find out their opinion about the problem their student might present, their personal development (motor, sensory, social, communicative-linguistic, style of learning and motivation), the classroom environment (class organisation, position of the student within the classroom, materials used by the student, the student's integration in the classroom) and their school record (schools attended, academic performance, diversity management measures received and approach to schooling).\nIn this section, have the psychologist give the teacher the following instructions: \"In order to obtain information and your opinion about the student, complete this structured interview referring to the student\u2019s possible problem, their personal development, learning and motivation, their academic record and environment in the classroom\".\nMeasure of Intelligence\n\t\nAdminister a cognitive scale27 to assess intelligence in children, in accordance with the instructions set out in the test handbook, in order to rule out possible intellectual limitations.Analyze the student profile obtained, in order to ascertain information about the cognitive and linguistic aspects (fluent reasoning, visual-spatial, working memory, processing speed and verbal comprehension) required to make the diagnosis and to establish the affected and unaffected cognitive-linguistic areas that would justify dyslexia and rule out other problems.\nMeasure of Reading and Writing\n\t\nTo measure reading fluency and comprehension, individually carry out a reading assessment25 for children aged six.\nIn the reading fluency test, instruct the student to read a list of words and another list of pseudowords as fast as they can. Record the number they got right and the time they took to complete each test. Correct the answers in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the test handbook.\nFor the reading comprehension test, instruct the student to read a text in silence and then answer questions about what they have read.

No gold covering is realized in order to be able to perform elemental analysis on the surface.\nEnvironmental SEM examination of each sample is directly performed on a Philips XL30 CP with X-ray microanalysis \\(energy-dispersive X-ray spectros- copy). The resolution of the microscope is 3.5 nm at 30 kV using the secondary electron detector. All images are stored using a standard resolution digital frame store.\nOptical microscope sample preparation is as follows:\n- The first step consists in a very fine fragmentation of the sample. This is justified by the fact that the PFD has no architecture of it own and that this fragmentation does not consist in a loss of information \\(since we worked in a microscopic scale). In addition, this reduction allows for a better penetration of the fixative substances.\n- In order to rehydrate and fix the samples, they are immersed in 20% diluted acetic acid for 48 h, in order to slowly decalcify the fragments of PFD.\n- A solution is obtained using the following two phases: a liquid phase made of the PFD in suspension and a solid-phase slope. These two phases are studied separately.- The cytological analysis of the PFD in suspension began with the sampling of 200 \u03bcL from the supernatant. This liquid is then centrifuged \\(800 turns per minute for 10 min) in order to obtain two spots per slide. Four slides are produced by sample: two slides are colored by the technique of Papanicolaou after a fixing of the spots with a lacquer; the two other slides are colored by the technique of the May\u2013Gr\u00fcnwald\u2013Giemsa \\(MGG) after fixing of the spots to the air.\n- The study of the remaining solid phase \\(base of centrifugation) is carried out after a new centrifugation \\(3,500 turns per minute for 10 min). The supernatant is kept in reserve \\(for a later possible cytological study) while the base is recuperated, then fixed 24 h in the AFA \\(acetic acid, formaldehyde, alcohol). As soon after fixation and decalcification, the sample is put in cassette on a foam, followed by the traditional circuit of inclusion \\(dehydration in xylene and increasing alcohol baths, then inclusion in liquid paraffin, cooling, section with the microtome \\(from 6 to 10 \u03bcm), deposit on an albumenized slide, air-drying free, dewaxing and rehydration by immersion in xylene then in decreasing alcohol baths to distilled water). Several colorations are carried out for each sample: periodic acid Schiff, Gram, toluidine blue, and hema- toxylin, eosin, saffron \\(HES).", "All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines for animal experiments from the National Institute of Genetics (NIG), and all procedures were approved by the NIG Committee for Animal Care and Use (approval no. 26-9).\n1. Animals\nSelective breeding\nCreate wild-derived heterogeneous stock (WHS)6 mice by crossing 8 inbred strains (MSM, HMI, BLG2, PGN2, KJR, CHD, NJL, and BFM/2) while avoiding any inbreeding (mating between siblings or cousins)7. Conduct a selective breeding, starting in the third generation (G3), by selecting mice that display longer \u201ccontact time\u201d (selected group, 16 families of mating pairs) according to the active tameness test (see step 3.1).\nGenerate the non-selected control group (also 16 families of mating pairs) via random mating from G3 onward. For a representative experiment, use mice obtained from selected (S1) and non-selected (C1) groups of WHS mice to show the pattern of both active and passive tameness using the three tameness tests (see step 3.1 - 3.3). For the experiments, use 10 G15 mice per group (S1 and C1).\nRepresentative subject animals\nWean all mice from their parents at 3 weeks of age and house them in same-sex groups with littermates, using standard-size plastic cages containing wood chips, until the test. Maintain all animals at an NIG animal facility under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on from 06:00 to 18:00) and a constant temperature (23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C).\nEnsure that food and water are available ad libitum. Test the mice at 6 weeks of age during the light period to analyze their interactions with humans during the part of the day when humans are typically active.\nHandling protocolUse large tweezers covered with silicon tubes to transfer the mice to new cages by picking them up gently by their tails. Use the tweezers to separate them from their parents at weaning and move them during the experiments. None of the mice should receive handling before the tameness tests.\nTransfer the mice to an experimental room just before the tameness tests.\nKeep the male mice separated from one another after the test, to avoid inter-male aggression in WHS mice.\n2. Equipment\nUse an open-field apparatus (400 x 400 x 400 mm, grayish polyvinylchloride).\nIlluminate the open field using a clip light with a neutral white bulb (100 lux) fixed at a height of 450 mm above the open field (Figure 1).\nRecord all behaviors using a commercially available compact digital camera fixed at 850 mm above the open field using a tripod (Figure 1).\nWear cloth gloves under latex gloves to protect the hands from being bitten at during the passive tameness test (a rare reaction).\nMeasure the test period using a stopwatch.\n3. Tests\nNote: The first two tests (active tameness and passive tameness) were conducted for 1 min each, and the stay-on-hand test was conducted for less than 1 min. All three tests were conducted in the open-field apparatus and recorded using a digital camera.\u00a0Iodophore disinfection procedure should be performed on all apparats before any behavior studies.\nProcedures for active tameness test\nTurn on the digital camera and start recording.\nPick up a mouse gently by the tail using a pair of large tweezers (see step 1.3.1) and transfer it from the home cage to the center of the open-field apparatus.\nStart the stopwatch.\nPlace the left hand on the lower left corner of the apparatus.Keep the palm facing up and move the fingers slowly and steadily to ensure that the mouse connects the hand to a human. The average time to move all four fingers from the little finger to the index finger should be approximately 0.5 s, with a continuously repeated movement cycle.\nMove the hand toward the mouse slowly, at an average speed of about 13 cm/s, stopping at 10 cm from the side of the mouse\u2019s body.\nMaintain the same distance if the mouse attempts to move away. If the mouse approaches, keep the hand in the same position and continue to move the fingers slightly. If the mouse attempts to climb up the arm, return it to the field using the free hand.\nConclude the test after 1 min, withdraw the hand, and proceed to the passive tameness test.\nProcedures for passive tameness test\nFollow the same steps as for the active tameness test, but instead of stopping 10 cm away from the mouse\u2019s body, slowly touch the mouse with the fingertips.\nLeave the fingers in the same position, contacting the mouse, until the mouse moves away. When the mouse attempts to break contact, follow it, moving at an average speed of about 23 cm/s, and reinitiate the touch.\nConclude the test after 1 min. Restart the stopwatch immediately to begin the stay-on-hand test.\nProcedures for stay-on-hand test\nLift the mouse by the tail using a pair of large tweezers and place it gently on the left palm. Keep the hand close to the floor of the open-field apparatus.\nStroke the mouse gently at an average speed of 0.5 s/stroke using the left thumb until it leaves the hand.\nRepeat steps 3.3.1 - 3.3.2 3x.\nAfter the third trial, stop the video recording; all tameness tests are now concluded.Post-experimental procedures\nWeigh the mouse and count the number of feces and urine left in the open field.\nMark the mouse individually via an ear punch.\nWipe the apparatus and experimenter gloves with a paper towel soaked in 0.2% Iodophor sanitizer.\nClean the apparatus with a dry paper towel.\n4.

Crayfish Selection\nIn order to successfully apply the current approach to crayfish, select the respective adult specimens with sufficient carapace sizes (which is a carapace length of at least 30 mm) for sensor attachment, visually examine it for the absence of diseases, and check whether it lifts both chelae when it is touched. The above-mentioned parameters indicate an eligible state of crayfish health.\nNOTE: If several crayfish are expected to be used in the trial and are exposed to the same conditions, the experimental group should be formed based on several parameters: (i) similar weight and length; (ii) comparable heart rate; (iii) pronounced nocturnal activity; (iv) regular food consumption; (v) inter-molting period17. Sometimes, it is hard to define whether a crayfish is near to molting by the heart rate measurements or visual or tactile examinations only; therefore, the analyses of the crayfish's hemolymph total protein content can be helpful. Protein content is expected to be higher when the crayfish is closer to molting than in the inter-molting state18.\n2. Recording of Crayfish Cardiac Activity and Behavior\nIn order to noninvasively measure crayfish heart rates, preliminarily prepare the sensor for this procedure. Before this, put a crayfish into the tank with water and let it acclimate there for a few days as the preparation of the sensor19 will also take a few days.\nAxially couple an IR light-emitting diode (LED) with a phototransistor. Attach the optical sensor circuit onto a board; it will require a power supply of 5 V. For the LED connection, place a 200 \u03a9 resistor on the IR sensor board; in order to connect the phototransistor, place a 220 \u03a9 resistor on the board.When attached to the crayfish, the sensor output is modulated by the amount of hemolymph filling the crayfish cardiac muscle and scatters an incident light from the LED. In order to avoid reciprocal interference of the illuminated IR light by the LED and the reflected IR light from the crayfish heart, which is received by the phototransistor, place a small wall (0.5 x 1.5 x 4 mm, thickness x height x width) made of black antistatic plastic between the LED and the phototransistor.\nPlace the LED in a waterproof package, and cover the surface of the sensor with the waterproof dielectric gel from the side adjacent to the carapace for the protection of the electronic components from potential damage (Figure 1). Let the gel dry for 3 days in order to gain its best protective properties.\nFor an analog signal, attach thin flexible cables (about 3 m long) to the sensor and connect to the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC); from this, a digitized signal will be transferred to a personal computer over a USB interface, at which point the information about the crayfish cardiac activity is saved, analyzed in real-time with special software (see Table of Materials), and stored for further detailed analyses.\nAs soon as the sensor is prepared, attach it to the crayfish. In order to do this, switch the computer on and run the software. Determine the number of crayfish to be fixed to the sensors and recorded heart rate to be saved to the date file.\nRemove the crayfish from the water and wipe its dorsal carapace side with a paper towel. Wrap the chelae and abdomen of the crayfish in the paper towel in order to avoid any damages by human hand and to eliminate additional stress on the crayfish caused by warm human hands.NOTE: Do not use a previous cooling of the crayfish on ice or in the freezer for its immobilization before manipulations with the sensor attachment. The difference in temperatures leads to crayfish dorsal surface weeping which, in turn, leads to unreliable sensor fastening and quick adhesive detachment from the crayfish's carapace.\nPrepare a surface (i.e., take a small flat piece of plastic or tear a piece of sticky tape and fix it to a table) and a stick for mixing the glue. Press out two small drops (of a diameter of about 0.5 cm) from tubes A and B containing epoxy glue and quickly mix them.\nAttach the sensor to the crayfish dorsal carapace and try to find the place in which the cardiac signal amplitude would be maximal. Hold the crayfish with the sensor in one hand and, using the other free hand, put a drop of mixed glue on each of the four auxiliary wires located on the sensor (fix them in between steps 2.1.1 and 2.1.4.). Do not move the sensor at least 5 min until the glue hardens (the glue hardening depends on the ambient temperature and humidity).\nNOTE: When fixing the sensor to the crayfish carapace, examine thoroughly the whole cardiac area from the carapace side in order to define the area with the best (maximal) cardiac signal amplitude. That will help the software to provide more precise heart rate calculations.\nTouch the glue using a free hand, and if it is not sticky, put the unwrapped crayfish with the attached sensor (Figure 2) to the box without water for few more minutes until the glue is completely dry.NOTE: An optimal temperature for crayfish and glue manipulation varies from 18 to 22 \u00b0C. At these temperatures, the glue hardens within 5 to 7 min and is completely dry within 8 to 10 min. At lower temperatures, the stress in the crayfish is less pronounced; however, the glue needs more time to harden, about 15 and 20 min under 15 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C, respectively. At higher temperatures, particularly above 25 \u00b0C, the glue hardens within 3 min, but the crayfish undergoes much more stress; therefore, try to minimize the exposure of the crustacean to extreme conditions without water.\nBefore moving the crayfish back into the tank, dip its cephalothorax into the water several times with short intervals of a few seconds in order to allow a discharge of the air that has accumulated in the gills, and leave the crayfish in the water for approximately 1 h to remove any excess chemicals. After this process is complete, release the crayfish into the water and allow it to acclimate for one to two weeks under experimental conditions, depending on observed physiological indices. Optimal water exchange during the acclimation periods is every other day.\nNOTE: Characteristics of crayfish that have acclimated and are in a healthy state include pronounced circadian cardiac and locomotor activities, regular food consumption, and spending most daylight in a specialized shelter (if provided).\n3. Camera and Software Setup\nStart the software; the video camera will automatically switch on.\nSelect an option of movement detection, thoroughly detect area of each tank on the screen\u00a0and the software will start tracking the behavior and linking it with the cardiac activity recordings.NOTE: A crayfish motion detection module consists of a video camera that tracks crayfish behavior from below the tank and the software that combines the behavior with cardiac activity. The data from the module are used to facilitate more precise cardiac activity data processing by eliminating periods in which the crayfish demonstrates high locomotive activity. Sudden crayfish movements (i.e., an escape reaction or feeding initiation) can result in fluctuations or short-time spikes in cardiac signals that may reduce the precision of cardiac interval calculations.\nSubscription Required.

Object Selection and Experimental Setup\nSelect objects that are different enough to be easily discriminated by mice, but have a similar degree of complexity (texture, shape, color patterning and brightness, etc.) in order to minimize any potential induced object preference that may bias the results (see Ennaceur 2010 for a comprehensive description of object choice7).\nTest for innate preference and discrimination (see Steps 2 & 3).\nUse objects that are mouse-sized or only slightly larger to encourage exploration (Figure 1). To reduce induced preference, ensure that mice are able to climb on both objects or neither object, though ability to climb on an object may increase interest in exploration (time spent just sitting on an object is not counted towards exploration time.)\nHave at least 2 copies of each object. However, to minimize potential odor cues during testing, have at least 3 of each object, duplicates for training and one for testing.\nUse objects made of non-breakable material, as loss of an object due to damage during experimentation could interfere with the continuity of testing, and potentially cause harm or injury to the animal.\nThoroughly clean the objects before and between use (70% vol/vol ethanol is appropriate).\nTo minimize the stress of bright lighting, use diffuse, low lighting, with the center of the maze illuminated around 20 lux. Use a temperature and humidity similar to regular housing conditions. If mice are being moved from a housing room to a different room for the experiment, acclimate mice to their new room for at least 1 h prior to use each day.Handle mice well prior to training. Because the test relies on the natural tendency of rodents to explore novelty, reduce any stress or anxiety from handling that may interfere with their desire to explore the arena, and subsequently, the objects. Ideally, handle mice 1 - 2 times/day for at least 1 min, 1 to 2 weeks prior to testing15,29.\nFor the main arena, use a square chamber (around 40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm) made from white or black, non-porous plastic, contrasted to the color of the mouse. Alternatively, use a round arena ed. Specifically, when using anxious mice that may sit in the corners of a square arena, a round arena may be preferable to encourage exploratory behavior18,30.\nOn training day, place 2 identical objects on the diagonal (i.e. one in the NW corner and one in the SE corner). If objects are too light and can be moved by the mouse, fasten them to the floor. Removable mounting putty works well.\nFor testing day, use the 3rd copy of each object to place one familiar object and one novel object on the same diagonal as the training day (Figure 2).\nCounterbalance the use of each set of objects so that each object is used equally as a familiar object and as a novel object. Also, counterbalance the location of the novel object to each of the 4 corners of the arena. Be sure to note which diagonal is used for which animal so that the diagonal used on the training day is the same as that used on the testing day, for each mouse.\nThoroughly clean the apparatus and objects to remove odor cues before and between use (70% vol/vol ethanol is appropriate).Place the camera directly overhead of the apparatus for optimal view of exploration. Only use software with nose-point detection for accurate analysis. If using software, capture a background image with the objects in place prior to starting. In the software, set the area of exploration to be approximately 2 - 3 cm around the object.\nTo reduce experimenter interference, record the trial and score it later. Blind the scorer to the experimental conditions. If manually scoring during the experiment, ensure that the experimenter is more than 1 meter from the arena, and not visible to the mouse.\n\tNOTE: Any time the mouse spends sitting on the object without active vibrissae sweeping or sniffing does not count as exploration time.\nDefine exploration as when the mouse's noise is pointed towards the object and within 2 - 3 cm of the object, with active vibrissae sweeping or sniffing. Do not count any time sitting on the object without indication of active exploration.\n2. Necessary Pilot Experiments\nTesting for induced preference\nFor habituation, remove the mouse from its home cage and place it in the middle of the open arena. Allow the mouse to freely explore for 5 min.\nOn Training Day (T1), place 2 different objects in opposite quadrants of the apparatus, (i.e., NW and SE corners). Remove the mouse from its home cage and place it in the middle of the open arena. Allow free exploration for 10 min.\nCalculate the discrimination index. If there is no induced preference, the discrimination index should be at or near zero. Any objects that show preference should not be used for ORT.\nTesting for discrimination ability\nFor habituation, remove mouse from its home cage and place it in the middle of the open arena. Allow the mouse to freely explore for 5 min.On Training Session (T1), place 2 identical objects in opposite quadrants. Place the mouse in the center of the arena and allow the mouse to explore for 10 min.\nOn Testing Session (T2), place one of the object used during T1 and one novel object in opposite quadrants (i.e., NW and SE corners). Sixty min after T1, place the mouse in the center of the arena and allow free exploration for 10 min.\nCalculate the discrimination index. At a 60 min retention interval, the discrimination index should be above 0.25.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nHabituation\nRemove the mouse from its home cage and place it in the middle of the open, empty arena. Allow for free exploration of the arena for 5 min. Once the home cage is empty, save it for use as a holding cage the next day.\nAt the end of 5 min, remove the mouse and place in a holding cage. Do not return the mouse to its original cage, or this may affect the behavior of the remaining mice to be tested.\nThoroughly clean the apparatus between mice using 70% vol/vol ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: During habituation, anxiety-like behavior can be assessed by calculating time spent in the center (see Prut & Belzung 200331). This is a useful metric when considering the length of time for T1. Higher anxiety mice may require a 10 min session to reach the minimum exploration criterion.\nTraining (T1)\nPlace two identical objects in opposite quadrants of the arena (i.e., NE corner and SW corner).\n24 h after habituation, remove the mouse from its home cage and place it in the center of the arena, equidistant from the 2 identical objects.Allow free exploration for a minimum of 5 min. If using a strain of mice that are known to have low locomotor or exploration activity, (i.e., most mice do not reach a minimum of 20 s exploration of both objects by 5 min, as noted in the pilot experiments or the literature), extend the trial to 10 min for all mice in the cohort.\nAt the end of the trial, remove the mouse and place in the holding cage. Once the home cage is empty, save it for use as the holding cage on testing day.\nThoroughly clean the apparatus and objects between mice using 70% vol/vol ethanol.\nTesting (T2)\nPlace one object used during T1 (i.e., the familiar object) and one novel object in opposite quadrants of the arena. Use the same locations as used during T1 for each mouse.\nAt the T1 to T2 interval of choosing, remove mouse from its home cage and place it in the center arena, equidistant from the familiar object and the novel object.\n\t\tNOTE: At a retention interval of 24 h, most mice will not be able to discriminate between the familiar and novel object (usually -0.2 < d2 < 0.2, as compared to a positive control32). If testing for nootropic effects, use this time point to probe for memory enhancement. To probe for memory deficits, use a shorter retention interval of anywhere between 20 min to 4 h, depending on the strain of mouse.\nAllow free exploration for 10 min. At the end of the trial, remove the mouse and place in the holding cage.For both T1 and T2, score the first 5 min. If the mouse does not meet the minimum exploration time of 20 s for both objects, continue scoring past 5 min until total exploration exceeds 20 s.\n4. Data Analysis\nExclusion Criteria\nDuring both training (T1) and testing (T2), calculate the total exploration time for both objects for each session (e1 and e2). Most mice should reach a minimum exploration total for both objects of 20 s by 5 min.\nExtend T1 and T2 time to 10 min for strains of mice that have low exploration and do not meet this minimum criterion by 5 min, as observed during pilot testing.\nScore behavior for 5 min or beyond 5 min until they reach the 20 s minimum criterion.\nIf mice do not reach a 20 s minimum of exploration for both objects for either T1 or T2 at 10 min, exclude from analysis, as it cannot be confirmed they spent enough time exploring to learn/discriminate.\nAbsolute vs Relative Analysis\n\tNOTE: Different formulas for analysis and their relationship to one another can be seen in Table 1.\n\t\nCalculate e1 as the total exploration time during training for 2 identical objects, where a1 and a2 are the identical objects.\ne1 = a1 + a2\nCalculate e2 as the total exploration time during testing for the familiar object (a) and the novel object (b).\ne2 = a+b\nCalculate d1 as simply the time spent exploring the novel object minus time spent exploring the familiar object. The absolute discrimination measure (d1) does not take into account differences in exploration time between mice or treatment groups, though in certain circumstances, it may be a more sensitive measure2.\nd1 = b-aCalculate d2 as the time spent exploring the novel object minus the time spent exploring the familiar object divided by total exploration time. The most commonly used measure is a relative discrimination value often referred to as the discrimination index (d2), which is not influenced by differences in exploration time. This means all values will fall between -1 and +1.\nd2 = d1/e2\nAlternatively, calculate the recognition or preference index (d3)3. This is the time spent exploring the novel object divided by the total time. This means all values will fall between 0 and 1. It is often multiplied by 100 and used as percentage value.\nd3 = b/e2*100\nStatistical Analysis\nUsing the mean discrimination values for each group, determine memory performance using one-way ANOVA. For further analysis, make two-way post hoc comparisons with the treated vs vehicle condition and positive/negative control groups.\nSubscription Required.

Rodent Acclimation and Food Restriction\nUse adult Wistar rats that are 3 months old at the start of the experiment. House rats singly in cages equipped with a laminar flow unit and air filter in a temperature- and humidity-controlled, AAALAC-accredited animal care facility on a reversed 12-hr\u00a0light/dark cycle (lights off at 0600 hr).\nProvide water and standard rodent chow freely until body weights are approximately 380 \u2013 400 g. Subsequently, food-restrict rats and maintain at 85 to 90% of their free-feeding body weights during the experimental sessions to facilitate acquisition and maintenance of response to methamphetamine.\nHandle rodents in the home cage room daily from arrival throughout the experimental sessions in order to record body weight and adjust daily food allocation.\nOnce target weights are achieved, prepare to surgically implant each rat with a chronic indwelling jugular catheter and intracranial stimulating electrodes.\n2. Jugular Vein Catheterization\nCatheter Preparation\n\t\nPrepare a 13-cm length of silastic tubing with an inner diameter of 0.012 x 0.025', create a silicone ball 4 cm from one end of the tubing using extra silicone tubing and electrocautery, and allow to air dry.\nDip the other end of the tubing in a limonene-based solvent derived from citrus for a few minutes and allow to expand. Connect the expanded tubing to a stainless steel guide cannula bent at a right angle.\nAnchor the bent base of the stainless steel guide cannula to a 1\u201d square of biocompatible mesh using dental acrylic cement.\nFlush the catheter inside and out with ethanol and distilled water. Inject air through the tubing to eliminate residual liquid droplets. Allow to dry O/N.\nSterile TechniquePerform all surgeries in a dedicated animal surgical suite using aseptic surgical techniques. Sterilize instruments and implants using an autoclave and prepare a sterile area by placing waterproof paper on the OR table covered with a sterile towel(s).\nWear sterile gloves and keep all instruments, implants and surgical gauze on the sterile area during the procedure. Wipe down each instrument with an alcohol swab followed by 20 sec in a bead sterilizer between procedures when multiple surgeries are performed.\nAnesthesia\n\t\nPretreat rats with atropine (sulfate)\u00a0(0.04\u00a0mg/kg, s.q.) followed by pentobarbital (20 - 50 mg/kg, ip) to achieve anesthesia.\nInject animals with sterile penicillin G procaine suspension (75,000 units, im) and an analgesic agent (carprofen, 5 - 10 mg/kg, sc or ketoprofen, 2 - 5 mg/kg, sc) immediately prior to surgery to decrease perioperative infections and pain, respectively.\nCheck for adequate anesthesia by delivering a moderate toe pinch to the animal and, if no response occurs, then proceed. Apply eye lubricant to both the eyes.\nSurgical Site Preparation\n\t\nShave a 2 x 2 cm dorsal patch on the rat\u2019s back just posterior to a line connecting the shoulder blades. Shave a 1 x 1 cm ventral patch in the right neck region between the jaw bone and the sternum.\nWipe the shaved areas with alcohol pads followed by betadine solution. Place rat on a sterile towel and allow the betadine to dry before proceeding.\nCatheter Implantation\n\t\nMake an incision parallel to a line connecting the shoulder blades in the midscapular region on the back using a 10-blade knife. Use a hemostat to separate the skin from the underlying connective tissue to create a plane for the mesh catheter base. Irrigate the area with sterile saline and cover with sterile gauze prior to turning the rat onto its back.Make a diagonal incision between the right jaw bone and the sternum using a 10-blade knife. Use a hemostat to separate the skin from the underlying connective tissue to locate the jugular vein. Note: The jugular vein appears white/silver and shiny and is larger in male rats than in females.\nPlace a spatula underneath the vein, tie a 4-0 silk suture gently around the top (proximal part) of the exposed vein and push the vein back into the neck.\nSeparate the connective tissues to create a superficial pocket under the inferolateral neck skin but above the muscle. Push a sterilized trocar from the neck incision to the midscapular incision by tunneling back behind the arm and upward. Run the catheter from the back to the neck by inserting a stiff guide wire up through the trocar from the neck end and into the distal catheter. Pull the guide wire back through to the neck incision and the attached distal catheter will follow.\nIsolate the right jugular vein over a spatula by pulling up on the previously placed proximal suture. Use a ball scissors to make a small partial cut on the topside of the vein.\nInsert a curved forceps into the vein incision to open it up. Keeping the forceps apart but in place, pass the catheter tip in between the forceps tips and into the vein about 2 - 3 cm where it will terminate outside the right atrium.\nSecure the catheter by tying a 4-0 silk suture around the distal vein. Tie the proximal and distal sutures together in a \u201cbox\u201d knot to add extra stability.Flush catheter with heparinized sterile saline and draw back blood to confirm successful implantation. Trim the sutures 1 - 2 mm above the knots and tuck the remaining proximal catheter under the neck skin. close with an appropriate suture/method of your choosing.\u00a0 If non-absorbable sutures or staples are used, they must be removed in 10-14 days under general anesthesia. Cover incision with antibiotic ointment using a sterile cotton tip applicator.\nAnchor the distal catheter/guide cannula/mesh assembly to the subcutaneous back tissue using absorbable sutures at two of the opposing corners of the mesh base. Close the back incision around the guide cannula using interrupted, non-inverted absorbable sutures. Cover incision with antibiotic ointment using a sterile cotton tip applicator.\nPostoperative Care\n\t\nFlush the catheter with heparinized 0.9% sterile saline solution using a 3 ml syringe and place an obturator into the guide cannula to prevent clogging.\nFlush each rat\u2019s catheter on a daily basis to maintain patency.\nImmediately following the procedure, place the rat in its home cage over a heating pad in the surgical suite and observe until consciousness and spontaneous movement return.\nReturn the recovered rat to the colony room and allow five to seven days to pass before intracranial surgery. Weigh, handle, and assess their general condition daily, including checking for infection and evaluating animal behavior, appearance and activity levels.\nConsult the Animal Resources veterinarian if any problems arise and follow any recommended treatment regimens. Inject animals with an analgesic agent (carprofen, 5 - 10 mg/kg, sc or ketoprofen, 2 - 5 mg/kg, sc) to treat perioperative pain as needed.\n3. Intracranial Electrode Placement\nSurgical Preparation\n\t\nPerform all surgeries under sterile conditions as described in section 2.2.\nAnesthesiaPlace animal in an anesthesia induction chamber and provide isoflurance gas flow into the chamber at 1,000 - 2,000 ml/min with the vaporizer set at 5%.\nOnce animal is recumbent, remove from chamber and place in nose cone on padded stereotactic operating platform. Switch gas flow from chamber to nose cone and run gas with vaporizer set at 2 - 3%.\nAdjust vaporizer as needed to maintain stable respirations and no\u00a0response to stimulation during surgery.\nInject rat with sterile penicillin G procaine suspension (75,000 units, im) and an analgesic agent (buprenorphine 0.05 to 0.5\u00a0mg/kg sc) immediately prior to surgery to decrease perioperative infections and pain, respectively.\nCheck for adequate anesthesia by delivering a moderate toe pinch to the animal and, if no response occurs, then proceed. Apply eye lubricant to both the eyes.\nSurgical Site Preparation\n\t\nShave the top of the rat\u2019s head and place the rat in ear bars to keep its head immobile during the procedure. Wipe the shaved area with alcohol pads followed by betadine solution. Allow the betadine to dry before proceeding.\nElectrode Implantation\n\t\nGrasp the scalp between and slightly anterior to the ears with forceps and use scissors to cut across the base. This manuveur will remove a 1.5 x 1 cm area of skin over the mid-skull.\nUse a 10-blade to make a circumferential incision through the pericranium down to the skull and a curved forceps to scrape off and remove the pericranium. Irrigate the area with sterile saline, dab excess blood and saline with gauze, and allow the skull to dry completely so the bony landmarks, including the bregma, can be clearly seen.For bilateral surgery, mount two bipolar platinum-iridium electrodes, one into each electrode holder on either side of the stereotactic operating platform. Move the first electrode into position ~1 mm over the bregma and write down the stereotactic coordinates for the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) positions, which will be shown on the digital display. Do NOT actually touch the electrode tip to the skull because the electrode will no longer function. Repeat this procedure for the other electrode.\nCalculate the final AP and ML coordinates based on the target structure of interest. Move the electrode to this position with the tip just above the skull to obtain the initial dorsoventral (DV) coordinate on the digital display. Calculate the final DV depth based on the target structure of interest.\n\t\tNote: The nucleus accumbens shell was targeted in this example given its known involvement in drug-consummatory behavior8 using the following stereotactic coordinates relative to bregma:\n\t\tAP entry coordinate = [Digitally displayed coordinate at bregma] + 1.6\n\t\tML entry coordinate = [Digitally displayed coordinate at bregma] \u00b1\u00a02.4 for right/left\n\t\tDV depth = [Digitally displayed coordinate at skull surface at AP/ML entry] - 8.5\nMark the projected entry position of each electrode on the surface of the skull with a permanent marker. Do not bump or touch the electrode\u2019s tip during this maneuver.\nUse a round ball diamond coated burr to drill a 1.4 mm hole at each mark. Be careful not to plunge through the skull into the intracranial vault with the high-speed drill. Use a curved forceps to puncture the dura once the skull has been drilled away.Use a round ball diamond coated burr to drill 0.7 mm holes in an additional four locations behind the electrode entries for placement of skull screws. Use a manual screwdriver to place four 0.8 (diameter) x 3.2 (length) mm stainless steel screws into the skull, two on each side of midline. Tightly secure these screws up to about half their length into the skull because they are the major infrastructure that will hold the cranial cap in place for the coming weeks and months.\nCarefully insert the first electrode through its burrhole into the brain to the calculated DV depth by manually turning the knob that manages the Z-coordinate of the electrode holder. Turn the knob at a rate roughly equal to 1/2 turn per second to prevent undue damage to the tip of the electrode. Ensure the electrode tip does not touch the bony edge of the burrhole when entering the brain.\nSecure the first electrode using super glue layered over the burrhole and the posterior screws, followed by dental cement. Once this construct has dried completely, remove the electrode from its holder. Repeat the insertion and cementing process for the second electrode. Apply dental cement right up to the skin edge but do not overlap with the skin because this loosens the cranial cement cap long-term.\nPostoperative Care\n\t\nPlace two dust caps over the electrode pedestals to prevent clogging.\nImmediately following the procedure, place the rat in its home cage over a heating pad in the surgical suite and observe until consciousness and spontaneous movement return.\nReturn the recovered rat to the colony room and allow five days to pass before starting the experiment. Weigh, handle, and assess the rats\u2019 general condition daily, including checking for infection and evaluating animal behavior, appearance and activity levels.Consult the Animal Resources veterinarian if any problems arise and follow any recommended treatment regimens. Inject animals with an analgesic agent (buprenorphine 0.05 to 1 mg/kg sc) to treat perioperative pain as needed. Intracranial bleeding can be more prevalent with the use of non-steroidal pain medications (carprofen, 5 - 10 mg/kg, sc or ketoprofen, 2 - 5 mg/kg, sc) so use buprenorphine perioperatively for intracranial surgery.\n4. Operant Apparatus\nUse plastic and stainless steel operant conditioning chambers contained within sound-attenuating enclosures to run the behavioral experiments.\nOutfit each enclosure with an exhaust fan to supply ventilation and white noise to mask extraneous sounds.\nUse a personal computer and a behavioral software interface system to program the procedures and collect the experimental data.\nGeneral Set-Up\n\t\nEquip each experimental chamber with two response levers mounted on one wall of the chamber with a stimulus light located above each lever. Designate one of the levers the \u201cactive\u201d lever so that it results in a programmed consequence when pressed.\nProgram a stimulus light located directly above the active response lever to illuminate during every operant session, indicating the availability of drug.\nHave a response on the active lever result in an infusion delivery of methamphetamine (0.05 mg/kg/infusion in 100 \u00b5l 0.9% NaCl) over 2.8 sec accompanied by the house light on the opposite wall going ON for 5 sec and the stimulus light going OFF for a 30-sec timeout.\nCount responses on the active lever but they should have no scheduled consequences during the 30-sec timeout period. For completion, record responses on the inactive lever but they should have no scheduled consequences.\n5. Intravenous (IV) Methamphetamine Self-Administration Procedure\nGeneral PreparationsLoad rats into the operant chambers as quickly and calmly as possible to minimize behavioral artifacts. Attach a stainless steel spring leash to the guide cannula on the rodent\u2019s back and to a leak-proof fluid swivel suspended above the operant chamber.\nEnsure the integrity of the connection tubing from the swivel to the 20-ml drug syringe in a motor-driven pump located outside the sound-attenuating enclosure. To do this, push the plastic connection tubing at least \u00bc of an inch onto the metal swivel tip and the drug syringe needle tip until it will not slide off with moderate pulling. Counter-balance the swivel and leash assembly to permit relatively unrestrained movement of the animal.\nConduct operant sessions at approximately the same time each day Monday through Friday.\nAcquisition\n\t\nIn order to facilitate rapid acquisition of IV methamphetamine self-administration, run rats on daily 6-hr sessions for four to five consecutive days.\nConduct these sessions on a fixed ratio FR-1 + 30 sec schedule of reinforcementduring which rats receive one infusion of IV methamphetamine for each press on the active lever followed by a 30 sec time-out (e.g.,\u00a0no cue or reward consequences occur with pressing of either lever). Note: This initial prolonged and \u201ceasy\u201d access will result in the majority of rodents acquiring significant drug taking behavior in less than or equal to one week (Figure 3).\nMaintenance\n\t\nDuring the second week of training, run rats on daily 2-hr sessions Monday through Friday to maintain and refine IV methamphetamine self-administration.\nConduct sessions on a fixed ratio FR-1 + 30 sec timeout schedule of reinforcement.Document stable, intense responding when the total number of methamphetamine presentations across each session varies less than 10% for three consecutive sessions (Figure 4) and the cumulative number of infusions across the first 30-min is greater than the cumulative number of infusions during the second 30-min (Figure 5). Note: This criterion ensures that the rats develop a drug-loading pattern at the beginning of the session that indicates addictive behavior19 and not simply casual use.\nPost-Session\n\t\nAt the end of each session, disconnect the leash from the rodent\u2019s back. Flush the catheter with 0.1 ml of 0.9% saline solution containing 800 IU streptokinase to prevent blood clots. Insert an obturator into each guide cannula to prevent clogging before returning the rats to the home cages.\nTest the patency of the catheters immediately after the end of each experimental session on Wednesdays throughout the course of the experiment.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 3 cc syringe, with a 22 G needle, containing heparinized bacteriostatic saline to test catheter patency. Attach one end of a 4 to 6 inch long piece of plastic tubing to the needle and the other end to the metal post of the catheter-cannula assembly on the animal\u2019s back.\nInfuse 0.1 to 0.2 ml of saline to ensure a clear flow and then draw the syringe plunger back. If the catheter is patent, it should both flush easily and draw back blood that will be visible in the tubing. Release the plunger and infuse another 0.2 ml to flush all of the blood back through the catheter.\nIf blood cannot be withdrawn, then remove the 3 cc syringe and tubing from the metal post.Prepare a 1 cc syringe, with a 22 G needle, containing methohexital sodium, a fast-acting anesthetic, to further test catheter patency. Attach one end of a 4 to 6 inch long piece of plastic tubing to the needle and the other end to the metal post of the catheter-cannula assembly on the animal\u2019s back.\nInfuse 1.5 mg and quickly remove the 1 cc syringe and tubing from the metal post on the animal\u2019s back. Reconnect the 3 cc syringe filled with heparinized bacteriostatic saline and infuse 0.1 - 0.2 ml. If the animal loses muscle tone within 3 sec, then the catheter is patent and functional.\nSee the Supplemental File \u201cCommon Pitfalls\u201d for a pitfalls section that addresses adverse reactions to methamphetamine, failure to acquire methamphetamine self-administration, and rat extraction difficulty.\n6. Brain Stimulation Apparatus\nUse 10 to 12 plexi-glass boxes (12 x 18 x 18 in) (w x h x d) to run the DBS experiments. Cover each box on the outside with stiff opaque paper that covers the back and sides of the box to prevent the rats from viewing or interacting with each other. Leave the clear front panel uncovered so the examiner can view the animals during the stimulation sessions.\nCover the tops of the boxes with a semi-permeable panel that prevents the rats from escaping while allowing airflow. Use this panel to support the commutators that are located above each box to facilitate the electrical connection between the rodent head cap and the stimulation system.\nUse a stimulation system that can deliver constant current to multiple simultaneous animals for the DBS experiments. Use a system that consists of a user programmable digital signal processor/communications interface, a stimulator, a stimulator battery pack, a channel splitter box, and the accompanying software (See Materials Sheet).Use custom-length cables to connect the stimulator\u2019s channel ports to the superior electronic pedestal of each commutator. Note: The length needed will depend on the individual laboratory. These cables are outside of the animal area and do not need to be covered in stainless steel spring.\nConnect the inferior electronic pedestal of the commutator to the implanted electrode pedestal on the rodent\u2019s head cap using 16-in cables covered with stainless steel spring. Ensure that the cables are long enough to allow free movement to every area of the enclosure without significant tension on the head cap. Note: A cable that ends roughly where the head of the rat would be when standing on all four feet is usually adequate.\nBrain Stimulation Programming\n\t\nUse a personal computer and programming software to program the stimulation parameters (e.g., waveform, frequency, pulse width, inter-stimulus delay, current amplitude) and collect the experimental data.\nUsing a visual programming language, specify which functions each device will perform to meet the experimental endpoints and which data will be stored and/or projected for viewing in real-time. The commands that run this particular project are demonstrated in Figure 1.\nSpecify the desired frequency, pulse width, and amplitude into the visual control panel (Figure 2) prior to the start of the experiment. Typical parameters for high frequency stimulation in rats are similar to those used in clinical human deep brain stimulation: frequency of 130 to180 Hz, pulse width of 60 to 90 msec, and current amplitude of 100 to 250 \u03bcA4,8-10. Note: A lower current is used in the rodent due to its reduced size compared to the primate.\n7. Deep Brain Stimulation ProcedureTo load rats into the boxes, attach the stainless steel spring cable from the commutator to each electrode pedestal on the head cap. Test the impedance of each electrode by running 5 \u03bcA of current at a frequency of 1,000 Hz for 2 sec.\n\t\nIf impedance is equal to or less than 125 KOhm, then proceed with the experiment because the electrode is able to deliver therapeutic stimulation. If the impedance is greater than 125 KOhm, consider removing the animal from the experiment because the electrode\u2019s high resistance may truncate the current to potentially sub-therapeutic levels.\nRun the rats through one or two mock sessions for habituation during which they will be attached to the electrode cable(s) but not receiving any active therapy. Mock testing will eliminate any non-specific behavioral effects. Immediately following each mock session, transport the rats to the operant boxes for the daily 2-hr session of IV methamphetamine self-administration.\nCounter-balance rats into two groups, an active-stimulation and a sham-stimulation cohort so that the baseline drug intake is not significantly different between groups.\nPerform daily DBS sessions on the rodent cohort for 5 days during which they receive either active electrical brain stimulation or no stimulation for 3 hr depending on their group assignment. Immediately following each DBS session, transport rats to the operant boxes for the daily 2-hr session of IV methamphetamine self-administration.\n\t\nObserve animals carefully during at least a portion of each DBS session to make sure the stimulation is not causing clear alterations in animal behavior. If any abnormal behaviors occur during/after stimulation, take care to document these observations. Note: The authors have not noticed significant behavioral alterations or changes in food/water intake during the experiment described in this article.Alter the length of DBS treatment, the electrical parameters, and the time between the DBS session and the operant session as needed depending on the hypothesis.", "<p>The full procedure is divided into four distinct protocols, concerning (A) the collection of the bee samples; (B) the processing and management of the samples; (C) the pathogen and parasite assays, and (D) the genetic identification of the bee species.

Bee foraging behavior is affected by weather conditions<sup>43</sup> and species of flower<sup>44-46</sup>, and differs furthermore between bee species<sup>44-49</sup>. Since bee pathogens can be transmitted through floral visitation networks<sup>11-15</sup>, and are also directly affected by temperature<sup>50</sup>, weather conditions and the floral character of the landscape are important metadata to collect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1.</strong>\t\t<strong>Sample collection:</strong></p><p>a) Collect 30 individual honey bees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) and 30 individual wild bees, in the order in which they are encountered </p><p>b) Collect 15 additional specimens of the commonest wild bee species</p><p>c) Collect all samples on the same day during high flight activity of bees (above 15<sup>\u00b0</sup>C and less than 80% cloud cover) in spring/summer (April-August in the Northern Hemisphere).</p><p>d) Collect all bees within the same 100 m x 100 m flower-rich area from flowers</p><p>e) If a particular bee species is at a high density on one patch of flowers, collect a maximum of five individuals from that patch then move to collect from other patches within your single 100 m x 100 m area</p><p>f) Place each insect individually into a tube, labelled in the order in which the bees were collected.

Aside from sampling artefact, the larger purpose of this is to attempt to distinguish between those microbial agents that are infectious to the bee tissues, and are therefore a potential health threat; those that are part of the bee microbiome, both internal and external, and those that are passively associated with the bee but not infectious to bee tissues. We have therefore also included several simple processing and assay strategies that maximize our ability to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious agents. One means to do this is to separate the body parts of the bees:</p><p><strong><u>Abdomen</u></strong><u>,</u> where nearly all internal bee pathogens replicate, in the bee tissues, and shed their</p><p>replicative propagules (spores/oocysts/virus particles <em>etc.</em>) in the gut lumen for voiding into the</p><p>environment, with the faeces. The abdomen also contains passively acquired, non-infectious</p><p>agents, both internally in the gut and externally on the exoskeleton.</p><p><strong><u>Head</u></strong><u>,</u> where many of the viral pathogens actively replicate, and occasionally shed particles into the</p><p>salivary and hypopharyngeal glands, especially in honey bees.</p><p><strong><u>Thorax</u></strong><u>,</u> containing few internal (or external) microbes.</p><p><strong><u>Wings &amp; Legs</u></strong><u>,</u> containing pollen baskets. Pathogens can be shared between bees through flower-</p><p>visitor networks, especially on pollen.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the abdomen contains by far the highest concentrations of pathogens, there is little loss of detection sensitivity from excluding the head, thorax and legs-wings, which can be retained separately for other studies. For example, the DNA/RNA from legs, wings and thoraxes contain very little contaminating microbial nucleic acids and are therefore optimally suited for possible host bee genetic analyses. In order to allow for the widest possible types of additional, future analyses on the material, it is best to prepare the primary homogenate in a neutral, aqueous buffer and only extract RNA and DNA from an aliquot of primary homogenate, with the remainder stored at -80 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C. There is no loss in detection sensitivity of the pathogens (or host mRNAs) from such a neutral primary extract <u>as long as the extract is either frozen or added to the nucleic acid extraction buffers within 5 minutes.</u> There are also several options at the assay level to distinguish active and passive infections, <em>vide infra</em>. Such measures are not entirely fool proof, but greatly improve the chances of finding truly infecting pathogens.</p><p>The protocols described below are loosely based on the COLOSS BeeBook chapters \u201cStandard methods for virus research in <em>Apis mellifera</em>\u201d<sup>18</sup> \u201cStandard methods for research on <em>Apis mellifera</em> gut symbionts\u201d<sup>37</sup> and \u201cStandard methods for molecular research in <em>Apis mellifera</em>\u201d<sup>17</sup>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3.</strong>\t\t<strong>Bee size estimation:</strong></p><p>a) Remove from the freezer the number of bees needed for a single extraction run</p><p>b) Record the weight of each bee on a fine scale (in mg)</p><p>c) Using a fine caliper, record the inter-tegular distance (ITD) of each bee,<em> i.e.</em> the distance across</p><p>the thorax between the insertion points of the wings (to the nearest 0.1 mm)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4.</strong>\t\t<strong>Dissection:</strong></p><p>a) Perform the dissections on a frozen (carbo-ice) dissection plate, if possible</p><p>b) Separate <strong><u>H</u></strong>ead, <strong><u>T</u></strong>horax, <strong><u>W</u></strong>ings/legs from the <strong><u>A</u></strong>bdomen using a sterile scalpel/razor blade and</p><p>place each in a separate marked container</p><p>c) The scalpel can be sterilised between bees by dipping in ethanol and burning off the ethanol</p><p>with a flame&nbsp;</p><p>d) Store the H, T, W and A sub-samples at -80 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C until further use</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5.</strong>\t\t<strong>Buffer preparation:</strong></p><p>a) Sterile TBS buffer: 50 mM TRIS.HCl pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl</p><p>b) Lysozyme Lysis buffer: 20 mM TRIS.HCl pH8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1.2% Triton X100, 20 mg/mL</p><p>Lysozyme</p><p>c) TBS/RNA250/pJET buffer: On the day of use, add to TBS buffer (see above) RNA250 to a final</p><p>concentration of 10 ng/mL and pJET1.2 to a final concentration of 1 ng/mL, based on the</p><p>concentrations given in the product sheets, as passive RNA and DNA reference standards, for</p><p>posterior normalization of the data for methodological differences between individual samples in</p><p>homogenization and nucleic acid extraction efficiency</p><p>d) The amount of TBS/RNA250/pJET buffer needed for an individual bee abdomen is:</p><p>Bumble bee sized abdomen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;800 \u00b5L TBS/RNA250/pJET</p><p>Honey bee sized abdomen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500 \u00b5L TBS/RNA250/pJET</p><p>Small sweat bee sized abdomen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 \u00b5L TBS/RNA250/pJET</p><p>e) Orchard and mason bees would be similar in size to honey bees;

The reason for this is in part efficiency (fewer assays to run) and in part to avoid false negative results due to assay insufficiencies (Type-II errors). Type-I errors (false positive results) are mostly due to trace contamination and are easily avoided by restricting the number of amplification cycles to 35, rather than 40<sup>17,42,51</sup> For accurate quantification we recommend buying synthetic external quantification standards (<em>e.g.</em> ThermoFisher), based on the product sequences (Supplementary Information 3), rather than home-made standards from either purified plasmid clones of the fragment, or purified PCR product, primarily to guarantee uniformity of standards and quantification between different labs, as well as better absolute quantification with synthetically produced, and accurately quantified, standards.A key element of these quantitative assays is the use of the passive external reference nucleic acids, RNA250 and pJET1.2. These were added in exact known quantities at the start of the homogenization and nucleic acid extraction protocol and the amounts of these left in each cDNA and DNA template can be measured exactly through qPCR, similar to how the pathogen amounts are measured. The ratio of RNA250/pJET measured by qPCR in a standard template volume to the known amount originally added prior to extraction is therefore a simple, one-step conversion factor for all the individual, sample-specific methodological errors and losses incurred from homogenization through qPCR, for accurate absolute quantification of the amounts of each target in the original bee. It will reduce, if not eliminate, random methodological noise from the dataset and improve the chances of detecting true biological differences between the samples. Another key feature is that the qPCR assays are all designed to work with the same thermocycling profile, to enable different assays to be run in the same thermocycling run, and produce similar medium-sized PCR products, to facilitate distinguishing true product from illegitimate secondary products through either Melting Curve analysis or agarose gel electrophoresis.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>11.</strong>\t<strong>qPCR amplification:</strong></p><p>a) Add 2 \u00b5L diluted DNA or cDNA template to 18 \u00b5L qPCR reaction mixture (<em>e.g.</em> BioRad EvaGreen)</p><p>containing 0.2 \u00b5M each of forward and reverse primers for the assay being run (Supplementary</p><p>Table 1)</p><p>b) Include in each run a 7-step ten-fold dilution series of a (preferably synthetic) positive control of</p><p>known concentration, as well as a template-free negative control (<em>e.g. </em>ddH<sub>2</sub>O)</p><p>c) Amplify the target with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended thermocycling profile for a ~500 bp</p><p>fragment, a fluorescent dye-based detection chemistry (<em>e.g.</em> SYBR-green, EvaGreen), for</p><p>primers with a melting temperature of 58 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C, and for no more than 35 cycles, <em>e.g.</em> 95 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:30sec +</p><p>35x[95 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:15sec \u2013 58 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:20sec \u2013 72 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:30sec - read] + 72 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:60sec</p><p>d) Following the amplification stage with a Melting Curve (MC) analysis profile for confirming product</p><p>identity, <em>e.g. </em>reading the fluorescence at 0.5 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C intervals from 55 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C to 95 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C</p><p>e) Confirm the absence of amplification in the template-free negative control</p><p>f) Discard all positive results whose MC profile and peak does not match to within 1.0 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C of the MC</p><p>profiles and peaks for the positive controls</p><p><br></p><p><strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolute quantification and passive reference normalization:</strong></p><p>a) Obtain for each sample-assay combination the SQ (Starting Quantity) value, estimated by plotting</p><p>the Cq values against the known amounts (preferably as \u2018<strong><u>copy number</u></strong>\u2019) of the synthetic</p><p>external reference standards</p><p>b) Calculate the total number of <strong><u>copies</u></strong> of RNA250 and pJET1.2 molecules added to each abdomen</p><p>prior to extraction, from the volume of TBS-RNA250-pJET buffer added and the molecular</p><p>weights of RNA250 (641991 g/mol) and pJET1.2 (1837503 g/mol)</p><p>c) For each sample, calculate the RNA250out/RNA250in ratio by dividing the sample\u2019s individual SQ</p><p>value for its RNA250 amplification (RNA250out) by the calculated amount of RNA250 added to</p><p>the abdomen prior to extraction (RNA250in)</p><p>d) Divide each sample\u2019s SQ values for the different RNA pathogens (cDNA amplifications) by the</p><p>sample\u2019s RNA250out/RNA250in ratio, to obtain the estimated total amount of pathogen RNA in</p><p>the original abdomen</p><p>e) Follow the same procedure for the pJETout/pJETin ratios and the DNA pathogen amplifications</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BARCODE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOL</strong></p><p>Some bees may be difficult to identify in the field, either because they are cryptic (<em>i.e.</em> morphological features that overlap with other bee species), dirty or damaged. Occasionally a species may lack a morphological identification key. In these cases, it is usually possible to identify specimen through DNA barcode analysis, <em>i.e.</em> by sequencing one of several well-established barcoding genes in the bee nuclear or mitochondrial genomes. Most animals, particularly insects, are barcoded using a <em>c.a.</em> 650 bp fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (<em>cox1</em>) gene, which is sufficiently variable to be able to uniquely distinguish even closely related species<sup>25,26</sup>. A critical requirement is that the DNA template is sufficiently pure to only amplify the <em>cox1</em> region of the bee, and not of any contaminating DNA from eukaryotic parasites or plants. This effectively rules out using the purified DNA from bee abdomens for use in barcoding analysis, since this DNA consists of the genomes of all organisms residing in the bee gut, as well as some of the bee. The simplest approach is to amplify the <em>cox1 </em>directly from a snippet of leg, wing or thorax tissue<sup>27</sup>. Each bee cell contains many mitochondria, each of which contains numerous copies of the mitochondrial genome<sup>52,53</sup>, so that even the tiniest trace amount of tissue contains thousands of copies of the mitochondrial genome, more than enough for PCR amplification. In fact, there is greater danger that too much template is added to the PCR reaction, which can inhibit the PCR and the production of sufficient PCR product for sequencing<sup>51</sup>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>13.</strong>\t<strong><em>Cox1</em> barcode amplification:</strong></p><p>a)\tAliquot 10 \u03bcL PCR master mix containing 0.2 mM dNTP and 0.4 \u00b5M each of primers LCO-1490 (GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG) and HCO-2198 (TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA)</p><p>b)\tAdd with sterile forceps a snippet of a bee wing or a leg tarsa, or poke a disposable 10 \u03bcL pipette tip in the bee thorax and stir in the buffer</p><p>c)\tEnough DNA will transfer for amplification</p><p>d)&nbsp;Amplify the <em>cox1</em> gene with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended thermocycling profile for a ~650 bp fragment, for primers with a melting temperature of 51 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C, and for no more than 35 cycles, <em>e.g.</em> 95 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:30sec + 35x[95 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:15sec \u2013 51 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:15sec \u2013 72 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:30sec] + 72 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:60sec</p><p>e)\tRun 1 \u03bcL PCR product on an agarose gel to check the product size and absence of secondary products</p><p>f)\tSubmit the PCR product for sequencing by any of a number of commercial sequencing companies</p><p>g)\tMost bees can be barcoded with these primers but some species are difficult to amplifying at the <em>cox1</em>barcode with these primers<sup>54</sup></p><p>h)\tIf the <em>cox1 </em>barcode of a particular bee does not amplify with these primers<sup>54</sup>, then try an alternative forward primer, LCO-1790 (GCTTTCCCACGAATAAAATAATA), which can be used<sup>26</sup> together with HCO-2198 (TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA) primer</p><p>i)\tAmplify the shorter <em>cox1</em>product using the manufacturer\u2019s recommended PCR protocol for a ~400 bp fragment, for primers with a melting temperature of 54 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C, and for no more than 35 cycles, <em>e.g.</em> 95 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:30sec + 35x[95 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:15sec \u2013 54 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:15sec \u2013 72 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:30sec] + 72 <sup>\u00b0</sup>C:60sec</p><p><br></p><p><strong>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Cox1</em> barcode sequencing &amp; analysis:</strong></p><p>a)\t<strong><em><u>OPTIONAL:</u></em></strong> To ascertain whether the amplification has been successful or not, run 1 \u03bcL of each PCR reaction (or a representative selection of PCR products) on a 0.8% agarose gel in a suitable TRIS/EDTA buffer system, including a nucleic acid binding dye, as recommended by a standard molecular laboratory manual<sup>55</sup>, and visualize the bands alongside a molecular weight marker.</p><p>b)\tIf the <em>cox1</em> barcode amplifications have been successful, submit the reactions to a commercial sequencing service together with the corresponding LCO and HCO amplification primers for sample purification and Sanger sequencing of both strands of each DNA template</p><p>c)\tCheck the quality of the sequence produced (usually included in the sequencing results)</p><p>d)\tCombine the forward and reverse sequences into a single consensus sequence for each sample, using any of a number of public or proprietary sequence analyses programmes (<em>e.g.</em> SeqScanner, 4peaks, Lasergene, Geneious)</p><p>e)\tSubmit your consensus sequence to the BOLD database (<a href=\"http://www.boldsystems.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.boldsystems.org</a>) for species identification of your sample</p><p>f)\tIf you have a shorter sequence, search for a possible match in the GenBank database (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) using the BLASTn programme</p>", "The Institutional Review Board at the University of Southern California approved this study.\n1.\u00a0System Preparation\nSet up the motion capture system.

Example, marker 9 on the right foot and marker 21 on the left foot. Marker 9 is the center LED on the right foot rigid body circled in yellow in Figure 1. Marker 21 is the center LED on the left foot rigid body.\nAt the end of the 2 min baseline, the mobile program will set the threshold at a height of one standard deviation (SD) above the average height of both feet during the 2 min baseline condition.\nOn both days from min 2 to 8, the acquisition condition, observe as the infant mobile rotates and plays music when the LED placed on either foot crosses the threshold computed during the 2 min baseline condition of Day 1.NOTE: Mobile activation will continue for as long as the foot is above the virtual threshold to a maximum of 3 sec. After 3 sec, the mobile will reactivate only if the infant moves the foot below the virtual threshold, and then moves the foot vertically and again crosses the threshold. This \u201c3 sec rule\u201d encourages active leg exploratory movements versus holding the feet above the threshold.\nOn Day 2 from min 8-10, the extinction condition, observe as the infant kicks spontaneously without mobile reinforcement.\nAfter the infant interacts with the mobile, collect a static calibration trial to define a local coordinate system for each leg segment and define a reference configuration for each body segment in space.\n\t\nFix ten individual LEDs bilaterally to the infant\u2019s skin using double-sided EKG collars at the following locations: lateral midline of the trunk below the tenth rib, greater trochanter of the hip, lateral knee joint line, ankle lateral malleolus, and distal end of the 5th metatarsal.\nHold the infant\u2019s lower extremity in an extended, anatomical position for 5 sec. All joint angles in this calibration position are defined as 0\u00b0.\nOn Day 2, collect anthropometric data.\n\t\nWeigh each infant on a digital electric scale.\nTake the following measurements: total length of the infant; circumference at mid-segment of thigh, shank, and foot; width of knee (at the knee joint line), ankle (at the malleoli), and foot (at the metatarsal heads); and length of the thigh (greater trochanter to knee joint line), shank (knee joint line to lateral malleolus), and foot (medial malleolus to first metatarsophalangeal joint).\n4. Data AnalysisAnalyze performance and learning by computing the %RLA during each 2 min interval of the experiment using a custom computing language program such as Matlab. Compute the duration of time one or both of the LEDs on each foot that activated the mobile were above the threshold. Since the mobile does not activate after an interval of 3 sec, subtract the duration of time in which one or both LEDs were above the threshold for greater than a 3 sec interval.\n\t\nMeasure performance of the group each day by statistically analyzing whether the %RLA during any one of the three, 2 min acquisition intervals significantly exceeds the 2 min baseline interval3,4,7,9,10.\nCategorize individual infants as having performed the task each day if the %RLA during any one 2 min acquisition interval is equal to or greater than 1.5 times the %RLA in the 2 min baseline interval3,4,6,9,10.\nMeasure learning of the group across days by determining statistically whether the %RLA during the entire 6 min acquisition condition Day 2 exceeds the %RLA during the baseline condition Day 13,6.\nCategorize individual infants as Learners if the %RLA during the entire 6 min acquisition condition of Day 2 is equal to or greater than 1.5 times the baseline condition of Day 13,6,11.\nAnalyze arousal and attention by coding videotapes during each 2 min interval of the experiment. The arousal scale is defined as: drowsy = 1, alert and inactive = 2, alert and active = 3, fussy = 4, and crying = 53,8,11. The attention scale is defined as: 0 = not looking at the mobile, 1 = looking at the mobile3,8.\nProcess position data and extract kicks using custom Matlab programs.Load position data files outputted from the motion capture system into a custom Matlab program to interpolate missing position data (maximum of 20 consecutive frames) using a cubic spline.\nLoad the interpolated files into a custom Matlab program to (a) filter position data using a fourth-order Butterworth with a cut-off frequency of 5 Hz as determined from power spectrum analysis, and (b) compute the following joint angles: hip flexion/extension, hip abduction/adduction, hip external/internal rotation, knee flexion/extension, ankle inversion/eversion, ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion as described in 12.\nLoad the angle files into a custom Matlab program to extract kicks. Define the beginning of a kick as the onset of a continuous leg movement in which the hip or knee joint angle change exceeded 11.5\u00b0 (0.2 radians) into either flexion or extension3,9,13-15. Define the end of the kick as the frame of peak extension following a flexion movement or peak flexion following an extension movement3,9,14.\nFor all kicks, compute kinematic parameters using custom Matlab programs.\n\t\nCompute position variance in the z-direction (vertical, task-specific direction) of the LED on each foot that activated the mobile3.\nCompute hip flexion/extension and knee flexion/extension joint correlations using Pearson correlation coefficients (r) at zero lag between hip and knee joint angle excursions. To compare correlations (r) among infants, convert hip-knee joint angle correlations to Fisher Z scores3,9,15.\nTime-normalize the joint angle data, then compute hip flexion/extension and knee flexion/extension continuous relative phase (CRP) from the angular position/velocity data16,17. Analyze the results of the CRP computation at the following five time points: (a) beginning of kick, (b) peak velocity of the first segment, (c) joint reversal, (d) peak velocity of the second segment, and (e) end of kick3.\nFor all kicks, identify non-contact kicks by viewing the synchronous video data. Compute kinetic parameters for non-contact kicks using custom Matlab programs.Compute the segmental mass and center-of-mass from equations modified for infants from Hatze\u2019s anthropometric model for adults18. Compute the 3D moments of inertia of the thigh, shank, and foot segments from equations modified for infants from Jensen\u2019s anthropometric model for adults19.\nCalculate the terms in the following equation of motion using the screw theory of spatial manipulations20.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52841/52841equation1.jpg\n\t\tis derived using the Lagrangian approach, where M(\u03b8) is the inertia matrix, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52841/theta1.jpg\u00a0the Coriolis and centrifugal torque matrix, N(\u03b8) the gravitational (GRA) torques and T the muscle (MUS) torques.\nCompute joint torques using the 3D kinematic data from the non-contact kicks, body-segment inertial parameters, and the biomechanic equation of motion.\nPartition the net (NET) torque at each joint into motion-dependent (MDT), GRA, and MUS torque contributions21. NET torque is directly proportional to the accelerations at each joint. MDT torque is related to the passive torques associated with mechanical interactions among the moving interconnected segments of the limb. GRA torque is related to the passive force of gravity acting downward on the limb. MUS torque includes forces from active muscle contractions and passive deformations of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and other periarticular tissues.For the hip and knee separately, compute torque impulse as the magnitude of the contribution of each partitioned torque (MUS, GRA, MDT) to NET torque. Compute the positive or negative torque impulse (torque * time) during intervals in which the knee MUS torque acted in the same or opposite direction compared with the knee NET torque. Perform this same computation with knee GRA and MDT torques and hip MUS, GRA, and MDT torques. For the hip and knee separately, sum all positive and negative impulses for each torque component to yield a measure of the magnitude of the contribution of each partitioned torque impulse (MUS, GRA, MDT) to NET torque impulse.\nSubscription Required.

Circadian and sleep analysis are then conducted.\nIf focusing on foragers as in Tasman et\u00a0al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25], these can be selected by only using bees seen coming out of the colony and feeding at feeders in the foraging arena, with a thorax diameter of approximately 5\u00a0mm (the average size for foragers, (Goulson et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). In honeybees and bumblebees, nurses show an attenuation of circadian rhythms so experiments should be mindful of which bees are included in their study. Collect an adequate sample size, using several different colonies to control for any colony specific effects. In Tasman et\u00a0al., (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25] we collected 30 foragers each from 4 colonies, providing a sample size of 40 foragers for each treatment.\nLoad bees into individual tubes in the adapted LAM set up and monitor for five day in 12\u00a0h light and 12\u00a0h dark (LD) conditions, followed by five days of constant darkness (DD). Activity bouts (recorded via infra-red (IR) beam crosses by the LAM), should be summed into bins for analysis. We used 30\u00a0min bins (Tasman et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]), but other studies have used 60\u00a0min bins (Chittka et al 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Smaller bins will provide more fine scale analysis of activity.Circadian analysis should then be carried out. There are a range of circadian analyses and the specific ones chosen will depend on the focus of the study. We chose to calculate the rhythmicity statistic, period length and total daily activity levels, as these are common measures and provide information on how active the foragers are, how strong their locomotor rhythms are and the length of their free running period. The gives a good basic overview of the function of the clock. Below is a description of how to measure these, with some example data provided in the quantification and statistical analysis section:\nThe rhythmicity statistic (RS) is a measure of rhythmicity strength. It calculates the auto correlation of locomotor activity on consecutive days. Conventionally, an RS greater than 2 is rhythmic, an RS of 1.5\u20132 is weakly rhythmic, and an RS less than 1.5 is arrhythmic (Hodge and Stanewsky, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). The RS is calculated using conventional autocorrelation analysis. First, the data are filtered, using a low-pass Butterworth filter to remove any periodicities of less than 4 h.\nThe dataset is then paired with itself, gradually moved out of register with itself and the correlation coefficient plotted. At 0 h, the two data sets are identical, and then, for rhythmic data, they return to high correlation approximately every 24 h.The value of the third peak in the auto correlogram is reported as the rhythmicity index (RI), a statistical representation of the rhythmicity of the bee\u2019s activity (example shown in Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The Rhythmicity Statistic (RS) is calculated as the ratio of this RI to the value of the 95% confidence line (Levine et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). The period length is also calculated from the auto correlogram, by calculating the time between the peaks in correlation. This analysis can be carried out using FlyToolBox (Levine et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) in MATLAB (MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release 2015b).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/718-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. An example of an auto correlogram for locomotor activity, from which period length, RI and RS can be calculated\nThe day and night activity levels for each bee can be calculated using the daynight program (Julienne et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) in MATLAB. The individual bee\u2019s period length is used to split the activity data into subjective days and nights and then the activity counts for each are summed. The mean daily activity in daytime and night-time for the five days are then calculated.\nNote: LD and DD data should be split and analyzed separately.Sleep analysis should be carried out on the five days of LD (Buhl et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), using activity data that have been summed into both 1\u00a0min and 30\u00a0min bins. In invertebrates, bouts of inactivity lasting more than 5\u00a0min tend to be quantified as sleep (Beyaert et\u00a0al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Nagari et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Eban-Rothschild and Bloch, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Analysis can be performed using the Sleep and Circadian Analysis MATLAB Program (SCAMP, Donelson et\u00a0al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Again, there are many ways to quantify sleep. We calculated mean total sleep per 30\u00a0min bin, as well as mean number and length of sleep episodes per day. This gives a good overview of the quantity and structure of sleep achieved by the individual. An example of the sort of sleep analysis that can be provided by SCAMP can be seen in Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/718-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. An example sleep plot for a control bee, taken from Tasman et\u00a0al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]\nThe plot shows the mean quantity of sleep (\u00b1 SEM) achieved every 30\u00a0m of the 24\u00a0h period in LD conditions.\nNote: Measuring sleep under LD is standard practice for this sort of analysis as users can accurately measure what quantity and quality of sleep is occurring in the day compared to the night. It is also more relevant to field conditions. Locomotor activity is measured in DD to give an insight into the function of the endogenous clock when external cues are removed.\nCritical: As mentioned in the \u2018before you begin\u2019 section, it is essential that foragers have been given at least 3\u00a0days in the colony to entrain to the 12 h: 12\u00a0h LD schedule before they are collected and used in the LAM.Note: Other values can be extracted from the SCAMP program, such as sleep latency (the time after lights turn off before first sleep bout).\nNote: Only bees that showed activity bouts up until the end of the experiment were included in analysis, to remove any inactive or dead bees.\nCritical: Data from the LAM must be processed by the DAMFileScan 108\u00d7 (free to download from www.trikinetics.com[href=http://www.trikinetics.com]) and then the \u2018.txt\u2019 extension has to be removed from the file name before it can be used by FlyToolBox. For a full description of how to use the FlyToolBox see Levine et al, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17].\nCritical: When setting up the LAM, make sure to set the program to collect data every 1\u00a0min, so that it can be summed into both 1\u00a0m and 30\u00a0m bins (or whatever size bin is being used for the activity data), allowing the data to be used for both circadian and sleep analysis.\nForaging rhythmicity assay for colonies\nTiming: 10\u00a0days\nCircadian rhythmicity within the colony can be assayed using a micro-RFID setup (Microsensys GmbH), (Stelzer and Chittka, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). This is used to monitor the movement of foragers in and out of the colony and to estimate their foraging activity and rhythmicity.\nApproximately 40 foragers should be collected from the foraging arena, in the same way as previously described in the LAM set up. They should be anesthetized using CO2, and an RFID tag (Microsensys GmbH mic3-TAG) stuck to the center of their thorax with superglue (Loctite) as in Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Foragers should then be returned to the colony nest box.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/718-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. An example of RFID-tagged Bombus terrestris foragersAfter a day for acclimatization and recovery from the CO2 exposure, recording can begin. An RFID reader (Microsensys GmbH iID\u00aeMAJAreadermodule4.1) is placed at the entrance to the foraging arena so that foragers pass through the reader to enter the arena. The data from the readers are collected on a host (microsensys GmbH iID\u00aeHOSTtypeMAJA4.1), for a 10-day period; 5-day LD and 5\u00a0day DD, as in the LAM experiments above.\nThe data are then summed into bins, 30\u00a0min or other, as required by the experiment, with each pass through the reader being counted as a single activity bout. These data can then be analyzed in the same way as the individual locomotor data above, to provide in and out bout rhythmicity data for each tagged forager.\nNote: Sometimes foragers sit in the reader, causing continuous reading of their RFID tag by the reader- this is discussed in the trouble shooting section.\nCritical: As mentioned in the \u2018before you begin\u2019 section, it is essential that foragers have been given at least 3\u00a0days to entrain to the 12:12 LD schedule before recording begins.\nNote: Only those that showed foraging activity every day of the study period were used for analysis, ensuring that only foragers were assessed. For control groups in our study (Tasman et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]) this was 24, 27 and 29 bees per colony. For the treatment group this was 10, 17 and 21 bees per colony.Note: For these experiments, passing through the reader was taken as a single in/out activity bout and the number of bouts in total was taken as a measure of foraging activity. This is like other rhythmicity analysis carried out with bumblebees using RFID tags (Stelzer and Chittka, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). However, if the experimenter wants to also look at the length of foraging bouts etc. then two readers could be used, one at the entrance to the colony and one at the entrance to the foraging arena, to determine directionality of the foragers. This is discussed further in the limitations section.", "All procedures were approved by the Boston University Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n1. Recruitment\nIdentify potential participants through participant databases (if available), through publicly available state birth records, through online advertising, and through face-to-face recruitment events.\nCall potential participants and invite them to participate in the study.\n\t\nExplain that the study is looking at social experiences and how they relate to brain development.\nExplain that a visit would involve using EEG to get a measure of the infant's brain activity using a stretchy cap made of soft sponges. Explain that the infant would sit on the parent's lap while looking at pictures on a computer monitor and playing peekaboo with an experimenter, and that this allows to see brain activity.\nExplain how long the visit lasts and that a visit can be scheduled whenever is most convenient for the parent, based on the infant's schedule.

Running a Visit\nNOTE: Schedule the visit for a time when the infant will be alert and well rested. Have two experimenters available. The lead experimenter will do the net application and administer the conditions during EEG recording.

Place the monitors 18 inches apart. Place a chair (where the parent and infant will sit) 24 inches from the table and facing the computer monitors. Leave at least 24 inches between the table and the back wall of the booth (so the experimenter can stand behind the table facing the infant). Ensure that the chair and table are at a height such that the computer monitors are at the infant's eye level.\nPosition two speakers on the ground on either side of the table, directed towards the chair where the parent and infant will sit.\nPosition a tripod video camera under the table and facing up so that the infant's face is in clear view.\nHang an opaque curtain immediately behind the table for the experimenter to stand behind to be hidden from the infant's view during the nonsocial and language-only conditions.\nPlace a rattle, a small stuffed animal, and cereal in the booth. Use the same rattle and animal for all participants.\nWelcoming the family\n\t\nOn arrival, offer the parent an opportunity to feed and change the infant before beginning.\nObtain informed parental consent.\nExplain the EEG and paradigm.\n\t\t\nExplain that EEG involves a net made of soft sponges that are soaked in warm water, which measures brain activity. Explain that the EEG net does not emit anything, but just measures electrical activity released from the neurons in the brain communicating with each other.\nTell the parent that the infant will look at pictures on a screen and interact with the experimenter.Explain that sometimes the experimenter will be behind the curtain, hidden from view. Emphasize that it is important for the parent not to be social with the infant, such as talking to the infant or making face-to-face contact.\nExplain that 20 min can be a long time and that if the infant gets bored or fussy, the parent can give him a toy (e.g., the rattle or stuffed animal) or cereal.\nExplain the net application procedure to the parent.\n\t\t\nInform the parent that the EEG net is like a swim cap and that infants typically do not like hats.\n\t\t\tNOTE: When the experimenter puts the net on, most infants will fuss and try to pull the net off. Tell the parent not to worry and emphasize that this is normal and infants typically get used to the net, stop crying and calm down quickly.\nExplain to the parent that their help is important to make sure the infant does not pull on the net and if the infant moves their arms up towards their head, to gently push their arms down and away from the net.\nExplain that the experimenter is very practiced at putting the net on quickly. Explain that the second experimenter will distract the infant during net application using the rattle and stuffed animal.\nAsk the parent if they would like a picture taken of their infant wearing the EEG net to take home.\nInform the parent that there may be faint pressure marks that look like little circles on the infant's head when the net is removed, but that they will fade quickly. Also, mention that the infant's hair will be slightly damp.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For this study, parents were compensated $40.\nNet applicationMeasure the infant's head in cm at the widest point using a soft tape measure. Choose the appropriate sized EEG net.\nMicrowave an electrolyte solution (6 cc potassium chloride (KCl)/L distilled water) for 3 min. Add a teaspoon of baby shampoo.\nSoak the correct-sized high-density net (this study used a 128-lead net; a 64-lead net is also suitable) for 10 min in the heated electrolyte solution. This will facilitate electrical contact between the scalp and electrodes.\nFill pipettes with the electrolyte solution and put in the booth.\nUse a towel to pat off excess water from the net to prevent bridging. Carry the net on the towel and show the parent the net. Have the parent touch the net (if interested).\nHave the parent sit on the chair in the booth with the infant on their lap.\n\t\t\nRemind the parent that the infant may become upset and that this is normal. Remind the parent that the second experimenter will distract the infant with the rattle and stuffed animal. Remind the parent to keep the infant from touching or pulling on the net. Remind the parent not to engage in social interaction with the infant during EEG recording.\nPlace both hands inside the net, gently stretch the net and lower it so that it fits over the infant's head. Place the Cz electrode on the vertex of the head. Keep both hands inside the net during positioning.\nWhen the net is positioned on the infant's head, remove hands from inside the net and tighten the chinstrap so that the net is secure. Inspect the net for correct positioning and make adjustments as necessary.Measure electrode impedance using the EEG recording software (each electrode should be below 50 k\u03a9, if using a high impedance system). Administer the electrolyte solution using the pipettes by squeezing a few drops on to the electrodes with poor contact. If necessary, gently move the infant's hair so that the electrodes are in better contact with the scalp.\nOnce impedance is at an acceptable level, save the impedance information.\nEEG Recording\n\t\nRecording Parameters\n\t\t\nRecord data according to manufacturer specifications. Represented data were sampled from all channels at 500 Hz.\nStimuli presentation\n\t\t\nPresent a series of 10 color photographs of objects on the computer monitors for 13.0 - 14.5 s, at variable interstimulus intervals (0.5 - 2.0 s). Display the same photograph on both screens. Present the photographs as similar sizes in middle of the screens (see supplementary materials for list of stimuli in each block and stimuli files).\n\t\t\tNOTE: A subtle and brief clicking sound alerts the experimenter to stimuli onset. The photographs are of common nonsocial objects (e.g., flower, glove) and the same 10 categories of objects are repeated across blocks. The individual objects within a category vary in terms of color. Their distribution across the blocks is counterbalanced and the same colors are represented in each block to maintain consistency in the infant's viewing experience (see Figure 1 for example).\nConditions\n\t\t\nGo into the booth behind the computer screens and table and face the infant.\nOpen the curtain during the joint attention and social engagement conditions so that the infant can see the experimenter. Close the curtain so the experimenter is hidden from the infant's view during the nonsocial and language-only conditions.Administer four conditions: nonsocial, joint attention, social engagement, and language-only. Present each condition twice for a total of eight blocks. Administer each block for 2.5 min to maintain infant attention.\n\t\t\nAdminister the blocks in the following sequence: social engagement, nonsocial, joint attention, language-only, joint attention, nonsocial, social engagement, and language-only. Present a white screen on the computers and use a bell sound to alert the experimenter to start the next block.\n\t\t\t\nFor social engagement, lean on the table between the computer monitors. Be face-to-face with the infant. Maintain the infant's attention so that the infant does not focus on the screens (as identical objects continue to appear). Look only at the infant throughout the condition. Do not look or point at the screens.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: If the infant points at the pictures, try to pull the infant's attention back, but do not follow the infant's gaze. Ensure that joint attention is not present. Have a positive affect and respond contingently. In each block, sing children's songs with hand motions, (e.g., Itsy Bitsy Spider, The Wheels on the Bus) and play peek-a-boo. Adapt as necessary to maintain the infant's interest. Maintain positive affect throughout the block.\nFor the nonsocial condition, go behind the curtain (to be hidden from infant view). Stay silent throughout the condition.\nFor the joint attention condition, lean on the table between the computer monitors and be face-to-face with the infant. Direct the infant's attention to the pictures on the monitors and comment on the pictures. Follow the specified script of utterances and pointing directions for each trial as described in Table 1. See Table 1 for list of blocks and specific utterances for each trial.At the start of each trial, make eye contact with the infant and continue bids for the infant's attention until the infant looks. Turn in a pre-specified direction (left or right), look at the appropriate screen, and point to the picture while simultaneously saying the specific utterance for each trial.\nLook back at the infant and continue to alternate gaze between the picture and the infant's face until the trial is over.\nFor the language-only condition, go behind the curtain and comment on the pictures on the computer screens. Follow the specified utterances listed in Table 1 for each trial (Table 1; language-only). Use the same tone of voice as in the joint attention condition.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55596/55596fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Example of a Nonsocial Object.

In this paradigm, the EEG recording file is automatically saved when the program automatically closes at the end of the paradigm.\nEEG Data Processing15,16\nNotch filter the raw EEG data at 60 Hz and then apply a highpass filter of 0.1 Hz.\nSegment the raw data into shorter length epochs.\n\t\tNOTE: This paradigm segmented the data into 30 s epochs, as the goal was to assess infant EEG power during different states of engagement. If too much data loss is a concern, shorter epochs such as 1 - 3 s could be used.\nPerform artifact rejection on each epoch. Exclude electrodes from each epoch if the root mean square of the EEG voltage data exceeded 175 \u00b5V or if the amplifier is saturated at any time within the epoch. Reject epochs with >20 excluded electrodes from further analyses. Re-reference the EEG to the average reference of the remaining electrodes.\nUse a Fourier transformation to compute EEG power for each electrode in each epoch for the chosen frequency bands. Compute EEG power averages for regions of interest. Average good epochs to yield average power values for each condition, region, and frequency band. Log transform power values using the natural log.\n\t\tNOTE: For infants to have useable EEG data in a given condition, they must have at least one useable 30 s epoch of data in that condition. This protocol was developed using a high-density EEG system with liquid-saline based electrodes (see the Materials Table). Other EEG systems are appropriate, but specific steps may vary.\nCoding of Infant Looking Behavior16Use behavioral coding software with the ability to code videos frame-by-frame (every 30th of a second). Add codes to the video file of each infant to mark when each block starts (e.g., use the bell sound that indicates block transitions in the paradigm).\n\t\tNOTE: For the joint attention blocks, mark the beginning of each trial (use the trial onset sound that is in the paradigm) and the direction that the experimenter points (left or right; use the script which outlines which direction the experimenter points on each trial).\nCode where infants look during the social engagement and joint attention conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, in this study some of the codes (or events) included: \"infant looking at the left screen\", \"infant looking at the right screen\", \"infant looking at the experimenter\", \"infant looking at parent's face\", \"infant looking elsewhere\" (e.g., when infant is looking anywhere other than the screens, experimenter, or parent), and \"missing\" (when the infant was out of camera view). Train coders to a reliability threshold of 0.80 kappa and double code 20% of videos to assess inter-rater reliability. Use coding software to assess the extent to which the two coders code the same looking behaviors with the same durations. Use a tolerance window of one second so that onset or offset of looking behaviors within one second of each other will be scored as an agreement.\nQuantify infant looking behavior in the social engagement condition.\n\t\t\nOut of total time of the social engagement blocks, compute the percentage of time the infant looked at the experimenter (time looking at the experimenter/total time of the social engagement blocks x 100). This variable indexes the extent to which the infant attended to the experimenter, thus engaging in the social engagement condition as intended.Quantify infant looking behavior in the joint attention condition.\n\t\t\nAssess the percentage of time the infant followed the experimenter's point and gaze.\n\t\t\t\nSelect the time in seconds of the video when the experimenter pointed left. Within that time window, compute the time the infant looked at the left screen and the right screen. Next, select the time when the experimenter pointed right and compute the time the infant looked at the left screen and the right screen.\nSum the time the infant looked at the correct screen (i.e. the time when the experimenter pointed left and the infant looked at the left screen and the time when the experimenter pointed right and the infant looked at the right screen).\nSum the time the infant looked at the incorrect screen (i.e. the time when the experimenter pointed left and the infant looked at the right screen and the time when the experimenter pointed right and the infant looked at the left screen).\nCompute the percentage of time that the infant looked at the correct screen and the incorrect screen, out of the total looking time for the joint attention blocks. This variable indexes the extent to which the infant accurately followed the experimenter's bids for joint attention.\nCompute the percentage of time out of the joint attention blocks that the infant looked at the experimenter.\nSum the percentage of time the infant spent looking at the correct screen and the experimenter. This variable indexes the extent to which the infant engaged in joint attention.\nSubscription Required.

Animals\nObtain male Long-Evans rats (220 \u2013 240 g on arrival).\nMaintain rats in a temperature (21 \u00b0C) and humidity (44%) controlled animal care facility, on a 12 hr light-dark cycle with lights on at 7:00 am.\nPair-house rats upon arrival. After 3 days, house rats individually in plastic shoebox cages with beta-chip bedding, a nylon bone, and free access to standard rat chow and water. Use cage lids that have double grommets to allow for the subsequent placement of a second bottle, in addition to the water bottle. NOTE: Rats may be individually housed as soon as they arrive in the animal care facility.\nBegin to handle rats daily. NOTE: As a guide, one week of handling is usually sufficient to acclimate them to being picked up and handled by the experimenter.\n2. Intermittent Ethanol Access in the Home Cage\nNOTE: Conduct intermittent ethanol access in the home cage to ensure that rats will drink physiologically relevant quantities of ethanol before the behavioral training phase of the experiment begins 17-19. Initiate this procedure during the light phase, although it could be initiated at any time during the light or dark cycle.\nPrepare two bottles for each rat.\n\t\nUse a 100 ml plastic graduated cylinder as the ethanol bottle and a 473 ml standard plastic water bottle. Use a relatively small capacity ethanol bottle, filled almost to maximum volume capacity, to minimize loss of ethanol due to leakage and evaporation.\nFill one bottle with 15% ethanol, made by diluting 95% ethanol in tap water. NOTE: Other ethanol concentrations, such as 10% or 20%, may be used in place of 15% ethanol.Fill the second bottle with tap water.\nInsert a rubber stopper, with a sipper tube that contains a ball bearing to minimize leakage, into each bottle.\nSet up two control cages, treated identically to the home cages with the exception that the control cages do not contain rats or bedding.\n\t\nPrepare ethanol and water bottles for the control cages as specified in steps 2.1.1 \u2013 2.1.4.\nUse the measures obtained from the control cages to control for spillage and/or evaporation that may occur over the course of the ethanol access session (as described in steps 2.8.1 \u2013 2.8.2).\nWeigh all the ethanol and water bottles. Record all weights.\nWeigh all the rats. Record all weights.\nPlace the ethanol bottle and the water bottle on each home cage and control cage at the same time. Leave both bottles on the cages for 24 hr.\nAt the end of the 24 hr period, remove both bottles from the cages at the same time.\nWeigh all the ethanol and water bottles. Record all weights.\nTo determine how much ethanol and water was consumed during the 24 hr period, subtract the weight of each bottle when it was removed from the home cage from the weight of the bottle when it was placed on the home cage 24 hr earlier for each rat.\n\t\nDo the same for the two control cages, and then calculate the average amount of spillage for each fluid.\nSubtract the average amount of ethanol and water spillage, respectively, from the corresponding ethanol and water consumption measures for each rat.\nUse these spillage controlled difference measures to calculate ethanol consumption in g/kg, consumption of water, and ethanol preference.To calculate ethanol consumption (g/kg), first convert the weight (g) of ethanol solution consumed into volume (ml) based on the density of the total solution (ethanol + water components), according to the formula Volume (ml) = Weight (g)/Density (g/ml). NOTE: The density of the solution will vary as a function of ethanol concentration.\n\t\nNext, multiply the volume (ml) of ethanol solution consumed by the density (g/ml) of ethanol scaled for the specific percentage solution used, to yield the weight (g) of ethanol consumed.\nDivide the weight (g) of ethanol consumed by the rat weight (kg) to obtain the g/kg measure of ethanol consumption.\nTo calculate ethanol preference, express ethanol intake (ml) as a percentage of total fluid (ethanol + water, ml) intake.\nReturn the water bottle only back to the rat\u2019s home cage. For the next 24 hr, give the rats access to water but not ethanol. Instead of an ethanol bottle, place a pre-weighed second water bottle on the home cage.\nAt the end of the 24 hr period, remove both water bottles from the cage at the same time.\nWeigh both sets of water bottles. Record all weights.\nSubtract the weight of each bottle when it was removed from the home cage from the weight of the bottle when it was placed on the home cage 24 hr earlier, subtracting out the average spillage measure obtained from control cages as described in steps 2.8.1 \u2013 2.8.2.\nUse these spillage-controlled difference measures to calculate consumption of water.\nBegin the cycle again by providing both ethanol and water bottles to rats, as described in steps 2.1 through 2.14.\n\t\nRepeat this cycle for multiple (about 12) sessions to induce high and stable levels of ethanol consumption. See Figure 1 for representative results of ethanol consumption (g/kg) in the home cage.Alternate the spatial position of the ethanol and water bottle on the cage lid across sessions to prevent the development of a side preference.\nMake a fresh ethanol solution once per week to ensure accurate and stable ethanol concentration across sessions. Minimize the impact of evaporation of ethanol over prolonged periods of time using this approach.\n3. Apparatus\nHouse each conditioning chamber inside a ventilated, sound-attenuating cubicle.\nConstruct each\u00a0conditioning chamber of a stainless steel metal rod floor, a clear polycarbonate ceiling, clear polycarbonate back wall and front door, and aluminum metal panel sidewalls.\n\t\nInstall a fluid port centrally near the base of the right metal sidewall. Equip the entrance to the fluid port with an infrared photocell to detect entries into the port.\nConnect polyethylene tubing from the back of the fluid port to a 20 ml syringe containing ethanol using a blunt-tipped needle. Place the syringe into a syringe pump located outside the sound-attenuating cubicle. For Pavlovian discrimination training sessions, load ethanol into the syringe before placing it into the pump. Prime the tubing by manually advancing the pump, and then wipe away excess ethanol from the fluid port.\u00a0\nOn the left sidewall, install a white houselight centrally near the ceiling of the chamber.\nInstall a clicker (2 Hz cycle) and a white noise generator with speaker in the upper left corner of the left sidewall.\nOutfit each conditioning chamber with a specific configuration of visual, olfactory, and tactile stimuli to create a distinctive context.\n\t\nUse two different contexts, designated Context 1 and Context 2. Configure half of the conditioning chambers as Context 1 and the other half as Context 2.To create Context 1, place black cardboard panels over the ceiling and front and back walls of the chamber, spray lemon odor (10% v/v, made by diluting lemon oil in tap water) into a Petri dish and place it in the center of a metal waste tray under the floor of the chamber, and insert a clear polycarbonate floor panel over the metal rod floor. Line the waste tray with absorbent paper towel or bench liner.\nTo create Context 2, leave the ceiling and front and back walls of the chamber uncovered, so that they are clear, spray almond odor (10% v/v, made by diluting benzaldehyde in tap water) into a Petri dish and place it centrally in a metal waste tray under the floor of the chamber, and insert a perforated metal floor panel over the metal rod floor. Line the waste tray with absorbent paper towel or bench liner.\n4. Habituation\nHabituate rats to the behavioral training room and each of the two contexts within conditioning chambers. For this phase of the experiment, do not load ethanol into the 20 ml syringes.\nHabituate rats to the process of being transported from the animal care facility to the behavioral training room in the laboratory in two short habituation sessions.\n\t\nIn the first session, load the rats in their home cages onto a wheeled cart in the animal care facility, and transport them to the behavioral training room in the laboratory. Illuminate the room lights, turn on the fans in each sound attenuating cubicle, exit the room, close the door, and let the rats adjust to this new environment for 20 min, while remaining in their home cages on the cart. At the end of this 20 min period, return the rats to the animal care facility.In the second session, bring the rats to the behavioral training room in the laboratory. As before, leave the lights and cubicle fans on in the room. Remain in the room, with the door closed to minimize distractions, and handle and weigh each rat in the behavioral training room. Record the weights, and then return the rats to the animal care facility.\nHabituate rats to the conditioning chambers in two short habituation sessions.\n\t\nTransport the rats to the behavioral training room, record each rat\u2019s weight, and load each rat into its designated conditioning chamber.\nIn the first habituation session set up half the chambers as Context 1 and the remainder as Context 2.\nIn the second habituation session set up each chamber with the context that was not used in the previous session.\nConduct habituation sessions in a counterbalanced fashion, such that half of the rats are first exposed to Context 1, followed by Context 2, and the other half are first exposed to Context 2, followed by Context 1. Ideally, conduct both habituation sessions in the same day, although they could be spread across two days if necessary.\nFor habituation sessions, use a computer program to illuminate the houselight 1 min\u00a0after the program has been issued. Record the total number of fluid port entries made during a 20 min session. At the end of the session, program the houselight to turn off. Do not present any ethanol or cues during habituation sessions.\nRemove rats from the chambers, return them to their home cages, and transport them back to the animal care facility.\nClean the equipment (e.g., floor panels, waste trays, Petri dishes). See step 5.7 for further details.\n5. Pavlovian Discrimination Training (PDT)Train rats to behaviorally discriminate between one auditory cue that is paired with ethanol and a second auditory cue that is not. For this phase of the experiment, fill the 20 ml syringes with 15% ethanol.\nOutfit each conditioning chamber with a specific configuration of visual, olfactory, and tactile stimuli to create a distinctive context, as described in steps 3.3.2 and 3.3.3\n\t\nAssign half of the rats to Context 1 and the other half to Context 2 in a counterbalanced fashion, based on ethanol consumption and preference averaged across the last 2 sessions of the home cage ethanol access procedure. Refer to the context used during PDT as Context A. NOTE: Each rat should only experience one context in this phase of training.\nMake sure that the olfactory stimulus is the last contextual stimulus to be added to each conditioning chamber. Close the doors of the chamber and the sound-attenuating cubicle to contain the olfactory stimulus and minimize the comingling of different odors.\nBring the rats into the behavioral training room, record each rat\u2019s weight, and load each rat into its designated conditioning chamber.\nInitiate the computer program that controls the following sequence of events during each PDT session.\n\t\nAt 5 min after the program has been issued, illuminate the houselight.\nPresent the white noise stimulus and the clicker stimulus 16 times each. Designate one of these auditory stimuli to be the CS+ and the other to be the CS-, in a counterbalanced fashion across both contexts.\nMake each CS+ and CS- trial last 10 sec.\nDeliver 0.2 ml ethanol into the fluid port during the last 6 sec of the CS+. Do not deliver any ethanol during the CS-.Make each PDT session last 58 min on average. Present the CS+ and the CS- each on a variable time 67 sec schedule.\nRecord fluid port entries during the 10 sec CS interval (the 10 sec during CS presentation), the 10 sec pre-CS interval (the 10 sec immediately prior to CS onset), and the 10 sec post-CS interval (the 10 sec immediately following CS offset) for both CS+ and CS- presentations, as well as total fluid port entries for the entire session. Also record the duration of each port entry made during these intervals.\nAt the end of the session, turn the houselight off.\nRemove rats from the chambers, return them to their home cages, and transport them back to the animal care facility.\nCheck the fluid ports to ensure that rats consumed the 3.2 ml of ethanol delivered in each PDT session.\nFlush the ethanol out of the polyethylene tubing with a 60 ml syringe containing a small amount of water. Then, pass 60 ml of air through the tubing using a second, empty syringe, to make sure it is dry.\nClean the equipment. For daily cleaning, wash the floor panels, waste trays, and Petri dishes. Once a week, clean the entire conditioning chamber. Do not use scented cleaning products to avoid introducing unwanted odors into the experimental apparatus.\nContinue PDT sessions daily until rats show stable discrimination in their port entry responses to the CS+ vs. CS-. NOTE: Port entries made in response to the CS+ should increase over sessions, whereas port entries made in response to the CS- should remain low. The exact number of PDT sessions necessary to achieve discriminated conditioned responding can vary, but, as a guide, plan on approximately 20 sessions.\n6. ExtinctionOutfit each conditioning chamber with visual, olfactory, and tactile stimuli to create a context that is distinct from the one the rats experienced during PDT sessions. For example, if Context 1 was used in PDT, configure the chamber as Context 2 for extinction sessions. Refer to the context used during extinction as Context B.\nConduct extinction sessions identically to PDT sessions, but do not deliver any ethanol during the CS+.\n\t\nUse the same computer program that was used during PDT to present the CS+ and CS-.\nTo maintain consistency across phases of the experiment, load an empty syringe into the syringe pump, and leave the pump turned on. Make sure the polyethylene tubing does not contain ethanol before extinction sessions.\nContinue extinction sessions daily until rats no longer show discriminated responding between the CS+ and CS-. NOTE: Port entries made in response to the CS+ should gradually decline across extinction sessions, until there is no difference between port entries made in response to the CS+ and port entries made in response to the CS-. The exact number of extinction sessions necessary to extinguish conditioned responding can vary, but as a guide, plan on approximately 8 sessions.\nClean the equipment at the end of each session, as described in step 5.7.\n7. Context-induced Renewal Test\nEquip each conditioning chamber with the visual, olfactory, and tactile stimuli to create the context that was experienced during PDT sessions. For example, if a given rat experienced Context 1 in PDT sessions, configure his chamber as Context 1 in the test session. Refer to the context used during the renewal test as Context A.\nConduct the context-induced renewal test identically to PDT sessions, but do not deliver any ethanol during the renewal test. Present theCS+ and CS- as before during PDT sessions, but withhold the ethanol.\n\t\nUse the same computer program that was used during PDT to present the CS+ and CS-.\nTo maintain consistency across phases, load an empty syringe into the syringe pump, and leave the pump turned on. Make sure the polyethylene tubing does not contain ethanol before the test session.\nObserve context-induced renewal of Pavlovian-conditioned alcohol-seeking behavior. NOTE: This renewal effect will be evident by a selective increase in the number of port entries made in response to the CS+, with no change in port entry behavior made in response to the CS-, relative to CS+ and CS- responding observed at the end of extinction training.\nClean the equipment at the end of the session, as described in step 5.7.", "The most suitable target tissue for biolistic transformation of Arabidopsis is roots of young seedlings. This is because the root contains a meristematic cell layer, the pericycle, that remains diploid and does not undergo somatic endopolyploidization. By contrast, leaf cells of Arabidopsis exhibit a strong tendency to become polyploid (with the average ploidy level in fully expanded rosette leaves being 13C; Preuten et\u00a0al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0023]). While polyploidy does not pose an obstacle to successful transformation, it leads to problems with plant regeneration, and even if plants can be regenerated, they are usually infertile (Hibberd, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0014]; Sikdar et\u00a0al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0030]; Yu, Lutz, & Maliga, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0038]).For efficient plastid transformation in Arabidopsis, it is highly recommended that (1) an ecotype that displays good regeneration properties in tissue culture and (2) an ACC2-deficient genotype are used. ACC2 is a nuclear gene encoding an alternative acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) that can partially replace the plastid ACCase under conditions of inhibited plastid gene expression (Parker, Wang, & Meinke, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0020], 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0021]). Expression of ACC2 has been shown to be largely responsible for the low sensitivity of cultured Arabidopsis cells to the plastid translational inhibitor spectinomycin (Parker et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0020], 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0021]). Because the spectinomycin resistance gene aadA is the most efficient selectable marker gene for plastid transformation (Bock, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0005]; Svab & Maliga, 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0033]), the poor inhibition of cell division in the presence of spectinomycin greatly impairs the isolation of transplastomic Arabidopsis cells. This problem was solved by generating an ACC2 knockout line (\u0394acc2) by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in the easily regenerated Arabidopsis ecotype C24 (Ruf et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0026]). It is recommended that the \u0394acc2 C24 line be used as the recipient for plastid transformation. The protocol below describes the generation of tissue for biolistic plastid transformation by (1) raising Arabidopsis seedlings under aseptic conditions, (2) harvesting roots, and (3) inducing microcallus tissue from roots for biolistic transformation. If executed with the recommended amount of seeds, the protocol will provide material for up to 70 bombardments (i.e., shots with the biolistic gun), which are sufficient for one chloroplast transformation experiment and two control bombardments with a nuclear transformation vector.\nNOTE: All materials for plant tissue culture (TC) must be sterilized by autoclaving, heat sterilization, or surface sterilization.\nMaterials\nArabidopsis thaliana (At) seeds: cultivar C24, knockout mutant \u0394acc2\nUltrapure water, autoclaved\nEtOH + detergent solution: 25 ml ethanol (70%, v/v, tech. grade) plus 0.75 ml Tween 20 (10%, w/v)Hypochlorite + detergent solution: 40 ml NaOCl (13% active chlorine, store at 4\u00b0C) plus 1.2 ml Tween 20 (10%, w/v)\n6 plates (145 \u00d7 20 mm) with A. thaliana germination medium (AtGM; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-rec-0001] in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-tbl-0001])\n30 plates (100 \u00d7 20 mm) with A. thaliana callus induction medium (AtCIM; see recipe in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-tbl-0001])\nTable 1.\n                Tissue Culture Media Needed for Arabidopsis Plastid Transformation Experimentsa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-tbl1-note-0001_34]\ntable:\n\ufeffMedium,Composition,Spec concentration,Tissue culture vessel type and size (mm),Volume for given vessel,Protocol section\nAtGM,\"2.2 g/L MS salt and vitamin mix 10 g/L sucrose 0.5 g/L MES monohydrate, pH adjusted to 5.7 6.8 g/L micro agar\",0 mg/L 100 mg/L,\"Petri dish diameter: 1450/H 20 Petri dish diameter: 100/H 20, Square Petri dish 120 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 H 17\",125 ml 50 ml 100 ml,Sowing and stratification of seeds Seed assay\nAtCIM,\"3.1 g/L Gamborg B5 salts 0.104 g/L McCown woody plant vitamin mixture (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-rec-0003]) 22 g/L glucose monohydrate 0.5 g/L MES monohydrate 0.05 mg/L kinetin 0.5 mg/L 2,4-D 0.025 mg/L PSK-alpha, pH adjusted to 5.7 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-rec-0003]) 5.4 g/L Daishin agar\",0 mg/L,Petri dish diameter: 100/H 20,50 ml,Microcallus induction\nAtSIM,\"3.1 g/L Gamborg B5 salts 0.104 g/L McCown woody plant vitamin mixture (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-rec-0003]) 20.0 g/L sucrose 0.5 g/L MES monohydrate 0.15 mg/L IAA 2.0 mg/L 2-iP, pH adjusted to 5.7 5.4 g/L Daishin agar\",50 mg/L,Petri dish diameter: 100/H 20,50 ml,Regeneration of transplastomic lines and seed production\nAtRIM,\"4.4 g/L MS salt and vitamin mix 10 g/L sucrose 0.5 g/L MES monohydrate 1.0 mg/L IBA, pH adjusted to 5.7 6.5 g/L Daishin agar\",10 mg/L,Tissue culture flat tube Diameter: 30 \u00d7 H 105,10 ml,Root inductionAtPM,\"4.4 g/L MS salt and vitamin mix 10 g/L sucrose 0.5 g/L MES monohydrate, pH adjusted to 5.7 6.5 g/L Daishin agar\",10 mg/L,Magenta GA-7 vessel 77 \u00d7 77 \u00d7 97 Cylindrical jar Diameter: 100 \u00d7 H 200,50 ml 300 ml,Plant growth and seed production\naAtGM, A. thaliana germination medium; AtCIM, A. thaliana callus induction medium; AtSIM, A. thaliana shoot induction medium; AtRIM, A. thaliana root induction medium; AtPM, A. thaliana propagation medium; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; 2-iP, N6-(2-isopentenyl)adenine; IBA, indole-3-butyric acid.\nAutoclave, water cooled (i.e., Systec, V150)\nPrecision and analytical balances\nFilter unit for syringe, 0.2 \u00b5m (e.g., GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Whatman, FP30/0.2 CA-S)\nSyringe, 50 ml, one-way, sterile\n50-ml screw-cap tubes, self-standing centrifuge tube, polypropylene, 115 \u00d7 28 mm (e.g., Sarsteadt, 62.559.001)\nRack for reaction tubes\n5-ml pipet and suitable tips (e.g., Eppendorf)\n1,000, 200, 100, and 20-\u00b5l pipets and suitable tips\nCold room and/or fridge (4\u00b0C)\nSterile laminar flow hood (clean bench)\nTimer\nDisc rotary mixer (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific)\nPetri dishes, 145 \u00d7 20 mm, with vents (e.g., Greiner Bio-One, 639102)\nCling film (e.g., Saran wrap), 0.3 \u00d7 300 m, cut in 2.5-cm slices\nTweezers, pointed, length: 15 cm (e.g., Hammacher, HWC 130-15)\nPolyester net, 210 \u00b5m, cut in disks of 130 mm diameter (e.g., Hartenstein, PES1)\nTissue culture Petri dishes, 100 \u00d7 20 mm, with vents, nonpyrogenic, polystyrene (e.g., Corning, 430591 or 430167)\nPolyester net, 210 \u00b5m, cut in disks of 80 mm diameter (e.g., Hartenstein, PES1)\nMedical tape, narrow, 1.25 cm \u00d7 9.2 m (e.g., BSN medical 02453-00)\nDisposable scalpel, sterile, blade shape 21 (e.g., Swann-Morton)\nTissue culture incubators with temperature control and air circulation optimized for plant tissue culture (e.g., Percival Scientific)\nLight-tight cardboard box for dark incubation\nSeed sterilization1.

If you are not done after 3 min (i.e., 20 min after start of incubation), quickly add 2 volumes of sterile water to dilute the NaOCl (and prevent killing the seeds).\n10. Wash seeds with water by adding 30 ml sterile water. Mix by inverting. Wait a short time until the seeds sink to the bottom. Discard supernatant (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0002]).11. Repeat this washing step (step 10) at least six times, using 30 ml fresh sterile water each time. After the final step, washing water should be completely clear and odorless.\nSowing and stratification of seeds\n12. Prepare six germination plates (145 \u00d7 20 mm) by placing an autoclaved polyester net (diameter: 130 mm) on top of the medium AtGM (Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0002]). Avoid air bubbles between the netting and the medium.\n13. Mix seeds with 30 ml water by pipetting up and down before you plate the seeds (repeat for each plate).\n14. Pipet 5 ml (homogeneous) seed suspension onto the polyester net and spread seeds evenly with the pipet tip. Remove excess water (Fig. 2F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0002]).\n15.

Prepare five Petri plates with callus-inducing medium AtCIM per germination plate, by placing an autoclaved polyester net (diameter: 80 mm) onto the medium (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]). Avoid air bubbles between the medium and the net.\n20. Slowly lift (using tweezers) polyester net with the seedlings to remove roots from the medium (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]). Place net upside down into the lid of the Petri dish (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]).\n21. Check medium remaining in the Petri dish carefully for microbial contamination. If you identify any, discard this plate and seedlings.\n22. Carefully remove residual AtGM sticking to the roots with the blunt edge of a scalpel blade (Fig. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]).\nRoots should be free of agar medium for microcallus induction and biolistic transformation.\n23. Scrape off roots from the net with the scalpel blade. Hold the net with tweezers. Scrape from different directions across the net (Fig. 3F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]). Use a fresh set of tools for each germination plate to avoid carryover of (potentially overlooked) microbial contaminations.\n24. Collect roots in the lid of a sterile Petri dish (Fig. 3G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]). Use scalpel and tweezers for this step.25.

Divide into four to five aliquots (Fig. 3I[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]).\n27. Spread (with the scalpel) each aliquot of root material onto the net in the center of an AtCIM plate.\nThe root material should form a thin homogeneous layer in a circle of \u223c30 mm diameter (Fig. 3J[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003], K[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]).\n28.

Number individual plates, so that you know which root plate originates from which germination plate (e.g., \u201cRoot plate 1-1\u201d)\nMicrocallus induction\n30. Put AtCIM plates with the root material into a black cardboard box for dark incubation.\n31. Incubate plates for 5 days in darkness: 16 hr dark at 25\u00b0C/8 hr dark at 20\u00b0C before proceeding to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-prot-0002].\nThe hormones in the AtCIM will induce cell division and callus formation. Pay attention to the maximum time span of 5 days. Longer incubation times on callus induction\u00a0medium\u00a0(CIM) increase the risk of regenerating chimeric plants and greatly decrease the efficiency of shoot induction. Avoid accumulation of condensed water in the lid of the root plates.Particle gun-mediated transformation (also known as biolistic transformation) represents a nearly universally applicable method for the introduction of foreign DNA into cells and subcellular compartments (Altpeter et\u00a0al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0002]). It is also the method of choice for the transformation of the plastid genome (Bock, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0003], 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0005]; Maliga, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0017]). Although a few alternative methods for plastid transformation have been proposed, most of them have not been shown to produce stable transplastomic plants. The only exception is PEG-mediated transformation, which, however, is inefficient and available only in those (few) species in which plants can be efficiently regenerated from protoplasts. For plastid transformation of Arabidopsis, biolistic transformation is currently the only option.\nNOTE: General information: All materials that will be in contact with the plant tissue must be sterilized by autoclaving, heat sterilization, or surface sterilization.\nMaterials\nGold particles, 0.6 \u00b5m diameter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652262)\nEthanol p. a., 100%, water free\nUltrapure water, autoclaved\nChloroplast transformation vector: plasmid DNA, concentration 1.8-2.2 \u00b5g/\u00b5l purified by NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit for transfection-grade plasmid DNA (Macherey-Nagel, 740410.50)\nNuclear transformation vector for kanamycin selection (e.g., pGreen0029GFP) as control for transformation efficiency\nCaCl2, 2.5 M, cooled to \u221220\u00b0C\nSpermidine (free base), 100 mM stock solution (Duchefa, S 1369)\nEthanol p. a., for surface sterilization of the gun supplies\nHigh-quality 1.5-ml reaction tubes, to minimize gold particle adherence to the wall (e.g., Eppendorf, DNA LoBind, 0030 108.051)\nHigh-quality pipet tips, to minimize gold particle adherence\nTable-top centrifuge, e.g., Eppendorf MiniSpin Plus, with rotor F-45-12-11 (maximum centrifuging radius: 6 cm)\nTest tube shaker (e.g., vortex mixer)\nBox with crushed ice\nWaste containers (e.g., beakers) for discarded supernatants\nHelium-driven particle gun PDS-1000/He (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and vacuum pump\nMacrocarriers (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652335)\nRupture disks 1,800 psi (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652332)\nStopping screens (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652336)\nGlass Petri dishes, 140-150 mm, sterileMono adapter setup (standard part of PDS-1000/He)\nNOTE: Biolistic transformation is performed 5 days after microcallus induction. The typical chloroplast transformation experiment involves the bombardment of 20 to 30 root plates by 49 to 70 mono shots with a chloroplast transformation vector. It is recommended that two controls are always included: One root plate that remains unbombarded and will serve as a tissue culture and regeneration control (in the absence of antibiotic selection) and two plates that are transformed with a nuclear transformation vector. The root plates should be bombarded two to three times with the plasmid DNA-loaded gold particles.\nThe smallest possible unit of preparation of plasmid-coated gold particles is for 7 shots (prepared in one 1.5-ml tube). The values given below are calculated for 10 \u00d7 7 shots = 70 shots.\nSet up particle gun and prepare materials for particle coating\nNOTE: Surface sterilization of the disks (rupture disks and macrocarriers; step 3) should be done on a clean bench hosting the sterile particle gun.\n1. Fill ice boxes with crushed ice.\nThe particles and all solutions must be kept ice cold at all times.\n2. Put bottles with 100% EtOH, water, and ten sterile 1.5-ml tubes on ice.\n3. Work on a clean bench that harbors the particle gun.

Remove EtOH with a 200-\u00b5l pipet tip.\nDo not use a 1,000 \u00b5l tip, as this may cause excessive loss of gold particles. Hold the tube in the upper part to avoid warming of the particles at the bottom.\n10. Resuspend particles in 1,000 \u00b5l water. Pipet up and down while simultaneously scraping off particles that stick to the wall of the tube.\n11.

Centrifuge 1 s at 3,500 rpm (822 \u00d7 g) in a microcentrifuge and remove supernatant completely.\nDo not exceed this speed and time to avoid clumping of the particles.\n17. Add 600 \u00b5l of 100% EtOH and carefully resuspend particles by pipetting up and down.\n18. Centrifuge 1 s at 5,000 rpm (1,677 \u00d7 g) in a microcentrifuge and remove supernatant completely.\n19. Repeat this washing step.\n20. Resuspend particles very carefully in 50 \u00b5l 100% EtOH by pipetting up and down.\nThe DNA-coated gold particles should be used as quickly as possible and not stored on ice for extended periods of time (i.e., not more than 1 hr).\n21. Work on a clean bench with the particle gun: Carefully resuspend particles immediately before use. Drop 6.5 \u00b5l per shot onto the macrocarrier (Fig. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0004]).\nDropping helps with achieving equal spreading of the gold particles. For speedy processing of the coated particles, it is recommended that this step and the subsequent bombardments be performed with a team of two persons.\nBiolistic bombardment of microcalli\n22. Follow the instructions in the user manual of the PDS100/He (also see Fig. 4E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0004]-H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0004]) and use the following settings for shooting:\n         \nHelium pressure at the tank regulator: 2,000-2,050 psi;\nRupture disks: 1,800 psi;\nMacrocarrier (flying disk) assembly: level one from the top;Petri dish holder: level two from the bottom (equivalent to a distance from the macrocarrier assembly of \u223c9 cm);\nVacuum (at the time of the shot): 27-28 in. Hg.This protocol describes the procedures involved in the selection of primary transplastomic lines, their regeneration into shoots, and the growth of transplastomic plants to maturity for seed production. Rooting of in vitro regenerated Arabidopsis plants is inefficient (Weigel & Glazebrook, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0037]) and it is therefore recommended that the T0 generation be kept under sterile culture until seeds have been obtained.

Transfer polyester net with the bombarded microcalli to AtSIM with 50 mg/L spectinomycin.\nThis is done best with the help of one or two pairs of tweezers.\n2. Seal plates with medical tape.\n3. Incubate under a diurnal cycle of 16 hr light at 25\u00b0C/8 hr dark at 20\u00b0C with a light intensity of 4-5 \u00b5mol of photons m-2 s-1.\n4. Change medium every 14 days by placing the polyester net with the calli onto fresh medium (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]). Seal plates with medical tape.\nThe yellowish calli will grow and expand in size. As the calli become larger, take great care to ensure good medium contact. To this end, gently press the calli with tweezers on the net. The calli can remain on the net as long as there is good contact to the polyester netting and the medium.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/633c2ded-a463-4c54-bc83-49b3b30b019a/cpz1103-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nSelection and regeneration of transplastomic lines.

The photograph was taken 75 days after root harvest. (B) Callus pieces arranged on a fresh plate with selective medium. (C) Propagation of green spectinomycin-resistant callus tissue. (D) Resistant shoots regenerating from callus tissue.\n5. When calli start to overgrow each other (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]), separate them from each other and place callus pieces of \u223c5-8 mm diameter directly (without polyester netting) onto fresh AtSIM spec50 plates (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]).As a rough estimate, one plate with calli on netting will give three plates with separated callus pieces. Distribute the callus pieces evenly on the plate, placing \u223c63 callus pieces on each plate (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]). Note that the callus pieces will continue to grow, likely necessitating multiple rounds of breaking and redistribution. Generate the pieces by gently breaking the callus with two pairs of fine-tipped tweezers.\nIn a successful experiment, green spectinomycin-resistant calli will start to appear after \u223c7-52 weeks.\n6. When green resistant callus appears, wait until it is \u223c2 mm in size. Then separate green callus from the yellow-beige callus material and transfer green callus to a fresh AtSIM spec50 plate. When green calli exceed a diameter of \u223c5 mm, break them into smaller pieces with two pairs of fine-tipped tweezers.\nCollect green calli from other (independent) events and place them on the same plate (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]). This is important, because an array of calli will grow much better than a single callus on a plate. Keep track of the origin of the calli by appropriately labeling callus pieces representing independent events versus those coming from the same primary resistant callus.\nShoot induction from the green callus material can take quite a while. Shoots can develop from green callus or directly from the root-attached callus. The size of the shoots can vary greatly. Wait until the developing shoots reach a reasonable size (Fig. 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]) before separating them from the callus. Premature separation bears the risk of destroying the shoot or damaging the apical meristem. When all structures of a shoot (leaves, stem, and growing tip) become clearly visible, it can be transferred (see step 7).Keep propagating the remaining green callus from which the shoot was excised to produce additional shoots, thus increasing the chance of successful rooting and seed production (see below).\n7. Remove shoots from callus by breaking them off with two fine-tipped pairs of tweezers. Place them onto a fresh plate with AtSIM spec50. Culture multiple shoots in a single plate to stimulate growth (see comment under step 6).\n8. Incubate under a diurnal cycle of 16 hr light at 25\u00b0C/8 hr dark at 20\u00b0C, with a light intensity of 4-5 \u00b5mol of photons m-2 s-1.\n9. Change medium every 14 days by transferring green calli and shoots to plates with fresh medium. Seal plates with medical tape.\n10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 until seeds have been obtained from the transplastomic line and the seeds germinate on medium with spectinomycin (see below).\n11. Start taking shoots for root induction when they have a height of \u223c8 mm (or when you have multiple smaller shoots from the same transplastomic line and can sacrifice a few shoots without risk of losing the line).\nOn average, one third of the green antibiotic-resistant calli will differentiate into shoots.\nRoot induction\n12. Remove shoots regenerating from the calli by gently breaking apart the callus tissue with two fine-tipped pairs of tweezers. The extracted shoots must not have any residual callus material at the base of the shoot.\nResidual callus tissue would inhibit root induction and root growth.\n13. Transfer shoots to TC flat tubes with AtRIM spec10. Stick two to four shoots per tube into the agar slant (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006], B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]). Place tubes upright in a tube rack.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/27da4fe2-1cd0-4159-8a1f-8a442c8f127a/cpz1103-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6Growth of transplastomic plants. (A) Transplastomic shoots transferred to a tissue culture (TC) flat tube (front view). (B) Shoots growing in a TC flat tube (side view). (C) Flowering plants in a Magenta GA-7 box. (D) Flowering plants in a jar.\n14. Incubate for 2 weeks under a diurnal cycle of 12 hr light at 20\u00b0C and 12 hr dark at 18\u00b0C with a light intensity of 50-70 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1.\n15. Transfer shoots, independent of them having formed roots or not, to Magenta boxes with AtPM spec10. Stick three to four shoots per box into the medium (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]).\n16. Close Magenta box with a punched filter paper (with a hole of 10 mm diameter). Cover hole with medical tape and fix filter paper with medical tape to the wall of the Magenta box (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]).\nClosing the Magenta box with its lid should be avoided at this stage to lower the humidity. The hole in the filter paper cover allows for convenient watering of the plants later on.\nInduction of rooting is not trivial. Typically, only half of the shoots can be successfully rooted. However, on the AtPM spec10 culture medium, even rootless shoots can develop flowers and produce seeds, albeit with reduced efficiency. Extending the incubation time of 2 weeks on the agar slants is not recommended, as this may inhibit root outgrowth.\nPlant growth and seed production\n17. Incubate plants in Magenta boxes (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]) for 1-2 weeks under a diurnal cycle of 16 hr light at 22\u00b0C and 8 hr dark at 22\u00b0C with a light intensity of 35-65 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. Water plants every day or every other day (depending on the humidity in your growth facility) with 3-5 ml sterile water.18. Transfer shoots to jars with AtPM spec10 (Fig. 6D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]). Grow three to four plants in each jar.\n19. Close jar with a layer of filter paper with a punched hole. Cover hole and fix filter paper to the jar with medical tape.\n20. Water plants twice a week with 10-20 ml sterile water.\n21. When the plants flower, support self-pollination by daily tapping with your fingers on the wall of the jar until you see the flowers shaking.\n22. When the siliques are ripe, harvest seeds and collect them in a sterile tube.\nSeed assay as test for homoplasmy and maternal inheritanceSuccessful transformation of the chloroplast genome and integration of the transgenes by homologous recombination should be confirmed by Southern blot analysis (e.g., Ruf et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0026]; Ruf, Hermann, Berger, Carrer, & Bock, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0027]; Tabatabaei, Ruf, & Bock, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0034]) using labeled probes flanking the transgene insertion site in the plastid genome. For several reasons (including the possibility of vector integration into the nuclear genome and the presence of promiscuous plastid DNA in the nuclear genome; Hager, Biehler, Illerhaus, Ruf, & Bock, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0012]; Koop et\u00a0al., 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0015]; Ruf, Biehler, & Bock, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0025]), PCR is not suitable for this purpose. Southern blot analysis is also essential to assess whether or not all wild-type copies of the highly polyploidy plastid genome (Golczyk et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0010]; Greiner et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0011]) have been successfully eliminated by spectinomycin selection, a status referred to as \u201chomoplasmic transplastomic.\u201d Homoplasmy is essential for the genetic stability of the transplastomic lines, as heteroplasmic lines can lose the transgene through (random) segregation of plastid genomes in the absence of selection (Drescher, Ruf, Calsa, Carrer, & Bock, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0008]). Independent confirmation of plastid transformation and homoplasmy should be provided by seed assays in which the uniparentally maternal inheritance of the (chloroplast encoded) spectinomycin resistance and the lack of segregation (i.e., absence of antibiotic-sensitive seedlings from the progeny) are demonstrated (Bock, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0003]; Ruf, Karcher, & Bock, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0028]).\n23. Incubate seeds harvested from the T0 generation plants (representing the T1 generation) for 3 hr in sterile water.\nBecause the seeds were obtained from plants growing under aseptic conditions and harvested under sterile conditions, no surface sterilization is necessary. As a negative control, include the untransformed \u0394acc2 recipient line.24. Place seeds on AtGM spec100 in a Petri dish (round Petri dishes 100 \u00d7 20 mm or squared Petri dishes 120 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 17 mm; Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0007]). To be able to pick individual seeds, pour seed suspension onto a sterile filter paper in a Petri dish. Individual seeds can then be conveniently picked with a sterile toothpick and placed onto germination medium (evenly spaced, to avoid cross-protection from the antibiotic; Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0007]). Seal plate with cling film.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e1957f02-409b-461a-8364-631c384a383f/cpz1103-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nSeed assay on a square plate (120 \u00d7 120 mm). Seeds were germinated in the presence of spectinomycin. Half of the plate contains T1 seedlings from a transplastomic line (green), the other half contains seedlings of the \u0394aac2 control line that are spectinomycin sensitive and therefore bleach out. The photograph was taken 20 days after sowing.\n25. Incubate plates for 2 days in the dark at 4\u00b0C.\nThis stratification step is necessary to achieve uniform germination.\n26. Transfer plates to an incubator with 12 hr light at 20\u00b0C and 12 hr dark at 18\u00b0C, light intensity 70-80 \u00b5mol of photons m-2 s-1.\nThe seeds should germinate after \u223c1 week, and after 2-3 weeks, their resistance phenotype can be evaluated and documented (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0007]). The progeny of homoplasmic transplastomic T0 plants will display a uniform spectinomycin-resistant phenotype (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0007]). The transplastomic T1 seedlings can then be transferred to soil and grown to maturity under standard greenhouse conditions for further seed production. These plants should also be used to perform reciprocal crosses with the wild type to ultimately confirm maternal inheritance and lack of pollen transmission of the transgenic chloroplast genomes (see Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003] in Ruf et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0026]).", "All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the standards stated in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Here, the assessment of mechanical hypersensitivity using the OPAD is described using a rat model of neuropathic orofacial pain. A schematic of the timeline used in the study is shown in Figure 1. All behavioral assessments were performed by female experimenters.\n1. Animals\nHouse female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8/group, 150-200 g) in pairs in a temperature-controlled room (22 \u00b0C \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) with a 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle. Provide food and water ad libitum. Keep the rats in the facility for 5 days for acclimation before the experiments.\nPerform the operant pain assays on the same day of the week and time (9 a.m.-11 a.m.).\nAt the end of the experiments, euthanize the rats by decapitation following isoflurane anesthesia.\n2. Setting up the OPAD\nPlace milk-drip trays, Plexiglas cages, and metal flooring grates on the OPAD. Attach wiring to the cages. Slip the bottle holder onto the metal pole at the back of the device.\nPrepare a 2:1 ratio of water to sweetened condensed milk as the reward solution by opening a can of sweetened condensed milk and pouring it into a 1 L beaker. Add ~600 mL of tap water to 300 mL of milk. Initially stir the solution using a spoon, and then use a stir bar and the hot-plate stirrer. Then, fill the reward bottles with the milk solution and keep the stock milk solution at 4 \u00b0C.NOTE: Cover the stock milk solution with plastic food wrap. Warm the milk solution before each use. Stock milk solution in the fridge can coagulate after a week. When it coagulates, it might occlude the lick tube. Therefore, discard it and prepare a new stock solution.\nPlace the reward milk bottles on the bottle holder and adjust them so the spout can be reached by the animal. Tighten the left-side knob of the holder to secure the bottle in place.\nTurn on the cages using the switch on the front panel.\n3.

Training and baseline testing sessionsNOTE: Bring rats to the room at least 15 min before the test if the behavioral testing room is at the same animal housing facility. If they are transported to a testing room outside the animal facility, give the rats 1 h to acclimatize to the room.\nBefore baseline recordings, train the rats in the OPADs for 2 weeks (5 days/week, 10 min/day) to press their faces against the metal spiked bars to receive the milk solution.\n\tNOTE: A representative image of spiked bars and a rat performing the assay is shown in Figure 2.\nSet up the OPAD equipment.\nTurn on the cages using the switch on the front panel. Look for the green light on the cage, which means that the cage is ready to test.\nDouble-click the saved experiment file to open. Type the password. Click Log me on or hit Enter.\nWait for the Tests menu to show up. On the left side of the screen, make a note of the number of animals and the corresponding cage (e.g., Animal 1 will be tested in cage 1), the stage that will be run on that day, and the testing status (\"ready\"). On the right side of the screen, observe the chart of each animal that shows the numbers of licks and contacts.\nObserve the screen of the cages that displays the ID of the animal to be tested. Place each rat into the corresponding cage and press the button on the cage twice. Note that the green light will turn into an orange light once testing starts, and a warning sound will be heard when the testing session is over.\nFor the first 2 days of training, place milk bottles completely into the cage to allow the rats to drink milk without contacting the stimulus.On days 3-8 of training, once the animals start drinking, move the bottles progressively backward to encourage the rats to press their faces against the spiked bars.\nOn days 9-10 of training, once the animals fully press against the spiked bars and the licking numbers are consistent (a minimum of 500 licks during the 10 min testing sessions), note the location of the milk bottle for each animal and use this distance for baseline recordings.\nFollowing 2 weeks of training, collect data from the noted milk bottle distance for 5 days as the baseline (10 min/day).\n5. Induction of orofacial neuropathic pain and evaluation of mechanical hypersensitivity\nNOTE: Following baseline measurements, rats underwent CCI-ION surgery, which involved bilateral ligation of the ION, as previously described20. Control rats had sham surgery. No pre- or post-operative analgesia was used in the procedure as it can change the time course of the neuropathy. CAUTION: Waste isoflurane must be scavenged through charcoal canisters. Scalpel blades and needles must be disposed of in biohazard waste.\nAnesthetize the rat in the induction chamber with a mixture of O2 (1 L/min) and 4% isoflurane and maintain the anesthetic state with a specialized nose cone for the duration of the surgery.\nPlace the anesthetized rat on a surgical workbench and restrain it. Maintain the body temperature at 37 \u00b0C using a heating pad. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent them from drying out. Check the anesthetic depth by pinching the toe and start the procedure when the toe withdrawal reflex is no longer observed.\nPerform the surgical procedure under a stereo microscope. Open the mouth using retractors and retract the lip using a small clip.Make a small incision between the dorsal gum and lip using a scalpel blade (#15). Gently cut away soft tissue using the tip of the scalpel blade to reveal a branch of the ION.\nPlace two chromic gut (#5-0) ligatures around the ION using a blunt, bent syringe needle.\nClose the wound using tissue adhesive.\nFor the sham surgery, expose the ION using the same procedure but do not ligate the nerve.\nAfter surgery, provide milk-softened rodent chow for 2 days to encourage eating and prevent dehydration.\nTest the rats in the OPAD the day after surgery for 3 consecutive days and then 3 days/week (e.g., every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) for the following weeks until the lick numbers reach their baseline values.\n\t\u200bNOTE: The duration of the CCI-ION-induced mechanical sensitivity can depend on the sex, the strain of the rodent used, and the experimenter's performance. Thus, it might not be accurate to indicate a certain duration to test animals. Hence, testing until lick numbers reach baseline values is more accurate.\n6. Cleaning up the device\nWhen testing is finished, quit the software by clicking the x icon at the top-right corner and wait for the data to be saved automatically.\nTurn off the cages using the switch on the front panel.\nUnplug the wires from the metal flooring grates. Remove and wash the milk-drip trays, Plexiglas cages, metal flooring grates, and bottle holders with dish soap. Put everything on the drying rack.\nWipe the metal spiked bars, testing device, and lab benches using 70% isopropyl alcohol.\n\t\u200bNOTE: The instruments need to be handled with care. Use soft brushes while cleaning the milk bottles and licking tubes. Dirty equipment can lead to bacteria buildup.\n7.

If there is no need to change the program code, this step can be omitted.Note: For the sleep deprivation conducted by mechanical oscillation, to avoid mechanical damage as much as possible, the key principle is to use the smallest intensity and frequency of oscillations to achieve the maximum degree of sleep deprivation. In Drosophila, quiescence for 5\u00a0min or longer is proved and defined as a sleep episode (Shaw et\u00a0al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Hendricks et\u00a0al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Nitz et\u00a0al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Therefore, the interval between two shocks should be close to or less than 5\u00a0min to ensure that the sleep behavior is effectively disturbed. We utilize the single-chip control board to implement a pseudo-random process: after triggering signal input, it randomly selects a time point in a 170-s interval and activates the electromagnetic relay which is embedded on the board for 10 s, and then switches it off. This process allows the oscillator to randomly select a time point in each 3-minute interval to oscillate once (we name this interval as a random event interval). Therefore, the maximum interval between oscillation events is 6\u00a0min. This pseudo-random process could be easily adjusted by changing the parameters of the program code according to the annotations we provide. As far as we tested, it seems unnecessary to shorten this random event interval, because the deprivation efficiency of the 3-minute interval is sufficient. If this random event interval is extended, the deprivation efficiency will be reduced accordingly.\nDownload the program code (HEX file) into the single-chip control board.

The three single relay boards are named Relay 1, Relay 2, and Relay 3 respectively. The modular design is applied in this system to simplify the operation of the program, debugging, and maintenance. Each part of the joint control module realizes a single function which easy to adjust according to certain users. Relay 1 periodically sends out high-level signals to the single-chip board and therefore controls the cycle length of the whole system. The cycle length could be adjusted by changing the parameters of Relay 1.\nThe single-chip board is responsible for generating stochastic signals. When the signal is triggered, the single-chip microcomputer selects a time point randomly to send a high-level signal within a given time period. The given time period could be adjusted by changing the program code with the help of the annotations we provide.Relay 2 receives the high-level signal from the single-chip board and starts the oscillation immediately by connecting the control line1 and line 2 once.\nRelay 3 receives the high-level signal from the single-chip board at the same time as Relay 2. The oscillation continues until the Relay 3 timer expires and connects the control line1 and line 2 again. Therefore, Eelay 3 controls the duration of continuous oscillation and it could be adjusted by changing the parameters of Relay 1.\nThe link of the product: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074TBRRTY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A25LEPIYFTQZF2&psc=1[href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074TBRRTY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A25LEPIYFTQZF2&psc=1]\nhttps://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/DC-6V-30V-Trigger-Delay-On_60784456751.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normal_offer.d_title.3b3d1f0fXXgVMl[href=https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/DC-6V-30V-Trigger-Delay-On_60784456751.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normal_offer.d_title.3b3d1f0fXXgVMl]\nSee Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].

Boil and wash the glass tube in ddH2O to reduce the adhesion of contaminants. Finally, atmospheric pressure is utilized to fill the food into the glass tube\nPlace the glass tubes in a beaker and boil for 5\u201310\u00a0min in ddH2O. Clean the glass tube once with ddH2O.\nBundle the clean glass tubes with rubber bands, rinse the inside of the glass tubes with ddH2O for 4\u00a0min, and dry it in an oven.\nUse ddH2O to prepare 150mL food solution with a final concentration of 5% sucrose and 1.5% agar as mentioned above.Pour the prepared food solution into a clean petri dish with 10\u00a0cm in diameter and 1.5\u00a0cm in depth.

The Zeitgeber time (ZT) was defined as ZT0 with lights on and ZT12 with lights off, so the flies are under a cycle of 12\u00a0h of light/12\u00a0h of darkness. The whole night deprivation is performed. Firstly, record the baseline of sleep behavior without oscillation. Then perform the sleep deprivation at ZT12 on the second day. Next, conduct the third day record of sleep behavior without oscillation to evaluate the sleep rebound.\nNote: There are multiple ways to analyze the data generated by sleep deprivation experiments. In some researches, the sleep rebound was calculated as the difference in sleep between the day after sleep deprivation and the day before the deprivation at each ZT time(Toda et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) or each half hour (Sitaraman et\u00a0al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). In some other researches, the Individual sleep rebound is quantified every hour for 24\u00a0h by dividing the cumulative amount of regained sleep by the total amount of sleep lost during deprivation (Tong et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Jin et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Here, the latter method was used to present the results of the sleep deprivation experiment.", "The animal studies were approved by and met the guidelines of both the Animal Care and Use Committee of Ibaraki University and the Ministry of Education Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan (Notification No.71).

In addition, obtain paper towels, a mask, and latex gloves.\nFor the social interaction test, prepare an open-field arena (W \u00d7 D \u00d7 H = 40 cm \u00d7 40 cm \u00d7 40 cm) made of gray polyvinylchloride, a weight made of steel (190 g), and a plastic interaction box (W \u00d7 D \u00d7 H = 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 13 cm; 100 g) with three wire-mesh windows (W \u00d7 D = 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm) (Figure 3).\nPlace a CCD camera (2.8\u201312 mm; F = 1:1.4; 1/3 inch CCD) and an automated tracking system in the behavioral testing room in the animal facility. Place an appropriate shelf for the mouse cages in the behavioral testing room to habituate the mice to the environment of the testing room for at least 30 min.\n2. Habituation to the EnvironmentUse male C57BL/6JJmsSlc (B6) mice that are 7 weeks old and male Slc:ICR (ICR) mice that are over 5 months old and deliver to the facility from an animal breeding company.\nIndependently move two groups of B6 mice (n = 12 in each group) to the facility; use one group (screener B6 mice) for screening aggressive ICR mice and another group (subject B6 mice) for developing the sCSDS model.\nIntroduce ICR mice (n = 12) to the facility in order to screen their aggressive behaviors.\nHouse the mice individually in single cages for 1 week under a 12-hr light-dark cycle (around 100 lux fluorescent light, lights on at 08:00) with constant temperature (around 23 \u00b0C) and humidity levels (around 40%) in order to habituate them to the environment. Partition each cage by placing white-colored plastic boards between the cages so that the mice are not affected by the behaviors of neighboring mice.\nMake purified-diet food pellets and reverse osmosis water available ad libitum. Use AIN-93G chow because the ingredients of other non-purified diet pellets may vary.\nMeasure body weight, food intake (FI), and water intake (WI) of the mice every day. Calculate the body weight gain (BWG) from the initial day.\n3. Screening of Aggressive ICR Mice\nAfter habituation for 1 week as mentioned above, screen the ICR mice (resident) using resident-intruder tests for a 3 min trial with screener B6 mice (intruder; 8 weeks of age) in the afternoon (14:00-17:00) under lighting of around 300 lux in the housing room.Specifically, test each ICR mouse for three trials per day for 5 consecutive days (15 trials in total) toward many different B6 mice as possible to find which ICR mice show high aggression toward the intruders. During the tests, record the attack latency and duration of the aggressive behavior (rapid motions with attack biting).\nIdentify hyper-aggressive ICR mice by checking the damage wounds on B6 intruder mice after each trial.\nCalculate the ratio of trials in which the attack latency is less than 30 sec as a first index of the aggression score.\nCalculate the ratio of trials in which the attack latency is less than 3 min as a second index of the aggression score.\nEvaluate the aggression scores from the first index. Use the second index when the first index is equal.\nSelect the ICR mice that had high aggression scores without hyper-aggressive behaviors as aggressive ICR mice. Use the aggressive ICR mice repeatedly throughout the next set of experiments until approximately 12 months of age; however, perform the screening process for aggressive ICR mice as described above before every experiment to confirm the aggressiveness of ICR mice.\nAfter each session of the screening, record the degree of injury of the screener B6 mice. \u00a0If a mouse is wounded,\u00a0isolate the mouse in a single cage and observe the progress by checking its body weight gain, food intake, and water intake.\u00a0In the case of severe wounds which affect physiology and behavior in mice, \u00a0euthanize them according to local IACUC guidelines.\n4. sCSDS\nIntroduce subject B6 mice 7 days before (day -6) the day of the initial stress exposure (day 1) and house the mice individually in single cages to habituate them to the environment.Three days before day 1 (on day -2), move the aggressive ICR mice into a compartment of each SD cage, which is divided by an acrylic divider to let the mice establish their territories in the SD cages (the same number of subject B6 mice).\nDivide the SD cages by using white-colored partitioning boards, as in the single-cage condition described above.\nFor non-stressed control B6 mice, prepare SD cages (half the number of mice) to keep the mice in pairs; place two mice into each compartment divided by the divider in an SD cage for 10 days.\nAfter the daily BWG, FI, and WI measurements on day 1, place subject B6 mice into one of the compartments of the SD cages (resident\u2019s home-cage) in the afternoon (14:00\u201316:00) under lighting of around 300 lux in the housing room and measure the physical contact time from the first attack bite to complete the resident-intruder test.\nOn day 1, set the physical contact time to 5 min from the first attack bite and have observers count the number of attack bites by ICR mice that are directed preferentially at the back or flanks of the opponent as described by Miczek et al.20 to determine the degree of physical stress to B6 mice.\nAfter the physical contact time, rescue subject B6 mice, and check and record their fur status and wounds. Then, place the B6 mice into another compartment next to the ICR mice in the SD cages until exposure to physical stress the next day.\nBecause the acrylic divider in the SD cage is transparent and contains holes, expose subject B6 mice to various emotional stresses, including visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli, from the ICR mice in the neighboring compartment of the SD cage for 24 hr every day.Measure the BWG, FI, and WI of control B6 mice daily and then place them into each compartment in the SD cages for 1 day.\nOn day 2, after the daily measurements of BWG, FI, and WI, introduce subject B6 mice into the territories of other ICR mice to expose them to physical stress.\nSet the duration of physical contact at 4.5 min from the first attack bite on day 2, and count the number of attack bites.\nMove control B6 mice into different compartments and change the pair combinations in order to shuffle the placement and partner of the pairs every day.\nDecrease the duration of physical contact by 0.5 min per day, so that the duration on day 10 is set to 0.5 min from the first attack bite.\nOn day 7, replace approximately half of the wood shavings in all of the compartments in the SD cages.\nAfter exposure to the last physical stress on day 10, move subject B6 mice into single cages. Similar to the subject B6 mice, move control B6 mice into single cages on day 10.\nIf an ICR mouse does not show any attack bites until 5 min in each trial on days 1 to 10, terminate the trial. Replace the ICR mouse with spare aggressive ICR mice and conduct an alternative trial for the subject B6 mouse.\nIf a mouse is wounded, isolate the mouse in a single cage and observe the progress by checking its body weight gain, food intake, and water intake. Follow your IACUC guidelines for analgesia.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of severe wounds which affect physiology and behavior in mice, euthanize them according to local IACUC guidelines.\n5. Social Avoidance Test (Social Interaction Test)\nPerform behavioral tests for social avoidance in the morning (09:00\u201312:00) on day 11.Thirty minutes before the test, transfer the cages of control and subject B6 mice onto a shelf (dim light of less than 1 lux) in the behavioral testing room under lighting of less than 20 lux to allow them to habituate to the environment.\nTo reduce order-effects, alternately test control and subject B6 mice.\nClean an open-field arena (illuminated with a light of 20 lux at the center of the field) and a plastic interaction box using paper towels soaked with 70% ethanol before the behavioral test for each mouse to remove feces, urine, and any odors.\nPlace an unfamiliar ICR mouse (not used as an aggressor) from a single cage near the open-field apparatus.\nPlace a B6 mouse into the open field of the vacant interaction box as shown in Figure 4. Monitor and analyze its behavior for 2.5 min using the automatic analysis system (described in step 5.10).\nAfter the first trial, remove the B6 mouse from the field and place it into its home cage.\nFollowing this, place the unfamiliar male ICR mouse (social target) into the interaction box and then introduce the B6 mouse into the open field and monitor its behavior for 2.5 min.\nAfter the second trial, return both the B6 and ICR mice to their home cages, and clean the field and the interaction box as mentioned above.\nRepeat these steps for each B6 mouse to test its social behavior. During each trial, record top-view movies using a CCD camera.\n\t\nAfter the behavioral tests, calculate the time spent in the interaction zone (in seconds) and in the corner zone (in seconds) for each trial as shown in Goto et al.13. Judge the position of the mouse based on the center of the mouse.Calculate the social interaction scores as 100 \u00d7 (interaction time, with target)/(interaction time, without target), following the methods published in Krishnan et al.21.\nSubscription Required.

Participant recruitment\nRecruit participants from among a group of adults within two environments (students and teachers), with an age rank of 18 to 69 year-old in the environment of Higher Education (formal and non-formal education).\nInclude participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing.\nExclude participants with neurological, psychiatric, and sleep disorders, disabilities related to educational special needs, perceptual difficulties (impaired sight and hearing), and cognitive disabilities.\n\t\u200bNOTE: In this study we worked with a sample of 40 participants, 6 students from the University of Experience (one participant was excluded in the category of students from the university of experience because of visual difficulties), 25 university professors in the disciplines of health sciences, engineering, and history and heritage, and 9 undergraduate and master's students following courses in health sciences, engineering, and history and heritage. The participants had no cognitive, hearing, nor visual problems, and they all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision (Table 2). That is why, one of the participants was eliminated before starting the experiment because nystagmus had been detected on him and therefore the task was applied to a sample of 39 participants. The participants received no financial nor professional compensation; that is why participants' motivation was high as it was only based on their interest to know how this eye-tracking method works during a learning process related with cultural heritage, specifically the origin of European monasteries.\nTable 2. Characteristics of the sample.\u00a0Please click here to download this Table.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62103/Copia de JoVE_Table_2.xls]2.

Before the test, inform each participant of the aims of the study and the collection, treatment, and storage of their data. The agreement of each participant is given by signing the informed consent form.\n\t\tNOTE: Participation in this study was voluntary and there was no financial reward. This aspect ensured that the completion of the tasks had no economic motivation. Before starting the task, the interviewer, an expert in the field, fills up a questionnaire with questions on age, gender, occupation, and prior knowledge of the subject matter, in this case, the origin and historical development of monasteries in Europe (see Table 3). This study is part of a European Project (2019-1-ES01-KA204-095615-Coordinator 6) on adult learning about the Cultural Heritage of Humanity throughout life; that is why this type of task was chosen.

Eye tracking is a technology that allows you to follow your gaze while you perform the activity and it has no side effects, nor it is invasive, since in this study only eye tracking is recorded\".Explain to the participant that a valid test requires proper positioning. Have the participant must sit at a certain distance [45 to 60 cm] from the monitor. The distance will depend on the height of the participant, the lower the height, the shorter the distance.\nInform the participant that a series of points will appear on the cardinal points of the screen and that as each point appears the participant must observe it with the eyes. The participant can move from one point to another by using the \"enter\" cursor. The calibration phase has a duration of 10-15 minutes.\n\t\tNOTE: An Eye-tracking iViewer XTM, SMI Experimenter Center 3.0, and SMI Be Gaze and a monitor with a resolution of 1680\u00d71050 were used for the task-resolution exercise. This equipment registers ocular movements, their coordinates, and pupillary diameters of each eye. In this study, 60 Hz were applied, scan-path metrics and dynamic scan-path metrics were used, and AOI statistics were determined.\nCheck the calibration setting. The professional supervising the test analyzes the calibration setting on the control screen.\n\t\t\nPerform calibration through the calibrating system that is included in the Eye-tracking iViewer XTM. Before starting this task, each participant realizes a visual follow-up of four points on a screen to the four corners (up-right, up-left, down-right, down-left). Afterward, the software has an execution verification process of the right position of these stimuli and gives information on the parameter adjustment in degrees. If this adjustment is situated between 0.6\u00ba \u00b1 1 in the right and left eye, it is considered that the calibration is correct, and the task execution starts. An example of the process can be verified in Figure 1.\u200bNOTE: Correct task completion is considered when the degrees in the right and left eye are set at 0.6\u00ba \u00b1 1 standard deviation. In this study, two calibrations were detected among the group of university professors that exceeded the adjustment criterion of 0.6\u00ba \u00b1 1 and two participants were therefore removed. The 25 participants in the first sample were therefore reduced to 23 participants.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62103/62103fig01.jpg\nFigure 1.

At the end, the participant is invited to complete a small crossword puzzle to check that the information presented in the video has been understood\".\nWatch the video clip. The video used in the task can be viewed at the following link:\u00a0https://youtu.be/HlGGgrYDTFs.[href=https://youtu.be/HlGGgrYDTFs]\n\t\tNOTE: The task consists in watching a video that offers information on the origins of European monasteries. The information has been elaborated by a specialist, an Art History teacher. The information is organized in two channels, one visual which includes images and written information presented as outlines and another audio one because a SRL specialist teacher is speaking throughout the video insisting on the most significant contents using verbal emphasis.\nPerforming the crossword puzzle on a Moodle-based virtual platform. Clicking on the crossword icon takes the participant to a virtual platform where the crossword may be completed, to check whether the knowledge has been acquired. The crossword puzzle is presented in Figure 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62103/62103fig02.jpgFigure 2. Crossword puzzle to check the acquired knowledge.

AOIs are defined in the video and are divided into AOIs that contain relevant information versus AOIs that include non-relevant information.\n\t\tNOTE: The AOI assignation is realized by the experimenter who decides which are the relevant or irrelevant AOIs in relation to the presented information.\nExtract the database relating to the parameters for AOI Fixations (\"Event Start Trial Time\", \"Event End Trial Time\" and \"Event Duration\"; \"Fixation Position X\", \"Fixation Position Y\", \"Fixation Average Pupil Size\", \"Fixation Average Pupil Size Y px\", \"Fixation Average Pupil Diameter\", \"Fixation Dispersion X\" and \"Fixation Dispersion Y\").\nImport the database into a statistical processing software package and select the option analyze and then classify, followed by the option k-means cluster. Then select cross-table in the statistical software package, for example SPSS, followed by the 'ANOVA' option, to analyze the differences between the participants (type of adult groups and degree of prior knowledge) with regard to their AOI Fixation parameters31.NOTE: Clustering or cluster analysis is an 'unsupervised' machine-learning technique, and, within k-means, it is a grouping method, the aim of which is to partition a set of n observations into k groups, in which each observation belongs to the group with the closest mean value. In this experiment, k-means clustering was used to check the clusters of participants in the learning task. This correspondence is important, because it offers the teacher or therapist information on the homogeneous functional development of users that goes beyond the diagnosis, providing information to propose similar intervention programs in some areas of functional development.

Preparation of the Rat\nNOTE: We performed the experiments in male rats to avoid any hormonal changes.\nAnesthetize the animal using a mix of ketamine hydrochloride (30 mg/kg) and xylazine hydrochloride (5 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly; with this dose, the rat should be deeply anesthetized for around 1 h.\nPinch the rat's toe; absence of a withdrawal reflex indicates that the animal is fully unconscious. If the rat responds to the pinch, give supplementary anesthesia at one third of the initial dose.\nShave the scalp and disinfect the surgical area with povidone-iodine.\nPlace the animal on a heating pad to maintain a temperature of 38 \u00b0C and stabilize the animal's head in a stereotaxic frame using two ear bars and a bite bar. Use caution to avoid piercing the tympanic membrane with the ear bars.\nProtect the eyes by applying a drop of ophthalmic gel or serum saline to each eye.\n2. Location of the AC in the Temporal Bone of the Rat\nUsing a scalpel, make an incision along the midline to expose the skull and retract the periosteum covering the surface of the cranium.\nUse a sterile cotton tip to gently remove any blood covering the surface of the skull to visualize bregma, lambda, and interaural 0 according to the Paxinos and Watson atlas of the rat brain22.Make an incision in the temporal muscle near its dorsal insertion on the skull with a scalpel. Pull the muscle out using a needle and suture material, and fix the suture material to the stereotactic frame; this will expose the temporal bone. If bleeding occurs, rinse with cold sterile saline.\nPlace a sterile straight needle in the stereotactic micromanipulator, making sure that it is fully secured.\nSlowly lower the needle until it is right above the surface of the skull, so that the tip of the needle is set to interaural 0. Set this point as zero, and determine coordinates from this point.\nDepending on the brain area of interest, vary the stereotactic coordinates. Determine these coordinates by utilizing the Paxinos and Watson atlas of the rat brain22. Once the coordinates are determined, move the needle to match those coordinates.\nTarget the AC using the coordinates of the following four points: A: A/P = -5.8 mm, M/L = +/- 6.4 mm; B: A/P= -2.7 mm, M/L= +/- 6.4 mm; C: A/P= -2.7 mm, M/L= +/- 8.67 mm; D: A/P= -5.8 mm, M/L= +/- 8.67 mm. Lower the needle to right above the temporal bone to visualize each of these four points. Using a marker pen, mark the points on the temporal bone and connect them in order to draw a rectangle; the rectangle will serve as a guide to open of a window in the bone (Figure 1).\n3. Surgical Exposure of the ACOpen the window using an electric drill and a small drill bit (0.6 mm \u00d8). Drill the perimeter of the rectangle at 8,000 rpm until the bone gives away. Cool the drilling surface by rinsing with cold sterile saline to prevent damage to subcortical structures. When the bone gives way, a drop in resistance can be detected. Be careful to not drill the brain.\nWhen the borders are loose, pull up the covering bone with fine forceps and store it in cold sterile saline.\n4. Ablation of the AC\nUsing a surgical microscope (10X), gently cut the meninges with a microsurgical knife and remove them using two fine-pointed forceps. If bleeding occurs, rinse with cold sterile saline.\nGently aspirate the AC using a surgical suction device (pressure -0.24 bar) coupled to a sterile 20 G blunt tip needle. This point is critical and needs to be performed very carefully: aspirate only the six cortical layers and not the underlying white matter.\nAspirate until the perforating arteries stop bleeding.\nWhen the aspiration is finished, cover the injured area with the extracted bone and apply an absorbable hemostatic gauze.\nLet the temporal muscle recover its original position, and then suture the skin using wound clips (9 mm). Apply antibiotic ointment (see the Table of Materials). Continue to apply ointment to the wound twice daily for three days.\n\tNOTE: Each application consists of a thin layer applied on the wound.\nInject buprenorphine subcutaneously in the back of the rat (0.05 mg/kg) as an analgesic 1 h after the surgery, and then every 8 h during 72 h.\nKeep the animal on the heating pad until it wakes up, and return it to its housing cage to recover.House animals individually to prevent cage mates from touching the sutured area, and provide some enrichment items. Change the sawdust daily to prevent infection, and carefully check that the animal recovers properly and does not show any signs of discomfort.\n5. Tissue Collection\nCaution: When handling paraformaldehyde (PFA), both solid and aqueous, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and use a safety cabinet.\nNOTE: Prepare 750 mL formaldehyde solution by dissolving 4% (w/v) PFA into 1x phosphate buffered solution (PBS) using heat (55 \u00b0C). Filter the formaldehyde solution with filter paper. Prepare Ringer's Solution by dissolving 8.5 g of NaCl, 0.25 g of KCl, and 0.2 g NaHCO3in 1,000 mL of water (solution pH = 6.9).\nLet the animal survive for as long as it is needed for the study. When the research performed with the AC ablated rat is completed, terminally anaesthetize it by intra-peritoneal injection of 0.1 mL of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). Assess the depth of anesthesia by toe pinch and the absence of withdrawal reflex.\nWhen the animal is deeply anesthetized, perform an intracardiac perfusion23 of 125 mL of Ringer's Solution followed by 750 mL of formaldehyde solution by using a needle gauge of 1.8 mm of inside diameter.\nWhen the perfusion is finished, decapitate the rat at the first cervical vertebra.\nUse scissors to remove the skin and muscle from the head and expose the skull. Use scissors to cut and open the foramen magnum and remove the back of the skull.\nMake a transversal cut into the orbital bone using Spencer scissors, and use rongeurs to cut along the top edges of the skull to expose the brain. Be careful not to damage the brain.Once the brain is exposed, carefully remove the dura mater using fine-pointed forceps. Use a finger to gently scoop under and elevate the brain. Raise the brain and cut the nerves until it is free. Immerse the brain in formaldehyde solution and store it at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h.\n6. Localization of the AC Lesions\nAfter post-fixation, carefully place the brain into a sagittal rat brain matrix exposing the lateral surface of the brain.\nPlace a camera 21 cm above the cortex surface using a camera holder, select the \"super macro shooting\" mode, and take a picture of the brain surface.\nPlace the brain into a coronal rat brain matrix exposing the dorsal surface of the brain, and take another picture.\nUsing an image editor program, open the images and scale them down 50% to make it easier to work with them. Identify the bregma, lambda, and interaural 0 references on the picture according to Paxinos and Watson coordinates19, and mark their position in the pictures (Figure 2). Draw the contour of the ablation over the lateral picture of the brain. Calculate the perimeter.\nImport the coordinate map where the primary (A1) and secondary regions (Dorsal and Ventral Cortices) of AC are located18 to the file of the editor program where you are working with the pictures. Click on the map and drag it to superimpose it to the lateral photograph of the ablated brain.\nMake the bregma and lambda references of the coordinate map coincide with the bregma and lambda references identified in the picture of the lateral brain.\nUse the rhinal fissure as a reference to adjust the picture of the brain to the map, and make them coincide (Figure 2B).\nCalculate the percentage of the lesion relative to the area occupied by the AC.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      Habituation and baseline locomotor activity in open field\n    \nTiming: 2\u00a0days\n      This step is performed to allow ArcTRAP;Ai140-GFP;D1-tdT mice (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) habituate to the testing environment and prevent novelty-induced\n      effects on neuronal activity. Each mouse will be assigned to one specific\n      chamber and will be trained in that chamber for the entire experiment\n      period. To track and record locomotor activity in the open field arena, we\n      utilize the Activity Monitor 7 software (Med Associates), which is\n      connected to an infrared beam detector on the floor.

Set the session time to 30\u00a0min. The\n              protocol will wait until the animal is detected in the box to\n              start the recording.Use 1-mL insulin syringe to prepare 0.9% sterile saline.\n            \nNote: Each mouse will have its own\n              syringe. Based on the calculation of the required fentanyl volume\n              for each mouse, withdraw the same volume of saline.\n            \n            Administer 0.9% sterile saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the mouse\n            (Figures\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I and 1J).\n            \n                Use the same way as during the scruffing habituation to grab the\n                mouse (Figures\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A\u20131H).\n                \nNote: It is not necessary to\n                  sterilize the skin before the injection. The antiseptic agents\n                  could not penetrate the fur. This will simply prolong the\n                  injection time and make the animal stressful.\n                \nCritical: For all the i.p.\n                  injections described in this protocol, after the needle enters\n                  the peritoneum, withdraw \u223c0.02\u00a0mL before injecting any\n                  substance to make sure the needle does not puncture the organs\n                  and no blood is withdrawn.\n                \n            After injection, put the mouse back in the cage.

A thin spatula (2) will be used to\n              transfer 4-OHT powder (3). We will make two 1.5-mL microcentrifuge\n              tubes (4) of 0.5\u00a0mL 4-OHT (10\u00a0mg/mL in 200-proof ethanol [5]).\n            \n              (D) Zero the scale for the 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.

Stock solution in 20\u00a0mg/mL can be stored\n              at \u221220\u00b0C for up to 3\u00a0weeks.\n            \nCritical: Ensure no visible\n              white 4-OHT solids are present in the ethanol. Double-check before\n              proceeding to the next step.\n            \n            In the same vial, add the oil mix to combine with the 4-OHT/ethanol\n            solution at 1:1 ratio.\n            \nNote: For 0.5\u00a0mL 4-OHT/ethanol, it\n              needs 0.5\u00a0mL of the oil mix (Figures\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G and\n              4H).\n            \n            Vortex again to ensure 4-OHT/ethanol solution is fully mixed with\n            the oil (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\n            \nNote: The solution may appear\n              cloudy and then become clear (Figures\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J and\n              4K).\n            \nCritical: The next step will\n              evaporate the ethanol to \u201ctransfer\u201d the 4-OHT from the ethanol to\n              the oil. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that the\n              4-OHT/ethanol is fully mixed with the oil. Otherwise, the 4-OHT\n              itself will not easily dissolve in the oil and the final\n              concentration will be lower than desired.\n            \n            Using the vacuum centrifuge, concentrate the 4-OHT/ethanol/oil\n            mixture. Set the temperature at 37\u00b0C and time for 45\u00a0min (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]L).\n            \nNote: If using the same centrifuge\n              and rotor as ours, the speed is around 40 g.\n            \nCritical: Check the volume\n              after 45\u00a0min. If the volume is greater than the volume of the oil\n              mix, the ethanol is not completely evaporated. Re-concentrate for\n              another 15\u00a0min. Repeat this step until all the ethanol is\n              evaporated (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]M).\n            \nNote: If a vacuum centrifuge isnot readily available, an alternative method is to directly mix\n              4-OHT into the oil mixture by shaking it overnight at 37\u00b0C.52[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib52]\n              However, this process may result in undissolved particles even\n              after overnight shaking. Users should carefully consider the\n              timing between 4-OHT preparation and the tagging experiment.\n            \nNote: The final 4-OHT/oil mix\n              (10\u00a0mg/mL) can be stored under 4\u00b0C for a maximum of 12\u00a0h before\n              use.\n            \n        Tag fentanyl-activated neurons.\n        \nCritical: We will inject 4-OHT\n          when the mouse is under anesthesia. This is due to the fact that 4-OHT\n          injection is very painful, and this experience will activate pain- or\n          stress-related areas. By using anesthesia, we can minimize these\n          confounding factors, especially for the control group that will not\n          receive drug exposure. This approach will help ensure that our results\n          accurately reflect the effects of the drug on the experimental group,\n          while controlling for other variables that could affect neuronal\n          activation.\n        \n            Prepare a 1-mL regular syringe for 4-OHT/oil.\n            \nNote: The dose for 4-OHT is\n              50\u00a0mg/kg. Calculate the required volume based on the dose and the\n              body weight.\n            \n                Use a 18-gauge needle to withdraw the 4-OHT, then switch to a\n                26-gauge needle for injection.\n                \nNote: Each mouse should have\n                  its own syringe and needle.\n                \n                Place syringes next to the anesthesia chamber.\n                \nCritical: Do not use a\n                  1-mL insulin syringe in this step. Since the needle size is\n                  small and is fixed on the syringe, it will be difficult to\n                  withdraw the oil. Using needles with a size larger than\n                  20-gauge (e.g., 18G as we used) is optimal to withdraw\n                  4-OHT/oil mix.\n                \n            After the locomotor measurements are completed for the third\n            fentanyl-injection day, gently place the mice back in the cage.\n          \n            Immediately transfer the mice to the anesthesia chamber table.\n          \n            Turn on the oxygen flow and place the mice into the anesthesiachamber.\n          \n            Set the isoflurane level to the maximum to quickly knock-down the\n            mice.\n            \nNote: Once mice are under deep\n              anesthesia, turn off the oxygen and isoflurane flow.\n            \n            Hold the mice and inject 4-OHT (i.p.; Figures\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I\n            and 1J).\n            \nCritical: 4-OHT/oil mix is\n              dense, so the injection will be difficult. Do not exert too much\n              pressure on the syringe plunger, otherwise the needle may be\n              pushed out by excessive pressure and harm the animal.\n            \n            Immediately place the mice back in the cage after injection.\n            \nCritical: Leave undisturbed\n              for the next 3\u00a0h before returning to the home cage.\n            \nNote: If the anesthesia chamber is\n              far away from the behavioral testing room, consider the timing of\n              transferring the animals to the anesthesia chamber. Minimize this\n              time to ensure the best tagging.\n            \n        House mice in the home cage for the next three weeks to allow the\n        sufficient expresison of the target gene (e.g., GFP or hM4Di).\n      \n        Perfuse the mice and section the brains for confocal imaging (Figures\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2764-Fig5.jpg\n              Figure\u00a05.

From days 2\u20139, mice in the fentanyl groups\n          (Fen+mCh and Fen+Gi) receive fentanyl injections on days 2, 4, 6, 8,\n          and are restricted in their designated drug-paired compartment for\n          30\u00a0min. These mice receive saline injections on days 3, 5, 7, 9 and\n          are restricted to the non-drug-paired compartment for 30\u00a0min. Mice in\n          the saline group (Sal+mCh) receive saline injections for all the\n          conditioning days and are restricted in either compartment in\n          alternate order. After the last drug conditioning (day 8), mice\n          receive 4-OHT injections to tag neurons activated during the\n          conditioning. On day 10, all mice are placed in the CPP chambers (with\n          the center gate open) for 30\u00a0min to test their drug-induced baseline\n          preference.

It is composed of four\n      fentanyl-injection sessions which occur every other day, with four\n      saline-injection days in between (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). Tagging\n      of fentanyl-activated neurons will be conducted on the last fentanyl\n      conditioning session. After the last saline conditioning, we will measure\n      the first fentanyl-induced CPP, which will serve as the baseline for the\n      chemogenetic manipulation. Animals will return to the home cage for three\n      weeks to allow DREADD to be sufficiently expressed in tagged neurons.\n      After three weeks, animals will be tested for CPP again with the injection\n      of the DREADD agonist C21.\n    \n        Determine the assignment of the fentanyl-paired compartment.\n        \n            Use the analysis function in the EthoVision software, pull out the\n            time spent in each compartment by every mouse during the\n            pre-conditioning day.\n            \nNote: See\n              troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\n            \n            Assign one compartment as the drug-paired compartment to all mice\n            and calculate the CPP score.\n            \nNote: CPP score is calculated as:\n              time in the paired chamber\u00a0\u2013 time in the unpaired chamber.\n            \nCompare the mean value for each group.\n            Change the assignment for each mouse in each group accordingly.\n            \nCritical: The goal is that\n              each group has mean CPP scores around \u201c0\u201d, which represent equal\n              place preference for two compartments. Also ensure CPP scores are\n              not different between each group (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).Note: In our protocol, fentanyl is\n              administered on conditioning days 1, 3, 5, 7 and saline is\n              administered on conditioning days 2, 4, 6, 8 for drug groups. This\n              is to ensure fentanyl is completely metabolized during the saline\n              conditioning sessions. However, the order for saline or drug\n              sessions can be switched, such that saline is administered on day\n              1 and fentanyl on day 2. Saline control group will receive saline\n              injections for all the conditioning days.\n            \n        Fentanyl CPP condition (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\n        \n            Prepare the testing room and habituate the mice in the room as\n            described in step 7.\n          \nClose the center guillotine door.\n            Load the protocol in EthoVision software, and set the trial duration\n            to 30\u00a0min.\n          \n            Pre-fill 1-mL insulin syringes with fentanyl or saline.\n            \nNote: Each mouse will have its own\n              syringe and the volume of fentanyl or saline is calculated based\n              on the body weight.\n            \nAdminister the fentanyl or saline intraperitoneally.\n            Gently place the mouse back in the cage and leave undisturbed for\n            15\u00a0min.\n          \n            Gently transfer the mouse to its designated drug-paired compartment.\n            \nCritical: Make sure not\n              introducing any external disturbance (light, sound, etc.) during\n              the conditioning. Since our CPP chamber is not single-housed in\n              sound-attenuating chambers, animals will be easily distracted.\n              This will introduce unwanted cues to the mice.\n            \nNote: For drug groups, they will\n              be conditioned in the non-paired compartment on saline days. For\n              saline groups, they will be conditioned in both compartments in\n              alternate order.\n            \n            Check if the Ethovision can capture all the mice's movements.\n          \nClick the recording button to start the trial.\n            Once the trial is finished, gently grab the mouse from the CPP\n            chamber back in the cage.\n          \n            Leave mice undisturbed for 30\u00a0min before returning to the home cage.\n          \nTagging of fentanyl-activated neurons in CPP\nTiming: 1.5 hOn conditioning day 7 (the last fentanyl conditioning day), active neurons\n      during this contextual learning will be tagged by 4-OHT injection. This\n      will allow pre-infused DREADDs to be expressed only in those tagged\n      neurons. We will later chemogenetically manipulate these neurons to\n      examine their roles in fentanyl-induced contextual learning.\n    \nPrepare 4-OHT as in step 3 and tag active neurons as in step 4.\nCritical: After injecting 4-OHT, leave\n      mice undisturbed for the next 3\u00a0h before returning to the home cage (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\n    \nFirst CPP test\nTiming: 1\u00a0day\n      This step is to measure fentanyl-induced place preference. It will help us\n      confirm that mice have acquired fentanyl-induced contextual learning and\n      that the results will serve as a baseline for the later chemogenetic\n      manipulation.\n    \nNote: Mice in the fentanyl group that do\n      not exhibit CPP will be excluded from subsequent experiments. In our\n      batch, 1 out of 18 mice in the fentanyl group did not show CPP. The\n      percentage of animals that exhibit CPP can be influenced by several\n      factors, such as drug type, does, etc.57[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib57] It is a good\n      practice to conduct a pilot experiment to identify the percentage of\n      animals that exhibit CPP, which can help in determining the appropriate\n      number of animals for DREADD experiments.\n    \nNote: See\n      troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\n    \n        Test CPP on day 10 (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\n        \n            Prepare the testing room and habituate the mice in the room as\n            described in step 7.\n          \nOpen the center guillotine door.\n            Load the protocol in EthoVision software, set the trial duration to\n            30\u00a0min.\n            \nNote: No drug or saline will be\n              administered during the test session.\n            \n            Gently place the mice near the center guillotine door in the same\n            CPP chamber where they undergo conditioning.\n          \n            Check if the EthoVision can capture all the mice's movements.\n          \nClick the recording button to start the trial.Once the trial is finished, gently grab the mouse from the CPP\n            chamber back in the cage.\n          \n            Leave mice undisturbed for 30\u00a0min before returning to the home cage.\n            \nNote: Mice will stay in the home\n              cage for three weeks before the chemogenetic manipulation. This\n              will provide sufficient time for the target gene (e.g., hM4Di) to\n              be expressed.\n            \n      Chemogenetic manipulation of fentanyl-activated neurons in the second CPP\n      test\n    \nTiming: 2\u00a0days\nTiming: 15\u00a0min (for step 12)\n    \n      Three weeks after tagging, fentanyl-activated dorsostriatal neurons during\n      contextual learning will be chemogenetically inhibited. This\n      loss-of-function manipulation is critical to understand whether these\n      tagged neurons are required for fentanyl-context memory. This part is\n      separated into two days. On the first day, we chemogenetically inhibit\n      tagged neurons during CPP memory retrieval. On the second day, we will\n      chemogenetically inhibit tagged neurons during fentanyl-induced locomotor\n      activation.\n    \n        Prepare C21.\n        \nNote: See\n          troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\n        \nCritical: Make fresh C21 solution\n          every day for optimal results of chemogenetic manipulations. We\n          suggest making the solution in the morning of the testing day.\n        \n            Make 0.2\u00a0mg/mL working solution with 0.9% sterile saline.\n            \nNote: We choose this concentration\n              because the dose we use is 1\u00a0mg/kg.58[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib58] For\n              10\u00a0g of the mouse body weight, we inject\n              \n1  m\ng / k g\n0.2  m\ng / m L\n \u00a0= 5\u00a0mL/kg\u00a0= 0.05\u00a0mL/10 g.\n            \nStore the working solution in a 4\u00b0C fridge until use.\nStore the original C21 powder in a \u221220\u00b0C freezer.\n        Chemogenetically inhibit tagged neurons during the second CPP test (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\n        \n            Prepare the testing room and habituate the mice in the room as\n            described in step 7.\n          \nOpen the center guillotine door.\n            Load the protocol in EthoVision software, set the trial duration to\n            30\u00a0min.\n          \n            Pre-fill 1-mL insulin syringes with C21.\n            \nNote: Each mouse will have its ownsyringe and the volume of C21 is calculated based on the body\n              weight.\n            \nAfter 30-min habituation, administer C21 intraperitoneally.\n            Leave mice undisturbed in the cage for 45\u00a0min.\n            \nNote: In this protocol, we\n              utilized three groups of mice (Saline+mCherry, Fentanyl+mCherry,\n              Fentanyl+hM4Di) to investigate the functional role of\n              fentanyl-activated neurons in contextual memory retrieval. All\n              groups received C21 injections; however, to control for any\n              factors that may have been induced by the i.p. injection\n              procedure, it is recommended to include control groups (e.g.,\n              Fentanyl+mCherry with i.p. saline injection instead of C21) for\n              both CPP test and locomotor activity test.\n            \n            After 45\u00a0min, gently transfer the mice from the cage to the same CPP\n            chamber where they undergo conditioning.\n          \nPlace the mice near the center guillotine door.\nCheck if the EthoVision can capture all the movements.\nClick the recording button to start the trial.\n            Once the trial is finished, gently grab the mouse from the CPP\n            chamber back in the cage.\n          \n            Leave mice undisturbed for 30\u00a0min before returning to the home cage.\n          \n        Chemogenetically inhibit tagged neurons during fentanyl-induced\n        locomotor activation (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\n        \n            Prepare the testing room and habituate the mice in the room as\n            described in step 7.\n          \nClose the center guillotine door.\n            Load the protocol in EthoVision software, set the trial duration to\n            30\u00a0min.\n          \n            For each mouse, prepare two 1-mL insulin syringes.\n            \n                Pre-fill the first 1-mL insulin syringe with C21, and the second\n                syringe with fentanyl or saline.\n              \nAfter 30-min habituation, administer C21 intraperitoneally.\nLeave mice undisturbed in the cage for 30\u00a0min.\nAdminister fentanyl or saline intraperitoneally.\nLeave mice undisturbed in the cage for 15\u00a0min.\n            Gently transfer the mice from the cage to their fentanyl-paired\n            compartments.\n            \nNote: For the saline group, mice\n              will be placed in either one of the compartments.Check if the EthoVision can capture all the mice's movements.\n          \nClick the recording button to start the trial.\n            Once the trial is finished, gently grab the mouse from the CPP\n            chamber back in the cage.\n          \n            Leave mice undisturbed for 30\u00a0min before returning to the home cage.", "All experiments were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1) Pre-surgical Preparations\nOral solution preparation\n\t\nCreate solutions of 10% sucrose and 0.005% L-menthol in deionized water (pH 7.4). Store these solutions in closed containers, at RT, and remake every 2 weeks, to prevent degradation.\nElectrode calibration solutions\n\t\nMake Tris buffer (pH 7.4) at any time prior to calibration. The solution consists of 12.0 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, 3.25 mM KCl, 1.20 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1.20 mM MgCl2, and 2.00 mM Na2SO4.\nCreate a stock solution of 10 mM dopamine (DA; dopamine hydrochloride) in 0.1 M perchloric acid. The perchloric acid helps prevent oxidation of dopamine. Store this stock solution at -20 \u00b0C and use for up to 6 months. Make several aliquots of the DA stock solution for storage to use each aliquot only once.\nFrom the 10 mM DA stock, dilute solutions in Tris buffer to concentrations of 1 \u03bcM, 500 nM, 250 nM, 125 nM, 62.5 nM, and 31.25 nM.\nFor pH calibration, prepare solutions of Tris buffer with the pH of 7.2, 7.3, 7.5, and 7.6. This will provide solutions that mimic pH shifts that may occur during the in vivo experiment.\nElectrode fabrication\n\t\nBy vacuum suction, aspirate a T-650 carbon fiber (7 \u03bcm diameter) into a borosilicate glass capillary (length 10 mm, outside diameter 0.6 mm, inside diameter 0.4 mm).\nPlace glass capillary filled with carbon fiber into a vertical electrode puller. For initial parameters, set the heater to 55.0 and turn off the magnet. However, further optimization may be necessary as both heater and magnetic settings vary from lab to lab.Note: The electrode should be at least 5.5 cm long (including taper) so that it can easily fit into the micromanipulator and be inserted at least 6.9 mm below dura in the rat brain. If the electrode is too short, recordings from ventral portion of the nucleus accumbens will not be achievable. On the other hand, the total electrode length should not exceed 6.5 cm otherwise it will be too long to fit into the micromanipulator.\nUsing a light microscope, cut the exposed carbon-fiber so that it extends 75-100 \u03bcm beyond the end of the glass. Verify that the electrode has a very tight, barely discernible, seal between the glass electrode and carbon fiber, which will produce minimal noise during subsequent recording. Discard the electrode if there are any noticeable cracks in the glass or if the seal is loose, which is indicative of a poor seal. For more detailed instructions see [12] and [13].\nAssembling the electrode into the micromanipulator\n\t\nObtain a 3 in, 30G\u00a0wire that is insulated along half the length of the wire and use a small brush to apply a thin layer of silver paint directly to the wire. Immediately after applying silver paint, insert the wire into the hole on the top of the electrode to provide a physical and electrical connection to the carbon fiber. Under a microscope, ensure that the silver wire makes contact with the carbon fiber.\nSecure the silver wire and electrode to the micromanipulator using heat shrink.\nPlace the prepared carbon-fiber electrode into purified isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for at least 10 min to clean the electrode surface and to increase subsequent sensitivity to dopamine. After soaking in IPA, rinse the carbon fiber with tap water to remove the IPA.\nReference electrode fabricationTake a 13 mm silver wire containing an approximately 6 mm Ag/Ag Cl mesh (7 mm silver wire alone, 6 mm mesh, 0.4 mm diameter), cut the silver portion down to approximately half its original length and solder the silver portion of the wire to a gold pin.\nApply epoxy over the solder on the pin.\nDip the Ag/Ag Cl mesh end into a copolymer of 5% polytetrafluroethylene and perfluoro-3,6-dioxa-4-methyl-7octene-sulfonic acid 5 times, with 30 min\u00a0air drying periods between each dip.\nAllow the coated Ag/Ag Cl mesh to air dry O/N.\nCure in oven at 120 \u00baC for 1 hr.\n\u00a02) Combined Intraoral Surgery and Intracranial Cannulation Surgery (Approximately 75 min)\nOral catheter fabrication\n\t\nMake the oral catheter, and sterilize by ethylene oxide sterilization, at least 10 days prior to surgery.\nCut PE 100 tubing into 6 cm long segments.\nUsing a soldering iron, melt one end of the PE tubing and immediately press against a solid surface to cool the PE tubing. The result should create a small, flat disc at one end of the PE tubing and should not be flanged. Use a needle (18 G) or push pin to create a hole in the center of this disc.\nOn the other end of the PE tubing, snugly insert the blunt end of a 18 G needle into the tube.\nUsing a standard paper hole puncher, punch several circular pieces of a polytetrafluroethylene sheet (3.18 mm thick, 6 mm in diameter) to create polytetrafluroethylene washers.\nCreate a hole in the center of the washer. Take the needle attached to the PE tubing and push it completely through the washer. Once the needle is through, slide the washer to the bottom of the PE tubing so that it is flush against the washer.\nOral surgeryAfter sterilizing the surgical tools, cannula (trimmed to 2.5 mm below the pedestal before sterilization), and reference electrode, anesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg).\n\t\t\nAfter 5 min, apply a noxious stimulus test (foot or tail pinch) to assess the level of anesthesia. If the subject shows any physical reaction to the noxious stimulus test (flinch response, increase in respiratory or heart rate), administer a ketamine boost of 10% to 15% of the original dose and repeat the noxious stimulus protocol above.\nAfter the rat is fully anesthetized and shows no reaction to the noxious stimulus test, use animal hair clippers to shave the rat's fur from the eyes to about 2 mm behind the ears. Then place the rat on a thin water recirculating heating pad to maintain body temperature during surgery. Apply eye lubricant. Administer the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug, Carprofen (5 mg/kg), by intraperitoneal injection prior to performing any incisions and prior to inserting intraoral cannulas. Use aseptic technique at all times.\nApply betadine followed by 70% ethanol to clean the skin. Repeat 3 times.\nPlace the rat on its back, and open the mouth using a sterile cotton swab. Find the first upper molar.\nInsert the needle into the tissue between the cheek and the first upper molar until the needle exits just behind and medial to the ears.\nPierce the needle through the skin until the PE tubing exits the skin and is accessible.\nPull up on the cannula (gripping by the cannula itself and not the needle) and secure the polytetrafluroethylene washer into the molars so that the catheter remains in place.Note: Cutting the washer into a trapezoid shape and securing it against the molars with the flat side facing the cheek makes this step easier.\nTake another polytetrafluroethylene washer and slide it over the exposed needle, down the plastic tubing, and abut against the incision.\nTo secure the polytetrafluroethylene washer, use sterilized tape to create a triangular \"flag\" so that the washer does not slide up. Secure the washer against the rat's skin and the sterilized tape.\nCut the exposed catheter to allow 2-4 cm of tubing to be exposed above the rat's head.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1 through 2.2.10 for the other side of the mouth.\nIntracranial surgery for voltammetry\n\t\nPlace the rat in the stereotaxic frame and clean the animal\u2019s scalp using a two stage scrub (a betadine scrub followed by a 70% ethanol scrub, perform with a 3 cycle repetition).\nUse sterilized needle nose tweezers and surgical scissors to cut away a 15 x 15 mm section of scalp tissue.\nGently clean the surface of the skull using sterilized cotton tip applicators. Further clean the skull by applying 2 to 3 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide.\nUse a stereotaxic drill to make 3 small (1 mm diameter) holes in the skull for subsequent insertion of screws, 1 hole for the guide cannula, 1 hole for the stimulating electrode, and 1 hole for the reference electrode.\nFor recordings in the NAc core, position the guide cannula at 1.2 mm anterior and 1.4 mm lateral to Bregma. Lower the cannula apparatus until the plastic base is flush with the skull.\nPlace the sterilized reference electrode in the hemisphere contralateral to the guide cannula. Lower the reference approximately 2 mm below the dura.Position the stimulating electrode at 5.2 mm posterior and 1.0 mm lateral to Bregma and lowered 8.0 mm below dura to target the ventral tegmental area (VTA).\nUse a sterilized small surgical screwdriver to secure screws to the skull. Then, insert the reference electrode, stimulating electrode, and guide cannula. Finally, secure all components using cranioplastic cement.\nFor the first 48 hours of post-operative care, administer the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) Carprofen by subcutaneous injection (5 mg/kg). Allow at least 1 week for complete surgical recovery prior to performing voltammetry recording.\n\t\t\nDuring post-operative care, flush oral catheters daily with water. Provide food saturated in water for 2 days to aid the animal in chewing and eating.\u00a0 Provide daily monitoring for potential signs of stress of pain (due to mild infection or dehydration) and provide appropriate interventions as necessary (including administration of fluids, topical administration of antiseptics, and or NSAID Carprofen administration at 5 mg/kg).\n3) Voltammetric Recordings in Awake, Freely Moving Rat\nLowering the electrode and acquiring a DA training set.\n\t\nOn the day of the experiment, check the patency of the oral cannula by infusing 200 \u03bcl of water and observing orofacial responses (to verify that the rat is tasting the water).\nAttach the FSCV headstage to the rat by inserting the stimulating electrode (on the headstage) into the bipolar stimulating electrode cannula (on the rat). Thus, the headstage (miniaturized current-to-voltage converter) connects directly to the bipolar stimulating electrode.Remove the dummy cannula from the cannula apparatus and apply two drops of 50% heparin solution into the cannula. Then gently insert a dummy cannula (slightly longer that the dummy cannula that was previously removed) to clear any blood clots or glial scarring that may have occurred, which will break carbon fiber electrodes that will subsequently be inserted during the experiment. Extend the cannula used for clearing clots 3-4 mm below the skull (at least 2 mm above the recording site).\nInsert the micromanipulator, with electrode, into the guide cannula and place the omega ring in a \"locked\" position.\nConnect the reference electrode wire from the headstage to the appropriate pin. Then connect the working electrode wire from the micromanipulator to the appropriate wire on the headstage.\nLower the electrode to approximately 4-4.5 mm below skull.\nUse a potentiostat to apply a triangular waveform (400 V/s, -0.4 to +1.3 V). Apply the waveform to the electrode at 60 Hz for at least 10 min, then change the waveform application frequency to 10 Hz for subsequent experimental recordings.\n\t\tNote: The 60 Hz waveform application step produces a stable carbon fiber surface and will help prevent electrical drift\nApply electrical stimulation to the VTA using various frequencies (10 to 60 Hz) pulses (10 to 30 pulses) and currents (50 to 150 \u03bcA) all with a pulse width of 2 ms/phase, to evoke different concentrations of DA release and pH shifts. Acquire at least 5 different concentrations of DA release and 5 different pH shifts. Wait (2 - 3 min\u00a0minimum) between stimulations to allow for vesicular reloading[14].Note: It is important to obtain stimulations that produce DA concentrations across the entire range that will be collected during the subsequent experiment since they will be used as a training set for Principal Component Analysis (see section 5.1).\nLower the electrode into the NAc core (6.3 mm ventral to dura). Subsequently lower the electrode in 100 \u03bcm increments within the NAc core until transient DA release events are observed at frequencies of at least 1 per min.\nConnect the tubing (inner diameter 1/32\", outer diameter 3/32\") to a 20 ml syringe, attached to a syringe pump. On the other end of the tube, use a beveled 23 G needle to connect the tubing to the rat's cannula. Ensure that the tubing is filled completely with the desired tastant and verify that no bubbles exist in the tubing.\n\t\tNote: Typically, administer a small amount of tastant into the mouth of the rat prior to recording to ensure that the first infusion for recording delivers the full infusion amount and not any residual water or air in the tubing. Moreover, this allows the animal to have some prior experience with the tastant since novel tastants, even appetitive ones, can be aversive initially due to its novelty.\nFor data collection, infuse 200 \u03bcl of tastant (6.5 sec using a pump and previously described tubing). Infuse the tastant every 1-3 min. Infuse a total of 25 times per tastant. Each infusion delivers 200 \u03bcl of solution.\nIf multiple tastants are being delivered in a single experiment, flush the oral catheter with water after collecting data for one tastant and wait at least 20 min\u00a0before infusing the new tastant.After the DA recording session, prepare for histological verification by creating a small lesion at the recording site. To preserve the carbon fiber electrode for subsequent calibration, first retract the electrode and remove the micromanipulator. Then use a new micromanipulator with a glass microelectrode and a tungsten wire (extending 100\u00a0\u03bcm beyond the glass tip) to the same depth (below dura) as the original carbon fiber microelectrode.\nFor histological verification, create a small lesion by applying 3 V at the tungsten wire and increasing the voltage at 1 V increments, every 10 sec, until the 10 V setting is reached.\nIf a standard concentration curve has already been created using multiple carbon fiber electrodes, perform the lesion step above (3.1.14) by applying the potential directly the carbon fiber electrode.\n\t\tNote: This lesion method will damage the carbon fiber and prevent subsequent calibration with that specific electrode.\nEuthanize the animal using a lethal injection pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, i.p.).\nDislodge the headcap with the cannulae using pliers by pulling directly upward on the headcap. Do not twist the headcap since this will cause unnecessary damage to the brain and make it challenging to identify the location of the electrode during histology.\n\t\t\nRemove the brain and place in 4% formalin for 3 days followed by 30% sucrose for 1 week. Create 30 \u03bcm slices using a cryostat, mount on cover slips and examine slices under a light microscope to identify the location of the carbon fiber or tungsten lesion.\n\t\t\tNote: Perfusion is optional for 3.1.17.\n4) Electrode Calibration\nUsing the flow cell to create a current-concentration conversion factor.In order to determine electrode sensitivity, calibrate electrodes after each experiment using a flow \"t-cell\" apparatus. Lower the electrode into the \"t-cell\" while Tris buffer, pH solutions, or DA solutions are washed over the electrode surface (at a rate of 2 ml/min). Use a six-position air solenoid actuator to switch back and forth between buffer and pH or DA solution.\nFor each calibration, collect voltammetric data during 5 sec application of Tris buffer (baseline) followed by 5 sec application of pH or DA solution, followed by 20 sec application of Tris buffer (30 sec total file). Repeat each run 3 times for each calibration standard concentration, counterbalancing between different concentrations of each standard.\nFor each sample collection, measure the peak DA or pH-evoked current. Average the peak current across each trial to obtain a concentration versus peak current relationship. For more detailed instructions see [12] and [13].\n5) Data Analysis\nUsing a training set in principal component analysis (PCA)\n\tNote: During a voltammetry experiment, output is produced as current, which is the result of dopamine oxidation and reduction, pH shifts, and electrochemical noise. PCA allows separation of these factors so that one can isolate the desired components (DA and pH) and remove additional components that might distort the desired signals (for a more detailed description, see 15, 16).\n\t\nAssign a calibration factor to the output current (approximately 5-10 nA/\u03bcM) after PCA to allow concentration values of the analytes to be determined.\nUse the training set obtained during an experiment to \"train\" the PCA model to separate out DA, pH, and other factors. PCA takes the training set cyclic voltammograms (collected in section 3.1.8) and determines which essential characteristics of the voltammogram can be used to identify each analyte collected during in vivo voltammetry recordings.To determine the number of principal components to keep, use a Malinowski F-test. Typically, keep only 2 or 3 principal components which normally explain about 95-99% of the variance in the data. For further discussion on implementing the Malinowski F-test, see17.\n\t\tNote: Once the number of components are determined, the PCA analysis effectively will project the measured voltammograms from DA and pH training sets onto the principal components that have been retained. The result is a data set that has been filtered so that only DA (or pH) data remains and the residual data that does not resemble DA or pH is removed (See Representative Results for expected output). For a further detailed explanation and step by step instruction for using PCA for voltammetric analysis see Materials sheet and16, 17.\nSubscription Required.

Design the dietary assessment app\nCreate the visual design of the app considering important aspects such as animation, branding, color, layout, and typography20.\n\tNOTE: As space, color, fonts, graphics, and interface elements highlight content and convey interactivity, it is essential to incorporate elements facilitating the functionality of the app.Select a trustworthy FCDB (here, NEVO) to facilitate nutrient calculations of the collected food intake data14.\nCreate a food list by critically evaluating the description of the food items mentioned in the FCDB.\n\tNOTE: FCDBs are mostly developed for professional use; food descriptions are often complex and hinder searchability (e.g., \"margarine low-fat 35% fat < 10 g of saturated fats unsalted\"23).\nFormulate search engine requirements; consider the use of punctuation marks, foreign names, misspellings, different search terms, and ranking of search results to facilitate searchability of food items.\nSelect portion size estimation (aid) by evaluating various existing dietary assessment tools and field testing of suitable options.\nDesign routing within the app to ensure that the user's navigation through the app is logical, predictable, and easy to follow.\nDesign backend features and requirements to control the app; include functions related to overall project management, project-specific management (e.g., participants, invitations, data collection), and user management (e.g., authorizations).\n3. Evaluations by researchers\nNOTE: Following each upgrade, the app was tested by nutrition scientists and research dieticians with expertise in dietary assessment (in-house testing) to verify whether functionalities improved as anticipated. The following instructions are to be executed by researchers.\nConduct expert evaluation by means of cognitive walkthroughs to simulate a first-time user experience so that the experts can explore the app individually and without guidance28. Ensure that the cognitive walkthroughs consist of the following steps.\n\t\nMake sure that the expert completes a general questionnaire inquiring about the brand and type of smartphone.\nInstall the app on the expert's smartphone.\n\t\tNOTE: To ensure proper installation and functioning and minimize the risk of interruptions during the evaluation, it is recommended that the researcher first verifies the app's functionality.Instruct the expert on test procedures in which each expert is asked to take on the role of first-time user (i.e., research participant). Emphasize that the evaluation is performed from a user's perspective and not from the expert's own perspective.\n\t\tNOTE: The user was assumed to be an experienced smartphone user and to have knowledge on the use of apps in general. However, this app was used for the first time.\nStart the screen and audio recording.\nHave the expert complete the cognitive walkthrough while using the app and carrying out a predetermined set of tasks31: 1) \"I want to record my dinner. I started with a cup of tomato soup and a glass of milk.\", 2) \"Thereafter, I ate a pasta dish, which I consume regularly and want to enter it as a favorite (i.e., predecessor of My Dishes).\" [recipe was provided], 3) \"As I also consumed the pasta dish, I want to add this to today's food intake record.\", and 4) \"I entered everything I ate during dinner.

A second researcher can be consulted in case of ambiguities.\nConduct quantitative validation of dietary intake records against validated traditional methods and preferably independent measures3.\n\t\u200bNOTE: The app is being validated against web-based and telephone-based (i.e., interviews) 24hRs as well as independent urinary and blood biochemical markers. As the quantitative validation of the app is outside the scope of this paper, this will not be discussed further.\n4. Using the backend system for app and study managementNOTE: The system has three authorization levels: (1) administrator-this authorization level provides access to all sections of the backend (i.e., creating new users, determining user authorization, and granting users access to one or more projects); (2) project managers-this authorization level allows access to specific projects and the possibility to create new projects; and (3) researchers-this authorization level only provides access to the specific projects that researchers are involved in.\nManagement of users and projects in the backend by administrators\n\t\nAccess the online backend via traqq.idbit.net, with login credentials (i.e., username, password).\nCreate a new project by clicking on the Projects tab and then on Create a new project.\nIn the next screen, enter the requested project details (i.e., project name, contact description, contact email, contact phone, contact website).\n\t\tNOTE: Only the project name is mandatory to create a new project. The contact description, email, phone number, and website will become visible in the app under the Contact & Info button.\nSelect the desired features (i.e., product list, ask eating occasion and/or time of consumption, record or recall).\n\t\tNOTE: Each new project requires individual decision-making with respect to the most appropriate dietary assessment method (i.e., record or recall), food list, portion size estimation, and eating occasion or meal times.\nSave the new project by clicking on Save.\n\t\tNOTE: When the screen closes, the administrator returns to the Project overview screen.\nNext, create a new user by clicking on the User tab and then on Add new user.\nIn the following screen, enter a Username, a Password, and assign the user a Role (i.e., administrator, manager, or user).\nSave the new user by clicking on Save.\n\t\tNOTE: When the screen closes, the administrator returns to the User overview screen.Assign a user to a project by clicking on the notepad icon (i.e., Edit column) for a specific user.\nAssign a project by opening the dropdown menu under Linked Projects, selecting the desired project, and clicking on Add.\n\t\tNOTE: This action needs be repeated for each project the user needs to be assigned to.\nCommunicate the log-in credentials to the new user along with the backend URL.\nManagement of projects in the backend by researchers (i.e., Manager or User role)\n\t\nLog in to the backend via traqq.idbit.net by using the credentials provided by the administrator.\nClick on Go to projects to manage the projects.\nClick on the arrow in the View column for the desired project.\n\t\tNOTE: After doing this, the researcher is taken to a Project Overview page, and new tabs for this specific project appear.\nEnter the participants in the backend by clicking on the Participants tab. Next, when a Participant Overview screen appears, click on Add new participant.\nIn the following screen, enter Codename, Notes (optional), Login ID, Login Key, and ending with Save.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended that the Participant's study ID be used as both codename and login ID. This minimizes confusion for the participant in case of multiple login credentials. Moreover, the codename is visible in the responses. Using the participant ID makes it easy to use the data. This option needs to be repeated for each participant. For larger groups, Import participants from file (.csv) can be used. Here, the same details are required for each participant. The backend may not contain any personal information of participants.\nSchedule invitations for each participant by clicking on the Invitations tab. Next, when an Invitation Overview screen appears, click on Add new invitation.In the following screen, select a Participant from the dropdown menu, and enter Period start time, Period end time, Opening time, Closing time, Survey URL (i.e., optional for implementation of additional questions), Notes (optional), Enable (always yes).\n\t\tNOTE: The Period start and end time refer to reporting time frame (i.e., what has been consumed between ..:.. and ..:..). In contrast, opening and closing time refer to the period in which the participant can actually report their intake. The correct implementation of an external survey requires some coding; for this, help from the administrator is recommended. For the majority of the invitations, the Import invitations from (.csv) option under File can be used. The file requires the same information as for the manual input. Invitations can also be created via Sampling Schemes (i.e., where the system generates a random invitation scheme across different days and times based on a preset of rules such as sampling period, number of required invitations, response deadline). An advantage of the Sampling Schemes option is that the system automatically schedules a new invitation in case of non-response.\nTrack data collection via the Calendar tab by selecting a participant of interest from the dropdown menu.\n\t\tNOTE: The calendar provides an overview of scheduled invitations within a project, either in general or for specific participants. Future invitations are portrayed in blue, completed past invitations are green, while past invitations without response are red. Responses to invitations can also be checked via the Response tab.\nTrack responses via the Response tab.\n\t\tNOTE: In the Response section, the reported food intake data (i.e., food item, consumed amount, eating occasion and/or time of consumption) is gathered.\nRequests the administrator for data export.\u200bNOTE: Data can be exported from the backend to a .csv file for further analysis (e.g., responses/food intake data, compliance data) by the administrator. Responses include reported food items, selected portion sizes, consumed amounts in grams, and eating occasions/times.\nImport the .csv file into nutrition calculation software for in-depth nutrient analyses.\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: The data can be imported into nutrition calculation software that makes use of the Dutch FCDB.\n5. Use of the app by the participants during the study\nDownload the freely available app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android), and access the app by logging in.\n\tNOTE: Login credentials, as provided by the researcher, are required to access the app (step 4.2.5.). After logging in, the app sends invitations as scheduled in the backend based on the participant's credentials (step 4.2.7.).\nAfter receiving an invitation via the app, report food intake.\n\tNOTE: Participants can only register their food intake on predetermined days and times.\n\t\nOpen the app by clicking on the notification received or by opening the app via the app icon.\n\t\tNOTE: After opening the app, an Invitation Overview screen appears where previous and current invitations are displayed.\nClick on the open invitation.\n\t\tNOTE: Participant is taken to an Overview screen where the invitation period is visible.\nEnter the food item consumed first by clicking on Product toevoegen (Add food item).\n\t\tNOTE: The participant is taken to the Search screen.\nStart typing the name of the consumed item (e.g., orange juice [jus d 'orange]). Click on the desired item as it appears whilst typing.\nIn the following screen, report the consumed amount (Hoeveelheid), corresponding portion size description (Portie), eating occasion (Maaltijdmoment) and/or time of consumption (Tijdstip), and end by saving (Opslaan) .\nRepeat the aforementioned steps until all food items are reported.Submit the list (recall) by clicking on (Lijst versturen) (Send List), or the invitation automatically closes at the end of the day (record).\n\t\t\u200bNOTE: The Send List option is also visible in the record version, so participants using the record can also send their input to the database.

Apparatus\nNOTE: The overview of the apparatus is shown in Figure 1. The apparatus was developed and modified in reference to previous studies16,17.\nConstruct a clear acrylic box (19 cm x 110 cm x 20 cm) with a central partition (5 cm wide) and insert two guillotine doors. Place the guillotine doors 15 cm away from each end of the box. Mount a buzzer (400 Hz, 75 dB) on the partition, and set up a pellet dispenser for serving a reward pellet (45 mg) into a food receptacle on the subject\u2019s side of the box.\nSet up a metal lever (grip bar: \u03c63 mm, 5 cm high) on a shelf inside the central partition, which has a slit (1.5 cm wide) on each wall facing the runway (Figure 2), in order to allow the subject rat to access the lever by using its forelimbs. On the confederate\u2019s side, however, insert a transparent wall in front of the partition\u2019s wall that prohibits the confederate from accessing the lever.Place a switch for activating the dispenser under the lever that is pressed by the lever-pull movement of rats. Tie the proper length of gut to the lever, which is needed for the experimenter to pull up the lever.\nUse Arduino Mega 2560 REV3 to control the guillotine doors, buzzer, and pellet dispenser, and to obtain the value from the infrared sensors and switch of the dispenser. Prepare an air compressor (25 L) to operate the air cylinder and open the guillotine door.\nPlace a video camera near the partition of the outside of the apparatus, in order to record lever-pull performance of the rats from a lateral view (60 frames per second [fps]). Use an adequate video playback software to conduct frame-by-frame analysis of the video recording.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: A schematic of the apparatus used in this protocol.

Procedure\nHandling and habituation for the reward pellets\nBefore the training procedures, handle all rats for 10 min/day for 3 days by the experimenter.\nAs a habituation for the reward pellets, give each rat 3 g of reward pellets for 3 days after handling.\nHabituation to the apparatus\nSubject ratsOn the third day of habituation for the reward pellets, before the experimenter gives daily pellets, place each rat in the runway of the subject\u2019s side of the apparatus for 15 min for habituation, with the guillotine door closed.\nConfederate rats\nNOTE: There are two habituation sessions.\n\t\t\nAt the first habituation, place each rat on the runway of the confederate\u2019s side of the apparatus for 15 min during the same period as step 3.2.1.1.\nAt the second habituation, follow the method in step 3.2.2.1 on the day after subject rats completed training for the run-and-pull sequence (as mentioned in section 3.6).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Conduct habituation sessions for confederate rats and subject rats separately, i.e., one rat at a time. Do not let a rat meet another rat in the apparatus until the test phase starts.\nMagazine training\nNOTE: For the subject rats, conduct a magazine training session on the next day of the habituation to the apparatus as follows. If rats do not eat all the food pellets, then conduct the magazine training session again on the next day.\n\t\nPut one reward pellet on the food receptacle on the confederate\u2019s side to exclude the effect of the olfactory property of the pellet, which the confederate eats in the test phase (refer to section 3.7).\nPlace a subject rat on the runway of the subject\u2019s side, with the guillotine door closed.\nDeliver a reward pellet into the food receptacle 60 times using the pellet dispenser on a variable time 30-s schedule. Ensure that the subject rat eats all the delivered pellets.\nShaping for the lever-pull action\nNOTE: Figure 3 is a flowchart of the experiment.\n\t\nPut one reward pellet on the food receptacle on each subject\u2019s side and confederate\u2019s side. Do not place the confederate rat in shaping sessions.Place the subject rat on the runway of the subject\u2019s side with the guillotine door closed. Then train the rats to pull down the lever. Shape the lever-pull behavior gradually with following five reinforcement criteria (A-E): (A) Approach the slit. (B) Touch the grip bar to the rat\u2019s muzzle\u00a0or forelimbs, with the lever beforehand pulled down to the subject\u2019s side. (C) Touch the grip bar, with the lever inclined to the rat\u2019s side (at an angle of 60\u00b0\u221230\u00b0). (D) Grasp and pull down the bar to rat\u2019s side using the same condition as in criterion C. (E) Grasp and pull down the bar to rat\u2019s side with the lever standing upright.\nFinish daily sessions when 60 rewards are given, or 30 min has elapsed. When a rat completes criterion E 40 times in a session, the lever-pull shaping phase is finished on that day.\nNOTE: Almost all rats finish the daily shaping session within 20 min. Wistar rats need about 3 days to reach criterion E.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: A flowchart of the experimental procedure.

Do not place the confederate rat in the training sessions. Present the buzzer tone for 5 s, and then open the door. When the subject rat pulls down the lever, deliver a food pellet and pull the lever up using a gut tied to the lever.After rats pull down the lever for 10 times (first 3 days of the phase) or 6 times (last 3 days of the phase) and consume all reward pellets, close the door and move them to the start area by the experimenter\u2019s hand.\nAfter an inter-trial interval (ITI) of 20 s, repeat steps 3.5.1 and 3.5.2. Finish daily sessions when each rat has earned 60 pellets.\nNOTE: This training also aims to habituate rats to the buzzer tone and door opening because Wistar rats ordinarily show freezing behavior at first in response to door movement. A daily session for each rat requires about 15 min. Six days are needed for this training phase.\nTraining phase for the run-and-pull sequence\nConduct the same procedure in step 3.5.1.\nWhen rats pull down the lever one time and consume a reward pellet, close the door and move them to the start area by the experimenter\u2019s hand.\nAfter an ITI of 20 s, start the next trial (steps 3.6.1 and 3.6.2). Finish the daily session when each rat has earned 30 pellets.\nNOTE: A daily session for each rat requires about 20 min. About 10 days are needed for rats\u2019 scores to reach asymptote.\nTest phases\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Description of each test condition. In single phases, the subject rat performed the task solitarily. In the pair phases, place the confederate rat in the runway on the opposite side to the subject rat. A transparent wall in front of the partition precludes the confederate rat from accessing the lever. This figure has been modified from Sekiguchi and Hata12. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig04largev3.jpg]NOTE: Test phases include sessions in two conditions, single or pair (Figure 4). In the single condition, rats perform the task solitarily; that is, trials are identical to the session of the training for the run-and-pull sequence (section 3.6). In the pair condition, the confederate rat is present at the opposite side of the box. The confederate rat cannot access the lever because of the clear acrylic wall in front of the partition.\nConduct a single session that is identical to the sessions in the training phase for the run-and-pull sequence (section 3.6). Finish the daily session when each rat has earned 30 pellets. Put one reward pellet on the food receptacle on the confederate\u2019s side, especially during sessions in the single condition.\nIn pair sessions, give the confederate rat a reward pellet during the ITI of the subject rat in order to keep the confederate rat near the partition.\n4. Data Analysis\nIndex of performance accuracy\nRecord videos of rats\u2019 lever-pull movement using the video camera near the partition of the outside of the apparatus. After all sessions are completed, confirm the evaluation by frame-by-frame analysis of the video recordings using an adequate video playback software.\nEvaluate whether the rat\u2019s pulling movement of a trial was the first-hit or not by visual observation of the experimenter during the experiment.\nNOTE: The first-hit trial is defined as the trial in which rats could grasp and pull down the lever during their first attempt to the lever.\nCalculate first-hit rates for each subject as the proportion of \ufb01rst-hit trials to all trials in each session (for the run-and-pull training phase) or in each phase (for test phases) to use in the analysis.\nIndices of performance speedCalculate the time needed to complete a trial from the value of the switch of the pellet dispenser: the time needed to complete a trial = (the time when the switch is pressed) - (the time when the door is opened). Then divide the time needed for completion of a trial into three sections using values from the infrared sensors (Figure 5).\nNOTE: Start latency (Figure 5a) is defined as the time from the door opening to the arrival of the rat at the \ufb01rst sensor. Similarly, running time (Figure 5b) is the time from the arrival at the \ufb01rst sensor to the arrival at the second sensor. Lever-pull latency (Figure 5c) is the time from the arrival at the second sensor to the time point when the switch of the dispenser is pressed.\nUse only the durations from the \ufb01rst-hit trials for analysis. Calculate median values of each subject for each session (of the training sessions) and each phase (of the test phases) for analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60176/60176fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Measurement of the indices of performance speed.

For all studies mentioned in this manuscript, all procedures were performed according to the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen.\n1. Stimulation and Computer Setup Prior to Experiment\nStimulator setup\n\tNOTE: The stimulator used for this fMRI experiment is a specially designed magnetic resonance (MR)-compatible system equipped with an MR-safe inner filter box, an outer filter box, safety resistors, coupled cables, and MR-safe materials. Some instructions pertain specifically to the manufacturer's directions, and these may vary when using another stimulator, so take care to follow equipment instructions provided by the manufacturer that may constitute exceptions to this setup. Figure 1A shows the stimulator components used in this experimental setup.\n\t\nNavigate through the menu of the stimulator to program the desired experimental parameters (refer to user's manual for details). For example, for a stimulation frequency of 10 Hz, program 10 cycles for ramp-up/down time of 1 s, 300 sinusoidal cycles for 30 s of stimulation, current strength equal to 1,000 \u00b5A, and repetitive trigger mode, as conducted for our experiments unless otherwise noted. Save the program to load for each time the experiment is run thereafter.\nConnect the stimulus presentation computer trigger output to the stimulator using a BNC cable.Place a nonmagnetic, shielded local area network (LAN) cable through the radio frequency (RF) waveguide tube from the inside of the scanner room. To avoid resonant capacitive coupling, ensure that the cable is free from loops and placed along the wall of the room, leading to the rear of the magnet bore and along the right-side scanner bed railing inside the bore, leading to the position of the inner filter box (see Figure 1C and safety note in Step 2.4 regarding cable position). Secure the cable with tape placed intermittently along the length of it.\nLoad the visual stimulus program on a designated presentation computer that is separate from the scanner control computer. As depicted in Figure 1C, connect the presentation computer to the scanner trigger output via an optical-to-electrical converter and to an output device (i.e., projector) that is placed in a shielded case or outside the magnet room. Use nonmagnetic mirrors to direct the projection onto a screen inside the scanner bore.\n2. Subject Arrival and Preparation\nPre-screen recruited subjects for any contraindications for MR scanning (e.g., no metal implants, no claustrophobia, experiment-specific subject prerequisites) as well as for tACS (e.g., history of seizures, chronic headaches, pregnancy)26,27.\nWhen the subject arrives, instruct the subject about the fMRI experiment details and describe the experience to expect (e.g., visual stimulus, tingling or phosphenes from tACS, special task instructions).\nPlace electrodes according to the 10-20 EEG system and stimulator preparation.\nUsing a tape measure, measure the distance on the subject's head from the nasion to the inion, and from ear-to-ear, over the top of the head. The intersection of both lengths gives the position on the head for Cz, according to the 10-20 EEG system. Mark the spot for Cz on the scalp using a marker.Place an EEG cap without electrodes on the subject's head, with Cz aligned to the mark on the subject's scalp, determine the desired location of the electrodes and mark them.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that all experimenters use the same placement system to ensure consistency through all experiments; the 10-20 EEG system, which is commonly used in transcranial stimulation experiments, has specific guidelines to maintain accurate electrode placement26,28.\nUsing alcohol and cotton pads, clean the hair and skin on and around the marked spots on the subject's scalp; remove oils and hair products.\nSpread some gel on the rubber electrodes and press each electrode firmly on the marked and cleaned locations on the subject's scalp, ensuring full contact from electrode to conductive gel to the scalp with minimal impedance.\nUsing a spare shielded LAN cable, connect the filter boxes and MR-safe cables to the stimulator and to the rubber electrodes as depicted in Figure 1A.\nTurn on the stimulator and test the impedance (refer to user's manual for details). If the impedance is not below 20 k\u03a9, press the electrodes on the scalp or add electrode gel as necessary until this impedance guideline is met.\nWhen the impedance is below 20 k\u03a9, allow the stimulator to output current for a few seconds to familiarize the subject with the sensory experience. Ask the subject about sensory perception during this test, including whether tingling sensation exists and can be withstood, and extent or location of phosphenes during stimulation.\nAt this point, the subject is prepared to move to the scanner bed. Leaving the electrode cable plugged into the rubber electrodes on the subject, disconnect the stimulator, the spare LAN cable, and the outer and inner filter boxes.Connect the outer filter box to the LAN cable that runs through the waveguide to the MR scanner, leaving as little exposed LAN cable outside of the waveguide as possible (see Figure 1B). Connect the stimulator to the outer filter box using the stimulator cable and double-check that the stimulator is connected to the presentation computer trigger output.\nPrepare the subject inside the MR scanner.\n\tNOTE: Figure 1C shows the full tACS-fMRI setup during the experiment. It is critical to arrange the cables and inner filter box as specified, with the electrode cable arranged at an approximately 90\u00b0 angle to the plane of the scanner bed and the inner filter box resting on the scanner bed railing on the right side of the scanner bore. Neglecting to do so can damage the safety circuit of the electrode cable; this configuration applies for both open and closed RF coils.\n\t\nAfter ensuring that the subject is free of magnetic materials and ready for the MRI experiment, lead the subject into the scanner room.\nGive ear plugs for hearing protection to the subject, and instruct the subject to lie on the scanner bed, placing pillows around and under the head and under the legs for comfort and to reduce movement. When placing the pillows behind the subject's head, pay special attention to lay the electrode cable flat and in a position that is comfortable for the subject to lie on for the duration of the experiment.\nGive the alarm ball and MR-safe response button box to the subject to hold such that minimal movement is required to push a button to respond in the experiment.\nSecure the RF head coil over the subject's head with a mirror attached such that the subject can see the projection screen reflected in the correct orientation.Temporarily secure the free end of the electrode cable coming from the rubber electrodes to a place in the head coil such that it does not catch when the bed is moving. Figure 1D shows the subject's head positioned in the head coil with pillows, mirror, and tACS cable in place before moving the bed to the center head coil for imaging. The filter box is also shown placed on the scanner bed railing, as an example of where it must sit relative to the head coil when the scanner bed is in measurement position.\nMove the scanner bed into measurement position. From the back end of the scanner bore, connect the electrode cable from the rubber electrodes to the inner filter box that connects to the LAN cable, as depicted in Figure 1C. To prevent excess motion during scanning, secure the cables and filter box along the scanner bed railing to the right of the bore with tape and sand bags. Place projector screen into the rear end of the scanner bore.\nTest the impedance on the stimulator once more to ensure that all connections between cables, filter boxes, and the stimulator are made properly.\n3. MR Scanning and Experiment\nBefore the scan begins, test that the presentation computer registers when the subject pushes response buttons.\nAcquire high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical data (e.g., three-dimensional turbo fast low angle shot, echo time (TE): 3.26 ms, repetition time (TR): 2,250 ms, inversion time: 900 ms, flip angle 9\u00b0, isotropic resolution of 1 x 1 x 1 mm3).\nAfter the acquisition, adjust contrast and windowing on the anatomical MRI to low and high extremes to visually detect noise during scanning that may result from the stimulator setup. Continue this visual monitoring of noise concurrently with functional image acquisition.Start the experiment on the presentation computer, ready to begin with the scanner trigger, and start the stimulator to wait for the presentation computer output trigger. Leave the stimulator on and connected throughout the fMRI experiment to avoid differences in the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) between stimulator on and off conditions22.\nStart the fMRI scan (e.g., two-dimensional T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging; TE: 30 ms, TR: 2,000 ms, flip angle 70\u00b0, 33 slices of 3-mm thickness, no gap between slices at an in-plane resolution of 3 x 3 mm2, 210 volumes for seven minutes of scanning), which triggers the start of the experiment on the presentation computer. Monitor the stimulator display to guarantee that current is sent at desired times throughout the experimental runs.\n4. Experiment Conclusion\nAfter the experiment has run and scanning is finished, unplug the inner filter box from the cable connected to the rubber electrodes before moving the scanner bed, remove the subject from the scanner, and remove the electrodes, leaving the subject free to wash their hair.\nTurn off the stimulator, and plug it in to recharge. Clean the rubber electrodes with water for their next use.", "The three protocols described in this section require the use of rats as subjects. Most laboratory rat strains are suitable; for example, Wistar, Long-Evans, Sprague-Dawley, etc. The Ethics Committee of the Universidad Iberoamericana, following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council, 1996), approved the laboratory protocols to be described.\n1. Animal Housing and Preparation\nDetermine the number of rats that will be used. This will depend on several factors, such as the type of design selected, the statistical power desired/required, the costs of conducting the study, and the time available for conducting the study26.\nLabel each rat\u2019s tail with an indelible marker for identification purposes.\nHouse rats either individually or in groups (2-5) with water freely available.\nRestrict rats\u2019 food intake in order to motivate them for the protocols. In the case of individually housed rats, a convenient method for food restriction is to reduce weight to 85% of free-feeding weigh (use only for adult rats)27. Maintain this goal weight by providing supplementary food after conducting the protocol. For group-housed rats, give access to food for 60 min daily after conducting the protocol27.\nHouse the conditioning chambers within the sound and light attenuating shells.\n2. Preliminary Training\nNOTE: Before starting any of these behavioral protocols rats need to become accustomed to the conditioning chambers and food pellets. It is also vital to train the responses with which the animals would operate in the protocol. The three protocols presented here use appetitive motivation to induce behavior indicative of impulsiveness, like most other available alternative tasks (with select exceptions28). Conventional food dispensers are well suited to deliver both commercial refined grain and sugar pellets but can even handle \u201craw\u201d grain under certain circumstances29.\nHabituationAfter starting the food restriction regime, introduce the rats into the conditioning chambers without initiating any protocol for 30 min, in order to habituate exploring responses. Put 60 food pellets in the food receptacle at the beginning of the session in order to habituate food neophobia.\nRepeat daily until the rats consume all of the food pellets.\nMagazine training\nAfter the habituation stage, introduce the rats into the conditioning chambers for two additional 30 min daily sessions delivering a food pellet every 45 s. This helps the rats identify the source of food pellets.\nLever-press training\nUse this only for intertemporal choice and DRL protocols.\nProject one (for DRL) or the two levers (for intertemporal choice) into the chambers and start a continuous reinforcement procedure, that is, deliver a food pellet for every lever press. This procedure is used concurrently with a free food pellet delivery every 45 s (i.e., an alternative FR1-FT45 s schedule of reinforcement30), as in the previous stage. Sessions can have durations of 30 min.\nRepeat daily after the rats earn 80 rewards for two consecutive days.\nShaping by successive approximations\nUse this method in case the rats do not reach the criterion in four sessions.\nOpen the isolating shell of the conditioning chamber and observe the rats\u2019 behavior. Deliver a food pellet for every response that approximates the target response (i.e., lever pressing). Examples of these approximate responses are approaching, sniffing, or touching the lever.\nOnce the rats consistently perform the approximate responses, stop delivering rewards upon them and start requiring a response that is closer to the target response. Repeat as necessary.\n3. Programming Automated ProtocolsNOTE: The used values (e.g., delays, reward amounts, number of trials, session durations, schedules\u2019 values, time-out length, inter-trial interval span, threshold for forced trials, presence/absence of accompanying stimuli, stimuli durations) presented were arbitrarily selected. Readers may want to consult the literature for determining appropriate parameters and conditions for accomplishing their particular goals. Codes for conducting samples of the three protocols presented here in a MED-PC environment are provided in the repository that can be found in the following URL: https://github.com/SaavedraPablo/MED-PC-codes. Such codes can be freely downloaded and modified according to particular needs.\nIntertemporal choice\nSelect the values for delay and magnitude of reward. For example, choices for the SS alternative deliver one food pellet immediately and choices for the LL alternative deliver five food pellets after a 20 s fixed delay.\nSelect a finishing criterion. End sessions automatically after completion of some specified criterion. For example: end the session after 40 choice trials or after 50 min.\nCombine each alternative with a lever (left or right) within the conditioning chamber counterbalancing the laterality of the alternatives among subjects.\nProject both levers into the conditioning chambers and make alternatives SS and LL available upon the accomplishment of a variable interval schedule30. Once the first lever press after a certain interval has elapsed, this activates the associated alternative (delay included). Varying the duration of such an interval in a pseudo-random fashion prevents exclusive preference for a particular alternative.\nRetract both levers and activate the consequence associated with the SS or LL alternatives after accomplishment of a variable-interval schedule of reinforcement.Perform a time-out condition (signaled by a house-light blackout) after reward delivery. Adjust this duration of this condition to equate the average duration of inter-trial intervals for both alternatives. The next choice trial begins after the completion of the time-out. Figure 2 shows a diagram of events during two successive trials of an intertemporal choice procedure.\nImplement forced trials. If subjects select one alternative for two consecutive trials, the program will determine that the next trial will be a forced trial of the remaining alternative. That is, in the next trial both levers are available, but only one will operate. This ensures that the subjects experience the outcomes associated with both alternatives.\nFinish a daily session whenever a prespecified number of trials have been completed or whenever the maximum time has elapsed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59070/59070fig2.jpgFigure 2: Diagram of input and output events in two consecutive trials of an intertemporal choice procedure. Diagram of a prototypical intertemporal choice procedure, illustrating an SS alternative choice and an LL alternative choice, in two consecutive trials. Each row depicts the timeline of occurrence of particular output or input events. Spikes in the SS timeline represent choices of the smaller-sooner alternative (upon the accomplishment of the variable-interval schedule). Spikes in the LL timeline represent choices of the larger later alternative (idem). Asterisks in the Rw timeline represent reward deliveries. Elevated plateaus in the OR timeline represent periods of opportunity to respond (they are usually signaled, and its duration varies depending on the time that the individual takes to accomplish to the specified criterion); TO stands for the timeout that begins after reward delivery and ends with the next trial; during this period both levers are retracted. Note that timeout durations vary depending on the type of trial (SS choice or LL choice) in order to keep inter-trial intervals equated.

For example, 10 s.\nAfter the beginning of a session or after any lever-press response, start a countdown timer from the selected time value (e.g., 10 s) to zero. If subjects emit a response before the timer reaches the value of zero the timer resets, so that they must wait for a new opportunity to get a reward. If subjects emit a response after the timer reaches the value of zero, deliver a food pellet and reset the timer after 2 s (this allows the animal to consume the food). Figure 3 shows some possible responding patterns and their corresponding programmed consequences.NOTE: During the 2 s reward retrieving interval, responses are not counted, which may impact the proportion of burst responses in the rare cases when the rats eat the food quickly enough and happen to respond immediately afterwards or fail to detect the delivery of food. This could be ameliorated by using a cue signaling the 2 s reward retrieving interval31. However, previous research has shown that the amount of such responses is negligible even in the absence of signaling cues.\nFinish the session after a time and/or number of rewards criterion.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59070/59070fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Diagram of a hypothetical response pattern and its programmed consequences in a DRL 15 s procedure. Spikes in the R timeline represent the timeline of responses spontaneously emitted by the subject. Asterisks in the Rw timeline represent the timeline of reward deliveries. Numbers below the Cl row represent a clock counting down from 15 s the amount of time remaining before the next opportunity to respond and earning a reward. Note that reward delivery only occurs if a response is given since a minimum time of 15 s has elapsed from the last response.

For example, use 8 s durations for conditioned stimuli, variable 92 s inter-trial intervals and finishing criterion of 24 trials.Present pseudo-randomly two types of trials, A+ and AX-, at 50% of the times each; A and X represent stimulus types and plus and minus signs represent the presence or absence of food, respectively. A+ trials: turn on one of the focalized lights (stimulus A) for 8 s and then deliver two food pellets (+). AX- trials: turn on one of the focalized lights (either side) for 8 s and concurrently present a tone (stimulus X) but do not deliver food (-). Figure 4 shows a diagram of the programmed events for each type of trial.\nFinish the session after a time and/or number of trials criterion.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59070/59070fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Diagram of the types of trial used in the feature-negative discrimination procedure. Elevations in the A timeline represent onsets of the excitatory stimulus. Elevations in the X timeline represent onsets on the inhibitory stimulus. Asterisks in the food timeline represent food delivery. (A) A+ trials include the presentation of the excitatory stimulus followed by food delivery. (B) AX- trials include the presentation of the excitatory stimulus in compound with the inhibitory stimulus without food delivery. Recall that trials must be interspersed randomly and set apart by relatively long inter-trial intervals for better results.

Running the Protocols\nConduct the protocol daily, at a standard time, always placing rats in the same operant chamber.\nSet up the protocols in the computer software. Make sure to appropriately label the output file with the subjects\u2019 names, condition, and study.\nClean the inner walls, ceiling, and grill floor of the operant chambers with an ethanol or chlorine solutions, in order to remove odors from previous sessions or previous studies.Check that all the crucial inputs and outputs work appropriately by manually activating and monitoring them by means of the computer.\nCheck that the food dispenser holds enough food to deliver throughout the session.\nMove the housing cages with the rats inside close to the conditioning chambers.\nOpen the housing cage and gently carry each rat to its corresponding conditioning chamber, closing the conditioning chambers and the isolating shells.\nInitiate the program and wait until the program is finished. If data is not saved automatically, save the output files of the session in the computer drive or elsewhere.\nGently carry the rats back into their corresponding housing cages after the program is finished.\nGive complementary food to the rats according to the selected food restriction regime.\n5. Data Collection and Analysis\nNOTE: Codes for extracting and manipulating data from MED-PC output files (saved with the extension .txt) for each procedure are provided in the repository that can be found in the following URL: https://github.com/SaavedraPablo/MED-PC-to-R-codes.\nIntertemporal choice\nRecord lever presses in the SS alternative and in the LL alternative.\nDivide the SS alternative responses by the total responses to obtain the proportion of impulsive responses. Alternatively, divide the SS alternative responses by the LL alternative responses to calculate the ratio of impulsive responses. Take the common logarithm of ratio data points in order to remove skewness from the distribution.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59070/59070fig5v2.jpgFigure 5: Histogram of IRTs for one rat in a single session on the DRL 10 s protocol. The distribution is bimodal, with one of the peaks at very short IRTs (burst responses) and the other localized near the time criterion of the protocol (timed responses). Note as well that there is an accumulation of a small number of responses to the right and relatively far from the timed distribution (attentional lapses). Data was extracted from the 9th session in the DRL protocol of Rat 6 in a recent unpublished study. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59070/59070fig5v2large.jpg]\nDRL\nSet a counter variable in the program that increases with each unit of time from the beginning of the session.\nRecord the value of the counter variable in a list of values for each one of the responses as they occur during the session. This will provide a cumulative record of responses; that is, the exact time in which each response occurred during the session.\nGet the cumulative record of responses and subtract each value, i, from the previous value, i \u2013 1, in order to obtain the inter-response times (IRTs), which constitute the variable of interest.\nPlot a histogram of IRTs for one rat in one session with 1 s intervals in the X axis, in order to visually inspect the data. For a typical experienced subject, this should see as a bimodal distribution with a portion of the data amassed in the left and another portion of the data clustered near the selected temporal requirement of the DRL protocol. Figure 5 shows an example of typical performance in the DRL protocol for one rat in a single session.Classify types of IRTs. As stated above, the distribution of IRTs for a typical subject is bimodal. One possible interpretation of this shape is that it is composed of the mixture of (at least) two distributions reflecting separate processes32.\n\t\t\nClassify IERs indicating attentional lapses.\n\t\t\t\nToo long IRTs may be indicative of attentional lapses (i.e., periods on which rats were not engaged in the task)33. A useful practice for these means is to separate far-right outliers from the rest of the data32. For example, multiply the interquartile range of the rightward distribution by some arbitrary constant (e.g., 3) and add this number to the median of this distribution to determine a cutoff value that signals the boundary between attentional lapses and the rest of data32.\nClassify responses in either the leftward or the rightward distribution (once the outliers have been removed32).\n\t\t\t\nThe leftward distribution or burst responses distribution is constituted by too short IRTs, which are interpreted as indicative of hyperactivity34 or as a lack of attention and/or response feedback35. On the other hand, IRTs on the rightward distribution or timed responses distribution are considered as indicative of responding in adjustment to the temporal constriction of the protocol32. Either use an arbitrary cutoff to classify the boundaries of leftwards and rightwards distributions31 or use mathematical modeling to do so32,33,36.\nDetermine the parameters of the timed responses distribution.\n\t\t\t\nPay close attention to the rightward distribution in an experienced animal, which usually takes most of the IRTs and is considered as the most important part of the data set.Two parameters of interest are the localization of its peak and its spread. The former gives an index of the capacity to inhibit premature responses; shifts to the left of the time criterion may be interpreted as indicative of impulsivity37. The latter is indicative of temporal estimation; the narrower the distribution, the greater the timing accuracy32,40,43. Estimate these parameters through simple descriptive statistics or by more sophisticated mathematical modeling40,43,33.\nFor a useful guide to fitting DRL data to the theoretical distribution proposed by Sanabria and Killeen33, see the supplementary material provided by these authors.\nObtain a global efficiency measure.\n\t\t\t\nIf the finishing criterion of the session is temporal (i.e., session duration will be constant) divide the number of earned rewards by the number of responses emitted, for obtaining a measure of efficiency. If the finishing criterion is a specific number of rewards calculate reward rate, which is number of rewards divided by session duration. Note that these global measures say little about how animals are obtaining or losing the rewards in the protocol and must be used only as a rough guide.\nFeature-negative discrimination\nRecord the frequency or the duration of responses during A+ and AX- trials. The primary measure of conditioned responding may be the mean response frequency38, the mean response duration39, or the percentage of trials with at least one response.\nAfter choosing the preferred conditioned responding measure, subtract the value of responding during A+ trials minus responding during AX- trials for each subject in a particular session. This will constitute a negative index of impulsivity40; that is, the less the difference between both values, the greater the impulsivity.\nNOTE: The data from this task lend quite well to analyses based on measures from signal detection theory41,42, which can be used to supplement simple subtraction measures.Subscription Required.

The mice were given ad libitum access to food and water. All procedures to the mice were in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the animal protocol was approved by Baylor University Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were tested in the late morning/early afternoon. For all procedures below the investigator should wear gloves to eliminate odors and prevent contamination.\n1. Preparation of Non-social Odors\nPrepare fresh non-social odors each day of testing.\n\tNote: The investigator should use gloves to prepare the odors.\n\t\nFill 3 centrifuge tubes with 10 ml of water each.\nPipette 100 \u00b5l of banana extract into a 15 ml\u00a0conical tube and 100 \u00b5l\u00a0of almond extract into a second 15 ml\u00a0conical tube for a 1:100 dilution.\u00a0\n\t\tNote: The third 15 ml\u00a0tube will only contain water.\n2. Preparation of Social Odors\nPrepare fresh social odors on the morning testing will occur. Obtain social odors from two cages that have not been cleaned for at least three days and contain equal numbers of mice. Obtain social odors from mice of the same sex as the test subject.\n\tNote: These are to be stored at RT and should be used within 4-6 hr to maintain strong and consistent odor.\n\t\nDetermine how many social odor cotton swabs need\u00a0to be created: each mouse being tested will be presented with three swabs from social odor 1, and three from social odor 2.Prepare social odors by wiping a cotton swab in a zigzag fashion across the bottom of a dirty cage. Shake off any excess bedding clinging to the tip.\nStore swabs in large glass jars with lids or in beakers covered with parafilm. Designate one container for social odor 1 and a second for social odor 2.\nMaintain odor source cages outside of the experimental testing room.\n3. Acclimation of the Test Mouse\nPut on gloves and weigh the mouse to be tested and place individually in a clean cage with a wire lid on top and the water bottle removed.\nAllow the mouse to acclimate to the new cage for 45 min in a room other than the testing room. Ensure that there are no unusual odors or noises in the room.\nAs testing takes about 45 min, stagger the acclimation times by putting the next mouse to be tested into a clean cage to acclimate right before testing the current mouse.\n4. Preparation of the Testing Room\nPlace fresh cotton swabs, laboratory tape, the bottles containing social odor swabs, the tubes of non-social odors, a micropipette, two timers,\u00a0and a waste bottle with a lid in the testing room.\nEnsure that the testing room is reasonably free of odors, loud noises, and bright light. Do not wear scented colognes or lotions.\n\tNote: The observer should not be chewing gum or candy during the testing period and should try to limit their exposure to strong odor foods.\n5. Testing Procedure\nBring the acclimated mouse in its cage into the testing room and place the cage on the counter at a height that is comfortable for viewing while seated.Present each odor 3 times in a row for 2 min each time. Use the presentation order that can be found in Table 1.\n\t\nPipette 50 \u00b5l\u00a0of odorant in the scent to be tested on to the tip of the cotton swab and re-cap the odor source. Lift the wire top of the cage and insert the unscented, wooden end of the swab into the water bottle opening, pushing the length through from the underside of the wire to the top. Avoid touching the cotton tip to anything, including fingers, so that odor contamination is avoided.\nContinue to draw the swab through the water bottle opening until about 1 inch of the cotton end hangs down into the cage. Affix the wooden end of the swab to the side of the cage using lab tape.\n\t\tNote: Be careful not to let the lid fall back onto the cage, causing a loud noise that would disturb the test mouse.\nImmediately begin timing for 2 min. Use one timer to time the 2 min presentation. Record the cumulative time spent sniffing the odor during the 2 min trial. Count the animal\u2019s sniffing behavior using a separate stop watch. Active sniffing is defined when the animal\u2019s nose is oriented towards the cotton tip with its nose ~2 cm or closer to the tip.\nAfter the completion of each trial, raise the wire lid and remove the cotton swab by pulling it downwards through the underside of the lid (this avoids odor contamination by preventing the cotton tip from touching the wire). Seal the used swab in a 500 ml\u00a0waste bottle.Prepare and insert the next swab and begin timing. Allow approximately 1 min between each inter-trial interval. Continue until each scent has been presented three times in a row, for 2 min\u00a0each time.\nOnce the mouse has completed all trials, empty the waste bottle containing the used cotton swabs in a trash can outside of the test room. Return the mouse to its home cage.\n6. Analysis\nAnalyze data for each group per odor condition using two-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls or a similar post hoc test to determine significant habituation (less time sniffing successive same smells), and dishabitutation (more time sniffing a new smell).\nSubscription Required.

Rats are housed individually in custom cages 24 h prior baseline to allow for acclimation.\n1. Hindlimb unloading\nNOTE: The pelvic harness can be put on either anesthetized or awake animals. Here, the description of the protocol is given on anesthetized animals. Wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE) to handle animals.\nPlace the rat in an anesthesia box with 3.5% isoflurane and an oxygen flow of 2 L/min.\n\tNOTE: Proper anesthetization is confirmed when a firm pinch of the rear paw does not elicit a reaction.\nOnce the animal is fully anesthetized, place the rat on the bench with anesthetic gas coming from a nosecone with 2% isoflurane and an oxygen flow of 1.5 L/min.\nPlace the rat in a prone position and put the pelvic harness on in a rostro-caudal movement.\nGently bend the pelvic harness to provide a snug fit while being careful not squeeze the hindlimbs to prevent abrasions and discomfort.\nAttach the stainless steel chain with the swivel clasp to the top of the pelvic harness, where a hook is attached at the base of the tail.\nRemove the rat from anesthesia and place the animal in a custom cage with the chain extended at its maximum.\nOnce the rat is fully awake and mobile, shorten the chain using the top swivel clasp until the hind limbs can no longer reach the floor.\nObserve the animal for a few minutes to assess its comfort and make sure that at all times, both hind limbs remain completely unloaded.\n2. Partial weight bearingNOTE: This step can be realized in both awake and anesthetized animals.\nConvert the HLU suspension device into a PWB suspension by adding the triangle-shaped part composed of stainless steel chains and a back rod.\nAnesthetize the animal following the same procedures as detailed for the HLU (steps 1.1 and 1.2).\nPlace a tether jacket of the appropriate size on the forelimbs of the rat (M for rats of 400 g or lower, L for rats weighing above 400 g) and close it using the back bra extender.\nAttach one clasp of the triangle-shaped part to the hook located on the back bra extender and the opposite clasp on the hook located on the pelvic harness at the base of the tail.\nAllow the animal to recover from anesthesia in the cage. Once awake, verify that the suspension is equal on both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs by shortening the chain and modifying the location of the bottom swivel clasp if needed.\n\tNOTE: This step can also be realized using a force plate to confirm the equal loading on all limbs.\nPlace the rat on top of the scale to record the \u201cloaded\u201d body weight, i.e., the weight of the animal and the entire apparatus, without shortening the chain.\nShorten the chain until the scale displays 40% of the \u201cloaded\u201d body weight and record the achieved gravity level (expressed as the ratio between unloaded weight and loaded weight).\nObserve the animal to make sure that the unloaded weight is stable and that the rat is equally loaded on all limbs.\nRemove the entire apparatus from the scale using the rod and place the rat back in its cage.\n3. Assessment of hindlimb grip forceHold the rat with a traditional restraint by placing one hand underneath the forelimbs. Gently hold the tail with the second hand.\nApproach the grip bar with the rear paws and make sure that both paws are fully resting on the bar.\n\tNOTE: If the rat does not fully grip the bar or does not display any evidence of voluntary gripping, slightly release the restraint. If this is unsuccessful, return the rat to its cage and retry after a few minutes.\nGently pull the rat straight back until it releases its grip. Record the maximal force displayed on the transducer.\nWait approximately 30 s between measurements and repeat the test 3 times.\nCalculate the average of the three measurements for scoring, to account for fatigue.\n4. Recording of muscle wet mass\nPlace the rat in a CO2 euthanasia chamber. After waiting the appropriate time according to IACUC and AVMA guidelines, confirm euthanasia by a visual observation of a lack of breathing.\nPlace the rat on the dissection table in a prone position and remove the fur and skin by incising near the ankle using small dissection scissors. Use hands to pull the skin layer off.\nUsing small dissection scissors, gently break the muscle fascia and isolate the calcaneus tendon.\n\tNOTE: The calcaneus tendon is the attachment point of both the soleus and the gastrocnemius muscles.\nWhile holding the calcaneus tendon with a small pair of tweezers, use the dissection scissors to isolate the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles from the biceps femoris, located above.\nOnce isolated, cut the attachment point of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in the popliteal area.\nGently pull the soleus away from the gastrocnemius and detach them by cutting the calcaneus tendon.Place the rat in a supine position. Carefully remove the fascia and peel the tibialis anterior from the ankle in an upward movement.\nCut the tibialis anterior at its superior attachment point.\nRecord the exact wet mass of each excised muscle using a tared precision scale and a weighing boat.\nSubscription Required.

Materials\nFind a complete list of the materials used to implement the method in the Table of Materials. Use Figure 1 and seek expert advice to construct an inverted T-shaped table, observation cages, and cage dividers. Follow the safety indications for the use of sharp tools and potentially dangerous materials.\nMake an inverted T-shaped table by gluing two rail-like wooden bars (45 cm length, separated 0.6 cm from each other) onto the top and in the middle of a piece of wood (100 cm x 45 cm x 1.5 cm). Then, place a second piece of wood (50 cm x 45 cm x 0.6 cm) vertically between the rail-like bars. Ensure that this second piece of wood prevents the pair of rats on one side from seeing the other pair on the opposite side (Figure 1).\nUse glass and acrylic to create eight observation cages. Ensure that each cage (19 cm wide, 19 cm long, 10 cm high, 3 mm thick) has 24 equidistant holes (5 mm diameter) arranged in three rows in the middle of one of its sides. Make this side of acrylic (3 mm thick) and shorten the height of the opposite side by 0.7 cm to allow the rat to breathe.\n\t\nMake sure each observation cage has a sliding lid made of acrylic to prevent the rat from rearing and distracting itself during the 60 min observation period.\nMake four dividers out of acrylic (19 cm wide, 30 cm high, 3 mm thick). Drill 24 holes (5 mm diameter) that match those in the observation cages, each in one clear divider and one opaque divider.Prepare data sheets in advance to record the occurrence of yawns. Include, in the heading of each data sheet, the name of the observer, experimental condition (i.e., familiar or unfamiliar rats), relevant test situation (OC, VC, VOC, NVOC), the date, and initial and final times of the observation. Divide the rest of the data sheet into two columns, each with the number of the rat written in the upper part, to record the yawning behavior of the rats.\n2. Procedure\nHouse 144 male rats in groups of four in plastic cages (home cages) from weaning until they reach 2.5 months in age. Do not use female rats, because they tend to show greater variation in behavior due to hormonal cycles, which may be confused with the effects of the test situation. Make sure that the rats in each cage are not siblings.\n\tNOTE: It might be difficult to obtain all the rats together. In that case, create blocks of at least 8 familiar rats and 8 unfamiliar rats so that every test situation is represented once in each experimental condition30.\nTo identify the rats, mark them with symbolic numbers on the tails using a commercial marker. For example, represent the numbers 1 to 4 by combining dots and lines (e.g. ,one dot for number 1 and one line for number 4). Identify familiar and unfamiliar rats using different colors.\n\tNOTE: Handle the rats following safety directions provided by animal facility staff, and comply with recommendations concerning the correct use of laboratory animals at the institution where experiments will be performed.Randomly choose which home cages will house the group of familiar rats and which will house the unfamiliar group. For example, suppose there are 16 available rats living in four home cages: number the home cages 1 to 4, then use R (download it at\u00a0http://cran.r-project.org/) as follows [after the prompt (>)]:\n\t> sample(4,4)\n\t[1] 4 3 2 1\n\t\nGroup the familiar (or unfamiliar) rats in home cages 4 and 3, and group the unfamiliar (or familiar) rats in home cages 2 and 1. Make sure the animal facility staff maintains the identity of each cage and handles the rats in the same manner as all other rats in the animal facility.\nUse the R program again and randomly choose rats to form each pair in each experimental condition. Ensure that the rats in each pair of familiar rats originate from the same home cage, and ensure that the opposite is true for the pairs in the unfamiliar group. Randomly choose pairs of rats for each test situation in each experimental condition.\nPerform two test sessions per day with two of the eight possible test situations (four for each familiar and unfamiliar rats) per test session (i.e., 60 min observation period). Conduct the two test sessions consecutively within 3 h.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to conduct all test sessions (four pairs of rats per day) either in the morning or afternoon to avoid any confounding factors. Run a complete replicate (eight test situations) of the experiment over two consecutive days.\n\t\nMake sure to use the test situations in a random sequence for each replicate of the experiment. For example, use numbers 1 to 8 to identify each test situation, then use R as follows:\n\t\t>sample(8,8)\n\t\t[1] \u200b8 7 4 6 5 1 2 3Allocate test situations 8 and 7 to test session 1, test situations 4 and 6 to test session 2, and so on. Then, randomly choose the side of the inverted T-shaped table where each pair of rats (test situation) will be placed.\nRepeat the same procedure (steps 2.3 to 2.4.2) for a second replicate (i.e., block) of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: If the aim of the study is to test the effects of a social condition (i.e., two interacting rats) on yawning frequency, use one rat placed in an observation cage next to an empty observation cage as a control for each of the four test situations. Perform this experiment 2x for each test situation for a control group of eight rats.\nSet up the test session by transferring the first four rats from the animal facility to the observation room, where they will remain for 15 min to acclimate to the novel environment. Transport the rats in individual cages and keep them separated from each other during transportation and in the observation room.\n\tNOTE: Follow the safety directions for transporting animals provided by the animal facility staff and use the indicated clothes to work with animals in the laboratory. The rats will not have access to food and water while they are in the observation room.\nAfter the acclimatization period has passed, place the inverted T-shaped table on a larger rectangular table. Make sure there is a ceiling lamp that sufficiently lights the room when making observations.\nPut filter paper on the bottom of each observation cage and place the cages in pairs on each side of the inverted T-shaped table. Position the corresponding divider in between each pair of cages.NOTE: The filter paper makes it easier to clean the cages and provides a rough surface on which the rats can move without slipping.\nStrategically place two digital camcorders such that each records the yawning behavior of each pair of rats. Make sure the camcorders are safely fixed to tripods and correctly orientated to the observation cages. Connect the camcorders to a desktop computer to simultaneously monitor the behavior of the rats.\n\tNOTE: Store the digital information on flash drives to permanently archive the experimental sessions. Use flash drives with a high storage capacity.\nFollowing the acclimatization period, place the rats in the observation cages according to the allocation previously determined. Set the automatic focus of the camcorder and start the video recording simultaneously with a stopwatch. Stop the video recording at the end of the 60 min observation period.\n\tNOTE: While the experimenters may be outside of the room during the test session and observing remotely, it is recommended that one person is in the observation room (as far away as possible from the experimental setting) while monitoring the behavior of the rats to ensure that the test session proceeds without interruption.\nWhen the observation is over, return the rats to their home cages in the animal facility. Ask the animal facility staff to ensure that the rats have access to food and water again. Thoroughly clean the observation cages using a nontoxic detergent and prepare the experimental set-up to perform the second and final test sessions of the day.\n\tNOTE: Clean the wood to remove any scents left by the rats when placed in the observation cages, which could affect the behavior of the next pair of rats tested.Train one to two volunteers partially blind to the assigned treatments to identify and record yawning using an all-occurrence sampling method. Make sure the observers use the definition of yawning described in the introduction section.\nPlay back and project each video on a computer screen using any standard playback system. Ask the observer to view each video and observe and record yawning behavior using the previously prepared data sheets, then allow him/her to review the videos at slower speeds to enhance the ability to observe and measure yawning.\n\t\nAsk the observers to score yawning using a notation system similar to the following: use vertical lines with the minute written as a superscript to represent the occurrence of a yawn (e.g., |3 ||6 |9, indicating one yawn at minute 3, two yawns at minute 6, and one yawn at minute 9). Score yawning as a sequence (e.g.,1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 5.0, 5.8) to record it with greater precision (minutes rounded to one decimal place).\nAlternatively, directly input data from the videos into a computer using standard data collection programs. Make sure the observer is acquainted with such programs.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, allow the observer to view each video in more than one session. Ensure that one observer views all the videos corresponding to one block of experiments. If two different observers viewed these videos, there may be a risk that differences in their abilities to observe and record yawning will confound the effects of the test situations. It is important to score the intra-observer reliability between different observers on 10%-20% of the videos to ensure that yawning is annotated in the same way.\n3. Data processingTranscribe the temporal sequence of yawns in each rat from the data sheets to a spreadsheet. Ensure there is one column for each rat with a short heading (e.g., fr1.l and fr1.r to indicate the first pair of familiar rats on the left and right sides, respectively). Ensure that all columns are the same length by filling the empty cells with either 0\u00a0or NA (see below).\n\tNOTE: Use the general guide provided as a supplementary document[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59289/Supplemental_Material.zip] to fully understand the following steps to process the data, measure contagious yawning, and obtain contagious yawning curves.\n\t\nIf yawning was recorded to the nearest minute, type in the number of yawns at each relevant minute and use 0 (no yawn) to fill in the cells when no yawn occurred in a given minute. Save the worksheet as a text file (.txt).\nIf yawning was recorded to the nearest decimal of a minute, type in the sequence top down and use \"NA\" to fill in the empty spaces of columns (rats) in which the numbers of yawns (rows) is lower than that of the column with the maximum number (rows) of yawns recorded for a rat. Save the worksheet as a text file (.txt).\n\t\tNOTE: As R has the ability to work with empty cells, the worksheet can be saved with columns of different lengths. Use the help options provided by R to handle missing data.\nInitiate R. Import the data from the file in which they were previously located.\nSave the program codes with the extension \".R\" (provided as supplementary material[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59289/Supplemental_Material.zip]), then download the specific program code (see general guide) depending on whether yawns were recorded as integers or fractional numbers. Run the program for each pair of rats and desired number of time frames.Run the program again, now using a random distribution of the number of yawns from each rat (see general guide). Follow the same steps (steps 3.3 to 3.3.1) for all experimental conditions (i.e., familiar and unfamiliar rats) and/or all the test situations. Proceed as indicated in the general guide and export the results to Excel.\n\t\tNOTE: Instead of importing a previously saved program, as suggested above using a text editor, copy and directly paste the program into R's workspace.\nTo create yawn contagion curves, use the data previously saved in an spreadsheet. Subtract the non-contagion rates from the contagion rates for each pair of rats, time window, and test situation. Separate the analyses of the observed data and artificial (randomly distributed) data.\n\t\nNext, calculate confidence intervals (CI) for each time window and test situation using a bootstrap procedure (see the general guide). Separate the analyses for familiar and unfamiliar rats. Then, combine the artificial data from the four test situations for each experimental condition and calculate the CI for each time window using a bootstrap procedure.\nNext, create plots for each test situation and experimental condition (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). Finally, perform a multiple regression analysis to compare the intensity of yawn contagion between test situations (see below).\nSubscription Required.

Neurological severity score evaluation\nNOTE: The highest possible score for behavioral alterations and motor function is 24 points. A score of 0 represents intact neurological status, and a score of 24 represents severe neurological dysfunction21,22,23 (Table 1).\nEvaluate the neurological severity score (NSS) as previously described24 on the TBI and sham rats before surgery, at 48 h after surgery (Figure 2A), and on day 28 after surgery (Figure 2B).\n4. Studying the dominant- submissive behavior\nRandomly divide the rats into cages 1 week before the test.\n\tNOTE: Each cage should contain one sham-operated rat and one TBI rat.\nPerform one 15 min session every day for 2 days before testing so that rats can acclimate to the protocol.\n\tNOTE: The dominant-submissive task was initiated on day 29 after injury (Figure 1).Use an apparatus (see the Table of Materials) made from two transparent acrylic glass boxes (30 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm, Box A and Box B, Figure 3) connected by a slender 15 cm x 15 cm x 60 cm tunnel15,19,25.\nFill a feeder (Figure 3) with sweetened milk, and place it at the tunnel's center.

For bacterial quantification, we use 105 cfu/mL as initial inoculation dose. An inoculum of OD600\u00a0= 0.0001 or higher can be used for studying transcriptional responses, fluorescent marker line observation using confocal microscopy, or the observation of developmental responses.\nNote: R.\u00a0solanacearum undergoes spontaneous phenotypic conversions.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Pick pink bacterial colonies instead of the dark red colonies when grown on phi\u00a0+ TTC medium, since this colony color-related phenotypic conversion might correlate with changes in pathogenicity.

Kanamycin containing LB media is used to grow Agrobacterium cells harboring pCAMBIA1301 plasmid which contain the kanamycin resistant maker gene (nptII).Add 10\u00a0\u03bcL of Agrobacterium LBA4404 primary culture to 10\u00a0mL of LB media containing kanamycin.\nIncubate the mixture in an incubator shaker at 28\u00b0C for 12 h.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) of Agrobacterium LBA4404 culture at 600\u00a0nm using a spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Germany, Model: Biophotometer Plus).\nTransfer the culture to a sterile 50\u00a0mL centrifuge falcon tube (Tarsons, India Cat# 546041).\nCentrifuge it at 2600\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 10\u00b0C in a centrifuge (Eppendorf, Germany, Model# 5810R) to pellet the Agrobacterium cells.\nResuspend the pellet in fresh LB media to achieve an OD 0.3; this is equivalent to approximately 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 cells/mL.\nAlternatives: A full loop of Agrobacterium culture from a 4\u00b0C stored culture plate can be directly resuspended in fresh \u2018infiltration and co-cultivation medium\u2019 to achieve OD 0.3. In this case, there is no need for a 12\u201314\u00a0h grown culture, which is a time saver.\nThe imbibed seed piercing method (ISPM) of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT)\nTiming: 2\u00a0months\nThis major step describes Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in jute. Germinated jute seeds are used as explant. A tiny hole is made by piercing the seeds. This facilitates penetration of Agrobacterium cells into the seeds during the vacuum infiltration process. At the end of this step T0 plants will be developed and grow in the greenhouse.\nCritical: Perform the following step 25 to 33, step 35 to 42, and step 44 to 45 in a laminar air flow work bench to maintain aseptic conditions\nPierce imbibed jute seeds with a sterilized needle near the apical meristematic zone of the plumule (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2. Piercing of imbibed jute seeds\u2014Illustrates the technique of piercing imbibed jute seeds, a crucial step in the transformation protocol, related to step 25Critical: Needles must be flame sterilized and allowed to cool periodically before each piercing. Each seed can be pierced a maximum of two times without permanent damage.\nSoak the pierced seeds in the 'infiltration and co-cultivation medium'.\nCover the soaked seeds with aluminum foil and incubate for 30\u00a0min to 1\u00a0h in a laminar workbench at 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C temperature.\nNote: The 'infiltration and co-cultivation medium' contains Agrobacterium cells (OD 0.3), therefore gentle agitation is necessary during incubation to ensure the cells remain suspended and make contact with the pierced seeds.\nNote: Acetosyringone should be added to the 'infiltration and co-cultivation medium' before introducing the pierced seeds. To ensure proper mixing, pipette the medium 10\u201320 times.\nNote: The volume of media required depends on the number of seeds used. Typically, 25\u00a0mL is suitable for a 100\u00a0mm petri plate (Corning, USA Cat# BP94A-01), while 6\u00a0mL is sufficient for a 35\u00a0mm plate (Tarsons, India Cat# 460035-35MM).\nPut the petri plates, which contain pierced seeds submerged in medium, into a vacuum desiccator chamber, and vacuum infiltrate for 10\u00a0min at a pressure of 550\u00a0mm Hg (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3. Vacuum infiltration method of Agrobacterium transformation\u2014Provides a visual guide to the vacuum infiltration method used for introducing Agrobacterium into pierced jute seeds during the transformation process, related to step 28\n    \nNote: Ensure that the desiccator is properly cleansed with 70% ethanol and exposed to UV light for 30\u00a0min under laminar airflow before use.\nCritical: Vacuum infiltration should not exceed 20\u00a0min, to avoid the risk of tissue damage.\nPlace the inoculated seeds on sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper to remove excess Agrobacterium infiltrate.\nAlternatives: Sterile blotting paper can also be used in place of filter paperIncubate for 5\u00a0min to achieve a semi-dry state (until the excess liquid medium is removed from the seed surface).\nTransfer seeds to a 100\u00a0mm petri plate on Whatman No. 1 filter paper.\nSaturate the filter paper with 3\u00a0mL of co-cultivation medium.\nSeal the petri plate with Parafilm and cover with aluminum foil.\nIncubate at 28\u00b0C in the dark for 72\u00a0h for co-cultivation.\nNote: The co-cultivation medium here is the same as that in step 26, but without Agrobacterium cells.\nCritical: Ensure that the amount of media is neither excessive nor scarce. Excess media can lead to seed browning and death, while a shortage of media can cause seeds to dry out and die.\nAfter co-cultivation, transfer the seeds to a fresh 100\u00a0mm petri plate.\nWash the seeds four times for 5\u00a0min each, using only 'Agro-washing medium' without any antibiotic.\nNote: While sterile water can be used for this washing step, using media is recommended as it yields better results.\nSubmerge the seeds in 'Agro-washing medium' with timentin antibiotic (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# PCT1113-2G).\nAlternatives: 1 g/L cefotaxime (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# MB134) can be used as an alternative to timentin for this step.\nIncubate the seeds for 20\u00a0min.\nVacuum infiltrate the seeds for 5\u00a0min at a pressure of 550\u00a0mm Hg.\nCarefully remove the seeds from the antibiotic-containing medium and place them on sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper.\nIncubate the seeds for 45\u00a0min to ensure proper drying.\nTransfer the seeds into round screw-cap phyta jars (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# PW1125) containing hygromycin-B (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# PCT1503) in the 'selection medium'.Cultivate them for a duration of 14\u00a0days under controlled culture room conditions: a temperature of 27\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00b0C, a photoperiod of 16\u00a0h of light, and 8\u00a0h of darkness.\nAlternatives: Cultivation can be done in petri plates, but it is preferable to use transparent screw-cap bottles or phyta jars for this step, as plants may touch the lids and become bent in the petri plates.\nCritical: The sub-lethal selection concentration of hygromycin-B may vary depending on the cultivar used and should be optimized accordingly. Use 15\u00a0mg/L hygromycin-B for JRC212 seeds, and 18\u00a0mg/L hygromycin-B for JRO524 seeds.\nNote: The selection media should be freshly prepared, and hygromycin-B should be added after the autoclaved media cools down (around 45\u00b0C) but not solidifies.\nTransfer the surviving seedlings once more to the freshly prepared 'selection media' for an additional 14\u00a0days as a second round of selection.\nNote: These plants should continue to grow under the same conditions as step 43.\nCritical: It is recommended to transfer five or six plants to each magenta box (HiMedia Lab., India Cat# PW1138) during this step. This ensures that the plants have sufficient space and nutrients for optimal growth.\nTransfer the surviving seedlings once again, this time for a third round of selection in media containing hygromycin under the same conditions as step 43 for another 14\u00a0days.\nNote: Performing three rounds of selection significantly increases the chances of selecting the most transformed plants. However, if time is a concern, minimize the duration of the selection process by performing only up to the second round. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to conduct three rounds of selection, each lasting 12\u201314\u00a0days, as hygromycin-B effectiveness diminishes over longer periods, increasing the risk of selecting false-positive plants.Allow the plants to grow for 10\u00a0days in a medium that does not contain hygromycin-B.\nNote: This step is primarily to encourage root development.\nAlternatives: This step is optional and can be skipped if the plants have already developed a healthy root system during the selection process.\nClean the roots of the plants thoroughly using sterile water.\nPlant them in soil in the greenhouse to facilitate further growth and maturation.\nCritical: Take care when cleaning the roots to avoid any damage. Transferring plants to soil with media stuck to roots, increases the risk of fungal contamination.\nJute genomic DNA isolation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step highlights the process of genomic DNA isolation from greenhouse grown transgenic and control jute plants. This is a kit-based plant DNA isolation method but as alternative method of jute DNA isolation the Miniprep12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] method can also be used.\nCollect fully opened young leaves from each plant for genomic DNA isolation.\nWash the leaves twice with ddH2O and blot dry.\nUse a commercial plant DNA isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany Cat# 740770) and isolate genomic DNA by following the kit\u2019s instructions.\nNote: The kit\u2019s instructions (DNA isolation protocol) are available at the link[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/NucleoSpin%20Plant%20II%20Genomic%20DNA%20Purification%20User%20Manual%20%28PT5028/NucleoSpin%20Plant%20II%20Genomic%20DNA%20Purification%20User%20Manual%20%28PT5028-1%29_Rev_09.pdf].\nMeasure the concentration of isolated DNA using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA NanoDrop 2000C).\nPCR primer design\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nThis step highlights PCR primer design for hptII gene (hygromycin phosphotransferase) of pCAMBIA1301 using the online tool-PrimerQuest (free access). The accession number for the gene sequence to be downloaded is provided below. After this step the primer sequences are generated.\nDownload the sequence of the hygromycin-B-resistant hptII gene of pCAMBIA1301 using GenBank: AF234297 (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3188-Mmc1.extension]).\nUse the hptII gene sequence as the input for primer design in the PrimerQuest Tool, available at the link[href=https://sg.idtdna.com/pages/tools/primerquest?returnurl=%2FPrimerquest%2FHome%2FIndex].Run the tool using its default settings for the PCR primers.\nAlternatives: Primer3web (https://primer3.ut.ee[href=https://primer3.ut.ee/]) is another (free access) software for primer designing.\nSelect a primer set from the list of multiple suggestions provided in the PrimerQuest Tool.\nOrder the forward (5\u2032-GAAATTGCCGTCAACCAAGCTC-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-GCGAGAGCCTGACCTATTGCATC-3\u2032) primers for synthesis from IDT, USA.\nAlternatives: Primers can be ordered from any reliable service provider.\nScreening of hptII gene in transformed jute plants though PCR\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes the PCR conditions for the process of amplification of the hptII gene. This is a validation step for the transgenic integration of the hptII gene in the jute genome.\nIn a sterile 1.5\u00a0mL centrifuge tube, mix the following reagents. Thaw reagents on ice and keep reagents on ice until use.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3188_6.csv\nNote: Prepare a working stock of 100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL of plant genomic DNA to use as a sample in the PCR reaction mixture.\nNote: Mix all the components by repetitive pipetting and give a pulse spin before putting into the thermal cycler.\nDistribute 24\u00a0\u03bcL of PCR master mix into 0.2\u00a0mL PCR tubes.\nIn each PCR tube, add and mix by pipetting 1\u00a0\u03bcL of genomic DNA (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) from the tested plant.\nSet the program as follows in a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA Proflex PCR System) for 35 cycles.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3188_7.csv\nRun the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel using an electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad, USA Model: PowerPac Basic).\nDetermine the band size by comparing it with a 1 kb DNA ladder (Thermo Scientific, USA Cat# SM0311).\nIn the agarose gel, a 599\u00a0bp amplified product of the hptII gene should be visible.", "**PROTOCOL 1. Surgical exposure of the intact primary vein.**\nAn expanded leaf is selected and the apical part of the leaf placed on a block of agar \\(1% w/v). An arc-like incision is made through the upper \\(adaxial) and lateral epidermis of the petiole of the leaf 4 - 8 mm from the center of the rosette. No incision is made on the basal \\(abaxial) petiole surface. A second similar incision is made up to 4 mm from the first incision in the direction of the leaf tip. Then, perpendicular to the first incisions, a third cut through the adaxial \\(upper) epidermis is made to join the first incisions. In all cases, care is taken not to damage the vasculature. Then, using small forceps and a scalpel, extravascular tissues are gently removed from the region of the incisions. This leaves an exposed region of vein. These manipulations are summarized in **Fig. 1**. The procedure typically takes from 2 to 5 min to perform. \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7225/original/Fig_1_Vein_exposure_small.jpg?1538565425\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n**Figure 1.**\n**Exposing part of a midvein as described in protocol 1.**\n**a,** positions of cuts on the petiole of an expanded leaf. 1 and 2; superficial lateral incisions in the upper surface and sides of the petiole made to avoid severing the primary vein. 3, longitudinal superficial incision made prior to removing extravascular tissue. **b,** the leaf after removal of extravascular tissues. **c,** detail of an exposed vein, scale bar = 250 \u03bcm.  \n**PROTOCOL 2. Isolation of intact primary vein segments.**An expanded leaf is selected and the leaf blade is cut off with scissors just above the petiole/blade junction so as to leave a small length \\(a few mm) of leaf blade. The apical part of the leaf blade is then discarded. Using a scalpel, gentle incisions are made through upper \\(adaxial) and lateral epidermis near the base of the petiole. No incision is made on the underside of the petiole. Using a thumb and forefinger, the cut end near the petiole/lamina junction is gently pulled away to expose the midvein. The vein is then quickly excised for immediate use or for rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. The procedure, which takes approximately 10 s and works in approximately 50% of cases, is illustrated in **Fig. 2**.\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/7227/original/Fig_2_Leaf_petiole_vein_isolation_Small.jpg?1538565427\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n**Figure 2.**\n**Preparation of vein segments from expanded leaves as described in protocol 2.**\n**a,** positions of cuts on the petiole of an expanded leaf. 1, most of the lamina is removed with scissors. 2, superficial incision in the petiole, **b,** the leaf stub is gently pulled off the vein. **c,** the vein is cut off for use. **d,** remnants of the detached leaf, scale bar = 2 mm. **e,** extracted primary vein, scale bar = 2 mm. **f,** detail of an extracted vein, arrowheads show positions of secondary vein branch points; scale bar = 1 mm. \n**PROTOCOL 3. Extraction of living primary veins attached to the leaf base.**After experience has been gained using method 2 it is possible to adapt this method for the study of live, attached midveins. A ring-like incision is made through the upper \\(adaxial) and lateral epidermis of the petiole of the leaf 4 - 8 mm from the center of the rosette. No incision is made on the basal \\(abaxial) petiole surface. Using a thumb and forefinger, the leaf is gently pulled away from the center of the plant. This should leave an attached midvein up to approximately 3 cm-long depending on the size of the leaf. The procedure is outlined in **Fig. 3**. To prevent desiccation of the attached vasculature, a block of 1% \\(w/v) agar in 0.5 x Murashige Skoog \\(MS) medium \\(pH 5.7) is placed on the soil below the exposed vein.

Participants\nRecruit neurosurgical patients with intractable epilepsy who are undergoing placement of intracranial electrodes to localize their epileptic seizures.\nInsert depth electrodes with embedded microwires into all clinically indicated target locations, which typically include a subset of amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area. See details for implantation in our previous protocol2.\nOnce the patient returns to the epilepsy monitoring unit, connect the recording equipment for both macro- and micro- recordings. This includes carefully preparing a head-wrap that includes head stages (see our previous description for details2). Then, wait for the patient to recover from the surgery and conduct testing when the patient is fully awake (typically at least 36 to 48 h after surgery).\n2. Experimental setup\nConnect the stimulus computer to the electrophysiology system and eye tracker following the diagram in Figure 1.\nUse the remote non-invasive infrared eye tracking system (see Table of Materials). Place the eye tracking system on a robust mobile cart (Figure 1A, B). To the same cart, attach a flexible arm that holds an LCD display. Use the remote mode to track the patients head and eyes.\nPlace a fully charged uninterrupted power supply (UPS) on the eye tracking cart and connect all devices related to eye tracking (i.e., LCD in front of patient, eye tracker camera and light source, and eye tracker host computer) to the UPS rather than to an external power source.\nAdjust the distance between the patient and the LCD screen to 60-70 cm and adjust the angle of the LCD screen so that the surface of the screen is approximately parallel to the patient\u2019s face. Adjust the height of the screen relative to the patient\u2019s head such that the camera of the eye tracker is approximately at the height of the patient\u2019s nose.Provide the patient with the button box or keyboard. Verify that triggers (TTLs) and button press are recorded properly before starting the experiment.\n3. Single-neuron recording\nStart the acquisition software. First, visually inspect the broadband (0.1 Hz - 8\u00a0kHz) local field potentials and make sure they are not contaminated by line noise. Otherwise, follow standard procedures to remove noise (see Discussion).\nTo identify single neurons, band-pass filter the signal (300 Hz - 8 KHz). Select one of the eight microwires as a reference for each microwire bundle. Test different references and adjust the reference so that (1) the other 7 channels show clear neurons, and (2) the reference does not contain neurons. Set the input range to be \u00b1 2,000 \u00b5V.\nEnable saving the data as an NRD file (i.e., the broadband raw data file that will be used for subsequent off-line spike sorting) before recording data. Set the sampling rate to 32 kHz.\n4. Eye tracking\nStart the eye tracking software. Because it is a head-fixation free system, place the sticker on the patient\u2019s forehead so that the eye tracker can adjust for head movements.\nAdjust the distance and angle between the eye tracker and patient so that the target marker, head distance, pupil, and corneal reflection (CR) are marked as ready (as shown in green in the eye tracking software; Figure 2 shows a good example camera setup screen). Click on the eye to be recorded and set the sampling rate to 500 Hz.\nUse the auto-adjustment of pupil and CR threshold. For patients wearing glasses, adjust the position and/or angle of the illuminator and camera so that reflections from the glass will not interfere with pupil acquisition.Calibrate the eye tracker with the built-in 9-point grid method at the beginning of each block. Confirm that eye positions (shown as \u201c+\u201d) register nicely as a 9-point grid. Otherwise, redo calibration.\nAccept the calibration and do validation. Accept the validation if the maximal validation error is < 2\u00b0 and the average validation error is < 1\u00b0. Otherwise, redo validation.\nDo drift correction and proceed to the actual experiment.\n5. Task\nIn this visual search task, use the stimuli from our previous study14 and follow the task procedure as described before8.\nProvide task instructions to participants. Instruct the participants to find the target item in the search array and respond as soon as possible. Instruct the participants to press the left button of a response box (see Table of Materials) if they find the target and the right button if they think the target is absent. Explicitly instruct the participants that there will be target-present and target-absent trials.\nStart stimulus presentation software (see Table of Materials) and run the task: Present a target cue for 1 s and present the search array using the stimulus presentation software. Record button presses and provide trial-by-trial feedback (Correct, Incorrect, or Time Out) to participants.\n6. Data analysis\nBecause the acquisition and eye tracking systems run on different clocks, use the behavioral log file to find the alignment timestamp for electrophysiology recording and eye tracking. Match the triggers from electrophysiology recording and eye tracking before proceeding to further analysis. Extract segments of data according to timestamps and analysis windows separately for electrophysiology recording and eye tracking.\nUse the semi-automatic template matching algorithm Osort26 and follow the steps described before2,26 to identify putative single neurons. Assess the quality of the sorting before moving to further analysis2.To analyze eye movement data, first convert the EDF data from the eye tracker into ASCII format. Also, extract fixations and saccades. Then, import the ASCII file and save the following information into a MAT file: (1) time stamps, (2) eye coordinates (x,y), (3) pupil size, and (4) event time stamps. Parse the continuous recording into each trial.\nFollow previously described procedures to analyze the correlation between spikes and behavior8.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "This protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number CF16/1108 - 2016000590) in accordance with the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research24. Procedures were developed under the guidance of an accredited Medical Physicist, Nuclear Medicine Technologist, and clinical radiographer. Researchers should refer to their local experts and guidelines for the administration of ionizing radiation in humans.\n1. Required equipment and personnel\nSee the Table of Materials for the scanner room, radiochemistry lab, and general materials. A commercial supplier was used for the radiotracer.\nIn the simultaneous MRI-PET environment, use four personnel: a radiographer (RG) to run the scan, a nuclear medicine technologist (NMT) to oversee the administration of the radiotracer and acquisition of blood samples, a laboratory assistant (LA) to spin blood, and a research assistant (RA) responsible to oversee the experimental design and stimulus presentation.\n2. Preparation\nTracer dose preparation by the NMT\nCalculate the infusion volume that will be administered over the course of the scan. In this protocol, the rate of infusion is 0.01 mL/s over 95 min. So, in a 95 min scan, participants receive 0.01 mL/s x 60 s x 95 min = 57 mL.\nCalculate the tracer dose that will be diluted into the administered saline solution. In this protocol, a total dose of 260 MBq is administered to the participant over 95 min. This dose was chosen to limit radiation exposure to 4.9 mSv, to keep within the 'low level risk' categorization according to Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) guidelines for exposure of humans to ionizing radiation25. Decay correct 260 MBq from the mid-infusion point (47.5 min) back to T0. Using Equation 1, solve for A0\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60259/60259eq1.jpgWhere At is the radioactivity (MBq) at the mid-timepoint of the infusion, A0 is the initial radioactivity, and\u00a0\u03bb is the radioactive decay constant specific to the tracer. For FDG, the value of is\u00a0\u03bb \u2248 0.693/T1/2. T1/2 is the half-life of 18F (110 min).\n\t\tNOTE: In this example, At = 260 MBq, \u03bb = 0.693/110, and t = -47.5, so A0 = 350.942 MBq.\nCalculate the required radiotracer dose for the 100 mL saline bag that will be used to administer the dose to the participant. The required radiotracer for the saline bag is diluted up to a total volume of 5 mL and drawn up in a 5 mL syringe. Therefore, for the 100 mL saline bag, the dilution factor is the volume of saline (100 mL) in addition to the 5 mL volume of the syringe with radiotracer. This total volume of 105 mL is divided by the infusion volume of 57 mL (i.e., 105 mL/57 mL = 1.842). So, the total radioactivity in a volume of 5 mL required for addition to the 100 mL bag is A0 x the dilution factor (i.e., 350.942 MBq x 1.842 = 646.44 MBq). Aseptically add the radiotracer to the saline bag.NOTE: It is important to note that the calculated activity of 646.44 MBq that is added to the saline bag is the activity required at the commencement of the infusion. Generally, the doses for this protocol are prepared between 15 min to 1 h before administration. Therefore, it is important to factor in the decay of the radioisotope. Equation 1 in 2.1.2. can be used to account for this, where time (t) is the total number of minutes from the preparation of the dose to when the activity will be administered, At = 646.44 MBq, by solving for A0.\nPrepare the priming dose. Withdraw 20 mL from the bag into a syringe and cap it. Calibrate this 20 mL syringe and label. The syringe is calibrated as a reference check to ensure that the radioactivity has evenly dispersed within the saline bag.\nPrepare the dose. Using a 50 mL syringe, withdraw 60 mL from the bag and cap with a red Combi stopper. This syringe is not calibrated, as the concentration of the radioactivity is known from the time it was added to the saline bag (step 2.1.3). Store both syringes in the radiochemistry lab until ready to scan.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to draw a 60 mL volume in a 50 mL syringe, because Terumo syringes are marked to 20% above the labelled volume (i.e., a 50 mL syringe is marked to 60 mL).\nPrepare the reference dose. Fill a 500 mL volumetric flask with approximately 480 mL of distilled water. Draw up 10 MBq of 18F-FDG into a syringe, decay-corrected to the scan start time (using Equation 1) and add it to the flask. Top the volume up to the 500 mL mark with more distilled water and mix thoroughly. Affix labels pre- and post-calibration for the syringe.Scanner room preparation by the NMT\nOnce the participant is positioned in the scanner, there is very little room to manipulate or salvage the line for infusion or blood samples if blockage occurs. Prepare the scanner room to minimize the chance of line blockage.\nEnsure that all blood-collection equipment is within easy reach of the collection site. Place underpads at the end of the cannula and on any surface that will hold blood containers. Place bins for regular waste and biohazardous waste within easy reach of the blood collection site.\nInfusion pump preparation by the NMT\nSet up the infusion pump in the scanner room on the side that will be connected to the participant. Build lead bricks around the base of the pump and place the lead shield in front of the pump. Connect the tubing for the infusion pump that delivers the infusion to the participant and ensure the correct infusion rate has been entered. For this protocol, the rate is 0.01 mL/s.\nPrime the tubing before it is connected to the participant's cannula. Connect the 20 mL priming dose to the infusion pump. On the end of the tubing that will be connected to the participant, attach a three-way tap and an empty 20 mL syringe. Ensure that the tap is positioned to allow the 18F-FDG solution to flow from the priming dose through the tubing and collect only into the empty syringe.\nPreset the infusion pump to prime a volume of 15 mL. Select the Prime button on the pump and follow the prompts to prime the line.Attach the 50 mL dose syringe to the infusion pump in place of the priming dose. The 15 mL primed dose on the three-way tap can remain there until the participant is ready to be connected to the pump.\nParticipant preparation by the NMT, RA, and RG\nAdvise participants to fast for 6 h, and to consume only water (approximately two glasses), prior to the scan.\nHave the RA conduct the consent procedures and acquire additional measures (e.g., demographic surveys, cognitive batteries, etc.). Have the NMT and RG conduct the safety screens, the NMT review safety for PET scanning (e.g., exclusion for pregnancy, diabetes, chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the previous 8 weeks, and known allergies), and the RG review participant safety for MRI scanning (e.g., exclusion for pregnancy, medical or non-medical metallic implants, non-removable dental implants, claustrophobia).\nCannulate the participant.\n\t\t\nUse two cannulas: one for dose administration and the other for blood sampling. The most appropriate cannula varies across participants, but the most suitable vein should be reserved for blood collection. A 22 G cannula is the preferred minimum size. Collect a 10 mL baseline blood sample while cannulating. Disconnect all saline flushes under pressure to maintain patency of the line.\nTest the participant's blood sugar level and other baseline blood measures (e.g., hemoglobin) from the baseline sample.\nParticipant positioning in the scanner by the RG and NMT\nHave the RG position the participant in the scanner bore. For long scans, it is imperative to ensure comfort in order to reduce the risk of the participant dropping out and motion artefact due to discomfort. The participant should be covered with a disposable blanket to maintain a comfortable body temperature.Have the NMT flush the cannula to ensure it is patent with minimal resistance before connecting the infusion line. Once connected, the tubing can be lightly taped near the wrist. Instruct the participant to keep their arm straightened. Use supports such as foam or cushions for comfort. Have the NMT also check the cannula that will be used for plasma samples to ensure that it is able to withdraw blood with minimal resistance. It may be necessary to connect an extension tube primed with normal saline to make the cannula more accessible while the participant is in the scanner. If this is required, it should be checked for leakages.\nOnce the subject is in the scanner bore, have the NMT check that they have suitable access to both cannulas.\nHave the NMT notify the RG and RA if there are any issues with the blood collection cannula, infusion cannula, or the infusion pump (e.g., occlusion, battery, extravasation) at any time during the scan.\n3. Scan the participant\nStarting the scan with the NMT, RG, and RA\nAt the start of the scan, situate the NMT in the scanner room to monitor the infusion equipment. Ensure the NMT is wearing hearing protection and using the barrier shield to minimize radiation exposure from the dose where possible.\nAs the RG performs the localizer scan to ensure that the participant is in the correct position, check the details for the PET acquisition (e.g., scan duration, list-mode data collection, correct isotope).Design the protocol so that the PET acquisition will commence with the first MRI sequence. The RG prepares and starts the MRI sequence. The start time of the 95 min PET acquisition is time-locked to the start of the MRI sequence. If required, the NMT should deliver the bolus at the time of PET acquisition (Figure 1).\nStart the infusion pump. The RG should signal the NMT (e.g., via a thumbs-up sign) to start the pump 30 s after the start of the PET acquisition. This protocol starts the infusion pump 30 s after the scan start time to provide a safety buffer in case of scan failure. This also ensures that the first image taken during the PET scan indexes the brain prior to radiotracer administration for complete time activity curve data collection. Have the NMT observe the pump to ensure it has started to infuse the 18F-FDG and that there is no immediate occlusion of the line.\nHave the RA initiate any external stimulus at the agreed upon time (i.e., at the start of a functional run/experimental block) and calculate the times for blood samples. An example record form is shown in Supplement 1. Have the RA calculate the predicted time of each blood sample and provide copies to the NMT and lab assistant (LA). Have the RA ensure that the NMT takes the blood samples at approximately the correct time, and monitors equipment (e.g., infusion pump, stimulus) for any signs of errors.\nTake blood samples at regular time intervals\nHave the NMT and RA take one sample every 10 min. There are usually 10 samples in total, not including the baseline sample.\nIf acquiring MRI scans simultaneously with PET scans, have the NMT wear hearing protection when entering the scanner room.Have the NMT wear gloves and swab the tip of the cannula clean. While the cannula site dries, open a 5 mL and a 10 mL syringe, vacutainer, and a 10 mL saline flush.\nUsing the 5 mL syringe, withdraw 4-5 mL of fresh blood and discard the syringe in the biohazard waste.\nUsing the 10 mL syringe, withdraw up to 10 mL of blood. The volume may be limited by how easily the blood can be withdrawn. It is important to minimize any resistance subsequently causing damage to the red blood cells that can hemolyze. At the midcollection point, have the NMT signal to the RA, who will mark this time on the record form (Supplement 1) as the 'actual' time of sample.\nConnect the 10 mL syringe to the vacutainer and then deposit the blood into the relevant blood tube.\nQuickly flush the cannula with 10 mL of saline, disconnected under pressure, to minimize any chance of line clotting.\nImmediately take the blood sample to the radiochemistry lab for analysis.\nSpinning the blood by the LA\nHave the LA get all the equipment ready (Table 1) and be wear gloves. Have three racks set out for the samples: one for blood tubes, one for pipetting the sample, and one for filled pipetted samples (pre- and post-counting).\n\t\t\nHave the LA regularly change gloves throughout the procedure, especially when handling the counting tube. If the LA has any radioactive plasma contamination on their gloves, it can be transferred to the counting tube and spuriously increase the number of recorded counts of the sample.The blood sample can be placed in the centrifuge as the availability of staffing resources permits, because the time that the blood sample was taken, and the time it was counted was noted. Spin all samples at a relative centrifugal force of 724 x g. The centrifuge settings used for this protocol are 2,000 rpm for 5 min with the acceleration and deceleration curves set to eight.\nOnce the sample has been spun, place the tube in the pipetting rack. Remove the tube cap to not disturb sample separation. Place a labelled counting tube in the rack. The label should correspond to the blood tube.\nEnsure the tip is securely fastened to the pipette. Have a tissue ready for any drips. Steadily pipette 1,000 \u00b5L of plasma from the blood tube, transfer to the counting tube, and replace the lids on the counting tube and blood tube.\nPlace the counting tube into the well counter and count for 4 min. Record the counting start time on the record sheet ('measurement time') for every sample. This is required for subsequent corrections to the PET acquisition start time. At later time points during the scan, have the LA perform each step in rapid succession to avoid a backlog of samples.\nDispose of any blood product waste in biohazard bags.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "1. Escovopsis isolation\nIsolate Escovopsis strains from Acromyrmex echinatior laboratory colonies, by placing fungus garden fragments, with ants removed, on a Petri dish with moist cotton wool for several days until Escovopsis germinates and sporulates. Transfer spores to potato dextrose agar plates (PDA, 39 g/L) and incubate at ca. 23\u00b0C for approximately two weeks.\n\tNote: One strain was used in the current study.\nUse a sterile needle to pick out mature spores from these first plates. Pick enough spores to cover the tip of the needle.\nInoculate spores on new plates under sterile conditions and incubate at ~ 23 \u00b0C for approximately two weeks.\nWhen hyphae have covered the entire plate and grown into mature brown spores, repeat step 1.3 but this time with spores from the new PDA plate.\nRepeat the process until a clean stock of Escovopsis for each strain is acquired (no visible contaminants growing on or below the plate surface).\n2. Experimental set-up\nUse three A. echinatior colonies.\n\tNote: Here the colonies Ae160b, Ae322 and Ae263 were used.\nFrom each colony, make 12 sub-colonies. Make six sub-colonies for observation after 0 h and six sub-colonies for observation after 72 h. This gives a total of 36 sub-colonies; mark half of the sub-colonies from each \u2018parent\u2019 colony as control, and the other half as \u2018Escovopsis treatment\u2019.\n\tNote: While in parent\u00a0colonies the presence of a queen affects worker behavior, we expect (although this cannot be guaranteed), that queen-less sub-colonies are likely to behave as queenright colonies for the short period of time that the experiment runs.\nFor each sub-colony, use a square box of length: ~ 3.15 in (8 cm), width: ~ 2.17 in (5.5 cm) and depth ~ 1.77 in (4.5 cm).Note: The important point is to provide enough space for ants outside the fungus fragment to forage and dump waste, but at the same time to make the box small enough that filming and behavior recognition is feasible.\nFor each sub-colony, add a tea-spoon sized (approximately 2.2 cm3 and 1.2 g) piece of the central part of the fungus garden (L. gongylophorus) from the original colony, a couple of bramble leaves, and a piece of cotton wool soaked in water.\n\tNote: The cotton wool provides humidity. It should not be dripping with water, and should not touch the fungus garden.\nFor sub-colonies treated with Escovopsis, use an inoculation loop and fill the opening so it is just covered by Escovopsis spores. Inoculate the spores by gently tapping a small, localized part of the fungus garden ten to twenty times so that spores are not too clustered.\nFor sub-colonies used as controls, mimic the application of Escovopsis to the fungus garden with a sterile inoculation loop.\n\tNote: Although this was not done in the present experiment, the inoculation of a sterile powder (like graphite or talcum powder) can be done at this stage to differentiate between an infection with a pathogen and an inert agent.\nFor 72 h observations, leave half of the sub-colonies (both controls and infected) for 72 h after introduction of Escovopsis before adding ants or initiating video recording.\n\tNote: Waiting 72 h in the absence of ants makes it likely that Escovopsis spores will germinate (unpublished in vitro data); although this also increases the chance of other infections (for example, from a fungus already present in the fungus garden), this time period is preferable for this treatment to represent the early stage of an established infection.For 0 h observations, directly after step 2.6 and approximately 30 min before recording, add two brood, four minor workers and four major workers simultaneously from the parent colony to each box.\n\t\nUse two major workers from within the garden that are young with light pigment, with Actinobacteria covering most of the cuticle. Take the other two from outside the garden, with dark pigment and Actinobacteria only covering the laterocervical plates.\nFor 72 h observations, repeat 2.8 and 2.8.1 at 30 min before recording, i.e., 71.5 h after inoculation with Escovopsis.\n\tNote: Experimental sub-colonies are significantly smaller than established natural Acromyrmex colonies. This is necessary in order to accurately record behavior. While this may influence the frequency of some behaviors qualitatively, the composition of sub-colonies was chosen to reflect the mix of workers in natural colonies to more likely qualitatively reflect the behavioral interactions.\n3. Video recording and scoring behaviors\nUse a USB endoscope attached to a laptop (or equivalent) and provide sufficient light.\nFor each sub-colony, perform video recording for 4 h (starting at either 0 h or 72 h post-infection).\nAfter recording the 36 sub-colonies, review the total of 144 h of footage and score all behaviors of interest for all individuals in each sub-colony.\n\tNote: In the current experimental example, we had to exclude two sub-colonies (a control from colony Ae160b and a treatment sub-colony from colony Ae322) due to infection with fungi other than Escovopsis, reducing the total number of hours of observations to 136.\nEach time a behavior is observed, record it as 1 occurrence.\nNote: A behavior can be of short or long duration, but only score it as > 1 if it is interrupted by another behavior, or if the ant is passive for a period of time.\n4. BehaviorsNote: Behavioral definitions were made using a combination of descriptions from previous studies23,27,28,31,45 and personal observations. For a detailed illustration showcasing important morphological structures used in the protocol for recognition of behaviors, see Figure 1.\nSelf-grooming and antenna cleaning (Video 1)\n\t\nNotice if the ant stops leg movement to initiate self-grooming. Check that the antennae are pulled through the antenna cleaners on the front legs (Figure 1), a clamp-like structure located on the tibia-tarsus joint consisting of a notch facing a spur with different sized bristles and combs45,46.\nAfter cleaning the antenna, observe that the ant will clean the legs and the antenna cleaners, by pulling the legs through the mouthparts, removing particles and potential pathogens with the glossa (Figure 1).\n\t\tNote: Self-grooming can consist of cleaning the antenna and subsequently the antenna cleaners (Figure 1), but also using mouthparts to clean the legs. When an ant is cleaning its legs, it most often cleans all six legs in succession.\nFungus grooming (Video 2)\nNotice if the ant stops leg movements at a fixed point on the fungus garden. Observe that the antennae are motionless and parallel pointed towards the fungus so that the angle between the scape and funiculus (Figure 1) is approximately 45\u00b0, and the tip of the antennae are almost touching each other, close to the tips of the mandibles (Figure 1).\nNote that the upper (maxillae) and lower (labium) mouthparts are open, with the glossa (Figure 1) emerging to lick the fungus.\nAllogrooming (Video 3)\nObserve this behavior when one or more ants have approached another (recipient) ant or vice versa. During the behavior, the ants stop movement and stand closely together with physical contact. The grooming ant(s) may move slightly to cover a larger area of the recipient ant\u2019s body.Observe that the antennae of the actor(s) can be motionless and pointed towards a specific point of the receiving ant or moving and lightly tapping the receiver. The angle between the scape and the funiculus (Figure 1) is approximately 45\u00b0 depending on whether they are fixed on a specific point or tapping. The tips of the actor\u2019s antennae are usually close to each other and the tips of the mandibles (Figure 1).\nNote that the upper (maxillae) and lower (labium) mouthparts are open, with the glossa (Figure 1) emerging to lick the receiver ant.\nMetapleural gland grooming (Video 4)\n\t\nObserve when the ant stops movement to initiate metapleural gland (Figure 1) grooming. Note that the ant leans to one side to reach one of its front legs back to rub the opening (meatus) of the metapleural gland (for example, the right front leg).\n\t\tNote: The other front leg is simultaneously (in this example the left front leg) licked by the glossa (Figure 1).\nCheck that the ant leans to the opposite side and switches legs and repeats the same motion with the opposite legs. The ant continues to move the front legs to the metapleural glands and subsequently to the glossa constantly switching between legs (Figure 1).\n\t\tNote: In this example, the ant will now pass the left front leg to the metapleural gland and the right front leg to the glossa (Figure 1). After metapleural gland (Figure 1) grooming, the ant often initiates self-grooming (Step 4.1).\nSpore weeding (Video 5)Observe this behavior when the ant stops leg movements at a fixed point on the fungus garden. Observe that the antennae are motionless and parallel, pointed towards the fungus so that the angle between the scape and funiculus is approximately 45\u00b0, and the tips of the antennae are almost touching each other and the tips of the mandibles (Figure 1).\nCheck that the ant opens its mandibles (Figure 1) to grab visible Escovopsis spores and detach\u00a0them from the fungal crop by pulling them off. The ant carries the cluster of spores out of the nest, while the antennae are gently moving for orientation. The antennae may be cleaned through the antenna cleaners (Figure 1; see Video 1) while holding the cluster of spores. The ant drops the spores off in a waste pile.\n\t\tNote: Recording of activity around the waste pile was not done in the current experiment but would be a suitable extension of the current protocol.\nFungus weeding (Video 6)\nObserve this behavior when the ant stops leg movements at a fixed point of the fungus. The antennae are loosely pointed towards the part of the fungus the ant is attempting to remove, while slightly tapping the fungus piece.\nObserve that the ant uses its mandibles to either cut through the fungal crop to detach a specified area, or to grab a part of the fungus piece with its mandibles (Figure 1). The ant will simultaneously rock from side to side on its legs, while it pulls off the fungus piece.Note: Weeding can be done by multiple workers and by both minors and majors. If so, some ants do the fungus cutting, others carry out the rocking and pulling motion. The detached part of the fungus is carried outside the nest and dropped off in the waste pile. Recording of the waste deposit was not done in the current experiment but would be a suitable extension of the current protocol.\nFecal fluid grooming (Video 7)\nObserve this behavior when the ant stops leg movements at a fixed point on the fungus garden. The ant bends its gaster (Figure 1) and head towards each other to apply a droplet of fecal fluid to the mouthparts.\nObserve that the ant pulls the front legs through the mandibles (Figure 1), one at a time. Subsequently, the ant moves the antennae through the antenna cleaners (Figure 1) located on the tibia-tarsus joint of the front legs.\nDroplet regurgitation (Video 8)\nObserve this behavior when the ant stops leg movements at a fixed point of the fungus. The antennae are motionless and parallel, pointed towards the fungus so that the angle between the scape and funiculus is approximately 45\u00b0, and the tips of the antennae almost touch each other and the tips of the mandibles (Figure 1).\nObserve that the ant regurgitates a droplet of liquid on to the fungus, varying from being transparent to light yellow or even brown, from its mouthparts.", "Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from The Ohio State University for this study and all participants signed an informed consent form.\n1. Characterize the High Stress Work Environment\nMeet with the managers and staff employees of the high stress environment separately from each other to characterize the impact of personal stress on the work environment. Assess various perspectives on the nature and sources of stress experienced by personnel. Ask both managers and staff employees for thoughts on causes and ways to modulate stress within the given environment.\nUtilize all pre-existing quality improvement data concerning the nature of staff satisfaction, sick leave data, job turnover data etc. to determine level of personnel stress.\n2. Determine Appropriate Location/time/interest for MIM\nCommunicate the research background on mindfulness and the intent to obtain institutional support for staff coverage necessary for participation.\nPresent findings of personnel stress assessment during staff meeting, determining time/location that would best work for MIM to be least disruptive for work flow.\n3. Obtain institutional support for MIM\nWork with administrative staff to allocate funding for coverage of staff attending MIM. Determine process for staff manager to solicit and schedule staff coverage for participants. Reserve location onsite for MIM.\nObtain written consent from interested employees so they fully understand the research, commitment involved in the intervention and understand that they can withdraw at any time, for any reason.\nDecide upon the outcomes that would be clinically significant for the particular employees.\n\tNOTE: For example, employees of ICU personnel showed a desire to become more resilient in spite of the daily stressors that they face in their day to day job and remain engaged in their important work.\n4. Baseline Assessments \u2013 1 Week Prior to InterventionMeasure resilience using the 10-items version of the Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC)41 1 week before intervention to establish a baseline.\n\t\nAsk participants to rate each of the 10 statements from 0 - 4 (not true at all, to true nearly all the time) indicating how often the statement applies to them.\nTally the total score by summing scores from each of the 10 statements.\n\t\tNOTE: Resilience corresponds to the ability to maintain good functioning in face of stress or trauma. The 10-items version of the CD- RISC has been validated with good reliability (alpha value of 0.85) and validity to differentiate individuals functioning well after adversity from those who are not42.\nMeasure work engagement using the 9-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES)43 1 week before intervention to establish a baseline.\n\t\nAsk participants to rate each of the 9 statements from 0 - 6 (never to always) indicating how often the statement applies to them.\nTally the total score, as well as the 3 sub-scores for vigor, dedication and absorption.\n\t\tNOTE: Higher scores indicate higher work engagement. Internal consistency of the scale is demonstrated with a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.92 for the total score, 0.86 for vigor, 0.86 for dedication, and 0.79 for absorption subscales43.\n5. MIM\nFollow the same format during each 1 hr weekly session of the 8 week program.\nBegin each session by asking participants to count their respiration by placing their right hand on their chest and counting only inhales for 30 sec as timed by the instructor. Ask each participant to record their breath count on a log provided.\nPlay relaxing music in the background to set the climate for MIM.State that the intent of the didactic/experiential sessions is to encourage the explicitly defined objective of the program: resiliency building and stress reduction through mindful awareness of habitual patterns of stress reactivity.\nEach week, deliver a prompt for contemplation during the next hour and assure the participants that the response to the prompt is personal and silent. Invite the participants to choose to share responses, without any pressure to verbalize personal reflections. The prompts directly relate to each weekly theme. Ask the participants to reflect upon the following prompts:\n\ttable:\n\ufeff0,1\nWeek,Prompt\n1,What physical or cognitive habits did you catch yourself doing during the last week?\n2,\"What thoughts or worries keep you up at night? What thought, if you could put it out of your mind, would allow you to sleep better?\"\n3,What commonalities or differences do you see in your self-image versus how other people see you? What image of self allows you to breathe easier and deeper?\n4,Describe the most relaxed and satisfying meal you can remember. What factors made it so enjoyable?\n5,Are there any factors you can identify that were present during the times in your life when you felt balanced?\n6,What do you notice about the commonalities between the experiences you judge as \u201cpleasant?\u201d What about the experiences you judge as \u201cunpleasant?\u201d\n7,\"Is the \u201cthing/person/situation\u201d that is making you unhappy unchangeable? If so, how might you be able to change your reaction to it or experience of that \u201cthing/person/situation?\u201d\"\n8,Describe a time at work that you felt grounded and empowered.\nDeliver a 15 min Powerpoint presentation on topics including stress and work-related stress, theoretical material related to mindfulness, the somatic mind/body connection, relaxation, yoga, meditation, self-awareness, and bodily cues relating to emotional reactivity and the relation of these topics to the specific workplace stressors.Following the prompt, lead the participants through a mind body relaxation relating to the weekly prompts:\n\t\nWeek 1: Discuss what types of communication/relational patterns participants notice in life, and how there are also bodily patterns of which people are often unaware. Ask the participants to cross their arms over their chest, then, to cross their arms the opposite way and notice whether or not this feels uncomfortable, or unusual, as it is different than their typical habit of which arm is typically on top. Ask the participants to relax their feet, their legs, drop their weight into the chair, relax shoulders down, relax the muscles of the face. Mindfully relax all the muscles of their body.\nWeek 2: Ask the participants to settle into their chairs. Instruct the participants to close their eyes and begin a body scan, thereby tensing and relaxing each part of the body. Ask the participants to bring attention to their feet, legs, buttocks, stomach, chest, shoulders, lips, open and close the lower jaw, relaxing it.\nWeek 3: Ask the participants to become aware of their breathing by concentrating on the rise and fall of their chest. For just a few minutes, allow the mind-chatter to become quiet. Instruct the participants to tense each part of the body (the lower body, the torso, the neck and shoulders, the head) and then release the tension as each body part relaxes.Week 4: Pass out an orange and a small piece of dark chocolate. Instruct the participants to eat both of these with all five of their senses. For example, ensure that the participants hear the orange peel come off the orange, the wrapper off the chocolate. Direct the subjects to taste each of these 2 food items, smell each the orange and the chocolate, notice the difference and to notice the surface of the chocolate as opposed to the surface of the orange. Instruct the participants to take 3 min in silence to eat each of these 2 food items, noticing the experience, and the potential enhanced enjoyment of food, involved in mindful eating.\nWeek 5: Lead participants through yoga poses appropriate for the worksite, that can be performed without changing clothes or taking off one\u2019s shoes38 (balancing poses such as tree pose, eagle pose and chair pose). Ask the participants to notice the factors that are helpful to physically balance their body in these poses.\nWeek 6: Guide the participants through a self-massage as an example of a pleasurable break from stress. Instruct the participants to use all ten finger tips to begin massaging their head and scalp, moving down the back of the neck. Use the left hand to massage the right side of the neck, down the upper arm, to the elbow, ending at the palm of the hand and the fingers. Repeat using the right hand to massage the left side of the body.Week 7: Ask participants to bring to mind the list of stressful items present in life. Instruct the participants to stand up. From a standing position, ask the participants to shift their weight to the right foot to represent the factors(e.g., people, situations, etc.) in their lives that cannot be changed, while tipping their torso to the left to represent the factors that are stressful yet are in part amendable to change. Ask participants to recognize that we all have both unchangeable and modifiable features present in our lives. Then ask the participants to rotate their shoulders in circles, followed by arms and hands moving in circles, ending by shaking out hands and participants return to seated position.\nWeek 8: Display an image of a mountain for the group. Ask the participants to imagine themselves as a solid mountain, with all the situations in life circling around the mountain while the mountain stays still. Imagine the body as an unmovable mountain.\nEnd each session by asking each participant to count their respirations for 30 sec and record their individual end-of-weekly-session breath count in the log provided. Assign the homework for the next week as follows.\n\t\nWeek 1: Ask the participants to notice each day the habits displayed \u2013 mental, physical, reactive, interactive. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background to reinforce the habit of relaxing for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\nAsk the participants to notice what comes to mind when awake at night, or unable to fall asleep. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that encourages falling asleep for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.Week 3: Ask the participants to notice breathing patterns this week in correlation with emotional states, and how breathing differently can change the emotional reactivity to a situation. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that reinforces diaphragmatic breathing exercises that were practiced in the group session for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\nWeek 4: Ask the participants to notice where, when, and with whom meals are eaten, and the correlation with the enjoyment that is derived from eating food in a particular setting (for example in the car versus in one\u2019s dining room). Instruct them to practice mindful eating during one meal a day at least 5 days this week to reinforce the pleasure that can be derived from eating mindfully.\nWeek 5: Ask the participants to notice on a daily basis when the feeling of balance is elicited by various situations or people. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background and that includes balancing yoga poses included for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\nWeek 6: Ask the participants to notice pleasurable versus uncomfortable sensations that occur daily and what or whom these experiences may be correlated with. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that encourages pleasurable experiences 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.Week 7: Ask the participants to notice which situations may have an element that can be changed to make the situation itself less stressful. Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that encourages flexibility to reinforce the content presented in the group session for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\nWeek 8: Ask the participants to notice situations at work (frustrations, successes) that are comparable to passing conditions that will not move a solid mountain (the participant). Instruct them to listen to a CD that has relaxing music in the background that encourages staying grounded for 20 min a day at least 5 days this week.\n6. Evaluation of MIM Delivered Onsite\nOne week after the last session, ask the participants to rate the various component parts of the weekly sessions.

Cleaning entails the removal of adapter sequences and low-quality bases. This protocol is designed to be carried out using a public Galaxy account. Galaxy is an open-source, web-based platform that enables researchers without command-line programming experience to perform basic bioinformatic analyses (Giardine et\u00a0al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0010]). The utility of Galaxy lies with its graphical interface, which allows users to interact with their data, perform large-scale operations, and run standard programs, all without exposure to the underlying computational infrastructure.

There are 12 total files (2 conditions \u00d7 3 replicates \u00d7 2 sequence files). The .qual file contains a quality score (also known as a Phred or Q score) for each sequenced base. A Q score is an integer ranging from 0 to 42 that is inversely associated with the error probability of the sequenced base, meaning that a base with a higher Q score is more likely to be correct than one with a lower score. The .csfasta file contains the sequenced reads in color space fasta format, where each di-nucleotide (i.e., two consecutive nucleotides) is represented as one of four possible colors (blue=0, green=1, yellow=2, and red=3). This so-called 2-base encoding derives from the ligation-based SOLiD sequencing technology, which differs from the sequencing-by-synthesis method used by Illumina.\nAs an example, here is a single record (i.e., read) from one .csfasta file:\n         \n>135_886_1067_F3\nT32320113231210122000131330201030313\nThe name/identifier of the read is provided in the first line, following \u2018>\u2019; this one is designated 135_886_1067_F3 (with F3 indicating that these sequences are to be read in the forward direction, i.e., 5\u2032\u2192 3\u2032).

Set \u2018trim trailing F3 and R3?\u2019 to \u2018yes\u2019.\nNow, the read above is represented in fastqcssanger format as follows:\n         \n@135_886_1067\nT32320113231210122000131330201030313\n+\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@=@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nIn fastq format, each record consists of four lines.

The fourth line contains Q scores as before, but now they have been converted to corresponding ASCII (base 33) characters.\n3. Decode the sequence from color space to base space.\nUse the tool \u2018FASTQ Groomer\u2019 under the category \u2018NGS: QC and manipulation\u2019. For \u2018file to groom\u2019, select the fastqcssanger file generated from step 2. For \u2018input FASTQ quality scores type\u2019, select \u2018color space sanger\u2019.\nNow the read is represented in standard fastq sanger format:\n         \n@135_886_1067\nAGCTTGTAGCAGTTGAGGGGTACGCCTTGGCCGTA\n+\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@=@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Note that conversion from color space to base space was possible due to the known identity of the first base, i.e., the \u2018T\u2019 remaining from the primer sequence. With 2-base encoding, each color represents four possible di-nucleotides, so knowledge of the first base is essential for correct decoding. If you are working with SOLiD data that does not contain a known first base, then you must instead convert the reference sequence (i.e., genome or transcriptome) to color space for downstream alignments. However, since the SOLiD platform has been discontinued commercially since 2016, this option is not incorporated in all mapping tools, so be sure to select a mapper that includes this feature if required.\n4. Obtain an overview of library quality.\nRun the \u2018FastQC\u2019 tool under the category \u2018NGS: QC and manipulation\u2019. The file to be evaluated is the fastq output from step 3.\nFastQC evaluates multiple areas, including per-base quality scores, overrepresented sequences, duplicated sequences, adapter contamination, and kmer/GC content. Each test result is associated with a green check mark (normal), orange triangle (slightly abnormal), or red cross (very unusual). The assumption is that normal libraries are random and diverse; however, some experiments or library preparation methods create expected biases, so an abnormal or failed result is not always cause for concern. For example, RNA-seq libraries that have incorporated random priming will tend to fail the \u2018per base sequence content\u2019 check, since random priming has inherent sequence bias. However, this does not impede downstream analysis.\n5. Remove contaminating adapter sequences.\nSelect the \u2018Clip\u2019 tool from the category \u2018NGS: QC and manipulation\u2019. For input, select the fastq file output from step 3. Set \u2018minimum sequence length\u2019 to 18, \u2018custom clipping sequence\u2019 to CGCCTTGGCCGTACAGCAG, and both \u2018discard sequences with unknown bases\u2019 and \u2018output only clipped sequences\u2019 to \u2018yes\u2019.Due to adapter read-through, which occurs when a sequenced fragment is shorter than the defined read length of sequencing, a portion of raw reads will include contamination of the form 5\u2032-REALSEQUENCEADAPTER-3\u2032. This is solved by truncating reads at the first base of identified adapter sequence. If your RNA-seq data were obtained from a sequencing company, the company will provide you with the adapter associated with each library. If you are working with publicly available data, you may not have access to the adapter sequence. In this case, FastQC should have identified the adapter in the previous step, either as an \u2018overrepresented sequence\u2019 or a standard adapter.\nThe remaining parameters are set to filter out reads unlikely to be derived from bona fide miRNAs. Since most miRNAs are 21 nt, we set the minimum length after adapter clipping to 18 nt. Similarly, given our read length of 35 bp, any read derived from a true miRNA should contain adapter read-through; therefore, we output only sequences that were clipped. Non-clipped reads are likely derived from longer products of RNA degradation. Finally, discarding bases with unknown nucleotides is important for downstream miRNA and target prediction, both of which rely on sequence alignment.\n6. Remove low-quality bases from reads.\nSelect \u2018Trimmomatic\u2019 from the category \u2018NGS: QC and manipulation\u2019. Specify that the data are single-end reads and choose the adapter-trimmed fastq file produced from step 5 as input. Select \u2018sliding window trimming\u2019 as the operation to perform, with default parameters.As you may have observed from the per-base sequence quality plot in the FastQC report, Q values decline steadily toward the 3\u2032 end of reads; this is due to a reduced signal-to-noise ratio with increased amplification. Some programs resolve this issue by truncating the read at the first base below a specified quality threshold. Trimmomatic offers a more flexible \u2018sliding window\u2019 approach, truncating the read once the average Q value (over four bases) is reduced to 20.\n7. Apply a final length filter.\nUse the tool \u2018Filter FASTQ\u2019 from the category \u2018NGS: QC and manipulation\u2019. Set \u2018maximum length\u2019 to 28 nt.\nThis filter removes reads unlikely to be miRNAs.\n8. Convert the fastq file to fasta format.\nChoose the tool \u2018FASTQ to FASTA\u2019 from the category \u2018Convert Formats\u2019. For input, select the output fastq file from step 7. Set \u2018rename sequence names in output file\u2019 to \u2018no\u2019.\nThis is the processed file that will be used for downstream miRNA prediction. The conversion from fastq to fasta (i.e., removal of quality information) was made to conform with input requirements of downstream software.\nThe read that we were tracking above now looks like this:\n         \n>135_886_1067\nAGCTTGTAGCAGTTGAGGGGTA\nA comparison with the raw sequence reveals that the adapter was trimmed correctly.\nProcess the Illumina mRNA-seq data\n9. Upload the mRNA-seq data to Galaxy.\nSee the instructions provided in step 1.\nEach mRNA-seq sample has two paired fastq files, designated R1 or R2, indicating that they contain sequences in the forward or reverse-complement orientations, respectively. There are twelve mRNA-seq files (2 conditions \u00d7 3 replicates \u00d7 2 paired sequence files).\nA read from an R1 file looks like this:\n         \n@HWI-D00423:99:HB533ADXX:2:1213:12544:78916 1:N:0:CGATGT\nTTCCTGTAGGCTGGGAGATTGGAAAGGTACCATGCGATTAATGGGCTGGATGTCACTGGGGTCTCAAGTCCTCCAATGAATGGGTCTCCATTCAAGGGCTGGATTACTTGGTATGTTTGCTTATCAGATTGAATGGCCTTGATGGTAAAGG\n+\n@CBFFFFFHGHHHJJHIIJIJJIJJJJEFHIIJJJJIJJJIJIJJJJJJJJJJIJIIJJJJHHHHHHHFFFFFFEEEEEEEDDDCDDDDDDFFEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDACDDEEEDDDDDDDEEDCDDDDDDDDDDDDCDDDDEDDDDThis format is identical to that above for the small RNA reads in fastq format.

Run FastQC on each fastq file to obtain an overview of quality.\nThe \u2018FastQC\u2019 tool can be run as in step 4. Since the raw mRNA-seq reads are already in fastq format, no additional conversions are necessary.\n11. Remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases, and apply a minimum length filter.\nUse \u2018Trimmomatic\u2019 from step 6. Specify that the reads are paired-end and provide the R1 and R2 files. Choose \u2018yes\u2019 to \u2018perform initial ILLUMINACLIP step\u2019. Choose \u2018Truseq3 paired-end adapters\u2019 from the available adapter sequences. Add two additional options: \u2018sliding window trimming\u2019 as before and \u2018drop reads below a specified read length\u2019 (default is 20 nt).\nSince paired-end data are available, palindromic mode can be engaged in Trimmomatic for improved detection of partial adapter sequences, down to as little as one nucleotide. Another useful feature of Trimmomatic is that it maintains correspondence of paired-end reads; that is, if one member of the pair fails quality control, the other member of the pair is automatically discarded. Correspondence between paired-end files is often required for downstream software.\n12. Download and save the clean small RNA-seq and mRNA-seq files.\nAt this point, you should have 18 total files (6 small RNA-seq fasta files and 12 paired mRNA-seq fastq files). To check that all steps were performed correctly, compare your results with the clean files 1.sRNA_reads/2.clean and 2.mRNA_reads/2.clean (see Supporting Information).This protocol covers de novo transcript assembly and annotation using Trinity and Trinotate, respectively. We combine the clean mRNA-seq reads of all samples to produce a single reference transcriptome. From the assembled transcripts, the most likely open reading frames (ORFs) and their translated protein sequences are obtained using TransDecoder. The transcript and protein sequences are used in BLASTX and BLASTP homology searches, respectively, against the curated SwissProt protein database. Additionally, the protein sequences are searched for conserved Pfam protein domains. Using Trinotate, the search results are built into a comprehensive annotation report that provides insight into the function of each transcript. All input and output files available in the Supporting Information are indicated in the code boxes with green and red font, respectively.\nMaterials\nA computer or high-performance cluster running a UNIX-based operating system\nClean mRNA-seq dataset from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0001]: 2.mRNA_reads/2.clean\nSample information file: 3.trinity/samples.txt\nThe following programs will be run in the terminal through the command line.

The latter parameter means that for each pair, the R1 read will be reverse-complemented, while the R2 read will be processed as-is in the forward direction. Note that the relationship between read-pairs depends on the strategy employed during strand-specific library preparation.\nThe \u2018samples\u2019 file is a tab-delimited text file specifying the location of clean mRNA-seq reads and information about biological replicates for downstream analysis.

Also provided in the header is the transcript length (299 bases) and the path followed through the assembly graph for transcript construction.\nIdentify open reading frames2. Using TransDecoder, extract all ORFs from the assembled transcripts.\nTo do this, type the following command into the terminal:\n         \nTransDecoder.LongOrfs -t Trinity.fasta -S\nUnder default settings, TransDecoder will output ORFs of at least 100 amino acids. The -S flag specifies that transcripts are oriented in the sense direction, owing to strand-specific sequencing. Therefore, only the top strand will be examined.\n3. Use TransDecoder to predict the most likely ORFs.\n         \nTransDecoder.Predict -t Trinity.fasta\nThis step produces several outputs. Among them is a file containing protein sequences of the most likely ORFs, Trinity.fasta.transdecoder.pep.\nCreate an annotation report\n4.

Plant miRNA precursors tend to be longer and more structurally complex than those of animals; therefore, we use miRDeep-P for miRNA prediction since it adopts plant-specific scoring criteria. First, we process the clean small RNA reads to remove undesired species (rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA, snRNA), preventing their mis-annotation as miRNAs. From the filtered small RNA dataset, we prepare a collapsed small RNA fasta file required by miRDeep-P. miRNAs are then predicted as follows: (1) aligning small RNAs to the reference mRNA transcriptome; (2) extracting and folding the mRNA sequence surrounding aligned regions; (3) evaluating small RNAs within the folded structure, based on experimentally determined features of plant miRNA biogenesis. The \u2018evaluation\u2019 step comprises the core algorithm of miRDeep-P. Following prediction, the miRNAs are annotated based on sequence conservation with known plant miRNAs.

The output file miRNA_predictions contains sequence, alignment, and structure information for identified miRNAs and corresponding precursors. It also contains scores for each prediction. Top-scoring miRNAs have detectable \u2018star\u2019 reads and precursors that form stable hairpin structures. The star sequence is the passenger strand of the mature miRNA duplex; since it is often degraded, it is usually detected only for highly abundant miRNAs.\nOur sample dataset yielded only two predicted miRNAs. To ensure that there is enough information for downstream analyses, we provide predicted_miRNAs.fa. It contains sequences of the 582 predicted miRNAs obtained by running miRDeep-P on the full datasets in Neller et\u00a0al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0022]).\nAnnotate conserved and novel miRNAs\n6.

Conserved miRNAs tend to have high abundance; for example, a sequence annotated as miR156 has 162,157 counts. All remaining non-annotated miRNAs are considered novel.This protocol covers mRNA and miRNA differential expression analysis. We begin by quantifying mRNA transcript abundance. The clean RNA-seq reads are aligned back to the reference transcriptome using Bowtie2, then alignments are processed with RSEM to estimate the number of reads derived from each transcript. From these results, we generate a matrix containing the number of reads per transcript for each sample. This count matrix is used as input for differential expression testing with edgeR. miRNA differential expression analysis follows the same procedure, except that quantification with RSEM is not necessary (since one small RNA read = one miRNA). This protocol relies on wrapper scripts packaged with Trinity. Wrapper scripts are helpful for those with limited command-line experience, executing programs \u2018behind the scene\u2019 rather than requiring direct interaction from the user. Note that the programs must be installed correctly and be accessible from the user's $PATH in order to work successfully.

For each sample, the file RSEM.isoforms.results is produced; it contains the estimated number of reads derived from each transcript, as well as a normalized measure of transcript abundance (transcripts per million, TPM) that corrects for transcript length, the number of reads aligned to the transcript, and the total number of reads aligned to all transcripts per sample.\n2.

Inspecting the first few lines of this file, we see:\n         \ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n,sampleA,sampleB,logFC,logCPM,PValue,FDR\nTRINITY_DN1089_c0_g1_i1,J,E,5.19,15.29,1.21e-96,3.07e-93\nTRINITY_DN797_c0_g1_i1,J,E,5.37,15.03,1.64e-93,2.08e-90\nTRINITY_DN762_c0_g1_i1,J,E,10.81,14.22,5.55e-91,4.67e-88\nThe following information is provided in each column: transcript ID, sample A name, sample B name, log2 fold change of sample A counts/sample B counts, average log2 abundance in counts per million, uncorrected p-value, and false discovery rate (FDR).\nWhen conducting differential expression at the genome-wide level (i.e., performing a large number of statistical tests), it is important to consider the FDR value, which is a corrected p-value that takes into account multiple hypothesis testing. For example, if we apply a p-value threshold of 0.05, this means that 5% of all tests (i.e., 0.05 \u00d7 3000 transcripts) may be incorrectly detected as being differentially expressed. By contrast, an FDR threshold of 0.05 means that 5% of the significant tests (i.e., 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 3000) may be incorrectly identified as differentially expressed. Clearly, the FDR value is more stringent than the p-value.\n4. Using the normalized expression matrix from step 2, extract and cluster the differentially expressed transcripts.\nUse the Trinity wrapper script analyze_diff_expr.pl. This script must be executed from within the edgeR output directory produced in the previous step.\n         \n$TRINITY_HOME/Analysis/DifferentialExpression/analyze_diff_expr.pl --matrix RSEM.isoform.TMM.EXPR.matrix -P 0.05 -C 0 --samples samples.txtHere, we specify that we wish to extract transcripts having an FDR-corrected p-value (-P) cut-off of 0.05. We do not apply a log2 fold change cut-off (-C 0). This step produces several outputs, among which is a clustered heatmap of expression for the 56 identified transcripts meeting these criteria. Note that when working with a full-scale dataset, the user should specify more stringent cut-offs (e.g., -P 0.001 and -C 2, which is 22 or 4-fold change).\nIdentify differentially expressed miRNAs\n5. Conduct differential expression testing with edgeR, as shown in step 3.\nUse the provided file miRNA.counts.matrix, which contains counts of the 582 predicted miRNAs from Neller et\u00a0al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0022]).\n         \n$TRINITY_HOME/Analysis/DifferentialExpression/run_DE_analysis.pl --matrix miRNA.counts.matrix --method edgeR --contrasts contrasts.txt\nNote that we do not perform an initial alignment to quantify miRNA abundance as in step 1. This step is not necessary because small RNA-seq captures the miRNA in its entirety (i.e., 1 read = 1 miRNA). The same is not true for mRNA-seq because the transcripts were fragmented during library preparation.\nIf readers are using this protocol with their own data, they may need to create the miRNA count matrix. We suggest doing this in Galaxy by counting the number of identical reads in each sample, then joining the independent count tables into a single table. The Galaxy tools \u2018Group\u2019 (invoking the \u2018Count\u2019 operation) and \u2018Column Join\u2019 can be used.\nFrom the output file miRNA.counts.matrix.J_vs_E.edgeR.DE_results, 145 miRNAs are identified as differentially expressed using an FDR cut-off of 0.05. Note that if the reader wishes to create a heatmap of miRNA expression (as in step 4), the counts matrix must be normalized in units of counts (CPM) per million.In this protocol, we use the plant small RNA analysis server (psRNAtarget) to predict miRNA/target pairs from the subset of differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs identified in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0004]. We also create a \u2018background\u2019 set for downstream functional enrichment analysis, composed of predicted interactions between all miRNAs and mRNAs. psRNAtarget evaluates sequence complementarity between miRNAs and potential targets using a scoring system benchmarked against experimentally validated plant miRNA/target pairs.

These sequences were extracted from predicted_miRNAs.fa and Trinity.fa. Readers can prepare analogous files for their own data using the seqtk_subseq tool in Galaxy.In this example, 89 miRNA/target interactions were predicted, comprising 43 unique targets. This means that some mRNAs were predicted to be targeted by more than one miRNA. For the purpose of this example, we did not apply any filters on these predictions. Readers may wish to lower the Expectation cut-off (e.g., from 5 to 3) to identify the highest-confidence predictions when working with their own full-scale dataset.\n3.

GO terms are structured, curated concepts relating to gene functions. A gene product may be annotated in up to three categories: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. The ontology is structured as a directed graph in which each term has defined relationships to one or more other terms. Lower-level terms have greater specificity than higher-level ones. In this protocol, we use GOseq to identify functional associations that are over-represented among the differentially expressed miRNA/target pairs. GOseq also corrects for transcript length bias: the fact that longer transcripts are more likely to be identified as differentially expressed than shorter transcripts. Note that GO terms are only ascribed to proteins; therefore, this analysis is conducted on targets of miRNAs, not the miRNAs themselves.

Results are ordered from most to least significantly enriched, with both the p-value and FDR value provided.From our sample data, 32 GO terms are significantly enriched (p < 0.05), but none are enriched at the FDR cut-off (FDR < 0.05). Since we are working on a relatively small example dataset, the FDR value may be too stringently applied here. Nevertheless, inspecting the top few enriched GO terms in the list provides insight into the biological relevance of interactions among differentially expressed miRNA/target pairs: NADPH activity; toxin activity; carbonate dehydratase activity; coenzyme A metabolic process; nucleoside bisphosphate metabolic process; ribonucleoside bisphosphate metabolic process; purine nucleoside bisphosphate metabolic process; defense response. Since JA is known to mediate plant defense against pathogens, we may wish to investigate targets annotated with the GO term \u2018defense response\u2019. The enrichment results file reveals that five targets in the test set are annotated with this term. We can look up their IDs in the Trinotate report to obtain their top BLAST-annotated hits, if available, for which four of five are: Antiviral protein 1; Antiviral protein 2; 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1-like; Polygalacturonase inhibitor. Having identified some interesting miRNA/target interactions, the next step is to validate them.In this protocol, we cover the validation of an miRNA/target pair using RNA ligase\u2013mediated 5\u2032 RACE (RLM-RACE; Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0005]). Specifically, the 5\u2032 end of the expected cleaved target is cloned and sequenced to assess whether it underwent slicing by a miRNA-guided Argonaute protein. This method takes advantage of the exposed 5\u2032 monophosphate on the target that results from miRNA-induced cleavage. First, the poly(A) mRNA pool (from the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0008]) undergoes 5\u2032 ligation with an RNA adapter. Then, the mRNA pool is reverse transcribed into cDNA using a 3\u2032 d(T) adapter. To enrich for low-abundance cleavage products, the cDNA pool is subjected to nonspecific PCR amplification using primers annealing to the RNA adapter and 3\u2032 d(T) adapter. Finally, the specific target is amplified using a 5\u2032 adapter primer and 3\u2032 gene-specific primer. Sequences to facilitate cloning into a vector using Gibson assembly are introduced by a subsequent PCR of the specific target. The cloned target is transformed into E. coli, with successful transformants identified by colony PCR, and plasmid DNA is sequenced. An miRNA/target pair is considered validated if, after alignment, the 5\u2032 end of the cloned sequences lines up with the expected miRNA cut site on the mRNA.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/967e9c9a-f3be-409b-b655-0eb79882c8e7/cppb20090-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nOverview of miRNA cleavage detection by modified RLM-RACE. miRNAs that induce cleavage leave exposed 5\u2032 phosphates on their target mRNAs. This allows ligation of an RNA adapter, followed by nonspecific PCR amplification with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 adapter primers (5\u2032AP, 3\u2032AP) and gene-specific amplification with 5\u2032 nested adapter primers (5\u2032 NAP) and gene-specific primers (GSP1, GSP2). PCR products of the expected size are cloned, sequenced, and aligned to the target mRNA sequence. Sequences that align between the 10th and 11th nucleotide of the miRNA binding site indicate successful validation.While kits for RLM-RACE are available, they contain reagents not relevant here, which select for full-length, capped mRNAs. Therefore, we did not purchase any kit, though our protocol is based on the GeneRacer RLM-RACE kit (ThermoFisher L1500-01). The RNA adapter and all primers were synthesized separately, and decapping and dephosphorylating steps were omitted.\nMaterials\nPoly(A) mRNA pool (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0008])\nPrimers (and RNA adapters) in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-tbl-0001]\n10\u00d7 T4 RNA ligase buffer (NEB B0216L)\n10 mM ATP (NEB P0756S)\n40\u00a0U/\u00b5l\u00a0murine RNase inhibitor (NEB M0314S)\n10 U/\u00b5l T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB M0204S)\nDOW Corning High Vacuum Grease, autoclaved in 5-ml syringe without needle\nAcid PCI: 25:24:1 (v/v/v) citrate-buffered phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol [25 ml citrate-buffered phenol (Sigma P4682), 24 ml chloroform, 1 ml isoamyl alcohol]\nPrecipitation mix: 50 ml of ethanol, 2 ml of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2\n5 mg/ml linear acrylamide (ThermoFisher AM9520)\n10 mM dNTPs (NEB N0446S)\n5\u00d7 first-strand buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-rec-0001])\n0.1 M DTT\n200 U/\u00b5l Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher 18080093)\nRNase H (NEB M0297S)\n5\u00d7 Q5 polymerase reaction buffer (NEB B9027S)\n2 U/\u00b5l\u00a0\u00a0Q5 DNA polymerase (NEB M0491S)\nEZ-10 Spin Column Plasmid DNA Miniprep Kit (BioBasic BS413)\nEZ-10 Spin Column DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Biobasic BS353)\nCloning vector (pHSG298; Takara 3298)\n2\u00d7 Gibson assembly mastermix (NEB E2611S)\n5-\u03b1 competent E. coli (NEB C2987I)\nLB plates with appropriate antibiotic for cloning vector\n2 U/\u00b5l pfu-sso7d or equivalent polymerase\n5\u00d7 pfu-sso7d buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-rec-0002])\nThermal cycler with gradient function\nUV spectrometer\n0.2-ml PCR tubes\nSanger sequencing facility\nAdditional reagents and equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis (Voytas, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0032])\nTable 1.\n                Primers for RLM-RACE\ntable:\n\ufeffPrimer name,Sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032),Usage\nRNA Adapter,CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACUGAAGGAGUAGAAA,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 1\"\n3\u2032 d(T) Adapter,GCTGTCAACGATACGCTACGTAACGGCATGACAGTG-d(T)24,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 6\"\n3\u2032 Adapter Primer (3\u2032AP),GCTGTCAACGATACGCTACGTAACG,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 11\"5\u2032 Adapter Primer (5\u2032AP),CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 11, 13\"\nGene Specific Primer 1 (GSP1),\u2026XXXXXXXX\u2026,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 13\"\n5\u2032 Nested Adapter Primer (5\u2032NAP),GGACACTGACATGGACTGAAGGAGTA,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 17\"\nGene Specific Primer 2 (GSP2),\u2026XXXXXXXX\u2026,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 16\"\n5\u2032 Cloning Nested Adapter Primer,\u2026NNNNNNNN-GGACACTGACATGGACTGAAGGAGTA,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 20\"\nCloning Gene Specific Primer 2,\u2026NNNNNNNN-XXXXXXXX\u2026,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 20\"\nT7 Promoter Primer,TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 26\"\nT7 Terminator Primer,GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG,\"Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007], step 26\"\na N's indicate nucleotides added to the primer to facilitate Gibson assembly, and will share \u223c15 to 30 bp of sequence complementarity with the cloning vector. X's indicate sequence complementarity with the mRNA under validation.\nLigate the 5\u2032 RNA adapter to the mRNA pool\n1. Combine 250 ng of poly(A) mRNA and 250 ng of RNA adapter (sequence provided in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-tbl-0001]) in a total volume of 7 \u00b5l. Incubate at 65\u00b0C for 5 min to denature. Chill on ice for 2 min.\nThe GeneRacer manual suggests using 100 to 250 ng of poly(A) mRNA as input. We recommend beginning with at least 250 ng due to losses from multiple precipitation steps.\n2. Add the following reagents to the denatured mRNA:\n         \n1 \u00b5l 10\u00d7 T4 RNA ligase buffer\n1 \u00b5l 10 mM ATP\n1 \u00b5l 40 U/\u00b5l murine RNase inhibitor\n0.5 \u00b5l 10 U/\u00b5l T4 RNA ligase 1\n0.5 \u00b5l distilled H2O.\n3. Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr to ligate, then place on ice.\n4. Into a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, dispense 50 \u00b5l of autoclaved high vacuum grease using a syringe. Microcentrifuge for 30 sec at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C, to collect grease at the bottom of the tube. Add the ligated mRNA, 90 \u00b5l distilled H2O, and 100 \u00b5l of acid PCI. Vortex for 30 sec, then microcentrifuge 5 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C.The vacuum grease provides a physical barrier between the organic phase (containing phenol, chloroform, and protein) and the aqueous phase (containing RNA). This increases RNA yield and purity.\n5. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5-ml tube. Add 2.6 volumes of precipitation mix and 4 \u00b5l of 5 mg/ml linear acrylamide. Precipitate on dry ice for 10 min or at \u221220\u00b0C overnight.\nA precipitant is recommended due to the low concentration of RNA; we use linear acrylamide here. Derived from a synthetic source, it is a superior alternative to glycogen or salmon sperm DNA, which can introduce foreign nucleic acids into the reaction.\nCentrifuge the ligated mRNA 20 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Discard the supernatant and add 1 ml of 75% ethanol. Invert the tube several times, then centrifuge at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C for an additional minute. Pour off the supernatant, quick-spin once more with the same conditions, and pipette off the remaining supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 11 \u00b5l distilled H2O.\nReverse transcribe the ligated mRNA pool\n6. Add the following reagents to the mRNA:\n         \n1 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M 3\u2032 d(T) adapter\n1 \u00b5l 10 mM dNTPs.\n7. Denature the mRNA at 65\u00b0C for 10 min. Place on ice for at least 2 min.

Incubate at 50\u00b0C for 1 hr to reverse transcribe the mRNA into cDNA.\n9. Incubate at 70\u00b0C for 15 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase.\n10. Add 2 U of RNase H to the reverse transcription reaction and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 20 min.\nStore cDNA at \u221220\u00b0C until needed.\nAmplify the cDNA pool11. Using 1 \u00b5l of reverse transcription product as template, set up the following reaction to perform nonspecific PCR amplification of the cDNA pool:\n         \n5 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 Q5 polymerase buffer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M 5\u2032 adapter primer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M 3\u2032 adapter primer\n0.5 \u00b5l 10 mM dNTPs\n1 \u00b5l reverse transcription product as template\n0.25 \u00b5l 2 U/\u00b5l Q5 DNA polymerase\n15.75 \u00b5l distilled H2O.\n12.

The number of cycles is indicated, along with respective temperature (\u00b0C) and duration (seconds).\nAmplify the specific cDNA target\n13. Using 1 \u00b5l of nonspecific PCR product as template, set up the following reaction for the first gene-specific amplification:\n         \n5 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 Q5 polymerase buffer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M 5\u2032 adapter primer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M gene specific primer 1\n0.5 \u00b5l 10 mM dNTPs\n1 \u00b5l nonspecific PCR product as template\n0.25 \u00b5l 2 U/\u00b5l Q5 DNA polymerase\n15.75 \u00b5l distilled H2O.\nTo validate different mRNA targets simultaneously, multiple reactions may be prepared, each containing a target-specific reverse primer.\n14. Place into a thermal cycler and amplify as shown in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0006]B.\nA gradient thermocycler is not essential, but its use can save significant time on PCR optimization.\n15. Separate 8 \u00b5l of gene-specific PCR product on a 1.2% agarose gel, then visualize.Agarose gel electrophoresis is described in Voytas (2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0032]). A smear, multiple bands, or lack of visible product may be seen at this stage, depending on abundance of cleaved target and primer specificity.\nTo determine the anticipated product size, take into account the length of the 5\u2032 forward adapter primer and distance between the cleavage site and gene-specific reverse primer.\nIf a discrete band of the expected size is present, proceed directly to step 19 for gel purification. Otherwise, continue with step 16 for nested PCR.\n16. Dilute the gene-specific PCR product 1:10 with distilled H2O and use 1 \u00b5l as template in the following reaction to perform nested PCR. Use the program in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0006]B.\n         \n5 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 Q5 polymerase buffer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M 5\u2032 nested adapter primer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M gene specific primer 2\n0.5 \u00b5l 10 mM dNTPs\n1 \u00b5l diluted gene-specific PCR product\n0.25 \u00b5l 2 U/\u00b5l Q5 DNA polymerase\n15.75 \u00b5l distilled H2O.\n17. Separate the PCR product on a gel as in step 15.\n18. If a single band is observed at the expected size, dilute the reaction 1:10 with distilled H2O and proceed to amplification, step 21, for cloning. If multiple bands are observed, separate the remainder of the PCR reaction on a 1% low-melt agarose gel (Voytas, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0032]) and excise the band corresponding to the expected product size.\nConsider using a nucleic acid binding dye that emits green light under blue light excitation (e.g., SYBR Green, Midori Green) to reduce exposure of DNA to UV light that is used to visualize classic ethidium bromide staining.\n19. Purify the gel fragment with the EZ-10 Spin Column DNA Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol, then quantify with a UV spectrometer.To maximize recovery of gel-purified DNA, run the melted gel fragment through the silica column twice, elute twice. each time with 50 \u00b5l elution buffer, then concentrate with a vacuum concentrator to a final volume of 20 \u00b5l.\nClone the amplified cDNA target using Gibson assembly\n20. Use 1 \u00b5l of diluted PCR product from step 18 or 1 ng of purified fragment from step 19, and set up the following reaction. Use the PCR program in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0006]B:\n         \n5 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 Q5 polymerase buffer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M 5\u2032 cloning nested adapter primer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M cloning gene specific primer 2\n0.5 \u00b5l 10 mM dNTPs\n1 \u00b5l diluted PCR or gel-extracted product (from step 18 or 19)\n0.25 \u00b5l 2 U/\u00b5l Q5 DNA polymerase\n15.75 \u00b5l distilled H2O.\nA separate PCR reaction enables addition of overhangs for Gibson assembly, using the cloning primers in step 21.\n21. Gel purify (steps 18 and 19) the resultant PCR product of the expected size and quantify with a UV spectrometer.\n22. Combine the cloning vector pHSG298 and insert (i.e., the purified product from step 21) at a 1:2 molar ratio. Also perform a 1:0 reaction as a negative control. Perform Gibson assembly according to manufacturer's protocol.\nIdeally, use 50 fmol of vector and 100 fmol of insert, although attempts with 20 fmol vector have been successful. Inserts of less than 250 bp may require a vector to insert ratio of 1:5.\n23. Transform 1 to 5 \u00b5l of Gibson assembly product into 50 \u00b5l of competent NEB 5-\u03b1 E. coli, per manufacturer's instructions. Plate onto LB plates with appropriate antibiotics and incubate at 37\u00b0C overnight.\nScreen transformants using colony PCR24. Select a 1-mm-diameter colony from the experimental plate and resuspend in 50 \u00b5l distilled H2O. Spot 1 \u00b5l of the suspension onto an antibiotic patch plate to preserve the clone.\nA patch plate is prepared by drawing a grid on the bottom of a petri dish containing medium and antibiotic, and labelling each region to identify the spotted suspension.\nWe recommend screening 10 clones per target.\n25. Lyse the resuspended E. coli by incubating at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. Centrifuge 10 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, to pellet cell debris. Transfer 10 \u00b5l of supernatant to a fresh 0.2-ml PCR tube.\nA white pellet can be seen if enough E. coli has been lysed for a successful colony PCR.\n26. Set up the following reaction to perform colony PCR. Use primers that flank the cloning site in your vector, typically the T7 promotor and terminator.\n         \n5 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 pfu-sso7d buffer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 mM T7 promotor primer\n1.25 \u00b5l 10 mM T7 terminator primer\n0.5 \u00b5l 10 mM dNTPs\n10 \u00b5l bacterial lysate (from step 26)\n0.25 \u00b5l 2 U/\u00b5l pfu-sso7d polymerase\n15.75 \u00b5l distilled H2O.\nSince many colonies are screened and the template DNA is generally of low complexity, we use a more economical polymerase here rather than a high-end enzyme like Q5.\nAmplify with the PCR program illustrated in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0006]B, using 58\u00b0C rather than the gradient annealing step.\n27. Separate colony PCR products on a 1% agarose gel, then visualize. For colonies containing the appropriately sized insert, grow liquid cultures using the patch plate from step 24. Extract plasmid DNA from these cultures using a BioBasic EZ-10 Spin Column Plasmid DNA Miniprep Kit and send to a facility for Sanger sequencing with a forward and reverse primer flanking the cloning site.Agarose gel electrophoresis is described in Voytas (2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0032]). We recommend sequencing 5 to 10 clones per target.\nAnalyze the alignments\n28. Upon obtaining the sequences, align them to the target mRNA sequence using software. We recommend the online tool Benchling (http://www.benchling.com[href=http://www.benchling.com]).\n         \nCreate an account and log on to Benchling. In the tool bar on the left, select the \u2018Projects\u2019 tab. Click on the (+) icon to import your mRNA sequence.\nIn the tool bar on the right, click on \u2018Alignments\u2019 and select \u2018Create New Alignment\u2019. Input the sequences of your individual clones as well as the sequence of the putative miRNA. Choose MAFFT as your alignment algorithm. Click \u2018Create Alignment\u2019 and view your results. If your positive control is miR156 with target SPL, the alignment of your colony sequences should resemble Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0007].\nmiRNAs induce cleavage between the 10th and 11th nucleotides, 5\u2032 to 3\u2032, of the miRNA. 5\u2032 ends of cloned sequences that align to this site indicate successful validation of cleavage for the miRNA/target pair.\nCleavage at unexpected sites suggests that the miRNA is not cleaving the target as anticipated, or that this small RNA is not a functional miRNA (i.e., false positive). In some cases, we observed randomly distributed cleavage surrounding the expected site. This suggested that the limit of detection had been reached: background levels of mRNA degradation were as high as the miRNA cleavage. Thus, it is difficult to obtain trustworthy, reproducible results with RLM-RACE when abundance of the miRNA and/or target is low (e.g., < 10 counts per million and < 100 transcripts per million respectively).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/96b194c3-ea15-4927-847b-4e1899b7806a/cppb20090-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7Validation of SPL mRNA cleavage by miR156. The RLM-RACE protocol was performed for the positive control miRNA/target pair, miR156/SPL. The miR156 sequence was reverse-complemented by the MAAFT aligner for easy visualization of miRNA and target alignment. Sequences of five individual clones of cleaved SPL mRNA are shown, with 4/5 indicating the expected cleavage site.In this protocol, we cover total RNA extraction from plant tissue and steps to enrich for either small RNA or mRNA. RNAzol reagent is used to enable extraction of both total RNA and small RNA from a single plant sample. Total RNA is obtained first. Plant tissue is ground in liquid nitrogen, followed by addition of RNAzol; DNA and protein contaminants are removed through centrifugation, then total RNA is precipitated with ethanol. Using the supernatant reserved from total RNA extraction, the small RNA fraction is then obtained by isopropanol precipitation. mRNA enrichment is performed using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module on the previously extracted total RNA. Starting with high-quality RNA is critical for the success of downstream validations. Specifically, total RNA, small RNA, and mRNA will be used for qRT-PCR and stem-loop qRT-PCR (Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009]), and RLM-RACE (Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007]), respectively. Small-RNA enrichment serves to concentrate low-abundance miRNAs to enable their detection. Similarly, mRNA enrichment concentrates low-abundance targets; it also removes non-polyadenylated transcripts and ribosomal RNA so they will not be cloned inadvertently during RLM-RACE.\nMaterials\nFresh leaf tissue of interest\nRNAzol reagent (Molecular Research Center RN190)\n100% and 75% (v/v) ethanol\nRNA storage buffer [1 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.4 (see recipe) containing 22.5 mM DTT]\n100% isopropanol\nNEBNext Poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module (NEB E7490S)\nExtract total RNA\n1. Grind 100 mg of fresh leaf tissue to a fine powder with liquid nitrogen in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 ml RNAzol directly to the tissue and immediately vortex to homogenize.\n2. Add 0.4 ml distilled H2O to the RNAzol and vortex briefly. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.3. Microcentrifuge the lysate 15 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, to pellet DNA and protein. Carefully remove 1 ml of the supernatant (75%) and transfer it to a clean 1.5-ml tube.\nThe pellet tends to expand quickly; work with small batches of 4 to 8 tubes at a time while centrifuging the remainder.\n4. Add 0.4 ml 100% ethanol to the tube and place on ice for 10 min. Microcentrifuge 20 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C, to pellet total RNA. Transfer supernatant to a fresh tube and keep on ice for step 7.\nThe pellet contains total RNA >200 bp in length. The supernatant contains small RNA, and is retained for isolation in step 7.\n5. Add 1 ml 75% ethanol to the total RNA pellet. Invert the tube several times, then microcentrifuge 1 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C. Pour off the ethanol and microcentrifuge under the same conditions for 30 sec. Pipette off remaining liquid and discard.\n6. Resuspend the total RNA pellet in 20 \u00b5l of pre-warmed (50\u00b0C) RNA storage buffer. Quantify the RNA with UV spectroscopy by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.\nOne A260 unit of single-stranded RNA = 40 \u00b5g/ml. The quality of RNA can be assessed by measuring absorbance at 260/280 nm. A ratio of 2.0 is generally accepted as good-quality RNA.\nStore total RNA at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.\nIsolate small RNA\n7. To the saved supernatant from step 4, add 0.8 volumes 100% isopropanol. Chill on ice for 30 min. Centrifuge 20 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C, to pellet small RNA. Pour off the supernatant.\n8. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to purify and resuspend the small RNA.\nStore small RNA at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.\nIsolate mRNA9. Using 30 \u00b5g of total RNA from step 6, carry out mRNA enrichment according to the product manual of the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module. Upon completion, quantify the RNA with UV spectroscopy by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.\nOne A260 unit of single-stranded RNA = 40 \u00b5g/ml. The quality of RNA can be assessed by measuring absorbance at 260/280 nm. A ratio of 2.0 is generally accepted as good-quality RNA.\nTo isolate enough mRNA for downstream analysis and reduce the number of samples to be processed, we suggest using 50 \u00b5l of magnetic beads instead of the 20 \u00b5l stated by the manufacturer.\nStore mRNA at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.\nOne milligram of leaf tissue will yield 0.5 to 1.5 \u00b5g of total RNA, 50 to 150 ng of small RNA, and 15 to 50 ng of mRNA. Average yield is heavily dependent on plant species, with high polysaccharide content being particularly inhibitory.Here, we cover validation of miRNA and target differential expression results from RNA-seq using stem-loop qRT-PCR and standard qRT-PCR, respectively. Both methods rely on the same underlying principle: a relative fold change is determined by quantifying RNA levels of the species of interest under each condition and normalizing the expression change to an internal control that is stably expressed for the treatment under study. To prepare for qPCR, the RNA of interest and the internal control are both reverse transcribed into cDNA using gene-specific primers. Then, qPCR is conducted to quantify cDNA levels, based on fluorescence occurring from intercalation of dye into the double-stranded PCR product. In terms of primer design for stem-loop and standard qRT-PCR (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0008]), the latter is straightforward in that primers must simply produce a product of 150 to 200 bp. In contrast, the short length of miRNAs (\u223c21 nt) necessitates use of a specialized stem-loop primer during reverse transcription to increase the melting point of the product, followed by PCR using a reverse primer complementary to the stem-loop and a forward primer specific to the miRNA.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8526020e-4006-438e-8280-0a698fbe8eee/cppb20090-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nPrimer design for qRT-PCR validation of mRNA and miRNA expression. (A) The ideal product size for a qRT-PCR reaction is between 150 and 200 bp. Wherever possible, forward primers (FPs) and reverse primers (RPs) should be designed to span an intron, which will reduce the level of genomic DNA amplification from contamination and allow its detection on an agarose gel for troubleshooting. (B) miRNAs require reverse transcription with a reverse primer bearing a stem-loop, which serves to increase the length and melting point of the PCR product, to be compatible with standard PCR cycling.Following qPCR, the \u0394\u0394Ct formula is used to determine the relative fold change. The Ct value is the PCR cycle at which fluorescence rises above a set threshold during exponential amplification. The lower the Ct value, the higher the abundance of the RNA under study. A statistical test is conducted to determine whether the RNA abundance is significantly different between the experimental and control conditions. Finally, the fold changes obtained by qRT-PCR are correlated with those obtained by RNA-seq to determine whether the two methods of RNA quantification agree. Note that although most miRNA/target pairs under validation should be randomly selected, those of special interest are also tested.\nMaterials\nTotal RNA or small RNA of interest (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0008])\nPrimers in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-tbl-0002]\n10 mM dNTPs (NEB N0446S)\n5\u00d7 first-strand buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-rec-0001])\n0.1 M DTT\n40 U/\u00b5l murine RNase inhibitor (NEB M0314S)\n200 U/\u00b5l Superscript III reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher 18080093)\n2\u00d7 SYBR Green mastermix (Bimake B21202)\n0.2-ml PCR tubes\nRotor-GeneQ qRT-PCR System (Qiagen)\nTable 2.\n                Primers for qRT-PCR\ntable:\n\ufeffPrimer name,Sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032),Usage\nmRNA/Internal Control Reverse Transcriptase Primer (RTase RP),\u2026XXXXXXXX\u2026,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 1\"\nmiRNA/Internal Control Stem Loop RTase Primer,GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGAC-XXXXXX,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 1\"\nmRNA/Internal Control Forward Primer (FP),\u2026XXXXXXXX\u2026,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 4\"\nmRNA/Internal Control Reverse Primer (RP),\u2026XXXXXXXX\u2026,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 4\"\nmiRNA/Internal Control Forward Primer,\u2026XXXXXXXX\u2026.,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 4\"\nUniversal Reverse Primer (RP),CCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTA,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 4\"\na X's indicate sequence complementarity with the miRNA/mRNA under validation.\nReverse transcribe the total RNA and small RNA\n1.

After calculation of fold change, test for differential expression using the Student's t-test on Ct values.\n10. Create a scatterplot that compares the fold change by RNA-seq against the fold change by qRT-PCR. Make two separate plots, one for miRNAs and one for targets, with each point on the graph representing a single miRNA or target. Calculate the R2 correlation value to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between the two methods. An example of such a plot comparing the fold change of eight JA-responsive miRNAs measured by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR is illustrated in Neller et\u00a0al.

Coelenterazines are very sensitive to oxidation and are used as a chemiluminescent indicator of ROS accumulation (Dubuisson et\u00a0al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). To avoid resulting problems, seedlings must be grown under optimal growth conditions, and aequorin should be reconstituted in the dark. We recommend screening 10\u201320 plates per day for skilled researchers.\nAnalyzing transient Ca2+ signal response\nTiming: 6\u20139 h\nThe purpose of these steps is to monitor the Ca2+ signal response of M2 AEQsig6 seedlings for screening mutants.\nDraw a big arrowhead on the back of the plate to orientate the plate.\nSpray the 9-day-old seedlings evenly with \u223c2\u20133\u00a0mL/per dish of coelenterazine working solution (NanoLight, final concentration 10\u00a0\u03bcM in sterile dH2O, 0.1% Triton X-100 with a laryngeal or nasal spray).Critical: Apoaequorin binds to a prosthetic group, coelenterazine, to be converted to aequorin that reacts with Ca2+ (Shimomura et\u00a0al., 1962[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]). In the presence of Ca2+, coelenterazine is decomposed into coelenteramide and carbon dioxide with the emission of blue light at approximately 465\u00a0nm (Mithofer and Mazars, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). Coelenterazines are stable in solid form when stored at \u221280\u00b0C under nitrogen or argon, but unstable under light or in an aqueous solution because they are prone to be oxidized. The stock solution (2\u00a0mM in ethanol) should be prepared in ethanol or methanol and stored at \u221280\u00b0C in light-tight tubes and handled in the dark. Do not use DMF or DMSO to prepare stock solution because these solvents cause oxidation of coelenterazine. Use freshly prepared working solution.\nIncubate Petri dishes for 4\u20136\u00a0h at room temperature (20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C) in the dark for aequorin reconstitution.\nPre-cool down the operating temperature of the CCD camera to \u2212100\u00b0C.\nTransfer the Petri dish to the light-tight box of the CCD imaging apparatus in the dark.\nCritical: To prevent chlorophyll autofluorescence from interfering with the luminescence recording, do not expose the seedlings to light after applied coelenterazine. If the seedlings are occasionally exposed, keep in the dark for 5\u00a0min to minimize chlorophyll autofluorescence.\nTreat the seedlings with 600\u00a0mM mannitol in water (30\u00a0mL per 150\u00a0mm \u00d7 15\u00a0mm Petri dish) in the dark.\nNote: The solution of given stimuli should submerge the seedlings, but not too much.\nAcquire the luminescence image (Image1) continuously for 2\u20135\u00a0min, immediately after treatment.\nDiscard the mannitol solution.\nPlace the Petri dish back to the light-tight box of the CCD imaging apparatus as previously orientated.\nTreat the seedlings with 10\u00a0mM H2O2 in water (30\u00a0mL per 150\u00a0mm \u00d7 15\u00a0mm Petri dish).Acquire the luminescence image (Image2) continuously for 2\u20133\u00a0min immediately after treatment.\nCompare the Image1 with the Image2.\nPick up seedlings showed weaker luminescence in Image1 and normal luminescence in Image2 (about 0.5% of the total seedlings).\nNote: We assumed that most mutations do not affect the Ca2+ signal. Thus the majority of the M2 seedlings are considered as wild-type controls.\nRinse the mutant candidates with 25\u00a0mg/L cefotaxime solution in sterile-deionized water 2 times.\nNote: The use of cefotaxime reduces contamination by micro-organisms (Mittal et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).\nTransfer the mutant candidates to 1/2 MS medium (without sucrose) with 25\u00a0mg/L cefotaxime under low light for recovery.\nNote: Dissolve cefotaxime in 1/2 MS medium. This step is not necessary for stimuli that do not cause severe damage.\nTransfer the mutant candidates to the soil after 1\u20132\u00a0days recovery, and grow seedlings under optimal growth conditions.\nCritical: Steps 14\u201318 are optimal and should be carefully designed. Although these steps reduce the false positive mutant candidates, they may also have mutant candidates escaped. Some stimuli may share similar receptors or upstream regulators (Laohavisit et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18], Wu et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib49]). The alternative strategy is to pick up about 1.5%\u20132% of the total seedlings only according to Image1 (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The recommended ranges for stimuli were listed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/675-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

It should be aware that stimuli responses are controlled both by Ca2+-dependent and -independent processes (Kadota et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], Li et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20], Chen et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6], Yuan et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib51]).\nScreening AEQub EMS library for altered Ca2+ signal responsive mutants using the film adhesive seedling (FAS) system\nPreparing plant materials for the first-round screen\nTiming: 12\u00a0days\nThe purpose of these steps is to monitor the Ca2+ signal of M2 AEQub seedlings.\nPrepare M2 AEQub seedlings for luminescence imaging. Sterilize EMS-mutagenized M2 seeds of AEQub plants with a 10% bleach solution containing 0.01% Triton X-100 or 0.1% HgCl2 for 5\u00a0min and rinse with sterile water 4\u20135 times. Sow the sterilized seeds on a square plate (10\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0cm square Petri dish with grid) containing 1/2 MS, 1% sucrose, and 1.2% agar. Place plates vertically in a growth chamber for 7\u00a0days, after stratification at 4\u00b0C for 2\u00a0days. \nTransfer the seedlings onto a film. Place an adhesive film (Thermo Scientific Adhesive PCR Plate Seals) on the top of 7-day-old seedlings growing on the vertical plate. Gently push the film by hand to ensure that seedlings adhere to the film, and peel the film gently to let the seedlings adhered to the film (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A\u20132C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/675-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02.

Place the adhered seedlings onto the square plate (10\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0cm) containing 15\u00a0mL of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL h-coelenterazine (15\u00a0\u03bcl of 1\u00a0mg/mL coelenterazine added to 15\u00a0mL dH2O). Incubate the seedlings at room temperature (20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C) for 4\u00a0h to overnight (9\u201311 h) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E).\nPrepare for luminescence imaging. Discard the h-coelenterazine solution and place the film with seedlings face-up within the same plate. Leave the plate in the dark for 5\u00a0min (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nAcquire luminescence images. In the dark, place the plate on the stage of the CCD imaging system. Acquire images immediately and continuously for 2\u20135\u00a0min upon adding 20\u00a0mL of stimuli solution to the plates (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H).

Mutant candidates and wild-type control were grown on the same plate and transferred onto the same film for FAS Ca2+ imaging. Altered Ca2+ luminescence responses of the mutant were recorded under cold, oxidative, salt, and osmotic stress as compared to wild type.\nScale bars, 1\u00a0cm.\nAcquire images at an interval of 40\u00a0s for 160\u00a0s immediately upon adding 20\u00a0mL of 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 400\u00a0mM mannitol, 1\u00a0mM H2O2 to each plate, respectively (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D\u20133F). Acquire discharged images by applying 20\u00a0mL of discharge solution (2\u00a0M CaCl2 in 20% ethanol) to the plate containing the previous stimuli-treated seedlings (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nAnalyze luminescence images by comparing Ca2+ signal response images to its discharge images of mutant candidates. Mutant candidates with enhanced or reduced Ca2+ luminescence to given stimuli, but with similar luminescence intensity of discharged images should be considered for further verification by performing third- to fourth-round confirmation (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).Note: As noted above, the physiological status of seedling significantly affects Ca2+ signal response. To avoid the interference by defect of seed germination and growth, we recommend using the different batches of mutant seeds together with their wild-type AEQsig6 or AEQub that were harvested under the same growth condition for each round screen.\nCritical: Mutant candidates with reduced luminescence intensity of discharged aequorin should be eliminated (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and mutant 11 in Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D\u20133G). These could be caused by reduced expression of the apoaequorin gene due to mutations or silencing, or defects in coelenterazine absorption or aequorin reconstitution as described above.\nQuantitative Ca2+ measurement using a luminometer with AEQ seedlings\nTiming: 10 h\nThe purpose of these steps is to determine the Ca2+ signal dynamical features of mutants in response to given stimuli.\nPlace a single 7-day-old AEQsig6 or AEQub seedling into a 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tube that contains 1\u00a0mL of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL h-coelenterazine and place them in a light-seal box and leave it on a shaker (80\u00a0rpm/min) at room temperature overnight (20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C, 9\u201311 h).\nPlace the tube contains the seedling into the luminometer chamber. Acquire the signal for 60\u00a0s at 1\u00a0s intervals for resting luminescence.\nAcquire luminescence intensity (Lstimuli) at 1\u00a0s intervals for 80\u2013120\u00a0s (depended on the duration of Ca2+ luminescence response) immediately after adding 1\u00a0mL of 400\u00a0mM mannitol, or 100\u00a0mM NaCl, or 5\u00a0mM H2O2 solution into the tube.\nDiscard the stimuli solution, and acquire the luminescence intensity (Lrest) at 1\u00a0s intervals about 2\u00a0min until values were within 5% of the highest discharged value, immediately after adding 1\u00a0mL of discharging buffer (2\u00a0M CaCl2 in 20% ethanol).Note: Steps 42\u201345 can be adjusted depending on the type of luminometer used (Mittal et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27], Tanaka et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39]).\nThe total luminescence (Lmax) is calculated by Lrest plus Lstimuli. The calibration equation is adopted from the previously described equation (Knight et\u00a0al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]): pCa\u00a0= 0.332588 (-logk)\u00a0+ 5.5593, where k is a rate constant equal to stimuli triggered aequorin luminescence (Lstimuli) divided by total luminescence (Lmax). Mutants with either altered amplitudes or durations are shown in Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/675-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Quantification of cytosolic Ca2+ elevation in mutant candidates with altered Ca2+ signal responses using a luminometer\n(A) Quantification of cytosolic Ca2+ elevation in WT and m1 after treated with 400\u00a0mM mannitol.\n(B) Quantification of cytosolic Ca2+ elevation in WT and m2 after treated with 5\u00a0mM H2O2.\nArrows indicate the time points for treatments.\nWhole-genome resequencing\nTiming: 10\u00a0months\nThe purpose of these steps is to clone the gene with the mutation responsible for the altered Ca2+ signal response.\nBackcross the mutant with wild-type AEQsig6 or AEQub, and analyze the mannitol-induced Ca2+ signal in F1 seedlings. When F1 shows a wild-type phenotype, it is a recessive mutation, and vice versa, it is a dominant mutation. We suppose the mutation is recessive here.\nGenerate the backcrossed F2 population, the ratio of mutant-like and WT-like seedlings is 1:3 in the backcrossed F2 population.\nAnalyze the mannitol-induced Ca2+ signal response in the F2 population as steps 1\u201322, and pick up putative mutant seedlings with reduced mannitol-induced Ca2+ luminescence response. At least 200 F2 seedlings were selected and planted in soil. Collect the DNA of each candidate F2 mutants.\nHarvest F3 seeds from single F2 seedlings.\nAnalyze the mannitol-induced Ca2+ signal in the F3 seedlings.Select 40\u201350 single lines with reduced Ca2+ luminescence, and pooled the corresponding previously collected F2 DNA together for whole-genome resequencing (Abe et\u00a0al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nResequence the mutant parent line and the wild-type AEQsig6.\nLook for SNP changes only present in the mutant bulk as described previously (Abe et\u00a0al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nAlternatives: Map-based cloning using Wassilewskija (Ws) background also works (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib51]), but will also require a larger population to be screened.", "This protocol uses the 30-day-old w1118 flies from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC_3605, see Table of Materials).\n1. Preparation of the aged fruit flies\nFood preparation\n\t\nPrepare standard corn starch culture medium by mixing 50 g/L cornflakes, 110 g/L sugar, 5 g/L agar, and 25 g/L yeast. Heat the cornflakes and yeast with water to gelatinize, and then fully dissolve all the substances.\nWhen the medium cools to 50-60 \u00b0C, add 6 mL/L of propionic acid and promptly pack them into culture bottles.\nFly rearing and preparation of aged flies\n\t\nBreed the fly strain w1118 in bottles containing a standard cornstarch culture medium and put bottles in a constant temperature incubator at 25\u00b0 C, 68% relative humidity, 500-1000 lux lighting conditions, and a 12 h:12 h light: dark cycle.\nTransfer flies into a new bottle every 7 days according to the growth cycle of flies, keeping the age of individuals in the same bottle consistent.\nCollect the new batch of flies that hatch from the original bottle 3 days after transferring them and put them into a new bottle. Following the principle of changing the bottle every 7 days, they will be cultured until around 30 days old.\n2. Preparation of medicinal food and glass tubes for monitoring\nNOTE: The procedure for glass tube preparation follows the work of Jin et al. with modifications34.\nCleaning and drying of glass tubes\n\t\nPlace the glass tube (5 mm in diameter x 65 mm in length, see Table of Materials) into a large beaker, soak it, and boil it with double distilled water for 20 min. Repeat 3 times.\nRemove and bundle the glass tube, rinse the inside with double distilled water 3-5 times, and place it in an oven for drying.\nPreparation of simple culture medium (100 mL)Dissolve 1.5 g agar and 5 g sucrose in double distilled water, heat, and concentrate to 100 mL.\nAdd 600 \u00b5L propionic acid when the medium cools to about 70 \u00b0C, preventing it from solidifying using a constant temperature water bath.\nAdd approximately 4 mL of simple medium and Reserpine (see Table of Materials) into a 10 mL small beaker until the drug reaches 20 \u00b5M or 50 \u00b5M. Add dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the concentration of 0.2% in the negative control group.\nPreparation of the glass tubes containing medicine\n\t\nTo facilitate the flow of the medium, carefully insert a suitable length of glass tube into a small beaker. The medium will naturally enter the glass tube due to atmospheric pressure.\nPull out the glass tube when the culture medium is completely solidified and wipe the outer wall to obtain a monitoring glass tube with a culture medium containing drugs at one end.\nHeat the solid paraffin in a beaker until it melts at 70 \u00b0C, put the end of the glass tube close to the food into the paraffin liquid for about 5 mm, and quickly remove it. Wait for the paraffin to solidify to seal the food end of the glass tube.\n3. Experimental design and fly treatment\nDesign the experiment for the fly treatment following Table 1.\n4. Drosophila assembly and sleep monitoring\nNOTE: The procedure for Drosophila assembly follows the work of Jin et al.34 with modifications.\nAnesthetize flies with CO2 gas, put them into paraffin-sealed glass tubes (one per tube), and block the non-food end with an absorbent cotton ball to prevent flies from escaping and ensure air circulation.\nLoad tubes onto the infrared monitor for monitoring them.Assemble the glass tubes containing flies onto an infrared monitor in the same direction, and record the monitor number and hole number corresponding to each drug.\nAdjust the alignment of each tube, and make the infrared rays pass vertically through the center of the fly's activity range.\nPlace the monitor inside a 25 \u00b0C incubator located in the fly sleep darkroom, following the specified settings: 25 \u00b0C temperature, Zeitgeber 12 (ZT12) (equivalent to local time 08:00 p.m.), and ZT24 (equivalent to local time 08:00 a.m.). This setup ensures that the flies experience alternating periods of 12 h of light and darkness.\n\t\tNOTE: Try not to open the door until monitoring data collection is complete to maintain a stable environment in the incubator during monitoring.\nStart monitoring using the DAM2 system (see Table of Materials).\nOnce the monitoring is complete, download the collected data in .txt format from the system.\n5. Data processing\nNOTE: The data processing using the DAM system, DAMFileScan107, and SCAMP was performed according to the instructions on their official websites (see Table of Materials).\nImport the above txt file into DAMFileScan107 software for scanning and divide it as needed to obtain sleep data.\n\t\nSet the starting time of segmentation data to 8:01 (1 min segmentation) or 8:00 (30 min segmentation) on the third morning after starting the monitors, and the termination time is 8:00 a.m. three days after the starting time (Figure 2A1).\n\t\tNOTE: Flies must adapt to the monitoring environment for at least one day. So, one can set the split data start time to 8 a.m. on the third day after the monitor begins.Split the data at intervals of 1 min and 30 min. Change the option \"Bin Length\" to 1 minute, change the option \"Output File Type\" to Channel files, rename, and output. The 30 min data segmentation method is the same as above (Figure 2A2-5).\n\t\tNOTE: When performing data segmentation at 1 min and 30 min intervals, the final renaming of the two files should be consistent; otherwise, it may be unreadable during subsequent Matlab processing. If necessary, the file name can be changed after output to facilitate differentiation.\nData processing using SCAMP2020\n\t\nOpen the program package SCAMP2020 in Matlab, and double-click on Vecsey Sleep and Circadian Analysis MATLAB Program (SCAMP) (Figure 2B).\nAdd its subfolder \"Vecsey SCAMP Scripts\" to the path, find the file \"scamp.m\" in that folder, and run it. In the following pop-up window, select the process 1 min and 30 min folders in sequence (Figure 2C,D).\nSelect a monitor, click on Load individual See Plots to preview (Figure 3A1), and check the image that appears. Uncheck the corresponding channel of dead flies (Figure 3A2, Figure 3B).\nRepeat the above steps to check all monitors.\nRename each channel in each monitor based on the corresponding drug to be tested (Figure 3A3), select all monitors, and click on ANALYZE Selected Data for analysis (Figure 3A4).\nDefault to the selected option, click on Analyze for Chosen Bin, check Export Data, and finally click on GRAPH 30 min Data Types for All Days for Selected Groups and EXPORT All Data to output the results (Figure 3C).Select the file named s30 from the CSV file, find the corresponding mean value and standard error data for each monitor, back up it to Excel for modification and adjustment, and paste it into GraphPad Prism (see Table of Materials) to draw a sleep status diagram (Figure 4A,B).\nFind the file named \"stdur\" and calculate the average values of daytime, nighttime, and total sleep for each fly within three days (Figure 4A,C). Paste the data into the Prism software to complete the difference test and draw a graph.\nSubscription Required.

Procedures were performed on C57/BL6J mice which were reared at the University of Sydney Bosch Rodent Facility. All mice were housed in a single adequately-ventilated room in 21 \u00b0C ambient temperature on a 12 hr light-dark cycle with lights on at 0600 hr in individually ventilated cages with ad libitum access to dry food and water. Late-pregnancy females were randomly assigned to standard or environmentally enriched housing conditions.\n1. Housing (Enrichment Levels):\nObtain 4 late-pregnancy adult female mice. Randomly assign 2 to the standard condition and place each of them into a clean standard mouse cage (overall dimensions 391 x 199 x 160 mm) containing one red mouse igloo. For the enriched condition, place the remaining 2 mice into a single clean rat-sized cage (overall dimensions 462 x 403 x 404 mm).\nInto the enrichment cage, place a variety of objects designed to increase sensory and motor stimulation (e.g. running wheels, visual stimuli, scented cotton balls, Velcro strips).\nEvery 2 to 3 days move these objects about within the cage; refresh any that have been destroyed.\nUpon weaning at 21 days postnatal, sex animals and place into male-female segregated housing consistent with the environmental condition they were raised. For the enriched condition ensure that there are between 3 and 10 mice per cage with 2 and 5 mice for standard. Commence behavioral testing once animals reach adulthood (12\u201314 weeks of age).\n2. Construction of the Puzzle Box\nObtain 6 pieces of white acrylic (or other non-porous material): one 750 x 280 mm, two 280 x 250 mm, two 750 x 250 mm, and one 150 x 280 mm (see Figure 1).Obtain one piece of black acrylic 280 x 250 mm, with a 40 x 40 mm square opening cut into one side of this piece (see Figure 1).\nAssemble the Puzzle Box as follows: use the 750 x 280 mm piece as the bottom of the box, use 280 x 250 mm pieces as the ends of the box, and the 750 x 250 mm pieces as the sides of the box.\nMeasure 150 mm into the box from one end, and place the black piece of acrylic across the box so that it splits it into two compartments (one large, one small) with the opening flush with the bottom of the box.\nTake the 150 x 280 mm piece of white acrylic and place it atop the smaller compartment of the box making sure it covers this area completely, providing a dark \u201cgoal-box\u201d chamber. Affix this piece of acrylic to the body of the main box by hinges, or leave free to be completely removed during behavioral testing.\nTake 3 pieces of acrylic (three 4 x 120 mm) and join to make a \u201cu-shaped\u201d channel.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52225/52225fig1highres.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic diagram of the Puzzle Box task. The Puzzle Box is an acrylic box consisting of an open-field area (600 x 280 mm) and a sheltered goal-box area (150 x 280 mm), measuring 750 x 280 mm in all. A 40 x 40 mm opening within the partition (grey) separating the two areas allows animals to access to the covered goal-box area from the open field. This opening is blocked with obstructions that are increasingly difficult to remove as testing progresses. Animals undergo a five-day protocol, consisting of four obstruction conditions with three trials for each condition.\n3. Running of the Puzzle Box TaskThoroughly clean the Puzzle Box with 70% alcohol. Repeat this step between each animal tested.\nPlace a clean red mouse igloo within the goal-box area of the Puzzle Box, and replace the lid on the goal-box.\nIf there is an obstruction condition being tested, place the obstruction within the doorway of the goal-box (see Figure 2).\nPlace the mouse being tested into the open-field section of the Puzzle Box, oriented towards the goal-box, and at the end furthest from the goal-box.\nRecord the time taken for all four paws of the animal to enter the goal-box section of the Puzzle Box.\nIf an animal does not enter the goal-box, terminate the trial once the set time limit is reached (see Table 1).\nOnce a trial is finished, remove the animal from the Puzzle Box and place it into a separate holding cage until the next trial begins. Keep a 60 to 180 sec gap between trials for each animal.\nFor each animal, perform three trials per day for five consecutive days of testing, with four obstruction conditions and three trials of each condition.

Preparation of ACSF Solution\nPrepare ACSF solution as described in Table 1. Make 1 L in ddH2O (>18 M\u03a9 purity), bringing osmolarity to ~300 mOsm/L with appropriate addition of water or NaCl.\n2. Equipment and Room Set Up\nThe equipment for monitoring of cocaine-induced locomotor behavior consists of behavior chambers (50 x 45 cm) wired with an inner light source, fan and camera (or infrared sensors), and fitted with an inner perspex box (30 x 30 cm) in which the mice are allowed to move freely while their locomotion is monitored. The behavioral testing should be performed between 1 hr after lights on to 1 hr before lights off, on a regular light/dark cycle. Animals should be trained consistently at the same time each day.\nConnect camera or infrared system to an appropriate system for monitoring and recording the locomotor behavior of the mice.\nClean the chambers after each trial with disinfectant provided by mouse facility and/or odor removing reagent, in order to prevent olfactory cue bias and to ensure proper disinfection.\nIMPORTANT: While handling the mice be quiet, calm and careful.\n3. Animal Preparation\nHouse 5 C57BL6 male mice (6-12 weeks old; ~25-35 g of weight) per cage, in a room with a 12 hr light/dark cycle and free access to food and water, according to standards and requirements of local Animal Care Committee guidance and protocols. Before initiating the experiment, weigh the mice and log the data. Cocaine is later administered according to the weight of the mice.\nTransfer all the cages containing mice into the behavioral room 30 min before starting the first trial.Habituate all of the mice used in the experiment to experimenter handling, injections and monitoring in the behavior setup. This is achieved by 3 consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of 250 \u03bcl saline as described below.\nAdminister an intraperitoneal injection of 250 \u03bcl saline. Immediately following the injection, place the mouse in a behavior chamber to monitor locomotor activity for 15 min. Repeat this action for 3 consecutive days, at the same hour each day.\nOn the fourth day, divide the mice into two groups. Prepare a stock solution of cocaine at 2 mg/ml in saline. Administer a single injection of cocaine solution (final 20 mg/kg) to the experimental group according to the weight of the mouse (e.g. for a 25 g mouse \u2013 inject 250 \u03bcl, whereas a 30 g mouse will receive 300 \u03bcl). Administer saline to the control group. Immediately following the injection, place the mouse for 20 min in a behavior chamber for monitoring of locomotor activity (typically, the first 15 min are monitored).\nAfter the cocaine injection, sacrifice the mice at different time points (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hr following injection). Importantly, make sure that reference mice (0 time point) will not receive any injection on this day. Due to its significance, it is imperative to include replicates of the reference group.\n4. Dissection of the Nucleus Accumbens\nAnesthetize the mice with isoflurane at the appropriate time after the cocaine/saline injection. The isoflurane must be directly vented out of the room. Therefore, the procedure should be performed in a chemical fume hood.Monitor the depth of anesthesia by testing the rear foot reflex. Pinch the paw to elicit a withdrawal response by the animal. An animal that shows a reflex is not at a surgical level of anesthesia and not in a state to euthanize.\nExtraction of the brain:\n\t\nEuthanize the mouse by decapitation.\nRemove the skin above the center of the skull and cut the skull with sharp scissors.\nInsert the scissors at the point where the spinal cord enters the brain (foramen magnum) and make two lateral cuts.\nFrom the same point, make a long sagittal cut along the sagittal suture. Upon reaching the olfactory bulb, clip to the left and to the right.\nWith a forceps, remove the skull carefully, grasping each half of the skull firmly and pulling to the side, taking care not to press onto or damage the brain.\nRemove the brain while severing the cranial nerves by using an inverted micro spoon spatula.\nPlace the brain in an ice-cold ACSF solution for 1-2 min to chill and harden.\nRemove brain from the ACSF, wick excess fluid with a paper towel, create a coronal cut between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain and glue the brain, with the rostral part facing up, onto the vibratome stage.\nCutting the NAc:\n\t\nMaintain ACSF solutions at ice-cold temperatures in the slicing chamber of the vibratome. Section at 200 \u03bcm until the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is clearly identified according to the Paxinos and Franklin Mouse Brain Atlas (approximately 1.8 mm anterior to Bregma; pay attention to the shape of the corpus callosum, the location and shape of the anterior commissure and the ventricles, as well as the overall morphology of the brain section). At this point, create two 400 \u03bcm sections, from which the NAc will be dissected.Under a stereoscope, use a fine blade to dissect the NAc area out from the slices. The definition of the NAc is according to the Paxinos and Franklin mouse brain atlas, and could conveniently be dissected in appropriate sections by four quick passes of the blade on the tissue. (Figure 2).\nPlace NAc sections immediately in 900 \u03bcl Trizol lysis reagent in a microcentrifuge tube and store at -80 \u00b0C until RNA extraction.\n5. RNA Extraction and cDNA Reverse Transcription\nThaw the tubes containing nucleus accumbens sections in trizol lysis reagent at room temperature and homogenize the lysate with a 1 ml syringe connected to 25 G needle until the tissue is completely homogenized (at least 15-20 times). The first few rounds are difficult, and require pushing the tissue against the wall of the tube in order to break it to small pieces that could enter the tip of the needle.\nTo ensure homogenization, pipet the lysate into a QIAshredder mini spin column and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min.\nPipet the lysate into new microcentrifuge tube and extract the RNA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Store the RNA at -80 \u00b0C until use.\nMeasure the RNA concentration, analyze integrity and quality using a Bioanalyzer or equivalent equipment. Use 100-500 ng RNA for each round of cDNA preparation with random hexamer primers.\n6. Primer Design and Primer Testing\nChoosing good primers: For an optimal primer pair for qPCR of mRNA transcripts, follow these requirements (Figure 3):\n\t\nDesign primers containing no longer than 17-28 bases. Avoid nucleotide repeats as they promote mispriming.\nDesign primers with melting temperature (Tm) between 56-68\u00b0C (optimally 60-64\u00b0C). The Tm within the primer pair should be within 1 \u00b0C of each other.\nBe aware that the product size should ideally be between 80 and 150bp.Ensure that at least one of the primers covers an exon-exon junction, or the amplicon contains a large intron (intron-spanning), to avoid amplification of genomic DNA contaminants.\nUse a reliable software based on Primer3 (for examples see Table 2) in order to improve primer design.\nTesting the primers: In order to ensure the specificity and efficiency of the primers, a control qPCR reaction should be performed:\n\t\nUse a positive sample (containing cDNA template for all relevant primer pairs) and titrate the cDNA (e.g. eight three-fold dilutions from an initial concentration of ~10 ng) in duplicate parallel reactions. Include a no-template control, which controls for contamination within the solutions used for the reaction.\nCalculate primer efficiency by using the formula: (10(\u22121/slope)-1) \u00d7 100, such that the curve of the optimal slope is \u2212 3.333 (i.e. 10(\u2212 1/3.333) = 2) (Figure 4).\nDetermine the specificity of the amplification. Specific amplification is demonstrated by a single prominent peak common to all the melting curves of the amplified products, whereas off-target amplification would appear as an obvious deviation from the single large peak.\n7. qPCR Analysis\nPre-amplification:\n\t\nComprehensive qPCR analysis is based on parallel querying of limiting quantities of RNA with a large number of primer pairs. Therefore, a step of pre-amplification is essential. In this step, the cDNA undergoes 14-18 cycles of pre-amplification with a mixture of all the primers that will be utilized for querying the sample in the future (up to 800 primer pairs).\nDilute all primers in TE (low EDTA) to 50 \u03bcM for Specific Target Amplification (STA).\nPool together 1 \u03bcl aliquots of all of the 50 \u03bcM primer sets to be included in the STA reaction, up to 800 assays.Prepare pre-mix and samples for STA as described in Table 3. Allow for error by preparing mix for 110% of the number of samples that need to be amplified.  \nAliquot 3.75 \u03bcl STA pre-mix for each sample. Add 1.25 \u03bcl of cDNA to each.\nVortex to mix the reactions and centrifuge for 10 sec.\nPlace the STA reactions in a thermal cycler and cycle as indicated at Table 4.\nExonuclease I (ExoI) treatment:\n\t\nDilute the Exo I as indicated in Table 5.\nAdd 2 \u03bcl of diluted ExoI (4 U/\u03bcl) to each 5 \u03bcl STA reaction, vortex, spin down (>6,000 x g) and place in a thermal cycler at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min and then at 80 \u00b0C for 15 min.\nDilute the final products to an appropriate concentration for testing. Use TE Buffer (add 43 \u03bcl TE buffer to the 7 \u03bcl TSA sample).\nStore the diluted STA products at -20 \u00b0C or use immediately.\nPrimer and sample setup for qPCR:\n\t\nPrepare samples as shown in Table 6. Prepare mix according to the chip chosen for the experiment, and add samples as appropriate.\nAgitate the Sample Mix solutions for a minimum of 20 sec, and centrifuge (>6,000 x g) for at least 30 sec. Prepared reactions can be stored for short durations at 4 \u00b0C until the chip is ready for loading.\nPrepare the assays as described in Table 7.\nAgitate the Assay Mix for a minimum of 20 sec and centrifuge (>6,000 x g) for at least 30 sec to spin down all components.\n\t\tIMPORTANT: Vortex thoroughly and centrifuge all sample and assay solutions before pipetting into the chip inlets. Failure to do so may result in a decrease in data quality.NOTE: The final concentration of each primer is 5 \u03bcM in the inlet and 500 nM in the final reaction.\nPriming and Loading the Dynamic Array IFC (integrated fluidic circuit) chip. The IFC chip has inlets for samples and assays, as well as specified inlets (accumulators) for control line fluid (mineral oil) used to pressurize the microfluidic chambers (Figure 4A).\n\t\nInject control line fluid into each accumulator on the chip.\nRemove and discard the blue protective film from the bottom of the chip.\nPlace the chip into the appropriate IFC controller (controller MX for the 48.48 Dynamic Array IFC or the IFC controller HX for the 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC), then run the Prime (113x) script for the 48.48 Dynamic Array IFC or the Prime (136x) script for the 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC in order to prime the chip.\nWhen the script has finished, remove the primed chip from the IFC controller.\nPipette 5 \u03bcl of each Assay Mix and 5 \u03bcl of each Sample Mix into their inlets.\nReturn the chip to the IFC controller.\nUsing the IFC controller software, run the Load Mix (113x) script for the 48.48 Dynamic Array IFC) or Load Mix (136x) script for the 96.96 Dynamic Array IFC to load the samples and assays into the chip. When the Load Mix script has finished, remove the loaded chip from the IFC controller.\nLoad the chip on the thermal cycler, create a new chip run (according to manufacturer guidelines), including melting curve analysis. Using the thermal cycler software, ensure that the reaction chambers are recognized properly, and allow the reaction to run to completion.\n8. Data AnalysisQuality assurance: In order to ensure data quality, verify the quality of the primers by addressing dilution curves (as described above). Monitor the specificity of amplification by viewing the melting curves of amplicons, the peaks of which should optimally be tightly aligned29.\nVisualization: For visualization of large quantities of data obtained by high-throughput qPCR, use software generated heatmaps, in which expression is color-coded by intensity. In addition, display the transcriptional dynamics of single genes as lined scatter plots.\nPublication: In publishing the gene expression results, it is advised to follow the MIQE Guidelines for publication of quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments, detailing the minimum information that must be reported for a qPCR experiment to ensure its relevance, accuracy, correct interpretation, and reproducibility.\nSubscription Required.

Materials\nIn order to estimate vestibular perception thresholds, ensure that there is access to a motion platform or a rotatory chair.\nEnsure that a control software for programming the motion profiles and interfacing the motion platform is present.\n\tNOTE: PlatformCommander15,16, an open-source software package to interface the motion platform, was used in this study. PlatformCommander allows for defining sinusoidal acceleration profiles, which are often used to estimate vestibular thresholds.\nEnsure that a response device, for example, a game controller, is present for registering the participants' responses.\nMotion platforms produce noise correlated with the movement intensity. Participants can use this auditory noise as an additional, unintended source of information during the estimation of vestibular perception thresholds. To mask the sound of the platform, present the participants with white noise via noise-canceling headphones during each trial.\nBlindfold the participants to eliminate the influence of visual motion cues.\nDecide on which estimation algorithm to use and define the respective parameters. If a staircase approach is used, define the starting point, the step size, the up-date, and termination rules. If the user does not know what values to choose, perform pilot measurements or consult the literature. Defaults are provided by the example scripts available online (https://gitlab.com/dr_e/2022-jovedemo).NOTE: The starting point defines the peak velocity of the platform in the first trial. Determine suitable starting velocities by pilot testing or by consulting the threshold literature (for yaw thresholds, see Grabherr et al.5). The step size describes by how much the intensity changes between trials. The up-date rule describes whether and how the stimulation intensity is changed based on the participants' responses. In the vestibular domain, a three-down/one-up staircase procedure is common. This means that the intensity is decreased after three consecutive correct answers but increased after each wrong answer. The termination criteria are usually defined by either a fixed number of trials or the number of intensity reversals. Intensity reversals are trials in which the response causes an intensity increase after one or more intensity decreases or vice versa. The provided script keeps track of the reversals, terminates the procedure, and automatically calculates the final threshold value.\nDecide for which frequency the threshold needs to be estimated. In the demonstration, 1 Hz was used.\n\tNOTE: Vestibular thresholds are typically investigated for frequencies between 0.1 and 5 Hz, and thresholds are known to decrease as stimulation frequency increases3.\nDecide for which type of motion the threshold needs to be estimated. In the demonstration, yaw rotations are performed.\n\tNOTE: Thresholds can be estimated for translations and rotations. Thresholds are most often estimated for the three main axes (naso-occipital, inter-aural, head-vertical) and the rotations around them (roll, pitch, yaw). The provided script only estimates one defined motion (direction, frequency) at a time. However, for estimating multiple thresholds, the script can be rerun with the same or different motion parameters (direction, frequency, rotation axes).Start every threshold estimation procedure with training, allowing the participant to familiarize themselves with the task. Use the script \"threshold-training.jl\" available online (see step 1.6) for this purpose.\n\tNOTE: The training script presents a series of supra-threshold motion stimuli. The test script automatically controls the estimation procedure, handles the staircase algorithm updating, the stimulus intensity, the presentation of the motion stimulus, the presentation of auditory white noise during each motion stimulus, as well as the logging of all relevant data. During the training, ensure that the participant understands the task and provide guidance in case of uncertainties.\n2. Instructions\nExplain the experimental procedure to the participant and obtain informed consent.\nSeat the participant on the chair mounted on the motion platform.\nSecure the participant using seat belts.\nGive the response buttons to the participant and explain how the keys are assigned to the responses.\nBlindfold the participant. Position the headphones on the participant's head.\nApply a proper head fixation.\nTurn on the motion platform using the main, battery, and controller switch.\nEnsure that the area around the platform is clear and that no people can approach the moving platform during the test.\nStart the training procedure script by typing julia threshold-training.jl into the command line.\nInform the participant about the engagement of the motion platform.Ensure a successful initialization of the session by checking the status displayed in the GUI of the server software (PlatformCommander). When successfully initialized, the status display will switch from Session Not Underway to Short Sequence. It will also display the IP address of the connected client and the time when the session was initialized. If the session is not successfully initialized after a few seconds, check the network connection between the client and the server. Ensure that the motion platform is switched on and that the controller is connected.\nEnsure that the participant understands the task, point out mistakes by the participant (e.g., when they push the wrong buttons), and respond to potential questions the participant may have.\nInform the participant that the training procedure is finished, and the estimation procedure is about to start.\nStart the estimation procedure script by typing julia threshold-test.jl into the command line.\nSupervise the fully automated estimation procedure until the termination criteria are reached.\nDepending on the design, repeat the procedure starting at step 2.13 using different stimuli or terminate the procedure.\nPark the motion platform.\nRemove the head fixation, headphones, blinder, and buttons, and let the participant descend.\nDebrief the participant about the procedure and ask them about their experience to improve further experiments.\n\tNOTE: The procedure can be paused and then restarted at any time, preferably not during the threshold estimation phase (steps 2.15-2.17).", "All studies and experimental protocols were approved by and in compliance with guidelines of the University at Buffalo and VA Western New York Animal Care and Use Committees.\n1. Experiment Setup and General Advice\nNOTE: A total of twenty-four female mice on a C57BL/6J background were used in this protocol starting at 23\u00a0months of age. The mice carried\u00a0a conditional SIRTloxp-exon4-loxp mutation29, however, this was not induced in this experiment.\nEnsure that mice receive permanent identifiers such as ear tags, RFID chips, or tail tattoos.\nNOTE: It is recommended to also use temporary markings (e.g., permanent marker to mark tails) for quick identification during assessment periods.\nClean the treadmill with 0.25-0.5% bleach (v/v) or 70% (v/v) ethanol at the end of the day or to remove feces or urine between experimental trials. Dry solutions completely before initiating a new trial.\nNOTE: Ethanol may increase wear to the treadmill belt. It is recommended that the treadmill be cleaned between each run if working with group-housed male mice in order to minimize in cage fighting. It is recommended to perform treadmill assessments at the same time of day at each time point in longitudinal studies30,31,32, and if other assessments are being performed, the order should remain the same. The investigator running the experiment should also be blind to the group designations of the mice.\n2. Acclimatizing Mice to Treadmill Apparatus\nNOTE: Initiate acclimatization of mice 1\u00a0month prior to baseline experiments.\nSet up the initial training program using the treadmill software (v3.4.7) in Manual mode (Figure 1 and Table 1).\nOpen the treadmill software. Then, click on the file and open the experiment.\nInput the values indicated in Table 1 on the Manual tab (Figure 1) under Acclimation.Input the session number as 1, the number of active channels as 1 to 6 depending on the number of mice, the number of visits to the grid as 10, and the number of shocks as 20.\nNOTE: Shock intensity for this initial run is set at level 1 (0.46\u00a0mA).\nSet the inclination of the treadmill to 0\u00b0 (flat).\nHold mice by the tail when placing in the treadmill and place mice directly on the belt to avoid starting mice on the shock grid.\nUse a brush or tongue depressor to keep mice away from the shock grid when training or assessment begins. Nudge mice to begin running to avoid unintended shocks.\nAfter each mouse is given the initial training program, repeat the program as above with the shock intensity increased to level 2 (0.59\u00a0mA) with at least 15\u00a0min between trainings.\nOne to two days after the initial training program administer the uphill treadmill acclimatization.\nOpen the treadmill software. Then click on the file and then open the experiment.\nInput the values on the Basic tab as indicated in Table 2 under Acclimation.\nUnder Shock Detection, input the session number as 1, the number of active channels as 1 to 6 depending on the number of mice, the number of visits to the grid as 10, and the number of shocks as 20.\nClick on the Profile Mode tab (Figure 2) and for Step 1, input a start speed of 0\u00a0m/min and an end speed of 5\u00a0m/min with a period of 5\u00a0s.\n\t\t\nAdd a warm up step 2 with a start speed of 5\u00a0m/min and end speed of 5\u00a0m/min for 30\u00a0seconds. Add a transition step that starts at 5\u00a0m/min and an end speed of 6\u00a0m/min for 5\u00a0s.Add a test speed step that starts at 6\u00a0m/min and ends at 6\u00a0m/min for 20\u00a0s. Add a transition step that starts at 6\u00a0m/min and ends at 5\u00a0m/min.\nAdd a recovery interval that starts at 5\u00a0m/min and ends at 5\u00a0m/min for 20\u00a0s (Figure 2).\nRepeat step 2.6.4 to add test speed steps as indicated in Table 2 under acclimation.\nTwo weeks prior to baseline assessments, continue acclimatization by providing two treadmill flat aerobic capacity assessments as described in section 3, given on consecutive days.\nOne to two days after the second endurance training, provide two treadmill uphill anaerobic capacity assessments as described in section 4, given on the same day with a minimum of 30\u00a0min between trainings.\n3. Flat Continuous Treadmill Assessment\nCreate a treadmill program as described in step 2.1, using values indicated in Table 1 under Assessment. Under Shock Detection, set the session number as 1, the number of active channels as 1 to 6 depending on the number of mice, the number of visits to the grid as 10, and the number of shocks as 20.\nMonitor the mice throughout the trial and remove mice from the instrument that reach the endpoint criteria.\nNOTE: This step is to avoid mice inadvertently touching the shock grid of neighboring mice and affecting data. Parameters include the total time on belt, the distance travelled, and the shocks to visits ratio. It is recommended to perform two assessments at each time point, separated by at least one day between assessments.\n4. Uphill Interval Treadmill AssessmentCreate a treadmill program as described in step 2.6, using values indicated in Table 2 under Assessment. Under Shock Detection, set the session number as 1, the number of active channels as 1 to 6 depending on the number of mice, the number of visits to the grid as 5, and the number of shocks as 10.\nSet the interval field in the treadmill program to 0.5.\nNOTE: This allows for data points to be collected every second instead of every minute, which aids in identifying the speed at endpoint for each mouse. The program will automatically stop after the 50\u00a0m/min stage due to software limitations. Parameters include the time on belt, the distance travelled, and the test speed of the last successfully completed stage before endpoint. The latter is used for determining baseline intensity for the HIIT regimen described in step 5. It is recommended to perform two assessments per time point, separated by at least 30\u00a0min.\n5. Short session High Intensity Interval Training\nSet the treadmill uphill (25\u00b0) and remove the plastic cover.\nDetermine the intensity for each mouse. Use the speed of the last successfully completed stage (Step 4.5) and find the intensity group and corresponding Base, Sprint, and Dash speeds using Table 3.\nOpen the treadmill software and click on file to create a new program.\nClick on the Profile Mode tab and for Step 1, input a start speed of 0\u00a0m/min and an end speed as indicated under Base speed as indicated in Table 3 with a period of 5\u00a0s.\nAdd a warm up step 2 with a start speed at Base speed and end speed at Base speed for 180\u00a0s.Input 3 intervals each with 1) a transition step that goes from Base to Sprint for 5\u00a0s, 2) an step at Sprint speed for 60s, 3) a transition step that goes from \u201csprint\u201d to Base over 5\u00a0s, and 4) a step for a recovery interval at Base speed for 60\u00a0s.\nAdd a transition step that goes from Base to Sprint speed over 5\u00a0s and a final step that goes from Sprint to Dash speed over 60\u00a0s.\nNOTE: Programs can be saved, modified, and reloaded.\nPerform exercise three days a week with at least one day of rest between sessions (i.e., Monday, Wednesday, Friday).\nRewrite exercise programs to increase Base, Sprint, and Dash speeds 1\u00a0m/min every two weeks.\nNOTE: No electric shocks are given during the exercise.\nMotivate mice to run using a makeup brush (recommended) or tongue depressor to lightly motivate mice that fall near or on the shock grid. If a mouse does not respond retry in 5\u00a0s, then 10\u00a0s, and then retry every 30\u00a0s or during a recovery interval until the end of the session.\nNOTE: consider removing mice from the study that do not run on the treadmill at any intensity or are unable to complete the first three intervals at the intensity defined for the lowest intensity group (Table 3)\nMove mice that cannot be motivated to complete the first three intervals in two consecutive exercise sessions to lower intensity groups (Table 3).\nMove mice that do not require motivation in two consecutive exercise sessions to higher intensity groups (Table 3).\nTake sedentary control mice in cages place beside the treadmill as it runs. Alternatively, sedentary controls can be placed in the lanes of a non-moving treadmill for 10\u00a0min.Subscription Required.

Animal ethics approval was obtained from the Animal Ethics Committee, University of Melbourne.\u00a0The materials herein are for laboratory experiments only, and not intended for medical or veterinary use.\n1. Preparing Electrodes\nNote: A three channel transmitter is used for surgical implantation which enables 2 ERG and 1 VEP recording to be conducted simultaneously. The three active and three inactive electrodes need to be pre-fashioned into a ring shape before implantation in order to attach to the eye. For identification purposes, the manufacturer has enclosed active electrodes in half white, half colored plastic sheaths while inactive electrodes are covered in full colored sheaths. The ground electrode (clear plastic sheath) is left unaltered. For all active and inactive electrodes conduct steps 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.7.\nUntwist the double stranded stainless steel electrode with two fine tipped pliers.\nTrim one of the stainless steel strands (approximately 1 cm from the tip), leaving a single longer straight strand remaining to shape the ring electrode.\nFold the single stainless steel strand back onto itself and twist, forming a smooth ring at the tip of the electrode.\nFor the ERG active electrodes fashion this loop ~ 0.2 - 0.5 mm in diameter by twisting the base of the loop (for the purpose described here, shape two active electrodes in this way to record ERG from both eyes), and for the ERG inactive and VEP electrodes make the loop diameter ~ 0.8 mm diameter (in this example, do this for one active VEP electrode and all three inactive electrodes).Hook the circular VEP active electrode around a stainless steel screw (diameter 0.7 mm, length 3 mm) so the electrode rests against the screw head.\nHook the 3 inactive electrodes (2 ERG, 1 VEP) around a second stainless steel screw (diameter 0.7 mm, length 3 mm).\nPull the plastic sleeve forward over the sharp ends of the two stainless steel strand to reduce irritation.\nSterilize the telemetry transmitters by soaking in 2% glutaraldehyde for more than 10 hr at approximately 25 \u00b0C. Then rinse the transmitter with sterile saline 3 times.\n2. Transmitter Implantation\nAnimal Preparation\nDisinfect\u00a0the surgical area prior to experimentation by cleaning with 70% ethanol. Autoclave all surgical equipment before use and maintain equipment in chlorhexidine when not in use during surgery. Cover the animal with a surgical drape during surgery to maintain a sterile environment. Ensure all experimenters wear surgical masks, sterile\u00a0gloves and gowns.\nInduce anesthesia with 1.5 - 2% isoflurane, at a flow rate of 3 L/min and maintained at 1.5 - 2 % at 2 L/min throughout the surgery. Confirm sufficient depth of anesthesia by absence of a pedal reflex upon pinching the muscle between the toes.\nShave a 40 mm x 30 mm area over the abdomen from above the groin to the sternum.\nShave a 30 mm x 20 mm area over the forehead, posterior to the eyes and anterior to the ears.\nDisinfect the two shaved areas. For the forehead area disinfect with 10% povidone-iodine three times (avoid the use of alcohol-based antiseptics for area near the eye, being consistent with the Standard of Practice set out by the Association of Surgical Technologists). Over the abdomen disinfect with 10% povidone iodine and 70% ethanol.\nApply 1 drop of proxymetacaine to the cornea for additional topical anesthesia.Apply 1 drop of carboxymethylcellulose sodium to the cornea to prevent drying of the eyes.\nSurgical implantation\nMake a 10 mm incision on the head along the vertical midline between the ears with a surgical scalpel.\nMake a 5 mm incision on the abdomen through the skin layer along the midline below the sternum.\nTunnel a 5 mm diameter cannula subcutaneously from the abdomen incision to the head incision.\nFeed the electrode wires (3 active and 3 inactive) of the transmitter through the cannula from the abdomen to the head.\nLeave the reference electrode with the transmitter base and cover the electrode tip with aseptic gauze.\nCover the electrode tips (3 active and 3 inactive) with aseptic gauze.\nSecure the rat's head to a stereotaxic platform.\nExtend the forehead incision to 30mm in length with surgical scissors.\nExpose surgical area by retracting loose skin with 2 sutures (3 - 0) at ~ 3 and 9 o'clock.\nScrape off the periosteum overlying the skull using sterilized gauze to expose bregma, lambda and midline sutures.\nDrill two holes through the skull at the VEP active (7 mm ventral to bregma 3 mm lateral to midline) and inactive (5 mm rostral to bregma on the midline) stereotaxic co-ordinates.\nAttach VEP active and inactive electrodes with pre-attached stainless steel screws (diameter 0.7 mm, length 3 mm) to the skull with a small screw-driver to ~ 1 mm in depth into the premade holes. This anchors the screw to the bone without damaging the underlying cortical tissue.\nTo implant the ERG active electrodes use an 8 - 0 suture to temporarily retract the upper eyelid.\nInsert a 16 to 21 G cannula subcutaneously from behind the eye through to the superior conjunctival fornix.\nRemove the guiding needle.Feed the active electrode through the shortened plastic catheter from the forehead towards the eye. Then remove the plastic catheter.\nUse a temporary suture (8 - 0), which is threaded through the electrode loop, to prevent the electrode from retracting back into the tunnel.\nMake a 0.5 mm incision on the superior conjunctiva at 12 o'clock, 1 mm behind limbus. Use blunt dissection to expose the underlying sclera.\nImplant an 8 - 0 or 9 - 0 suture immediately behind the limbus at half scleral thickness.\nRemove temporary suture from ERG active electrode.\nAnchor the ERG active electrode to the half scleral thickness suture by tying 3 consecutive knots ensuring the tip of the electrode is situated close to the limbus.\nClose the conjunctival flap using 1 to 2 interrupted sutures (8 - 0 to 9 - 0). Ensure that the conjunctiva completely covers the ERG electrode to improve comfort.\nRemove the eyelid retracting suture.\nRepeat the procedure for the contralateral eye.\nApply cyanoacrylate gel over the skull to secure all stainless screws and electrode wires. Ensure the ERG active electrodes are not pulled too tight before securing to enable eye movements.\nClose the head wound using a non-absorbable 3 - 0 suture.\nRotate rodent to expose abdominal area. Lengthen the abdominal dermal incision to 40 mm along the linea alba with surgical scissors.\nMake a 35 mm incision through the inner muscle wall to expose the inner abdominal cavity.\nUsing two sutures (3 - 0) attach the transmitter body to the animal's right hand side inner abdominal wall. Avoid contacting the liver.\nLoop the ground electrode and secure in this shape with a suture (3 - 0). Place it free-floating in the abdominal cavity.\nClose the peritoneum using a continuous suture (3 - 0).Close the skin incision using interrupted sutures (3 - 0).\nPost-operative care\nMonitor the animal until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. House the animal singly following the surgery.\nAdminister carprofen subcutaneously for analgesia (5 mg/kg) once a day for 4 days.\nAdd prophylactic oral antibiotics (Enrofloxin, 5 mg/kg) to the drinking water for 7 days post-surgery.\nApply an anti-inflammatory ointment to skin incision sites to reduce irritation for the first 7 days post-surgery.\n3. Conduct ERG and VEP Recordings in Conscious Rats\u00a0\nDark adapt animal for 12 hr prior to ERG and VEP recordings\nConduct all experimental manipulations under dim red illumination (17.4 cd.m-2, \u03bbmax = 600 nm)\nApply topical anesthesia (0.5% proxymetacaine) and dilating (0.5% tropicamide) drops to the cornea.\nGuide the conscious rodent into a custom made, clear restrainer.\n\tNote: The length of this plastic tube can be adjusted to accommodate different sized rats with the overall diameter fixed at 60 mm. The front end of the device is tapered to minimize head movement and contains perforations to enable normal breathing. This tapered front allows alignment and stabilization of the rat's head and eyes to the opening of the Ganzfeld sphere. Note that the rodent has been acclimatized to the restrainer (3 to 5 occasions) prior to surgery.\nPlace the rodent in front of the Ganzfeld bowl with the eyes aligned with the opening of the bowl.\nTurn on indwelling transmitter by passing a magnet within ~ 5 cm of the transmitter. Verify that the transmitter is on by checking the LED status light on the receiver base.Collect signals over a range of luminous energies (i.e., -5.6 to 1.52 log cd.s.m-2) as described previously21. Briefly, average more signals at the dimmer light levels (~ 80 repeats) and less at the brighter luminous energies (~ 1 repeat). Gradually lengthen the interstimulus interval from 1 to 180 seconds from dimmest to the brightest light level.\nTo isolate the ERG rod and cone responses utilize a twin-flash paradigm8. For example, initiate two flashes at 1.52 log cd.s.m-2 with a 500 msec inter-stimulus interval in-between.\nTo record VEP signals, average 20 repeats at the brighter luminous energies (i.e., 1.52 log cd.s.m-2, 5 sec inter-stimulus interval).\nTo evaluate implant stability, which is assessed by signal variability over time, conduct ERG and VEP recordings 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days post-surgery.\nFollowing experimental period, euthanize rats via intracardial injection of pentobarbiturate (1.5 ml/kg) after ketamine:xylazine anesthesia (12:1 mg/kg).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "The protocol follows the guidelines of Tel-Aviv University Helsinki human research ethics committee.\n1. Word Selection and Matching \nCreate lists of words for each word category of interest. For example, make lists of generally emotional words (e.g., HATE, POX), concern relevance words (e.g., RAPE, VICTIM), and neutral words that are preferably orthographic neighbors21 of the emotional/concern relevant words (e.g., GATE, BOX). Create lists with as many words as possible as not all of these words will be used; a smaller subset of matched words will later be selected.\u00a0\n\t\nWhen deemed necessary, verify the valence/emotionality/arousal of the words by a questionnaire rating the words on a rating scale (e.g., from 1 to 7). Attempt to select words that are at the extreme end of the scale. If comparing emotional words with positive words, attempt to include words that are matched on (absolute) emotionality and arousal scores.\nWrite for each word on the lists, its length in characters as well as its estimated frequency in the appropriate language (for English words, use log hyperspace analogue to language (HAL) frequency22) in order to match the word lists on lexical factors.\n\tNOTE: This is important as these variables can also affect color naming latency (e.g., 21, 23). Arguably, the most important lexical attributes to control are word frequency, length, and if possible orthographic neighborhood (which naturally intersect with length).\n\ttable:\n\ufeff0,1,2,3,4,5\n,Emotional,,,Neutral,\nWord,Length,Frequency,Word,Length,Frequency\nhate,4,10.7,gate,4,9.7\ndead,4,11.2,dear,4,10.29\npoor,4,10.9,pool,4,9.7\nsnake,5,8.6,shake,5,8.6\ngloom,5,8.1,bloom,5,8.2\nbomb,4,9.64,comb,4,7.39\npox,3,7.1,box,3,12.1\n,,,,,\nAverage,4.1,9.4,Average,4.1,9.4\nTable1: Example of a List of Words Matched on Length, Orthographic Neighborhood, and Average Frequency.\nSelect words by adding pairs each time that match in length and frequency, and that are orthographic neighbors of one another (for example replace one of the emotional word letters with another to form a neutral orthographic neighbor, (see Table 1).If a complete match is not possible, balance the bias of frequency in the subsequent pairs of words by adding a pair of words with a small gap in frequency in the opposite direction of the gap formed by the previous pair of words. Ensure that the final lists of matched words contain 20 - 50 words in each word category in order to have a minimum of 20 trials in a block to collect sufficient data and avoid repetition of words and hence habituation3.\n\t\tNOTE: If many words are difficult to obtain, it is possible to introduce some repetition of words. However try to keep repetitions to a minimum as it may dilute the ESE due to habituation3.\nCheck that the final list is matched as much as possible on all lexical variables (e.g., word frequency, word length). Perform a statistical validation (student's t-test) to confirm that the final lists do not differ significantly from each other on frequency.\n2. Preparation of Experimental Design\nSelect the design: Blocked (the stimuli are presented in separate blocks of trials defined by word valence) or mixed (the stimuli are presented in one block in which emotion and neutral words are intermixed in the same list).\n\t\nChoose a blocked design if seeking to test global effects at the level of the word category.\n\t\tNOTE: Effect sizes are usually higher in a blocked design than in a mixed presentation4, 5. Therefore, blocked design is often the favored method of presentation.\nChoose a mixed design if seeking to decompose the ESE at the individual word level and for \"fast\" and \"slow\" effects, as a negative item can affect not only its own naming (the ESE) but also that of the immediately following item. Consequently, the former is dubbed 'fast effect,' the latter 'slow effect'24, 25.In a blocked experimental design, select a fixed or counterbalanced/randomized order of blocks.\n\t\nFor a counterbalanced order present the two possible order of blocks to different groups of participants:\n\t\tGroup A: Neutral Block - Emotional Block\n\t\tGroup B: Emotional Block - Neutral Block\n\t\tNOTE: In this balanced design, an ESE is expected to emerge only in the group performing in the first order due to sustained effects in the group performing in the second order (see Figure 4)3. We therefore suggest using a fixed presentation of blocks.\nFor a fixed order of blocks present first the neutral block then the emotional block, and if desired present an additional new neutral block flowing the emotional block in order to examine sustained effects: Neutral Block 1 - Emotional Block - Neutral Block 2.\n\t\tNOTE: In this setup, two effects can be observed. The first is the canonical ESE, calculated as the difference in performance between the emotional block and the first neutral block. A second is a sustained effect, obtained by subtracting the mean latency of the second neutral block from that of the first neutral block. A positive difference indicates the presence of sustained effects brought about by the emotional block.\n\t\t\nIn order to rule out confounding through training or fatigue, advisably perform an auxiliary experiment with several blocks of neutral items only.\n\t\t\tNOTE: With three blocks of 40 neutral words, no residual fatigue is expected (see Figure 3)3. If there are more than 40 words per block, or more experimental blocks, it may be necessary to control for effects of fatigue by counterbalancing block order (but check for order-of-blocks effects in the statistical analysis).\n3. Experimental Programing and Randomization\nChoose a computer software or programing language to serve as a vehicle to present the stimuli and measure the participant's responses.Optionally, use the commercially available DirectRT software which is relatively easy to deploy and reliable. See Supplemental Code File for a DirectRT executable excel file as an example for a typical programed ESE experiment. Some additional software packages are SuperLab and E-prime, which are also suitable alternatives for governing the experiment.\nSelect the method of responding: manual or oral. Both types of responding are appropriate.\n\t\nFor keyboard activated responding, use a longer training session in order for the participant to learn the mapping of keys onto the ink colors (of about 20 - 40 trials).\nFor vocal responding use a shorter training session (of 4 - 8 trials). Set the reaction time to be measured from the outset of the stimulus to the first phoneme said.\n\t\tNOTE: Vocal responses pose difficulties at the stage of deciphering the responses (one must listen to the recordings and classify errors). However, a new algorithm that mechanically classifies the vocal recordings can render actual human classification gratuitous26. An advantage of oral responses is that the resulting auditory files can be further analyzed (via other dedicated programs) for vocal parameters associated with emotion3.\nChoose the ink-colors to be assigned to the words (e.g., the colors blue, green, red, and purple). Use easily discriminable colors against a well contrasted background (e.g., white or grey). If key-press responding is used, use no more than 4 colors, so that the mapping of colors to the keys is easily mastered.\n\tNOTE: If vocal responding is used, it is possible to use many more colors. Recall though that with a computer algorithm to classify the data, voice-identification errors increase with the number of colors (= responses).\nUse an easily legible font, and size for the words.Since the preferred approach is to use no repetition of words, assign to each word a single color randomly by the computer program for every participant.\nPresent each word singly around the middle of the computer screen. Optionally, introduce a small amount of spatial uncertainty, so that each word is presented in a random different position approximately 50 pixels around the center (e.g., see Supplemental Code File). This is done in order to discourage participants focusing on a small section of the word (thus circumventing reading).\nPrepare a short training block to familiarize the participant with the task and the stimuli. For vocal responding, a few trials using the word 'example' in each of the experimental colors may suffice (with computerized identification of data, a whole session is needed to train the voice-identification algorithm); for key-press responding, as many as 20 - 40 trials may be necessary to master the mapping of the colors.\nFollowing training, present the experimental blocks (e.g., three blocks of neutral-emotional and neutral words). Introduce short breaks between successive blocks of trials (of say, 30-60 seconds each). Do not allow the next block to begin before the designated interval for the break has elapsed as participants tend to rush through the experiment in order to finish it quickly.\nPrepare the task instructions. At the start of each block, present the following instruction 'Respond to the ink color of the word as quickly and accurately as possible.' Avoid mentioning word reading, or that the word should be ignored as this request may artificially augment reading the words (see ironic process theory, e.g., 27).\nSpecify the inter-trial or inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between experimental trials of a stimulus and the successive stimulus. Typically use an ISI of 500 msec (in blocked presentation).NOTE: Short ISI may promote shorter responses than longer ISI and carry over-effects with emotion items have been reported for ISI up to 1,000 msec24.\nOptional: Add an anxiety questionnaire at the end of the experiment or in a separate session. This provides for a baseline measure of the participant's anxiety, such as the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI)28.\n4. Subject Selection and Preparation\nOnce programing is completed, recruit participants preferably from the same age-group and background. Participants can enroll for course credit, for pay, or on a voluntary basis.\nMake sure participants are native speakers of the language used in the study, and do not have any attention deficits or color blindness.\nGuide the participant to a quiet room in front of a computer. Explain the task instructions and ask the participant to read additional instructions written on the computer screen.\n5. Data and Statistical Analysis\nAs a rule, perform reaction time analyses with respect to correct responses only. Also, exclude extreme responses.\n\t\nTypically, exclude responses faster or smaller than 2.5 SD around the mean. Nevertheless, be careful not to discard more than 5% of the data. Error rates are typically small, but it is still advisable to compare them across conditions and rule out a speed-accuracy tradeoff.\nWith a fixed presentation order, perform planned comparisons (or a student's t-test, if only two blocks are administered) with a designated statistical software such as SPSS or STATISTICA (here instructions are given for STATISTICA). For testing of the ESE, compare the emotion block with the first neutral block. For sustained effects compare the second neutral block (which followed the emotional block) with the first neutral block.\n\t\nPerform planned comparisons by choosing -Statistics->Advanced Linear/Non-Linear Models->General Linear Models->More results -> Planed comps.When the order of blocks is counterbalanced across participants, perform an ANOVA with Block Valence as a within-subject factor and Order of Blocks as a between-subject factor.\n\t\nPerform ANOVA by choosing -Statistics->Advanced Linear/Non-Linear Models->General Linear Models.\nSubscription Required.

LCM depends on histological features for sample preparation and requires multiple steps which could degrade RNA molecules very easily. Therefore, it is important to fix sample properly and quickly to minimize morphological distortion and sample deterioration.\nHarvest radish roots from the soil, wash them with tap water, and dry them off with paper towel.\nCut root into a large piece using a kitchen knife, and trim into tissue blocks of approximately 1.2\u00d71.2\u00d71.2\u00a0cm3 in size using a razor blade (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A\u20131C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/189-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01. Radish Root Tissue Block Preparation, Sample Fixation, Dehydration and Infiltration\n(A) A whole tap root from a 9-week old radish plant was collected and washed, and then a ~1.2\u00a0cm thick cross-section was cut out for the next steps.\n(B and C) (B) The root epidermis was peeled and tissue blocks of maximum 1.2\u00d71.2\u00d71.2\u00a0cm3 were excised and shown in (C). Each tissue block included cambium layer and surrounding tissues (cortex on the phloem side and parenchyma on the xylem side). Dashed rectangle denotes a tissue block. Scale bars in (B) and (C), 1\u00a0cm.\n(D) The tissue blocks were immediately transferred to chilled Farmer\u2019s fixative solution in a 50\u00a0mL conical tube, dehydrated with ethanol, and infiltrated with Steedman\u2019s wax. For visualization, tissue blocks infiltrated in 25% Steedman\u2019s wax after 0 h, 1 h, and 3\u00a0h were shown. Red arrows in (D) point to tissue blocks.\nSee also Methods Videos S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].Critical: We recommend preparing for tissue blocks longer than 7\u00a0mm and less than 1.2\u00a0cm on each side. This is because \u223c2\u00a0mm of the block height should be trimmed off before collecting sections for LCM. In our hands, tissue sections exposed to the outside gave poor quality of RNA with a RIN less than 7.0. Trimming off the outer part and using the inner sections for LCM greatly enhanced RNA quality. Even though the block size can depend on the target tissue area or the radish root size used for sampling, we recommend not to make a tissue block too big (i.e., >1.2\u00a0cm each side). Making a tissue block too big results in poor RNA quality due to incomplete fixation and wax infiltration.\nNote: We suggest trimming off one side of the opposite phase of the LCM to mark a block orientation. It helps positioning a tissue block in the mold in a right orientation.\nPlace dissected root tissue blocks immediately into ice-cold Farmer\u2019s fixative (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nIncubate samples at 4\u00b0C for 3 h. During the incubation, mix samples by inverting the tube about five times every hour.\nReplace with fresh cold Farmer\u2019s fixative and incubate at 4\u00b0C for at least 12 h.\nNote: Make sure that the fixative is chilled completely before use. A 20-min ice incubation is usually enough for a small volume (e.g., 45\u00a0mL) of fixative, but incubation time can be extended depending on the amount of fixative prepared.\nCritical: Preparing for tissue blocks should be performed quickly to minimize RNA degradation. Transfer each trimmed tissue block into cold fixative immediately rather than waiting for others to be fixed altogether.Critical: The volume of fixative should be at least ten times the volume of the tissue prepared. For instance, for an amount of 45\u00a0mL of fixative, fill tissue blocks up to 5\u00a0mL mark of a 50\u00a0mL tube.\nDehydration and Infiltration \u2013 Day 2\nTiming: \u223c7 h\nSteps 6 to 8 describe how to remove water from tissue, and fill the tissue spaces with embedding medium to provide a firm support during the process of microtome sectioning.\nDehydrating tissue blocks (\u223c4 h).\nReplace Farmer\u2019s fixative with 45\u00a0mL of 75% ice-cold ethanol, mix by inverting the tube about five times, and incubate on ice for 15\u00a0min.\nRepeat step 6a additional three times.\nReplace with 45\u00a0mL of ice-cold 90% ethanol, mix well by inverting the tube about five times, and incubate at 4\u00b0C for 1 h.\nReplace with 45\u00a0mL of ice-cold absolute ethanol, mix well by inverting the tube about five times, and place the tube at 4\u00b0C for 1 h.\nReplace with 45\u00a0mL of 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C-stored absolute ethanol, mix well by inverting the tube about five times, and place the tube at 40\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h to gradually raise the sample temperature to 40\u00b0C.\nInfiltrating Steedman\u2019s wax (\u223c3 h).\nReplace absolute ethanol with 45\u00a0mL of 25% Steedman\u2019s wax, mix well by inverting the tube about five times, incubate at 40\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h (tissue blocks should drop to the bottom) (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nReplace with 45\u00a0mL of 50% Steedman\u2019s wax, mix well by inverting the tube several times, and incubate at 40\u00b0C for at least 12 h.Note: You can continue and finish step 8 on Day 2. In that case, incubate samples in 50% Steedman\u2019s wax in step 7b for 2\u00a0h or until the tissue blocks drop to the bottom of the tube.\nCritical: The time required for infiltration is dependent on the block size and the tissue characteristics such as density and size of constituting cells. Check the speed of the fall of tissue blocks in the embedding medium when the tube is turned upside down. Well-infiltrated\u00a0samples drop immediately to the bottom of the tube when flipped (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1.

Embedding, Sectioning and Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) of Radish Root Tissue Samples\n(A) An infiltrated tissue block in a mold filled with 100% Steedman\u2019s wax. The sample orientation is shown in the bottom of the image. The image was taken from the side of sample which was subsequently attached to the embedding cassette. Once, the embedded tissue block was solidified and the surrounding wax was trimmed, the tissue block was placed on a rotary microtome for sectioning.\n(B) A ribbon of tissue with 20\u00a0\u03bcm thickness was sectioned and mounted on a PEN membrane slide and dried in a 50\u00a0mL conical tube.\n(C) Laser Capture Microdissection using an Arcturus Veritas system. A UV laser was used to define the tissue areas corresponding to cambium, phloem cortex, and xylem parenchyma, which were subsequently microdissected (see Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPlace and arrange the orientation of tissue blocks in a mold.\nFill up the mold with 100% Steedman\u2019s wax.\nSolidify at 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C for about 3 h.\nStore at 4\u00b0C in an air-tight container for at least 12 h.\nPause Point: The embedded tissue blocks can be stored at 4\u00b0C for up to a week.Optional: It is not comfortable to handle tissue blocks in a conical tube. Set heating plate to 50\u00b0C prior to use. Samples can be transferred to a wide-mouth container such as an aluminum foil boat, and place on the heating plate for easy access. You still need to work very quickly not to let the tissue block be solidified.\nNote: When multiple tissue blocks are placed in a single mold, arrange them parallel in the same orientation. CapSure Cap used for the LCM step has a limited space (circular, 5\u00a0mm in diameter). If the region of interest of your sample has a specific orientation, that will help to line up multiple cell files within a small capture area. It will also maximize RNA yield.\nCritical: You must work quickly, placing the samples in the mold before the wax starts to solidify.\nTissue Sectioning \u2013 Day 5\nTiming: \u223c2 h\nIn this step, an embedded tissue block is cut into thin sections on a microtome and mounted on PEN membrane slides.\nEquilibrate a tissue block at 22\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C for 1 h.\nSectioning the tissue block (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTrim the surrounding edges using a razor blade.\nPlace the block on the rotary microtome, set thickness setting at 20\u00a0\u03bcm, and trim the block until you reach and get a full face of the tissue.\nTrim off additional 100\u2013150 sections.\nMake a ribbon of tissue sections with 20\u00a0\u03bcm thickness.\nCritical: Trim off 2\u20133\u00a0mm of the outer part of the tissue block. In our experience, RNA extracted from the outer margin of a tissue block mostly has severe degradation.Note: Sample section thickness can be adjusted differently. Thin section results in low RNA yield. On the other hand, a thick section may not be properly captured on the LCM cap. LCM is commonly performed with section thickness of 2\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm. 20\u00a0\u03bcm sections used for radish tap root had been successively captured using the settings on step 16. For other section thicknesses, UV cutting and IR wetting need to be optimized accordingly. Thick sections may also require multiple UV cutting with a high power setting. RNA degradation may occur with repeated exposure to UV laser in the region close to the cutting paths.\nNote: When you mount tissue sections on the PEN membrane slide, place them in the middle membrane coated part of the slide. Tissues on the edges of the slide cannot be captured. If you look at the membrane slide by slightly turning up and down, you can easily tell a rectangular area in the middle where the angle of light reflection is different from the other part of the slide.\nMounting embedded tissue on a slide (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace a suitable length of ribbon sections on a membrane slide.\nPlace DEPC-treated water underneath the sample ribbon to stretch and straighten the sample sections.\nWick away excess water using autoclaved filter paper or Kimwipes.\nNote: Remove excess water carefully not to disturb sample arrangement.\nOptional: You could use regular glass slides for mounting dissected tissues and perform LCM using IR laser. However, membrane slides allow dissecting and capturing large area at once using UV and IR laser, which can save tissue processing time and increase capture efficiency greatly.\nPlace the slide in an air-tight container containing silica balls and dry them for at least 12 h.Critical: Wick away excess water from the sample slide as much as you can before placing it into a container with silica balls. It is critical to completely dry the tissue samples on the membrane slide.\nCritical: Silica balls and debris should not touch the sample area. They stick to sample easily and interfere sample transfer to CapSure LCM cap. Use silica balls without dust particles or any small debris. If you use a 50\u00a0mL conical tube, fill up with silica balls carefully to a lower level than the conical part (i.e., below the 5\u00a0mL mark). Membrane glass slide fits only in the cylinder part of a 50\u00a0mL tube.\nNote: We recommend for LCM without delay. Although dried tissue sections might preserve RNAs in an air-tight container, RNAs in thin sections are more prone to degradation by RNases in the air or spontaneous oxidation than those in tissue blocks.\nLCM and RNA Extraction \u2013 Day 6\nTiming: \u223c2.5 h\nThis section describes how to perform LCM to isolate a tissue region of interest, and subsequently extract RNA from the captured tissue (Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).

Wet tissue samples would not be captured on the Capsure LCM caps.\nCollecting tissue samples using LCM (\u223c1 h).\nLoad CapSure LCM caps and sample slides on the slide station.\nSetup parameters of the laser (see note below).\nHighlight regions of interest using drawing tools.\nFill the sampling area in the CapSure LCM cap by cutting and capturing the highlighted area (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nUnload the CapSure LCM caps after tissue capture and move on to the next step immediately.\nCritical: Finish tissue capturing within 2 h. We normally finish sampling within 1 h. A small amount of nuclease in the air would degrade RNA in your sample.Note: We used IR laser setting (power: 97 mv, pulse: 7,500\u00a0\u03bcs, No of hit: 3, intensity 200\u00a0mV) and UV laser power 87.00. The settings may need to be optimized for each sample slide. Try test firing of the IR and UV lasers to check the laser focus and wetting in a blank area. To ensure capturing large areas (e.g., larger than about 1\u00a0mm), we added more than three points of IR capture laser marks in multiple positions in addition to the points marked automatically.\nNote: CapSure Macro LCM cap provides a circular sampling space with 5\u00a0mm in diameter. If possible, dissect the areas of interests similar in shape to maximize the amount of sample collected and the yield of RNA.\nNote: Detailed instructions for the LCM and software operation are available in the instrument user guide provided by the manufacturer.\nExtracting RNA using PicoPure RNA isolation kit (\u223c1 h).\nInsert CapSure LCM cap on a 0.5\u00a0mL tube filled with 50\u00a0\u03bcL of Extraction Buffer and incubate the tube in inverted position at 42\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min.\nAdd 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 70% ethanol and mix well.\nPass the cell extract mixture through an activated RNA purification column from the kit.\nWash the spin column with 100\u00a0\u03bcL of Wash Buffer 1 by centrifuging at 8,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 1\u00a0min.\nAdd DNase I solution mixture directly onto the spin column membrane and incubate for 15\u00a0min.\nWash the spin column twice with Wash Buffer 2 by centrifuging at 16,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 2\u00a0min.\nElute with 11\u00a0\u03bcL of Elution Buffer.\nAliquot 2\u00a0\u03bcL for bioanalyzer analysis and store the remaining RNA at \u221280\u00b0C until use.

A trivial set of features can be obtained by concatenating the gene-expression profiles of the TF and gene in a given pair (Ni et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-bib-0010]). However, such a representation does not consider the relationship between the expression of the putative target and TF in a given experiment. Here, we provide the means to extract transcriptomics features representative for a TF-gene pair.\nMaterials\nExpression of genes monitored over different developmental and environmental conditions (perturbation experiments) or over time (time-resolved experiments). Gene-expression values are usually represented in a table, Expn\u00d7p, where n denotes the number of genes, p stands for the number of experiments (e.g., conditions or time points), and the entity Expi,j, denotes the expression level of gene i in experiment j.\n1. Scale the expression profiles of TFs and genes by their respective maximum expression values (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-fig-0002]).\nThe scaled expression values provide the coordinates for a point representation of a TF-gene pair in each experiment.\nThe following code snippet scales the expression profile of Exp (Equation 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-disp-0001]):\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/fc2383a5-a162-4397-8157-6e4fae2e7f8b/cppb20106-math-0001.png\n2. Determine the Euclidean distance between every two experiments based on the point representation (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-fig-0002]).\nThe result is represented by a symmetric p \u00d7 p matrix for every TF-gene pair.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/46931959-a5ec-4707-a0d2-12811fae3660/cppb20106-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2Steps of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0001]. An example of expression profiles (A) of a transcription factor (TF) and a gene (G) over four samples that are scaled by the respective maximum expression in the second step (B). The scaled expression profiles for a pair of TF-genes are represented in the unit square (C), and in the second step the Euclidean distance for each pair of experiments is determined based on the point representation. The feature (D) for the TF-gene pairs is obtained in the third step by vectorizing the upper triangular matrix (excluding the diagonal as non-informative).\n3. Obtain the features of the TF-gene pair by the vectorized form of the resulting Euclidean distance matrix obtained from step 2 (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-fig-0002]).\nEvery TF-gene pair is presented by p(p \u22121)/2 features.\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/60817ece-c646-4e9f-8f84-8dcd1a2b5569/cppb20106-math-0002.png\nSteps 2 and 3 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0001] are implemented in lines 98-146 of the code (https://github.com/MonaRazaghi/GRADIS/blob/master/GRADIS_neg.m[href=https://github.com/MonaRazaghi/GRADIS/blob/master/GRADIS_neg.m]). These lines determine the Euclidean distance for each TF-gene pair, and vectorize it to form the feature vector.\nThe number of features can be reduced by selection of representative experiments. This can be achieved by clustering the experiments and selecting the cluster representatives as those that are used in the feature extraction presented above.Training a binary classifier requires access to two types of instances, called positive and negative, which in our case correspond to presence or absence of gene regulatory interactions for a given pair of TF and gene. Typically, there is little information available about the absence of gene regulatory interactions between TFs and target genes in real-world datasets. Hence, it is not straightforward to train a classifier, due to the lack of negative instances. We describe a detailed procedure for composing a list of negative instances given knowledge about positive instances, i.e., TF-target gene pairs along with their expression levels.\nMaterials\nHardware\nThe approach can be executed on any computer (e.g., i7 processor and 16 GB RAM) with Windows 7 operating system\nSoftware\nThe only software needed to run the code is Matlab R2017b\nData\nExpression-based features for TF-gene pairs based on the Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0001]\nA list of pairs of interacting TFs and their target genes. These pairs are referred to as positive instances and are obtained from experimentally verified interactions with different technologies.\n               \nPositive instance can be obtained from different databases: for instance, DREAM5 challenge (Marbach et\u00a0al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-bib-0006]), RegulonDB (Gama-Castro et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-bib-0002]), Yeastract (Teixeira et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-bib-0014]), and AGRIS (Yilmaz et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-bib-0016]).\nIf TF-target gene interactions are not verified in the organism of interest, consider transfer of interactions according to homology from model organisms.\n1. Form the class of positive instances of the training data by collecting the available experimentally verified TF-gene interactions.\n2. Consider the remaining TF-gene pairs as uncharacterized, and divide them into subsets of size (almost) equal to that of the positive class (in step 1). Assume that there are k such subsets.3. Treat one of these subsets, i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, as a negative class and use it together with the positive class to train an SVM specific to subset i.\n4. Treat the uncharacterized TF-gene pairs in all but the i-th subset as test data and assess them by the built SVM classifier.\n5. Aggregate the individual classifiers for each of the k subsets to form the set of negative instances.\nFor a given uncharacterized TF-gene pair, the aggregation amounts to counting the number of classifiers that classify the pair as positive. A lower count would correspond to a higher likelihood that the TF-gene pair is negative. The class of negative instances is composed of those TF-gene pairs whose count is zero.\nThe implementation for Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0002] can be found in the lines 151-189 of the code (https://github.com/MonaRazaghi/GRADIS/blob/master/GRADIS_neg.m[href=https://github.com/MonaRazaghi/GRADIS/blob/master/GRADIS_neg.m]).\nThe number of negative instances found with this approach is considerably higher than the number of positive ones, resulting in an unbalanced learning problem, to be considered in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0003].Having obtained a labeled training set associated with the feature vectors (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0001], above), an SVM can be trained to find an optimal hyperplane that separates the two classes. The training set consists of m TF-gene pairs p1, p2, \u2026, pm, each of which belong to either of the two positive and negative classes, respectively denoted by +1 and \u22121. Following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0002], the negative class of TF-gene pairs is considerably bigger than the positive. Here we describe a protocol for overcoming this challenge.\nMaterials\nExpression-based features for TF-gene pairs (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0001])\nPositive and negative classes of TF-gene pairs: the negative class is obtained based on Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0002]\n1. Form the class of positive instances of the training data by collecting the available experimentally verified TF-gene interactions.\n2. Form a class of negative instances of the same size as the class of positive instances by randomly sampling from the negative class instances provided.\n3. Train an SVM with the features and classes from steps 1 and 2.\n4. Predict the class of the uncharacterized TF-gene pairs based on the SVM.\nThe implementation for Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20106#cppb20106-prot-0003] can be found in lines 191-217 of the code (https://github.com/MonaRazaghi/GRADIS/blob/master/GRADIS_neg.m[href=https://github.com/MonaRazaghi/GRADIS/blob/master/GRADIS_neg.m]).\nAverage performance and confidence intervals can be obtained by performing several samplings in step 2, above. We recommend performing at least 10 random samplings of negative instances.", "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Long Island University-Post.\n1. Mixing Acrylic Paints\nMix the eggshell ground coloration, which is the color that will uniformly cover the entire eggshell surface. The following recipe will make 50 g of paint, which will fill a little more than two 22 mL aluminum paint tubes.\n\t\nGenerate a blue-green color, representing a blue-green eggshell (e.g., an American Robin T. migratorius eggshell), using 18.24 g of cobalt turquoise Light, 20.77 g of titanium white 6.52 g of cobalt green, and 2.86 g of cobalt turquoise and 1.61 g of burnt umber.\nGenerate a brown color, representing a brown eggshell (e.g., a chicken Gallus gallus domesticus eggshell), using 4.12 g of red iron oxide, 9.75 g of cadmium orange, 22.15 g of raw umber light, and 13.97 g of titanium white.\nGenerate a beige color, representing a beige eggshell (e.g., a quail Coturnix japonica eggshell), using 10.60 g of brown egg color, 8.28 g of blue-green color, 18.51 g of titanium white, and 12.61 g of yellow ochre.\nGenerate a white color using titanium white without mixing.\nMix a dark brown spot color representing the spots found on quail C. japonica eggs, using 8.38 g of brown egg color, 26.04 g of burnt umber, and 15.59 g of mars black.\nMix intermediate colors spanning the eggshell color gamut from blue-green to brown, by mixing blue-green and brown paints together and varying their contribution reciprocally (e.g., parts of blue-green to brown paint: 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, 3:7, 2:8, 1:9, and 0:10, see Figure 1E).To generate more intermediate colors, simply mix even quantities of these intermediate colors together and repeat until creating the desired number of unique colors. The even mixture of blue-green and brown will produce a neutral gray color, but this color can be adjusted using white or beige as necessary. If a more exact color (e.g., of a specific host egg) is required, use subtractive color mixing models to predict the spectral reflectance of unique combinations of paints and use the mixture producing lowest just noticeable difference (JND) to the desired color (see steps 3.3-3.7).\nStore paint in empty 22 mL aluminum paint tubes.\n\t\nPlace the paint into a plastic sandwich bag with a small portion of one corner cut off. Place the end of the plastic bag into the tube and squeeze the paint into the tube, tapping the tube gently against the table.\nSeal tube using the adhesive edge and folding the end over itself at least 3-4 times.\n2. Painting Experimental Egg Models\nObtain experimental egg models.\n\t\nPrint model eggs using a three dimensional (hereafter, 3D) printer or purchase from a distributor32. This simple approach is recommended because it generates eggs that are of consistent size and shape32.\n\t\tNOTE: Model eggs can also be fashioned from plaster, clay, wood or other substances.\nAdd an even coat of titanium white over each egg to obstruct the underlying color.\nHold each egg using forceps, paint the desired color using high quality acrylic paints and a clean brush to color each egg uniquely.\nUse a hair dryer on a cool setting to speed up the drying process of each freshly painted egg.\nUse a sandpaper to sand down any bumps that may be on the egg once the egg is fully dry.Repeat step 2.3 until the egg has an even coating of paint without any lumps. Eggs require no fewer than two coats.\nAdd any spots to model eggs by carefully applying these with a paintbrush and carefully spattering the paint with a toothbrush. Only a single coat is necessary.\n\tCAUTION: If replication of ultraviolet (UV) reflectance is desired, apply an even coat of UV paint; however, this is not recommended unless permission to use these paints is obtained from institutional, state/provincial, and federal permitting offices.\n3. Quantifying Color\nTurn on the spectrometer by pressing the power button.\nInsert SD card into SD card slot and link it to the system by pressing the red cancel button, select File System by pressing the green accept button, select Find SD Cards by pressing the menu up button. Afterwards, press the red cancel button two times or press the home button.\n\t\nAttach the fiber optic cables to the spectrometer and light source.\nAttach the end labelled Light Source to the light module and attach the end labelled Spectrometer to the spectrometer module.\nInsert the probe tip on the end of the fiber optic probe.\n\tNOTE: An example probe tip printable on a 3D printer is available as a Supplemental Code File. This object will require threading a thumbscrew of your choice.\n\t\nEstablish a distance (e.g., 5 mm) between the sample and the measurement probe that maximizes the signal to noise ratio. Ensure a consistent measurement distance using a flexible ruler.\n\t\tNOTE: The exact distance will vary with each individual spectrometer's unique combination of grating and slit width, optic width, and light source. Maintain the same distance for all measurements. A flexible rule is available for download as a Supplemental Code File.Use a coincident normal measurement angle (90\u00b0), unless the natural host eggs or model eggs have a glossy surface, in which case use a 45\u00b0 coincident oblique measurement angle. Measure all eggs, real and artificial, using the same angle.\nWash the probe tip with 95% ethanol.\nTurn on the light source by pressing the down button three times, select PX-Lamp by pressing the green accept button, select Setup by pressing the scroll right button, select Timing Controls by pressing the scroll right button, click the down button three times, and then select free running by pressing the Accept button.\n\t\nWait for at least 15 min before taking any measurements.\nCalibrate and configure the spectrometer. To do this, press the home button, then select Tools by pressing the scroll left button, select Manual Control by pressing the menu up button, and select Acquire Parameters by pressing the menu up button.\n\t\nSet boxcar smoothing to five by pressing the scroll right button, moving the cursor to the right two spaces by pressing the scroll right button twice, and then increasing the boxcar setting by pressing the menu up button five times. Select Accept by pressing the green accept button once complete.\nSet averages to 10 by pressing the menu down button, then moving to the right two places by pressing the scroll right button twice and adjusting the value in the tens place by pressing the menu up button once and moving to the ones place by pressing the scroll right button once and reducing this to zero by pressing the menu down button once. Select Accept by pressing the green accept button once complete.Press the home button, select Reflectance by pressing the menu up button, and place the probe firmly on the white standard. Then store a reference white standard by pressing the menu up button. Store a dark standard by pressing the scroll right button and view the reflectance by pressing the menu down button.\nMeasure each eggshell's reflectance six times by measuring twice near the blunt pole (wide end of egg), twice at the egg's equator, and twice near the sharp pole (narrower end). Be sure to report whether spots are avoided or not. Conduct this on both experimental eggs as well as the host's eggs.\nUse a locally weighted polynomial function with a 0.25 nm smoothing span to smooth noise in reflectance curves, using color analysis software33. If color scores, such as brightness, are not significantly repeatable between the regions of the egg model (step 3.7), repaint the egg (steps 2.2. - 2.6); otherwise, average the egg model coloration across the egg.\nDecide on the most appropriate set of relative photoreceptor sensitivities for the question.\n\tNOTE: This may be a generic ultraviolet sensitive or violet sensitive bird, or once can choose to model relative sensitivities34,35,36.\nQuantify quantum catches37 for each photoreceptor, both single38 and double cones39,40, by integrating the product of eggshell reflectance, photoreceptor sensitivities, and an appropriate irradiance spectrum across the avian visual spectrum (i.e., 300-700 nm).\n\t\nUse relative quantum catch estimates to generate coordinates within the avian tetrahedral color space37,41. Ensure that, unlike quantum catches, these relative quantum catches sums to 1.\nUse quantum catches (step 3.10) to estimate the discriminability, in JND, between host eggshell color (see step 2.6.1) and the perceived colors of each foreign egg using a neural noise-limited visual model36,42,43.Measure the host's own eggshell coloration using the same spectrometer and light source used to measure the model eggs (step 3.7), if possible.\n\t\tNOTE: Practical or logistical considerations may make this impossible, in which case measure a subset of host eggs from different nests to establish an average host eggshell coloration.\nUse a Weber fraction for the long-wave-sensitive cone of 0.144.\nAccount for the relative abundance of cones and the principal member of the double cone34.\n\t\tNOTE: If the egg colors used are only on a gradient corresponding to natural eggshell colors, the JND between the host and experimental egg can be multiplied by either 1 or \u22121 to differentiate differences on either extreme (e.g., blue-green or brown, see steps 1.1.1-1.1.2). If egg colors used fall across multiple gradients or fill the color space, summarize the perceivable color differences between eggs using perceptually uniform chromaticity diagrams45. The coordinates within this type of diagram describes both the direction and magnitude of perceived color differences between experimental eggs and host egg color and these can be used in further analyses.\n4. Field Work\nDetermine the species to study.\n\tNOTE: Factors to consider include (but are not limited to) the abundance of the host and/or parasite species and whether the host is a grasp46 or puncture47 rejecter, which will impact the type of egg to be used (e.g., do not use hard artificial model eggs for puncture ejectors48).\nSystematically search for nests in the study area. Check previous nesting records that can provide a reasonable starting place in some species49.\n\tNOTE: Visible markers or flagging can increase the risk of predation50; therefore, consider using a handheld GPS instead.Monitor those nests daily using direct or video recording methods to record the presence of each host egg until the start of the experiment (step 4.4); for example, one day after clutch completion.\n\tNOTE: This daily monitoring will continue until the experiment has concluded (step 4.6).\n\t\nListen for alarm calls made by adults and leave the area if they continue for more than 30 s. Do not approach a nest when any potential nest predator is present, especially if it is a visually oriented predator (e.g., corvid).\nApproach and leave nests from different locations, i.e., walk past nests, so mammalian predators cannot follow chemical cues directly to nests.\n\t\tNOTE: This approach may be unfeasible in some habitats, namely dense reed-beds.\nAlways minimize the physical disturbance to the nest and the area around the nest.\nDo not get close to nests during nest-building period, because many birds will abandon the nests if they are disturbed prior to egg-laying50.\nGently add an experimental egg to a host's nest by sliding it into the side of the nest's cup. Do not drop the experimental models as it can damage the host's eggs.\n\tNOTE: Assign treatments randomly.\n\t\nRecord if the host parent remains nearby and thus has an opportunity to witness the act of artificial parasitism51. Record and statistically control for a variable indicating whether the host was flushed from the nest51. Conduct egg introductions while the parent is away.\nCollect a host egg if the parasite in the system removes a host egg.\n\t\tNOTE: This may not be necessary in hosts where egg removal does not affect host responses to experimental eggs22.Employ a set of control nests (nests which are visited, checked and eggs handled but no experimental egg is added or swapped) to determine the natural nest desertion rates. Remove a host egg from the control nest only if they are removed from the experimental nests (see step 4.5.1).\n\tNOTE: This is crucial because desertion may not be a response targeted to certain foreign eggs but may be a response for other egg types.\n\t\nChoose the number of control nests a priori based upon the known or expected sample sizes and estimated effect. Assign every nth\u00a0nest as a control nest until statistical determination of whether nest desertions are a host response to experimental eggs or not can be obtained (step 5.1).\n\t\tNOTE: If a host egg is removed, remove the same number of host eggs as in the experimental treatment, hold one host egg in the hand for 5 s and then replace it, and remain at nest for the same length of time as treatment nests. If host eggs are not removed, hold one host egg in the hand for 5 s and then replace it, remain at the nest for the amount of time spent at experimental nests (e.g., 10 s).\nRevisit the nest enough to determine the response at each host's nest, including controls. Check the nest within a few hours of the experimental manipulation.\n\tNOTE: In some species, rejections may occur on the same day as experimental parasitism; therefore, it is important to check the nest within a few hours of the experimental manipulation52.\n\t\nUse a telescopic mirror when checking the nest to avoid the direct contact with either the nest or the clutch.\nAvoid observations in severe weather (rain, heat, or cold) because this can increase the danger to the nestlings and the eggs50.Perform daily checks until the host has responded to the introduced egg or a certain amount of time has passed.\n\t\tNOTE: By convention, if the egg remains in the nest for 5-6 days, the host is considered an acceptor22; however, some host individuals respond even later53 and omission of such responses necessarily biases egg rejection rate estimates. Ideally, researchers should determine the upper 95% family-wise confidence interval of latency to rejection in their system and use this as their criterion.\n5. Statistical Analyses\nUse a Fisher's exact test in a perfectly randomized study (i.e., experimental and control nests are perfectly interspersed and thus do not differ in laying date, clutch or any other parameter known to affect nest desertion) to compare the number of desertions between control (step 4.5) and treatments nests. Otherwise, use a generalized linear model (GLM) with potentially relevant covariates (see below), as a generally more cautious approach.\n\t\nIf experimental nests have a significantly higher desertion rate than control nests, code both removed eggs and abandoned eggs as 'rejected'.\n\t\tNOTE: By convention the host has 'rejected' the egg when it has recognized the parasitic egg and either removed it or abandoned it (with the whole nest).\nIf desertion rates do not differ between experimental and control nests, exclude desertions from the analysis, because they are not a host response to parasitism and code responses as 'ejected'.\n\t\tNOTE: By convention, 'ejected' refers to when an egg has actually been removed from its nest.\nRecord the date and time when the host has rejected the egg. Recode the response variable depending on your finding on steps 5.1.1 - 5.1.2.\nReport the Fisher's exact test, its associated odds ratio, and its appropriate confidence interval.\nDecide on any meaningful covariates that will be added to predictive models (e.g., steps 5.4-5.5).Specify the coding (e.g., continuous, categorical, or ordinal) of each covariate.\nCode dates as ordinal days and center dates separately within years to remove any potential confound due to variation attributable to years or seasonality7,51,54,55.\nCenter any covariates involved in an interaction to allow for easier interpretation of their lower order terms in model output.\n\t\tNOTE: Scaling covariates allows straightforward comparison of effects between studies and sometimes can improve model convergence.\nPredict host responses (either eject or reject vs accept) using a generalized linear model (GLM) or a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a binomial error distribution and logit link function.\n\tNOTE: The choice between a GLM or GLMM depends on the data, and if including a random effect (e.g., nest ID, year). Random factors should have at least 5 levels otherwise variances are likely to be poorly estimated56.\n\t\nReport the coefficient of determination (usually R2) to show what proportion of the variance was explained by a linear model57,58.\nPredict how long it takes the bird to respond to experimental parasitism using a GLM with a negative binomial error distribution (or a Poisson error distribution if the data are not overdispersed) and log link.\n\tNOTE: Researchers refer to the length of time that it takes for a bird to respond as 'latency to response,' which is reported with precision to days, such that eggs rejected on the day of the experiment have a latency of zero. Model response variables with too many zeros (>50%) using zero-inflated or Hurdle models59.\nUse diagnostic tools to check if model predicts the data satisfactorily and report model summary statistic to quantify what proportion of variance model explained60,61. Report coefficient of determination (usually R2), see step 5.4.2.Validate negative binomial models using graphical validation by producing a quantile-quantile plot and plotting Pearson residuals against the fitted values.\n\t\tNOTE: A well-run model will have no outliers or unexpected patterns59.\nValidate binomial models using goodness-of-fit tests such as Hosmer-Lemeshow tests, and other diagnostics available in the R package, 'binomTools'62 containing whole set of diagnostic tools.\nConsider controlling for consistent covariates for the purposes of consistency and comparability between studies.\n\tNOTE: Common covariates would include clutch size22, laying date63, nest age at manipulation53, and whether the host was flushed from the nest or not51. Many, especially early, studies did not use any covariates. Authors should consider additionally analyzing the effects of egg types (or various gradients) without covariates to make their results quantitatively comparable to these studies lacking covariates.\n\t\nUse an information-theoretical approach and report the result of averaging many potential models explaining host behavior64.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, use step-wise regression analysis as a model selection algorithm65. Researchers should use a predefined criterion (e.g., Adjusted R2, Mallows' Cp, Akaike's Information Criterion, Schwarz's BIC, or p-value) and provide both the full model (with common covariates) and a final reduced model.\nSubscription Required.

Preparation of the testing apparatus and flies\nPipette 1 mL of 100% ethanol through the screen mesh into each well.\nDry the screen mesh with a piece of cheesecloth.\nCut two pieces of cheesecloth the dimensions of the cell culture plate using the cardboard template created in step 1.1. Place them on top of the dry screen mesh of the modified cell culture plate containing ethanol from step 3.2.\nCreate a small piece of thin, flexible plastic cutting board by tracing around the cardboard template created in step 1.1 as a general guide and expanding the traced area by 1\u20132 cm on one of the short sides. Cut out the expanded traced area from the thin, flexible plastic cutting board. After cutting, ensure that the plastic still fits between the three wooden craft sticks on the testing apparatus, but hangs off one end by 1\u20132 cm.(Optional) If an aspirator needs to be created, assemble an aspirator like the one shown in Figure 3 by first cutting a P1000 pipette tip in half. Insert the piece with a larger diameter into one end of a ~30 cm piece of flexible tubing to serve as a mouthpiece.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61108/61108fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: A fly aspirator in which flies are collected with an interchangeable mouthpiece attached to flexible tubing and a wide bore serological pipette with a cotton gauze stopper. The operator can aspirate a single fly into the pipette for transfer without anesthesia. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61108/61108fig3large.jpg]\n(Optional) To complete the aspirator assembly, cover the wide end of a 10 cm piece of serological pipette with gauze to prevent flies from getting into the tubing and insert the pipette, gauze first, into the open end of the tubing to serve as a fly chamber. The aspirator should resemble that shown in Figure 3.\nUsing an aspirator (Figure 3, steps 3.5 and 3.6), aspirate one fly per well into a separate 24-well cell culture plate. Use the flexible plastic to cover any wells containing previously aspirated flies. Record the well position and any relevant genotype or phenotype information of each fly.\nHold the flexible plastic flush with the top of the cell culture plate containing the flies to prevent their escape and invert the plate onto the top of the modified cell culture plate with the ethanol. The sheet of flexible plastic should be resting on top of the sheets of cheesecloth. Align the inverted cell culture plate containing flies using the craft sticks to ensure each well with ethanol aligns with each well containing a fly.\nThe experimental setup should resemble Figure 2.\n4. Testing the fliesEnsure the illumination pad is lit at full brightness for maximum visual contrast. Start recording with the video camera.\nTo expose the flies to ethanol, carefully remove the plastic from between the well plate and testing apparatus, taking care not to dislodge the cheesecloth.\nTerminate the video recording once all flies have lost postural control. Once it is suspected that all flies have lost postural control, tap firmly in the center of the plate to ensure that all flies have complete loss of postural control. If there is movement, continue to record. Continue to tap periodically (every 1\u20132 min) until no movement occurs.\n(Optional) To quickly recover the flies, remove only the top plate from the testing apparatus, revealing sedated flies resting on the cheesecloth. Aspirate individual flies into chosen containers for recovery.\nReplace the ethanol in the modified cell culture plates with 1 mL of fresh 100% ethanol at least 1x every hour to control for evaporation and humidification of the ethanol and to maintain consistent ethanol exposure throughout the assay. Dry the screen mesh with cheesecloth.\nRepeat for as many samples as desired.\n\tNOTE: For highest throughput, aspirate the next round of flies into new cell culture plates during the video recording. The protocol can be paused here, as the video recording can be reviewed later.\n5. Determination of fly sedation time\nRecord sedation time for each individual fly by watching the video recording. Sedation time is defined as the moment a fly loses complete postural control and locomotor ability. It is recommended to watch the film in reverse and record the time that the fly begins to move to ensure accuracy.", "All procedures are approved by the McMaster University Animal Care Committee and performed in accordance to guidelines set out by the Canadian Council of Animal Care.\n1. General Procedures\nHabituate mice for 1-2 weeks to an existing 12 hr light/dark cycle (e.g., 8 AM \u2013 8 PM).

Define the parameters of the individual arena by outlining the outer perimeter using the appropriate drawing tool (such as create rectangle/polyline/ellipse).\nNext, add zones of interest by clicking the Add Zone group button and outlining the various zones (e.g., floor, lickometers, food dispenser, climbing mesh etc.) in an identical manner. Add hidden zones for the areas where the mouse cannot be seen (e.g., shelter and running wheel, Figure 2) by clicking the Add Hidden Zone Group button. Ensure that an entry/exit is specified and linked to each hidden zone.Repeat steps 2.4-2.5 for each arena. Perform arena calibration by highlighting Calibration and using the appropriate tool (create calibration scale/axes) to provide arena width and length. Lastly, validate Arena settings by clicking the Validate Arena Settings button.\nHighlight the Trial Control Settings tab and specify start / stop conditions and trial length. Set the start condition to begin when the duration of the center-point exceeds 1 sec in the arena. Manipulate the trial duration by expanding the stop condition box and setting the trial to terminate after a delay, such as 10 hr.\nUnder the Detection Settings tab, highlight the appropriate detection methods (e.g., dynamic subtraction and model-based).\nNext, grab the reference image of the empty arena by clicking the Settings button in the Detection tab and pressing the Grab Current button.\nAdjust the range of contrast such that the center, nose and tail-based detection for each mouse are reliable, accurate and continuous. For albino mice, specify that the mouse is brighter than the background, and darker than the background if using a pigmented strain.\n\t\tNote: The subject size and video sample rate can be changed according to the distance between the overhead camera and the subject, as well as the processing speed of the PC used (e.g., 14.9 frames/sec).\nEnsure all changes are saved before exiting the detection settings module.\nTurn on the interface device, which is responsible for converting recorded analog events from input devices (e.g., interruption of infrared beam, movement of the running wheel etc.) into digital logs.\nData Acquisition\n\tNote: The following software commands are relevant to the custom-made Med PC IV routine (\u201cwizard\u201d) that provides step-by-step input of session parameters (e.g., 10 hr trial duration, mouse ID, group assignment etc.).\n\t\nPlace each mouse into the assigned box.Synchronize video- and event-tracking packages by simultaneously pressing the 'record' buttons.\nLeave the experimental room quietly.\nWhen the recording period expires (e.g., few hours, day, or weeks), remove mice and return them to their home-cages.\nMeasure bottle weights and save all digital recordings on digital media (hard drive, portable USB stick, DVD).\nTransfer raw data to a spreadsheet.\nSave the MPG files for subsequent scoring of infrequent behavioral acts (e.g., stereotypy, seizures).", "Study was approved by the Rutgers Institutional Study Board (IRB) in compliance with the declaration of Helsinki.\n1.

Thus, most of the times no instructions are needed.", "The protocol was approved by the UCL local research ethics committee, approval number CEHP/2014/901.\n1. Instruments Setup Prior to the Participant\u2019s Arrival\nUse video recordings from 3 cameras to analyse \u201creal-world\u201d type tasks (e.g. Shallice and Burgess, 19913):\n\t\nPlace one camera on the experimenter\u2019s chest in order to follow participant\u2019s movements.\nMount the head camera onto the fNIRS shading cap to track where the participant is looking throughout the experiment.\nPrepare and turn on the camera for the second experimenter, who follows the first experimenter and the participant for the entire session.\nClean the fNIRS headset with a sanitizing wipe.\nPlace a 3D digitizer in an appropriate room (e.g., far away from metal objects, walls and floors) and turn it on.\n2. Participant Preparation and fNIRS Probe Placement\nBefore the experiment starts, have the participant sign the consent form.\nUse the 10-20 system (Figure 2) and digitize the optodes and 10-20 standard positions24, 25 to achieve consistent fNIRS headset placement across all the participants:\n\t\nMark with a washable marker the Nasion (Nz, the intersection point between the frontal bone and the nasal bones), Inion (Iz, the occipital protuberance at the back of the scalp) and Left and Right Pre-auricular points (LPA, RPA, the points anterior to the ears in front of the upper end of the tragus) (Figure 2) in agreement with manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nMeasure the Nz-Iz distance over and around the head and the LPA-RPA distance over the head.\nMark with a washable marker the Cz (the intersection point between the Nz-Iz line and the LPA-RPA line, located at the 50% of the Nz-Iz distance and the 50% of the LPA-RPA distance), Fpz (10% of the Nz-Iz distance) and Fz (30% of the Nz-Iz distance) points based on the 10-20 system (Figure 2).Use a headband with holes matching the optodes positions for a more accurate digitizing across participants. Remove hair from the forehead as much as possible using hair clips along the hairline. Place the digitizing headband over the prefrontal cortex accordingly to the Fpz and Fz points: channel 9 in correspondence of the Fpz point and channel 9-channel 8 line aligned to the Fpz-Fz line (Figure 1E).\nDigitize the marked 10-20 reference points and the optodes positions by means of the 3D magnetic digitizer.\nSave the digitized coordinates and use the Spatial Analysis Tool (http://brain-lab.jp/wp/?page_id=52[href=http://brain-lab.jp/wp/?page_id=52]) of the open-source Platform for Optical Topography Analysis Tools (POTATo) software (see the Table of Materials for further information) to register fNIRS data onto a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain template.\nNOTE: The implemented algorithm for the probabilistic registration converts the digitized locations in the real world coordinate system into the MNI coordinate system and then projects and localizes them onto the MNI brain surface (Figure 1E) 26,27.\n\t\nOpen POTATo through the Matlab command P3.\nSelect \u201cSpatial Analysis\u201d from the menu on the main window of the POTATo Graphical User Interface (GUI) and click the \u201cSpatial Analysis\u201d button.\nLoad the digitized coordinates by clicking the \u201cEmpty 10-20\u201d button on the Spatial Analysis Data Viewer window.\nClick the \u201cEmpty MNI\u201d button.\nSelect the 10/20 reference points on the MNI estimation window and start the spatial registration.\nCheck for the correct location of the fNIRS channels on the template brain surface (Figure 1E): check if channel 8 and channel 9 overlap the inter-hemispheric fissure28. If correct, save the channel configuration file for further analyses; otherwise replace the digitizing band re-aligning channels 8 and 9 to the Fpz-Fz line and overlapping channel 9 to Fpz. Then repeat the digitizing procedure.Place the fNIRS headset aligning channels 8 and 9 to the Fpz-Fz line and overlapping channel 9 to Fpz, in agreement with the digitizing headband, and remove the headband (Figure 1B-C). Make sure that the probe is well attached to the participant\u2019s head.\nPlace the shading cap with the head camera mounted on it over the fNIRS headset.\nExplain the experimental rules to the participant. Include device-related precautions (e.g., 'Take as little time as possible without rushing or leaving the experimenter behind (NO running)\u201d) as well as task specific rules (e.g., 'Do not go outside the Queen Square area into neighbouring streets or areas\u201d).\nHave the participant successfully memorize all the rules and go outside to start the experiment.\n3. fNIRS Signals Quality Assessment\nUse the fNIRS system in wireless mode first to visually inspect signals quality on the fNIRS laptop:\n\t\nPress the \u201cPower\u201d button on the portable box and turn on the fNIRS in the wireless mode. Open the fNIRS acquisition software on the fNIRS laptop and establish the connection with the portable box.\nPress the \u201cProbe Adjustment\u201d button to optimize the detectors gain on the base of the detected light.\nCheck the probe adjustment results on the software \u201cProbe Adjustment\u201d window and check if each detector receives enough light from the sources by checking if all the channels are classified as \u201cNormal\u201d. If channels are marked as \u201cStray\u201d or \u201cUnder\u201d, re-place the shading cap and maximize the optodes coupling with the forehead. If channels are marked as \u201cOver\u201d, set the power of the laser source to \u201clow\u201d.\nNOTE: As the lateral channels cover the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in some cases it may be necessary to move the hair off the forehead to maximize the received light.Press the \u201cReady\u201d button and then \u201cStart\u201d to acquire data for a minute and check if heartbeat (haemoglobin oscillations of ~1 Hz) is visible on concentration signals, which ensures a good signal quality.\nTurn off the portable box in the wireless mode pressing the \u201cPower\u201d button on it. Press the \u201cPower\u201d button in conjunction with the \u201cMode\u201d button on the portable box to turn on the fNIRS in the stand-alone mode.\nNOTE: The stand-alone mode ensures that the participant can move freely around the experimental area and avoids the necessity to be close to the fNIRS laptop to maintain the wireless connection.\n4. Data Acquisition\nTurn on the head camera and the experimenters\u2019 cameras and start filming.\u00a0Press the \u201cProbe Adjustment\u201d button on the fNIRS portable box to optimize the detectors gain and then press the \u201cPlay/Stop\u201d button to start the fNIRS acquisition (sampling frequency=5 Hz).\nAdd a marker to the fNIRS data manually by using the \u201cMark\u201d button on the fNIRS portable box in conjunction with an audio trigger (e.g., a beep). The audio trigger must be clearly recorded on all video cameras. Then start the experiment.\nNOTE: This allows a robust time synchronisation between the different video cameras and the fNIRS recording.\n5. Experimental Protocol \u00a0\nInclude the following conditions and counterbalance the prospective memory ones across the participants:\n\t\nUse 3 baseline conditions:\nNOTE: This allows to decouple global haemodynamic and oxygenation changes due to walk-related systemic changes versus more localised responses due to brain (neuronal) function.\n\t\t\nFor the Rest 1 condition, have the participant stand stationary on the street where the test is conducted, and count the number of stimuli on a piece of paper (e.g., use a sheet containing Xs and Os printed on it and have the participant count the number of Os on it).For the Rest 2 condition, have the participant walk a short distance at a normal walking pace, and make no other demands of him.\nFor the Baseline condition, have the participant walk around the entire street area where the experiment is conducted.\nNOTE: In our case, the experiment took place in Queen Square, London WC1N, U.K.\nFor the Uncontaminated Ongoing condition, have the participant walk around the experimental area and count the occurrence of certain items (e.g., the number of signs affixed to buildings that contain the word \u201cQueen\u201d).\nFor the Non-social Prospective Memory condition, have the participant carry out the Ongoing task (e.g., have the participant count the number of dates and opening hours affixed to buildings), but in addition, if they came within a specified distance of a parking meter, have them go over to it and touch it.\nFor the Social Prospective Memory condition, have the participant carry out the Ongoing task (e.g., have the participant count the number doorbells), but in addition, have him respond to one of the experimenters who acts as a confederate who moves around into pre-specified positions within the experimental area. Have the participant go over to them and give them a \u201cfist bump\u201d greeting.\nUse an additional Ongoing condition (Contaminated Ongoing) after the PM conditions (e.g., participants has to count the number of unobstructed stairways within the testing area).\nRepeat the two Rest conditions described above in opposite order (Rest 2 and then Rest 1).\nNOTE: This allows evaluation of walk-related systemic changes at the end of the experiment.\n6. Recover Events from the Videos\nDownload the videos from all cameras and save in mpg4 format.Load the videos from all cameras into ELAN (https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/[href=https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/]) and synchronise the videos: use Options/Media Synchronisation Mode and align them based on the time point of the audio trigger.\nIn ELAN, use annotations and press the Tier button on the ELAN main window (referring to groups of annotations, i.e., one tier for all social PM targets) to mark events in the video stream.\n\t\nWatch the synchronised video stream and annotate the start and end of each experimental condition, and use tiers for the point at which each PM target is reached. Use separate tiers for social and non-social PM targets.\nComplete the video editing for each participant and use the File/Export As/Interlinear Text to export as a text file all the annotated time points.\n7. Data Analysis\nOpen the fNIRS software and export data from the portable box flash card into the fNIRS laptop.\nNOTE: The fNIRS system processing unit uses the modified Beer-Lambert law and calculates the relative changes in HbO2 and HHb from an arbitrary zero baseline at the beginning of the measurement period. Concentration values are hence expressed in molar concentrations (mmol/l) multiplied by the path length (mm)6 as they are not corrected for the optical path length.\nSave concentrations data and import them into Matlab through an in-house pre-processing software.\nPre-process the signals following these steps (Figure 3B):\n\t\nSignals down sampling to 1 Hz:\n\t\t\nUse a spline interpolation (Matlab function: interp1) to down sample data from 5 Hz to 1 Hz.\nLinear Detrending:\n\t\t\nTo remove slow drifts of the signal, use a linear interpolation (Matlab function: polyfit) between the Rest 1 phases at the beginning and the end of the experiment.\nMotion Artifact Correction:For each channel, identify and remove motion artifacts through a wavelet-based method31. Improve signals quality by applying the Correlation Based Signal Improvement (CBSI) method32.\nComplex wavelet transform:\n\t\t\nUse a Morlet mother wavelet, scaled and translated over time, to compute the wavelet transform of each channel through the wavelet toolbox (Matlab function: wt) provided by Grinsted et al.33 (http://noc.ac.uk/using-science/crosswavelet-wavelet-coherence[href=http://noc.ac.uk/using-science/crosswavelet-wavelet-coherence]).\nNOTE: From the wavelet spectrum, it is possible to evaluate the spectral content of signals in a time-frequency space.\nBand-pass Filtering:\n\t\t\nOn the base of the wavelet analysis, use a 3rd order Butterworth band-pass filter (Matlab functions: butter and filter) with cut-off frequencies of 0.008-0.2 Hz7,34.", "In this protocol, we describe the procedure to create ttLbCas12a constructs for ipGT in detail (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20117#cppb20117-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/612f1bfd-cdf1-45da-8908-25d5cd48e62a/cppb20117-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nOverview of the screening strategy of ipGT to identify positive GT plants. The constructs are transferred into A. thaliana via floral dip method. The plants are cultivated until maturity to harvest the T1 seeds. The T1 seeds are sown out to select for primary transformants. The primary transformants are transferred to soil to grow until maturity to harvest T2 seeds. Approximately 100 T2 seeds are sown out on GM-medium for pre-screening. The pre-screening determines the positive pools. Each plant of each positive pool is then analyzed separately for GT events.

Identification of the target site: Search for a potential target site with a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM; 5'-TTTV-guide-3') in the selected target locus in close proximity to the desired modification. Avoid sequences containing a set of five or more Ts as this is the termination sequence for RNA polymerase III.\n2. Design of the HR donor: use 600 to 800 bp homologies on both flanks of the cleavage site. For excision of the HR donor, add the gRNA target sequence including the PAM to both ends of the donor sequence. To avoid Cas12a activity on the donor site, include silent mutations either in the PAM (preferred) or in the spacer sequence (nucleotides 4-7 proximal to the PAM are most vulnerable to mismatches). Additionally, add restriction sites (AatII and PacI) on the end of the HR donor, as they are required for inserting the HR donor sequence into your T-DNA (see Critical Parameters).\n3. Generate your HR donor sequence: methods to generate your HR donor are overlap extension PCRs, Gibson assembly, site-directed mutagenesis PCRs, or gene synthesis.\nGeneration of the T-DNA: creating the entry vector\n4. Order oligonucleotides for your target sequence. For ttLbCas12a the sequence should be 23-25 nt downstream of the PAM.

Harvest the T1 seeds after maturation.In this protocol, we describe the procedure to obtain heritable GT plants following A. thaliana transformation (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20117#cppb20117-fig-0002]).\nThis protocol includes two steps: (1) Generating primary transformants; (2) Obtaining heritable GT plants.\nMaterials\nT1 seeds (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20117#cppb20117-prot-0001])\nDNA polymerase for screening of GT plants\ndNTPs for screening of GT plants\nGentamicin-containing GM plates for selecting transgenic plants\nAdditional reagents and equipment for extracting DNA via the rapid DNA extraction method (see Edwards, Johnstone, & Thompson, 1991[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20117#cppb20117-bib-0002])\nGenerating primary transformants\n1.

Confirm successful GT events to ensure stable inheritance.", "Ethics statement: All experiments were approved by Memorial University of Newfoundland's Animal Care Ethics Committee according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.\n1. Mice\nUse adult mice. In this study, adult male FVBN mice (n=10) between 2-4 months were used. House mice on a 12:12 hr reverse light-dark cycle and provide standard rodent chow and water ad libitum.\n2. Materials Required for the Cylinder Test\nObtain a table with a transparent top to film the cylinder test. The dimensions of the table are irrelevant, the top must be plexiglass or glass, and there must be enough room to position a mirror below the table. This allows for the mouse to be videotaped from below. Use a mirror below the table to reflect the image through the cylinder. As an alternative, use an upside-down camera if available. The dimensions of the table used in this protocol are 54 x 56 x 66.5cm (w x l x h) with a 51 x 51cm top (w x l).\nObtain a mirror. The dimensions of the mirror used in this protocol are 34 x 58cm (w x l).\nObtain a transparent/plexiglass cylinder for the mouse to perform in. The dimensions of the cylinder used in this protocol are 17.5cm high, 8.8cm I.D, 9.5cm O.D with a wall thickness of 0.35cm. A taller cylinder may be required for more active mouse strains.\nPlace the cylinder on the tabletop and film the reflection in the mirror below.\nA videocamera and tripod are required. Record videos at approximately 650Kb/s, which is approximately 190Mb per 5 min of cylinder video. Ensure that the camera has a zoom functionality to ensure that the cylinder encompasses the entire field of view.NOTE: The videocamera used in this protocol is a Sony DCR-SR42, 40x optical zoom, 2,000x digital zoom, 680kpix which uses standard definition, NTSC interlaced video.)\nObtain software for analysis \u2013 a media player with video support and playback speed modulation. The media player used in this protocol is the VLC Media Player v2.1.2.\nObtain a computer with an operating system capable of running the media player and a monitor.\nElectronic storage for videos is required. Download videos to an external hard drive or copy it onto DVDs for long-term storage.\n\tNOTE: At 190Mb per video, 84 sessions will fit on a 16 GB SD card and 168 sessions will fit on a 32GB SD card. Due to the relative inexpensiveness of SD media, and the uncertainty in how much time some mice require to complete 20 rears, a 32 GB card is recommended. In the current study, the videos were copied from the camera to a 2TB external hard drive and then recopied onto DVDs as backup.\n3. Experimental Setup of the Cylinder Test\nFasten mirror below the table at a 45 degree angle to the tabletop. Do this using two support brackets attached to the table legs to support the top and bottom of the mirror, respectively. Bracket locations are noted in a side-view of the table (Figure 1A) and a face-on view of the table (Figure 1B).\nPlace cylinder on the center of the table. Draw four equidistant lines where the cylinder sits on the table with a black marker (Sharpie) so that the cylinder can be lifted and returned to the same position (Figure 2). Drawing them on the underside of the transparent tabletop allows the tabletop to be cleaned between animal tests without dissolving the marker ink.Attach the camera and tripod. Aim the camera at the mirror so that the picture is looking directly through the barrel of the cylinder. Ensure that the full inner wall of the cylinder is visible and unobstructed by the base (Figure 3). See a side-on view of the setup, including the relative angle of the camera and mirror setup, from above (Figure 4A) and from the level of the table, including a mouse rearing (Figure 4B).\nPrepare cue cards to identify each mouse prior to filming. Ensure that the cards typically include an identification number for each mouse, the time-point of the test (e.g., 3 days after treatment) and the date of the filming session. Do not include the treatment group on the cue card to ensure the experimenter is blinded.\nFilm in standard indoor lighting conditions as this level of light is required to clearly see the mouse movements around the cylinder.\n\tNOTE: If available filming in the dark with a red light camera may suffice, however one would first need to test whether paw touches and drags are clearly visible for quantification.\n4. Execution\nStart filming. Display the appropriate mouse cue card in front of camera lens.\nLower the mouse into the cylinder from the open top immediately after filming the cue card.\nBegin filming the mouse. Minimize noise during this time, as mice may lose interest in exploring if startled.\nObserve the mice rear to explore the cylinder. Capture the video until the mouse performs a minimum of twenty rears.\n\tNOTE: A rear occurs when both forepaws lose contact with the floor and the mouse stands on its hind legs.\nWipe tabletop and cylinder with an appropriate cleaning solution between each mouse to sanitize and remove mouse scents.Freezing is when mice stop exploring and remain quietly sitting on all fours for approximately 5 min. If mice freeze before twenty rears occur, it may be necessary to remove them from the cylinder for 10-20 min before resuming the test. If mice do not perform twenty rears, they are removed from the study.\n\tNOTE: In our experience, mice have never needed to be excluded due to failure to explore the cylinder.\n5. Evaluation of the Cylinder Test using Paw-Dragging Analysis\nPlay back the video at a rate of between 0.25x and 0.67x regular speed depending on how quickly the mouse explores the cylinder. Use a media player that offers slower playback speeds.\nQuantify the total number of paw touches. Paw touches occur when the mouse rears (Figure 5A), touches the side of the cylinder (Figure 5B), subsequently dismounts with both paws simultaneously (Figure 5C) and lands (Figure 5D). The paw may or may not contact the cylinder wall with a full palm, but some contact with the cylinder wall must occur. Assess paw touches by counting the number of times the mouse makes contact (no matter how brief) with the cylinder wall with either or both forepaws while standing on its hind limbs during a rear.Note that contact with the cylinder wall is only counted as a \u201cpaw touch\u201d or \u201cpaw-drag\u201d if the mouse is in a rear position \u2013 standing on its hind limbs with both forepaws off of the tabletop. If the mouse remains in a 3-point stance \u2013 both hind limbs and one forepaw on the tabletop and proceeds to touch the wall with the free paw \u2013 this is not counted as a paw touch. Mice may rear and touch the cylinder wall with a single forepaw and this is counted as a paw touch. Note: a mouse may also move its body around the cylinder during a rear, making more than two contacts. These contacts are tallied \u2013 one for each left forepaw touch and one for each right forepaw touch.\nQuantify the number of paw-drags. Paw-dragging behaviour is distinct from normal paw touches.\n\t\nIf the paw contacts the cylinder wall with a full open palm (Figure 6B), it will slowly fall away from the wall, often with a slight tremor. The movement begins with the digits dragging against the cylinder wall either in a medial or downward direction, (Figure 6C) before falling away completely (Figure 6D). The mouse will then dismount with its unaffected paw (Figure 6E) before landing on all fours (Figure 6F). This is considered a paw-drag and should be counted in a tally.\nIf the paw does not contact the cylinder wall with a fully open palm, it will graze the cylinder wall with its digits before falling away from the cylinder wall. Similarly, a mouse may drag its paw against the cylinder wall but not release it entirely before dismounting. These are both considered paw-drags as well as touches and should be counted as both in a tally.The paw may also drag along the cylinder wall while a mouse explores the cylinder. In this case, the paw will follow the twisting of the mouse\u2019s torso as it explores left or right of its original position (Figure 7A-D) before dismounting (Figure 7E). This is not considered a paw-drag, as it depends on the mouse randomly choosing a direction to explore and does not depend on which cortical hemisphere was damaged.\nPaw-drags are expressed as a percentage of paw-drags per total number of paw touches during a session. Express the number of paw-drags as a percentage of total paw contacts for each forelimb separately.\nTouches resulting in a paw-drag count as a paw-drag and a touch simultaneously. Thus, if a mouse drags its paw each time its paw contacts the cylinder wall, the paw-dragging percentage is expressed as 100%.\n6. Additional Experimental Design Suggestions\nTo minimize extraneous variables:\n\t\nTest the mice at the same time on each testing day. Test the mice during their wake cycle. Keeping mice on a 12 hr reverse light cycle facilitates performance.\nMice may be reluctant to explore the cylinder if stressed either by noise or a novel environment. Testing mice in their animal holding room or a room they have been familiarized with reduces stress. This can occur if the room is noisy, if the mouse has been jostled prior to entering the cylinder or due to habituation.\n\t\tNOTE: Testing should be performed once before experimental manipulation to serve as a baseline reading. After manipulation, testing days are at the experimenter\u2019s discretion, though it is advised to avoid an excessive number of exposures to the cylinder over a short period of time.Mice may become reluctant to rear after 6-7 exposures to the cylinder. For the current study, mice were tested in the cylinder for a total of seven times, prior to ischemia and on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study we used the FVBN mouse strain. We have previously tested C57Bl/6 mice in the cylinder and observed paw-dragging behaviour following an ET-1 ischemic injury (data not shown). C57BL/6 mice were more active than FVBN mice when rearing and frequently jumped onto the rim of the cylinder before climbing out. Taller cylinders should be used if mice attempt to escape by jumping.\n7. Endothelin-1 Surgery and Infarct Volume Measurements\nPerform Endothelin-1 surgery and infarct volume measurements according to previously published protocols4 . To target the anterior forelimb motor cortex, each mouse should receive three ET-1 injections at the following coordinates: (i) +0.7 anteriorposterior (AP)/1.5 medial-lateral (ml)/-1.2 dorsal-ventral (DV), (ii) +0.4 AP/1.25 ml/- 1.2 DV and (iii) +0.1 AP/1.75 ml/-1.2 DV4 .\n8. Statistical Analysis\nA two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) is recommended to analyze the percent of paw-dragging for the affected and unaffected paws across different time points.\nSubscription Required.

Experimental workflow\nDetermine the stereotaxic coordinates\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\nThe skull sutures are used to determine the two landmarks, the bregma and lambda (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The bregma point is formed by the intersection of the coronal and sagittal sutures, whereas the lambda point is formed by the intersection of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. Stereotaxic coordinates for specific brain regions can be easily determined using a brain atlas (for example, The mouse brain in stereotaxic coordinates, by Paxinos and Franklin) (Franklin and Paxinos, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). This atlas provides the medial-lateral (X), rostral-caudal (Y), and dorsal-ventral (Z) distances from the bregma when its position is assigned the coordinates (X, Y, Z)\u00a0= (0, 0, 0).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/562-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04.

The coordinates for the hypothalamic perifornical area are (0.47, \u22120.7, 4.75).\nNote: There are at least two methods to determine the z coordinate. One utilizes the distance from the bregma on the skull surface, while the other uses the distance of the targeted region from the pia surface. In the former case, we use the scale provided in the brain atlas. For the latter, we measure the distance between the pia and the targeted region on the atlas map to calculate the actual distance.Critical: Before administering a viral injection, it is recommended that one injects a dye using a different set of animals. After dye injection, please confirm the accuracy of the determined stereotaxic coordinates on brain sections. If necessary, one can adjust the coordinates to improve the accuracy.\nStereotaxic surgery\nTiming: 1\u00a0day\nDisinfect the microsyringe needle with 70% ethanol.\nAnesthetize an adult male Ucn3-Cre mouse with 2% isoflurane in the induction chamber.\nHang the mouse\u2019s front teeth on the hole and cover the nose with the anesthesia mask connecting to the isoflurane anesthetizer (Figure.2B[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPut an ear bar on the head.\nFix the head to the stereotaxic frame.\nWipe the head with an alcohol swab and shave the hair.\nUsing a scalpel, cut the scalp approx. 0.5\u00a0cm along the midline.\nRemove the periosteum with a cotton swab.\nAdjust the nose height by moving the nose clamp vertically to ensure that the heights of the bregma and lambda were at the same level.\nLower the microsyringe so that its tip touches the bregma, and read the height scale.\nMove the microsyringe to the lambda position.\nAs in step 8a, read the height scale.\nReturn the microsyringe to the bregma position. Adjust the nose level so that the bregma and lambda heights are the same.\nMove the microsyringe in the rostro-caudal and medial-lateral directions towards a targeted coordinate.\nLower the microsyringe, mark the drilled position using a marker if necessary, and drill the skull surface to make a hole of approximately 1-mm diameter.\nNote: When accidental bleeding occurs, apply pressure on the hole with a cotton swab to stop bleeding.\nFill the microsyringe with the viral solution.Note: Injection needles can be easily clogged. Please confirm that the viral solution is released from the needle when pushing the plunger. After that, wipe off the solution with a cotton swab.\nLower the microsyringe to the targeted z-coordinate.\nInject 0.25\u00a0\u03bcL of viral solution (1\u00a0\u00d7 1013 copies/mL) at a flow rate 0.1\u00a0\u03bcL/min and leave the needle in place for 3\u00a0min after injection.\nSlowly pull out the microsyringe to prevent the backflow and suture up the incision.\nApply isodine solution and then xylocaine gel on the wound.\nNote: Please keep this order because xylocaine gel makes a barrier to antisepsis when administered prior to isodine solution (Doshi et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nLeave the mouse on a heated pad until it awakens.\nHouse the mouse alone in a home cage for 4\u00a0weeks until behavioral testing.\nCritical: Please refer to institutional guidelines for specific instructions on aseptic and analgesic managements.\nCritical: The fixation of the head is a very important step for accurate stereotaxic injection.\nHabituation and weight measurement\nTiming: 2\u20133\u00a0days\nThis procedure is performed in order for animals to habituate to the testing environments.\nTransport animals in their home cages to a behavioral testing room or to its front chamber a few days prior to beginning the behavioral testing.\nPlace the cages on a rack and leave for 2\u20133 h.\nReturn the animals to their breeding room.\nRepeat the above steps for at least 2\u00a0days.\nOn the last day of habituation, weigh the animals and determine the volume of CNO that will need to be injected.\nCritical: Behavioral results are influenced by stress and novel experiences. It is important to carry out this procedure in the same way as in the day of testing.Critical: Behavioral tests should be performed within a fixed time period of the day. It is better to perform the tests during the dark phase to avoid disturbing the animals\u2019 sleep. However, this might not be possible in animal experimental facilities. In this case, we are going to perform the tests during the initial few hours of the light phase, from 9:00 to 13:00 (12\u00a0h light-dark cycle, lights on at 8:00).\nOpen field/novel object test\nTiming: 2\u20134 h\nBoth open field and novel object tests can be used for evaluating animal anxiety (Belzung and Le Pape, 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Calhoon and Tye, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). These tests can be sequentially performed on the same day (Anthony et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Dietrich et\u00a0al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Horii-Hayashi et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), which can save time and evaluate behavioral responses to novel environment and novel objects.\nAnxious animals prefer to stay along the edges and the corners of the enclosure and tend to avoid the center of the field, which is frequently accompanied with decreased locomotion (Calhoon and Tye, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Similar to the open field test, high anxiety decreases object investigation time represented by sniffing and stretch-attend posture behaviors toward the object (Ren et\u00a0al., 1981[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nThe following procedure describes how to perform the open field test followed by the novel object test using chemogenetically activated mice. However, this protocol can also be applied to animals subjected to other manipulations. Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] shows behavioral categories, parameters, and analysis methods in the open field and novel object tests.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_562_3.csv\nPrepare the required volume of diluted CNO solution immediately before the test:Calculate the volume of the diluted CNO solution required. When administering 1\u00a0mg/kg of CNO to mice, the stock solution (2\u00a0mg/mL) is diluted 20 times to obtain a final concentration of 0.1\u00a0mg/mL, of which 100\u00a0\u03bcL is injected per 10\u00a0g of a mouse\u2019s body weight (e.g., 250\u00a0\u03bcL of the diluted solution should be injected into a mouse weighing 25 g).\nDilute the stock solution (2\u00a0mg/mL) with saline.

Intraperitoneally inject the CNO solution (1 mg/kg) or saline 15 min prior to the test and return the mouse to their home cage.\nNote: Intraperitoneally injected CNO (3.5\u00a0mg/kg) reaches cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue at 15\u201230\u00a0min after the injection (Jendryka et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nNote: Duration between CNO injection and behavioral testing should be the same for all of the mice.\nStart behavioral testing\nOpen field test: Start the video recording, put the mouse in the corner of the open-field box, and leave for 10\u00a0min.\nReturn the mouse to its home cage.

Because these shapes are uniform, one can easily surround and determine the object area with a circle on the behavioral software, while one would have difficulty in the accurate surrounding of ununiformed-shape objects with a mouse pointer. Besides, anxious mice sometimes stay at a particular corner in the box. In that case, they would see a limited aspect of the objects from one angle, which might generate redundant differences in individual animals. A uniformed shape can resolve this problem because mice can see the same scene wherever they stay in the box.\nNote: Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] shows examples of stretch-attend posture during single object burying test. A similar behavior could be observed in the novel object test. Please refer to the movie.\nCritical: Do not put the mouse in the center of the box in both tests.\nCritical: It is recommended to avoid using shiny materials as novel objects, as this could cause bias depending on the way the light hits them.\nCritical: Use the same object consistently, so that the measured values can be compared.\nCritical: Limit to one behavioral test per day, except for open field/novel object tests.\nCritical: Do not repeat open field/novel object tests using the same animals.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Stretch-attend\nposture and burying behaviors during the single object burying test, related to steps 49 and 50\nThe movie shows examples of stretch-attend posture (SAP) and burying behaviors. The upper line and bottom line of view are recorded from overhead and side-view cameras, respectively.Single object burying test\nTiming: 2\u20134 h\nThe following procedure describes how to perform the single object burying test. One should keep at least a 1-day interval between the former and the present tests to relieve animals\u2019 stress. Ethologically, burying and risk assessment in rodents are categorized into defensive behavior (Blanchard et\u00a0al., 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; De Boer and Koolhaas, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Horii-Hayashi et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Koolhaas et\u00a0al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). Activation of hypothalamic Ucn3 neurons increases both behaviors (Horii-Hayashi et\u00a0al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). This test directly measures burying action and concurrently enables the evaluation of investigatory behaviors, including risk assessment and sniffing. This point is different from the marble-burying test, in which burying activity is evaluated by counting the number of buried marbles. Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] shows behavioral categories, parameters, and analysis methods in the single object burying test.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_562_4.csv\nOptional: The number of stretch-attend postures is also countable. However, the discrimination of the end of burying action and the withdrawal following the posture is difficult, especially in CNO-treated animals (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nDilute the CNO stock solution in the same manner as described above (step 25) and transport animals in the same way as in the habituation period (step 20).\nPlace the cages on a rack and leave them for at least 30\u00a0min before commencing testing.\nAdjust the brightness to 5\u00a0lx using a photometer for mouse cage recording (approximately the same brightness as in breeding conditions).\nPrepare new cages containing bedding material at a height of up to 4\u00a0cm from the floor.\nIntraperitoneally inject CNO solution (1\u00a0mg/kg) or saline 15\u00a0min prior to the test and return them to the home cage.\nNote: Duration between CNO injection and behavioral testing should be the same for all of the mice.Field exploration session: Start video recording, put the mouse in the new cage, and leave for 10\u00a0min.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage.\nFix a novel object in a corner of the cage.\nNovel object session: The mouse is placed in the cage and left for 15\u00a0min.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage.\nCritical: When using the same animals as in the open field/novel object tests, use an object that is different from that used in the novel object test.\nCritical: When the field exploration session (step 35) is skipped, mice tend to utilize the time for field exploration during the novel object session (step 38).\nMarble-burying test\nTiming: 1\u20132 h\nThe marble-burying test is simple, easy to perform, and widely used for evaluating repetitive/stereotypic behaviors and the effects of anxiolytic drugs (Fodor et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Thomas et\u00a0al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). One should keep at least a 1-day interval between the former and the present tests to relieve animals\u2019 stress. The procedures given below describe how to perform this test. However, it is also notable that burying is a natural and innate behavior in rodents. Thus, result interpretation does not always provide a single conclusion; rather, they depend on the animal models and types of treatments used (De Boer and Koolhaas, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; de Brouwer et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] shows a behavioral category, parameter, and analysis method in the marble-burying test.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_562_5.csv\nDilute the CNO stock solution in the same manner as described above (step 25) and transport animals in the same way as in the habituation period (step 20).\nPlace the cages on a rack and leave them for at least 30\u00a0min before commencing testing.Adjust the brightness in the testing room to 5\u00a0lx using a photometer (approximately the same brightness as in the breeding conditions).\nPrepare new cages containing bedding material placed up to a height of 4\u00a0cm from the floor, and align 24 glass marbles (6\u00a0\u00d7 4) at specific intervals (Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/562-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06.

Although mice frequently dig at the corner of the cage with their back to the object, it is not counted as burying behavior.\nMarble-burying test: Data are expressed according to the number of marbles buried.\nCritical: After behavioral testing, it is critical to histologically confirm the accuracy of the viral injection and reporter gene expression under a fluorescent microscope.", "Optimally mice should be tested during their active (dark) cycle. The mice in our laboratory are maintained on a reverse light/dark cycle that enables us to conveniently test the mice during their active period (and ours). Testing is not started until at least one hour into the dark cycle. However, it is not always possible for an investigator to maintain a separate mouse room with a reverse light cycle. In that case, all three tests can be performed during the light cycle but keep in mind that time to traverse on the beam, number of steps and rears in the cylinder, and contact and removal times may be longer when tested during this time.\nAll three tests described below can be performed by one experimenter, but for those who are not as experienced handling and working with mice or have little to no experience measuring behavior in mice then an additional experimenter may be needed. In this case the second experimenter can assist with the challenging beam test by placing mice on the beam while the other experimenter records the trial or in the adhesive removal test the second experimenter can run the timer while the other places the sticker on the snout and places the mouse in the cage.\n1. Challenging Beam Traversal Procedure\nInvert 3 clean mouse cages on a tabletop or in a mouse cage-changing station. Line the cages up evenly so that they can support the length of the beam (1 meter).\nAssemble the four sections of the beam from the widest to narrowest section and place on top of the inverted mouse cages.Place the homecage of the mice that you plan to test on its side and at the end of the beam so that the narrowest end of the beam leads right into the homecage.\nPick up the first mouse by the base of its tail and support its hindlimbs with the palm of your hand. Place the mouse at the wide end of the beam and let go of its tail and remove your hand.\nLet the mouse sniff and move around in order to become better oriented to the apparatus- if the mouse turns around gently redirect it to the desired direction.\nLift up the homecage (even if it has cagemates in it) keeping it in the same position on its side and bring it close to the test mouse. As the test mouse begins to try and enter the homecage move it back so that the mouse does not enter but makes a step forward. Continue to do this all the way down the beam. At the end allow the mouse to enter the homecage. Do the same procedure for each mouse in the cage. This is the first \"assisted\" trial.\nThe beam should be thoroughly cleaned between cages with a disinfectant provided by the animal care or veterinary staff. Within a cage it is important to clean off any urine or fecal pellets off the beam before the next mouse is run because this will distract the next mouse.Once all of the mice in the cage have gone through one assisted trial then pick up the first mouse again and place it at the wide end of the beam. If needed, with your hand gently orient the mouse in the desired direction and lightly touch its backside to encourage it to move along the length of the beam into its homecage. If the mouse stops to sniff or walk off the beam correct the mouse with your hand or pick it up and place it on the same section where it walked off. Have your hand nearby to guide the mouse to the end of the beam. You want to try and minimize the mouse stopping and exploring while on the beam. The more this is done during training the less the mouse tends to do it during testing.\nThe trial ends when the mouse places one of its forelimbs into the homecage. The next mouse can then receive its 2nd trial. Mice receive a total of 5 trials on the first training day, alternating between mice so that each mouse has an intertrial interval of ~30 sec or more. Typically by the last few trials mice will traverse the length of the beam, on their own, without need for correcting.\n24 hr later day 2 of training can begin. On day 2 the mice receive 5 more trials on the same beam set-up as in day 1. The mice should not need any assistance but may need to be corrected or touched on the backside to prevent stopping or exploring.24 hr later the actual test day can begin. For the test day, the beam is set up in a similar manner to the previous 2 training days. However, now a mesh grid that corresponds to each beam width is placed on top of each beam section. A videocamera is used to record all beam traversal trials and can be performed by one or multiple experimenters.\nLabel a card with the essential experiment information (date, mouse #, trial #, etc.). Place this card in front of the camera and record for 2-3 sec so that it is clear which mouse is being tested and what trial it is on.\nThe mouse is placed on top of the grid surface on the widest section of the beam and recorded as it moves along the beam. The recording should be close enough so that the entire length of the mouse's body is visible on the camera. If it is too far then slips are difficult to see and if it is too close then limb movements can be missed. The camera should be positioned so that the grid is in the middle of the viewer.\nOn the Test day all mice receive 5 trials on the grid-surfaced beam.\n2. Analysis of Beam Video\nVideos can be viewed directly from the camera or connected to a television or computer for a larger screen view. Videotapes should be scored by an experimenter blind to genotype and treatment condition within the experiment.Errors for each trial are scored as the video is played in slow motion. Slips or errors are counted when the mouse is facing and moving forward. A slip through or outside of the grid is considered an error when the limb slips beyond 0.5 cm below the grid surface (halfway down). Any slips made after a mouse stops or orients its head to the side are not considered errors. If the mouse is not moving forward and a limb or limbs repeatedly slips through the grid it is NOT considered an error. On the narrow section of the beam the base of the hindlimbs can be on top of the grid and the toes hanging off the side, this is not considered an error.\nSteps are also counted in slow motion. The hindlimb facing the camera is used to track the number of steps. Counting begins when the mouse makes its first step forward and ends when the mouse places its forelimb into the homecage.\nTime to traverse is scored using a stopwatch and is done in real time. The timer is started when the mouse begins to move forward and ends when the first forepaw is placed in the homecage.\n3. Spontaneous Activity in the Cylinder Procedure\nInvert 3 clean mouse cages on a tabletop or in a mouse cage-changing station. Arrange two cages next to each other ~18 cm apart so that the front of the cages are facing the experimenter. The remaining cage is placed behind the other two cages and will serve to support the mirror.\nPlace the piece of glass on top of the 2 cages and position it so the glass is being supported by the outer edge of the first 2 cages.Place the cylinder on top of the glass and the mirror at an angle beneath the glass, leaning on the 3rd cage in back. The angle can range anywhere from 30\u00b0- 45\u00b0 but more importantly the view from the mirror has to include the full diameter of the cylinder.\nSet the videocamera up in front of the mirror and adjust both the mirror and videocamera until you can view the entire diameter of the bottom of the cylinder.\nSet the timer for 3 min and label a card with the important experiment details (date, mouse#, etc.). Videorecord the label for 2-3 sec.\nPlace the mouse in the cylinder and press record and the timer. Record the mouse for three minutes. It is important that the testing area is quiet as loud noises and conversation can distract the mouse and potentially cause freezing behavior.\nDuring the 3 min use a hand counter to count the number of rears the mouse makes while in the cylinder. A rear is defined as a vertical movement with both forelimbs off the floor so that the mouse is standing only on its hindlimbs. At the end of 3 min remove the mouse and place it back into its homecage.\nClean the cylinder and glass with a disinfectant provided by the animal care or veterinary staff. Allow the cleaning solution to dry before placing the next mouse in the cylinder.\n4. Analysis of Spontaneous Activity\nVideos can be viewed directly from the camera or connected to a television or computer for a larger screen view. The videotapes should be scored by an experimenter blind to genotype and treatment condition within the experiment.Forelimb steps are counted as the video is played back in slow motion. A forelimb step is counted when an animal moves both forelimbs sequentially across the floor of the cylinder in one consecutive movement. A forelimb movement is not counted if the time between the movement of one forelimb and the other forelimb is longer than 5 sec. Hindlimb steps are counted in the same manner as forelimb steps.\nTime spent grooming is measured using a stopwatch and playing back the video in real time. Grooming bouts on the snout, vibrissae, and body are measured.\n5. Adhesive Removal\nPlace mouse in its homecage in the testing room or in a mouse cage-changing station.\nRemove the feeder bin from the cage and replace the cage lid. Allow the mice/mouse to habituate to the testing room and the cage without the feeder for 1 hr.\nFor testing use a clean cage to place cagemates so the test mouse is the only one in the homecage. Remove ~3/4 of the bedding and place it in the clean cage with the cagemates.\nIn the homecage scruff the test mouse in order to restrain it and using a pair of small forceps place one adhesive label onto the snout of the mouse. Gently press the label on the snout with the forcep and release the mouse. Place the lid on the cage and start a stopwatch. When the mouse makes an attempt to remove the label with its forepaws record the time. If the mouse makes contact but does not remove the label then keep the timer going until it does remove it and record that time as well (contact and removal time).If the mouse does not contact or remove the sticker within 60 sec then the trial is ended and the sticker is removed manually by the experimenter.\nPlace the test mouse in the clean cage and remove the next mouse and place it in the homecage and begin testing. All mice receive 3 trials. It is important to alternate between mice rather than doing all three trials in a mouse at one time. Trials where the label falls off or is not secure on the snout are not counted.", "All experimental protocols are approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of National Taiwan University.\n1.

Have each participant perform 10 min of MBSR mindful breathing (MBSR mindfulness condition) and 10 min of normal rest (control condition) during EEG data collection. This generates a pre-MBSR training dataset with two conditions.\n\t\tNOTE: Counterbalance the sequence of mindful breathing and normal rest among the participants.\nRecord EEG data again about 1 month after the participants complete the MBSR course.\n\t\nAsk each participant to perform 10 min of mindful breathing and 10 min of normal rest during EEG data collection. This generates a post-MBSR training dataset with two conditions.\n3. EEG and ECG Data AnalysisNOTE: The first four steps are for data preprocessing, and the remaining steps are for wavelet entropy computation and correlation analysis. Here, an open-source software named EEGLAB16 was used for EEG analysis, but the operations should be similar across different software. In the following, the operations that are based on EEGLAB will be provided as an example. Refer to the EEGLAB manual for details (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Wiki#EEGLAB_Tutorial).\nUse the EEG software to resample the data at 250 Hz by selecting Tools > Change sampling rate. Use the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter for band-pass filtering with a 0.5 - 100 Hz passband by selecting Tools > Filter the data > Basic FIR filter.\n\t\nTo reduce noise due to the mains alternating current that is country-specific, use the short, nonlinear, Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter for notch filtering with a 47 - 53 Hz stopband by selecting Tools > Filter the data > Short non-linear IIR filter. This covers all relevant frequencies in the spectrum analysis while removing unnecessary noise.\nUse the EEG software to visually scroll through and inspect the EEG signal by selecting Plot > Channel data (scroll).\n\t\nIdentify and delete EEG segments that contain obvious muscle noise and any other strange events. Left-click and drag the mouse over bad segments to highlight them and then \"delete\" or \"reject\" the segments using the EEG software.\n\t\tNOTE: Muscle activities such as swallowing or facial expression often generate discontinuous and irregular signals. Strange events are usually caused by head or body movements, which often lead to significant shifts (at low frequencies) of the EEG signal.\nDetermine if there is any bad channel. Reconstruct each bad channel using the spherical interpolation method by selecting Tools > Interpolate channel.Use the EEG software to perform Independent Component Analysis17 (ICA) on the data by selecting Tools > Run ICA. Have an experienced EEG operator visually identify and discard components of eye movement and blinking, muscle movements, and components of other possible noise by selecting Tools > Reject data using ICA > Reject components by map; Tools > Remove components. The EEG software will reconstruct the data automatically using the retained components.\nUse the EEG software to rereference the data to the average of all channels before further analysis by selecting Tools > Re-reference.\nSpectrum analysis.\n\t\nUse the EEG software command line function \"spectopo\" to compute the spectra of EEG using Welch's power spectral density estimation18 and obtain the log powers (dB) of delta (1 - 4 Hz), theta (4 - 8 Hz), alpha (8 - 12 Hz), beta (12 - 30 Hz), and gamma (30 - 80 Hz) waves.\nCalculate the relative power of each type of wave18 (i.e.\u00a0the proportion of power in the respective frequency band relative to the total spectrum power).\nPerform EEG source analysis using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) approach.\n\t\nUse minimum norm estimation19 to transform the EEG signals of the scalp electrodes into 3D brain source signals.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the original channel number was 122, and it was transformed to 8,196 channels distributed in the three-dimensional brain model. The significance level was set at p = 0.01. Please refer to the source analysis in the SPM manual (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/spm8_manual.pdf).\nCalculate the wavelet entropy for each EEG channel (as well as for the estimated three-dimensional brain source signal) using the following procedure:\n\t\nGiven a signal imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55455/55455eq1.jpg, calculate the wavelet coefficients as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55455/image002.jpg, where imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55455/image003.jpg is an orthonormal basis of the Haar wavelet family and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55455/image004.jpg represents the decomposition levels (N = 10 in this study).Define the relative energy as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55455/image005.jpg, with imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55455/image006.jpg.\nCalculate the wavelet entropy as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55455/image007.jpg. Average the wavelet entropy for all channels to obtain the EEG wavelet entropy for each participant.\nUse the software package to perform a peak analysis on the ECG data to obtain the heartbeat signal, which consists of the number of ECG wave peaks and the interval between the peaks.\n\tNOTE: Assuming a normal heartrate of 60-100 beats/min in both the normal rest and mindful breathing states, the number of heartbeat instances N for a 10 min duration should be relatively small, satisfying 600 < N < 1,000.\n\t\nTo obtain reliable wavelet entropy from the heartbeat signal, use a sliding window of 500 points and a step increment of 10 points to compute a series of wavelet entropies using the same procedure as for EEG, elaborated in section 3.7. Use the mean value as the final wavelet entropy.\nAnalyze the brain and heart correlation across subjects between the wavelet entropy of ECG and that of EEG at every channel of the scalp using any statistical software that has a Pearson correlation function.\n\t\nUse the EEG software command line function \"topoplot\" to construct a statistical scalp map for the correlation. Plot a linear correlation graph with the heart rate entropy and the average EEG entropy of only those channels that are significantly correlated with heartrate entropy (see the Representative Results section).", "All animal experimentation was performed according to the guidelines of the local and institutional Council on Animal Care (University of Bonn, BfArM, LANUV, Germany). In addition, all animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with superior legislation, e.g., the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC), or individual regional or national legislation. Specific effort was made to minimize the number of animals used, as well as their suffering.\n1. Animal Housing and EEG Recording Conditions\nHouse mice in filter-top cages or use individually-ventilated cages.\nTransfer mice from the animal facility to ventilated cabinets in special lab rooms that are appropriate for implanted animals and telemetric recordings.\nPerform all animal experimentation, including EEG electrode implantation and the subsequent recordings, under standardized conditions (22 \u00b0C temperature, 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle, 50-60% relative humidity, noise attenuation, etc.)18.\nPrior to radiofrequency transmitter implantation, house animals in groups of 3 - 4 in clear type II polycarbonate cages, with food and water ad libitum. Do not isolate individual mice, as this can cause stress and interfere with subsequent experimentation and results.\nDo not use open housing conditions, but use ventilated cabinets instead during experimentation and recording.\n2. Radiotelemetric EEG Electrode Implantation and EEG Recordings\nAnesthetize the mice using injection narcotics, e.g., ketaminehydrochloride/xylazinehydrochloride (100/10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) or inhalation narcotics, e.g., isoflurane17,18.\nFor isoflurane narcosis, position the mouse into an induction chamber with 4-5% isoflurane and 0.8-1% oxygen or carbogen (5% CO2 and 95% O2).\nPlace a silicon facemask on the nose/mouth of the animal to control the desired depth of anesthesia and avoid experimenter exposure to isoflurane using a scavenging system.\nUse injectable anesthetics, e.g., esketaminhydrochloride (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazinehydrochloride (10 mg/kg, i.p.), if inhalation anesthesia is not available.Monitor the depth of anesthesia by checking the tail pinch reflex, foot pinch reflex, and respiration rate. Note that artificial respiration via tracheal intubation is not necessary in mice.\nImplant the radiofrequency transmitter into a subcutaneous pouch on the back of the animal.\nRemove the body hair from the scalp and pretreat the shaved scalp with two disinfectants, i.e., 70% ethanol and an iodine-based scrub.\nUsing a scalpel, make a midline incision on the scalp from the forehead to the nucheal region.\nStarting from the nuchal incision, prepare a subcutaneous pouch on one side of the back of the animal by performing a blunt dissection using surgical scissors or a surgical probe.\nInsert the transmitter into the subcutaneous pouch and deposit the excess length of the flexible transmitter leads into the pouch as well.\u00a0Pay special attention to preventing contamination of the surgical site and transmitter implant. Properly isolate sterile from non-sterile areas using drapes.\nPlace the experimental animal on the stereotaxic frame, e.g., a computerized 3D stereotaxic device. Fix the skull using a nose clamp and ear bars.\nPretreat the skull with 0.3% H2O2 to remove further tissue from the skull and to illuminate the cranial sutures and craniometrics landmarks, bregma and lambda.\nDrill holes at the coordinates of choice (see step 2.6) using a high-speed neurosurgical drill in a pressure-free mode at maximum velocity.\n\tNOTE: Pressure-free drilling avoids the sudden breakthrough of the drill head and damage to the cortex. For a craniotomy, a neurosurgical high-speed drill is recommended. Choose standard drill-head diameters of 0.3 - 0.5 mm, depending on the electrode diameter.\nCarefully select the electrode type, considering the impedance, diameter, coating, etc.NOTE: Parylene-coated tungsten or stainless steel electrodes are the most common. The electrode types should be chosen according to experimental requirements. As a preemptive maneuver, sterilize electrode tips prior to implantation using 70 % ethanol.\u00a0\u00a0Note that the electrode coating does not allow for heat sterilization.\nFor intrahippocampal CA1 EEG recordings, drill a hole stereotaxically at the following coordinates: bregma, -2 mm; mediolateral, 1.5 mm (right hemisphere); dorsoventral, 1.3 mm (target region: cornu ammonis (CA1) pyramidal layer). For the reference electrode, drill a hole above the cerebellar cortex at the following stereotaxic coordinates: bregma, -6.2 mm, mediolateral, 0 mm; dorsoventral, 0 mm.\n\tNOTE: The cerebellar electrode serves as a pseudoreference electrode, as the cerebellum is a rather silent brain region. The stereotaxic coordinates were derived from a standard mouse brain atlas.\nPrior to the insertion of the electrodes, shorten them to the required length. Mechanically clip the extracranial part of the electrode to the stainless steel helix of the transmitter.\n\tNOTE: Soldering should be avoided, as this can introduce substantial noise in the system.\nAttach the electrode to the vertical arm of the stereotaxic device and insert the electrode according to the aforementioned stereotaxic coordinates.\nFix the electrodes using glass ionomer cement and wait until the cement has fully hardened.\nClose the scalp using over-and-over sutures with non-absorbable 5-0 or 6-0 suture material.\nFor postoperative pain management, administer carprofen (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously, s.c.) once a day for 4 consecutive days post-implantation.\u00a0Note that carprofen should be injected prior to the initial incision (step 2.2.2).\nAllow the animals to recover for 10 - 14 days post-implantation before the recordings and/or injection experiments are started.\n3. Spontaneous Recordings of Theta Oscillations and Pharmacological InductionActivate the radiofrequency transmitter using the magnetic switch. Place the animal with its home cage on the receiver plate. Perform long-term hippocampal EEG recordings for at least 24-48 h.\n\tNOTE: The analysis of EEG amplitude and EEG frequency characteristics of long-term recordings provides detailed insight into the circadian dependency of theta oscillations and their association with specific behavioral and cognitive conditions/tasks. Always combine EEG recordings with video monitoring of the experimental animals.\nFor pharmacological induction of theta oscillations, administer a single dose of urethane (800 mg/kg i.p.) or a single dose of a muscarinic receptor agonists, e.g. pilocarpine (10 mg/kg i.p.), arecoline (0.3 mg/kg i.p.) or oxotremorine (0.03 mg/kg i.p.). Pretreat mice with N-methylscopolamine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) to avoid peripheral muscarinic reactions. Freshly dissolve all drugs in 0.9% NaCl or Ringer solution.\u00a0\n\tNOTE: Higher dosages of muscarinic receptor agonists might result in seizure induction in experimental animals. Also consider that the dosages given here represent landmarks that require prior dose-effect studies in the mouse line under investigation.\u00a0Note that urethane is a mutagen and carcinogen that requires appropriate precautions in storage and handling.\nInject atropine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) to differentiate atropine-sensitive type II from atropine-insensitive type I theta oscillations.\n\tNOTE: The atropine dosage is again species- and strain-dependent and requires prior dose-effect evaluation. The optimal time point of atropine injection depends on the pharmacodynamics of muscarinic receptor agonists. For identification of type II theta, atropine injection is recommended 1 h after urethane administration.\nTry to avoid the subsequent application of several drugs, as systemic drug administration alters global transcriptional and translational patterns, which influence subsequent EEG recordings. Note that short-lasting theta oscillations can also be induced by sensory stimuli, such as tail- or paw-pinching.Extract/export representative EEG data sets of the pre-phase (baseline) and the post-injection phase from the total EEG recording as ASCI or TXT files, considering the pharmacokinetics of the drugs applied and the demands of the individual study protocol.\n4. Validation of EEG Electrode Placement\nEuthanize animals by placing them in an incubation chamber and introduce 100% carbon dioxide. Use a fill rate of 10-30% of the chamber volume per min with carbon dioxide added to the existing air in the incubation chamber; this will result in rapid unconsciousness with minimal stress to the animals.\nRemove the mouse from the chamber once respiratory arrest occurs and a faded eye color persists for 2-3 min.\nCut the stainless steel electrodes and explant the radiofrequency transmitter. Decapitate the mouse using scissors or a guillotine and remove the brain from the neurocranium by gentle manipulation with surgical scissors and forceps.\nFix the brains in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) overnight. For cryoprotection, transfer the brains to 30% glucose and store them at 4 \u00b0C until further processing.\n\tNOTE: Paraformaldehyde is considered hazardous by the 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). Take the necessary precautions: use personal protective equipment, ensure appropriate ventilation, and avoid dust formation. In addition, remove sources of ignition and take precautionary measures against static discharges. Paraformaldehyde should not be released into the environment.\nMount the extracted brain on the tissue holder of a cryostat using an adhesive and cut the brains into 40 - 75 \u00b5m coronal slices. Mount the slices onto glass slides and stain them with Nissl blue using standard histological procedure; this procedure will visualize the branch channel that reflects the previous electrode position. Note that it is also possible to cut coronal slices from the native brain using a vibroslicerIncorporate only those animals that meet correct EEG electrode placement criteria; for the CA1 region, the tip of the deep electrode should be localized inside the CA1 pyramidal layer.\n5. Data Acquisition\nRecord CA1 intrahippocampal EEGs with an appropriate sampling rate with no a priori filter cut-off.\n\tNOTE: The sampling rate, which is transmitter-specific, determines the upper frequency limit of the EEG analysis.\nProcess the recorded data with an analysis software. Program time-frequency analyses and calculations with custom-made procedures for the adequate control of analysis methods (Figure 5)20.\nCut the recorded EEG into sections with a length of 1 h each. Use fast computer processors, since computation time is high. Additionally, make use of software that can parallelize computing on multiple kernels20.\n6. EEG Data Analysis\nAnalyze data segments using a complex Morlet wavelet to calculate both the frequency and the amplitude of oscillations.\n\tNOTE: This wavelet (e.g.,\u03a8(x)=(\u03c0b)(\u22121/2) exp(2i\u03c0cx) exp(\u2212x2/b), where b is the bandwidth parameter, c the center frequency, and i the imaginary unit) has often been applied in literature to study EEG data, as it guarantees optimal resolution in both frequency and time23,24.\nUse a bandwidth parameter and center frequency setting that particularly weights the frequency resolution to distinguish the frequency differences on the 0.1-Hz level while still not neglecting a sufficient time resolution.\n\tNOTE: Neuronal processes in the gamma band are short-lasting25, and this can also hold true for theta rhythms. Thus, the analytical approach must consider adequate temporal resolution.\nAnalyze the EEG data in the frequency range of 0.2 - 12 Hz, with a step-size of 0.1 Hz, thus including the typical delta, theta, and alpha frequency ranges.Set up an automated, complex analytical tool for the elaboration of the theta frequency architecture, which can replace a standard visual inspection of theta oscillations; this procedure is called the theta detection method (TDM).\nCompute the quotient of the maximum amplitude in the theta frequency range (3.5-8.5 Hz) and the maximum amplitude in the upper delta frequency range (2-3.4 Hz) for time windows of 2.5 s each.\n\tNOTE: The value of this quotient serves as a measure to decide if a theta oscillation occurred. The definition of the theta frequency range can vary depending on the functional state and neuroanatomical circuitry/system to be analyzed.\nClassify a segment as a \"theta oscillatory epoch,\" if the computed ratio during this segment is above 1.5.\n\tNOTE: This guarantees that the maximum theta amplitude is at least 50% higher than the amplitude in the upper delta band during the related 2.5-s EEG segment. Note that the ratio might need adaptation depending on the line and/or species used. An interval of 2.5 s represents a minimal duration for a theta oscillation, prevents false-positive detections of certain noisy epochs, and lies within the range definitions of other publications19,26. The upper delta frequency range serves as a control frequency band because physiologically-relevant delta activity appears during non-theta epochs, for example, during slow-wave sleep, which is highly dampened during theta activity.\nRepeat this procedure for every 1 h section; therefore, every section consists of 1,440 EEG segments with lengths of 2.5 s each.\nStatistically evaluate the data of the identified theta oscillation epochs.\nCompute the statistics of the total duration times of detected theta epochs; distinct or predefined groups; cycles, such as light/dark; and others parameters.\n\tNOTE: Statistics may include t-test, ANOVA, or MANOVA, depending on the variable, the number of groups, the conditions, etc.Calculate the statistics of the amplitude of the detected theta epochs, but only in the theta frequency range (3.5 - 8.5 Hz).\nEvaluate the statistics of the frequency of the detected theta epochs, but only in the theta frequency range (3.5 - 8.5 Hz).\n\tNOTE: The theta frequency of a theta epoch is defined as the frequency belonging to the maximum theta amplitude of a theta epoch.\nSubscription Required.

Pre-experiment Steps\nDuring recruitment, prescreen participants to ensure that they have no medical concerns, no history of neurological or psychological disorders, and no other disqualifying conditions for undergoing TMS, such as using a pacemaker, having any metal implants other than dental fillings, suffering a serious medical illness, taking anti-depressant or anti-psychotic medications, having a personal or family history of seizure disorder, or pregnancy.\nWhen prescreening (e.g., via phone), also ask questions regarding the prospective participant's political orientation, US citizenship, religiosity, and ethnicity.\nExclude non-US citizens or individuals who identify as 'extremely liberal' from the study to ensure that the participants will have a negative response to criticisms of the US (e.g., from a Latino immigrant, as has similarly been done in prior studies of intergroup bias)12,54,55.\nExclude those who identify as either 'extremely religious' or as 'atheist/agnostic' to ensure that participants will introspectively consider their degree of religious belief rather than answer reflexively on the basis of hardened convictions or habitual responses.\nExclude individuals who self-identify as 'Hispanic/Latino' in advance of the study toensure that the participants view the immigrant characters in the group bias measure as out-group members.\nContinue recruitment until there are at least 20 participants who satisfy the screening criteria in each cell of the design.\nObtain written consent after thoroughly explaining the experiment, including what TMS is and how it works, upon arrival of the prospective participants at the laboratory.\n2. cTBS ProcedureSeat the participant in a comfortable position and fit a grid-marked swim cap to his/her head. Use earplugs if needed to increase the comfort of the subject. Attach two differential parallel-bar EMG-recording electrodes, centered over the belly of the tibialis anterior muscle, after cleaning the skin over the muscle thoroughly. Attach a third, ground electrode to the skin over a bone somewhere else on the hand or arm.\nOn the swim cap, measure and mark the center location (Cz) on the subject's head.\nIf using neuronavigation (recommended), launch the neuronavigation software and follow the software's procedure for localizing the subject's head. Have the subject rest comfortably and begin recording the EMG electrode output to software that will filter and display the signal.\nPerform thresholding on the primary motor cortex. With a double-cone coil (110 mm), place the center of the coil over the motor cortex, held tangential to the scalp surface. Apply single-pulse TMS at 50% of the maximum stimulus output (MSO) and observe whether a motor-evoked potential (MEP) was present in the EMG signal following the stimulation.\nIf no MEP is seen following the stimulation, reposition the coil 1 cm away in any direction and try the stimulation again. Wait at least 6\u201310 s between stimulations in order for the neurons to completely recover. Continue moving the coil 1 cm at a time, marking on the cap the stimulation sites that result in an MEP of 50 mV or greater.\nIf no MEPs are seen after trying many locations, increase the stimulation intensity by 5% at a time, until MEPs are observed.\nMultiple nearby locations on the grid may elicit reliable MEPs. If this is the case, stimulate each of these locations at intensities decreasing by 1% at a time, until only one location remains that elicits reliable MEPs.To determine the active motor threshold (aMT), have the subject slightly contract the target muscle. Stimulate the located region for 10 repetitions, separated by ~7 s, at decreasing intensities, until a corresponding observable twitch in the hand muscle no longer occurs for 50% of the stimulations (5 out of 10). The threshold is the lowest intensity that elicits 5/10 twitches.\nNavigate the coil to the specified location on the cap corresponding to the brain region of interest. If the double-cone coil to be used has a directionality of current flow, and if the target region is lateralized, orient the coil laterally so that the current flow is directed toward the hemisphere to be stimulated (e.g., a rightward current flow for a right hemisphere target)56,57.\n\t\t\nIf using neuronavigation, locate the coordinates for the region of interest (pMFC) at Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates [8, 16, 52] and mark this point on the system. Use the guiding software to target the region with the coil.\nIf neuronavigation is unavailable due to logistical or financial constraints (as was the case in the example experiment), determine the location of the pMFC for each subject's head using the international 10\u201320 system58. Place the coil 3.75 cm anterior to the motor cortex.\nApply cTBS as follows: three pulses at 50 Hz repeated at 200 ms intervals for 40 s, totaling at 600 pulses.\nIf the participant is in the sham group, apply cTBS at only 10% of the maximal stimulation output.\n3. Survey Tasks\nSeat participants alone, in a private setting, at a desktop computer to perform the computer-mediated survey tasks.Remind participants that their responses will be anonymous, confidential, and inaccessible to the research assistant, particularly to the extent that the target judgments (e.g., group bias and religious belief) are likely to raise self-presentation concerns (e.g., to appear patriotic, or not to appear prejudiced) which might obscure the effect of the cTBS manipulation.\nPresent participants with filler tasks for 10 min before starting the main task, as the maximal effect of cTBS begins 5\u201310 min after the stimulation53, and in order to minimize demand effects.\nAdminister the Multiple Source Interference Task59 (MSIT) (or a comparable distracter), as this task is highly cognitively demanding and requires approximately 10 min.\nNext, present a set of ostensibly unrelated survey tasks, beginning with two further filler distracters: challenge the participants to estimate the number of colors present in images of jellybeans and seashells that have been converted to greyscale.\nInstantiate the threat context. If the ideological shifts of theoretical interest pertain to responses to death (as in this example study), ask participants to write two brief passages on the subject of their mortality60 by saying: (a) \"Please briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you\" and (b) \"Please jot down, as specifically as you can, what you think will happen to your body as you physically die and once you are physically dead.\"\nFollowing the threat-induction task, administer the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form (PANAS-X)61 to allow self-reporting of potential effects of the cTBS intervention on emotional responses to the threat induction, as well as to distract the participants from the death prime encountered earlier in the protocol55.\nNext, administer the relevant ideological judgment tasks.NOTE: In the example given here, group bias and religious conviction were assessed. If more than two measures are employed, present them in a counterbalanced order.\n\t\nTo assess group bias with regard to ideological conflict, present participants with two essays ostensibly written by immigrants to the United States from Latin America (counterbalanced order) and ask participants to evaluate the authors and their arguments62. Note that there are intentional grammatical errors included in both essays which should not be corrected.\n\t\t\nPresent the \"Pro-U.S.\" essay:\n\t\t\tThe first thing that hit me when I came to this country, was the incredible freedom people had. Freedom to go to school, freedom to work any job you want. In this country people can go to school and train for the job they want. Here anyone who works hard can make their own success. In my country most people live in poverty with no chance of escape. In this country people have more opportunity for success than any other and success does not depend on the group belong to. While there are problems in any country, America truly is a great nation and I don't regret my decision to come here at all.\"\nPresent the\"Anti-U.S.\" essay:When I first came to this country I believed it was the \"land of opportunity\" but I soon realized this was only true for the rich. The system here is set up for the rich against the poor. All people care about here is money and trying to have more than other people. This no sympathy for people. It's all one group putting down others and nobody cares about the foreigners. The people only let foreigners have jobs like pick fruit or wash dishes because no American would do it. Americans are spoiled and lazy and want everything handed to them. America is a cold country that is unsensitive to needs and problems of foreigners. It thinks it's a great country but its not.\"\nAfter presenting each essay, ask participants to rate their agreement with six statements using an 8-point Likert scale (1= 'Strongly Disagree'; 8 = 'Strongly Agree'): (i) \"I like the person who wrote this\", (ii) \"I think this person is intelligent\", (iii) \"This is the kind of person I would like to work with\", (iv) \"I think this person is honest\", (v) \"I agree with this person's views\", and (vi) \"I think this person's opinions of America are true.\"\nAssess these responses for reliability and, if sufficiently reliable, average them. To explore potentially distinct effects of cTBS on personal affiliation (items I - iv) versus ideological agreement (items v and vi), average them to create submeasures (see Figure 1).\nMeasure religious conviction according to a modified version of the Supernatural Belief Scale63 (SBS) in which two distinct subscales tap positive and negative aspects of Western religious belief, mirroring the positive and negative valence of the two essays in the group bias measure.Present the SBS items in random order (positive scale: i - iii; negative scale: iv - vi), rated according to the same scale employed in the group bias measure: (i) \"There exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God\"; (ii) \"There exist good personal spiritual beings, whom we might call angels\"; (iii) \"Some people will go to heaven when they die\"; (iv) \"There exists an evil personal spiritual being, whom we might call the Devil\"; (v) \"There exist evil, personal spiritual beings, whom we might call demons\", and (vi) \"Some people will go to hell when they die.\"\nAssess the responses for each subscale for reliability and average them if sufficiently reliable.", "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSodium depletion\nTiming: 24 h\nThis step will use furosemide to induce diuresis.

For pharmacological experiments, this time may need to be adjusted accordingly for different drugs.\nClean the insides of the plastic tubes of the water-containing volumetric drinking tubes, by scrubbing gently under distilled water.\nFill volumetric drinking tubes with distilled water and sodium chloride solutions.\nEnsure that all air bubbles are removed from the inside of the valves by tapping on them lightly.\nPress on the Lixit valve lever to ensure that liquid flows from the valve.Drain out any remaining liquid inside the valves with a dry paper towel (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nCritical: Liquid remaining inside the valves can substantially alter measurements, leading to inconsistent results.\nBackfill the volumetric drinking tubes to full capacity using a 30\u00a0mL syringe with a 21G needle.\nNote: We perform steps 11 and 12 away from mice, in a different room, to avoid disturbing them.\nAt 24\u00a0h after sodium depletion, replace both distilled water and sodium chloride solution containing volumetric drinking tubes back to the home cage of mice.\nMeasure water and sodium chloride intake every hour for 4 h.\nNote: The duration of the test and frequency of measurements may need to be adjusted according to the study. We have found that a 4-hour assay is sufficient to measure elevated sodium intake in mice (Park et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), but other investigators also have used variable time intervals from as short as 1\u20132\u00a0h to as long as 6\u201324\u00a0h (Jarvie and Palmiter, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Matusda et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Resch et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Rowland and Morian, 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Ryan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1244-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03.

An advantage of this method is the fact that maltose-binding protein (MBP) binds to a positively charged resin at pH 5.5, where most other proteins do not bind. Moreover, the MBP-fusion protein can be purified in a one-step MBP affinity purification with high quality. This step is critical since the resultant purified protein will be used for the second step of this protocol.\nPre-culture\nTiming: 10\u00a0min; day 1\nNote: For this protocol we used the pDESTH1 vector (Ampicillin resistant).\nAdd 5\u00a0mL LB medium, 0.2% glucose, and 10\u00a0\u03bcL Ampicillin (stock 50\u00a0mg/ mL) to a culture tube.\nInoculate with a single bacterial colony from the agar plate (from day 0).\nCulture at 37\u00b0C and shake for 16 h.\nNote: The LB medium can be stored at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C for 1\u00a0month. 50% glucose can be stored at 4\u00b0C for 6\u00a0months and Ampicillin should be store at -20 for up to 6\u00a0months.\nProtein induction\nTiming: 5\u20136 h; day 2\nIn an Erlenmeyer flask, inoculate 500\u00a0mL of rich medium glucose (0.2%) and Ampicillin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/ mL) with 5\u00a0mL of a culture of cells grown for 16\u00a0h containing the fusion plasmid. Mix well and measure the starting OD of the culture.\nNote: The rich medium can be stored at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C for up to 1\u00a0month.\nNote: Glucose is necessary in the growth medium to repress the maltose genes on the chromosome of the E. coli host, one of which is an amylase that can degrade the amylose on the affinity resin.After 2 h, measure the optical density (OD) of the culture A600 \u223c 0.5 (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 cells/mL), add IPTG to a final concentration of 1\u00a0mM, and incubate the culture at 37\u00b0C for 3 h.\nNote: IPTG can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C in dark for up to 9\u00a0months.\nNote: The time and temperature until the OD of the culture reach an optical density of 0.5 can vary with the host strain and the stability of the protein.\nDivide the induced culture to two 500\u00a0mL polypropylene bottles (e.g., Beckman Coulter), centrifuge the culture at 4,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellets in 25\u00a0mL column buffer (500\u00a0mL of culture), and freeze the sample for 16\u00a0h at \u221220\u00b0C.\nCritical: To avoid degradation of the protein, add 0.1\u00a0mM PMSF (phenyl methylsulfonyl fluoride) and protease inhibitor cocktail (1\u00d7). Harvest the cells quickly and keep them chilled.\nNote: PMSF can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C in dark; it should be stable for at least two years. The column buffer can be stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 6\u00a0months.\nPause point: The resuspended pellet can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C for up to one month.\nProtein purification\nTiming: 5\u20136 h; day 3\nThaw the sample in cold water.\nTransfer the sample to a 50\u00a0mL Nalgene centrifuge tube, place in an ice bath, and sonicate in short pulses of 15 s.\nNote: The sonication program parameters used were: amplitude: 37, process time: 2:00\u00a0min, pulse on: 0:15 s, pulse off: 0:15 s, temperature monitoring and shutdown: 115\u00b0C.\nNote: Keep the samples on ice to avoid degradation of the protein.Centrifuge the sample at 20,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, keep the supernatant (crude extract), and dilute the crude extract 1:2 with column buffer (total\u00a0= 50\u00a0mL).\nNote: It is important to add 0.1\u00a0mM of PMSF (phenyl methylsulfonyl fluoride) and protease inhibitor cocktail (1\u00d7) to avoid degradation of the protein.\nTransfer 3\u00a0mL of amylose resin to a 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012\u00a0cm polypropylene column.\nNote: The binding capacity of the amylose resin is 2\u20133\u00a0mg fusion protein/mL bed volume.\nWash the column five times with 15\u00a0mL column buffer.\nLoad the diluted crude extract at a flow rate of no more than 1.87\u00a0mL/min.\nNote: The flow rate should be 1.87\u00a0mL/minute for a 1.5\u00a0cm column ([50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(1.5)2] mL/hour).\nWash the column with 36\u00a0mL of column buffer at a flow rate of no more than 3.75\u00a0mL/min.\nNote: The flow rate should be 3.75\u00a0mL/minute for a 1.5\u00a0cm column ([100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(1.5)2] mL/hour).\nElute the fusion protein with column buffer\u00a0+ 10\u00a0mM maltose and collect 15 fractions of 500\u00a0\u03bcL each.\nNote: The elution buffer (column buffer\u00a0+ 10\u00a0mM maltose) should be prepared fresh.\nNote: The maltose solution can be stored at 4\u00b0C for 3\u00a0days; for long-term storage (6\u00a0months), stock solutions should be stored at \u221220\u00b0C. It is recommended that the maltose solution is prepared and used at the same day.\nRun 15\u00a0\u03bcL of each elution in an acrylamide gel and quantify using Bradford protein assay, the fractions containing the purified protein (Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1703-Fig1.jpg\nFigure\u00a01.

Currently, different protocols for affinity purification of antibodies are available. Here, we offer an inexpensive and accurate method to obtain a pure and intact antibody for the IP experiment.\nTake 800\u00a0\u03bcg of the purified protein and run on an SDS-PAGE gel.\nNote: This protocol is an optimization of the protocol provided by Agrisera (https://www.agrisera.com/en/info/affinity-purification-of-antibodies-low-amount-of-antigen-available.html[href=https://www.agrisera.com/en/info/affinity-purification-of-antibodies-low-amount-of-antigen-available.html]).\nNote: We suggest using Nupage 4\u201312 Bis-Tris gel 1.5\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 wells (Invitrogen, NP0335B0X) and a run time of 38\u00a0min.

The running intensity is defined by the speed and slope that corresponds to the \u201caerobic power\u201d needed. A moderate intensity run is often considered as 45%\u201375% of the maximal running capacity (Hawley et\u00a0al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). To determine the maximum power, you need to perform a treadmill test together with gas analyzer equipment and obtain the VO2max/VO2peak (Hoydal et\u00a0al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]; Petrosino et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]). A simpler, yet less accurate, alternative is to do an incremental speed test until mice cannot run anymore and obtain the maximum velocity (Vmax), which correlates with VO2max/VO2peak (Jordan et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Picoli et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]) . In this protocol we use a speed of 22\u201325\u00a0cm/s which is considered as moderate intensity (within \u223c60% of their maximal velocity), as untrained C57BL/6J mice reach a Vmax on average at 40\u00a0cm/s (Ezagouri et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). The moderate intensity running session lasts a few hours, depending on the time of the day, until animals reach fatigue (see below).\nNote: the duration of this protocol is different than an acceleration speed protocol that lasts a few minutes, until mice are unable to maintain the elevated running speed and increased workload, which is accompanied by elevated blood lactate levels, and often referred to as \u201crun to exhaustion.\u201d\nCritical: As oxygen and energy needs differ relative to body size and composition, make sure you record the bodyweights in your study and preferably use weight-matched animals.\nHabituate mice to run on the treadmill\nTiming: 30\u00a0min \u00d7 number of days neededHabituation period is needed for mice to get familiar with the treadmill and the running protocol. During this period, mice learn to avoid the shock grid. It was previously reported that for C57BL/6 mice, one to two short (5\u201310\u00a0min) sessions at low speed (15\u201317\u00a0cm/s) are enough to minimize their contact with the grid (Dougherty et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Marcaletti et\u00a0al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]). We, therefore, use a single habituation session the day before the test when working with C57BL/6J mice. However, additional familiarization sessions might be required for other mouse strains and depend as well on their age, and health status (see: Troubleshooting: Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]). When the purpose is to evaluate running capacity in sedentary non-exercised mice, it is also recommended to minimize as much as possible any training effects on performance. This can be achieved by using relatively lower speed. In case more habituation sessions are needed, scheduling these sessions every other day over a week may be considered (Castro and Kuang, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Fan et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nA day before the test, mice are acclimatized to the treadmill at the same ZT of the running test.\nNote: Exercise bouts were shown to affect the muscle molecular clock depending on the time of day (Wolff and Esser, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib43]; Wolff and Esser, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib44]). Therefore, performing the habituation sessions and the running tests at the same ZT are likely to reduce related confounding effects.\nCritical: If you perform the experiment within the dark phase work under red light. If necessary, use black cloth to cover the cages while transferring the animals to the treadmill.\nGently pick up the mice by the tail and individually place them in separate lanes.\nAllow them to freely explore it for 5\u00a0min (speed 0\u00a0cm/s; shocks on)Turn on the treadmill belt and increase the speed to 12\u00a0cm/s.\nIncrease the speed by 1\u00a0cm/s every minute until reaching 22\u00a0cm/s.\nContinue running mice at 22\u00a0cm/s for 5\u00a0min.\nWhen you are done, return the mice to their cages.\nNote: you might find it easier to pick up mice by the tail from the treadmill while the belt is still running.\nRun mice at a moderate intensity to evaluate running capacity\nTiming: variable; few hoursTo reliably determine running capacity, the endpoint as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria should be well defined. The challenge is to decide on when the mice reach fatigue, and as discussed below (see limitation section) one can find different protocols in the literature. Based on early studies from the Evan\u2019s lab (Fan et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Narkar et\u00a0al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]) and our experience, we defined two criteria for fatigue, and observing either of them is an indication to stop the run and return the animal to its cage. At the beginning of the test, sedentary C57BL/6J usually cope well with the speed and run toward the front of the belt. After few hours, they spend more time at the rear of the treadmill belt and blood glucose levels progressively decline (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Hence, the first criterion is reaching blood glucose levels of \u226470\u00a0mg/dL. We did notice, however, that in the case of some mutant mouse models (e.g., Per1/2 null mice (Ezagouri et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16])), after running a certain distance, the animals are reluctant to run and spend a considerable time in contact with the gird, while their blood glucose levels remain above 70\u00a0mg/dL. We, therefore, included a second criterion, namely spending more than 5 accumulative seconds in contact with the grid within a 30\u00a0min window after at least 1\u00a0h run.\nNote: In the case of C57BL/6J, if mice spend more than 5 accumulative seconds in contact with the grid within a 30\u00a0min window already within the first hour of the run, they are excluded from the experiment. (Troubleshooting: Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1])\nIf you perform the experiment in the active (dark) phase work under red light. If necessary, use black cloth to cover the cages while transferring them to the treadmill location.Measure the initial blood glucose levels by using glucometer:\nGet supplies ready for use:\nPrepare sharp and clean scissors\nMoisten a small piece of paper towel or gauze with water or 70% ethanol\nPlace glucose strip into the glucometer\nGently remove the mouse from the cage and record its weight.\nPick up the mouse by the tail and place it on the wire lid or on your coat to allow it to get a grip.\nKeep holding the mouse with your non-dominant hand and cut 1\u20132\u00a0mm from the tail tip.\nNote: If prior tail biopsies have been performed (e.g., for genotyping purpose) lateral tail vein incision will suffice.\nGently massage the tail from the center of the tail to the tip to allow for blood flow.\nPlace the blood sample on the glucometer strip and record the results (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/463-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. An example of glucose monitoring from a mouse tail tip\nApply gentle pressure with dry paper towel or gauze for approximately 10\u00a0s to stop the bleeding.\nPlace the mouse in the lane.\nRepeat for all mice that are expected to start the run.\nWhen you are done start the free exploration session (5\u00a0min; speed 0\u00a0cm/s; shocks on)\nTurn on the treadmill belt and increase the speed to 12\u00a0cm/s, then increase the speed by 1\u00a0cm/s every minute until reaching 25\u00a0cm/s.\nContinue running mice at 25\u00a0cm/s until they reach fatigue according to the criteria describe above.\nTake mice for blood glucose measurements every 30\u00a0min to monitor fatigue status. Usually, a rise in blood glucose levels appears during the first 30\u00a0min, but overall glucose levels are expected to gradually decline throughout the test (Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/463-Fig4.jpgFigure\u00a04.

It is faster and easier to grab the mouse while it is still running. This way you do not disturb the running of the other mice while you take the necessary measurement.\nPlace the mouse on a wire lid or on your coat to allow it to get a grip. Use wet paper towel or gauze and gently remove the scab.\nCritical: Removing the scab and allowing fresh blood flow by massaging (\u201cmilking\u201d) the tail is important to get reliable glucose reads.\nPlace the blood sample on the glucometer strip and record the results (Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nOnce you are done place the mouse back in its lane.\nOptional: The protocol can be modified depending on your experimental question:\nTo induce training effect, use the protocol for shorter durations (e.g., 30\u201360\u00a0min) several days a week for a few weeks (Ferreira et\u00a0al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Jordan et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Massett and Berk, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]; Narkar et\u00a0al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]).\nFor tissues harvesting for further processing and analysis, stop the protocol at a pre-defined time and sacrifice the mice.

A video of mice running on treadmill, related to step 14Compare left and right lane: on the right lane a mouse that can sustain the intensity of the run, and on the left lane a mouse that shows fatigue signs.\nDissecting soleus, gastrocnemius plantaris, and quadriceps muscles for further analyses\nTiming: 10\u201330\u00a0min\nHere we describe how to dissect different types of skeletal muscle for further analysis, comparing running versus sedentary conditions. This is valuable if you wish to study molecular changes occurring in skeletal muscles during the running session, once animals reach fatigue, or even later on upon recovery.\nNote: It is recommended to recognize the structure of the muscles and get familiar with the relevant anatomy. Briefly, muscles are connected to bones through tendons, and to the body by connective tissue, therefore make sure you dissect a muscle that is clean of irrelevant tissues as much as possible.Critical: There are two valid options for selecting the sedentary control group. Given that the run can last for several hours, and that this time duration by itself might lead to some metabolic/physiologic changes this should be taken into consideration. Hence, you can either sacrifice the control group at the time that corresponds to the start or the end of the run. For example, in the case of a mouse that started the running protocol at ZT14 and run for 3 h. One option is to have a similar end point for the sedentary control group, i.e., ZT17. In this case, the sedentary control group are placed near the treadmill in individual cages without food and water, which is as close as possible to the running conditions. You can also sacrifice the control group at a separate day after keeping the mice in the treadmill\u2019s lanes without turning on the running belt for the same duration as the running group. Another option is to sacrifice the control group at ZT14 to get a picture of the condition before the run. It is recommended, therefore, to take this into consideration when designing the experiment and interpreting the results.\nSacrifice the mouse at the desirable time after running.\nNote: We found that cervical dislocation without anesthesia is the preferable technique as it is relatively rapid and enables sacrificing several animals within a short time. Nevertheless, cervical dislocation can damage blood vessels, resulting in internal hemorrhaging. Therefore, this technique is not recommended if a large volume of blood is needed for future analysis, and alternative techniques should be considered.Immediately after the mouse is sacrificed, lay it on the dissection board in a prone position. Stabilize its feet with needles / tapes, and spray ethanol on the lower body until the fur becomes wet (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/463-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05. Dissection of mouse soleus (Sol), gastrocnemius plantaris (Gas), and quadriceps (Quad) muscles\nNote: At this stage you can freely work under light.\nUse the forceps to lift the skin around the distal part of the spine (In the middle of the transverse line between the two points where the hind limbs are connected with the body) and make an incision using a pair of scissors (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nUse the forceps to lift the skin around the incision side that is closest to the hind limb. Insert the scissors between the uplifted skin and the body and make an opening move with the blunt side of the scissors touching the internal side of the skin to enlarge the incision toward the posterior side of the hind limb (over the hamstring and the gastrocnemius muscles). Cut the skin gently\u00a0with the scissors each time the incision is large enough until the Achilles tendon is exposed (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nAfter the Achilles tendon is exposed, gently hold the skin of the anterior part of the distal hind\u00a0limb with your fingers then peel the skin of the mouse hind limb until it is completely visible (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).Use the forceps to pick up the distal part of the Achilles tendon, and hold it firmly. Using the second hand, stick the point of the scissors between the spot where the Achilles tendon is connected to the gastrocnemius muscle (the proximal end part of the Achilles tendon) and the tibia / fibula bones. The scissors should stick to the bones to create a space between the muscle and the bones. Keeping the scissors closed, slide them along the bones and toward the knee until you reach the patella. If performed correctly the gastrocnemius plantaris and soleus are now separated from the bones (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G, Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nUsing the forceps, hold the proximal edge of the Achilles tendon, then cut distal to it. Make sure you cut the tendon in its distal end in order to avoid the cutting of the distal part of the soleus (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]H, Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nKeep holding the hind limb muscles by the tendon (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]I, Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nLocate the soleus muscle, and use scissors to cut the proximal end of the soleus tendon. If performed correctly, the soleus will pop up (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]J, Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nUse the forceps to hold the proximal part of the soleus (the detached part), gently pull it up so the whole muscle can be clearly observed. Cut the distal tendon to completely isolate it. Put the dissected muscle inside a tube and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]K, Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).Use the forceps to hold the Achilles leftovers (on the distal part of the gastrocnemius plantaris) in parallel to the bones, using the scissors in the second hand cut the non-muscle tissue around the proximal part of the gastrocnemius plantaris, along the bones until the muscle is fully detached. Use the scissors to clear the muscle of any non-muscle tissues. Put the gastrocnemius plantaris inside a tube and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]L and 5M).\nNote: The plantaris muscle is synergist to soleus and gastrocnemius, but more similar to gastrocnemius in terms of fiber type composition and metabolic profile (Sawano et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib42]). The plantaris is enmeshed within the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, and separating the two can be challenging. Due to its similarities to gastrocnemius and its significantly smaller mass we collect them together.\nCross the leg to the other side of the body (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]N), and stabilize it to the dissection board using a needle so a 90 degrees angle of the knee joint is formed.\nUse the forceps to pick up the quadriceps so a space is created between the muscle and the femur. Use the scissors to make a cut between the muscle and the femur, as close as possible to the bone. Then cut along the bone toward its proximal end until the muscle detaches (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]O). Using the forceps, hold the distal part of the detached quadriceps, and with the scissors in the other hand, make a cut toward the proximal end of the muscle and along the bone until the muscle is linked to the body only by connective tissue (Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]P). Using the scissors, clear the muscle of any non-muscle tissue. Put the muscle inside a tube and freeze instantly in liquid nitrogen.

Setting-up the Study Room\nInstall the assessment on a computer in a quiet room and free of distractions. Make sure that the subject does not have access to any materials that can be used to take notes.\n\t\nEnsure that the computer is at a table or desk at a comfortable sitting height. Place a wired mouse on the table with enough room for the subject to rest their arm in order to prevent fatigue.\nPlug in the external speakers prior to starting the program.\nSet up two chairs, one directly in front of the computer for the subject and one to the side and slightly behind the other chair for the administrator to sit in. A rater should be present at all times during the administration of the assessment.\nPrior to administering the assessment, set up the program.\n\t\nDouble Click on the icon labeled \"Play VRFCAT.\"\nIf this is a returning subject, enter in the previously created Patient ID and Password and click \"Confirm.\" If this is a new subject, click New Profile and then create a new Patient ID and Password for the subject and click \"Confirm.\"Type in the Site Number, select the subject's Date of Birth, type in the Age, select the subject's Handedness and Gender, type in the Rater Initials, select the Study,* and select the Visit*. Then click \"Confirm.\" NOTE: *These elements can be customized. Please see the assessment manual for further information.\n3. Administering the Assessment\nTo initiate the administration of the task, sit the subject down at the chair directly in front of the computer. If this is the subject's first time with the assessment, use the default Scenario: \"Tutorial\" and the default Mini Scenario: \"Apartment.\"\n\t\nIf this is not the subject's first time with the assessment select the appropriate test version from the Scenario drop down menu and click \"Confirm.\" Please note that the previous version the subject completed will have turned from green to red. This will help to ensure that the same version is not administered twice to a subject.\nA rater should remain present during the entire administration of the assessment. If the subject asks what they are supposed to be doing, direct the subject to click on the audio icon in the top left corner. If the subject stops paying attention or at any point looks away from the screen, redirect the subject back to the task.\nTake the necessary precautions to try to ensure that the subject will not need a break during the administration of the assessment, but in extreme circumstances, the assessment can be paused and continued at a later time. To do so, press the \"Esc\" key on the keyboard, and a menu labeled Game Paused will appear.In the event that the subject is taking a short break, simply click \"Main Menu,\" type in the Admin Code, \"admin,\" and click \"Yes.\" The assessment will then go back to the screen to select what Mini Scenario is needed to start the subject on when they return. All completed Mini Scenarios will have turned from green to red.\nIf the subject is unable to complete the entire version that day, and must come back another day, click \"Exit\" on the Game Paused menu, type in the Admin Code, \"admin,\" and click \"Yes.\" This will shut down the program. Once the subject returns, log back into the program with the correct Patient ID and password, and select the appropriate Scenario and Mini Scenario from the drop down menus. All completed Mini Scenarios will have turned from green to red.\nOnce the subject has completed all four Mini Scenarios (Apartment, Bus to Store, Store, and Bus to Apartment) a screen saying \"Congratulations! You have completed the task! Please let your test administrator know that you have finished,\" will appear. Click \"Continue,\" and on the next screen click \"Begin New Scenario.\"In the box labeled \"Admin Code\" type in \"admin\" and click \"Yes.\"\n\t\nIf the subject completed the test version instead of the tutorial, click \"Exit Application.\" In the box labeled \"Admin Code\" type in \"admin,\" click \"Yes,\" and the session is complete.\n\t\t\nSelect the appropriate test version from the Scenario drop down menu and click \"Confirm.\" NOTE: The Scenario labeled Tutorial should now have changed from green to red because the subject has completed the entire Scenario.Once the subject has completed all four Mini Scenarios a screen will appear that says, \"Congratulations! You have completed the task! Please let your test administrator know that you have finished.\" Click \"Continue,\" and on the next screen click \"Exit Application.\" In the box labeled \"Admin Code\" type in \"admin\" and click \"Yes,\" and the session is complete.\n4. Potential Deviations\nIf the subject attempts to complete any of the objectives out of order, remind them that they must complete the task described in the instructions at the top of the screen before moving onto the next task.\nIf the subject has used up all of their virtual change during the Tutorial scenario and is unable to complete the final objective, escape out of the game using the above listed methods to return to the Scenario selection menu. Encourage the subject to try to not to use up all of their coins during the early objectives, and readminster the entire tutorial.\n\t\nIf the subject has used up all of their virtual change during the any of the other scenarios and is unable to complete the final objective, escape out of the game using the above listed methods to return to the Scenario selection menu. This data point will be considered missing, and do not readminister any of the scenarios.", "1. Experimental Setup\nMaterial and Setup for the Rubber Hand Illusion Setup\nUse a box for the RHI paradigm which includes a cover for the participants own hand. Use a gown to also cover the shoulder and arm of the participant as well as the part of the rubber hand which goes up to the wrist.\nObtain an artificial hand. This hand does not necessarily have to be made out of rubber (the name 'rubber hand illusion' was given because a rubber hand was used in seminal work 7). For example prostheses can be used.\nUse two soft brushes to deliver brush strokes in the RHI.\nUse a metronome, a pre-recorded sound file or experimental software to provide timing signals for the experimenter who delivers the brush strokes.\nExperimental Setup - Material and Setup for the Crossmodal Congruency Task\nFor the crossmodal congruency task, use tactors to deliver tactile stimuli. For example small speakers, bone conductors (from hearing aids) or electromagnetic solenoid-type stimulators can be employed. Use 'dummy tactors' for the rubber hand.\nControl tactile stimulus delivery via the computer sound output, via an interface card or TTL pulses.\nFix the position of the speakers in the box.\nUse for example light emitting diodes (LEDs) to deliver visual stimuli. These can be controlled with TTL pulses from a computer parallel card and powered for example using an USB port or batteries.\nUse experimental software to program stimulus presentation.\nBlock any potential sound which could arise during the delivery of tactile stimuli. For example use headphones and white noise.\nRecord responses for example using a response box, a computer mouse or a keyboard.\n2. ParticipantsAll aspects of the experiment are in accord with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and have been approved by our local ethics committee (Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee, Australia).\nObtain written informed consent for participation prior to the start of the experiment.\nParticipants with visual or tactile deficits especially for the stimulated locations need to be excluded.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nEnsure that participants are sitting in a comfortable position.\nEnsure participants can see the rubber hand and not their own hand.\nInclude training blocks so participants become familiar with the crossmodal congruency task. Ideally first use practice trials without crossmodal visual stimuli in order to accustom participants to the tactile targets and then use practice trials with visual stimulus presentation and no-go trials (see below).\nOn each crossmodal congruency trial present one tactile stimulus and one visual stimulus to one of the locations, either in spatially congruent locations (same fingers) or incongruent locations (different fingers).\nInstruct participants to respond and discriminate the location of the tactile targets as fast as and as accurately as possible.\nLocate a fixation point between the lights which participants should fixate throughout the experiment.\nUse no-go trials in order to ensure that participants are looking at the stimuli. For example ask participants to withhold their response if the lights in both locations turn on at the same time. When participants regularly press a button during these trials, then this can indicate that they are not looking at the lights.\nUse supra-threshold stimuli and make sure participants can see/feel the stimuli.\nIntroduce a short delay (150-250 msec) between visuotactile crossmodal stimuli in order to reduce interference of these stimuli on the RHI itself.\nInclude sufficient number of congruent and incongruent trials for each condition (about 60-100 trials).Present congruent and incongruent trials in different locations in a randomized sequence.\nKeep in mind that response requirements and mappings might affect the CCE magnitude 24.\nIn order to induce the RHI use brush stroking for 1 to 3 min before the crossmodal congruency task and then stroke once before every crossmodal congruency trial.\nTo induce the RHI illusion use synchronous brush stroking, where both hands should be touched at the same time and in the same location.\nUse asynchronous stroking as a control condition, where both hands should be stroked with a temporal offset.\nMake sure the experimenter can comfortably perform the stroking.\nYou can also use RHI rating scales to monitor subjective experiences during the RHI paradigm. Some researcher suggest to use both objective and subjective measures for the rubber hand illusion paradigm for example 25. Obtain the rating responses after the task block if you would like to compare it to CCE effects because the task itself may modulate the RHI experience.\n4. Data Analysis\nTrials in which participants responded too soon (e.g. faster than 200 msec after stimulus onset) or too slow (e.g. later than 1,500 msec) should be discarded from the analysis: check for potential significant differences between conditions for number of discarded trials.\nAnalyze the number of false alarms in no-go trials: check for potential significant differences between conditions for number of false alarms.\nObtain the average or median for performance measures (response time for speed and response error for accuracy) for each participant and each condition.\nOnly use response times for correct trials.\nIt is also possible to combine response time and error to a single measure: Inverse Efficiency (IE) = Response time/Error 17.\nCalculate and depict crossmodal congruency effects = performance on incongruent minus congruent trials for every trial and condition.Use statistical tests in order to assess the statistical significance of condition differences (e.g. ANOVA, t-tests).", "**Day 1: _In vivo_ formaldehyde cross-linking of samples**\n1.

We typically record two plates at the same time to increase the throughput of the assay. The videos are the basis for further analysis of light avoidance using the custom scripts.\nPrepare staged larvae for light avoidance assays.\nTake plates with staged animals from the incubator.\nAdd distilled water to a plate containing staged larvae. After 1\u00a0min, pour the larvae into a petri dish on a dark surface.\nGently pick up larvae and put them in distilled water in a small container (e.g., Columbia staining jar) or petri dish.\nWash larvae by aspirating the water with a plastic pipette.\nUsing a paintbrush, gently move the larvae on a plain agar plate.\nIncubate the plate for 10\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C in a dark chamber (e.g., cardboard box or similar).\nNote: We use larvae at 96\u00a0h after egg laying, at which time point they are still foraging and\u00a0display consistent light avoidance behavior. To minimize variability, e.g., due to circadian rhythm dependent changes, it is also recommended to analyze light avoidance\u00a0behavior within a constant time window (Zeitgeber (ZT) 4\u20136), so depending on the light entrainment cycle of your incubator (typically 12\u00a0h light/12\u00a0h dark) 4\u20136\u00a0h after light onset)).\nTwo-choice light avoidance assay. Preparing the setup and animals for recording and acquiring the behavioral videos.\nPlace fresh agar plates in the light avoidance chamber such that half of the plate is in darkness while the other part of the plate is illuminated from below.\nPlace the LED frame surrounding the agar plates.Transfer 20 larvae from the plate (in dark chamber) to a staining jar or small petri dish with distilled water, aspirate water.\nPlace 20 larvae per plate in the middle of light-dark border.\nStart the camera recording in the software after all animals have been placed and record the behavior for 16\u00a0min.\nStop the recording, remove, and discard the animals and plates.\nAlternatives: The number of assayed plates can be scaled down or up depending on the number of available animals. The size of the chamber and light source used for the assay. Keep in mind that placing the larvae on the plate takes some time and the recording should only be started once all plates are ready to avoid having handling artifacts in the video, which might affect their further processing.\nCritical: Do not reuse agar plates, use fresh plates for each trial (larvae leave trails on\u00a0plates that affect behavior in subsequent trials). Make sure that the agar plates are horizontally and vertically aligned between the recordings and therefore have the\u00a0same coordinates in all recordings. Do not move the position of the camera. Consider drawing a reference circle or attach a place holder for the arena to position\u00a0the agar plates in a highly reproducible way. This ensures homogenous data enabling semiautomatic data analysis, improves the quality of the results and generally saves time. Make sure that the filenames do not contain whitespaces and symbols (!\"#$&'()\u2217;<=>?[\\]\u02c6`{|}\u223c), as they will likely disrupt the function of the scripts for the following analysis.\nCustomized script for temporal analysis of light avoidance behavior\nTiming: 1\u20132 hIn this section, we describe how to install all necessary analysis software, preprocess the available recordings by converting them into suitable format, cropping and subtracting the background, and analyze the intensities that represent the distribution of larvae over time on the different parts of the plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The first step in the script reduces the frame number to a reasonable and biologically meaningful number resulting in discrete time points (here, we use every 200th frame equaling time points 8\u00a0s apart). Next, all frames are cropped to retain only the region of interest containing the two-choice assay plates. Finally, the videos are saved in the \u2217.avi format, which can be handled by Fiji. The cropped and converted \u2217.avi files are then processed with a script to remove background and obtain binary image series, with larvae having maximum intensity, while the background is set to 0. Reading out the intensities derived from the larvae on each side of the plate (light and dark) provides a basis to plot relative intensities over time that correlate with the number of animals at any given time point.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2099-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Workflow of the video analysis\nIn the first step, using the ffmpeg software with the reprocess_video.bat script or another equivalent approach, \u2217.mp4 format video files are (1) reduced for frame number (e.g., every 200th frame), (2) cropped to remove unnecessary parts of the video, and (3) and converted into the \u2217.avi format. In the second step, using Fiji and the reprocess_avi_and_get_means.ijm script, the processed \u2217.avi videos are (4) masked to generate binary, black-and-white images, and then (5) analyzed by generating ROIs measuring the intensity of the respective dark and light side of each arena. Generated data tables (\u2217.csv files) are then used to draw the graphical output of the data.Preprocess, convert and crop using the reprocess_videos_windows.bat script and ffmpeg converter or alternative video convertor.\nRun the script by typing reprocess_videos_windows.bat directly in the folder or in a command prompt.\nThe script creates three new folders: reduce, crop and avi. The file(s) for the subsequent analysis are located in the avi folder and has \u2217.avi extension.\nCritical: If you aligned the plates as described above before the recording (see step 2), settings for cropping can be kept the same for all experiments. Otherwise, adjust the coordinates for each video separately. Correct cropping of videos should be verified before the next step.\nSubtract static background from the recording, apply masking to convert it into binary video (black background and white larvae), and extract intensities for the regions of interest.\nOpen Fiji by running ImageJ-win64.exe (ImageJ_linux.exe).\nGo to Plugins \u2192 Macros \u2192 Edit and open reprocess_avi_and_get_means.ijm script from the repository.\nIn the script, specify the path where the avi folder is located with the recording to be analyzed (do NOT include the avi folder itself in the path):\npath\u00a0= \"C:/Users/Public/.../Folder_with_recordings/\"\nSpecify the coordinates (X:Y:width:height) for the regions of interest (by default there are four rectangular regions corresponding to the light/dark part of each plate) in the function action() as\nmakeRectangle(0,0,512,1024);\nroiManager(\"Add\");\nmakeRectangle(512,0,512,1024);\nroiManager(\"Add\");\nmakeRectangle(1024,0,512,1024);\nroiManager(\"Add\");\nmakeRectangle(1536,0,512,1024);\nroiManager(\"Add\");\nPress \u201cRun\u201d button and wait the start of the preprocessing of the \u2217.avi video and subsequent extraction of the intensities in the recording.Critical: If you aligned the plates as described above before the recording (see step 2), settings for cropping can be kept for all experiments. Otherwise, adjust the coordinates for each video separately. The ROI size will also depend on the resolution of your camera and video (here 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01024 px). In any case, correct cropping of videos should be verified before the next step.\nThe Fiji analysis script produces \u2217.csv file with intensities corresponding to the larvae present in a given region of interest. As by default four regions of interest are set, the extraction procedure will result in a table with four columns: mean1 (light side plate 1), mean2 (dark side plate 1), mean3 (dark side plate 2) and mean4 (light side plate 2), where every column is related to the corresponding region of interest.\nCalculate the intensity distribution between the light and dark side as a performance index:\n  P e r f o r m a n c e  I n d e x   (  P I  )  =   I n t e n s i t y  (  d a r k  )  \u2212 I n t e n s i t y   ( l i g h t )    I n t e n s i t y  (  d a r k  )  + I n t e n s i t y   ( l i g h t )Optional: The background corrected binary \u2217.avi files can be used to visualize the temporal distribution of larvae on the agar plate: using the temporal color code plugin in Fiji (image -> Hyperstacks -> Temporal-Color Code, larval position can be color-coded based on the elapsed time since the beginning of the recording. The current color code plugin provided with Fiji is not functional, but a fixed version (Temporal-Color_Code2.ijm) can be obtained here (https://forum.image.sc/t/temporal-color-code-bug/41323/7[href=https://forum.image.sc/t/temporal-color-code-bug/41323/7]). Place this file in the respective Fiji folder (\u2026/Fiji.app/plugins/Scripts/Image/Hyperstacks) and start Fiji.", "The administration instructions provided here are similar to those that have been approved previously by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Irvine.\n1. Equipment\nTest participants in a child-safe room that has an adult-sized table with three chairs (one for the researcher, one for the parent, and one for the child). Alternatively, test children in their homes at their own table or on a portable table provided by the researchers.\nUse a video camera placed on a tripod to record the child (audio and video) as he/she participates in the study. Place the video camera so that the recording clearly shows the participant and the object of his/her gaze as well as each of the completed target actions.\n2. Testing Procedures\nWarm-up\n\t\nSeat the child directly across from the researcher at the adult-sized table. Sit children younger than 13 months old on the lap of a parent. Sit older children on a booster seat that is attached to an adult-sized chair unless they request to sit on the parent's lap. If the child is seated in a booster seat, sit the parent at the table next to the child.\nEngage the child in play with age-appropriate toys unrelated to the study so as to establish comfort with the researcher and the testing environment. Next, show children younger than 13 months old how to put a shape into the top or the side of a commercially-available shape sorter toy while narrating the action by saying, \"Put it in.\"26,27,43-45 Give older children a plastic ball and Slinky. Roll the ball across the table while saying \"Roll it\" and then put the ball inside of the Slinky while saying, \"Put it in.\"\nConduct each demonstration twice in succession before allowing the child the opportunity to imitate.Proceed once the child has interacted and shared toys with the researcher.\nBaseline\n\t\nPut the sequence materials for the first event on the table; ensure that the same standardized order is used across participants.\nPush the props towards the child while providing a general verbal prompt to encourage interaction with the sequence materials, such as, \"What can you do with this stuff?\".\nProvide positive reinforcement as the child interacts with the props, both when he/she performs the target actions and when he/she is engaging with the sequence materials more generally. For example, say, \"Good job!\" or \"That's a neat idea!\" as the child explores the props. If the child does not interact with the first sequence at baseline, repeat Section 2.1.2.\nIf the child appears distracted, call his/her name or tap on the sequence materials in an attempt to redirect his/her attention to the task.28 Ensure that the props are not tapped in a manner that is suggestive of target actions or the order of their completion. Avoid use of phrases that suggest temporal order information, such as \"What do you do next?\" or \"Then what?\".\nAllow children younger than 13 months between 1\u00bd and 2 minutes to interact with the props.26,27,43-45 Terminate the baseline period for older children when the child engages in repetitive or off-task behaviors such as mouthing the props, repeatedly banging them on the table, or dropping them on the floor.28,31,33,42 Model each sequence immediately after the baseline phase of testing for that sequence is terminated.\nSequence Modeling\n\t\nBring the sequence materials back to the researcher's side of the table.\nReturn the sequence materials to their original, standardized positions in the researcher's lap (so the child cannot see what the researcher is doing) and put them back on the table.Make eye contact with the child. Provide him/her with the name of the sequence using infant-directed speech. For example, for the event Make a Shaker, say, \"I can use this stuff to Make a Shaker. Watch how I Make a Shaker with this stuff.\"\nPerform each target action with narration. For the event Make a Shaker, put the block into one of the two nesting cups while saying, \"Put in the block.\" Cover one of the nesting cups with the other while saying, \"Cover it up.\" Shake the assembled apparatus while saying, \"Shake it!\".\nPut all of the props back on the table, make eye contact with the child, and say, \"That's how I Make a Shaker with this stuff!\".\nEnsure that the child watches the researcher complete each of the demonstrated actions. If the child appears distracted, see Section 2.2.4.\nReturn the sequence materials to their original positions as indicated in Section 2.3.2.\nRe-model the actions required to complete event sequence one more time (2 demonstrations total) as indicated in Sections 2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, and 2.3.6.\nIf immediate imitation is not permitted, repeat Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 for each of the remaining event sequences in turn.\nImmediate Imitation\n\t\nBring the sequence materials back to the researcher's side of the table.\nReturn the sequence materials to their original, standardized positions (so the child cannot see what the researcher is doing) and put them back on the table.\nPush the props towards the child while providing the name of the event sequence as a retrieval cue. For example, when testing immediate imitation for Make a Shaker, say, \"You can use this stuff to Make a Shaker. How do you Make a Shaker just like I did?\".Allow children younger than 13 months old between 1\u00bd and 2 minutes to interact with the props.26,27,43,44 Terminate the imitation period for older children when the child engages in the repetitive or off-task behaviors listed in Section 2.2.5.28,31,33,42\nProvide positive reinforcement as the child interacts with the sequences as indicated in Section 2.2.3.\nRepeat Section 2.2.4 if the child appears distracted during the imitation period.\nIf immediate imitation is permitted, repeat Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 for each of the remaining event sequences in turn.\nAdditional Re-exposure Sessions (After Delays of Days to Weeks)\n\t\nComplete the warm-up procedure described in Section 2.1.2.\nRe-model the included event sequences as described in Section 2.3.\nIf immediate imitation is permitted, complete the immediate imitation procedure as described in Section 2.4. If immediate imitation is not permitted, allow the child to play with commercially-available distracter toys between sequence demonstrations so as to maintain his/her interest in the task.26,28,43,46\nRepeat Sections 2.5.2 and 2.5.3 for each of the remaining event sequences in turn.\nDelayed Recall\n\t\nComplete the warm-up procedure described in Section 2.1.2.\nPut the sequence materials for the first event on the table; ensure that the same standardized order is used across participants and sessions.\nPush the props towards the child while providing the name of the event sequence as a retrieval cue. For example, when testing delayed recall for Make a Shaker, say, \"You can use this stuff to Make a Shaker. How do you Make a Shaker with this stuff?\".Allow children younger than 13 months old between 1\u00bd and 2 minutes to interact with the props.26,27,43-45 Terminate the imitation period for older children when the child engages in the repetitive or off-task behaviors listed in Section 2.2.5.28,31,33,42 Participants may or may not reproduce the demonstrated target actions during the delayed recall period.\nProvide positive reinforcement as the child interacts with the sequences as indicated in Section 2.2.3.\nRepeat Section 2.2.4 if the child appears distracted during the delayed recall period.\nRepeat Sections 2.6.2 through 2.6.6 for each of the remaining event sequences in turn.\nData Coding and Reduction\n\t\nCreate coding rules for each event. The coding rules sheet includes description of when the child receives credit for completing an action and when credit is not awarded. Award credit when the child achieves the action demonstrated by the researcher or when the child clearly attempts to complete the action (intention can be determined in part by watching the child's gaze). Importantly, in all cases, write coding rules so that the child can complete the target actions in any order.\nCreate a data coding sheet that lists each of the included event sequences and the possible steps for each event.\nHave research assistants code videos that have been previously coded by the principal investigator or a senior lab member.\nWhile watching the videos, circle each target action completed by the child in the temporal order in which the actions are produced.\nCompare the codes by assigning a plus to each agreement and a minus to each disagreement. Train research assistants up to a reliability criterion of at least 90% on three consecutive participants before allowing them to code the study data.Compute the overall reliability by dividing the total number of agreements to the total number of codes. More commonly, reliability is coded by counting only the first occurrence of each coded action so as to reduce the likelihood of receiving credit for actions performed by chance or trial-and-error.26-28,31,33,42-45\nHave the trained coder score the remaining videos or have the tester code the data as they are collected (recommended only when participants are 13 months or older29,31).\nReduce the data to determine the number of target actions and pairs of actions produced for each event at each phase of testing (for example, baseline, immediate imitation, and delayed recall). Only the first occurrence of each target action is commonly considered during data reduction so as to reduce the likelihood of awarding credit for actions produced by chance or trial-and-error.28 Count the number of unique target actions that were coded by sequence (for example, a participant would receive a score of 3 target actions if he/she produced the following sequence of actions: 3-1-2-3).\nCount the number of pairs of actions completed by sequence when considering only the first time each target action was completed (for example, a participant would receive a score of 1 pair of actions if he/she produced the following sequence of actions: 3-1-2-3; a participant would also receive a score of 1 pair of actions if he/she produced the following sequence of actions: 1-3-2-1).\n\t\tNote: The maximum number of target actions possible is the total number of steps in the sequence, whereas the maximum number of pairs of actions is the maximum number of target actions possible minus one.\nCreate averages indicating the number of target actions performed at each phase of testing (baseline, immediate imitation, and delayed recall, for example), and for each condition (if applicable).Note: The elicited imitation procedure is administered and scored in the same way whether researchers use sequences with enabling, mixed, or arbitrary associations.28\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53347/53347fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Sample Data Coding Sheet for the Three-step Enabling Event Sequence Make a Shaker. The three target actions (\"Put it in,\" \"Cover it up,\" and \"Shake it\") are shown multiple times for each of three phases of testing (baseline, immediate imitation, and delayed recall).

Participant Recruitment, Screening, and Scheduling\nConduct a power analysis to determine the sample size needed to achieve the desired power and detect the expected effect size. The free software package G*Power14 is useful for this step.\nAfter opening G*Power, select F tests from the Test Family dropdown menu.\nSelect ANOVA: Repeated measures, within-between interaction from the Statistical test dropdown menu.\nSelect the A priori option from the Type of power analysis dropdown menu.\nEnter the predicted effect size in the Effect size f box.\nEnter the desired alpha value in the \u03b1 err prob box.\nEnter the desired power value in the Power (1-\u03b2 err prob) box.\nEnter 2 in the Number of groups box.\nEnter 2 in the Number of measurements box.\nEnter 0.7 in the Corr among rep measures box13.\nClick Calculate on the bottom right of the window. The total sample size needed for the experiment will be displayed in the Total sample size box.\nRecruit 10-20 participants beyond the recommended sample size to account for participant error or dropout.\nRecruit participants in the desired age range (e.g., 18-24 years old) who are native English speakers, are not color-blind, and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. If interested in a representative sample, recruit both male and female participants.\nNOTE: Women sometimes demonstrate a blunted cortisol response to psychological stress, particularly when in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle or when taking oral contraceptives15. Consider measuring/controlling for female use of contraceptives and menstrual cycle phase (this was not done in the present study).When scheduling, ensure that participants can attend both testing sessions, which are approximately 1 h each and occur one week apart.\nSchedule participants in groups of two to facilitate peer evaluation during stress induction.\nTo ensure that cortisol samples are not biased by the use of stimulants, ask participants to refrain from stimulant use (e.g., caffeine, nicotine) for 6 h prior to each experimental session. To avoid contamination of saliva samples. Also ask participants to refrain from eating or drinking (besides water) for 1 h prior to each session.\nRandomly assign participants to either learning group: study-practice or retrieval-practice.\nSchedule all participants during roughly the same time of day (e.g., all morning testing or all evening testing) to control for diurnal variability in cortisol16. Schedule each participant\u2019s two experimental sessions for the same time (one week apart).\n2. Construction of Stimuli and Memory Tests\nEncoding stimuli\nIn the interest of creating two dissociable learning events, create two distinct sets of materials for participants to encode.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol involved two 60-item wordlists, one of which was labelled \"The Red List\"\u00a0and was visually presented in red font, the other of which was labelled \"The Blue List\"\u00a0and was visually presented in blue font. The wordlists used in the present protocol are available in Supplementary File 1.For the purposes of stimulus neutrality, ensure that each word meets the following criteria: (1) non-proper noun, (2) not a homograph, (3) four to eight letters long, and (4) concreteness rating of at least 4 on a scale from 1-7 (7 = most concrete). Compare the words to valence and arousal norms17 to ensure that that they have valence ratings between 4.00 and 5.99 on a 1-9 scale (i.e., neutral valence) and arousal ratings lower than 4.00 on a 1-9 scale (i.e., not negatively arousing). Equate word frequencies across the lists by comparing them to an established word database18.\nUse stimulus-presentation software to program each of the wordlists such that words are individually and randomly presented at a rate of 2 s per word.\nNOTE: This protocol used E-Prime version 2.119 for stimulus presentation, but common software can be used to this effect. The E-Prime scripts used for stimulus presentation in the present experiment are available in Supplementary File 2.\nRetrieval stimuli\nTo create plausible foil items for the recognition memory test, create a third 60-item wordlist. Adhere to the criteria outlined in step 2.1.2. The list of foil words used in the present protocol is available in Supplementary File 1.\nMemory tests\nFor the purposes of assessing memory performance both pre- and post-stress, create two functionally-identical memory tests. Construct two 90-item tests.\nNOTE: The present study used recognition tests, in which participants are presented with studied items and foil items and must indicate whether each item occurred on the lists they studied.\nTests consist of 30 items from the red list, 30 items from the blue list, and 30 items from the foil list. Counterbalance or randomize which list items are presented on the two recognition tests. Also randomize the order in which the items are presented.NOTE: Each item is accompanied by a list-discrimination question and an assessment of confidence. The list-discrimination question asks participants to indicate whether the item came from the red list, the blue list, or neither list. The confidence question asks participants whether they experienced high or low confidence in their list-discrimination judgment.\n3. Stress-induction Protocol\nUse the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G)20 to induce mild, acute psychological stress.\nNOTE: The present protocol adapted the TSST-G to test participants in groups of two instead of four. Psychosocial stress induction of this nature, which involves giving a speech and solving math problems while being evaluated, is preferable to other methods of stress induction because of its ecological validity and ability to elicit a physiological stress response21,22.\nTo induce stress, do the following in this order:\nSpeech preparation\n\t\t\nHave participants sit at separate desks. Give both participants a sheet of blank paper and a pen or pencil. Read them the following instructions:\n\"You will now have two minutes to prepare a speech in which you are applying for a job as a Teaching Assistant* in any course of your choice. Please be prepared to discuss what skills and experiences you have that make you a qualified candidate for the job\"\nNOTE: *If working with non-student populations, change \"Teaching Assistant\"\u00a0to a population-relevant position.\nUse a stopwatch or clock to time the 2 min period. Set up a video camera on a tripod while participants are preparing their speeches. Take participants'\u00a0notes away when two minutes have passed.\nSpeech delivery\n\t\t\nRead participants the following instructions:\"You have each been assigned a number on your desk. I will now call on you by number to stand and give your speech. When I call on you, please stand in the center of the room where you can be seen by the camera. You will be video recorded for the purpose of coding your non-verbal behavior at a later time.\"\nCall on participants one at a time to stand up and deliver their speeches. Use a stopwatch or clock to ensure that each speech lasts for 2 min. If a participant finishes the speech early, tell them that they still have time left and they must continue.\nOral subtraction\n\t\t\nRead participants the following instructions:\n\"I will now call on you at random to solve simple math subtraction problems. When I call on you, please stand and solve the problem aloud. If you get the problem wrong, I will ask you to try again until you get it correct. As a reminder, you will be videotaped during this part of the experiment. Person X, please stand and subtract...\"\n\t\t\tNOTE: Math problems involve subtracting a number in the teens (e.g., 13, 14, 15) from a 4-digit number (e.g., 4,563).\nCall on participants randomly and unpredictably (e.g., sometimes 2-3 times in a row) to solve math problems for 6 min. That is, participants solve math problems multiple times each for a period of 6 min. When participants give an incorrect answer, tell them they are incorrect and ask them to try again. Repeat the question if necessary.\n4. Saliva Sample Collection and Supplies\nNOTE: Saliva collection is only necessary during experimental session 2, in which stress is inducedEnsure that participants have adhered to the instructions outlined in step 1.5. If any of these criteria have been violated, make note of this and examine the participant's data as a potential outlier before conducting any statistical analyses.\nWhen participants first arrive for this session, have them rinse their mouth with water to clear it of any sample contaminants.\nFor the collection of saliva samples, use the passive drool method in which participants pass saliva through a straw into a collection tube. For sample collection, use smoothie-sized straws, cut into 2 inch pieces, and 2 mL cryovials. Ensure that all cryovials are labelled with necessary identifying information (e.g., participant number, sample number, date).\nFor each sample, have the participant place the 2 inch straw in the cryovial and drool into the straw until they have provided 2 mL of saliva. When they have finished providing a sample, have them discard the straw in a wastebasket and screw the cap on the cryovial. Offer participants gloves and sanitizing wipes before they provide each saliva sample.\nCollect three saliva samples: (1) a baseline sample after participants arrive for session 2, (2) a sample immediately after stress induction is complete (~12 min after the onset of stress), and (3) a sample 25-30 min after the onset of stress induction, when cortisol reaches its peak post-stress levels in saliva12.\nStore the saliva samples in a freezer (0 \u00b0F) until analyzed.\n5. Subjective Stress Measure\nChoose a measurement of self-reported state anxiety/stress to administer at various times during the experiment.NOTE: The present protocol used the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA)23. The STICSA is a state measure of the cognitive and somatic sensations associated with anxiety. Statements are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale, and responses are added for a total score that ranges from 0-80 (higher scores are indicative of greater anxiety).\nBefore administering each iteration of the STICSA, inform participants that it is a measure of anxiety and they should respond based on how they are feeling in the moment.\n6. Encoding Procedure (Experimental Session 1)\nInstruct participants to read the informed consent form and, if they choose to participate, sign and return it to the experimenter.\nInstruct participants that that they will be presented with a series of words that they must try to remember for a later test.\nPresent participants with either the Red List or the Blue List using the stimulus-presentation software and rate of presentation outlined in section 2.1.\nThe next step depends on group assignment.\nFor participants in the study-practice group, present the same list two more times at the same rate of presentation. To clear working memory between each study event, have participants complete simple math problems for 30 s (e.g., 12 x 4). Either have participants complete this task with pencil and paper or embed the task into the computer program used for stimulus presentation.\nNOTE: The scripts included in Supplementary File 2 have all encoding tasks embedded within them.For participants in the retrieval-practice group, give them two time-matched (i.e., 2 min) free-recall tests. Prior to the two tests, instruct participants that they should recall as many words as possible from the preceding list, in any order. During free recall, either have participants type their responses using the stimulus-presentation software program or have them write their responses on a sheet of paper. To clear working memory, have participants complete simple math problems between initial presentation of the wordlist and the first test, as well as between the two free-recall tests (see step 6.4.1).\nPresent participants with a 30 min clip from an emotionally-neutral movie or television show.\nNOTE: The present protocol used the BBC television series Planet Earth. This 30 min delay helps establish a temporal distinction between learning the Red List and learning the Blue List.\nRepeat steps 6.3 and 6.4 for the list that was not presented prior to the 30 min break.\nNOTE: Steps 6.3 through 6.6 are depicted in Figure 1.\nHave participants complete a first iteration of the STICSA to determine whether study practice and retrieval practice differentially influenced anxiety levels.\n7. Retrieval Procedure (Experimental Session 2)\nFollow steps 1.5 and 4.2 to ensure proper saliva sample collection.\nInstruct participants to fill out a second STICSA as a pre-stress measure of subjective anxiety.\nInstruct participants to provide the first saliva sample.\nAdminister one of the two tests constructed in section 2.3.\nNOTE: The tests are depicted in Figure 2.\nComplete the stress-induction procedure as specified in section 3.2.\nInstruct participants to complete the third STICSA as a post-stress measure of subjective anxiety.\nInstruct participants to provide the second saliva sample.\nGive participants a 10 min break. In the present protocol, participants watched part of an episode of The Office during this break.Instruct participants to provide the third saliva sample.\nAdminister the second test constructed in section 2.3 (depicted in Figure 2).\nDebrief participants about the purpose of the experiment and excuse them.\n8. Computing Dependent Measures\nAfter the conclusion of data collection, compute the dependent measures as follows:\nCalculate hit proportions. For each participant, divide the number of studied items that participants correctly recognized by the total number of studied items that were presented on the recognition test.\nCalculate false-alarm proportions. For each participant, divide the number of non-presented foil words that participants falsely recognized by the total number of foils that were presented on the recognition test.\nCalculate source-memory scores. For each participant, divide the total number of hits that participants attributed to the correct source by their total number of hits.\nFor average confidence, code the high- and low-confidence judgments as binary, with 1 representing high confidence and 0 representing low confidence. For each participant, calculate their proportion of high-confidence judgments.\nCalculate gamma correlations.

Participants perform a primary visual detection task followed by a secondary confidence task. For the visual detection task, present only two types of stimuli: catch stimuli (i.e., one empty checkerboard per hemifield) and target stimuli (i.e., one checkerboard containing the gray circles\u2019 contrast value corresponding to the individual perceptual threshold per hemifield). Akin to the titration task, participants press the spacebar whenever they perceive the target stimulus and withhold the response whenever no target stimulus is perceived (i.e., when catch stimuli are presented). In addition, following their primary response, they provide a confidence rating on a Likert scale with 4 levels of confidence regarding their percept.\nOpen the task in E-prime and enter in the list of stimuli to present during task execution, the two values identified as threshold values for the left and right hemifields target stimulus.\nExplain instructions:\nExplain the primary visual detection task;\nExplain that after stimulus presentation the participant will be asked how confident they are about their perception with a value from 1 to 4, ranging from low confidence to high confidence, pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard;Before starting the task, instruct the participant to place the right hand in a comfortable position to promptly press the spacebar and the left hand in correspondence to the four numbers necessary to provide the confidence rating;\nAgain, ask the participant to maintain the gaze on the fixation cross while reducing the brightness of the room.\nEEG recording:\nCheck the quality of the signal;\nInstruct the participant about the possible artifacts that can affect the signal and suggest tips that may help maintain artifacts to a minimum throughout the recording;\nReiterate your request to the participant to stay as relaxed as possible while recording their EEG signal;\nStart the recording.\nRun the E-prime script to launch the stimulus presentation and data collection during the visual detection task.\nOnce started, double-check that your set up is up and running by checking for the effective presence of triggers on the ongoing EEG recording.\nNote: Start the EEG recording at least ten seconds before the start of the task and end at least ten seconds after the end of the behavioral task, to allow for the subsequent application of filters during the signal processing.\nCorrelational approach (experiment 1): Resting state\nTiming: 2\u00a0min\nAfter the end of the task, record a eyes-closed 2\u00a0min resting-state EEG.\nCorrelational approach (experiment 1): Computing task performance\nTiming: 1\u00a0h for each participantThis step enables the estimation of behavioral performance in the visual detection task and in the confidence task. Specifically, calculate accuracy rate (i.e., the percentage of correct responses) and perceptual sensitivity, (i.e., the d\u2019 sensitivity index). The latter considers both correct responses and false alarms, discounting any potential effect of response bias (Green and Swets, 1966[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Moreover, estimate both confidence rate (i.e., the mean of confidence reports) and metacognitive performance of each participant (i.e., the meta d\u2019 measure (Maniscalco and Lau, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib48]). Meta d' quantifies the accuracy of confidence ratings to discriminate objectively correct from erroneous responses.\nBehavioral analyses:\nAccuracy rate:\nSort trials in correct and errors trials. Correct trials consist of correctly detected target trials (i.e., hits) and correctly detected catch trials (i.e., correct rejections).

In this way, all contralateral activity is on one side, which is conventionally defined to be the right;\nSort EEG epochs accordingly to the behavioral condition (i.e., correct vs error trials; high vs low confidence trials).\nCritical: Apply the described procedure to all EEG data using the same parameters.\nEEG analysis:\nCalculate pre-stimulus IAF.

The relation between pre-stimulus alpha activity and perception was already reported in previous studies (Samaha et\u00a0al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]; Samaha and Postle, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]). In particular, alpha-amplitude suppression can predict higher level of subjective confidence in response to visual stimuli (Benwell et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Iemi et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Samaha et\u00a0al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]) while faster alpha-frequency was related to better objective perceptual accuracy (Samaha and Postle, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]). In this sense, we expected, in the between participants analyses, that alpha-amplitude suppression accounted for better individual metacognitive performance and faster alpha-frequency accounted for better objective accuracy. Accordingly, we used one-tailed t-test for these analyses.\nCritical: Electrode selection requires visual inspection of the power-spectrum of all parieto-occipital electrodes. A double-blind check is necessary.\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Titration session\nTiming: 45\u00a0min\nRun a titration session before the main experimental session in order to set stimuli contrast ratios corresponding to each individual\u2019s 50% perceptual threshold. Procedure should be the same as in Experiment 1.\nRun a titration session.\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Subject preparation for EEG setup\nTiming: 30\u201345\u00a0min\nThis section describes EEG montage. Careful and homogenous EEG setup across participants is especially important in this protocol due to online application of rhythmic TMS. In order to minimize the impact of TMS-induced artifact on the EEG signal, here-described steps have to be carefully followed in order to reduce the duration of the artifact and its trial-by trial variability.\nCap placement: The electrode positions are used as landmarks to localize the stimulation site, thus particular care should be taken when centering the EEG cap:Center the cap at the sagittal plane by using the distance between the inion (the bony protrusion at the back of the skull) and nasion (the bony ridge between the eyebrows);\nCenter the cap at the coronal plane by using the distance between the earlobes.\nReducing electrode impedance:\nSkin preparation: clean the skin at the electrode-skin contact by scrubbing with alcohol and a cotton swab;\nApply and distribute electrode gel by a cotton swab until desired impedance is reached for all of the electrodes (ground, reference and EOG electrodes:\u00a0<\u00a05 k\u03a9; remaining electrodes:\u00a0<\u00a010 k\u03a9).\nCritical: Regularly check and adjust electrode impedance during the whole experiment.\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Resting-state EEG recording and IAF estimation\nTiming: 10\u00a0min\nThis section describes the EEG resting-state recording. For the Experiment 2 and 3, resting-state EEG should be recorded and analyzed at once in order to titrate stimulation parameters for every participant. This step is necessary to determine the exact time lag between the pulses in a 5-pulse train, in order to selectively and efficiently change the speed or amplitude of alpha oscillatory activity of the participant.\nResting state eyes-closed recording for 3\u00a0min: Have participants comfortably seated in a dimmed-lit room with their eyes closed while recording their EEG activity.\nResting state eyes-open recording for 3\u00a0min: Have participants comfortably seated in a dimmed-lit room with gaze on a fixation cross on a screen while recording their EEG activity.\nNote: Order of eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state recordings should be randomized between subjects.\nPause point: Participants could take a break after finishing the resting-state session.\nEstimation of individual alpha frequency peak from eyes-open resting state:\nPre-processing of the signal:\nRe-referencing to average;\nRe-sampling to 500\u00a0Hz;\nApplying a low-pass (0.5\u00a0Hz) and high-pass (50\u00a0Hz) filter.Estimating IAF:\nIn line with Experiment 1 (showing a local alpha power maxima over O2) and previous studies, calculate alpha-frequency from the O2 electrode, over which rhythmic-TMS is subsequently applied;\nApply fast Fourier transformation (FFT), and calculate power spectra. IAF is defined as the local maximum power within the alpha frequency range (7\u201313\u00a0Hz);\nDouble-check the peak visually.\nNote: If the clear peak in the alpha range is not visible during eyes-open resting-state on the O2 electrode, consider adjacent electrodes (PO8 and PO4).\nNote: If the clear peak in the alpha range is not visible during eyes-open resting-state on posterior electrodes, consider using eyes-closed resting-state for estimating IAF.\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Conducting main experimental task\nTiming: 50\u00a0min\nThis section describes the main experimental procedure for Experiment 2 and 3. Please note that stimuli and tasks in Experiment 2 and 3 are the same as those described for Experiment 1, with the main difference being the active manipulation of alpha activity via the TMS entrainment protocol. Specifically, in Experiment 2, a five-pulses TMS train is delivered over the right occipital cortex (O2) right before stimulus presentation (where the last TMS pulse coincided with onset of the stimulus appearance), and rhythmic-TMS pulse trains could occur at three different frequencies: at the individual alpha-frequency of the participant to manipulate pre-stimulus alpha-amplitude (IAF group); at 1\u00a0Hz lower than the individual alpha-frequency (IAF-1\u00a0Hz group) to slow-down pre-stimulus alpha-frequency; or at 1\u00a0Hz higher than the individual alpha-frequency (IAF+1\u00a0Hz group) to speed-up pre-stimulus alpha-frequency. On the other hand, Experiment 3 aimed to selectively enhance post-stimulus alpha-amplitude, prior to the confidence prompt. As such, only one entrainment protocol is applied (i.e., stimulation at the individual alpha-frequency), with the final rhythmic-TMS pulse coinciding with the onset of the confidence prompt.TMS setup:\nApply biphasic stimulation using a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator via a 70\u00a0mm figure-of-eight coil (we used TMS Rapid, Magstim Company, UK) of maximum field strength \u223c1.55T.\nRandomizing conditions:\nFor Experiment 2: Randomize participants group: IAF-1, IAF and IAF+1 stimulation;\nFor Experiment 2 and 3: Randomize order of ACTIVE vs SHAM stimulation blocks.\nSetting up inter-pulse interval in the 5-pulse train (see Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]): Use the IAF information previously obtained during the resting state:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1698-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Entrainment protocols and outcomes: Pre-stimulus alpha activity was fine-tuned relative to individual alpha-frequency using rhythmic five-pulse TMS bursts in which the time lag between pulses was manipulated depending on the group\nTo induce changes in the alpha-frequency cycle length, rhythmic-TMS was applied at a slower (in blue) or faster pace (in green), relative to a participant\u2019s individual alpha-frequency. To selectively modulate alpha-amplitude, the frequency of the rhythmic-TMS pulse trains was matched to the intrinsic individual alpha-frequency of the participant, thus enhancing the synchronization of neural firing and phase alignment without influencing the speed of alpha activity (in red). In this way, rhythmic-TMS pulse trains could occur at three different frequencies: at the individual alpha-frequency of the participant to manipulate pre-stimulus alpha-amplitude (IAF group, in red); at 1\u00a0Hz lower than the individual alpha-frequency (IAF-1\u00a0Hz group, in blue) to slow-down pre-stimulus alpha-frequency; or at 1\u00a0Hz higher than the individual alpha-frequency (IAF+1\u00a0Hz group, in green) to speed-up pre-stimulus alpha-frequency.\nIAF \u2013 1\u00a0Hz group: the inter-pulse interval (in ms) is calculated using the following formula: IPI\u00a0= 1000/ (IAF -1);\nIAF group: the inter-pulse interval (in ms) is calculated using the following formula: IPI\u00a0= 1000/ (IAF);\nIAF\u00a0+ 1\u00a0Hz group: the inter-pulse interval (in ms) is calculated using the following formula: IPI\u00a0= 1000/ (IAF\u00a0+ 1).Setting up TMS intensity: 60% of the MSO;\nOptional: Instead of using fixed TMS intensity, you could also titrate the TMS intensity by using phosphene threshold of the participant.\nPlacing the coil:\nPlace the coil over the O2 electrode of the EEG cap (right occipital site), with the coil surface being tangential to the scalp;\nOptional: You could use neuro-navigation (instead of EEG landmarks) to locate the area of interest (right occipital V1 area).\nNote: As systematic differences in visual cortex excitability have not been detected, comparable stimulation effects would be expected after left hemisphere (O1 electrode) entrainment.\nOrient the coil perpendicular to the medial plane of the subjects\u2019 head (latero-medial current direction, see Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1698-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03.

Specifically, you can look at accuracy, confidence, and metacognition of each participant separately for the two hemifields (stimuli appearing on the left and on the right), and for the two types of within-subject stimulation protocols (ACTIVE vs. SHAM stimulation).\nBehavioral data within participant:\nCalculating perceptual sensitivity (d\u2019 score);\nCalculating confidence mean;\nEstimate metacognitive performance (meta d\u2019 score).\nStatistical analysis across participants:\nExperiment 2:\nCompare all scores between the two HEMIFIELDs (left and right) and two STIMULATION types (active rhythmic-TMS and sham) in three GROUPs of participants (IAF\u00b11\u00a0Hz, IAF), in 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 repeated measures mixed-model ANOVAs;\nTest differences between conditions by two-tailed t-test (planned comparisons).\nExperiment 3:\nCompare all scores for the two HEMIFIELDS (left and right) and between different STIMULATION types (active rhythmic-TMS and sham) in a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 repeated measures ANOVA;\nTest differences between conditions by two-tailed t-test (planned comparisons).\nCausal approach (experiment 2 & 3): Electrophysiological processing and analysis\nTiming: 2\u00a0monthsThis step enables looking at electrophysiological effects of different stimulation protocols. Specifically, look at IAF and alpha amplitude of each participant separately for the two hemispheres (right and left hemisphere), and for the two types of within-subject stimulation protocols (ACTIVE vs. SHAM stimulation). This allows to verify whether the rhythmic TMS has the intended effects on brain rhythms (amplitude enhancement, speeding frequency up or down) and hence to verify that it is the TMS-induced changes in brain rhythms mediating the behavioral effects.\nEEG preprocessing steps: Removing TMS artifacts (see Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1698-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04.

Preparation of medium**\n1.1 To prepare 1 L of Steinberg medium, the necessary reagents and respective quantities are outlined in **Table 1**. Stock solutions are added to 938 mL of distilled water.\n1.2 Chemicals must be reagent-grade. The medium is stirred until all the contents are dissolved. **CAUTION** The pH of liquid media should be adjusted to 6.9 \u00b1 0.1with either HCl or NaOH at strengths \u2264 1 M after adding distilled water to each stock solution.\n**2. Preparation of toxicant solution and test dilutions**\n2.1 Test dilutions\nTest dilutions can be prepared in volumetric flasks and then distributed to the replicate test vessels. Test vessels are left at room temperature for 1 hour to allow equilibrium of the medium and toxicant.\n2.2 Selection of test concentrations\nSet the concentration of the test substances using half dilution of the medium and the toxicity test solution. In cases of uncertainty about sample toxicity, it is beneficial to run a range-finding test for choosing concentrations of definitive test. A wide range of concentrations \\(e.g., \u2265 an order of magnitude) should assist in selection of the concentrations for the definitive test.\nIn case the test solution is an effluent or liquid material, set the concentration to 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, and 100%. The concentration should be selected so that different levels \\(4-5 sections) of growth can occur in the range of less than 10% to over 90%. It is best to choose the range of concentrations through preliminary experiments, which includes broad range of concentrations.\n2.3 Control\nAll experiments require a negative control with the identical culture medium, test conditions and procedures, but exclude the test substance.\n**3.

This is demonstrated on the ML in \u201c.txt\u201d format obtained from the Nikon NSTORM microscope. Nikon NSTORM outputs a \u201c.txt\u201d localization data file containing coordinates (x, y, z) for each localized molecule, along with other attributes used in the later steps, notably the localization precision (LP), the number of photons (PN), and frame index at which given molecule was detected. In this step Grafeo converts the data to Matlab \".mat\" data file format that contains single-molecule features used for the subsequent data analysis and visualization. Next, we show how to combine individual channel \".mat\" files to reconstruct a multicolor data file.\nCritical: Step 1\nImporting the molecular list to Grafeo.\nIn the main Grafeo menu bar press \u201cFile\u201d -> \u201c3D\u201d or \u201c2D\u201d -> \u201csingle file\u201d or \u201cbatch\u201d -> \u201cImport single Nikon txt molecular list\u201d, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig2.jpg\nFigure\u00a02. Data importation and filtering\n(A) Importing a single file (A(i)) or multiple files in a batch processing mode (A(ii)).(B) The data importation input parameters. From the top to bottom: (1) the total number of columns in a molecular list file, (2\u20133) the column numbers for the X (2) and Y (3) coordinate, (4) photon count, (5) localization precision, (6) frame index at which the molecule was detected, (7) column index with the channel tag (in the Nikon NIS elements software, the name for each channel can be set, e.g., 488, then the same name will be used in the molecular list file), (8) trace length (the number of subsequent image frames the single molecule appeared), (9) Z coordinate column, (10) a flag for the molecules for which Z position fit failed (in the Nikon file it is \u2018Z Rejected\u2019, and this tag replaces the channel tag), (11) a binary tag specifying whether to import all the data (set to 0) or only the molecules with a successful Z position fit (set to 1), (12) the two element vector specifying the minimum number of photons and the maximum localization precision (the molecules with fewer number of photons or greater localization precision will be discarded from the subsequent analyses), (13) the number of header lines preceding the column data, and finally (14) the file space delimiter (for Tab use \u2018\u2216t\u2019).\n(C) Once the data is imported to the Matlab format, it can be loaded to the Grafeo memory. C(i) Chanel selection dropdown menu, C(ii) \u201cRe-threshold\u201d push button applies a new filtering parameters, \u201cSave ML\u201d saves the updated molecular list file.(D) Data filtering panel using a minimum photon number (PN), a maximum localization precision (LP), and a minimum Voronoi diagram density (VD). The last four rows correspond to a minimum, maximum, mean, and median of the Voronoi diagram density for each channel and are populated automatically whenever the filtering parameters are changed or a new file is loaded.\nA pop-up window will be displayed where you should provide input parameters, such as a column index for the listed ML parameters (e.g., LP and PN), and the minimum PN and the LP, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nNote: Once the data import and processing are finished, the output \u201c.mat\u201d file is automatically saved; its name is suffixed with \u201c_Xwc_Ywc_pn_f_lp_Zc_l_zr.mat\u201d that indicates variables stored in the file: y, x coordinates after wrap (w) transformation and chromatic corrections (c), photon number (pn), frame index (f), z coordinate after chromatic shift correction (Zc), trace length, that is the number of successive frames the molecule has appeared (l), and Z rejected binary tag (zr). See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].Note: You can upload all \u201c.txt\u201d files in a given folder at once, including first-level subfolders, by choosing the \u201cbatch processing\u201d option, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A(i). After the data is uploaded to Matlab, the corresponding Voronoi Diagram is calculated to link each localized molecule to a Voronoi polygon (VP). The local molecule density is estimated as an inverse of VP size and can be used to efficiently filter the data (see step 3). The zr value is 1 if the Z coordinate fit (refer to Nikon manual) was successful given the calibration and the constraints on fit parameters. Usually, molecules with zr\u00a0= 0 have a fixed value (e.g., -400 for each of them) and should be rejected from further analysis. However, for a too strict parameter selection or incorrect calibration, a molecule may be tagged 0, while the Z position is appropriate. This could result in suppressing too many valid points.\nCritical: Step 2\nCombining multicolor molecular list. This step shows how to combine single-channel \u201c.mat\u201d files generated in the step 1 into two/three-channel multicolor \u201c.mat\u201d files.\nIn the channel dropdown menu, select the option \u201cChanel 1\u201d, then press the \u201cLoad raw\u201d pushbutton below, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(i). You will be prompted to select a first (that you chose to be your channel 1, here A647 prefixed file) \u201c.mat\u201d file that was generated in the step 1.\nRepeat the same steps by selecting the \"Chanel 2/3\u201d option in the selection box and loading channel 2 and 3 \u201c.mat\u201d files (CF568 and A488).Once all three single-channel files are loaded to the Grafeo memory, select \u201cChanel 1+2+3\u201d in the dropdown menu and then press \u201cSave ML\u201d to save a combined multicolor molecular list to a file with the desired name (here Corralign_647_568_488_2.mat), Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(ii). The single-channel files can be loaded in any order; here, we follow the acquisition sequence (i.e., 647, 568, 488).\nNote: At this step no data filtering is applied, and filtering parameters (see step 3) that are saved to the file correspond to those chosen in the step 1 (PN, LP), and the minimum VD. Optionally, save a file only after the step 3 that is once the data is appropriately filtered. When using \u201cLoad raw\u201d pushbutton, the data is added to the previous plot. If you want to clear the main axes, check the \u201cClear axes\u201d checkbox located above the main axes in the right corner. Uncheck it once you load the first data file.\nSingle-molecule data filtering with Voronoi tessellation, photon counts, and localization precision. In this step, we show how to filter the data by adjusting localization precision LP, photon number PN, and the Voronoi diagram density (VD, an inverse of VP size) in a \u201cVoronoi Tesselation Panel\u201d, Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D. The lower the LP, the more precisely single-molecule is localized. By decreasing LP and increasing PN and VD, more molecules are filtered out. A large VPs (small VD) usually corresponds to a noise. For the 3D dSTORM data filtering, start with the VD \u223c10\u22128 (default), increase (decrease) the threshold to discard (include) more molecules. A good starting value for PN is \u223c1000\u20131500, and for LP is \u223c25\u201350\u00a0nm. Once the parameters are set up, press \u201cre-threshold\u201d to filter the data, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(iii). Save the filtered data using the \u201cSave ML\u201d pushbutton, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C(ii).Note: The LP and PN values displayed in the \u201cVoronoi Tessellation panel\u201d are automatically changed whenever a new multicolor file is loaded (\u201cLoad multicolor\u201d pushbutton). The LP and PN correspond to the minimum PN and the maximum LP found in the data after any filtering step, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D.\nMulticolor channel registration. In this step, we show how to perform the automatic channel alignment.\nBefore the alignment, it is recommended to apply a stringent threshold for the filtering parameters in the \u201cVoronoi tessellation panel\u201d (see step 3). The exact values depend on the experiment; we recommend a minimum photon number PN > 3000, maximum localization precision LP\u00a0< 20\u00a0nm, and the Voronoi density VD > 10\u22127.\nAfter filtering, save the file using \u201cSave ML\u201d pushbuttons with the appropriate name, e.g., \u201cCorralign_647_568_488_2_filtered.mat\u201d. You will need to load this file in the following steps.\nTo perform automatic alignment of the three-channel data, select \u201c2\u20133 color Voronoi\u201d -> 3D/2D -> \u201cSingle file\u201d -> \u201cAlign three channels\u201d in the main Grafeo menu bar, Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A. The pop-up window will appear where you have to provide the input parameters: a prefix of a filtered file name that you will be asked to select (here \u201cCorralign_\u201d), and the replacement prefix for the output file (here \u201cRealigned_\u201d), Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B. You should also specify whether to exclude \u201cZ-rejected\u201d points from the alignment analysis (recommended) for each channel separately (1 \u2013 do not use \u201cZ rejected\u201d). Press \u201cok\u201d.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig3.jpg\nFigure\u00a03. Automatic multicolor data alignment\n(A) Selecting the option to align the three-channel data.(B) The input parameter window for the data alignment, from top to bottom: (1) a prefix (or the first few letters) of the file that will be loaded and used for the alignment, (2) A prefix for the output file containing the results of alignment. The prefix from (2) will replace prefix from (1), and the remaining file name will be the same.\n(C) The optimality plot displaying the alignment optimization steps.\n(D) The Grafeo panel permitting setting up the optimization parameters.\n(E) The Grafeo manual alignment panel. It also permits loading the alignment results ('Load aligned' pushbutton) and applying it to the currently opened data ('Apply aligned' pushbutton).\nNext, you will be prompted to select the file that you want to align (here \u201cCorralign_647_568_488_2_filtered.mat\u201d). The automatic alignment will start.\nThe optimization progress is displayed both in the Matlab \u201cCommand Window\u201d and as the first order optimality plot. The alignment procedure for a three-color dSTORM data consists of two steps: first, channel 1 is aligned to channel 2; in the second step, channel 3 is aligned to channel 2. For each step, a separate optimality plot will appear. The fit parameters can be adjusted in the \u201cFit Parameters\u201d panel, Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D (see also Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). For better optimization results, it is recommended to use stringent values for TolFun, TolX, StepTol, i.e., a minimum of \u223c10\u221210. At the end of each optimization step, a message box will appear confirming the termination of the alignment procedure. The output aligned file is automatically saved (using a chosen prefix name, here \u201cRealigned_\u201d).Note: The alignment algorithm uses Matlab build-in function fminunc and minimizes the distance between two sets of points (channel 1 to channel 2, and then channel 3 to channel 2). To learn more, please refer to Matlab documentation on fminunc and the optimization parameters (optimset, TolX, StepTol, FunTol). The alignment can also be done on the fiducial markers or the subpart of the data (see the last parameter in Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), which substantially speeds up the alignment process. For this, either plot ROI (Region of Interest) around a fiducial marker (see next section to learn how to draw ROI in the main Grafeo axes), or filter the data by setting very stringent parameters, e.g., VD \u223c0.01, so that almost all the data except the fiducial markers are filtered out. Use the \"Poly roi draw\u201d pushbutton in the \"Create ROI\u201d panel (see below) to plot a polygonal ROI that would include mostly the fiducial markers or relevant data. In the current Grafeo version, only the latest drawn ROI is used. Thus, draw the ROI that contains several fiducial markers but avoiding the remaining data as much as possible. Future Grafeo releases should include multi ROI alignment. You can also place one rectangular ROI around one fiducial marker, but the fit will not consider the spatial inhomogeneity due to the optical aberrations. The alignment performed on an unfiltered data set can be lengthy. We recommend using ROI either around fiducials or around a subpart of the data. The ROI option is not available for the alignment in the batch mode.\nApply alignment results to the currently opened data file. At the end of step 4, the alignment results are saved automatically in a file with a prefix specified by the user (see above). This file contains a highly filtered data (\u201cRealigned_647_568_488_2_filtered.mat\u201d).Before applying the alignment to the currently loaded dataset, first adjust the filtering parameters, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D.\nTo load and apply the alignment on the currently open file in Grafeo, go to the \u201cManual alignment panel\u201d, press \u201cLoad align\" and selected the file with the results of alignment, and then press \u201cApply align\u201d Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E. To refresh the plot, press \u201cScatter\u201d in the panel above the main Grafeo axes.\nManual alignment. If the automatic alignment results are not satisfactory (or if you do not have Matlab optimization toolbox), you can perform the manual alignment. In the \u201cManual alignment\u201d panel, select the step size (in nm), Figure\u00a03[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E. As in the automatic alignment, during the manual alignment, channel 2 stays unchanged. You can align channel 1 to channel 2 (column 1), and channel 3 to channel 2 (column 2), by pressing \u201cStep UP\u201d, \u201cStep DOWN\u201d, \u201cStep LEFT\u201d, \u201cStep RIGHT\u201d, \u201cZ up\u201d, \u201cZ down\u201d. Use the press button \u201cToggle Zoom\u201d in the panel above the main axes to zoom on the data and evaluate XY's alignment. For the manual alignment in the Z dimension, you have first to draw a ROI (see below). When you press \"Z up\" or \"Z down\", a 3D scatter plot will appear, displaying the data in ROI.\nData visualization\nTiming: variable, \u223cseveral minutes\nThis section describes how to draw different regions of interest and how to generate 2D/3D still and animated scatter plots using the data from the small ROI.Drawing polygonal ROI. To draw a polygonal ROI, press \u201cPoly ROI draw\u201d in the \"Create ROI\u201d panel, Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A. You will be prompted to select one of two options: polygonal ROI (0) or freehand ROI (1), Figure\u00a04[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B. Double click to draw the last vertex. For more details on how to draw polygonal and freehand ROI, consult Matlab documentation pages for the Matlab build-in functions \u201cdrawfreehand\u201d and \u201cdrawpolygon\u201d. Only the latest drawn ROI is active. You can load a previously saved polygonal using \u201cLoad ROI\u201d. To display the loaded ROI press \u201cDisp. Poly roi\u201d.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig4.jpg\nFigure\u00a04. Creating the region of interest (ROIs)\n(A) ROI panel permitting (1) to create ('Poly roi create' pushbutton), save ('Save ROI\u2032 pushbutton), load ('Load roi' pushbutton), and display ('Disp.

For more details on the ROIs, see Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and the text.\n(B) This window appears when you press \u2018Poly roi draw\u2019 and permits selecting between a freehand ROI and polygonal ROI (see text for more information).\nNote: \u201cPoly ROI draw\u201d uses \u201cdrawpolygon\u201d and \u201cdrawfreehand\u201d that replaced the former Matlab functions (polygonal ROI, freehand ROI) and require at least Matlab 2019a version. If you have a previous Matlab version, use a rectangular ROI only.\nDrawing a rectangular ROI. To draw rectangular ROI press \u201crect. ROI\u201d located in the \u201cCreate ROI\u201d panel. To adjust the initial rectangular ROI size and position, change the edit box parameters located next to the \"rect. roi\u201d button ([left position, bottom position, width, height]). Rectangular ROI is resizable and draggable.Drawing a twin polygonal ROI. Twin polygonal ROI is composed of the two mirror-image polygonal ROIs. It permits analyzing the number of points in the two adjacent polygonal ROI, e.g., on the two sides of a cell wall or cell membrane.\nFirst, zoom in to the plot area where you want to draw a ROI using \u201ctoggle zoom\u201d pushbutton.\nTo plot twin polygonal ROI, press \"Twin poly roi\" and draw a line separating two regions. Double click to finish drawing a line. Mind the direction of the line drawing; it will define which ROI is tagged as the first. You can plot several twin poly roi. Each time you finish drawing a line, you will be asked if you want to draw a new line (press \"Yes\" to draw another line) or finish drawing the ROIs (press \"No\").\nTo visualize the drawn ROIs, press \"Plot twin poly roi\". To remove drawn ROIs, provide the ROI number (fill the edit box) and press \"Delete twin poly roi\". To check if a correct ROI was removed, refresh the main axes by pressing the \"Scatter\" pushbutton, and then press \"Plot twin poly roi\u201d. Each time the twin polygonal ROI is displayed, the number of points in the two rectangular ROIs is calculated for each twin polygonal ROI. The width of the rectangular ROI can be adjusted (without need to draw a new roi) using the edit box next to the \"Plot twin poly roi\" push button (the number is provided in nanometers).\nTo save a twin polygonal ROI and the analyzed data, press \"Save twin poly roi\". You can load a previously saved twin polygonal ROI using \u201cLoad twin poly roi\u201d.Visualizing the data in the polygonal and rectangular ROI. To visualize the data in the polygonal or rectangular ROI using a scatter plot press the \"3d scatter\u201d pushbutton in the \u201cROI plot\u201d panel Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A(i). For the 3D data, you can rotate the plot manually or change the view by taping view(az, el) in the Matlab command window, where az is an azimuth angle (0<az<180) and el is elevation angle (0<el<360).\nGenerating 3D animated scatter plot. To animate your scatter plot, press \u201c3D animate\u201c in the \u201cROI plot\u201d panel, Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A(ii). You will be prompted to provide several input parameters, including initial and final azimuth and elevation angles, the number of rotation steps, and the output file format (\u201c.gif\u201d or \u201c.avi\u201d are recommended), Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B.Adjusting figure properties. To limit the data Z-axis range display, check the \u201cZ filter box\u201d checkbox and populate the \u201cZ range\u201d edit box that is located at the top of the \u201cPlot ROI\u201d panel, e.g., [\u2212450,450], Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A(iii). You can adjust the marker color by changing the edit boxes located above the main Grafeo axes (Color 1, Color 2, Color 3). Use the numbers between 0 and 255 for the red, blue, green (RGB), e.g., for green color type [0, 255, 0]/255, Figure\u00a02[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C. Additionally, you can use a colormap to represent the position of a fluorophore along the Z-axis. For this, in the \u201cROI plot\u201d panel, first select the channel you want to map by typing 1, 2, or 3 in the \u201cZ map channel\u201d edit box ( set to 0 for no mapping), and chose a predefined color map from a dropdown menu, or select \u201ccustom\u201d, to create your color map, Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A(iv). You can also adjust the different figure display parameters: figure and axes background color (the default is white [255,255,255]/255), the axes color (the default is black [0,0,0]/255), marker size and transparency for each channel, line width (for Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay graphs plot), face transparency (for Voronoi diagram plots), and font size, Figure\u00a05[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A(v).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig5.jpg\nFigure\u00a05.

These functions are commonly used to analyses spatial point patterns, such as 2D or 3D dSTORM datasets, composed of the point types (colors) and their coordinates (Sengupta et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Veatch et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Sengupta, Jovanovic-Talisman and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Shivanandan et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Shivanandan, Unnikrishnan and Radenovic, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Nicovich, Owen and Gaus, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Peters et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10], Peters et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). For the three-color data set, these functions are computed pairwise.\nRipley/PCF cluster analyses and colocalization.\nFirst, draw a polygonal ROI as described in the \u201cdata visualization[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] section\u201d. The ROI should be a convex polygon. To test your ROI, press the \u201cTest roi\u201d pushbutton, Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A. If the blue points lie outside the red polygon, then the polygon is not convex (compare Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, a\u00a0concave polygon, randomized data fall outside of the ROI) with Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D (a convex polygon,\u00a0the randomized data fall inside the ROI). The polygonal ROI can be adjusted by dragging and repositioning its vertices. This can be applied only to the latest drawn polygonal ROI.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig6.jpg\nFigure\u00a06.

You will be prompted to provide several input parameters, as described in Figure\u00a06[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B.When the operation is finished, you will be prompted to save the data to a file. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: Ripley\u2019s analysis can be lengthy for a large dataset and many randomization steps. To reduce the computation time, you can: (1) select a small ROI that contain only the meaningful data (i.e., the data you want to analyze), (2) filter the data by adjusting photon counts (PN), localization precision (LP), and Voronoi density (VD) thresholds in the \u201cVoronoi Tessellation parameters\u201d panel. Before running longer randomization, first, simulate with \u223c5 randomization steps, and verify the K, L, and PCF plots. By default, Grafeo performs randomization, since the spatial statistics functions are meaningless without appropriate comparison to a null hypothesis (here, the randomized data that represent independent (bivariate functions) or random (univariate functions) distributions).\nVisualizing the spatial statistics functions. To visualize the output Ripley's K, L, or PCF functions, go to the main Grafeo menu bar and select \u201cRipley\u2019s analysis\u201d-> \u201cPlot randomized\u201d, and choose the variable that you wish to plot (univariate/bivariate Ripley\u2019s K, L, or PCF), press \u201cok\u201d and then select the figure display parameters, Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E and 6F. The plot shows experimental (observed) function (e.g., L, K, PCF) as a solid violet line overlaid on the 5% and 95% randomization envelopes (blue shaded area) and the average function overall randomization steps (blue line), Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B\u20138E, 8H, and 8J. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nFitting the model to the univariate and bivariate PCF functions. The current version of Grafeo (v3.1) permits fitting the model functions to univariate (PCFx or an autocorrelation function ACF) and bivariate (PCFxy) point correlation function (Sengupta et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Veatch et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Sengupta, Jovanovic-Talisman and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). To perform the fit, press \u201cFit PCF\u201d push button located in the \u201cVoronoi, Ripley, Graph in ROI\u201d panel.Selecting the model. You will be prompted to choose a variable that you want to fit a model to, Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A. To fit ACF chose \u201c1 Gauss\u00a0+ 1 exGauss\u201d option and to fit PCFxy chose \u201c1 exGauss\u201d, Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig7.jpg\nFigure\u00a07. Fitting a model to PCF functions\n(A) A selection panel for the PCF model fitting.\n(B) A selection panel for the fit type, select '1 Gauss\u00a0+ 1 exGuss' and '1 exGauss' for univariate and bivariate PCF, respectively.\n(C) The input parameters for PCF model fitting, from top to bottom: (1) the X range of fit in the form of element vector (1 \u2013 the first, 50 - the fifties element of the distance vector at which the PCF was calculated). (2\u20134) The lower (2) and upper (3) bonds and (4) initial fit parameters. To see the fit equations, press the 'PCF equation' pushbutton. (5) The estimated localization uncertainty. For the univariate PCF, only the first element is used. (6) The X-axis label. (7\u20138) The Y (7) and X-axis (8) ticks. The first and the last element are also applied as the axes limits. (9) Polynomial degree for the polynomial detrending of PCF/K/L functions, typically 2 or 3.\nEstimating the variable input parameters. The localization uncertainty (\u03c3) and the average molecule density (\u03c1) should be estimated prior to fitting (see \u201cmodel fitting to ACF and PCF[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]\u201d in the \u201cmaterials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]\u201d section). The uncertainty \u03c3 can be estimated from the localization precision. However we recommend to perform the fit (see step 15b,i below).Fitting the ACF model to Point Spread Function (PSF). Grafeo permits fitting the model to recover \u03c3. This requires dataset where the molecule of interest is distributed randomly and does not form any clusters with more than one molecule. We recommend imaging the secondary antibodies on the cover glass in the same imaging conditions as your experiment. First, calculate the PCF as described in the step 13 or load the previously obtained data (\u201cRipley\u2019s analysis\u201d -> \u2018Load randomized\u201d). To fit the model press \u201cFit PSF\u201d pushbutton located in the \u201cVoronoi, Ripley, Graph in ROI\u201d panel. Note, if you fit the model on the isolated secondary antibodies, the fit parameter \u03c1 will correspond to the average density of your antibodies and not of your molecule of interest. To estimate \u03c1 for your molecule of interest, divide the mean VD for your molecule of interest by the average number of detection within a cluster formed by the isolated secondary anybody. To recover the mean detections per antibody, segment clusters generated by isolated antibodies as described in the section \u201cgraph-based cluster analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]\u201d. Use the mean VD over all image or in the small ROI (see \u201cgraph-based cluster analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]\u201d step 16 for more details).Providing the initial values. A pop-up window will be displayed, and you will have to provide the input parameters, such as the initial value for the fit parameters (x0), and their upper (UB), and lower bonds (LB), Figure\u00a07[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C. Grafeo fits three parameters: the average molecule density \u2013 \u03c1, correlation amplitude - A, and the correlation length \u2013 d. However, it is strongly recommended to fit only second (A) and third (d) parameter (second and third element of the UP, LB, and x0 parameters) and to constrain the first parameter (\u03c1) by setting UP, LB, and x0 to the estimated density of molecules (see step above).\nNote: The quality of the fit can be susceptible to x0, UB, and LB. Test different initial parameters. After the fit is completed, you will be prompted to save the data. The figure showing fit results will be displayed automatically, Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]F, 8G, 8I, and 8K, where the fitted function is displayed as a solid red line.\nNote: For detailed information about model fitting and the description of parameters, please refer to (Peaucelle, Wightman and Haas, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).

Animated scatter plot of the data shown in Figure\u00a08A, related to step 11\nGraph-based cluster analysis\nTiming: variable time, few seconds to tens of minutesThis section describes undirected graph-based cluster analysis on the data in the active ROI, Figure\u00a010[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10] (Shivanandan et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Levet et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Khater, Nabi and Hamarneh, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The graph is computed using 2D or 3D Delaunay triangulation converted to an undirected graph consisting of nodes (data points) connected by undirected edges (Delaunay triangulation DT edges) (Yang and Cui, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). The graph-based analysis permits segmenting objects (clusters) by tresholding the maximum inter point distance (ipd, or graph edge length), the minimum number of points in a cluster (area, or the number of detections/points), and a node degree (the number of connections with other points). These functions are located in the panel \u201cVoronoi, Ripley, Graph in ROI\u201d, and can be applied to a 2D or 3D dataset. For three colors, the functions are computed pairwise.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig10.jpg\nFigure\u00a010.

In (C) a red arrowhead indicates a point associated with a large Voronoi polygon (dispersed data, noise) and black arrow shows a point associated with a small Voronoi polygon (dense, clustered data). This propriety is implemented to efficiently filter the data based on the Voronoi polygon size and permits separating dense clustered data from the noise or dispersed points.\n(D and E) The results of graph segmentation in lateral xy view \u2013 (D), and in 3D view \u2013 (E).\nSegmenting the clusters.\nFirst, draw an ROI as described in the \u201cdata visualization[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]\u201d section.Then press \u201cGraph\u201d. You will be prompted to provide several input parameters, Figure\u00a011[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11], notably, a minimum number of points in a final segmented graph, a maximum inter point distance, ipd (a maximum DT edge length), and the nodes degree (a minimum number of connections with other points). For a dense cluster (high VD), the node's degree is typically high. Good starting values are minimum 3\u20135 detections, nd\u223c2\u20133, ipd \u223c50\u00a0nm. Graph-based analysis can be calculated using 2D or 3D Delaunay triangulation. The maximum colocalization distance (valid only for multicolor data) is a maximum distance separating segmented clusters from two channels. If a segmented graph (cluster) has no neighbor at this distance or smaller, it is removed from the analysis. Thus, choose a high colocalization distance to retain all the segmented clusters. Graph-based data analysis is performed on two channels at a time. Thus, the analysis has to be performed pairwise. For three-color data, select the channels you want to run the analysis for (the last parameter in Figure\u00a011[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig11.jpg\nFigure\u00a011. Performing the graph-based segmentationThe input parameters for the graph-based object segmentation. From top to bottom: (1) The minimum number of points for the final segmented graph. (2) The maximum edge length (the same as interpoint distance, ipd). (3) A node degree, i.e., a minimum number of connections with other points (nodes) in a final segmented graph. (4) The dimension for Delaunay triangulation calculation, 2 or 3 (only for the 3D data). (5) The maximum distance between a segmented graph of the first color and the nearest segmented graph of the second color. (6) Select the mean or median to calculate the cluster density (by default it is median). (7) The number of the nearest neighbors for the colocalization analysis. (8) The channel selection for the analysis; type [1,2], [1,3], or [2,3].\nOnce the segmentation is completed, you will be prompted to save the results to a file. If no clusters were segmented in at least one channel, the file would not be saved, and you will have to adjust the segmentation parameters. See troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nNote: Cluster analysis can be lengthy for large data sets. Before running the analysis, try first testing small ROI to adjust the segmentation parameters.\nGraph visualization.

If the data is 3D and the graph segmentation was performed in 3D, you can rotate the Matlab plot. You can control the figure display by adjusting parameters in the \"ROI plot\", e.g., marker color and transparency, edge/line width and transparency.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/990-Fig12.jpg\nFigure\u00a012.

It will also load ROI that was used for the graph segmentation.\nVoronoi Tessellation visualization. To plot 2D or 3D Voronoi diagrams from the data in a small ROI, press \u201c3d Voronoi\u201d. This function is not performing a full cluster segmentation. Thus, the Voronoi diagram may be continues. However, it lets you adjust the minimum/maximum displayed VD to suppress the large/small VPs and to disconnect the clusters, Figure\u00a013[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]. When using \u201c3d Voronoi\u201d function, the average VD in a ROI will be displayed in the Matlab command window both before and after suppressing the large/small VPs. The last input parameter permits the control of the individual VP plot, as either calculated VP or the convex hull of a VP (the smallest convex polygon/polyhedron in 2D/3D that enclose the vertices defining a Voronoi Polygon).

Dimensions and a top view of an example EE box\n(left) EE box converted from a 30-gallon storage box; blue points represent where the feeder is attached on the inside. (Right) a top view of a finished EE box. Numbers indicate different supplies in an EE cage, including (1) cage cover made from window screen; (2) Kaytee running wheel; (3) tunnels made from Grainger vent pipes; (4) Penn Plax ladder to connect the feeder; (5) feeder from a typical automated rat housing cage (Allentown), attached to walls with cable ties; (6) rodent chow; (7) water bottle; (8) toys with varied color, shape, and textures; (9) Kimwipes as nesting materials.\nDrill four holes on the long walls of the EE box according to the locations in Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nUse four cable ties to attach the four corners of the feeder to the walls.\nEvenly spread 1-inch thick of standard bedding materials onto the EE box floor.\nFill the feeder with standard rodent chows and a water bottle to provide ad libitum access to food and water.\nAttach the ladder to the feeder.Spread 10\u201315 pellets of rodent chow randomly on the bedding materials.\nThese steps are designed to encourage foraging behaviors, which has been linked to the success of enrichment (Hutchinson et\u00a0al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nAdd 10 pieces of Kimwipes to serve as nesting materials.\nOptional: This can be replaced by other long-fiber nesting materials provided by the animal facility.\nPlace a running wheel and up to 3 pieces of tunnels to EE cages, see Figure\u00a01[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for an example.\nSee key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for running wheel size information.\nThe orientation of the tunnels and the running wheels are changed together with the cage cleaning in step 20 and 21.\nRandomly spread 6\u201310 objects onto the bedding materials. At a given moment, the objects in the EE box should be of at least two textures [ceramic (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for examples and general dimension), plastic, or wooden], colors, and shapes (ball, square/rectangular, triangle, etc.)\nChange the types of objects three times a week during weekdays (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). This step is typically brief and does not require the complete removal of animals during the item changing.\nWithin each week, avoid using the same objects for more than twice.\nWhen removed, objects should be rinsed with water and disinfected with 70% ethanol, and then stored in airtight Ziplock bags to avoid contamination.\nLoading animals into the EE boxes\nTiming: 2 hDuration and age of exposure are critical parameters of EE protocols, as they can determine the success of enrichment, depending on the endpoints being tested (Leger et\u00a0al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). In our lab, 10- or 20-day continuous EE paradigms have been given to male MAM rats and SAL controls. Here we describe important experimental steps for housing rats at different ages in EE cages. This protocol used animals aged between P21-40 and P65-84.\nFor every age group, house 5 age-matched rats per EE cage. (max age in EE box: P84).\nFor the prepubertal P21-30 or P21-40 EE groups, on P21 directly load the weanlings to the EE cage.\nSAL and MAM rats are mixed and loaded into the same EE boxes, and therefore clear marking is essential. Check everyday to ensure visible tail marks.\nMark the tails with differently colored bands using a permanent marker to differentiate individual animals.\nCritical: Since MAM or SAL injection are maternal manipulations, to avoid litter effects we recommend using 1 or 2 representative weanlings of each litter in each EE boxes. This way each EE cage can hold rats from at least 3 litters, minimizing potential litter batch effects.\nFor P31-40 or P65-84 enrichment, on P21 directly load the weanlings into regular environment (RE) cages at a group size of 2 or 3 in a counterbalanced manner for litters.\nHouse these rats until P31 or P65, and then load them into the EE boxes in a group of 5.\nNote: For the duration of our EE protocols (maximum of 20\u00a0days), we did not observe biting even in the adult P65-84 group, consistent with the findings that Sprague Dawley rats are relatively \u201cpeaceable\u201d (Henry et\u00a0al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).Place the EE cages on a rack in the same colony room where RE cages are housed for either 10 or 20\u00a0days based on individual experimental needs.\nCritical: this step controls for light schedule, temperature/humidity, noise exposure, etc.\nCreating appropriate control groups\nTiming: 5\u00a0min, per cage\nEnvironmental enrichment is multifaceted, and its design is based on each experimental need. Thus, experimenters should be cautious in selecting control groups to avoid confounds (Ball et\u00a0al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). In our study, the primary goal was to determine whether there are preventative benefits of EE on dopamine- and hippocampus-related pathophysiology in the MAM model (Zhu and Grace, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]). Since MAM rats display prominent dysfunctions even in paired- or triple-housed social conditions (Modinos et\u00a0al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]), we did not include a social-deprivation control group. Moreover, we did not create control groups specifically for each enrichment element, because our emphasis was to determine whether relatively complete enrichment experiences (with all enriching elements) are sufficient to prevent later pathophysiology in the MAM model.\nWean all the rats for RE groups on P21.\nRE groups are weaned and housed in 2\u20133 rats per cage.\nSame control for litter effect (see step 11 and 12) also applies, i.e., when possible, each RE cage should contain one representative pup from each litter. No more than two pups from a single litter are included in a single RE cage.\nPlace the RE cages onto the automated rack system.\nNote: Except for the weekly cage change conducted by institution\u2019s animal care staff, rats in RE groups are generally undisturbed throughout the study. However, to control for handling stress, brief handling (e.g., picking animals from home cages, body weight recording, examine signs of injury, etc.) are given to RE rats on the same schedule of EE cage maintenance (see step 17).Optional: depriving animals from and/or varying certain EE elements can be used to create subgroups in the control animals. This would allow studies to determine the necessary/critical factors (e.g., cognitive, social and/or physical exercise) in the designed experiments. For example, dissociable effects of social vs. physical EE have been tested in rats, and the physical exercise of EE is deemed uniquely influential to brain plasticity-related changes (Brenes et\u00a0al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCleaning, maintaining, and animal observing during EE paradigms\nTiming: 5\u201315\u00a0min\nThroughout the EE periods, perform daily, twice-a-week, and weekly maintenance to the EE cages according to the Steps outlined below. In our study, RE cages are maintained mainly by the institutional animal care staff, which entails a weekly cage change to refill food and completely replace cage, beddings, and nestlets.\nQuietly observe the EE animals daily for signs of injury or distress.\nThis can be done without removing EE cage mesh cover, but if necessary, gently transfer the animals to a separate cage for further inspection.\nInspect levels of food and water for refill.\nThe bedding materials of EE cages are changed/cleaned twice a week.\nA major change is scheduled every 7\u00a0days following the initial loading of the animals.\nA minor change occurs three days after the initial animal loading and after every major change.\nFor both the minor and the major cage changes, temporarily transfer all EE cage-mates into a static housing cage.\nProvide the cage with ad libitum water and food.\nProvide the cage with 3\u20135 pieces of Kimwipes as nesting materials.\nPlace the temporary transfer cages in the same colony room. Perform cage changes in a separate room to avoid potential noise exposure.\nFor the minor change [less than 5\u00a0min], simply remove all the feces and dirty bedding, and spread new bedding when necessary.For the weekly major change [10\u201315\u00a0min], clean around half of the used beddings and replace with fresh ones. Replace all other needed supplies detailed in step 6\u20138 with new ones. Clean the walls and the running wheel with 70% ethanol and examine whether the running wheel is functional.\nMajor cage change is typically conducted on the same days for RE cage changes to control for handling effects.\nReplace the rats back to the EE cages.\nOptional: cage changes should be combined with experiments such as blood draw, body weight recording, behavioral assays, etc. to avoid excessive handling.\nReturn EE rats to RE cages\nTiming: 30\u00a0min\u20131 h\nIn the afternoons of P30, P40 or P84, return EE rats to RE cages at a group size of 2\u20133 rats/cage\nNote: When possible, counterbalance for litters.\nNote: Rats returned both prepubertally (i.e., on P30 or P40) or as adults are expected to acclimate to the RE cages in a peaceful manner. Thus, we did not find signs of biting during the return of adult EE rats in our study, at least for the duration until the completion of experiments.\nThereafter, rats previously exposed to EE stay in RE cages until the end of all experiments.\nRecord the delay between EE completion and each testing date, as these data could be useful to study the recency effect of EE.\nDispose the used bedding according to institution\u2019s regulations. Inform the animal facility staff to clean the EE cages.\nIn our study, EE cages were reused after cage cleaning and disinfection by ethanol (step 2).", "This protocol was approved by the Emory Institutional Review Board and the Atlanta Veterans Administration Research & Development Committee. All participants signed an informed consent document prior to participation.\n1. Participant recruitment\nRecruit older adults and individuals with PD and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (pAD) through flyers, registries, referrals, PD newsletters, educational meetings, webinars, support groups, older adult living communities, and websites (see Table 1 for participant information).\nEnsure the participants with PD have been diagnosed with \"idiopathic\" Parkinson's and positively respond to dopaminergic therapy7. Ensure that those with pAD have mild cognitive impairment with subjective memory loss.\nConfirm that participants with either PD or pAD have no other neurological insult and can ambulate 3 meters or more with and without assistance.\n2. Safety training\nTrain staff, instructors, care partners, and volunteers through an in-person experiential balance management class, a systematic approach to understanding balance, by presenting information about the three systems underlying balance: vestibular, visual, and somatosensory.\n\t\nIntroduce principles such as the base of support, the center of gravity, and limits of stability. Perform exercises such as (1) standing while shifting to the edges of one's feet and maintaining balance, (2) closing the eyes while standing and shifting weight from foot to foot, (3) observing a partner shift their weight until the partner has to take a step and learning to use body weight to support the weight of a partner.\nUse the balance management exercises from the previously mentioned balance management class (step 2.1.1) to increase the team's ability to detect and prevent potential falls in a rehabilitative movement class.\nProvide ongoing education to staff given by the principal investigator (PI) and staff physical therapists regarding protecting participants with specific gait and balance impairments.\n3. Technological considerationsIdentify and use any commercially available fitness app (see the Table of Materials) that can track time, distance, steps, pace, elevation, and other parameters needed for goal setting and to show progress.\nIdentify a team meeting platform with video and sound capabilities (see the Table of Materials) for the virtual warm up.\nUse a one-tap mobile or conference call line for the virtual walk and cool down.\nUtilize heart rate monitors (see the Table of Materials) to track the heart rate throughout the walk.\nCreate detailed written and picture instructions for using the fitness app, video team meeting platform, and conference call line. Email the instructions to all new participants 2 days prior to the walk day. Give technical support to all participants prior to and throughout the walks.\n4. Overground walk environment\nPlan and inspect a safe outdoor walking route in terms of the convenience, safety, and appropriateness for older adults with sensory and motor impairments prior to the in-person walk in the local neighborhood, town, or near the older adult center.\n\t\nMake a note of rest spots, benches, and shade, which can be useful during the walk, any uneven surfaces and curbs, which may present safety issues, and other important environmental assets or hazards. Consider the amount of traffic in the area and the overall quality of the sidewalks and/or walking paths.\nEnsure that there is an appropriate, older adult-safe walking environment, including limited traffic, clear and even sidewalks, benches or other rest spots, shade, and mostly level ground. Some small inclines and declines may be tolerable, but check for ramps for those participants using rolling walkers.\n5. Participant screening for virtual versus in-person walking groupsRequest that the participants complete a questionnaire regarding their age, education, medical history, fall history, use of assistive devices such as canes/walkers, and current medications during their initial testing session or prior to the first walk. Review the form with all the participants to ensure completeness/accuracy.\n\tNOTE: Participants are not deemed appropriate for virtual walking classes due to safety considerations if they have a score of 4 or higher or if they answer \"yes\" to any of the first three key questions on the Stay Independent Screener8, if the participant scores a 2 or higher on item 3 of the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire9, if an assistive device is used regularly, or if the participant reports falling more than once per month.\nUse other fitness metrics to assess the fitness to maintain safety and to evaluate progress (e.g., heart rate monitoring, VO2 submaximal assessment, 6 min walk test, Mini Best test, and vascular function measurement using a commercially available device)10,11,12 (see the Table of Materials).\n6. Schedule the participants for a walk\nHost virtual and in-person walks simultaneously with the number of staff necessary to fill the lead, co-lead, and back-marker positions, as well as any other staff needed for safety/assistance.\nSchedule the walks at a time of day that is appropriate for the group.\nSchedule the walks twice per week for 12 weeks, ensuring a minimum of 20 walks in total. After 12 weeks, invite the participants to walk once per week. The walk presented in this study was 90 min, including the warm up, walk, and cool down.\nEmail the virtual walk group instructions to participants 2 days prior to the day of the walk. The instructions are below:\n\t\nUse an invitation with a link to a one-tap mobile or other video or conference call line.Provide new participants with instructions on how to use the technology and fitness tracking app, as well as regarding safety and appropriate attire.\n7. Staff roles and responsibilities\nGroup lead responsibilities\n\t\nIdentify participants who have similar walking abilities before the walk. Assign back-markers/staff to participants who are deemed a high fall risk to protect them during the warm up, walk, and cool down.\nIntroduce the self and the co-leader at the beginning of the session, along with other staff members. Educate the participants on the Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) 10-point scale13, which is used to determine the participant's perceptions of their physical effort. Briefly discuss the session's agenda.\nLead a total body warm up using cues for safety, effort, and time/repetitions.\nMonitor the remote participants during the warm up to ensure proper form, alignment, and safety.\nMotivate the participants. Tell them they are doing well if they participate. Congratulate all the participants on their efforts.\nPay attention to the time for the warm ups, breaks, walks, and cool downs.\nAssess the participants continuously during one-tap mobile/conference call during the walk for safety, intensity, and form.\nProvide verbal cues for posture and gait mechanics (Table 2) after each RPE update and if a participant has not been heard speaking for a long period of time (to ensure we do not lose contact with a participant).\nEncourage rest and hydration breaks.\nAsk the participants about their walking environment (e.g., sidewalks, hills, etc.) and their walking form (posture). Check in with the participants frequently about safety concerns and how they can monitor and maintain good biomechanics of gait.\nLead the cool-down after the walk on the one-tap mobile or conference call line.\nAnswer any questions regarding the technology, walking form, intensity, goals, etc.Take over responsibilities if the co-leader becomes disconnected for any reason.\nCo-lead responsibilities\n\t\nEmail the participant information and instructions for the fitness tracking app and team meeting links to all the participants 2 days prior to the walk.\nTake attendance at the start of the meeting. If a participant is not in attendance, call the participant to check on them.\nAssist the participants with the use of technology during the practice team meeting video calls.\nAssist the participants during the transition between the video call and the one-tap mobile call during the 5 min break.\nAssist the participants with the setting up, usage, and starting/stopping of the fitness tracking app.\nAsk and record the participants' RPE and heart rates pre-warm up, post-warm up, and at the 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min time points of the walk.\nManually record the RPE, heart rates, steps, distance walked, elevation, and average pace for the participants at the 45 min time point of the walk.\nEnter the data into any commercially available database survey software immediately or as soon as possible after collecting the data.\nTake over group leader responsibilities should the group leader become disconnected from the call for any reason.\nBack-marker/other staff responsibilities\n\t\nEnsure all the participants' safety, particularly for the participants who have slower walking speeds, use an assistive device, or have a heightened fall risk, postural instability, or freezing of gait. Staff may be paired one-on-one or even two-on-one with participants who have been deemed a high fall risk.\nEnsure participants are walking along the same route and no participants become lost on the route. Watch for traffic carefully, and alert the group to oncoming traffic.\nAssist with any additional responsibilities as requested by the group leader or co-leader.\nSocialize with the participants during the walk.8. Virtual and in-person walk: Preparation steps\nVirtual walk procedure\n\t\nAt 15-20 min prior to the class time, log into the video team meeting. Educate new participants on the RPE scale. Lead a warm up for 25 min. Take the RPE pre- and post-warm up (co-leader).\nThe warm up is performed by the group leader with whole-body large-amplitude movements incorporating posture, weight shifting, rotation, and stepping. Lead the warm up in both seated and standing positions with cues for safety, effort, amplitude, and form. Verbally ensure the safety of the participants.\nImplement a break for 5 min to prepare the participants for the walk. Assist the participants in logging on to the approved fitness tracking app and one-tap mobile or other conference call line.\nInstruct the participants in proper posture and gait mechanics after every RPE check-in and through the walk. See Table 2 for a complete list of cues. Ask the participants to be mindful of their environments and to describe their surroundings.\nLimit the walking group to four to six participants. Strongly encourage the participants to bring a caregiver or a walking buddy to their walks. Discuss with the participants the location and terrain of the walks prior to the first walk to ensure safety and familiarity with the chosen area.\nTake and record the participant's RPE at 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min.\nAsk the participants to stop their fitness tracking app after 45 min and participate in a 5-10 min guided cool down from the instructor delivered through the audio function.\nIn-person walk procedure\n\t\nArrive at an established walking location wearing a mask. Screen the participants for COVID-19, and assist with wearable HR and fitness tracking technology. Educate new participants on the RPE scale and agenda.Lead a warm up with whole-body large-amplitude movements incorporating posture, weight shifting, rotation, and stepping. Lead both seated and standing exercises with cues for safety, effort, amplitude, and form. Have an assigned staff member protect the participants with balance impairments to ensure their safety.\nRecord the RPE and HR pre- and post-warm up.\nImplement a break for 5 min to prepare the participants for the walk. Assist the participants in starting the walking app technology.\nDivide the walking group into smaller groups based on speed, ability, and fall risk. Assign each walking group a leader, a back-marker, and/or other study staff, with one person in each group remaining on the audio call. The leader of the group with the greatest walking mobility leads the virtual walking group.\nRecord the RPE and HR at the 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min time points.\nGive posture and gait cues at the beginning of the walk at 15 min, 30 min, and 45 min. Safety is of the utmost importance. Participants who are considered a high fall risk will have at least one person walking with them for safety and guarding. These individuals should be closely monitored for fatigue. Give cues for environmental hazards and encourage rest breaks and the use of assistive devices.\nAsk the participants to stop their walking app at the 45 min time point and participate in a 5-10 min guided cool down.\nAdminister a satisfaction questionnaire intermittently (approximately every 10 classes) to determine the level of enjoyment the participants are experiencing.\n9. Participant post-evaluation\nMeasure the chosen fitness metrics, as noted in step 5.2, to determine the change in the participants' fitness over the course of the walking program.\nAdminister a participant satisfaction survey.\nSubscription Required.

Method\n1.1 Apparatus\nThe successive alleys apparatus consists of four successive linearly connected alleys of putatively increasing anxiogenic character and is made of painted wood (see Figure 1 and, for comparison, Figure 2 of a plus-maze). Details are shown in Table 1:\ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2,3,4\nAlley,Length,Width,Wall height,Color\n1,25.0,8.5,25.0,Black\n2,25.0,8.5,5.0,Grey\n3,25.0,3.5,0.8,White\n4,25.0,1.2,0.2,White\nTable 1. Construction details for the successive alleys apparatus. All dimensions are in cm.\nThe apparatus is elevated approximately 50 cm by clamping the back-extended floor of alley 1 to a laboratory bench, shelf or other support. The open end of alley 1 should be at least 10 cm away from the support to prevent mice trying to climb on to it. Provide adequate and ample padding under the alleys in case a mouse falls off.\nThe rationale for the different wall heights was: those of alley 1 need to be high to maximize its non-anxiogenic properties. Also high walls create a darker environment as long as the laboratory light source is not immediately overhead. The walls of alley 2 were judged from experience to appear less safe than alley 1 to mice, but to still provide some degree of protection. Alleys 3 and 4 had just enough height to maximize anxiety but still provide a grip if the mouse was in danger of falling off. In practice falls are rare, and no more frequent than on the plus-maze.\nThe apparatus should be handled carefully as the narrow Alley 4 is particularly susceptible to damage. If securely fastened, the apparatus should not vibrate as the mouse moves over it. To minimize both of these potential problems, the apparatus could be given a strengthening extra \"spine\" spanning its length under the floor. A successive alleys apparatus for rats can also be made. Details are shown in Table 2:\ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2,3,4Alley,Length,Width,Wall height,Color\n1,45.0,9.0,29.0,Black\n2,45.0,9.0,2.5,Grey\n3,45.0,6.7,0.5,White\n4,45.0,3.5,0.3,White\nTable 2. Construction details for the successive alleys apparatus for rats. All dimensions are in cm.\n1.2 Procedure\n* Bring the mice to the experimental room 5-20 min before testing to ensure that they are adapted to the room and are at a moderate level of arousal.\n* As with all experiments where animals are tested once for spontaneous behavior on a novel apparatus, it is good practice for the alleys to be first given a mouse odor; place non-experimental mice on the apparatus for a few minutes, then clean the apparatus as during the main experiment. The objective is to ensure a slight but uniform background mouse odor, on the basis that it is impossible to totally remove animal odor (let alone prove that this has been achieved).\n* Place a mouse at the closed end of alley 1 facing the wall. Start timers 1) for the overall length of the test + latency to enter arms, and 2) time spent in alley 1. When the mouse places all 4 feet on to the next alley it is considered to have entered it. Record total time spent in each alley (all four feet) and the number of entries (both forward and backward). Record the number of faecal boli and whether any urination has occurred.\n* Test duration: 5 min. (This is the normal time; if you know or suspect that the animals you are testing will not be very anxious, shortening the test duration to 3 min may be advantageous. Note what time you do use).* A combined event counter/timer is invaluable for this work as well as for timing the plus-maze. We have a battery-powered portable one with four buttons, each associated with an event counter and a timer (1/10 s), built in the Psychology department. Pressing button 1 registers an event (entry into alley 1) and starts a timer. Releasing the button stops the timer. Pressing button 2 registers an alley 2 entry and starts alley 2 timer, etc. However, one must subtract one entry from the total number of entries registered on alley 1 as the first entry was initiated by the experimenter, not the mouse.\n* To summarize; for each alley record: the latency to enter it (apart from alley 1 of course), the number of entries into it and the total time spent there.\n* If a mouse falls off, stop the clock and replace it on the alley from which it fell, facing alley 1.\n* All urine and faeces are removed between animals and the apparatus cleaned with a damp, followed by a dry tissue. It is important to clean and disinfect the equipment between each mouse tested.\n* In addition, always wear gloves when handling rodents.", "This protocol was executed in compliance with the procedural regulations of the Bioethics Committee of the University of Burgos (Spain) number IO 03/2022.

The questionnaire also includes an open-ended question about the student's motivation toward the subject.\nSession 3: Informing the students about the project-based teaching methodology and the different resources to be used\n\t\nProvide the students with a guide for how PBL will be delivered as well as rubrics for the evaluation of the project and the presentation of the project.\nInform the students about the advanced learning technology\u00a0resources available (intelligent voice assistants, process-oriented personalized feedback, virtual laboratories, questionnaires with feedbackon the qualification, flipped classroom experiences,and PBL experiences).\n\t\tNOTE: Students have access to a document detailing the PBL methodology (see Supplemental Material Appendix 1) and two rubrics for carrying out the project and presenting it (see Supplemental Material Appendix 2).\n\t\t\nEnsure that, in the e-Learning group, students are assisted by an intelligent voice assistant that informs them about course events.In the b-Learning group, do not use this resource, but ask the participants to carry out the project in a physical simulation laboratory and not only virtually, as in the case of the e-learning group.\nSession 4: Choice of case study\n\t\nOrganize the students into groups of two to five participants and ask each group to choose from a series of practical cases related to different developmental disorders (physical, psychological, or sensory) in children aged 0-6 years.\n\t\tNOTE: The case studies include data from the clinical history (an example can be found in the Supplemental Material Appendix 3).\nSession 5: Description of the scope of the project intervention\n\t\nAsk each group to prepare an introduction describing the type of service in which they will implement their project (they can choose between an intervention in the field of health, education, patient groups, or private services within the framework of early care).\n\t\tNOTE: The students elaborate the works in a creative way; some examples can be consulted in the Supplemental Material Appendix 4.\nSession 6: Description of the professionals working in the intervention area\n\t\nAsk each group to describe the role of the professionals who will intervene, as well as the relationship structure that will be applied, encouraging interdisciplinary working.\nSession 7: Description of the intervention case study\n\t\nAsk each group to describe the characteristics of the pathology or developmental disorder.\nSession 8: Creation of the intervention programAsk each group to prepare various phases within the intervention program that address the following elements: an initial user assessment, the proposed evaluation indicators based on the results from the initial assessment, the proposed intervention procedure to achieve the development of skills or behaviors in children, the materials required for the intervention, a proposal of the generalization activities, and a plan for the follow-up for the intervention.\n\t\t\nIn virtual laboratories, have the teacher help the students in the e-Learning group.\n\t\t\tNOTE. For an example of the help provided to the e-Learning students in virtual laboratories, see Supplemental Material Appendix 5.\nCarry out this part of the project via practical classes in the simulation center for the b-Learning group.\nSession 9: Production of a project document\n\t\nAsk each group to provide a document explaining the project created for the practical case chosen.\n\t\tNOTE: The project is evaluated using the project development evaluation rubric (see Supplemental Material Appendix 2).\nSession 10: Presentation of the project\n\t\nAsk each group to present the project about the practical case they chose.\n\t\tNOTE: The presentation is given to their classmates and the professor.\nEvaluate the presentation. Perform the evaluation of the presentation according to the presentation evaluation rubric (see Supplemental Material Appendix 2).\nSession 11: Follow-up of the students' work\n\t\nAssess the interaction of the student groups on the UBUVirtual platform via the students' behavior monitoring software41 tool, which allows the interaction of students to be analyzed individually (Figure 2) and in groups (Figure 3).\nTo perform group analysis: Click the Group Icon > Group 01 > Select All > Logs. Select Components > Select All pointing from Visual Analytics and then select Heatmap. This will generate a heatmap that allows the interaction to be analyzed individually, as shown in Figure 2.To perform the individual analysis: Click Select All > Comparisons. Select Logs > Components. Then, click Select All pointing from Visual Analytics and select Heatmap. This will generate a heatmap that allows the interaction to be analyzed as a group, as shown in Figure 3.\nUse the tool to determine what interactions each student has individually (Figure 4) and within a group (follow step 2.11.2 and step 2.11.3).\nSession 12: Evaluation of student satisfaction with project-based learning\n\t\nAsk each student to complete an opinion survey about their satisfaction with PBL work at the end of the course (Table 3).\n\t\tNOTE: The PBL satisfaction survey consists of 17 closed response questions measured on a Likert-type scale from 1 to 5 and two open response questions. The Cronbach's alpha reliability index in this study was \u03b1 = 0.89 for the overall scale and \u03b1 = 0.88-0.91 for each item if the item was removed.\nSession 13: Data analysis\n\t\nFor the first question (RQ1: Are there significant differences in the learning outcomes and satisfaction of health sciences students studying occupational therapy depending on whether the PBL methodology is implemented via e-Learning versus b-Learning, considering the effects of students' prior knowledge?), import all the data from the spreadsheet into the statistical program, SPSS42: elaboration of PBL (LOEPBL), presentation of PBL (LOEXPBL), learning outcomes total (LOT), obtaining LMS access (LMSA), satisfaction of the students with teaching (SPBL), the independent variable (the type of e-Learning modality, i.e., implementation year of the teaching, and the covariate (prior knowledge).\n\t\t\nDo this for both the groups of e-Learning versus b-Learning teaching modalities (during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic with online teaching) and for b-Learning (during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic with mixed teaching, partly in person and partly online).Perform an ANCOVA with fixed effects (teaching modality: e-Learning vs. b-Learning) and the covariate (prior knowledge).\nSelect Multivariate Analysis and include the dependent variables (LOEPBL, LOEXPBL, LOT, LMSA, and SPBL), the independent variable (the type of teaching modality for b-Learning), and the covariate (prior knowledge).\nEstimate the marginal means and perform the ANCOVA analysis by pressing the OK button.\nFor the second question (RQ2: Do the clusters of participants found match the learning outcomes, learning behaviors, and perceived satisfaction as a function of teaching modality [e-Learning vs. b-Learning]?), perform the following steps:\n\t\t\nSelect Means cluster analysis and then the variables LOEPBL, LOEXPBL, LOT, LMSA, and SPBL. Then, select Cluster Membership then pause very slightly, click Continuous and pause very slightly again. Select Initial cluster centers > ANOVA table > cluster information for each case. Then, select Continue.\nSelect the cross table between the data found for cluster membership and the e-Learning versus b-Learning teaching modality groups. For Row, select the Variable Year (the type of e-Learning modality, i.e., teaching implementation year). For Column, select the Cluster Number of the case.\nPerform a cluster analysis using visualizing software. To do so, import the data into the visualizing software and select Heat Map > Radviz. Implement the visualization of the clusters with the different variables studied with respect to the relationship with the teaching modality used.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The free data mining software43 (see the Table of Materials) was used for this analysis.\nFor the third question (RQ3: Are the students' suggestions for the improvement of the PBL methodology different depending on the teaching modality, e-Learning versus b-Learning?), perform the following steps.Perform a qualitative analysis of the open answers found in the PBL13 satisfaction scale for the two groups of e-Learning versus b-Learning using qualitative data analysis software44. Import the answers to the open-ended questions obtained on the satisfaction of the students with the teaching (SPBL) into the software.\nSelect Categorizing Student Responses in the two teaching modalities, e-Learning versus b-Learning.\nSelect the Document group (teaching modality: e-Learning vs. b-Learning) analysis.\nSelect Sankey Diagram.\nExport the results into a spreadsheet software.\n\t\t\tNOTE: First, the responses to the open-ended questions were categorized in each teaching modality group (e-Learning vs. b-Learning), and a frequency analysis was performed on the responses by group and categorization.

Please recommend JoVE to your librarian.", "NOTE: The following protocol was developed in accordance with ethical standards approved by the Institutional Review Board at Illinois Wesleyan University.\n1. Cyberball Stimulus Preparation\nDownload the Cyberball paradigm12,18 and install it on the computer (the current protocol utilized images from Cyberball version 3.0). Alternatively, create computerized images to recreate the Cyberball paradigm to meet specific needs.\nCreate individual images for each portion of the throws within Cyberball by using a photo-editing program. For example, break down each of the throws from player to player into the individual throw frames that are shown one after another to create the image of a ball being thrown from player to player on the computer screen (see Figure 1).\nAdd any labels, names, or pictures to each individual throw frame in the photo-editing program, including anything to represent the human participant as the bottom player on the screen (represented by the hand at the bottom of the screen in Figure 1) to create a series of throw frames that are identical except for the movement of the ball from player to player.\nNote which frame in each throw sequence is the \u201cinformational frame\u201d for that throw, or the first frame within the throw sequences that provides information to the players about the specific destination of the throw (i.e., which other player will receive the ball).\nEnsure that there are throw sequences creating a throw from each player to each other player on the screen (including throws from the human participant to the other players), that each throw sequence has the same number of throw frames, and the informational frame within each throw sequence has been noted.\n2. Cyberball Social Interaction Programming\nCreate a sequence file using stimulus presentation software to detail the exact sequence of events within the Cyberball social interaction.For the sequence file, specify the specific throw frames (in order), the timing of the frames on the screen, the sequencing of the frames, the nature of the event (throw from whom to whom), the response required by the human participant (when necessary), and the overall order of events to create the desired interaction. Explicitly enter all of these specifications into the proper rows, columns, and spaces within the programming code during the creation of the sequence file.\nSpecify all of the above-mentioned specifics within the programming code for each event within the sequence file and repeat the steps for each sequence file created (e.g., inclusion, exclusion).\n\t\t\nOrder each of the throw frames in the correct sequence within the sequence file so that the first ball toss is completed without error from one player to the other. Create similar ordered sequences in the file for each type of throw among the players so that each type of throw is represented in the sequence file (e.g., a three-player game consists of six different possible throws).\nSpace the timing of each throw frame 450 msec apart. In this method, ensure that each frame appears for 450 msec before being replaced by the next frame, which provides an image of motion on the screen for the participant and creates a throw event that lasts a total of 2,700 msec.Insert an event-related marker each time an informational frame is presented in the sequence file so that the presentation of the informational frame can be marked in time in the file saving the participants\u2019 neural activity. Code this marker to represent the nature of the event by using numbers to represent the players (left player is player \u201c1,\u201d the bottom player is player \u201c2,\u201d the right player is player \u201c3\u201d), which would allow the code \u201c13\u201d to represent a throw from the player on the left to the player on the right.\nCopy the entire set of six different throw sequences within the file so that each throw sequence is represented at least twice within the sequence file. This will provide programming flexibility to change the order of events within each block so that they do not look pre-determined.\nCreate \u201cif, then\u201d statements within the sequence file to allow the human participant to freely select which player will receive the next throw following the human participant. Give the human participant a response pad or mouse to select the next action after receiving a ball toss; potentially using the right mouse button to throw to the player on the right and using the left mouse button to throw to the player on the left in a three-player game.\nEnsure that the \u201cif, then\u201d statements lead to the appropriate next throw sequence so that the game play appears seamless (i.e., a human throw to the player on the left should be followed by a throw from the player on the left to another player).\nCreate loops and \u201cif, then\u201d statements within the sequence file to represent the desired game action and allow the program to appropriately move to the next event regardless of the selections of the human participant.Initiate counters within the program to change the nature of the game so that the program does not become apparent to the human player (i.e., the same computerized player does not always make the same throw). Use these counters to switch the game action and remove patterns of play throughout the game after the repeated occurrence of a specific event or pattern of events to better give the appearance of spontaneous live play among players on the sides of the screen, not just the actual human participant represented on the bottom of the screen.\nDevelop different sequence files in order to study different types of social interactions. Make these interactions largely inclusive or exclusive, or even partially inclusive or exclusive, for the human participant depending on the nature of the research question by varying the proportion and order of inclusionary events and exclusionary events within each sequence file.\nEnsure that the event markers appear in the EEG files when collecting neural data to create event-related brain potentials (ERPs) for each event type within each of the different social interactions. These markers should appear in the EEG file as the informational frame is presented to the participant.\n3. Neuroelectric Recording\nPrepare participants for electroencephalography (EEG) assessment in accordance with the guidelines of the Society for Psychophysiological Research19.\nUse a lycra electrode cap embedded with 64 sintered Ag-AgCl electrodes (10 mm), arranged in a 10\u201310 system montage20 to collect EEG data. Fit the cap on the participant\u2019s head and prepare each electrode using conductive gel.\n\t\nReference the electrodes online to an electrode placed at the midpoint between Cz and CPz and use AFz as the ground electrode.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternative online references may be needed depending upon the nature of the electrode cap used for data collection.Collect vertical and horizontal bipolar electrooculographic activity (EOG) to monitor eye movements using sintered Ag-AgCl electrodes placed above and below the right orbit and near the outer canthus of each eye.\nUse a digital bioamplifier to continuously digitize (500 Hz sampling rate), amplify (gain depends on the specific amplifier), and filter (70 Hz low-pass filter, including a 60 Hz notch filter) the raw EEG signal in DC mode. Choose these setting from the available options in the EEG analysis software for the amplifier prior to data collection and vary depending on the specifications of the EEG hardware and software.\nRecord EEG activity using EEG analysis software in order to further process the neural data.\n4. Offline Neuroelectric Data Processing\nCorrect eye blinks using a spatial filter, a multi-step procedure that generates an average eye blink, utilizes a spatial singular value decomposition based on principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the first component and covariance values, and then uses those covariance values to develop a filter that is specifically sensitive to eye blinks21.\nCreate stimulus-locked epochs relative to the event marker that was inserted in the continuous EEG file in the EEG analysis software by selecting this function from the choices of data transformation options. Run these epochs from -900 msec to 1,800 msec relative to inserted marker, which is equivalent to the entire duration of each six-frame throw and has a timepoint of 0 msec where the event marker was inserted as displayed in Figure 1.\nCorrect for baseline difference between the epochs by removing the average pre-stimulus baseline activity from each epoch (i.e., the 900 msec time window that runs from -900 msec to 0 msec prior to the event marker). This function can be selected or initiated from the data transformation options available in the EEG analysis software.Low-pass filter (30 Hz; 24 dB/octave) the epochs and reject any epochs with electrical artifacts that exceed +75V. Choose these setting from the available options in the EEG analysis software allowing the transformation of EEG data following data collection and vary depending on the specifications of the EEG software.\nAverage the neural responses together for each event type within the Cyberball task blocks.\n\tNOTE: This averaging process can be adapted to only average the first 20, middle 20, or even last 20 events of a similar type within each interaction to examine dynamic patterns of neural activation over the course of the social interaction13.\n\t\nCombine the various events types to create three major event categories: throws to the participant from either other player, throws from the participant to either other player, and throws not including the participant between the two other players. For example, combine throws from the human to the left player and to the right player into one average waveform.\nCombine the events from the computerized players into the event types of most interest: throws to the human participant (inclusionary) and throws away from the human participant (exclusionary).\nIf applicable, quantify the N2 component as the average amplitude in the discrete latency window running from 200 - 320 msec after the event marker at FCz.\nIf applicable, quantify the P3 component as the average amplitude in the discrete latency window running from 320 - 450 msec following the event marker at Pz.\nIf applicable, quantify ERP components to throw frames following the informational frame to examine ongoing differences among patterns of neural activity to different event types with the social interaction.\nSubscription Required.

The original design of the splint includes the use of a unique molecular identifier (UMI), which is not necessary for this experiment. However, it does increase potential uses for the construct, such as allowing for deduplication of reads as described in the original R2C2 protocol (Volden et\u00a0al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-bib-0017]).The original R2C2 methodology sequenced concatemerized full-length cDNA using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) technology, and the inclusion of the UMI in the splint allows for deduplication when sequencing a full concatemer with their existing pipeline. At the end of this reaction you should have full-length primers with the initial primer sequences removed via the Select-a-Size kit.\nMaterials\nQ5 High-Fidelity 2\u00d7 Master Mix (NEB cat. no.

Run an initial extension reaction with the following conditions:\n         \n95\u00b0C for 3 min\n98\u00b0C for 1 min\n62\u00b0C for 1 min\n72\u00b0C for 6 min\nCool to 4\u00b0C\n3. Using the Zymo Select-a-Size DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit add 85 \u00b5l EtOH to 500 \u00b5l DNA Binding Buffer and mix via pipetting.The amount of EtOH relative to the binding buffer is specific to the size of the fragment you want to purify. If you modify the size of the linker then the ethanol needs to be adjusted as well. Please refer to Zymo Select-a-Size DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit protocol (https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4080_select-a-size_dna_clean_concentrator.pdf[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4080_select-a-size_dna_clean_concentrator.pdf]) for instructions on how to adjust EtOH concentration for varying linker sizes.\n4. Bring the PCR reaction up to 100 \u00b5l with DNA elution buffer.\n5. Add the sample to the DNA binding buffer and mix thoroughly by pipetting.\n6. Transfer the mixture to a Zymo-Spin IC-S column in a collection tube. Centrifuge 30 s at 10,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, and discard the flow-through.\n7. Add 700 \u00b5l DNA wash buffer to the column and centrifuge 30 s at 10,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\n8. Add 200 \u00b5l DNA wash buffer to the column and centrifuge 60 s at 10,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube.\nIf you get any ethanol on the column or suspect any potential contamination, re-spin the column in the collection tube for 30 s at 10,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature.\n9. Transfer the column to an Eppendorf tube, add 10 \u00b5l DNA elution buffer directly to the column matrix and incubate for 1 minute at room temperature. Centrifuge 30 s at 10,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, to elute the DNA.\nBe sure not to disturb the column matrix when pipetting the elution buffer.\n10. Measure the final DNA concentration to ensure reaction success.If the reaction failed, you will observe a very low concentration of DNA. In our experience, successful reactions usually contained between 900 and 1100 ng of DNA, while failed reactions contained between 90 and 130 ng of DNA. We recommend using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) to measure total DNA to allow for better control of total splint added downstream.The goal of this step is to extract full-length RNA transcripts with as little breakage and degradation as possible. Although most RNA extraction methods will likely work for this protocol, we opted to use a commercial column extraction kit for several reasons. Primarily, we were concerned with obtaining intact full-length mRNA, as any breaks would appear as an artifact TSS within the gene body. To help facilitate the isolation of intact full-length mRNA, we used a rapid protocol that reduced the time in between RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. In addition, the on-column DNase I digestion allowed for easy degradation of genomic DNA, which causes artifacts when the poly-dT primer binds with natural poly-A tracts in genomic DNA. Finally, the TSRT requires very low RNA input levels and will fail if too much RNA is added to the reaction, so column purification provides more than enough RNA. While we do not know the exact RNA level that will stop working, we suggest not using over 400 ng of total input.Be sure that all reagents and materials used for RNA extraction are RNase-free. The easiest way to do this is to use dedicated reagents and disposable materials for all RNA protocols that are known to be RNase-free upon purchase, and keep those materials sealed when not in use to avoid contamination. It is advisable to use dedicated filter tips for all pipetting, and to thoroughly clean the workstation to remove RNase contamination. It is advisable to immediately continue on to cDNA generation after RNA extraction to avoid degradation, but we have generated high-quality libraries with RNA stored for up to one month at \u221280\u00b0C. This section mostly follows the \u201cTough-to-Lyse\u201d protocol provided by Monarch with minor specifications, additions, and commentary as we extracted RNA from plant tissue frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground in a mortar and pestle. Be sure to perform all initial preparatory steps outlined in the kit instructions. Very little tissue is required for this protocol, with successful libraries having been generated with as little as 40 pg of total RNA input.\nMaterials\nRNaseZap (Thermo Fisher cat. no. AM9780)\nLiquid nitrogen\nPlant sample\nMonarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (NEB cat. no. T2010S)\nQubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher cat. no.

Clean all surfaces and the mortar and pestle with RNaseZAP or another RNase decontamination solution.\nAvoiding RNase contamination with the sample is key to a successful experiment, be sure to decontaminate the workspace, gloves, and any tools that will contact the lysed sample with an RNase decontamination solution. As this protocol is designed to initially generate full-length cDNA, breaks in RNA may lead to artifacts in the final experiment.2. Pre-cool a mortar and pestle using liquid nitrogen. Place the plant sample into the mortar and slowly add liquid nitrogen. Grind the tissue into a fine powder for 3 min, adding more liquid nitrogen if necessary.\nOther methods of lysing the sample, such as a bead mill, will likely be successful as well. Ensuring that the sample remains as RNase-free as possible will increase the success of the reaction.\n3. Add the ground sample to 800 \u00b5l 1\u00d7 DNA/RNA protection reagent pre-cooled in an Eppendorf tube on ice and vortex to mix thoroughly.\nKeeping the sample cool from this point onward will improve RNA stability, decreasing potential artifacts and increasing experimental success. Variable amounts of total tissue input can be used, but it is advisable to keep your total tissue below 100 mg. Regardless of the total amount of tissue used, 800 \u00b5l of 1\u00d7 DNA/RNA protection reagent can be used.\n4. Spin 2 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, to pellet debris. Transfer supernatant to a pre-cooled gDNA removal column (light blue) fitted with a collection tube.\nThere is no reason to try and optimize the total RNA extracted from the sample in most cases, as smar2C2 libraries can be prepared with as little as 40 pg of total RNA. Be sure to not pipette any precipitate, as it is fine to leave a large amount of supernatant behind. 400 \u00b5l is sufficient for downstream applications, as after the addition of an equal volume of ethanol only 800 \u00b5l will be able to be added to the next column.\n5. Spin 30 s at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, to remove the genomic DNA.\nBe sure to save the flow-through in the collection tube, discarding the gDNA removal column.6. Add an equal volume of EtOH and mix thoroughly by pipetting (do not vortex).\n7. Transfer the mixture to a pre-cooled RNA purification column (dark blue) and collection tube. Spin 30 s at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature, and discard the flow-through.\n8. Add 500 \u00b5l of RNA wash buffer and spin 30 s at 16,000 \u00d7 \ng, room temperature, and discard flow-through.\n9. Combine 5 \u00b5l DNase I with 75 \u00b5l DNase I reaction buffer and pipet directly to the top of the column matrix. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nWhile the on-column DNase I digestion step is optional, we highly recommend performing this step. Even while performing a DNase I digestion we are able to occasionally see artifacts presumably from the poly-dT primer binding to poly-A tracts in the genomic DNA.\n10. Add 500 \u00b5l RNA priming buffer and spin 30 s at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\n11. Add 500 \u00b5l RNA wash buffer and spin for 30 s at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\n12. Add 500 \u00b5l RNA wash buffer and spin for 2 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\n13. Spin the column for 1 min at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature.\nWhile this step is optional, it is likely wise to ensure no ethanol contamination in the final elution\n14. Add 50 \u00b5l nuclease-free water directly to the center of the column matrix and spin for 30 s at 16,000 \u00d7 g, room temperature.\nThis volume can be adjusted anywhere between 30 and 100 \u00b5l\n15. Place the eluted RNA on ice.\nWhen dealing with RNA one of the best ways of improving experimental success is keeping your sample cool.16. Measure total RNA extracted using Qubit RNA Broad Range Assay Kit.\nA nanodrop or other similar RNA quantification test will likely provide enough accuracy for this application. We have found that the addition of too much RNA into the reverse transcription reaction can inhibit experimental success, making moderately accurate knowledge of input important. It is advisable to proceed directly to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-prot-0003], but if necessary RNA samples can be frozen at \u221220\u00b0C for use the next day or \u221280\u00b0C for more long term storage.The goal of this step is to generate the cDNA using the TSRT and then attach the TSO containing the adaptor to the additional C's deposited at the end of the first-strand cDNA transcript. TSRTs can introduce an error called strand invasion (Tang et\u00a0al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-bib-0015]) where the TSO binds with the first strand of cDNA before the reverse transcriptase has completed first-strand synthesis, usually at a site with sequence complementarity to the oligo. These artifacts can be removed bioinformatically, but methods should also be adjusted to attempt to reduce potential problems. We have opted to add a step where the poly-dT primer is annealed to the mRNA before the TSO is added. Continue to use RNase-free reagents and materials until after first-strand cDNA synthesis using the TSRT.\nMaterials\nSMARTScribe reverse transcriptase (Takara Bio cat. no. 639538)\n5\u00d7 first-strand buffer (Takara Bio cat. no. 639538)\n20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Takara Bio cat. no. 639538)\nTSO (100 \u00b5M) (see oligonucleotides list in recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-rec-0002])\nISPCR primer (10 \u00b5M) (see oligonucleotides list in recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-rec-0002])\nPoly-dT primer (10 \u00b5M) (see oligonucleotides list in recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-rec-0002])\nDeoxynucleotide (dNTP) solution mix (10 \u00b5M) (NEB cat. no.

The 10 min spent at 65\u00b0C is to allow for second-strand cDNA synthesis. The PCR amplification following should be done a minimal number of times. If duplicates become a problem downstream, four cycles of PCR are likely sufficient, though the effects of this have not been tested.\n7. Purify using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit with a 5:1 mixture of DNA binding buffer. Elute using 8 \u00b5l elution buffer.\nAny PCR cleanup commonly used is likely sufficient. Eluting into 8 \u00b5l allows for easy input into subsequent circularization reactions and conservation of circularization reagents but is not critical to the protocol. It is possible to pause after this step and store cDNA at 4\u00b0C for use in the near future or \u221220\u00b0C for more long-term storage.The goal of this step is to generate circular DNA from the cDNA fragments and amplify them into linear concatemers using rolling circle amplification. The phi29 polymerase used in this protocol is a high-fidelity DNA polymerase that is extremely processive and well suited to rolling circle amplification. Circularization and rolling circle amplification is what allows this protocol to generate fragments of DNA that contain the TSS. It contains the added benefit that once a fragment of DNA is circularized, any linear DNA is digested away using effective, inexpensive, and stable exonucleases. A wide variety of exonucleases that are specific to linear DNA ensure complete digestion of all non-circularized DNA, with exonuclease I showing preference for linear single strand DNA, exonuclease III showing preference for linear double stranded DNA, and lambda exonuclease showing preference for nicked and 5\u2032-phosphorylated double-stranded linear DNA post digestion, thus the library should only contain circular sequences generated using the sequence similarity present on the adaptors on the cDNA and the previously generated splint.\nMaterials\nNEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB cat. no.

Heating to 80\u00b0C for 20 min is to inactivate the nucleases to ensure no activity once linear DNA is generated via rolling circle amplification.\n5. Purify using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit with a 5:1 mixture of DNA binding buffer.

We have found that 4 hr have produced sufficient linear DNA for our needs, but if the yield is too low the reaction can be left running overnight.\n8. Purify using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit with a 5:1 mixture of DNA binding buffer. Elute using 18 \u00b5l elution buffer.\nWhile any DNA PCR cleanup method is likely sufficient for this step, we have encountered problems when using magnetic beads. Our beads tended to not stick well to the side of the tube when placed on the magnetic rack, forming a looser clump that protruded away from the side of the tube. This made it difficult to remove the reaction buffer and ethanol used in the cleanup and resulted in a significant loss of the sample.At this stage, long linear fragments of DNA need to be broken down into short fragments that can be sequenced, and sequencing adaptors need to be attached. Any protocol that is commonly used to sequence genomic DNA on Illumina sequencers will likely work at this stage. We have used Tn5 loaded with sequencing adaptors to generate libraries (with an equivalent product referenced in the materials) using a tagmentation protocol, but this is not critical to the success of the protocol.\nMaterials\nTn5 loaded with sequencing adaptors (Illumina cat. no. 20034197)\nTD buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-rec-0001])\nIllumina Nextera barcoded primers\nQ5\u00ae High-Fidelity 2\u00d7 Master Mix (NEB cat. no.

The study protocol was approved by the animal ethics committee of Nankai University.\n1. MPTP and L-DOPA administration\nNOTE: Ten-week-old female BALB/c mice were provided by the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Mice were housed six per cage under a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00-20:00), a constant temperature of 21-22 \u00b0C and a relative humidity of 55% \u00b1 5%. Autoclaved standard mice chow of the same formulation and water ad libitum was given to all animals.\nAfter one week of acclimatization, divide the animals into three groups of six mice each.\nTo Group 1, administer intraperitoneal injections (see step 1.5) of 250 \u00b5L/mouse/day of saline from day 1 to day 7 and then perform intragastric administration (see step 1.6) of 250 \u00b5L/mouse of saline on day 8.\nTo Group 2, administer intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg/day of MPTP every day from day 1 to day 7 and then perform intragastric administration of 250 \u00b5L/mouse of saline on day 8.\nTo Group 3, administer intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/kg/day of MPTP from day 1 to day 7 and then perform intragastric administration of 5 mg/kg of L-DOPA on day 8.\nPerform the intraperitoneal injection as follows.\n\t\nLoad the drug into a sterile 1 mL syringe with a 26 G needle. Eliminate air from the syringe.\nScruff the mouse with its belly facing up. Keep the head, neck and body of the mouse in a straight line as well with the head fixed.\nAngle the needle to penetrate the peritoneum. Push the needle for a proper distance until there is little resistance, and then inject the drug. Pull out the needle smoothly.\nPerform the intragastric administration as follows.Prepare the medication in a sterile 1 mL syringe with an oral-gavage needle. Eliminate air from the syringe.\nHold the mouse with its belly facing up. Keep the head, neck and body of the mouse in a straight line with the head fixed.\nKeep the needle parallel to the body of the mouse, and insert it from the corner of the mouse's mouth, pressing the tongue and pushing inward against the upper jaw.\nWith little resistance, which shows the needle is entering the esophagus smoothly, carefully push the needle in a proper distance. Before the tip of the needle reaches the bottom part of chest, inject the medication.\nPull out the needle smoothly.\n2. Cylinder test\nNOTE: The behavioral tests were performed on day 8. L-DOPA was injected to the third group of mice 40 min before the behavioral tests. If the behavioral testing is not done in the same room where the animals are housed, animals need to be acclimated to the new room for 30-60 min before test.\nPerform the test 24 h after the last dose of MPTP.\nPlace a transparent glass cylinder (height = 19.5 cm, diameter = 15 cm, weight \u22651 kg) at the center of a table. Surround the cylinder on three sides with black cardboard to reduce the effect of environmental lighting. Leave one side of the cylinder facing the camera for video recording.\n\tNOTE: The distance between the cardboard and cylinder should be about 4 to 8 cm.\nAttach a camera (> 1 million-pixel resolution) at ~40-60 cm away from the cylinder to ensure that the full cylinder is visible.\n\tNOTE: This is neither too near nor too far so as to not disturb the mouse while recording the video of its movement.Place one mouse into the cylinder at a time and start filming at once. Stop filming after 3 min.\n\tNOTE: During this process, try to avoid noise or light changes in order avoid influencing the mouse\u2019s behavior.\nPlace the mouse back into the home cage after testing.\nClean the cylinder with water and then spray 70% v/v ethanol over the inner wall to sanitize it and remove mouse scents. Wipe the cylinder dry before another mouse is placed into.\nPlay back the video at a rate of 0.5x the regular speed and count the number of paw lifts against the wall of each mouse.\n\tNOTE: Paw lifts occur when the mouse rears up on its hindlimbs, raises both forelimbs above shoulder level and lands. One forelimb lift is NOT counted. Usually, a mouse raises its forelimbs to touch the cylinder walls. If the mouse raises its forelimbs above shoulder level several times continuously without landing, it should be counted only as once.\n3. Open field test\nPerform the open field test 24 h after MPTP dosing.\n\tNOTE: It can be carried out at the same time of the cylinder test.\nPrepare a transparent open field reaction box (45 cm L x 45 cm W x 25 cm H) with a wooden plate cover at the bottom by a black cloth. Fix a camera (> 1 million-pixel resolution) over the field at a height of 1 m.\n\tNOTE: The color of open field box bottom should be different from the tested mouse color to ensure color contrast in the video.\nAdjust the camera to make sure that the open field reaction box is right in the center of the video.\nPut one test mouse into the box, and let the mouse familiarize itself with the environment for about 1 min.Record a 5 min video using the camera connected to the computer.\nAnalyze the video using software tools (e.g., MATLAB) to get the movement trace figure, the distribution of static (velocity <1 cm/s), walking (velocity 1-20 cm/s) and running (velocity >20 cm/s) time, the total traveled distance, and average speed of each tested mouse.\n\tNOTE: When analyzing the video, we track the whole body of the mouse. The average speed of a body means the total length of path covered, divided by the elapsed time. Therefore, if a mouse is not moving, its instantaneous velocity would be considered as zero.\nClean up any feces in the open field reaction box. Spray 70% ethanol on the box and wipe it.\nSubscription Required.

Collection of Scans and Clinical Data\nCollect brain CT or MRI scans of patients with ischemic stroke. Most scanners save the scans as DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files that can be copied to a hard disk or server.\nNOTE: Scans from every scanner type, scan protocol, and MRI field strength can be used, as long as 1) the time window requirements for the used scan type are met (see Table 1) and 2) there are no artifacts that hamper accurate infarct delineation. A detailed tutorial on artifact detection on CT and MRI is provided elsewhere23,24. An example of commonly occurring motion artifacts on CT is provided in Figure 2, and examples of scans of good quality are provided in the exemplar cases in the results section. Infarcts can be segmented on scans with any slice thickness and any in-plane image resolution. However, thin slices and high in-plane resolution will enable a more accurate representation of the infarct to the brain template.\nCollect the clinical variables in a data file (e.g., Excel) by making separate rows for each case and columns for each clinical variable. For infarct segmentation, include at least the variables date of stroke and date of imaging or a variable that indicates the time interval between stroke and imaging.\nEnsure that ethical guidelines and regulations regarding privacy are followed. Ensure that the data is either anonymized or coded. Pay specific attention to the removal of patient data such as name, address, and date of birth that are stored in the DICOM files as tags. These tags can be cleared using dcm2niix (free download available at <https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix>)25.\n2. Conversion of DICOM Images to Nifti FilesTo convert the DICOM images to uncompressed nifti files using the dcm2niix tool, type \"[folder path of dcm2niix.exe]\\dcm2niix %d_%p [folder path of dicom files]\" in the command prompt. An example of the command with the folders paths inserted could be C:\\users\\matthijs\\dcm2niix %d_%p C:\\users\\matthijs\\dicom\\. This command will run the dcm2niix executable, convert the DICOM images in the selected folder and save the nifti files in the same folder.\nNOTE: The addition %d_%p ensures that the series description and protocol name are inserted in the file name. Additional features including options for batch conversion are provided in the dcm2niix manual at <https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage>. Other open source tools can be used for the conversion of DICOM images to nifti files, as well.\nEnsure that the name of the scan type (CT, FLAIR, DWI, or other sequence names) is copied into the file name during conversion (this option is available in dcm2niix).\nFor MRI scans, select DWI or FLAIR sequences for segmentation. Alternatively, any other structural sequence on which the infarct is visible can be used. See Table 1 for appropriate time windows after stroke in which CT, DWI, or FLAIR can be used for infarct segmentation.\nOrganize the nifti files in a convenient folder structure with a subfolder for each case (see the manual of RegLSM and Supplementary Figure 1). This manual can be downloaded from <www.metavcimap.org/support/software-tools>.\nNOTE: This folder structure is a requirement for the registration software RegLSM (see section 4). An update of RegLSM, making it BIDS (brain imaging data structure26, see <http://bids.neuroimaging.io>) compatible, is currently being developed and will soon be released.\n3. Infarct Segmentation\nGeneral remarks applying to all scan types\nEnsure that the person who performs and evaluates segmentation and registration is blinded to the outcome variable (usually a cognitive measure) to avoid bias.Note that infarcts are usually segmented on transversal slices, but segmentation can be performed in any slice orientation.\nEnsure ideal viewing conditions during infarct segmentation by using a high-resolution monitor display and optimal ambient light to provide a comfortable setting. Manually adjust the image contrast during segmentation to provide optimal contrast between healthy brain tissue. Be consistent in applying similar settings across subjects.\nInfarct segmentation on CT\nFirst check whether the scan was performed at least 24 h after stroke symptom onset. Within 24 h, the acute infarct is not or only partially visible on CT and the scan cannot be used for segmentation7. See Figure 3 for an illustration.\nOpen the native CT using ITK-SNAP software (free download available at <www.itksnap.org>)27. In ITK-SNAP, click File | open main image from the dropdown menu. Click browse and select the file to open the scan. If the default contrast setting provides poor contrast between healthy brain tissue and the lesion, adjust the contrast settings. To do so, click Tools | image contrast | contrast adjustment.\nNOTE: Any open source software can also be used.\nIf available, open a CT that was performed within 24 h after stroke symptom onset in a separate instance as the reference to distinguish the acute infarct from old ischemic lesions such as lacunes, (sub)cortical infarcts, or white matter hyperintensities.\nIdentify the infarct based on the following characteristics. Infarcts have a low signal (i.e., hypodense) compared to normal brain tissue.\n\t\t\nIn the acute stage (first weeks), large infarcts can cause mass effect resulting in displacement of surrounding tissues, compression of ventricles, midline shift and obliteration of sulci. There can be hemorrhagic transformation which is visible as regions with high signal (i.e. hyperdens) within the infarct.In the chronic stage (months to years), the infarct will consist of a hypodens cavitated center (with a similar density as the cerebrospinal fluid) and a less hypodense rim which represents damaged brain tissue. Both the cavitated center and hypodens rim must be segmented as infarct. In case of large infarct, there can be ex vacuo enlargement of adjacent sulci or ventricles.\nNOTE: Tissue displacement due to mass effect or ex vacuo enlargement of structures should not be corrected for during segmentation (i.e., only the full extent of the infarct has to be segmented). Correction for tissue displacement takes place during the registration and subsequent steps.\nSegment the infarcted brain tissue using the paintbrush mode from the main toolbar (left-click to draw, right-click to erase). Alternatively, use the polygon mode to place anchor points at the borders of the lesion (these points are automatically connected with lines) or hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse over the borders of the lesion. Once all anchor points are connected, click accept to fill the delineated area.\nAvoid the fogging phase, which refers to the phase in which the infarct becomes isodense on CT (which co-occurs with infiltration of the infarcted tissue with phagocytes). This typically occurs 14-21 days after stroke onset, but in rare cases can occur even earlier28. During this period, the infarct can become invisible or its boundaries become less clear, making this stage unsuitable for infarct segmentation. After the fogging phase, the lesion becomes hypodense again when cavitation and gliosis occur. See Figure 4 for two examples.After finishing the segmentation, save it as a binary nifti file in the same folder as the scan by clicking segmentation | save segmentation image from the dropdown menu, then save the segmentation by giving it the exact same name as the segmented scan, with the extension of .lesion (e.g., if the scan was saved as \"ID001.CT.nii\", save the segmentation as \"ID001.CT.lesion.nii\").\nInfarct segmentation on DWI\nFirst check if the DWI was performed within 7 days of stroke onset. Infarcts are visible on DWI within several hours after stroke onset and their visibility on DWI gradually decreases after approximately 7 days (see paragraph 2 in the discussion for more details).\nOpen the DWI in ITK-SNAP (in the same way as done in step 3.2.2).\nNOTE: A DWI sequence generates at least two images for most scan protocols, one with a b-value = 0, which is a standard T2-weighted image, and one with a higher b-value, which is the scan that captures the actual diffusion properties of the tissue. The higher the b-value, the stronger the diffusion effects. For ischemic stroke detection, a b-value around 1000 s/mm2 is often used, as this provides a good contrast-to-noise ratio in most cases29. The image with a high b-value is used for infarct segmentation.\nOpen the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequence in a separate instance of ITK-SNAP for reference.\nIdentify and annotate the infarcted brain tissue based on the high signal (i.e., hyperintense) on DWI and low signal (i.e., hypointense) on the ADC (see Figure 5). ADC values in the infarct gradually increase until ADC normalizes on\u00a0average\u00a01 week after the stroke30, but in some cases, the ADC may already be (nearly) normalized after several days if there is much vasogenic edema.NOTE: In DWI images with low b-values, brain lesions with an intrinsic high T2 signal (such as white matter hyperintensities) can also appear hyperintense. This phenomenon is called T2 shine-through31. However, with increasing b-values, this phenomenon becomes less relevant, as the signal on the DWI image more strongly reflects diffusion properties instead of intrinsic T2 signal. With modern DWI scan protocols (usually with b-value=1000 or higher), the T2 shine-through effects are limited32.\nDo not mistake a high DWI signal near interfaces between air and either tissue or bone, which are a commonly observed artifact, for an infarct. See Figure 5.\nSave the annotation as a binary nifti file, giving it the exact same name as the segmented scan, with the extension of .lesion (in the same way as done in step 3.2.7).\nInfarct segmentation on FLAIR\nFirst, check if the scan was performed >48 h after stroke symptom onset. In the hyperacute stage, the infarct is usually not visible on the FLAIR sequence or the exact boundaries of the infarct are unclear31 (see Figure 6).\nOpen the FLAIR in ITK-SNAP in the same way as done in step 3.2.2.\nOpen the T1 a separate instance of ITK-SNAP for reference, if available.\nIdentify and segment the infarcted brain tissue based on the following characteristics.\n\t\t\nIn the acute stage (first few weeks), the infarct is visible as a more or less homogeneous hyperintense lesion, with or without apparent swelling and mass effect (Figure 5).\nIn the chronic stage (months to years), the infarct is cavitated, meaning the center becomes hypo- or isointense on FLAIR. This cavity can be most accurately identified on the T1. In most cases, the cavitated center is surrounded by a hyperintense rim on the FLAIR, representing gliosis.33.NOTE: However, there is a considerable amount of variation in the degree of cavitation and gliosis of chronic infarcts. Segment both the cavity and the hyperintense rim as infarcts (see step 3.2.5). A FLAIR hyperintense lesion is not always an infarct. In the acute stage, small subcortical infarcts can easily be distinguished from white matter hyperintensities or other chronic lesions such as lacunes of presumed vascular origin when there is a DWI available (see Figure 5). In the chronic stage, it can be more difficult. See paragraph 3 in the discussion for more information on how to discriminate these lesion types in the chronic stage.\nSave the annotation as a binary nifti file, giving it the exact same name as the segmented scan, with the extension of .lesion (in the same way as done in step 3.2.7).\ntable:\n\ufeff0,1,2,3,4\nScan type,Time window after stroke,Infarct properties,Reference scan,Pitfalls\nCT,>24 h,Acute: hypodense,-,- Fogging phase\nCT,>24 h,Chronic: hypodense cavity with CSF and less hypodense rim,-,- Hemorrhagic transformation\nDWI,<7 days,Hyperintense,ADC: typically hypointense,- T2 shinethrough\nDWI,<7 days,Hyperintense,ADC: typically hypointense,- High DWI signal near interfaces between air and bone/tissue\nFLAIR,>48 h,Acute: hyperintense,\"Acute: DWI/ADC, T1 (isointense or hypointense)\",- White matter hyperintensities\nFLAIR,>48 h,\"Chronic: hypointense or isointense (cavity), hyperintense rim\",Chronic: T1 (hypointense cavity with CSF characteristics).,- Lacunes\nTable 1: Summary of criteria for infarct segmentation for different scan types.\n4. Registration to Standard Space\nDownload RegLSM from <www.metavcimap.org/features/software-tools>4. Use this tool to process CT scans and any kind of MRI sequence. The registration procedure is illustrated in Figure 7.NOTE: Optional features in RegLSM include registration to an intermediate CT/MRI template that more closely resembles the scans of older patients with brain atrophy22. By default, the CT and MRI scan are registered to the MNI-152 template34, but this can be replaced by other templates if this better suits the study. Different registration schemes are illustrated in Figure 7. Other open source registration tools can also be used for this step.\nCheck 1) if the nifti files are not compressed, 2) that the file name of the segmented scan contains the term CT, FLAIR, or DWI, and 3) that the file name of the lesion annotation contains the same term with an appended \".lesion\". If these first three steps are followed, the data is fully prepared for registration and nothing needs to be changed.\nOpen MATLAB (version 2015a or higher), set the current folder to RegLSM (this folder can be downloaded from 35 (version 12 or higher, free download at <https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/>) by typing addpath {folder name of SPM}. Next, type RegLSM to open the GUI.\nSelect test mode in the registration dropdown menu to perform the registration for a single case. In the test mode panel, select the scan (CT, FLAIR, or DWI), annotation, and optionally the T1, using the open image button. Select the registration scheme: CT, FLAIR with or without T1, DWI with or without T1.\nAlternatively, select batch mode to register the scans of all cases in the selected folder in batch mode.\nEnsure that RegLSM saves the resulting registration parameters and the registered scans (including intermediate steps) and the registered lesion map in subfolders that are automatically generated. During this process, the registered scans and lesion maps are resampled to match the resolution (isotropic 1 mm3 voxels) and angulation of the MNI-152 template.5. Review Registration Results\nSelect the option check results in the RegLSM GUI and browse to the main folder with the registration results. The GUI will automatically select the registered scan with the registered lesion map, and the MNI-152 template with the registered lesion map in transverse, sagittal, and coronal orientations (see Figure 8).\nScroll through the registered scan and use the crosshair to check the alignment of the registered scan and the MNI-152 template. Pay specific attention to the alignment of recognizable anatomical landmarks such as the basal ganglia, ventricles, and skull.\nMark all failed registrations in a separate column in the data file (made in step 1.2) for the subsequent manual correction in section 6.\nNOTE: Common errors in the registration are imperfect alignment due to the mass effect caused by the lesion in the acute stage, or ex vacuo enlargement of ventricles in the chronic stage. See Figure 3 and Figure 5 for examples of such misalignment. Another common error is a misalignment of the tentorium cerebelli, in which case an occipital infarct can overlap with the cerebellum in the template. Misalignment of tissues that are not lesioned is not an issue when only the binary lesion maps are used in the subsequent lesion-symptom mapping analyses. In such cases, only the lesions need to be perfectly aligned.\n6. Manually Correct Registration Errors\nFor the lesion maps that need correction, open the MNI-152 T1 template in ITK-SNAP and select from the segmentation menu | open segmentation | registered lesion map, which is now overlaid on the template.\nOpen the registered brain scan in a separate instance of ITK-SNAP for reference.Correct the registered lesion map in ITK-SNAP for any type of misalignment that is mentioned in step 5.3 using the brush function to add voxels (left click) or remove voxels (right click). Carefully compare the registered scan and overlaid lesion map (see step 5.2) with the MNI-152 template and overlaid lesion map in ITK-SNAP (see step 6.1) to identify the regions of misalignment. See Figure 3 and Figure 5.\nAfter manually correcting lesion map in MNI space, perform a final check by comparing the segmented native scan of the patient with the corrected lesion map in MNI space (i.e., the results of step 6.3). Ensure that the corrected lesion map in MNI space now accurately represents the infarct in native space. Pay specific attention to the recognizable landmarks such as basal ganglia, ventricles, and skull (similar to step 5.2).\nSave the corrected lesion map in MNI space as a binary nifti file in the same folder as the uncorrected lesion map in MNI-152 space, giving it the exact same name as the uncorrected lesion map, with the extension of .corrected.\n7. Preparing Data for Lesion-symptom Mapping\nRename all the lesion maps. By default, RegLSM saved the lesion maps in a subfolder with the file name \"results\". Include the subject ID in the file name. In the case of manual correction, be sure to select and rename the corrected file.\nCopy all the lesion maps into a single folder.\nPerform a sanity check of the data by randomly selecting and inspecting several lesion maps in ITK-SNAP and compare these with the native scans to rule out systematic errors in data processing such as left-right flipping.Use MRIcron <https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron> to perform another sanity check of the data by creating a lesion overlap image to check if no lesions are located outside the brain template. Do this by selecting the draw dropdown menu | statistics | create overlap images.\nNOTE: The resulting lesion overlay map can be projected on the MNI-152 template and inspected using, for example, MRIcron or ITK-SNAP.\nThe lesion maps are now ready to be used for voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping or for calculation of infarct volumes within specific regions of interest using an atlas that is registered to the same standard space as the lesion maps (in this case, MNI-152 space for which many atlases are available, only a few of which are cited below36,37,38).\nSubscription Required.
