PR8 virus dissolved in 30 \u03bcl of PBS is pipetted onto the nostrils of heavily anesthetized mice.  Proper anesthesia can be visually confirmed by agonal breathing and usually requires about 5 minutes in an isoflurane chamber. Properly anesthetized mice will aspirate the fluid directly into their lungs.\r\n  \r\n\n\n2. Donor cell isolation and transplantation: At 9 days post-infection, isolate donor cells from a ubiquitously fluorophore-expressing mouse, following the Epithelial Cell Isolation protocol.  Ub-GFP and mTmG are particularly useful strains for this.  After sorting, donor cells are resuspended in 50ul sterile PBS.  Recipient mice receive cell solution intranasally, exactly as described above for influenza administration.  After transplantation, we\u2019ve observed that keeping mice in a nose cone with a flow of 100% oxygen can aid in recovery and decrease the chance of accidental death.  We observe engraftment using anywhere between 1,000 to 1 million donor cells.\r\n  \r\n\n\n3. Tissue Harvest: Endpoint analysis is performed at day 21 post-infection \\(or desired experimental endpoint). Mice are anesthetized and lungs perfused and lavaged three times with 1 ml PBS.  Lungs are inflated with about 0.75 mls of 4% PFA and tied off at the trachea, being careful not to overinflate.  Place lungs in an additional 20 ml of 4% PFA and rock at room temperature for 1 hour.  Decant PFA and rinse with PBS. Decant PBS and replace with fresh PBS and incubate 1-4 hours rocking at room temperature. This allows for the diffusion of remaining PFA inside the lungs to prevent over-fixation. Incubate in 30% sucrose in PBS + 0.02% azide at 4 degrees on a rocker overnight. The following day, decant sucrose solution and replace with 50% OCT / 15% sucrose / PBS for 2 hours at room temp. Pour out the lung and carefully dissect each lobe and trachea apart. Arrange the lungs and trachea in a cryomold containing 100% OCT and incubate on ice for 1 hour. Freeze entire cryomold in a dry ice alcohol bath.", "1. Grow D. melanogaster larvae at 18\u00b0C in fly bottles on standard fly food; use full grown, 3rd instar larvae for not more than two days from the start of their emergence.\r\n  2. Transfer several larvae to 35 mm Petri dishes with ~100 \u03bcl water; give heat-shock for transgene lac repressor expression if needed\n1\n, followed by 1-2 h recovery. \r\n  3. Place the Petri dish with larvae on ice for ~20 min to immobilize larvae. \r\n  4. Using fine-point forceps, dissect salivary glands in TB1 buffer\n8\non the glass slide with a 1.5 mm depression. Remove head parts and most fat body. Rinse glands with 20 \u03bcl Pipetman, adjusted to 7-8 \u03bcl volume, emerging the tip in the buffer prior to touching the glands. \r\n  5. Transfer glands with the same Pipetman tip to fixative on another slide with a well depression, fix exactly 2 min.\r\n  6. While the glands are being fixed, attach a 22 mm square coverslip to the center of a glass slide with a small amount \\(3-4 \u03bcl) of water.  \r\n  7. Dispose of the anterior pars of glands with the ducts and transfer \\(not more than one pair of glands per preparation) in exactly 7 \u03bcl of the fixative to the center of the coverslip, covering the preparation with an 18 mm square siliconized coverslip. \r\n  8. After transferring the glass slide to the bench surface, cover it with a\n25 mm wide strip of Whatman filter paper \\(0.2 mm thickness), taping a\n40 mm wide piece of clear plastic film \\(transparency, 3M) on top of it. \\(Fig. 1). \r\n  9. To spread the chromosomes, use a Dremel Flex-Shaft attachment inserting a soft plastic tip into the bit holder. Use tips that have 6-12 smooth, protruding knobs around the circumference of the tip edge \\(Fig. 1).  Tips can be constructed by cutting 200 \u03bcl Pipetman plastic tips close to the wide base, cutting triangular notches around the end circumference, and then lightly melting the cut tip end on a gas burner to form rounded, slightly protruding \\(\n1.5 mm) knobs. Using a manually held Dremel Flex-Shaft attachment rotating at\n200 rpm, apply the vibration to the preparation by slightly touching the plastic film covering the preparation with the knobbed rotating tip, positioned at ~45\u00b0 to the surface. Using spiral movements spread the chromosomes from the coverslip center towards its periphery, periodically removing the filter paper and film to monitor the progress using a phase contrast microscope. Continue this process for several minutes, until the chromosomes appear satisfactorily spread without much overlapping cell debris.\r\n  10. To remove excess fixative, start pressing the preparation lightly, gradually increasing the pressure.  Continue for several minutes, by sliding movements of the thumb over the area of the coverslip.  Finish the step by firm press with the thumb.  At this step, most of the excessive fixative has to be removed not to introduce a damaging hydraulic shock to the chromosomes in the vise. \r\n  11. Removing the filter paper and plastic film, cover the preparation with a strip of silicone-impregnated paper \\(0.12 mm thickness) of the same size as the slide \\(the siliconized side faces the coverslip) and place another glass slide on top of this.  After aligning the layers, place the glass slide sandwich in the center of an Avenger Gold toolmaker, tin coated, precision MTC-200-1 vise \\(Penn Tool:  Maplewood, NJ, \"http://www.penntoolco.com\":http://www.penntoolco.com), or comparable models with high surface parallelism.\r\n  12. Use a torque wrench to tighten the vise, always keeping the moving surfaces and tightening threads moderately oiled to maximize the smoothness of the operation.  Use at least two steps for pressing.  First, press the preparation lightly \\(up to 3 newton meters, as measured by a torque wrench) for 2 min to force out excess fixative and stabilize the preparation by reducing a hydraulic shock caused by outward liquid flow.  Gradually tighten the vise \\(up to 17 newton meters), maintaining the preparation at this pressure for ~1 min.  If well centered, the slides almost never cracked. \r\n  13. Gradually release the vise pressure and transfer the slide with the coverslips to liquid nitrogen for\n1 min. Flip the top, siliconized coverslip off with a razor blade, placing the slide with the remaining coverslip with preparation into 100% EtOH to thaw for\n20 sec before removal of the coverslip from the glass slide.  \r\n  14. Store coverslips within sealed 35 mm Petri dishes for up to one week in 100% EtOH at -20\u00b0C.\r\n  15. Proceed with FISH or immunostaining if planned, as suggested\n1\n. Buffers can be modified as suggested below \\(troubleshooting).  \r\n  16. For DNA staining use DAPI, 20 ng/ml in PBS \\(or other buffers; see troubleshooting below) 15-30 min.\r\n  17. Use fluorescence microscope to acquire one \\(best focused) optical section of the areas of interest.\r\n  18. Use Photoshop to minimally process the image \\(changing brightness and contrast and using \u201cunsharp mask\u201d filter to improve print quality).", "**Sampling of skin**\r\n\n\n1.

Prime the injection system multiple time.\r\n\n\n6. \\(Optional) Clean-up the ESI source of the MS instrument according to the manufacturer's\r\n  guidelines. Calibrate instruments using the calibration solution according to manufacturer's\r\n\n\nguideline. For the MaXis II QTOF, add the solution containing internal lockmass \\(m/z 922.009)\r\n\n\nin the ESI source in the positive ion mode, following the the manufacturer's guideline.\r\n\n\n7. Set up the MS method as follows: for the MaXis II QTOF MS, acquire spectra in positive ion\r\n  mode in the mass range of m/z 80\u00152,000 with the following settings: capillary voltage, 4,500\r\n\n\nV; ion source temperature, 180 \u0089; dry gas \u001dow, 9 L/min; spectra rate acquisition, 3 spectra/s.\r\n\n\nPerform MS/MS fragmentation of the seven most intense selected ions per spectrum \\(TOP7)\r\n\n\nusing ramped collision-induced dissociation \\(CID) energy, ranging from 16 to 48 eV, to get\r\n\n\ndiverse fragmentation patterns. Set MS/MS exclusion after 3 spectra to be released after 30 s.\r\n\n\nSet an MS/MS exclusion list for the mass range of m/z 921.5\u0015924.5 to exclude the lockmass, and\r\n\n\nif needed include other adducts of the lockmass if their intensities are in the range of MS/MS\r\n\n\nthreshold.\r\n\n\n8. Run a blank sample and verify that no signi\u001ccant contamination from source is impacting\r\n  the system by assessing abundances of observed ions and ensuring that they do not exceed\r\n\n\nthresholds appropriate for the instrument \\(e.g. below few thousand counts for the MaXis II\r\n\n\nQTOF instrument). If high abundance contaminants are present, consider additional source\r\n\n\ncleaning, replacement of mobile phases, glassware, LC column or tubing, as needed.\r\n\n\n9. \\(Optional, but recommended): Start by running the QC sample, followed by a blank, and\r\n  repeat it at least two times. Check for satisfactory reproducibility by comparing multiple QC\r\n\n\nsamples \\(coefficient of variation, CV, below 0.1-0.3). Check for carryover by inspecting the blank\r\n\n\nthat followed a QC sample. If needed, adjust the injection volume to prevent chromatographic\r\n\n\nsaturation \\(peak broadening), and mass spectrometer detector saturation \\(peak flattening). If\r\n\n\nneeded, optimize the LC gradient to ensure appropriate separation of representative features,\r\n\n\nand the number of needle/injector washes to reduce carry-over below 1%.\r\n\n\n10. Prepare the LC-MS sequence for the samples injections. Include the analysis of the blank and\r\n  the QC sample every 12 samples or less, depending on total number of samples. If possible, the\r\n\n\nsamples order should be randomized.\r\n\n\n11. \\(Optional): Include a clean-up sample every 12 samples to limit column saturation. This is\r\n  recommended if sample contains components that are strongly retained by the column and are\r\n\n\nnot eluted completely by the mobile phase. Typically, this clean-up run is composed of multiple\r\n\n\nmobile phase composition variation according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\r\n\n\n12. Run the LC-MS sequence, and monitor regularly that \\(i) elution pro\u001cle of every QC sample is\r\n  reproducible \\(5-10 sec window maximum for UHPLC, or a coefficient of variation of 0.1-0.3), and\r\n\n\n\\(ii) that the calibration is stable \\(< 10 ppm for MaXis II QTOF). If needed, stop the LC-MS\r\n\n\nsequence, and calibrate the instrument according to manufacturer guidelines. For the MaXis II\r\n\n\nQTOF, lock mass calibrant must be added every 12 hours. If the LC-MS sequence was stopped,\r\n\n\nrun a QC sample and a blank prior continuing the rest of your analysis.\r\n\n\n13. After \u001cnishing the LC-MS experiments, open representative \u001cles, from both the beginning and\r\n  the end of the sequence, with the MS data viewing software \\(Data Analysis for MaXis II QTOF).\r\n\n\nOverlap features across samples, such as the internal standard, and assess the stability of the\r\n\n\nchromatography \\(retention shift in seconds), and the MS calibration \\(m/z window in ppm).\r\n\n\n14. Export all LC-MS/MS \u001cles into the centroided .mzXML format. For the MaXis II QTOF MS,\r\n  use CompassXport to apply calibration, and convert the data from .d format to .mzXML format\r\n\n\nin centroid mode \\(select Filters: Peak Picking, MS-Levels 1-2).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n**Data analysis**\r\n\n\nCreating feature tables.
