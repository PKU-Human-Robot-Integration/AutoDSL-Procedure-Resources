    "1. Cell Line Revival and Maintenance\nRevive CHO cells in 9 ml CD-CHO medium supplemented with 8 mM L-Glutamine and 10 ml/L 100x hypoxanthine/thymidine supplement (complete growth medium).\nCentrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 10 ml of fresh complete growth medium.\nRemove a 1 ml sample and determine the viable cell concentration by light microscopy using the trypan blue dye exclusion method in a hemocytometer.\nInitiate a culture at a seeding density of 3 x 105 cells/ml in 125 ml shake flasks.\nMaintain the culture in an incubator at 37 °C, a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, on an orbital shaking platform rotating at 120 rpm.\nSubculture every 3-4 days in the complete growth medium at a seeding density of 2 x 105 cells/ml.\n2. Transfection of the Cell Line with the Plasmid Containing the Biosensor Gene\nPrepare plasmid DNA using a large-scale plasmid purification kit.\nMaintain cells at the appropriate conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2) 12-24 hr prior to transfection to ensure the cells are actively dividing at the time of transfection.\nCount the cells using the trypan blue dye exclusion method, then prepare a working volume of 20 ml of cell culture in a 125 ml shake flask at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml.\nUse a suitable transfection kit for the cell line in use. The plasmid DNA to transfection reagents ratio will be dependent on the cell line and vector. It is recommended that this is optimized by testing a range of ratios within the range specified by the manufacturer prior to conducting the final transfections. Also maintain at least one negative control culture containing the cells but no DNA.\nIncubate for 4 days in static mode and then transfer to a shaking platform rotating at 125 rpm.",
    "Add the appropriate antibiotic for plasmid selection to a suitable concentration as determined by a kill curve. In this study, zeocin was added to a final concentration of 400 μg/ml for selection of transfected cells.\nChange media at an appropriate time interval for the cell line, adding antibiotic each time, until cells in control well have died.\nUse the most confluent wells to progress to shaking cultures.\nEstablish a cell bank by freezing the cells in cryogenic vials containing 107 viable cells in 1 ml of freeze mix. In this work, this consists of 92.5% growth medium and 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide.\n3. Batch and Fed-batch Cell Growth Curve\nFollow instructions for cell maintenance above to establish triplicate cell cultures of the transfected CHO cells in 250 ml shake flasks with a working volume of 50 ml.\nMaintain the cultures in a humidified cell incubator at 37 °C, with 5% CO2, on an orbital shaking platform rotating at 125 rpm, and remove 4.1 ml samples from each growing culture at 24 hr intervals.\nUse 100 μl of the sample to determine the viable cell concentration and cell viability with the trypan blue dye exclusion method.\nRepeat until the viable cell concentration is reduced to zero.\nRepeat for the fed-batch cell cultures supplementing with the appropriate amount of glucose or glutamine on day 6 to restore their concentrations to their initial values of 36 mM and 4 mM, respectively. It is recommended that additional control cultures are also maintained, which are to be fed with the same volume (12 ml in this case) of pure water.\n4. FRET Ratio Measurements\nTake 2 ml of the daily samples removed in step 3.2 above and centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Resuspended the cell pellet in 2 ml of ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Transfer this into a 6-well plate and add a blank sample containing no cells to one well.\nMeasure the levels of blue and yellow fluorescence immediately at an excitation wavelength of 430/435 nm and emission wavelengths of 465/435 nm (blue) and 520/510 nm (yellow).\nCalculate the FRET ratios (ratio of yellow fluorescence detected over blue fluorescence detected).\n5. Metabolite Assays\nTake 2 ml of the daily samples removed in step 3.2 above and centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 3 ml ice cold PBS and centrifuge again at 100 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 3 ml ice cold PBS as above. Sonicate the sample 5x for 3 min each at a pulse of 15 sec on and 15 sec off. At this point, the cell extracts may be frozen if desired.\nUse an appropriate glucose assay kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions on samples of cell extracts to determine the intracellular glucose concentration (see table of materials).\n\tNote: Use appropriate standards to construct a standard curve. In this work, the concentration of standards ranged between 0-100 mM.\nUsing the readings for the standards, construct the standard curve and find the linear equation of best fit (in this case: y = 1310.51x - 723.43 where y is the absorbance reading and x is the glucose concentration).\nCalculate the glucose concentrations using the standard curve and taking the dilution into account. The intracellular glucose concentration can then be calculated using this equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51200/book_bg.png\n\tFor CHO cells, the single cell volume was calculated using a cell diameter of 12 μM 12.",
    "Use an appropriate glutamine assay kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions on samples of cell extracts to determine the intracellular glutamine concentration (see table of materials).\n\tNote: Use appropriate standards to construct a standard curve. In this work, the concentration of standards ranged between 0-2 mM.\nAs in 5.5 above, construct the calibration curve (in this case y = 203.1x + 17.1 where y is the absorbance reading and x is the glucose concentration)\nUsing the standard curve, calculate the glutamine concentration of the samples, taking the dilution into account. The intracellular glutamine concentration can be calculated using Equation 1 above.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
