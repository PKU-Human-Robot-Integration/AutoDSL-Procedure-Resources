    "The protocol content has been ethically approved by the Witten/Herdecke University Ethics Committee.\n1. Technical Requirements\nUtilize an echocardiography device featuring speckle tracking technology equipped with an adequate sector array tissue harmonic imaging transducer.\nDuring image acquisition, record and connect a standard 3-lead EKG directly to the echocardiography device in order to synchronize echocardiographic motion images to electromechanical activity. This is mandatory for timing purposes during subsequent postprocessing analyses. Connect the study subject to the EKG and unfreeze the ultrasound image to start detecting the EKG signal.\nRecord digital loops as explained in detail below (steps 2.1-2.5) and store the data as moving images in DICOM format on an external disk. Subsequently, transfer the files to an off-line workstation.\nPerform post-processing analyses using appropriate software as outlined in detail below (steps 3.1-3.13).\n2. Recording of Echocardiographic Digital Loops\nExamine the patient in the left lateral decubitus position (patient lying on the left side with the left arm stretched above the head).\n\tNOTE: This part of the protocol requires the patient/study subject to be present.\nAlternatively, when combining STE with stress echocardiography modalities such as a bicycle ergometer, ensure that the patient is in a 45-degree upright position. In this case, utilize a standard bicycle ergometry device and perform standard stress echocardiography testing as previously described11. During the recording of echocardiographic images, tilt the ergometer to achieve a left lateral body position in order to minimize artifacts by interfering lung tissue.\nTake special care to optimize image quality to guarantee accurate assessment of myocardial deformation. To do so, adjust the frame rate between 60 and 80 frames per second using the \"adjust frame rate\" option. Furthermore, pay attention to include all aspects of the myocardial structures that shall be analyzed throughout the entirety of the cardiac cycle.",
    "Obtain cross-sectional two-dimensional greyscale B-mode images in standard apical long axis and parasternal short axis planes as described by the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography12. Record several consecutive cardiac cycles (actually only one is necessary, recording of at least three cardiac cycles is advised in order to be able to choose the one with the best image quality during subsequent post processing) in each of the following planes:\n\t\nFor the assessment of longitudinal ε and SR, capture standard apical 4-, 3-, and 2-chamber views as previously described12. To do so, position the transducer at the apex of the heart near the apical impulse (usually between the 3rd and 5th intercostal space and between the mid-clavicular and anterior axillary line). Aim towards the right shoulder and angulate the transducer until all anatomical structures of interest become visible.\nRecord images in the parasternal short axis view at the level of the mitral valve, the papillary muscles and the apex to detect circumferential ε and SR as well as radial ε and SR as described elsewhere in detail12. To do so, place the probe at the left parasternal border at the 2nd or 3rd intercostal space and angulate until you obtain a cross-sectional perpendicular view of the LV.\nWhen combining STE with cardiac stress testing such as bicycle ergometry or any other functional testing modality requiring serial measurements (see step 2.2), repeat step 2.4 at each desired time point.\n3. Postprocessing Analysis\nNOTE: This part of the protocol includes the evaluation and interpretation of the recorded echocardiographic images. It does not require the patient to be present and can be performed at any time following the previous part of the procedure.",
    "Utilizing the quantitative echocardiography analysis software, click 'File' and 'Open' and chose the desired echocardiographic study data. Select a patient/study and pick an echocardiographic plane that shall be analyzed.\nClick the 'Q'-icon in the right lower corner of the selected image. Next, press the 'aCMQ' button on the left.\nChose the cardiac cycle of the highest image quality by using the green 'QRS' skip keys at the bottom of the screen. Use the keyboard space bar to play and pause the loop.\nSelect a region of interest (ROI) to be analyzed by confirming the echocardiographic view on the left side of the screen. Next, have the software automatically detect the timing of end-diastole and suggest a ROI.\n\tNOTE: A first speckle tracking analysis is subsequently being computed by the software. Segmental and global ε curves are displayed on the bottom of the screen.\nClick 'Strain rate' below the graphs to visualize segmental and global SR.\nVisually verify the tracking quality suggested by the software.\n\tNOTE: To do so, critically control whether all aspects of the myocardium to be analyzed are completely covered by the ROI during the entirety of the cardiac cycle. Avoid including surrounding non-myocardial tissues into the ROI.\nIf necessary, manually reposition the entire ROI or single aspects of it, or even re-draw the ROI completely (see 3.8-3.9) in order to guarantee exact measurements.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, set the ROI to be transparent to adjust the ROI coverage to the appropriate position and width of the myocardium.\nIn the apical 4-, 3-, and 2-chamber view, have the software automatically determine a possible ROI dividing the myocardium into seven segments.",
    "In case ROI re-definition is necessary, click 'Draw' on the left and start out tagging the endocardial border at three reference points: the two opposing insertion points of the AV valve and the LV wall starting with the basal infero-septal/ basal infero-lateral/basal inferior part of the valve finishing with the center of the apex. Ensure that both endpoints of the tracked-endocardium are on the same level completely excluding the valvular tissue.\nIf repositioning is necessary in order to optimize position and width of the ROI, click 'Edit' on the left side of the screen. Move each segment margin as well as the endocardial and epicardial borders individually with the cursor. Utilize an orthogonal line pointing towards the apex for navigation/orientation when moving the ROI in its entirety.\nFinally, start the speckle tracking re-analysis by pressing the 'Compute' button on the left side of the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: The software now automatically detects \"acoustic markers\", which deflect myocardial ultrastructures corresponding to myocardial fiber organization in their movement throughout the contraction and relaxation of the myocardium. These acoustic markers are traced through the entire duration of a complete cardiac cycle. The necessary calculation may take seconds to minutes. ε and SR are calculated by the software and presented in a numeric and graphic manner.\nIn the parasternal view, have the software automatically suggest a predefined ROI. Adjust this ROI manually, dividing the myocardium into six segments.\n\tNOTE: The width of the ROI, should exactly match the thickness of the myocardium. Where necessary, optimize position and width of the ROI as described in 3.8.2. A dot in the center of the ROI may be utilized for navigation/orientation when moving the ROI in its entirety.\n\t\nNext, start the speckle tracking re-analysis by pressing the 'Compute' button on the left side of the screen.",
    "Chose segmental and global ε and SR to be displayed in curves or the comprehensive bull's eye format. To do so, click the 'Preferences' button at the bottom left corner of the screen. Different types of waveforms and displaying options can be selected in this menu.\nIf manual repositioning of the ROI is not sufficient to achieve appropriate overall speckle tracking quality, start over from 3.1 and redefine the ROI or consider selecting a different cardiac cycle prior to continuing to the next step.\nSave and export the data for subsequent statistical analyses. If desired, cine loops or still frames can be exported as illustrations. To do so, click 'Export' at the bottom left corner of the screen and select the desired format and file directory.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
