    "Human esophageal cells are obtained from patients undergoing gastric or esophageal surgery. Informed consent is obtained for the tissue to be used for research purposes, and the tissue used anonymously under the appropriate ethical approvals (SSREC 165/03, Human Research Tissue Bank Licence 12179).\n1. Isolation of Human Esophageal Epithelial Cells\nWorking in a laminar flow tissue culture hood and using sterile technique, prepare the epithelial culture medium by mixing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and Ham’s F12 in a 3:1 ratio (v:v). Add 10% (v/v) FCS, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.4 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 1.8 x 10-4 M adenine, 5 µg/ml insulin, 5 µg/ml transferrin, 2 x 10-7 M triiodothyronine, 1 x 10-10 M cholera toxin, 2 x 10-3 M glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.625 µg/ml amphotericin B.\nUsing standard sterile techniques, put 11 ml of DMEM, 10% FCS, 2 x 10-3 M L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.625 µg/ml amphotericin B into a T75 tissue culture flask. Add 1 x 106 lethally irradiated mouse 3T3 fibroblasts12 in 1 ml of the same medium and incubate overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. This will produce a feeder layer for the subsequent culture of epithelial cells.\nUsing a scalpel and following the recommendations of a histopathologist, dissect an approximately 2 cm2 sample of tissue from the disease-free background region of esophageal squamous mucosa obtained from patients undergoing gastric or esophageal surgery. Transport to the laboratory in a 50 ml container of sterile transport medium (PBS 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 0.625 µg/ml amphotericin B) at room temperature.",
    "At this point, store the tissue in the transport medium for up to 12 hr (overnight) at 4 °C, for convenience; however do not use longer storage periods as they result in reduced cell viability.\nWorking in a laminar flow tissue culture hood and using sterile technique, sterilize a scalpel blade by soaking in 70% ethanol for 5 min. Rinse in sterile PBS.\nPlace the tissue in a sterile Petri dish and use the scalpel to cut it into 0.5 cm strips. Add 5 ml of 0.1% (w/v) trypsin in PBS to the Petri dish, place the lid on the dish and incubate for 1 hr at 37 °C.\nAdd 5 ml of FCS to the tissue in the Petri dish to inhibit the trypsin. Holding the strip of tissue with sterile forceps, gently scrape the epithelial surface with the scalpel blade for 1-2 min per strip to remove the epithelial cells into the surrounding medium. Remove the scraped tissue and set aside. Repeat the process for all the tissue strips.\nCollect the medium containing the detached epithelial cells into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge (5 min, 200 x g). Pour off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 12 ml of epithelial medium (described in step 1.1).\nPour off and discard the medium from the feeder cell layer in the T75 flask prepared in step 1.2. Use a sterile pipette to add the cell suspension containing the freshly isolated epithelial cells to the flask and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere.",
    "After 24 hr pour off and discard the culture medium, which will also contain cell debris, and replace with 12 ml of fresh epithelial medium. Continue incubating at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. Colonies will start to appear over the next 24 to 48 hr and can be viewed by placing the culture flask under a standard light microscope. Pour off the spent culture medium and replace with an equal volume of fresh medium every 2 to 3 days.\nOnce the flask has reached 80% confluency, passage the cells13. Split the cells in a ratio of 1:5 to increase cell numbers for use in the model. Follow step 1.2 to establish feeder layers of irradiated 3T3 cells in each flask that will be receiving epithelial cells 24 hr prior to passaging the cells.\n\tNote: Use the epithelial cells in the esophageal model described below between passages 1 and 4 only.\n2. Isolation of Human Esophageal Fibroblasts\nWorking in a laminar flow cabinet and using sterile technique, take the tissue set aside in step 1.7. Place in a sterile Petri dish and mince finely by chopping with a sterile scalpel blade. Add 10 ml of 0.5% (w/v) collagenase A solution and place the lid on the Petri dish and incubate at 37 °C overnight in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere.\nTransfer the digest to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge (10 min, 200 x g), carefully pour off and discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of fibroblast culture medium (DMEM 10% FCS, 2 x 10-3 M L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.625 µg/ml amphotericin B).",
    "Place the suspension into a T75 flask and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. After 24 hr pour off the medium, which will contain debris and replace with 12 ml of fresh fibroblast medium. Replace the culture medium every 2 to 3 days and passage cells once they have reached 80% confluency13, splitting the cells in a 1:5 ratio to increase cell numbers.\n\tNote: Use the fibroblast cells in the model described below between passages 4 and 10 only.\n3. Preparation of the De-cellularized Esophageal Scaffold\nObtain intact porcine esophagi at an abattoir from freshly slaughtered Landrace pigs that are used for food production. One single esophagus will provide sufficient scaffolds for approximately 30 separate constructs.\n\tNote: Due to the extensive and time consuming sterilization protocol required, it is normally worth obtaining and processing a minimum of 10 esophagi at one time.\nImmediately place the freshly excised esophagus into a 180 ml sterile pot containing approximately 150 ml of 10% povidone-iodine solution for 5 min to reduce any contaminating microbial load. Transfer the esophagus to a second pot containing approximately 100 ml of sterile PBS containing 200 IU/ml penicillin, 200 µg/ml streptomycin, and 1.25 µg/ml amphotericin B.\n\t\nReplace the lid on the container and transport the esophagi back to the laboratory at room temperature. Two or three esophagi can be transported in each container, depending upon their size.\nOnce at the laboratory, handle the tissue in a laminar flow hood using aseptic technique to minimize microbial contamination. Sterilize tweezers, scissors and scalpel blades by soaking for 5 min in 70% ethanol, and rinsing in sterile PBS.",
    "Handle the esophagus using sterile tweezers. Using the scissors, cut open the esophagus longitudinally. Rinse the tissue by placing the esophagus into a 180 ml sterile pot containing approximately 100 ml of sterile PBS and shaking gently to remove any debris.\nClean a cork dissection board by spraying liberally with 70% ethanol and allow to dry.\nRemove the esophagus from the PBS, and using sterile needles, pin out the esophagus onto the board, mucosal surface uppermost. Grasp the mucosal surface at one end of the esophagus with sterile tweezers and pull away from the board. This will separate the mucosa from the underlying submucosa.\n\t\nThen, use a sterile scalpel blade to dissect the esophagus longitudinally along the lamina propria, removing pins as the dissection progresses to allow the mucosa to be lifted away.\nRetain the dissected mucosa and discard the underlying submucosa.\nCut off and discard the most proximal and distal 2 cm of the mucosa as there is a greater number of submucosal glands and a thicker lamina propria in those areas, respectively7.\nUse a scalpel to cut the remaining tissue into 5 cm2. Place all the cut tissue into a 180 ml sterile pot containing approximately 150 ml of sterile PBS and agitate gently to rinse the tissue. If processing more than five esophagi at one time it may be necessary to use multiple pots for this and the three subsequent steps.\nUsing sterile tweezers, transfer the cut tissue into a 180 ml pot containing 150 ml of sterile 1 M NaCl, 200 IU/ml penicillin, 200 µg/ml streptomycin and 1.25 µg/ml amphotericin B. Incubate for 72 hr at 37 °C.",
    "Place the tissue into a fresh 180 ml pot containing 150 ml sterile PBS. The epithelium will have begun to visibly separate from the underlying tissue. Gently peel the detaching epithelium from the pig esophagus using sterile forceps and discard.\n\t\nPlace the remaining tissue into a fresh 180 ml pot and add 150 ml of sterile PBS. Agitate gently for 5 min to wash. Pour off the PBS and repeat a further two times with fresh PBS.\nPlace all the tissue into a 500 ml glass bottle containing 400 ml of sterile 80% (v/v) glycerol solution for 24 hr at room temperature. Transfer to 400 ml of sterile 90% (v/v) glycerol solution for a further 24 hr.\nStore in 400 ml of sterile 100% glycerol solution at room temperature for a minimum of 4 months to dehydrate and sterilize the tissue while preserving the integrity of the basement membrane.\n4. Production of the Culture Media\nPrepare chelated newborn calf serum for use in the culture medium.\n\t\nPour 100 g of Chelex 100 into a glass 1 L bottle and add de-ionized water. The exact volume is not critical but sufficient water must be added to cover the Chelex powder. Add a magnetic stirrer and sterilize by autoclaving (121 °C for 15 min).\nAllow the bottle to cool and the Chelex to settle. In a laminar flow cabinet pour off the excess water, add 500 ml of newborn calf serum (NCS) and leave to stir overnight at 4 °C.\nStop stirring and allow the Chelex to settle, this can take up to 30 min. In a laminar flow cabinet decant the chelated serum using a sterile pipette, taking care not to disturb the Chelex, and store in 10 ml aliquots at -20 °C.",
    "Prepare three different media in a laminar flow cabinet, commencing with pro-proliferative and ending with pro-differentiative formulations.\n\t\nPrepare Composite Medium I comprised of DMEM and Hams F12 in a 3:1 ratio (v:v), 4 x 10-3 M L-glutamine, 0.5 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 x 10-4 M O-phosphorylethanolamine, 2 x 10-12 M triiodothyronine, 1.8 x 10-4 M adenine, 1.88 x 10-3 M CaCl2, 4 x 10-12 M progesterone, 10 µg/ml insulin, 10 µg/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml selenium, 1 x 10-3 M ethanolamine and 0.1% (v/v) chelated NCS.\nPrepare Composite Medium II as Composite Medium I except replace chelated serum with 0.1% (v/v) non-chelated NCS.\nPrepare Composite Medium III as Composite Medium II except omit progesterone and increase serum to 2% (v/v) non-chelated NCS.\n5. Production of the Human Esophageal Mucosa Model\nPerform all work in a laminar flow hood, using aseptic technique to maintain a sterile environment. Sterilize all tools by soaking in 70% ethanol for 5 min, before rinsing in sterile PBS.\nThe day before it is required, rehydrate the acellular porcine esophageal scaffold. One piece of scaffold is required for each construct to be prepared.\n\t\nTo rehydrate the tissue place sufficient pieces of porcine scaffold into a pot containing 100 ml of sterile PBS, agitate and soak for 10 min. Decant the PBS and replace with fresh PBS. Repeat the washing process five times to ensure removal of all glycerol traces.\nTest the scaffold sterility by incubating the rehydrated tissue overnight in 100 ml of DMEM at 37 °C. If there is no change to the color or turbidity of the culture medium at the end of the incubation period the scaffold is assumed to be sterile. Once sterility has been confirmed, place the 5 cm2 acellular scaffold into a 6 well plate, submucosal side uppermost.",
    "Place a sterile medical grade stainless steel ring (internal diameter 10 mm, external diameter 20 mm) onto the center of each scaffold and gently press down using sterile forceps, to ensure an adequate seal with the tissue.\nHarvest the fibroblasts using Trypsin-EDTA13 to produce a cell suspension. Count the cells using a haemocytometer14. Centrifuge the cell suspension (10 min, 200 x g). Resuspend the cell pellet into an appropriate volume of fibroblast medium to produce a final cell count of 2.5 x 106 cells per ml.\nAdd 0.2 ml of fibroblast medium, containing 5 x 105 human esophageal fibroblasts, within each ring. Flood the area around the outside of the ring with approximately 2 ml of fibroblast medium. Incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere.\nAfter 24 hr remove the rings and fibroblast medium and add at least 5 ml of fresh fibroblast medium to each well, ensuring that the scaffold is totally immersed in medium. Culture for 1 week, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere replacing the medium every 2 to 3 days.\nAfter 1 week remove the 6 well plates containing the scaffolds to a laminar flood hood, remove the medium and invert each scaffold using sterile forceps, placing the mucosal surface uppermost. This time point is referred to as Day 0.\nPlace the steel rings on the mucosal surface in the center of the tissue as in step 5.4.\nPrepare the T75 flasks of epithelial cells for trypsinization13. After the PBS wash and prior to the addition of trypsin-EDTA solution, add 2 ml of sterile 0.02% (w/v) EDTA solution to each flask. Incubate for 2 min at 37 °C. Tap the flask gently to selectively detach the i3T3 feeder layer while leaving the epithelial cells attached.",
    "Note: It is generally not practical or necessary to patient match the epithelial cells to the fibroblasts already incorporated in the model the previous week.\nPour off the EDTA solution containing the feeder layer and add trypsin-EDTA solution to harvest the epithelial cells13. Count the cells using a haemocytometer14. Centrifuge the cell suspension (10 min, 200 x g). Resuspend the cell pellet into an appropriate volume of Composite Medium 1 to produce a final cell count of 5 x 106 cells per ml.\nAdd 0.2 ml of Composite Medium I, containing 1 x 106 epithelial cells, within the ring. Flood the area around the outside of the ring with approximately 2 ml of Composite Medium I and place the constructs into the incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere.\nAfter 24 hr (Day 1) remove the rings and medium and add at least 5 ml of fresh Composite Medium I, ensuring the scaffolds are fully submerged and return to the incubator. After a further 24 hr (Day 2) remove the medium and replaced with at least 5 ml of Composite Medium II, again ensuring the scaffolds are fully submerged and return to the incubator.\nOn Day 4 place sterile medical grade stainless steel mesh grids (2 cm wide x 2 cm long x 0.5 cm high), into fresh 6 well plates, one per construct. Use sterile tweezers to transfer the constructs onto the top of the steel grids, mucosal surface uppermost.",
    "Add sufficient Composite Medium III so that the liquid reaches the underside of the composite, but the surface is exposed to the air, this ensures that the sample is maintained at an air-liquid interface. The exact volume of medium required will vary depending upon the thickness of the scaffold, the volume of the well and the precise height of the stainless steel grid.\nMaintain the composites at an air-liquid interface for between 10 and 20 days (Day 14 to Day 24), depending upon the requirements of the experiment. Replace the Composite Medium III with fresh medium every 2 to 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday is a user-friendly regime).\n\tNote: After 5 days at an air-liquid interface (Day 9) the constructs have a sufficiently mature esophageal epithelium to be used in experiments of the impact of environmental factors on the esophageal epithelium.\nAt the end of the experiment, fix the constructs for histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining7, or extract protein15 or RNA11,16 from the epithelium for further analysis. If required, retain the conditioned culture medium for analysis of extracellular signaling molecules17.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
