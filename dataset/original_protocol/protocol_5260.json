    "Ethical statement: Adult female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (225-250 g) were used in this protocol. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animals Committee of Taipei Veterans General Hospital (permit numbers IACUC 2014-137 and IACUC 2015-253) and were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals outlined by the National Institutes of Health.    All instruments (toothed forceps, tip, clamps, retractor, needle holder, scalpel handle and scissors) that touch the inside of the wound must be sterilized using the dry sterilizer.   Set up the PC and start the impactor program.   Place the rat into the induction chamber.   Turn on the airflow (1-1.5 L/min with isoflurane 5%) and then monitor the rat until recumbent.   Move the anesthetized rat from the chamber to the mask of anesthesia system and set the level of isoflurane to 1.5-2%.   Maintain the rat’s core body temperature at 36-37 °C on a warming pad with an electrical temperature controller of the rectal probe.   Shave the thoracic area and apply the povidone-iodine solution on the shaved area.   Use the scalpel to make a longitudinal incision on the dorsal thoracic surface and dissect the paraspinal muscle to expose the vertebrae T7-T12. Note: The spinous process of T2 is longer than any of the others. Touch the position of T2 under the skin to determine the approximate position for operation with your finger (Figure 1A).   Use the retractor to gently pull the paravertebral muscles away from the spines. The laminectomy is performed with a Zeiss operating microscope (under 7.5x magnification). Cut and remove the bones of T8, T9 and partial T10 with the bone cutter and toothed forceps. This will expose the dorsal surface of the spinal cord without disrupting the dura.",
    "(Figure 1B) Note: To avoid hitting the vertebral bone with the tip of impactor, the bone must be removed to obtain more than 2.5 mm width because the diameter of the impactor tip is 2.5 mm.   Two stabilization clamps are used to immobilize the posterior spinous processes of the vertebrae T7 and T12 and to support the vertebral column during contusion.   Place the rat with the center of T8-T10 spinal cord under the tip (Figures 1C). The ground alligator of the impactor is placed on the muscle to form an electrical conductance between the tip and the spinal cord. Note: Using the toothed forceps push the middle of the clamped vertebral bone slightly in order to ensure the vertebral bone is clamped well and is stable (Figure 1D).   Place the tip at 0 mm and then lower down the rod to let the tip touch the dura of the spinal cord (Figure 1E, Left). When the tip touches the dura, the black box of the impactor will produce light and make a buzzing sound (Figure 1E, Right).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170616/20170616024441_0477.jpg Figure 1. Laminectomy, impact site and animal care. A. The approximate positions of the 2nd thoracic spine (T2, black circle) and the 9th thoracic spine (white circle) shown on the dorsal thoracic surface. B. The spinal cord has been exposed by a T8-T10 laminectomy before contusion (white circles are vertebral locations). C. The rat placed at the center of the rod and the clamps was immobilized to show the spinous processes of the vertebrae T7 and T12. D. The toothed forceps pushed the middle of clamped vertebral bone slightly in order to ensure the vertebral bone is clamped well and stable. E.",
    "The tip was placed at 0 mm by an inserted pin; the tip can be raised up and held at specific heights (6.25, 12.5, 25 or 50 mm; Left). When the tip touches the dura, the black box of the impactor will produce light and buzzing sound (Right). F. The site of spinal cord with subdural hemorrhage on the T9 vertebral position after contused. G. The muscle was continuously closed with chromic catgut (Left), and the skin was interrupted suturing with nylon suture (Right). H. Holding the rat with one hand and gently squeezing the bladder on the lower abdomen with the thumb and first two fingers of the other hand.    Raise the rod and hold the tip by the inserted pin at specific heights (included 6.25, 12.5, 25 or 50 mm). Manually pull the inserted pin to let the rod fall onto the exposed dura by gravity at T9 to produce a contusion injury. Note: The parameters for the impactor that can be recorded by the software are: impact velocity (Vi), cord compression distance (Cd), time (Ct), and rate (Cr = Cd/Ct). For instance, the impact velocity from a 50 mm height should be achieved in 0.98 m/sec. The compression distance should be around 2-3 mm by software display, if it is greater than 3 mm, that means the spinal cord is not clamped well. The Ct presents the time required for the rod to compress the spinal cord to the deepest point.   After contused, the subdural hemorrhage can be seen clearly under dura (Figure 1F).   Raise the tip and release the clamps gently from the vertebral column.   The wound is continuously closed with chromic catgut (4/0) for muscle, and interrupted suturing with nylon suture (3/0) for skin (Figure 1G).",
    "Turn off the anesthesia system and then place the rat back to the cage which is on the heating pad. Note: The entire procedure takes about 1 h, and the rat should be woken up within 10-20 min after removing the isoflurane. Slightly press the paw of the rat, the reflex action of hind limb should not be present 24 h after SCI. In our experience, the mortality rate of rat is under 5%.   Monitor the rat and provide post-operative care by daily observation for signs of distress including weight loss, dehydration and bladder dysfunction. Provide 3 ml of sterile 0.9% saline subcutaneously for rehydration. Prophylactic antibiotics (Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibacterial injectable solution, 1:30 diluted in 0.9% normal saline, 2 ml/kg) are injected subcutaneously daily in 5 days post-surgery. The analgesic acetaminophen (65 mg/kg) is orally delivered if the rat shows the sign of self-mutilation. In addition, if the rat shows serious foot damage, we usually discard the rat.   The rat is taken care of in a conventional animal house and maintained at a 12-h light-dark cycle. Manual emptying of the rat’s bladder is performed twice daily by squeezing the lower abdomen (Figure 1H). Note: Most rats show hematuria at 1-3 days after contused. If bloody urine does not empty well or a large residual volume of urine is left in the bladder after SCI, it might cause cystitis, infection, and even death."
