    "1. Pre-growth, DSB induction, and sample collection\nNOTE: Supplementation of all media with 0.01% adenine is recommended for Ade- strains.\nStreak out the appropriate haploid strains (see Table 1) on yeast peptone dextrose adenine (YPDA) (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 2% agar, 0.001% adenine) and grow for 2 days at 30 °C.\nUse a single colony to inoculate 5 mL of YPDA in a 15 mL glass culture tube. Grow cultures to saturation at 30 °C with shaking or rotation for aeration.\nDLC assay: Prepare the 5x psoralen stock solution (0.5 mg/mL trioxsalen in 200-proof ethanol) in a fume hood by dissolving psoralen in a 50 mL conical tube wrapped in aluminum foil overnight at room temperature with continuous shaking or inversion. Seal screw top with a transparent film to prevent evaporation. Do not prepare more than 7 mL of 5x psoralen stock solution per 50 mL conical tube to ensure proper dissolution of the psoralen.\nThe next day, use 5 mL of the YPDA grown overnight culture to inoculate 50-100 mL of YEP-lactate (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% w/w lactate, 0.001% adenine) in an appropriately sized flask (budding yeast grows optimally in a flask that is at least 5x the volume of the culture) to an OD600 of ~0.03.\nGrow the culture for ~16 h at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. After ~16 h, measure the OD600 of the culture and it should be ~0.5-0.8. Do not use under- or overgrown cultures.",
    "For each time point, collect the appropriate volume of cells in a conical tube and place on ice. Typically, this is 1 x 108 cells (approximately 7.5 mL of culture at OD600 1.0 for a haploid wild type strain) for the DLC assay and 5 x 107 cells (approximately 2.5 mL of culture at OD600 1.0) for the DLE assay.\nTo ensure the accuracy of the OD600 values, prepare 1:5 dilutions for cultures with an OD600≥0.2 to keep the OD reading at 0.2 or below. For wild type strains, optimal time points for DLC analysis are between 2 h and 6 h, and optimal time points for DLE analysis are between 4 h and 8 h (see Figure 3 and Figure 4).\nDLC assay\n\t\nBefore each time point, prepare enough 1x psoralen solution (0.1 mg/mL trioxsalen, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 20% ethanol) in a fume hood for all the samples in a 50 mL conical tube wrapped in foil. Leave at RT.\nCentrifuge the samples at 2,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet in 2.5 mL of 1x psoralen solution in a fume hood and transfer to a 60 mm x 15 mm Petri dish. Alternatively, resuspend the pellet in 2.5 mL of TE1 solution (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA pH 8.0) for a no-crosslinking control.\nCrosslink the samples. For a UV crosslinker fit with long-wave (365 nm) bulbs, position the Petri dishes 1-2 cm below the UV light source with the lid removed atop a plastic or plexiglass plate that has been pre-chilled at −20° C. For a UV light box, place the Petri dishes directly atop the UV light source. Expose the samples for 10 min with gentle shaking.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to set the UV light source atop an orbital shaker set at ~50 rpm.\nIn a fume hood, transfer the sample into a new 15 mL tube. Rinse the Petri dish with 2.5 mL of TE1 solution and add this to the tube. Centrifuge the samples at 2,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, properly dispose of the supernatant, and store the pellet at −20° C. Samples can be stored for up to 1 week before moving to the next step.\nDLE assay\n\t\nCentrifuge the samples at 2,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Wash the cell pellet in 2.5 mL of cold TE1 solution before repeating the spin and storing the pellets at −20 °C. Samples can be stored for up to 1 week before moving to the next step.\nFor sample collection at 0 h, collect the samples prior to the addition of 20% galactose. For subsequent timepoints, induce DSB formation by adding 20% galactose to the cultures to a final concentration of 2%. Collect the remaining samples as described above, pellet, and freeze relative to the time post-DSB induction (i.e., the 4 h sample is collected 4 h after the addition of 20% galactose).\n2. Cell spheroplasting, lysis, and restriction site restoration\nThaw the samples on ice. Preheat a dry bath to 30 °C.\nResuspend the samples in 1 mL of spheroplasting buffer (0.4 M sorbitol, 0.4 M KCl, 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 0.5 mM MgCl2) and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Add 3.5 µL of zymolyase solution (2% glucose, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mg/mL zymolyase 100T; 17.5 µg/mL zymolyase final concentration). Mix gently by tapping or inversion. Incubate at 30 °C for 15 min, and then place on ice. During the 15 min incubation, obtain liquid nitrogen or dry ice.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 2,500 x g at 4 °C and place the samples on ice. Wash the samples 3x in 1 mL of spheroplasting buffer. Centrifuge the samples for 3 min at 2,500 x g at 4 °C.\nResuspend the samples in 1 mL of cold 1x restriction enzyme buffer (50 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM Tris-acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 100 µg/mL BSA pH ~8.0 at RT) and centrifuge for 3 min at 16,000 x g at 4 °C. Place the samples on ice. Repeat the wash 1x.\nResuspend the samples in 1 mL of cold 1x restriction enzyme buffer. Split the sample (0.5 mL each) into two 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the samples for 3 min at 16,000 x g at 4 °C.\nResuspend one tube from each sample in 180 µL of 1.4x restriction enzyme buffer with hybridizing oligos (see Table 2) and one tube in 180 µL of 1.4x restriction enzyme buffer without hybridizing oligos. Each hybridizing oligo is resuspended in 1x TE (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) and used at a final concentration of 7 nM. The 1x TE replaces the hybridizing oligos in the 1.4x restriction enzyme buffer without hybridizing oligos.\n\tNOTE: The hybridizing oligos must be stored at −20 °C in small aliquots at the working dilution. The concentration of the hybridizing oligos may require optimization; see Discussion.",
    "Snap freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen or dry ice/ethanol and store at −80 °C. Samples can be stored at this stage for several months.\n3. Restriction enzyme digest and intramolecular ligation\nThaw the samples on ice. Preheat one dry bath to 65 °C and another to 37 °C.\nPipet 36 µL of the sample into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice. Promptly return the remaining sample to −80 °C for storage.\nAdd 4 µL of 1% SDS (0.1% final concentration) and mix by gently tapping the side of the tube. Incubate at 65 °C for 15 min with gentle tapping every 5 min. Place samples on ice immediately following the incubation.\n\tNOTE: This SDS treatment promotes the denaturation of DNA-associated proteins, solubilization of the nuclear envelope, and chromatin accessibility in advance of the restriction enzyme digest and intramolecular ligation steps.\nAdd 4.5 µL of 10% Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) and mix by pipetting. Add 20-50 U of restriction enzyme (EcoRI-HF or HindIII-HF) to each sample and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation every 20-30 min. During this time, preheat a dry bath to 55 °C and preset a water bath to 16 °C.\nAdd 8.6 µL of 10% SDS (1.5% final concentration) to each sample and mix by pipetting and tapping. Incubate at 55 °C for 10 min. Add 80 µL of 10% Triton X-100 (6% final concentration) to each sample and mix by pipetting.",
    "Add 660 µL of 1x ligation buffer without ATP (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 2.5 µg/mL BSA) + 1 mM ATP pH 8.0 + T4 DNA ligase (8 U/sample) to each sample and mix by gentle inversion. Incubate at 16 °C for 1.5 h with inversion every 30 min. Place the samples on ice immediately following the incubation.\n4. DNA purification\nPreheat one dry bath to 65 °C and another to 37 °C. Add 1 µL of 10 mg/mL proteinase K (prepared in 1x TE pH 8.0) to each sample (12.5 µg/mL final concentration). Incubate at 65 °C for 30 min and place the samples on ice immediately following the incubation until they have cooled.\nTransfer the samples to 2 mL tubes. Working in a fume hood, add an equal volume (~800 µL) of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (P/C/IA; pH 8.0) to each sample. Vortex the samples for ~30 s and centrifuge the samples for 5-10 min at 16,000 x g in a microcentrifuge.\nCarefully remove 600 µL of the upper phase of each sample into a new 1.5 mL tube. Properly dispose of the lower phase and 2 mL tubes.\nPrecipitate the DNA by adding a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 (~60 µL) to each sample, followed by 1 volume of isopropanol (~660 µL). Invert the samples 5x-10x and incubate at RT for 30 min.\nPlace the samples on ice for 2 min, and then centrifuge the samples at 16,500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Return the samples to ice, pour off the supernatant, and drain the tube on a paper towel.",
    "Wash the DNA pellet with 200 µL of 70% ethanol. Centrifuge at 16,500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C, place the samples back on ice, pour off the supernatant, and remove the residual alcohol with a pipet. Dry the samples with the caps of the tubes open at 37 °C for 15-20 min.\nResuspend the DNA pellets in 50 µL of 1x TE by vortexing. Incubate at RT for 30 min, vortex, and then incubate at 37 °C in a dry bath for 30 min. Vortex the samples again, and then place them on ice. Samples can be stored at this stage at −20 °C for several months, but it is advisable to proceed immediately for the decrosslinking (DLC only) and qPCR steps.\n5. Psoralen crosslink reversal (for DLC assay only)\nPipet 9 µL of purified DNA into a PCR tube on ice. Add 1 µL of 1 M KOH (0.1 M final concentration). Incubate the samples at 90 °C for 30 min in a thermocycler.\nAdd 19.73 µL of sodium acetate solution (0.1 M sodium acetate, 9.6 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA pH 8.0). Samples can be stored at this stage at −20 °C for several months, but it is advisable to proceed immediately to the qPCR step.\n6. Quantitative PCR, controls, and analysis",
    "Using 2 µL of purified DNA, with or without crosslinking, set up a 20 µL qPCR reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Set up each reaction in duplicate. For both the DLC and DLE assays, there are five control reactions and one DLC/DLE quantification reaction, or a total of six reactions per sample, run in duplicate. Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Table S2 provide a template for setting up these reactions and analysis, and the sequences of the qPCR primers are listed in Table 3.\nqPCR cycling conditions need to be optimized for each qPCR kit.\n\t\nUse the following DLC qPCR conditions, depending on the qPCR kits used: initial denaturation (95 °C for 3 min); 50 rounds of amplification (95 °C for 15 s, 61 °C for 25 s, 72 °C for 15 s with a single acquisition); melting curve analysis (95 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 1 min, 97 °C with continuous acquisition); and cooling (37 °C for 30 s).\nUse the following qPCR conditions for the DLE assay: initial denaturation (95 °C for 5 min); 50 rounds of amplification (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 15 s with a single acquisition); melting curve analysis (95 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 1 min, 97 °C with continuous acquisition); and cooling (37 °C for 30 s). Note that optimization for different qPCR machines/kits may be required.\nDLC assay\n\t\nControls: See the list of qPCR primers in Table 3. A map of the primer binding sites is shown in Figure S1.

    "Genomic DNA at ARG4: Use olWDH1760/olWDH1761 to amplify dsDNA located at ARG4. Use this reaction as a loading control and normalize all other reactions except the DLC signal reaction to this control.\nIntramolecular ligation efficiency at DAP2: Use the 1,904 bp fragment created by EcoRI digestion for intramolecular ligation in parallel with the DLC ligation. Amplification across this ligation junction reports on the intramolecular ligation efficiency and serves as a control to which the DLC signal is normalized.\nDSB induction: Use olWDH1766/olWDH1767 to amplify a region that spans the induced DSB.\nPsoralen crosslinking and resection: Use olWDH2019/olWDH2020 to amplify the unique PhiX region downstream of the EcoRI recognition site. Without crosslink reversal, use the ratio of the ssDNA (no crosslinking) over ARG4 (crosslinked dsDNA) to determine the crosslinking efficiency. With crosslink reversal, resection will lead to a progressive decrease from 1 to 0.5 of the signal relative to ARG4.\nEcoRI recognition site restoration and cutting: Use olWDH1768/olWDH1764 to amplify a region that spans the restored EcoRI recognition site upstream of the DSB on the resected strand. olWDH1769/olWDH1763 amplify a region that spans the EcoRI restriction enzyme site at DAP2. Perform EcoRI cleavage at this site to use as intramolecular ligation control.\nDLC signal: Use olWDH1764/olWDH1765 to amplify the chimeric DNA molecule created by intramolecular ligation of the resected (invading) strand and the donor.\nAnalysis: Calculate the average and standard deviation of the Cp values for each of the duplicate reactions. Use the ARG4 genomic DNA qPCR Cp values as a reference to normalize all the other control qPCRs. Normalize the DLC signal to the intramolecular ligation control at DAP2. See Figure 3 for typical DLC signal values at 2 h.\nDLE assay",
    "Controls: See the list of qPCR primers in Table 3. A map of the primer binding sites is shown in Figure S1. For supplementary sequence files for the relevant genomic features and amplicons, check the A plasmid Editor (ApE) files (Supplementary Sequence Files 1-5).\n\t\t\nGenomic DNA at ARG4: See section 6.3.1.1.\nIntramolecular ligation efficiency at YLR050C: Use the HindIII digestion to create a 765 bp fragment that will undergo intramolecular ligation in parallel with the DLE ligation. Amplification across this ligation junction reports on the intramolecular ligation efficiency and serves as a control to which the DLE signal is normalized.\nDSB induction: See section 6.3.1.3.\nHindIII recognition site restoration and cutting: Use olWDH2010/olWDH2012 and olWDH2009/2011 to amplify a region that spans the HindIII restriction enzyme sites on the broken strand where it has been resected and extended, respectively.\nDLE signal: Use olWDH2009/olWDH2010 to amplify the chimeric DNA molecule created by intramolecular ligation of the resected end of the invading strand upstream of the DSB to the newly extended end downstream of the DSB.\nAnalysis: Calculate the average and standard deviation of the Cp values for each of the duplicate reactions. Use the ARG4 genomic DNA qPCR Cp values as a reference to normalize all the other control qPCRs. Normalize the DLE signal to the intramolecular ligation control at YLR050C. Typical DLE signal values at 6 h are reported in Figure 4 and previous publications9.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
