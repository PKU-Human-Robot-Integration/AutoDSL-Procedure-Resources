    "Brain slice cutting and recovery are done as previously described 3, 4. Bubble two crystal dishes filled with NMDG recovery solution with 95% oxygen/5% CO2 gas (carbogen), one dish on ice, the other at 33 °C.\nBubble one crystal dish filled with HEPES holding aCSF with carbogen at room temperature.\nAnesthetize adult mouse (aged 2 to 12 months) with Na+ pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, i.p.). Proceed with procedure when the animal has no response to a toe-pinch.\nIf necessary, cut a tail tissue sample for later genotyping of the animal.\nOpen the chest cavity, expose the heart, and clamp the descending aorta. Lacerate the right atrium.\nTranscardially perfuse animal with 5-10 ml of 0-4 °C NMDG-recovery solution.\nDecapitate animal, remove the brain and place it in 4 °C NMDG-recovery solution for 1 min.\nOn an ice-chilled metal plate, trim the brain in the desired orientation (coronal, parasagittal, horizontal, etc.) to include the area of interest.\nAffix the brain block with superglue to the dry stage surface of a vibrating slicer (DSK-Zero 1; Dosaka), submerge the brain block in 4 °C NMDG-recovery solution, and continuously bubble the solution with carbogen.\nCut slices of the brain area of interest. Slice thickness is 200-400 μm, depending on the specific brain area of interest, animal age, and experiment to be performed.\nImmediately after cutting, incubate desired slices in carbogenated, 33 °C NMDG-recovery solution for exactly 12 min, then transfer to carbogenated, room temperature HEPES holding solution for an initial period of 60 min. After this 60 min incubation, slices can be used for recording. Slices are maintained in HEPES holding solution throughout the day until they are used for recording.\n3. Patch Clamp Recording from Neurons in Brain Slices",
    "Pull a standard patch micropipette with a programmable Flaming-Brown puller (Sutter P-97 or equivalent vertical puller). Pipettes that are optimal for giga-ohm seal formation typically have a resistance of 4-6 MΩ\nTransfer one slice to the recording chamber (RC-27L; Warner Instruments) on the stage of an upright microscope (Nikon FN-1). Continuously superfuse (1.5 - 2.0 ml/min) the slice with carbogenated, standard recording aCSF heated and maintained at 32 °C. Alternatively, slices can be maintained at room temperature.\nLocate and center the brain area of interest using a 10X air objective (Nikon Plan Fluor 10X; NA 0.3; WD: 16 mm).\nVisualize individual neurons using a 40X near-infrared (IR) water immersion objective (Nikon APO 40XW; NA: 0.80; WD: 3.5 mm) connected to IR-differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and a high-speed near infrared charged coupled device (CCD) video camera (Hamamatsu C-7500). Under IR-DIC observation, healthy neurons exhibit a smooth, light-grey plasma membrane.\nFill a micropipette with a suitable intracellular recording solution. For most applications, we use the following solution (in mM): 135 potassium gluconate, 5 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.1 GTP (pH adjusted to 7.25 with Tris base, osmolarity adjusted to 290 mOsm with sucrose). Establish a whole-cell recording from a visualized neuron.\n4. Local Application of Drugs to Neurons in Slices\nPull a standard patch clamp micropipette as described above. Using a pipette puller such as a Sutter P-97 that produces two identical \"sister\" tips from the same piece of glass is advantageous when multiple drug solutions are to be used on the same cell. Tip sizes that would have a resistance of ~5 MΩ if they were filled with the intracellular solution described above are optimal.",
    "Backfill the micropipette with a solution of drug diluted in carbogenated, standard recording aCSF. Point the tip downward, and flick the drug-filled micropipette to remove any air bubbles trapped in the column of solution.\nMount the drug-filled micropipette in a pipette holder connected with tubing to a suitable pressure ejection system, such as a Picospritzer III (General Valve Co.). The pipette holder should be mounted onto a micromanipulator with the same resolution as manipulators commonly used for patch clamp recording (for example, Sutter MP-285). Additionally, the manipulator should allow for diagonal movement into and out of the slice. Manually eject pressure 3 to 4 times into the micropipette in order to build up adequate pressure behind the column of fluid.\nUsing the micromanipulator controls, lower the drug pipette into the slice while visualizing the tip under IR-DIC optics. Ideally, one should visually identify and center a neuron to be recorded from, followed by positioning of the drug pipette near the cell prior to lowering the recording micropipette into the slice. Positioning the drug pipette can cause movement of tissue in the vicinity of the recorded cell that could disrupt the recording if the drug pipette is moved into position after establishing a gigaohm seal.\nUsing IR video, position the drug micropipette at the top surface of the tissue slice. Execute one pressure ejection and monitor 1) the vicinity of the tip for movement of debris related to the ejection, and 2) the micropipette tip for any signs that the tip is clogged or blocked. If the tip is blocked/clogged, retract the pipette and replace it with a new one.",
    "Approach the recorded cell diagonally from the top of the slice such that when in final position, the tip of the drug-filled pipette is 1) in the same focal plane (or slightly below) as the recorded cell and the tip of the recording electrode, and 2) 10 to 40 μm from the recorded cell. If the drug-filled pipette tip is above the recorded cell, the force from the pressure ejection could disrupt the gigaohm seal.\nRecord the desired cellular response while holding the cell in voltage clamp mode or current clamp mode. We routinely record acetylcholine and/or nicotine-elicited cellular currents while holding neurons in voltage clamp mode. Although pressure ejection can be triggered manually when using a Picospritzer III, for more reproducible results it is advisable to trigger the pressure ejection using the acquisition system (Axon Digidata 1440 and pClamp 10.3) with a digital TTL pulse.\n5. Controlling the Drug-filled Micropipette with a Piezoelectric Translator\nIf possible, mount the drug-filled pipette holder to a single-dimension piezoelectric translator (e.g. Piezojena PA-100 or Burleigh PZM-150) that is capable of accepting an analog voltage input (again, from the acquisition system), which is then mounted onto the high-precision micromanipulator (Sutter MP-285). A piezoelectric translator is useful because the movement of the drug-filled pipette into and out of the slice, including the timing and speed of entry/exit, can be more easily controlled and reproduced from experiment to experiment. When studying nAChRs, the desensitizing effects of nicotine leakage from the drug-filled pipette, should they ever occur, are minimized when the pipette is only moved near the cell with a piezoelectric translator for the moment of pressure ejection.\nUsing the manually-controlled potentiometer on the piezoelectric voltage control amplifier, dial the voltage to its maximal value.",
    "Using the micromanipulator, position the drug-filled pipette in the slice where the pipette will eject its contents onto the recorded cell, and retract the pipette by manually reducing the voltage to zero on the piezoelectric voltage control amplifier.\nUsing an analog output signal from the recording acquisition system, move the drug-filled pipette into the slice over a period of 250 msec starting 300 msec before the pressure ejection TTL pulse occurs. Retract the pipette over a period of 250 msec, starting 50 msec after the TTL pulse ends.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
