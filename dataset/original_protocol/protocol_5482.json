    "NP-40 fractionationWash plate 2 x with 2 ml PBS per well. Plate should have 5-10 x 106 cells at 90-95% confluence.Trypsinize cells (500 μl/well) and add 1 ml/well of media to neutralize. Combine the 6 wells of each plate. Can use a single 10 cm dish at the same confluence of 90-95% with 3-6 x107 cells. Spin cells at 4 °C, 100 x g for 5 min. Resuspend cells with 1 ml PBS. Pellet cells at 100 x g for 4 min at 4 °C.Resuspend cells in 200 μl TMK. Note: For qPCR analysis of whole cell extraction, you can take out 50 μl and extract the DNA before proceeding to Procedure B.Add 150 μl of TMK +1% NP-40.Incubate on ice for 5 min with occasional gentle vortexing.Pellet at 228 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet–This is the Cytoplasmic fraction. Suspend the stripped nuclear pellet in 500 ml of S1 buffer.Layer the S1 suspended pellets over 500 ml of S2 buffer.Centrifuge at 1,430 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant off.Resuspend the nuclei in 300 μl PBS. Note: At this point, all samples can be stored at 4 °C overnight before proceeding to Procedure B.DNA extractionsAdd 600 μl ice-cold cell lysis buffer to the cell extracts. Expect SDS precipitation with most extractions; it will not affect the end result. Vortex thoroughly for 30 sec.Add 3 μl of Proteinase K solution (20 mg/ml). Incubate DNA sample at 55 °C for 3-16 h. The time is dependent on how much SDS precipitation is noticed on the samples and cell line used. A rule of thumb is the more SDS precipitation and larger cells tend to require more incubation time.",
    "Shear DNA by drawing repeatedly (15 x) through a 21 G needle, avoiding excessive foaming and loss by aerosolization.Allow cooling to RT, then add 3 μl of 4 mg/ml DNAse-free Ribonuclease A. Digest for 15-60 min at 37 °C. Note: At this point, all samples can be stored at 4 °C overnight before proceeding to step B5. Cool to RT. Add 200 μl 5 M potassium acetate; vortex for 20 sec.Pellet precipitated protein/SDS by centrifugation at 4 °C for 3 min at maximum RPM.Transfer solution to a fresh tube with 600 μl isopropanol. Mix by inversion. Spin at maximum RPM for 3 min at RT.Remove supernatant and wash DNA with 600 μl 70% EtOH. Spin for 3 min at maximum RPM to sediment the pellet. Aspirate the ethanol. Repeat with a 1-min spin and aspirate residual EtOH.Air-dry for 15 min. Redissolve the pellet in 100 μl 8 mM NaOH or 10 mM Tris. This may be slow–an incubation at 37 °C for 15 min is recommended. The DNA may now be stored at -20 °C without incident.Assessing efficiency of the NP-40 fractionationTo assess the accuracy of the nucleo-cytoplasmic separation, qPCR can be utilized using nuclear, mitochondrial and whole cell extract samples such as example below.DNA samples were diluted 1 to 10 in dH2O and incubated at 98 °C for 20 min followed by immediate cooling on ice. Each PCR reaction contained 7.5 μl SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Fermentas), 2 μl of template, and 1 μM of each primer (Table 1) in a 15 μl reaction volume.Table 1.

PCR conditions were as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171019/20171019010347_8415.jpg"
