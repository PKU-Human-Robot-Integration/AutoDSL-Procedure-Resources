The protocol utilizes organic solvents and the harmful nature of some of the solvents, combined with the relatively long time to complete the protocol, can therefore be a limitation of using this method.\nHarvest fungal material as outlined in Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] Steps 1-4.\nHomogenize tissue\nAdd 200 μL CTAB buffer to sample and grind tissue with a micropestle.\n1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes often work best\nAdd 200 μL CTAB buffer to sample and grind tissue with a pipette tip with the end melted\nPlace end of a 1000 μL pipette tip into the flame of an ethanol or Bunsen burner until the hole is sealed\nAllow the tip to cool. The plastic end often becomes cloudy as it cools\nHomogenize using a Qiagen TissueLyser (or other lysis machine)\nAdd glass beads or a heavy metal bead to the tube (2 mL Eppendorf tubes often work best for the heavy beads)\nRun TissueLyser at 24 Hz for four min\nAdd 500 μL CTAB buffer, 7 μL Proteinase K, 7 μL RNase A and 7 μL β-Mercaptoethanol.\nIncubate on a rotor at 65°C for at least 3 h (1 h if samples were freeze-dried).\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 20,000×g.\nTransfer supernatant to a new tube.\nAdd 700 μL phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1).\nMix by turning upside down 100 times and incubate for 5 min at 18°C–27°C.\nVortexing for 5 s is also possible but increases the risk of shearing DNA\nCentrifuge for 30 min at 20,000×g and 20°C.\nTransfer the upper phase, avoiding the white interphase, to a new tube.",
    "Add 700 μL chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1).\nMix by turning upside down 100 times and incubate for 5 min at 18°C–27°C.\nVortexing for 5 s is also possible but increases the risk of shearing DNA\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 20,000×g and 20°C.\nTransfer upper phase, avoiding the white interphase, to a new tube while measuring supernatant volume.\nAdd 1/3 supernatant volume of 5M NaCl and 2/3 supernatant volume of ice-cold isopropanol to the tube.\nThis step brings the DNA out of solution. While the isopropanol does not have to be ice-cold, it helps to improve overall yield.\nMix by turning upside down 20 times and centrifuge for 30 min at 20,000×g and 20°C.\nDiscard supernatants.\nAvoid disturbing any pellet with a pipette tip.\nAdd 750 μL 70% Ethanol and centrifuge for 3 min at 20,000×g.\nThe use of ice-cold ethanol can improve yield.\nCan be repeated to increase purity.\nDiscard supernatants.\nAvoid disturbing any pellet with a pipette tip.\nAir-dry pellets then add 50–100 μL EB buffer (or other elution buffer).\nMaximum time for air-drying is 10 min. Be sure to properly remove ethanol with a 10 μL pipette and the remaining ethanol will evaporate within a few minutes.\nAllow the sample to dissolve for at least 1 h at 18°C–27°C or for 12 h at 4°C.\nNote: Unless otherwise indicated, centrifugation steps are at 18°C–27°C.\nProtocol 2: Qiagen DNeasy plant pro mini kit\nTiming: 1 h 20 min\nDNA extraction using the Qiagen (Germany) DNeasy plant pro mini kit. While more expensive than the other protocols, this kit is simple and relatively quick to use and is also available in a 96-well format.\nUsing starting material harvested according to Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] Steps 1-4, we followed the manufacturer's instructions with the following options:\nAll centrifuge steps at 20°C.",
    "Lysis using a Qiagen TissueLyser LT: 4 min at 24 Hz.\nStep 5: addition of 250 μL Buffer CD2.\nProtocol 3: Chelex\nTiming: 25 min\nThe Chelex extraction is cheap and very quick to extract from a lot of samples. The Chelex resin inhibits DNases which are not denatured by boiling. This protocol works very well for DNA barcoding and could potentially be used for shotgun sequencing. Extractions can be performed in a 96 well plate meaning it can be possible to extract DNA from 96 samples in under 1 h.\nPlace 5% Chelex solution on magnetic stirrer.\nFollowing Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] Steps 1-4, harvest fungal mycelium into a 250 μL PCR tube.\nAdd 200 μL of 5% Chelex.\nVortex tubes for 15 s.\nIncubate in a PCR machine at 99.9°C for 15 min.\nCentrifuge tubes at 3,300×g for 3 min.\nTransfer 100 μL of supernatant to a new tube.\nProtocol 4: Chelex with proteinase K\nTiming: 40 min\nThis method is like the above Chelex protocol but with the addition of Proteinase K to assist lysis of the fungal cells and increase DNA yield.\nPlace 5% Chelex solution on magnetic stirrer.\nFollowing Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] Steps 1-4, harvest 10–20 mg of fungal mycelium into a 250 μL PCR tube.\nAdd 200 μL of 5% Chelex with 20 mg/mL of Proteinase K.\nVortex tubes for 15 s.\nIncubate in a PCR machine at 65°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge tubes at 3,300×g for 3 min.\nTransfer 100 μL of supernatant to a new tube.\nAgarose gel electrophoresis\nTiming: 120 min\nWe used agarose gel electrophoresis to provide a qualitative assessment of the length of DNA fragments in our extracts.\nPour 0.7%–1% (0.8 % was used in this experiment) into a gel tray.",
    "Mix 0.5 μL of 1 kb DNA Extension Ladder, 2 μL loading buffer and 2.5 μL H2O then add to the first well.\nMix 3 μL loading buffer with 2 μL sample DNA and add to individual wells.\nRun gel at 60–70 V for approximately 90 min."
