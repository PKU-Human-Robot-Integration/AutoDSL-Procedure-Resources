    "1. Preparing Glass Tubes\nPrepare the glass tubes (e.g., 2.8 cm diameter, 13 cm long) and close one end with a plastic snap cap.\nSeparate 10 insects into the capped glass tubes and cover the remaining end with gauze using a rubber band. Allow the insects to acclimatize to the temperature, light conditions and humidity of the wind tunnel room for at least 2 h.\n\tNOTE: The number of insects inside each tube depends on the species and research question.\n2. Preparing Odor Sources\nSprayer protocol.\n\t\nFill the 1 mL gastight syringe with a diluted headspace collection or a synthetic odor mix.\n\t\tNOTE: The content of the diluted headspace or synthetic odor mix depends on insect species and research question. In general, the concentrations used should correspond to the natural release rates of the authentic odor source.\nConnect the syringe tip to the FEP tubing using tubing adaptors and insert the syringe into the syringe pump.\nStart the syringe pump.\nStart the broadband ultrasonic generator.\n\t\tNOTE: The release of the aerosol from the sprayer can be confirmed by pointing a torch light from below the release point.\nRun the sprayer with 96% ethanol for a minimum of 10 min between the treatments to clean the inside of the tubes and nozzle. Use a separate syringe, dedicated to pure ethanol, for all cleaning.\nClean the syringes and the tip of the nozzle with 96% ethanol after use.\nAuthentic odor source protocol.\n\t\nInsert the authentic odor sources into the wind tunnel or into a 2 L headspace collection jar.\nConnect the headspace collection jar to the laboratory air flow and release into the wind tunnel.",
    "NOTE: Collect plant material as close to the start of the experiments as possible and prevent wilting by inserting the cut end into a small vial with water. The amount and type of plant material, or other authentic odor source, depends on insect species and research question.\nPosition the glass tube with the insect(s) onto a holder 180 cm downwind from the odor/visual source and 30 cm from the ground. The capped end should point upwind.\n3. Starting the protocol\nUse two cameras to capture two different views. Mount the cameras above the flight arena and angled to capture two different views.\nOpen the cap.\nStart the timer.\n\tNOTE: Different species require different time frames to respond, e.g., the apple fruit moth (Argyresthia conjugella) will respond within 4 to 5 min11, but the grapewine moth (Lobesia botrana) require up to 20 min to respond18.\nObserve the flight pattern and pay special attention to the flight characteristics and upwind orientation. Score the flight performance according to predefined behavioral categories, e.g., take off, oriented flight over a short distance (minimum 20 cm), oriented flight over longer distance (< 5 cm from the source) and landing.\n\tNOTE: Filming and 3D tracking using two cameras can be used to give more detailed information on the flight characteristics. In general, the cameras are mounted above the flight arena and angled to capture two different views.\nCollect the insects landing on the walls of the wind tunnel, outside the odor plume, and replace back onto the holder.\n\tNOTE: The insects can be given one chance to respond to odors with upwind flight and not be replaced.\nChange to clean glass hardware between the treatments.\n\tNOTE: Frequent control treatments should be run to identify possible contamination sources.",
    "Euthanize the insects with CO2 or by freezing after the experiments.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the research question, females can be scored for egg development or visually inspected to verify the condition of wings or antennae.\n4. Cleaning\nWash all metal and glass hardware with ethanol and water and leave until dry.\nHeat all metal and glass hardware to 300 Â°C for 6 h to remove the contaminants.\nSubscription Required.
