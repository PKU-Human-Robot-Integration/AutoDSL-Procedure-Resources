    "1. Prepare Worms for Imaging\nNOTE: See related JoVE video article31: https://www.jove.com/v/835/ \nFor each experimental group, pipette or pick 20 to 30 worms to an imaging platform compatible with the imaging microscope. Most common platforms include 2% agarose gel pads mounted on glass slides with a coverslip31 and 96-well plates containing well volumes at or less than 100 µL of liquid medium.\nParalyze the worms by adding 30-90 mM sodium azide (NaN3), 2.5-8.5 mM levamisole HCl, or other paralyzing agent to the worms. If paralyzing in liquid, use a higher concentration of paralyzing agent than if paralyzing on agarose pads. Tap imaging platform gently to mix.\nAllow worms to paralyze completely.\n\tNOTE: This may take several minutes.\n2. Image Dopaminergic Neurons\nLocate worms' head regions under single-color GFP fluorescence using imaging microscope capable of taking z-stacks.\n\t\nBe mindful of exposure and aperture settings; avoid overexposure of dendrites and keep settings consistent across trials. Make the dendrites as bright as needed for clear visualization; this typically results in overexposure of the soma.\n\t\tNOTE: Images included in this protocol were captured using 400x magnification.\nScroll through the focus to find upper and lower bounds where the dendrites are clear. Set these as upper and lower bounds for a z-stack image capture.\nClick to capture z-stack images for each worm.\n\t​NOTE: All following steps may be performed at any time.\n3. Prepare Dopaminergic Neuron Images for Scoring\nFor each z-stack, open the image file using either the microscope software or an external image analysis software, load the stack in the software, and compress the stack into a single flattened image.\nBlind images between and within treatment groups manually or using automatic blinding software.\n4. Score Dopaminergic Neuron Dendrites",
    "Work with one neuron image at a time. Choose one of the four CEP dendrites to assess for blebs, breaks, and irregularities including bends, kinks, and curves. Scoring from the left to right when the nose is at the top of the image is recommended to ensure repeatability in scoring.\nUsing the following guidelines, assign one score value to the dendrite. See Figure 1 for representative scoring image examples.\n\t0- no damage, \"perfect\" neurons\n\t1- irregular (kinks, curves, etc.)\n\t2- <5 blebs\n\t3- 5-10 blebs\n\t4- >10 blebs and/or breakage removing <25% of total dendrite\n\t5- breakage, 25-75% of dendrite removed\n\t6- ​breakage, >75% dendrite removed\n\t\nIf multiple criteria are met within a single dendrite (i.e., kinks and blebs), assign the highest applicable score.\nDo not score dendrites that are not clearly visible, due to issues with image capture, overlapping with other dendrites, etc. If zooming in on a flattened z stack image, be mindful of enlarged pixels resembling false blebs.\nRepeat for each dendrite. Repeat for all images.\nRecord all scores. Scores may be un-blinded at this time.\n5. Prepare and Present Data\nCalculate the total number of dendrites in each treatment group assigned to each neurodegeneration score. Calculate the total number of scored dendrites in each treatment group.\nDivide the neurodegeneration score tallies by the total number of dendrites scored in the treatment group. Present data as a proportion of dendrites within a treatment group at each neurodegeneration score.\n6. Perform Statistical Analysis\nUsing a programming software or manually, run a chi-squared test for independence between all treatment group pairs to be compared. When appropriate, apply a Bonferroni correction of the p-value according to the number of compared experimental groups to account for multiple comparisons.",
    "NOTE: This test will determine significant differences between two groups, but details of the type of difference must be qualified by eye.\n\t\nSelect comparisons between experimental groups. This will vary based on experimental design.\n\t\t​NOTE: In our experiments, typically, controls are compared to their respective treatment groups, all controls are compared, and all treatments are compared.\n7. Practice Scoring with Practice Set of Dopaminergic Neuron Images\nSee Supplementary File 1 for a set of neuron images presenting across the full range of our scoring system with commentary and score key. This practice set is intended to train researchers new to this method and ensure inter-rater reliability.\n8. Consider Alternate Protocol Options\nInstead of capturing z-stacks, complete scoring at the microscope, without saving or stacking images.\n\tNOTE: This option reduces requirements for technology capabilities, but removes the option for creating an archive of neuron images to return to at a later time, requires manual blinding, and permits blinding only between and not within treatment groups.\nInstead of creating a single compressed image per stack, complete scoring by scrolling through the images of each z-stack.\n\tNOTE: This option may be easier for some scorers and it reduces the risk for seeing false blebs on worms that moved during imaging and allows for scoring overlapping dendrites, but requires manual blinding and permits blinding only between and not within treatment groups."
