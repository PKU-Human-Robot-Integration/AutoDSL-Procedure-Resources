    "All animal experiments described here have been approved by the institutional and state animal care committee (Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz, Koblenz, Germany; approval number G18-1-044) and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the European and German Society of Laboratory Animal Sciences.\n1. Anesthesia, intubation and mechanical ventilation\nWithhold food for 6 hours before anesthesia to reduce the risk of aspiration, but allow free access to water to reduce stress.\nInject a combination of ketamine (4 mg∙kg-1) and azaperone (8 mg∙kg-1) intramuscularly for sedation while the animal is in the animal box.\nEstablish a venous line with a common peripheral venous catheter (20 G) in an ear vein after local disinfection with alcohol.\nStart monitoring the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) by clipping the sensor onto one of the ears or the tail of the animal.\nInject fentanyl (4 µg∙kg-1), propofol (3 mg∙kg-1) and atracurium (0.5 mg∙kg-1) for induction of anesthesia.\nPlace the pig in a supine position on the stretcher.\nVentilate the pig with a mask suitable for animals with a peak inspiratory pressure below 20 cmH2O, a PEEP of 5 cmH2O, a frequency of 14-16 /min and a FiO2 of 1.0.\nStart a continuous infusion with balanced electrolyte solution (5 mL∙kg-1∙h-1), propofol (8-12 mg∙kg-1∙h-1) and fentanyl (0.1-0.2 mg∙kg-1∙h-1) to maintain anesthesia.\nFor the intubation, use a common endotracheal tube suitable for the animal (e.g., weight of 25-30 kg, endotracheal tube ID 6-7) armed with endotracheal tube introducer, and a common laryngoscope with a Macintosh Blade 4. Two people are necessary.\n\t\nPerson 1: Pull out the tongue with one hand and press the snout down with the other.\nPerson 2: Insert the laryngoscope and advance it as usual until the epiglottis can be visualized.",
    "Pull the laryngoscope upwards to visualize the vocal cords. Sometimes the epiglottis “sticks” to the soft palatine. If so, mobilize it with the tip of the tube.\nInsert the tube through the vocal cords and pull out the introducer.\nBlock the balloon of the tube.\nConnect the tube to the ventilator and check correct positioning with capnography and auscultation.\nStart mechanical ventilation (tidal volume 6-8 mL/kg, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 0.4, frequency to keep etCO2 between 35 – 45 mmHg).\n2. Instrumentation\nRetract the hind legs with bandages for catheterizing necessary vessels. An arterial line, an arterial introducer sheath, a central venous line and a venous introducer sheath for pulmonary artery catheter placement are necessary.\nGenerously disinfect the femoral area with alcoholic disinfection. Depending on the planned examinations, a more or less aseptic approach is used.\nPrepare catheters by flushing them with saline.\nPlace the ultrasound probe on the inguinal ligament and scan for femoral vessels.\nTurn the probe 90° to fully visualize the femoral arteria in the long axis. If necessary, it is also possible in different circumstances to use the short axis view to fully visualize the femoral arteria.\nCannulate the femoral arteria under in-line ultrasound visualization with the needle of the introducer set in Seldinger’s technique. When pulsating bright blood flows out, introduce the guidewire and retract the needle.\nVisualize the femoral vein and cannulate the vein under in-line ultrasound visualization and continuous aspiration with the needle of the introducer set. When venous blood is aspirable, disconnect the syringe and insert the guidewire. Retract the needle.\nCheck position of the wires with ultrasound.\nInsert the arterial and the venous line over the placed guidewires.\nRepeat arterial and venous punctuation on other side and insert the introducer sheaths per Seldinger´s technique as described above.",
    "Connect the arterial line and the venous line each to a transducer.\nPosition both transducers at heart level and switch the three-way stopcocks of both transducers open to the atmosphere to calibrate the system to zero.\n\tNOTE: It is necessary to avoid any air bubbles and bloodstains in the system to generate plausible values.\nSwitch infusion of propofol and fentanyl to one of the ports of the central venous line.\nCalibrate the probe for ultrafast pO2-measurements and insert it through the arterial introducer sheath.\n\tNOTE: The measurement of pO2 with the probe for ultrafast pO2-measurement is not obligatory but helps visualizing the real-time changes in pO2.\n3. Inserting pulmonary artery catheter\nCheck the balloon of the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) for damage.\nConnect to the transducer and calibrate it.\nInsert the PAC through the introducer sheath (balloon deflated).\nWhen the PAC has passed through the introducer sheath (15-20 cm), inflate the balloon.\nAdvance the PAC and monitor the typical waveforms (venous vessels, right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary arteria, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Deflate the balloon and check if blood can be aspirated through all ports of the PAC.\n4. Induction of lung injury: first hit by bronchoalveolar lavage\nPrepare sterile balanced electrolyte solution (e.g., Sterofundin) warmed to 40 °C.\n\tNOTE: Sterile balanced electrolyte solution is used to avoid pulmonary pollution.\nChange the FiO2 from 0.4 to 1.0 over 10 min before performing the bronchoalveolar lavage.\nStart the ultrafast pO2-measurement.\nPrepare norepinephrine for continuous infusion and for bolus injection (if mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg). Connect the norepinephrine syringe pump to one of the ports of the central venous catheter without starting it.\nFill 30 mL∙kg-1 from the warmed sterile balanced electrolyte solution into a funnel. Check that the funnel can be connected to the endotracheal tube.",
    "Disconnect the tube without PEEP loss in inspiration from the ventilator.\nConnect the funnel to the endotracheal tube.\nRaise the funnel 1 m above the animal manually.\nOpen the cap and instill the entire amount of the warmed balanced electrolyte solution from the funnel into the endotracheal tube over 30 s by using the hydrostatic pressure.\nAfter 30 s, remove the infused solution by lowering the funnel 1 meter below the animal and drain the lavage fluid passively. Reconnect the animal to the ventilator for oxygenation.\nCollect the removed lavage fluid and note the amount. It is needed to calculate the alveolar fluid clearance.\n\tNOTE: Do not reuse the balanced electrolyte solution after a lavage to maximize surfactant wash out.\nAspirate the remainders of the solution in the tube by using suction catheters.\nClosely monitor hemodynamics after the bronchoalveolar lavage and keep norepinephrine at hand. If necessary, give norepinephrine as bolus or continuous infusion to stabilize blood pressure (compare to step 4.4).\nRepeat infusion of 30 mL∙kg-1 balanced electrolyte solution as described in the steps 4.5-4.13 until PaO2/FiO2-ratio is below 250 mmHg. Four to five repetitions of the bronchoalveolar lavage may be necessary.\nIf PaO2/FiO2-ratio is lower than 250 mmHg, start with the induction of lung injury by oleic acid injection. Do not change the ventilator settings during this procedure.\n5. Induction of lung injury: second hit by oleic acid injection\nPrepare oleic-acid solution: 0.1 mL∙kg-1 of oleic acid in a 20 mL syringe and connect it to a 3-way-stopcock. Take 2 mL of blood in another 20 mL syringe. Add saline to a total volume of 20 mL in both syringes and connect the second syringe also to the 3-way-stopcock.\n\tCAUTION: Use gloves and eye protection when working with oleic acid.",
    "Prepare norepinephrine for continuous infusion and for bolus injection (if mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg). Connect the norepinephrine syringe pump to one of the ports of the central venous catheter without starting it.\nContinue to monitor the ultrafast pO2-measurement that still measuring. FiO2 is still 1.0.\nConnect the 3-way-stopcock to the proximal port of the PAC.\nMix the oleic acid and the blood/saline mixture thoroughly by repeated shifting of the solution from one syringe to the other syringe and vice versa via the three-way-stopcock and keep mixing all the time. When it is a homogenous emulsion, inject 2 mL of the emulsion and continue mixing.\n\tNOTE: If mixing stops, the emulsion may separate into a lipophilic and a hydrophilic part.\nClosely monitor hemodynamics after injection of oleic acid and keep norepinephrine at hand. If necessary, give norepinephrine as bolus or continuous infusion to stabilize blood pressure (compare to step 5.2).\n\tNOTE: Be vigilant; the animals can die during this procedure.\nRepeat injection of 2 mL of the solution every 3 min until PaO2/FiO2-ratio is below 150 mmHg.\nIf the syringe is empty before PaO2/FiO2-ratio is between 100 and 200 mmHg, prepare 2 more syringes as described in step 5.1. Repeat the steps 5.5-5.8 until the PaO2/FiO2-ratio falls between 100 and 200 mmHg.\n\tNOTE: A half to full syringe of the oleic acid and the blood/saline mixture is usually required.\nIf the PaO2/FiO2-ratio is between 100 and 200 mmHg, wait 30 min and check again. If it is consistently below 200 mmHg, start the experiment/treatment; otherwise prepare 2 more syringes as described in step 5.1 and repeat steps 5.5-5.9.\n\tNOTE: After induction of lung injury as described, the impairment of lung function can remain stable or deteriorate or even improve within certain limits.\n6. End of experiment and euthanasia",
    "Inject 0.5 mg of fentanyl additionally to the continuous anesthesia and wait 5 min. Inject 200 mg of propofol and 40 mmol of potassium chloride to kill the animal in deep anesthesia.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
