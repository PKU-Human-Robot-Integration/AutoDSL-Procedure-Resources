    "The procedures described in this protocol were previously approved to be used in the zebrafish model by the Animal Use Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São Paulo.\n1. AKI Induction by Cisplatin Intraperitoneal Injection\nPrepare cisplatin working solution by diluting the stock solution to 850 µg/mL in 0.9% NaCl. Keep at room temperature, protected from light.\n\tCAUTION: The fabricant recommends the manipulation of cisplatin with personal protective equipment (PPE) including goggles, gloves, and lab coat. Store the stock solution at room temperature, protected from light.\nPrepare 150 mg/L MS-222 (Tricaine) anesthetic in system water45. Anesthetize adult zebrafish (5-9 months) by immersion for approximately 1-2 min.\n\tNOTE: Effectively anesthetized fish should be irresponsive to touch. To test effective anesthesia, gently press the caudal fin to observe reaction.\n\tCAUTION: Tricaine is an irritant to the skin and eyes, use PPE to manipulate.\nUsing a plastic spoon transfer the fish to an absorbent surface, such as paper towels, to remove excess water around the body. Then, with the plastic spoon transfer the fish to a Petri dish over a scale and weigh the fish. Take note of the weight of the fish as it will be necessary for dose calculations.\n\tNOTE: Absorbing excess water from fish prevents overestimate the animal's weight, do not over-dry since is prejudicial to the fish.\nTo achieve the final dose of 120 µg/g of weight, divide the µg of the final dose (120 µg) per the µg of the cisplatin working solution (850 µg) and convert this number to microliters (µL) by multiplying for 1000, to get the volume of 120 µg of cisplatin (141.2 µL). Then multiply this number (141.2 µL) for the weight of the fish (g) to get the final volume to be injected.",
    "With a plastic spoon, transfer the fish on a wet sponge with a little cut to hold it, with the ventral side up. The sponge should be wet with anesthetic in system water.\nFill a 31 G 1.0 mL insulin syringe with the calculated volume of cisplatin working solution.\nInsert the needle into the animal's intraperitoneal portion near the pelvic fin, at a shallow angle to avoid puncturing the viscera (Figure 2A). Then slowly inject the solution.\nAfter injection place the fish in a tank to recover from anesthesia. Watch the fish for signs of normal recovery (e.g., swimming movements, opercular movements).\n\t​NOTE: The animal should recover in the next 3-5 min. If necessary, stimulate the fish by moving it with a plastic spoon, a Pasteur plastic pipette, or putting it close to a hose with bubbles.\nFor control fish, perform the same procedure by injecting a solution of 0.9% NaCl. Use the same calculation following the proportion of body weight: the volume to be injected will be 141 µL multiplied by the weight of the fish (g).\nMonitor survival of fish at least twice a day in the following days (Figure 2B).\n2. Kidney Isolation and Tissue Processing for Flow Cytometry of Immune Cells\nFor this procedure, use immune cell-fluorescent marked transgenic animals (e.g., Tg (mpo:GFP)).\nAfter 24 hpi of 120 µg/g cisplatin, euthanize animals by hypothermal shock (rapid chilling).\n\tNOTE: Hypothermal shock has been demonstrated to be more effective as euthanasia method than MS-222 overdose. Hypothermal shock is less stressful, fast, consistent, and safer for personnel than the use of MS-222, has previously described46,47.\nIn an outer crossing tank prepare ice-water in a 5:1 ratio of ice to system water, put the inner tank with a screen over the ice, wait until water reaches 2-4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Fishes should not be in direct contact with the ice, because this may cause thermal burns and pain.\nTransfer animal to ice-water, wait at least 10 min until there is loss of orientation and no opercular movement.\nWith a plastic spoon, place the fish on paper towels to dry off the excess water.\nTransfer the fish to a 3% agarose dissection plate and take it under a stereoscope with upper light. With scissors, decapitate fish making a fast cut just behind the eyes, and remove the head.\nWith fine scissors make a cut from the open side to the cloaca and remove the internal organs with fine forceps.\nUse insect pins to pinch the sides of the body walls to open the carcass and expose the kidney attached to the backbone.\nDetach the kidney with fine forceps and place the organ in a 6 well plate with a cold solution of 1x PBS/2% FBS. Keep on ice.\nPick up the tissue with a Pasteur plastic pipette and pass the tissue through a 40 µm cell strainer over a 50 mL tube, gently macerating it with a syringe plunger.\nWash twice with 1 mL of 1x PBS/2% FBS and collect the cells in a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nCarefully pick up all the supernatant with a 1 mL micropipette and discard it. Add 500 µL of cold 1x PBS to resuspend the cells and place them in 5 mL flow cytometry tubes. Keep on ice.\nCount cells in Neubauer chamber making a 1:10 dilution in Trypan Blue (e.g., take 10 µL of the sample and mix with 90 µL of Trypan Blue). Add 10 µL of the mixture to a Neubauer chamber and count cells under the microscope.",
    "NOTE: Optimal results are expected with 1-5 x 106 cells/mL and >80% viability.\n\tCAUTION: Trypan blue is a carcinogenic agent, use PPE to handle.\nTake the cells to be read by a cytometer. Then analyze the results selecting the population of interest.\n3. Processing of Adult Zebrafish Kidney Tissue for TUNEL Assay\nFor this procedure, use wild-type animals (e.g., AB, Tübingen, etc.) or a transgenic animal with different fluorescent color than the TUNEL kit, as similar fluorescence can interfere with TUNEL's analysis.\nAfter 24 hpi of 120 µg/g cisplatin, euthanize animals by hypothermal shock (rapid chilling). See 2.3-2.4.\nDissect the fish as described in 2.5-2.6; the kidney must remain attached to the backbone during the fixation procedure (explained below).\nUsing insect pins, pinch the sides of the body walls to open the carcass and pin it on a cork surface to keep the kidney exposed.\n\tNOTE: This procedure ensures that the kidney remains in the right position for later analysis.\nThen place the cork surface with the kidney facing down in a 6 well plate over a freshly made solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Keep it overnight at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is carcinogenic and irritant for skin and mucous surfaces. Prepare PFA solutions under a chemical hood using PPE including eye protection equipment.\nThe next day, dissect the kidneys as in 2.8. Place the kidneys in a 60 mm Petri dish with 1x PBS and rinse twice in 1x PBS.\nPrepare 2% agarose to generate a support matrix for the tissue.\nDiscard all remaining 1x PBS from the Petri dish and pour 2% agarose slowly to cover the whole organ. Then position the kidney using fine forceps under a stereomicroscope to prevent the kidney to fold. Let agarose solidify at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: This procedure will keep the orientation and shape of the organ through histological processing since the leaf-like shape of the organ causes a tendency to fold if it is not inside a supportive matrix.\nAfter agarose solidification, use a scalpel to cut the agarose around the tissue, forming small cubes, and remove the excess of agarose around the tissue.\nPlace the agarose cubes in a cassette suitable for histological processing.\n\tNOTE: The following steps can be done manually or in an automatic tissue processor.\nFirst, process the tissue in the cassette following the next steps for 45 min each at room temperature: one bath of 50% ethanol, one bath of 70% ethanol, two consecutive baths of 95% ethanol, and three consecutive baths of 100% ethanol. Afterward, process the tissue in two consecutive baths of Xylene and three consecutive baths of paraffin; the latter lasts 1 hour each at 60 °C.\n\tCAUTION: Make changes under a chemical hood, vapors from ethanol and xylene are irritant and toxic.\nTo prepare paraffin blocks, melt paraffin lentils to 60 °C.\nOpen the plastic cassette with the tissue inside and keep it on a warm plate. Warm-up metal molds for the paraffin.\nWith tweezers place the tissue over a metal mold so that the kidney length is parallel to the mold base. Add the paraffin, reallocate the tissue if necessary.\nCover the mold with the base of the cassette and add paraffin until the grid is covered. Let solidify at room temperature and then place at -20 °C for a faster solidification process.\nRelease paraffin block from the metal mold around 20-30 min later.\nWith a microtome, section the tissue embedded in paraffin to 5 µm thickness. Use silanized or positively charged glass slides to collect the tissue.\n4. TUNEL assay",
    "NOTE: The following protocol uses an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Table of Materials).\nDewax tissue slides placing them in two consecutive baths of xylene for 5 min. Then rehydrate the tissue through a graded series of ethanol: 100%-95%-70%-50%, for 5 min each.\nPlace slides in running cold tap water to rinse off the ethanol. Keep the slides in distilled water.\nPrepare a dark incubator chamber. Add wet paper towels on the bottom to keep the moisture during the incubation steps.\n\tNOTE: In lack of an incubator chamber is possible to use a Petri dish with moist paper in the bottom and two toothpicks to place the slide.\nPrepare fresh Proteinase K working solution: 10 µg/mL in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4-8.\n\tNOTE: Proteinase K is used as a permeabilization agent, as recommended by the fabricant.\nPlace the slides in the dark incubator chamber and add Proteinase K working solution until cover samples. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nWhile samples are incubating, prepare the TUNEL reaction mixture: Add 50 µL of Enzyme Solution to 450 µL Label Solution. Protect from light.\n\tNOTE: The volume to be prepared can be adjusted in the same 1:10 proportion. The volume is calculated to be 50 µL of the mixture for each section; this can change depending on the size of the samples.\nPick up the dark chamber and wash the slides twice with 1x PBS.\nNext, dry the region around the sample using absorbent paper and add 50 µL of TUNEL reaction mixture over each tissue slide, spread the solution so that the whole sample is covered. Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h. Protect from light.\nAfter incubation, rinse the slide three times with 1x PBS and dry the region around the sample using paper towels.",
    "Add 50 µL of DAPI 1:1000 to the samples, for nuclear counterstaining, and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Protect from light.\nRinse again three times with 1x PBS and dry the region around the sample.\nMount the slide with an anti-fade hydrophilic medium, place a coverslip, and seal with nail polish. Store slides horizontally, protected from light at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The anti-fade properties of the mounting medium are to preserve the fluorescence of the samples but is possible to use any hydrophilic medium available. The final sealing step with nail polish is crucial to avoid dehydration.\nVisualize the samples under a fluorescence microscope. For this type of fluorescent pigment, use an excitation wavelength in the range of 520-560 nm (green) and detection in the range of 570-620 nm (red)."
