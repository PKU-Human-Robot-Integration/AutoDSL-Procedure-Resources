    "The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan (protocol no: IACUC-110082).\n1. Animal preparation and anesthesia\nConditions for porcine selection: Select Duroc-Landrace pigs at age of 3 to 4 months old and weighing 18 to 30 kg.\nPreparation before the experiment: Fast the pigs for 8 h without food and 2 h without water before anesthesia.\nAnesthesia induction: Administer 2 mg/kg Tiletamine/Zolazepam via intramuscular route 30 min before surgery\n\tNOTE: Neuromuscular block agents were not used during anesthesia induction.\nEndotracheal tube selection: Use a 6.0 mm commercial electromyography (EMG) endotracheal tube (the recording electrodes) in the manner routinely used clinically.\nIntubation: Let the anesthesiologist intubate the recording electrodes with the assistance of direct laryngoscopy in the prone position. In this study, the endotracheal tube was fixed at 24 cm through end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) monitoring and chest auscultation to ensure the appropriate tube location.\nAnesthesia maintenance: Position the pig on its back, extend the neck, and fix the endotracheal tube. Set the tidal volume to 8 to 12 mL/kg and a 15 to 20 breaths per minute respiratory rate. Use 1% to 2% sevoflurane for general anesthesia maintenance.\n\t​NOTE: Neuromuscular block agents were not used during anesthesia maintenance.\nDuring the experiment, in addition to continuous monitoring of the animal's core body temperature, it is important to ensure that the experimental temperature is within an appropriate range. If the animal experiences a drop in body temperature, immediate thermal support such as a warm blanket should be provided.\n2. Animal operation (Figure 1 and Figure 2)\nVerify a surgical plane of anesthesia.\nSkin incision: Make a 15 cm transverse cervical incision on the skin 1 cm above the sternum (Figure 1A).\nRaise the subplastysmal flap to the hyoid bone level.",
    "Separate the strap muscles via the midline approach, and retract laterally to visualize the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, tracheal rings, and thyroid gland.\n\tNOTE: The edges of the strap muscles need to be dissected carefully and neatly for TG studies.\nAfter exposure, dissect the sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCMs) bilaterally (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: The edges of the SCMs need to be dissected carefully and neatly for EP studies.\nIdentify, expose, and dissect along the recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) and vagus nerves (VNs) bilaterally (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: IONM can assist with this step.\nPerform the experiments of EP and TG studies following step 4 and step 5.\nAfter completing the whole experiment, keep the piglets under 4%-6% sevoflurane and humanely euthanize them by an overdose of Tiletamine/Zolazepam (6 mg/kg).\n3. Surgical energy devices (SEDs) information and settings\nFor the details regarding SEDs refer to the Table of Materials.\n\t​NOTE: This study uses Advanced bipolar SEDs (referenced as Device A) to demonstrate the EP and TG studies.\n4. Electrophysiological (EP) study\nContinuous IONM setting (Figure 3)\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the recording electrodes are intubated as mentioned in step 1.5.\n\t\nInstall the ground electrodes outside the surgical incision wound.\nInstall the stimulating electrodes: Install a 2.0 mm automatic periodic stimulation (APS) electrode on one side of the VN.\nConnect all electrodes on the interconnection box, and check that the interconnection box is connected to the monitoring system (Nerve Integrity Monitoring system) and that the power of the monitoring system is on (Figure 3A).\nConfirm that the monitoring system shows that the electrodes are connected correctly.\nSelect the Monitoring page, and click on Advanced Settings.",
    "Click APS to set APS Stimulation to 1/min for slow rate, 1/s for fast rate, and Alarm Limits to 50% and 2000 µV for amplitudes, 10% for latency. Then click on OK to finish the settings.\n\t\tNOTE: The setting of other columns depends on the experimenter.\nClick on Events Capture in the Events column, and set the event threshold at 100 µV.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 3B demonstrates the protocol steps 4.1.5-4.1.7.\nFind the Vagus APS Stim column, and set the current of stimulation at 1.0 mA. Click on Baseline; a new window, Establishing APS Baseline, will appear on the right side of the screen.\nInput the Session Title and Session Comments. Select the channel to be tested, and the system will automatically start to measure 20 times. The baseline amplitude and latency will be automatically calculated and shown. Click on Accept if the baseline is correct.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 3C demonstrates the protocol steps 4.1.8-4.1.9.\nClick on the Fast Forward icon in Vagus APS Stim column to start a test. After each EP experiment, click on the Pulse icon to stop recordings.\nSelect the Reports page and set the report output format to save the file to USB.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample C-IONM report is shown in Figure 3D.\nEP activation study (Figure 4)\n\t\nDevelop experimental guidelines before starting an experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 4A shows a common EP activation study protocol example, which can be adjusted according to SED characteristics. For some instruments with activation cycles, the single activation time is a single activation cycle, mostly ranging from 2-4 s. Most SEDs do not have an activation cycle, and the single activation time is 3 s.\nActivation distance tests at 5 mm:\n\t\t\nApply the SED on the soft tissue at a distance of 5 mm from the RLN and activate SED (single activation).",
    "Observe the EMG change. Operate at the same activation distance three times unless a substantial EMG amplitude change occurs.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Figure 4B shows the activation distance test at 5 mm.\nActivation distance tests at 2 mm:\n\t\t\nApply the SED on the soft tissue close to the RLN at 1 mm distance and activate SED (single activation).\nObserve the EMG change. Operate at the same activation distance three times unless a substantial EMG amplitude change occurs.\nActivation distance tests at 1 mm:\n\t\t\nApply the SED on the soft tissue at a distance of 1 mm from the RLN, and activate SED (single activation).\nObserve the EMG change. Operate at the same activation distance three times unless a substantial EMG amplitude change occurs\nIf a substantial decrease of EMG amplitude is observed during steps 4.2.2-4.2.4, stop the RLN experiment. Record the real-time EMG continuously for 20-60 min to determine whether the injury is reversible. (Figure 4C)\nManually record the experimental results as a table (Table 1).\nEP cooling study (Figure 5)\n\t\nDevelop experimental guidelines before starting an experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 5A shows a common EP cooling study protocol example, which can be adjusted according to SED characteristics.\nCooling time tests of 5 s:\n\t\t\nApply SED single activation to the SCM muscle. Touch the RLN with the tip of the SED after 5 s of waiting and cooling.\nObserve the EMG change. Operate at the same cooling time three times unless a substantial EMG amplitude change occurs.\nCooling time tests of 2 s:\n\t\t\nApply SED single activation to the SCM muscle. Touch the RLN with the tip of the SED after 2 s of waiting and cooling.\nObserve the EMG change. Operate at the same cooling time three times unless a substantial EMG amplitude change occurs.",
    "NOTE: Figure 5B shows the cooling time test of 2 s.\nProceed immediately with muscle touch maneuver (MTM) tests:\n\t\t\nApply SED single activation to the SCM muscle. Quickly touch (approximately 1 s) the activated surface of the SED with another position of the SCM (MTM, Figure 5C).\nTouch the RLN with the tip of the SED immediately after MTM and observe the EMG change. Operate at the same cooling time three times unless a substantial EMG amplitude change occurs.\nProceed immediately without muscle touch maneuver (MTM) tests:\n\t\t\nApply SED single activation to the SCM muscle. Touch the RLN with the tip of the SED immediately without MTM.\nObserve the EMG change. Operate the same cooling time three times unless a substantial EMG amplitude change occurs. If a substantial decrease of EMG amplitude is observed, follow step 4.3.6.\nIf a substantial decrease of EMG amplitude is observed, stop the RLN experiment. Then, continuously monitor the real-time EMG response for at least 20 min to determine whether the RLN injury is reversible or not. (Figure 5D)\nManually record the experimental results as a table (Table 2).\n5. Thermographic (TG) study\nSet up the thermal imaging system (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: Thermal imaging camera with temperature sensitivity up to a temperature range of -20 °C to 650 °C. The image is updated every second.\n\t\nPlace the camera 50 cm from the target tissue at an angle of 60° from the experimental table (Figure 6A).\n\t\tNOTE: In the operating field, measured by a thermal imaging camera, the temperature is displayed according to the color scale. The location with the highest temperature on the screen is marked with a \"+\" sign, and its corresponding temperature is displayed (Figure 6B)\nSelect Video Mode, and press the capture button.",
    "NOTE: The procedures monitored by the thermal camera are continuously recorded in video form.\nConduct the animal preparation for the TG study:\n\t\nRecord the background temperature of the experimental area using the thermal imaging camera. The background temperature should be in the range of 25 ± 2 °C (Figure 6C). If the background temperature exceeds this range, adjust the temperature of the laboratory air conditioner and test again.\nStandard strap muscle thickness for SED activation: Prepare the strap muscles for the TG study as described in step 2.3. The standard strap muscle thickness for SED activation is 5 mm (Figure 6D).\nTG activation study (Figure 6 and Figure 7)\n\t\nDry environment tests: Wipe the surface of porcine strap muscles with dry gauze.\n\t\t\nWhole blade tests in a dry environment (Figure 7A):\n\t\t\t\nGrasp the strap muscle at the full length of the blade using SED (Figure 6E).\nEvaluate maximum activation temperature: After a single activation, the maximum temperature is shown on the screen during the measurement (Figure 7B).\nEvaluate lateral thermal spread: Measure the diameter of the 60 °C isothermal line after a single activation.\nEvaluate smoke and splashing: After a single activation, when the highest temperature on the screen exceeds 60 °C, record any smoke and splash on the screen. Repeat five measurements in different areas.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Maximum activation temperature was evaluated with whole blade tests in a dry environment only.\nOne-third (1/3) of blade tests in a dry environment (Figure 7C):\n\t\t\t\nGrasp the strap muscle with an anterior 1/3-length blade using SED (Figure 6F). Evaluate the lateral thermal spread, smoke, and splashing (Figure 7D) as described in step 5.3.1.1. Repeat five measurements in different areas.\nWet environment tests: Soak the porcine strap muscles in sterile water for 3 s just before SED activation.",
    "Whole blade tests in a wet environment (Figure 7E): Grasp the strap muscle at full length of the blade using SED and evaluate the lateral thermal spread (Figure 7F), smoke, and splashing as described in step 5.3.1.1. Repeat five measurements in different areas.\nOne-third (1/3) tests in a wet environment (Figure 7G): Grasp the strap muscle with an anterior 1/3-length blade using SED and evaluate the lateral thermal spread, smoke (Figure 7H), and splashing as described in step 5.3.1.1. Repeat five measurements at different areas.\nManually record the experimental results as a table (Table 3).\nTG cooling study (Figure 8)\n\t\nDry environment: Wipe the surface of porcine strap muscles with dry gauze as in step 5.3.1.\n\t\tNOTE: In the TG cooling study, all activations were performed in a dry environment with whole blade activation.\nEvaluate minimum cooling time without MTM: After SED single activation with the whole blade on strap muscle, start recording the cooling time until the highest temperature on the screen was less than 60 °C. Repeat five measurements in different areas.\n\t\tNOTE: When measuring the cooling time and temperature of the SED blade after single activation and MTM, cover the SED-activated muscle area and the MTM-contacting muscle area with gauze, as the high temperature in these areas will be detected up on the TG screen and interfere with the temperature that is to be actually measured.\nEvaluate the blade temperature after MTM: After a single activation of the SED with the whole blade on the strap muscle, quickly touch (~1 s) the activated surface of the SED with another position of the strap muscle (Figure 8A). Then record its temperature immediately after leaving the SED from the strap muscle with the blade open (Figure 8B).",
    "Evaluate the minimum cooling time with MTM: After step 5.4.3, when the temperature is more than 60 °C, start recording the cooling time until the highest temperature on the screen is less than 60 °C. Repeat five measurements in different areas.\nManually record the experimental results as a table (Table 4).\n6. Data interpretations\nPresent the EP and TG safety parameters in table form with smoke and splashing marked.\n\tNOTE: Here, the EP and TG safety parameters of SED are presented in table form, and smoke and splashing are marked with * and # symbols, respectively. In EP and TG studies, the final result lists the maximum data as in Table 5."
