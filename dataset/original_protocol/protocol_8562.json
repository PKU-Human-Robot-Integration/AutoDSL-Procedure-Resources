    "The deceased are included here as a population, although deceased persons are not technically human subjects; human subjects are defined by 45 CF 46 as \"living human beings15,16.\"\n1. Preparation of Specimens\nExamine 5 formalin-fixed brains (10 hemispheres) and 2 whole human heads.\nFix the specimens in a 10% formalin solution for at least 2 months according to Klingler's method17.\nFreeze all specimens at -16 ˚C for 2 weeks in accordance with Klinger's method17.\nThaw the specimens under tap water.\nPerform an extended frontotemporal craniotomy on the cadaveric head to expose the brain.\nPlace the cadaveric head in a three-pin skull clamp (Material Table).\nMake a frontotemporal skin incision with a scalpel.\nRemove the skin and muscles using a scalpel, forceps, and scissors.\nMake one or more burr holes in the skull until the dura mater is reached; use a drill with a compact speed reducer and a 14 mm cranial perforator attachment at 79,000 rpm (Material Table).\nCut the bone flap and open the skull using a 2 mm x 15.6 mm fluted router with a 2.1 mm pin-shaped burr attachment at a drill speed of 80,000 rpm (Material Table).\nRemove the dura, arachnoid, and pia mater and dissect using a microdissector under a microscope at 6X to 40X magnification5,18\n (Material Table).\n2. Fiber Dissection Technique\nNOTE: Perform all dissections under 6X to 40X magnification on a surgical microscope.\nPerform the fiber dissections in a stepwise manner on each hemisphere, from lateral to medial and medial to lateral.\nDecorticate the cerebral cortex using a panfield dissector (Material Table) and remove all frontal cortical tissues to expose the short association fiber tracts, which are U-fibers or intergyral fibers that interconnect neighboring gyri5,13.",
    "Remove the short association fibers with a panfield dissector and a surgical micro hook by gently trimming under the microscope (Material Table) to reach and expose the long association fibers, which interconnect distant areas in the same hemisphere.\nGo deep into the long association fibers to remove the superficial association fibers using a surgical micro hook and a panfield dissector; remove each fiber bundle under a microscope (Material Table) to expose the projection commissural fibers.\nView each of the connections of the SMA complex according to the topographical anatomy that was previously defined in the literature2,8,18,19,20,21.\nKeep all specimens (whole heads and brains) that were used during the dissections in 10% formaldehyde solution (Material Table) between the dissection periods.\n3. 3D Photography Technique\nUse a black color platform during the photography of the specimens.\nFollow a 3D photography technique22.\nPlace each specimen in a designed black color platform.\nSelect a scene with a full-frontal view of the specimen and take one shot by focusing the camera on any point on the specimen close to the center point on the camera screen (instrument table). Use an 18- to 55-mm f/3.5-5.6 SLR lens or a 100 mm f/2.8L macro lens and set the aperture to F29, ISO 100.\nRotate the camera slightly left until the right-most point on the camera screen is the same as the focusing point above. Slide the camera to the right until the middle point on the screen overlaps the original focusing point on the specimen. Focus the camera on this point and take another shot.\nMaintain the distance and axis of the camera to the specimen being photographed at constant values.\nCreate a 3D image by using a 3D image generator program (Material Table).\nOpen the 3D software program.\nChoose \"Open stereo images from File.\"",
    "Select the two images (left and right) and make sure the left image is in the left slot and the right image is in the right slot.\nSelect the \"Half color anaglyph RL/2\" option and generate the anaglyph in jpeg format.\n4. DTI Technique\nAcquire pre-processed diffusion data utilizing the Human Connectome Project diffusion data23 by downloading it from the referenced website.\n\tNOTE: The data is downloaded pre-processed and consisted of the following procedures: The diffusion data was acquired in normal volunteers using a modified 3 T MRI device (instrument table) utilizing a spin-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with multi-band image acceleration24,25,26,27,28. Relevant sequence parameters include: TR = 5,520 ms; TE = 89.5 ms; FOV = 210 x 180 mm; matrix = 168 x 144; slice thickness = 1.25 mm (voxel size 1.25 x 1.25 x 1.25 mm); multiband factor = 3; and b-values = 1,000 s/mm2(95 directions), 2,000 s/mm2(96 directions), and 3,000 s/mm2(97 directions). The data was then processed utilizing FreeSurfer29and FSL30; the process included eddy current correction, motion correction, b0 intensity normalization, susceptibility distortion correction, and gradient-nonlinearity correction28,31,32,33. Corresponding T1-weighted MP-RAGE images are also included in the download package. Procedures are documented in the Human Connectome Project procedures manual23.\nPost-process the diffusion data using Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) Studio34to generate an estimated voxel-wise diffusion orientation distribution function (ODF) employing a generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) algorithm35.\nLoad the downloaded dataset into the software by selecting \"STEP1: Open source images\" and selecting the data.nii.gz file.\nSelect the \"STEP2: Reconstruction\" button. After verifying the brain mask, proceed to \"Step 2\" and select \"GQI\" as the reconstruction method. Select \"r^2 weighting\" with a \"length ratio\" of \"1.0.\" Leave the remaining selections as the default.\nSelect \"Run reconstruction.\"\nPlace appropriate seeds for regions-of-interest to streamline fiber-tracking.",
    "In the \"Region Window,\" click the \"Atlas\" button to place seeds for the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) I. Select \"Brodmann\" and add \"Region 6\" and \"Region 7.\" In the region window, set the \"Region 6\" type to \"seed\" and the \"Region 7\" type to \"region-of-inclusions\" (ROI).\n\t\t\nSelect \"New Region\" in the region window and manually draw an ROI in the most posterior aspect of the superior frontal gyrus in the coronal plane. Perform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4.\nPlace seeds for SLF II in similar fashion by using \"New Region\" in the region window and drawing the \"seed\" region in the posterior aspect of the middle frontal gyrus white matter in the coronal plane. Choose an ROI using \"Atlas\" (as in step 4.3.1) and Brodmann regions 9, 10, 46, 39, and 19. Perform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4.\nPlace seeds for SLF III with a \"seed\" region, using \"Atlas\" (as in step 4.3.1) in the region window and choosing \"Region 40\" of the Brodmann atlas and the ROI from \"Atlas…\" in \"Region 40\" and \"Region 44.\" Perform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4.\nPlace seeds for callosal fibers using \"New Region\" in the region window and drawing a \"seed\" in the sagittal plane encompassing the corpus callosum. Perform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4.\nPlace seeds for cingulate fibers using \"New Region\" in the region window and drawing a \"seed\" region in the mid-cingulate gyrus on the coronal view. Use \"New Region\" to draw two ROIs, one in the more anterior cingulate and one in the posterior cingulate gyrus under coronal view. Perform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4.",
    "Place seeds for claustrocortical fibers using \"New Region\" in the region window and drawing a \"seed\" in the claustrum with an ROI in the corona radiata using the \"Atlas…\" function. Select the atlas as \"JHU-WhiteMatter-labels-1mm.\"\n\t\t\nSelect and add the \"Anterior_corona_radiata\", \"Posterior_corona_radiata,\" and \"Superior_corona_radiata\". Draw a region-of-avoidance for all fibers passing through a plane inferior to the level of the claustrum in the axial plane using \"New Region\" in the region window. Perform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4.\nPlace seeds for the corticospinal tract using a \"seed\" from the \"Atlas...\" function in the region window; select \"JHU-WhiteMatter-labels-1mm\" and add the \"Corticospinal_tract\" region. Perform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4.\nPlace seeds for the frontal aslant tract (FAT) using a \"seed\" region from the \"Atlas...\" function in the region window and selecting the Brodmann atlas and \"Region 6\" ROIs in \"Region 44\" and \"Region 45.\" Perform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4.\nPlace seeds for the frontostriatal tract (FST) with a \"seed\" in \"Region 6\" using the \"Atlas...\" function. Insert new regions in the \"caudate,\" \"putamen,\" and \"globus pallidus\" from the \"HarvardOxfordSub\" atlas and set the type in the region window to \"end.\"\n\t\t​NOTE: Fiber tracking for FST will be performed by selecting the Region 6 seed and only one of the subcortical seeds per tracking session (i.e., region 6 and the caudate, followed by region 6 and the putamen, and lastly region 6 and the globus pallidus).\n\t\t\nPerform fiber tracking as described in step 4.4 for each combination.\nPerform fiber tracking for each of the above combinations.",
    "In the \"Options\" window, set the tracking parameters as: termination index of qa of 0.08, angular threshold of 75, step size of 0.675, smoothing of 0.2, minimum length of 20 mm, and maximum length of 200 mm. Select the seed orientation as \"All,\" the seed position as \"Subvoxel,\" and randomize seeding as \"On.\" Use trilinear direction interpolation with a streamline (Euler) tracking algorithm. For each combination of regions above, choose \"Run tracking\" in the \"Fiber Tracts\" window.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the randomized nature of the tracking, clear \"false fibers\" are identified and selectively removed, with regions-of-avoidance drawn by hand as a \"New Region.\"\nAffine register the brain-extracted T1-weighted 3D MP-RAGE scan provided in the Human Connectome Project data set to the diffusion data using the \"Slices -> Insert T1/T2 Images\" function of DSI-Studio. Generate a surface rendering of the brain by selecting \"Slices -> Add Isosurface.\" Use a \"threshold\" of 665.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
