    "Cell CultureNote: The cells, unless otherwise noted, are grown in 10% FBS with 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.Generate glioma conditioned media (GCM) using GL261 murine glioma cells which are grown to 80-90% confluency and serum starved for 24 h. The media are collected and stored at -80 °C until use.Generate L cell media by collecting it from L929 cells grown to 90-100% confluency and maintained for 10 days. These media are rich in colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), a factor used to drive proliferation and differentiation of monocytic cells into macrophages.Monocytes are cultured from adult C57Bl/6 mice as previously described (Zhang et al., 2008): Briefly, animals are deeply anesthetized with 2.5% avertin and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Femurs and tibiae are dissected, and the internal bone cavity is flushed with 1% serum in Hank’s Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS). The collected bone marrow is filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer and plated in complete media containing DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 20% L cell media (or 100 U/ml recombinant M-CSF).Cells are kept at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Macrophage differentiation is achieved after 7-9 days of culture.Phagocytosis assayExperiment 1: Macrophages are plated on glass coverslips and incubated with either complete media, as described above, or complete media plus 50% GCM for 24 h.Experiment 2: Macrophages, as above, are incubated with saline (control) or both 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma) and 100 U/ml IFNγ (Roche) for 24 h.Fluorescent latex beads (carboxylate-modified polystyrene, fluorescent red; 0.5-μm mean particle size, Sigma,  L3280  ) are added to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml, and incubated for 2 h. After rinsing with HBSS to remove excess beads, cells are fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 20 min.",
    "Fixed cells are rinsed with PBS and blocked for 1 h in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum. They are incubated with anti-Iba1 (1:500, Wako) in 0.01% Triton X-100 and 30 mg/ml BSA overnight at 4 °C.The cells are then rinsed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit for 1 h.Cells are rinsed again with PBS and coverslipped using DAPI Fluormount (Southern Biotech).Confocal ImagingImages are acquired on a Leica SP8X confocal imaging system. 10 µm z-stacks are taken at 40x at a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels. Confocal images are processed using Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012). For this procedure, five fields are imaged, and at least 100 cells are quantified in total per treatment. For evaluation of phagocytosis, total number of cells, and number of cells with internalized beads are counted. The images are further analyzed by counting the number of beads per cell, and measuring cell area and the integrated density of sum-projected pixels from the fluorescent bead channel. Integrated density values are analyzed for outliers before downstream analysis. The step-by-step image analysis protocol is provided in Supplementary document 1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/doc/upprotocol/p3124/Abstract10_0_20220222105241799/3698%20Supplementary%20document%201.docx]."
