    "NOTE: The following steps describe a cell culture protocol. Please perform under sterile conditions and use pre-warmed media.\n1. Cardiac Differentiation of hiPSC\nCultivate the hiPSC\nCoat 6-well plates (1 mL/well) or T75 flasks (7 mL/flask) with reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix (e.g. geltrex, 1:200; see table of materials) diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) for 30 min at 37 °C. Prepare FTDA medium12 by mixing basic DMEM/F-12 medium with 2 mM L-Glutamine, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, 5 mg/L transferrin, 5 µg/L selenium, 0.1% human serum albumin, 1x lipid-mix, 5 mg/L insulin, 50 nM dorsomorphin, 2.5 ng/mL activin A, 0.5 ng/mL human TGFß1 and 30 ng/mL FGF2.\nSeed hiPSC (~3 x 105/ 10 cm²) in FTDA medium and culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2 with daily medium change (Figure 1A). At 80% confluency, passage (1:2-1:6) with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA; 0.5 mM; incubation time ~4 min).\nFormation of embryoid bodies (EB)\nCultivate hiPSC in T75 flasks to high density.\n\t\t\nWash flasks with confluent cells twice with phosphate buffered saline without calcium and magnesium (PBS) and incubate in 0.5 mM EDTA for ~10 min. Make sure the cells do not detach from the bottom of the flask.\nRemove EDTA with glass pipette, flush off cells with 10 mL PBS, tap flasks at the bench to detach cells.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use cell scraper if necessary.\nCollect cells in 50 mL conical tube, add ¼ of volume (e.g. 10 mL RMPI to 40 mL cell suspension) RPMI 1640 medium (or any other standard medium containing 1.8 mM calcium) and centrifuge at 250 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend cell pellet in FTDA medium supplemented with 4 mg/mL polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 10 µM Y27632 and count the cells in a Neubauer chamber.",
    "Fill the spinner flask with the cell suspension (30 x 106 cells/100 mL FTDA medium supplemented with PVA and Y-27632; see step 1.2.2) and initiate EB formation in spinner flasks (adjust rotor speed of magnetic stirrer to 40 rpm) in the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 5% O2) over night.\nMesodermal differentiation\nDuring EB formation, coat cell culture flasks suitable for suspension culture with non-ionic surfactant (14 mL/T175) over night at 37 °C.\nThe next morning, wash surfactant-coated flasks twice with PBS (30 mL/T175). Add PBS again and keep in the incubator until needed.\nRemove the spinner flask from the incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell suspension should be clear with small macroscopically visible EBs (Figure 1B).\nTransfer 50 mL suspension to a 50 mL conical tube and let EBs settle for 5-20 min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 7 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% PVA and 10 µM Y-27632. Transfer suspension to a graduated 15 mL conical tube and estimate EB volume (~50-100 µL).\nTransfer contents of the spinner flasks to uncoated T175 flasks and leave this on V-shaped rack for sedimentation for up to 20 min. Remove supernatant and wash embryoid bodies as stated above. Do not fill the T175 flask with more than 200 mL as sedimentation would take too long. If initial spinner flask volume exceeds 200 mL, split EB suspension to several T175 flasks and combine EBs again after washing.\nRemove washing medium and resuspend in medium for mesodermal differentiation, that is RPMI supplemented with 4 mg/mL PVA, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 0.05% human serum albumin, 5 µg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL sodium selenite, 0.1% lipid mix, 250 µM phospho-ascorbate, 10 µM Y-27632, 10 ng/mL bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP-4), and 3 ng/mL activin A, 5 ng/mL stable FGF2.",
    "Remove PBS from surfactant-coated T175 flasks and fill with cell suspension (200 µL EBs in 40 mL). Use smaller flasks for smaller EB volume.\nCultivate EBs in suspension for three days (37 °C, 5% CO2, 5% O2). Exchange 50% of the medium (same composition as in step 1.3.7) every day (use V-shaped sedimentation rack). Prepare medium fresh every day prior to feeding.\nCardiac differentiation\nPrepare new surfactant-coated vessels the day before and handle as stated above (1.3.2).\nAfter three days of mesodermal induction, let EBs settle for up to 5 min on sedimentation rack. Remove most of the medium and wash with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin and 10 mM HEPES.\nTransfer 10 mL of EB suspension to graduated 15 mL tube and estimate EB volume after sedimentation.\nResuspend EBs carefully in cardiac differentiation medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, 0.05% human serum albumin, 5 µg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL sodium selenite, 0.1% lipid mix, 250 µM phospho-ascorbate, 1 µM Y-27632, 100 nM Wnt-inhibitor DS-I-713.\nTransfer EBs to new surfactant-coated cell culture flasks (~200 µL EBs in 46 mL/T175).\nIncubate for three days (37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2) with 50% medium change (medium composition see step 1.4.4) on the second and third day. Do not change the medium within the first 48 h.\nIncubate in medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 500 µM 1-Thioglycerol, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 µM Y-27632, 2% serum-free neural cell culture supplement (e.g. B27) with insulin, 100 nM Wnt-inhibitor DS-I-7 with daily exchange of 50% medium for the next four days. EBs should start beating within this period.",
    "After one week of cardiac differentiation, switch to the same medium without Wnt inhibition and with serum-free neural cell culture supplement. Change 50% of the medium every day, except for the first day.\nDissociation of human cardiomyocytes\n\tNOTE: After two weeks of differentiation protocol, EBs should show spontaneous contractions (Figure 1C). If so, start dissociation and prepare collagenase solution.\n\t\nPrepare collagenase solution by weighing and solving 200 U/mL in calcium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium/magnesium (HBSS) and add 1 mM HEPES, 10 µM Y-27632, 30 µM N-benzyl-p-toluene sulphonamide (BTS). Sterilize by filtering (0.2-µm filter) and store aliquots at -20 °C. Thaw aliquots at 4 °C over night.\nSettle EBs on sedimentation rack, aspirate medium and replace with 20-25 mL pre-warmed HBSS. Repeat this washing step once more.\nAspirate HBSS and replace with pre-warmed collagenase solution (15 mL/T175). Incubate for 4 h in the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2).\nPrepare blocking buffer with DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and DNase (12 µg/mL).\nTap the cell culture flasks on the bench, dissociated EBs should disintegrate and fall apart (if not, increase incubation time). Gently triturate cell suspension and transfer to a conical 50 mL tube. Wash flasks with blocking buffer (15 mL/T175) and transfer to tube.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 100 x g. Resuspend cells in warm DMEM, triturate and count cells.\n2. Generation of Engineered Heart Tissue (EHT)\nAutoclave commercially available PDMS racks and polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) spacers (see Materials and Equipment spreadsheet; Figure 2) and prepare the following solutions under sterile conditions, one day prior to EHT generation.\n\t\nPrepare 2% agarose by weighing and dissolving in appropriate volume of PBS, autoclave, immediately store at 60 °C.",
    "Prepare aprotinin (33 mg/mL) by weighing and dissolving in appropriate volume of aqua ad iniectabilia, filter sterile (0.22-µm filter), aliquot and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare fibrinogen (200 mg/mL) by dissolving sterile fibrinogen in appropriate volume of sterile 0.9% NaCl (lukewarm), aliquot and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare thrombin (100 U/mL) by dissolving sterile thrombin in three parts sterile PBS and 2 parts aqua ad iniectabilia, aliquot portions of 3 µL in small tubes and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 10x DMEM by dissolving 670 mg 10x DMEM powder in 5 mL aqua ad iniectabilia, filter sterile and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 2x DMEM by mixing 2 mL 10x DMEM with 2 mL heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.2 mL penicillin/streptomycin and 5.8 mL aqua ad iniectabilia, filter sterile and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare EHT-casting medium (ECM) by mixing DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine (200 mM), store at 4 °C.\nPrepare casting molds in 24-well plates by pipetting 1.6 mL warm agarose (2%, PBS) and placing the PTFE spacer (Figure 2A) into the wells.\n\tNOTE: Place spacer immediately after pipetting into a maximum of 8 wells - agarose solidifies very fast. Do not leave the agarose at room temperature for longer than 5 min.\nAfter agarose solidification (~10 min, agarose will turn opaque), remove the PTFE spacers (Figure 2C) and place the PDMS racks (Figure 2B) into the casting molds so that pairs of PDMS posts reach into each mold (Figure 2D).\nResuspend the cardiomyocytes in ECM with a minimum concentration of 15 x 106 cells/mL.",
    "Prepare 110% of the estimated volume of reconstitution mix in a round bottom 15-mL tube on ice.For 24 EHTs, pipette the reconstitution mix listed in Table 1 for human, rat or mouse cardiomyocytes, respectively (10% extra is included).\n\tNOTE: Cell concentration of the reconstitution mix is different for human (10 x 106 cells/mL), rat (4.1 x 106 cells/mL) and mouse (6.8 x 106 cells/mL) EHTs. Depending on the concentration of the cell suspension, add additional ECM to a final volume of 2,640 µL. Fibrinogen has to be lukewarm for pipetting. Slowly fill the tip of the pipet and do not touch the surface of the cold reconstitution mix with the fibrinogen-containing pipet when adding fibrinogen to the reconstitution mix - the viscosity of the fibrinogen in the pipette tip would increase immediately.\nTriturate the reconstitution mix 10 - 15 times with a serological pipette until the fibrinogen clot is dissolved. Check the reconstitution mix in the pipette for homogeneity.\nFor each EHT, pipet 100 µL reconstitution mix in one thrombin aliquot (3 µL in 200 µL tube), mix and pipet the mixture into the agarose-slots as quickly as possible (Figure 2E). Use a new filter tip for each EHT. Resuspend the reconstitution mix (trituration with serological pipette 5-10 times) after every 8 EHTs.\nOnce all slots are filled with reconstitution mix, close the lid of the cell culture dish and incubate at 37 °C, 7% CO2 for 2 h.\nRemove the plate from the incubator and place under a sterile hood. Cover each well with a small amount of medium (e.g. DMEM, approximately 200 - 500 µL), shake the plate gently and incubate again at 37 °C for at least 10 min. The addition of DMEM will ease the removal from fibrin gels from agarose casting molds.",
    "Prepare a new 24-well plate with 1.5 mL EHT-medium per well consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 µg/mL insulin, 33 µg/mL aprotinin.\nCarefully remove the PDMS racks from the agarose casting molds and transfer them to the medium-filled 24-well plate (Figure 2F). Place the dish back in the incubator (37 °C, 7% CO2, 40% O2 for human and rat EHTs, 21% O2 for mouse EHTs) and feed Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays with freshly prepared EHT-medium. EHTs should show spontaneous contractions deflecting the posts of the PDMS racks 7-10 days after casting (Figure 1D, 2G).\nFor mouse EHTs add 25 µg/mL of 5-cytosine βDarabinofuranoside to culture medium for 48 h to limit fibroblast proliferation.\n3. Contraction Analysis\nNOTE: The contraction analysis is based on video-optical recording in a commercially available EHT analysis instrument (see Table of materials). The central unit of this instrument is an incubation chamber (Figure 3A). The software provided with the instrument calculates contraction force based on deflection of the PDMS posts with known elastic modulus and geometry11 (Supplementary Figure 1).\nTurn on the heating device of the machine 2 h prior to the measurement. Turn on gas supply and electronic supply of the axis system immediately prior to the contraction analysis.\nFor baseline recording (reference point in the analysis), place the 24-well-plate with the EHTs in EHT-medium into the EHT analysis instrument and start the contraction analysis software according to supplier manual.\nClick the \"Protocol\" tab on the right panel and enter relevant information regarding study name, user, species, cell type, age, recording length and additional remarks.",
    "Click the \"Camera view\" tab on the left panel and start camera live mode with automatic figure detection mode. Click the \"Setup\" tab on the right panel andadjust the camera position with the xyz coordinates for each well in the 24-well-dish. Make sure the EHT is in the center of the window and in focus of the camera.\n\t\t\nMake sure the lid of the cell culture dish is not foggy as this will impair figure recognition and contraction analysis.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The figure recognition algorithm is based on detecting high contrast areas and monitoring their change in position. In the software these areas of figure recognition will be marked with a blue cross that moves with the contractions of the EHT.\nMake sure that the positions of the blue crosses are at both the top and bottom ends of the EHTs and moving only vertically matching the contractions of the EHTs (Figure 3B). Save setup positions of each well by pressing the button \"position ok\".\nNext, click the \"Parameters\" tab on the left panel. The parameters displayed here define the criteria by which the software identifies a contraction peak and marks it with a green square. These values are very important for correct identification of contraction peaks (Figure 3C) and no false data points (Figure 3E-F).\n\t\tNOTE: A list of species dependent parameters and examples is depicted in Figure 3H. For further details, please consult the software manual.\nClick the \"Automatic\" tab on the right panel and initiate the analysis by activating the \"Start\" button. The software will move sequentially from one well to the next, record EHT contractions and calculate force during recording (displayed in the \"Real time\" tab on the left panel). At the end of the analysis, a pdf report summarizing the results will be generated automatically.",
    "Save and analyze the pdf report the system generated to summarize the results.\nMonitor the contractile parameters by repeated measurement over several days. The EHT will increase in contraction force until it has reached a plateau (usually around day 15 of culture).\nDrug screening\nPrepare protein free Tyrode solution one day prior to measurement and equilibrate in 24-well plates (2 mL/well) in the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 7% CO2, 40% O2) over night: 120 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1-5 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM NaH2PO4, 22.6 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM glucose, 0.05 mM Na2EDTA, 25 mM HEPES. Add calcium up to 1.8 mM or the previously determined [EC50] to investigate positive inotropic effects.\nWeigh and dissolve the drug in DMSO and filter sterile, if necessary. Prepare 6 different 1000x-sub-stock solutions (in DMSO) of the working concentration (e.g. 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 µM for the respective nanomolar range).\nDilute the respective stock in the Tyrode plates (2 µL in each 2 mL well) and mix thoroughly. Place the plates back in the incubator until needed.\nStart the baseline measurement by taking the first Tyrode-filled 24-well-plate under the sterile hood and position carbon electrodes in the wells. Transfer the PDMS racks with the EHTs placed on top of carbon electrodes, close the lid, put the plate back in the incubator and wait for an equilibration period of ~ 30 min.\nTransfer the EHTs from the incubator to the interlock in the EHT analysis instrument. Close the instrument and record spontaneous baseline contractility (20 s/EHT).",
    "Connect the carbon electrodes to the pacing cable and start electrical stimulation of the EHTs (2.5 V, 4 ms impulse duration, human: ~1 Hz, rat: ~2 Hz, mouse: ~4 Hz). Record the \"paced\" baseline (10 s/EHT). Ensure that all EHTs are properly paced. Stimulation frequency and voltage might vary from cell line to cell line.\nAfter baseline recording, remove the EHTs from the instrument and transfer the electrodes with the PDMS racks on top, to the 24-well-plate with the first drug concentration. Transfer the EHTs back onto the interlock of the EHT analysis instrument immediately and incubate there (standard drug incubation time e.g. 20 min).\nReconnect pacing cables, adjust figure recognition and record EHT contractions responding to the first drug concentration.\nFor the following drug concentrations, repeat step 3.5.7 and 3.5.8 with the 24-well-plates containing higher drug concentrations.\nSave all pdf recordings. Check each recording for figure recognition, correct positioning of green squares identifying contraction peaks and artifacts (see 3.2.1 and Figure 3).\nPerform additional offline analysis if needed.\nChoose the respective run from the \"Runs\" database on the left panel by clicking \"Select run\". In the \"Parameter\" tab on the left, change parameter for contraction analysis. Now choose \"Offline analysis\" in the \"Offline\" tab on the right panel to reanalyze the videos.\nTo adjust figure recognition and therefore record a new video file, choose \"Sample review\" after adjusting the figure recognition in the \"Real time\" tab. NOTE: Sample review can only reanalyze one well at a time, whereas offline analysis can apply new parameter for all wells by clicking the button \"Use parameter on all wells\" in the \"Parameter\" panel on the left. Both types of offline analyzes will automatically create new data files and pdf displaying the results.",
    "Analyze the experiment by combining the results of the biological replicates and summarize the data in concentration response curves for frequency, contraction force, contraction time and relaxation time (Figure 5D) and/or graphical display of average contraction peaks (Figure 5C).\n\t\tNOTE: PDMS racks and PTFE spacer can be used repeatedly (PDMS racks max. 5 times, and PTFE spacer endlessly). After use, clean them manually with water, boil twice in demineralized water and autoclave. Be aware of potential carry-over effects, when re-using the racks, as drugs might be absorbed by the PDMS.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
