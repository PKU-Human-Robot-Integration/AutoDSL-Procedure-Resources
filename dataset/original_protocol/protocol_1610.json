    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSet up reagents and materials\nTiming: 30 min\nPrepare all necessary buffers (Bone collection buffer, red blood cell lysis buffer, resuspension buffer, neutrophil culture medium).\nSterilize all the tools for dissection by soaking them in 70% EtOH.\nUsing a 20-gauge needle, poke three holes into the bottom of a 0.5mL microcentrifuge tube. Place this tube into a clean 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. Prepare one set of microcentrifuge tubes for each sample (Amend et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nLabel 15mL conical tubes, one for each sample.\nPrepare 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes with 15uL of trypan blue, two for each sample.\nBone marrow neutrophil collection\nTiming: 3 h (to process 10 animals)\nNote: For the bone marrow neutrophil purification we use a magnetic purification with the Miltenyi negative selection bone marrow neutrophil purification kit, a well-supported method in the field (Kimmey et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Mishra et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Ponzetta et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Spolski et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Yee et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Koss et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Alternative magnetic-based isolation kits exist (e.g. Stemcell’s EasySep Mouse Neutrophil Enrichment Kit, Biolegend’s MojoSort Mouse Neutrophil Isolation Kit). Flow cytometry-based cell sorting [FACS] is of course another option for isolation of primary neutrophils. However, FACS can be impractical when large animal cohorts (>10) are processed, due to increased time for processing, which may lead to circadian differences and other transcriptional alterations between mice processed earlier versus later in the cohort.\nNote: Here, we provide quantification examples for a cohort of 10 mice. We have successfully applied this protocol to both sexes across a range of ages.\nThis step details how to collect and isolate mouse bone marrow neutrophils.\nAliquot 3mL of bone collection buffer into one well of a 6-well plate for each sample. Keep the plate on ice.",
    "Euthanize each mouse according to the procedures approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). In our lab, mice are euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.\nAfter ensuring euthanasia, place the mouse in a prone position and extract the femurs and tibias. Remove all skin, muscle, and tendons using sterile tools and clean paper towels (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1173-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation and purity check of bone marrow neutrophils\n(A) Diagram displaying the process of dissecting the tibia and femur from a mouse, cleaning the muscle off the bones, and flushing the marrow out using centrifugation.\n(B and C) Bone marrow neutrophils from 3-months-old female C57BL/6J mice were then purified using the Miltenyi Biotec Neutrophil Isolation kit and checked for purity using CD11b and Ly6G antibodies.\n(D and E) Bone marrow neutrophils were then purified from two 5-months-old female mice using either the Stemcell EasySep Neutrophil Enrichment kit or the Miltenyi Biotec Neutrophil Isolation kit and checked for purity using CD11b and Ly6G antibodies. To perform the comparison reported in (D and E), we used mice carrying a floxed allele for Foxl2 on the C57BL/6 background from our colony at USC. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using Flowlogic v8.\nPut the cleaned bones into one well of the 6-well plate containing bone collection buffer on ice for each animal.\nAfter collection and cleaning of all bones, cut the epiphyses of the bones with small scissors and place the bones cut side down into the 0.5mL/1.5mL collection tube.\nFlush the bone marrow out by centrifuging for 30 s at 10,000g between 20°C-25°C.\nDiscard the bones and resuspend the collected sample in 1mL of resuspension buffer while minimizing air bubbles which can activate neutrophils. Carefully transfer the 1mL suspension to a 15mL conical tube.",
    "Lyse red blood cells using 10mL of Red Blood Cell Lysis buffer for 1mL of suspension. Carefully invert to mix and incubate for 2 min between 20°C-25°C.\nNote: DO NOT vortex the cells, as mechanical stress will cause spurious neutrophil activation.\nCentrifuge at 300×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nPrepare a 70 μM filter by rinsing it with 2mL of resuspension buffer.\nRemove the supernatant by aspiration and resuspend the pellet in 5mL of resuspension buffer.\nFilter the 5mL suspension on 70 μM mesh filters to retain only single cells for downstream processing.\nAdd an additional 5mL of resuspension buffer onto the filter.\nCentrifuge the sample at 300×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1mL of resuspension buffer.\nTake 15 μL of the 1mL suspension and add this to one of the 15 μL of trypan blue in 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes. Slowly pipette up and down to mix. Repeat for each sample.\nTake 15 μL from the trypan blue/sample mix and insert this into one of the wells of the COUNTESS chamber slide. Count the cells and check for viability using the COUNTESS.\nNote: In the case that a COUNTESS machine is not available, other cell counting methods can be used (e.g. using other automated cell counters, or manual counts with hemocytometers).\nIsolate the neutrophils from the suspension using the Miltenyi Biotec Neutrophil Isolation Kit, LS columns and quadroMACS magnets, following the manufacturer’s directions.\nNote: Be sure to minimize mechanical stress and bubbles during the entire isolation step to maximize viable neutrophil recovery.\nTake 15 μL of the isolated neutrophils and add this to the remaining 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube with 15 μL of trypan blue. Slowly pipette up and down to mix. Repeat for each sample.",
    "Take 15 μL from the trypan blue/sample mix and insert this into one of the wells of the COUNTESS chamber slide. Assess purified primary neutrophil viability and yield using the automated COUNTESS cell counter.\nNeutrophil purity estimate by flow cytometry (optional)\nTiming: 1.5 h (to process 10 samples)\nThis optional step details how to estimate neutrophil purity from the MACS purification step by flow cytometry using a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 benchtop flow cytometer.\nNote: We assess purity by staining for Ly6G, a differentiation antigen expressed by myeloid-derived cells (Lee et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) and CD11b, a cell surface antigen of neutrophils (Biffl et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). We define neutrophils as CD11b+ Ly6G+ cells. See Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C for an overview of the gating strategy and the results for a representative cohort.\nAliquot 250,000 cells per sample into 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tubes for staining. Additionally, reserve cells for the unstained and single-stained controls to draw the gates.\nNote: Make three equi-cellular mixes (250,000 cells in each 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube; control sample) of all samples for the one blank and two single-stained controls.\nNote: Keep the remaining cells on ice during this time.\nPellet cells at 300×g at 4°C for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. Remove supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Resuspend cells in 50 μL of flow cytometry staining buffer, which contains mouse Fc receptor blocker. Block cells by incubating at 4°C for 10 min.\nFor each sample that will be stained, prepare 50 μL of a 2× antibody solution in flow cytometry staining buffer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1173_6.csv\nAdd the 50 μL of 2× antibody solution to the 50 μL of blocked cells.",
    "Note: Leave one control sample unstained and perform a single stain for each antibody using the other two 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tubes. These will be used to draw the flow cytometry gates.\nStain the cells by incubating at 4°C for 20 min. Protect from light.\nAdd 1mL of resuspension buffer to wash away excess antibody. Pellet cells by centrifuging at 300×g at 4°C for 10 min.\nRepeat step 31.\nResuspend cells in 250 μL of resuspension buffer (50,000-100,000 cells per 100 μL of resuspension buffer).\nRun samples on a MACSQuant10 flow cytometer. First, use the unstained and single-stained samples to set up appropriate gates that encompass clear positive and negative populations. Adjust the scatter signals to exclude debris, dead cells, and doublets.\nNote: If the MACSQuant10 flow cytometer is not available, other flow cytometry equipment with the appropriate lasers (e.g. BD Aria flow cytometry) can be used for similar results.\nNote: An example of the purity obtained from a cohort of male and female 3-months-old C57BL/6J mice is reported in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C. We routinely obtain purities >90% with the Miltenyi Biotec method, without significant differences across biological groups (Lu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nNote: We performed a small-scale comparison of neutrophil purities using the Miltenyi Biotec Neutrophil Isolation Kit and the alternative Stemcell EasySep Neutrophil Enrichment Kit on two 5-months-old female mice (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E). Notably, the EasySep method seems to result in a lower purity of neutrophils derived from bone marrow.\nNeutrophil NETosis assay\nTiming: 3 h (to process 10 samples)\nThis step details how to quantify NETosis induction from MACS purified neutrophils by flow cytometry using a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 benchtop flow cytometer.",
    "Note: The following protocol has been adapted from a flow cytometry-based protocol (Masuda et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and a 96-well plate plate-reader protocol (Carmona-Rivera and Kaplan 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), to assess NETosis induction for neutrophils in suspension culture.\nNote: SYTOX Green stains extra-cellularized DNA, which is a phenotype of cells that have NETosed or are NETosing. If the neutrophil preparation has poor viability, non-NETosing dead cells may also by SYTOX positive. If desired, although lowering the throughput of the protocol, cells may be co-stained with H3-Cit, MPO, or ELANE to confirm NETosis status. In general, these markers correlate very well with SYTOX Green staining in viable cell preps (Gupta et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Carmona-Rivera and Kaplan 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Masuda et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Zhou et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).\nNote: Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is a known activator of NETosis. To induce NETosis in purified primary neutrophils, alternatives to PMA include fMLP (Torres et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]), TLR agonists such as LPS (Soler-Rodriguez et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), and the calcium ionophore A23187 (Kenny et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: For this protocol, we use a 2-hour incubation period to induce NETosis, a timeframe well supported by the literature (Brinkmann et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Hu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Moussavi-Harami et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Mercer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Neubert et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Carmona-Rivera et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Vaidya et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). However, an incubation period ranging from 1-4 h can also be used, as multiple studies have found robust levels of PMA-induced NETosis as early as 1 hour post PMA exposure (Gupta et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Hoppenbrouwers et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Masuda et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Zharkova et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nResuspend the remaining cells in 15mL conical tubes to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL.",
    "Prepare two 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each sample. One will be for the DMSO [Vehicle] treated aliquot and the other for Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).\nAliquot 500 μL of cells (1 × 106 cells total) into the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nPrepare a 1:250 dilution of the SYTOX Green stock solution in the neutrophil culture medium. Protect from light.\nAdd 5 μL of the diluted SYTOX Green to each tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Protect from light.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1173-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Assay to measure NETosis induction using SYTOX Green\nDiagram showing the steps to perform the NETosis measurement assay. 1 × 106 cells resuspended in 500 μL of neutrophil culture medium is added to a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. 5 μL of diluted SYTOX Green is then added to the cell suspension, followed by 500 μL of either DMSO or 2× PMA. The samples are then added to a 96-well plate in quadruplicates and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After incubation, SYTOX Green+ cells are measured using the MACSQuant10 flow cytometer. Results are analyzed using Flowlogic v8.\nPrepare the DMSO and PMA working stocks. Supplement neutrophil culture media with DMSO [Vehicle] or 100nM PMA (2× concentration).\nAdd 500 μL of the DMSO or PMA supplemented media to the respective microcentrifuge tubes (for a final concentration of 50nM PMA).\nSlowly invert three times to mix.\nSeed 200 μL (2 × 105 cells) in technical quadruplicates in wells of a sterile black 96-well suspension plate.\nIncubate in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C for 2 h.\nMeasure the fraction of cells positive for SYTOX Green in each well using the MACSQuant10 flow cytometer. See Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B for gating examples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1173-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Data for this figure was reanalyzed from Lu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13], using the publicly deposited raw data on Figshare (Cohort 30, young animals only).\n(A and B)The percent of SYTOX Green+ staining cells is low in the DMSO treated group (A) compared to that of PMA (B).\n(C) NETosis induction is calculated by dividing the % parent SYTOX Green+ median of PMA technical quadruplicates over that of DMSO (C).\n(D) NETosis induction values in ten 4-months-old mice is quantified in panel D (half females, half males). For experiments in (A–D), we used C57BL/6Nia mice.\n(E) Under unfavorable conditions, neutrophils will activate spuriously, which can lead to high background SYTOX Green staining and little no apparent difference between DMSO and PMA groups (E).\nNote: If the MACSQuant10 flow cytometer is not available, other flow cytometry equipment with the appropriate lasers can be used for similar results.\nAnalyze the data using Flowlogic V8 (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section for more details)."
