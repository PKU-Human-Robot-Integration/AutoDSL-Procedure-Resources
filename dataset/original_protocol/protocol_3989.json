    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMitochondrial labeling\nTiming: [O.N., 16 h]\nTransfect the cells with CellLight™ Mitochondria-RFP, BacMan 2.0 (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nCritical: The transfection efficiency may vary from cell line to cell line. It is crucial to optimize transfection conditions. Imaging is not suggested if less than 60% of the cells are successfully transfected.\nAdd 3 μL of BacMan 2.0 reagent per 104 cells directly in the complete medium and incubate O.N. at 37°C.\nNote: Volume of BacMan 2.0 reagent = (number of cells desired x particle per cell (PPC)) / 108 particles / ml.\nNote: BacMan 2.0 reagents works with most cell types between 10 and 50 particles per cell (PPC). In our setting we used a PPC of 30.\nCheck the transfection efficiency using a confocal microscope. After incubation O.N. most of the cells (60–70%) should be red (Ex = 555, Em = 584 nm).\nNote: To optimize the transfection efficiency you may need to variate the PPC, cell density, or incubation time.\nAt the confocal microscope, the transfected cells should show well defined and bright mitochondria (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Left: B/W image of BacMan 2.0 transfection, right: overlap between BF image and fluorescence image. Scale bar = 25 μm.\nNote: This transient transfection can be detected starting after overnight incubation up to five days.\nNote: Due to the duration of transgene expression (up to 5 days) it is possible, after CellLight™ Mitochondria-RFP transfection, treating cells with experimental drugs, if desired.",
    "Critical: Frequently the transfection is not equally efficient in all the cells, resulting in some cells being brighter than others (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). It is possible to reduce this variability changing the transfection conditions, increase the PPC and/or increasing the incubation time.\nLive confocal acquisition\nTiming: [2 min/image—multiple acquisitions are performed for each condition]\nTo track each single mitochondrion and quantify its volume over time, the images need to be acquired at high resolution and deconvolved. To acquire the images in live cells with a short interval (3 s) we used the Leica TCS SP8 X W.L.L. Scanning Confocal Microscope with a 40× or 63× objective (see key resource table[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for details). Being able to acquire the images every 3 s will increase the ability of the software to keep track of each individual mitochondrion over-time.\nImages should be acquired (12-bit) using a white-light supercontinuum laser set at 0.2% intensity, excitation wavelength 555 nm, and the emission wavelength 584 nm collected using a Hyd detector. Set scanning format: 512 x 512 and set Pinhole Unit: AU, Airy 1. Pixel size 72.22 nm x 72.22 nm and optical section thickness automatically calculated by the software (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] point 1). For each XYZT, a z-stack of 30-40 slices, with a step size of 0.12 μm, was required to image the whole cell (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] point 2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Microscope setting\nSet the scanning speed to 8000 Hz and to further increase speed, turn on Bidirectional X. If there is any image distortion, adjust Phase X.\nPerform time-lapse imaging for 2 min with a 3 s interval (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] point 3).\nAdjust the zoom → 4× to sample the image at the optimum density/ Nyquist Rate. A Nyquist calculator is available online at https://svi.nl/NyquistCalculator[href=https://svi.nl/NyquistCalculator]",
    "Critical: The acquisition time can vary based on the cell line as well as the interval between each acquisition. For cancer cell lines that move, it is essential to use a short acquisition (2 min), however the time can be adjusted based on the cell line used. When a new cell line is used, it is better to perform some test to optimize the condition: acquire movies with different lengths (i.e. 2, 3 and 4 min) and check the stability of the cell in the selected time frame (the cell should not move in the selected interval). Once the total acquisition time is determined, the interval between each acquisition can be adjusted based on the cell line used. Usually, dynamic cell lines also have active and dynamic mitochondria, and we suggest acquiring every 3 seconds. If the analysis shows no changes in mitochondrial volume over time, the interval can be extended. Based on our experience for a panel of prostate, breast, glioblastoma, and lung cancer cell lines and normal breast epithelial cells, we acquired with a 3 second-intervals for 2 min.\nLimitation: The interval time between each acquisition cannot be reduced under 3 s (using the Leica TCS SP8 X W.L.L. Scanning Confocal Microscope) due to the speed limitation of the machine. Acquisition of the whole volume of the cell in z, requires around 3 s (the time can vary based on cell volume/dimension). The interval time increases with the size of the cell. It is important to acquire the whole cell in the z dimension to have an excellent 3D reconstruction analysis.\nCritical: Due to the use of a zoom, one single cell (or only part of it in the case of giant cells) can be imaged in each video clip.",
    "Note: Acquire at least 10 cells for each condition to have a full representation of your sample.\nNote: Select cells with similar fluorescence intensity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) and with well-defined mitochondria (example in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative image (acquire with a confocal microscope, 63×) of well-defined mitochondria\nScale bar = 100 μm.\nNote: If possible, select a cell small enough to fit in the field of view. If working with large cells, select half or a part of it. It is always better to choose the peripheral area of the cell where the mitochondria are spread out.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: It is crucial to avoid fluorescence bleaching over time; the high speed of the acquisition combined with a low intensity of the laser helps to prevent photobleaching. Maintain the white laser setting between 0.2 and 0.5% to avoid cell damage. Do not increase the line and frame accumulation (set both values to 1); line and frame accumulation can be used to increase the acquired signal without increasing the laser intensity, but this would cause a significant increase in the acquisition time.\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: The acquired cells must not move during acquisition. Using a short acquisition time (2 min) helps to reduce the risk of cell movement, but it is possible to pretreat the plate with poly-L-lysine to stabilize the cell if the cell moves.\nImage deconvolution\nTiming: [15 min/image]",
    "To increase the resolution and the quality of the images, it is necessary to deconvolve them. We use the Huygens professional software, but it is possible to use alternative software (e.g., NIS elements Deconvolution and ImageJ). Deconvolution is a computational technique to improve the contrast and resolution of digital images captured with the microscope, removing out of focus light or assigning the out of focus light to the original light source. The deconvolution process reverses the effects of blur in the recorded images and decreases the noise (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). After the deconvolution process, the image presents a black background, and the mitochondria are well defined and separated (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Step 14c of the deconvolution process, select the P.S.F. setting\nNote: The measured P.S.F. acts as a calibration of the microscope, relating a known physical object (bead) with what the microscope actually measures (bead image).\nCrop stage: if necessary, it is possible to crop the image to reduce the area that needs to be deconvolved as much as possible (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Step 14d of the deconvolution process, cropping tool\nNote: cropping the image removing unnecessary areas will significantly decrease the deconvolution time.\nInspecting the image histogram: the histogram allows you to visually inspect the intensity distribution of the image. First, it allows you to check for saturation (clipping) of the measured values. If clipping is present the histogram will show sharp peaks at the left or rightmost sides. Second, if present, it will spot a significant amount of black level. This shows up as a gap on the left (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]). The distribution as seen in Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12] is of acceptable quality.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. Step 14e of the deconvolution process, inspecting the image histogram",
    "Note: clipping occurs when input signals are too high. Clipping at the right-hand side of the histogram indicates saturation. Saturation is caused by overexposure, for example by raising the laser intensity above the maximum pixel value image file can be accepted.\nEstimate parameters: in this stage the background value of the image can be automatically estimated or manually entered (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig13.jpg\nFigure 13.

By default, this area has a radius of 0.7 microns.\nDeconvolution setup: In this step, deconvolution occurs based on results from the previous stage (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]). The software will generate the default parameters for deconvolving images.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig14.jpg\nFigure 14. Step 14g of the deconvolution process, sets up the deconvolution parameters\nMaximum iterations: the default setting is 40.\nNote: This value can be adjusted depending on the desired final quality of the image. The higher this value, the higher the quality of the image. However, if the setting of maximum iteration is too high, it may distort the image.\nSignal to Noise ratio: this parameter controls the sharpness of the image.\nNote: A noisy confocal image usually has an SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) value lower than 20. The optimal SNR is calculated as: √(Max intensity / Detector gain).",
    "Quality threshold (Q.T.): beyond a certain number of iterations (usually 100) the difference between different iterations becomes not significant. The Q.T. establishes the threshold below which the iterations are stopped.\nNote: The smaller the threshold, the higher is the quality of the image.\nIteration mode: The ‘optimized’ mode is highly recommended, because the iteration steps are more extensive than in classic mode. Bleaching correction: set to ‘if possible’, so the bleaching correction is always performed in the case of confocal images with time series.

Thus, it is possible to investigate the variation of mitochondrial volume (increase in volume due to fusion event, decrease in volume to fission event) over time. The quantification is done with 3D images over time. It is critical to work with well-defined images in which it is possible to discriminate every single mitochondrion as a single object (e.g., image shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). High resolution and clarity of the image allow the software to discriminate the mitochondria as individual objects and to follow them over time.\nThe exported image(s) will appear now in the L.A.S. X software. The analysis will be performed on 3D reconstructed images to follow the variation of mitochondrial volume.\nOpen the image of interest using The Leica L.A.S. X software:\nclick on the 3D button (up right-hand, Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]A, yellow arrow);\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig17.jpg\nFigure 17.

    "to analyze the image of interest, select the image and then click on the ‘append’ button; if you do not append the image the software will work on the first image in your list (left panel, Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]B, point 3, yellow arrow).\nOnce the image has been selected and appended to the software, it is possible to start with the analysis. First, set the threshold by hand (use the same threshold for all the images in one experiment). Then, separate objects and finally, select the region of interest to analyze the mitochondrial volume (the region of interest is drawn by hand and must inlcude around 10–20 mitochondria).\nAdjust threshold:\nAdjust the threshold (Figure 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig18], Processing Sequence panel, point 3). Adjust the threshold using the same parameters for all the images of a single experiment. The red mask shows what is considered an object after adjusting the threshold.

    "Critical: If the number of mitochondria is too high, it would not be easy to see differences in mitochondrial volume over time. The designed method evaluates the variation of the mean volume of the mitochondria contained in the R.O.I. over time.\nClick first on ‘Binary Image Editing’ (point 5 of Processing Sequence panel, Figure 19[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig19] point 1). At this point another window will appear (Figure 19[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig19] point 2); click on ‘Select existing region’ and draw a circle around your region of interest.\nCheck that the mitochondria within the region of interest do not go out of it or that mitochondria initially excluded from that region do not become included over time. This would bias the results. Moving the time bar (Figure 20[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig20], point 4) you will see the movement of the mitochondria in the selected area.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig20.jpg\nFigure 20.

The objects considered for the analysis are yellow, the ones excluded in light green (Figure 20[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig20], point 6).\nCritical: It is always better to choose a region where the mitochondria are not too dense; thus, the software can easily recognize them as separate objects. Figure 20[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig20] point 3.\nOnce the mitochondria that need to be analyzed are selected, proceed with the measurement of the volume. The software can measure the volume of every single object (mitochondrion) for each time frame, providing an evaluation of the variation over time.

To save it, click on the ‘save’ icon on the top left of the page (Figure 22[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig22]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/953-Fig22.jpg\nFigure 22. Save button\nAnalysis of variation of mitochondrial volume over time\nTiming: [less than 5 min/region of interest]",
    "The next step consists of the measurement of the mitochondrial volume over time. The average volume of the mitochondria at each time point is measured. The variation during the time course is measured as fold increase or decrease from the initial volume. Therefore, it is possible to discriminate between fusion and fission events. If a fusion event occurs (two mitochondria merged to became one), the volume of the mitochondrion will increase, giving a fold increase higher than 1. On the other hand, if a fission event occurs (one mitochondrion divides to became two), the volume will decrease, giving a fold increase lower than 1.\nTo analyze the variations of mitochondrial volume overtime, first, prepare an excel file reporting in each column the volume of the mitochondria for each time point (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]); then calculate the average of mitochondrial volume (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_953_2.csv\nTo calculate the variation over time, divide the average volume of the mitochondria at T1 (3 s) over the volume at T0 (0 s), T2 (6 s) over T1 (3 s), and so on …\nRepeat the procedure for each area analyzed. Prepare a new excel table with the volume variation over time for each R.O.I. (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_953_3.csv\nAfter optimizing, set up a threshold to calculate the frequency of fission and fusion events. For our purposes, a fold increase higher than 1.3 represents a fusion event, and a fold decrease lower than 0.7 represents a fission event. (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\nNote: The fold increase or decrease magnitude can vary based on the volume of the mitochondria before the fusion and fission event and the number of events in the 3 seconds interval.",
    "Note: The threshold to calculate fission and fusion events has been optimized, matching the analyzed movies with the fold increase generated by the analysis. Variation smaller than 1.3 or higher of 0.7 (in the analyzed cell lines, n = 5) cannot be considered a biological event, but only an endogenous mitochondrial shape variation. It is possible that using this threshold few fission/fusion events are lost but maintaining the same threshold through the whole analysis makes it consistent across the different conditions."
