  "procedures": [
    "The experiments described in this article were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA, in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1996, published by National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20055, USA). B6.A-Dysfprmd/GeneJ mice (a.k.a. BLAJ mice, males, ~1.5 years old) that model LGMD2B/R2 were used for the present study. The mice were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Study design\nChoose mouse strain(s) relevant to the research question(s) — e.g., study B6.A-Dysfprmd/GeneJ mice (BLAJ mice) if trying to answer the question as to whether or not concentrically biased DART induces widespread muscle damage in mice that model LGMD2B/R2.\nAssign mice to study groups based on the study design-e.g., randomly assign mice to a dosage-adjusted resistance training (DART) group or to an isometric training group (ISOM), and attempt to balance the groups as best as possible based on matching by litter and/or age (e.g., Table 1).\n2. Fabrication of the DART device\nDesign the DART device components with suitable computer-aided (CAD) software (Figure 1) following the steps below.\n\t\nDesign housing for low friction wheel bearing (see Table of Materials, based on pillow block bearing design) with a built-in protractor (for use as a goniometer to measure ankle joint angles).\nDesign a tower for wheel bearing housing plus a protractor.\nDesign a footplate for positioning the mouse's foot. Design an axle to connect the footplate to the wheel bearing.\nManufacture the DART device components with a suitable 3D printer (Figure 1).\n\t\nSave the designs created with CAD software as stereolithography (.STL extension) files.",
    "NOTE: The .STL files (Supplementary Coding Files 1-4) may be used and modified by giving credit to the corresponding author of this article and citing this article.\nOpen the .STL files with suitable slicing software (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Slicing software converts a virtual 3D model into a stack of slices, which can be printed sequentially by a 3D printer to generate a 3D object.\nWith slicing software, generate G-CODE computer-aided manufacturing (CAM, .GCODE extension) files, which are specific to the 3D printer and filament that will be used.\nFollow the 3D printer manual (see Table of Materials) to print DART device components with .GCODE files.\nChoose an appropriate 3D printer filament, such as polylactic acid (PLA) 1.75 mm 1 kg/spool, Gray (see Table of Materials).\nAssemble the DART device following the steps below.\n\t\nInsert a 608 low-friction wheel bearing (8 mm bore diameter, 22 mm outside diameter, such as one with silicon nitride ceramic balls housed in 420 stainless steel, see Table of Materials) into the wheel bearing housing (Figure 1).\nInsert the axle into the bore of the wheel bearing (Figure 1).\nPaste the footplate onto the axle with glue (see Table of Materials) that is suitable to bond PLA (Figure 1).\nPlace the wheel bearing housing above the wheel bearing housing tower and attach the whole assembly to an acrylic base with screw fasteners (Figure 1).\n\t\t​NOTE: There are no specific size requirements for the acrylic base — it just needs to be large enough to accommodate the animal and DART device and small enough to fit on a work surface. The acrylic base used for the present study is about 30 cm wide, 45 cm long, and 0.5 cm thick.\n3. Preparation of mice for DART or ISOM",
    "Place each mouse under general anesthesia with inhaled isoflurane delivered through a suitable anesthesia system (see Table of Materials, 2%-5% for induction; 1%-4% for maintenance; to effect) to reduce stress and pain.\n\t\nInduce anesthesia in the induction chamber of the anesthesia system (2%-5% isoflurane).\nTransfer the mouse to a nose cone to maintain anesthesia while performing procedures on the animal (1%-4% isoflurane). Confirm anesthesia effectiveness based on the lack of hindlimb withdrawal to a toe pinch from a pair of tweezers.\nProvide thermal support — e.g., with an isothermal gel heating pad and a heat lamp placed ~1 m above the mouse. Check with a thermometer to ensure that the temperature on and around the acrylic base is maintained at ~38 °C, so the mouse does not overheat.\nPrepare the skin over the left tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the mouse and over the entire anterior and lateral aspects of the left hindlimb for DART or ISOM.\n\t\nRemove the mouse's fur with a hair removal cream (depilatory cream, see Table of Materials). Apply depilatory cream and allow it to work for ~2 min.\nClean the leg with wipes soaked in distilled water to remove fur and all residual cream from the skin. Depilatory creams can irritate and/or damage the skin if left on the mouse's skin for long periods and, therefore, remove completely.\nAfter fur removal, disinfect the skin with an approved scrubbing method, such as with a povidone-iodine scrubbing solution and 70% ethanol.\nApply a protectant (e.g., petrolatum) over the eyes and depilated skin with a clean cotton swab to protect the eyes and depilated skin from drying.\nPlace a stabilizing pin through the tibial metaphysis.\n\t\nApply 5% lidocaine cream over the tibia to numb the area.",
    "Pass a 26 G, half-inch, sterile, hypodermic needle through the widest part of the proximal portion of the tibial bone (i.e., the tibial metaphysis, also known as the tibial head). Once the stabilizing pin is secured, remove the plastic portion of the hypodermic needle by holding the needle with a sterile hemostat and bending the plastic portion until it breaks off.\nPosition the mouse for DART or ISOM training.\n\t\nLay the mouse in a supine position. Ensure that the mouse is still securely connected to the nose cone to maintain anesthesia.\nWith a pair of sterile-tipped tweezers, feed the tibial pin into a metal alligator clip (see Table of Materials), such that the ends of the tibial pin are held by the alligator clamp. Move the adjustable arm of the alligator clamp to ensure that the mouse's foot is placed on the footplate of the DART device.\nStrap the mouse's foot onto the DART device footplate with adhesive laboratory tape.\nPlace the mouse's foot at a 90° angle in relation to the long axis of the mouse's tibial bone. If placed correctly, the footplate will be perpendicular to the acrylic base (i.e., the floor or what is considered the horizontal plane).\nRest the footplate on the plantarflexion stop created by placing an 18 G, 1.5 in long hypodermic needle through the predrilled holes on the DART device's protractor (Figure 1).\n4. DART or ISOM training\nOptimize the electrode placement by placing a bipolar, transcutaneous, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES, see Table of Materials) electrode on the inferolateral aspect of the mouse's knee joint (Figure 1B).\n\t\nWith single pulses (1 Hz) from a laboratory electrical stimulator (see Table of Materials), stimulate the fibular branch of the sciatic nerve, which provides motor innervation to the ankle dorsiflexor muscles (Figure 1B).",
    "Since the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle accounts for over 90% of the total contractile force produced by the ankle dorsiflexor muscles31, observe the TA muscle belly and tendon for evidence of electrically elicited twitch contractions.\n\t\tNOTE: A slight bony prominence that corresponds with the fibula bone might help with electrode placement if the tester can feel it through the electrode. This requires some practice and learning on the part of the tester to get a feel for optimal electrode placement.\nMove the plantarflexion stop to the hole on the protractor that corresponds to 20° of plantarflexion from the position at which the foot is orthogonal (90°) to the tibia — this is the position at which maximal contractile torque from the TA muscle is typically observed based on previous reports21. This might have to be customized by the user based on factors specific to the mice that are being studied.\nVisualize twitch torque with a mouse dynamometer by linking the DART device footplate to the dynamometer footplate — e.g., link the DART device footplate to a custom-built robotic ankle dynamometer footplate with a non-elastic silk suture (similar to Figure 1A) and strap the suture to the dynamometer footplate (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: The footplate has holes built into the 3D print design. Placing the suture through the pair of holes that are in the second row from the toe-end of the footplate puts the suture at ~20 mm from the axis of dorsiflexion/plantarflexion (Figure 1A, B). The dynamometer has been described in previous reports19,20,21,22.\nOptimize the voltage output from the NMES stimulator.",
    "After optimizing the electrode placement, optimize the amplitude of the voltage output from the electrical stimulator — this is necessary to confine NMES to the common fibular nerve and TA muscle and reduce the risk of eliciting co-contractions in the plantarflexors.\n\t\tNOTE: If co-contractions are elicited, they can be visualized through the torque output from the dynamometer and also be seen in the plantarflexing of the toes.\nSet the NMES stimulator for DART or ISOM training.\n\tNOTE: The following settings might have to be customized by the user based on factors specific to the mice that are being studied and the purpose of the studies.\n\t\nSet the stimulator to produce repeated pulse trains that are 125 Hz in frequency — this frequency produces maximal fused tetanic contractions without overflow of NMES into other muscle groups in BLAJ mice21. Perform this by adjusting the dials for pulse frequency (125 Hz), train duration (500 ms), and trains per second (1 train/s) and turning on the toggle switch for repeating pulse trains.\nSet stimulator to produce pulse trains that are 500 ms in duration interspersed with 500 ms rest between pulse trains.\nMove the plantarflexion stop to the hole on the protractor that corresponds to 160° to the long axis of the tibia (70° plantarflexion from foot orthogonal to the tibia). This is the position to which the BLAJ mouse's foot can be moved passively without soft tissue resistance21.\nFor DART, apply a suitable resistance against which the TA muscle has to work concentrically — e.g., 5 g as shown in Figure 1A, B; see the weight to torque calibration curve in Supplementary File 1.\nApply resistance by hanging the weight with a non-elastic silk suture that is tied to the DART device footplate (Figure 1A, B).",
    "Adjust the resistance - i.e., apply ~50% of the one-repetition maximum (1RM) (e.g., 5 g if the mouse can lift a maximum weight of 10 g with a single contraction), which pulls the foot through at least half of the available active range of dorsiflexion.\nPerform suitable DART training in mice assigned to the DART group — e.g., perform a single bout of DART training, which involves four sets of 10 repetitions of concentric contractions with 2 min rest between sets, similar to progressive resistance training programs used in humans32 (see Supplementary Video 1).\nPerform suitable ISOM training in mice assigned to the ISOM group — e.g., perform a single bout of ISOM training, which involves four sets of 10 repetitions of isometric contractions with 2 min rest between sets, similar to DART (see Supplementary Video 2).\nFor ISOM training, place the mouse's foot at 160° to the long axis of the tibia (70° plantarflexion from foot orthogonal to the tibia), and maintain this static position by taping the silk suture to the footplate of the robotic dynamometer.\n\t\t​NOTE: Since the suture cannot slide, the DART device footplate cannot move into dorsiflexion, thus constraining the dorsiflexors to contract isometrically.\n5. Post-procedural care for mice\nTake precautions to maintain proper hygiene of the exercised hindlimb and reduce needle site pain.\n\t\nAfter the DART or ISOM training, coat the visible portion of the tibial pin with Triple antibiotic ointment (400 U/g of bacitracin, 3.5 mg/g of neomycin, and 5000 U/g of polymixin-B, see Table of Materials) and then withdraw the pin carefully from the medial side of the tibia. Rinse the skin over the lateral thigh and upper leg with povidone-iodine and sterile water. Apply 5% lidocaine cream over the tibia to control needle site pain.",
    "Allow the mice to recover from anesthesia.\n\t\nRemove the mouse from the nose cone and allow it to recover from anesthesia in a recovery cage that is free of bedding. Provide thermal support to the mouse while it recovers from anesthesia, e.g., with an isothermal gel heating pad.\nReturn the mouse to its original cage after it completely recovers from anesthesia. Then, return the cage to the animal facility, where study mice are housed until follow-up experiments are performed. Monitor the mice daily.\n6. Tissue collection\nHarvest mouse TA muscle in its entirety and snap freeze for cryopreservation following the steps below.\n\t\nBased on the research question(s), at a suitable time after training (e.g., 3 days post DART or ISOM), euthanize the mice according to approved protocols.\n\t\tNOTE: For the present study, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation under general anesthesia (inhaled isoflurane, 2%-5% to effect). Bilateral thoracotomy ensured death.\nDissect the mouse hindlimbs to remove the exercised TA muscle (left) and unexercised TA muscle (right). Weigh the harvested muscles. Then, dip each muscle in mineral oil for cryoprotection and place the muscle on a clean lab wipe to blot the excess oil21.\nPlace the muscle on a piece of aluminum foil. Hold the edge of the foil with a long hemostat and rapidly immerse the foil and muscle into liquid nitrogen contained in a suitable plastic container to snap freeze the muscle.\n\t\nAfter about 2 min of immersion in liquid nitrogen, transfer the frozen muscle to labeled cryogenic vials. Store vials in a −80 °C freezer until needed for further studies.\n7. Histological studies on muscle tissue",
    "Prepare cryostat sections of TA muscle that are 5 µm in thickness. Collect cryostat sections onto charged microscope slides. Fix the sections with acetone that is kept cold at −30 °C and allow the sections to air dry.\nStain the muscle tissue sections with hematoxylin followed by eosin (H&E staining, see Table of Materials).\n\t\nImmerse the sections for 5 min in hematoxylin (dark blue nuclear stain) in a glass staining jar. Remove excess hematoxylin by rinsing the sections with tap water until no further bluing of water is seen.\nImmerse the sections for 5 min in bluing reagent in a glass jar. Aspirate excess bluing reagent from the sections with a glass suction pipette.\nImmerse the sections for 5 min in eosin (pink cytoplasmic stain) in a glass staining jar. Remove excess eosin by dipping the sections quickly and repeatedly (~10 times) into 95% ethanol in a glass staining jar.\nAllow the sections to air dry and proceed to visualize under a light microscope.\nPrepare high-resolution tiled images of entire TA muscle cross-sections through microscope imaging.\n\tNOTE: The user might have to customize the imaging and image analysis steps that follow based on their microscope and image acquisition and analysis software.\n\t\nCapture digital images with the 10x objective lens of a light microscope and a digital camera mounted on the microscope.\nCapture about 15-20 images, moving along the cross-section of each muscle in a grid-like manner, such that each new image overlaps ~25% with the previous image.\n\t\tNOTE: This process helps capture a set of images that can be digitally tiled (also known as image stitching) to create a high-resolution composite image of the entire TA muscle cross-section (Figure 2).\nSave digital images in .TIFF format.\nOpen digital images with suitable image processing and analysis software (see Table of Materials).",
    "Tile or stitch individual images into a composite image of the whole TA muscle through the following steps: with all the individual overlapping images of each TA muscle open in software, click on File > Select Automate > Select Photomerge > Select Collage > Select Add Open Files > Click OK.\nWhen a new tiled/stitched image of the TA muscle is prepared and displayed, save the image in .TIFF format for further analyses.\nQuantify muscle damage by visual analysis in the tiled images of the entire TA muscle with suitable image analysis software.\n\t\nIn the image analysis software, select the Measure function in the Analyze menu to outline and measure the area of the entire TA muscle cross-section (Figure 2).\nIn the image analysis software, select the Measure function in the Analyze menu to outline and measure the areas of each TA muscle that are damaged — i.e., areas that show cytoplasmic disruption of muscle fibers, absent muscle fibers, and inflammatory cell infiltration22 (Figure 2).\nExpress the sum of the total area of damage as a percentage of the entire TA muscle cross-sectional area (Figure 2, Table 2).\n8. Statistical analyses\nOrganize data as shown in Tables 1-3 and perform non-paired T-tests (if tests of normality and homogenous variances are passed)33 or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum tests (if tests of normality and homogenous variances are not passed)21 with suitable software (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
