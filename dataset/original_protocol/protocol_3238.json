    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTime considerations\nIn this section, we provide an account of the anticipated time frame and the buffer volumes necessary for isolating hepatocytes from a single mouse.\nThe estimated time for each part of the protocol is as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3007_4.csv\nNote: A total time of 3–4 h should be estimated to isolate myeloid subset per animal.\nBuffers preparation and setup of perfusion pump\nTiming: 10 min\nThis section describes the preparation of buffers and preparation of the perfusion pump. The perfusion system consists of a water bath along with a peristaltic pump featuring adjustable speed.\nFreshly and aseptically prepare all buffers and reagents list in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section sterilely for liver digestion.\nCritical: Operate all procedures in a laminar hood to avoid bacterial contamination.\nPre-warm the PB and DB to 38°C in the water bath before use.\nNote: The water bath temperature is typically set one degree higher than the temperature required for digestion (37°C) to compensate for the temperature loss when the fluid passes through the tubing. It is advised to measure the temperature of the outflow using another thermometer before starting the perfusion step\nNote: Approximately 25 mL of DB is required to digest a whole liver. DB is freshly prepared, do not store.\nPlace the inlet tubing into a 50 mL tube containing 45 mL PB in a 38°C water bath (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3007-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. An illustrative guide for configuring a perfusion pump system",
    "(A–D) An overview of the peristaltic perfusion pump’s components, including the (A) water bath, (B) the variable-speed peristaltic pump, (C) a 26-gauge needle, and (D) the silicone conduit. The peristaltic pump is connected to the silicone conduit using a polypropylene connector. The inlet tubing is inserted into a 50 mL tube containing 40 mL of perfusion buffer in a 38°C-water bath.\n(E) All surgical instruments need to be sterilized before use, for example, using dry bead sterilizer to sterilize at 250°C for 1 min.\nSet up the pump speed at 5 mL/min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nSet up a dissection board for liver perfusion of a mouse\nEnsure that the surgical table or surface is clean and sterile with 75% ethanol.\nCover the entire surface of the polystyrene foam pad with a sheet of aluminum foil, providing a clean and disposable dissection board for the liver perfusion procedure.\nPlace the dissection board inside a waste fluid collection container. This container collects and disposes of any waste fluids from the perfusion procedure.\nPlace the dissection board near the perfusion pump.\nAssemble the outlet tubing with a 26G needle (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D).\nFlush the outlet tubing with 10 mL of 70% ethanol, followed by 10 mL of 1× PBS.\nRun the pump with PB for 3 min to ensure a stable flow rate.\nCritical: Air bubbles should be removed the perfusion system and catheter.\nAnimal surgery and anesthesia\nTiming: ∼ 15 min\nThis section provides the essential information required to conduct the animal operation and position the mouse effectively in preparation for the following liver perfusion procedure.\nMeasure body weight of the mouse.\nAnesthetize the mouse by either using inhalation of isoflurane (4% in oxygen) or using administration of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg) in normal saline by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection.",
    "Ensure that the animal is adequately anesthetized and exhibits regular breathing.\nUse an electric clipper to remove the fur on the entire abdomen and lower thorax of the animal.\nPosition the mouse ventral side up and secure the mouse’s limbs on a clean dissection board with locking pins or the medical adhesive tapes.\nClean the anterior abdomen of the mouse using the sterile cotton swabs first with 75% alcohol, followed by iodine.\nUse scissors to make a longitudinal midline incision on the ventral abdomen, approximately 1–2 cm above the hind legs, extending up to the sternum.\nCreate a transverse incision along with the lower rib cage and ensure the integrity of the diaphragm wall.\nGently displace the intestine gently to the side of the mouse’s body to expose the liver.\nLiver perfusion and enzymatic dissociation of liver cells\nTiming: ∼ 30 min\nThis section involves liver perfusion followed by enzymatic digestion using collagenase IV to dissociate the entire liver tissue into a single-cell suspension. This section was separated into two distinct segments for clarity: Part I, which covers Liver Perfusion, and Part II, addressing Liver Digestion.\nPart 1. liver perfusion\nTiming: ∼ 15 min\nStart the perfusion pump and set the perfusion rate at 5 mL/min.\nNote: Ensure the correct flow rate by measuring the outflow volume as a fraction of time.\nCritical: Start the perfusion pump before the catheter cannulation to avoid introducing air bubbles into the portal vein.\nInsert a 26G catheter that has already been connected to the perfusion system into the portal vein (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) and clamp the portal vein tightly to secure the catheter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3007-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The process of hepatic perfusion and enzymatic dissociation of liver cells",
    "(A–H) (A) Insert a catheter with a syringe of 26-gauge into the portal vein; (B) To prevent the catheter from becoming dislodged, constrict the portal vein securely with a vascular clamp; (C) Cut through the diaphragm, thereby exposing the thoracic cavity; (D) Clamp the proximal portion of the IVC to guarantee that the liver is receiving blood in situ; (E) Compress the distal portion of the IVC for 7–10 s using forceps to avoid fluid leakage from the liver; (F) A transition from reddish-brown to light brown is indicative of a liver that is in good condition; (G) The digested liver tissue lacks the distinct shape, texture, and organization of the intact liver and instead appears more amorphous and disrupted; (H) Remove the whole liver from the animal and put it on a cell strainer with 70 μm mesh width on top of a 50 mL centrifuge tube. See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nNote: The operation should be conducted at a clean workstation with adequate lighting.\nNote: Insert the needle at a flat angle relative to the vein. Additionally, ensure that the needle bevel is facing upwards.\nCut the inferior vein cava (IVC) immediately after Step #19 is finished.\nNote: This step is to avoid pressure-related liver injury due to the overloaded blood volume in mice.\nCut the diaphragm and open the chest cavity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: The perfusion is continued for 3–5 min.\nClamp the proximal part of IVC to maximize the efficiency of in situ liver perfusion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nClamp the distal part of IVC with forceps for 7–10 s to prevent fluid from exiting the liver (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nThen release to allow the fluid to exit.\nRepeated this procedure for 4–5 times.",
    "Note: At this point, the entire liver should be enlarged and perfused (as indicated by a transition of color from dark to light brown) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nContinue the perfusion for an additional 5 min.\nNote: This step will use 40 mL PB in total.\nAfter the liver is thoroughly flushed of blood, move to the next step.\nCritical: Ensure that the liver enlarges upon applying the clamp and returns to its normal size upon release. This step is crucial because in certain cases, the liver may appear white, which could be due to the passive clearing of blood from the cannulated site (portal vein) rather than active perfusion.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Liver perfusion and enzymatic dissociation of liver cells, related to steps #18 to #28\n    \nPart 2. liver digestion\nTiming: ∼ 15 min\nDisplace the inlet tubing from the PB tube to a 50 mL tube containing 40 mL of DB in a 38°C water bath.\nNote: Stop the pump temporarily prior to displacing the tubing to avoid introducing air into the circulation while changing the buffer, and then restart the pump immediately.\nMaintain a constant flow rate of 5 mL/min for 5 min.\nNote: A total of 25–30 mL of DB will be used for the entire procedure of this step.\nUpon enzymatic digestion, the liver undergoes notable visual changes compared to its intact state (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F). These common changes involve the dissolution of connective tissues and the breakdown of cellular structures, often resulting in a soft and mushy texture (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nNote: The digestion time can vary as it depends on the digestion efficiency of collagenase.",
    "Remove the entire liver from the animal and place it in a cell strainer with 70 μm mesh on top of a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Keep the tube on ice.\nNote: When removing the liver, the gut must not be cut or punctured. This would potentially lead to bacteria or endotoxin contamination of the liver homogenate.\nAdd HBSS buffer intermittently to the strainer.\nGently swirl the liver within HBSS+ buffer using the pipette tip or the tip of a disposable dropper to facilitate the dissociation of liver cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nNote: Tissue clumps and debris will be retained in the mesh, while single cells will pass through it.\nNote: Use a total volume of 50 mL HBSS+ buffer for this step.\nRepeat Step #30 until the final volume of the filtered cell suspension reaches 50 mL.\nNote: All procedures of this step are performed on ice.\nCritical: To achieve effective digestion, the exact time for liver digestion using 0.05% collagenase, even from the same vendor or lot, should be optimized. Indications of over-digestion show an excessive release of cellular components in the flow-through of DB. Indications of under-digestion (or insufficient digestion) include difficulties in achieving a complete dissociation of the liver tissue into a single-cell suspension and the presence of numerous undigested liver tissues.\nSeparation of non-parenchyma and parenchyma cells from cell suspensions using centrifugation\nTiming: 45 min\nThis step will roughly separate viable non-parenchyma cells (NPCs, mainly Kupffer and stellate cells) with parenchyma cells (PCs, mostly hepatocytes) in cell suspension. All the isolation procedures are conducted at 4°C.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 4°C for 5 min at 50 × g (500 rpm) in a swing-out rotor (KUBOTA, Cat# 6000).\nTransfer the supernatant to a clean 50 mL tube.",
    "Note: The supernatant contains mainly NPCs, whereas the pellet contains mainly PCs (mostly hepatocytes) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCentrifuge the recovered supernatant at 4°C for 5 min at 50 × g again to remove the residual PCs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3007-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Centrifugation-based separation of non-parenchymal and parenchymal cells from cell suspensions\n(A–C) (A) Hepatocytes and (B) NPCs were collected after 50 × g and 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C, respectively. To assess the outcome of the isolation process, the cell pellet was subsequently suspended in buffer and examined under a microscope. (C) A condition resulting from the lysis of RBC pellets.\nTransfer the supernatant to a clean 50 mL tube.\nPellet down the NPCs by centrifugation at 300 × g (1260 rpm) for 10 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDiscard the supernatant and keep the NPC cell pellet on ice.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 1× RBC lysis buffer and incubate at 20°C–24°C for 1 min in order to lyse the red blood cells.\nAdd 9 mL of 1× PBS to a final volume of 10 mL and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) in 1 mL of HBSS+.\nQuantification of viable cell count\nTiming: 15 min\nThis step serves as a checkpoint to ascertain the execution of the subsequent experimental procedures.\nMix an aliquot of 10 μL isolated NPC suspension and 90 μL of 0.4% trypan blue solution in a tube by gently pipetting.\nCount the cell number and assess the viability of the isolated cells from a 10 μL aliquot of the mixture by the cell counter (Corning, #6749) or hemocytometer.\nNote: This step could generally yield 1 × 107∼1.5 × 107 cells from the liver per mouse in total.",
    "Transfer the NPC suspension to a sterilized flow cytometry tube and centrifuge them again at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the NPC pellets in 100 μL of cell-staining buffer (e.g., BD Pharmingen Stain Buffer) at a density of 1 × 108 cells/mL prior to beginning the enrichment step.\nNote: Given that hepatic myeloid cell subsets comprise distinct cell populations, such as KCs and monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs), including Ly6C+, Ly6C- and Ly6C+Ly6G+ cells, it is often necessary to pool cells from multiple livers to obtain an adequate quantity of subset-of-interest cells for subsequent experiments.\nEnrichment of hepatic myeloid cells using magnetic beads\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nThis section provides the detailed steps for enriching CD45+ NPCs from the isolated NPCs after centrifugation. This enriched step ensures optimal cell viability, sorting conditions, enhanced yield and purity, and reduced artifacts during FACS. At the same time, this step could serve as an additional checkpoint to ensure the validity and reliability of subsequent experimental procedures. It contributes significantly to the success and quality of downstream analyses, particularly when dealing with rare cell populations, by preventing contamination from unwanted cell types.\nAdd 1 μL of BD Mouse Fc Block (purified anti-mouse CD16/CD32 mAb) to NPCs (cell sample) and incubate for 10 min on ice.\nAdd 3 μL of APC-labeled anti-CD45 antibody to the Fc block-treated cells.\nIncubate on ice for another 30 min.\nProtect from light.\nNote: No tapping of the tube is required during incubation.\nThoroughly mix the BD IMag Anti-APC Magnetic Particles (a type of immunomagnetic bead).\nAliquot 50 μL of the beads to the cells sample, resulting in 150 μL of total volume.\nIncubate the tube on ice for 30 min.\nPlace the tube-containing BD IMag-labeled cell suspension onto a Cell Separation Magnet (e.g., BD IMagnet).",
    "Allow the magnetic beads-bound cells to accumulate at the tube wall for 6–8 min.\nRemove and discard the depleted supernatant carefully.\nNote: Check that the beads have moved to the magnet side of tube wall when the incubation is finished.\nWash the magnetic bead-bound cells by suspending the cells in 1 mL of 1× BD IMag buffer.\nGently pipette the cells up and down.\nReposit the tube to the Cell Separation Magnet for another 2–4 min.\nRepeat this step once.\nImportant: Do not vortex the magnetic bead-bound cells, as this could damage the cells.\nResuspend the magnetic bead-bound cells with 1 mL of 1× PBS after the final wash.\nNote: Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] illustrates the flow chart of cell enrichment with the BD IMag-based method.\nCount the number and check the viability of CD45+ cells by a cell counter or a hemocytometer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3007-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Flow chart of BD IMag-based cell enrichment protocol, courtesy of BD, with modifications\nNote: Utilizing a hemocytometer is particularly advisable to achieve accurate results, especially considering that some immune cells may be too small to be reliably counted using other methods.\nPause point: It is imperative to complete the whole procedure without pause to preserve cell viability.\nCell surface marker staining for flow cytometric analysis\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nThe following steps describe how to stain the distinct myeloid subsets for flow cytometric analysis.\nUse 0.1 mL aliquots of magnetic bead-bound cell suspension for compensation control preparation, including the single-color and isotype controls.\nUse the remaining 0.9 mL aliquots of the sample for staining with the targets of interest antibodies.\nNote: A minimum of 5 × 104 cells is recommended for each compensation control.\nCentrifuge the magnetic bead-bound cell suspension at 300 × g (1260 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C and remove the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the magnetic bead-bound cell pellets in 100 μL cell-staining buffer (e.g., BD Pharmingen Stain Buffer).\nAdd all the fluorophore-labeled specific antibodies of interest at a ratio of 1:100 (antibody to cell suspension) and mix well.\nAdd the isotype control at the same concentration as the specific antibody.\nOptional: Prepare an antibody mixture by combining all the antibodies of interest in a single tube and adjusting the volume to a final volume of 100 μL with cell-staining buffer. Then, resuspend the magnetic bead pellets with this antibody mixture.\nMix the antibodies thoroughly with the cells and incubate on ice for 30 min in the dark (e.g., put an aluminum foil cover on the ice bucket or place the bucket in a drawer).\nWash the cells by adding 3 mL of 1× PBS to each sample tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g (1260 rpm) for 5 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRepeat this step twice.\nAfter the final wash step, resuspend the cell pellets in 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nAdd 1 μL of a cell-impermeable DNA dye (e.g., BD Horizon Fixable Viability Stain 780) to stain dead cells.\nNote: If the cells are intended for further cell culture, it is recommended to use a fixable dye. The fixable dye will not leak out of the cells or interfere with cell viability after staining, making it suitable for additional cell culture or other experiments.\nIncubate the mixture for 10–15 min at 20°C–24°C, keeping it protected from light.\nWash cells twice with 3 mL of 1× PBS, decant the supernatant and gently mix to loosen the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 200 μL of 1× PBS for flow cytometry analysis.\nPerform the flow cytometric analysis using a flow cytometer (e.g., Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX or BD LSRFortessa).",
    "Optional step: If the isolation of specific myeloid subsets by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is desired, the BD FACSAria III Sorter or other alternative sorting instruments can be used as substitutes for the flow cytometer used in step #60. Analysis of cells was conducted on FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).\nNote: For optimal sorting results, it is recommended to use an 85 μm nozzle and set the flow rate to 1.5.\nSet the voltages for each stain using unstained and single-stain controls (APC-, BB700-, FITC-, BV421-, and PE-labeled antibodies).\nSet gates to exclude cell fragments and multicellular aggregates and include only forward-scatter (FSC) singlets, side-scatter (SSC) singlets, live (FVS780-negative) cells, and CD45+ (APC-positive) cells.\nIn this protocol, as an example, we analyzed the subsets of CD45+ myeloid cells, including Kupffer cells (KCs) and Ly6C+ monocytes, to study their proportion and cell surface markers for mechanistic studies in mice with liver diseases.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3007-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Strategies for analyzing different subsets using flow cytometry\nProportion of each subset is expressed as a percentage of live cells.\nNote: The gating strategy is depicted in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nOptional: Once gates have been determined, the cells can be selected for sorting into external collection tubes.\nNote: Depending on the available instrumentation, it is possible to sort the desired population all at once, as determined by the gating strategy.\nRun the sample at 4°C and activate the deflection plates till the required number of cells was obtained.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3007-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Reanalyze the sorted fractions using the Flow cytometer to determine their purity",
    "(A–C) (A) The subsets of CD45+ cells are analyzed by flow cytometry after immunomagnetic isolation; (B) The post-sorting purity of subsets of CD45+ cells are assessed by staining these cells with anti-CD11b and F4/80 and then re-running them with flow cytometry; (C) The representative images of sorted KCs and MoMs were captured under a differential interference contrast microscope.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3007-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Representative bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopic images of immunomagnetic bead-isolated CD45+ myeloid cell stained with F4/80 (green) and CD11b (Red) antibodies\nCells were cytospun onto a slide and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After PBS wash, cells were subjected to staining with surface markers to identify the specific subsets of cells. Magnification 400×. Scale bar: 30 μm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3007-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. A typical result for homogeneous and viable F4/80 positive cell cultures from the sorted fraction\n(A–C) (A) Representative images depict the morphology of sorted macrophages, including MoMs and KCs (resident macrophages); (B) 2 h after plating, a single wash with PBS is performed to eliminate dead cells and MoMs; thereafter, the remaining attached cells were further cultured in medium. 24 h after plating, these attached cells exhibited a mature macrophage phenotype; (C) A representative immunofluorescence microscopic image of sorted resident macrophages stained with anti-F4/80 (green) and the Hoechst dye (blue) after culture. Magnification 400×. Scale bar: 30 μm.\nOptional: Perform a post-sort analysis to assess the purity of the sorted cell populations.\nNote: Once the cells are sorted, an aliquot of the sorted fractions can then be rerun through the Flow cytometer to assess purity (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nNote: The sorted cells can be cytospun onto a slide using a Cytospin 4 centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# A78300003) and subjected to further staining for surface markers to identify the specific subsets of cells (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).",
    "Optional: If a sterile sorting is performed, the cells can be cultured (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nOptional: If the cells will be analyzed with single-cell RNA sequencing or RNA sequencing, continue directly from steps #47 and/or #65.\nOptional: While this protocol is designed for the isolation of all CD45+ immune cells, slight modifications could allow for the exclusive isolation of other cell types, such as NK cells and lymphocytes. For instance, for isolating NK cells, the introduction of markers such as CD3−NK1.1+ or CD3−NKp46+ could be employed. Similarly, for isolating lymphocytes, incorporating markers like CD3 (for T cells) and CD19 (for B cells) into the protocol could be considered."
