    "Parasite culturing Maintain P. falciparum parasites in complete culture medium at 4% hematocrit and approximately 3% parasitaemia in cell culture plates and flasks (Maier and Rug, 2013).Every second day, check the parasitaemia using Giemsa staining technique; replace the culture with fresh complete culture medium pre-warmed to 37 °C and dilute the parasite cultures to 0.2% parasitaemia. Gas the culture flask with malaria gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 for 30 s; close the cap of the flask and incubate at 37 °C.Maintain a synchronized P. falciparum culture by treating the parasites with sorbitol according to Lambros and Vanderberg (1979).Expand the cell culture to approximately 3 × 108 trophozoite-infected RBCs and proceed with the Seahorse XFe96 assay (General note 2).XF96 cell culture microplate pre-treatment (at least 1 day prior to the experiment) Figure 2 depicts various parts of the Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridge used in the protocol. The XFe96 analyzer uses only 96-well plates. A 24-well plate format is available for use with a Seahorse XFe24 analyzer, with a previously published protocol describing the analysis of O2 consumption rates in P. falciparum using this approach (Sakata-Kato and Wirth, 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4863/bioprotoc-13-21-4863-g002.jpgFigure 2. Parts of the Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridge. A) Side view shows the bottom of the sensor probes attached to the green sensor cartridge. B) Top view shows an example of the four injection ports above each of the 96 wells. The inset shows ports A–D and the top of the sensor probe. Created with BioRender.com[href=https://biorender.com/].In order to immobilize Plasmodium falciparum cells on the Agilent Seahorse XFe96 plate during the experiment, coat each well with Cell-Tak, according to the manufacturer’s protocol, 1–5 days prior to the experiment. Briefly, prepare Cell-Tak in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate at a final concentration of 22.12 μg/mL (General note 3); 2.",
    "5 mL is enough for coating one 96-well plate. Dilute Cell-Tak right before use, mix thoroughly, and dispense immediately.Dispense 25 μL of Cell-Tak in each well of the XFe96 cell culture microplate; 25 μL is usually sufficient to cover the entire bottom of the well, but care must be taken to spread Cell-Tak throughout the well.Incubate the plate for 20 min at room temperature. Aspirate the solution. Invert and pat the plate to remove any residual Cell-Tak solution.Wash each well with 200 μL of Milli-Q water, twice, to reduce any trace sodium bicarbonate.Discard the water and air-dry the wells under sterile conditions. The plate can be left in the cell culture hood for drying.Store the XFe96 cell culture microplate in a zip-lock bag in the fridge (4 °C) for up to one week.On the day of the experiment, warm the plate to room temperature in a biological safety cabinet before seeding cells.Hydrate the sensor cartridge (1 day prior to the experiment) The sensor cartridge consists of solid-state sensor materials, which detect changes in pH and O2 concentration during the experiment. Prepare the sensors by hydrating the sensor cartridge according to Agilent’s user guide as follows. Open the XFe96 FluxPak (cartridge + utility plate package) and place the cartridge upside down (sensor end up) next to the utility plate. Do not touch the sensors. Fill all the wells of the utility plate with 200 μL of Milli-Q water.Place the cartridge back on the utility plate and make sure that the sensors are submerged completely. Incubate the sensor cartridge and utility plate in a 37 °C humidified incubator overnight.On the day of the assay, remove the cartridge and place it upside down (sensor end up).",
    "Discard the water from the utility plate and fill all the wells with 200 μL of XF Calibrant pre-warmed to 37 °C.Place the cartridge back in the utility plate and move the cartridge up and down, twice, to remove any trapped air bubbles from the sensor.Incubate the utility plate with the sensor cartridge and calibrant solution in a 37 °C humidified incubator for at least 1 h prior to the start of the experiment.Wave program template preparation Set up Wave desktop software.Under the group definitions tab, define the injection strategies (Figure 3A). An example is shown below.Port A, inhibitors/atovaquone (5 μM).Port B, TMPD (0.2 mM) and ascorbic acid (2 mM).Port C, sodium azide (NaN3; 10 mM).Configure the plate map by assigning individual groups to different conditions of the experiment (Figure 3B). Make sure to include background wells (measurement without cells). A–D represents different candidate P. falciparum ETC inhibitors. Atovaquone is used as the positive control. Control wells have parasites without drug treatment (i.e., solvent control injected from Port A). Background wells do not have parasites. Four technical replicates are included for each condition.Under the protocol tab, click on injection and specify the timing and repeats of the mixing and measurement cycles for each injection (Figure 3C). e.g., eight cycles of measurement after inhibitor injection (five cycles of measurements otherwise). Each cycle of measurement has:20 s of mixing,1 min of waiting,2.5 min of measuring.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4863/bioprotoc-13-21-4863-g003.jpgFigure 3. Designing a Seahorse XFe96 experimental template in the Wave software. A) Under Group Definitions tab, fill in the injection strategies as follows. Port A: Inhibitors/atovaquone; Port B: TMPD; Port C: Sodium azide. B) Under the Plate Map tab, customize the plate map according to your group definition. Ensure background wells (wells without cells) are included.",
    "C) Under the Protocol tab, specify the timing and substrates to be injected from a specific port. Specify the number of mixing and measurement cycles as follows. After inhibitor injection 8 cycles (5 cycles for all other substrate injection); 20 s mixing; 1 min waiting; 2.5 min measuring.Save this template. On the day of the experiment, open the template and click on the run assay tab to start the assay.Inhibitor/substrate preparation Prepare 45 mL of 1× MAS buffer (see Recipes). Pre-warm 1× MAS buffer, PBS, and saponin in a water bath (37 °C) until use.Prepare the substrates/inhibitors/controls that will be injected in the ports of the sensor cartridge before parasite preparations (General note 4). For the model experiment, we used:8× atovaquone/inhibitors solution. Prepare a 40 μM solution to obtain a final concentration of 5 μM following injection into the wells during the assay. To make up 40 μM stocks, add 1.4 μL of 10 mM inhibitor to 348.6 μL of MAS buffer, or add 1.1 μL of 25 mM atovaquone to 698.9 μL of MAS buffer.9× TMPD/ascorbate solution. Prepare a solution containing 1.8 mM TMPD and 18 mM ascorbate to obtain a final concentration following injection of 0.2 mM TMPD/2 mM ascorbate. Add 6.5 μL of 500 mM TMPD and 162 μL of 200 mM ascorbate to 1,631.5 μL of MAS buffer.10× sodium azide solution. Prepare a solution of 100 mM NaN3 to obtain a final concentration following injection of 10 mM NaN3. Add 300 μL of 1 M NaN3 to 2,700 μL of MAS buffer (General note 5).Parasite preparation Assemble the MACS® magnetic column with three-way stopcock inside the biological safety cabinet.",
    "Pre-wash the column by passing 30 mL of 100% ethanol, 30 mL of 80% ethanol, 30 mL of PBS (pre-warmed to 37 °C), and 30 mL of RPMI-HEPES with Glutamax, pre-warmed to 37 °C (General note 6).Enrich the culture for trophozoite-stage parasites by passing 3 × 108 trophozoite-infected RBCs drop-by-drop through a MACS® magnetic column placed in the magnetic field of a SuperMACS II separator (Ridgway et al., 2021). The volume of the culture is adjusted to yield a hematocrit of approximately 15% before passing through the column. Uninfected and ring-stage infected RBCs will pass through the column, while RBCs infected with mature-stage parasites (trophozoites and schizonts) will be retained.Remove any residual uninfected red blood cells or ring-stage parasites retained in the column by passing 30–50 mL of complete culture medium pre-warmed to 37 °C through the column.Remove the column from the magnet and elute RBCs infected with mature-stage parasites in 20–30 mL of complete culture medium.Determine the parasite-infected RBC yield using a hemocytometer. Check the purity of the parasites in the eluate using Giemsa-stained blood smears.Free 2 × 108–3 × 108 trophozoite-stage parasites from erythrocytes by treating infected RBCs with 1 mL of pre-warmed 0.05% (w/v) saponin in PBS at 37 °C for 3 min. Wash the cells with pre-warmed PBS three times or until the supernatant is no longer red in color (i.e., until the hemoglobin is completely removed), pelleting the parasites by centrifugation at 2,000× g for 2 min at room temperature after each wash.The parasite yield should be approximately 2 × 108–3 × 108 cells. Adjust the parasite concentration to 5 × 107 parasites/mL in mitochondrial assay solution (MAS) buffer containing 0.002% (w/v) digitonin. Digitonin permeabilizes the parasite plasma membrane. Pre-heat digitonin solution to 62 °C (to dissolve it) before adding.",
    "Parasites start losing viability after detergent treatment and it is advisable to start the O2 consumption rate (OCR) measurements within one hour of the detergent treatment.Seed 100 μL of the permeabilized parasites per well in the Cell-Tak-coated XFe96 cell culture plate. This results in a density of 5 × 106 cells per well. Centrifuge at 800× g for 10 min at room temperature with the centrifuge brake set to low. This step ensures the parasites adhere to the bottom of the wells. Check the plates under the microscope to ensure that a monolayer of cells has formed (see Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4863/bioprotoc-13-21-4863-g004.jpgFigure 4. Outline of P. falciparum in a cell monolayer. Cell-Tak-coated P. falciparum cell monolayer in XFe96 cell culture plate, after centrifuging the plate with low brake.Carefully add 75 μL of MAS buffer to the side of the wells at an angle, without agitating and detaching the adhered parasites. Check the plates under the microscope again to confirm that the monolayer of cells has not been disturbed.Transfer the plate to an incubator (37 °C) at atmospheric CO2 to degas the plate of excess CO2 levels, and store until use. This step is crucial to effectively degas the plastic material of any CO2 (Thangaraj et al., 2018). Degassing adjusts the CO2 in the assay plate to (low) atmospheric CO2 levels, ensuring pH values of the assay solutions are not influenced by changes in CO2 levels during the assay.OCR measurements At least one hour prior to the experiment, turn on the XFe96 flux analyzer and the temperature controller to calibrate the instrument.Open the prepared experiment template in Wave software and export it as a design file (.asyt) to run the assay.Carefully load 25 μL of each inhibitor/substrate into the injection ports after the cartridge has been placed in the utility plate.",
    "For the assay we describe in this manuscript: Port A—Compounds (8× the final concentration), port B—TMPD (9× the final concentration), port C—NaN3 (10× the final concentration) port D—empty in this experiment. To load the solution into the port, insert the pipette tip to near the bottom of the port. Lift the pipette tip slightly and angle the tip alongside the wall. Slowly dispense the inhibitor/substrate into the port (General note 7).Ensure all ports are filled, including ports of blank wells and ports of unused wells without cells. In the sample experiment, assay ports A, B, and C of all wells must be filled to enable compound/substrate dispensing. Port D, which is not used, can remain empty.Click Run assay in the Wave software and, when prompted, load the cartridge (filled with the substrates/inhibitors to be injected) with the utility plate onto the plate holder. Make sure to remove the lid from the utility plate and place the plate in the right orientation onto the plate holder.The sensor calibration takes approximately 25–30 min.Once the calibration is finished, the utility plate is automatically ejected. The sensor cartridge is retained inside the XFe96 analyzer. Replace the utility plate with the cell plate containing the adhered parasites (again without the lid) and resume the run.Once the experiment is complete, the cell culture plate is ejected. Remove the plate and the sensor cartridge and examine the injection ports to verify that all compounds were injected (General note 8).The results file (.asyr) is automatically saved on the computer. Save the result file onto a USB drive to transfer to another computer with the analysis software.Discard the cell culture plate with the cartridge containing the parasites and the substrates safely and appropriately (General note 9)."
