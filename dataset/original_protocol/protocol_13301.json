    "This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital (Approval date: September 27, 2019). All the procedures involving human participants were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committees, as well as the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients before surgery.\n1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclude patients if (1) they have pathologically confirmed thyroid cancer and require surgical treatment; (2) they have extensive local tumor infiltration, such as T3-T4 (American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging, eighth edition), or if metastatic lesions have invaded important structures such as the trachea, esophagus, and large vessels; (3) they and their family members volunteer for computer-aided 3D visualization; and (4) they had no contraindications to anesthesia.\nExclude patients if they do not undergo surgical treatment.\n2. Imaging acquisition\nObtain plain and enhanced CT (including venous and arterial phases) images of the patients using a 256-layer spiral CT system. The scanning parameters are as follows: 120 kV, 120 mA, 512 x 512 matrix, 0.625 mm layer thickness, 150 HU threshold, and 10-20-s arterial scan delay.\nObtain the scan data from the CT system in DICOM format.\n3. Computer-aided 3D modeling\nImport the data into the 3D visualization software (Figure 1A).\n\t\nClick on the Open button to select the document containing the patient data in DICOM format. Import the data into the software.\nProcess the data for Gaussian smoothing if the original data contain a lot of image noise (Figure 1B). Select the data with the right mouse button, and then click on the Gaussian Smoothing button.\nReconstruct different structures in the target area (chest and neck) individually.",
    "Select Different Models (for example, skin and bone) in the software according to the structure to be reconstructed (Figure 2A).\nSet the Color, Maximum Threshold, and Minimum Threshold based on the reconstructed structure on CT (Figure 2B). Set different thresholds for the bone and skin. Adjust the upper and lower thresholds based on the observed preview effect (Figure 2C).\nClick on the Calculation button to complete the preliminary 3D model reconstruction (Figure 2D).\nModify the segmented data.\n\t\nOnce the segmentation data of structures such as the blood vessels, skin, and bones are obtained (Figures 3A-C), use the Smoothing Algorithm button to optimize the segmented data and ensure the reconstructed saw-tooth edges match the real tissue.\nThen, use the One-Click Navigation button to locate the 2D and 3D images (Figure 3D), and determine whether the segmentation effect was accurate. Use the Pen or Brush tool to fix the incorrect layers (Figure 3E).\n\t\tâ€‹NOTE: The 3D modeling is achieved after obtaining the segmentation data of all the structures.\n4. Preoperative evaluation\nView the 3D model, and pay close attention to the tumor volume and location and the relationships between the tumor and the adjacent tissues using the Magnification, Rotation, Tissue Transparency, and Separation functions and a combination of various structures. For example, observe the extent of tumor invasion in the common carotid artery, esophagus, and trachea.\nDetermine the scope of surgical resection, the degree of functional impairment after resection, and the postoperative adjuvant therapy plan based on the 3D model evaluation. Implement effective and intuitive doctor-patient communication to satisfy the patient's expectations and explain the surgeon's treatment plan.\n5. Surgery\nRemove the tumor according to the preoperative plan and the intraoperative observations of the tumor and the affected vital organs.",
    "Perform tumor-reducing surgery with intraoperative labeling for postoperative adjuvant therapy in the absence of a repair plan.\nRepair defects caused by the resection, and perform functional reconstruction as necessary based on the operative plan and intraoperative situation.\nSubscription Required.
