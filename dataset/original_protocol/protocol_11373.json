    "NOTE: The following protocol describes the details of the informatics analytic procedure and pseudo-codes of the major modules. The automatic analysis system was developed using Python version 3.6.0 and the Python modules pandas, abc, numpy, scipy, sklearn, sys, PyQt5, sys, mRMR, math and matplotlib. The materials used in this study are listed in the Table of Materials.\n1. Prepare the Data Matrix and Class Labels\nPrepare the data matrix file as a TAB- or comma-delimited matrix file, as illustrated in Figure 1A.\n\tNOTE: Each row has all the values of a feature, and the first item is the feature name. A feature is a probeset ID for the microarray-based transcriptome dataset or may be another value ID like a cysteine residue with its methylation value in a methylomic dataset. Each column gives the feature values of a given sample, with the first item being the sample name. A row is separated into columns by a TAB (Figure 1B) or a comma (Figure 1C). A TAB-delimited matrix file is recognized by the file extension .tsv, and a comma-delimited matrix file has the extension .csv. This file may be generated by saving a matrix as either the .tsv or .csv format from software such as Microsoft Excel. The data matrix may also be generated by computer coding.\nPrepare the class label file as a TAB- or comma-delimited matrix file (Figure 1D), similar to the data matrix file.",
    "NOTE: The first column gives the sample names, and the class label of each sample is given in the column titled Class. Maximal compatibility is considered in the coding process, so that additional columns may be added. The class label file may be formatted as a .tsv or .csv file. The names in the column Class may be any terms, and there may be more than two classes of samples. The user may choose any two of the classes for the following analysis.\n2. Load the Data Matrix and Class Labels\nLoad the data matrix and class labels into the software. Click the button Load data matrix to choose the user-specified data matrix file. Click the button Load class labels to choose the corresponding class label file.\n\tNOTE: After both files are loaded, kSolutionVis will conduct a routine screen of the compatibility between the two files.\nSummarize the features and samples from the data matrix file. Estimate the size of the data matrix file.\nSummarize the samples and classes from the class label file. Estimate the size of the class label file.\nTest whether each sample from the data matrix has a class label. Summarize the numbers of the samples with the class labels.\n3. Summarize and Display the Baseline Statistics of the Dataset\nClick the button Summarize, without any specified keyword input, and the software will display 20 indexed features and the corresponding features names.\n\tNOTE: Users need to specify the feature name they wish to find to see its baseline statistics and corresponding value distribution among all input samples.\nProvide a keyword, e.g. “1000_at”, in the textbox Feature to find a specific feature to be summarized. Click the button Summarize to get the baseline statistics for this given feature.",
    "NOTE: The keyword may appear anywhere in the target feature names, facilitating the search process for users.\nClick the button Summarize to find more than one feature with the given keyword, and then specify the unique feature ID to proceed with the above step of summarizing one particular feature.\n4. Determine the Class Labels and the Number of Top-ranked Features\nChoose the names of Positive (“P (33)”) and Negative (“N (95)”) classes in the dropdown boxes Class Positive and Class Negative, as shown in Figure 2 (middle).\n\tNOTE: It is suggested to choose a balanced binary classification dataset, i.e., the difference between the numbers of positive and negative samples is minimal. The number of samples is also given in parenthesis after the name of each class label in the two dropdown boxes.\nChoose 10 as the number of top-ranked features (parameter pTopX) in the dropdown box Top_X (?) for a comprehensive screen of the feature-subset.\n\tNOTE: The software automatically ranks all the features by the P-value calculated by a t-test of each feature comparing the positive and negative classes. A feature with a smaller P-value has a better discriminating power between the two classes of samples. The comprehensive screening module is computationally intensive. The parameter pTopX is 10 by default. Users can change this parameter in the range of 10 to 50, until they find satisfying feature subsets with good classification performances.\n5. Tune System Parameters for Different Performances\nChoose the performance measurement (pMeasurement) Accuracy (Acc) in the dropdown box Acc/bAcc (?) for the selected classifier Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Another option of this parameter is the measurement Balanced Accuracy (bAcc).",
    "NOTE: Let TP, FN, TN, and FP be the numbers of true positives, false negatives, true negatives and false positives, respectively. The measurement Acc is defined as (TP+TN)/(TP+FN+TN+FP), which works best on a balanced dataset6. But a classifier optimized for Acc tends to assign all the samples to the negative class if the number of negative samples is much larger than that of positive ones. The bAcc is defined as (Sn+Sp)/2, where Sn = TP/(TP+FN) and Sp = TN/(TN+FP) are the correctly predicted rates for positive and negative samples, respectively. Therefore, bAcc normalizes the prediction performances over the two classes, and may lead to a balanced prediction performance over two unbalanced classes. Acc is the default choice of pMeasurement. The software uses the classifier ELM by default to calculate the classification performances. The user may also choose a classifier from SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (k Nearest Neighbor), Decision Tree, or Naïve Bayes.\nChoose the cutoff value 0.70 (parameter pCutoff) for the specified performance measurement in the input box pCutoff:.\n\tNOTE: Both Acc and bAcc range between 0 and 1, and the user may specify a value pCutoffimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57738/57738eq1.jpg[0, 1] as the cutoff to display the matched solutions. The software carries out a comprehensive feature-subset screening, and an appropriate choice of pCutoff will make the 3D visualization more intuitive and explicit. The default value for pCutoff is 0.70.\n6. Run the Pipeline and Produce the INTERACTIVE VISUALIZED RESULTS\nClick the button Analyze to run the pipeline and generate the visualization plots, as shown in Figure 2 (bottom).",
    "NOTE: The left table gives all the feature subsets and their pMeasurement calculated by the 10-fold cross validation strategy of the classifier ELM, as described previously5. Two 3D scatter plots and two-line plots are generated for the feature-subset screening procedure with the current parameter settings.\nChoose 0.70 as the default value of the pMeasurement cutoff (parameter piCutoff, input box Value), and 10 as the default of the number of best feature subsets (parameter piFSNum).\n\tNOTE: The pipeline is executed using the parameters pTopX, pMeasurement, and pCutoff. The detected feature subsets may be further screened using the cutoff piCutoff, however piCutoff cannot be smaller than pCutoff. Therefore, piCutoff is initialized as pCutoff and only the feature subsets with the performance measurement ≥ piCutoff will be visualized. The default value of piCutoff is pCutoff. Sometimes kSolutionVis detects many solutions, and only the best piFSNum (default: 10) feature subsets will be visualized. If the number of feature subsets detected by the software is smaller than piFSNum, all the feature subsets will be visualized.\nCollect and interpret the features detected by the software, as shown in Figure 3.\n\tNOTE: The table in the left box shows the detected feature subsets and their performance measurements. The names of the first three columns are “F1”, “F2”, and “F3”. The three features in each feature subset are given in their ranking order in one row (F1 < F2 < F3). The last column gives the performance measurement (Acc or bAcc) of each feature subset, and its column name (Acc or bAcc) is the value of pMeasurement.\n7. Interpret the 3D Scatter Plots-Visualize and Interpret the Feature Subsets with Similarly Effective Binary Classification Performances Using 3D Scatter Plots",
    "Click the button Analyze to generate the 3D scatter plot of the top 10 feature subsets with the best classification performances (Acc or bAcc) detected by the software, as shown in Figure 3 (middle box). Sort the three features in a feature subset in ascending order of their ranks and use the ranks of the three features as the F1/F2/F3 axes, i.e., F1 < F2 < F3.\n\tNOTE: The color of a dot represents the binary classification performance of the corresponding feature subset. A dataset may have multiple feature subsets with similarly effective performance measurements. Therefore, an interactive and simplified scatter plot is necessary.\nChange the value to 0.70 in the input box pCutoff: and click the button Analyze to generate the 3D scatter plot of the feature subsets with the performance measurement ≥ piCutoff, as seen in Figure 3 (right box). Click the button 3D tuning to open a new window to manually tune the viewing angles of the 3D scatter plot.\n\tNOTE: Each feature subset is represented by a dot in the same way as above. The 3D scatter plot was generated in the default angle. To facilitate the 3D visualization and tuning, a separate window will be opened by clicking the button 3D tuning.\nClick the button Reduce to reduce the redundancy of the detected feature subsets.",
    "NOTE: If users wish to further select the feature triplets and minimize the redundancy of the feature subsets, the software also provides this function using the mRMR feature selection algorithm. After clicking the Reduce button, kSolutionVis will remove those redundant features in the feature triplets and regenerate the table and the two scatter plots mentioned above. The removed features of the feature triplets will be replaced by the key word in the table. The values of None in the F1/F2/F3 axis will be denoted as the value of piFSNum (the range of the normal value of F1/F2/F3 is [1, top_x]). Therefore, the dots that include a None value may appear to be “outlier” dots in the 3D plots. The manually tunable 3D plots may be found in “Manual tuning of the 3D dot plots” in the supplementary material.\n8. Find Gene Annotations and Their Associations with Human Diseases\nNOTE: Steps 8 to 10 will illustrate how to annotate a gene from the sequence level of both DNA and protein. Firstly, the gene symbol of each biomarker ID from the above steps will be retrieved from the database DAVID32, and then two representative web servers will be used to analyze this gene symbol from the levels of DNA and protein, respectively. The server GeneCard provides a comprehensive functional annotation of a given gene symbol, and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM) provides the most comprehensive curation of disease-gene associations. The server UniProtKB is one of the most comprehensive protein database, and the server Group-based Prediction System (GPS) predicts the signaling phosphorylation’s for a very large list of kinases.",
    "Copy and paste the web link of the database DAVID into a web browser and open the web page of this database. Click the link Gene ID Conversion seen in Figure 4A and input the feature IDs 38319_at/38147_at/33238_at of the first biomarker subset of the dataset ALL1 (Figure 4B). Click the link Gene List and click Submit List as shown in Figure 4B. Retrieve the annotations of interest and click Show Gene List (Figure 4C). Get the list of gene symbols (Figure 4D).\n\tNOTE: The gene symbols retrieved here will be used for further functional annotations in the next steps.\nCopy and paste the web link of the database Gene Cards into a web browser and open the web page of this database. Search a gene’s name CD3D in the database query input box and find the annotations of this gene from Gene Cards33,34, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 5A.\n\tNOTE: Gene Cards is a comprehensive gene knowledgebase, providing nomenclature, genomics, proteomics, subcellular localization, and involved pathways and other functional modules. It also provides external links to various other biomedical databases like PDB/PDB_REDO35, Entrez Gene36, OMIM37, and UniProtKB38. If the feature name is not a standard gene symbol, use the database ENSEMBL to convert it39. CD3D is the name of the gene T-Cell Receptor T3 Delta Chain.\nCopy and paste the web link of the database OMIM into a web browser and open the web page of this database. Search a gene’s name CD3D and find the annotations of this gene from the database OMIM37, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 5B.",
    "NOTE: OMIM serves now as one of the most comprehensive and authoritative sources of human gene connections with inheritable diseases. OMIM was initiated by Dr. Victor A. McKusick to catalog the disease-associated genetic mutations40. OMIM now covers over 15,000 human genes and over 8,500 phenotypes, as of December 1st 2017.\n9. Annotate the Encoded Proteins and the Post-Translational Modifications\nCopy and paste the web link of the database UniProtKB into a web browser and open the web page of this database. Search a gene’s name CD3D in the query input box of UniProtKB and find the annotations of this gene from the database38, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 5C.\n\tNOTE: UniProtKB collects a rich source of annotations for proteins, including both nomenclature and functional information. This database also provides external links to other widely used databases, including PDB/PDB_REDO35, OMIM37, and Pfam41.\nCopy and paste the web link of the web server GPS into a web browser and open the web page of this web server. Retrieve the protein sequence encoded by the biomarker gene CD3D from the UniProtKB database38 and predict the protein’s post-translational modification (PTM) residues using the online tool GPS, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 5D.\n\tNOTE: A biological system is dynamic and complicated, and the existing databases collect only known information. Therefore, biomedical prediction online tools as well as offline programs may provide useful evidence to complement a hypothesized mechanism. GPS has been developed and improved for over 12 years7,42 and may be used to predict a protein’s PTM residues in a given peptide sequence43,44. Tools are also available for various research topics, including the prediction of a protein’s subcellular location45 and transcription factor binding motifs 46 among others .\n10. Annotate Protein-Protein Interactions and Their Enriched Functional Modules",
    "Copy and paste the web link of the web server String into a web browser and open the web page of this web server. Search the list for the genes CD3D and P53, and find their orchestrated properties using the database String47. The same procedure may be carried out using another web server, DAVID32.\n\tNOTE: Besides the aforementioned annotations for individual genes, there are many large-scale informatics tools available to investigate the properties of a group of genes. A recent study demonstrated that individually bad marker genes might constitute a much-improved gene set5. Therefore, it’s worth the computational cost to screen for more complicated biomarkers. The database String may visualize the known or predicted interaction connections, and the David server may detect the functional modules with significant phenotype-associations in the queried genes47,32. Various other large-scale informatics analysis tools are also available.\n11. Export the Generated Biomarker Subsets and the Visualization Plots\nExport the detected biomarker subsets as a .tsv or .csv text file for further analysis. Click the button Export the Table under the table of all the detected biomarker subsets and choose which text format to save as.\nExport the visualization plots as an image file. Click the button Save under each plot and choose which image format to save as.\n\tNOTE: The software supports the pixel format .png and the vector format .svg. The pixel images are good for displaying on the computer screen, while the vector images may be converted to any resolution required for journal publication purposes.\nSubscription Required.
