    "Note: All concentrations of gold nanorods are expressed in terms of nominal Au molarities. For comparison with other works, note that 1 M Au roughly corresponds to 20 µM gold nanorods, in our case.\n1. Preparation of Cationic Gold Nanorods\nNote: The method begins with the synthesis of cetrimonium bromide (CTAB)-capped gold nanorods by the autocatalytic reduction of HAuCl4 with ascorbic acid, according to the protocol introduced by Nikoobakht et al.25 and adapted according to Ratto et al.26. Then these gold nanorods are modified in order to gain more biocompatibility and affinity for plasmatic membranes, by the combination of polyethylene glycol strands10,11,27,28 and quaternary ammonium compounds22.\nPurify 24 ml CTAB-capped gold nanorods at a concentration of 450 µM Au by two cycles of centrifugation (12,000 x g, 30 min) and decantation. Make sure that the ratio of dead volume to initial volume is around 1/200 or lower for all centrifugation steps in this protocol. Use 500 µM aqueous CTAB as a washing solution and finally transfer the particles into 6 ml 100 mM acetate buffer at pH 5 containing 500 µM CTAB and 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20.\nAdd 30 µl 10 mM aqueous alpha-methoxy-omega-mercapto-poly(ethylene glycol) (MW ~ 5,000) and leave to react for 30 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 30 µl 100 mM (11-Mercaptoundecyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide in dimethyl sulfoxide and leave at rest for 24 hr at 37 °C.\nNext, add 18 ml 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20 in water and purify these particles by four cycles of centrifugation (12,000 x g, 30 min) and decantation. Use 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20 in water as washing solution and finally transfer the particles into 2.4 ml sterile PBS at pH 7.4. The final nominal concentration of gold is 4.5 mM.\n2. Loading of Murine Macrophages with Gold Nanorods",
    "Use the monocyte/macrophagic cell line J774a.1 and DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin as culture medium. Plate 5 x 105 cells in four Petri dishes of 60 mm diameter and allow them to grow for 24 hr, so as to be subconfluent at the time of detachment (see step 2.2).\n\t\nThroughout the protocol, maintain the cells under standard culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air and 100% relative humidity). Use a laminar flow cabinet and appropriate personal protective equipment to manipulate the cells.\nAfter 24 hr, load the cells with cationic gold nanorods and prepare them to be embedded into chitosan films:\n\t\nIn order to allow the particles to be taken up by the cells, add an aliquot of 4.5 mM Au cationic gold nanorods in PBS into each Petri dish, so as to achieve a final concentration of 100 µM Au. Leave the Petri dishes in incubation for 24 hr.\nNext, observe the cells under an optical microscope to confirm their good conditions and the upload. Cells should exhibit their normal morphology and a number of dark intracellular vesicles. Detach the cells by a scraper, merge those from two Petri dishes, in order to achieve a suitable amount of cells for the following steps (at least 2 x 106 cells), and centrifuge them (120 x g, 6 min) to eliminate any excess of cationic gold nanorods. The cellular pellet should look almost black.",
    "Suspend the pellet in 2 ml PBS and count the cells by the use of a Bürker chamber. Centrifuge a suspension containing 2 x 106 cells (120 x g, 6 min) and fix their pellet in 2 ml 3.6% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS for ten minutes at room temperature. Finally, wash this pellet three times by centrifugation (120 x g, 6 min) in order to remove the fixative. Use PBS as washing solution.\n3. Embedment of Macrophages into Chitosan Films\nNote: The peculiar properties of chitosan26,27,28,29 are exploited to produce biomimetic phantoms containing macrophages stained with cationic gold nanorods. With respect to other hydrogels such as agarose, chitosan enables films that are much stronger and thinner, which is critical for PA microscopy6. The fabrication of these phantoms is carried out according to previous protocols29,30,31 with some modifications as prescribed in the followings30.\nPrepare an acidified (pH 4.5, obtained by the addition of acetic acid) and viscous 3% (w/v) low molecular weight chitosan (average MW 120 kDa) solution, thoroughly mix it and let it homogenize for 24 hr at 40 °C.\nNext, mix murine macrophages containing cationic gold nanorods (2 x 106 cells) with 500 µl of chitosan solution.\nIn order to obtain ~50 µm thick phantoms, pour 250 mg of the mixture into 1.91 cm2 polystyrene molds and leave them under a nitrogen stream for 24 hr. Thereafter, treat these samples with 500 µl 1 M NaOH, in order to induce cross-linking, and rinse them with 10 ml of ultrapure water.\n4. Test of the Stability of Photoacoustic Conversion\nNote: The stability of PA conversion is investigated by means of PA experiments with the home-made setup that is described in ref 6.",
    "Suspend a chitosan film containing the macrophages in DI water, for instance by the use of a plastic holder immersed in a Petri dish, so as to keep a distance of ~5 mm from the bottom of the plate. Put this plate onto a micrometric XY stage in order to control the sample position.\nFocus a laser beam with ~5 nsec pulse duration in resonance with the longitudinal plasmonic band of the gold nanorods (e.g., from an optical parametric oscillator pumped by the third harmonic of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with wavelength range of 400 - 2,500 nm and pulse duration of 5 nsec) perpendicular to the film surface with a ~300 µm spot diameter.\n\t\nPlace an attenuator in front of the laser exit to tune the laser fluence and use a beam splitter to focus part of the laser beam to an energy meter (e.g., a pyroelectric detector) and monitor fluence fluctuations. Maintain the optical fluence below ~1 mJ/cm2 per pulse during the alignment. Use appropriate laser safety eyewear whenever the laser is on.\nDip an ultrasound transducer (frequency range of 1 - 20 MHz) into the Petri dish ~2 mm off of the film surface and adjust its position by using micrometric translations and rotational stages to maximize the PA signal emitted from the film.\nDetermine a probe fluence FLO that does not damage the sample6:\n\t\nIrradiate a random point of the sample at a fluence around 1 mJ/cm2 per pulse for at least 500 pulses. For each pulse, acquire the corresponding PA signal from the ultrasound transducer and laser fluence from the energy meter with an oscilloscope. Name the average fluence as FLOtrial.",
    "Calculate the intensity of the PA signal as its peak-to-peak amplitude as a function of pulse number. In order to counterweight the laser intensity fluctuations, normalize the amplitude of each PA signal to the ratio of its own fluence to FLOtrial. Analyze the trend of the normalized PA intensity as a function of pulse number and verify its stability over time.\nIn the case of instability, repeat steps 4.4.1 to 4.4.3 with a lower value of FLOtrial. In the case of stability, repeat them with a value of FLOtrial higher by ~10%, until a loss of stability arises. Set the probe fluence FLO as the second highest value of FLOtrial that ensures stability.\nMeasure a reshaping threshold fluence:\n\t\nChoose another random point of the sample and probe an average PA intensity (ILOa) over 500 pulses at FLO.\nSet a nominal fluence greater than FLO and deliver 50 pulses. Name their average fluence as Fexc.\nProbe an average PA intensity (ILOb) over 500 pulses at FLO once again. Calculate the ratio R = ILOb / ILOa. A value of R below unity gives evidence of an irreversible change of the optical properties of the sample.\nUse the micrometric XY stage to move the film and change the point of the sample at random. Repeat steps 4.5.1 to 4.5.4 with different values of Fexc, so as to take a few values of R below, around and above unity. 15 points are reasonable.\nPlot R as a function of Fexc and identify the reshaping threshold fluence Fth as that value when R begins to differ from one beyond statistical uncertainty.6\nSubscription Required.
