    "1. Crosses to Generate MARCM Flies\nMaintain flies on cornmeal molasses media (6.5 g/L agar; 23.5 g/L yeast; 60 g/L cornmeal; 60 ml/L molasses; 4 ml/L acid mix; 0.13% Tegosept) or standard Drosophila media at 22 degrees Celsius in a 12-hr light/dark cycle.\n\tNote: A Lower than standard temperature is used to keep MARCM-stocks healthy. This extends the developmental time between egg and adulthood to 14 days.\nUse virgin females (approximately 1 - 8 days old) from a MARCM-ready stock containing the necessary genetic elements (GFP under the control of an upstream-activating sequence (UAS-GFP), the Gal80 repressor protein, the Gal4 transcription factor, a heat-shock driven recombinase, and a FRT recombination site).\n\tNote: Our MARCM ready-stocks contain the following genotypes: elavGal4, UAS-CD8-GFP, hs-flipase; FRT40A, tubGal80/CyO; tubGal4/TM3Sb.\n\tNote: The specific FRT site will depend on the location of the mutation in the genome. For example, FRT40A is used to test mutations on the left arm of chromosome 2, such as NOMPC (see10 for more details on MARCM protocols).\nCross MARCM-ready virgin females to males that contain a mutation of interest and its corresponding FRT site (for example, w-; NOMPC3, FRT40A/CyO; +/+). To control for effective MARCM induction, set a second cross using male flies containing the same FRT site, but without a mutation. Use an approximate ratio of 5 females: 1 male in crosses.\n2. Timed Egg Laying\nAfter allowing flies to mate for at least one night, move adults into new vials with fresh media. Allow flies to lay eggs in a dark environment for approximately 4 hr before again transferring the crosses into new vials. Note the start and end times of the egg laying period.",
    "Note: Shorter intervals are acceptable when there appears to be a high number of eggs on the media before the end of the 4-hr interval.\n\t\nKeep vials with a sufficient number of eggs (approximately greater than 20) and store in a 12-hr light/dark cycle at 22 degrees Celsius to be heat shocked later.\n\t\tNote: Vials with a low number of eggs on the media (less than approximately 20) are unlikely to yield sufficient numbers of adult flies for behavioral testing and in the interest of efficiency it is recommended they not be retained for further testing.\n\t\tNote: Our flies are raised with the lights on from 8 AM to 8 PM. We have found the evening time points lead to higher egg densities, therefore usually perform timed crosses between 4 - 8 PM and 8 PM-midnight. The flies lay their eggs at RT in a dark cabinet and then are returned to the incubator the following day so as not to disturb the regular light-dark cycle in the incubator.\n3. Perform Heat Shock to Induce Mitotic Recombination\nApproximately 85 - 100 hr after egg laying, place vials into a water bath at 37 degrees Celsius for 1 hr. Ensure that the water level reaches above the height of the media in the vials, but does not fully submerge the vials to prevent the larvae from drowning.\nRemove vials from water bath and allow a 1 hr recovery period at RT.\nPlace vials back into 37 degrees Celsius water bath for 1 hr.\nRemove vials from water bath and store in incubator on 12-hr light/dark cycle at 22 degrees Celsius until eclosion.\n4. Preparation for Behavioral Testing",
    "Following eclosion, anesthetize flies on ice. Select flies with genotypes that contain all the genetic elements for MARCM and indicate GFP expression-marked clones will likely be observed based on the observable phenotype markers used in the parent stocks. Decapitate flies with iridectomy scissors.\n\tNote: For example, we selected for flies without the genetic markers CyO (curly wings) and Sb (stubble bristle) to identify flies that would contain all the genetic elements necessary to create mosaic regions marked with GFP.\n\tNote: Decapitation is necessary to prevent the adults from flying away when stimulated.\nPlace headless flies in a closed, moist environment and allow approximately 10 - 20 hr of recovery. Only use flies that right themselves when perturbed for further testing. Test flies within 30 hr of decapitation.\n5. Behavioral Testing\nBy observing decapitated flies under a fluorescence dissecting microscope, identify homozygous clones marked with GFP at the bristle external sensory organs. Record the bristle name and left or right side. To eliminate any potential bias, the lab member performing the bristle stimulation should be blind to the genotype of the bristle, wild-type or mutant.\nElicit a grooming reflex by deflecting the GFP marked bristle towards the fly body with a stiff hair or fine forceps and observe the leg response. Give a score of one to flies that lift their leg in response to bristle stimulation and a score of zero to flies that do not move their legs.\n\tNote: Previous studies6,7 have characterized the leg response that is elicited by stimulating a particular bristle. This includes the leg that responds to each bristle and the proportion of flies that respond to stimulation of that particular bristle. We only scored for movements of the leg that we expected to respond based on Vandervorst's classification6.",
