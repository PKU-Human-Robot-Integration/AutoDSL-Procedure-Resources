    "All surgical procedures were subjected to ethical review and approved by the government of Upper Bavaria (reference number: 55.2-1-54-2532.3-13-13 and -2532-136-11). Animals are male C57BL/6 mice with a body weight of approximately 25 g.\n1. Animal Preparation\nInduce anesthesia by putting the mouse into a chamber. Flush the chamber with 5% isoflurane until the animal loses consciousness.\nInject premixed anesthetics intraperitoneally: fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg). Check reflexes before and regularly during the procedure. Reinject one third of the initial amount hourly to maintain anesthesia.\nIntubate orotracheally with a tube made from a 20 G venous catheter11. For intubation fix the animal on a slanted platform (30°), retract the tongue with bent forceps, visualize the vocal cords under an operation microscope and insert the tube into the trachea during inspiration.\nPlace the mouse in a prone position and check the correct placement of the tube with a piece of cotton or a microcapnograph.\nConnect the intubation tube to the respirator. Ventilate the mouse with room air supplemented with 25% oxygen with a frequency of 180-220 breaths/min and a stroke volume of 200-250 μl.\nConnect the intubation tube to the microcapnograph. Maintain the end-expiratory pCO2 at 30 mmHg by adjusting the ventilation frequency.\nInsert a rectal temperature probe and place the animal on a heating pad in order to maintain 37 °C core body temperature.\nApply the annular pulsoximeter sensor on the right hind paw.\nOpen the skin above the skull with a pair of scissors. The incision should be approximately 0.5 cm long and between ear and eye.\nDissect the left temporal muscle with a scalpel from the temporal bone.\nGlue the laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) probe on the left temporal bone. Hold the probe in a fixed position until the glue hardens.",
    "Drill a hole of approximately 1.5 mm diameter with a dental drill into the left temporal bone. Cool the bone with saline to prevent heat damage.\nInsert the ICP probe into the cranial cavity. Push forward as dorsally as possible to prevent brain tissue damage and bleeding.\nIf the probe is at the right position, fix, and seal it with cement. Let the cement dry for 5 min.\nTurn the mouse carefully to a supine position.\nFor continuous blood pressure monitoring, catheterize the left femoral artery.\nConnect the femoral catheter to the blood pressure monitoring device.\n2. SAH Induction\nOpen the skin with a pair of scissors from sternum to chin (2 cm). Dissect the connective tissue bluntly and push the salivary glands aside.\nExpose the left common carotid artery (CCA) and mobilize it. Preserve the vagal nerve, which runs in the same connective tissue sheath as the CCA. Move cranial and expose and mobilize the ICA and the ECA using the same technique.\nLigate the ECA as far cranially as possible.\nPrearrange two more ligations for the filament around the ECA.\nOcclude the CCA and the ICA temporarily with microclips. Position the microclips with a microclip applicator. Make sure the clips are applied correctly by gently pulling them back.\nCut a hole for the filament insertion into the ECA with a vessel scissors.\nInsert a Prolene 5-0 filament with 12 mm length into the ECA.\nClose the insertion site with one prearranged ligation.\nRemove the microclips with a microclip applicator from the CCA and the ICA.\nAdvance the filament with a forceps into the ICA until the ICP rises. A sudden rise of the ICP indicates bleeding induction.",
    "Withdraw the filament immediately and ligate the ECA by closing both prearranged ligations consecutively. This prevents bleeding out of the insertion site.\nSuture the skin wound.\nMonitor the physiologic parameters of the animal for another 20 min.\nRemove ICP and LDF probes and suture the skin wound.\n3. End of Experiment\nPerfuse the animal transcardially with 20 ml of saline (room temperature) followed by 20 ml of 4% PFA in PBS (4 °C).\nDissect the brain out of the skull. Cut the skull in the midline and between the orbital cavities. Then peel the bone from the brain.\nEvaluate the blood distribution in the subarachnoid space.\n4. Considerations in Case of Survival Surgery (not shown in the video)\nInject Carprofen (4 mg/kg subcutaneously) for postoperative analgesia directly after anesthesia induction. During the postoperative observation period Carprofen (4 mg/kg subcutaneously) is injected every 24 hr.\nInstead of invasive blood pressure measurement make use of a noninvasive blood pressure monitoring system.\nFor termination of anesthesia inject antagonizing agents subcutaneously: naloxone (1.2 mg/kg), flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) and atipamezole (2.5 mg/kg).\nExtubate the animal.\nAfter regaining of reflexes put the animal into a preheated chamber. Keep the animal at approximately 32 °C for 24 hr.\nAnimals are checked regularly for spontaneous breathing and their general condition during the first hours after surgery. If the brain stem is affected animals have breathing problems and should be euthanized. \nAnimals are checked daily for their general condition and body weight as well as for neurological and sensory deficits15.\nSubscription Required.
