    "Calculate the average amount of RNA per cell (see Note 2)Prior to initiating this portion of the protocol, ensure that you have bench space, pipettes, and pipette tips that are clean and suitable for working with RNA (see Note 3).Culture cells in a 6 cm dish until they are 60% to 80% confluent.Preheat cell culture media and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to 37 °C; once warmed, clean the bottles containing media, trypsin-EDTA, and 1x PBS with 70% ethanol and place them in a biological-safety cabinet.Create a 0.125% trypsin solution by diluting the 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution with an equal volume of 1x PBS.Remove cultured cells from the incubator and place them in a biological-safety cabinet.Aspirate the media from the cells using a disposable glass Pasteur pipet (or equivalent).Wash cells on the plate by gently adding 4 ml of 1x PBS and then aspirating it.Add 2 ml of 0.125% Trypsin solution to the cells and let the cell plate stand in the biological-safety cabinet at room temperature for 3 min.Note: Dissociation protocols may differ for your cell type. Using a clean 5 ml serological pipet attached to a pipet aid, pipet the trypsinized cell solution up and down against the plate to obtain a single-cell suspension.Transfer the trypsinized cell solution to a 15 ml conical tube that contains 8 ml of culture media with 10% serum.Invert the 15 ml conical tube 10-15 times to obtain a homogenous solution.Using a P20 micropipette, remove 12 μl of cell suspension and carefully pipette it into the bottom of a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube.Repeat Steps A11 and A12 one more time to obtain two replicates for cell counting.",
    "Add 12 μl of Trypan Blue solution to each of the 12 μl cell suspensions and mix by pipetting, taking care to keep the Trypan Blue/cell solution at the bottom of the tube.Separately, spin down the remainder of the trypsinized cell solution (~10 ml; in the 15 ml conical) in a centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 rpm (~200 x g).During the spin, clean the hemocytometer and glass coverslip with a Kimwipe sprayed with 70% ethanol, to remove any particulates.Add 12 μl of the Trypan Blue cell suspension to the hemocytometer, ensuring that the solution distributes evenly underneath the coverslip.Under a 20x objective, count the non-blue cells within each of the four hemocytometer quandrants, keeping track of the counts in each quadrant with a hand tally counter.Calculate the number of cells per ml using the equation below, then average the cell-count-per-ml between replicates:Replicate 1, # of cells per ml = [(sum of counts in all 4 quadrants)/4]*2*104Replicate 2, # of cells per ml = [(sum of counts in all 4 quadrants)/4]*2*104Average # of cells per ml = (Replicate 1 counts + Replicate 2 counts)/2After the spin from Step A15 has completed, remove the trypsin-containing media taking care not to disturb the cell pellet, add 10 ml of 1x PBS, mix by pipeting, and spin down the PBS/cell solution in a centrifuge for 5 min at 1,250 rpm (~300 x g).Remove the PBS, replace it with another 10 ml of 1x PBS, mix by pipetting, and spin down the cell solution in a centrifuge for 5 min at 1,250 rpm (~300 x g).Remove all traces of PBS and add 1ml of TRIzol to the cell pellet (see Note 4).Using a P1000, pipette up and down ~15x to lyse the cells and maximize the efficiency of RNA extraction.",
    "Place the cell/TRIzol mixture into a -80 °C freezer.Repeat Steps A1-A24 at least three times, ideally on separate days, to obtain biological replicates.Remove the TRIzol suspensions from the freezer and let them thaw at room temperature.Once thawed, let the TRIzol suspensions sit for 5 min at room temperature to help ribonucleoprotein complexes dissociate (see Note 5).Add 0.2 ml of chloroform to the TRIzol suspension, vortex vigorously for ~20 s, and let the sample stand at room temperature for another 2 min.Centrifuge the sample for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.Transfer the aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new 1.7 ml tube (~0.5 ml).Add 10 μl of linear acrylamide to the extracted aqueous phase and vortex vigorously.Add 0.5 ml of isopropanol to the aqueous phase (amount roughly equal to the volume of the aqueous phase), and vortex vigorously.Incubate for ≥1 h at -20 °C (this step differs from the manufacturer’s instructions for purification of RNA from TRIzol).Centrifuge the sample at top speed for 30 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C (> 12,000 x g; see Note 6).Using a P1000, remove the water/isopropanol solution, being mindful not to remove the RNA pellet, which should be located below the hinge of the microcentrifuge tube.To the precipitated RNA pellet, gently add 1 ml of an ice-cold mixture of 80% ethanol and 20% RNase-free water.Using a P1000, remove the 80% ethanol, being mindful not to remove the RNA pellet.Pulse-spin the 1.7 ml tube in a mini-centrifuge to bring the residual ethanol from the sides of the tube down to the bottom.Using a P200 pipette and tip, remove the remaining 80% ethanol.Repeat Steps A38-A39 until no 80% ethanol remains.Re-suspend the pellet in 30 μl of RNase-free water.",
    "Let the RNA-containing solution stand for 1 h at room temperature with intermittent mixing (every 15 min) by flicking or vortexing and then pulse-spinning the tube, or by pipetting the solution up and down (see Note 7).After the RNA has dissolved, quantify the concentration of RNA using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.An ideal ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm for RNA is between ~1.8 and ~2.If the RNA is contaminated with residual ethanol, phenol, or guanidine, or if the RNA is not completely dissolved, the 260/280 ratio will be lower, usually < 1.6.See Thermo Fisher's technical notes on NanoDrop Spectrophotometers for more information.Next, determine whether the purified RNA is intact. To do this, set up a gel electrophoresis apparatus and prepare a 1% agarose/0.0001% ethidium bromide gel with 1x TAE buffer. Submerge the agarose gel in 1x TAE buffer.In a 1.7 ml tube, mix ~250-500 ng of RNA with an appropriate amount of glycerol-based agarose gel loading buffer.In separate lanes of the agarose gel, load the RNA/gel loading mixture as well as 0.5-1 μg of DNA ladder (the latter sample provides a size reference).Run the samples in 1x TAE about ~8 cm through the agarose gel, at a voltage of 5 V/cm of distance between electrodes.Take a picture of the gel on an appropriate gel imaging system. Intact RNA purified from a typical mammalian cell should yield two distinct bands running at apparent sizes of ~1,500 and ~750 nucleotides relative to the DNA ladder, which correspond to the 28s and 18s rRNA species, respectively (Figure 2; see Note 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200926/20200926101551_5346.pngFigure 2. RNA run on a 1% agarose gel pre-stained with ethidium bromide. Relative to the DNA size ladder, the 28S and 18S rRNA species migrate at approximate sizes of ~1,400 and ~750 nucleotides, respectively.",
    "If the RNA is intact, proceed to calculate the weight of RNA per cell:RNA-per-cell = [concentration of RNA in g/L] x [volume in L of water used to resuspend RNA (e.g., 30 x 10-6 L)]/[the number of cells lysed in TRIzol]Calculate the average of the RNA-per-cell numbers obtained from biological replicate RNA preparations (see Note 9).Prepare cDNA libraries for RNA-Seq (see Notes 10, 11, 12, and 13)Ensure that cDNA libraries are prepared from two or more biological replicate RNA preparations (see Note 14).For each sample to be sequenced, aliquot 1 μg of total cellular RNA in a total volume of 8 μl of RNase-free water.To each sample add 2 μl of a fresh 1:100 dilution of ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix #1 (see Note 15).Starting with the mixture of ERCC Spike-in RNA and 1 μg of total cellular RNA, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cDNA library preparation. We follow the instructions essentially as they are written in the user technical datasheet from KAPA (Note 16). The following are inputs required from the user:From Section 6 of the technical datasheet (“RNA Elution, Fragmentation and Priming”), we select the fragmentation conditions of 6 min at 94 °C, which will generate 200-300 nucleotide-long RNA fragments.From Section 12 of the technical datasheet (“Library Amplification”), we perform PCR amplification of our final cDNA library using only half of our purified cDNA library (i.e., 10 μl of cDNA library in a 50 μl PCR reaction), rather than all 20 μl of library in the 50 μl reaction (see Note 17).From cDNA libraries prepared using 1 μg of total RNA, using half of the purified cDNA library, we typically perform 11 cycles of PCR for the final amplification step.Using a Qubit fluorometer, quantify the concentration of DNA in the PCR-amplified, purified cDNA library (see Note 18).",
    "Prepare a 1% agarose/0.0001% ethidium bromide gel with 1x TAE buffer. Submerge the agarose gel in 1x TAE buffer.Run 2 μl (1/10th) of the amplified cDNA library ~6 cm into the agarose gel, alongside of 250 ng of 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder.Image the agarose gel and estimate the average size in base pairs of each prepared cDNA library (see Note 19).Calculate the molarity of the purified cDNA library:The average molecular weight of a DNA base-pair is 650 Daltons, or 650 g/mole.Using the average length determined in Step B8 above, calculate the molar weight of the cDNA library:[cDNA library g/mole] = [average_length] x 650 g/moleNow, using the DNA concentration determined in Step B5 above, calculate the molarity of the cDNA library (see Note 20):[cDNA library moles/Liter] = [cDNA library concentration in ng/μl]) x ( [1 x 10-9 g]/[1 x 10-6 L])*(1/[cDNA library g/mole])Pool together the cDNA libraries to be sequenced in a way that will ensure an equimolar amount of each library is present in the pool and that each library will be sequenced to a depth of > 20 million reads (see Notes 21 and 22).Sequence the pooled cDNA libraries on an Illumina platform (see Note 23)."
