An overview of the experimental workflow\n      is included in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\n    \n        Prepare mouse dissection area.\n        \n            Place absorbent pad and set aside large blunt scissors, fine\n            forceps, spring scissors, and spatula (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\n          \n            Pre-fill one syringe per animal with 0.4 mL of anesthetic solution.\n          \n        Pre-fill 12-well plate with 4 mL glyoxal solution per well (one well per\n        tissue processed) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Place all buffers and\n        12-well plate on ice.\n        \n            Obtain mouse of interest, administer 400 μL of anesthetic\n            intraperitoneally. Wait until unresponsive to foot and tail pinch.\n          \n            Perform cervical dislocation, remove the head with large scissors,\n            remove head skin and muscle with operating scissors and open the\n            skull by inserting fine butterfly scissors posterior of the\n            cerebellum.\n            \nCut along the midline and on each side of the brain.\n                Remove skull with fine forceps and obtain the brain with\n                spatula.\n              \n            Place brain in petri dish containing ice-cold 1X PBS. Dissect cortex\n            and cerebellum as fast as possible.\n          \n            Place each dissected brain region inside one well of a 12-well plate\n            pre-filled with 4 mL of ice-cold glyoxal fixation solution.\n            \n                Mince tissue with scissors into fragments of approximately\n                9 mm3 in size (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\n              \n                Let plate with tissues sit on ice for 15 min.\n                \nNote: To prevent\n                  cross-contamination, clean scissors with 70% ethanol cleaning\n                  solution after each tissue is processed.\n                \nNote: If a large piece of\n                  tissue is being processed (e.g. a whole brain), fixation can\n                  be done in tubes. It is crucial that tissue is completely\n                  submerged in the fixative.\n                \n            After 15 min, tilt plate at an angle of 45° and, with a P1000",
    "pipette tip, remove as much glyoxal fixation solution as possible.\n            Avoid removing tissue pieces.\n          \n            Perform 2x washes with ice-cold PBS1X: add 4 mL of PBS1X and remove\n            as much of it as possible, as detailed in step e. Repeat this twice.\n            Fixed tissues are now ready for homogenization and obtention of\n            nuclei.\n            \nNote: If processing several mice\n              at a time, dissected tissues can be stored in ice-cold PBS1X and\n              on ice for the length of the dissection. Fixation can be started\n              once all tissues are gathered. We have successfully processed up\n              to 16 tissue samples in parallel in this way.\n            \nNote: Prepare and dispose of\n              anesthetics, and discard glyoxal fixative solution following your\n              institution’s environmental health and safety guidelines.\n            \nNote: To minimize the potential\n              effects of acute hypoxia in the brain, it is recommended to use\n              anesthesia rather than CO2 inhalation as the euthanasia procedure\n              for this protocol.\n            \nStep 2) Tissue homogenization and nuclei isolation\nTiming: 10 min per dissected tissue\n    \n      This section outlines the process for obtaining nuclei from glyoxal-fixed\n      tissue. This procedure involves two main steps: tissue homogenization and\n      debris elimination using a density gradient with iodixanol.\n    \n        Tissue homogenization.\n        \n            With forceps, transfer fixed and washed tissue pieces into Dounce\n            homogenizer containing 3 mL NIM-T solution (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\n          \n            Use pestle A to homogenize tissue. Gently slide up and down 10 times\n            or until tissue pieces are completely disaggregated. Replace pestle\n            A.\n          \n            Repeat the previous step using pestle B. Replace pestle B.\n            Homogenate should look like Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D.\n          \n            Add 2 mL of 50% iodixanol to tissue suspension and mix 5 times with\n            a P1000 pipette set to 500 μL.\n          \n        Debris elimination and nuclei isolation.\n        \n            Decant suspension onto cell strainer in a 50 mL conical tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Tissue suspension should be filtered into the tube.",
    "Replace strainer with cap and place on ice.\n            Transfer filtered tissue suspension into a high-speed centrifugation\n            tube.\n            \nNote: Ensure that you carefully\n              collect and transfer the entire sample, including any sample that\n              may have splashed onto the walls of the tube.\n            \n            Load serological pipette with 2.5 mL 25% iodixanol and lower all the\n            way to the bottom of the tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F-left).\n          \n            Very slowly, dispense 2.5 mL of 25% iodixanol below the tissue\n            suspension. 2 density layers should be observed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F-center & right).\n            \nNote: Refer to\n              troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section,\n              problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1], if 2 density layers are not\n              observed.\n            \n            Gently remove pipette to avoid disruption of the density gradient.\n          \n            Spin down at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Use floor\n            centrifuge with a swinging rotor (Sorvall RC 6+, Thermo Fisher\n            Scientific).\n            \nNote: After centrifugation, a\n              pellet (nuclei) and debris in upper layers of the gradient should\n              be observed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G)\n            \nDiscard supernatant containing debris.\n            Add 1 mL of ice-cold 1X PBS/1% BSA to the nuclei pellet and\n            resuspend by pipetting 5 times with a P1000 pipette set to 0.5 mL.\n          \n            Transfer nuclei suspension into a 1.6 mL micro-centrifuge tube.\n            Place on ice.\n            \nNote: 1.6 mL micro-centrifuge\n              tubes do not need to be coated for this step.\n            \n            Use 10 μL of nuclei suspension for nuclei counting with a\n            hemocytometer or cell counter.\n            \nNote: Refer to\n              troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section,\n              problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], if nuclei look very aggregated.\n            \nStep 3) Antibody staining and FACS\nTiming: 4 h\n      This section details the procedure of antibody staining of nuclei\n      suspensions and provides tips for FACS-purification of\n      Sox9+NeuN- and NeuN+ nuclei.\n    \n        Antibody staining of nuclei suspensions.\n        \n            Stain nuclei with Hoechst: add 2.5 μL of 2 mM Hoechst solution to\n            each 1 mL of sample suspension.

Mix\n            with pipette 5–10 times.\n            \nNote: Stain up to 5 × 106\n              nuclei in 50 μL of Primary Antibody solution. Volume should be\n              proportionally adjusted with larger number of nuclei.\n            \nCritical: Make sure pellet is\n              very well resuspended in Primary Antibody solution (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H, right).\n            \n            Place on ice for 1 h (protect tubes from light by covering ice\n            bucket).\n          \n            Wash step: add 450 μL of 1X PBS/1% BSA and centrifuge at 1,000 × g\n            for 5 min at 4°C.\n          \n            Remove supernatant. Add 50 μL Secondary Antibody solution. Mix with\n            pipette 5–10 times.\n            \nCritical: Make sure pellet is\n              very well resuspended in Secondary Antibody solution.\n            \n            Place on ice for 1 h (protect tubes from light by covering ice\n            bucket).\n          \n            Wash step: add 450 μL of 1X PBS/1% BSA and centrifuge at 1,000 × g\n            for 5 min at 4°C.\n          \n            Remove supernatant. Re-suspend pellet in 500 μL of 1X PBS/1% BSA.\n          \n            Use 10 μL of nuclei suspension for nuclei counting with a\n            hemocytometer or cell counter.\n          \n            Samples are ready for FACS-purification.\n            \nCritical: Nuclei concentration\n              for FACS-purification should be up to 5–10 × 106\n              nuclei/mL.\n            \nNote: If a staining control for\n              Sox9 needs to be included, prepare Primary Antibody solution with\n              only mouse anti-NeuN-Alexa Fluor 488 (EMD Millipore), and without\n              anti-Sox9 antibody. Staining with Secondary Antibody solution\n              should be performed normally, as described for non-control\n              samples.\n            \nNote: Given that fluorescent\n              properties of neuron nuclei can complicate astrocyte enrichment by",

(A) Gating strategy to FACS-purify\n                  Sox9+NeuN- and NeuN+ nuclei in adult and aged cortex (CTX) and\n                  cerebellum (CB) was as follows: a Hoechst vs. FSC-A plot was\n                  used to gate Hoechst+ nuclei, and single nuclei\n                  were gated in FSC-A vs. FSC-W, and SSC-A vs. SSC-W plots, as\n                  in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A. Lastly, NeuN vs. Sox9 plots\n                  were generated, and polygon gates were drawn around\n                  Sox9+NeuN- and NeuN+ nuclei.\n                  Gate numbers indicate the percentage of single nuclei that are\n                  Sox9+NeuN- or NeuN+. (B) To\n                  confirm post-sort nuclei purity, 10 μL of sorted nuclei\n                  suspension were added to 90 μL 1X PBS/1% BSA in a fresh FACS\n                  tube, and 50–150 events were recorded.
