    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.\n1. Preparation\nInject the mouse intraperitoneally with heparin (1 unit/g mouse body weight) and allow it to ambulate for 2 min.\nEuthanize the animal in a CO2 chamber.\nArrange the mouse in a supine position on a surgical board and secure all four limbs to the board with tape. Use magnification for fine dissection.\n2. Exposing lungs and trachea\nSpray the ventral side of the mouse with 70% ethanol to minimize hair interference.\nGrasp the abdominal skin with forceps and make a small incision with scissors in the umbilical region. Slide the tips of scissors into the fascial layer between the abdominal musculature and skin and begin separating the two layers. Work rostrally, removing the skin from the abdomen, ribcage, and neck.\nOpen the abdominal musculature with scissors and cut laterally on both sides until the diaphragm is exposed.\nGently grasp the xiphoid process and slightly lift the ribcage maximizing the view of the caudal lungs through the thin, semitransparent diaphragm. Carefully make a small incision in the diaphragm just beneath the xiphoid process. The lungs will collapse and retract away from the diaphragm. Dissect the diaphragm away from the ribcage, taking care not to nick the lung parenchyma.\nLocate and sever the inferior vena cava (IVC) and esophagus where they pass through the diaphragm. Use gauze to clean up any pooling blood in the thoracic cavity, avoiding contact with the lungs.\nGrasp the xiphoid once again and gently lift. Cut the ribcage bilaterally (roughly at the midaxillary line) avoiding contact with the lungs. Remove the anterior ribcage entirely, making the final cut along the sternal angle just before the manubrium.",
    "Using a prefilled syringe, liberally wet the lungs with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to prevent drying out. Continue this routine throughout the procedure.\nUsing forceps, grasp the manubrium and gently elevate away from the body. Using scissors, cut 1-2 mm lateral to the manubrium, severing clavicles, and remove. This will expose the thymus underneath.\nGrasp each lobe of the thymus, pull apart, and remove. Repeat this procedure with the submandibular gland. Finally, remove the muscular tissue overlaying the trachea.\n\tNOTE: Following the dissection, the heart, ascending aorta (AA), pulmonary arterial trunk (PAT), and trachea should be visible. Ensure the primary arterial branches off the trunk are not divided or injured.\n3. PA catheterization and blood perfusion\nTo assemble Unit 1, thread 15 cm of PE-10 tubing onto the hub of a 30 G needle and attach to a 1 mL syringe prefilled with 10-4 M sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in PBS. Prime the tubing by advancing the plunger until all the air is purged from this unit ( Figure 1).\n\tCAUTION: SNP is toxic if swallowed. Avoid contact with the skin and eyes. Wash skin thoroughly after handling. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment.\n\t\nAlternatively, assemble Unit 2. For mice postnatal day 7 (P7) and younger, use a hemostat to detach an additional 30 G needle from its hub and thread the needle onto the open end of the tubing of Unit 1 (Figure 1).",
    "Instead of a needle, use curved sharp forceps to grasp one end of a 10 cm length of 7-0 silk. Penetrate the apex of the heart entering from one side and passing the tips of the forceps through the muscle and out of the other side. Grasp the silk with another set of forceps and pull approximately a 2 cm length through and tie off. Take the remaining 8 cm end of the suture, tugging the heart caudally, and tape the end to the surgical board.\n\tNOTE: This will create tension, further exposing the great vessels and tethering the heart in place, allowing for easier placement of the catheter in the pulmonary artery.\nHook the tips of curved forceps under both the AA and PAT. Pull a 3 cm length of 7-0 silk back through the opening and create a single-throw loose suture.\nUsing scissors make a 1-2 mm incision toward the apex of the heart, penetrating the thin-walled right ventricle (RV), to allow for the insertion of the catheter (Unit 1). Prior to the insertion, confirm there is no air in the system. Introduce the primed tubing into the right ventricle and gently advance into the semitransparent thin-walled PAT.\n\t\nVisually verify that the catheter has not advanced into either the left or right pulmonary branches and does not abut the pulmonary artery branchpoint. Using tape, secure the distal portion of the tubing to the surgical board.\n\t\tNOTE: To identify the RV, use forceps to pinch the right side of the heart. Unlike the left ventricle, the relatively thin free wall of the RV should be easily grasped.\nFor mice younger than P7, attach Unit 2 to a micromanipulator and introduce the needle end of the unit into the PAT as described above using the manipulator.",
    "Gently tighten the loose suture around both great vessels and cut the 8 cm length of suture created in step 3.2 to return the heart to a natural resting position. The catheter is now firmly secured within the PAT.\nClip the left auricle of the heart to allow perfusate to exit the system.\nSecure SNP-containing syringe (Unit 1 or Unit 2, size dependent) in the syringe pump and perfuse the solution at a rate of 0.05 mL/min to flush the blood and maximally dilate the vasculature. Blood/perfusate will exit via the clipped auricle. Continue perfusion until perfusate runs clear (~200 µL in an adult mouse, less for younger animals).\n\tNOTE: When perfusing the low viscosity PBS/SNP, a relatively higher infusion rate was used in the interest of saving time. The more viscous polymer compound is infused at a slower rate to prevent overfilling, rupture, and maximize control over distal endpoints.\n4. Tracheostomy and lung inflation\nConstruct the lung inflation unit (Figure 2).\n\t\nConnect a flexible plastic 24 G intravenous (IV) catheter (needle removed)/butterfly infusion set to a stopcock, attached to an open 50 mL syringe (no plunger). Hang the syringe from a ring stand.\nAdd 10% buffered formalin to the syringe. Open the stopcock, allowing formalin to enter the tubing and purge all air from the system. Close the stopcock and raise the syringe until the meniscus is 20 cm above the trachea8.\n\t\tCAUTION: Formalin is flammable, carcinogenic, acutely toxic when ingested, and causes skin irritation, serious eye damage, skin sensitization, and germ cell mutagenicity. Avoid ingestion and contact with skin and eyes. Avoid inhalation of the vapor or mist. Keep away from sources of ignition. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment.\nPlace two loose sutures inferior to the cricoid cartilage 2-4 mm apart.",
    "Using scissors, make a small incision in the cricothyroid ligament superior to the sutures.\nInsert the IV catheter into the opening and advance the tip beyond the two loose sutures.\nTighten the sutures around the trachea and open the stopcock. Allow the formalin to enter the lungs by gravity and wait for 5 min for the lungs to fully inflate. If the lungs adhere to the ribcage during inflation, grasp the outside of the ribcage with blunt tipped forceps and move in all directions to assist in freeing the lobes. Do not make direct contact with lungs.\nAfter 5 min, back the IV catheter beyond the first suture and ligate. Repeat for the second suture. The lungs are now inflated in a closed, pressurized state.\n5. Casting the vasculature\n In a 1.5 mL tube, prepare 1 mL of an 8:1:1 solution8 of polymer:diluent:curing agent and gently invert several times to ensure good mixing.\nRemove the plunger from a 1 cc syringe, cover the opposite end with a gloved finger, and pour the polymer compound into the syringe. Carefully reinsert the plunger, invert, and advance the plunger to remove all air and form a meniscus at the tip of the syringe.\nRemove the SNP/PBS syringe from the hub of the needle and drip additional PBS into the hub to create a meniscus. Carefully check the hub for trapped air, dislodge if necessary, and reform the meniscus. Join the hub to the syringe filled with the polymer compound.\n\tNOTE: Creating a meniscus on both ends significantly reduces the chance for air to enter the system.\nAttach the polymer compound filled syringe to the syringe pump and infuse at 0.02 mL/min.\n\tNOTE: For smaller lungs, a slower rate can be helpful to prevent overfilling but, is not essential.",
    "Monitor the compound as it freely moves down the PE tubing and note the syringe volume as it enters the PAT. Continue filling until all lobes are filled completely down to the capillary level and stop the syringe pump. Check the syringe volume again.\n\tNOTE: After several runs an estimated volume can be used to gauge an approximate endpoint (~35 μL for an adult mouse and ~5 µL for a P1 pup). After the pump is halted, the residual pressure in the system will continue to push the polymer compound into the pulmonary arteries. All lung lobes should fill at a similar rate.\nCover the lungs with a fiber optic cleaning wipe, liberally apply PBS, and allow the carcass to sit undisturbed for 30-40 min at room temperature. During this period, the polymer compound will cure and harden.\nRemove the catheter, sever the arms/lower half of the mouse, and place the head/thorax into a 50 mL conical filled with 10% buffered formalin overnight.\nAfter fixation, grasp the trachea and gently separate the heart/lung unit from the remaining rib cage and thorax. Place the heart/lung block in a formalin filled scintillation vial. Discard the rest.\n6. Alternative vascular beds for casting (Table 1)\nNOTE: Each target vascular bed may require different catheter placements, infusion rates, and optimal filling times. Thus, multiple animals will be necessary to cast multiple organs.\nFor systemic vascular beds superior or inferior to the diaphragm follow steps 1.1-2.5 as above. See additional notes on the portal system and diaphragm (Table 1).\nGrasp the xiphoid process with a hemostat and cut the ribcage bilaterally (roughly in the midaxillary line) just prior to the internal thoracic arteries.\nFold the still connected ribcage over such that it is resting on the animal's neck/head, fully exposing the chest cavity.",
    "Follow step 3.1 above, then remove the lungs. Once the thoracic aorta (TA) is visible, hook the tips of curved forceps underneath it, ~10 mm superior to the diaphragm. Grasp a 3 cm length of 7-0 silk, pull back through the opening under the TA, and create a single-throw loose suture. Repeat this procedure ~8 mm above the diaphragm.\nFor structures superior to the diaphragm, use spring scissors to create a small hole (~30% of the total circumference) on the ventral portion of the TA, ~2 mm inferior to the loose sutures placed in step 6.4.\n\t\nFor structures inferior to the diaphragm, instead, create a small hole ~2 mm superior to the loose sutures.\nDepending on the animal size, introduce Unit 1 or 2 into the vessel, advance beyond loose sutures, and gently ligate the vessel.\nFollow step 3.7, setting the syringe pump at a rate of 1.0 mL/min and perfusing a minimum of 5 mL. Perfusate will exit via the IVC.\nFollow steps 5.1 - 5.4 adjusting the infusion rate to 0.05 mL/min, visually monitoring the target tissue in real-time.\n\tNOTE: Infusion volume will be organ and animal age specific. The volume can be further limited by ligating arterial branches leading to non-target vascular beds (i.e., brain, liver, kidney, intestine).\nFollow 5.6 then remove target tissue and place in formalin.\n7. Sample mount, scan, and reconstruction for micro-CT\nUsing paraffin film, create a flat surface on the scanning bed and center the wet sample on this surface (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: If motion artifact is detected, the sample may require further stabilization.\nLightly tent/cover sample with additional paraffin film to prevent dehydration. Take special care not to rest the paraffin film on the sample causing deformation to the tissue (Figure 3B).",
    "Scan the sample using settings outlined in Table 2 and standardize these parameters within a given experiment.\n\tNOTE: This is experiment/endpoint dependent. Standardize the chosen parameters for the ease of comparison between samples.\nTransfer the reconstructed scans for post-processing and analysis.\nSubscription Required.
