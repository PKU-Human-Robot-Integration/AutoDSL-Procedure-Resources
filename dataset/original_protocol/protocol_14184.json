    "1. Synchronization of C. elegans\nSynchronize C. elegans either via alkaline hypochlorite solution treatment or via simple egg laying for 4 h at 20 °C8.\nGrow and maintain nematodes at 20 °C on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with OP50 E. coli according to standard procedures9. Age the nematodes until the desired developmental stage or day.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, young adults are imaged on day 4 and old nematodes are imaged on day 8 of life.\n2. RNAi-mediated knockdown of chaperone machinery via feeding\nNOTE: Perform knockdown of heat shock protein 1 (hsp-1) chaperone by feeding the corresponding RNAi vector to the nematodes10. The hsp-1 RNAi plasmid was obtained from the Ahringer library (clone ID: F26D10.3).\nGrow the HT115 (DE3) E. coli expressing the hsp-1 RNAi plasmid for 6 h to overnight in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin.\nPrepare fresh NGM agar plates containing isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 1 mM) and ampicillin (25 µg/mL) and seed with the hsp-1 RNAi bacteria. Leave plates to dry and induce at room temperature for 1-3 days.\nPlace synchronized eggs on an siRNA plate and leave to hatch, or place gravid nematodes and allow to lay eggs for 4 h at 20 °C before removing. Grow the nematodes until the desired age or stage.\n\tNOTE: The second generation of nematodes might present a stronger phenotype of the knockdown. The siRNA protocol and conditions described here are general and adapted to hsp1. RNA interference via siRNA of a specific clone/gene needs to be established and optimized by the end user. It is important to note that not all siRNA have the same efficiency, and it is therefore recommended to test the efficacy of the knockdown by quantification by either quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or Western blot.",
    "3. Preparation of microscopy slides\nOn the day of imaging, start by preparing the imaging slides. Melt agarose in ddH2O at a concentration of 3% (w/v) and let cool slightly.\nCut the tip of a 1 mL pipette tip and take roughly 200 µL of melted agarose. Pipette the agarose onto a clean glass slide and immediately place a second one on top, avoiding the formation of any bubbles. Leave to dry and gently remove the top glass slide. The result is a glass slide with an even agarose surface where the nematodes will be positioned.\n\tNOTE: Each slide will be used to image between 5-10 nematodes. Slides can be prepared and stored for a few hours in a humified box to prevent the agarose from drying out.\n4. Mounting nematodes onto microscopy slides\nNOTE: FLIM requires the nematodes to be immobilized. Perform this step once the imaging setup (e.g., microscopes, lasers, detectors) is ready to use.\nUsing a platinum wire pick, place nematodes of the desired age onto a fresh unseeded plate and let them crawl to remove the excess OP50 bacteria from their bodies.\nPrepare the anesthetic compound (sodium azide or levamisole) to immobilize the nematode. Keep a 500 mM NaN3 stock in the dark at 4 °C and dilute in fresh ddH2O to a final concentration of 250 mM. If using levamisole, dilute a 20 mM stock to 2 mM working solution in ddH2O.\n\tCAUTION: Sodium azide (NaN3) is highly toxic. Use gloves and protective eyewear and work under a ventilated hood.",
    "Working under a stereomicroscope, place a 10 µL drop of anesthetic compound onto an agarose pad and gently transfer 5-10 nematodes into it. Use an eyelash tip to separate the nematodes. Keep them close together but not touching to allow for easier localization of the nematodes during image acquisition.\nCarefully overlay the nematodes with a coverslip. Take measurements within 1 h after mounting.\n\tNOTE: Both anesthetics will eventually kill C. elegans. The nematodes must be completely immobile during imaging, because the map of the lifetime is recorded from each pixel. Any movement of the x,y parameters prevents the reading of the lifetime in the same excited pixel.\n5. Acquisition of FLIM data\nNOTE: In this protocol, the lifetime of the fluorophore is acquired via the time-domain TCSPC method. FLIM requires a pulse of light to be generated by the laser at a set and constant repetition rate. The repetition rate varies according to the laser type and needs to be known by the user. Lifetime measurements are achieved by detectors and electronic equipment installed alongside a conventional microscope. In this protocol, measurements are performed on three different laser scanning confocal microscopes with detectors and software provided by two different companies (Table of Materials) for acquisition of mRFP, CFP, and YFP lifetimes, respectively. Check that the correct filters of emission/excitation are in place and minimize any background or monitor backlight before starting. Before starting any experiment, establish the photostability of the chosen fluorophore. If the fluorophore bleaches within a short time within the nematode tissues, it is not suitable for FLIM measurements in C. elegans.\nOpen the FLIM acquisition software. The FLIM software also allows control of the confocal microscope. Locate the tab/button to allow for the detector's outputs to be enabled and press Enable Outputs.",
    "Acquire the instrument response function (IRF), which describes the timing precision of the instrumental setup.\n\tNOTE: This step should be performed preferably before mounting the nematodes.\n\t\nIf available, remove the excitation/emission filters.\nPlace an empty coverslip above the objective and find its surface. Record the scatter signal obtained from the coverslip for a minimum of 30 s.\n\t\tNOTE: For lifetimes of several nanoseconds, the acquisition software can automatically estimate the IRF shift. Acquiring an IRF is always recommended.\nPlace the slide with the mounted C. elegans on the stage. Using a 10x magnification lens in transmission mode and localize the position of the nematodes on the slide.\nRemove the slide, switch the objective to a 63x magnification lens, and apply the required immersion medium (e.g., oil). Replace the slide on the stage and localize the nematodes.\nLocate the Pinhole Manager on the acquisition software and open it to the Maximum. Start scanning the sample, select a region of interest (e.g., head, upper body), and focus on its maximum projection plane.\nMonitor the laser pulse rate and the three other values present on the interface of the software: The Constant Fraction Discriminator (CFD), the Time-to-Amplitude (TAC), and the Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC).",
    "NOTE: The laser should have a maximum gate of 1 x 108 single photon counts. This number represents the maximum number of photons supplied by the laser. The CFD provides information on the receipt of the single photon pulse in reference to the laser pulse by the detector. This value should be roughly 1 x 105. The TAC discriminates between the time one photon was detected and the next laser pulse. Finally, the ADC converts the TAC voltage into a storable memory signal11. The CFD, TAC, and ADC should all have similar values to ensure that photons emitted by the fluorophore are not lost. Correct evaluation of these parameters ensures that enough photons are being collected to create an accurate lifetime map.\nOn the interface of the FLIM software, preview the number of photons detected: the ADC value should be between 1 x 104 and 1 x 105. If necessary, shift the focus on a different plane or increase the laser power to collect more photons.\n\tNOTE: In general, the number of recorded photons per second should not exceed 1% of the laser's repetition rate.\nIn the menu bar, select the tab to set the acquisition parameters. Select scan sync in to allow for single photon detection.\nSet the acquisition to a fixed amount of time or a fixed number of photons. For example, acquire a lifetime decay curve for 2 min or until a single pixel reaches a photon count of 2,000 single events. Press Start to begin acquisition.",
    "NOTE: Different fluorophores will require different excitation and emission lasers and filters. According to the brightness of the sample, the laser power can also be adjusted, which will not interfere with the lifetime. These protocols use the following excitation/emission settings: YFP ex500/em520-50 nm, mRFP ex561/em580-620 nm. A pulsed two photon laser was employed for CFP measurements using ex800/em440 nm. The amount of time and photon count required for acquisition of a FLIM map will need to be empirically established for each setup and each experimental purpose.\n6. Analysis of FLIM data using FLIMfit software\nNOTE: Perform data analysis using the FLIMfit software tool developed at Imperial College London12 (see Figure 1).\nOpen the software and import FLIM data files via File | Load FLIM Data. Load all samples from one condition, even if obtained in different sessions and from different biological repeats.\nIf necessary, segment a single nematode from any FLIM picture via Segmentation | Segmentation Manager. Drag the cropping tool around the area of interest until it is highlighted. Once completed, press OK.\n\tNOTE: Segmentation must be done for all images.\nSelect a small region where the intensity-based image of a C. elegans appears (Figure 1, Arrows 1). The decay curve of that region will appear in the large decay window on the right side of the interface (Figure 1, Arrow 2).\n\tNOTE: The decay can be displayed linearly or logarithmically.\nSet the correct parameters to extrapolate the lifetime via the software's algorithm as described in steps 6.5-6.8.\nOn the Data tab (Figure 1, Arrow 3):\n\t\nSet an arbitrary Integrated Minimum value to exclude any pixels that are too dim to produce a good fit. Depending on the C. elegans sample this value varies from 40-300. Input different values until a satisfactory preview is achieved.",
    "Select a Time Min and a Time Max number to limit the FLIM signal to these values. All events that appear before and after this threshold will be excluded.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, for the analysis of mRFP, the events prior to 800 ps and after 4,000 ps were excluded. These values depend on the lifetime of the fluorophore and need to be determined by the end user.\nDo not change the preset Counts/Photon of 1.\nInput the Repetition Rate, in MHz, of the laser utilized during acquisition.\n\t\tNOTE: For the current protocol, different lasers were utilized with various repetition rates. The two photon laser used for acquisition of CFP lifetimes possesses a repetition rate of 80 MHz, for YFP the laser repeats at 40 MHz, and for mRFP the value is 78.01 MHz. These values were inputted into FLIMfit according to the sample analyzed.\nInput a Gate Max value to exclude all saturated pixels.\n\t\tNOTE: For lifetime measurements in C. elegans, this value is set to any large number (e.g., 1 x 108).\nOn the Lifetime tab, select a global fitting to be used (e.g., a pixel-wise fitting). See Figure 1, Arrow 4.\n\tNOTE: A Pixel-wise fitting will produce a decay fitted to each individual pixel. An Image-wise fitting will produce a global fitting of each individual image and display a single lifetime value per image. A Global-wise fitting will produce a single fitting across the whole dataset. A single lifetime value is provided for all images.\nDo not change any other parameter except for the No. Exp selection if it is known that the chosen fluorescence decay is multiexponential and exhibits more than a single lifetime.\n\tNOTE: In the present protocol, this function was utilized to calculate the lifetimes of the biexponential CFP fluorophore.",
    "Upload the IRF via the IRF menu: IRF | Load IRF. To estimate the IRF shift, select IRF | Estimate IRF Shift. A set of values will automatically appear on the IRF tab. Once this is established, do not change any other parameters of this tab.\nOnce all parameters are set, press Fit Dataset (Figure 1, Arrow 5). The algorithm will produce a fit for the decay curve and establish a lifetime value for each image.\n\tNOTE: The resulting fit, highlighted in a blue line, should overlap with all the events. A good fit is obtained when all events are aligned along the fit.\nClick the Parameters tab (Figure 1, Arrow 6), located within the top right menus of the software's interface, and select Statistic: w_mean (weighted mean) and check that the chi2 value is as close as possible to 1.\n\tNOTE: A chi2 close to one ensures the accuracy of the fit. The lifetime value of the selected image is thus revealed as tau_1.\nExport any information of interest: File | Export Intensity Images/Fit Result Table/Images/Histograms. Save the data settings used to calculate the lifetime: File | Save Data Settings.\n\tNOTE: The parameters employed will be saved for future analysis of the selected samples.\n7. Graphical representations of FLIM data\nNOTE: The lifetimes collected from different samples can be visually represented in various ways. Select to denote the lifetime values either in nanoseconds or picoseconds.\nShow the quality of the fit and the accuracy of the curve by exporting the decay curve directly from FLIMfit.\nRepresent the distribution of the photons by plotting the frequency of the photon count versus the lifetime value in a histogram.",
    "Finally, for statistical comparison, if comparing two or more samples, place lifetime values plus standard deviation of the mean in a scatter plot bar graph. Perform any desired statistical analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
