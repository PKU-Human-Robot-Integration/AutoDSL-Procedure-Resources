    "Figure 1: Disposition of samples in the assay plates. B1 to G11 are well coordinates in the microplates and describe the positions where the sample dilutions are placed. Missing coordinates are wells filled with controls and assay culture medium (A1-A12 and H1-H12). This random distribution of samples (forward and reverse dilutions in the microplates) helps to eliminate bias in the results due to the evaporation of medium or other variables. It is best that each microplate is done by one analyst at a time. R: Reference, S: sample, CS: control sample, Dil: dilution.

    "Figure 2: Dose-response curve. Anti-TNFα mAb concentration versus luminescence (cell viability) is depicted. A fourth parameter equation describing the anti-TNFα protection of mAbs was used as a model. EC50 is the concentration of mAb that can neutralize the amount of TNFα that cause 50% cell death in each assay, exemplified in the graph as the change in slope. Bars describe the standard deviation of luminescence for each mAb concentration. x represents anti-TNFα Ab concentration and is depicted as a logarithmic function in ng/mL, while y represents the luminescence response in arbitrary luminescence units.

This value will be used to compare the reference substance, analytical sample, and control sample by means of the effector function.\nFor calculating the relative potencies, fix the reference substance to 100% and calculate the potencies of the sample and control accordingly.\n\tNOTE: Those values are depicted in Figure 3.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55376/55376fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Mathematical equation used for calculating the EC50s and their values. EC50 values, or C parameters, have their uncertainty depicted as standard error. A comparison of EC50s between the sample and reference results of relative potency is also depicted.
