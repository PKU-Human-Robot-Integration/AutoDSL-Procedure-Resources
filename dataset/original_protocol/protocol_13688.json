    "The study was approved by the Committee of Animal Research following the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Information on the animal model (Rats)\nUse an operating microscope (see Table of Materials) with up to 20x magnification for all surgical procedures.\nUse syngeneic (such as Lewis-Lewis) or allogeneic (such as Lewis-Brown Norway) strains for the transplants as needed for the experiment.\nUse rats of age between 5-7 weeks and bodyweight of 100-200 g that are appropriate for the experimental question.\n2. Removal of fur, preparation of the skin, and anesthesia\nPerform all operations under sterile conditions.\n\tNOTE: The step is performed in a dedicated surgical space and under sterile conditions.\nPlace the rats into an anesthetic induction chamber and induce anesthesia with 5% isoflurane in oxygen. Maintain anesthesia with 3.5% isoflurane in oxygen throughout the procedure.\nFor the donor operation, remove the rat's fur from the umbilicus to the sternal notch using fur clippers. For the recipient operation, clip the hair over the surgical field at the posterior axillary line from the ribs to the pelvis. Next, prepare the skin with a surgical disinfectant.\nObtain a surgical plane of anesthesia before starting the procedure. Confirm adequate depth of anesthesia by firmly compressing the toes of the rat with forceps. If the rat withdraws to pain, titrate the anesthetic as needed.\nMonitor the respiratory rate and the depth of anesthesia clinically throughout the procedure; the level of isoflurane is adjusted as needed to maintain a breathing rate of 55-65 breaths/min.\n3. Donor operation",
    "Prepare and anesthetize the rat as stated in step 2. Incise the skin from the xiphoid to the sternal notch using dissecting scissors. Perform a sternectomy by cutting the ribs on each side lateral to the sternum until optimal access to the heart is achieved.\nHeparinize the rat with a 100 U/100 g of injection into the left atrium.\nSacrifice the donor via exsanguination.\nExcise the thymus to improve the visualization of the great vessels. Then, remove the heart en bloc with the ascending aorta until the level of the innominate artery.\n4. Preparation of aortic valve leaflets\nPlace the donor heart in a sterile Petri dish immediately following the cardiectomy. Dissect the donor heart in an ice-cold cold storage buffer (see Table of Materials).\nUsing forceps and Vannas spring scissors, dissect the donor heart until only the aortic root remains with a 1 mm ventricular cuff proximal to the aortic valve.\nOpen the aortic valve by making a longitudinal cut to open the Sinus of Valsalva between the left and non-coronary sinuses to visualize all three leaflets.\n\tNOTE: The cut should be the entire length of the Sinus of Valsalva. The actual dimensions depend on the size of the rat.\nExcise each aortic valve leaflet individually. Specifically, use blunt forceps to grasp the edge of the leaflet and use Vannas spring scissors to excise the leaflet by cutting from one commissure down to the annulus, and then toward the next commissure.\n\tNOTE: Take special care to only grasp the edge of the leaflet to minimize disruption of the valvular endothelial cells.\nStore the samples following leaflet excision in ice-cold storage buffer solution until they are ready to be implanted in the recipient rat. Implant all the leaflets within 4 h of cold storage.\n5. Recipient operation",
    "Prepare and anesthetize the rat as stated in step 2. Use a heating pad maintained at 36-38 °C to perform the surgery.\nAdminister buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg subcutaneously) to all recipient rats before surgery and every 6-12 h post-operatively as needed to alleviate the pain.\nPlace the rat in a right lateral recumbent position to access the left kidney.\n\tNOTE: The left kidney is preferred due to its more caudal position relative to the right kidney.\nIncise the skin over the flank longitudinally over 1-inch using scissors.\n\tNOTE: The incision must remain smaller than the size of the kidney to provide enough tension to prevent the kidney from retracting back into the abdominal cavity during the procedure.\nSimilarly, incise the underlying abdominal wall.\nExternalize the kidney\n\t\nUsing the thumb and forefinger, apply light pressure dorsally and ventrally while using curved forceps to lift the caudal pole of the kidney through the abdominal and skin incision. Externalize the cranial end of the kidney similarly.\nAlternatively, the kidney may be externalized by grasping the perirenal fat and pulling upward with light tension.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care not to grasp the kidney or the renal vessels directly.\nOnce the kidney is externalized, keep it moist with warm saline trickled onto the kidney.\nCreate a subcapsular pocket.\n\t\nLightly apply pressure to the renal capsule using one set of blunt forceps so that the renal capsule can be clearly distinguished from the underlying parenchyma. Simultaneously using another set of blunt forceps, carefully grasp the capsule and gently pull upward to create a hole in the capsule.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the delicate nature of the capsule, minimal force is required to establish this incision.\nContinue using blunt forceps to extend the incision until a ~2mm space has been created to accommodate the aortic valve leaflet.",
    "Develop a shallow subcapsular pocket that is slightly larger than the valve leaflet while lifting the edge of the incision with one set of forceps and advancing a blunt probe under the renal capsule.\nTransplant the aortic valve into the subcapsular pocket.\n\t\nRetrieve the aortic leaflet from cold storage and place it in the surgical field.\nWhile lifting the edge fibrous capsule, advance the aortic leaflet into the subcapsular pocket with blunt forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the tissue is far enough away from the incision so that it is firmly secured under the capsule. Care should be taken to avoid damage to the underlying parenchyma or further ripping of the fibrous capsule.\nThe incision in the renal capsule can be left open.\nPush the kidney gently back to its anatomical position using counter traction applied to the incision edges.\nClose the abdominal incision with a running sterile surgical suture. Close the skin with staples.\nPost-operative care\n\t\nFollowing the operation, place the rat in a clean cage on a heating pad with access to food and water.\nMonitor the animal daily to assess for routine wound healing and signs of pain or distress. Remove the staples after 7-10 days.\n6. Collection of tissue for analysis\nAt selected endpoints after transplantation, euthanize the animal by exsanguination. Specifically, perform a median laparotomy and transect the abdominal aorta under 5% isoflurane in oxygen.\nMobilize the kidney and excise it by cutting the renal artery, vein, and ureter with scissors.\n\tNOTE: Take care not to grasp the area containing the transplanted leaflet.\nPlace the kidney in formalin overnight, embed it in paraffin, and section it for the desired staining. Orient the specimen with the kidney capsule facing anteriorly and the kidney parenchyma facing posteriorly.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
