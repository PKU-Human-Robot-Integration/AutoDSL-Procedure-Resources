    "The splint is used downstream for the circularization reaction, but it is easiest to generate it ahead of time as it can be stored long term. The original design of the splint includes the use of a unique molecular identifier (UMI), which is not necessary for this experiment. However, it does increase potential uses for the construct, such as allowing for deduplication of reads as described in the original R2C2 protocol (Volden et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-bib-0017]).The original R2C2 methodology sequenced concatemerized full-length cDNA using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) technology, and the inclusion of the UMI in the splint allows for deduplication when sequencing a full concatemer with their existing pipeline. At the end of this reaction you should have full-length primers with the initial primer sequences removed via the Select-a-Size kit.\nMaterials\nQ5 High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (NEB cat. no.

Using the Zymo Select-a-Size DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit add 85 µl EtOH to 500 µl DNA Binding Buffer and mix via pipetting.",
    "The amount of EtOH relative to the binding buffer is specific to the size of the fragment you want to purify. If you modify the size of the linker then the ethanol needs to be adjusted as well. Please refer to Zymo Select-a-Size DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit protocol (https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4080_select-a-size_dna_clean_concentrator.pdf[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4080_select-a-size_dna_clean_concentrator.pdf]) for instructions on how to adjust EtOH concentration for varying linker sizes.\n4. Bring the PCR reaction up to 100 µl with DNA elution buffer.\n5. Add the sample to the DNA binding buffer and mix thoroughly by pipetting.\n6. Transfer the mixture to a Zymo-Spin IC-S column in a collection tube. Centrifuge 30 s at 10,000 × g, room temperature, and discard the flow-through.\n7. Add 700 µl DNA wash buffer to the column and centrifuge 30 s at 10,000 × g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\n8. Add 200 µl DNA wash buffer to the column and centrifuge 60 s at 10,000 × g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube.\nIf you get any ethanol on the column or suspect any potential contamination, re-spin the column in the collection tube for 30 s at 10,000 × g, room temperature.\n9. Transfer the column to an Eppendorf tube, add 10 µl DNA elution buffer directly to the column matrix and incubate for 1 minute at room temperature. Centrifuge 30 s at 10,000 × g, room temperature, to elute the DNA.\nBe sure not to disturb the column matrix when pipetting the elution buffer.\n10. Measure the final DNA concentration to ensure reaction success.",
    "If the reaction failed, you will observe a very low concentration of DNA. In our experience, successful reactions usually contained between 900 and 1100 ng of DNA, while failed reactions contained between 90 and 130 ng of DNA. We recommend using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) to measure total DNA to allow for better control of total splint added downstream.",
    "The goal of this step is to extract full-length RNA transcripts with as little breakage and degradation as possible. Although most RNA extraction methods will likely work for this protocol, we opted to use a commercial column extraction kit for several reasons. Primarily, we were concerned with obtaining intact full-length mRNA, as any breaks would appear as an artifact TSS within the gene body. To help facilitate the isolation of intact full-length mRNA, we used a rapid protocol that reduced the time in between RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. In addition, the on-column DNase I digestion allowed for easy degradation of genomic DNA, which causes artifacts when the poly-dT primer binds with natural poly-A tracts in genomic DNA. Finally, the TSRT requires very low RNA input levels and will fail if too much RNA is added to the reaction, so column purification provides more than enough RNA. While we do not know the exact RNA level that will stop working, we suggest not using over 400 ng of total input.",
    "Be sure that all reagents and materials used for RNA extraction are RNase-free. The easiest way to do this is to use dedicated reagents and disposable materials for all RNA protocols that are known to be RNase-free upon purchase, and keep those materials sealed when not in use to avoid contamination. It is advisable to use dedicated filter tips for all pipetting, and to thoroughly clean the workstation to remove RNase contamination. It is advisable to immediately continue on to cDNA generation after RNA extraction to avoid degradation, but we have generated high-quality libraries with RNA stored for up to one month at −80°C. This section mostly follows the “Tough-to-Lyse” protocol provided by Monarch with minor specifications, additions, and commentary as we extracted RNA from plant tissue frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground in a mortar and pestle. Be sure to perform all initial preparatory steps outlined in the kit instructions. Very little tissue is required for this protocol, with successful libraries having been generated with as little as 40 pg of total RNA input.\nMaterials\nRNaseZap (Thermo Fisher cat. no. AM9780)\nLiquid nitrogen\nPlant sample\nMonarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (NEB cat. no. T2010S)\nQubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher cat. no.

Clean all surfaces and the mortar and pestle with RNaseZAP or another RNase decontamination solution.\nAvoiding RNase contamination with the sample is key to a successful experiment, be sure to decontaminate the workspace, gloves, and any tools that will contact the lysed sample with an RNase decontamination solution. As this protocol is designed to initially generate full-length cDNA, breaks in RNA may lead to artifacts in the final experiment.",
    "2. Pre-cool a mortar and pestle using liquid nitrogen. Place the plant sample into the mortar and slowly add liquid nitrogen. Grind the tissue into a fine powder for 3 min, adding more liquid nitrogen if necessary.\nOther methods of lysing the sample, such as a bead mill, will likely be successful as well. Ensuring that the sample remains as RNase-free as possible will increase the success of the reaction.\n3. Add the ground sample to 800 µl 1× DNA/RNA protection reagent pre-cooled in an Eppendorf tube on ice and vortex to mix thoroughly.\nKeeping the sample cool from this point onward will improve RNA stability, decreasing potential artifacts and increasing experimental success. Variable amounts of total tissue input can be used, but it is advisable to keep your total tissue below 100 mg. Regardless of the total amount of tissue used, 800 µl of 1× DNA/RNA protection reagent can be used.\n4. Spin 2 min at 16,000 × g, room temperature, to pellet debris. Transfer supernatant to a pre-cooled gDNA removal column (light blue) fitted with a collection tube.\nThere is no reason to try and optimize the total RNA extracted from the sample in most cases, as smar2C2 libraries can be prepared with as little as 40 pg of total RNA. Be sure to not pipette any precipitate, as it is fine to leave a large amount of supernatant behind. 400 µl is sufficient for downstream applications, as after the addition of an equal volume of ethanol only 800 µl will be able to be added to the next column.\n5. Spin 30 s at 16,000 × g, room temperature, to remove the genomic DNA.\nBe sure to save the flow-through in the collection tube, discarding the gDNA removal column.",
    "6. Add an equal volume of EtOH and mix thoroughly by pipetting (do not vortex).\n7. Transfer the mixture to a pre-cooled RNA purification column (dark blue) and collection tube. Spin 30 s at 16,000 × g, room temperature, and discard the flow-through.\n8. Add 500 µl of RNA wash buffer and spin 30 s at 16,000 × \ng, room temperature, and discard flow-through.\n9. Combine 5 µl DNase I with 75 µl DNase I reaction buffer and pipet directly to the top of the column matrix. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nWhile the on-column DNase I digestion step is optional, we highly recommend performing this step. Even while performing a DNase I digestion we are able to occasionally see artifacts presumably from the poly-dT primer binding to poly-A tracts in the genomic DNA.\n10. Add 500 µl RNA priming buffer and spin 30 s at 16,000 × g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\n11. Add 500 µl RNA wash buffer and spin for 30 s at 16,000 × g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\n12. Add 500 µl RNA wash buffer and spin for 2 min at 16,000 × g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.\n13. Spin the column for 1 min at 16,000 × g, room temperature.\nWhile this step is optional, it is likely wise to ensure no ethanol contamination in the final elution\n14. Add 50 µl nuclease-free water directly to the center of the column matrix and spin for 30 s at 16,000 × g, room temperature.\nThis volume can be adjusted anywhere between 30 and 100 µl\n15. Place the eluted RNA on ice.\nWhen dealing with RNA one of the best ways of improving experimental success is keeping your sample cool.",
    "16. Measure total RNA extracted using Qubit RNA Broad Range Assay Kit.\nA nanodrop or other similar RNA quantification test will likely provide enough accuracy for this application. We have found that the addition of too much RNA into the reverse transcription reaction can inhibit experimental success, making moderately accurate knowledge of input important. It is advisable to proceed directly to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-prot-0003], but if necessary RNA samples can be frozen at −20°C for use the next day or −80°C for more long term storage.",
    "The goal of this step is to generate the cDNA using the TSRT and then attach the TSO containing the adaptor to the additional C's deposited at the end of the first-strand cDNA transcript. TSRTs can introduce an error called strand invasion (Tang et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-bib-0015]) where the TSO binds with the first strand of cDNA before the reverse transcriptase has completed first-strand synthesis, usually at a site with sequence complementarity to the oligo. These artifacts can be removed bioinformatically, but methods should also be adjusted to attempt to reduce potential problems. We have opted to add a step where the poly-dT primer is annealed to the mRNA before the TSO is added. Continue to use RNase-free reagents and materials until after first-strand cDNA synthesis using the TSRT.\nMaterials\nSMARTScribe reverse transcriptase (Takara Bio cat. no. 639538)\n5× first-strand buffer (Takara Bio cat. no. 639538)\n20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Takara Bio cat. no. 639538)\nTSO (100 µM) (see oligonucleotides list in recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-rec-0002])\nISPCR primer (10 µM) (see oligonucleotides list in recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-rec-0002])\nPoly-dT primer (10 µM) (see oligonucleotides list in recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.705#cpz1705-rec-0002])\nDeoxynucleotide (dNTP) solution mix (10 µM) (NEB cat. no.

The 10 min spent at 65°C is to allow for second-strand cDNA synthesis. The PCR amplification following should be done a minimal number of times. If duplicates become a problem downstream, four cycles of PCR are likely sufficient, though the effects of this have not been tested.\n7. Purify using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit with a 5:1 mixture of DNA binding buffer. Elute using 8 µl elution buffer.\nAny PCR cleanup commonly used is likely sufficient. Eluting into 8 µl allows for easy input into subsequent circularization reactions and conservation of circularization reagents but is not critical to the protocol. It is possible to pause after this step and store cDNA at 4°C for use in the near future or −20°C for more long-term storage.",
    "The goal of this step is to generate circular DNA from the cDNA fragments and amplify them into linear concatemers using rolling circle amplification. The phi29 polymerase used in this protocol is a high-fidelity DNA polymerase that is extremely processive and well suited to rolling circle amplification. Circularization and rolling circle amplification is what allows this protocol to generate fragments of DNA that contain the TSS. It contains the added benefit that once a fragment of DNA is circularized, any linear DNA is digested away using effective, inexpensive, and stable exonucleases. A wide variety of exonucleases that are specific to linear DNA ensure complete digestion of all non-circularized DNA, with exonuclease I showing preference for linear single strand DNA, exonuclease III showing preference for linear double stranded DNA, and lambda exonuclease showing preference for nicked and 5′-phosphorylated double-stranded linear DNA post digestion, thus the library should only contain circular sequences generated using the sequence similarity present on the adaptors on the cDNA and the previously generated splint.\nMaterials\nNEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB cat. no.

    "200 ng splint (from the previous step)\n10 µl 2× NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix\n8 µl sample\nAdd water to 20 µl\nNEBuilder is very effective at generating circular fragments using the cDNA and splint, but other methods of circularization via splint ligation are likely sufficient as well. If your sample is in more than 8 µl due to your cleanup step, increase the total volume of the reaction to up to 42.5 µl by adding equal amounts of NEBuilder.\n2.

Incubate the reaction at 37°C for 60 min, 80°C for 20 min, and then cool to 4°C or place on ice.\nThe 60 min at 37°C can be extended to up to six hours depending on the needs of the experimenter, though most digestion should be done in the first hour. Heating to 80°C for 20 min is to inactivate the nucleases to ensure no activity once linear DNA is generated via rolling circle amplification.\n5. Purify using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit with a 5:1 mixture of DNA binding buffer.

    "The total time spent at 30°C can be adjusted significantly, and we have tested it for up to 16 hr (overnight). We have found that 4 hr have produced sufficient linear DNA for our needs, but if the yield is too low the reaction can be left running overnight.\n8. Purify using Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit with a 5:1 mixture of DNA binding buffer. Elute using 18 µl elution buffer.\nWhile any DNA PCR cleanup method is likely sufficient for this step, we have encountered problems when using magnetic beads. Our beads tended to not stick well to the side of the tube when placed on the magnetic rack, forming a looser clump that protruded away from the side of the tube. This made it difficult to remove the reaction buffer and ethanol used in the cleanup and resulted in a significant loss of the sample.",
    "At this stage, long linear fragments of DNA need to be broken down into short fragments that can be sequenced, and sequencing adaptors need to be attached. Any protocol that is commonly used to sequence genomic DNA on Illumina sequencers will likely work at this stage.
