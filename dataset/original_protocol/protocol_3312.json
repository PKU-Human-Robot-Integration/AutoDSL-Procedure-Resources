    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe timeline outlined in this protocol for the various steps is dependent on the area of the FTW. However, the timeline provided here is an approximate a week for an FTW area approximately 1000 m2.\nPart 1: Setting up a plant nursery\nTiming: ∼3–4 months\nThe establishment of a nursery is pivotal for ensuring a consistent supply of macrophytes that have undergone optimal growth. By providing a controlled environment, the nursery encourages robust root development, shields juvenile plants from potential predators, and promotes the cultivation of particularly efficacious species. Moreover, the nursery is a cost-effective approach due to bulk cultivation and acts as an experimental platform for trialing new plant species or cultivation techniques.\nIt is essential to have wetland plants nurturing in a nursery under optimal conditions and preparing them for placement in the FTWs (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C). This requires cultivation of plants in specialized containers such as plastic pots equipped with drainage holes at the base. These plants undergo a growth period of approximately two months. To achieve this, obtain the initial propagules which include seedlings, rhizomes, and cuttings, from locales exposed to wastewater, such as drains and ponds, as well as from established nurseries. Then, use the pots manifesting optimal plant growth for the assembly of floating wetlands. Conversely, rejuvenate the pots that do not exhibit satisfactory growth by introducing fresh seedlings, cuttings, and rhizomes. Within this cultivation framework, the rhizomes are integrated into the pots.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3079-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Note: This ensures the plants are not shocked by sudden changes in conditions when they are moved from the nursery to the wetlands.\nBefore being utilized to create the floating wetlands, the plants are acclimated under the site’s ambient conditions for two to three days.\nPrior to their transfer into the water body, they receive adequate watering.\nOptimal Growth Environment\nFor optimal growth, maintain the plants in an environment with at least 2.54 cm of water.\nNote: This simulates the wetland conditions they will eventually live in, allowing them to adapt and grow appropriately. This step is crucial in preparing the plants for their eventual transfer into the FTWs.\nCritical: The soil within the pots, which support the wetland plants, should remain intact, undisturbed, and must be moved as-is onto the raft in subsequent stages (Part 2). Also, grow plants in conditions with at least 2.54 cm of water present in the plots or field (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The pot, designed with a hole at the bottom, contains coconut shavings placed above the hole. This aids in preventing soil loss during watering in the nursery and when transitioning the vegetated mat to water. To protect the mats from sunlight radiation and heat, they are layered with soil and gravel. Furthermore, their edges are shielded with aluminum foil.\nPart 2: Establishing FTW units\nTiming: ∼16 h\nThe section guides the establishment of individual unit rafts, detailing materials sourcing, crafting, weatherproofing, and precision drilling. These unit rafts are crucial components, as they eventually combine to form a full-scale FTW. By sourcing quality materials, ensuring accurate dimensions, and incorporating protective measures, the process aims to achieve durable and efficient FTWs for water treatment.\nThese steps provide a guide for creating individual unit rafts. These unit rafts are then assembled to form a full-scale FTW.",
    "Procuring Polyethylene Insulation Sheets\nPurchase polyethylene-based roof insulation roll sheets from a local company.\nNote: In this study, we sourced the insulation sheets from Symbol Industries Pvt. Limited, Lahore, Pakistan.\nCrafting Individual Raft Units.\nCut the roll to produce individual raft units with dimensions 1.8 m in length, 1.2 m in width, and 3.04 cm in thickness (schematic shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) with a sharp and heated iron blade.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3079-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Building FTWs: Schematic and installation process\nConstructing the Building Blocks of FTWs: schematic representation of the unit raft (A), drilling holes for pot installation (B), and creating small holes with PVC pipe protection for effective anchoring (C and D).\nWeatherproofing Raft Units.\nCover the boundaries of the rafts with aluminum foil to provide protection against natural weathering (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nFix the aluminum foil with the help of polychloroprene.\nPrecision Hole Drilling in Each Raft Unit.\nCreate fourteen holes in each raft unit. Each hole should have a diameter of approximately 12.5 cm at upper side and 10.16 at lower (bottom) side.\nNote: While a heated iron structure was used in our study, other suitable technologies or methods may also be employed to achieve similar results (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCreate a hole at each corner of the raft to facilitate the connection of the raft with each other (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nInsert a PVC pipe into each hole (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E) which serves as a protective layer when using metal wire to connect the rafts together.\nCritical: Without the PVC pipe, the wire could potentially damage the raft and compromise the connection between the rafts.\nPart 3: Vegetating individual FTWs\nTiming: ∼8 h",
    "The section outlines the methodology to prepare and establish vegetated rafts for FTW. By detailing pot preparation, vegetation processes, and soil shielding techniques, the primary goal is to ensure the rafts sustainably support plant growth and remain resilient against environmental elements once deployed into the water body.\nThese steps detail the process of setting up individual FTW units. Once these steps are completed, the vegetated rafts are ready to be manually moved and installed into the water body.\nPots Preparation.\nUse plastic (PVC) pots for the vegetation of plants/seedlings.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3079-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Building FTWs: Schematic and installation process\nProcess of vegetating floating rafts: PVC pots (A), drilling holes in the pots (B, C), adding coconut shavings (D), introducing plants and stabilizing with soil (E, F), transferring vegetated pots into raft units (G), and shielding raft units with soil and gravel (H‒K).\nNote: Keep pot dimensions similar to the holes, i.e., 12.7 cm in height in height, with an upper side diameter of 12.7 cm and a lower side diameter of 10.16 cm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCreating Holes in PVC Pots for Plant Growth.\nMake holes in the plastic pots using the same method (Step 7) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nAdding Plants/Seedlings to Prepared Pots.\nPlace coconut shavings in the plastic pots to cover the holes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: This helps prevent soil from falling out of the pots during the initial stages of plant vegetation.\nPlace plants into the pot with coconut shavings (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nAdd soil to the pot to secure the plant in place (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nIntroducing Plant Pots into the Raft Units.\nPlace plant pots containing plants seedlings into the holes of each unit raft (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).",
    "Note: The seedlings are already grown in plastic pots that are 12.7 cm in length, with a 12.7 cm diameter at the upper side, a 10.2 cm diameter at the lower side, and a 5 cm diameter hole at the bottom.\nShielding with Soil and Fortifying with Gravel.\nAdd soil to the raft up to a height of 2.54 cm, which matches the border height (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H and 3I).\nNote: It is preferable to use loamy texture soil to shield the raft from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.\nCover the soil layer with gravel (pebbles: 4–64 mm) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J).\nNote: This will prevent it from being washed or blown away by rain and wind.\nCritical: It is imperative to ensure the thorough coverage and compaction of the loamy soil on the rafts to prevent the displacement or erosion caused by rain or high tide events.\nReady for the Plunge.\nMove the vegetated rafts to the water body (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nPart 4: Building the FTW island\nTiming: ∼24 h\nThe section presents strategies to reinforce and anchor FTWs in a water body. The central objective is to ensure the structural cohesiveness, stability, and positioning of the FTWs. This results in enhanced effectiveness and longevity of the system in treating water, even under varying environmental conditions.\nThis objective aims to establish and maintain the structural integrity of the FTWs, prevent raft separation, and securely position the FTWs in the designated area of the pond, contributing to their effectiveness and longevity in treating water.\nBinding for Stability.\nSecure and bound the rafts together using a metal wire.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3079-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Building FTWs: Schematic and installation process",
    "Assembly line of FTW system: raft connections (A‒C), bamboo integration (D), holes creation in bamboos (E), bamboo fixation (F, G), raft-bamboo fusion (H‒J), and anchoring (K, L, M).\nFor a Figure360 author presentation of this figure, see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2023.102671[href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2023.102671].\nCritical: It is important to use a minimum of six-foot length of wire for one joint. The wire can be of iron or copper and ideally encased in a plastic cover, providing protection and safety (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A‒4C).\nUtilizing Bamboo to Reinforce the Periphery of the FTW Island Structure.\nUse solid and strong bamboos at the periphery of the final FTW island structure to effectively hold the units together (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). To achieve this, drill the holes into the bamboo sections (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E), and then connect the bamboos using nut bolts and washers (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nNote: This method ensures a secure and sturdy connection between the bamboo elements, contributing to the structural integrity of the FTW island (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G).\nSecurely fix the rafts with the bamboos ensuring a cohesive unit (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H and 4I).\nNote: This prevents any individual raft from becoming separated from the group, maintaining the overall integrity of the structure (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J).\nCritical: Ideally, when drilling holes in bamboo, it is advisable to position them at the junction points to ensure a robust and durable connection. This strategic placement enhances the strength and integrity of the connection between bamboo components.\nAnchoring.\nUse concrete anchors weighing ∼60 kg or more to secure unit rafts in a water body (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K and 4L). Place each anchor at one corner of the floating bed to provide stability and anchorage to the entire structure (Figure M).",
    "Note: This arrangement ensures that the rafts remain firmly in place, even in varying water conditions, contributing to the effectiveness and longevity of the floating wetlands system. Further, bamboos firmly hold the anchors in place, enhancing the stability of the rafts in their aquatic environment.\nCritical: To maintain stability of the system and enable the rafts to remain buoyant even during extreme rain events, it is crucial to set the length of the metal wire to accommodate the maximum water height based on historical data. This ensures that the anchors remain secure, and the rafts can effectively float without any compromise in functionality.\nTo secure the FTW system at a specific location in the water body, shift the anchors to the midpoint of the pond. Add four anchors, one at each corner of the floating wetlands island, to firmly fix the island at the desired position within the pond (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]N).\nNote: This relocation and placement of the anchors ensure that the floating wetlands remain securely positioned, maintaining their stability and effectiveness within the designated area of the pond (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]O).\nNotes: FTW can be assembled at the base of a drained lagoon. Upon filling the lagoon with water, the structure will naturally rise and float, replicating the procedure demonstrated in the video protocol."
