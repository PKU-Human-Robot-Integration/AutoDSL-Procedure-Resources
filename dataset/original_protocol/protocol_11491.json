    "1. TTFields In Vitro Application System — Base Plate and Dish Maintenance\nRinse dishes and dish covers under running tap water. Then rinse with deionized water and air-dry face down.\nIf a chemotherapeutic agent/drug has been added to dishes in a prior experiment, fill each dish with a 5% light detergent solution and leave overnight.\n\t\nRinse the dishes thoroughly under running tap water to avoid any traces of detergent inside the dish. Rinse the dishes and dish covers with deionized water and air-dry face down.\nInsert the clean and dry dishes with their covers into sterilization bags. Seal and place the bags in an autoclave, with the dishes face down. Autoclave for 30 min at no higher than 121 °C.\nSet the autoclave on a dry program, partly open the autoclave door, and dry the dishes for 30 min.\nWipe the base plate with a cloth lightly moistened with 70% ethanol.\n2. Experiment Setup\nNOTE: All equipment and materials used in this protocol are described in the Materials List. All steps below should be performed inside a laminar flow cabinet while sterile conditions are maintained.\nPrepare clean and sterile TTFields dishes and covers, as described in section 1. Wipe the base plate with a cloth lightly moistened with 70% ethanol.\nInstall the TTFields dishes with the covers onto the base plate by pressing down gently on the dish and rotating clockwise by about 5 mm until the rim of the dish locks onto the three pins on the base plate. Place a sterile 22-mm coverslip (treated plastic or glass) on the bottom of each dish.\nPrepare the cell suspension in complete growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for U-87 MG and F98; RPMI for A2780 and OVCAR-3; supplemented as described in Materials List).",
    "NOTE: The cell concentrations depend on the cell types and experiment duration, 80%-90% confluent cell growth should not be exceeded by the end of the experiment.\nCAUTION: Human cell lines may represent a biological hazard and should be handled with the appropriate safety measures.\nPlace 200 µL of cell suspension (usually 5,000-20,000 cells in 200 µL for a 72-h experiment, depending on the doubling time) as a drop in the center of each coverslip and cover with the dish lids.\nIncubate at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator until the cells adhere; an overnight incubation is possible at this stage.\nAspirate the fluids from the drop using a 200- or 1,000-µL pipette.\nGently pipette 2 mL of complete growth medium to fill each dish. Use a sterile tip to pipette and softly tap on the coverslip edges to release the air bubbles occasionally caught under the slide.\nCover the dishes with their lids and place them inside a CO2 incubator at 37 °C until the start of the TTFields treatment.\n3. TTFields Application\nTransfer the base plates with the attached TTFields dishes to a refrigerated CO2 incubator.\nNOTE: In vitro TTFields application will generate heat; therefore, a refrigerated incubator is required to compensate for the warming of the dishes. Higher TTFields intensities will produce more heat and will require lower incubator ambient temperatures (see Table 1). Clinically relevant TTFields intensities are achieved when the incubator temperature for TTFields application is in the range of 18-30 °C.\nConnect the flat cable female connector to the base plate. Switch the TTFields generator on.\nStart the TTFields in vitro application system software and select the experiment settings.",
    "Define a new experiment. Type the name of the experiment and the experiment owner in the software user interface on the computer screen. Adjust the frequency and target temperature for each dish or base plate.\nStart the TTFields application using the software.\nVerify that all dishes are connected properly and appear light blue on the monitor. If a dish is circled with a red frame (meaning that it is not properly connected), press it down gently and rotate slowly back and forth until the contacts are restored and the dish appears light blue.\nLeave the TTFields in vitro application system running for up to 24 h.\nIf the experiment reaches its endpoint, stop the experiment by clicking on the END EXPERIMENT button in the software and proceed to step 5. If not, click on PAUSE experiment.\nDisconnect the flat cable connector from the base plate. Remove the base plate with the dishes from the incubator into a laminar flow cabinet.\nReplace the medium in all dishes every 24 h and return the base plate to the refrigerated incubator. Connect the base plate to the generator using the flat cable. Continue the experiment by clicking on the CONTINUE button.\n4. Control Samples\nNote: Grow control cells in similar conditions to TTFields-treated cells, excluding TTFields application.\nPlate control samples with the same suspension and on a similar surface used for plating TTFields-treated samples.\nPlace control dishes in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nReplace the medium in the dishes every 24 h to match the TTFields-treated dish medium conditions.\n5. Experiment End\nAfter clicking on END EXPERIMENT, wait for the software to retrieve all records from the system and to save the records to the computer.",
    "Use the REPORTS button to review the temperature, current, and resistance log files of each base plate to verify that all dishes were treated according to the experimental plan.\nNOTE: All reports and logs are saved to the computer after the end of the experiment and can be reviewed at any time.\nSwitch off the TTFields generator.\nDisconnect the flat cable from the base plate and remove from the incubator.\nTo remove a ceramic dish, press down and turn the dish counterclockwise to unlock it from the base plate.\nTake the dishes into a laminar flow cabinet and aseptically remove the coverslips. Transfer them to sterile Petri dishes containing fresh medium or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for further inspection and evaluation.\n6. Evaluation of the Effect of TTFields\nNOTE: TTFields' effects can be determined in several ways. Use one or more of the following methods to compare treated cells to untreated control cells:\nCell count\n\t\nRemove the medium/PBS from each coverslip-containing dish.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA to each dish and incubate for up to 10 min (i.e., until the cells start to detach from the coverslip surface) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.\nAdd 0.5 mL of the complete growth medium to neutralize the trypsin and re-suspend the cells by gently pipetting up and down.\nCount the cells using any standard cell counting technique that is compatible with counting low cell concentrations (i.e., around 20,000 cells/mL).\nClonogenic assay\n\t\nPlate a similar number of cells (100-500 cells per dish) from each dish onto new, sterile Petri dishes or 6-well plates containing 2 mL of fresh complete growth medium.",
    "Incubate in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1-3 weeks (depending on the properties of each cell line) until colonies comprised of ~50 cells are formed. Evaluate the cell number per colony by light microscopy.\nRemove the medium and rinse with PBS.\nRemove the PBS and add ice-cold methanol (1 mL). Incubate at -20 °C for 10 min or longer.\nRemove the methanol.\nAdd crystal violet solution (0.1% w/v in 25% v/v methanol in water) and incubate for 20 min.\nCAUTION: Crystal violet is a potential carcinogen; use gloves while working with crystal violet.\nRemove the crystal violet, wash 3 times with deionized water, and air-dry.\nCount the colonies formed in each dish."
