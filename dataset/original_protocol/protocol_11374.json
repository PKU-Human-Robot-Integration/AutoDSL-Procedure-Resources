    "All the protocols and amendment(s) or procedures involving the care and use of animals will be reviewed and approved by the Crown Bioscience Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) prior to the conduct of studies. The care and use of animals will usually be conducted in accordance with AAALAC (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) International guidelines as reported in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council (2011). All animal experimental procedures will be under sterile conditions at SPF (specific pathogen-free) facilities and conducted in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from different government institutions (e.g. The National Institutes of Health). The protocol will need to be approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments at the facility institution (e.g. institutional IACUC Committee).\n1. Preparation for Tumor Transplantation\nAnimal Housing\nObtain generic C57BL/6 mice from a commercial breeding vendor.\nHouse mice (5) in individual ventilated cages at the following conditions: Temperature: 20–26 °C; humidity 30–70%; lighting cycle: 12 h light and 12 h dark.\nUse corn cob bedding that is changed weekly.\nFor diet, provide irradiation sterilized dry granule food during the entire study period.\nFor water, provide animals free access to sterile drinking water.\nDonor tumor fragment preparation\nBegin by monitoring body weight (BW), via weighing using a balance, and tumor volume (TV), by caliper measurement, of tumor-bearing donor mice.\nWhen TV reaches 500–1,200 mm3, euthanize the animal in a biohazard hood as per protocol.\nSterilize the skin around the tumor using iodophor swabs.",
    "Surgically remove the tumor (details described in section 3: Necropsy and tumor harvest) and place the tumor in a Petri dish containing 20 mL of PBS (pre-chill the media or buffer to 4 °C prior to euthanizing animals).\nIf there is contaminating blood, transfer the tumor into another Petri dish and wash the tumor with PBS.\nCut the tumor in half, removing any extra skin, vessels, calcification and/or necrosis.\nChoose only intact pieces of tumor and place them into a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube and add 20 mL of PBS then transport the tube to a separate animal room for pharmacology studies.\n2. Orthotopic and Subcutaneous (SC) Engraftment\nSC Inoculation\nCut tumors into 2 mm diameter pieces using a scalpel, putting 1 chunk into each trocar, for SC implantation or for later orthotopic implantation (see below).\nAnesthetize the recipient animal with 5% isoflurane, which is maintained by a nose cone at 1%. The animal will begin to relax, losing their righting reflex and eventually become immobile. At this depth of anesthesia they can easily be roused by painful stimuli; allow anesthesia to deepen until such responses to pain are absent.\nOnce anesthetized, fix the mice on an experiment board in the right lateral position. Sterilize the mouse using iodophor swabs, particularly the areas surrounding the tumors.\nWith a scalpel, make a 0.5 to 1.0 cm skin incision on the left flank, just cranial to the hip.\nTunnel under the skin towards the forelimb, two to three centimeters, with blunt forceps.\nAseptically transfer one cube of tumor from the medium and place deep inside the subcutaneous tunnel.\nVisually confirm that the tumor is deep in the tunnel (and not at the skin incision).\nClose the wound with wound clips.",
    "Monitor the animals post inoculation until they regain sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbence. Return animals back to their cage only after their full recovery from anesthesia. Complete the Anesthesia Log, and initiate the Animal Health Chart. Weigh recipient animals daily for three days\nFor a standard procedure, inoculate 5-10 mice per group for tumor growth monitoring.\nPancreatic orthotopic implantation\nAnesthesia and Analgesia\n\t\t\nUse a 2 mL ketamine injection and 0.42 mL xylazine injection (20 mg/mL) mixed in 5.91 sterile injection water or saline at a dose volume of 0.06–0.1 mL/20-25 g body weight.\n\t\t\tNOTE: According to animal welfare, analgesia is necessary both pre and post operation. 0.05–0.1 mg buprenorphine /kg, SC. The first dose is pre operation and then dosed 3 times every 4 hours post operation continually.\nSurgical operation for orthotopic implantation\n\t\t\nAnesthetize mice via intramuscular injection (IM) per Step 2.2.1.\nAfter the animals are fully anesthetized, fix the mice on an experiment board in the right lateral position.\nKeep the mice in the right lateral position. Disinfect the skin around the spleen with iodine then de-iodinate with 75% ethyl alcohol.\nFind the medium point of the spleen and make a 1 cm vertical incision on abdomen to expose the spleen.\nDraw out a part of pancreas tissue under the spleen gently with flat-tip tweezers, and suture a mouse homograft tumor piece from seed mouse on the pancreas of recipient mouse by 9-0 Absorbable surgical suture.\nClose the abdomen with a 6-0 silk suture by double seam. Achieve homeostasis by compression.\nAfter finishing tumor implantation, if neither bleeding nor tumor tissue leakage occurs, keep the animals in a warm cage.",
    "Monitor the animal until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency; return the animal to the animal room after full recovery from the anesthesia. Monitor the tumor bearing mice by palpating the abdomen near the spleen and select out the mice bearing orthotopic tumors.\nTumor-Bearing Mice Health Monitoring\nCheck the water and food consumption daily.\nExamine the mouse appearance for an ungroomed hair coat, lumps, thinness, abnormal breath or ascites.\nPalpate the abdomen to check if there are spontaneous tumors on the liver or spleen.\nWeigh mice weekly using a balance.\nIf any of the following clinical signs are observed, the mice are sacrificed for sample collection and necropsy: BW loss >20%; impaired mobility (not able to eat or drink); unable to move normally due to significant ascites and enlarged abdomen; effort in respiration.\n3. Necropsy and Tumor Harvest\nInspect visually and by palpation for the presence of palpable tumors before termination.\nFor termination, first euthanize mice as per approved protocol, and open the abdomen and visually examine the pancreas for tumors.\nCut off the tumor by post mortal surgery and add it to cold PBS. Place all animals in a clean, uncharged, translucent euthanasia chamber with a special lid with a port for delivery of the carbon dioxide to be used.\nDischarge gas into the chamber at a flow rate that produces rapid unconsciousness with minimal distress to the animal. The optimum flow rate for CO2 should be around 2–2.5 L/min.\nVisually observe each animal during the euthanasia procedure to assure all animals receive adequate gas concentrations and do not regain consciousness during the euthanize procedure.\nMaintain gas flow for at least 1 min after apparent clinical death to minimize the possibility that an animal may recover (if apneic but not dead).",
    "Remove adjacent non-tumor tissues. Cleaned tumor can be photographed quickly.\n\tPut the tumor tissues into RPMI-1640 and keep on ice before dissociation.\n\tNOTE: Animal carcasses are bagged and stored in the appropriate freezer to await removal.\n4. Tumor Tissue Dissociation and Single Cell Preparation\nReagent preparation\n\tNOTE: The Tumor Dissociation Kit contains 2 vials of Enzyme D (lyophilized powder), 1 vial of Enzyme R (lyophilized powder), 1 vial of Enzyme A (lyophilized powder) and 1 mL of Buffer A.\n\t\nPrepare Enzyme D by reconstituting the lyophilized powder in each vial with 3 mL of RPMI-1640. Prepare aliquots of an appropriate volume to avoid repeated freeze-thaw-cycles.\nPrepare Enzyme R by reconstituting the lyophilized powder in the vial with 2.7 mL of RPMI 1640. Prepare aliquots of an appropriate volume to avoid repeated freeze-thaw-cycles.\nPrepare Enzyme A by reconstituting the lyophilized powder in the vial with 1 mL of Buffer A supplied with the kit. Do not vortex. Prepare aliquots of an appropriate volume to avoid repeated free-thaw-cycles.\nPrepare the Enzyme mix by adding 2.35 mL of RPMI-1640, 100 µL of Enzyme D, 50 µL of Enzyme R and 12.5 µL of Enzyme A into each gentleMACS C-tube.\nTumor Dissociation\nFor each tumor prepare one C-tube with tumor digestion mix, please refer to section 4.1 for digestion buffer dilution and preparation.\nUse 3 mL digestion buffer for tumor fragments <0.8 g, and ensure the tumor is fully digested.\nLabel with the study code, tumor, mouse ID, treatment group, and tumor weight.\nCollect the tumor from the mouse, wash the tumor in cold PBS and clean out the tissue attached on the tumor (such as blood vessels, fat, fascia, etc.).\nPut the tumor in digestion media in one well of a sterile 6 well plate.",
    "Hold the tumor in place with sterile tweezers/forceps and slice with a scalpel. Slice the tumor well enough to break into smaller pieces (~1 mm3).\nPlace the tumor pieces back into the C-tube and use the remaining digestion buffer to wash the plate and then transfer the fluid into the C-tube that is placed on ice until digestion.\nSwitch on the dissociator with heaters.\nPlace tumor dissociation C-tubes upside down into sleeves of the vacant positions and adjust the status of tube positions from Free to Selected. Choose a dissociation program (37_c_m_TDK_1), followed by the selection of the required folder, where the list of Programs is displayed.\nAfter termination of the program, take C-tubes off the dissociator and spin briefly (300 x g, 4 °C) to pellet the sample.\nRe-suspend samples and put into a cell strainer above a 50 mL tube. Wash the cells through the cell strainer with 10 mL of wash buffer to provide a single-cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 300 x g for 5 min, discard the supernatant and re-suspend the cells with 5 mL of wash buffer, count viable cells using trypan blue and/or by cell counter and adjust the cell concentraton to 1 x 106 cells per tube or per sample. Include the correct isotype control antibodies to ensure staining is specific\n5. Immune Panel Design and Flow Data Acquisition\nPanel design\nPlease see Table 1.\nImmunostaining\nFc-Block sample cells: re-suspend the cells in 200 µL of staining buffer with 1 µg/mL Fc-Block, followed by incubation on ice or 4 °C refrigeration for 15 min in the dark.",
    "Stain cells using the desired antibody/fluorescence panels (e.g. T-cell panel, macrophage panel, etc.): Add the antibody mixture diluted in Fc blocking buffer to each sample, stain for at least 30 min on ice in the dark.\nAdd 1 mL of ice cold PBS to each tube and re-suspend the cells gently, followed by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min. Discard the resulting supernatant.\n\t\t\nRepeat to wash the cells twice.\nStain for intracellular markers if needed, following steps 6-10, otherwise jump to step 10.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet by pulse vortex and add 200 µL of prepared Fixation/Permeabilization working solution for each sample. Pulse vortex again, and then incubate at 4 °C overnight (preferred) or 30 min at room temperature in the dark.\nSpin down the cells and remove the supernatant.\nWash twice by adding 1 mL of 1x Permeabilization Buffer (made from 10x Permeabilization Buffer, diluted with distilled H2O) followed by centrifugation and decanting of supernatant.\nAdd intracellular marker antibody in 1x Permeabilization Buffer and incubate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.\nWash cells twice with 1 mL of 1x Permeabilization Buffer. Centrifuge and decant supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 150 µL of Staining Buffer and analyze on a cytometer. Due to the fixation and permeabilization procedure, the FSC (forward-light scatter)/SSC (sidelight scatter) distribution of the cell population will be different to live cells. Therefore, the gate and voltages will need to be modified.\nFMO Controls (Fluorescence Minus One Control)\n\tNOTE: Multi-color flow analysis is particularly important for the analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Therefore, there is a need to find a way to identify and gate cells in the context of data spread due to the multiple fluorochromes in a given panel. FMO (Fluorescence Minus One) Control is an important approach for this purpose.",
    "To this end, include additional mice in each group for FMO controls (at least 2 per Rx) and process individually for each tissue. After dissociation, pool tissues. For example, in a study with 4 Rx groups, 8 additional tumors should be processed individually and then pooled into one sample for FMOs.\nFlow Instrument Setup\nMake compensation beads while the machine is warming up (at least 20 min).\nUse CS&T beads to check performance.\nVoltage and compensation settings: use UltraComp beads, vortex the Comp beads thoroughly before use.\nLabel a separate 12 x 75 mm2 sample tube for each fluorochrome-conjugated antibody.\nAdd 100 µL of staining buffer to each tube. Add 1 full drop (approximately 60 µL) of the beads to each tube.\nAdd antibodies and perform the staining procedure exactly as the sample process stated in section 4.\nAdd 0.5 mL of staining buffer each, to completely re-suspend bead pellets via vortex.\nSet flow cytometer PMT voltage per target tissue for the given experiment.\nRun through flow cytometer for data acquisition, by gating on the singlet bead population per FSC and SSC readings.\nSet Flow rate around 200–300 events/s.\nSet appropriate compensation for a given fluorescein [FITC]-conjugated antibody, use an FL1 vs. FL2 dot plot.\nPlace a quadrant gate so that negative beads are within lower left quadrant and the positive beads are in the upper or lower right quadrant. Adjust the compensation values until the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each population (as shown in the quadrant stats window) is approximately equal (i.e. for FL2-%FL1, the FL2 MFI of both beads should be similar).\nRepeat steps 5.4.11 and 5.4.12 for all tubes.\nProceed to acquiring the actual stained samples. Run the compensation wizard and save the settings with the format \"date experiment your initials\".",
