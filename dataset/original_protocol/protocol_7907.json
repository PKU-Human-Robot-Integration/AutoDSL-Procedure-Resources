    "The protocol is following the Local Research Committee's ethical standards and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n1. Selection of the patients\nAdopt the following inclusion criteria: patients older than 18 years old, fully collaborating, presenting a tumor of the skull base, or pituitary-diencephalic region.\nExclude patients with contraindication to MRI (i.e., a pacemaker or ferromagnetic material) or presenting with emergent clinical conditions (i.e., intracranial hypertension, the acute visual loss that requires immediate surgery), or pregnant women, or patients with mental illness, or those who explicitly refuse to participate in this protocol.\n2. Preparation for the MRI exam\nBefore the MRI exam, administer the safety form to exclude significant contraindication to the exam and contrast agent injection: no ferromagnetic materials in the body, evaluation of MRI devices, safe or conditional, no pacemaker, no eye contact lenses on.\nIf the scanner used for the MRI acquisition is a high field (e.g., 3 T, see Table of Materials), consider any potential additional contraindications related, for example, to neurostimulation devices.\nCheck whether the patient has claustrophobia.\nEnsure that the patient has read and signed the MRI consent form to acknowledge the imaging exam's risks and benefits.\nHave a neuropsychologist perform a general evaluation and a targeted neurocognitive assessment based on the tumor location.\nAdminister the Edinburgh inventory to evaluate handedness dominance29.\n3. Positioning of the patient in the scanner\nGive earplugs to the patient to reduce MRI noise.\nHead movements can affect imaging quality; thus, use foam pads to reduce head movements, immobilizing the head inside the MRI coil.\nProvide an emergency alarm button to the patient in case of need to interrupt the exam.",
    "Switch on the camera and microphone inside the scanner to monitor, speak, and listen to the patient from the MRI acquisition room outside the scanner.\n4. Brain MRI protocol setting and acquisition parameters\nAcquire a standardized multimodal MRI protocol high-field scanner (1.5 T or 3T). The following sequence parameters refer to a 3 T MRI, using a head-neck high-density array coil (64 channels).\nAcquire high-resolution and volumetric anatomical sequences: T1-weighted pre- and post-gadolinium contrast agent administration and FLAIR T2-weighted.\nFor T1 and T2 weighted images acquire continuous sagittal slices providing isotropic resolution of 1x1x1 mm3 scanning time of about 5 min per sequence.\nAcquire a high-resolution T2-weighted sequence and localize the tumor area for cranial nerve visualization: a volumetric CISS (Constructive Interference in Steady State) with voxel dimension of 0.5x0.5x0.5 mm3 (scanning time of about 9 minutes).\nAcquire diffusion-weighted sequences using single-shot echo-planar images (EPI), voxel dimension of 2x2x2 mm3, 64 magnetic gradient directions with b-value of 2000 s/mm2, echo time of 98 ms, and relaxation time of 4300 ms.\nAcquire five volumes with null b-value at the beginning of the diffusion-weighted acquisition with phase encoding direction set to anterior-posterior (for diffusion weighted images total scanning time of 5 minutes).\nAdditionally, acquire three volumes with null b-value but reversed phase encoding direction, posterior-anterior, to correct imaging distortions due to the EPI acquisition (scanning time of 42 seconds). Continuous near-axial slices are acquired.\nAcquire additional sequences to investigate specific tumor features, such as multi- or single-voxel MRI-spectroscopy localized in the tumor area.\n\t​NOTE: The total scanning time duration is about 30 minutes, excluding patient preparation for the MRI exam.\n5. Brain MR images pre-processing\nConvert the MRI data from the imaging format adopted by MRI acquisition consoles, DICOM (.dcm), to the NIFTI format (.nii) used in advanced imaging analyses.",
    "Run the dcm2niix function (https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix).

Tumor segmentation\nInstall the itk-snap software (http://www.itksnap.org) 30.\nOnce the itk-snap software is installed, press File - Open Main Image and select the T1.nii image, then press File - Add Another Imager and upload the Flair.nii and T1_contrast.nii images, setting the semi-transparent overlay option.\nInspect the tumor in the T1.nii, Flair.nii, and T1_contrast.nii images. Choose the anatomical plane to follow when drawing the lesion, e.g., axial.\nPlace the pointer in one axial slice to start. In the Main Toolbar, select the Polygon Inspector icon and start drawing tumor boundaries by using the Freehand Drawing Style - Smooth curve or Polygon.",
    "Once finished drawing the tumor perimeter, close the curve linking the first and last dots, press Accept, and continue drawing in the next slice. For large tumor lesions, to accelerate the drawing process, skip some axial slices (e.g., three), and draw the lesion perimeter in interleaved slices.\nAt the end of the lesion perimeter drawing, select Tools - Interpolate Labels, set the Label to/with interpolate as the tumor lesion and the Interpolate along a single axis as the axis orientation followed in drawing the tumor boundaries.\nSelect Segmentation - Save Segmentation Image and name the tumor segmentation as Tumor_mask.nii by selecting the Nifti format option to save.\n7. Tractography analysis\nRun the FSL-dtifit function to model diffusivity and the different spatial directions and obtain the following diffusion tensor maps: FA.nii, MD.nii, and V1.nii. Evaluate these DTI maps to access abnormal diffusivity values that may occur in the presence of tumor edema or infiltration.\nRun the MRtrix3-tckgen function with the default setting \"ifod2\" to perform probabilistic tractography and reconstruct the white matter pathways by modeling crossing-fibers issues31.\nAdopt a seed-target approach by setting the \"-seed_image\" and \"-include\" options based on a priori anatomical knowledge.\nManually draw regions of interest (ROIs) set as seed or target for tractography. Alternatively, use atlas-based ROIs. See Mormina et at.32 for the optic radiation tractography, Hales et al.33 for the optic chiasm and optic cranial nerves, and Testa et al.34 for the pyramidal tracts.\nLaunch the FSL-fsleyes image viewer, select Open, and choose images to inspect visually.\nIn the FSL- fsleyes viewer, go to Setting - Ortho View 1 and activate the Edit Mode tool.\nClick the FSL-fsleyes pencil icon and draw the tractography ROIs.\nInstall the Freesurfer (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) software.",
    "Run the Freesurfer-Recon-all function on the T1.nii image to obtain the automatic cortical region segmentation to use as tractography ROIs.\nRun the FSL-epi_regregistration function, setting as input image the T1.nii, and reference image the DTI_b2000.nii, save the registration output matrix (T1_onto_DTI.mat).\nUse the obtained T1_onto_DTI.mat matrix to register the segmented ROIs to the DTI_b2000.nii image.\nRun the tractography using the MRtrix3-tckgen function.\nRun the MRtrix3-tckmap function to convert the \".tck\" streamlines tractography output in the \"-template FA.nii\" image.\nRun the FSL-flirt function to linearly register the T1.nii image to the MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.nii template.\nSave the output matrix as T1_onto_MNI.mat. Run the FSL-convert_xfm function setting the \"-concat\" option as T1_onto_MNI.mat and T1_onto_DTI.mat, save the output matrix as DTI_onto_MNI.mat.\n8. Tractography: along-tract analysis\nFor an accurate description of DTI parameters, use along-tract algorithms, such as the Matlab-based algorithm that models the surface tract geometry with the Laplacian operator properties35.\nInstall the Matlab software (https://matlab.mathworks.com) and request the along-tract code to the developing authors35.\nAlternatively, use the MRtrix3-tcksample function for along-tract analysis as Matlab requires a license.\n9. 3D-rendering visualization\nInstall the Surf Ice software (https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/surfice:MainPage).\nIn the Surf Ice command panel, click on Advanced - Convert voxelwise to mesh, select the nifti image to convert, save the resulting .obj file.\nIn the Surf Ice command panel, click File - Open, and select the .obj file to visualize the 3D volume rendering.\n10.
