    "All the procedures involving the use of animals have been approved by the Institutional Review Committees (IACUC) at the University of California, Los Angeles, California.\n1. Imaging System Setup\nNote: See Figure 1 and Figure 2.\nRetrieve a continuous wave (CW) laser with 3 wavelengths: 405 nm, 473 nm, and 532 nm. Place 2 mirrors (M1 and M2) 150 mm apart and align them with their mirror planes at 45° to the beam.\n\tNote: This step is performed to redirect the laser away from the dual-sided illumination setup. The resulting beam will be in the same direction as the initial beam.\nPass the beam through a 25-mm diameter iris diaphragm/pinhole (PH), a 50-mm diameter neutral density filter (NDF) with an optical density range of 0 - 4.0, a beam expander (BE), a 30 mm slit (S) with the width of ~0 - 6 mm, and a mirror (M3), all positioned 150 mm from each other. Place the mirror with its mirror plane at 45° to the beam.\nPass the beam through a 50:50 beam splitter placed 150 mm from M3. Place a mirror (M6) 150 mm from the beam splitter and align it so that its mirror plane is at 45° to the beam that is emitted in the forward direction. Use the reflected beam to form one side of the dual-illumination light sheet.",
    "Place a mirror (M4) 150 mm from the beam splitter and align it so that its mirror plane is at 45° to the beam that was emitted at a 90° angle from the beam splitter. Place a second mirror (M5) 150 mm from M4 and align it so that its mirror plane is at 45° to the beam reflected from M6. Use the beam emitted from M5 to form the second side of the dual-illumination light sheet.\nSet up the dual-sided illumination system in a symmetric fashion (see Figure 1). Place one cylindrical lens (CL1) [diameter (d) = 1 in; focal length (f) = 50 mm] 150 mm in line with the beam emitted from M5 on one side and another identical cylindrical lens (CL2) 150 mm in line with the beam emitted from M6 on the other side of the dual-illumination setup. Place 2 mirrors (M7 and M8) each in line with the cylindrical lenses at distances of 50 mm to reflect the beam at 90°.\nForm an achromatic doublet from a pair of lenses. Place the first lens, L1 (d = 1 in; f = 100 mm), 100 mm from M7, and the second lens, L2 (d = 1 in; f = 60 mm), 160 mm from L1. Repeat this on the other side of the dual-illumination with identical lenses (L3, L4) placed the same distance from M8.\nPlace mirrors, M9 and M10, 60 mm from lenses L2 and L4, respectively, and in line with the beam. Place the illumination objectives, OL1 and OL2 (d = 2 in; f = 150 mm), 150 mm from M9 and M10 and in line with the beam. The beam emitted from the objectives forms the light sheet for imaging the samples.",
    "Use a 3-D printer to print the sample holder from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Embed a piece of cover glass [refractive index (RI) = 1.4745] on each side of the chamber, perpendicular to the illumination beam, to minimize refractive index mismatching. Evenly place the chamber in between the beams emitted from the objective lenses.\nInstall a stereo microscope with a 1X magnification objective and a scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera perpendicular to the illumination plane (see Figure 2).\n2. Imaging System Calibration\nRetrieve fluorescent polystyrene beads that are 0.53 μm in diameter.\nPrepare the fluorescent bead sample by diluting the bead solution in a refractive index matching solution (RIMS) with 1% low-melt pointing agarose to 1:150,000. Cut a piece of borosilicate glass tubing with an inner diameter of 12 mm and an outer diameter of 18 mm to a length of 30 mm.\n\tNote: The borosilicate glass tubing is used to match the refractive index (1.47).\nMix the diluted bead sample with 1% agarose and pipette the bead/agarose solution into the borosilicate tubing. Allow the agarose to solidify at room temperature (23 °C).\nFill the ABS chamber (from step 1.7) with a 99.5% glycerol solution. Place the borosilicate glass tubing containing the beads inside the chamber. Place the ABS chamber in the imaging system so that it is in the center of the Gaussian beam created by the dual illumination system.\nAttach a 3-D motorized translational stage to the borosilicate glass tubing to control the movement and orientation of the sample within the ABS chamber (see Supplemental Figure 1).",
    "Acquire images using the sCMOS camera at a rate of 30 frames per second (fps). Using the motor controller, move the sample 1 mm in the lateral direction and acquire images at each 1-mm increment using the sCMOS camera. Continue until the entire sample has been imaged.\nStack the acquired images using a visualization software (see Table of Materials). Measure the point spread function (PSF) of the system using these bead images. Use this PSF for deconvolution during the image processing in later steps.\n3. Sample Preparation\nDissect hearts from a wild type P1 mouse and from a double heterozygous sarcolipin-Cre knockin mouse with the Rosa26-YFP gene (SlnCre/+; R26YFP reporter/+) at P7.\n\tNote: Euthanasia was performed using pentobarbital and the technique described by Robbins et al.10. The dissection was performed according to the technique described by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)10,11.\nPerform a chemical clearing of the murine hearts as described by Kevin Sung et al.12.\n\tNote: The following steps should be performed in a fume hood since the chemicals being used are toxic.\n\t\nRinse the hearts in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3x for 10 min. After rinsing, place the hearts in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution and incubate these samples at 4 °C overnight.\nPlace the samples in a 4% acrylamide solution containing 0.5% w/v of 2,2’-Azobis dihydrochloride. Allow the samples to incubate at 4 °C overnight. After the overnight incubation, remove the samples and incubate them at 37 °C for 2 - 3 h.",
    "Rinse the samples with PBS and then place them in a solution of 8% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate and 1.25% w/v boric acid. Incubate the samples at 37 °C until they are clear. This can take several hours depending on the thickness of the sample. After clearing, remove the samples and place them in 1x phosphate-buffered saline for 1 day.\nPrepare a refractive index matching solution with 40 g of nonionic density gradient medium (see Table of Materials) in 30 mL of 0.02 M phosphate buffer (PB), 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% sodium azide. Bring the solution to a pH of 7.5 with sodium hydroxide.\nPlace the cleared sample in RIMS with a refractive index of 1.46 - 1.48 and 1% agarose. Insert the sample into borosilicate glass tubing and allow the agarose to solidify at room temperature (23 °C).\nAttach a 3-D motorized translational stage to the borosilicate glass tubing to control the movement and orientation of the sample within the 3-D printed ABS chamber (see Supplemental Figure 1).\n4. Adult Heart Imaging\nInject 8.7 x 1012 viruses of type adeno-associated virus vector 9 (AAV9) containing a cardiac-specific troponin T promoter (cTnT) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a 100-μL volume into the tail vein of a 2-month wild type (C57BL/6) mouse.\n\tNote: The AAV9 was developed according to the technique described by Yuan et al.13. This causes GFP to bind to the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) producing AAV9-cTnT-ROMK-GFP (see Table of Materials).\nDissect the adult mouse hearts at 7.5 months of age according to the technique described by the NHLBI11. Prepare the samples using steps 3.1 - 3.3.",
    "Connect the motor controller to the motor actuator. Attach the actuator to the borosilicate glass tubing to control the movement and orientation of the sample within the 3-D printed ABS chamber.\nPosition the sample so that it is in the center of the Gaussian beam created by the dual illumination system. Acquire images using the sCMOS camera at a rate of 100 fps.\nUsing the motor controller, move the sample 1 mm in the axial direction and acquire images at each 1-mm increment with the sCMOS camera. Continue until the entire sample has been imaged.\n\tNote: The system is controlled by a custom-developed instrument-control software.\nStack the acquired images using a visualization software (see Table of Materials). Develop 3-D images using these image stacks and the visualization software14. Deconvolve the PSF from step 2.6 with the acquired image stack. Set a pixel threshold intensity value to observe the contours of the heart and add pseudo-color to the images based on this gray-scale intensity.\nSubscription Required.
