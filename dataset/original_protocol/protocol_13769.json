    "Animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Scanner preparation\nAdjust the scanner height so that the distance to the scanned subject is approximately 30 cm.\nTurn on the imager and launch the associated software.\nOpen the Measurement program. If the software is correctly communicating with the scanner, the infrared laser turn on warning will appear.\nCalibrate the machine with manufacturer provided standards (not shown in the video and will depend on the specific model of machine being used).\nAdjust the scanner settings to be appropriate for the background material and lighting setup in the room.\n\t\nSet the gain levels DC FLUX and CONC, per the manufacturer's instructions (not shown in the video).\nSet the Background Threshold by pointing the laser beam at the black background material, and press Auto BK Set.\n2. Mouse pre-scanning preparation\nSet up the isoflurane induction chamber with appropriate scavenging of the waste gas.\n\tNOTE: Placing the induction chamber on a warming pad will help prevent mouse temperature loss during anesthesia induction.\nTurn on the homeothermic blanket, which is placed in the scanning area underneath a nonreflective surface (in this case a black neoprene fabric). Set the homeothermic blanket to maintain a body temperature of 37 °C.\nPosition the temperature probe for the homeothermic blanket and lubricant so they are ready for insertion.\nPlace the anesthesia mask and scavenging system in the scanning area.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an isoflurane vaporizer. Set the oxygen rate to 1 L/min of flow and adjust the isoflurane to 4% for anesthesia induction. Turn on the flow to the anesthesia induction chamber, and the mouse breathing rate will slow. Adequate anesthesia is achieved when the mouse loses its righting reflex.",
    "Transfer the mouse to an anesthetic mask/nose cone with attached waste gas scavenger and adjust the isoflurane to 1.5%.\n\tNOTE: This anesthesia level is generally adequate to keep the mouse lying relatively still during scanning, but is not intended to provide surgical levels of anesthesia, so the depth of anesthesia is not checked. Changing the isoflurane level causes changes in heartbeat, respiration, and dermal perfusion, so a consistent percentage should be used throughout any time course experiment and for all experimental subjects. Alternative anesthetic techniques such as IP injection of ketamine xylazine can also be used, but the same anesthetic technique should be used throughout any time course study as different anesthetics affect dermal perfusion differently.\n(Optional depending on scanning area) If the planned region of interest to be scanned is covered by fur, use a small electric trimmer or depilatory cream to remove the hair from the region of interest.\n\tNOTE: The depilatory cream should be completely removed, and the mouse skin dried prior to scanning.\nPlace the mouse in the appropriate scanning position on the black nonreflective surface covering the homeothermic blanket, confirming that both hindlimbs remain on the heat source throughout equilibration and scanning (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: It is important to maintain both feet on the homeothermic blanket to prevent regional variation in temperature.\nInsert the lubricated rectal temperature probe associated with the homeothermic blanket.\nEquilibrate the mouse temperature to desired scanning temperature (37 °C); approximately 5-10 minutes.",
    "Select Scanner Setup, which can be accessed from the top menu or from the scanner setup icon. Adjust the scan area by changing the X-Y coordinates to accommodate the region of interest. Scan speed will depend on the scan resolution. Higher resolution will result in longer scan times. For repeat scanning focusing on global perfusion, as opposed to higher resolution focusing on anatomic perfusion, a scan speed of 4 ms/pixel is adequate.\n\t​NOTE: Higher resolution and single scan should be considered if the researcher is attempting to directly study the developing collateral circulation (best imaged in the ventral thigh and calf where it is closer to the skin). Repeated scan at lower resolution/speed (e.g., 4 ms/pixel) is adequate when assessing global perfusion to the end organ of the mouse footpad. The software shown in the video automatically loads the previously used template for scanning area, speed, and resolution when restarted, or it can be retrieved from a stored file if different regions of interest are being used for various experiments.\nIf performing repeat scans, select the Repeat and Line Scan tab. The number of scans can be changed (in this case 3 scans) as well as the repeat interval. The minimum time for the repeat interval would be the estimated scanning time, which is shown in the grayed-out area on the right of the box determined by scan area and scan resolution. Adding a few seconds allows the user to pause and potentially reposition the mouse if needed between scans.\n3. Scanning\nSelect the Image Scan tab and select the Mark button. The laser will move to outline the scanning area. Adjust the mouse position so that the target to be scanned is within the marked area.",
    "NOTE: For footpad or footpad and calf scanning, prone positioning with the hindlimbs extended provides a more consistent region of interest than supine positioning. The femoral artery and saphenous artery and collaterals are very close to the ventral surface of the thigh and calf, so supine positioning is preferred if using these regions of interest.\nStart repeated measurement by selecting the Repeat Scanning icon and press the Play Button to initiate the scan.\nConfirm the scanning distance in the pop-up window and click OK to start scanning.\nMonitor the mouse during scanning for mouse movement; if the mouse moves sufficiently that the hindpaws are no longer in the scanning region in the middle of a scan, restart the scan. Small variations in mouse hindpaw position can be accommodated for in the analysis software.\nMonitor the mouse temperature during the scanning process as it may fluctuate even with the use of the homeothermic blanket. If there is too much variation in the mouse temperature, this may result in significant variation between scans. Generally, a temperature range of 36.8-37.2 °C will result in acceptable data.\nSave the captured scan under the Save as window with a file name that includes mouse identifier and timepoint for easier data analysis. Enter mouse and timepoint details if desired in the subject details window.\nTurn off the isoflurane and remove the rectal temperature probe.\nDisinfect the rectal temperature probe with 70% ethanol so it is ready for use in the next mouse.\nAllow the mouse to recover from anesthesia to the point where it displays a righting reflex by flipping from the supine position to the prone position prior to returning it to the cage.",
    "​NOTE: Recovery can be carried out either on a warming blanket for isoflurane since recovery is very quick or in a warmed recovery cage for ketamine/xylazine.\n4. Capturing LDPI data (Figure 3)\nOpen the imaging review software program.\nGo to the file menu, open, and locate the saved file.\nSelect the ROI icon from the toolbar.\nSelect the Add Polygon button.\nTrace the region of interest (ROI) for the control hindlimb using the mouse. Polygon tracing does not have to be exact as the gray background will not be included in the calculated averages.\nRepeat steps 4.3-4.5 for the surgical hindlimb.\nChoose the Statistics icon to open the Image ROIs Statistics Results (PU) window.\nExport the results for Polygon 1 (control hindlimb) and Polygon 2 (surgical hindlimb) to a data collection worksheet via copy/paste.\n5. Analysis\nCapture the data as Surgical/Control ratio for each scan.\nUse the averaged surgical/control for all three scans for the data point for that particular mouse at that timepoint. Because of biologic variability in the response to hindlimb ischemia, in general 8-10 mice are required per timepoint to achieve reproducible results with ~10% standard error.\n\tNOTE: Before allowing the mouse to recover from anesthesia, it is worthwhile to perform a quick analysis of the repeated scans to check if the data is too variable (e.g., more than 100-150 perfusion units different between scans 1-3). High variation between repeated scans suggests the mouse was not completely equilibrated during the scan (Figure 2), and a repeat scan can be performed without losing a datapoint, which would occur if the images are not analyzed until a later date. Changing the color palette to optimize the dynamic range of displayed flux values may be necessary to better display scan variation (Figure 2).",
