Must check the tightness of the membrane module before use it.\nMake two 2 L lab-scale reactor using plexiglass (bioreactor size: diameter 16 cm × height 16 cm) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) for assemble membrane reactor system and conventional reactor system. Clean the reactor and pipes using sterile water and sterilize them under UV conditions.\nAssemble the reactor, aeration equipment, peristaltic pump, stirring equipment, inlet pipe, outlet pipe, fresh medium storage tank and effluent storage tank to form a membrane reactor system (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: The inlet pipe and outlet pipe are peristaltic pump packages that do not require researchers to make additional purchases. Just use ordinary sterilized containers as the fresh medium storage tank and effluent storage tank.\nSet up a conventional reactor with no flat membrane at the same time (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nInoculate and cultivate bacteria in reactors before turning on the peristaltic pump.",
    "Prepare 4 L sterile optimum inorganic medium of DSM 505 according to the DSMZ THIOBACILLUS MEDIUM (https://www.dsmz.de/microorganisms/medium/pdf/DSMZ_Medium36.pdf[href=https://www.dsmz.de/microorganisms/medium/pdf/DSMZ_Medium36.pdf]). Additionally add 0.75 g/L Na2CO3 and 0.75 g/L NaHCO3 to the medium to maintain enough carbon sources.\nPour 2 L of the sterile mixed medium into membrane reactor, conventional reactor and fresh medium storage tank separately.\nSeed 100 mL bacteria at the logarithmic phase into the medium of membrane reactor and the medium of conventional reactor.\nTurn on the power of the magnetic stirrer with a stirring speed of over 200 rpm.\nTurn on the power of air pumps to supply air into both reactors with an aeration rate of 1 L/min in order to supply CO2 and O2 as carbon source and electron acceptor.\nNote: Adjust the inoculation volume according to volume of reactor, but the inoculation ratio of 5% (V/V) is recommended. The rotational speed of magnetic stirring rotors should enable the good mixing of the medium in reactors. Researchers should increase the aeration flow when the reactor is designed for a larger volume.\nIncubate bacteria for 3 days at 28°C.\nNote: This incubation allows the bacteria to adapt to reactor and become metabolically active. If researchers choose different chemoautotrophic bacteria, researchers should shorten or lengthen this incubation time according to the generation time.\nReactor system set up.\nFor the membrane reactor system, turn on two peristaltic pumps to flow sterile fresh medium of DSM 505 into the membrane reactor with a flow rate of 1 L/day and filter the liquid out of the reactor through the membrane module at a flow rate of 1 L/day.\nFor the conventional reactor system, add 20 mL of culture medium concentrate (25-fold) once every 3 days to maintain enough energy and carbon sources.",
    "Note: Add 0.75 g/L Na2CO3 and 0.75 g/L NaHCO3 into the sterile fresh medium to maintain enough carbon source. The inflow rate and outflow rate are same. Adjust the inflow rate and outflow rate according to bacterial generation time. Add 25 times the amount of the components in the DSMZ THIOBACILLUS MEDIUM (https://www.dsmz.de/microorganisms/medium/pdf/DSMZ_Medium36.pdf[href=https://www.dsmz.de/microorganisms/medium/pdf/DSMZ_Medium36.pdf]) , except distilled water, into 1 L distilled water to obtain culture medium concentrate (25-fold).\nOperate the membrane reactor system and the conventional reactor system for 11 days. During the operation period, adjust pH in both reactors to 5.0–7.0 with 1.0 M NaOH and collect suitable volume of bacterial solution every day for next experiments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2673-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Schematic diagram of conventional bioreactor system\nNote: During the cultivation of DSM 505, bacteria oxidize sodium thiosulfate to produce sulfate, the pH of culture decreases. Therefore, researchers need to adjust pH by adding NaOH to ensure that pH do not affect the growth and carbon fixation of DSM 505.\nDeterminate total organic carbon (TOC) yield fixed by DSM 505.\nCollect 15 mL bacterial solution into a clean TOC bottle (used for TOC analyzer) from two reactors every day.\nNote: The volume of bacterial solution for TOC determination should meet the minimum detection volume of the instrument. Make sure the TOC bottle is cleaned and not contaminated with organic matter.\nAdd an appropriate volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH to about 4.\nNote: The addition of hydrochloric acid to adjust pH to acidity is to exclude the influence of inorganic carbon.",
