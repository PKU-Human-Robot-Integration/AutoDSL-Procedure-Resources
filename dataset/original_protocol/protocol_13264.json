  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Stanford laboratory animal care APLAC number 33420, use of animals for scientific purposes, and the ARVO Statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. A total of 10 male and female C57BL/6 mice aged 8-12 weeks were generously provided by the Irving L. Weissman laboratory. The animals were acclimatized to a 12 h light-dark cycle and provided with water and feed ad libitum. Injury was induced to one eye of the animal.\n1. Preparation for the experiment\nPreparation of materials\n\tNOTE: All reagents are to be maintained at room temperature.\n\t\nPrepare the punch-trephine: Prepare a biopsy punch with a diameter of 3.5 mm and mark the shaft of the punch 5 mm away from its distal edge. Affix the punch firmly and cut the marked distal part of its shaft using a two-speed rotary tool. Wear ocular protection during this process. Cut the shaft at 3.5 mm depth and leave the final 1.5 mm attached. Bend the tip 90˚, as shown in Figure 1.\nPrepare 0.5 M NaOH solution by dissolving 1 g NaOH in 50 mL of distilled water.\nPrepare 10 mL of anesthetic cocktail by combining 2 mL of 100 mg/mL ketamine and 1 mL of 20 mg/mL xylazine. Prior to injection, dilute this mixture with 7 mL of 0.9% NaCl (normal saline).\nPrepare 0.1% fluorescein sodium solution by adding 0.1 mL of 10% AK-Fluor fluorescent liquid into 9.9 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS).\nPrepare PBS (1x) by dissolving 8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g Na2HPO4, and 0.23 g NaH2PO4in 900 mL of distilled water. Adjust the pH of the solution to 7.4. Bring the solution to a final volume of 1 L by adding distilled water.",
    "Prepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for fixation. Under a chemical hood, dissolve 2 g PFA in 45 mL of PBS. Heat the mixture to 65 °C and titrate its pH to 7.4. Once the PFA has dissolved, bring the solution to a final volume of 50 mL.\n2. Animal preparation\nWeigh the mouse to determine the appropriate volume of injectable anesthetic cocktail for injection. After properly handling and restraining the mouse as described in Machholz et al.15, administer the anesthetic cocktail intraperitoneally (IP) at a dose of 0.01 mL/g16,17. Target the inferior abdominal quadrants for IP injection to prevent organ damage.\nInject buprenorphine extended-release injectable suspension (3.25 mg/kg) subcutaneously for additional analgesia during and after surgery as corneal alkali injury is extremely painful.\nWait until a deep plane of anesthesia is achieved. Check for a lack of response to toe pinch as an indication of a successful deep plane of anesthesia. Apply simple eye ointment for the contralateral eye to prevent it from dryness before starting surgery.       \nAfter anesthesia, place the mouse on the surgical table prepared according to standard rodent surgery principles18. Place a 5 mm high pillow under the rodent's head, positioned in the lateral decubitus position. The pillow helps support the rodent's head during surgery.\nAdminister tetracaine hydrochloride (0.5%) eye drops for further anesthesia. Properly dry the ocular surface with a surgical eye spear and trim the eyelashes.\n3. Induction of alkali injury\nBefore starting surgery, organize the surgery table as per standard rodent surgery principles18,19 and keep the surgical field sterile during surgery. Position the surgical microscope to properly visualize the anesthetized mouse and adjust the timer to 30 s. Place a twisted paper towel onto the animal's muzzle to prevent unintended nasal aspiration during the rinsing process.",
    "Determine the limbal area circumference using the surgical microscope while ensuring that the eyelids of the mouse are wide open using the thumb and index fingers. Gently hold the clean punch-trephine parallel to the axis of the eye, without applying any downward pressure. Avoid twirling the instrument and keep the axis of the punch-trephine parallel to the axis of the globe.\nAsk the surgical assistant to drop 3 drops of NaOH solution (equal to 40 µL) into the punch-trephine's hole to fill the tool and cover the corneal surface appropriately. The surface tension of the liquid prevents any leakage out of the instrument (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: We utilized a 1 mm syringe with a 27G needle featuring a flattened tip angled at 50° to carefully drop the NaOH solution.\nAfter 30 s, immediately rinse the cornea and fornix with 5 mL of PBS (1x). Video 1 demonstrates the procedure for inducing chemical injury.\nUse a universal pH indicator paper to ensure a pH of 7 - 7.5 on the corneal surface of the injured eye. Then, apply the triple-antibiotic ophthalmic ointment over the chemically injured ocular surface.\n\tNOTE: Tail movement during surgery is a sign of low anesthetic depth. Apply additional anesthetic cocktail (ketamine+ xylazine) by injecting an anesthetic [bolus IP (50% of the initial volume)].\nAfter surgery, confirm that the mouse is in a stable condition. Administer second buprenorphine if the animal is in pain. Use the same handling technique as in 2.2. Start the postoperative examination while the animal is under anesthesia.\nAfter the procedure, wash, dry and sanitize the punch-trephine and the surgical table with 70% ethanol.\n4. Clinical evaluation\nFor examination, anesthetize the mouse as previously described in step 2.1.",
    "Examine the eyes (injured and non-injured) under a slit-lamp biomicroscope. Use a camera to capture photos (in this study, a phone camera in Cinematic mode was used).\nScore corneal opacity according to the Yoeruek grading system20: 0 = normal, clear cornea; 1 = mild opacity; 2 = greater opacity, but the iris and pupil are easily distinguishable; 3 = iris and pupil are barely distinguishable; 4 = cornea is completely opaque with an invisible pupil.\nApply 0.1% fluoresceine eye drops. Dry excess fluorescent liquid with a cotton applicator and evaluate for the presence of corneal epithelial defects using the cobalt blue filter. Capture photos.\nMonitor the animal until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not reintroduce the animal to other animals until it has completely recovered.\n5. Enucleation\nEuthanize mice 2 weeks after chemical injury induction by cervical dislocation in 3-5 s21.\nEnucleate the eye while preserving the medial caruncle and whole palpebral conjunctiva in the following order, as shown in Video 2.\nUnder the surgical microscope, carefully dissect the junction of the caruncle and skin. Using tooth forceps, retract the caruncle and guide the tip of surgical scissors under the palpebral conjunctiva towards its junction with the tarsal plate.\nCut the conjunctiva along the adhesion line towards the lateral canthus. Then, turn the surgical scissors to the junction of the conjunctiva and inferior tarsal plate at the subconjunctival plane.\nAfter completing conjunctival dissection, retract the superior and inferior eyelids from the nasal side with the thumb and index fingers. While retracting, guide the tip of a curved-tip tweezer behind the protruded lacrimal glad towards the optic nerve. Firmly grasp the optic nerve and extract the globe (Figure 2).\nRinse the globe with PBS (1x) and transfer it into the fixating solution.",
    "6. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining\nFix the globes in 10% formalin solution overnight at room temperature.\nDehydrate the tissues using a sequential series of graded alcohol with concentrations of 70% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 90% ethanol, and 100% ethanol, each for 10-15 min. Subsequently, immerse the eyes in xylene for 10 min. Finally, encase the eyes in paraffin.\nSection the paraffin blocks into 6 µm thick slices and mount them on glass microscope slides for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, as described in Supplementary File 1.\n7. Immunofluorescence imaging and analysis\nFor immunohistochemistry studies (IHC), fix the eyes in 1 mL of PBS (1x) containing 4% PFA at 4 ˚C overnight. Wash the sample 3x in 1 mL of PBS (1x) for 5 min each.\nTo prevent ice crystal formation and to protect the molecular structures of the proteins, perform serial sucrose saturation with 10% sucrose, 20% sucrose, and 30% sucrose concentrations in PBS. Embed the globes in optical coherence tomography solution (OCT; Figure 2), and store them at -80 °C.\nSection the OCT block into 12 µm thick slices and mount on glass microscope slides for IHC staining.\nPermeabilize tissue sections on microscope slides in 0.1% Triton X −100 in PBS (1x) for 15 min. Then, block nonspecific antigens with 5% BSA in PBS (1x) for an additional 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate tissue sections on microscope slides at 4 °C overnight in the cocktail of the targeted primary antibodies prepared in PBS (1x) containing 1% BSA. In this experiment, the primary antibodies were 1:100 diluted rabbit anti-keratin 13 (K13) and anti-keratin 12 (K12) antibodies with concentration of 2.24 µg/mL and 1.56 µg/mL, respectively.",
    "After incubation, wash the tissue sections on microscope slides 3x with PBS (1x). Subsequently, detect bound primary antibodies with 1:500 diluted donkey anti-rabbit-IgG. Incubate with the secondary antibody at 4 ˚C for 1 h in the dark. Then wash in PBS (1x) 3x for 5 min each.\nApply a drop of anti-fade fluorescence mounting medium containing DAPI on the tissue sections on microscope and cover with a coverslip. Allow samples to dry in the dark and examine them under a fluorescent microscope with the same laser setting for normal and injured eyes."
