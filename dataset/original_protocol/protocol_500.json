    "**Hapten coating on microtiter plates** \n1  Prepare fresh 47% \\(v/v) HNO<sub>3</sub> in concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in a glass beaker in a fume hood.\n2  Load 250 ml of acid in each well of microtiter plate and incubate for 30 min at room temperature under mild shaking to generate &#x2013;NO<sub>2</sub> groups on polystyrene surface.\n**\\! Caution** Care should be taken to hold the concentrated HNO3. You can do this step in fume hood also\n3  Wash plate two times with DDW.\n4  Prepare 5%  aminopropyltriethoxy silane \\(APTES) solution in DDW \\(pH 6.9).\n**\\! Caution** Glassware used for APTES solution should be pre-siliconised by dipping in 10% GOPS solution prepared in water.\n5   Load 250 ml of APTES solution in each well of microtiter plate and incubate for 2 h at room temperature to generate &#x2013;NH<sub>2</sub> groups on PS surface.\n6   Wash plate two times with DDW.\n7   Cure the microtiter plates at 62 <sup>o</sup>C for 2 h to enhance the binding of APTES to the PS surface. \n8   Prepare the activated hapten \\(2,4-D) by mixing 10 mg 2,4-D together with 1.7 mg \\(15 mmoles) NHS and 6.2 mg \\(30 mmoles) DCC in 1.3 ml DMF. \n9   Incubate the reaction mixture for 4 h at RT \n**\\! Note**  Steps 8-9 should be started prior to hapten coating on PS microtiter plate\n10  Centrifuge the solution at 12000 RPM to remove the acyl urea precipitate.\n11  Reconstitute the activated hapten solution in 0.05M carbonate buffer \\(pH9.6) to make the final concentration at 250 nmol/ml\n12 Add 100 &#xB5;l of activated 2,4-D  into each well of microtiter plate. \n13   Incubate the plate overnight at 4 <sup>o</sup>C.\n14   Wash the plate three times with PBS.",
    "15   Block the unbound sites of PS surface with 0.2 M formaldehyde in PBS by incubating the plates for 2 h at 37 <sup>o</sup>C.\n16   Wash the plate four times thoroughly with PBS.\n17   Add 100 ml per well anti-2,4-D antibody solution prepared in PBSM at 0.1 mg/ml concentration.\n \n18 Incubate the plate for 2 h at 37 <sup>o</sup>C\n19   Wash the plate five times with PBS.\n20  Load 100 ml per well secondary antibody \\(goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP) at 1:5000 dilution made in PBSM.\n21   Incubate the plate for 1 h at 37 <sup>o</sup>C\n22   Wash the plate six times with PBS.\n23   Add 100 ml per well TMB substrate for color development. \n24   Stop the reaction after 30 minutes by adding 50 ml per well 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.\n25   Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with ELISA reader.\n**Competitive inhibition using hapten coated microtiter plates**\n26   Prepare hapten coated plates as described in steps \\(1-16).\n**\\! Note** Hapten-protein conjugate \\(0.5 mg/well in carbonate buffer) coated plate are selected as positive control\n27   Pre-mix the anti-2,4-D antibody \\(0.1 mg/ml) with different concentrations of free hapten \\(0.5 pg/ml to 5 &#xB5;g/ml) in PBSM for 30 minutes.\n \n28   Add 100 ml of pre-incubated mixture in each well.\n29   Incubate the plate for 2 h at 37 <sup>o</sup>C.\n30   Wash the plate five times with PBS.\n31  Load into each well 100 ml of goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP \\(1:5000 dilution) prepared in PBSM.\n32   Incubate the plate for 1 h at 37 <sup>o</sup>C\n33   Wash the plate six times with PBS.\n34   Add 100 ml per well TMB substrate for color development. \n35&#xF7;   Stop the reaction after 30 minutes by adding 50 ml per well 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.\n36   Measure the absorbance at 450 nm with ELISA reader",
    "37  Analyze the data by normalizing the absorbance using the following formula:\n  % B/B0 = \\{\\(A - A<sub>ex</sub>) / \\(A<sub>0</sub> &#x2013; A<sub>ex</sub>)} x 100\nwhere A: absorbance of hapten at standard concentration, A<sub>0</sub>: absorbance at zero hapten concentration, and A<sub>ex</sub>: Absorbance at excess hapten concentration."
