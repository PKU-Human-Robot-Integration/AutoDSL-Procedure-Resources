    "Handling and water deprivation If mice are ordered from a supplier, group house same-gender mice (3–4 per cage) with unlimited access to food and water in a temperature/humidity-controlled (25 ± 2 °C, 40%–60%, respectively), 12 h reversed light/dark cycle room (light from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) for at least one week. If mice were born in the laboratory, make sure that they are group housed with same-gender animals (3–4 per cage), after being weaned at three weeks of age, with unlimited access to food and water in a temperature/humidity-controlled (25 ± 2 °C, 40%–60%, respectively), 12 h reversed light/dark cycle room (light from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.). The whole procedure should be conducted during the dark phase of the light cycle (i.e., between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.). Run mice in experiment 3 in context A during the morning and in context B during the afternoon. Run each mouse in experiments 1 and 2 within the dark cycle, around the same time of the first acclimation session (± 3 h).Single house all mice and handle them for 5 min for at least three consecutive days during the dark cycle. To habituate a mouse to handling, pick it up from the tail with one hand, and place it on the other hand while wearing cotton/polyester knit gloves. Gently keep the tail on one hand while the mouse is standing or walking on the other hand to prevent escapes. Handling is considered complete when mice stop trying to jump out of the hand, after at least three consecutive days of handling.The day following mice handling, remove water bottles from their home cage 24 h prior to the beginning of the experiment, during the dark cycle.",

Schematic representation of the procedure. Experimental flowchart for each condition and group. The last three columns from the left represent the three different phases of the procedure (Acclimation, Conditioning, and Test). Illustration reproduced from Bouchekioua et al. (2022).Acclimation phase (Day 1 to Day 5) Give each mouse a 30 min session of acclimation in the conditioning chamber inside a sound attenuating cubicle for five consecutive days (Figure 1). During the acclimation phase, mice have access to the water-filled lick tubes via the magazine. The number of licks and magazine entries are recorded. For the first two days of acclimation, leave two drops of water inside the magazine.Clean the chambers between animals with a 70% ethanol solution during the whole experiment.Make sure that the acclimation script “SPC_Acclimation.ino” (https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression[href=https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression]) is uploaded to the Arduino.If connected, disconnect the USB cable from the Arduino to the USB port of your PC (Mac OS or Windows) or Raspberry Pi.If you use a PC (Mac OS or Windows), open the Arduino IDE, left click Tools in the menu bar and place your mouse cursor over the Port row (Figure 2). Take note of the port names displayed, if any. Connect the Arduino USB cable to your PC and go back to the Port row of the Tools menu. Take note of the new port name that appears. It corresponds to the port name to which your Arduino is connected.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4568/bioprotoc-12-23-4568-g002.jpgFigure 2.

The red arrow highlights a piece of transparent acrylic used as a stand and placed inside the magazine to facilitate access to the water port to mice. (B) Picture (from the inside of the chamber, facing the magazine) showing the configuration of the conditioning chamber used for Context A. The red arrows point to the magazine light, the two speakers, the water port, and the beam break sensor (the infrared light being at the opposite side of the magazine). The bottom and top of the speakers were at 3.5 and 8 cm from the grid floor, respectively. The speakers were fixed to the middle panel (i.e., the second panel from the top) of the wall (magazine side), using screws [cf., ChamberSideView (Water bottle and Speakers).jpeg, https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression/tree/main/BioProtocol%20Github[href=https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression/tree/main/BioProtocol%20Github]]. The bottom and top of the beam break LEDs were fixed with super glue and hot glue at 1.5 and 2 cm from the grid floor, respectively. The bottom and top of the water port were at 2.5 and 3 cm from the grid floor, respectively. Holes for the beam break LEDs and the water port were drilled to the aluminum magazine with a conventional drill and drill bits. The positions of the speakers, water port, and beam break LEDs were the same for both contexts (i.e., contexts A and B).Use Context B for mice of the Unpaired Control group of the Context-Only condition, and mice of the Experimental, No-treatment Control, and Unpaired Control groups of the Cued-Only condition (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4568/bioprotoc-12-23-4568-g005.jpgFigure 5.

The red arrows highlight the white plastic floor, the triangular-shaped ceiling (made of two 1 mm thick acrylic boards connected with two transparent acrylic hinges and forming an angle of 80°), the water port, and a white plastic board used to prevent escapes to the top of the triangular-shaped ceiling.Run all mice of the Compound condition (i.e., Experimental and No-treatment Control groups) twice a day. Use Context A in the morning and Context B in the afternoon six hours later (Figure 1).Remove the mouse from the chamber at the end of the 30 min session.Give access to water for 30 min at home cage after each session to mice in conditions Context-Only and Cued-Only. Give access to water for 30 min at home cage after the last session of the day to mice in condition Compound.Fear conditioning phase (Day 6) Place a black opaque plastic/acrylic sheet in front of the magazine to prevent magazine entries and access to the water-filled lick tube (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4568/bioprotoc-12-23-4568-g006.jpgFigure 6.

Upload the script “SPC_Phase_2_US-CS_30min.ino” to the Arduino for mice of the Unpaired group in condition Cued-Only (https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression[href=https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression]).Mice of all groups and conditions, except the Unpaired group in condition Cued-Only, receive a 1 s, 0.5 mA foot shock at the following onsets: 5.15, 9.15, 14.15, 17.15, 21.15, and 25.15 min into the session.Mice of the Unpaired group in condition Cued-Only receive a 1 s, 0.5 mA foot shock at the following onsets: 8.5, 11.7, 15.9, 18.3, 22.25, and 23.8 min into the session.Mice of all groups in the Cued-Only and Compound conditions receive a 10 s, 12 kHz pure tone at the following onsets: 5, 9, 14, 17, 21, and 25 min into the session, that is, 9 s before the onset of each foot shock.Connect the Arduino to the PC/Raspberry Pi.Use Context A for mice of all groups and conditions (Figure 1).Place the mouse in the conditioning chamber inside a sound attenuating cubicle and press the start button connected to your Arduino as soon as you release the mouse.Remove the mouse from the chamber at the end of the 30 min session.Give access to water for 30 min at home cage after each session to all mice.Test phase (fear extinction: days 7–10) Give each mouse a 30 min session of fear extinction in the conditioning chamber inside a sound attenuating cubicle for only one day for mice of the Control Unpaired groups and four consecutive days for mice of all the other groups (Figure 1). During the test phase, mice have access to the water-filled lick tubes via the magazine. The number of licks and magazine entries are recorded.Follow steps B.1.a. to B.1.",
    "g except that the script for the Arduino and the Python data collection scripts should correspond to the test phase, condition, and groups.Upload the script “Acclimation.ino” to the Arduino for all mice in condition Context-Only (https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression[href=https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression]) and use the Python script “Acclimation.py” on your PC/Raspberry Pi for data collection. Test sessions of all mice in condition Context-Only are the same as acclimation sessions.Upload the script “SPC_TEST.ino” to the Arduino for all mice in condition Cued-Only and all mice in condition Compound for a.m. sessions (https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression[href=https://github.com/YuYuB/Bio-Protocol-ConditionedLickSuppression]) and use the Python script “TEST.py” for data collection. Test sessions of all mice in condition Cued-Only and all mice in condition Compound for a.m. sessions consist of a tone cue delivery triggered up to five times by five cumulative seconds spent inside the magazine. The session ends if five tone cues are triggered, or after 30 min elapsed.Test sessions of all mice in condition Compound are the same as the morning acclimation sessions (i.e., step C.2.a) and the Cued-Only test sessions in the afternoon (i.e., step C.2.b)."
