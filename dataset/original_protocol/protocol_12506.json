    "1. Preparation of the Auditory Stimuli\nFirst record the sound-stimuli while being played inside the bore of the 7T MR system. The bore is a confined space that can distort the auditory stimuli resulting in enhancement of certain auditory frequencies. Figure 1 shows the frequencies enhanced and suppressed as shown by our recordings of white noise made at the location of the bird's head within the magnet bore using a fiber-optic microphone (Optimic 1160, Optoacoustics). To compensate this artificial enhancement, an equalizer function is applied to each stimulus using WaveLab software. For our particular setup, the function consists of a Gaussian kernel with the following parameters: maximum amplitude: -20dB, centered on 3,750 Hz, width: 0.05 octaves (corresponding to the range 2,500-5,000 Hz for our system).\nThe song stimuli are composed of several individual song motifs of each bird interleaved with periods of silence. The duration of these silent periods is adjusted to keep the total amount of sound and silence identical over all stimuli. This construction conserves the natural intra-individual and inter-individual variability of song length. The total length of each stimulus is 16 sec. The intensity of each song is normalized in terms of matched root-mean-square and high-pass filtered at 400 Hz before being integrated into the complete stimulus (song and silent periods). These manipulations are done using Praat software.",
    "The experiment consists of an ON/OFF block design alternating auditory stimulation periods (ON blocks) with resting periods (OFF blocks) (Figure 2). Each block (ON and OFF) lasts 16 sec, which corresponds to the acquisition time of 2 images (see below for acquisition). Each stimulus type is presented 25 times, resulting in the acquisition of 50 images per stimulus and per subject. The presentation order of the conditions should be randomized within and between subjects. This randomized order of the stimuli can be coded into Presentation software.\n2. Subject Preparation\n2.1 Subject and group size\nHere we present a protocol specifically adapted to the use of (adult) zebra finches. The choice of the species depends on the scientific question. However, other considerations like bird robustness to anaesthesia may also be taken into account. Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) should be housed in aviaries under a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark photoperiod and have access to food and water ad libitum throughout the study. The minimal number of individuals per experiment is 15. This number takes into account the sensitivity of spin-echo fMRI and the natural inter-individual variability of biological phenomena measured in the experiment.\n2.2 Installation of setup and preparation of the animal\n(For specification of the used equipment, we refer to the list of specific reagents and equipment at the end of this article)\nInstall the beak mask on the MRI bed of a 7T MR system and connect it to the gas controller device with plastic tubes. Open both oxygen and nitrogen gas bottles and switch on the gas controller device (flow rate oxygen: 200 cc/min; nitrogen: 400 cc/min).",
    "As mentioned above, a 7T MR system is used in the presented setup. Other MR systems with different field strengths are also possible, but at 7T a good compromise is reached between signal-to-noise ratio and degree of susceptibility artifacts (see discussion). At higher field strengths the signal-to-noise ratio will increase together with the degree of susceptibility artifacts.\nSwitch on the feedback controlled system and warm airflow device.\nAnaesthetize the zebra finch with 3% isoflurane in a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen by introducing its beak into the mask and holding the head down until the bird is fully anesthetised. This can be verified by pulling the foot softly: when the bird is fully sedated the foot will not be retracted by the bird. In addition, the eyes of the bird will be partly closed.\nIntroduce the cloacal temperature probe to screen the body temperature and monitor the breathing rate by placing a pneumatic sensor underneath the zebra finch belly. Close the jacket to restrain the body of the bird (Figure 3).\nMaintain breathing rate within the range of 40 - 100 breaths per minute and keep body temperature constant within a narrow range of 40 ± 0.5 °C. When the breathing range is too low/high, adjust the level of anaesthesia (% isoflurane) accordingly. When the problem persists, the experiment should be stopped and the animal removed from the setup in order to recover.\nPosition the non-magnetic dynamic speakers on either side of the zebra finch head and connect them to the amplifier. Make sure that the wires of the speakers are led away from the temperature probe, because it can influence the temperature reading when too close.",
    "Place the surface RF coil on top of the zebra finch head and position the zebra finch in the center of the magnet (and automatically the center of the transmit coil which is situated in the middle of the magnet).\nReduce the anaesthesia level to 1.5% isoflurane mixed with oxygen and nitrogen.\n3. Data Acquisition\nAcquire a set of 1 sagittal, 1 horizontal and 1 coronal gradient-echo (GE) scout image (tri-pilot sequence) and sets of horizontal, coronal and sagittal multi-slice images (piloting T2-weighted rapid acquisition relaxation-enhanced (RARE) SE sequence) to determine the position of the brain in the magnet (Figure 4).\nDecrease the noise of the gradients by increasing their ramp times to 1,000 μs.\nPrepare the fMRI sequence: RARE T2-weighted sequence, effective TE: 60 msec, TR: 2,000 msec, RARE factor: 8, FOV: 16 mm, matrix size: 64 x 32, orientation: sagittal, slice thickness: 0.75 mm, Inter-slice gap thickness: 0.05 mm, 15 slices covering nearly the whole brain (Figure 4).\nSelect the auditory protocol (auditory stimuli and timing of stimulus delivery) in the presentation software. This protocol consists of a sequence of commands - for the initiation of specific auditory stimuli - which are executed at a specific scan-number. At every repetition within the fMRI sequence, the scanner software will send a trigger to the auditory presentation software which in turn registers the scan number and executes the corresponding command.\nTo ensure that the auditory presentation software does not miss any trigger from the scanner, the auditory protocol is initiated first. Once the protocol is fully loaded, the fMRI sequence is started.\nEach fMRI experiment is preceded by the acquisition of 12 dummy images to allow the signal attributed to the scanner noise to reach a steady state before starting auditory stimulation.",
    "After acquisition zero-fill the data to 64 x 64.\nTake a first (preliminary) look at the results using the Functional Tool of Paravision (option Processing/Functional Imaging). Calculate the differential BOLD response between all ON blocks and the baseline (OFF blocks). This analysis gives a first indication of the quality of the experiment. If no activation is seen in the primary auditory areas at this stage, the bird did probably not hear/processed the auditory stimuli due to technical problems with the stimulus presentation, anaesthesia level, etc. The setup should be verified and the measurement repeated.\nRun an anatomical 3D RARE T2-weighted sequence in the same orientation as the previous fMRI scans and with effective TE: 60 msec, TR: 2,000 msec, RARE factor: 8, FOV: 16 mm, matrix size: 256 x 128 x 64.\nZero-fill the data to 256 x 256 x 256.\nTake the zebra finch from the MRI bed and let it recover from anaesthesia in a cage under a red lamp. Normally, the recovery of a zebra finch after isoflurane anaesthesia goes relatively fast (maximal 5 min). After only a few minutes, the birds will try to stand up and once the bird is fully recovered, it will perch on a branch instead of sitting on the bottom of the cage. The duration of anaesthesia is about 2 hr for the present experiment. The maximum time of isoflurane anaesthesia applied to zebra finches in our lab is 6 hr, after which the birds also recovered within 5 min.\n4. Data Processing\nConvert the MR-data into Analyze or Nifti format.",
    "Because SPM has been developed to process fMRI data acquired in humans, that is for voxels of around 2 mm. Numerous SPM settings are adapted to this approximate voxel size. If one does not want to change all these settings, the simplest way to proceed is to artificially increase the voxel size of bird fMRI data. Adjust the voxel size in the header by multiplying the real voxel size by 10 using MRIcro. It should be noted, that such adjustment does not influence the data in itself, no resampling or any other modifications to the data is applied.\nAn alternative to this is the use of 'SPMMouse' which is a toolbox allowing SPM to open and analyze files of any voxel dimension. The tool allows SPM 'glass brains' to be created from any image, and automatically adjusts defaults length scales based on the headers of image files or user entered data. Hence, this toolbox works in the opposite way than what we propose. Instead of changing the voxel size of the images to fit in SPM, the default settings of SPM are changed to use images with different voxel sizes.\nRealign the fMRI data. Co-register the anatomical 3D dataset to the fMRI time series. Normalize the 3D data (and the co-registered fMRI time series) to the zebra finch brain MRI atlas. Apply the transformation matrix to the fMRI dataset. This can all be done using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) 8 software.\nSmooth the data with a 0.5-mm width Gaussian kernel using SPM8.",
    "Carry out statistical voxel-based analyses using SPM8. Model the data as a box-car (no hemodynamic response function). Estimate model parameters with the classical Restricted Maximum Likelihood algorithm. Compute the mean effect of each auditory stimulus in each subject (fixed-effect analysis) and then compute statistics as wished for group analyses (mixed-effect analyses).\nProject the statistical parametric map onto the zebra finch atlas (Figure 5) 9 in SPM8 to localize the functional activations (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required.
