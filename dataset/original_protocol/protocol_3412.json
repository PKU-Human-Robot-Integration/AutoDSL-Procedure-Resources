    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVirus packaging\nTiming: 6 days\nIn this protocol, we apply a lentivirus transduction system to transfect the sgRNA library into A375 cells.\nCritical: Working with lentivirus must be in certified Class II biological safety cabinets. The equipment used in handling lentivirus should be cleaned with a 10% bleach solution and clearly labeled and processed. Researchers must wear personal protective equipment, including lab coats, gloves, surgical masks, and goggles.\nSeed HEK293T cells into 15-cm tissue culture dishes with 20 mL of media.\nProceed to the transfection step if the cell confluence reaches 70%–80% after 16 h of incubation.\nNote: For transfection of each 15-cm dish, add 22.5 μg library plasmid, 16.9 μg psPAX2 packaging plasmid, 6.75 μg pMD2.G envelope plasmid, and 184 μL PEI in 3 mL serum-free Opti-MEM.\nMix well and incubate for 20 min at 25°C. Add the mix dropwise gently to the plated cells and swirl to disperse the mixture evenly.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2, for 6 h, and replace the media with the transfection mixture with 20 mL fresh media per plate.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 42 h.\nCollect the media from the culture and transfer to a 50 mL Falcon tube and store at 4°C.\nAdd 20 mL fresh media per plate and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nCollect the media from the culture and mix it with the media collected the day before. Filter the media through a 0.45 μm filter (PES) to remove the cells.\nConcentrate the virus with Lenti-X Concentrator according to the manufacturer’s protocol (link: https://www.takarabio.com/products/gene-function/viral-transduction/lentivirus/lentivirus-concentration[href=https://www.takarabio.com/products/gene-function/viral-transduction/lentivirus/lentivirus-concentration]).",
    "Note: We typically collect the media twice to yield around 37.5 mL of virus-containing supernatant. Add 12.5 mL Lenti-X Concentrator, mix well, and keep the tubes at 4°C for 24 h. Then, centrifuge the tubes at 1,500 g for 45 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the virus with 3.75 mL DMEM to obtain the 10 × concentrated virus.\nSplit the 10 × concentrated virus into 15-mL centrifuge tubes.\nVirus may be stored at 4°C for a few days and should be frozen at −80°C for long-term storage.\nCritical: Do not freeze and thaw the virus repeatedly, severely reducing the virus infection efficiency (see ”troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]″).\nPause point: Virus can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months without substantial loss of infection efficiency.\nLentivirus infection and MOI testing\nTiming: 4 days\nMultiplicity of infection (MOI) must be determined for each new cell line. Ensure appropriate lentivirus infection that every single cell is infected with only one sgRNA. MOI of 0.3–0.4 is an optimal condition.\nSeed human melanoma A375 cells into two 6-well plates with 1.5 × 105 cells per well.\nNote: Before the experiment, the researcher should determine the doubling time of the cell line and test the minimal dosage of puromycin to kill all the cells after 48 h of puromycin treatment.\nTogether with 5 μg/mL polybrene, add the titered virus (10 × concentrated lentivirus from Step 30) into the wells at volumes of 0 μL, 0 μL, 6.25 μL, 12.5 μL, 25 μL, 37.5 μL, 50 μL, 62.6 μL, 75 μL, 87.5 μL, 100 μL, and 125 μL.\nNote: We recommend two uninfected wells. One without puromycin is the negative control for measuring MOI. The other one with puromycin is the positive control.",
    "After incubating cells at 37°C, 5% CO2, for 24 h, change the media for all the wells.\nAdd puromycin into wells.\nMaintain the cell culture until all the cells in the well without infection are dead.\nNote: During the process, if the well without selection is confluent, split the cells into a new well and record the cell passaging ratio for MOI testing.\nCount the number of cells in the wells with or without puromycin and determine the MOI.\nNote: If the cells in the well as positive control are still alive after 48 h of puromycin selection, replace media with puromycin again and check after 24 h. If not enough cells are dying, repeat this experiment by increasing the concentration of puromycin.\nRecord the amount of virus used in Step 13 as Y.\nCRISPR-screen\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nTo obtain reliable results from the CRISPR-Cas9 screening, over 400-fold (400 x) coverage of every sgRNA is required. For example, Liu Human CRISPR Knockout Library H2 contains 92871 sgRNAs; to achieve 400 × coverage, 3.68 × 107 (92871 × 400) cells should be infected in one screen. Considering the Poisson distribution during infection, multiple surviving cells will have more than one sgRNA. Thus, the total number of A375 cells prepared for infection of MOI 0.35 is 1.247 × 108 (3.68 × 107 / (1-e−0.35)).\nMix the cells and virus into 15-cm culture plates:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3177_2.csv\nNote: The ratio of the surface area between the 15-cm plate and one well of the 6-well plate is 18. The number of 15-cm tissue culture plates used for infection is 46 (1.247 × 108 / (1.5 × 105 × 18). We also recommend setting up puromycin-selected, uninfected control and non-selected, uninfected control at this step.\nMix gently with a shaker for 10 min at 25°C.",
    "Incubate the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h, change the media, and add puromycin.\nAfter 48 h of puromycin selection, passage the infected cells into the fresh medium. With the remaining cells, freeze two pellets (one for backup) for DNA extraction as the initial population (T0) at −80°C.\nNote: Make sure the coverage of the library is always at 400 × coverage of the library. For example, Liu Human CRISPR Knockout Library H2 requires at least 3.68 × 107 cells to achieve 400 × coverage. For the Human CRISPR Metabolic Gene Knockout Library, we recommend 1,000-fold coverage.\nContinue to passage cells, maintaining the required coverage of the library at each passage.\nNote: We typically passage A375 cells every two days to ensure the cells double at least twice between passages.\nOn day 14 (about 7 passages for A375 cells), collect the cell pellets as the final population (T14) and freeze the pellets at −80°C. At the same time, seed the cells for ferroptosis induction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nCritical: Harvesting enough cells to satisfy the minimum coverage (For Human CRISPR Knockout Library H1 or H2, 400 × coverage. For Human CRISPR Metabolic Gene Knockout Library, 1,000 × coverage) is critical to avoid low coverage of the mapped reads (see ”troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]″). Thus, considering the rate of cell death, seed enough cells before the initiation of the treatment.\nTreat A375 cells with different ferroptosis-inducing conditions.\nHigh levels of ROS treatment: DMSO or 300 μM TBH for 12 h.\nGPX4 inhibitor RSL-3 treatment: DMSO or 0.75 μM RSL-3 for 5 days.\nSLC7A11 inhibitor IKE treatment: DMSO or 5 μM IKE for 7 days.\nCystine starvation (-Cys) treatment: culture cells with media containing 1 μM cystine for 5 days.",
    "Note: The treatment begins when the cells are seeded (purple line, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H). Glutamine, methionine, and cystine-deficient DMEM is supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 200 μM methionine, 1 μM cystine, and 10% FBS is the media containing 1 μM cystine.\nNote: For long-term treatment (IKE, RSL-3, and cystine starvation treatment), check the conditions of the cells every day. Change the media to prevent the perturbing of dead cells according to the timeline in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H. We recommend at least two biological repeats for every treatment to obtain reliable results. We also recommend using T14 as the only control for all ferroptosis induction groups to save labor and time (see ”troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]″).\nWhen the cells reach set time points, wash the cells with PBS and collect cells.\nNote: To eliminate the dead cells, we suggest centrifuging the cell pellets at low speed (500 g for 3 min).\nCount cells and collect the required coverage of cells. Freeze cell pellets in 50-mL centrifuge tubes at −80°C.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at −80°C for 6 months.\nPreparation for high-throughput sequencing\nTiming: 5–7 days\nTo analyze the sgRNA abundance present in each sample, genomic DNA (gDNA) is extracted from frozen cell pellets, and the sgRNA sequences are amplified by double-step PCR.\nThaw the collected samples and extract gDNA using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (link: https://www.promega.com/products/nucleic-acid-extraction/genomic-dna/wizard-genomic-dna-purification-kit[href=https://www.promega.com/products/nucleic-acid-extraction/genomic-dna/wizard-genomic-dna-purification-kit]).\nNote: During the procedures of genome DNA extraction, prolonging the centrifugation time is helpful. In theory, 1 million cells contain 6.6 μg genomic DNA. We typically obtain 220 μg genomic DNA from 3.68 × 107 cells.\nQuantitate the concentration of the extracted gDNA by NanoDrop.\nPerform the first step of the double-step sgRNA amplification PCR.",
    "Perform 96 separate 50 μL reactions with 1–4 μg genomic DNA in each reaction using Phusion Plus DNA Polymerase with the following reagents and reaction program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3177_3.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3177_4.csv\nNote: To find the best PCR condition, perform PCR reactions using titered gDNA (0.5 μg, 1 μg, 2 μg, 3 μg, 4 μg, and 5 μg) with 30 cycles of amplification step. A bright band (212 bp for Liu Human CRISPR Knockout Library and 277 bp for Human CRISPR Metabolic Gene Knockout Library) between 200 bp and 300 bp should be obtained. Choose the condition with the brightest band for further analysis. Thus, the number of reactions is not strictly 96. The results of titered PCR testing determine the number of reactions. At least 200 μg genomic DNA extracted from each sample is required for adequate coverage at this step.\nCritical: P5 is a universal forward primer for both libraries we introduced. P7-lentiCrispr V1 is used for Human CRISPR Metabolic Gene Knockout Library and P7-lentiCrispr V2 is used for Liu Human CRISPR Knockout Library.\nCombine the resulting amplicons (around 4.8 mL) in a 50-mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 480 μL 3M sodium acetate and 12 mL 100% ethanol. Then, put the tube into −80°C for 16 h.\nCritical: Avoid contact with ethanol with eyes and skin. Keep ethanol away from heat, sparks, and flame because ethanol is highly flammable.\nCentrifuge the ethanol precipitation mixture at 20,000 g for 30 min and resuspend the pellets with 400 μL Nuclease-Free Water.\nSeparate the concentrated PCR product using 1% agarose gel.\nCritical: Avoid contact with Ethidium Bromide (EB), because it can cause irritation to the skin, eyes, mouth, and upper respiratory tract. Personal protective equipment must be used when handling EB-stained gel.",
    "Extract the DNA using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit and resuspend the PCR product with 80 μL Nuclease-Free Water (link: https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/dna-clean-up/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/dna-clean-up/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit]).\nNote: This step aims to eliminate the interference of genomic DNA in the second PCR step. The PCR product is invisible in the gel. Load a positive control to ensure the gel is cut at the right place.\nSecond step of two-step sgRNA amplification PCR.\nPerform four separate 50 μL reactions with 10 μL first step PCR product in each reaction using barcoded primers with the following reagents and reaction program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3177_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3177_6.csv\nCombine the PCR product in a 1.7 mL tube and purify with the QIAquick PCR purification Kit (link: https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/dna-clean-up/qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/dna-clean-up/qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit]).\nResuspend purified DNA with 20 μL Nuclease-Free Water.\nCheck the second step PCR product by loading 1 μL purified DNA by electrophoresis.\nNote: The second step PCR product should be a single band around 281 bp for Liu Human CRISPR Knockout Library and 346 bp for Human CRISPR Metabolic Gene Knockout Library.\nDetermine the DNA concentration by Qubit dsDNA HS Assay.\nCheck DNA quality using a Bioanalyzer system.\nPool all example DNA products together with equal amounts for high-throughput sequencing.\nNote: We typically send 10 μL of pool library at 2 nM for sequencing using Illumina NextSeq 550 system.\nSequencing was conducted by Illumina NextSeq 550 system using NextSeq 75 cycle High Output Kit V2.5 in Columbia University. Reads that passed QC were analyzed with FASTQ Generation (Version: 1.0.0).\nData analysis\nTiming: 5 days",
    "MAGeCK (version 0.5.7), a commonly used pipeline, employs a sophisticated statistical model considering the inherent noise and variability in CRISPR screening data. This model-based approach helps to reduce false positives and increase the accuracy of the results. MAGeCK can also effectively distinguish true signals from background noise, making it suitable for analyzing large-scale screening datasets. For experiments involving two experimental conditions, we highly recommend using MAGeCK-RRA for the identification of essential targets from CRISPR knockout screens. MAGeCK-RRA allows researchers to assess the statistical significance of each observed change between the two states, providing valuable insights into the genes that play a crucial role in the biological processes under investigation. By comparing the gene-level effect sizes and conducting statistical tests, MAGeCK-RRA helps identify differentially essential genes, which are essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in the context of the experimental conditions. Therefore, we utilize the MAGeCK pipeline to identify the essential targets.\nDownload and back up raw sequencing FASTQ files from BaseSpace of Illumina.\n> basemount BaseSpace\n>cd BaseSpace/Projectid/sampleid/Files; i=Sample_T14\n> cat ∗_R1_00∗.fastq.gz > /data2/output/${i}_1.fastq.gz\nNote: The raw sequencing FASTQ files are automatically uploaded to our BaseSpace account, which provides 1 TB of storage. We use the BaseMount tool to efficiently move the reads from BaseSpace to our local server to access the files locally. This allows us to work with the data on our local infrastructure while releasing the storage of BaseSpace.\nDownload the Human CRISPR Metabolic Gene Knockout Library file targets 2,981 human genes with 29,790 guide RNAs (https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/sabatini-human-crispr-metabolic-knockout/[href=https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/sabatini-human-crispr-metabolic-knockout/]) as lentiCRISPR_v1_library.txt.",
    "Note: This library includes 499 negative control sgRNAs, which proves valuable for counting normalization across different time points. These negative control sgRNAs serve as a helpful baseline reference, enabling accurate comparisons and analyses of the experimental data. The library file (lentiCRISPR_v1_library.txt) consists of three essential columns: the sgRNA ID, the sgRNA sequence, and the gene it is designed to target.\nInstall MAGeCK version 0.5.7 (http://mageck.sourceforge.net[href=http://mageck.sourceforge.net]) through Anaconda platform with bioconda channel.\n> conda create -c bioconda -n mageck-vispr mageck\n> conda activate mageck-vispr\nNote: After installing Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install[href=https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install]), we recommend creating an isolated software environment for MAGeCK by executing.\nRun the MAGeCK count command to generate a count table and distribution of read counts for each sample (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3177-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

We typically compare T14 vs. T0 to obtain the effects of gene ablation, especially the common essential genes for A375 cells. Next, we further analyze the different treatments (IKE, RSL-3, TBH, or cystine starvation) vs. T14 to obtain the effects of gene ablation on ferroptosis induced under various conditions.\nTo compare MAGeCK RRA scores between replicates, we utilized the R script points_cor_sele.r (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).
