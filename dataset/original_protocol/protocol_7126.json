    "Overview:  A2780 and OAW42 cells were treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin individually and in combination with incrementing doses. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay at different stages, to estimate the degree of resistance. Development of each model was continued until the cells attained 80-90% viability at the IC50 dose of the sensitive cells. Morphological changes were observed as the cells gradually acquire resistance (representative images of an early and a late resistant stage of the Metformin-cisplatin-paclitaxel model are shown in Figure 1) (Video 3). FACS analysis was performed to assess the alteration in the cell cycle of resistant cells, whereby representative data of A2780 cisplatin resistant and A2780 paclitaxel resistant models are shown in Figure 2g and 2h. The late resistant cells showed significant increase in G0-G1 stage compared to A2780 sensitive cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4310/bioprotoc-12-03-4310-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Paclitaxel resistant models in A2780 or OAW42 cells Depending upon the proliferative rate of each cell line, seed 1 million A2780 or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in 100 mm dishes.After 24 h of seeding, treat the cells with either 60 nM (for A2780) or 1.77 µM (for OAW42) of paclitaxel for 2 h, and then replace them with 4 mL of fresh media. The selection of these exact concentrations of drug for the first treatment was determined by individual IC50 value calculated for each cell line for 72 h.Upon drug treatment, substantial cell death will be observed, which will eventually lead to individual colony formation in a few days. In our case, extensive cell death was seen for both A2780 and OAW42 cells, and individual colonies started growing after a few days. Due to the smaller size of A2780 cells, large colonies in enough numbers took 5-6 days to attain 60-70% confluence. For OAW42 cells, which are relatively larger in size, colonies started merging by three days (60-70% confluence).Trypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells in a 100 mm dish for the second treatment cycle.",
    "To mimic the clinical scenario, we avoided picking up individual clones which might bear differential molecular signature and resistance index.Apply the same dose of paclitaxel again for 2 h, followed by adding fresh media and allowing them to grow for 60-70% confluence. Again, in our case, we observed cell death and colony formation for both the cell lines.Next, trypsinize and reseed approximately 1 million cells for the third treatment cycle of the same dose and allow them to grow in fresh growth medium. Interestingly, from the third treatment cycle onwards, both A2780 and OAW42 cells showed more homogenous growth pattern.Once the cells attain 60-70% confluency, trypsinize the cells and freeze down 50% of them for future use. Reseed the remaining cells for next treatment at incremental doses as mentioned in the Table 1.Table 1. Paclitaxel concentration used for each treatment cycle in A2780 and OAW42 cells. table:",

    "At this step, seed some cells for MTT to compare their drug sensitivity to the respective sensitive (A2780 or OAW42) cells.For MTT, seed the cells in a 96-well plate at a density of 3,000 cells per well with total volume not exceeding 100 µL.Treat the cells with a range of drug concentrations and incubate the plates for 72 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.After the incubation, treat the cells with 20 µL of 5 mg/mL MTT and incubate the plate for 3 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Remove the media from each of the wells and add 100 µL of DMSO per well, to solubilize the dye.Keep the plate in a shaker and incubate for 15 min for the dye to dissolve in DMSO. Measure the absorbance of the dye at two different wavelengths (560 nm and 670 nm). Finally, measure acquirement of resistance in comparison to the IC50 dose of the respective sensitive cells.Note: Subtract the absorbance obtained at 560 nm from the absorbance obtained at 670 nm to negate the background absorbance arising from the presence of DMSO. Repeat similar treatment cycles of paclitaxel with incremental doses as mentioned in Table 1 for both A2780 and OAW42 cells.Further, perform MTT assay of the intermediate stages to validate the development of paclitaxel chemoresistance. Note: We performedthis assay at the 6th, 12th, and 13th cycles for A2780 cells, and at the 8th, 11th, and 12th cycles for OAW42 cells (Figure 2a and 2b).

    "Metformin-Cis-Pac resistant models in A2780 or OAW42 cells Type 2 diabetes is known to be associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including ovarian cancer. To better understand the role of metformin (the most commonly prescribed medicine for type 2 diabetes) intervention in acquiring chemoresistance, two different chemo-resistant models were developed in A2780 and OAW42 cells. Due to the lack of any existing study on this aspect, two different strategies were adapted:i. Sequential treatment of cells with metformin for 24 h, followed by 2 h of cisplatin-paclitaxel treatment, and,ii. Combinatorial metformin treatment along with cisplatin-paclitaxel for two hours.Sequential Metformin dual drug/Combinatorial Metformin dual drug Resistant model in A2780 and OAW42 cells Seed 1 million A2780 cells or 0.5 million OAW42 cells in a 100 mm dish.For Metformin sequential treatment Treat the cells with 2 mM metformin (IC20 concentration) for 24 h (the IC50 and IC20 concentrations of metformin were determined using MTT assay as detailed in Section A1.15 – data not shown).Upon completing the metformin pre-treatment, treat the cells with different combinations of cisplatin and paclitaxel concentrations as narrated in Table 3 for 2 h, and replace it with 4 mL of fresh media.For Metformin combinatorial treatment Treat the cells with 2 mM metformin (IC20 concentration) + Cis-Pac concentrations for 2 h, as mentioned in Table 4.Table 4. Metformin Sequential/Combinatorial drug concentration used for each treatment cycle in A2780 and OAW42 cells.

For this model, moderate cell death with homogenous growth was observed after the 1st treatment.Repeat the second treatment cycle as mentioned above depending on the model, replace the drugs with 4 mL of fresh media, and incubate the cells until they attain 60-70% confluency. Again, homogenous growth with moderate cell death was observed for both cell lines.Trypsinize the cells and freeze down 50% of the cells for future use, and re-seed the remaining cells for the next treatment cycle in a 100 mm dish.Seed some cells for MTT assay and perform MTT as described in section A1.For the successive treatment cycles, repeat the steps keeping the metformin dose constant but incrementally increasing the concentrations of Cis-Pac, as mentioned in Table 4.Repeat the successive treatment cycles for the development of MSLR and MCLR models, by keeping the metformin dose constant but incrementally increasing the concentrations of Cis-Pac, as mentioned in Table 4.Further, perform MTT assay of the intermediate stages to monitor the development of resistance in the sequential and combinatorial metformin dual drug resistant models.

    "80% cell viability was observed in the 15th stage, and d. OAW42 cells showed 77.6% cell viability in the 13th stage.APPLICATION:  The development of the abovementioned chemo-resistant models has led us to comprehend the differential modulations of various key molecules in the early vs. late stages of chemoresistance. Our study demonstrated that the early resistant (cisplatin, or paclitaxel, or Cis-Pac) cells possess upregulated insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) expression, which declines at late resistant stages (Singh et al., 2014;            Dhadve et al., 2020). The late resistant model showed high AKT activation for both the cell lines, irrespective of the nature of the drugs. Such pulsatory nature of IGF1R signaling regulates the differential level of cancer stem cell population, and their functionalities and differential autophagic flux at different stages of resistance (Singh et al., 2016;            Bishnu et al., 2021). Using these models, we have also shown the ability of metformin to act as a chemosensitizer, leading to the impediment of chemoresistance by reducing the cancer stem cell-like population (Bishnu et al., 2019). We believe that these chemo-resistant models have wide potential to study intricate molecular signatures and assess the therapeutic relevance of molecules that can be selectively targeted at different stages of chemoresistance, and can also be widely adapted to other cancer cell lines."
