    "This protocol can be used for both expression vectors: the one expressing secreted RBD as well as the one expressing a soluble, trimeric version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Expression levels of the RBD are very high in our hands (>20 mg/L culture), while expression levels for the full-length spike are lower (approximately 4 to 5 mg/L). Therefore, we use the recombinant RBD for initial screening ELISAs and the full-length spike for confirmatory ELISAs (as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.100#cpmc100-prot-0002]). The expression vector constructs were described previously (Amanat et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.100#cpmc100-bib-0001]). In brief, the sequences used for both proteins are based on the genomic sequence of the first isolate, Wuhan-Hu-1, which was released on January 10, 2020 (GenBank: MN908947.3). Sequences were codon-optimized for mammalian cell expression. The full-length spike protein sequence was modified to remove the polybasic cleavage site, which is recognized by furin, and to add a pair of stabilizing mutations (Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.100#cpmc100-fig-0002]). These two modifications were included to enhance the stability of the protein based on published literature (Amanat et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.100#cpmc100-bib-0001]). The plasmids are grown in E. coli at 37°C (or 30°C) at 225 rpm in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with ampicillin (LB-amp) in shaker flasks overnight. High-quality plasmid DNA can be obtained using commercially available maxiprep kits (ideally with an endotoxin-removal step). Importantly, other cell lines (293T, CHO, etc.), other media, transfection reagents, and more sophisticated protein purification methods might be used as alternatives if available.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b1b93d31-fdd6-47d2-890d-1b39c1b7e8a5/cpmc100-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Vector map showing the pCAGGS expression vectors. (A) Shows the plasmid map of pCAGGS containing the sequence of the stabilized, soluble spike. The schematic below indicates the signal peptide, receptor binding domain, ectodomain with stabilizing mutations, thrombin cleavage site, T4 trimerization domain, and hexahistidine-tag. (B) illustrates the pCAGGS vector encoding for the soluble receptor binding domain. The signal peptide, receptor binding domain, and hexahistidine-tag are indicated.",
    "The purpose of this protocol is to describe the procedure for measuring human antibody responses to the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein or full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and to ensure the reproducibility and consistency of the obtained results.",
    "We developed this as a two-stage ELISA in which the first stage (‘a’ steps below) includes relatively high-throughput screening of samples in a single serum dilution against the RBD (which expresses very well and therefore can be produced in greater quantities). This is followed by a second stage (‘b’ steps below) in which positive samples from the first stage undergo a confirmatory ELISA against the full-length spike protein (which is harder to express; therefore there is usually less available). For the second stage, a dilution curve is performed. Typically, if only one operator is available, screening ELISAs can be run in the morning (760 samples/10 plates per run) and confirmatory ELISAs can be run in the afternoon (140 samples/10 plates per run). Of note, we describe the assay here as it is set up in our laboratory. We use a plate washer and a plate reader, but no automated system. The protocol can be adapted to use with an automated liquid handler. In addition, one of the difficulties in setting up the assay is the availability of appropriate negative and positive controls. Negative controls are easier to come by, and can be serum pools taken before 2020. Positive controls can be convalescent samples from COVID19 patients or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) like CR3022 (ter Meulen et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.100#cpmc100-bib-0009]; Tian et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmc.100#cpmc100-bib-0010]). If no human sera or mAbs are available, mouse mAbs, mouse sera against SARS-CoV-2, other animal sera against SARS-CoV-2, or anti−His tag antibodies (the proteins are His-tagged) can be used. However, in this case, a different secondary antibody for the species from which the primary antibody is derived is needed for the positive control. Also, we recommend generating large batches of positive controls, which can be used for many runs.",
    "The positive control should be selected to result in a strong signal (recommend OD490 of about 2.0), and should be clearly distinguishable from the negative controls. ELISAs can be run with either serum or plasma.",
    "CAUTION: Before starting to work with COVID19 samples, please consult with your local biosafety officer regarding which precautions, personal protective equipment and protective measures are required.\nNOTE:"
