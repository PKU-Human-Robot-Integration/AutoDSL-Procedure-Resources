    "Maintenance culture conditions   EML cells maintenance culture conditions are IMDM with 5% HS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1x penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and 10-15% of SCF-conditioned medium (SCF-CM) obtained from BHK-MKL cells.  Note: The original cultivars of EML cells were grown in medium supplemented with rat SCF at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml (Tsai et al., 1994).   Cells should be seeded at 2 x 104 cells/ml and split to the initial dilution when a cell density of 105-2 x 105/ml (absolute maximum) is reached. This typically means splitting the cultures every 2 or sometimes 3 days. Cultures die rapidly at higher cell densities.  Note: The dead cell fraction in maintenance cultures, as judged by Trypan blue exclusion, should not exceed 5-8% (10% is acceptable if not indicative of a culture exhaustion trend.).    Cultures can be maintained for at least 20 passages post-thaw without any significant changes in biology.      Erythroid differentiation conditions   Use EML cells in logarithmic growth phase from a maintenance culture, and plate them at a seeding concentration of 2 x 104 cells/ml in fresh maintenance culture medium + recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) at a final concentration of 10 U/ml.   EML erythroid differentiation cultures are very sensitive to cell crowding, so opt for increasing culture volumes rather than initial cell densities if high numbers of cells are required.   Culture for 2 days. After this initial period, wash cells 2-3x in IMDM with 5% HS + 2 mM L-glutamine and 1x P/S, and re-seed at 2 x 104 cells/ml in IMDM, 5% HS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1x P/S, with 2.5% SCF-CM and 10 U/ml EPO.    Differentiate cells for a total of 7 days (so, 5 additional days), with fresh EPO (10 U/ml) added on day 5 to the existing culture.",
    "It is expected to observe an average 20-fold expansion in cell numbers during the culture period, with cell viability decreasing gradually as cells differentiate, to a minimum of 40-50% at day 7.    The extent of cell differentiation can be determined by flow cytometry staining with C-Kit, Sca1 and CD34, with accumulation of differentiated Sca1loCD34-C-kitlo/- cells (referred to as Kit-, see Figure 1 for representative plot) (Pina et al., 2012). It is expected that 20-30% of the culture become Kit- by day 6 of differentiation.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140610/20140610081246_7094.jpg Figure 1. Erythroid differentiation of EML cells. A representative plot of flow cytometry analysis at day 4 is shown; c-kit-CD34- cells are Sca1lo/-. In this instance, cultures were seeded at day 0 with a population of cells with culture-reconstituting (or self-renewal) potential (Pina et al., 2012).    When erythroid differentiation cultures are seeded with committed erythroid cells (e.g. sorted Sca1loCD34- cells cultured as per B1 above) (Pina et al., 2012), 60-80% of the culture are Kit- by day 4 of differentiation, reflecting faster differentiation kinetics from committed cells.    Not unexpectedly, cultures seeded with erythroid-committed cells are less proliferative, with a 10-fold expansion in cell numbers expected by day 4, after which the cultures plateau and become less viable.      Neutrophil differentiation conditions   Use EML cells in logarithmic growth phase from a maintenance culture, and plate them at a seeding concentration of 2 x 104 cells/ml in fresh maintenance culture medium + 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse IL-3 and 10 μM ATRA.   Viability is less affected by cell crowding than in erythroid differentiation, and it is thus possible to seed cultures at higher densities (0.5-1 x 105) if high cell numbers are required.",
    "After 2 days, wash cells 2-3x in IMDM with 5% HS + 2 mM L-glutamine and 1x P/S, and re-seed at 2 x 104 cells/ml in IMDM, 5% HS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1x P/S, with 2.5% SCF-CM + 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse GM-CSF and 10 μM ATRA.    Keep the culture growing for a total of 7 days (so, 5 additional days), with fresh GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) added on day 5 to the existing culture.   It is expected to observe an average 10-fold expansion in cell numbers during the culture period, with viabilities close to 80% or higher throughout the duration of the culture.    The extent of cell differentiation can be determined by flow cytometry after staining with Gr-1 and Mac-1 antibodies (Pina et al., 2012), with accumulation of granulocytic Gr1+Mac-1+ cells to an expected proportion of 40-50% by days 4-5 of culture (see Figure 2 for representative plot). Proportions can drop thereafter, although absolute numbers of differentiated cells continue to increase.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140610/20140610081518_4976.jpg Figure 2.
