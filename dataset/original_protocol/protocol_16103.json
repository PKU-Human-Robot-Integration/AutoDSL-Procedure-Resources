    "This protocol describes the procedure to prepare lines containing the desired construction. Once the promoter is defined, BsaI restriction sites are cloned on both ends of the promoter by PCR. When BsaI restriction enzyme and T4 DNA ligase are used, the promoter replaces the ccdB negative selection cassette. Agrobacterium tumefaciens competent cells are transformed, and A. thaliana ecotypes or mutants are transformed by floral dipping. T1 transformed plants are first selected on kanamycin, Basta, or hygromycin. Then, TOC64-eGFP-BLRP protein fluorescence and tissue localization are confirmed by fluorescence imaging. Although T1 hemizygous selected lines are usable for experimental work, it is recommended to propagate seeds to the T2 and T3 generations.\nMaterials\nFreely available Golden Gate construct containing ccdB negative selection cassette (for editable Golden Gate plasmids, backbone based upon pSEVA641; Chiasson et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-bib-0014])\nDB3.1 thermocompetent E. coli strain, tolerant to ccdb\nLB agar plate supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml)\nLiquid LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml)\nPlasmid extraction kit (EZNA, Omega Bio-tek, cat. no.

After obtaining the freely available Golden Gate construct containing the ccdB negative selection cassette, transform DB3.1 thermocompetent E. coli strain using 30 to 50 ng plasmid. Streak bacteria on an LB agar plate supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and allow colonies to grow overnight at 37°C. Check colonies by PCR and inoculate 5 ml liquid LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml) for pre-culture a 15-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube.

Load mix into an electroporation cuvette and set electroporator to 1.5 kV, 200 Ω resistance, and 25 µF capacitance, with a time constant of 4 ms. Quickly inoculate 650 µl liquid LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml), gentamycin (10 µg/ml), or rifampicin (25 µg/ml) in a 2-ml Eppendorf tube and let culture grow for 2 hr at 28°C in a shaking incubator. Streak on an LB agar plate supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml), gentamycin (10 µg/ml), or rifampicin (25 µg/ml). Select positive clones by colony PCR after 2 to 4 days of incubation at 28°C.",
    "9. Make a glycerol stock by mixing 700 µl overnight culture and 300 µl of 50% glycerol in a 2-ml Eppendorf tube, flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80°C.\nPlant transformation and selection of positive plants\n10. Inoculate 1 ml liquid LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml), gentamycin (10 µg/ml), or rifampicin (25 µg/ml) with a positive clone in a 2-ml Eppendorf tube. Incubate overnight at 28°C in a shaking incubator. Then, inoculate an overnight culture by pouring 1 ml pre-culture into 200 ml liquid LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml), gentamycin (10 µg/ml), or rifampicin (25 µg/ml) in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask and incubate at 28°C, 200 rpm, in a shaking incubator.\n11. Centrifuge culture in a 250-ml bottle for 30 min at 5000 × g, remove supernatant, and resuspend in 200 ml plant transformation medium.\n12. Transform desired Arabidopsis mutant or ecotype by floral dipping (e.g., in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask) for 2 min (Clough & Bent, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-bib-0016]). Cover plants with a plastic bag or a mini greenhouse dome for 2 days and keep under long-day conditions. Then, transfer plants into growth chambers under long-day conditions. Harvest T1 seeds 1 month after transformation. Store seeds at room temperature for 1 week to lift dormancy and then proceed to step 13.\n13. Select T1 plantlets on ½ MS + 0.1% sucrose medium containing the right herbicide (50 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, or 10 μg/ml Basta) for 1 week.\n14. Transfer transgenic plantlets into soil and grow under either a short-day photoperiod (SD: light 8 hr at 22°C, dark 16 hr at 17°C) or a long-day photoperiod (LD: light 16 hr at 22°C, dark 8 hr at 17°C).\n15. Confirm fluorescence and tissue localization of TOC64-eGFP-BLRP protein by imaging with a confocal microscope.",
    "The eGFP signal can be detected according to the excitation/emission wavelengths 488 nm/495 to 535 nm under a confocal microscope (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-fig-0003]).\nProtrusion on the envelope of the plastid can sometimes be observed. This is likely due to the accumulation of proteins in the envelope (Machettira et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-bib-0030]). However, it does not affect plants’ macroscopic phenotype.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a2c5f66-6df7-402d-abfd-8f0725f0b2fe/cpz1673-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nIn vivo visualization of tagged plastids. Fluorescence images of Arabidopsis mesophyll, root, and stomata cells expressing the TOC64-eGFP-BLRP fusion protein. Roots and leaves from stable transformation lines were observed by confocal laser microscopy (40× magnification, water immersion), and chloroplastic localization was confirmed using chlorophyll autofluorescence. TOC64-eGFP-BLRP construct expression is driven by the 35S constitutive promoter. Scale bars = 20 µm. Blue arrows: occasional protrusions in the envelope of mesophyll plastids.\n16. Keep positive plants and obtain T2 segregating seeds. Select plantlets on ½ MS + 0.1% sucrose medium containing the right herbicide (75% plantlets resistant) and check again by PCR and confocal imaging. Keep best T2 plants and collect T3 seeds. Select plantlets on ½ MS + 0.1% sucrose medium containing the right herbicide.\nFrom this stage, lines can be either 75% or 100% tolerant to the selection chemical.\nBoth homozygous and hemizygous plants are suited for Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-prot-0002]. No changes related to the zygosity have been observed.",
    "This protocol describes the procedure to isolate tissue-specific plastids from plants expressing TOC64-eGFP-BLRP in the desired tissue from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-prot-0001]. It is recommended to perform the experiment in a cold room set at 6°C and under a green light. When samples are collected, tissues are homogenized, and different centrifugation steps are performed to obtain a crude extract. This extract is enriched in intact plastids but still contains a high amount of contaminants. Then, the crude extract is put in contact with 2.8-µm streptavidin magnetic beads. As plastids are biotinylated, they will interact with the magnetic beads. Non-biotinylated plastids are discarded when the supernatant is discarded. Washes are performed to remove contaminants trapped on the beads. Pure, tissue-specific plastids are ready for quality control (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-prot-0003]) and further experimentation.\nMaterials\nT2 or T3 IPTACT plants (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-prot-0001])\nIsolation buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-rec-0003]; make fresh if possible; Aronsson & Jarvis, 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-bib-0001])\nHMS buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-rec-0001]; Aronsson & Jarvis, 2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-bib-0001])\nStreptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 11205D)\nCold room, ideally with green light (TL-D Colored 36W Green 1SL/25, Philips, cat. no. 928048501705)\nPlastic funnel (Nalgene PPCO Powder Funnels 65 mm diameter, Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 4252-0065)\n200-ml glass beaker\nMiracloth or 20-µm nylon mesh\nPolytron (used in our work but discontinued: Kinematica Polytron™ PT 10/35 Homogenizer with PCU-11 Controller; available online: Kinematica Polytron™ PT 2500 E, Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10785812)\n50-ml plastic beaker\nRefrigerated centrifuge (Beckman Avanti J-20XP, GMI, cat. no. 8043-30-1171), 4°C\n50-ml polycarbonate centrifugation tubes (29 × 104 mm; Beckman Coulter, cat. no. 363647)\nPaint brush\n2-ml Eppendorf tubes\nVortex (Vortex Genie2 120V, Stellar Scientific, cat. no.

    "1. Transfer T2 or T3 IPTACT plants to darkness the day prior to extraction.\nOne can also perform the experiment before the beginning of the photoperiod.\nThis step prevents accumulation of starch that could damage plastids during isolation.\n2. Pre-cool buffers and equipment by leaving them in a cold room (set at 6°C) the day prior to isolation.\nRecommended: Perform the whole experiment under green light. As reported in Oikawa et al. (2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-bib-0035]), peroxisomes and plastids seem to strongly interact under white light, ultimately leading to contamination. Green light leads to better results.\n3. Install a plastic funnel on a 200-ml glass beaker and place Miracloth or 20-µm nylon mesh on funnel.\n4. Pre-wet another piece of Miracloth or mesh with isolation buffer and create a “pillow” of isolation buffer in the 200-ml glass beaker.\n5. Collect plant material in the early morning in the cold room.\nAs an example, this protocol has been performed with 1 g rosette or 0.7 g of 3-day-old plantlets (∼0.4 g seeds).\n6. Homogenize plants using a polytron (speed of 4 out of 11 (∼40%), 2-s pulses, repeat four times) in 20 ml isolation buffer in a 50-ml plastic beaker.\nPulses lead to less risk of damaging the sample by overheating.\n7. Filter homogenate through the double layer of Miracloth or 20-µm nylon mesh prepared in steps 3 and 4.\n8. Homogenize debris retained in the Miracloth in 20 ml isolation buffer and filter two times.\n9. Centrifuge homogenate in a 50-ml polycarbonate centrifugation tube for 5 min at 1000 × g, 4°C.\n10. Discard supernatant and gently resuspend pellet in 20 ml HMS buffer using a paint brush.\n11. Repeat step 9.\nIt is also possible to skip steps 10 and 11, but it will be at the cost of purity.",
    "12. Remove supernatant and gently resuspend pellet in 4 ml HMS buffer using a brush, obtaining the crude extract, and transfer to 2-ml Eppendorf tubes.\nMake sure the pellet is fully resuspended. Clumps will result in strong contamination, as they get trapped between the beads.\nPreparation of magnetic beads\n13. Vortex vial with streptavidin magnetic beads for 30 s for resuspension.\nFor IPTACT, it is recommended to use 2.8-µm magnetic beads (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-fig-0004]). Although they bind to plastids, 1-µm magnetic beads lead to strong contamination.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/38732c99-2aa0-499f-9aae-1c7ffbb5fb56/cpz1673-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nBead size's effect on IPTACT. A total of 5 μl crude extract (C.E) and 5 μl purified biotinylated plastids from shoots using either 1- or 2.8-μm beads were immunoblotted with anti-LHCB1, anti-HIS3, and anti-GDC-H to observe plastid enrichment and nuclear/mitochondrial contamination. Asterisks (*) indicate contamination in the IPTACT assay.\n14. Aliquot 30 µl beads into a 2-ml Eppendorf tube.\nA higher bead volume can be used. However, contamination is more frequently observed when >50 µl beads are used.\n15. Add 1 volume (30 µl) of HMS buffer and gently resuspend beads by pipetting until the solution is homogeneous.\n16. Separate beads with a magnet for 1 min.\n17. Discard supernatant and rinse with HMS buffer (twice the bead volume, i.e., 60 µl here). Repeat three times total.\n18. Discard supernatant and finally resuspend beads with 30 µl HMS buffer.\nThe beads are now ready to be used.\nTissue-specific plastid isolation\n19. Mix 1.7 ml crude extract (step 12) with magnetic beads (step 18).\n20. Hold tube, with a closed cap, with index finger and thumb or tweezers and invert tube for 1 min, making sure that the sample does not warm up.\nMixing should be gentle (the air bubble should slide from one side to another in ∼1 s).",
    "It is not recommended to use a rotating wheel or to resuspend by pipetting, as this damages plastids.\n21. Place tube upright on a stand (e.g., a tube rack) and apply magnet (the magnet should touch the tube). Separate beads with the magnet for 2 min and gently collect supernatant by pipetting.\nThe supernatant can be used a few times with a new batch of beads (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-fig-0005]). To collect the supernatant and reuse it, cut tips should be employed.\nIn the case of chloroplast isolation, the beads should turn green.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e0a002ac-660b-4e56-a403-6e2ec24ce582/cpz1673-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nBead saturation controls. A single 35S crude extract (C.E) was incubated with three different batches of streptavidin beads, one after another. Immunoblotting using anti-RBCL and anti-IDH antibodies was performed with 10 μl crude extract and 10 μl IPTACT-purified samples.\n22. Resuspend beads in 800 µl HMS buffer by manual inversion and apply magnet for 1 min.\n23. Discard supernatant and repeat step 22 four times.\nThis makes five washing steps in total.\nContrary to IMTACT, where the supernatant turns transparent after four washes, there is no visual indication of when to stop the washing steps for IPTACT. Performing five washes is the consensus, but, depending on the purity/integrity ratio expected, the user can go either down to three washes or up to seven washes.\n24. Gently resuspend beads in 80 µl HMS buffer and store on ice (or freeze at −80°C) until further use (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-prot-0003]).\nDepending on the upcoming experiment, the resuspension volume can be adjusted.",
    "After obtaining plastids bound to beads (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-prot-0002]), it is necessary to assess the quality of the extraction. It is highly probable that the user will obtain tissue-specific plastids at this stage, but purity and integrity need to be determined. Therefore, using one IPTACT extract, a set of experiments is proposed in this protocol. First, protein concentration is estimated, as there is a linear correlation between the number of plastids isolated and the protein content. Then, IPTACT samples are checked on immunoblots using antibodies directed against (i) the plastid's envelope and stroma and (ii) other cell compartments. This protocol defines the purity level of the samples. Finally, the integrity of the samples is assessed by observation under a confocal microscope.\nMaterials\nIsolated plastids coupled to beads (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-prot-0002])\nHypotonic buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-rec-0002]), for plastid bursting (Bag, Schroder, Jansson, & Farci, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-bib-0002])\nBradford reagent (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 5000006)\n2× Laemmli buffer (supplemented with 200 mM DTT; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-rec-0004])\nCrude extract (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-prot-0002], step 12)\nAntibodies raised against plastids, mitochondria, and nucleus:\n               \nAnti-plastid stroma antibody (e.g., α-RBCL, Agrisera, cat. no.

Use supernatant and Bradford reagent to perform a Bradford assay.\nProtein quantity depends on the tissue from which plastids are extracted. From 1 g leaves and 30 µl beads, the user can expect ∼35 µg and ∼15 µg plastid mesophyll and companion cell proteins, respectively.

Perform a western blot on the IPTACT samples and an aliquot of the crude extract using antibodies raised against plastids, mitochondria, and nucleus and, optionally, antibodies raised against other cell compartments.\nFor the first time the user performs this protocol, it is recommended that they also perform immunoblots directed against the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, cytosol, and vacuoles (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-fig-0006]). Peroxisomal and cytoplasmic contamination are the most often seen.\nImmunoblots are necessary to assess the purity of the samples by checking the level of contamination from other subcellular compartments. Additionally, a quick assessment of integrity can be performed by checking the plastid stroma/envelope ratio. The number of controls can be adjusted. For example, if RNA extraction is the next step, it would be useful to perform immunoblots against plastids, mitochondria, and nucleus (i.e., genetic compartments).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e5845836-1d9d-4453-9eb8-6266e5480913/cpz1673-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",
    "Immunoblot controls for plastids purified by IPTACT. A total of 10 μl crude extract (C.E; 6 μg) and 10 μl purified biotinylated plastids (3 μg) from shoots were immunoblotted with (A) anti-RBCL, anti-LHCB1, and anti-TOC34 to observe plastid enrichment; (B) anti-IDH and anti-HIS3 to check for mitochondrial and nuclear contamination, respectively; and (C) anti-SEC12, anti-CAT, anti-UGPase, and anti-ɣTIP to check for contamination with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisomal, cytoplasmic, and vacuolar proteins, respectively. Asterisks (*) indicate contamination. (D) Plastid stroma/envelope ratio in C.E (normalized to 1) and the IPTACT sample.\nMicroscopy integrity assessment\n8. Aliquot 1 µl for confocal microscopy of IPTACT samples.\n9. Under a confocal microscope, detect signals according to the following excitation/emission wavelengths: eGFP (488 nm/495 to 535 nm) and chloroplast autofluorescence (633 nm/660 to 720 nm). Analyze images using ImageJ software.\nNote that bead autofluorescence is observed for these wavelengths.\nThe user should observe plastids decorated with 1 to 5 beads (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.673#cpz1673-fig-0007]).\nScanning/transmitted electron microscopy is recommended to have a better understanding of the plastid size distribution and integrity. However, as this step usually requires a specialized platform, the protocol will not be detailed here.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a0ee150a-6b42-4aaa-ad56-887e9063d407/cpz1673-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nConfocal imaging of a chloroplast isolated by IPTACT. Fluorescence images of Arabidopsis plastids expressing the TOC64-eGFP-BLRP fusion protein. Plastids were isolated from leaves from stable transformation lines and were observed by confocal microscopy (40× magnification, water immersion). Co-localization was assessed using chlorophyll autofluorescence, and transmitted light was used to observe beads coupled to plastids. TOC64-eGFP-BLRP construct expression is driven by the 35S constitutive promoter. Scale bar = 5 µm."
