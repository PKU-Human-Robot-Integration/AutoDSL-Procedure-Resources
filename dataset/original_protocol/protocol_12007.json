    "All animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) and Stanford University's Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC), (Protocol number #10266) and in the United States, or the European Animal Welfare Act, Directive 2010/63/EU. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Government of Bavaria, Germany, and received the permission No: 55.2-1-54-2532-150-2015.\n1. Animal Preparation\nPrepare an empty cage with appropriate bedding on a heating pad.\nPrior to touching animals with gloves, rub the mother's bedding onto the gloves.\nRemove all pups from their mother and place into the empty cage. Remove some of the mother's bedding and place it in the empty cage with the pups.\nPlace the mother in a separate, clean, dry cage away from the surgical field.\nDon new, clean sterile gloves prior to surgical field preparation. \n2. Surgical Field Preparation\nUsing a 10-mL pipette, add 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a 10-cm Petri dish.\nPipette 2 mL of betadine or equivalent anti-septic solution in the 10-cm Petri dish.\nPlace a dissecting scope on the surgical field. Turn on dissecting scope lamp and adjust the level of light to the surgeon's comfort. A pup can be placed in the surgical field underneath the dissecting scope lamp. Adequate light can be confirmed by the absence of shadows on the ventral surface of the pup.\nPrepare the isoflurane anesthesia chamber (see Table of Materials) with a nose cone. The chamber should be cleaned without evidence of urine or feces. Place the nose cone and associated tubing under the dissecting scope in the surgical field. Divert the flow of oxygen and isoflurane solely to the nose cone.",
    "Prepare a post-operative recovery area with a heating pad set at approximately 37 °C. The post-operative recovery should consist of 4 pieces of gauze placed on top of the heating pad. If possible, rub gauze pads in the mother's bedding, feces, and urine to preserve the mother's scent.\n\tNOTE: It is ill-advised to use a heat lamp, as this makes it difficult to control the temperature. Elevated temperatures will result in the death of neonatal mice.\nPrepare and sterilize all surgical instruments with an autoclave. The tools needed include: micro-dissecting scissors, micro-dissecting forceps, gauze, hemostat, and any 6-0 monofilament non-absorbable suture. Surgical instruments can be resterilzed with any glass bead sterilizer. \n3. Partial Lobular Hepatectomy\nAnesthetize the pup by placing it in the nose cone on its back and gently taping its feet and hands in place. The pup should be receiving 5% isoflurane in oxygen.\n\t\nAllow the pup to sit for 5 min or until adequately anesthetized, which can be verified by a toe pinch test.\nInject 5 mg/kg of carprofen subcutaneously prior to incision.\n\t\tNOTE: The entire surgery should take no longer than 30 min. Poorer outcomes may be observed in neonates that are under general anesthesia for over 30 min. Take precautions to minimize the length of surgery through thorough field preparation and wetting of the skin prior to closure to minimize suture induced skin tears.\nGently clean off the posterior abdominal wall with a small gauze pad wet with betadine. Allow the betadine to dry for 1 min.\nMake a left mid-clavicular 0.5 cm incision immediately below the rib cage with the micro-dissecting scissors and forceps. Gently separate the skin using forceps and make a second deeper incision into the peritoneal cavity (See Figure 1C, left and center)",
    "Gently apply lateral pressure from both sides of the abdomen using the back, blunt ends of the micro-dissecting scissors and forceps to force the apex of the left lobe out of the peritoneal cavity. The left apex of the left lobe should be easily visualized (Figure 1C, right).\nFrom the apex, amputate and weigh the amount of tissue to be removed.\nUsing the micro-dissection scissors, gently amputate the desired amount of tissue from the apex of the left lobe.\nPlace the amputated tissue into a 1.5-mL tube filled with PBS. Weigh the amputated tissue using an analytical balance (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Place a piece of gauze or paper on the balance and tare it. Then place the amputated tissue on the gauze or paper and measure its mass.\nFix the amputated area in 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h and place in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound over dry ice for frozen section analysis. Analyze frozen sections by cutting 7-10 µm sections using any standard cryostat.\nUsing a rolled piece of gauze, gently replace the left lobe into the peritoneal cavity. Leave the gauze in the cavity until the bleeding stops.\nRemove the gauze and wet the surgical site and the surrounding area with gauze soaked with PBS.\nClose the surgical site with 6-0 monofilament, non-absorbable sutures with a running stitch. The peritoneum and skin should be closed separately.\n\tNOTE: Gently wetting the skin with gauze soaked with PBS may minimize suture induced tears.\nGently but thoroughly clean the pup with gauze soaked with PBS and ensure no blood or betadine remains. Roll the soaked gauze pad and gently scrub over the wound sign to clean off any blood or betadine.",
    "NOTE: This is especially important as the mother may cannibalize the pups if they are cleaned inadequately.\nRemove the pup from the nose cone and place it on the recovery area that includes the gauze pads exposed to the mother's feces and urine. Once the pup recovers, replace the pup in the empty cage with the mother's bedding.\n\tNOTE: Do not use a heat lamp. The use of a heat lamp can cause the neonate to overheat.\nRepeat the procedure on the desired number of pups. Although all pups can be used, it is generally advisable to leave a few pups not operated on to be replaced together with the operated pups.\nReplace all pups simultaneously with their mother's bedding in the mother's cage.\n4. Recovery and Analysis\nFollow up on the mice daily.\nCheck that the wound remains closed and remove any dead pups, if present.\nIf the wound reopens, prepare the surgical site and recovery area as previously described, and repeat steps 3.8 to 3.12.\nInject 5 mg/kg of carpofen subcutaneously 24 and 48 h following the procedure.\nFollow Pups for 56 days or more.\nEuthanize the animals after the desired amount of post-operative days by carbon dioxide (CO2) exposure and cervical dislocation.\n\t\nPlace mice in the induction / euthanasia chamber and turn on the CO2 until mice stop breathing.\nEnsure euthanasia by cervical dislocation. Push down on the dorsal neck of the mouse using the fore-finger and thumb and using the other hand, pull down on tail.\nRemove the entire liver en bloc and weigh it.\nCarefully separate each lobe and weigh separately.\n\t\tNOTE: Remove the liver by careful dissection of the diaphragm and hepatic and portal vessels. Separate the lobes from each other by carefully dissecting each lobe at its proximal attachment.",
    "Determine the extent of regeneration by comparing the mass of the amputated left lobe to the mass of the whole liver. An uninjured left lobe is approximately 30% of the whole liver.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
