    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Xi’an Jiaotong University (No. XJTULAC2019-1023).\n1. Mice appendectomy\nHouse 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice in a certified specific-pathogen free (SPF) environment for 1 week prior to surgery.\nPrepare the following sterile surgical instruments: one pair of micro-scissors, one pair of micro-forceps, two sizes (4-0 and 8-0) of sterilized non-absorbable sutures, an electric coagulation pen with needle holder, 75% medical alcohol, iodine-based scrub (e.g., entoiodine), and a package of sterile cotton swabs.\nFill a 10 mL syringe with pre-warmed 0.9% physiological saline for the abdominal flush and hydration during surgery.\nAnesthetize a non-fasted mouse intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1% sodium pentobarbital at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Check for the depth of anesthesia by the lack of response to pedal reflexes.\n\tNOTE: A single anesthetic dose is administered to ensure a full sedative effect in the mouse. Under the circumstance of short procedures, 50 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital i.p. may be sufficient.\nGently shave the abdominal hair with an electric shaver.\nLay the mouse on the heating pad to prevent hypothermia.\nSecure the mouse on a platform in a supine position by placing four strips of medical adhesive tape across the limbs to prevent postural movement during the surgery.\nGently touch the whole abdomen to find the feeling of a bump.\n\tNOTE: In most cases, the feeling of a bump always indicates the exact position of the caecum. To avoid possible damage to the rest of the intestine, this pre-locating of the caecum prior to abdominal incision is important.\nCover with a sterile drape and disinfect the shaved area of the abdomen by applying alternating surgical scrubs of iodine-based solution and 75% alcohol. Repeat the process 2x.",
    "Make a longitudinal incision ranging from 0.5–1.0 cm at the midline of the abdomen.\nAccording to the pre-determined location of the caecum, reach the caecum and gently exteriorize (~1 cm) to identify the caecal patch. Use a sterile, prewarmed saline solution of physiological pH to hydrate the intestine.\n\tNOTE: The caecal patch of a mouse is part of the caecum and characterized by the presence of white ovoid follicles on the surface.\nTo prevent potential complications of the post-operative bleeding and infection, ligate the mesenteric blood vessels of the caecum using the 8-0 suture. Hydrate the caecum with sterile saline.\nMark the resection region using the 4-0 suture with an open loop near the apex of the caecum at the proximal colon.\n\tNOTE: Marking the caecum with an open loop also prevents leakage of caecal content from the cut.\nCut off the caecal patch below the marked resection using micro-scissors and wipe out the residual caecal content with medical cotton swabs. Then, disinfect the stump of caecum with iodine-based scrub.\nClose the stump with the running suture using the 8-0 suture.\nCarefully remove the 4-0 thread loop previously used for marking the resection at the stump of the caecum.\nSterilize the sutured position with iodine-based scrub. Rehydrate the surgical site with saline again.\nClose the musculature layer with the running suture using 8-0 suture thread.\nClose the skin layers using interrupted sutures with 4-0 suture thread.\nDisinfect the surgical cut 2x with iodine-based scrub, then remove iodine using 75% medical alcohol.\nGently flip the mouse back, subcutaneously (s.c.) inject 0.1 mg/kg body weight of buprenorphine and 0.4 mL of physiological saline and let the mouse rest on the heat pad until returning to consciousness.",
    "Put the mouse back to the sterile cage and closely monitor for signs of pain for 3 days post-surgery to ensure recovery.\n\tNOTE: Post-operative application of 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine may be needed for pain relief of the individual mouse. Allow mice to recover for 7 days after surgery for further induction of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.\n2. Induction of chronic colitis-associated colorectal cancer with AOM and DSS\nNOTE: Perform this procedure 7 days post-appendectomy.\nPrepare AOM stock solution by dissolving 25 mg of AOM in 2.5 mL of 0.9% sterile saline at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.\n\tNOTE: AOM is light-sensitive.\n\t\nAliquot 2.5 mL of prepared AOM stock solution into 5 mL glass tubes wrapped with aluminum foil and store at -20 ˚C each time upon use.\nThaw one aliquot of AOM once and dilute it to a concentration of 1 mg/mL with 0.9% sterile saline (ratio 1:10).\n\t\tCAUTION: AOM is extremely carcinogenic; hence, perform the entire preparation procedure in a fume hood.\nDissolve 4 g of DSS powder in 200 mL of autoclaved water to prepare 2% (w/v) DSS solution.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of DSS may vary depending on the mouse strain, sex, and induction cycle; 3% DSS may be used for other mice strains.\nSimultaneously administer the freshly prepared AOM/DSS to the mice. To do so, follow the steps below.\n\t\nIntraperitoneally inject 0.01 mL/g of freshly prepared AOM working solution for each mouse and replace the autoclaved water with 2% DSS solution for 5 days ad libitum.\n\t\tNOTE: Each cage contains five mice; regularly check the DSS drinking bottle to ensure no precipitate occurs during the treatment period.\nWeight and closely monitor each mouse every day.",
    "NOTE: During the administration, euthanize mice with up to 20% weight loss compared to its initial weight or signs of the huddle, squint, hypothermia, and poor activity.\nProvide a fresh bottle of autoclaved water on the day 6 post-AOM/DSS administration until day 21 (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: This is one complete cycle comprising of 21 days.\nRepeat steps 2.3–2.4 for an additional two cycles and sacrifice the mice on day 70.\n3. Assessment of colonic inflammation and tumor (70 days post-AOM administration)\nSacrifice the mice by CO2 inhalation at a fill rate of 10% in the euthanasia chamber followed by cervical dislocation.\nHarvest the entire colon from above the ileo-colic junction to the anus.\nExpose the lumen side by opening the colon longitudinally. Cut the whole colon into 10 cm long pieces and fix the colon tissue in 10% formalin for 72 h for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.\nSubscription Required.
