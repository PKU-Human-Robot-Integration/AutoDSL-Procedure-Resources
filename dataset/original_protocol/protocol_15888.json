    "CRISPR engineering of endogenous cellular proteins requires the construction of a targeting vector that encodes an RNA (the guide RNA) that is complementary to a 20-base-pair (bp) section of the chromosome. A homologous recombination region should span the sequence (target sequence) that the user wishes to target for cleavage and gene modification (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0003]). A CRISPR targeting plasmid (we used pX459 v2.0) also includes a gene for an endonuclease, Cas9, that forms a complex with the transcribed guide RNA and acts at the target site to cut the chromosome (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0003]). The wild-type Cas9 enzyme catalyzes a double-stranded break, so only one targeting construct is needed to completely cleave the chromosome at the target location (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0003]). This will serve as the site for the introduction of your linearized donor DNA by your chosen guard RNA (gRNA; Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0003]). If greater specificity is needed, a mutant enzyme can be chosen (in conjunction with a related targeting vector, pX462 v2.0) that creates only a single-strand nick in the chromosome (often called a Cas9 nickase), which requires using two closely spaced targets on opposite strands of the chromosome. We used the wild-type Cas9 enzyme for all of our lines because it, predictably, gave us better efficiency than the nickase method. To date, we have not used the mutant endonuclease to prepare our lines and have not noticed second-site problems. although these could be admittedly difficult to detect.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e6136399-7ded-48d0-acbb-58d7f76fc6e0/cpz1965-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Use the “Gene” search at NCBI to find the genomic view of your gene of interest. For human MCAK/Kif2C, we find https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11004[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11004].\nThe section labeled “Genomic regions, transcripts and products” is most useful for planning the CRISPR construct. This displays the gene aligned to the full sequence for that chromosome (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0003]). Dark green wider bars are exons, light green wider bars are 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), and thin bars with arrowheads in the middle are introns. The blue labels (e.g., NM_006845.3) can be copied to another NCBI window and used to search for a Nucleotide file showing the mRNA, if needed.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/nm_006845.3[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/nm_006845.3]",

This is usually the easiest method for selecting a region.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/49c65ed7-2cc6-4135-83a3-d6dfc9013512/cpz1965-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nDetailed diagram of the NCBI Gene view operations to modify MCAK/Kif2C.

    "The start codon of MCAK/Kif2C is at about position 44,739,850 on chromosome 1, so the region from ∼44,739 to ∼44,741 K was chosen (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0004]).

This should download a text file containing the highlighted region of the chromosome. Both the file name and the first line of text in this file will include the exact chromosomal coordinates that were selected (in the case of MCAK/Kif2C: 44737974-44741954), which you may want to record for future reference.\n3. Copy the DNA sequence text from the file in step 2 to your preferred DNA sequence analysis program, so that you now have ∼2000 bp of genomic sequence in a file you can manipulate. Return to the NCBI window, center the start of the mRNA, and zoom up to the 95% or 100% level so that you can see the actual nucleotide sequence around the start codon. Make a note of ∼10 bp that include the start site (purple arrow in Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0004]), and then search the genomic sequence file for this and mark the start codon.\nYou may want to similarly locate and mark the 3′ end of the first exon (and both ends of any other exons that were in the range you copied in step 2) so that your file is annotated with this information, although unless the first exon is very short (less than ∼100 bp) you probably will not absolutely need to have these regions marked. The region saved in this file will be somewhat longer than your actual recombination template designed in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0004]. This will be useful when designing the analytical PCR primers in Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0005].",
    "These plasmids will cleave the chromosome at your chosen target site (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005]). The broad goal is to use a predictive algorithm (such as CRISPRdirect) to locate target sequences and predict the number of off-target sites found in the genome (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005]). Different optimal-appearing target sites will operate at different efficiencies. For this reason it is advisable to choose three or four putative target sites and test their efficiencies in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0003]. To do this you will need to synthesize the oligos for each site, and clone pairs of them into the Bbs1 sites (positions 252 and 260) of your cloning vector (pX459; Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005]). These three or four vectors will code for the three or four guide RNAs you would like to test. Each vector will direct to a slightly different target site (with likely different cutting efficiencies) as defined by your chosen oligos. We typically make three or four different targeting plasmids, in case some are more effective than others. An oligonucleotide with the target + sticky ends is purchased for each sgRNA desired and of course a complementary strand to that oligo to form a small double-stranded piece of DNA for ligation (Fig. 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005]). We have not found it necessary to have these oligos purified because they are so short; the crude oligo will contain enough full-length product to perform successfully.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cc6b34d0-d02c-456e-acaa-efc3b680f90a/cpz1965-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

Choose one or more target sequences to create in CRISPR targeting vectors. Try to select those with fewer 12-mer and 8-mer target sites. If you plan to use the wild-type Cas9 (in pX459), only one target sequence will be needed (although trying several different targets is one of the easiest parts of the process, and may increase your chances of success). Putative targets can be located on either the plus or minus strand of your chromosomal sequence.",
    "4. Design and order oligos for targeting vectors as shown in Figure 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005] (refer to Fig. 5E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005] for examples from MCAK/Kif2C). Do not include the PAM sequence (shown in the box in Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005], third column) as part of the oligo.\nThe output in Figure 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005] will show the same “strandedness” as the sequence you entered, regardless of whether the target site found is actually located on that strand or the complementary strand. Note that if your target is on the plus strand (as shown in the second column of the graphic in Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005]), the sequence for the XXXX… region of the “Top strand oligo” as in Figure 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005] will simply be the sequence shown in the third column of the output shown in Figure 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005], so that you can copy and paste the sequence into your sequence analysis program, and then add on the 5′ extension for the sticky end. The same sequence can be reverse-complemented to generate the YYYY… as shown in Figure 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005] for the bottom-strand oligo, and its sticky-end 5′ and 3′ bases added. On the other hand, if the target is on the minus strand, copy the sequence from the CRISPRdirect output (again, column 3), put it into your sequence analysis software, and then convert it to the reverse complement. This is now the XXXX… sequence for the top-strand oligo for that clone. Reverse-complement it again to get the YYYY… region for the “bottom strand oligo.” Careful reference to the MCAK target sequences in Figure 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005] and the MCAK targeting oligos in Figure 5E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0005] should make this potentially confusing situation clearer.\n5. Have the oligos synthesized (we use IDTdna.com) and also order primer pXforward (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-tbl-0001]): GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATTCCTT for sequencing the vector.

    "When choosing a precise location to which to target your recombination event using predictive algorithms such as CRISPRdirect, you are likely to have several choices of reasonable locations to choose from. Certain sites will be more efficient at producing recombinants than others, often for unknown reasons. Thus, it is useful to empirically test likely sites before settling on a final recombination site. This protocol describes how to choose a target site within your target region by empirically testing them for efficiency using a simple visual microscope assay.\nThis protocol requires the purchase of two additional oligos (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-tbl-0001]) that contain the genomic sequence of only the region sufficient to contain all of the sgRNAs, plus sticky ends for different enzymes found in a vector called pCAG-EgxxFP (https://www.addgene.org/50716/[href=https://www.addgene.org/50716/]). This vector contains a direct repeat of two copies of GFP, one lacking the 3′ end of the gene and the other lacking the 5′ end of the gene, with several cloning sites in between them. The test oligos (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-tbl-0001]) corresponding to the entire targeted genomic region (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0006]) are cloned between the two copies of GFP (Fig. 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0006]). Because these oligos are long, typically 50 to 70 bp, we have ordered them gel-purified because the crude oligo would probably contain a fairly low fraction of full-length product and therefore perform poorly in a ligation reaction. Alternately, they could be assembled from four or more shorter, overlapping oligos.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4f1fcc2c-0c8d-414f-b1d2-36ec2da09897/cpz1965-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",

In the presence of a functional CRISPR targeting plasmid (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0003]), however, the cleavage of the targeted genomic sequence will generate an increased rate of recombination and an increased number of green cells, which can validate which of several targeting vectors is likely to be the most successful in generating an actual CRISPR cell line (Fig. 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0006]). Use of this EGFP recombination test (which takes only a couple of days) is not required, but we found it to be reassuring before investing the time (2 to 3 months) required to perform a CRISPR cell line construction. Our successful MCAK CRISPR cell line was derived from a transfection with the targeting plasmid (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0003]) engineered from the successful protospacers (gRNA sense and antisense for MCAK/Kif2C, Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-tbl-0001]) that scored the best in this assay.",

    "If the test region is longer than ∼70 bp, a single oligo duplex may be impractical. In that case, ordering several overlapping oligo duplexes might be required. Alternatively, one could simply order the piece of DNA as a synthetic DNA plasmid insert (e.g., from BioBasic, as with the recombination template), which would not be much more expensive when the labor cost of cloning and sequencing the oligo clones is accounted for. Of course, in that case the restriction site at each end must be complete and functional, not crippled as in the EcoRI site described above, because you will then need to subclone the synthetic DNA from the plasmid supplied by BioBasic into pCAG-EgxxFP. If the test sequence does not naturally contain a site useful for screening clones, a third unique restriction site between one of the cloning sites and the actual test sequence could be included in the design, or you could simply screen for loss of other sites in the polylinker of pCAG-EgxxFP.",

    "We use a Lonza nucleofector II for cell transfection, which calls for a maximum of 5 µg of DNA per transfection. It is formally possible to use other methods of transfection, but because recombinants are often rare events, it is advisable to use the most efficient transfection method you can find. In our hands nucleofection transfects more cells than lipofection. If you have a different model of Lonza nucleofector, you will have to consult the manufacturer's suggestions to replicate these conditions. The Lonza nucleofector II will reasonably handle a maximum transfection volume of 1 million cells per 100-µl cuvette.\n6. Check dishes every 24 hr and replace with puromycin-free medium when significant cell death (floating cells) is observed.\n7. Count green cells in a few fields of a fluorescence microscope.

These plasmids are likely to produce recombinants with the greatest efficiency.\nEffective CRISPR targeting plasmids should give obvious increases in the number and probably also brightness of green cells. Not every targeting site (sgRNA) will give equal increases in recombination, which is why it is good to choose several sequences to test in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0002], step 3. Use the targeting plasmid that scores the highest number of green cells in this protocol in Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0006], step 2.",
    "The recombination template DNA should possess regions that correspond closely to the genomic sequence outside any experimental insertions or mutations being made. Linearly speaking, from 5′ to 3′, it will consist of some homologous sequence 5′ to the start codon of your gene of interest (∼700 bp) and then DNA coding for a marker (such as GFP) that will contribute the new start codon for your protein of interest if you are modifying the N-terminus, followed by an in-frame linker, DNA coding for FKBP, a longer in-frame linker, and finally the DNA sequence coding for (in the case of MCAK/Kif2C) the expressed N-terminus (first exon) of your gene of interest and the following intron (∼700 bp). An example of a successful homologous recombination donor template used to engineer endogenous GFP-FKBP-MCAK/Kif2C is shown in Figure 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0007]. It is important to alter the sequence of the template to disrupt remaining CRISPR targeting sites or else the template DNA itself will be cleaved by the CRISPR targeting construct. If this occurs, the potential for generating the desired recombinant chromosome will be destroyed. CRISPR targeting sites are shown in Figure 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0007] and their positions indicated in the donor template sequence (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0007]). One simple way to disrupt the remaining CRISPR targeting sites is to alter the PAM so that it no longer contains the GG dinucleotide, by replacing one or both Gs with any other base through silent mutation. Base-pairing of the sgRNA targeting sequence within the 20-mer chosen can also be altered by silent mutations. Thus, the recombination construct (other than inserted regions) will almost completely match the genomic DNA sequence. However, in the region corresponding to the targeting locations, it must contain at least one nucleotide that does not match the genomic sequence.",
    "For example, if you are constructing a fusion protein and the sgRNA targeting sequence contains either the start codon or the stop codon (a “stop” of course will be deleted to create a fusion), the addition of the fusion protein sequence will disrupt the sgRNA targeting sequence and may make other alterations unnecessary. An example of this is shown in Figure 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0007], wherein three PAM sequences whose sgRNAs do not significantly overlap the start codon are altered, while a fourth PAM very close to the start codon is left unchanged because the homology in that region will already be disrupted by the newly introduced linker sequences. If you are in doubt, you may still want to disrupt the PAM sequence or the target near the PAM if possible, just to be sure that it will not be used for cleavage. Compare the sequence of the first few base pairs of the MCAK recombination template (the target region) from Figure 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0006], ATGGCaA, with the corresponding sequence from successful MCAK CRISPR targeting vector 1+ from Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-tbl-0001], row 5: ATGGCCA. The PAM immediately follows this sequence (Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0007], red nucleotides) but could not be altered by silent mutation, so one C-to-A silent mutation in the target was made (Fig. 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0007], lower red box). The rest of the 20-mer target for this construct is on the other side of the EGFP-FKBP insert, leaving only 7 bp of target homology before the PAM, so it may be that this site would have been essentially safe from degradation without this mutation, but it was easy to include it.",

The target site used to make our MCAK CRISPR cells is indicated among the other potential target sites considered.\nThis protocol requires no sequence differences in the 5′ UTR before the start codon, except as described in the preceding paragraph for protecting the template from CRISPR degradation (if the target site is in the 5′ UTR). This would be the situation most likely to result in normal endogenous levels of protein production, because the 5′ UTR in your CRISPR cell will have no changes relative to the original wild-type sequence.\nMaterials\nComputer and DNA analysis software as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0001]\n1.

This is your recombination homology region.",
    "Somewhat less than 700 bp can be used, but recombination efficiency will gradually decline as the length of the “arms” on either side of the target site becomes shorter. However, in one case we experienced, both ends of the region contained several repetitive sequences and the manufacturer said that it might not be possible to synthesize it. For that project, we shortened the upstream homology arm to ∼500 bp and the downstream arm to 400 bp, and were still able to find recombinants, so the length required is definitely variable.\n2. Simply insert the additional sequences desired (e.g., EGFP and FKBP) into the sequence from Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0004], step 1, immediately after the start codon of your gene, so that they form a continuous ORF with the first exon.\nIn the MCAK/Kif2C example in Figure 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-fig-0007], you can see that there is a lengthy linker between FKBP and the first exon of MCAK, which encodes a peptide rich in glycine, serine, and alanine. This is intended to form an unstructured spacer between the tagging proteins to insure that FKBP can interact with FRB for relocalization and that the GFP and FKBP domains don't interfere with MCAK/Kif2C's function. This linker may be needlessly long, but this is safer when relying on protein-protein interactions with unknown steric hindrances. We had one case of a fusion protein in which a 13-codon linker worked better (i.e., looked in cells more like the protein distribution seen by antibody staining) than a 5-codon linker in a transiently expressed protein.",

Verify that you still have the full-length ORFs you intended, despite any changes you made in step 3 to resist CRISPR targeting. This is your final recombination template.\n4. To the extreme ends of the sequence(s) from step 3, add restriction sites that are not found anywhere in the template sequence, to be used to cut the template from the vector prior to co-transfection of cells with the linearized template and the CRISPR targeting vector. These two sites can be for a single enzyme, because there is no need for directional ligation of the digestion product.\n5.

    "Verification of CRISPR-directed recombination into the chromosomal locus can be conveniently performed by PCR of genomic DNA made from a clonal population of CRISPR-treated cells. This will give you a band whose length corresponds to the predicted size of a recombinant gene. Non-recombined clones will produce shorter PCR products. The primers designed in steps 1 and 2 are both capable of analyzing whether a recombination has occurred at your expected CRISPR targeting site at the locus of interest. However, it is formally possible (although not very likely) that your entire recombination template could integrate in an unexpected site elsewhere in the genome (an “off-target recombination”). If that were to occur, the primers in step 2 would still amplify a product from that random integration of the template that looked like the desired recombinant, while also amplifying the wild-type-sized product from the unmodified locus of interest. In other words, the PCR from this off-target recombination event would look like that for a hemizygous clone (one with one modified allele and one wild-type allele at the locus of interest). Meanwhile, the primers from step 1 would amplify only the wild-type-sized product and would reveal that an off-target recombination had occurred, not a recombination at the locus of interest, because they would amplify only a wild-type-sized product. In contrast, the oligos designed in step 2 produces a smaller product, which is likely to be technically easier to amplify and which will show a greater relative difference in length for recombinant vs. wild-type cell clones. As primers are easy to design and cheap, and PCR is fairly quick, it is worth having both pairs to use and generate redundant evidence of the recombinant product.\nMaterials\nComputer and DNA analysis software as in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0001]",
    "1. Choose a pair of forward and reverse primers that bind to the chromosome on either side of the CRISPR targeting site, near but outside the region included in the recombination template plasmid as defined in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0004], step 1. These will typically be ∼1.5 kb apart on the wild-type chromosome.\nIf you are not inserting ≥10% of that length into your recombination template, detecting the length difference between the wild-type and recombinant chromosomes may be difficult. Very small insertions may require a different strategy, such as a primer that overlaps the insertion junction so that its full length can only anneal to the desired recombinant sequence.\n2. Choose a pair of forward and reverse primers that bind 200-300 bp on either side of your target site. From the wild-type chromosome, these will give a product of ∼0.5 kb, which is about the smallest we find convenient to look at on a gel. The EGFP-FKBP insert that we used created a recombinant chromosome that produced a PCR product ∼1.1 kb larger.\n3. Choose at least one primer within your insert that is not expected to be found in the genome (or at least not nearby on the relevant chromosome) of your cells. This can be used for PCR with the opposite-strand primer from either primer pair in step 1 or 2 to give a product only in the case of chromosomes that have your specific insert.\nFor screening MCAK/Kif2C clones, we used an FKBP reverse primer with the forward primer from step 2, which is in the 5′ UTR, to give a product of 1 kb. DNA from wild-type cells should result in no PCR product with this primer pair because of the lack of the FKBP priming site.",

The remaining challenge, and this can be significant, is to find the engineered cells within the vast majority of rapidly growing non-recombinant cells. Your GFP tag, which will prove useful for future imaging and performing experiments, will be helpful for this process as well. You can use a microscope and select clones by eye (we have done this successfully). But often the endogenous protein is expressed at modest levels, making this method challenging. More routinely, we use FACs to isolate the cells expressing GFP at the highest levels and then plate them sparsely, after which we search for clones by eye using a fluorescence microscope. This method assumes that you are using a cell line that is tolerant of being grown highly dispersed on plates in cloning steps 9 and 10. An advantage of this method is that you can prioritize clones that are uniform, normal looking, and show appropriate spatial localization of your protein of interest up front, rather than isolating clones blind and using PCR to detect recombinants. It is also possible, depending on the microscope, to measure the expressed protein fluorescently “on the fly” and parse lower- versus higher-expressing cells to enrich for homozygosity.\nMaterials\nRecombination plasmid (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0004])\nAppropriate restriction enzymes\nCRISPR targeting plasmid (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0002])\nPhenol (Sigma P4557)\nChloroform\n3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-rec-0004])\nIsopropanol\n70% (v/v) ethanol (prepared from 200-proof ethanol, Fisher 04-355-222)\nTE buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-rec-0007])\npX459\nGFP reporter plasmid, such as pmaxGFP\nAppropriate cultured cells",

Excess DNA can be saved at 4°C in case another attempt at transfection needs to be made later.\n2. Mix 4-µg aliquots of digested recombination template + 1 µg of each CRISPR targeting plasmid from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0002], step 24, or preferably use one or two of the targeting vectors that were most successful in the EGxxFP test in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0003].\nWe use a Lonza nucleofector II for cell transfection, which calls for ∼5 µg DNA per transfection. If you have a different model of Lonza nucleofector, you will have to consult the manufacturer's suggestions to replicate these conditions.",
    "3. Set up a control transfection with 1 µg of empty pX459 and an appropriate amount of a GFP reporter plasmid such as pmaxGFP.\n4. Transfect 2 × 106 cultured cells with DNA mixes from steps 2 and 3. Plate as in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0003], step 5, preferably in 10-cm dishes to maximize the isolation of clones of cells. The greater the number of cells you plate, the higher the likelihood of finding recombinant colonies of cells, which are often present at low numbers.\nIf your inverted fluorescence microscope cannot handle 10-cm plates (usually due to the lack of a long-working-distance objective), you may need to replate the cells several days after transfection and select colonies on dishes that will work in your scope. 60-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek cat. no. NC1843747) will sometimes suffice for this step. The principal limitation is lack of surface area to plate isolated colonies. Alternatively, a long-working-distance fluorescence objective can be employed in conjunction with a large plastic TC plate.\n5. After ∼24 hr, view the reporter plate from step 3 and verify that the number and proportion of transfected cells is as expected for a typical, successful transfection with your method and cell type. If the transfection looks good, add puromycin to all plates at a concentration appropriate for your cell line.\nIn our hands, every unique plasmid has a different transfection efficiency. However, we have found that any individual plasmid exhibits a consistent efficiency from transfection to transfection if the cell number and DNA concentration are held constant. Thus, you will assess your overall transfection efficiency using pmaxGFP. This will control for the performance of your transfection reagents.",
    "IMPORTANT: We have found the correct range of puromycin to be rather narrow, and different, for each cell line. Thus, each cell line must be tested individually to determine the lowest concentration of puromycin that will effectively kill untransfected cells.\n6. Check dishes every day to look for cell death (floating cells). Puromycin kills quickly, so 1-3 days of treatment should be enough.\nFor the control DNA mix, most surviving cells should be green and most non-green cells should be dead. We find that 2 days of incubation with puromycin is usually sufficient. Remove the puromycin and replace with puromycin-free medium when the control looks enriched for green cells.\n7. Recombinant cells must be located among the surviving cells. Let cells grow after puromycin selection until the survivors appear to have formed small colonies (a few dozen to a couple of hundred cells per colony, depending on how crowded the plates are). View these in an inverted fluorescence microscope each day or so. If you are lucky, your gene will be expressed at a high enough level that you will be able to see GFP-expressing colonies. If green colonies are visible, you may be able to remove them directly from the plate; to do this, proceed to step 9. Alternatively, you can considerably enrich your cells for recombinants by subjecting them to a cell sorting step to collect GFP-labeled cells.\nIf a clone of cells is well isolated on the plate, away from other cells, and is uniformly expressing GFP and healthy-looking in size and appearance, there is no reason not to collect it directly from your initial plate of transfectants. We successfully isolate clones in this manner. More often, however, FACS is used to enrich for recombinants (step 8).",
    "8. Allow the cells to grow until a 10-cm plate is near confluence, and then use single-cell FACS to try to sort out the brightest 1% of the cells. Generally this will be performed in a university FACS facility on a cost-per-run basis and under the guidance of a skilled technician. At the University of Washington, a typical FACS sort will cost ∼$300, but the procedure greatly increases the likelihood that we will find recombinant cells. After collecting several thousand cells, plate a proportion (about one-third) with sufficient dilution to ensure the formation of isolated colonies in step 9i. Culture the remainder in a 6- or 10-cm dish for a few days. Trypsinize cells, dilute into two or three aliquots, and freeze in cell culture medium + 10% DMSO. These cells will serve as a back-up reserve in case it becomes necessary to isolate more colonies at a future date.\n9. Clone recombinant cells by limiting dilution (meaning from single cells). If you prefer, you can do this using a 96-well plate. However, we prefer the utility and speed of selecting individual colonies on a larger, sparse plate by eye, as described below.\nIf chosen colonies appear isolated but you do not know for sure whether they originate from a single cell, you can always reclone the cells from a single cell at a later time. Isolating healthy, uniform colonies at an early stage prevents you from having to process an excess of non-recombined cells by PCR.\nWash the plate with PBS or serum-free medium and leave a thin layer of the same solution on the plate.\nLocate patches of green cells under the inverted fluorescence microscope and leave plate on stage.\nGently apply several drops of trypsin/EDTA solution mixed 1:1 with PBS to each uniform and brightly labeled colony.",
    "Wait until cells appear to be coming loose from the plate. Then, aspirate each colony with a pipettor (a 200-µl [P200] pipettor set to 30-50 µl usually works well) and dilute cells from each colony into 1-ml aliquots of complete medium with serum.\nEstimate how many cells are in the aliquots. Replate these cells such that you expect them to be disperse enough to grow up into well-isolated colonies of ∼100 cells. We usually use 6-well plates for this step.\nIdeally, you will work up clonal cells from five to ten colonies from the initial transfection (probably not all will be homozygous; see step 20). If you do not plate all the cells, you may want to save the remainder growing in another plate, at least until you are fairly confident that the cells plated for colonies are growing properly. This excess cell population could also be frozen to clone out more colonies later, just to hedge your bets.\n10. If you are confident that the colonies in step 9 are truly clonal, proceed to step 12. If you want to be extra cautious, pick one colony from each “clone” and repeat step 9 once more, plating clones into individual wells of 6-well plates.\n11. At this time, you should also start growing some wild-type cells to be used for a control genomic DNA prep in steps 13-18.\n12. Trypsinize cells gently (as described in step 9i) while on the microscope stage and pull a colony of ∼100 cells from each clone. Replate each clone in one well of a 6-well plate. Let grow until near confluence.",
    "If some clones are more crowded than others, unless their densities vary by more than ∼2-fold, all can be passaged when the most crowded ones are ready. Otherwise, you can either passage/dilute them to try to even out the concentrations at this stage, or move each well on to step 13 as it is ready.\nCAUTION: Unless you have a microscope contained within a tissue culture hood, you will have to perform this step without laminar flow protection. In this case, limit your cell lines to BSL1-rated cell lines, of which there are several suitable candidates. Otherwise a small, inverted microscope that can fit within a laminar flow hood with a microscope cut out can work well.\n13. Trypsinize each clone in each well of the 6-well plate from step 12 and suspend in 3 ml RPMI + 10% FBS, as follows:\n         \nRemove growth medium from each well and add PBS to the cells.\nRemove PBS and add 0.2 µl trypsin/EDTA to each well.\nTriturate (pipet up and down repeatedly) cells in each well with a fresh pipet tip.\n14. Roughly count the number of cells collected from each well.\n15. Replate 10% of the cells in a 10-cm dish, and process these cells as described in step 21. These will be your recombinant CRISPR cells, assuming that they pass the genomic DNA analysis.\n16. Gently pellet the remainder of the cells and resuspend in 100 µl PBS. Collect a similar sample of wild-type cells. If not all cells are ready on the same day, cells in PBS can be frozen until all are ready.",
    "17. Perform genomic DNA preps with proteinase K digestion and phenol extraction as described in Koh (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-bib-0013]) or Moore and Dowhan (2002[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-bib-0019]) or using a similar protocol, scaled as appropriate for the number of cells collected.\nIf the cells were frozen in step 16, make up the initial lysis buffer with 2× concentrations of proteinase K, SDS, and EDTA, and add an equal volume of this 2× buffer to the thawed cell suspensions. Do not try to pellet the cells after freezing because they will be lysed by the freeze-thaw.\n18. Dissolve the final DNA pellet in 200 µl TE buffer. Genomic DNA can be hard to redissolve, so incubate overnight at room temperature. Mix thoroughly but gently.\n19. Do PCRs with analytical primers from Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0005] and 1 µl of each genomic DNA prep, as directed in your PCR kit instructions. Analyze products on 1% agarose gel as described in Sambrook et al. (1989[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-bib-0022]) or Voytas (2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-bib-0026]).\nIf the reactions fail, it may be helpful to dilute the genomic DNA 5× and try again; this has worked for us a couple of times.\n20. Score band patterns for expected lengths from wild-type or recombinant chromosomes. For primer pairs from Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0006], step 1 or 2, homozygous clones (which have had both alleles modified by recombination) will give only a larger band relative to the wild type, whereas hemizygous clones (only one allele modified) will give both the wild-type and the expected larger band.",
    "You will probably find that you have both homozygous and hemizygous clones, which is why we chose multiple clones to work up in step 9. If only hemizygous clones are found and you need a homozygous cell line for your experiments, you may need to repeat Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0006] using the hemizygous cell line, while prioritizing for brighter cells. We did successfully achieve that in one case. Note that a mixed population of homozygous and wild-type cells would look the same as a hemizygous cell clone by PCR, so having a pure clone for genomic DNA analysis is important.\n21. When the 10-cm dishes from step 12 are near confluence, passage to a new dish, collect cells that are not replated, aliquot, and freeze in 10% DMSO. Store frozen cell aliquots in liquid N2. Cells that scored correctly for PCR band patterns in step 16 are now ready to use experimentally or can be assayed by western blotting (according to Harlow, & Lane 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-bib-0011], pp. 480–507, or Gallagher et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-bib-0010]) for the correct size gene product, as an optional confirmation that the expected fusion protein is being expressed. Once you are satisfied with the status of the isolated cell lines, you can prepare stable cell lines from your isolates that express binding partners (Support Protocol 2).",
    "Obtaining a CRISPR-engineered cell line expressing a GFP-FKBP-modified gene can be useful without further modification because such cell lines enable researchers to track endogenous proteins live. However, once modified with an FKBP tag, the proteins can be relocalized to any region of the cell in which FRB stably resides. We have engineered a plasmid, pMX1463 (available from Addgene.com), in which FRB has been modified with an 18-aa Src homology 4 domain (SH4) to localize FRB to the membrane (Suh et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-bib-0025]) and SBFP2 (Strongly-enhanced Blue Fluorescent Protein; Kremers et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-bib-0014]) to visualize and assess this localization. The labeling enables cell selection of stable transformants using G418 that can be visually assayed. One disadvantage of labeling with SBFP2 is that it is antigenically identical to GFP and will be labeled with anti-GFP antibodies should you want to amplify your signal using immunofluorescence. Thus, BFP labeling will interfere with immunodetection of GFP should you want to do that. A solution is to use another fluorescent protein or labeling tag that does not share antigenicity with GFP to evaluate the localization of your FRB binding partner.\nMaterials\nCRISPR cell line (Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0006])\npMX1463, LDR-FRB-SBFP2 plasmid (AddGene 208805)\nCell Line Nucleofector Kit V (for Hct116 or hTERT-RPE; Lonza VCA-1003)\nRPMI 1640 (Fisher 11-875-093), with and without 10% FBS (Hyclone SH30070.03) and 1× Pen-Strep (Fisher 30-002-CI)\nPuromycin (Fisher BP 2956-100)\nG418 (geneticin)\n200 mM L-glutamine (Fisher 25-030-081)\nRapamycin\nLonza nucleofector II\nBD Aria III cell sorter\nInverted fluorescence microscope (such as a Nikon Ti2)\nMatTek 35-mm glass-bottom dish, no. 1.5, poly-D-lysine coated (cat. no.

    "1. Transfect your CRISPR cell line with 1-2 µg plasmid pMX1463 into 2 × 106 cells according to the Nucleofector II instructions.\n2. Once the cells have recovered from transfection, plate the entire 500-µl tube of transfected cells in RPMI (no additives) into a 10-ml dish containing standard cell culture medium (with 10% FBS, 1× Pen/Strep, and L-glutamine). Let the cells grow and express overnight.\n3. The next day, replace the medium with medium containing G418. We have used 1000 µg/ml for Hct116 cells.\nG418 is prepared in sterile distilled, deionized H2O at 50 mg/ml and frozen as ∼1-ml aliquots. So for a 10-ml dish of cells, you will add 200 µl of the G418 stock to a 10-ml plate. If desired, you can titrate the quantity of drug to use by determining the minimum concentration of G418 that will kill all your untransfected cells in one week. That is usually in a range of 400 µg/ml to 1500 µg/ml.\nIMPORTANT: Change the medium every other day (at the very least—some people do it every day) to add fresh G418. The drug diluted into cell culture medium will decrease in potency over time and must be replenished frequently.\n4. After 6-8 days, you should begin to see massive cell death (in the form of floating cells) and small colonies of surviving cells.\n5. Observe the colonies in a fluorescence inverted microscope. Not all of the colonies will be fluorescent even if you transfect your cells a fluorescent-protein-expressing construct.",
    "6. Systematically look over all of the dish and identify colonies with bright, nicely even-looking cells that appear healthy. Mark the best-looking colonies with a Sharpie pen by either circling them or putting a dot beside them on the bottom of the dish. Hint: the red Sharpies can be seen under the fluorescence microscope!\n7. Isolate colonies as described in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.965#cpz1965-prot-0004], steps 9-11. Once the cells are pure, you can lower the G418 concentration to a maintenance level of ∼200 µg/ml.\n8. Plate the purified cells on a MatTek 35-mm glass-bottom dish. Let them grow for 24-48 hr, add 0.5 µM rapamycin, and evaluate the cells under the fluorescence microscope live to score for relocalization of your GFP-engineered protein."
