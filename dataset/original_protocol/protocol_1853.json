Plate the appropriate number of 201B7 hiPSCs in a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of the mTeSR Plus media.\nCulture the cells for 2–3 days in a CO2 incubator (with CO2 level set to 5%).\nRecover the cells with gentle cell dissociation reagent and resuspend them in the mTeSR Plus media supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nPause point: hiPSC are suspended in mFreSR Cryopreservation Medium and stored in liquid nitrogen.\nGeneration of hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs)\nTiming: 11 days\nThaw STEMdiff™ Neural Induction Medium and STEMdiff™ SMADi Neural Induction Supplement at room temperature (15°C–25°C) or overnight (2°C–8°C). Swirl both media thoroughly.\nAdd 0.5 mL of STEMdiff™ SMADi Neural Induction Supplement to 250 mL of STEMdiff™ Neural Induction Medium (NIM). Mix them thoroughly and warm them to room temperature before use.\nCoat each well of 6-well plate with 1 mL of Matrigel and let it sit at room temperature for 1 h.\nWash the hiPSC cultured well with 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 1 mL of gentle cell dissociation reagent and incubate at 37°C for 8–10 min.\nPipet up and down 3–5 times to dissociate the cell aggregates. Collect the cells in a 15 mL conical tube.\nWash the plate with 2 mL PBS and collect the remaining cells into a 15 mL conical tube.\nCount the viable cells with a hemocytometer using Trypan blue dye method.",
    "Centrifuge the 15 mL conical tube at 300×g for 4 min. Aspirate and discard the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellets with NIM supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 to achieve a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nAspirate the Matrigel from a 6-well plate and add 2 mL cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/well) into a single well of Matrigel-coated plate.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 11 days. Fresh NIM without Y-27632 is used for medium changes every other day.\nAspirate the media from the plates, add 1 mL of Accutase per well, and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 5 min.\nCollect the cell suspension in a 15 mL conical tube. Wash the plates with 2 mL pre-warmed DMEM/F12 media, and collect the residual in the same tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300×g for 4 min, and the resulting cell pellet is resuspended in NIM and used for the evaluation of the differentiation state by qRT-PCR and fluorescence staining of hiPSC markers (POU5F1) and NPC markers (SOX1, NESTIN, PAX6, FOXG1).\nPause point: hiPSC-derived NPCs are suspended in mFreSR Cryopreservation Medium and stored in liquid nitrogen.\nSingle cell glycan-seq\nTiming: 2 days\nCritical: Contamination with DNA and DNase will significantly affect the experiments.
