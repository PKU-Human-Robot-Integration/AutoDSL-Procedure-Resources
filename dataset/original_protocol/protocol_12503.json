    "Designing a trace conditioning paradigm using backward masking to block awareness\n1. Design Stimuli\nDesign the stimuli for the two groups.\nChoose 4 neutral expressions from different individuals.\nAlign the faces so that the eye region of each face is in the same location.\nCrop the faces using an oval so that the hair, ears, and other peripheral features are no longer visible.\nUse the signal processing toolbox in Matlab (See Table 1 for software necessary to run the experiment) to create high-pass filtered images, by removing all information that is fewer than 5 cycles per degree12.\nCreate the mask by merging several neutral expressions together, and adding high spatial frequency noise to the image.\nNormalize all images so that they have equal luminance.\n2. Program the Experiment using Presentation\nProgram the training and testing phases in Presentation using the parameters described below (See Figure 1).\nIn addition, program a separate file (PCC) that will be used by the PSYLAB data acquisition software package during training and testing, in order to deliver the shock triggered by Presentation.\nFor the training session program 4 blocks of differential trace fear conditioning with 15 trials per CS, per block.\nOn each trial present the CSs for 30 msec.\nOn each trial present the mask for 970 msec.\nOn each CS+ trial present the shock UCS for 100 msec, so that it coterminates with the mask.\nVary the location of the CS/mask combination so that it randomly appears in 1 of 4 quadrants.\nPresent 1 trial every 6±2 sec using a variable intertrial interval.\nFor the testing session program 1 block of reacquisition with 5 trials of each face CS, and 5 trials each of two new face CSs.",
    "In order to maximize your ability to record skin conductance responses (SCRs) during the testing trials, present the CS for 8 sec.\nOn each CS+ trial present the shock UCS for 100 msec, so that it coterminates with the CS+.\nPresent 1 trial every 20±4 sec using a variable intertrial interval.\nInstruct subjects to report UCS expectancy during both sessions, and record their responses using an MRI/MEG compatible axis device (joystick, slider, dial; See Section 7).\nRecord SCRs during the testing session using electrodes attached to the bottom of the participants left foot (See Section 9).\nRecording brain activity during the task using magnetoencephalography\n3. Setup Equipment for Training at MEG Suite (See Figure 2)\nConnect the stimulus presentation computer to the MEG acquisition system using a standard DB25 multi connector ribbon cable (See Table 2 for equipment necessary to conduct the experiment.).\nConnect the stimulus presentation computer to the PSYLAB stand-alone monitor (SAM) using the 8-bit to 2-bit isolation adapter and the synchronization cable.\nThe transistor -transistor logic (TTL) pulses used to mark the stimulus presentations can cause artifacts in the MEG data if they are sent to the SAM. To avoid these artifacts, mark the onset of the stimuli using only the bits blocked by the isolation adapter.\nConnect the shock stimulator (SHK1) to the SAM using the cable provided with the unit.\nPass the shielded extension cable through the wave guide and connect it to the shock stimulator.\nConnect the SAM to a computer running the PSYLAB data acquisition software using a standard USB cable.\nConnect the rotary dial to the stimulus presentation computer (USB) and the MEG acquisition system (BNC) using the gameport-to-gameport/BNC splitter and the gameport-to-USB adapter.\nRecord two minutes of sensor data without the subject in the room.",
    "4. Setup Equipment for Testing at MRI Suite\nConnect the stimulus presentation computer to the SAM using the synchronization cable.\nConnect the shock stimulator (SHK1) and the skin conductance amplifier (SC5) to the SAM using the cables provided with the unit.\nPass the shielded extension cables for SCR and shock through the wave guide and connect them to their respective units.\nConnect the SAM to a computer running the PSYLAB data acquisition software using a standard USB cable.\nConnect the rotary dial to the stimulus presentation computer using the gameport to USB adapter.\n5.

    "Plug the disposable electrode leads into the MEG system amplifier.\nPlug the HPI wiring harness into the MEG system.\nPlug the shock electrode leads into the shielded extension cable.\nRaise the chair so that the subject's head is touching the top of the MEG helmet.\nPosition the screen so that the projected image is in focus.\n6. Shock Workup\nSet the shock to a level that the subject reports as painful but tolerable.\nArm the shock stimulator by turning the dial from the 0 mA position the 5 mA position.\nAdminister several presentations of the shock using the stimulus control window from the PSYLAB data acquisition software package.\nAfter each presentation have the subject rate the intensity of the shock on a scale from 0 (not at all painful) to 10 (painful but tolerable).\nGradually increase the intensity of the shock until the subject rates it as a 10.\nRecord the value from the scale in the parameter value box in the subject details window; shocks will be administered during the experiment at the value indicated in this box.\n7. Response Device\nInstruct the subject on the proper use of the dial using an example Presentation scenario.\nInstructions: \"Move the cursor all the way to the right (100) if you are absolutely sure that you will receive a presentation of the stimulation in the near future. Move the cursor all the way to the left (0) if you are sure that you will not receive a stimulation in the near future. Move the cursor to the middle (50) if you are unsure whether or not you will receive the stimulation in the near future.\"\n8. Record MEG During Training\nRecord two minutes of raw data at 2 kHz, while the subject rests with their eyes open.",
    "Prior to training begin recording event codes and shock delivery using the PSYLAB data acquisition software.\nBe sure that PSYLAB is running the proper PCC code so that it sends the shock when triggered by the computer.\nRecord raw data at 2 kHz during each of the four training runs.\nRecord online averages as a way to visually inspect the data in realtime for systematic sources of noise.\nAsk the subject to rate the intensity of the shock after each run to assess habituation.\n9. Setup Subject for Testing at MRI Suite\nEscort the subject from the MEG suite to the MRI suite.\nReattach the shock electrodes and recalibrate the intensity of the shock.\nAttach two cup electrodes to the bottom of the subject's left foot to monitor SCRs.\nMake sure that the subject still understands how to use the response device.\nPosition the subject on the MRI table, secure their head, and connect the SCR and shock electrode leads to the corresponding shielded cables.\nPosition the mirror attached to the head coil so that the participant can see the screen placed behind the head coil.\n10.

Preprocess MRI Volume\nUse Freesurfer16 to create a segmented subcortical volume, and surfaces of the cortex, outer skin, and outer skull.\nConvert volumes and surfaces to AFNI readable format.\nRun importsurfaces.csh - the first time you run the program it will copy all the files you need into a new 'MODEL' folder in each subject's segmentation folder. It will also create an 'importsurface.mrml' file that is used to create the surface models of the amygdala and hippocampus.\nCreate and convert the amygdala and hippocampus volumes into surfaces using Slicer3 and Paraview.\n\t\nRun Slicer3 importsurface.mrml from the subject's 'MODEL' directory.
