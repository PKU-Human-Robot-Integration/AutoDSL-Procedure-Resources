    "To ensure minimal material loss, (1) work with DNA low-binding tubes and tips (see Table of Materials), (2) place reagents on the tube wall instead of introducing the tip inside the sample and, (3) if possible, mix the sample by inversion instead of pipetting the sample up and down, and spin down afterward to recover the sample.\n1. Cell fixation\nCells growing in suspension\n\t\nHarvest 50,000 to one million cells and place them in a DNA low-binding 1.5 mL tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell types used for the present study are detailed in the representative results section.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 600 x g (at 4 °C) using a fixed-angle rotor centrifuge and remove the supernatant by pipetting.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at room temperature.\nAdd 143 µL of methanol-free 16% formaldehyde to reach a concentration of 2% and mix.\nIncubate the cells for 10 min while rotating at room temperature to fix the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Try to be as accurate as possible with the 10 min incubation. Over- or under-fixation of the cells can lead to a decrease in the quality of the library.\nQuench the reaction by adding 164 µL of ice-cold 1 M glycine and mix. Incubate the cells for 5 min, rotating at room temperature.\nFurther incubate the cells for 15 min on ice, mixing by inversion every ~5 min.\nCentrifuge the cells for 10 min at 1,000 x g (at 4 °C) using a fixed-angle rotor centrifuge and remove the supernatant.\nWash the cells by resuspending the pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nCentrifuge the cells for 10 min at 1,000 x g (at 4 °C) and remove the supernatant.",
    "​NOTE: The pelleted cells can be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or dry ice and stored at -80 °C.\nAdherent cells\n\t\nWash the cells in the culture dish with 1x PBS.\nPrepare enough RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and methanol-free 2% formaldehyde at room temperature to cover the culture dish.\nAdd the supplemented media to the culture dish with the cells and incubate for 10 min, rocking at room temperature to fix the cells.\n\t\t​NOTE: Try to be as accurate as possible with the 10 min incubation. Over- or under-fixation of the cells can lead to a decrease in the quality of the library.\nQuench the reaction by adding 1 M glycine until 0.125 M and mix by rocking.\nIncubate the cells for 5 min, rocking at room temperature.\nFurther incubate the cells for 15 min at 4 °C, mixing by rocking every 3-4 min.\nRemove the media and wash the cells with cold 1x PBS.\nScrape the cells and transfer them into a 1.5 mL DNA low-binding tube. Wipe the culture dish clean with 0.5-1 mL of cold 1x PBS.\nCentrifuge the cells for 10 min at 1,000 x g (at 4 °C) using a fixed-angle rotor centrifuge and remove the supernatant. The pelleted cells can be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or dry ice and stored at -80 °C.\n2. Lysis and digestion\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of cold lysis buffer (Table 1) to disrupt the cell membrane. The addition of the buffer alone should be enough to resuspend the cells, but they can be further resuspended if necessary by light vortexing.",
    "Incubate on ice for 30 min, mixing by inversion every ~5 min. Centrifuge the nuclei for 10 min at 1,000 x g (at 4 °C) and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the nuclei with 500 µL of cold 1.25x restriction buffer 2 (see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge the nuclei for 10 min at 1,000 x g (at 4 °C) and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the nuclei in 179 µL of 1.25x restriction buffer 2.\nAdd 5.5 µL of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; see Table of Materials) and mix. The cells may form clumps; this is normal and needs to be disaggregated as much as possible by vortexing. Incubate the sample for 1 h at 37 °C in a thermoblock, with shaking at 950 rpm.\nQuench the SDS by adding 37.5 µL of 10% Triton X-100 and mix. Incubate the sample for 1 h at 37 °C in a thermoblock, with shaking at 950 rpm.\nDigest the chromatin by adding 7.5 µL of HindIII (100 U/µL; see Table of Materials) and mix. Incubate the sample overnight at 37 °C in a thermoblock, with shaking at 950 rpm.\nThe next morning, add an extra 2.5 µL of HindIII (100 U/µL) and further incubate the sample for 1 h at 37 °C in a thermoblock, with shaking at 950 rpm to ensure proper chromatin digestion.\n\tNOTE: As part of the digestion efficiency controls (see step 5.1), transfer the equivalent of 20,000 to 40,000 nuclei to another tube to represent the undigested control. After digestion, transfer the same number of cells to another tube again to represent the digested control. It is recommended to test the digestion efficiency as a separate experiment if the availability of the starting material is scarce.\n3. Ligation and decrosslinking",
    "Chill the sample on ice. Prepare a mastermix and add the following reagents to fill in and biotinylate the restriction fragment overhangs: 3 µL of 10x restriction buffer 2, 1 µL of nuclease-free water, 0.75 µL of 10 mM dCTP, 0.75 µL of 10 mM dTTP, 0.75 µL of 10 mM dGTP, 18.75 µL of 0.4 mM biotin-14-dATP, and 5 µL of 5 U/µL Klenow (see Table of Materials). Incubate the sample for 75 min at 37 °C, mixing by inversion every ~15 min.\nChill the sample on ice. Prepare a mastermix and add the following reagents to ligate the filled-in DNA ends: 50 µL of 10x ligation buffer, 2.5 µL of 20 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 12.5 µL of 1 U/µL T4 DNA ligase, and 173 µL of nuclease-free water (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate the sample for 4-6 h at 16 °C, mixing by inversion every ~1 h. Further, incubate the sample for 30 min at room temperature. Decrosslink the chromatin by adding 30 µL of 10 mg/mL Proteinase K and mix. Incubate the sample overnight at 65 °C.\nThe following morning, add an extra 15 µL of 10 mg/mL Proteinase K and further incubate the sample for 2 h at 65 °C to ensure proper chromatin decrosslinking.\n4. DNA purification\nCool the sample to room temperature and transfer it to a suitable tube for phenol-chloroform purification.\nAdd 1 volume (545 µL) of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to purify the DNA and mix by vigorously shaking.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 12,000 x g at room temperature and transfer the upper aqueous phase (545 µL) to a 2 mL DNA low-binding tube.",
    "Add the following reagents to precipitate the DNA: 1,362.5 µL of 100% ethanol chilled to -20 °C, 54.5 µL of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), and 2 µL of 15 mg/mL glycogen as a coprecipitant.\nIncubate for 1 h at -80 °C or overnight at -20 °C.\nCentrifuge the sample for 30 min at 16,000-21,000 x g at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. The DNA pellet must be visible.\nWash the pellet by adding 1 mL of 70% ethanol, vortexing, and centrifuging for 10 min at 16,000-21,000 x g at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and let the pellet air-dry. Resuspend the DNA pellet in 130 µL of nuclease-free water.\nAssess the concentration by fluorometric quantification (see Table of Materials). Store the purified 3C material at -20 °C for several months before proceeding with the protocol.\n5. Optional quality controls\nAssess the digestion efficiency. Perform decrosslinking and phenol:chloroform DNA purification, as described previously, to the undigested and digested controls obtained in step 2.13. Resuspend the DNA pellet in 10 µL of nuclease-free water. Quantify the concentration and dilute the obtained DNA, if necessary, to 4 ng/µL.\nPerform quantitative PCR with 4 ng of DNA of both the undigested and digested controls, with primers spanning an open chromatin locus with and without a HindIII target (see Table 2 for primer design). Calculate the efficiency of the digestion following a previously published report35.\n\tNOTE: The efficiency of ligation is calculated as a percentage using the formula: digestion (%) = 100 -100/(2^[(Ct digested with HindIII - Ctdigested without HindIII) - (Ct undigested with HindIII - Ct undigested without HindIII)]) (see Table 3), which takes into account the differential of the different Cts obtained for each primer pair in the undigested and digested controls.",
    "Assess the sensitivity of the interaction detection by performing conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (0.2 mM dNTP, 0.4 µm both F + R primers, 0.1 and U/µL hot start polymerase), with primers spanning both long- and short-range cell-invariant interactions (see Table 2 for primer design). Use 50-100 ng of 3C material (for short- and long-range interactions, respectively) and amplify using the following conditions: 98 °C for 15 min, followed by 37 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and finish by 72 °C for 10 min. Hold at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: If the amount of DNA obtained is less than 2 µg, only check a long- and a short-range interaction instead of the whole interaction panel.\nRun the product on 1x tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) using 1.6% agarose gel and look for the presence of the corresponding PCR amplicon54.\n\tNOTE: Due to the unpredictable \"cutting-and-pasting\" of the genome, unspecific bands may appear. As long as the correct band size is observed, it is counted as correct.\nAssess the efficiency of biotin fill-in and ligation by differentially digesting a short-range PCR product with HindIII, NheI (see Table of Materials), both enzymes or none (water), and running the product on a 1x TBE 1.6% agarose gel. A correct fill-in and ligation eliminate the previous HindIII target and create a new NheI target, so the amplicon should be cut only in the presence of NheI.\n\t​NOTE: To minimize material loss, retrieve 2.5 µL of a short-range PCR product from the interaction controls and reamplify it five times to perform the fill-in and ligation controls.\n6. Sonication\nTransfer the 130 µL of the sample (top up with nuclease-free water if some was used for the controls) to a cuvette suitable for sonication.",
    "Set up a water bath sonicator and sonicate using the following parameters (optimized for the model and cuvettes described in Table of Materials): duty factor: 20%; peak incidence power: 50; cycles per burst: 200; time: 65 s; and temperature range: 6-10 °C (8 °C optimal).\nTransfer the sample into a new 1.5 mL DNA low-binding tube.\n7. End-repair\nPrepare a mastermix and add the following reagents to repair the DNA fragments' uneven ends created during the sonication: 18 µL of 10x ligation buffer, 18 µL of 2.5 mM dNTP mix each, 6.5 µL of 3 U/µL T4 DNA polymerase, 6.5 µL of 10 U/µL T4 PNK, and 1.3 µL of 5 U/µL Klenow (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate the sample for 30 min at 20 °C and top up with Tris-low EDTA (TLE) buffer (see Table 1) to 300 µL.\n8. Biotin pull-down\nTransfer 150 µL of C1 streptavidin beads (see Table of Materials) per sample to a 1.5 mL tube, place them on a 1.5 mL tube magnet, and wait 2-3 min or until all the beads are stuck to the wall. Remove the supernatant, leaving the beads behind.\nWash the beads with 400 µL of 1x Tween buffer (TB; see Table 1). To wash the beads, add the buffer and resuspend them by soft vortexing. Place the tube back in the magnet and wait 2-3 min or until all the beads are stuck to the wall. Remove the supernatant, leaving the beads behind.\nWash the beads with 300 µL of 1x no Tween buffer (NTB; see Table 1). Resuspend the beads in 300 µL of 2x NTB (see Table 1).",
    "NOTE: The beads may form a dusty layer around the tube wall when washing with buffers without detergent. This is normal and doesn't affect the outcome of the protocol.\nCombine this 300 µL of beads in 2x NTB with the 300 µL of the sample. Incubate for 15 min, rotating at room temperature to pull down the informative DNA fragments with biotin. The library is now stuck to the C1 streptavidin beads.\nWash the beads with 400 µL of 1x NTB. Wash the beads with 100 µL of TLE buffer and afterward resuspend them in 35.7 µL of TLE buffer.\n9. dATP-tailing, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification\nPrepare a mastermix and add the following reagents to the sample to dATP-tail the ends of the repaired DNA fragments: 5 µL of 10x restriction buffer 2, 2.3 µL of 10 mM dATP, and 7 µL of 5 U/µL Klenow exo-. Incubate the sample for 30 min at 37 °C.\nInactivate Klenow exo- by further incubating the sample for 10 min at 65 °C. Cool the sample on ice. Wash the beads with 300 µL of 1x TB. Wash the beads with 300 µL of 1x NTB.\nWash the beads with 100 µL of 1x ligation buffer and afterward resuspend them in 50 µL of 1x ligation buffer. Add 4 µL of 15 µM pre-annealed adapter mix (see Table 2) and 1 µL of 2,000 U/µL T4 DNA ligase (see Table of Materials) to the sample.\nIncubate for 2 h at room temperature. Wash the beads with 400 µL of 1x TB. Wash the beads with 200 µL of 1x NTB. Wash the beads with 100 µl of 1x restriction buffer 2.",
    "Wash the beads with 50 µL of 1x restriction buffer 2 and afterward resuspend them in 50 µL of 1x restriction buffer 2.\nMix the following reagents to prepare the PCR reaction to amplify the library: 50 µL of beads with the library, 250 µL of 2x PCR mastermix with enzyme, 12 µL of F + R primers (25 µM each; see Table 2), and 188 µL of nuclease-free water.\nPerform the PCR with the following conditions (split the PCR reagent mix into 50 µL reactions): 98 °C for 40 s, followed by X cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and finish by 72 °C for 10 min. Hold at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Use the following number of cycles as a starting point for optimizing the protocol in diploid cells aiming for a 500-1,000 ng output before library capture: one million cells for eight cycles; 250,000 cells for 10 cycles; 50,000 cells for 12 cycles.\nPool all the 50 µL reactions from the same sample into a 1.5 mL DNA low-binding tube, place it on a 1.5 mL tube magnet, and wait 2-3 min or until all the beads are stuck to the wall.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the library (500 µL) to a new 1.5 mL DNA low-binding tube. Top up with TLE buffer to 500 µL if some of the supernatant was lost. The C1 streptavidin beads are no longer needed.\nPerform a double-sided selection55 using paramagnetic bead purification (0.4-1 volume). This allows for the selective elimination of too-large (>1,000 bp) and too-small fragments or PCR primers (<200 bp), depending on the concentration of polyethylene glycol and salt of the paramagnetic beads added.",
    "Add 200 µL (0.4 volumes) of stock beads to the library and mix by vortexing. Incubate for 10 min, rotating at room temperature.\nPlace on a magnet, wait 2-3 min or until all the beads are stuck to the wall, and transfer the supernatant containing the library (without the larger fragments) to a new 1.5 mL DNA low-binding tube.\nConcentrate the beads by taking 750 µL of stock beads, place them in a 1.5 mL tube on a magnet, wait for 2-3 min or until all the beads are stuck to the wall, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the beads by vortexing in 300 µL of new stock beads.\nAdd this 300 µL of concentrated beads to the sample (1 volume) and mix by vortexing. Incubate for 10 min, rotating at room temperature. Place on a magnet, wait 2-3 min or until all the beads are stuck to the wall, and remove the supernatant (containing the smaller fragments and PCR primers).\nWash the beads three times with 1 mL of 70% ethanol. To do this, add the ethanol while the tube with the beads is still on the magnet, trying not to disturb the beads, and wait for 30-60 s. Afterward, remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.\nAllow the beads to air-dry and resuspend them in 21 µL of TLE buffer by vortexing.\n\tNOTE: Excessive drying of the beads can reduce the yield when eluting the DNA. Aim to resuspend them in TLE buffer immediately after they are no longer \"shiny\" from the ethanol.\nIncubate the sample for 10 min at 37 °C in a thermoblock to elute the library from the beads. Place the tube in a magnet and transfer the supernatant containing the library to a new 1.5 mL DNA low-binding tube.",
    "Quantify the size and concentration by automated electrophoresis (see Table of Materials). Purified Hi-C material can be stored at -20 °C for several months before proceeding with the protocol.\n10. Library capture\nWork with 500-1,000 ng of the library. Concentrate the library by drying the DNA using a vacuum concentrator and resuspending the material in 3.4 µL of nuclease-free water.\nAdd the following blockers from the target enrichment kit (see Table of Materials) to the sample: 2.5 µL of Blocker 1, 2.5 µL of Blocker 2, and 0.6 µL of custom oligo blocker for the adapters.\nResuspend thoroughly, transfer the solution to a 0.2 mL PCR strip, and incubate in a thermocycler for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 5 min at 65 °C with a heated lid. Leave the tube incubating at 65 °C.\nPrepare the hybridization solution by combining the following reagents from the target enrichment kit (see Table of Materials) per sample (13 µL). Keep on the bench at room temperature: 6.63 µL of Hyb 1, 0.27 µL of Hyb 2, 2.65 µL of Hyb 3, and 3.45 µL of Hyb 4.\nDilute 0.5 µL of RNase block from the target enrichment kit with 1.5 µL of nuclease-free water per sample. Thaw 5 µL of the biotinylated RNA per sample on ice and add to it the 2 µL of the diluted RNase block. Keep on the bench at room temperature.\nAdd the 13 µL of the hybridization solution to the 7 µL of the biotinylated RNA with RNase and mix well.\nWhile on the thermocycler at 65 °C, transfer the hybridization solution with the biotinylated RNA (20 µL) to the blocked library. Close the tube lid firmly and incubate in the thermocycler overnight at 65 °C.",
    "​NOTE: To minimize sample evaporation (which may lead to suboptimal RNA-DNA hybridization) when carrying out multiple samples at the same time, use a multichannel pipette to transfer the biotinylated RNA to each library at the same time.\n11. Biotin pull-down and PCR amplification\nTransfer 50 µL of T1 streptavidin beads per sample to a 1.5 mL DNA low-binding tube, place them on a 1.5 mL tube magnet, and wait 2-3 min or until all the beads are stuck to the wall. Remove the supernatant, leaving the beads behind. Wash the beads three times with 200 µL of the binding buffer from the target enrichment kit.\nResuspend the beads in 200 µL of binding buffer. While on the thermocycler at 65 °C, transfer the sample to the resuspended T1 streptavidin beads and incubate for 30 min, rotating at room temperature.\nWash the beads with 200 µL of wash buffer 1 from the target enrichment kit. Incubate for 15 min, rotating at room temperature. Wash the beads three times with 200 µL of wash buffer 2 from the target enrichment kit heated to 65 °C. Incubate for 10 min at 65 °C in a thermoblock, shaking at 300 rpm between washes.\nWash the beads with 200 µL of 1x restriction buffer 2 and afterward resuspend them in 30 µL of 1x restriction buffer 2.\nMix the following reagents to prepare the PCR reaction to amplify the library: 30 µL beads with the library, 150 µL of 2x PCR mastermix with enzyme, 7.2 µL of F + R primers (25 µM each; see Table 2), and 112.8 µL of nuclease-free water.",
    "Perform the PCR with the following conditions (split the PCR reagent mix in 50 µL reactions): 98 °C for 40 s, followed by four cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and finish with 72 °C for 10 min.

Top up with TLE buffer to 300 µL if some of the supernatant was lost. The T1 streptavidin beads are no longer needed.\nPerform a DNA purification using paramagnetic beads (0.9 volumes; see Table of Materials). Add 270 µL of stock beads to the sample and mix by vortexing.\nIncubate for 10 min, rotating at room temperature.\nPlace on a magnet, wait 2-3 min or until all the beads are stuck to the wall, and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads three times with 1 mL of 70% ethanol.
