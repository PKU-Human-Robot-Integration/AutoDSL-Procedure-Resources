    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPre-operative management\nTiming: 10 min\nIn this section, we introduce all pre-operative preparations, including drug administration, mouse positioning, anesthesia induction and maintenance and surgical site preparation.\nAdminister Buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min pre-operative to treat moderate to severe pain following surgery.\nRecord the weight of the mouse.\nPlace the mouse in the anesthesia chamber. Set O2 flow to 0.8–1 L/min with 4% of Isoflurane for the induction of anesthesia and change to 1%–2% Isoflurane for maintenance, depending on the weight of the mouse. Measure the anesthetic depth by testing pedal reflex to avoid insufficient anesthesia.\nTransfer the mouse onto the surgical platform.\nAdminister prophylactic antibiotics, for example Clindamycin (7.5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally.\nUse eye ointment to protect the eyes from drying.\nPlace the mouse in a lateral position with the hind limb intended for surgery pointing upwards.\nShave the hair from the intended site of surgical incision and disinfect the skin using gauze pads soaked with antibacterial Betaisodona solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/981-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Main steps of the exposure of the murine femur\n(A) Lateral positioning and skin disinfection.\n(B) Lateral longitudinal incision along the femur.\n(C) Blunt dissection of the fascia lata to reach the femur using the anatomical gap.\n(D) Placement of a curved arterial clamp below the femur.\n(E) Measurement whether or not the femur is exposed sufficiently.\n(F) Extra exposure of distal and proximal femur if needed.\nExposure of the femur\nTiming: approximately 5 min\nIn this part, we introduce the surgical approach for a sufficient and soft-tissue sparing exposure of the femur, with minimum risk for sciatic nerve injury as well as muscle or skin irritation during drilling and screwing.",
    "Make a lateral longitudinal incision using the scalpel along the femur from knee to hip along the iliotibial tract (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nBluntly dissect the fascia lata between skin and muscle with fine forceps and reach the femur using the anatomical gap between vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscle.\nGently scratch along the femur with forceps or pliers to bluntly remove remaining muscle attachments without excessive damage to the periosteum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: The scratching of the bone surface should be done very carefully and gently. This might also be done with the tips of the forceps only touching the muscle instead of the bone, as the purpose of the scratching is only to remove remaining muscle attached to the femur. Damage of periosteum is unavoidable but should be absolutely minimized.\nPlace a curved arterial clamp below the femur to push away the muscle and skin, which helps to expose the femur sufficiently and avoid sciatic nerve injury (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nOptional: The purpose of using a curved arterial clamp is pushing away the muscle and skin to protect the sciatic nerve. Alternative instruments such as curved forceps or retractors may also be used.\nCarefully expose the bone surface between patellar groove and lateral epicondyle of the femur with a scalpel.\nPut the tips of a forceps through the holes on two ends of a fixator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). The distance between the tips of the forceps approximately equals the total length required for insertion of all pins. Measure whether the femur is exposed sufficiently. If required, proceed to slightly and gently expose the proximal femur (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nDrilling and implantation of external fixator\nTiming: approximately 15 min",
    "It is essential to insert the first two pins in a specific order. Start with the first pin at the distal femur, followed by the second pin at the proximal femur. The order of inserting the remaining third and fourth pins is irrelevant in our experience (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/981-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Order of drilling and pin insertion\nThe optimal location of the drill point for the first pin is the distal lateral femur, indicated by the midpoint between patella groove and lateral epicondyle. Drill the first hole (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/981-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Main steps of drilling and implantation of the external fixator\n(A and B) Drilling the hole for the first pin.\n(C) Screwing a pin into the fixator before inserting.\n(D) Screwing the assembled part into the femur.\n(E) Drilling through the pin bearings in the fixator.\n(F) Insertion of the second pin.\n(G and H) Drilling and inserting the third and fourth pin.\nCritical: Keep the direction of drilling always vertical to the long axis of femur and bone surface.\nCritical: Holding the bone with a forceps close to the drilling point counters the pressure during drilling and prevents the drill bit from wandering. Appropriate pressure during drilling is more important than drilling speed.\nNote: Drilling through cortical bone is commonly described as feeling a “pop” sensation. Feeling it twice usually indicates that a hole through both cortices of the femur has been drilled successfully, which is essential for optimal stability of the pins (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nBefore inserting the first pin to the femur, screw it into the fixator until no thread is visible on the top of the pin (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nScrew the assembled part into the bone until gentle resistance is experienced.",
    "Note: If the hole is drilled according to the technique described above, the fixator should now be perfectly parallel to the long axis of femur (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nSelect the drilling point for the second hole at the proximal end of the femur. Make sure to place the drilling point in the middle of this particular bone segment. Drill the second hole through the fixator (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nCritical: The drill should move within the fixator smoothly and without any friction. Otherwise, the fixator and first pin may suffer shear and/or compressive stress, resulting in unpredictable widening of the first hole and reduced pin stability.\nInsert the second pin (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nDrill and insert the third and fourth pin in the order you prefer (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G and 3H).\nNote: In principle, the direction of drilling for the remaining holes is automatically guided through the pin bearings in the fixator, which is well attached to the femur by the first and second pin at this stage. Practically however, there is still some minor degree of angle variation possible, allowing to keep the drill direction always vertical to the bone surface and all drilling points collinear with the first and second pin.\nAccomplish osteotomy and wound closure\nTiming: approximately 10 min\nPlace the Gigli saw underneath the femur between the tips of the arterial clamp (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/981-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Main steps of accomplishing the osteotomy\n(A) Placement of the gigli saw underneath the femur.\n(B) Recommended pattern of sawing.\n(C) Flushing the osteotomy gap and open wound with NaCl 0.9%.\n(D) Closing the skin.\n(E) Representative in vivo X-ray image of osteotomized femur with external fixator in situ immediately after surgery.",
    "Hold the saw as flat as possible and reciprocate the Gigli saw to create a bone defect with limited width according to experimental requirements.\nNote: Depending on the experimental design and/or research goal, the size of the osteotomy gap can be easily adjusted through employing alternating diameters of the Gigli wire saw. In our laboratory, we usually employ a 0.7 mm Gigli saw for a standardized osteotomy gap which regenerates through secondary bone healing within 21 days following surgery in mice with a C57Bl/6J genetic background.\nCritical: The applied angle of reciprocating the Gigli saw should be as small as possible to minimize the shear stress applied to the femur (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). During sawing, always keep the clamp in situ to protect the sciatic nerve from injury while minimizing the risk for muscle and skin damage.\nFlush the osteotomy gap and open wound with NaCl 0.9% to clean out all sawdust (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nClose the skin with non-absorbable 4-0 skin suture (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: Suture of the fascia lata or muscle layers may alternatively be applied. In our laboratory, we deliberately do not suture these layers as we have not observed an increased risk of muscular herniation or insufficient soft tissue coverage of the osteotomy. Importantly, sutures of the fascia and/or the vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscles may result in tissue necrosis and impaired mobility of the mice, negatively affecting fracture healing.\nOptional: The postoperative assessment of adequate fracture fixation can be performed using in vivo X-ray to rule out inadequately fixated or displaced osteotomies (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nPost-operative management\nTiming: 3 days",
    "After the surgical procedure, administer 100 μL saline into the dorsal subcutaneous tissue of the neck and place the mice in cages preheated with a heat pad. Mice should be placed in recovery racks with a temperature of 28 degrees for 24 h.\nMice should receive adequate analgesia (e.g., tramadol 25 mg/L in drinking water) for 3 days postoperatively.\nPostoperatively, mice are fed with soft food pellets placed on the bottom of the cage. Use long nipples for the drinking water bottles so that the mice can easily reach the water."
