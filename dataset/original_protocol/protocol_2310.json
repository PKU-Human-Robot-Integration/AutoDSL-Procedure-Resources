This method applies to hIOs established from any part of the small intestine. The establishment of hIOs from intestinal tissue is described elsewhere (Sato et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Fujii et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Pleguezuelos-Manzano et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nCritical: It is important to keep the basement extracellular matrix (BME) or Matrigel on ice at all times during culture. Store it at −20°C and thaw it on ice or at 4°C before use. Similarly, tubes containing hIOs should be kept on ice in-between steps.\nNote: hIOs are grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. Culture plates should be prewarmed at 37°C (e.g. in the incubator) one day before plating hIOs. Most hIOs can be passaged every 5–7 days with 1 to 4 or 5 split ratio. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A for hIOs ready to be passaged.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1919-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

This can be achieved by holding the glass pipette tip into the fire for a few seconds while quickly rotating the glass pipette.\nNote: This should result in a reduction of the diameter of the hole to roughly about one third of its original size, approximately 0.3 mm wide (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E for an example of a narrowed glass pipette).\nAfter centrifugation, the gel will appear as a cloudy layer on top of the hIOs. Aspirate supernatant and remove as much gel as possible.\nOptional: If a clear separation between hIOs and gel cannot be observed, it is likely the gel is not sufficiently disrupted. In this case, remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 10 mL ice-cold ADF+++ and repeat centrifugation.\nAdd 1.5 mL ice-cold ADF+++ to the tube containing the organoid pellet.\nSterilize the narrowed glass pipette with the Bunsen burner, attach it to a Pipette controller, aspirate and dispense 2 mL of ice cold ADF+++ twice.",
    "Note: This cools down the glass pipette and precoats its surface to avoid sticking of hIOs and material loss.\nNext, use this glass pipette to pipette the organoid solution up and down 10–20 times. The glass pipette can be placed against the bottom of the tube when pipetting the organoid solution to create some resistance.\nNote: Organoid dissociation ease will depend on the organoid line, the size of the glass pipette and the velocity of pipetting. More cystic hIOs will generally be easier to dissociate.\nPipette ∼10 μL of hIOs into a plate to observe size under the microscope. hIOs should be dissociated into approximately 20-cells clumps (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G).\nNote: Too small fragments, including single cells, will result in reduced outgrowth efficiency. Larger fragments will not allow optimal splitting and expansion ratios, and might necessitate premature passaging.\nCentrifuge organoid fragments at 500 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant, add gel and resuspend.\nSelect a well plate of choice and plate the recommended volume of gel per well (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1919_9.csv\nOptional: Gel can be mixed 3:1 with ice cold ADF+++ to reduce the use of gel.\nPlate hIOs in droplets of approximately 10–20 μL.\nTurn the plate carefully upside down and transfer to the incubator (this will prevent hIOs from sinking to the bottom of the gel, which might result in partial 2D growth).\nLet the droplets solidify for 15–30 min.\nCarefully add prewarmed media to wells.\nRefresh the media every 2–3 days.\nLentiviral transduction to generate doxycycline-inducible NEUROG3 overexpressing hIOs\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "This section is facultative to the protocol, and describes the lentiviral transduction of hIOs. Lentiviruses carrying the inducible overexpression of NEUROG3 can be employed for the production of high-purity EEC cultures. The targeting construct encoding doxycycline-inducible NEUROG3 expression is described elsewhere (Addgene 75337, Zhu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]; or a pLX-based vector in Beumer et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The pLX-based system encodes a constitutively expressed transactivator (rtTA) incorporated in the plasmid. The strategy by Zhu et al. makes use of a separately-delivered rtTA-expressing transgene. Production of lentiviral particles is described elsewhere (Tiscornia et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nCritical: When working with lentiviral particles and lentivirus-infected hIOs, it is necessary to follow biosafety level 2 guidelines.\nNote: Lentiviral batches produced on a 15-cm dish containing 293T cells (50–80% confluency) generally generate sufficient viral particles for at least five transductions.\nAfter concentration of lentiviral supernatant by ultracentrifugation (Tiscornia et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]) dissolve the viral pellet in 500 μL infection medium (EM supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and 10 μg/mL Polybrene).\nPause point: Lentiviruses can be used immediately or stored long-term at −80°C in 500 μL infection medium in a cryovial.\nAbout 5–7 days before transduction, passage hIOs as usual, 1 or 2 wells of a 12-well plate (equivalent to 100–200 μL of gel) are necessary for each transduction reaction.\nImmediately before transduction, prewarm TrypLE solution supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 at 37°C.\nRemove media from desired wells.\nFlush hIOs from the bottom of the well using 1 mL ice-cold ADF+++ and collect in a 15 mL conical tube.\nPipette the mixture up and down ∼10 times inside the tube to disrupt gel.\nCentrifuge hIOs at 500 x g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "After centrifugation, the gel will appear as a cloudy layer on top of the hIOs. Aspirate supernatant and remove as much gel as possible using a pipette.\nOptional: If a clear separation between hIOs and gel cannot be observed, remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 10 mL ice-cold ADF+++ and repeat centrifugation.\nCritical: It is crucial to remove as much gel as possible as it might hamper the following dissociation process.\nNote: hIOs are very sticky at this point and will easily attach to tube walls and pipette tips. To avoid excessive loss of material, coat pipette tips with TrypLE during the following step (and with ADF+++ after dissociation) by pipetting the solutions up and down a couple of times.\nPrecoat a P1000 filter pipette tip in TrypLE before resuspending hIOs in 2 mL of prewarmed TrypLE solution.\nIncubate hIOs in TrypLE for 3–5 min in a 37°C water bath.\nCritical: TrypLE causes cell death and organoid clumping at the bottom of the tube. Flick the tube containing the hIOs while they are incubating in the water bath to prevent them from sedimenting and clumping.\nUsing a narrowed Pasteur glass pipette (see step 5), precoated in TrypLE, forcefully pipette up and down to disrupt hIOs. For transduction, hIOs are dissociated to single cells.\nMonitor the dissociation level under the microscope.\nNote: If single cells are not obtained after 5 min of TrypLE incubation and subsequent mechanical dissociation, clumps can be subjected to a maximum of 5 min additional incubation.\nTo inactivate TrypLE, resuspend the mixture in 10 mL cold ADF+++ supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 150 μL infection medium (EM supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and 10 μg/mL Polybrene).",
    "Optional: If viral titer and subsequent copy number integration are vital for further experimentation, different concentrations of lentiviruses can be used for transduction.\nCombine 150 μL of the resuspended cells with 100 μL of concentrated lentiviruses in one well of a 48-well plate and mix well by pipetting up and down.\nWrap the plate in parafilm and spin cells down at 600 x g for 60 min at 32°C.\nRemove parafilm and further incubate the cells for 5–8 h at a 37°C incubator.\nCollect the cells in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and spin down 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the infection medium and resuspend pellet in ∼100 μL gel, mixing well and carefully to avoid bubbles.\nPlate hIOs in a prewarmed 12 well plate and transfer to the incubator.\nOnce the gel has solidified (about 15 min later) carefully add prewarmed EM supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nAfter 3 days of transduction, cells can be selected (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H shows hIOs prior to selection).\nThe targeting vector encoding inducible NEUROG3 contains a Puromycin resistance cassette. Treat cells for at least 1 week with 1 μg/mL Puromycin.\nNote: Cells that survive after one week of Puromycin treatment are effectively transduced with the targeting vector and can be used for further experimentation. An example of hIOs growing out on the background of negatively selected cells can be seen in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I.\nPassage the selected hIOs.\nNote: Once expanded the hIOs are ready for downstream analysis (see “differentiation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6]” section) and long-term storage by cryopreservation (see Pleguezuelos-Manzano et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] for information about cryopreservation of hIOs).",
    "Optional: If desired, clonal lines can be established with different lentiviral copy integration. This can be achieved by FAC-sorting selected cells (see below). When transduction efficiency is exceedingly low, individual hIOs that grow out can also be assumed to be derived from a single transduced cell and picked for further clonal expansion (see clonal line generation protocol). Transduction of lentiviruses is generally efficient in hIOs with little protocol-induced cell death. Depending on the viral titer (we do not calculate titer but use different dilutions of viral supernatant) of the NEUROG3-coding targeting vectors, we observe 1% to over 50% transduction efficiency. When puromycin treatment is initiated, cell death should occur as soon as 2–3 days. After 1-week on puromycin, non-transduced cells should be negatively selected.\nElectroporation\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nIn this section we describe how to electroporate hIOs. This protocol works in combination with a fluorescent-based selection method (described below). Other methods for selection of successfully electroporated hIO cells (such as antibiotic selection or growth factor withdrawal) will require modifications of this strategy or the use of alternative protocols.\nCritical: Multiple steps of the electroporation and clonal line generation protocols are performed under non-sterile conditions; it is thus necessary to use both Penicillin-Streptomycin as well as primocin in the media to prevent the contamination of the cultures.\nAbout 5–7 days before the electroporation, passage hIOs as usual.\nNote: 200–400 μL gel containing hIOs (e.g. 2–4 wells of a 12-well plate) is required for each electroporation reaction.\nCritical: It is essential for the efficiency of electroporation that the hIOs are growing cystically and have not started differentiation (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A for cystic growing hIOs and 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D for hIOs that have started differentiation).\n24h before electroporation, add fresh media supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and 1.25% vol/vol DMSO, thaw gel at 4°C.",
    "Immediately before electroporation, prewarm TrypLE solution supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 at 37°C.\nDissociate hIOs as described before (step 27–29), to obtain clumps of 2 to 20 cells (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J). Closely monitor the morphology of the hIOs under the microscope until the desired fragment size is achieved.\nTo inactivate TrypLE, resuspend the mixture in 10 mL cold ADF+++ supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend organoid pellet in 6 mL cold Optimem, centrifuge as in previous step and repeat Optimem wash.\nIn the meantime, prepare 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 15 μg of the Cas9 gRNA vector (1 per reaction).\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend hIOs in Optimem, use 100 μL per cuvette or reaction. Transfer 100 μL of cells with Optimem to the microcentrifuge tube containing DNA, mix.\nTransfer the cell and DNA mixture to the cuvette and immediately proceed to the next step to avoid cell clumping.\nAdjust electroporator settings (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1919_10.csv\nUse the electroporator to measure impedance.\nNote: This value should be between 25 and 55 Ω for best results (refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] guide for more information).\nElectroporate cells.\nAdd 1 mL ADF+++ supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 to the cuvette. Precoat the provided Pasteur pipette bulb with ADF+++ and use it to transfer cells to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nLet the cells recover at room temperature for 30 min.\nCentrifuge cells at 500 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in gel mixing well and carefully to avoid bubbles. Plate hIOs in a prewarmed 12 well plate.",
    "Critical: Plating cells at high density greatly increases the cell viability and the overall efficiency. Aim for 100 μL of gel for every 300 μL of starting material. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K for hIOs plated immediately after the electroporation.\nOnce the gel has solidified, about 15 min later, carefully add prewarmed EM supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and 1.25% vol/vol DMSO.\nThe day after the electroporation, check cells under a fluorescent microscope to assess efficiency.\nNote: About 5% of the cells should be GFP-positive at this point (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L and 1M).\nRefresh wells with prewarmed EM supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThree to four days after the electroporation GFP positive cells can be sorted by FACS. Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]N and 1O show hIOs before the dissociation.\nHarvest electroporated hIOs and non-electroporated hIOs to use as negative control.\nIncubate in TrypLE as described in steps 27–29. Closely monitor the dissociation process under the microscope.\nNote: Dissociation is successful when most of the hIOs have broken down into single cells. Complete dissociation of all cellular fragments into single cells is not expected. Longer incubation will yield more single cells but drastically reduce cell viability.\nTo inactivate TrypLE, resuspend the mixture in 10 mL cold ADF+++ supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nIn the meantime, prewet the filtered cap of a 5 mL FACs tube with 100 μL of ADF+++ supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully and resuspend the cell pellet in 400 μL cold FACS buffer (see “media preparation” section).\nUsing a P1000 filter pipette tip transfer cells through the filter FACS tube. If necessary, pipette up and down while pressing the filter to achieve this.",
    "Prepare the necessary 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 100 μL ADF+++ supplemented 10 μM Y-27632 to collect the sorted cells.\nSort single living cells based on GFP expression (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]P). Use negative control to apply correct gating strategies.\nNote: Outgrowth efficiency ranges from ∼1% to above 20% in different organoid lines. A minimum of 300-500 cells are necessary to achieve a sufficient number of clonal hIOs, 1000–3000 cells are most optimal.\nCentrifuge cells and remove approximately 80 μL of supernatant carefully using a p200 pipette.\nOptional: In case very large numbers of cells are sorted, remove any additional excess volume added through sorting to leave approximately 20 μL of cells-containing liquid.\nCritical: It is essential to remove the supernatant carefully and slowly to avoid losing the cell pellet, which will not be visible.\nResuspend hIOs in gel. Use 50 μL of gel per 500 cells.\nDispense hIOs into a prewarmed 24-well or 12-well plate.\nAllow gel to solidify for 15 min.\nAdd prewarmed EM supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nRefresh wells with EM supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632l every 2–3 days until hIOs are ready for clonal line generation.\nCritical: it is important to add media frequently (every 3 days) as evaporation is detrimental for outgrowth.\nClonal line generation and genotyping\nTiming: 3 days\nIn this section we explain how to generate clonal lines from the electroporated bulk and sorted population and how to determine whether each one has been successfully gene-edited.\nNote: Once hIOs have reached a diameter of around 250 μm, usually about 10–14 days after sorting, these can be individually passaged and transferred to a new well to generate clonal organoid lines that will be subsequently genotyped.\nPrewarm TrypLE solution supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 at 37°C.",
    "Bend a p10 pipette tip to a 30° angle (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]Q).\nWorking under the microscope, use the bent pipette tip to pick an individual organoid from the gel and transfer it to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nOptional: If the hIOs are too densely plated, picking a single organoid can be challenging. In that case, transfer a small clump of hIOs to a 10 cm plate and from there pick an individual organoid.\nCritical: It is important to pick hIOs that have not started spontaneous differentiation or that have visibly fused to other hIOs, interfering with their clonality. Spontaneous differentiation can be identified by changes in hIO morphology, such as thickening of the cell layer, reduction of lumen size and budding (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nRepeat the previous step for 10 to 20 clones.\nNote: The optimal number of picked organoids will depend on the targeting efficiency of each gRNA and the outgrowth efficiency after picking, we recommend to pick at least 20 hIOs per gRNA.\nAdd 100 μL of TrypLE solution with 10 μM Y-27632 to each microcentrifuge tube containing the individual hIO.\nPlace microcentriuge tubes containing the hIOs in an appropriate rack and transfer rack to a 37°C incubator. Incubate hIOs in TrypLE for 30 min.\nTo dissociate hIOs, vortex each tube 10–20 s at 3000 rpm, monitoring dissociation process under the microscope.\nNote: Clumps of ∼10 cells give best results.\nAdd 1 mL ADF+++ supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 to each microcentrifuge tube to inactivate TrypLE.\nCentrifuge cells at 600 x g for 10 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant very carefully not to disrupt pellets of cells. Leave about 20 μL of media in the microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Critical: It is important to remove the supernatant carefully; the pellet of cells cannot be observed by the naked eye but should still be visible by placing the microcentrifuge tube directly under the microscope.\nAdd 30 μL gel and plate the material in a numbered well of a 24-well plate. Keep ∼5 μL in the (also numbered) microcentrifuge tube.\nAfter plating all clones, keep the remaining material inside the microcentrifuge tube, this can be used for genotyping.\nPause point: The cell pellet can be used for genotyping immediately or maintained at −20°C until necessary.\nIsolate genomic DNA (gDNA) using a commercial gDNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, always making sure to centrifuge the empty column before eluting the gDNA in order to remove as much wash buffer as possible. Elute in 12 μL MilliQ water.\nNote: Some gDNA isolation kits (such as the zymogen gDNA isolation kit) can be used to isolate sufficient gDNA from little starting material (10–100 cells). Depending on the kit requirements, the starting material may need to be increased by first plating all the cells in step 88 and after these have grown into hIOs collecting some material at multiple locations of the well. Depending on the kit, the elution volume may need to be adjusted.\nPause point: The isolated gDNA can be used immediately or stored short-term at 4°C or long-term at −20°C.\nPrepare a PCR master mix with the following components for the genomic DNA amplification.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1919_11.csv\nMix PCR master mix and DNA in a PCR tube.\nCentrifuge PCR strip or tubes.\nPerform PCR amplification.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1919_12.csv",
    "Note: Cycling temperature and times may need to be adapted based on the reagents used. The annealing temperature will depend on the primers and should be adjusted accordingly. Similarly, the extension step length depends on the size of the sequence to be amplified.\nLoad 10 μL of the PCR reaction in a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and run for 30–50 min at 90V in TAE buffer.\nImage gel.\nIf a clear single band of the correct size is observed, proceed with PCR clean-up according to manufacturer’s instructions, elute samples in 15 μL MilliQ.\nNote: It is possible that in some samples, the two alleles have different sizes due to large insertions and deletions, which manifests as multiple bands. If, however, multiple bands are observed in all reactions, it is probable that this occurs due to unspecific amplification.\nOptional: If more than two bands are observed in the agarose gel, test another primer pair. If also unsuccessful, try adjusting PCR parameters or load the remaining PCR reaction in an agarose gel, cut the band of the appropriate size and perform agarose gel purification (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] guide for more information about genotyping).\nPause point: PCR clean-up products can be stored short-term at 4°C or long-term at −20°C\nTo precisely detect introduced insertions and deletions (indels), it is necessary to evaluate the PCR amplicons by Sanger sequencing.\nUse Benchling or other visualization software to assess the Sanger sequencing results.",
    "Note: In most cases, to be able to determine whether the mutant clones contain out-of-frame homozygous mutations, it is necessary to deconvolute the two allelic sequences. ICE Synthego and TIDE (Brinkman et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]) are free online CRISPR efficiency assessment tools that perform such analysis. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A shows a mixed allele sequence in Benchling. When deconvoluted using ICE Synthego (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), this reveals two alleles, one presenting 1 bp insertion and the other being wild-type. It is also possible both alleles are mutant but contain different indels also appearing as a mixed allele sequence. Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D show the sequencing results of a sample containing the same mutation in both alleles.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1919-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Examples of organoid gDNA sequencing results\n(A and C) Sanger sequencing results of a heterozygous (A) and homozygous (C) mutant clone as seen in Benchling.\n(B and D) ICE Synthego results of the deconvolution of the Sanger sequences.\nCritical: Indels that are divisible by three (such a 6-bps deletion or a 9-bps insertion) will not result in a frameshift.\nPassage the selected knockout clones and a couple of wild-type clones to use as control.\nNote: Once sufficiently expanded, the hIOs are ready for downstream analysis and long-term storage by cryopreservation (see Pleguezuelos-Manzano et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] for information about cryopreservation of hIOs).\nDifferentiation\nTiming: 8–10 days",
    "In this section, we outline how hIOs can be differentiated towards effector cell types. Modified IF (mIF) effectively introduces a mixture of ASC, progenitors and differentiated cells including absorptive enterocytes, the secretory lineage (goblet cells, EECs) and microfold cells (Fujii et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). This condition best resembles the diversity of cell types in the human intestine. However, many research questions demand only (specific) effector cell types. For general differentiation towards (crypt) and bottom villus enterocytes, goblet cells and EECs, growth factor-reduced ENR can be used (Sato et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). To trigger functional specialization and induce the villus (tip) phenotype of all these cell types, we recommend stimulation of BMP signaling with ERBMP (Beumer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Moor et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). For both ENR and ERBMP, the addition of the NOTCH-inhibitor DAPT (further) enhances differentiation towards the secretory lineage (Beumer and Clevers, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Finally, rare EECs are efficiently introduced by overexpression of NEUROG3, which results in an enrichment of 40–80% of EECs (Beumer et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The advised duration of differentiation is 5 days for all these protocols. This roughly reflects the lifetime of intestinal cells that transit from the crypt bottom to the villus tip and that differentiate along this journey. Longer exposure (7 days) increases the efficiency, but at the cost of increased cell death.\nCulture hIOs in EM for 3–5 days post-split as described above (section “maintenance of hIOs[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]”) to grow these to sufficient size (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nOptional: Use hIOs with doxycycline-inducible NEUROG3 overexpression (previously established using section “lentiviral transduction to generate doxycycline-inducible NEUROG3 overexpressing hIOs[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]” combined with steps 102.f or 102.g to highly efficiently produce EECs.\nRemove EM and incubate hIOs in pre-warmed ADF+++ for 30 min at 37°C to wash out remaining growth factors.\nRemove ADF+++ and add pre-warmed differentiation medium of choice:\nmIF.",
