Dead larvae are easily distinguished from live larvae due to severe body curling, which is beneficial to illustrate by taking pictures (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2151-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Susceptible comparison of lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae to SVCV infection\n(A and B) Representative imaging of lgp2+/+ (A) and lgp2−/− (B) zebrafish larvae (6 dpf, n=50) immersed with SVCV (2×106 TCID50/mL) for 2 d. Dead larvae indicated by red arrows are easily discriminated from live larvae due to body curling.\nSterilize the aerated water (system water) by 0.22 μm filter unit.\nTake lgp2+/+ or lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae into two containers with system water.\nAbsorb methylene blue-containing water as far as possible.\nWash zebrafish larvae with sterilized system water for 2–3 times to remove residual methylene blue.\nTransfer 50 lgp2+/+ larvae and 50 lgp2−/− larvae to two 10-cm dishes, respectively. Each dish contains 20 mL of system water supplemented with 200 μL penicillin-streptomycin solution (final concentrations: 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin sulfate) to prevent the growth of bacteria.\nMix SVCV solution to reach a viral titer of 2 × 106 TCID50/mL.\nPlace dishes at 28°C for 2 days through checking every few hours.\nCritical: SVCV infection duration can be adjusted in terms of real-time mortality, which is tightly related to the final viral titers. In our experiments, the work titer of SVCV is between 105–106 TCID50/mL.",
    "Add MS-222 (10 g/100 mL) at a ratio of 1/1,000 to anesthetize lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− larvae, which will stop fish swimming and keep stationary within 1 min after anesthetization.\nTake pictures as soon as possible.\nCritical: SVCV solution in M199 might make system water become red and has an impact on picturing. It is recommended to replace the virus solution with clean aerated water before anesthetizing.\nDeath curve of lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae in response to SVCV infection\nTiming: 6–7 days\nThis section describes how to draw a death curve of zebrafish larvae by survival comparison of WT and lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae immersed with SVCV.\nTransfer 100 lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− larvae to two 10-cm dishes, respectively. Each dish contains 20 mL of system water, supplemented with 200 μL penicillin-streptomycin (final concentrations: 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin sulfate).\nMix SVCV solution to reach a viral titer of 5 × 105 TCID50/mL.\nPut dishes at 28°C. Check every few hours and pick out dead larvae immediately.\nRecord deaths in the two groups every 24 h until one group of larvae is completely dead.\nDraw the death curve by data processing tools such as Prism 8.0.\nCritical: Infection duration is tightly related to the final titer of SVCV virus. In our experiments, the final titer of SVCV is between 105–106 TCID50/mL. The dead larvae should be picked out immediately to avoid water contamination.\nIFN response comparison of lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae to SVCV infection\nTiming: 4–5 days\nIn response to SVCV infection, IFN response is significantly induced in both lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae by upregulation of ifn and ISGs. The subtle differences can be detected by time lapse comparison of mRNA levels of ifn and ISGs between lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae (6dpf) following SVCV infection.",
    "Take 300 lgp2+/+ or lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae to two 10-cm dishes, respectively. Each dish contains 20 mL of sterilized system water, supplemented with 200 μL penicillin-streptomycin solution (final concentrations: 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin sulfate).\nAdd SVCV solution into two dishes up to a viral concentration of 5 × 105 TCID50/mL, and place dishes at a 28°C incubator.\nCollect 30 lgp2+/+ larvae and 30 lgp2−/− larvae, at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 h post infection, to two 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes, respectively.\nRemove the residual virus solution by washing with PBS twice.\nAdd 200 μL of RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen) into each tube, and store at −80°C.\nCritical: To obtain replicable and stable expression patterns by follow-up real-time PCR, the sampling time points can be set more densely to ensure that there are enough sampling points in the early and later stages of SVCV infection.\nThaw all samples after sampling is finished. For each sample at a time point:\nTake all larvae out with dissection forceps.\nAbsorb residual solution on a filter paper.\nPut the sample into a fresh 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube.\nLyse samples:\nAdd 1 mL of tissue lysis solution (according to different Kits. e.g., Trizol-based lysis buffer provided in TRIzol Plus RNA Purification kit) together with several baked ceramic beads.\nHomogenize fully on a homogenizer. Or homogenize samples with other available methods.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer supernatants carefully to fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nExtract total RNA and remove cellular DNA by RNase-free DNase.\nSynthesize first-strand cDNA by random primers or Oligo(dT) primers.\nDetect mRNA levels of ifn and ISGs by real-time PCR.\nAnalyze data with data processing software such as Prism 8.0.",
    "Death curve of lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish adults in response to SVCV infection\nTiming: 6–7 days\nThis section describes the steps to compare mortality rates between WT and lgp2−/− zebrafish adults in response to SVCV infection. Unlike lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish larvae which are easily immersed with SVCV solution in 10-cm dishes, lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish adults (60 dpf) are housed in two tanks at 28°C and infected with SVCV by intraperitoneal injection.\nTake 50 lgp2+/+ zebrafish adults and 50 lgp2−/− zebrafish adults in two tanks at 28°C, respectively.\nInfect fish by intraperitoneal injection with SVCV (108 TCID50/mL), 20 μL each.\nCritical: How to perform intraperitoneal injection is described previously.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] It is recommended to use equal amounts of males and females. All fish should be laid on the same day and housed at the same density to avoid differences in body size. It is best to keep zebrafish fasting for 12–24 h before injection. Virus titers can be adjusted appropriately relative to the weight of zebrafish.\nPlace tanks at 28°C.\nCheck fish every few hours.\nPick out dead fish immediately.\nRecord deaths every 24 h until one group is dead.\nDraw the death curve by data processing software such as Prism 8.0.\nCritical: Infection duration is tightly related to the infected amounts of SVCV. Dead fish should be picked out immediately to avoid water contamination.\nIFN response comparison of lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish adults to SVCV infection\nTiming: 4–5 days\nIFN response is significantly induced by SVCV infection in zebrafish tissues by upregulation of ifn and ISGs. The subtle difference can be detected by time lapse comparison of mRNA levels of ifn and ISGs in different tissues of lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish adults (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2151-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(A) Time course comparison of mRNA expression of ifnφ1 gene in trunk kidney between lgp2+/+ and lgp2−/− zebrafish adults (60 dpf) following SVCV infection.\n(B) The induction ratio of ifnφ1 gene in (A) was calculated based on the fold induction at the same time point, followed by normalization to the ratio at 0 h post infection, which was set to 1, indicating no change.\nRepeat steps 26–28.\nSample at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 h post infection, with 4 lgp2+/+ adults or 4 lgp2−/− zebrafish adults (male: female =1:1) at a given time point.\nAdd MS-222 (10 g/100 mL) at a ratio of 1/1,000 to anesthetize fish, and snip the tail for bloodletting.\nFor each time point, collect gill, liver, spleen, head kidney, trunk kidney and other tissues of WT or lgp2−/− zebrafish adults (n=4) to a 200 μL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube, respectively.\nAdd 200 μL of RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen), and store at −80°C.\nRepeat steps 18–25.\nCritical: To obtain replicable and stable expression patterns by real-time PCR, the sampling time points can be set more densely to ensure that there are enough sampling points in the early and later stages of SVCV infection.\nLuciferase assays to determine IFN response by titration of poly(I:C)\nTiming: 4–5 days\nTransfection of fish cells with poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of virus dsRNA, is believed to mimic virus infection. The concentrations of poly(I:C) correspond to cellular concentrations of virus dsRNA produced during virus infection: low concentrations of transfected poly(I:C) might be analogue to the intracellular concentrations of viral dsRNA at the early stage of virus infection and high concentrations correspond to the late stage of virus infection4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2151-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Luciferase assays to determine IFN promoter activation by titration of poly(I:C)",
    "EPC cells seeded in 24-well plates were transfected with DrIFNφ1pro-luc (200 ng), pRL-TK (20 ng) and DrLGP2 (200 ng). 24 h later, cells were transfected again with poly(I:C) at increasing concentrations (from 0 to 80 ng/mL) for another 24 h, followed by luciferase assays.\nSeed EPC cells in 24-wells plates. Each well contain 0.5 mL M199 supplemented with 10% FBS, to reach monolayers after overnight (8–14 h) culture at 28°C.\nPrepare transfection mixture.\nMix three kinds of plasmids at a ratio of 10:10:1, DrIFNφ1pro-luc (200 ng), DrLGP2 (200 ng) and pRL-TK (20 ng).\nDilute the indicated plasmids in 50 μL Opti-mem, which contain Polyethylenimine (PEI, MW25000, 1 μg/μL of storage concentration) with a ratio of 1:3 plasmid/PEI (μg/μL).\nAdd the prepared transfection mixtures into EPC cells, each well with 50 μL. Each concentration of poly(I:C) is performed in triplicate.\n24 h later, transfect cells again by PEI with poly(I:C) at increasing concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 40, 80 ng/mL).\nAnother 24 h later, collect cells for luciferase assays according to the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA).\nCritical: Cell culture must be undertaken in microbiological safety cabinet using aseptic technique to ensure sterility. Cells can be transfected by other available methods, such as Lipofectamine 2000. To obtain the replicable and stable change in stimulatory trends, the concentration points of poly(I:C) need to be set more densely, particularly within the concentrations of <2 ng/mL in fish cells. Other fish IFN promoters can be used instead of DrIFNφ1pro-luc (zebrafish IFNφ1 promoter-driven luciferase plasmid).\nLuciferase assays to determine IFN response by titration of LGP2 itself\nTiming: 4–5 days",
    "Overexpression of zebrafish LGP2 in fish cells provokes a strong IFN response at low doses but a weak one at high doses, indicating that the function switch of zebrafish LGP2 can be determined by luciferase assays through titration of zebrafish LGP2 itself (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Similar dual regulation of human LGP2 can be detected in mammalian cells only when low concentration of poly(I:C) (such as 4 ng/mL) is present,4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] based on below protocol with a minor modification by transfection again with low concentration of poly(I:C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2151-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Luciferase assays to determine IFN promoter activation by titration of LGP2 itself\nEPC cells seeded in 24-well plates were co-transfected DrIFNφ1pro-luc (200 ng), pRL-TK (20 ng) and DrLGP2 at increasing doses (from 0 to 200 ng) for 48 h, followed by luciferase assays.\nSeed EPC cells (each well containing 0.5 mL M199 supplemented with 10% FBS) in 24-wells plates to reach monolayers after overnight (8–14 h) culture at 28°C.\nPrepare transfection mixture similar to step 38:\nMix three kinds of plasmids: DrIFNφ1pro-luc (200 ng), pRL-TK (20 ng), together with DrLGP2 at increasing doses (0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,1, 2, 5, 10, 40, 100, 200 ng).\nDilute these plasmids with 50 μL Opti-mem, which contains PEI with a ratio of 1:3 plasmid (μg)/PEI (μL).\nAdd the prepared transfection mixture into EPC cells, each well with 50 μL. Each dose of LGP2 is performed in triplicate.\n24–48 h later, collect cells for luciferase assays according to the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA).",
    "Critical: Cells can be transfected by other available methods, such as Lipofectamine 2000. To obtain replicable and stable inducible trends, the dose points of LGP2 can be set more densely, particularly within the doses of <10 ng in fish cells. Adequate empty vector pcDNA3.1(+) is added to guarantee equivalent amounts of total plasmid DNA transfected in all wells. Consistent results can be obtained when total doses of transfected plasmids are used at less than a threshold, such as <600 ng in 0.5 mL/well in 24-well plates.\nBiochemical assays to determine LGP2’s dual regulation on IFN response\nTiming: 4–5 days (for step 46)\nSVCV infection triggers IRF3 dimerization in fish cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). In SVCV-infected EPC cells that are overexpressed with zebrafish LGP2, the dual regulation of zebrafish LGP2 on cellular IFN response can be determined by time course analyses of the change in IRF3 dimerization by native PAGE, and the change in cellular IFN and ISG expression by real-time PCR.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2151-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
