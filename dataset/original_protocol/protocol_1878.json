    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConstructing the EE boxes\nTiming: 1–2 h\nAn EE cage should be designed and assembled to incorporate core enriching elements: cognitive stimulation, complex social interaction, and increased physical activity (van Praag et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]).\nBefore building the EE box, all the equipment, supplies, and procedures described below have to be approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC).\nEquipment and supplies need to be first thoroughly cleaned by the central animal facility, and then disinfected by the experimenters with 70% ethanol just before EE box is assembled and loaded.\nAssemble the EE boxes.\nWe use 30-gallon Sterilite storage totes, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for dimensions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1471-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dimensions and a top view of an example EE box\n(left) EE box converted from a 30-gallon storage box; blue points represent where the feeder is attached on the inside. (Right) a top view of a finished EE box. Numbers indicate different supplies in an EE cage, including (1) cage cover made from window screen; (2) Kaytee running wheel; (3) tunnels made from Grainger vent pipes; (4) Penn Plax ladder to connect the feeder; (5) feeder from a typical automated rat housing cage (Allentown), attached to walls with cable ties; (6) rodent chow; (7) water bottle; (8) toys with varied color, shape, and textures; (9) Kimwipes as nesting materials.\nDrill four holes on the long walls of the EE box according to the locations in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nUse four cable ties to attach the four corners of the feeder to the walls.\nEvenly spread 1-inch thick of standard bedding materials onto the EE box floor.\nFill the feeder with standard rodent chows and a water bottle to provide ad libitum access to food and water.\nAttach the ladder to the feeder.",
    "Spread 10–15 pellets of rodent chow randomly on the bedding materials.\nThese steps are designed to encourage foraging behaviors, which has been linked to the success of enrichment (Hutchinson et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nAdd 10 pieces of Kimwipes to serve as nesting materials.\nOptional: This can be replaced by other long-fiber nesting materials provided by the animal facility.\nPlace a running wheel and up to 3 pieces of tunnels to EE cages, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for an example.\nSee key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for running wheel size information.\nThe orientation of the tunnels and the running wheels are changed together with the cage cleaning in step 20 and 21.\nRandomly spread 6–10 objects onto the bedding materials. At a given moment, the objects in the EE box should be of at least two textures [ceramic (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for examples and general dimension), plastic, or wooden], colors, and shapes (ball, square/rectangular, triangle, etc.)\nChange the types of objects three times a week during weekdays (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). This step is typically brief and does not require the complete removal of animals during the item changing.\nWithin each week, avoid using the same objects for more than twice.\nWhen removed, objects should be rinsed with water and disinfected with 70% ethanol, and then stored in airtight Ziplock bags to avoid contamination.\nLoading animals into the EE boxes\nTiming: 2 h",
    "Duration and age of exposure are critical parameters of EE protocols, as they can determine the success of enrichment, depending on the endpoints being tested (Leger et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). In our lab, 10- or 20-day continuous EE paradigms have been given to male MAM rats and SAL controls. Here we describe important experimental steps for housing rats at different ages in EE cages. This protocol used animals aged between P21-40 and P65-84.\nFor every age group, house 5 age-matched rats per EE cage. (max age in EE box: P84).\nFor the prepubertal P21-30 or P21-40 EE groups, on P21 directly load the weanlings to the EE cage.\nSAL and MAM rats are mixed and loaded into the same EE boxes, and therefore clear marking is essential. Check everyday to ensure visible tail marks.\nMark the tails with differently colored bands using a permanent marker to differentiate individual animals.\nCritical: Since MAM or SAL injection are maternal manipulations, to avoid litter effects we recommend using 1 or 2 representative weanlings of each litter in each EE boxes. This way each EE cage can hold rats from at least 3 litters, minimizing potential litter batch effects.\nFor P31-40 or P65-84 enrichment, on P21 directly load the weanlings into regular environment (RE) cages at a group size of 2 or 3 in a counterbalanced manner for litters.\nHouse these rats until P31 or P65, and then load them into the EE boxes in a group of 5.\nNote: For the duration of our EE protocols (maximum of 20 days), we did not observe biting even in the adult P65-84 group, consistent with the findings that Sprague Dawley rats are relatively “peaceable” (Henry et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).",
    "Place the EE cages on a rack in the same colony room where RE cages are housed for either 10 or 20 days based on individual experimental needs.\nCritical: this step controls for light schedule, temperature/humidity, noise exposure, etc.\nCreating appropriate control groups\nTiming: 5 min, per cage\nEnvironmental enrichment is multifaceted, and its design is based on each experimental need. Thus, experimenters should be cautious in selecting control groups to avoid confounds (Ball et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). In our study, the primary goal was to determine whether there are preventative benefits of EE on dopamine- and hippocampus-related pathophysiology in the MAM model (Zhu and Grace, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]). Since MAM rats display prominent dysfunctions even in paired- or triple-housed social conditions (Modinos et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]), we did not include a social-deprivation control group. Moreover, we did not create control groups specifically for each enrichment element, because our emphasis was to determine whether relatively complete enrichment experiences (with all enriching elements) are sufficient to prevent later pathophysiology in the MAM model.\nWean all the rats for RE groups on P21.\nRE groups are weaned and housed in 2–3 rats per cage.\nSame control for litter effect (see step 11 and 12) also applies, i.e., when possible, each RE cage should contain one representative pup from each litter. No more than two pups from a single litter are included in a single RE cage.\nPlace the RE cages onto the automated rack system.\nNote: Except for the weekly cage change conducted by institution’s animal care staff, rats in RE groups are generally undisturbed throughout the study. However, to control for handling stress, brief handling (e.g., picking animals from home cages, body weight recording, examine signs of injury, etc.) are given to RE rats on the same schedule of EE cage maintenance (see step 17).",
    "Optional: depriving animals from and/or varying certain EE elements can be used to create subgroups in the control animals. This would allow studies to determine the necessary/critical factors (e.g., cognitive, social and/or physical exercise) in the designed experiments. For example, dissociable effects of social vs. physical EE have been tested in rats, and the physical exercise of EE is deemed uniquely influential to brain plasticity-related changes (Brenes et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCleaning, maintaining, and animal observing during EE paradigms\nTiming: 5–15 min\nThroughout the EE periods, perform daily, twice-a-week, and weekly maintenance to the EE cages according to the Steps outlined below. In our study, RE cages are maintained mainly by the institutional animal care staff, which entails a weekly cage change to refill food and completely replace cage, beddings, and nestlets.\nQuietly observe the EE animals daily for signs of injury or distress.\nThis can be done without removing EE cage mesh cover, but if necessary, gently transfer the animals to a separate cage for further inspection.\nInspect levels of food and water for refill.\nThe bedding materials of EE cages are changed/cleaned twice a week.\nA major change is scheduled every 7 days following the initial loading of the animals.\nA minor change occurs three days after the initial animal loading and after every major change.\nFor both the minor and the major cage changes, temporarily transfer all EE cage-mates into a static housing cage.\nProvide the cage with ad libitum water and food.\nProvide the cage with 3–5 pieces of Kimwipes as nesting materials.\nPlace the temporary transfer cages in the same colony room. Perform cage changes in a separate room to avoid potential noise exposure.\nFor the minor change [less than 5 min], simply remove all the feces and dirty bedding, and spread new bedding when necessary.",
    "For the weekly major change [10–15 min], clean around half of the used beddings and replace with fresh ones. Replace all other needed supplies detailed in step 6–8 with new ones. Clean the walls and the running wheel with 70% ethanol and examine whether the running wheel is functional.\nMajor cage change is typically conducted on the same days for RE cage changes to control for handling effects.\nReplace the rats back to the EE cages.\nOptional: cage changes should be combined with experiments such as blood draw, body weight recording, behavioral assays, etc. to avoid excessive handling.\nReturn EE rats to RE cages\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nIn the afternoons of P30, P40 or P84, return EE rats to RE cages at a group size of 2–3 rats/cage\nNote: When possible, counterbalance for litters.\nNote: Rats returned both prepubertally (i.e., on P30 or P40) or as adults are expected to acclimate to the RE cages in a peaceful manner. Thus, we did not find signs of biting during the return of adult EE rats in our study, at least for the duration until the completion of experiments.\nThereafter, rats previously exposed to EE stay in RE cages until the end of all experiments.\nRecord the delay between EE completion and each testing date, as these data could be useful to study the recency effect of EE.\nDispose the used bedding according to institution’s regulations. Inform the animal facility staff to clean the EE cages.\nIn our study, EE cages were reused after cage cleaning and disinfection by ethanol (step 2)."
