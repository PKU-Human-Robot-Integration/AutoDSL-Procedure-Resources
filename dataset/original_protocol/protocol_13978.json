    "All of the animal/VC experiments were approved by the Department of Environmental Health, the Safety Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and procedures were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Experimental set-up and acclimatization to purified, experimental diets\nDetermine the total number of C56Bl/6J mice (minimally 6−8 mice per group).\n\tNOTE: Animals of each diet group will be further sub-divided into exposure groups. Be sure to account for total number of animals needed when planning the study.\nIdentify and weigh the animals. Record these data.\nSwitch diets from regular chow to purified low-fat (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) one week prior to start of the inhalation experiments to acclimate the mice to the new diets (see Figure 1 for timeline).\nProvide food and water ad libitum. Monitor food consumption by weighing and recording the food to be given per cage, and weighing and recording the remainder of the food at each feeding day. If housing 4 mice per cage, provide ~50 g of food twice per week. If housing 5 mice per cage, provide ~60 g of food twice per week.\n\tNOTE: During the feeding of the purified diets, the amount of food should be checked every day to ensure the mice have sufficient pellets. If there are insufficient pellets the mice tend to 'hoard' food and increase the intake. Moreover, especially the HFD tends to crumble much more than the LFD, causing a similar effect.\nMonitor animals throughout the experiment to ensure animal health is maintained.\n\tNOTE: Weekly weight gain and food consumption, along with metabolic monitoring can be done to provide an index of overall animal health.\n2. Vinyl chloride inhalation exposure system",
    "NOTE: There are multiple inhalation exposure systems commercially available, ranging from 'nose-only' to 'whole-body' exposure and manual to automated systems. Data previously published by this group was derived from a whole-body manual system12,23,24. A diagram describing the automated inhalation exposure system is shown in Figure 2.\nEnsure that the diluent air in both the experimental and control chambers is high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and activated carbon filtered, dried and pressure regulated before entering their respective flow measurement devices (mass flow controller [MFC]–experimental chamber, rotameter–control chamber).\n\tNOTE: In the control chamber, the rotameter regulates the airflow to the mice. The air enters the top of the chamber, passes by the mice, then is exhausted under the mice and passed through a HEPA filter before entering the chemical hood. Temperature and relative humidity (RH) are measured within the chamber. In the experimental chamber, the diluent air is mixed with air from a VC tank. Both flows are regulated with MFCs. The ratio of the two mixtures determines the concentration of VC in the experimental chamber. The VC enters the top of the exposure chamber through a disperser with seven jets that point in different directions. The VC passes by the mice and is then exhausted through 12 separate ports that are positioned underneath the cage rack. This chamber design has been shown to provide homogenous toxicant concentrations previously25.\nEnsure that the pressure, temperature and RH are monitored from within the experimental and the control chambers.\nConfirm that the chamber exhaust is passed through a HEPA filter, a CO2 probe, and an activated carbon filter before entering the exhaust area of the chemical hood and that the CO2 level is monitored to ensure the mice are receiving acceptable ventilation.\nUse the custom software to change, monitor and record environmental variables during inhalation exposures.",
    "NOTE: If a manual system is used, the variables described in steps 2.1−2.4 should be monitored and calibrated, when necessary regularly throughout the exposure period.\n3. Pre-exposure set-up\nTurn off all airflows in the experimental and control chambers for technician safety.\nFor each chamber, open the chamber door and place absorbent bedding material (absorbent side up) on top of the excreta pan. Wet the absorbent material to provide a comfortable humidity level (40−60% RH) throughout the exposure period.\nSet the desired exposure level of VC in the chamber. For sub-OSHA limit concentrations use 0.85 ppm of VC. Use either the software-managed, detector-based feedback control of VC delivery to the chamber or use manual adjustments to the system.\n\tNOTE: The latter approach requires knowledge of the chamber volume, chamber refresh rate, airflow and delivery rate of the VC gas from the stock supply; these calculations must subsequently be validated and calibrated by measurements of VC concentrations in the chamber at steady state12,24. The most common technique for measuring VC in the chamber is via gas chromatographic analysis of sample air12,24. The advantages of the software-driven approach regarding accuracy and precision of VC delivery are clear. However, it has been shown that the manual approach is also accurate and consistent12,24.\n\tCAUTION: VC is a known toxicant and carcinogen at high levels. Exercise proper personal protective equipment and handling of the gas while turning on and off the chambers.\n4. Exposure cage and animal preparation",
    "Remove the mice from their housing chambers and place them into the individual cages of the inhalation chamber cage rack (one cage rack for the control mice, one for the exposed mice). Randomize each mouse's placement within the cage rack daily to ensure that each mouse is exposed homogenously within the exposure chamber. Mark each animal's number and cage placement position in the laboratory notebook.\nPlace each cage rack into its respective chamber and close the chamber doors.\n5. Conducting an exposure\nEnsure that the valve for the VC gas tank is in the open position. Ensure that the diluent flow for the experimental chamber is set to 25 L/min.\nStart the diluent flow in the experimental chamber. Ensure the rotameter on the control chamber is set to 25 L/min.\nEnsure that all sensors (flows, temperature, humidity, chamber pressure, CO2 level) are working correctly and displaying expected results in both the experimental and control chambers.\n\tNOTE: The VC flow is calculated and set based on the diluent flow and desired VC concentration.\nEnsure that throughout the exposure, in the experimental chamber, the exposure time, diluent flow, VC flow, temperature, humidity, chamber pressure, CO2 level, and theoretical VC concentration are displayed, graphed and recorded. Confirm that the temperature and humidity for the control chamber are also displayed, graphed and recorded.\n\tNOTE: If a manual system is used, VC flow should be checked and adjusted, when necessary, throughout the exposure period.\nIf any problems occur during the exposure, set the VC flow to zero and increase the diluent flow to its maximum value to quickly purge the chamber.",
    "Once the exposure duration (i.e., 6 h/day) has been reached, the software automatically turns off the VC flow. The 15 min safety timer then begins for the time after duration for the experimental chamber to clear the VC. Once it is safe to remove the animals, click on the OK button in the dialog box. The system will stop recording measurements to the file and the exposure is over.\n\tNOTE: If a manual system is used, the user must manually turn off VC flow at the end of the exposure duration and time for VC clearance at the end of exposure must be calculated.\n6. Post-exposure\nTurn stopcock on the valve for the VC gas tank to the closed position and turn off all airflows in the exposure chamber. Turn the rotameter until no airflow is flowing through the control chamber.\nRemove the doors from each chamber to provide ventilation to the mice. Remove the cage racks from the chambers. Under a hood, remove the mice from their exposure cages and place them back into their housing cages. Transport all mice back into their housing room for overnight housing in regular cages.\nDispose of any waste from the excreta pan into a Department of Environmental Health & Safety (DEHS)-approved biohazard container, as these may be considered a chemical hazard by institutional environmental health services. Clean the chamber doors, excreta pan, exposure cage rack and exposure chamber for the experimental and control systems.\n7. Validation of VC concentration within chambers during exposure\nConduct a measurement of the VC concentration within the experimental chamber halfway through each exposure (3 h).",
    "Break the glass tips on a VC detector tube and a pretreat tube. Attach the flow-out end of the VC detector tube to the detector tube pump. Attach the flow-in end of the VC detector tube to the flow-out end of the pretreat tube with a short piece of tubing. Attach a short piece of tubing to the flow-in end of the pretreat tube.\nRemove a plug from one of the sampling ports that is near the breathing zone of the mice. Attach the tubing from the flow-in end of the pretreat tube to the sampling port.\nFrom the full in position, extend the handle on the piston of the detector tube pump to the full out position. This will pull 100 mL of sampled gas from the chamber into the VC detector tube over a period of 90 s. After waiting the 90 s, push the handle back in.\nRepeat step 7.4 three more times so that a total of 400 mL is pulled into the VC detector tube.\nRemove the tube from the sampling port of the chamber and reinsert the plug into the port. Inspect the color change of the VC detector tube to ascertain the VC concentration within the chamber.\nRecord the VC detector tube reading in the laboratory notebook and compare to the theoretical value. Dispose of the VC detector tube and pretreat tube in a suitable container.\n8. Termination of inhalation exposure experiment\nNOTE: After desired timepoint of exposure, for example, 6, 8, and/or 12 weeks after beginning of inhalation exposure, the experiments are being terminated and animals will be euthanized (see Figure 1 for timeline).\nFast the mice 4 h prior to the time of euthanasia.\n\tNOTE: This procedure allows determination of fasting blood glucose and insulin levels for metabolic analysis.",
    "Use a euthanasia approach consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) guidelines, such as anesthesia followed by exsanguination.\nAdminister ketamine/xylazine (100/15 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection to each mouse to induce anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Avoid sodium pentobarbital as a pre-euthanasia anesthetic, as vinyl chloride exposure may impede its effectiveness.\nCollect blood from the inferior vena cava into sodium citrate solution (final, 0.38%), to prevent blood coagulation and for sample preservation.\nRemove the liver and/or any other desired organ. Dissect the liver and snap-freeze portions in liquid nitrogen, embed in frozen specimen medium, and fix in 10% buffered formalin for histology.\nSeparate plasma from blood via centrifugation and transfer the citrated plasma into a suitable tube and store at -80 °C until needed for analysis.\nTo evaluate histological indices of liver injury, perform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining with 5 µM formalin fixed-paraffin embedded liver sections and obtain images with a brightfield microscope.\nTo obtain plasma transaminase levels, perform both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) kinetic assays on the citrated plasma using commercially available kits.\n\tNOTE: For quality control, plasma transaminases for C57Bl/6J mice should be in the normal range (35−45 IU/L) for the LFD+VC group, while values should be elevated (~150 IU/L) for the HFD+VC group (Figure 3C)."
