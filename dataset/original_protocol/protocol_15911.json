    "This protocol describes how to culture primary hippocampal neurons and mixed glial cells from postnatal rat pups. The neuronal culture protocol, modified from a prior reference (Beaudoin et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-bib-0001]), allows for culturing neurons at low densities without an astrocytic feeder layer. Glial cells are plated on separate coverslips. Although the viability and yield when culturing rat cells are higher, this protocol can also be used to culture postnatal mouse cells, which may be useful to assay fatty acid transfer in cells from genetically modified animals.\nMaterials\n70% (v/v) ethanol (optional)\nNeuron medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-rec-0004])\nPlating/glia medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-rec-0005])\nDissection medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-rec-0002])\nPapain (PDS Kit, Papain Vial; Worthington Biochemical, LK003178)\nP0 rat pups\n0.4% trypan blue solution (Gibco, 15250061)\nCytosine arabinoside (AraC; Sigma-Aldrich, C1768)\nDissection instruments:\n               \nSharp surgical scissors (Fine Science Tools, 14001-16)\nExtra-fine Bonn scissors (Fine Science Tools, 14084-08)\nTwo Dumont-style #3 forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11231-30)\nStainless steel laboratory spoon (VWR, 89259-968)\nIris spatula, 12 cm (Fine Science Tools, 10092-12)\nTwo Dumont-style #5 forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11252-30)\nDisposable scalpel (#11, VWR, 100499-580)\nAutoclave (optional)\n6-well cell culture plates\nPoly-D-lysine–coated coverslips (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0002])\n10-cm cell culture plates or petri dishes\n60-mm cell culture plates\nDissection microscope with light source\nCut 1-ml pipet tips\nSterile scissors\n15- and 50-ml conical tubes\n37°C water bath\n70-µm nylon cell strainer (Corning, 431750)\nMicrocentrifuge tube\nHemocytometer\nStandard tabletop centrifuge\nNOTE: All solutions and equipment coming into contact with cells must be sterile, and proper sterile technique should be used accordingly.\nNOTE: All culture incubations are performed in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\nPrepare reagents for culture\n1. Sterilize dissection instruments by autoclaving or rinsing with 70% ethanol.\n2. Warm neuron medium and plating/glia medium to 37°C before use. Chill dissection medium on ice.",
    "Even if you are only growing neurons, you will still need to use glia medium, which contains serum, to inactivate the papain solution used to dissociate the tissue.\n3. Add 2 ml pre-warmed neuron or glia medium (depending on which cell type is to be cultured) to each well of 6-well cell culture plates containing poly-D-lysine–coated coverslips. Incubate at 37°C before starting dissections to allow the temperature to equilibrate.\n4. Make 2× papain solution by dissolving one vial of papain (∼120 U enzyme for 10 pups) in 5 ml ice-cold dissection medium. Keep on ice.\nAlthough it is best to make this solution fresh immediately before use, 2× papain can be stored for up to 1 week at 4°C.\nRemove hippocampi from P0 rat pups\n5. Fill 10-cm cell culture plates or petri dishes with ice, use lids to pack the ice down flat, and then remove lids. Prepare 60-mm cell culture plates containing ice-cold dissection medium and place on ice packs.\nPlan to use one 60-mm plate per two brains.\n6. Euthanize P0 rat pups by decapitation with sharp surgical scissors.\n7. Hold each head from the sides. Starting at the base of the brain, using extra-fine Bonn scissors, cut skull along the center, toward the front of the head. Be careful not to cut brain itself. Make two small cuts through skull, away from the initial incision.\n8. Using Dumont-style #3 forceps, carefully peel skull off and to the sides.\n9. Using a stainless steel laboratory spoon, scoop out brain and place it in a 60-mm plate containing ice-cold dissection medium (see step 5). Repeat steps 6 to 9 to collect the desired number of brains. Collect two brains per 60-mm plate.\n10. Replace dissection medium in each 60-mm plate with fresh ice-cold dissection medium.",
    "This step helps wash away some of the blood and damaged tissue from the brains. The brains need to be submerged in medium at all times.\nThe #3 forceps and spoon are now considered “dirty” and should not be used for any of the following steps.\n11. Prepare a fresh ice pack (see step 5) to be used during dissection: again, fill a 10-cm cell culture plate or petri dish with ice, but keep lid on this time. Place one 60-mm plate containing two brains on top of ice pack.\nKeeping the lid off the ice pack will keep your samples colder but will cause the 60-mm plate to slide around, making the dissection more difficult.\n12. Place ice-packed plate on the stage of a dissection microscope with a light source. Position first brain upright and hold it in place by gently gripping cerebellum using Dumont-style #3 forceps.\nWe find 0.5× magnification to be optimal for this step.\n13. Gently run an iris spatula between two hemispheres of the cortex to separate them. Use convex side of the spatula to gently open one hemisphere so that the hippocampus faces upward.\nThe hippocampus is the C-shaped structure that runs parallel to the cortex.\n14. With the hippocampus facing up, place spatula between the hippocampus and the cortex. Using the spatula, separate tissue where the hippocampus meets the cortex to remove the hippocampus.\n15. Using a 1-ml pipet tip that has been cut with sterile scissors to make the opening wider, transfer hippocampus in a new 60-mm cell culture plate containing fresh ice-cold dissection medium on an open ice pack (see step 5).\n16. Collect all remaining hippocampi before moving on to the next step.",
    "17. Under the dissection microscope (2× magnification), turn hippocampus, with the convex side facing up. Using Dumont-style #5 forceps, pin down hippocampus. Using a second pair of #5 forceps, gently peel off meninges.\nComplete removal of the meninges is critical to prevent growth of non-neuronal cells. It is best to peel the meninges off as a single piece if possible. Meninges can be very sticky. Be careful not to damage the hippocampal tissue at this stage.\n18. Using #5 forceps and a disposable scalpel, cut hippocampus into four pieces. Using a cut 1-ml pipet tip (see step 15), transfer hippocampal pieces into a 15-ml conical tube containing fresh cold dissection medium.\nHippocampi from multiple animals can be pooled in one tube.\n19. Warm 2× papain solution from step 4 in a 37°C water bath.\n20. Wash hippocampal pieces three times with 5 ml cold dissection medium. To do this, allow pieces to fall to the bottom of the tube and aspirate dissection medium with a 1-ml pipet.\nMake sure to remove any fragments of meninges/debris. They are not as heavy as the hippocampal pieces and will take longer to settle to the bottom of the tube during the washes. It may be helpful to gently disturb the settled hippocampal pieces so that the remaining meninges/debris are resuspended and can be effectively washed away.\n21. Resuspend washed hippocampal pieces in 5 ml dissection medium. Then, add 5 ml of pre-warmed 2× papain solution from step 19. Incubate in 37°C water bath for 20 min.\nDissociate and plate neurons and/or glia\n22. Using a 1-ml pipet, slowly remove dissection medium containing papain. Be careful not to aspirate tissue, as it will be extremely sticky at this point. Wash two times with 5 ml plating/glia medium.",
    "23. Resuspend tissue in 3 ml glia medium. Gently triturate tissue by pipetting up and down, first 10 times with a 10-ml pipet and then 10 times with a 1-ml pipet tip.\n24. Assemble a 70-µm nylon cell strainer over a 50-ml conical tube. Pass dissociated cells through the cell strainer. Rinse 15-ml conical tube with an additional 5 ml glia medium to collect any remaining cells that stuck to the tube and pass that medium through cell strainer as well.\n25. To count the cells and assess their viability, transfer 10 µl cells to a microcentrifuge tube and add 10 µl of 0.4% trypan blue solution. Count cells using a hemocytometer.\nViable cells are colorless, whereas dead and damaged cells are blue.\n26. Split suspended cells from step 24 into two 15-ml conical tubes. Centrifuge 5 min at 150 × g.\n27. Resuspend cells in either neuron medium or glia medium, depending on the cells to be grown, and plate desired number of cells onto the prepared coverslips in 6-well plates (see step 3).\nGenerally, the desired number of cells per coverslip is 2 × 105 for neuron cultures or 1.5 × 105 for glial cultures. Cells should not be kept in suspension for too long, as the cells clump together and the viability can be compromised.\nNeurons secrete growth factors that support the health of the culture. For this reason, plating neurons too sparsely may negatively affect the health of the culture. However, plating neurons too densely will result in a higher number of contaminating astrocytes in the neuron culture, even in the presence of AraC.",
    "Glia will divide, and therefore, more or fewer cells may be plated depending on the timing of the experiment. One consideration is that when glia are plated more sparsely, a larger number of microglia will grow.\n28. A total of 6 hr after plating the cells, replace approximately half of the medium by gently removing 1 ml medium from each well and adding 1 ml fresh pre-warmed medium to the side of the well.\nThe cells will be weakly attached at this point, so be careful not to detach the cells.\n29. The next day, completely replace medium in each well with 2 ml neuron or glia medium.\n30. To reduce the growth of glia in neuronal cultures, add 2 µM AraC to culture medium 2 days after plating (see step 27).\nThis is critical to study lipids originating in neurons. Both astrocytes and microglia secrete lipoprotein particles, and therefore, it is important to have neuron cultures that are as pure as possible. This may not be necessary if you wish to study protein transfer and will express a protein in neurons using a neuron-specific promoter.\n31. Replace half of the medium every 3 to 4 days with neuron or glia medium, depending on type of cell being grown.\nIf AraC was added, this will dilute out over time.",
    "Although mixed glial cultures primarily contain astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes are also present. We recommend immunostaining with antibodies to identify the cell type involved in internalizing transferred lipid or protein (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0004]). Pure glial cultures can be achieved by a variety of methods. Both shaking and mild trypsinization protocols take advantage of the varying adherence strengths of different cell types (Jana, Jana, Pal, & Pahan, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-bib-0006]; Saura, Tusell, & Serratosa, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-bib-0010]). These protocols are cost and time effective and easy to employ; however, they have a small degree of cell contamination. If purity is critical for the experiments, we recommend immunopanning protocols previously described (Foo et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-bib-0003]).",
    "It is important to etch and clean the coverslips before coating them. Etching, in this case with a strong base, allows the poly-D-lysine to adhere to the glass and, consequently, the neurons to attach. Cleaning removes dust and debris from the glass, which is optimal for imaging. Coverslips can be prepared in advance; however, we found that coating the coverslips with poly-D-lysine overnight immediately prior to dissection (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0001]) yields the healthiest neuron cultures.\nMaterials\nPotassium hydroxide (KOH; Thermo Fisher Scientific, p250-500)\nDistilled pure water\n100% ethanol (200 proof; Thermo Fisher Scientific, A4094)\n20% (v/v) ethanol in distilled water\nDental wax (paraffin; color-free, fragrance-free)\n20× poly-D-lysine stock solution [1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich, P6407) in DPBS; store in 1-ml aliquots at −20°C]\nDPBS (Ca/Mg-free; Life Technologies, 14190-235)\n1-L glass bottle\n25-mm round glass coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 72196-25)\nCeramic coverslip holders (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 8542E40)\nForceps (nonsterile and sterile)\nNalgene jars (straight-sided, wide-mouth polycarbonate jars; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 2116-0125)\nUltrasonic water bath\nRazor blade\n60-mm or 10-cm culture plate\n6-well or 35-mm culture dish\nSterile syringe with Luer-Lok tip (BD Biosciences, 302832)\n0.20-µm filter (Corning, 431219)\n37°C cell culture incubator\nEtch and clean coverslips\n1. Prepare 1 M KOH solution by dissolving 56 g KOH in 1 L distilled pure water in a 1-L glass bottle.\nUnused KOH solution can be stored at room temperature and used later.\n2. Place individual 25-mm round glass coverslips in ceramic coverslip holders using forceps and place coverslip holders in Nalgene jars.\n3. Fill jars with enough 1 M KOH to fully submerge the coverslips (∼100 ml). Take care to pour KOH solution slowly so as to not dislodge the coverslips from the holders.",
    "4. Place jars in an ultrasonic water bath, with the lids slightly open to allow airflow. Fill bath with enough water to be level with the KOH in the jars. Sonicate for 1 hr on high.\nDo not fill the bath past the jar lid, as this will risk contaminating the coverslips with nonsterile bath water.\n5. Rinse coverslips three times with distilled pure water by removing the ceramic holders containing coverslips from the jars, emptying the jars, refilling the jars with fresh distilled pure water, and submerging the holders containing coverslips in the fresh water.\n6. Fill jars with 100% ethanol to fully submerge the coverslips (∼100 ml).\n7. Place jars in the ultrasonic water bath, with lids slightly open to allow airflow, and sonicate for 1 hr on high.\n8. Remove ceramic holders containing coverslips, pour out ethanol, and refill the jars with 20% ethanol in distilled pure water to fully submerge the coverslips. Close lids tightly.\n9. Store coverslips in 20% ethanol solution at 4°C until ready for use. When ready, open jars in a sterile culture hood and remove coverslips with sterile forceps to prevent contamination of the coverslips.\nAdhere wax spacers on coverslips for neuronal cultures\n10. Using a razor blade, cut dental wax into square spacers (1 × 2 × 3 mm or smaller; Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-fig-0002], left panel).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bc106331-dbf1-4b25-b6af-e6eda667d3fe/cpcb95-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nFatty acid transfer assay setup. Left panel: Wax spacer size. Middle panel: Coverslip with wax spacers attached. Right panel: Second coverslip placed on top of the first coverslip to make a “sandwich.”\n11. Place wax spacers in a 60-mm or 10-cm cell culture plate and sterilize wax by submerging in 100% ethanol for 5 min. Aspirate ethanol in a sterile culture hood and let wax pieces air-dry completely.",
    "12. The day before culturing cells, using sterile forceps, place cleaned coverslips (see step 9) in the wells of a 6-well or 35-mm culture dish and let dry thoroughly. Aspirate any remaining ethanol to speed the drying process.\n13. Using sterile forceps, place three wax spacers (see step 11) on dry coverslips in a triangular pattern. Press gently so that wax adheres to the glass (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-fig-0002], middle panel).\nPrepare coverslips with wax spacers for neurons. Astrocytes will be cultured on coverslips without spacers. Placing spacers on neuronal coverslips prevents mechanical damage to the neurons when the coverslips are placed facing each other. Be very careful from this point on not to dislodge the wax spacers from the glass.\nCoat coverslips with poly-D-lysine\n14. Prepare 1× poly-D-lysine working solution by diluting 1 ml of 20× poly-D-lysine stock solution in 19 ml DPBS. Filter solution using a sterile syringe with a Luer-Lok tip and 0.20-µm filter.\nSterile working solution can be stored for ≤1 month at 4°C.\n15. Add 250 µl of 1× poly-D-lysine working solution to center of each coverslip. Allow poly-D-lysine to spread over the surface of the coverslip. Put lid back on the cell culture dish and incubate coverslips a 37°C cell culture incubator for ≥2 hr (preferably overnight).\nSurface tension will keep the poly-D-lysine on the coverslips, without spreading to the plastic dish. Be careful not to bump the dish to avoid causing the poly-D-lysine to spill onto the plastic. If this happens, fewer cells will grow on the coverslips.\n16. Wash coverslips three times with 2 ml DPBS and proceed to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0001] (add desired medium in step 3 and proceed with plating cells in step 27).",
    "This protocol describes how to use “sandwich”-style co-cultures to assay lipid transfer from neurons to glia. This protocol specifically follows the trafficking itinerary of the fluorescently labeled, saturated fatty acid analog BODIPY 558/568 C12 (Red-C12) into lipid droplets labeled with BODIPY 493/503 (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-fig-0003]). However, it is possible that this protocol could be used to investigate the trafficking of other fluorescently labeled lipids.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/91ca5ad8-a66b-4b22-9980-99a43b2057b2/cpcb95-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nAppearance of neuron-derived fatty acids (Red-C12) in glial lipid droplets. After the transfer assay, glia were fixed, stained with BODIPY 493/503 (BD-493) to label lipid droplets, and imaged using a Zeiss 880 confocal microscope with a 63× objective.

HBSS plus calcium: Combine 500 ml HBSS, 5 ml of 1 M HEPES (10 mM final concentration), and 0.111 g calcium chloride (2 mM final concentration). Warm to 37°C before use.",
    "Addition of calcium to a final concentration of 2 mM is required for neuronal activity.\nIf storage is necessary, store at 4°C.\n2. 5 mM Red-C12 stock solution: Dissolve 1 mg Red-C12 in 425 µl DMSO.\nIf storage is necessary, store at −20°C and warm to room temperature before use.\n3. 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde: Combine 187 µl of 16% (v/v) paraformaldehyde with 813 µl DPBS.\nStore and use at room temperature.\n4. Warm DPBS, neuron medium, and plating/glia medium to 37°C before use.\nTransfer assay\n5. One day prior to the assay, load neurons on glass coverslips with Red-C12 by replacing half of the medium with 1 ml fresh pre-warmed neuron medium (leaving 1 ml neuron-conditioned medium) containing 1 µl of 5 mM Red-C12 (see step 2; 2.5 µM final concentration).\n6. Approximately 18 hr later, wash neurons two times with 2 ml pre-warmed DPBS and incubate neurons in 2 ml fresh neuron medium for 1 hr at 37°C.\n7. Wash neurons and glia on glass coverslips two times with 2 ml DPBS.\n8. Add 1 ml pre-warmed HBSS plus calcium (see step 1) to glia. Use sterile forceps to lift coverslips carrying neurons and place them face-down onto coverslips carrying astrocytes (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-fig-0002], right panel).\nThe dental wax spacers will keep the coverslips from directly touching.\n9. Incubate sandwich cultures for 4 hr at 37°C.\n10. Carefully remove each neuronal coverslip using forceps.\nIf the neurons are to be imaged, remove the wax spacers from the coverslips prior to mounting.\n11. To fix the glial cells, wash coverslips two times with 2 ml DPBS, fix cells for 10 min in 1 ml of 3% paraformaldehyde (see step 3; protect from light using tinfoil), and wash two times with DPBS.\nStain for lipid droplets with BODIPY 493/503",
    "12. To make a 5 mg/ml BODIPY 493/503 stock solution, dissolve 10 mg BODIPY 493/503 in 2 ml DMSO.\nIf storage is necessary, store at −20°C and warm to room temperature before use.\n13. To make a 5 µg/ml BODIPY 493/503 working solution, dilute 5 mg/ml stock solution 1:1000 in DPBS.\n14. Incubate fixed glial cells from step 11 in 1 ml of 5 µg/ml BODIPY 493/503 working solution for 10 min at room temperature (protect from light using tinfoil) and wash three times with 2 ml DPBS.\nStaining the recipient glial cells with BODIPY 493/503 serves to verify the presence of lipid droplets; this is where the majority of internalized fatty acids will be stored. In the absence of this stain, if no fatty acids were observed in the recipient cells, it would be impossible to conclude whether there was no transfer or whether the internalized fatty acids were too dispersed (for instance, on membranes) to detect.\nThis step can be modified to answer more specific questions: for example, whether transferred fatty acids associate with other organelles, such as mitochondria or peroxisomes.\nMount and image coverslips\n15. Place a drop of mounting medium on a microscope slide.\n16. Using forceps, submerge a coverslip carrying fixed glial cells (see step 14) in water and touch side of the coverslip to a Kimwipe to remove excess water.\n17. Place coverslip gently onto the drop of mounting medium (see step 15), with the cells facing down. Be careful to avoid trapping bubbles.",
    "18. Gently aspirate excess mounting medium from sides of the coverslip. Be careful not to move or twist coverslip, as this can damage the cells. If present, leave excess mounting medium on top of the coverslip in place for now. Cover to protect from light and let dry overnight at room temperature. Store mounted cells at 4°C protected from light until ready to image.\n19. Before imaging, gently clean surface of the coverslip using a Kimwipe and lens cleaner or 70% ethanol.\n20. Image coverslip using a confocal or widefield microscope with a 63× objective. To choose regions to image in a non-biased manner, select healthy cells using DAPI channel.\nBe consistent with the density of nuclei per field of view. Clustering of cells can influence the number of lipid droplets. We typically chose fields of view with 2 to 3 nuclei.\nIf a widefield microscope is used, it is critical to perform background subtraction (see Support Protocol 4).\n21. Acquire a Z-stack with 0.5-µm step size per field of view.\nWe typically acquire 10 images per coverslip. At least one image of the DAPI staining is necessary for quantification.",
    "As primary cultures often contain multiple cell types (mixed glial cultures), it may be useful to stain with antibodies to identify the cell types involved in the transfer assay (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0003]). Here, we describe a protocol for immunostaining with antibodies that recognize neurons, astrocytes, and microglia (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-fig-0004]). This allows assessment of transfer of Red-C12 into different cell types (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-fig-0005]). In this particular protocol, the secondary antibodies were selected in order to perform four-color imaging, including imaging of the Red-C12 from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0003]. This protocol can be adapted to include BODIPY 493/503, as described above, or to stain for oligodendrocytes and organelle-specific markers with appropriate antibodies.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ac6ab3b1-bf52-48ff-b00d-ee467d125ec3/cpcb95-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nImmunostaining of different cell types in culture.

    "If multiplexing with BODIPY 493/503 is desired, no cell type–specific marker can be used in the green channel (in this case, Alexa Fluor 488). When combining immunostaining with BODIPY 493/503 staining, we add 5 µg/ml BODIPY 493/503 along with the secondary antibodies in blocking buffer.\nWe do not recommend directly comparing quantifications of BODIPY 493/503 when incubated for 1 hr with quantifications based on the 10-min protocol described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0003].

    "Phagocytosis is an important mechanism that astrocytes and microglia use to take up debris and dying cells following injury. Phagocytosis of cell debris containing membranes labeled with fluorescently tagged fatty acids can contribute to fatty acid transfer and lipid droplet formation. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between fatty acid transfer due to phagocytosis and transfer mediated by lipid particles. Here, we outline two control experiments to quantify the contribution of phagocytosis of cell debris in the fatty acid transfer assay (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0003]): a cell filtration protocol and a centrifugation protocol. These strategies can be used in parallel to the experiments described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0003]. Generally, neurons are loaded with Red-C12, and then after washing, they are placed in HBSS plus calcium instead of in a sandwich culture. After an incubation period equivalent to that of the transfer assay (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0003]), the HBSS plus calcium is removed from the neurons. Glial cells are then incubated either with the conditioned HBSS plus calcium or with conditioned HBSS plus calcium that has been filtered or centrifuged; as cellular debris and apoptotic bodies shed from dying neurons are roughly 0.8 to 5 µm in diameter, they can be removed by either filtration or centrifugation (Crescitelli et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-bib-0002]).\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0003])\n2-ml microcentrifuge tubes\n0.20-µm filter (Corning, 431219)\n3.5-ml polycarbonate ultracentrifugation tubes (Beckman Coulter, 362305)\nBeckman Coulter Optima MAX-TL centrifuge and TLA-110 fixed-angle rotor\n37°C water bath\nNOTE: All solutions and equipment coming into contact with cells must be sterile, and proper sterile technique should be used accordingly.\nNOTE: All culture incubations are performed in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\nPrepare cells",

    "Here, we describe a protocol for analyzing transfer of labeled fatty acids into lipid droplets (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-prot-0003]) using ImageJ, an open-source image-processing program. These experiments can be performed with a range of imaging modalities. We typically use confocal imaging to analyze co-localization due to superior contrast and widefield imaging with an electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera to collect images for quantification due to greater sensitivity and speed. Background subtraction is especially important if images are collected using a widefield microscope; this allows more accurate thresholding for particle detection (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpcb.95#cpcb95-fig-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/71287f95-70cb-4c6e-bd3a-6a270eefeff1/cpcb95-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nRed-C12 detection to quantify fatty acid transfer. Thresholding in the absence of background subtraction can give inaccurate particle counts. Lipid droplets clustered together in the perinuclear region may be counted as one large lipid droplet, and smaller peripheral lipid droplets are not detected at all. Subtracting a Gaussian blurred duplicate of the original image removes the background, allowing for more accurate particle detection. Depicted here are maximum intensity projections of Z-stacks with 0.5-µm step size acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TiE widefield microscope with a 60× objective. Scale bars are 10 µm.\nUseful tip: You can automate your analysis in ImageJ without knowledge of programming. In the Plugins menu, click on Macros and then select Record before analyzing one image.

This method is, however, required for evaluating the size of nuclei to determine whether a specific treatment affected cell health.\nCalculate number of lipid droplets per cell\n20.

    "If there is a reduction in the number of particles following low-g centrifugation, fatty acids are being transferred by cell debris. If there is a reduction in the number of particles following high-g centrifugation, small, dense carriers such as extracellular vesicles or lipoprotein particles are mediating fatty acid transfer. If there is no difference in the number of particles detected after either low-g or high-g centrifugation, free fatty acids are mediating transfer.
