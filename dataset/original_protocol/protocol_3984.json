    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of genomic DNA\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIsolation of the genomic DNA from the adipose tissue depots\nAdd two stainless steel metal beads per sample to the 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 1 mL of NaOH (50 mM) to the samples.\nLyse the samples for 5–10 min with the TissueLyser LT (Qiagen). Carefully check that the tissue is fully lysed. If, not repeat the lysis for another 5 min.\nShake the samples in a thermoshaker for 1 h at 1000 rpm and 92°C.\nGive the tubes a quick spin to remove any condensation from the lid. It is not necessary to let the tubes cool down to RT first.\nAdd 250 μL of Tris-HCl (1 M, pH 8) to the samples to neutralize the pH.\nCentrifuge the samples at 13000 rcf for 5 min at 4°C.\nA fat cake will emerge on top of an aqueous phase and a pellet will be seen in the bottom of the tube [Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/949-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Three layers of the sample after centrifugation\nOn top of the sample, there will be a layer of fat followed by an aqueous phase and the beads and a pellet in the bottom of the tube. Carefully move through the layer of fat and transfer part of the aqueous phase to a fresh tube.\nThe cooling of the centrifuge helps make the fat cake more stable and eases the separation of the fat from the aqueous phase.\nCarefully transfer 200 μL of the aqueous phase to a fresh tube.\nIf a lot of fat is sticking to the outside of the pipette tip, use a paper tissue to carefully remove the fat before transferring the sample to a fresh tube [Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/949-Fig5.jpg",
    "Figure 5. Fat sticking to the outside of the pipet tip\nIf fat is sticking to the outside of the pipet tip, carefully remove the fat with a paper tissue before transferring the aqueous phase to a fresh tube.\nCentrifuge the samples again at 13000 rcf for 5 min at 4°C. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nTo obtain a 1:30 dilution of the genomic DNA, carefully transfer 2 μL of the aqueous phase from the samples to 58 μL of H2O.\nCritical: It is highly critical to remove all lipids from the sample before continuing with the next step.\nNote: Other tissue lysing machines or methods e.g., the MagNA lyser (Roche), the BeadBug (Benchmark Scientific) or other hand held grinders can be used alternatively.\nPause point: The samples can be stored at −20°C until further processing.\nPreparation of the standard curve\nTiming: 0–1 h\nTo determine the exact number of recombined LoxPRed or ApoB molecules, a standard curve generated from a synthesized plasmid pUC57recloxPRed-ApoB needs to be prepared [Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]].\nTable 1. recloxPRed-ApoB sequence of the pUC57 plasmid\nCTTGAAGCGCATGAACTCTTTGATGACGTCCTCGGAGGAGGCCAGCATGGATCCAGCGCTAGCTTGGCTGGACGTAAACTCCTCTTCAGACCTAATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATGCGGCCGACCGGTAAGCTTATCGATACCGTCGATCCCCACTGGAAAGACCGCGAAGAGTTTGTCCTCAACCGCGAGCTGTGGAGGTGGGGTCCAGGTTGAATCACGGGTTCTTCAGCACAATGCACAGTTCTCCAATGACCAAGAAGAAATACGGCTTGACCTTGCAGGATCCTTAGACGGAGCCGGAGAACCTGCGTGCAATCCATCTTGTTCAATGGCCGATCCCATGGCGGCACAGATGAATTCTTAATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATGCGGCCGACCGGTAAGCTTATCGATACCGTCGATCCCCACTGGAAAGACCGCGAAGAGTTTGTCCTCAACCGC\nPrepare a standard curve from the pUC57recloxPRed-ApoB plasmid with the concentration depicted in [Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]]. It is recommended to test the standard curve by qPCR at this point before assaying the samples. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_949_7.csv\nNote: The standard curve is essential to determine the absolute numbers of adipocytes and total cells. We recommend preparing 500 μL–1000 μL of each standard, so that the full study can be completed with the same standard. Aliquots of 100 μL can be prepared and stored at −20°C. The correct cell quantification depends heavily on stable plasmid concentrations of the individual solutions of the standard curve. The precise determination of the exact plasmid concentration before the preparation of the standard curve can be achieved using a NanoDrop microvolume spectrometer.",
    "Note: The plasmid is available upon request from the lead contact. However, the principle of the method can be adapted either to any other vector backbone or to any other sequence of interest, if another recombination site is investigated.\nDetermination of recombined sites by qPCR\nTiming: 0–2 h\nThe number of recombined LoxPRed or ApoB molecules are quantified by qPCR using a standard curve generated from a synthesized plasmid pUC57recloxPRed-ApoB in addition to primers that specifically bind at the ApoB or recombined LoxPRed site [Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/949-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Schematic description of the quantitative recombination analysis\nThe primer pair depicted in the upper part binds to the ApoB locus and serves to quantify the total number of cells in a depot. The second primer pair depicted in the lower part binds to the recombined transgene at the ROSA26 locus. The primer pair only produces a PCR product when LoxP Stop LoxP casette is genetically deleted by the Cre recombinase.\nPerform a real time PCR with the samples and the standard curve using Fast SYBR Green according to the following protocol:\nReaction per well:Sample/Standard = 2 μL, Primer mix (as described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) = 1 μL, H2O = 2 μL, Fast SYBR Green Mastermix = 5 μL\nRun the Fast SYBR Green program on your qPCR machine [Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_949_8.csv\nWhen exporting the data from the qPCR machine, it is important that the thresholds of LoxPRed samples and ApoB samples are set at the same value. However, be careful to set the threshold only within the geometric phase of the amplification blot.\nNote: We established the protocol with Fast SYBR Green (ThermoScientific). However, also SYBR Green from other companies (e.g., KAPA SYBR® FAST, Roche) or other dyes/enzymes (e.g TagMan, ThermoScientific) compatible with qPCR can be used."
