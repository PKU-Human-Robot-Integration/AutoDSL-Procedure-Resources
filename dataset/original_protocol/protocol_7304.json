    "PTP Activity Assay using DiFMUP or OMFP Note: The following procedure can be used to determine a suitable PTP concentration for the inhibition assays, and to compare or confirm the specific activity of recombinant PTP batches. Thaw the protein stock solution on ice and mix gently.Prepare 50 mL of substrate buffer (SB): add 5 µL of Tween-20 to 50 mL of Bis-Tris pH 6 buffer (see Recipes for details).Note: Store SB at room temperature for no longer than one week. Alternatively, store SB at 4 °C in the dark for several months or freeze for long-term storage. Prepare 10 mL of enzyme buffer (EB): add 50 µL of a 1 M DTT stock solution to 10 mL SB.Note: Keep EB on ice for no longer than eight hours. Prepare 1 mL of 500 nM enzyme intermediate solution (EIS). Use EB to dilute PTP stock solution to 500 nM and keep on ice.Prepare PTP enzyme solution (ES) (100 µL for each) at 1.25× final concentration by serial dilutions from the EIS and using the EB (Table 1). For instance, for an OMFP assay, make enzyme solutions at 12.5 nM (ES1), 6.25 nM (ES2), 3.12 nM (ES3), 1.56 nM (ES4), and 0.781 nM (ES5) for final enzyme concentrations of 10 nM, 5 nM, 2.5 nM, 1.25 nM, and 0.625 nM. For DiFMUP assays, lower PTP concentrations are typically necessary. For instance, make enzyme solutions at 3.12 nM (ES1), 1.56 nM (ES2), 0.781 nM (ES3), 0.391 nM (ES4), and 0.195 nM (ES5) for final enzyme concentrations of 2.5 nM, 1.25 nM, 0.625 nM, 0.312 nM, and 0.156 nM (Figure 2A).Table 1. Enzyme solutions for PTP activity assay table:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\n,OMFP Assay,OMFP Assay,DiFMUP Assay,DiFMUP Assay",

    "Using a multichannel pipette, manually dispense EB and ES into a 384-well assay plate. Add 20 µL of EB to wells A1–E1 (no-enzyme control). Add 20 µL of ES1 to wells A2–A5 (for quadruplicate measurements). Similarly, add ES2 /3 /4 /5 to wells B2–B5, C2–C5, D2–D5, and E2-E5, respectively (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4510/bioprotoc-12-18-4510-g002.jpgFigure 2. Enzyme serial dilution scheme (A) and assay plate layout (B) for PTP activity assay. EIS, enzyme intermediate solution; ES, enzyme solution; EB, enzyme buffer; SS, substrate solution; BG, background.Using a tabletop centrifuge with a swinging-bucket rotor, spin-down the plate for a few seconds, cover the plate with a lid (or with an additional plate), and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Using a 10 mM substrate stock solution and SB, prepare 1 mL of substrate solution (SS) at 5× final concentration. Use a final substrate concentration close to the Km value. If the Km of the substrate for the PTP is not known, choose 50 µM as the substrate concentration, for instance, to make a 250 µM SS. Keep SS at room temperature in the dark until use. Prepare fresh for each experiment.Set up the microplate reader for a 30 min read in kinetic mode (see notes about microplate reader settings).Using a multichannel pipette, add 5 µL of SS to each well (A1 through E5), immediately spin-down the plate for a few seconds, and start measurements using the microplate reader.Analyze the fluorescence intensity data using linear regression and calculate regression coefficients (R2) and initial velocity rate (V) from the slopes, using programs such as Magellan (Tecan plate reader software), GraphPad Prism, Microsoft Excel, or similar. Representative data are shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4510/bioprotoc-12-18-4510-g003.jpgFigure 3. Continuous (kinetic) phosphatase activity assay. Representative PTP activity progression curves using OMFP (A) or DiFMUP (B) as the substrate.",
    "Plots show fluorescence intensity values in relative fluorescence units (RFU) read every minute over a 30 min period for reactions with the indicated concentrations of PTP1B or enzyme buffer (EB; no-enzyme control, background). Each data point represents the average from four reaction wells ± standard deviation (SD). Simple linear regression has been fitted to the data. Values for initial velocity rates V (slopes), regression coefficients (R2), signal to background (S/B), and signal to noise (S/N) are presented in the tables below. S/B and S/N ratios were calculated from relative fluorescence values at the 10 min time point. Note: The main criteria for determining a suitable enzyme concentration for inhibition assays are the linearity of the PTP reaction and the S/B and S/N ratios of the reaction. Linearity over the 30 min reaction can be assumed with a linear regression coefficient of R2 > 0.99. S/B and S/N ratios calculated from raw fluorescent emission values at the 10 min time point should be >10. (The 10 min time point corresponds to the length of the PTP reaction we recommend for the kinetic inhibition assays.) Judging from the progression curves shown for the PTP1B reaction with OMFP ( Figure 3A), we would recommend a PTP1B concentration of 2.5 nM, which yields acceptable linearity and S/B and S/N ratios. From the progression curves of the PTP1B reaction with DiFMUP (Figure 3B ) it is apparent that at the top two PTP1B concentrations (2.5 nM and 1.25 nM) the substrate is completely depleted within the 30 min reaction period. At 0.625 nM PTP1B, the progression curve still starts to plateau after 20 min, resulting in an R2 of 0.98. The lowest two PTP1B concentrations tested (0.312 nM and 0.156 nM) yield acceptable linearity in this experiment.",
    "SHP2-WT Activity Assay using DiFMUP Note: SHP2-WT adopts an autoinhibited conformation, in which one of its two SH2 domains blocks access to the active site. To assay SHP2-WT activity and test SHP2 inhibitors, a dually phosphorylated peptide derived from the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) serves as a surrogate binding protein and is used to activate SHP2-WT (Raveendra-Panickar et al., 2022). The procedure described below determines the optimal IRS-1 concentration for SHP2-WT activation. Thaw the protein stock solution on ice and mix gently.Prepare SB, EB, and EIS as described in section A.Prepare SHP2-WT ES at 2.5× final concentration (1 mL). For instance, for 0.5 nM final SHP2-WT concentration make a 1.25 nM ES: add 2.5 µL of SHP2-WT EIS to 997.5 µL EB, mix gently, and keep on ice.Prepare serial dilutions of the IRS-1 peptide at 2.5× final concentration in EB using a 1 mM peptide stock solution. Choose dilutions in a wide range, e.g., 10 µM, 5 µM, 2.5 µM, 1.25 µM, 0.625 µM, 0.3125 µM, 0.15625 µM, and 0 µM, for final concentrations of 4 µM, 2 µM, 1 µM, 0.5 µM, 0.25 µM, 0.125 µM, 0.0625 µM, and 0 µM (Figure 4A).Prepare eight 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes on ice.Dispense 198 µL of EB into tube 1.Dispense 100 µL of EB into tubes 2–8.Add 2 µL of the IRS-1 stock solution into tube 1, and gently mix.Transfer 100 µL from tube 1 into tube 2 and mix, by gently pipetting up and down.Continue the serial dilution until tube 7.Discard 100 µL of the solution from tube 7.Add 100 µL of SHP2-WT ES into each of the eight tubes and incubate on ice for 20 min.Dispense solutions to 384-well assay plate for a quadruplicate experiment (Figure 4B).Add 20 µL of EB to wells A1–A4 (no enzyme control).",
    "Add 20 µL of tube 8 to wells B1–B4 (SHP2-WT, no peptide).Add 20 µL of tube 7 to wells C1–C4 (SHP2-WT, lowest peptide concentration).Continue with tubes 6 through 1, dispensing to wells D1–D4, E1–E4, F1–F4, G1–G4, H1–H4, I1–I4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4510/bioprotoc-12-18-4510-g004.jpgFigure 4. IRS-1 titration for SHP2-WT activity assay. (A) IRS-1 peptide serial dilution scheme. (B) Assay plate layout. Add 20 µL of enzyme buffer (EB; background control) or enzyme solutions (ES), followed by 5 µL of substrate solution (SS). (C) SHP2-WT (0.5 nM) activity (expressed as initial velocity rate V) in the presence of different IRS-1 peptide concentrations using DiFMUP (100 µM) as the substrate. For comparison, the activity of recombinant SHP2 catalytic domain (SHP2cat; 0.5 nM) without IRS-1 peptide is included. Enzyme buffer was used in the no-enzyme control experiment. The data represent the mean ± SD. Statistical significance of SHP2-WT activation by IRS-1 was determined using the unpaired t-test (n = 4; n.s.: not significant; ****p < 0.0001).Spin-down the plate for a few seconds, cover the plate, and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Prepare SS at 5× final concentration (1 mL). Add 50 µL of DiFMUP stock solution to 950 µL of SB to make a 500 µM DiFMUP SS for a final DiFMUP concentration of 100 µM. Keep SS at room temperature in the dark until use. Prepare fresh for each experiment.Set up the microplate reader for a 10 min read in kinetic mode (see notes about microplate reader settings).Using a multichannel pipette, add 5 µL of SS to each well (A1 through I4). Immediately spin-down the plate for a few seconds and start measurements using the microplate reader.",
    "Analyze the fluorescence intensity data using linear regression and calculate R2 and V from the slopes using programs such as Magellan (Tecan plate reader software), GraphPad Prism, Microsoft Excel, or similar.Note: As shown in Figure 4C, the maximum activation of SHP2-WT is reached at an IRS-1 peptide concentration of 500 nM, which we employed in the SHP2-WT Michaelis–Menten and inhibition assays described previously (Raveendra-Panickar et al., 2022). Michaelis–Menten Kinetics  Note: The purpose of the Michaelis–Menten experiment is to determine the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of the chosen substrate for a specific PTP under specific assay conditions. The Km value is important for the inhibition assays, in which the substrate is typically used at a concentration equal to the Km. This makes inhibitor IC50 values comparable between different PTPs.  Thaw the protein stock solution on ice and mix gently.Prepare SB, EB, and EIS as described in section A.Prepare ES at 1.25× final concentration (2 mL) and keep on ice.Note: A suitable final enzyme concentration for this experiment should be based on the results from the PTP activity assay (section A). Prepare a serial dilution of substrate at 5× final concentration (Figure 5, step 1). Prepare eight to ten different SS spanning approximately three orders of magnitude in concentration. For instance, prepare the highest concentrated SS at 1 mM (for a 200 µM final concentration) and do a 1:1 serial dilution. Prepare the serial dilution in a 384-well plate for convenient transfer to reaction wells, using a multichannel pipette.Prepare the highest concentrated SS (SS1) in an Eppendorf tube. For instance, mix 10 µL of a 10 mM substrate stock solution with 90 µL of SB for SS1 at 1 mM.Add 30 µL of SS1 to well A6 of a 384-well assay plate.Add 30 µL of SB to wells B6–J6.",
    "Add 30 µL of SS1 to well B6 and mix, by gently pipetting up and down.Transfer 30 µL from well B6 to well C6 and mix, by gently pipetting up and down.Continue the serial dilution through well J6.Add 20 µL of EB to wells A1–J1 (no-enzyme control used for background correction).Add 20 µL of ES to wells A2–J4 (enzyme reaction wells in triplicate for each substrate concentration) (Figure 5, step 2).Spin-down the plate for a few seconds, cover the plate, and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Set up the microplate reader for a 10 min read in kinetic mode (see notes about microplate reader settings).Using a multichannel pipette, transfer 5 µL of SS from column 6 (rows A–J) to columns 1–4 (rows A–J) (Figure 5, step 2). Immediately spin-down the plate for a few seconds and start measurements using the microplate reader.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4510/bioprotoc-12-18-4510-g005.jpgFigure 5. Substrate serial dilution scheme and assay plate layout for Michaelis–Menten kinetics assay. In step 1, a substrate serial dilution (1:1) is prepared at 5× final concentration. In step 2, 5 µL of each substrate solution (SS) is transferred into column 1, which serves as the background control and contains 20 µL of enzyme buffer (EB), and columns 2–4, which serve as the triplicate PTP reaction wells and contain 20 µL of enzyme solution (ES).Analyze the fluorescence intensity data from columns 1–4 (rows A–J) using linear regression and calculate R2 and V from the slopes using programs such as Magellan (Tecan plate reader software), GraphPad Prism, Microsoft Excel, or similar.Analyze the background-corrected V values using the Michaelis–Menten equation and non-linear regression, and a program such as GraphPad Prism. Data from a representative Michaelis–Menten experiment using STEP46 with OMFP are shown in Figure 6.",
    "Note: It is important to ensure that the PTP reaction is within the linear range for all concentrations included in the analysis. If necessary, adjust the enzyme concentration. Make sure the substrate concentrations cover concentration ranges below and above the Km value. For SHP2-WT, the Michaelis–Menten experiment should be conducted in the presence of IRS-1 peptide at a concentration as determined in section B. The SHP2-WT ES containing IRS-1 peptide should be prepared as described in section B.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4510/bioprotoc-12-18-4510-g006.jpgFigure 6.

(B) Michaelis–Menten plot using the background-corrected initial rates (V1-corr, V2-corr, V3-corr) for STEP46 from (A). The data (represented as the mean ± SD) was fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation model (eq. 5), and the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) was calculated using GraphPad Prism. The dashed lines indicate the STEP46 maximum velocity (Vmax) and half-maximum velocity (Vmax/2).10-Point Dose-Response PTP Inhibition Assay  Note: We used a Labcyte Echo® 555 Liquid Handler to spot DMSO (for controls) and compound solutions in DMSO (for 10-point dose-responses) via acoustic droplet dispensing. For a standard volume 384-well assay plate with a 25 μL total assay volume, we transferred 250 nL DMSO solution into each well. For manual transfer of compound stock solutions using a pipette, we recommend transferring no less than 1 μL (for accuracy reasons) and keeping the final DMSO concentration ≤5%. We recommend testing a wide range of compound concentrations of at least four log steps (e.g., 100, 33, 11, 3.7, 1.",
    "2, 0.41, 0.14, 0.045, 0.015, 0.005 μM final compound concentration). The provided volumes for ES and SS are for testing of up to four 384-well assay plates and may be adjusted according to needs.  Prepare a black, standard volume 384-well assay plate. Spot 250 nL of DMSO into negative and positive control wells (columns 1 and 2, respectively). Spot 250 nL of compound DMSO solutions in triplicate into columns 3–23.Note: The total number of compounds that can be tested per 384-well plate is 11 (see Figure 7A for the plate map). Thaw the protein stock solution on ice and mix gently.Prepare SB (50 mL): add 5 µL of Tween-20 to 50 mL of Bis-Tris pH 6 buffer (see Recipes for details).Note: Store SB at room temperature for no longer than one week. Prepare EB (50 mL): add 250 µL of a 1 M DTT stock solution to 50 mL of SB.Note: Keep EB on ice for no longer than eight hours. Prepare 500 nM EIS (1 mL). Use EB to dilute PTP stock solution to 500 nM and keep on ice.Prepare ES (approximately 45 mL) at 1.25× final concentration in a 50 mL conical tube. For instance, for 2.5 nM final PTP concentration, add 290 µL of EIS to 46.11 mL of EB, mix gently, and keep on ice.Note: A suitable final enzyme concentration for the inhibition assay should be based on the results from the PTP activity assay (section A). For experiments with OMFP, we typically use 2.5 or 5 nM PTP final concentration. For experiments with DiFMUP, we typically use ≤0.5 nM PTP final concentration. Prepare SS (approximately 15 mL) at 5× final substrate concentration in a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "For instance, for a 6 µM final substrate concentration, add 45 µL of the 10 mM substrate stock solution to 14.955 mL of SB, mix, and store at room temperature in the dark until use. Note: The final substrate concentration for a specific PTP is determined by the substrate Km value obtained in the Michaelis–Menten experiment (section C).  Using a multichannel pipette, add 20 µL of EB to column 2 (positive control) of the spotted 384-well assay plate.Using a MultidropTM Combi reagent dispenser, add 20 µL of ES to all wells, except those in column 2.Using a tabletop centrifuge with a swinging-bucket rotor, spin-down the plate for a few seconds, cover the plate with a lid (or with an additional plate), and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Set up the microplate reader for a 10 min read in kinetic mode (see notes about microplate reader settings).Using a MultidropTM Combi reagent dispenser, add 20 µL of SS to the entire plate, immediately spin-down the plate for a few seconds, and start measurements using the microplate reader.Analyze the fluorescence intensity data using linear regression and calculate R2 and V from the slopes using programs such as Magellan (Tecan plate reader software), GraphPad Prism, Microsoft Excel, or similar. Make sure the linearity of the PTP reaction is acceptable and Z’ values are ≥0.5. For details on Z’-factor definition, please see the Data analysis section below.Normalize the initial velocity rates using the positive (100% inhibition) and negative (0% inhibition) control values and analyze the normalized data using a nonlinear regression dose-response inhibition model (log inhibitor vs. response, variable slope, four parameters) using programs such as GraphPad Prism or CBIS, to obtain IC50 values. Data from a representative 10-point dose-response inhibition assay for VHR with OMFP are shown in Figure 7.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4510/bioprotoc-12-18-4510-g007.jpgFigure 7.",
