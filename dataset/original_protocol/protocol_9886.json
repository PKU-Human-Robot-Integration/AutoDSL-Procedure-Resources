    "NOTE: The instrument temperature must be set according to the bacterium used at least a day in advance to ensure stability of the system. Here, Acinetobacter baumannii DSM30008 samples are run at 30 °C.\n1. Culture preparation\nStreak out the strain under investigation (here: A. baumannii) on a CASO agar plate and incubate overnight in a static incubator at 30 °C.\nPrepare an overnight culture by inoculating a single colony in MHB (Mueller-Hinton broth) and incubate on a shaking incubator at 180 rpm at 30 °C.\n2. Sample preparation\nUse 1.5 mL tubes to prepare the concentration range of selected drug or compound (e.g., by adding 1.5 µL of 100x stock solutions in DMSO; see step 2.3).\nDilute the overnight culture in MHB medium.\n\t\nMeasure the optical density of the overnight culture using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm.\nDilute the culture to obtain 5 x 105 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in fresh MHB medium. An OD600 of one equals approximately 5 x 108 CFU/mL (e.g., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, A. baumannii).\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to calibrate the conversion factor OD600 to CFU/mL for each individual bacterial strain under the applied culturing conditions.\nAdd 150 µL of the cells to the test tubes prepared in step 2.1, ensuring correct final concentration of tested drug or compound and correct final cell concentration.\nMix the compound with the cells by vortexing.",
    "NOTE: The sample plate (see Table of Materials) has six rows, each containing eight wells, a total of 48-wells; Row A and Row F are the thermodynamic reference. Therefore, no samples can be loaded into those wells, corresponding media is loaded into those wells. 32 test samples can be measured per run, using wells in rows B-E. Individual test sample should be run at minimum in duplicate (here: all samples were run as triplicates). Growth controls should be included.\n3. Insert preparation\nTransfer 120 µL from the mixture prepared in step 2.4 to the plastic inserts.\n\tNOTE: Use reverse pipetting in step 3.1 to prevent liquid from spraying on the sides of the plastic inserts, which can lead to interference with correct signal readouts.\nPlace all titanium vials into the holders (see Table of Materials) with tweezers.\nGently transfer inserts into the titanium vials in the holder plate.\nLoosely place titanium lids on all titanium vials.\n4. Insert loading\nTransfer the holder with titanium cups onto the sample station and place on designated area.\nUse the torque wrench, set to 40 cNm force, to tighten all the lids.\n5. Running of samples\nIn calView software, start a new experiment (Supplemental Figure 1).\nRetract the sample insertion arm from the instrument.\nPlace the cup holder on the “bridge”, column 8 facing the sample insertion opening and gently push the cup holder into the instrument at the designated “Position 1”. Wait 10 minutes for the system to stabilize. Label the experimental wells.\nPush the sample insertion arm until the cup holder is at the designated “Position 2”. Wait 20 minutes for the system to stabilize.",
    "Push the sample insertion arm into “Position 3” and retract the sample insertion arm until it is at the “Running position”. Highlight all the wells in the software and select Reaction Start (Supplemental Figure 4).\nRun the experiment until the heat emission reads are stably back at zero.\n\tNOTE: Be sure that all wells behave similar within these steps. Supplemental Figure 5 illustrates what should be observed if the wells are loaded correctly. If loaded incorrectly, repeat steps 5.2-5.4.\n6. Remove the cup holder\nIn the software, select Stop (Supplemental Figure 6). The software will then ask if “you are sure”, select Yes (Supplemental Figure 7) and save the experiment on a drive or desktop for data analysis (Supplemental Figure 8).\nInsert the sample insertion arm completely into the instrument and engage the magnets to retrieve the cup holder.\nLoosen the lids, remove the inserts and place vials and lids into glass holders and place for 4 hours at 180 °C followed by placing the vials and lids into a desiccator to ensure lids and vials are dry.\n7. Analyzing data\nOpen the software (Supplemental Figure 9), select Open experiment in the left upper corner (Supplemental Figure 10). In the popup window select the experiment of interest and press Open (Supplemental Figure 11). The application will open the experiment in default wells view (Supplemental Figure 12).\nPress Select all or Ctrl+A (Supplemental Figure 13).",
    "Press Define Baseline, this parameter normalizes the data in each position (Supplemental Figure 14). In the popup window select a time period of >30 min located in the lag phase (the heat flow has to be low, between zero and ten µW; Supplemental Figure 15). After selection of base line time period the chosen baseline will appear in green in the thermogram. Close the Define Baseline Section window.\nPress Save or Ctrl+S and close the software (Supplemental Figure 16).\nOpen web-based Symcel Calorimetry analysis application (https://symcel.shinyapps.io/symcel_calorimetricgrowth/).\nTo upload the file to the Calorimetry analysis application, press Browse (Supplemental Figure 17), select the experiment and press Open (Supplemental Figure 18). The metabolic parameters will be calculated automatically for the 32 samples in the web application (Supplemental Figure 19).\nIn order to fit the heat Flow data to Gompertz and/or Richard´s growth models click Growth Function. Growth models fit will be displayed in the section “Cumulative”, also compared to the raw data in the section “Flow” (Supplemental Figure 20).\nTo download all calculated parameters, press Download Measures. Select the file location and press Save (Supplemental Figure 21). The file will be exported to a spreadsheet for further calculations."
