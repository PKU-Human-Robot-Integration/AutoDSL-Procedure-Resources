    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nNuclei Extraction from Cardiac Tissues\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step isolates nuclei from freshly dissected mouse heart tissue.\nTransfer 50-100 mg freshly dissected mouse heart tissue into a 10 cm dish on ice and mince into small pieces (around 1 mm3 cube) with razor blade washed in ethanol.\nNote: If using neonatal hearts, multiple heart samples can be pooled to get enough starting material.\nNote: The minced tissue should be easily resuspended in PBS without seeing large connected tissue pieces (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/96-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Nucleus Extraction from Cardiac Tissues\n(A) Representative image showing heart tissues after being sufficiently minced.\n(B) Images showing heart tissues before (left) and after (right) red blood cell lysis.\n(C) Image of homogenized heart tissues during nucleus extraction.\n(D) Brightfield images showing nuclear extract stained with Trypan blue. Scale bar, 20 μm.\n(E) Image showing nuclear pellet after centrifugation.\nResuspend the minced tissue in 5 mL PBS and transfer into a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge the tube at 500 × g for 2 min at 20°C–22°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the tissue pellet in 2 mL 1× Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer. Vortex the tube for 20 s and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 2 min. Add 2 mL PBS to stop the lysis and centrifuge the sample at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Critical: The heart is a highly vascularized organ; it is preferable to deplete red blood cells in the samples as the presence of red blood cells can significantly slow down the isolation of cardiomyocyte nucleus during flow cytometry sorting (step 14). (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). It is critical to perform the red blood cell lysis step before proceeding to nucleus extraction, as the ammonium chloride in the lysis buffer will also lyse nuclei after they are extracted.\nWash the tissue pellet in 5 mL ice cold PBS. After centrifugation, resuspend the tissue in 5 mL Lysis Buffer and transfer to a 20 mL Dounce homogenizer placed on ice. Homogenize the tissue suspension with a type A pestle on ice for 15–20 strokes until no major tissue chunks are visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTake 10 μL of the sample and check under microscope with Trypan blue to evaluate the nucleus extraction efficiency. Expect to see most nuclei separated and stained in blue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nOnce nucleus extraction is complete, filter the lysate first through a 70 μm strainer then pass over the flow-through onto a 40 μm cell strainer and centrifuge the flow-through at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet nuclei.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the nuclear pellet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL Sucrose Buffer. In a separate tube, aliquot 4 mL Sucrose Buffer and carefully transfer the nuclear suspension on top. Centrifuge the cushioned suspension at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet nuclei.\nNote: Centrifugation of the nuclear extract on sucrose cushion helps to clear out the tissue debris resulting from homogenization.",
    "Wash the nuclear pellet with 1 mL Nuclei Storage Buffer and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Resuspend the nuclei in 1 mL Nuclei Storage Buffer and keep on ice.\nNote: If cardiomyocyte enrichment is not required, you can resuspend the extracted nuclei in 200 μL of 2% BSA/PBS and proceed directly to step 16 for library preparation to profile total nuclei in the heart.\nNote: Nuclei Storage Buffer contains KCl and MgCl2, which help the viability of the nuclei. When processing multiple samples, nuclei can be stored in Nuclei Storage Buffer on ice for up to 12 h before proceeding to the next steps.\nPurify Diploid and Tetraploid Cardiomyocyte Nuclei by Cell Sorting\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step enriches diploid and tetraploid cardiomyocyte nuclei by immunolabeling of the cardiomyocyte-specific nuclear membrane protein PCM1 and Hoechst staining for DNA content.\nDivide the nuclear suspension from step 8 into four tubes labeled as “unstained”, “PCM1”, “Hoechst”, and “PCM1+Hoechst”. In the “PCM1” and “PCM1+Hoechst” tubes, add anti-PCM1 antibody at a 1:200 dilution. Incubate the nuclei on a rotator for 45 min at 4°C. Leave the other two tubes on ice.\nAfter the incubation, centrifuge the “PCM1” and “PCM1+Hoechst” tubes at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, wash twice with Nuclei Storage Buffer, and resuspend in 1 mL Nuclei Storage Buffer.\nTo all tubes, add secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 at 1:500 dilution and incubate the nuclei on a rotator for 30 min at 4°C.\nWash the nuclei twice with 1 mL Nucleus Storage Buffer and resuspend in 500 μL 2% BSA/PBS. Only to “Hoechst” and “PCM1+Hoechst” tubes, add Hoechst at a 1:2,000 dilution and incubate for 10 min at 20°C–22°C.",
    "Wash the nuclei twice with 1 mL 2% BSA/PBS and resuspend in 500 μL 2% BSA/PBS for FACS.\nSort the nuclei using a cell-sorter (e.g. BD FACSARIA). Gate single nuclei with the FSC-H versus FCS-W plot and the SSC-H versus SSC-W plot to avoid doublets. Use the “unstained” and “PCM1” samples to gate for PCM1+ nuclei. Use “unstained” and “Hoechst” samples to gate for diploid (2n) and tetraploid (4n) nuclei (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). From the “PCM1+Hoechst” sample, sort a minimum of 20,000 PCM1+ 2n and PCM1+ 4n nuclei into 1.5 mL tubes containing 500 μL of 2% BSA/PBS.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/96-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating strategy for Isolation of Diploid and Triploid Cardiomyocyte Nuclei\nRepresentative flow cytometry plots for immunolabeling of pooled heart samples collected at P4 with antibody against PCM1 to label cardiomyocyte nuclei and Hoechst for DNA staining.\n(A–D) Unstained sample (A) and samples only stained for PCM1 (B) or Hoechst (C) were used as negative controls for gating. 2n cardiomyocytes and 4n cardiomyocytes are identified in samples stained with both Hoechst and PCM1 antibody (D). The different fluorescent intensities (y-axis) of Hoechst staining indicate the difference in DNA ploidy (2n vs 4n).\nAfter sorting, pellet the PCM1+ nuclei at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C , resuspend in 20 μL of 2% BSA/PBS, and immediately process to the next step.\nNote: Perform all washes at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCritical: PCM1 signal intensity may vary between sample preparations, thus it is important to individually gate the samples using their own unstained and single-color controls.\nLibrary Preparation for Single-Nucleus RNA-Sequencing\nTiming: 2–3 days\nCount number of nuclei and prepare single-nucleus RNA-sequencing libraries.",
    "Transfer 10 μL of nuclear suspension to a microscope slide and mount with a glass cover slide. Inspect the integrity and purity of cardiomyocyte nuclei under fluorescent microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In a separate tube, mix 10 μL nuclear suspension with 10 μL Trypan blue. Take 10 μL of the mixture and count nuclei manually twice using hemocytometer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/96-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Immunofluorescent Images of Nuclei after Flow Cytometry Sorting\nPCM1 positive nuclei are shown in violet. Hoechst staining is shown in blue. High magnification images of boxed areas are shown in panel on right. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nDilute the nuclei to 1,000 nuclei/μL with 2% BSA /PBS. Immediately load 6,000 nuclei to each reaction mix for single-cell partitioning and reverse transcription following the manufacturer’s instructions from 10X Genomics.\nPrepare single-nucleus RNA-sequencing libraries according to the manufacturer’s instructions from 10X Genomics (v2 or v3 chemistry, https://www.salk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/10XUserGuide.pdf[href=https://www.salk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/10XUserGuide.pdf])\nPerform sequencing using the 150-bp high output sequencing kit (Illumina), with the following pair-end sequencing settings: Read1, 26 cycles; i7 index, 8 cycles; Read2, 124 cycles.\nNote: Library preparation is prone to batch-to-batch variation. Therefore, plan experiments ahead so that samples can be collected on the same day and processed together for library preparation."
