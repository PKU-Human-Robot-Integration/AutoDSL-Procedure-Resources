    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: If both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolation and red blood cell lysis are performed from the same sample in parallel, it is necessary to split the samples in 2 aliquots. The respective volumes depend on the starting material and should be adjusted to the required material for downstream applications.\nRed blood cell (RBC) lysis\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this section, the RBC lysis procedure to prepare whole blood samples for scRNA-seq and FACS from blood of COVID-19 patients is described.\nPreparation of the RBC lysis solution\nDilute 1:9 the 10× RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend) in sterile ddH2O freshly before use\nRed blood cell lysis\nTransfer the blood tube in the biological hood and gently transfer 1 mL of blood to a 50 mL Falcon\nUsing a serological pipette carefully add 10 mL of 1× RBC lysis buffer\nShortly vortex the Falcon and incubate for 10 min between 20°C–22°C\nDilute the cell solution in RBC lysis buffer by adding 40 mL of PBS\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 10 min, 4°C, following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in the desired volume of PBS\nCount the cells following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nPBMC purification using density-gradient centrifugation\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this section the procedure to purify PBMC from blood of COVID-19 patients is described. Special emphasis will be paid on the necessary steps to avoid contamination of the working area and infection of the experimenter.\nPreparation of the necessary materials\nFor each sample prepare and label two 50 mL Falcons, fill one of the tubes with 10 mL of Pancoll pre-warmed to between 20°C–22°C and one with 20 mL PBS\nLabel the tubes with all necessary information (PBS, Pancoll, sample ID, etc.)",
    "Pancoll density-gradient centrifugation\nMove the blood tube under the laminar flow hood\nTransfer the content (maximum 20 mL) to a new 50 mL Falcon and add an equal volume of PBS\nGently overlay the diluted blood onto 10 mL Pancoll (pre-filled tubes) following the manufacturer’s protocol\nCentrifuge at 700 × g 25 min, 20°C, without breaks, following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nAfter centrifugation, take the Falcon out of the centrifugation bucket under the hood and carefully collect the PBMC fraction into a 50 mL Falcon pre-filled with PBS using a serological pipette\nNote: PBS volume should be two volumes of the expected PBMC fraction; final volume should be adjusted accordingly.\nCritical: Prevent mixing of the density phases to avoid contamination of the PBMC fraction with erythrocytes and granulocytes.\nCentrifuge cells at 300 × g for 10 min, 4°C, following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the PBMC in the desired volume of complete RPMI\nCount the cells following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nCryopreservation of PBMC samples (optional)\nIn this section we describe how to store PBMC samples for long-term sample acquisition and processing for scRNA-seq. Cells are stored in DMSO-supplemented freezing media in liquid nitrogen.\nPreparation of required media and equipment\n2× freezing medium: RPMI1640 supplemented with 40% FBS and 20% DMSO\nResuspension medium: RPMI1640 supplemented with 40% FBS\nChill a cell freezing container in a 4°C refrigerator\nCryovials\nCryopreservation Protocol\nPrepare and label cryovials, open them, and place them on ice in the hood\nCentrifuge the purified PBMC at 300 × g for 5 min, 4°C, following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nResuspend the cell pellet in an appropriate volume of chilled resuspension medium to achieve a cell concentration of ∼2–10 × 106 cells/mL (maintain the cells on ice)",
    "Gently add an equivalent volume of chilled 2× freezing medium to achieve a cell concentration of ∼1–5 × 106 cells/mL\nGently mix the cells\nDispense 1 mL aliquots of the cell suspension into the cryovials on ice\nClose the cryovials with the corresponding lid\nRemove the chilled cell freezing container from the 4°C refrigerator and place it in the hood\nWipe each cryovial with Terralin PAA and place inside the cell freezing container\nWipe the outside of the cell freezing container with Terralin PAA\nMove the container out of the hood and place it in a −80°C freezer for minimum 12 h, ensure that the bottom and top vents of the container are not obstructed to allow adequate air flow\nTransfer the cryovials to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage\nThawing procedure:\nRemove cryovial(s) from liquid nitrogen storage and transport immediately on ice in the hood\nThaw the samples in a reservoir containing water at 37°C for 2–3 min\nGently transfer thawed cell suspension into an empty 50 mL Falcon using a 1 mL pipette tip (If possible, use wide-bore tips for the complete thawing procedure)\nRinse the cryovial with 1 mL warm complete RPMI and add the medium dropwise to the 50 mL Falcon containing the cell suspension while gently shaking the Falcon\nNote: Dropwise addition of medium allows the cells sufficient time for a gradual loss of DMSO and therefore prevents osmotic lysis.\nSerially dilute the cells with complete RPMI a total of 4 times by 1:1 volume addition with approximately 1 min wait between additions (final volume: 32 mL)\nPut all 50 mL Falcons in a centrifuge bucket inside the hood and close the lid\nCentrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min between 20 and 22°C, following the above-mentioned safety instructions",
    "Remove most of the supernatant, leaving ∼1 mL and resuspend cell pellet in this volume using a 1 mL pipette tip\nAdd an additional 4 mL complete growth medium to achieve a total volume of ∼5 mL\nProceed to count viable cells as described above and adjust the cell concentration according to the downstream protocol\nOligo-coupled antibody-based sample multiplexing (and optionally AbSeq)\nTiming: from 1 h to 3 h\nIn this section the staining with universal antibodies conjugated to unique polyadenylated DNA barcodes (sample tags) is described. The use of sample tags allows multiplexing of up to 12 samples reducing potential technical batch effects. Furthermore, multiplexing of samples significantly reduces the time and costs of the library preparation and sequencing processes. After the sample tag labeling, an optional step can be introduced to detect surface protein expression. This protocol is termed AbSeq by BD and is based on a second staining using currently up to 100 selected antibodies conjugated to oligonucleotides (Ab-Oligos) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Cells can be either co-labeled with sample tag and Ab-Oligos concurrently in the same tube or labeled sequentially. The latter allows reducing the cost per sample considerably, but increases both time and the risk to lose cells during the additional washing steps. It is, therefore, critical to take these considerations into account for the experimental design. Here we describe the sequential labeling approach. Considering the potential loss of cells during the extra wash steps, starting with 1 million cells is recommended, but the following protocol also works with low-abundance samples (< 100,000 cells).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/356-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic overview for the combination of WTA, sample tag, and AbSeq\nLabeling samples with sample tag-coupled antibodies\nTransfer 20,000–2 × 106 cells into 200–500 μL of BD Stain Buffer in a 5 mL Eppendorf tube",
    "Proceed to spin samples at 300 × g for 5 min, 4°C following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nResuspend the cell pellet in 190 μL of BD Stain Buffer\nFor each sample, transfer the cell suspension to the respective sample tag tube previously aliquoted (see Note) and mix by pipetting only\nNote: The original BD Rhapsody protocol uses the whole volume of 20 μL of each sample tag-coupled antibody mix for labeling the samples. However, using 10 μL yielded comparable results.\nIncubate the cell suspension between 20°C and 22°C for 20 min\nAdd 200 μL of BD Stain Buffer to the cell suspension and mix by pipetting\nProceed to spin samples at 300 × g for 5 min, 4°C following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nCarefully remove the supernatant with a pipette leaving a small amount of medium to ensure the cell pellet is not disturbed\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL of BD Stain Buffer\nRepeat step 8g and centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min, 4°C following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nRemove the supernatant leaving a small amount of medium and resuspend the pellet in 300 μL of BD Sample Buffer\nNote: For low-abundance samples leave ∼50 μL of supernatant and resuspend the cells in a total volume of 100 μL.\nNote: For low-abundance samples, a co-labeling approach as mentioned above could be used to decrease the potential risk of cell loss. It is important, however, to consider that this approach substantially increases the cost for the AB-labeling per sample. For more details, please, refer to the BD protocol.

    "Pool the cells of all samples at equal numbers and adjust the volume with BD Sample Buffer to a final volume of 610 μL\nNote: If Ab-Oligo staining is not performed, proceed immediately with the single-cell capture step.\nCritical: Accurate cell counting is critical for obtaining an equal distribution of cells between the different samples in the final cell mixture.\nOptional: Ab-Oligo Labeling\nAfter Oligo-coupled antibody-based sample multiplexing, centrifuge the cell mixture at 300 × g for 5 min, 4°C following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nTo block non-specific AB binding sites, remove the supernatant, add 100 μL blocking buffer (95 μL BD Stain Buffer + 5 μL human FcR blocking reagent) and incubate the cell suspension for 10 min between 20°C and 22°C\nAdd 100 μL of the antibody mix to the cell suspension and incubate the cell suspension for 40 min on ice\nNote: BD AbSeq oligo-coupled antibodies are optimized for use at a final concentration of 1:100. Thus, 2 μL of each antibody are mixed and depending on the numbers of antibodies used stain buffer is added to reach a volume of 100 μL of the antibody mix. At this point the mix is added to the cell suspension in blocking buffer reaching a final volume of 200 μL.\nAdd 1 mL of Stain Buffer and proceed to spin the samples at 300 × g for 5 min, 4°C, following the above-mentioned safety instructions\nRepeat the wash step two more times\nResuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of BD Sample Buffer\nCount the cells as described above\nConsidering the number of cells to load on the BD Rhapsody cartridge, adjust the volume with Sample Buffer to obtain a final volume of 610 μL\nBD Rhapsody single-cell capture and cDNA synthesis\nTiming: ∼2 h",
    "This section describes cell loading and capturing of single cells onto the BD Rhapsody Cartridge (RC) and subsequently cDNA synthesis and exonuclease treatment. The critical step here is to define the desired number of cells to load on the RC. BD estimates a multiplet rate of 4.7% when loading 20,000 cells. Using the oligo-coupled antibody-based sample multiplexing strategy enables to efficiently identify doublets in the data in silico thus allowing to super-load a higher number of cells thereby substantially increasing the number of singlets (Stoeckius et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). On average, we observe a doublet rate ranging roughly from 20 to 40 % when super-loading the cartridges with 60,000 cells and end up with approximately 15–20k cells. The inevitable increase in doublets of course also leads to higher sequencing cost for the informative cells as the doublets take up a substantial part of the reads. But as clinical samples are precious and sequencing costs decrease continuously, this is the preferred approach to get as much information per sample with as little batch effects as possible.\nPrepare the following items before starting the experiment:\nSet two thermomixers at 37°C and 80°C, respectively\nThaw all the reagents from the BD Rhapsody cDNA kit and place them on ice. Remove the enzymes from −20°C only right before use\nPlace Sample Buffer, 1 M DTT, Lysis Buffer, and Cell capture beads from the BD Rhapsody Cartridge Reagent kit on ice\nPrepare Cell Capture Beads by placing the Cell Capture Bead tube on the magnet for 1 min and remove the storage buffer. Afterward, remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the beads in 750 μL of cold BD Sample Buffer\nPrepare Lysis Buffer by adding 75 μL 1 M DTT to one 15 mL Lysis Buffer bottle",
    "Ensure that the waste collector and a labeled 5 mL LoBind tube are inserted in the designated slots of the BD Rhapsody Express instrument (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The waste collector located inside the instrument must be pre-filled with 1,400 μL absolute ethanol\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/356-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Once the cells are loaded on the RC, it can be brought outside the hood to proceed with the protocol.\nNote: For operations on the BD Rhapsody Express instrument only electronic BD Rhapsody P1200M and P5000M pipettes can be used. The flow rate in these pipettes is optimized for each different step. For more details on how to use the BD Rhapsody express instrument please consult the BD user guide (http://static.bdbiosciences.com/documents/BD-Rhapsody-Single-Cell-Analysis-System-Instrument.pdf[href=http://static.bdbiosciences.com/documents/BD-Rhapsody-Single-Cell-Analysis-System-Instrument.pdf]).\nPriming of the RC\nNote: All buffers used in this step need to be equilibrated between 20°C and 22°C.\nPlace the RC into the BD Rhapsody Express instrument assuring that the RC barcodes faces out\nSet the P1200M pipette to “Prime/Treat” mode\nLoad 700 μL of absolute ethanol onto the RC\nRemove the ethanol from the RC loading 700 μL of air\nLoad 700 μL of Cartridge Wash Buffer 1 (CWB1) and leave it for 1 min at between 20°C and 22°C\nRemove the CWB1 from the RC loading 700 μL of air and subsequently load 700 μL of CWB1 once more leaving it for 10 min between 20°C and 22°C",

We recommend waiting until almost the end of the incubation of step 13d. This allows processing the first cartridge until step (14g) during the incubation time of the second one.\nIn the meantime:\nDisinfect your hands and wipe the outside of RC and the P1200M carefully with Terralin PAA assuring that the entire surface has been decontaminated\nTransfer both the P1200AM and the RC outside of the hood and place the latter into the Rhapsody Express instrument\nSet the P1200M pipette in “Prime/Treat” mode and load the RC with air to remove cells in excess",

After a first denaturation step in which sample tag sequences (and AbSeq sequences) are denatured off the beads, it is possible to generate the different sequencing libraries (WTA, sample tag, and AbSeq) by several PCR steps. BD provides the protocol for performing WTA analysis either with sample tag or AbSeq.

The protocol is based on the Drop-seq tools initially developed for processing of drop-seq data (Macosko et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) and has been developed into a Snakemake workflow for simple and reproducible use (https://github.com/Hoohm/dropSeqPipe[href=https://github.com/Hoohm/dropSeqPipe]). In brief, the two reads of the paired-end sequencing stored in fastq format after demultiplexing of bcl files are transformed into BAM format and the cell barcode and UMI sequence of read 1 are stored as tags in the BAM file containing the read 2 information. Afterwards, the read 2 sequences, treated as single-end reads, are transformed back to fastq format, cleaned and trimmed of 5′ adapter and 3′ polyA sequences and aligned against the reference sequences. After alignment, the BAM tags from the unaligned BAM file are merged with the aligned reads to recover cell barcode and UMI information. Next, additional annotation is added to the reads depending on their genomic location, e.g., their overlap with genes or exons, to enable subsequent gene expression quantification (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/356-Fig9.jpg",

This allows to skip time-consuming error repair and barcode correction steps.\nNext, using the above-mentioned pipeline, cDNA, sample tag and AbSeq reads are processed, trimmed using Cutadapt (Martin, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and mapped to the custom reference genome using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])\nQuantification\nTo estimate gene expression abundances, BAM records are annotated depending on their genomic location and overlap with genic regions\nExpression values are extracted from the BAM files using the picard DigitalExpression module and stored as gene expression matrix including gene expression, sample tag, and optionally AbSeq counts\nDownstream data analysis",
