    "Cell growth   DT40 cells (wild-type and APTX-null) are maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% chicken serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μM) is added fresh to the medium at the time of use and cells are grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 39.5°C (Okamoto et al., 2014).   The human lymphoblastoid cells (wild-type and APTX-deficient AOA1) are maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing FBS and grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C (Harris et al., 2009).    MEF cells (wild-type and pol β-deficient) are maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 4 mM glutamax and grown in a 10% CO2 incubator at 34°C (Sobol et al., 1996).   1-2 x 150 mm dishes of MEF cells are washed twice in 10 ml cold PBS, then harvested by scraping. Cells are collected in 15 ml PBS in a 15 ml tube, then centrifuged at 1600 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min.   The required volume of suspension cells (DT40 and human lymphoblasts) is centrifuged at 1600 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and the cell pellet are transferred to a 15 ml tube and washed twice with 10 ml PBS.   Cell pellets are transferred to Eppendorf tubes in 1 ml PBS and briefly spun down. Supernatants are discarded and pellets are frozen immediately in dry ice and stored at -80 °C until use.   Pellets of 20-50 million cells are used for cell extract preparation.      Preparation of cell extracts   The cell extracts from vertebrate cells are prepared as reported (Biade et al., 1998) and summarized below.   Resuspend the cell pellet in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer.    Rotate the resuspended cell pellets for 1 h at 4 °C.   Centrifuge the mixture at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cell debris.",
    "Carefully transfer the supernatant fraction to a fresh Eppendorf tube. Be careful not to touch the pellet.   Determine the protein concentration of the extract using Bradford assay dye reagent with BSA as standard (Bradford, 1976).      Enzymatic activity assays in cell extracts   Prepare 10 μl of reaction mixture (final volume) including 1x reaction buffer and 100 nM DNA substrate. The DNA substrate used includes an adenylated uracil base at the 5′ end of the 3′-FAM–labeled oligonucleotide (Çağlayan et al., 2014). For the reference reactions including purified proteins, pol β, APTX, and FEN1, the reaction mixture included a gapped DNA substrate that was pre-incubated with UDG as described (Çağlayan et al., 2014). For the reactions including cell extracts, the DNA substrate was included in the reaction mixture without UDG pretreatment.    Start the reaction by adding cell extract, prepared as above, to the reaction mixture. For the reference reactions, start each reaction by adding the purified protein to the reaction mixture in final concentrations as follows: pol β (500 nM), APTX (100 nM), and FEN1 (100 nM) (Çağlayan et al., 2014 and Çağlayan et al., 2015).   Incubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 15 min.   Stabilize the reaction products by addition of 1 M freshly prepared and ice-cold NaBH4 to a final concentration of 100 mM.   Incubate the reaction samples on ice for 30 min.   Mix the reaction products with 10 μl of gel-loading dye.   The reaction products in cell extracts from vertebrate cells are separated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. The gel is scanned, and the data analyzed as reported (Çağlayan et al., 2014 and Çağlayan et al., 2015)."
