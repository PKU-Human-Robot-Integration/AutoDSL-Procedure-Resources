    "1. Donor Operation\nThe donor rat should be kept fasting for 24 hr (free access to water/glucose solution).\nTo induce Isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, start with 2% on standard atomizer, and then reduce to 1% after performing laparotomy. Perform a toe pinch to check sedation.\nShave the abdomen and clean with skin prep 3 times (Kodan). Then perform a median incision after subcutaneous administration of the analgesic.\nAfter the graft is wrapped in saline soaked gauze, separate the physiological adhesions between the pancreas and the ascending colon gently with a Q-tip (under the surgical microscope with 6x magnification).\nLigate and divide the ileocecal & right & middle colic vessels using 7-0 silk. After the ascending colon is spread out to the right side of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), the ileocecal, right and middle colic vessels can be identified for ligation and division using 7-0 ties.\nRetract the stomach upward, so that the entire SMV is straightened out and exposed. Use a mosquito clamp for retraction. The clamp is held by plasticine mass formed into shape as needed.\nLigate and divide the pancreatico-duodenal veins coming from the SMV. All small pancreatico-duodenal veins originating from the SMV must be carefully identified, ligated with 7-0 silk and divided before the pancreatic tissue can be removed from the graft.\nLigate and divide the lose connective tissue including all lymphatics between the SMV and the abdominal aorta. With the graft still on the right side of the abdomen, the lose connective tissue including all lymphatics between the SMV and the abdominal aorta is accessible. This connective tissue must be ligated using 7-0 silk and divided to avoid postoperative lymphorrhea from the intestinal graft.",
    "Ligate and divide the right renal artery. After the connective tissue is divided, the right renal artery becomes accessible and is ligated and divided using 7-0 silk.\nSystemically heparinise the rat using 200 units of heparin i.v. via the penile vein.\nLigate the marginal arteries, and divide the small bowel at the duodeno-jejunal junction and at the terminal ileum.\nThe aorta is ligated proximally to the origin of the SMA. The portal vein is transected at the confluence with the splenic vein. Then the graft is harvested with its vascular pedicle consisting of the SMA with an aortic segment.\n2. Backtable Procedure\nPerfuse the graft using 3 ml of University of Wisconsin solution (UW) at 4 °C via the aortic conduit and irrigate the intestinal lumen from the jejunal end with 30 ml of Uro-Nebacetin N solution at 4 °C (lumen irrigation is mandatory).\nImmediately after extracting the graft, the aortic conduit is used for perfusion with 3 ml chilled UW solution. For this, a 20 G i.v. catheter on a 10 ml syringe is used. The perfusate should be observed to flow out freely from the divided portal vein. For the intestinal irrigation with Nebacetin, a 50 ml syringe is used.\nStore the graft in UW solution at 4 °C during the preparation of the recipient.\n3. Recipient Operation\nThe recipient rat should be kept fasting for 24 hr (free access to water/glucose solution).\nTo induce Isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, start with 2% on standard atomizer, and then reduce to 1% after performing laparotomy. Perform a toe pinch to check sedation.\nShave the abdomen and clean with skin prep 3 times (Kodan). Then perform a median incision after subcutaneous administration of Carprofen 5 mg/kg s.c. for intraoperative analgesia.",
    "Wrap the recipient bowel in normal saline soaked gauze and place it on the recipient's chest.\nOpen the retroperitoneum bluntly with Q-tips, and expose the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava just below the renal vessels down to the level of the iliac vessels, if necessary also use microscissors. Ligate the small lumbar and spinal tribuaries from the aorta and vena cava using 7-0 silk to avoid blood loss. (To do this, change the surgical microscope zoom to 16x.)\nCross-clamp the aorta and the IVC below the left renal vessels proximally and above the iliac bifurcation distally using microvessel clips. Only one clamp is used proximally as well as distally to clamp both vessels simultaneously. Incise both vessels anteriorly using a microknife and wash out remaining blood.\nCreate an end-to-side anastomosis between the graft aortic segment and the recipient's infrarenal aorta using a continuous 10-0 Prolene suture.. Initially, the graft is placed on the the right side of the abdomen (the head of the rat positioned at 12 o'clock) to perform the back wall stitches of the arterial anastomosis and tying of the lower stay suture. Then, the graft is turned over to the left side of the abdomen (the head of the rat positioned at 9 o'clock) to expose and suture the front wall of the anastomosis.\nAn end-to-side anastomosis between the graft portal vein and the recipient's IVC is performed likewise by running sutures using 10-0 Prolene. With the rat still lying sideways (head in 9 o'clock position), the graft is positioned on the left side of the abdomen and a lower stay suture is placed. The anastomosis is started with the back wall from inside the vessel. After the lower stay suture is tied, the front wall stitches can be performed from outside.",
    "Remove the distal clamps first, followed by the upper clamps. Any anastomotic bleeding is controlled by direct pressure using Q-tips. The graft should be checked for equal and quick reperfusion.\nResect the entire recipient's small intestine after ligation of the mesenteric vessels. Recipients undergo subtotal enterectomy, preserving 2-3 cm of proximal jejunum and 1 cm of distal ileum.\nRestore enteric continuity by proximal (jejuno-jejunostomy) and distal (ileo-ileostomy) end-to end intestinal anastomoses using an interrupted one-layer suture with 6-0 Monocryl. Approximately 16 sutures are needed to complete the anastomoses.\nIrrigate the peritoneal cavity with normal saline until clean. Administer 2 ml of normal saline intraperitoneally for fluid replacement. Then close the abdomen using a continuous suture with 3-0 Vicryl for the muscle layer plus a continuous skin suture.\nIn the postoperative period the rats should be kept fasting (with access to water and glucose solution) for another 24 hr then restarted on standard rat chow and water ad libitum. Analgesia with carprofen should be administered for 3 days (see dosage below).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
