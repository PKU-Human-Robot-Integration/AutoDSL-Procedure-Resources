    "All mice were used in accordance with and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n1. Mouse dissection and perfusion\nNOTE: The following dissections were performed on P4 and P14 mice using a syringe. The volume of perfusion fluid will vary depending on the age of the animal.\nPerfusion\n\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde (PFA) is a hazardous chemical. Perform all perfusion steps in a chemical fume hood.\n\t\nPrior to surgery, administer pentobarbital via intraperitoneal injection (100 mg/kg) and allow the anesthetic to take effect.\nOnce the animal has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia, use the toe-pinching response method to confirm unresponsiveness.\nMake a lateral incision beneath the rib cage to expose the thoracic cavity of the animal.\nUsing curved, surgical scissors, carefully cut through the rib cage up to the collarbone on one side of the animal and make an identical cut on the opposite side, allowing the sternum to be lifted away, exposing the heart.\nWithout damaging the descending aorta, carefully trim any tissue connected to the heart before making a small incision on the right atrium to allow blood to flow out of the vasculature.\nUsing a syringe-based method, perfuse the mouse through the left ventricle with 10 mL and 7 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for P14 and P4, respectively, with a perfusion rate of 1.5 mL/min through the system.\nOnce the blood is cleared, perfuse again with 10 mL of PBS + 4% PFA and 7 mL of PBS + 4% PFA for P14 and P4, respectively, at 4 °C with a perfusion rate of 1.5 mL/min to fix the animal.",
    "NOTE: Fixation tremors will be observed, and the animal will be stiff upon completion. If using MRI on samples, perfuse with similar volumes of PBS and PFA for each timepoint + 20% gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent in the PFA solution.\nRemove the head using surgical scissors and drop-fix with PBS + 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 °C for complete fixation.\n\t\t​NOTE: At this stage, the brain remains intact with the skull on (see Section 2). Pause point: brains can be stored for several months at this stage in PBS + 0.1% sodium azide at 4 °C.\n2. MR-based gross brain structure imaging with intact skull and analysis\nNOTE: The brain must be perfused and incubated in gadolinium as described above without being removed from the skull. All MRI occurs before removal of the brain from the skull to avoid unintended tissue loss during dissection. Imaging with an intact skull also provides support to the brain in the sample holder (i.e., syringe) during sample preparation and imaging.\nSample preparation\n\tNOTE: The following steps are optimized for P4 and P14 mouse brain samples. The syringe size needed will depend on the physical size of the sample.\n\t\nIf performing MRI on the sample, remove the skin from the skull and incubate in PBS + 3% gadolinium for 23 days at 4 °C before imaging14. After 23 days, rinse the samples quickly in PBS.\nUse 5 mL syringes to create a sample holder for MRI, using syringe pistons to close each end of the holder made with the syringe20. Use plastic pieces to hold the skull tightly in place in the holder (Figure 2A). Remove the markings on the syringe with ethanol to prevent artifacts upon imaging.",
    "Securely place the skull in the sample holder and fill with an immersion solution compatible with MRI (see the Table of Materials). Close the holder and remove all the air bubbles using a syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: Pause point: The skull may be stored in the immersion solution for several months before imaging.\nGross brain structure imaging (MRI)\n\t\nImage the samples with a 9.4T/30 cm horizontal-bore, animal MRI system using a 15 mm volume coil and a spin-echo-based sequence with the following parameters: Spatial resolution: 60 µm x 60 µm x 60 µm; total scan time: 7 h 12 min; time to echo (TE): 6.83 ms; repetition time (TR): 40 ms; excitation/refocusing flip angles: 90/180 degrees; image size:166 x 168 x 209 voxels; Field of view (FOV): 9.9 mm x 10.1 mm x 12.4 mm; bandwidth: 100,000 kHz.\nComputational gross brain structure analysis\n\t\nRemove the surrounding skull from raw MRI images by manually tracing the mouse brain using segmentation software. Next, apply the voxel-wise multiplication operation between the mask image and raw MRI image to generate the skull-stripped brain MRI image.\n\t\tNOTE: The output is a binary mask image where the intensity for brain voxels is set to 1 and 0 otherwise.\nApply rigid image registration (estimating only translation and rotation) using 'flirt' in the FSL package21,22 to align the skull-stripped MRI image (moving image) to the corresponding light-sheet microscopy image (reference image).\nApply non-rigid registration (using 'SyN' in ANTS software23) to find the point-to-point correspondences between the rigid-aligned MRI image in step 2.3.2 to the light-sheet image (same reference image in step 2.3.2).\n\t\tNOTE: The output includes the warped MRI image and the deformation field associated with the volume changes from MRI to the light-sheet images.",
    "Calculate the Jacobian determinant on the deformation field generated in step 2.3.3, which quantifies the volume change in a 3 x 3 x 3 voxel local neighborhood.\nAlign skull-stripped images to the Allen Developmental Mouse Brain Atlas using deformable image registration.\n\t\t​NOTE: The established spatial point-to-point correspondence allows automatic annotation of brain regions of interest in the new mouse image (Figure 2C-H).\n3. Brain dissection from the skull\nMake a midline incision along the top of the skull from the neck to the nose to expose the skull.\nExpose the base of the skull by trimming away the remaining neck muscle and all other residual muscle.\nUsing sharp surgical scissors, carefully cut along the inner surface of the skull, taking care not to damage the brain by maintaining a gentle upward pressure while cutting with the sharp surgical equipment.\nUse tweezers to peel the two cut halves of the skull away from the brain and carefully trim away excess fat attached to the brain.\nUse a surgical scissors to trim any dura that connects the brain to the skull, and then use a spatula to gently remove the brain from the head.\nRemove the brain, wash with PBS, and then swap to PBS with 0.1% sodium azide and keep at 4 °C for long-term storage.\n4. Tissue clearing\nNOTE: This protocol is adapted from the iDISCO+ protocol for P4 mice6, with minor changes. Some details may change for different time points/species/experiments). CAUTION: Methanol, dichloromethane (DCM), and dibenzyl ether (DBE) are hazardous chemicals. These tissue clearing steps are performed in a chemical fume hood.\nAntibody validation",
    "NOTE: Methanol compatibility of untested antibodies needs to be checked as they may be negatively affected by the harsh methanol washes required in the iDISCO+ protocol. For a list of antibodies that have been shown to work in iDISCO+, see the website24.\n\t\nHarvest 10 µm frozen sections of the PFA-fixed tissue of interest onto stereological slides.\nIncubate the sections in 100% methanol for 3 h at room temperature.\nRehydrate in PBS before proceeding with standard immunohistochemistry protocols to determine whether the antibody shows the expected pattern of fluorescence after methanol washes. For positive control, use a slide not treated with methanol.\nBuffer preparation\n\t\nPrepare buffers according to the official iDISCO protocol. See the Table of Materials for composition of the buffers and other solutions used in this protocol.\nPretreatment\n\t\nDehydrate the sample with methanol/PBS series: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%; 1 h each at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Using PBS during dehydration helps prevent cracking of the samples in methanol washes.\nWash the sample in 100% methanol for 1 h, and then chill at 4 °C for 1 h before incubating overnight with shaking in 66% DCM/33% methanol at room temperature.\nWash the sample 2x in 100% methanol at room temperature, and then chill it at 4 °C.\nUse fresh 5% H2O2 in methanol to bleach the sample overnight at 4 °C.\nRehydrate the sample with methanol/PBS series: 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, PBS; 1 h each at room temperature and wash 2x for 1 h in PTx.2 at room temperature.\nIncubate the sample in 1x PBS/0.2% TritonX-100/20% DMSO at 37 °C overnight.\nIncubate the sample in 1x PBS/0.1% Tween-20/0.1% TritonX-100/0.1% Deoxycholate/0.1% NP40/20% DMSO at 37 °C overnight.\nWash in PTx.2 at room temperature for 1 h twice.\nImmunolabeling",
    "Incubate the samples in Permeabilization Solution at 37 °C for 2 days (~48 h).\nBlock the samples in Blocking Solution at 37 °C for 2 days (~48 h).\nIncubate the samples with primary antibody in PTwH / 5%DMSO / 3% Serum at 37 °C for 4 days (~96 h) (e.g., rabbit(Rb) Brn2/POU3F2 mAb (1:100) and anti-Ctip2 rat(Rt) antibody (1:400) (Table of Materials).\nWash 3 x 1 h in PTwH. Wash for another 2 h in PTwH. Leave in the wash solution overnight at room temperature.\nIncubate the samples with secondary antibody and a nuclear dye, such as TO-PRO-3, in PTwH / 3% Serum at 37 °C for 4 days (~96 h; e.g., goat anti-Rb(1:50) and (goat anti-Rt(1:200)) (Table of Materials).\nWash 3 x 1 h in PTwH Wash for another 2 h in PTwH. Leave in the wash solution overnight at room temperature.\nClearing\n\t\nDehydrate in methanol/PBS series-20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%-1 h each at room temperature. Incubate for 3 h, with shaking, in 66% DCM / 33% methanol at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample can be left overnight at room temperature immediately after dehydration in 100% methanol.\nIncubate in 100% DCM for 15 min twice at room temperature (with shaking) to wash the MeOH.\nIncubate in dibenzyl ether (DBE) without shaking at room temperature. Ensure that the tube is filled almost completely with DBE to prevent oxidation of the sample. Finish mixing the solution by inverting a couple of times before imaging.\n5. Light-sheet imaging\nNOTE: iDISCO tissue-cleared brains were imaged with a light-sheet microscope, equipped with a 2X/0.5 NA objective, a complementary metal oxide semiconductor camera, and microscope operating and image acquisition software at 0.75 x 0.75 x 4 µm/voxel for the P4 timepoint as this allowed single-cell resolution within the cortex (Figure 3A,B).\nSample mounting",
    "Carefully mount the sample in the correct sample size holder such that the sample is oriented with the z-dimension no more than 5.2 mm in depth due to the rated working distance of the light-sheet microscope (5.7 mm minus 0.5 mm safety margin)25.\nPlace holder in the sample cradle with the screw of the holder at a 45° angle to the cradle supports (Figure 1B). Position the cradle so that the light path is perpendicular to the sample (Figure 1C).\nImaging parameters\n\t\nSet the zoom body on the microscope to 4x magnification or higher yielding 0.75 µm/pixel.\n\t\tNOTE: Single-cell computational analyses on P4 light-sheet images can be done with any commercially available light-sheet microscope that allows resolution of 0.75 x 0.75 x 4 µm/voxel or higher. A lower resolution is sufficient for brains at later time points in which nuclei are more sparsely distributed.\nIn the image acquisition software, select a single light-sheet with an NA = ~0.08 (9 µm thickness/4 µm z step).\n\t\tNOTE: This setting combined with horizontal dynamic focusing allows whole-brain imaging at a single-cell resolution of a mouse brain within a reasonable time. For a postnatal day 4 (P4) brain, image acquisition time is estimated to be 11-15 h for three channels depending on the size of the brain.\nTo ensure axial resolution is maintained along the width of the image, select Horizontal Dynamic Focusing and apply the recommended number of steps depending on the laser wavelength. For a whole P4 mouse brain, set the horizontal dynamic focusing to 11. Adjust Fine Focus for each channel with respect to the registration channel.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, TO-PRO-3 channel (647 nm) is registered to the Allen Developmental Mouse Brain Atlas as this labels all nuclei.\nAdjust the laser power per channel with respect to the channel properties.",
    "NOTE: Longer wavelengths require higher laser power compared to shorter wavelengths. For instance, the 780 nm needs to be imaged at a high laser power (70% - 75%) and low exposure (50 ms), while the 647 nm channel requires an average laser power (40% - 45%) and low exposure (50 ms).\nAdjust the Light-Sheet Width to ~50% to ensure that the sheet power is distributed optimally in the y dimension for this sample size.\n\t\tNOTE: In combination with the horizontal dynamic focusing, a 50% sheet width provides an average distribution of power across the image with a reduced risk of photobleaching25.\nSet Number of Tiles in respect to the size of the sample with a recommended Overlap of 15% between tiles, and capture images for each channel sequentially for each stack at a given tile position.\n6. Image processing using NuMorph\nNOTE: The NuMorph pipeline has three main parts for 3D image analysis: preprocessing, analysis, and evaluation. These parts have been organized into NMp_template.m, NMa_template.m, and NMe_template.m, respectively, which are discussed below. Additionally, NM_setup.m is added to download and install software packages needed for NuMorph to run smoothly. NM_samples.m also provides a template to input image acquisition information.\nNuMorph setup\n\t\nDownload and install the conda environment manager for Linux26. Download and install NuMorph19 image processing tools.\nOn the command line, run Matlab. Run NM_setup.m from NuMorph to download and install image analyses software packages needed for analyses.\n\t\tNOTE: This step ensures the conda environment is set up properly as well as ensures all tools and add-ons needed for Matlab to run each of the three pipelines are downloaded and installed correctly. Most notable here are Elastix for running registration and 3D-Unet for cell detection and counting.",
    "Specify sample names, input and output directories, channel information, and light-sheet imaging parameters by editing the file NM_samples.m.\n\tNOTE: Here, it is recommended to double-check to make sure the right information, especially image input directory, is specified properly. Errors are not usually called here until running subsequent steps.\nImage preprocessing\n\t\nIntensity adjustment\n\t\t\nIn the NMp_template, set intensity adjustment = true.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Set to true if intensity adjustment is required. If not, set intensity adjustment = false. There is also an option to use 'update' to overwrite previous adjustment parameters.\nSet use processed images = false when working with a new set of images. Otherwise, indicate any previously saved image datasets in the output directory (e.g., \"aligned\", \"stitched\") to use for subsequent processing steps.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This option is provided in the case where input images have already been preprocessed. In this case, preprocessed images will be used as input images and the option will be set to the name of the subdirectory in the output directory.\nSet save images = true.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Using this option ensures processed images are saved in the output directory; otherwise, only parameters will be calculated and saved.\nSet save samples = true.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This option ensures sample results are saved for each major step.\nSet adjust tile shading = basic to apply shading correction using the BaSiC algorithm27 or manual to apply tile shading correction using measurements from the light-sheet microscope at specific light-sheet widths.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This option corrects for the uneven illumination along the y dimension caused by the shape of the sheet waist.\nImage channel alignment\n\t\t\nIn NMp_template, set channel alignment = true. Set this option to true if channel alignment is required. If not, set to false. Set channel alignment method to either translation (rigid) or elastix (nonrigid).",
    "NOTE: The translation method utilizes rigid 2D registration approaches in aligning multiple channels while the elastix method utilizes non-rigid B-splines28 to correct for rotational drift, which may occur during long image acquisition19.\nIterative image stitching\n\t\t\nIn NMp_template, set stitch images = true.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Set this option to true if stitching is required.\nSet sift refinement = true.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This option is used to further refine translation in xy using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform29.\nSet load alignment params = true.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This option utilizes the channel alignment translations during stitching. This option is recommended with multichannel imaging. Otherwise, set to false.\nSet overlap = 0.15 to match tile overlaps during imaging.\nTo run any of these preprocessing steps, run the following in Matlab outside NMp_template environment:\n\t\t\nSpecify sample name. Set config = NM_config(process,sample).\nRun any of the preprocessing steps by specifying NM_process(config,stage) and specify the stage using intensity, align, or stitch for any of the processes. Check the output directory for output files for each of the stages (Figure 3 and Figure 4).\nImage analysis\n\t\nBefore NuMorph\n\t\t\nStart with a 3D atlas image and an associated annotation image that assigns each voxel to a particular structure.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The P4 Allen Developmental Mouse Brain Atlas generated from the MagellanMapper30 is used here.\nAlign both the atlas image and annotation file to ensure they match correctly in the right orientation.\nWithin NuMorph\n\t\tNOTE: Now that the atlas and its annotations are aligned correctly, the files have to be \"munged\" or processed within NuMorph so that they can be saved for later use. To do this, use the munge_atlas function to specify inputs as shown below.\n\t\t\nSpecify Atlas_file: (string). Provide the full path to the atlas file.\nSpecify Annotation_file: (string). Provide the full path to the associated annotations.",
    "Specify Resolution: (1x3 numeric). Specify the atlas y,x,z resolution as micron per pixel.\nSpecify Orientation: (1 x 3 char). Provide the atlas orientation and ensure it matches the setup of the sample in the cradle (anterior(a)/posterior(p),superior(s)/inferior(i),left(l)/right(r)).\nSpecify Hemisphere: Specify which brain hemisphere was imaged (\"left\", \"right\", \"both\", \"none\").\nSpecify out_resolution:(int). Specify the isotropic resolution of atlas output in microns. (default: 25).\nRun the command \"munge_atlas(atlas_file, annotation_file, resolution, orientation, hemisphere)\" to generate munged annotations in /data/annotation_data and a copy of the atlas image in /data/atlas.\nRead the Matlab structure and atlas file to verify both files are munged correctly in the right orientation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: An additional cell classification step can be performed to quantify cell-types based on co-localization of immunolabeled protein markers.\nResampling\n\t\t\nIn NMa_template, set resample images = true, if performing image registration to reference the atlas or to generate downsampled volumes of high-resolution datasets.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The NMa_template.m will be used to set the parameters for resampling, registration, nuclei detection, and cell counting.\nSet resample resolution to match the atlas.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Here, 25 µm3/voxel isotropic resolution is used because the reference atlas is at this resolution.\nSpecify the channel number to be resampled using resample channels = [ ].\n\t\t\tNOTE: Here, channel number is set to match the nuclear channel. If this option is empty, only the registration channel will be resampled.\nRegistration\n\t\t\nIn NMa_template, set register images = true. Set to true if registration is required. If not, set registration = false.\nSpecify the atlas file to match the file in the atlas directory.\nSet registration parameters = default.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This option utilizes an affine followed by B spline transformation to estimate spatial correspondence. Otherwise, define a new set of registration parameters via Elastix in /data/elastix_parameter_files/atlas_registration.\nSet save registered images = true.",
    "NOTE: Output files from registration and resampling can be downloaded and visually inspected in Matlab or other visualization tools such as FIJI31.\nNuclei Detection, Cell Counting and Classification\n\t\tNOTE: Errors occurring here may be due to not specifying the annotations file correctly or not matching the age of the sample with the right annotation.\n\t\t\nIn NMa_template, set both count nuclei and classify cells = true.\nSet count method = 3dunet.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This option allows the use of the trained 3D-Unet model19. Otherwise, select Hessian that utilizes the Hessian blob detection method.\nSet min_intensity to define a minimum intensity threshold for detected objects.\n\t\t\tNOTE: An appropriate threshold is determined empirically based on the signal-to-noise ratio of nuclear labeling.\nSet classify_method to either threshold, which is based on an unsupervised fluorescence intensities at centroid positions or svm, which models a supervised linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step will classify all the detected cells into four major classes with 3-channel imaging. With this protocol, Ctip2+/Brn2-, Ctip2-/Brn2+, Ctip2-/Brn2-, and Outliers are generated.\nAnalysis steps\n\t\t\nSpecify sample name. Set config =NM_config(analyze,sample).\nRun any of the analysis steps by specifying NM_analyze(config,stage) and specify the stage using resample, register, count, or classify. Check the output directory for output files for each of the stages (Figure 5).\nCell-type classification and group analysis\n\t\t\nIn NMe_template, set update = true and overwrite all previous statistics calculated.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The NMe_template.m provides the option to perform cell-type group analysis across brain regions of the same brain being analyzed.\nSet compare_structures_by to either index to compare by all unique annotations or table to compare structures according to the table.\nSet the template_file, which specifies all the possible structure indexes and must exist in /annotations.\nSet structure_table and specify structures to evaluate.",
    "Specify cell counting and cell-type classification as described in NMa_template.m.\nSet compare_groups to specify groups to compare.\nSet paired to either true or false to either perform paired t-test or two-sample t-test.\nRun analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: To perform this step, run the following in Matlab outside NMe_template.m environment.\n\t\t\nSpecify sample name.Set config =NM_config(evaluate,sample).\nRun the analysis step by specifying NM_evaluate(config,stage) and specify the stage. Check the output directory for output files for the group analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
