    "1. Introduction to the Parts of the Wounder (Figure 1)\nPrepare the pin holder by fixing the wounding pins at equal distances. Hold the pipette tips and adjust the tip height by moving the adjustable wounding pins up and down.\nFit the adjustable guiding-bar on different brands of 96-well culture plates and ensure that the wounding area is in a fixed position.\nFix the adjustable wounding pin by tightening the hex screw. Fix the guiding-bar in position by tightening the hex socket head caps on both ends.\n2. Setting the Width of the Pin Holder (Figure 2)\nLoosen the hex socket head caps with the M5 hex wrench.\nInsert a suitable number of adjusting rings to both sides of the pin holder so that the guiding bars fit perfectly with the width of the 96-well culture plate.\n\tNOTE: Corning and Iwaki plates requires 1 pair of large rings and 1 pair of small rings. Falcon and Nunc plates need 1 pair of large rings.\nTighten the hex socket head caps to fix the guiding bar.\n3. Adjusting the Guiding Bars (Figure 3)\nFit the wounding pins with sterile 10-µL plastic pipette tips.\nLoosen the hex socket head caps with the M5 hex wrench.\nHold the wounder and dip the wounding pins into one column of a 96-well culture plate.\nAdjust the height of the guiding bars until all of the tips barely touch the bottom of the wells.\nTighten the hex socket head caps. Ensure that the wounder now perfectly fits on the culture plate and that the pins are well-positioned in the middle of the wells.\n4. Calibration of the Pins\nHold the wounder perpendicular to a flat sterile surface (i.e. Petri dish) and loosen all the hex screws with the M3 hex wrench.",
    "Tap the wounder until all of the tips evenly touch the flat sterile surface.\nTighten the hex screws again to lock the pins in position.\nCheck the evenness of each tip by tapping the wounder gently on the flat sterile surface.\n5. Scratching Cell Monolayer (Figure 4)\nSeed human umbilical vascular endothelial cells on a 0.1% gelatin-coated 96-well cell culture plate. Culture cells in Medium 199 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.09 g/L heparin. Maintain cells in a humidified incubator with 5% carbon dioxide at 37 ºC overnight before being used. Cells should reach 100% confluency before wounding.\nPlace the wounding tips at the leftmost (or the rightmost) side of each well within the same column of the culture plate. Slide the wounder across to the other side of the well; make sure the wounding tips are touching the bottom of the well.\nRepeat the scratching (Step 5.2) for all columns.\nAfter wounding, discard the medium in each well and replace with fresh medium containing testing compounds.\n6. Data Acquisition and Image Analysis\nImage the whole well with the mechanical wound on the cell monolayer using a low-power microscope with digital camera (e.g. 10X objective) immediately after wounding (t=0 h).\nAdd test compounds if desired and incubate for the desired length of time. Image the whole well with the wound area again after the desired incubation time (t=Δh).\nUsing image analysis software such as ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/]), measure the wounded area on the image using the freehand tool.\nCalculate the percentage of wound closure:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55411/55411eq1.jpg\nSubscription Required.
