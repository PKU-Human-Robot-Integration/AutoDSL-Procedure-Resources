    "ETHICS STATEMENT:All procedures involving animals were performed according to guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University.\n1. Kidney Decellularization\nPrepare decellularization solutions. Prepare the following volumes of reagents for each kidney to be decellularized, plus one additional volume (e.g., for 4 kidneys, prepare 5,000 ml Triton X-100 for step 1.1.3):\n\t\nPrepare 500 ml reverse osmosis water (ROH2O). Note: Alternatively, deionized water may be used in steps where ROH2O is indicated.\nPrepare 1,000 ml Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) in ROH2O. Slowly add 10 ml Triton X-100 to 990 ml water in a large beaker under rapid stirring on a stir plate. Allow the reagent to dissolve completely before use (at least 10 min).\nPrepare 1,000 ml Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) in ROH2O (separate volume).\nPrepare 1,000 ml sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1% (v/v) in ROH2O. Slowly add 5 ml SDS (20% stock solution) to 995 ml water in a large beaker under fast stirring on a stir plate. Allow the reagent to mix uniformly before use (at least 10 min).\nPrepare 500 ml ROH2O (separate volume). \nPrepare kidneys for decellularization.\n\t\nRecover a kidney from a male Sprague Dawley rat (250-300 g) as previously described7.\n\t\t\nAnesthetize the rat by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight). Frequently examine the depth of anesthesia (every 10-15 min) by monitoring respiratory function, heart rate, and toe pinch response during surgery. If the animal has an elevated respiration rate or positive pedal reflex, administer a supplemental dose (with 1/3 to 1/4 of the initial dose) of pentobarbital.\nPerform a longitudinal midline abdominal incision to expose the kidneys, abdominal aorta, and the inferior vena cava.\nInject 2,000 USP heparin Units/kg body weight into the penile vein.",
    "Mobilize both kidneys by gentle dissection. Carefully separate the kidney from the perirenal fat, while keeping the renal capsule surrounding the kidney intact. Perfuse the kidneys with cold saline (10 ml) through infra-renal abdominal aorta.\nInsert a 24 gauge catheter into the renal artery, tightly ligate the catheter to the artery, and (using a syringe) gently perfuse the kidney with 10 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to completely clear the organ of blood.\nImmerse kidney in 25 ml PBS within a Petri dish and place in a -20 °C freezer to gradually freeze the organ (thereby inducing cell lysis) for storage until decellularization.\n\t\tNote: if desired, the ureter and/or renal vein may also be cannulated for retrograde seeding, though not described in this protocol.\nCompletely thaw the frozen kidney (equilibriate at room temperature (RT)), and gently perfuse with 10 ml of PBS to check the ligated renal artery for leaks. If leaks or significant resistance are observed, re-catheterize the renal artery.\nPrepare equipment for decellularization. Assemble the decellularization perfusion system as depicted in Figure 1B.\n\t\nConnect one 8” length of peristaltic pump tubing (Figure 1D, f) to two sufficient lengths (>36” recommended) of 1/16” inner diameter (ID) silicone rubber tubing (Figure 1D, h). Use two male Luer lock to 1/8” barbed adapters joined by one female Luer x female Luer adapter to join segments of tubing (Figure 1D, j). Insert an additional male Luer lock to 1/8” barbed adapter (Figure 1D, c) into the downstream end of the perfusion line for attachment to the renal artery catheter.\nConnect each peristaltic pump tubing segment to the 4-roller pump head using a large pump cartridge.",
    "After placing the upstream end of silicone rubber tubing in the first solution reservoir (ROH2O), hold the “Prime” button to fully prime each perfusion circuit with solution. CRITICAL: Verify that no bubbles remain entrapped in the tubing, and that the upstream end (left open to draw fluid) of the silicone rubber tubing is secured below the liquid-air interface of the reagent reservoir, as depicted in Figure 1B.\nPerform the decellularization protocol at RT7.\n\t\nConnect the renal artery catheter of each thawed kidney to the end of the perfusion circuit tubing downstream from the pump, ensuring that no air bubbles are entrapped in the catheter. Allow the kidney to be suspended along the inner wall of an empty 5 L beaker (perfusate collection reservoir, see Figure 1B) so that the renal artery is not kinked or coiled.\nAdjust the pump drive to 5 ml/min, and press the “Start” button. Confirm that each kidney is perfusing by observing solutions drip from the bottom of the organ.\nPerfuse each kidney with the following reagents as described in Figure 1A\nPerfuse with 500 ml ROH2O at 5 ml/min for 1 hr, 40 min.\nPerfuse with 1,000 ml 1% Triton X-100 at 5 ml/min for 3 hr, 20 min.\nPerfuse with 1,000 ml 1% Triton X-100 at 1 ml/min for 16 hr, 40 min.\nPerfuse with 1,000 ml 0.1% SDS at 5 ml/min for 3 hr, 20 min.\nPerfuse with 500 ml ROH2O at 5 ml/min for 1 hr, 40 min.\n\t\t\tNote: Each decellularized kidney may be stored in PBS (without additives) in a 50 ml conical tube at 4 °C for a maximum of two weeks before use.\n2. Perfusion Bioreactor Assembly, Kidney Sterilization, and Preparation for Recellularization\nPrepare bioreactor vessels.",
    "Wash the glass bioreactor reservoirs (body component) and bioreactor heads with warm, dilute dish detergent solutions (e.g. 1% dish detergent solution in tap water) and rinse thoroughly with tap water and then ROH2O. Allow components to dry completely.\nApply a small volume (~5 ml) of siliconizing reagent to the bottom of each reservoir. Ensure that reagent wets the entire bottom surface for several seconds, then drain excess fluid.\nAllow the reservoirs to dry in a fume hood at RT O/N. Alternatively, reservoirs may be dried in an oven at 100 °C for 30 min to expedite drying and improve durability of the coating, which is intended to prevent attachment of cells to the bottom of the glass bioreactor reservoir.\nPrepare perfusion circuit components for sterilization (Figure 1D).\n\t\nCut the following lengths of tubing (for each bioreactor):\n\t\t\nCut two 25” lengths of 1/16” ID silicone rubber tubing (Figure 1D, h).\nCut one 8” length of peristaltic pump tubing (Figure 1D, f).\nCut one 4.25” length of 1/16” ID silicone rubber tubing.\nCut two 1” lengths of thick-walled 1/16” ID silicone rubber tubing (Figure 1D, g).\nCut one 2” length of 1/4' ID x 0.5' outer diameter (OD) silicone rubber tubing (Figure 1D, e).\nPrepare the following Luer adapters (for each bioreactor):\n\t\t\nPrepare 10 male Luer lock to 1/8' barbed adapters (Figure 1D, c)\nPrepare 2 male Luer plugs (Figure 1D, a)\nPrepare 2 female Luer caps (Figure 1D, b)\nPrepare 5 female Luer x female Luer adapters (x5; Figure 1D, d)\nWash all tubing and Luer adapters with warm, dilute dish detergent solutions, rinse thoroughly in tap water and then ROH2O, and allow them to dry.\nAssemble perfusion circuits.",
    "Slip 1” length of thick-walled 1/16' ID silicone rubber tubing over inlet Luer acceptor attached to the head of the bioreactor. Place male Luer lock to 1/8” ID barb adapter into open end of tubing. Repeat for the other inlet Luer acceptor, and connect a female Luer cap to seal off port (intended for ureteral or venous seeding techniques not described in this protocol).\nConnect each 25” segment of 1/16” ID silicone rubber tubing to the 8” segment of peristaltic pump tubing using male Luer lock to 1/8' ID barb and female Luer x female Luer adapters (Figure 1D, j).\nConnect one open end of silicone rubber tubing to the media perfusate outlet on the outside of the bioreactor head. Connect the 4.25” length of 1/16” ID tubing to the opposite (inner) side of the media perfusate outlet on the inside of the bioreactor head.\nConnect a male Luer lock to 1/8' ID barbed adapter to the remaining open end of the perfusion circuit tubing. Connect a female Luer x female Luer adapter to the male Luer lock. Connect the female Luer x female Luer adapter to the open male Luer lock leading into the inlet Luer acceptor on the bioreactor. This will serve as the media perfusate inlet leading directly into the catheterized renal artery.\nEnsure that no ports on the bioreactor lid are left open or exposed. Tightly close the vacuum valve on bioreactor body.\nFit the bioreactor head over the reservoir body, with an O-ring sandwiched in between the identical grooves lining each component. Place a metallic clamp over the interface to hold the two components together.",
    "Fit the vent port on the bioreactor head with a 0.2 micron vent filter, connecting the two components using a 2” length of 1/4' ID x 0.5' OD silicone rubber tubing (Figure 1D, e). Open the vent valve.\nSlightly loosen the red screw cap on the bioreactor head.\nPlace the remaining Luer adapters and 6” serrated specimen forceps in an autoclavable pouch and seal. \nAutoclave the assembled bioreactors and male Luer plugs.\nPrepare the following reagents for scaffold sterilization and medium perfusion before seeding (volumes are listed per decellularized kidney):\n\t\nWithin a fume hood, prepare a 50 ml 0.1% peracetic acid, 4% ethanol solution by adding 2.56 ml peracetic acid solution (39% stock concentration) and 40 ml 200 proof ethanol to ~957 ml ROH2O in a 1 L bottle. Mix thoroughly by repeatedly inverting bottle, and place in biological safety cabinet.\nPrepare a 150 ml 1x PBS solution, pre-sterilized by autoclaving.\nPrepare 50 ml DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep). \nCollect the remaining items for perfusion bioreactor assembly. Place all items in a biological safety cabinet. CRITICAL: Ensure that the biological safety cabinet is fitted with working electrical sockets to power the digital pump drive. Alternatively, use an extension cord to connect the pump drive to external electrical sockets outside the cabinet.\n\t\nCollect decellularized kidneys.\nCollect autoclaved bioreactors with attached perfusion circuits.\nCollect autoclaved pouch containing Luer adapters and forceps.\nCollect digital pump drive with attached 4-roller head, and large pump cartridges (1 per perfusion circuit).\nComplete the perfusion circuit as described in Figure 1C under sterile conditions within a biological safety cabinet.",
    "Connect a 3-way stopcock (Figure 1D, i) between the male Luer lock to 1/8' ID barb adapter near the media perfusate inlet and the female Luer x female Luer adapter. Leave all three ports on the stopcock open.\nRemove the red screw cap on the bioreactor head and pipette 50 ml of the 0.1% peracetic acid, 4% ethanol solution into the medium reservoir through the opening.\nConnect the peristaltic pump tubing segment to the pump head using a large pump cartridge. Adjust the flow rate to 5 ml/min, press “Start”, and allow the circuit to prime.\n\t\t\nWhen the liquid fills the perfusion line and reaches the remaining open port of the three-way stopcock, plug the port using a male Luer plug (Figure 1D, a).\nAllow the circuit to fully prime until no air is observed in the perfusion circuit tubing or on the inside of the inlet Luer acceptor. If necessary, increase the flow rate temporarily to expel bubbles from the perfusion line. When fully primed, stop the pump drive.\nCarefully plug the female Luer end of the renal artery catheter into the male inlet Luer acceptor on the inner surface of the bioreactor head using the sterilized 6” forceps. Make sure the connection is tight and that no air is left in the catheter. Allow the kidney to gently hang from renal artery catheter, so that the renal artery does not twist or kink.\nTighten the metallic clamp holding together the bioreactor head and body so that the bioreactor reservoir is tightly sealed. Close the red screw cap on the bioreactor head.\nSterilize kidneys at RT by perfusion with 0.1% peracetic, 4% ethanol solution at 5 ml/min for 1 hr, then three sequential 1-hr perfusions at RT with 50 ml PBS at 5 ml/min.\n\t\nChanging solutions:",
    "After 1 hr, stop the pump and open red screw cap. Using a sterile (autoclaved) Pasteur pipette, carefully aspirate all of the solution from the bioreactor reservoir. Leave the perfusion circuit fully primed.\nPipette 50 ml of fresh solution into the bioreactor reservoir, close the screw cap, and start the pump.\nAfter the final PBS rinse, aspirate PBS from the reservoir and pipette in 50 ml DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep. Close the screw cap, and transfer the bioreactor with the attached perfusion circuit to a large-capacity incubator maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nIf necessary, transfer the pump drive to the incubator. Connect bioreactor perfusion circuit to the pump, and perfuse the kidneys at 4 ml/min for at least 1 hr prior to seeding.\n3. Kidney Recellularization with Renal Cortical Tubular Epithelial Cells\nWarm sufficient volumes of DMEM/F12 (supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep) and cell dissociating enzyme for cell lifting to 37 °C. Suggested volumes are listed below:\n\t\nPrepare 10 ml cell dissociating enzyme and 10 ml DMEM/F12 per 175 cm2 culture flask for lifting.\nPrepare 5-10 ml DMEM/F12 per kidney to be seeded. \nCollect a sufficient number of culture flasks for the desired seeding concentration (4 x 107 immortalized human RCTE cells18 per kidney results in maximal engraftment of RCTE cells using this seeding strategy).\nLift cells from the flasks using cell dissociating enzyme. Aspirate medium from flask, then pipette 10 ml cell dissociating enzyme into flask. Place flask in 37 °C incubator to expedite dissociation.\nCheck flask on a phase contrast microscope every 2 min until full dissociation of cells from flask surface is observed. Note: Incubation time will vary depending on the level of confluence of the cells, but RCTE cells will require approximately 15 min to fully dissociate.",
    "Take a sample of dissociated cell suspension for counting prior to pelleting. Dilute the cell suspension with an equal volume of pre-warmed DMEM/F12 medium, and centrifuge at 232 x g relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 5 min.\nCount the cells during centrifugation. Dilute the obtained sample with an equal volume of Trypan Blue, and pipette 10 µl into each end of a hemacytometer for counting. Calculate necessary pellet dilution volume to obtain the desired seeding concentration (2 x 107 cells/ml).\nAfter centrifugation, dilute the pellet with an appropriate volume of culture medium to obtain a final concentration of 2 x 107 cells/ml. Draw up 2 ml of the seeding suspension into a sterile 5 ml syringe.\nTransfer the perfusion bioreactor to a biological safety cabinet. Turn the stopcock valve to close flow to the seeding port. Remove the male Luer slip plug from the stopcock, and connect the syringe loaded with the seeding suspension.\nQuickly transfer the perfusion circuit back to incubator, and use the large pump cartridge to secure the peristaltic pump tubing segment to the pump head.\nCell seeding: Close the stopcock valve port pointing toward pump. Slowly inject the cell suspension into kidney, ensuring that the entire suspension is transferred from the syringe into the stopcock and perfusion line. Turn the stopcock valve to close flow from the syringe, and start the pump at 25 ml/min for 15 min.\nAfter 15 min, lower the pump flow rate to 4 ml/min. Exchange medium (100 ml volume for subsequent changes) the following day and thereafter every two days.\n4. Evaluation of Cell Viability and Proliferation using Resazurin Perfusion Assay",
    "Prepare resazurin reagent. Dissolve 110.5 mg resazurin sodium salt in 100 ml of PBS under stirring, and dilute 1:10 by adding 5 ml of the resulting solution to 45 ml fresh PBS to create a 440 µM resazurin stock solution. Filter-sterilize (using a 0.2 µm syringe filter), and store the stock solution in a light-protected 50 ml conical tube at 4 °C.\nPrepare resazurin-supplemented media controls. Prepare a 10% solution of resazurin reagent in culture medium (e.g. 5 ml resazurin stock solution + 45 ml culture medium) to create resazurin working solution. Autoclave a 10 ml volume of the resazurin working solution in a light-protected container. Note: This will completely reduce the resazurin compound to resorufin, and will serve as a positive control for calculating percent resazurin reduction.\nAliquot 1 ml each of resazurin working solution (oxidized), autoclaved resazurin working solution (reduced), and culture medium alone (blank) into separate 1.5 ml collection tubes. Place the open tubes in the same incubator as the perfusion bioreactors.\nTransfer the kidney perfusion circuit from the incubator to a biological safety cabinet. Remove the screw cap from the bioreactor head, and aspirate culture medium from the bioreactor reservoir using a Pasteur pipette.\nPipette 10 ml of resazurin working solution into reservoir, close screw cap, and transfer the kidney perfusion circuit back to the incubator.\nStart the pump at 4 ml/min and allow reagent to perfuse through the kidneys for exactly 1 hr.\nAfter 1 hr, stop the pump, and transfer the kidney perfusion circuit to the biological safety cabinet.\nCollect the conditioned (partially reduced) resazurin solution, and add 100 ml culture medium to the bioreactor reservoir. Transfer perfusion circuit to incubator, and resume flow (4 ml/min).",
    "Pipette 100 µl (x 3 replicates) conditioned resazurin solution, resazurin working solution, autoclaved working solution, and culture media blank into a black (opaque) 96-well assay plate. Read fluorescence intensity (excitation: 540/35; emission: 590/20) using a spectrophotometer.\nCalculate percent reduction as a ratio of fluorescence intensities normalized by the fluorescence intensity (FI) generated by the oxidized resazurin medium (ORM, or resazurin working solution not exposed to cells) or the reduced resazurin medium (RRM, or autoclaved working solution): % reduction = 100 x {[FI(conditioned resazurin solution) - FI(ORM)] / [FI(RRM) - FI(ORM)]}. To normalize results, multiply % reduction by circulating volume (10 ml) and divide by incubation time (1 hr).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
