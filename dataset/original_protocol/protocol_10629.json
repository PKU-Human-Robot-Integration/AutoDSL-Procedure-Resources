    "This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and was approved by the appropriate Ethics Committees.\n1. Preparation of Media and Reagents\nPreparation of 200x of L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate stock\n\t\nDissolve 29 mg of L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate per 5 ml of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) solution and filter through 0.22 μm membrane filter. Store as 0.25 ml sterile aliquots in -20 °C.\nAdd 0.25 ml aliquot of 200x L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate stock to every 50 ml of fibroblast media (DMEM with 1% L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum) on the day required, for a final concentration of 0.1 mM of L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate.\nPreparation of keratinocyte growth media\n\t\nIsolation and culture of primary SCC keratinocytes have been described previously21. Preparation of keratinocyte growth media is described therein as well.\nBriefly, prepare the media as follows:\n\t\t300 ml of DMEM and 100 ml of Ham’s F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS\n\t\t0.4 mg/ml hydrocortisone\n\t\t5 mg/ml insulin\n\t\t10 ng/ml EGF\n\t\t5 mg/ml transferrin\n\t\t8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin\n\t\t13 ng/ml liothyronine\n\t\t1x penicillin-streptomycin solution\n2. In Vitro Construction of Fibroblast-derived Native Matrix in L-Ascorbic Acid 2-Phosphate Supplemented Media\nSeed 200,000 fibroblasts per well in 6-well plates (20,000 cells/cm2) in fibroblast media supplemented with of L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. Refeed every 2-3 days with 2-5 ml of media. (Note: Refeeding frequency and volume may be adjusted to suit the individual needs of different cells. See “Discussions”).",
    "A thick layer of cells embedded in extracellular matrix will form at the end of 6 weeks, visible to the naked eye (Figure 1). To release this layer from the tissue culture plate, gently scrape the circumference of matrix with a 1 ml micropipette tip and then push the edges of the matrix towards center of the well. This layer of cells and matrix (native matrix) should be easily detachable from the plate surface, and now be floating in the media. Spread the native matrix out in the media to avoid it folding up onto itself.\nLet the native matrix float and remodel for 5 days, changing media every 2-3 days. Due to tensile strength and intrinsic remodeling within matrix, the matrix will contract drastically and become reduced to a smaller, but thicker native matrix, and is ready to be utilized for invasion assay.\n3. Invasion Assay with Tumor SCC Keratinocytes\nPick up the native matrix gently with blunt forceps and transfer to Nylon net. Once on the Nylon net, spread the matrix gently to lie as flat as possible using a 1 ml micropipette tip and blunt forceps.\nPrepare the sterile clonal cylinders by smearing a small amount of sterile Vaseline on one end.\nPlace the clonal cylinders on the native matrix, with the Vaseline side down. This is to ensure a tight seal between the native matrix and the clonal rings.\nAdd cSCC cells to the clonal cylinders (250,000 cells in 100 µl of keratinocyte growth media).\nRemove the clonal cylinders after 6 hr when the cSCC cells have settled down on the native matrix.\nLift the Nylon net with the native matrix and cSCC cells to air-liquid interface onto bent stainless steel wire mesh support.",
    "Add keratinocyte growth media supplemented with ascorbic acid until the media level touches the bottom of the native matrix.\nChange media every 2-3 days and harvest at 7 and 14 days post-seeding of cSCC cells.\n4. Harvesting of 3D Cultures and Preparation for Histology\nFix in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at room temperature.\nBisect the samples and embed in wax for formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks, with the cut surface facing outwards.\nAlternatively, embed the bisected samples in OCT and snap-freeze immediately in liquid nitrogen for fresh frozen tissue blocks.\nCut 4 μm sections on microtome and dewax (if necessary). Stain using standard haematoxylin and eosin. To visualize the cSCC cells, mouse monoclonal antibody against keratin 14 (LL001, in-house) can be used in immunohistology staining.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
