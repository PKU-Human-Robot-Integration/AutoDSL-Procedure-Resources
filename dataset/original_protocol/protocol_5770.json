    "Preparation of cell extractsNon-inducing conditions Grow Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (PAO1, KatA-less and KatB-less) overnight in 30 ml of LB medium in 150 ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). Centrifuge the cultures (20 ml) in 50 ml Falcon tubes for 10 min, 10,000 x g, 4 °C. Discard the supernatants. Resuspend the cells with 20 ml of cold saline solution and keep them on ice. Centrifuge for 10 min, 10,000 x g, 4 °C. Discard the supernatants. Resuspend the cells in ice-cold 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7 up to OD650 1 (about 7 ml). Sonicate 5 ml of concentrated cells in plastic tubes in an ice-water bath (Figure 1) under the following conditions: 2 min in pulsed mode, 18 mm tip diameter, 50% duty cycle, microtip limit 2. Keep the samples on ice.Centrifuge the extracts for 10 min, 10,000 x g, 4 °C. Discard the pellets carrying unlysed cells and cellular debris. Keep the supernatants on ice for a few hours until using them or store at -80 °C. Determine protein concentration of the extracts according to Lowry et al. (1951); bovine serum albumin is used as a standard.Inducing conditions Grow Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (PAO1 and KatB-less) overnight in 30 ml of LB medium in 150 ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). Dilute overnight cultures in 30 ml of fresh LB medium in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks to OD650 0.01 and grow in a gyratory water bath shaker at 37 °C until the cultures reach an OD650 0.3. This OD is reached in about 2 h.Divide the cultures into two fractions of 10 ml each in 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Maintain one of them untreated (control) and add 2.",
    "26 µl of 30 mM H2O2 to the other fraction every 10 min for 1 h under sterile conditions, while shaking both fractions at 37 °C. Take 5 ml of the treated cultures at the end of 1 h and add 10 μl of 1 mg/ml sodium thiosulfate to neutralize the effect of H2O2; it is not necessary to keep the samples on ice.Centrifuge the neutralized cultures and 5 ml of the control cultures for 10 min, 10,000 x g, 4 °C. Discard the supernatants. Resuspend the cells with 10 ml of ice-cold 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.Centrifuge for 10 min, 10,000 x g, 4 °C. Discard the supernatants. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent and keep for 15 min at room temperature. Centrifuge for 10 min, 16,000 x g, 4 °C. Keep the supernatants on ice for a few hours until using them or store at -80 °C.Determine protein concentration of the extracts according to Lowry et al. (1951); bovine serum albumin is used as a standard. The protocol for inducing conditions is schematized in Figure 2.Notes: Antibiotics are not added to culture media.BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent was employed instead of sonication to detect KatB activity. This reagent is capable of cell wall perforation without denaturing soluble proteins. It provides an alternative to mechanical methods such as French Press or sonication for releasing proteins. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531021706_4027.jpgFigure 2.

    "Wait for 15-30 min until it solidifies.Take the glass plates out of the gel casting stand and set them into the electrophoresis cell. Pour running buffer into the electrophoresis cell until the buffer level is higher than the top of the (shorter) inner gel plate (i.e., until the buffer covers the wells).Mix 50 µl of the cell extracts with 2 µl of loading buffer in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and heat them in boiling water for 10 min.Load 10 µg of protein per sample into each well. Cover the cell with the lid and connect the electrodes to the power supply.Run the electrophoresis at 15 mA at room temperature (non-inducing conditions, KatA activity) or at 4 °C (inducing conditions, KatB activity). Note: Electrophoresis is run at 4 °C for detecting KatB activity. This can be done in a cold room or in a refrigerator. However, this is not necessary for the detection of KatA activity.Stop PAGE running when the dye front almost reaches the foot line of the glass plate. The run generally takes 4 h.Gel developmentRemove the glass plates from the electrophoresis tank and place them on a paper towel. Separate the plates by using a spatula. Soak the gel in distilled water in a Pyrex tray for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the water.Incubate the gel with 100 ml of a solution containing 4 mM H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature.Remove the solution and wash the gel with 100 ml of distilled water at room temperature.Soak the gel in 100 ml of a solution containing 1% (w/v) ferric chloride and 1% (w/v) potassium ferricyanide at room temperature.As soon as the gel turns dark green, remove the ferric chloride/potassium ferricyanide solution and rinse with distilled water to prevent overdevelopment.",
    "Once the dye has been removed, photograph the gel immediately. Storage in distilled water for a few days at 4 °C is possible. Areas of catalase activity show up as clear bands.Note: It is not necessary to use a shaker or a nutator for the washing and staining steps."
