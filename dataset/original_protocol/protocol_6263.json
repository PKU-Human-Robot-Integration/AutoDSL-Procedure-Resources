    "Fusion proteinsDescription of cloning for preparation of the fusion proteins is out of the scope of the current protocol. Note: In the case of GPCRs, added (Rluc or EYFP) proteins must be at the C terminal end, i.e., cytoplasmic (Figure 2). Exception may occur in special cases (for instance if one wants to look for interactions between the huge extracellular domains of class C GPCRs. In brief, place the cDNAs coding for the proteins of interest without their stop codon inside the pRLuc-N1 or the pEYFP-N1 vectors to obtain the fusion proteins that contain RLuc or EYFP. One of the receptors (R1) should be fused to Rluc and the other one (R2) to EYFP. We recommend trying both pair combinations as, often, one combination works better than the other. For negative control, a non-interacting receptor (R3) should be fused to EYFP to perform BRET using R1-Rluc. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190928/20190928095710_3063.jpgFigure 2. Cartoon representation of the fusion proteins containing Rluc or YFP at the C terminus of each receptorCell culture and transient transfection (any current cell transfection reagent suitable for eukaryotic cells may be used; we routinely use PEI)Grow HEK-293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1% (v/v) MEM Non-Essential Amino Acid Solution and 5% (v/v) heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 humid atmosphere. Cell growth is optimal without need to use higher FBS concentrations. Plate cells in 6-well plates at a density of 250,000 cells/well. A single BRET assay requires 9 transfection conditions, and each will require 2 wells. In total 9 x 2 = 18 wells = three 6-well plates. Discard every batch of cells after 10 passages and thaw a new liquid nitrogen-stored vial.Twenty-four hours after plating, transfect HEK cells (they should be ~50% confluent).",
    "Increase the amount of the EYFP plasmid every two wells (as above indicated, same transfection conditions are performed in 2 wells). Rluc must be kept relatively constant and this requires preliminary assays to optimize the EYFP/Rluc ratios. An example of transfection conditions is given in Table 1. The first condition, that contains only RLuc, is used as a blank for cell fluorescence. In further experiments, DNA amounts must be adjusted to obtain the desired protein-RLuc and protein-EYFP expression values (see below).Table 1. Example of DNA amounts used for transfection (total DNA required for two wells needed for every condition is shown)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190928/20190928095743_9171.pngAdd 250 µl 150 mM NaCl (per tube) to each of 9 sterile 15 ml centrifuge tubes.Add the desired amount of DNA and mix using vortex.In parallel, prepare a mixture of 40 µM PEI and 150 mM NaCl (1:20), vortex vigorously.Add 250 µl of the PEI:NaCl mixture to each tube, mix using vortex. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Add 1.5 ml/tube of non-supplemented DMEM, mix (now each tube should contain 2 ml of transfection mixture).Aspirate the culture medium from the 6-well plates and add carefully 1 ml of the transfection mixture to each well.Place cells in the incubator for 4 h at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 humid atmosphere.Replace the transfection mixture with 2 ml of supplemented DMEM and place again cells in the incubator for 48 h.Cell preparation for BRET assayPrepare HBSS (see Recipes) supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) glucose, prewarm the mixture in the water bath at 37 °C.Aspirate culture medium from transfected cells.Wash cells with the prewarmed solution of HBSS-glucose.Add 1 ml HBSS-glucose per well.Detach cells, pool cells from the 2 wells with the same transfection condition in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube.Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g (room temperature).",
    "Resuspend each pellet in 200 µl of HBSS-glucose.To adjust the protein amount, proceed to Bradford protein assay.In a 96-well transparent microplate, add 10 µl/well of each bovine serum albumin (BSA) dilution (0-1 mg/ml; in duplicates).Add 10 µl cell sample/well.Add Bradford reagent (200 µl/well; previously diluted 1:5 in MilliQ water).Shake the plate at room temperature for 2 min.Read the absorbance at 595 nm.Use GraphPad software to calculate the standard parameters and use them to calculate protein concentration in each cell suspension. Calculate the amount of HBSS-glucose that must be added to each cell suspension to obtain a protein concentration equivalent to 0.2 mg/ml.Assessing the amount of EYFP expressionLoad 100 µl/well (20 µg protein) of each sample (in duplicates) on 96-well black microplates with transparent bottom. Using a Fluostar Optima Fluorimeter plate reader, excite samples with a high-energy xenon flash lamp using a 10 nm bandwidth excitation filter at 485 nm, and read fluorescence at 530 nm. See example fluorescence measurements in Table 2.Table 2. Example of fluorescence measurements from protein-EYFP expression for each of the conditions indicated in Table 1imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190928/20190928095833_8092.pngBRET measurementsPrepare a Coelenterazine H: HBSS-glucose dilution from the Coelenterazine H stock (see Recipes) (1:40), keep on ice and protected from light. Load 90 µl/well of each cell suspension (in duplicates) on 96-well white microplates with opaque bottom.Add 10 µl/well of the Coelenterazine H solution (final concentration of coelenterazine is 5 µM); gently shake the plate. Read the energy transfer (e.g., on a Mithras LB 940 plate reader) 1 min after the addition of coelenterazine H, using a 485 nm filter (short wavelength) to detect the bioluminescence emitted by protein-Rluc, and a 530 nm filter (long-wavelength) to detect the fluorescence emitted by protein-EYFP upon energy transfer from protein-RLuc.",
    "The Mithras reader is able to integrate both wavelengths and provide the BRET values, that is, the ratio between the two readings (see Table 3 for examples of BRET readings).Table 3. Example of BRET readings for each of the conditions indicated in Table 1imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190928/20190928095917_3353.pngAssessing the amount of Rluc expressionTo determine protein-Rluc expression, read the bioluminescence of the sample 10 min after the addition of coelenterazine H on the Mithras LB 940 plate reader using the 485 nm filter (use the same samples used for BRET readings). See Table 4 for examples of protein-RLuc readings.Table 4.
