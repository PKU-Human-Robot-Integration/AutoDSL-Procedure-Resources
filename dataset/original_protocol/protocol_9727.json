    "The study design was approved by the Basque Country Ethics Committee and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained either from participants enrolled in the study or their legal guardians. Figure 1 represents the protocol steps.\n1. Participant Recruitment\nRecruit patients with the following characteristics: between 7-14 years of age with refractive amblyopia and/or successfully treated strabismic amblyopia (strabismus children are only eligible to participate if misalignment of the visual axes has been successfully corrected with glasses, visual therapy, and/or strabismus surgery); with monocular best corrected distance visual acuity of ≥0.1 logMAR21; and stereoacuity measured in the 800\"-200\" range (coarse-moderate stereo-deficiency)22 according to a random-dot stereogram test23.\n\t\nTo determine \"refractive amblyopia\", consider the interocular refractive difference error by means of autorefraction under cycloplegia.\n\t\tNOTE: Anisometropic amblyopia is defined when a patient presents an interocular refractive difference error of ≥1 spherical dioptre (D), (spherical equivalent). Isometropic amblyopia is defined when the cycloplegic refractive error in each eye of ≥4.00 D hypermetropia or myopia and/or ≥2.00 D astigmatism and the interocular refractive difference error is <1 D.\nTo determine successfully treated strabismic amblyopia, check for the absence of strabismus using a monocular cover-uncover test and stimulating accommodation with a letter acuity score of 20/30 to ensure that the subject looks at the letter with the fovea when performing the fixing movement24.\nExclude patients with the following characteristics: strabismus; hyperphoria (upward deviation) of 2 prism diopters or more; nystagmus; hypermetropic anisometropia, in which the patient presents a spherical equivalent difference between the eyes of 3 diopters (or more) if corrected with glasses (to prevent aniseikonia); any ocular pathology; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and any cognitive disorder. Exclude patients without access to a computer or without internet connection at home.\n2. Visual Evaluations",
    "Perform the Baseline Optometric Evaluation prior to beginning this section for collection of baseline data and ensure all appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\t\nMeasure best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS visual acuity chart).\nCheck for the absence of strabismus as explained in step 1.1.2.\nMeasure stereoacuity at a constant distance of 40 cm, under light illumination of 120 cd/m2.\n\t\tNOTE: Illumination control guarantees contrast consistency between dots and background in the test pattern. Patient head-to-test distance is a critical variable because it is included in the equation that sets stereoacuity result.\n\t\t\nMeasure global stereoacuity with a random-dot stereogram (to avoid monocular cues) conducted according to the test manufacturer's instructions.\nMeasure local stereoacuity using a contour test despite the presence of monocular cues with a Wirt Circles test conducted according to the test manufacturer's instructions.\nMeasure the refractive error by cycloplegic refraction (1% cyclopentolate) following Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) guidelines25,26.\nRule out any ocular pathology with an in-depth study of the anterior (slit lamp) and posterior (indirect ophthalmoscope) poles.\nConducting the optometric center first visit with patients.\n\t\nCreate a patient profile in the game service application.\n\t\t\nSet the patient's user identifier and password.\nSet the patient's interpupillary distance.\nInstall the computerized stereoscopic game on the patient's computer.\nConfigure the game by clicking on the configuration panel.\n\t\t\nSet the physical dimensions of the patient's computer screen.\nEnsure that the user is wearing the anaglyph glasses correctly (with the red filter over the left eye).\nMeasure the patient's stereopsis basal acuity using the computerized stereoscopic game.\n\t\t\nAsk the patient to play the game under supervision, as explained in section 3.4.\nConsult the result stored in the cloud using the game service application.",
    "Using patient stereopsis basal acuity, set the patient's basal level in the game service application.\n\t\t\nThe computerized stereoscopic game defines three stimulation categories, each associated with a stereoscopic acuity interval value: poor (840\"-300\"), coarse (480\" -210\") and moderate-fine stereopsis (300\" -30\"). Patients begin with the finest level at which they can identify the stereopsis stimulus. For example, in a patient with a stereo threshold of 720\", assign the poor stereopsis level on the patient's profile.\nExplain to participants how to perform the exercises at home, as explained in section 3.\nPerform check-up visits on completion of every 15 therapy sessions with the computerized stereoscopic game during the training period.\n\t\nOpen the game service application, open the patient profile and check both compliance and stereopsis results data.\n\t\t\nRemind parents and participants about the importance of respecting the working distance from the screen.\nRemind parents and participants about the importance of compliance.\nEvaluate the logMAR BCVA at distance with an ETRDS test to check for any deterioration from the starting values.\nMeasure the patient's stereopsis acuity using the computerized stereoscopic game (step 2.2.4)\nSet the patient's basal level in the game service application (step 2.2.5).\nPerform the final optometric evaluation on completion of 60 therapy sessions with the computerized stereoscopic game (end of treatment) to collect outcome data.\n\tNOTE: This evaluation reproduces the baseline optometric evaluation, stressing the measurement of global and local stereopsis.\nPerform the follow-up optometric evaluation 6 months after completion to ensure stability of the results.\n\tNOTE: This evaluation reproduces the baseline optometric evaluation, stressing the measurement of global and local stereopsis.\n3. Treatment Exercises Performed at Home\nExplain to participants that they must follow a course of training using the computerized stereoscopic game at home for sixty 8 min sessions.",
    "Explain that each session must be performed on a different day and that five sessions per week must be completed. Explain to patients that the research team will have access to their compliance and results data in the cloud.\nInstruct patients to visit the optometry center for a check-up visit after every 15 sessions, which should be completed within 3 weeks to consider compliance as 100%, and in all cases, within a maximum of 6 weeks.\nExplaining how to use the computerized stereoscopic game\n\t\nAsk the participant to sit at a distance of 80 cm from the computer screen. Make it clear that patients should not try to cheat the program by moving closer to the screen.\nEnsure that the room is dimly lit, avoiding any reflections on the computer screen.\nExplain that the program takes the form of a videogame, in which a random-dot image conceals a hidden silhouette. The silhouette can only be seen in three dimensions while wearing anaglyph glasses.\nGive the patient a pair of anaglyph glasses and explain how to wear them, focusing on which filter goes to which eye (with the red filter over the left eye).\nProvide the patient with an identifier and password to log in to the game (step 2.2.1).\nInstruct the patient to use the mouse to select which silhouette appears, selecting one figure from the four options shown at the bottom of the screen (Figure 2).\nExplain what happens after the selection of a silhouette.\n\t\t\nIf the answer is correct, the software emits a high-pitched sound, and the correct image appears in the form of a full-color picture as a reward.\nIf the answer is incorrect, the software emits a deep sound. The player still has two more attempts to find the right answer.",
    "If there are three consecutive wrong answers, the software will show the correct answer.\nExplain to the patient that after each trial, the software generates a new screen with a random-dot image concealing a new hidden silhouette.\nExplain to the patient that the hidden silhouette becomes more difficult to find as the session progresses and that this is normal.\nExplain to the patient that, once the session is complete, the software stores the outcomes in a cloud server, allowing the optometrist to track compliance and stereoacuity evolution remotely.\n\t\tNOTE: Stress the importance of a stable Wi-Fi connection and of closing the computerized stereoscopic game properly."
