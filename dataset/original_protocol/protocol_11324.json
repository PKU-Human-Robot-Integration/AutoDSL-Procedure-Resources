  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures were performed in accordance with an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol of the University of Colorado Denver (protocol # 00250).\n1. Tumor Cell Culture\nNOTE: B4B8 and LY2 cell lines were used to generate orthotopic HNSCC tumors: B4B8 tumor cells were derived from carcinogen-transformed mucosal keratinocytes (from BALB/C mice)11. LY2 tumor cells were derived from lymph node metastases of a spontaneously transformed BALB/C keratinocyte line (Pam 212)12,13. Both cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Nadarajah Vigneswaran (UTHealth, Houston, TX, USA).\nUse Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) F/12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antimicrobial reagent for the cell line maintenance. Maintain these cell lines in a sterile incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells should be used for inoculation before exceeding 15 passages.\nPlate 2 x 106 to 4 x 106 cells in 175 cm2 cell culture flasks.\nNOTE: Ensure the cells are less than 90% confluent to avoid inducing a stress response.\nWhen the cells are 70% confluent (~48 h), remove the flask from the incubator and wash the cells 3x with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nDetach the cells from the flask using 0.25% trypsin, enough to cover the surface of the plate.\n\t\nTo do this, dispense 4 mL of trypsin in a 175 cm2 flask containing 70% confluent cells. Incubate the cells with trypsin for 3–4 min in the cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nVisualize the cells under a microscope to ensure cell detachment.\nAdd 12 mL of DMEM F/12 media containing FBS to neutralize trypsin activity.\nAspirate the cell suspension and place it into a 50 mL conical tube.\nShake the tube containing the cells by inverting it 3x–4x.",
    "Optionally, mix a 10 µL aliquot of cell suspension with 10 µL of Trypan blue in a microcentrifuge tube and count the cells using a hemocytometer. Determine cell viability by subtracting the number of Trypan-blue-positive cells from the total number of cells and divide by the total number of cells.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the cells in serum-free and antibiotic-free DMEM at an appropriate volume so that 1 x 106 cells are present in 50 µL of media.\nNOTE: Based on the in vivo cell line aggressiveness (determined empirically), 1 x 106 cells per injection site per mouse was deemed appropriate for B4B8 and LY2 cells.\nPlace the vial containing the cell suspension on ice.\nPlace the pre-thawed basement membrane matrix on ice.\nNOTE: The basement membrane matrix was thawed overnight at 4 °C.\n2. Cell Injection into Mice\nPrepare a 1:1 mixture of cells:basement membrane matrix (50 µL each).\nAdd the cells first; then, gradually pipette the basement membrane matrix. Avoid introducing air bubbles. Ensure that the mixture is made immediately before the animal injection. Adding cells to basement membrane matrix for an extended period of time can result in cell settling in the matrix mixture, which makes the mixture difficult to shake rigorously. This will cause a considerable variability in tumor size between mice.\nMix gently. Ensure all steps involving matrix are performed on ice. Basement membrane matrix will polymerize at room temperature.\nPrepare syringes for inoculation.\nLoad 0.5 mL insulin syringes (23 G) with 100 µL of the cell/basement membrane matrix solution.\nKeep the syringes on ice to avoid basement membrane matrix polymerization.\nAnesthetize mice by placing them in a chamber with isoflurane and oxygen (2.5%).",
    "Ensure the mice are deeply anesthetized before performing the injection (by ensuring a lack of response to a toe pinch).\nInsert the needle into the right or left buccal region. This is performed through the available open space on either side of the mouth.\nEnsure that the mouse’s tongue is not in the way.\nNOTE: It is easy to poke the tongue, which will result in tongue tumors. Move the tongue to the opposite side if necessary.\nKeep the syringe parallel to the buccal region while inside the oral cavity.\nWhen ready to inject, pull the syringe back and slowly insert the syringe at a 10° angle.\nInject 100 µL of the cell/basement membrane matrix suspension over a period of 5 s.\nHold the syringe in place for an additional 5 s to ensure all material is injected.\nNOTE: For control nontumor-bearing mice, inject a mixture of serum-free media and matrix (as described above) without the tumor cells.\nWithdraw the syringe gently.\nContinue the above procedure with the remaining mice.\nAllow for 1 week until tumors begin to appear grossly (50–200 mm3 for B4B8 and LY2 cells).\n3. Mouse Monitoring\nPerform the first measurement using calipers at 1 week after the tumor cell injection. In order to calculate the tumor volume using external calipers, determine the greatest longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest transverse diameter (width) and use the modified ellipsoidal formula14,15.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59195/59195eq1.jpg\nContinue to perform regular caliper measurements for tumor volume (1x–2x per week at regular intervals).\nMeasure animal weight to assess the effects of tumor growth on feeding.\n4. Harvesting Tumors\nWhen the experimental endpoint is reached, euthanize the animals using appropriate measures (e.g., CO2 asphyxiation, decapitation, or cervical dislocation).",
    "NOTE: In this study, the endpoint was reached if the mice became moribund (with a weight loss of >15% of their initial weight, a lack of grooming, cachexia) and/or if the tumor size reached 1,000 mm3.\nBegin dissecting the animal by creating a long incision through the midline in the neck region.\nUse blunt forceps to grab the skin and sharp scissors to cut the skin.\nInsert scissors gently under the skin covering the tumor and create air pockets by pushing the scissors across and into the skin.\nOnce the skin is sufficiently detached from the tumor, identify the draining lymph nodes (DLNs) and excise them to avoid having the tumor tissue confounded by the presence of lymph nodes.\nNOTE: Large tumors may reach and/or cover the DLN. Depending on the type of assay being performed, the isolation of intact lymph nodes is essential to avoid spillage of immune cells into the tumor, which will result in skewing the assay results.\nCut through the borders of the tumor until the entire volume is detached.\n5. Tumor Processing for Downstream Applications\nFor the downstream histologic examination, place tumors in 10% formalin at room temperature. To avoid overfixation, replace the formalin with 70% ethanol. For flow cytometry analysis, process the tumors as described below.\nNOTE: The tissue can be kept in formalin for 72 h before overfixation can become problematic for certain types of staining.\nCut the tumor into 1–2 mm-sized pieces using a sterile razor blade or sharp scissors.\nPlace the cut tumor pieces in a 50 mL conical tube with collagenase III (4,250 units per sample), DNase I (0.1 mg per sample), and trypsin inhibitor (1 mg per sample).\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking every 10 min.",
    "NOTE: The samples can be placed in a resealable bag, sterilized with 90% ethanol, and placed in a cell culture incubator.\nAfter 30 min, add 20 mL of Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) and spin at 300 x g for 5 min.\nNOTE: HBSS is comprised of potassium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium phosphate dibasic, sodium phosphate monobasic and glucose.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2–3 mL of red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer. Pipette rigorously.\nNOTE: RBC lysis buffer is comprised of ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and disodium.\nIncubate for 2 min at room temperature.\nNOTE: Longer incubation can be toxic to other cell populations.\nAdd 20 mL of HBSS to neutralize the effect of lysis buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of HBSS.\nPass the solution through a 70 µm nylon restrainer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 5.8–5.10 and pass the cell suspension through a 40 µm nylon restrainer to ensure any additional debris is removed from the suspension.\n6. Cell Staining and Data Acquisition\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of HBSS.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter, as described in step 1.7\nDetermine the total cell number and appropriate concentration for staining.\n\tNOTE: The ideal cell concentration for flow cytometry staining is 1–2 million cells. For example, if staining is performed in a 96-well plate and there are 10 million cells, resuspend the sample in 1 mL and plate 100 µL for 1 million cells per well.",
    "Add Fc block (CD16/CD32) at a concentration of 1:100 in order to prevent nonantigen-specific binding of immunoglobulins to the FcγIII and FcγII receptors. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge and resuspend the cell pellet in 100 µL of flow cytometry cell staining buffer (comprised of saline solution containing 5% FBS, 2% EDTA, and 1% HEPES).\nPerform cell surface staining according to supplier-provided instructions (adding each antibody at the appropriate dilution). Incubate for 60 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge and resuspend the cell pellet in 100 µL of HBSS. Repeat 2x to get rid of excess antibody.\nRun samples on an appropriate flow cytometer.\nIf analyzing intracellular markers (e.g., foxp3), perform cell permeabilization and staining according to the supplier’s instructions.\nSubscription Required.
