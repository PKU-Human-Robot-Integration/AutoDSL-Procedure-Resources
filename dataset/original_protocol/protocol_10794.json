    "This protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and was in accordance with all guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of China. There was no accidental death situation during the experimental procedure, and no animals needed to be euthanized in this study.\n1. Preparing Drugs for the Experiment\nNOTE: The Chinese herbs were purchased and then authenticated by Dr. B. Liu of the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. Xiaoyaosan contains the following eight traditional Chinese drugs in a ratio of 6:6:6:6:3:6:2:2: Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Radix Paeoniae Alba, Poria, Radix Bupleuri, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, Herba Menthae and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens,.\nPrepare Xiaoyaosan as previously described16.\n\tNote: We extracted these compounds in the Chinese medicine preparation room of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and the extraction yield was 18.8%.\nVerify the quality of Xiaoyaosan by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS)17.\n2. Preparing Mice for the Experimental Procedure\nNOTE: For the experimental procedure, 60 healthy male C57BL/6J mice aged 12 weeks were selected, with each mouse weighing between 18 and 22 g.\nKeep mice individually in cages in a typical Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) laboratory animal room (22 ± 1 °C, 12 h/12 h dark/light cycle, relative humidity: 30–40%) for one week before the CUMS procedure.\nRandomly divide all mice into a control group, a model group, a Xiaoyaosan treatment group, or a fluoxetine treatment group according to their body weight. Each group has 15 mice.\nBefore initiation of the experiment, number the mice in each group on their tail using a marking pen.\nTest all mice using a five-day sucrose preference test (refer to step 5) and an open field test (refer to step 6).\n3. Induction of Depression in Mice",
    "NOTE: To induce depression, the mice in the model group and two treatment groups underwent CUMS for 21 days18. The plan can be changed according to the practical situation, but the principle that the same stressor cannot be used continuously should be followed.\nExpose mice daily to any two of the following seven stressors for 21 consecutive days19. Our modeling plan is designed as follows:\nOn Monday, expose mice to food deprivation (empty the feed of each cage for 24 h, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.) and water deprivation (remove the drinking bottle of each cage for 24 h, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.).\nOn Tuesday, expose mice to restraint stress (restrain mice in a small plastic tub for 3 h, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.) and empty cages (remove the padding in each cage for 11 h, 8:00 a.m. to 19:00 p.m.).\nOn Wednesday, expose mice to wet and soiled cages (pour water into each cage and keep wet for 24 h, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.) and crowded cages (put five mice in one cage for 24 h, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.).\nOn Thursday, expose mice to restraint stress and ice-cold swimming20,21 (force each mouse to swim in a clear glass aquarium with ice water for 5 min).\nOn Friday, expose mice to wet and soiled cages and food deprivation.\nOn Saturday, expose mice to restraint stress and crowded cages.\nOn Sunday, expose mice to empty cages and ice-cold swimming.",
    "Record the coat state and body weight weekly until the end of modeling (day 21). Calculate the total score of the coat state as the sum of scores from seven different body parts: head, neck, dorsal coat, ventral coat, forepaws, tail, and hind paws. A score of one indicates a well-groomed coat, and a score of zero indicates an unkempt coat22.\nPerform a five-day sucrose preference test (refer to step 5) and an open field test (refer to step 6) at the end of experiment.\n4. Administration of Xiaoyaosan\nNOTE: The dose of Xiaoyaosan (0.25 g/kg/day) was selected on the basis of its satisfactory efficacy as previously described9.\nDuring the experiment, use distilled water to prepare the Xiaoyaosan and fluoxetine suspensions, and make sure to use immediately.\nGive 0.5 mL of distilled water to the mice in the control group and model group by intragastric administration every day before modeling. Meanwhile, give Xiaoyaosan (0.25 g/kg/day) or fluoxetine (2.6 mg/kg/day) to the mice in the two treatment groups.\n5. Sucrose Preference Test\nNOTE: No water or food deprivation was applied before the test. The protocol was performed as previously reported23.\nOn the first two days, house the mice individually with two bottles filled with tap water.\nOn the next two days, give the mice two bottles filled with 1% sucrose solution.\nOn the last day, give the mice two bottles for 24 h, one with tap water and the other with 1% sucrose solution. To eliminate a side preference of the mice in drinking behavior, switch the position of the two bottles after 12 h.\nRecord the volume (mL) of both the consumed sucrose solution and tap water. Calculate the sucrose preference as follows: sucrose preference (%) = sucrose consumption/total liquid consumption × 100%.\n6. Open Field Test",
    "Perform the open field test in a dimly lit and quiet room with a four-sided wooden black lusterless box. Divide the ﬂoor into 25 equal squares by blue lines.\nClean the open-field box with 5% alcohol prior to the access of each mouse. Then, place the mouse in the center of the open field gently.\nSuspend a high definition digital camera approximately 200 cm right above the field, and record the behavior of each mouse for 5 min.\nEvaluate the mice behavioral video by the video-tracking system software and record the data of the total running distance and number of entries into the center zone.\nAnalyze the data of the total distance moved and number of entries into the center zone by statistical software.\nSubscription Required.
