    "Fly preparation and injuryNote: Aside from the physical leg amputation, control flies should be treated exactly the same as experimental flies. Prepare fly crosses at a standard density of 20 female and 5 male flies for two days at 25°C, 65% humidity, and a 12 h light/dark cycle before removing parents.Two days following initial pupae eclosion, place F1 progeny into containers and allow to mate for two days.Select healthy, intact male flies on light CO2 (less than 5 L/min CO2 using a Flowbuddy, delivered through a Flypad) at a standard density in standard Drosophila vials and allow to age until flies are between 7-9 days old, flipping onto new food every 2 days.Under light CO2, amputate the right middle leg femur using surgical scissors and also expose control uninjured animals to CO2 in parallel (Figure 1).Place one fly per vial and allow to recover for a further 7 days, flipping onto new food every 2 days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4079/bioprotoc-11-13-4079-g001.jpgFigure 1. Leg injury model showing the location of femur amputation Hot plate preparationObtain an aluminium square plate with dimensions matching the diameter of the hot plate (ensure this plate is between 1-5 mm thick to ensure efficient heat transfer).Using thin layers, paint the aluminium plate with white matte paint.Note: Spray paint works best for this. Painting white is to ensure good tracking, as dark flies on a white background works best; however, if this is not a concern, skip this step.Once the paint has dried, place the aluminium plate over the top of the Ugo Basil Hot/Cold plate (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4079/bioprotoc-11-13-4079-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Simplified overhead view showing the location of the aluminium plate above the Ugo Basile hot/cold plate and arena.Arena preparationTake the 35-60-mm diameter Petri dish lid and using sandpaper, remove most of the walls until they are between 1-2 mm high.Treat with Sigmacote to help stop the flies from climbing on the walls and ceiling.Note: 1-2 coats may be necessary. Generating a standard curveSet the hot plate to ramp from 25°C to 50°C over 3 min.Using a heat-transferring medium, place the tip of a digital thermal probe in the centre of the plate (or roughly where the fly will be).Allow the plate to run and cool several times and record the temperature every 2 s for 3 min and 15 s.Notes: This is best done by recording the readout with a camera, C920 HD pro webcam, or similar.This will be used later to correlate the time of the behaviour to the temperature at that time. Hot plate assaySet the hot plate to ramp from 25°C to 50°C over 3 min.Place an individual fly onto the plate and quickly cover/capture with the premade arena.Notes: This can be done by simply flipping an individual fly onto the plate from its vial and rapidly covering with the arena (less than 30 s recovery is required for this method). Alternatively, aspirators or light anaesthesia with ice can be used (between 1-2 min and then allow double that time for recovery). CO2 should not be used to anaesthetise flies on the day of the nociception experiment as this may affect behaviour. Start the camera (1080 p and 30 fps) and the hot plate at the same time and record for 3 min and 15 s (195 s) before allowing the plate to cool again.Note: Multiple external fans can be used to aid cooling.",
    "Before beginning the next experimental replicate, ensure the plate has returned to 25°C using a thermal probe.Repeat five times per experimental group (i.e., 5 control flies and 5 injured flies) for one technical replicate.Technical replicates should be performed on separate days to avoid same-day experimental error."
