Step-by-step schematic representation of dissection and mounting\n(A) Desired tissue is dissected and cleaned in 1× PBS.\n(B) Fixation is done in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and the tissue is washed 3 times for 10 min each before incubating overnight (∼8–16 h) in primary antibody. The tissue is then washed 3 times for 10 min each and incubated in secondary antibody for 2 h followed by washes. In this study we processed the tissue after secondary for TUNEL assay.\n(C) The washed tissue was then mounted onto a slide and visualized under confocal microscope.\nDissection is performed in cold 1× Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) for no longer than 20 min at room temperature (RT) (21°C–23°C).\nNote: Tissue is prone to disintegration if left for longer periods without fixation. It is crucial to dissect as quickly as possible and transfer the tissue into the fixative solution. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nFix tissue in freshly prepared 4% Paraformaldehyde (diluted in 1× PBS) for 20 min at RT.\nNote: Fixation is a critical step to maintain the morphology and antigenicity within the cells. Longer exposures to fixatives can lead to improper or no staining. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nWash the tissue in 1× PBS once followed by washes in PBST (1×PBS+0.2% Triton-X-100) three times for 10 min each.\nPrepare primary antibody (Rat anti-Elav) at a 1:100 dilution in 10% Normal Donkey Serum (NDS) in 1XPBST (PBST-NDS) solution.\nIncubate in primary antibody overnight (∼8–16 h) at 4°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nSecondary antibody incubation, TUNEL labeling – Day 2\nTiming: 6–8 h",
    "Wash the tissue in 1× PBST, thrice for 10 min each.\nPrepare secondary antibody (anti-Rat Cy5) at a dilution of 1:300 in 1× PBST-NDS.\nNote: Do not use Cy3 secondary antibody as that will overlap with the TUNEL signal in the same channel.\nIncubate the tissue in a secondary antibody for 2 h in the dark at RT.\nWash the tissue in 1× PBST thrice for 10 min each.\nIncubate in freshly prepared 495 μL of 100 mM Sodium Citrate stock solution + 5 μL of 10% Triton X-100 for 30 min in the dark at 65°C.\nNote: Prepare freshly the Sodium Citrate and Triton X-100 solution with 500 μL per tube every time.\nWash the tissue in 1× PBST, thrice for 10 min each.\nIncubate the tissue in ∼30 μL of TUNEL-Dilution Buffer (Roche) for 10 min in the dark at RT.\nIncubate the tissue in a TUNEL labeling solution for 2 h at 37°C.\nNote: For our experiments, we have used the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR red. Alternatively, the fluorescein kits can also be used. In case of using GFP or mCherry reporters in the crosses, only TMR or fluorescein kits can be used respectively. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nWash the tissue in 1× PBST, thrice for 10 min each.\nNote: 1XPBST helps in effective washing and removal of excess antibodies. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nMounting\nTiming: 20–30 min\nTransfer the tissue onto a clean glass slide and carefully remove the brain lobes and detach the eye-antennal imaginal discs from the mouth hooks (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nArrange the eye-antennal discs on the slide and remove excess PBST.\nMount in Vectashield mounting medium. Store the slides in a slide holder that can be stored at −20°C.\nImaging and analysis\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "Image the slides under a confocal microscope using appropriate channels.\nAll images were taken in 20 X magnification. The confocal parameters were set to gain: 1, offset: 3%. The intensities of all the lasers and photomultiplier tube (PMT) detectors were optimized and set to avoid excessive or weak signal. The Hi–Lo feature in the software was used to assess the intensity saturation of the lasers hitting the sample.\nNote: See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]\nTUNEL labeling will be visible in the Cy3 channel if you use this In Situ Cell Death Detection, TMR red Kit. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nSave all images in the original and other appropriate formats for later analysis.\nThe .tif images are used for quantification of TUNEL positive nuclei.\nPerform statistical analysis using MS Excel or GraphPad Prism and plot a graph."
