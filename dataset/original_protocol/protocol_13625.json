    "The procedures performed in this manuscript comply with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. The institutional animal care committee of the University of Alberta approved the protocols. Female juvenile Yorkshire pigs between 35-50 kg were used exclusively. Proper biosafety training was required by all individuals involved in ESLP procedures. A schematic overview of the entire NPV-ESLP experiment is represented in Figure 1.\n1. Pre-surgical preparations\nPosition the organ chamber on the ESLP cart and mount the silicon support membrane (see Table of Materials) onto the chamber hooks for suspension.\nAssemble the ESLP tubing, deoxygenator, arterial filter, and centrifugal pump.\nConnect the heat exchanger water lines to the deoxygenator as well as the sweep gas tubing.\nInsert the temperature sensor probe (see Table of Materials) into the deoxygenator.\nSecure the pulmonary artery (PA) flow transducer (see Table of Materials) onto the PA tubing.\n\tNOTE: The flow transducer uses ultrasound to measure the flow and relay it back to the centrifugal pump.\nUse a three-way stopcock to fasten the PA pressure transducer to the PA cannula.\nAttach all tubing connections firmly to prevent leaks, and close all the stopcocks and Luer locks before adding the perfusate.\nPrime the circuit with 1000 mL of modified common hospital ingredient perfusate (CHIP).\n\tNOTE: CHIP is a custom-made low-cost perfusate with an oncotic measurement of 35 mmHg, comparable to proprietary perfusate solutions18.\nInitiate the software after the circuit is primed to facilitate de-airing the pump and lines.\n\t​NOTE: These steps are associated with Figure 2 and Figure 3.\n2. ESLP software initialization, adjustments, and de-airing circuit\nClick on the program shortcut on the monitor to start the ESLP program. Select Scan, Cart 3, Connect, then NPV program followed by Initiate Software.",
    "On the Main page, once the circuit is primed, increase the flow RPMs to 900 to drive air out of the circuit and demonstrate perfusate flow through the PA cannula with a steady stream of fluid.\nAdd 3.375 g piperacillin-tazobactam, 10,000 units of heparin (10,000 U/1.5L perfusate = 6.66 U/L), and 500 mg of methylprednisone to the circuit.\nTake an arterial blood gas (ABG) sample of the perfusate for reference purposes.\nOn the Main page, turn CPAP up to 20 cm H2O (max) and turn it on to check the function. Turn off once the operation is confirmed.\nOn the Main page, turn EIP to -5 cm H20 and turn it on to check the function. Turn off once the process is confirmed.\nOn the Settings page, turn on the heater (click Start Heater) and confirm the function. Change temperature set point on the monitors and confirm a congruent change on the heater monitor on the cart. Turn off once the operation is ensured.\n\tNOTE: The ESLP apparatus used here is equipped with a custom software program (Figure 4). The program allows control of pump speed and ventilation parameters to achieve and maintain desired PA Flow, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), end-expiratory pressure (EEP), end-inspiratory pressure (EIP), respiratory ratio (RR), and inspiratory: expiratory (I:E) ratio. The software computes functional parameters and pressure-volume loops. Table 1 lists all monitoring parameters provided by the software.\n3. Preparations for anesthesia\nAdminister ketamine (20 mg/kg) and atropine (0.05 mg/kg) (intramuscular injections) in the operating room as premedication for the donor pig.\nPlace the pig supine on a heated operating table. Maintain normothermia and proceed with mask induction.\nTitrate oxygen flow in accordance with the animal weight, typically 20-40 mL/kg.\nAdminister isoflurane initially at 4-5%. Then reduce to 3% after 1-2 min.",
    "Evaluate the depth of anesthesia every 5 min. Ensure that the pig has no withdrawal reflex in response to a noxious stimulus.\nOnce the correct depth of anesthesia is confirmed, intubate the pig.\nTarget an oxygen saturation above 90% by placing a pulse oximeter probe on the tongue (preferred) or ear.\nAdjust the oxygen flow (20-40 mL/kg) and the inhalant gas (1-3%) to maintain the anesthesia level.\nMaintain the ventilator settings at a TV 6-10 mL/kg, respiratory rate of 12-30 breaths/min, PEEP 5 cm H2O, Peak Pressure 20 cm H2O.\nShave and wash using iodine to prepare the incision site.\n4. Lung biopsy, exsanguination, and blood collection\nInsert a central line for fluid and heparin administration.\n\t\nMake a 5-8 cm midline incision with electrocautery centered over the trachea and extending cranially from the sternal notch.\nUsing the cautery, divide the skin and the subcutaneous fat.\nTo identify the left or right carotid intravascular bundle lateral to the trachea, divide the midline plane between the strap muscles and separate the connective tissue layers.\nUsing 2-0 silk ties as vessel loops, obtain distal and proximal control of the jugular vein.\nTo control the blood flow, tie the cranial encircling tie and retract upwards on the proximal tie.\nTo accommodate a 7 Fr central line, make a small incision in the vein using the Metzenbaum scissors (~1/3 the vessel's circumference).\nRelease the tension on the proximal vessel loop simultaneously cannulate the vein. Tie down the silk to secure the cannula in the vein at a depth of 10 cm.\nConnect to an IV line of 0.9% Normal Saline after flushing the line with heparin (1 unit/mL). If the pig is intravascularly depleted from dehydration, administer the fluid. Hep-lock any unused ports.\nPerform a median sternotomy",
    "Identify the sternal notch and xiphoid processes as incisional landmarks.\nUse electrocautery to make a midline incision that spans the entire sternum (approximately 40-50 cm) and connects the previous incision at the sternal notch to the xiphoid.\nDivide the subcutaneous tissue and the fascia between the fibers of the pectoralis major muscle. Cauterize any bleeding vessels to maintain hemostasis.\nUse electrocautery to mark the midline along the sternal bone. Use heavy scissors to cut the xiphoid and use a finger to bluntly dissect the pericardium off the posterior table of the sternum to create a palpable space to accommodate the sternal saw.\nApply two towel clips on opposite sides of the sternum at the level of the 4th ribs lateral to the costochondral junction. Purchase the overlying tissue and fascia layer within the towel clips and lift the sternum vertically away from the heart during sternotomy.\nPerform the sternotomy with an electric or air-powered saw, teeth up, starting from the xiphoid towards the sternal notch. To prevent injury to the underlying structures (e.g. pericardium and brachiocephalic vein, and innominate artery), proceed gradually with the saw and retract vertically using towel clips.\n\t\tNOTE: The sternum dives deep posteriorly at the sternal notch, and the saw must be directed posteriorly to complete the sternotomy at that level.\nUse cautery to obtain hemostasis of the bleeding sternum.\n\t\tNOTE: Bone wax can also be employed for this purpose.\nDeliver 1,000 U/kg heparin intravenously. Take an in vivo blood sample 5 min after heparin administration.\nUse a finger to bluntly dissect the pleura off the inner sternum to create space for the sternal retractor.\nInsert a sternal retractor with a handle towards the abdomen and retract gradually to expose the mediastinum fully.",
    "Remove the thymus from the pericardium using a combination of blunt dissection with a finger and electrocautery.\n\tNOTE: It is best to remove the thymus as one large piece rather than small chunks.\nTake a biopsy of the right upper lung lobe for tissue analysis: open the right pleura to expose the right upper lobe. Encircle a 1cm3 portion with 0-silk, tie, and excise this portion of the lung using Metzenbaum scissors.\n\t\nDivide the biopsy into three equal-sized portions, and place one of each in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) gel, formalin, and liquid nitrogen (snap freeze).\nStore the OCT and snap-frozen samples in a -80 °C freezer, and store the formalin samples in a 4 °C refrigerator using a properly sealed container.\n\t\tNOTE: Biopsy samples are stained with hematoxylin-eosin staining to examine the histopathology of lung injury, including interstitial edema, alveolar and interstitial inflammation, interstitial and perivascular neutrophilic infiltrates, and hemorrhage15.\nOpen the pericardium. Tent the pericardium using forceps and make an incision in the midline of the pericardium with Metzenbaum scissors.\n\t\nContinue this incision cranially to the aortic root, then laterally to expose the superior vena cava (SVC). Complete the pericardiotomy caudally and T-off the incision left and right at the level of the cardiac apex.\nEuthanize the pig by exsanguination. Incise the SVC and insert a Poole tipped suction (see Table of Materials) into the lumen, advancing the suction tip to the inferior vena cava (IVC).\n\tNOTE: An incision is made in the anterior wall of the left atrium (LA) to expedite the exsanguination.\n\t\nLift the heart apex and incise the LA 1 cm below the coronary sinus using Metzenbaum scissors. At exsanguination, switch from 100% O2 to room air.",
    "Collect Whole blood: the Poole tip suction is connected to a cell saver device to collect 1200 mL of whole blood, which is spun down to produce 500 mL of packed red blood cells (pRBC).\n\t​NOTE: Cell Saver Protocol Setting: Fill Flow: 300 mL/min, Wash Flow: 100 mL/min, Empty Flow: 150 mL/min, Return Flow: 150 mL/min, Wash Volume: 300 mL, Concentration Flow: 200 mL/min. This will take ~5 min.\n5. Cardiectomy\nPerform the cardiectomy: lift the cardiac apex cranially and continue the previous LA incision laterally to transect the coronary sinus where the left hemi-azygous vein joins it.\nDivide the LA by cutting medially across the anterior surface of PA bifurcation.\nTransect the IVC 1 cm above the diaphragm. Connect this incision to the LA by cutting medially.\nComplete the division of the LA by cutting along the top of the right pulmonary artery heading towards the PA bifurcation.\n\tNOTE: This step excludes the right superior pulmonary vein from the posterior LA.\nLift the IVC cranially and divide the right superior pulmonary vein. Divide the pericardial reflections that coalesce between the main PA and the right atrium (RA)/SVC.\nPut the heart down and transect the SVC. Divide the SVC from the connective tissue layer posteriorly and transect the azygous vein.\nLift the heart cranially, divide the PA at the level of the pulmonary valve. Partially dissect the Aorta from the PA using Metzenbaum scissors, then transect the ascending Aorta.\n\t​NOTE: This completes the cardiectomy.\n6. Pneumonectomy\nPerform the pneumonectomy: check that expiratory tidal volume (TVe) is approximately 10 mL/kg. Switch to 2:1 inspiratory: expiratory ratio to achieve this target. If TV remains < 6mL/kg, increase peak pressures and/or PEEP to achieve 8-10 mL/kg target for maximal alveolar recruitment.",
    "Open the pleura on the pig's left side. Make a horizontal incision along the posterior table of the sternum using Metzenbaum scissors. Make two vertical incisions down the pleura to the phrenic nerve at the superior and inferior borders of the mediastinum.\n\t\nExcise the pleura by cutting along the phrenic nerve. Repeat this step on the right side. Open and remove the diaphragmatic pleura similarly, using the posterior LA cuff as the inferior border, in a similar manner to the phrenic nerve.\nDivide the pleural attachments from the diaphragm towards the left lower lung lobe. Use a Deaver retractor (see Table of Materials) to hold the diaphragm upwards. Divide the inferior pulmonary ligament on the left and continue up towards the hilum.\nAttempt a \"no-touch technique\" with regards to the lung tissue itself.\n\tNOTE: That is, attempt minimal manual manipulation of the lung to prevent trauma.\nOn the right side, divide the IVC and pleural attachments from the diaphragm. Retract the diaphragm upwards using the Deaver retractor. Divide the inferior pulmonary ligament on the right side and continue up towards the hilum.\nDivide the innominate vein and arch vessels to expose the trachea.\nBluntly dissect the tissue surrounding the trachea. With expiratory tidal volumes (TVe) at approximately 10 mL/kg, clamp the trachea using a tubing clamp at maximal inhalation.\nTransect the trachea and lift the clamped portion upwards for the remaining steps to provide surgical traction.\nDissect the posterior trachea from the esophagus using blunt dissection with heavy Metzenbaum scissors and a free hand. Divide any remaining pleural attachments, transect the Aorta above and below the left bronchus, and remove the lungs from the chest with a segment of descending Aorta.",
    "Weigh the lungs with the clamp on and quickly store them in a cooler full of ice. Weight gain during the ESLP run is an indicator of edema formation.\n\t​NOTE: This completes the pneumonectomy.\n7. Placement of the lungs onto the ESLP apparatus\nAdd 500 mL of pRBC to the perfusion circuit (previously primed with 1L of CHIP, step 1.8) to reach a final volume of 1.5 L of perfusate.\n\tNOTE: The hemoglobin concentration is targeted at approximately 50 g/L or a hematocrit of 15%.\nTake photographs of the lungs for data records.\nBiopsy the right middle lung lobe. Encircle a 1cm3 portion with 0-silk, tie, and excise this portion of the lung using scissors for tissue analysis as previously described (step 4.4).\nSecure the 3/8, ½ inch tubing adapter to the main pulmonary artery (mPA). Grasp opposite sides of the mPA using snaps. Insert the adapter with the ½ inch portion into the mPA and hold it in place while an assistant secures the adaptor in position using 0-silk ties.\n\tNOTE: The adaptor should sit 2-3 cm above the PA bifurcation (if the PA has inadequate length, a segment of the donor pig's descending Aorta can be sewn end-to-end onto the mPA for additional length).\nPlace the lungs supine on the silicone support membrane and connect them to the ESLP device.\nPlace a second tubing clamp on the trachea near the location of the tracheal bronchus. Remove the more distal clamp and intubate the trachea with the endotracheal tube (ETT).\n\t\nSecure the ETT in position using two zip-ties. Clamp the ventilation line using a tubing clamp and release the proximal clamp from the trachea.\n\t\tNOTE: The lungs stay inflated if this is done correctly and there are no air leaks.",
    "Connect the PA adapter to the PA line and de-air the mPA. Start the timer for perfusion.\n\t​NOTE: See Figure 5 for a photographic depiction of the steps.\n8. Initiation of perfusion and ventilation\nOn the Settings page, click Start heater and set the temperature to 38 °C. Enter the pig's weight as well to calculate cardiac output (flow).\nOn the Main page, set the CPAP to 20 cm H2O and click Start CPAP. When ventilation begins, unclamp the ventilation line.\nZero the arterial pressure sensor. Clamp the PA line above the pressure sensor with a tubing clamp. Open the sensor to room air, click ZERO PAP and Zero Bld Flow on the Settings page, then confirm the readings are zeroed on the Main page.\n\t\nClose the pressure sensor stopcock to read the line pressure, open the line to the PA cannula, select 10% cardiac output on the main page, click Return to PA Manual (button turns green), then unclamp the PA line.\n\t\tNOTE: The line is now appropriately zeroed, and the pump is now flowing 10% of the calculated cardiac output.\nDraw 10 mL of perfusate for centrifugal analysis and draw a time zero (T0) ABG.\nOnce the lungs have been perfused for 10 min, increase the flow to 20% of the cardiac output.\nWhen the perfusate temperature reaches 32 °C, secure the chamber lid in place with clamps to create an air-tight seal. Optimally position the lungs before placing the lid. Repair any air leaks with size 6-0 prolene on BV-1 needles.\nWith the lid secure, clamp the ventilation tubing and turn off CPAP. On the Settings page, click Zero ITP, Zero Paw, Zero Air Flow, then confirm readings are zeroed on the Main page.",
    "Click Start CPAP at 20 cm H2O and unclamp the ventilation tubing. Next, set EEP target to 0 cm H2O, EIP to 1 cm H20, RR 10, I:E ratio 1:1, and click Press to Start Vent to activate negative pressure ventilation.\nListen to the vent change its function, then attach the side port ventilation tubing to the chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: The ventilator begins its respiratory cycle in exhalation. The lungs will compress slightly if the side port is attached during an exhale. It is preferable to wait and listen for inhalation, then connect the side port to maximize recruitment.\nOver the next few breaths, decrease CPAP to 12 cm H2O while simultaneously increasing the EIP to -9 cm H2O. Maintain these ventilation parameters for the first hour, then reduce CPAP to 8-10 cm H2O depending on the alveolar recruitment and increase EIP to -12 to -13 cm H2O.\nSet peak pressures to 20-21 cm H2O.\n\tNOTE: If higher pressures were required at the time of pneumonectomy, then that becomes the target peak pressure.\nWhen the perfusate temperature reaches 35 °C, increase the flow to 30% of cardiac output.\n\tNOTE: These are the settings for organ preservation (Table 2).\nAt 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 h, evaluate with flows of 50% of cardiac output and the addition of mixed sweep gas (89% N2, 8% CO2, 3% O2) added to the deoxygenator at 0.125 L/min to simulate systemic oxygen utilization (Table 3).\nAt every odd hour during preservation mode, draw a 10 mL sample of perfusate for future analysis. Draw a pre-deoxygenator 1 ml ABG sample every hour.\nFollowing 5 min of evaluation mode, draw ABGs from pre-and-post-deoxygenator ports (Table 4).",
    "​NOTE: This completes the placement of lungs on ESLP and initiation of perfusion and ventilation. See Table 2 for initiation of the protocol. Table 3 details the two modes of NPV-ESLP employed.\n9. Metabolic Support of the Lung\nCheck the perfusate glucose level every hour via ABG analysis. Target glucose at 3-6 mmol/L and titrate according to consumption rates using a standard infusion pump for continuous glucose infusion and bolus doses as needed.\n\t​NOTE: Another infusion pump delivers a continuous infusion of 2 U/h of insulin. CHIP, along with most other organ perfusion solutions, contains glucose as the primary energy substrate.\n10. Heparin, anti-microbial, and anti-inflammatory agents\nAdd 10,000 units of heparin to the perfusate at the start of perfusion before the addition of pRBC.\nAdd 3.375 g of piperacillin-tazobactam to the perfusate at the start of perfusion before adding pRBC.\nAdd 500 mg of methylprednisolone to the perfusate at the start of perfusion before adding pRBC.\n11. Assessment of lung function\nEmploy the two distinct modes of ventilation and perfusion during an ESLP run: preservation and evaluation.\n\tNOTE: Please see Preservation and Evaluation (Table 3). Preservation Mode: Cardiac output 30%, PEEP 8-12, EEP 0, EIP -10 to -12, Peak Pressure 20-22 cm H2O, RR 6-10, and I:E ratio 1:1-1.5. ESLP runs are typically 12 h long, although they can be extended to 24 h.\nSet peak pressure to match pneumonectomy peak pressure and achieve a target TV of 10 mL/kg.\n\tNOTE: Although TVe of 10mL/kg is targeted, generally 6-8mL/kg is attained.\nEvery 30 min during preservation, perform recruitment for 30 min or less.\n\tNOTE: The duration and extent of recruitment are dependent on the TVe reached. If TVe are 8-10 mL/kg, further recruitment is not necessary.",
    "For recruitment, increase PEEP to 10-12 cm H2O, decrease RR to 6 breaths/min, increase Peak Pressures by 2-4 cm H20 without exceeding 30 cm H2O (rarely do we exceed 25 cm H2O), and change I:E ratio to 1:0.5.\n\tNOTE: Generally, only one or two of these changes are made for each 30 min interval, with the increase in PEEP and Peak Pressure being the most effective.\nAt 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 h, evaluate organ function.\n\tNOTE: The main parameter of interest is the PF ratio; however, dynamic compliance and PA pressures are closely monitored (Figure 6).\nDuring the evaluation, increase cardiac output to 50% while a mixed sweep gas (89% N2, 8% CO2, 3% O2) is added to the circuit at a flow rate of 0.125 L/min via the deoxygenator.\n\tNOTE: This replicates systemic oxygen depletion and occurs over 5 min. During this time, decrease PEEP to 5 cm H2O while maintaining peak pressures, increasing EIP accordingly. Keep RR at 10 bpm and set I:E to either 1 or 1.5 depending on whether the lungs appear to be air trapping or not.\nPerform the Functional calculations for Pulmonary Vascular Resistance, Minute Ventilation, Dynamic Compliance, and P/F ratio.\n\tNOTE: Pulmonary Vascular Resistance can be calculated by: [(PAP - LAP)/CO] x 80, where LAP (left atrial pressure) is 0 mmHg because of the design of an open LA drainage system.\n\tMinute Ventilation is calculated by: TVexpiratory x RR\n\tDynamic Compliance is calculated by: TVexpiratory/EIP\n\tP/F ratio is calculated by: PaO2/Fi02, where FiO2 is 21%.\n\tThe ESLP software automatically calculates and records ventilation and functional indices continuously.\n12. Metabolic assessment of the ex situ perfused lungs",
    "Assess the metabolic state of the perfusate every hour via ABGs, which act as a surrogate marker of the state of the lungs. Collect 10 mL of the perfusate from the pre-deoxygenator port for future analysis.\n\tNOTE: Blood gas analysis also serves to monitor the gas and ionic state of the perfusate.\nUse PaO2 as a marker of overall lung function.\n\tNOTE: This is particularly true during evaluation phases when mixed sweep gas is added to the circuit to simulate systemic deoxygenation. Pre vs. post deoxygenator gases are compared to assess oxygen step-up by the lungs.\nTarget a normal pH (7.35-7.45)-correct acidosis with boluses of tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (THAM) buffer (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Alkalosis is generally not corrected and does not exceed 7.55. CO2 sweep can be added to the circuit to correct this to normal or if alkalosis exceeds this threshold.\nTreat PaCO2 permissively and is generally in the range of 10- 20 mmHg.\n\tNOTE: These values are interpreted as a sign of satisfactory ventilation. Electrolytes are not adjusted during ESLP, but they are monitored as part of standard ABG analysis. Lactate will climb during increasing durations of ESLP, and so does potassium. Sodium remains stable (135-145 mmol/L), and calcium is typically low. Table 4 contains sample representative results of ABGs perfusate analysis during a 12 h run of NPV-ESLP at normothermia and 30% cardiac output using a cellular perfusate (blood + CHIP).\n13. Terminating perfusion, ventilation, and disconnection of the lungs from ESLP device\nOn the Setting page, click Shutdown Server.\nRemove the lid from the chamber. Disconnect the PA adapter from the PA cannula.\nExtubate the trachea. To determine the amount of edema formation, weigh the lungs.\nTake a 1 cm3 tissue biopsy of the accessory lobe and divide it into three pieces as previously described.",
    "Run the final gas analyses, centrifuge the perfusate samples, and store the tissue biopsies as previously described (step 4.4).\n\tNOTE: Centrifugation settings: Speed, 112 x g; acceleration, 9; deceleration, 9; temperature, 4 °C, and time, 15 min duration.\nClose the program; all the recorded data will be saved.\nFollowing institutional protocols, discard the remaining tissue, blood, and bioactive materials.\nClean the ESLP cart using a sanitizing hard surface cleaner (e.g., 70% ethanol) and place all reusable components in a -20 °C freezer to reduce the growth of bacteria.\nSubscription Required.
