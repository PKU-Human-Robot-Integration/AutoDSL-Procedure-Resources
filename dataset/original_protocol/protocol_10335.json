    "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) were harvested from the proximal femur bone marrow of osteoarthritic patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery, in full accordance with Bristol Southmead Hospital Research Ethics Committee guidelines (reference #078/01) and after patient consent was obtained.\n1. Magnetoferritin Synthesis and Purification\nGeneral remarks\nPerform magnetoferritin synthesis in a sealable, double-jacketed reaction vessel at 65 °C under nitrogen atmosphere to restrict oxidation of the metal precursors. Inject metal salt solutions and hydrogen peroxide through access ports in the lid into the reaction vessel using a syringe pump.\nAfter magnetoferritin synthesis, purify the protein by anion-exchange chromatography (see section 1.4) to remove nanoparticles not enclosed in the protein cavity, followed by size-exclusion chromatography (see section 1.5) to isolate protein monomers. Determine protein concentration using a Bradford assay (see section 1.6).\nPreparations prior to synthesis\nDeoxygenate 500 ml of deionized water by placing a tube connected to a nitrogen gas cylinder in the water, sealing the vessel with cling film and bubbling through nitrogen gas for approximately 60 min.\nHeat a water bath connected to the double jacketed reaction vessel to 65 °C. Add 75 ml of 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 8.6) into the reaction vessel, seal the vessel, and deoxygenate by bubbling nitrogen gas through the buffer solution for approximately 20 min. At the same time, stir the buffer solution using a magnetic stirrer.\nAfter deoxygenating the HEPES buffer solution, remove the tube supplying the nitrogen gas from the buffer and keep it suspended in the vessel to maintain a nitrogen atmosphere. Add apo-ferritin to achieve a final concentration of 3 mg/ml. Continue the magnetic stirring, but reduce the stirring speed if foaming occurs.\nPrepare a 25 mM stock solution of cobalt sulfate heptahydrate by dissolving 0.19 g in 50 ml of deoxygenated deionized water.",
    "Prepare a 25 mM solution of ammonium iron sulfate hexahydrate solution by dissolving 0.98 g in 100 ml of deoxygenated deionized water.\nRemove 2.5 ml of the ammonium iron sulfate hexahydrate solution and replace with 2.5 ml of the cobalt sulfate heptahydrate.\nPrepare an 8.33 mM solution of hydrogen peroxide in deoxygenated deionized water by first adding 965 μl of a hydrogen peroxide solution (30% w/w) to 9 ml of deoxygenated deionized water, and then adding 1 ml of this sub-stock to 99 ml of deoxygenated deionized water.\nMagnetoferritin synthesis\nInject 10.1 ml of both the iron-cobalt precursor and the hydrogen peroxide simultaneously into the apo-ferritin solution (magnetically stirred) at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min using two syringe pump (total volume injected: 20.2 ml).\nDuring the injection period, deoxygenate another 500 ml of deionized water.\n\t\tNOTE: The contents of the reaction vessel gradually adopt a dark brown color as the reaction proceeds.\nShortly before completion of the first injection, prepare another 100 ml of iron-cobalt precursor and hydrogen peroxide solution using the freshly deoxygenated deionized water.\nRepeat the injection step described in 1.3.1 using freshly prepared solutions of iron-cobalt and hydrogen peroxide.\nDuring the injection period, deoxygenate another 500 ml of deionized water, and proceed as described in 1.3.3 and 1.3.4.\nAfter the third injection, leave the solution to mature for 15 min under stirring.\nAdd 1.5 ml of a 1 M sodium citrate solution to the reaction vessel to chelate free metal ions in solution.\nRemove the solution from the reaction vessel into 50 ml centrifuge tubes, centrifuge for 30 min at 4,350 x g and pass the supernatant through a 0.22 µm syringe filter. At this stage, the filtered supernatant can be stored at 4 °C until purification.\nIon exchange chromatography",
    "Load the sample onto a column (2.5 cm diameter, 20 cm long) containing a cationic matrix using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 10 ml/min.\nWash the column with approximately 100 ml of running buffer (50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer, pH 8.0) using a gradient pump at a flow rate of 10 ml/min.\nTo elute the protein, wash the column at 10 ml/min with increasing concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) in Tris buffer: 150, 500 and 1,000 mM final NaCl concentration, 150 ml of each concentration.\nAs the protein elutes at a NaCl concentration of 500 mM, collect it in 50 ml fractions using an automated fraction collector.\n\t\tNOTE: For a detailed protocol of ion exchange chromatography consult previously published protocols.26\nSize exclusion chromatography\nConcentrate the 150 ml of magnetoferritin to a volume of approximately 2 ml using a 15 ml centrifugal filter unit followed by a 4 ml volume unit. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions of the centrifugal filter units (see material list) for a detailed protocol of this procedure.\nLoad the concentrated sample onto a gel filtration column using an injection loop.\nWash the column with running buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl) at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min.\nCollect 6 ml fractions using an automated fraction collector. Protein monomers elute last. At this point, purified magnetoferritin can be stored at 4 °C until cationization.\n\t\tNOTE: For a detailed protocol of size exclusion chromatography using a gel filtration column consult previously published protocols.27\nDetermining protein concentration\nPrepare ferritin standards of 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris buffer using commercially available horse spleen ferritin.\n\t\tNOTE: The protein concentration of commercially available ferritin is stated on the bottle. If not, contact the supplier for this information.",
    "Dilute magnetoferritin samples of unknown concentration in 50 mM Tris buffer until the color of the solution approximately matches the color of the 0.5 mg/ml standard. Make a note of the dilution factor.\nAdd 10 μl of each standard and magnetoferritin sample in triplicate into wells of a 96 well plate.\nAdd 200 μl of ready-made Bradford reagent to each well (refer to materials list for Bradford assay reagent details).\nIncubate at room temperature for 8 minutes.\nMeasure the absorbance at λ = 595 nm using a microplate reader.\nPlot the mean absorbance of the ferritin standards as a function of protein concentration and use the slope and intercept of the linear fit to calculate the concentration of the magnetoferritin sample.\n\t\tNOTE: Take into account the dilution factor that was used to adjust the magnetoferritin sample to the standard curve.\n2. Magnetoferritin Cationization\nGeneral remarks\n\tNOTE: For magnetoferritin cationization, N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine (DMPA) was coupled to aspartic and glutamic acid residues on the MF surface using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC).\n\t\nCarry out the reaction at room temperature under stirring. The protocol given below is for the cationization of 10 mg of magnetoferritin in a total volume of 5 ml (protein concentration 2 mg/ml). However, scale up or down by keeping the protein:DMPA:EDC ratios consistent, as well as the volumes of the buffer and magnetoferritin solution.\nPrior to the cationization reaction, dialyze the magnetoferritin samples into 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 50 mM NaCl. This is important to remove Tris elution buffer and avoid unwanted reactions between the Tris amine and the EDC-activated carboxylic acid residues. Determine the protein concentration after dialysis and adjust it to 4 mg/ml prior to cationization.\nCationization protocol\nWeigh out 374 mg of DMPA and dissolve in 2.5 ml of 200 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer.",
    "Adjust the solution pH to approximately 7 using concentrated (6 M) hydrochloric acid (HCl).\nCAUTION: Perform this step in a fume hood, as addition of the acid to DMPA releases toxic fumes!\nAdd 2.5 ml of magnetoferritin solution at 4 mg/ml (final concentration of MES is 100 mM, final concentration of magnetoferritin is 2 mg/ml, total amount of protein is 10 mg).\nAdd a magnetic stirrer and stir for 2 hr to equilibrate.\nCarefully adjust the solution to pH 5.0 using 1 M HCl.\nAdd 141 mg of EDC powder to the DMPA/magnetoferritin solution.\nContinue stirring for 3.5 hr.\nFilter the solution through a 0.22 µm syringe filter to remove any precipitates.\nAdd the solution to dialysis tubing with a 12-14 kDa molecular weight cut-off and dialyze against 4 L of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 50 mM NaCl for 2 days at 4 °C, replacing the dialysis buffer at least three times during that period.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, cationized magnetoferritin can be stored at 4 °C until further use.\n3. Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Labeling with Cationized Magnetoferritin\nGeneral remarks\nPerform all cell culture using class II laminar flow cabinets and humidified incubators at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere.\nCulture cells as monolayers using 175 cm2 flasks and 20 ml of culture medium, which was replenished every 3 - 4 days. Culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), containing 1,000 mg/L glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution, 1% (v/v) L-alanyl-L-glutamine solution and 5 ng/ml freshly supplemented human fibroblast growth factor.\nMagnetic labeling of hMSC with cationized magnetoferritin\nSeed 150,000 hMSCs into 25 cm2 flasks and leave to adhere overnight at 37 °C.\nFilter sterilize cationized magnetoferritin through a 0.22 µm syringe filter and determine the protein concentration.",
    "Keeping sterile conditions, prepare a 0.5 μM solution of cationized magnetoferritin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Keep capped in a sterile culture hood until use.\nWash the plated cells with 2 ml of room temperature PBS.\nAdd 1 ml of the sterilized cationized magnetoferritin solution to the plated cells and incubate for the desired time period (1 min to 1 hr).\nWash cells with PBS, and then harvest cells by adding 0.5 ml of trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and incubating at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 1 ml of culture medium to inactivate the trypsin/EDTA, transfer the solution to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 524 x g.\nDiscard the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 0.5 ml magnetic separation buffer, consisting of 0.5% (w/v) fetal bovine serum and 2 mM EDTA in PBS.\nMagnetic cell separation\nAttach the magnet to the multi stand, and add a magnetic separation column to the magnet. Place a pre-separation filter on the column.\nPlace 0.5 ml of magnetic separation buffer in the pre-separation filter and let it run through both the filter and the column to wash and wet them.\nPlace a 15 ml centrifuge tube under the column.\nAdd 0.5 ml of the cell suspension in the filter reservoir of the magnetic separation column.\nWhen the reservoir is empty, add 0.5 ml of magnetic separation buffer.\nWhen the reservoir is empty, add further 0.5 ml of magnetic separation buffer.\nRepeat one more time (the total volume of magnetic separation buffer used for washing should be 1.5 ml). This wash step elutes all non-magnetized cells from the column (non-magnetized cell fraction).\nRemove the column from the magnet and place it in a fresh 15 ml centrifuge tube. Remove filter from the column reservoir.",
    "Add 1 ml of magnetic separation buffer to the reservoir and immediately push through the column using the plunger supplied by the manufacturer. This elutes the magnetized cells from the column into the centrifuge tube (magnetized cell fraction).\nCentrifuge both tubes for 5 min at 524 x g.\nDiscard the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellets in 0.3 ml PBS.\nCount the number of cells numbers in each fraction using a hemocytometer.\nDetermine the fraction of magnetized cells, M(%), using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54785/54785eq1.jpg \n\t\twhere n(M) is the number of cells in the magnetized fraction and n(M+NM) is the sum of the number of cells in the magnetized and non-magnetized fractions.\nPreparing hMSCs labeled with cationized magnetoferritin for iron quantification using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)\n\tNOTE: The protocol may need to be adapted for other ICP-OES instruments. It is advisable to consult with the responsible technician.\n\t\nCentrifuge a known number of cells for 5 min at 524 x g.\nRemove the PBS supernatant and add 0.25 ml of 50% (v/v) nitric acid.\nVortex mix the acidified cell suspension.\nIncubate at room temperature overnight.\nAdd 4.75 ml of distilled water to each sample and vortex mix.\nAnalyze with ICP-OES.28\nNormalize the measured iron content to the number of cells to determine a value for cellular iron content."
