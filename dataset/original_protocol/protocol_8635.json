  "procedures": [
    "This work was determined not to be human subject research upon initial review from Colorado State University's Institutional Review Board (IRB), as all human samples were obtained as de-identified samples from the Bioreclamation IVT biorepository and were collected under IRB approved protocols.\n1. Preparation of Crude Sample (either Plasma or Serum) by Pelleting Larger Vesicles and Cellular Debris\nNote: Safety consideration: plasma, serum, and other biological fluids are biohazardous materials and must be handled with special care, while wearing basic personal protective equipment, including gloves and lab coat. It is highly recommended that biological samples are processed in a biosafety cabinet; if not available, the use of eye-protection is recommended.\nEquilibrate a serum or a plasma sample by placing the tube under non-shaking conditions in a 4 °C refrigerator overnight (from either -20 or -80 °C storage).\nAliquot 250 µL of the sample into a microcentrifuge tube using a 1,000 µL pipette.\nCentrifuge the sample at 18,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nUsing a 200 µL pipette, remove 200 µL of the cleared supernatant and add it to a new microcentrifuge tube. Avoid any pelleted material while transferring the supernatant. Discard the pelleted material.\nQuantify the protein content of the sample by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, using the manufacturer's protocol. To perform the assay, dilute the sample 1:50 in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Test each sample in duplicate.\nNote: Use 1x PBS throughout the protocol unless stated otherwise. On average, 200 µL of clarified serum or plasma (after 18,000 x g) will yield 15 mg of total protein. Other sample types, with lower or higher protein content, may require additional BCA dilutions.",
    "Aliquot 10 mg of the sample into a new microcentrifuge tube. Use the concentration obtained in step 1.5 to calculate the corresponding volume of sample. Aliquot the sample using a 200 µL pipette.\nNote: It is recommended to store the remaining sample at -80 °C. Aliquot the sample in different tubes at 10 mg per tube to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles in future use.\n2. Digestion of Non-exosomal Blood Proteins\nNote: The digestion step is designed to reduce the non-exosomal proteins which can co-purify with exosomes. If preservation of exosome surface proteins is required for downstream analyses, it should be taken into consideration that this step has the potential to interfere with this analysis. The detection of the exosomal CD63, a surface-exposed tetraspanin protein, was not significantly negatively impacted by this process.\nPrepare proteinase K solution at a concentration of 500 µg/mL in PBS. Add the corresponding amount of proteinase K in a conical tube. Then add the buffer and vortex for 30 s, 3x at room temperature.\nAdd 50 µL of proteinase K solution to the 10-mg sample aliquot and mix gently by pipetting up and down using a 200 µL pipette.\nIncubate the sample at 37 °C in a water bath for 30 min. Place the tube in a float tube rack and avoid complete immersion of tube in the water bath to avoid potential leakage.\nTransfer the sample and floating tube rack to a 60 °C water bath for 10 min, to inactivate the proteinase K.\n3. Removal of Small Proteins and Peptides by Centrifuge Ultrafiltration",
    "Rinse an ultrafiltration device containing 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) filter with PBS prior to use. Do this by adding 500 µL of PBS to the filter, using a 1,000 µL pipette. Spin the device at 3,700 x g for 5 min. Discard any remaining retentate as well as the eluate.\nNote: The sample volume capacity of the ultrafiltration device must be 0.5 mL - 4 mL to ensure that the final reduced sample volume of 50 µL is achievable.\nTake the sample from step 2.4 and increase the volume to 500 µL by adding PBS. Pipette the sample into the pre-rinsed ultrafiltration device.\nNote: On average, the sample volume from step 2.4 is 185 µL (120 to 150 µL of sample and 50 µL of proteinase K solution).\nPlace the ultrafiltration device in a fixed-angle benchtop centrifuge at 3,700 x g at 4 °C until the sample has reduce to a volume of 50 µL.\nCAUTION: When using ultrafiltration devices with dead stop volume, care must be taken to avoid complete dryness of the filter membrane during centrifugation steps.\nAdd 500 µL of PBS directly into the filter membrane and pipette up and down 5 times. Centrifuge as in step 3.3. Perform this wash step a total of 3 times.\nTransfer the final 50 µL retentate in a new microcentrifuge tube.\nRinse the filter membrane with 200 µL PBS, pipetting up and down 10 times, and transfer the wash to the tube from step 3.5.\nPlace the filter holder in the inverse position in a new tube. Run a reverse spin recovery for 5 min at 2,000 x g to retrieve remaining sample from the membrane. Pool the sample with the sample from step 3.5.\n4. Purification of Vesicles by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)",
    "Add 850 µL of SEC slurry, with beads having a MWCO of 700 kDa, into an empty, capped gravity flow column using a 1,000 µL pipette. Place the columns in a size appropriate rack fitted with a drip tray.\nUncap the bottom of the column and let the liquid drain for 5 min. Once drained, add 10 mL of PBS to wash the resin. Allow 20 min for the wash to drain from the column.\nPlace the concentrated, proteinase K treated sample from step 3.5 into a 15-mL conical tube, and increase the sample volume to 5 mL adding PBS with a serological pipette. Mix the tube gently by rocking for 1 min and then slowly apply the sample to the column prepared in step 4.2 with a serological pipette.\nNote: Once the cap of the column is removed, the sample will flow through the resin by gravity; the 5-mL sample will completely flow through the column in 10 min.\nCollect the flow through in a new 15 mL conical tube.\nUsing a serological pipette, apply the collected material to the resin again to remove any remaining material below 700 kDa.\nCollect the flow through in a new 15 mL conical tube. Wash the resin twice adding 1 mL of PBS. Collect the flow through in the tube from step 4.5; the total final volume will be roughly 7 mL.\nNote: After step 4.6, the sample will be diluted about 35 times from the original sample volume; the following steps will reduce the volume and concentrate the purified exosome sample.\n5. Concentration of Purified Exosomes and Total Protein Quantification\nRinse an ultrafiltration device with a 3 kDa MWCO filter with PBS prior to use, as described in step 3.1.",
    "Add the sample from step 4.6 to the ultrafiltration device and centrifuge in a swinging-bucket rotor at 3,700 x g at 4 °C. Buffer will pass through the filter and can be discarded. Concentrated exosomes will be retained above the filter. Centrifuge the sample until the volume above the filter (retentate) is reduced to 200 µL.\nTransfer the retentate to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nRinse the filter membrane with 200 µL PBS by pipetting over the membrane 10 times and transfer the wash to the tube from step 5.3. This will allow for the collection of any residual exosome sample.\nBring sample volume up to 500 µL by adding PBS. Mix by slowly pipetting up and down 10 times.\nNote: The protocol can be paused here. Samples should be stored at 4 °C overnight or at -20/-80 °C for long term storage.\nQuantify the protein content of the sample by BCA assay, using the manufacturer's protocol. Dilute the sample 1:10 and 1:50 in PBS. Run each sample in duplicate.\nNote: Starting with 10 mg of total protein of serum or plasma, the total protein yield in purified exosomes from step 5.6 is, on average, 150 µg. Additional dilutions may be necessary if samples other than serum or plasma are used; yield may vary with sample type.\n6. Quantification and Sizing of Exosomes by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)\nAdd 5 µg of purified exosomes (as quantified in 5.6) to 1 mL of PBS and vortex for 15 s on low-medium speed.\n\t\nPlace the sample in a 1 mL disposable syringe. If available, set the syringe in an automatic syringe pump set to inject the diluted exosome sample at a rate of 30 µL/min.",
    "Perform NTA measurements using video capture settings: screen gain of 3 - 4 and camera level of 12 - 13.\nDefine the script for analysis to run three technical replicates for a minimum of 30 s using a constant flow for every replicate. For the analysis, set the capture threshold at 5.\nNote: Details regarding the use of the automatic syringe, and settings for video capture are available in the reference13. Capture and analysis settings for NTA must be consistent across different samples to assure comparability.\n7. Determination of Soluble Protein Reduction\nAdd 1 - 10 µg of purified exosomes to SDS sample buffer and perform polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using a 4 - 12% Bis-Tris Gel in 1x MES SDS running buffer for 35 min at 200 V. Transfer resolved proteins to a nitrocellulose 0.2 µm membrane by applying a voltage of 50 V for 1 - 1.5 h. Perform western blot analysis to evaluate the presence of albumin, apolipoproteins A and B, and the exosome marker CD 63 following standard methodologies.\nNote: Full protocols for the methods in 7.1 can be found in reference14; specifically, SP007: Running of polyacrylamide gels and SP011: Western blot protocol.\nSeparate 10 µg of purified exosomes using PAGE as in step 7.1 and stain the protein bands using coomassie dye, following standard recommendations, to visualize protein variation and reduction between samples.\nNote: Further details regarding the protocol for western blots specific to CD63 are described by Diaz et al.15\nSubscription Required.
