    "All experiments were performed with approval from the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Anesthesia and pre-operative procedures\nSterilize all surgical instruments and materials by autoclaving. Turn on the thermal support device to be certain it is warm (40–42 °C).\nPlace a 9–11-week old C57BL/6 mouse into an acrylic induction chamber and anesthetize it with vaporized 2.5% isoflurane and 0.8 L/min oxygen. Anesthesia induction takes about 3 min.\nRemove the mouse from the chamber. Confirm a deep plane of anesthesia by a toe pinch, an ear pinch and a tail pinch. Place the mouse in supine position on the surgical area and deliver 2.5% isoflurane using silicone mask. Provide buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg analgesic and apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nRemove fur from the ventral side of the neck to the lower abdomen using Nair, a hair remover.\nCleanse and disinfect the surgical site by using a two-step scrub with 10% povidone-iodine and 70% isopropanol. Apply a surgical drape.\n2. Operative procedures\nExposure of the clamp and puncture sites\nPrepare sterile instruments and wear sterile gloves to maintain sterility throughout the surgery.\nMake a skin-deep midline abdominal incision with a scalpel from the level of the lower liver edge to just above the pubis. Cut through the musculature with scissors to open the abdominal cavity.\nInsert a retractor into the abdomen and pull out the bowels to the right side. Keep them moist by wrapping in a saline-soaked gauze. Retreive the bladder and the seminal vesicles (in male mice) and pull them out to the caudal side. Dissect the mesentery between the rectum and retroperitoneum with a micro-needle holder to obtain a full view of the aorta and IVC.",
    "Dissect the infra-renal aorta and IVC en bloc from the lateral and dorsal surrounding retroperitoneal tissues with a micro-needle holder to cross-clamp them together.\nDissect the surrounding tissues to expose the aortic puncture site at approximately three-quarters of the distance from the left renal vein to the aortic bifurcation.\nIVC dissection\nDissect between the infra-renal IVC and aorta immediately distal to the left renal vein. Extend the dissection distally to the halfway between the left renal vein and the aortic bifurcation, so that the infra-renal IVC, both upstream and downstream to the stenosis, can be observed postoperatively.\n\t\tNOTE: Blunt dissection between the IVC and aorta should be performed from immediately distal to the left renal vein where the connective tissue between the IVC and the aorta is relatively loose.\nMake a window to separate the IVC from the aorta at that level and dissect the IVC from the surrounding tissue. Place an 8-0 polyamide monofilament suture firstly beneath the IVC and aorta (Figure 1A), then position the suture beneath only the IVC (Figure 1B) by pulling the suture end through the window.\n\t\tNOTE: Since the IVC is fragile, dissecting along the aortic adventitia is useful to make a window to prevent the IVC as well as small IVC or aortic branches from being damaged. If bleeding occurs, it is likely to be uncontrollable. If the IVC has distinct side branches, place an 8-0 suture distally to the branches.\nAVF creation\nBend a 25 G needle to a 45–60° angle at a point ~4 mm from the needle tip.\nClamp the infra-renal aorta and IVC by applying a microsurgical clip.\nRotate the aorta medially and caudally by grasping the connective tissue surrounding the bifurcation to expose the puncture site of the aorta stretched it slightly to the ventral side.",
    "Holding the aorta in a suitable position, puncture through the aorta into the IVC using the prepared 25 G needle (Figure 1C).\nRelease the aorta and cover the puncture site with the surrounding tissue pulling up from the left side of the aorta. Take out the needle and press the puncture site gently using a cotton-tipped swab for hemostasis.\nCreation of the IVC stenosis \nPlace a tip of a 22 G IV catheter (see the Table of Materials) onto the IVC longitudinally. Ligate the IV catheter and IVC together with an 8-0 suture (Figure 1D), and then remove the IV catheter.\nConfirm primary hemostasis (Figure 1E) and then unclamp the aorta and IVC. Cover the puncture site 1 min more to ensure hemostasis.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not clamp for too long so as to avoid IVC thrombosis distal to the stenosis.\nReturn organs to their original positions and close the abdomen with 6-0 sutures.\n3. Post-operative procedures\nAfter closure of the abdominal wound, discontinue isoflurane inhalation. Put the mouse into an individual bedding-free cage and place the cage on a thermal support device to prevent hypothermia.\n\tNOTE: The mouse is observed until they achieve and maintain sternal recumbency. Apply post-operative care including analgesia and wound care in accordance with recommendations of the local IACUC. For analgesia we use buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg intrasmuscularly every 12 h for 48 h following the surgical procedures and thereafter as needed.\nConfirm the AVF patency postoperatively by using Doppler ultrasound (see the Table of Materials). In addition, measure other vessel and flow characteristics as required.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
