    "1. Preparation and characterization of si-NPs\nsi-NP preparation\n\t\nDissolve polymer in 10 mM citric acid buffer (pH 4.0) at 3.33 mg/mL. Polymer can first be dissolved at 10x concentration in ethanol to ensure dissolution.\n\t\tNOTE: Polymer can be dissolved at lower concentrations, but use at concentrations above 3.33 mg/mL can prevent homogenous NP formation.\nAdd siRNA (50 μM in diH2O) to result in N+:P- ratio of 10. Mix polymer and siRNA solutions thoroughly by pipetting and let incubate for 30 min. The N+:P- ratio represents the number of positively-charged amine groups on the polymer to the number of negatively-charged phosphate groups on the siRNA and is calculated by the formula below:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59549/59549eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere, mol Pol is the molar amount of polymer, RU amine is the number of repeating units of positively-charged amines per polymer, mol siRNA is the molar amount of siRNA, and bp siRNA is the number of base pairs per siRNA molecule.\nAdd a 5-fold excess of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and mix gently either by pipetting or inverting the tube. To confirm that the final pH is neutral (~7.2-7.5), pipette 10 μL of si-NP solution onto pH test strips.\n\t\tNOTE: Citric acid and phosphate buffers are prepared according to the Millipore Sigma Buffer Reference Center Charts.\nPhysicochemical characterization of si-NPs\nRecord the size and surface charge of resulting si-NPs using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Prepare a DLS sample by filtering 1 mL of si-NPs (0.1 – 1.0 mg/mL) through 0.45 μm pore-size syringe filters into a square quartz or polystyrene cuvette. Record size and surface charge measurements using a DLS instrument according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\n\t\nConfirm the size and morphology of si-NPs by imaging analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).",
    "Add 5 μL of si-NP solution at 1 mg/mL to TEM grids and incubate for 60 s. Blot dry for 3 s.\nAdd 5 μL of 3% uranyl acetate solution and incubate for 20 s. Blot dry for 3 s. Dry grids overnight under desiccation.\nImage grids according to the protocol established for the specific microscope to be used.\nCharacterize the loading of siRNA in si-NPs at various N+:P- ratios using agarose gel retardation.\n\t\t\nTo produce 2% agarose gel, add 2 g of electrophoresis grade agarose powder to 100 mL of 1x TAE (Tris-acetate-EDTA) buffer at pH 8.0. Stir to suspend agarose. Heat uncovered in microwave until all agarose is dissolved (1-3 min).\nOnce cooled, add 5 μL of ethidium bromide (10 mg/mL in H2O), and mix well. Pour agarose into a gel tray and place comb to produce wells, letting dry for 30 min. Carefully remove comb to leave behind loading wells, and fill the gel tray to the max fill line with 1x TAE buffer.\nGenerate si-NPs (according to the procedure above) at 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 40 N+:P- ratios. Place 2 μL aliquots of loading dye (no SDS and reducing agents) on paraffin film for each si-NP formulation. Mix 10 μL of si-NP solution with loading dye on paraffin film by pipette.\nAdd si-NP/loading dye solutions to agarose gel wells. Run voltage source at 100 V for 35 min (or until samples have traversed 80% of gel length).\nVisualize siRNA bands on a UV transilluminator according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\n2. Determining in vitro bioactivity of si-NPs\nKnockdown of the model gene luciferase",
    "Generate luciferase si-NPs (according to the procedure above) using luciferase siRNA and scrambled si-NPs using a scrambled siRNA sequence as a control. Formualte both si-NPs at the same final N+:P- ratio and at the optimum ratio identified by agarose gel retardation studies. Example siRNA sequences are included in the Table of Materials.\nSeed luciferase-expressing cells [MDA-MB-231/Luciferase (Bsd) stable cells] in 96-well black-walled plates at a density of 2,000 cells per well. Allow to adhere overnight in full media (DMEM, 10% FBS) in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity).\nDilute si-NPs into full serum media for a final volume of 100 μL per well and siRNA concentration of 100 nM. Treat cells for 24 h with si-NPs.\nAfter 24 h, remove treatments and replace media with full serum media containing 150 μg/mL D-luciferin. Incubate cells for 5 min before measuring luminescence on a plate reader or in vivo optical imaging system according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\nReplace luciferin-containing media with fresh, full serum media, and incubate 24 h more. Repeat the step above, removing media and replacing with full serum media containing 150 μg/mL D-luciferin, followed by a 5 min incubation prior to measuring luminescence at the 48 h timepoint.\nFor longitudinal studies, maintain cells under sterile conditions while measuring luminescence. Continue to culture in fresh, full media between measurements after replacing luciferin-containing.",
    "NOTE: The appropriate siRNA concentration will vary with different si-NPs and siRNA molecules. When using neutrally-charged polyplexes with an endosomolytic core (e.g., PEG-DB), 100 nM is typically well-tolerated by the cells and produces >75% luciferase knockdown. The mass ratio of PEG-DB to siRNA at 10 N+:P- ratio and 100 nM siRNA treatments (assuming 26 bp siRNA) is 23.3, i.e., add 23.3 ng of PEG-DB for every 1.0 ng of siRNA. For example, add 1.16 μL of 3.33 mg/mL polymer for 166.5 ng of siRNA to treat one well at 100 nM in a 96-well plate (100 mL media volume per well).\nSubscription Required.
