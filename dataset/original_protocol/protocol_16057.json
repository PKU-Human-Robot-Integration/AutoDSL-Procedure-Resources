    "The first procedure is to euthanize the mouse so that the spinal cord can be extruded and the lumbar region located.\nCAUTION: There is a risk of animal bites and trained and/or licensed personnel must carry out this procedure. Pentobarbital is used for euthanasia rather than cervical dislocation to prevent any physical damage to the brain which is commonly dissected at the same time as the spinal cord. Pentobarbital is an injectable fast acting central nervous system agent which causes loss of consciousness and cardiovascular depression. It must be used in compliance with associated laws and the establishment must have a controlled drug license. There is also a risk from the use of associated sharp needles or related equipment.\nMaterials\nC57BL6NTAC mice: 8 weeks old; ALS line Fustm3.1(FUS)Emcf (MGI:6193752) (European Mouse Mutant Archive, EM: 13073), referred to here as hFUS, was used to generate motor neuron count data\nDiluted pentobarbital solution (Merial Animal Health, cat. no. 0C2287B; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-rec-0001])\n70% ethanol solution, containing industrial denatured alcohol (IDA; Pioneer Research Chemicals, cat. no.

    "2. Check for the absence of pedal, tail, and orbital reflex using a pair of forceps, then perform the secondary confirmation of death via decapitation by cutting off the head with a pair of scissors.\n3. Once the head is removed, position the mouse so that the dorsal surface is uppermost and dampen the coat with 70% alcohol. Make an (dorsal) incision through the skin and expose the spinal column (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0001]).\n4. Using scissors trim off all skin, arms, legs, ribcage, and contents of thoracic and abdominal cavity in order to isolate the spinal column (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0001]). Trim spinal column tight to the vertebrae on either side down past the pelvic girdle.\nThis shortens the length of the spinal nerves which would otherwise impair the flush process.\n5. Once isolated, trim the ends of the spinal column at the pelvic girdle (distal end) and at the mid-point of the thoracic region (proximal end), ideally through the S-shaped area.\n6. Ensure the ends are trimmed straight and the spinal cord is visible at both ends (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0001]).",
    "The second procedure is to extrude the spinal cord from within the spinal column.\nCAUTION: Ensure that the operator is wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) that protects eyes from liquids.\nMaterials\nMouse spinal cord (see Basic Portocol 1)\nCold sterile PBS (Life Technologies, cat. no. 10010056)\n200-µl non-filter pipet tip (Sarstedt, cat. no. 70.760.502)\n5-ml syringe (BD Discardit II; VWR International, cat. no. 309050)\nSmall petri dish (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 351)\nForceps (Interfocus, cat. no. 11295-00)\n1. Trim the large end of a non-filter pipet tip (suitable for 2- to 200-μl pipet) until it fits firmly onto a 5-ml syringe.\n2. Pipet cold sterile PBS and leave on ice until needed.\n3. Gently grip spinal column with fingers and firmly place pipet tip at the base of the distal end of column, gently pinching at the pipet tip and spinal column to help form a tight seal (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0001] and F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0001]).\n4. Extrude spinal cord into the petri dish using a short, sharp pulse from the PBS filled syringe, rather than a slower expulsion (Fig. 1G[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0001]).",
    "The third procedure is to identify the lumbar region of the spinal cord.\nCAUTION: Blades must be handled with care.\nMaterials\nMouse spinal cord (see Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-prot-0002])\nSmall petri dish (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 351)\nDissection board (SLS, cat. no. M618)\n1-cm dissection guide (with the center marked; homemade from cardboard) or ruler or calipers\nRazor blades (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 11904325)\nForceps (Interfocus, cat. no. 11295-00)\n1. Gently remove spinal cord from the petri dish with forceps and lay flat on the dissection board.\n2. Ensure spinal cord is straight and locate the widest section of the lumbar spinal cord.\nThis is the lumbar bulge (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dccdeb02-a2af-4efb-94ed-ae1422e8e91f/cpz1428-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nHydraulically extruded adult mouse spinal cord (Richner et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-bib-0009]). Lumbar enlargement shown by red box.\n3. Place the center of a 1-cm guide (with the center marked) at the center of the widest lumbar section of the spinal cord.\n4. Cut spinal cord straight at both the proximal and distal ends according to the 1-cm guide (Fig. 1H[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0001]).\nIf done correctly this should give the region of L1 to L6.",
    "The fourth procedure is to transfer and orient the 1-cm piece of lumbar spinal cord into a support medium so it can be quickly frozen with the least amount of damage to the cord. It is essential the cord is dried before placing in the OCT matrix.\nCAUTION: Contact with solid carbon dioxide can cause cold burns or frostbite. Solid carbon dioxide can also cause asphyxiation in high concentrations. Use in a well-ventilated area and wear appropriate gloves and safety glasses.\nMaterials\nMouse spinal cord (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-prot-0003])\nIsopentane (VWR, cat. no. 24872.323)\nDry ice (solid carbon dioxide; BOC, cat. no. 576CB)\nOCT embedding medium (Pioneer Research Chemicals, cat. no.

Pour 100 ml isopentane into a Pyrex crystallizing dish and place dish into an insulating ice box containing dry ice. Allow the isopentane to cool. To quicken the cooling process, a few pieces of dry ice can be added into the isopentane.\n2. Fill a mold to the top with OCT embedding medium and let stand for a couple of minutes to allow any air bubbles to dissipate.\n3. Gently blot the 1-cm section of spinal cord with fiber-free filter paper to remove excess moisture.\n4. Using forceps, orientate spinal cord vertically (L1 end down) and place in the OCT filled mold. Ensure the tissue that requires cutting first goes towards the bottom of the mold, as this is the cutting surface. The largest surface of the block will be connected to the chuck.",
    "5. Completely surround spinal cord with OCT to eliminate the possibility of freezer burn.\n6. Place mold into the isopentane and leave to freeze.\nAs it freezes the mold will become opaque and have a matte appearance. This can take up to 10 min.\n7. Embed the cord vertically; it must not be at an angle or it will not be possible to get proper cross sections required for identification of the anatomic level and motor neuron counts.\n8. The sample is now at -80°C. It will need to be placed in the cryostat for 10-15 min so it reaches -16°C.",
    "The fifth procedure describes how the block is cut on a cryostat and the sections collected so that the motor neurons are not counted twice.\nCAUTION: The cryostat uses extremely sharp blades and must be handled with caution. Prolonged usage of the cryostat may cause repetitive strain and/or carpel tunnel injuries.\nMaterials\nMouse spinal cord sample embedded in OCT (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-prot-0004])\nGlass charged Superfrost slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10149870)\nSlide printer or Brady labels (Science Warehouse, cat. no. m-97-488)\nS35 feather blades (VWR 720-1998)\nCryostat (Thermo Shandon NX70 cryostar)\nPlastic box\nSilicon bag (A5)\nElectrical tape (Branner, cat. no. 2652808)\n1. Section the sample at 20-40 µm thickness; 3 mm of the anterior spinal cord needs to be discarded to reach the L3 region of the lumbar spinal cord, if cutting from anterior to posterior.\nThis procedure generates 75 sections if trimmed at 40 μm or 150 sections if trimmed at 20 μm.\n2. When at L3, start to collect sections onto slides. Use charged Superfrost slides which feel granular to the touch; the sections go on this side.\n3. Label three slides with 1A, 1B, and 1C (slide A to C in set 1). To cover the lumbar area, four sets are required, i.e., 240 sections in total (4,800 μm).\n4. Collect the first section onto 1A, the second onto 1B, and the third onto 1C and then repeat until there are twenty sections per slide.\nThere should be four sets of slides in total. Within a set, slides B and C are functionally redundant and act as spare or back up slides for counts or other experiments.\nWhen you have twenty sections on each of the slides in the set, start again with 2A, 2B, 2C (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c0e07a23-b412-4e1b-9c09-7fea779b5d56/cpz1428-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Layout of spinal cord sections on slide sets. Serial transverse sections are cut 20 μm thick to ensure the same motor neuron is not counted twice. Sections are arranged as shown in the figure, with 20 sections per slide, alternating between slide A, B, and C within the set. When those slides are full, the same is repeated in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th set until the lumbar regions have been dissected.\n5. The remainder of the block can be put into the -80oC freezer in case any further sections are required.\n6. Air dry slides at room temperature for at least 1 hr. Once dry, store in a plastic box sealed with electrical tape and place inside a silicon bag. Store the labeled box in a -20oC freezer in case any further experiments are required at a later date.\n7. The first slide of each set, i.e., 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A, should be stained with gallocyanin (see Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-prot-0006]) and the motor neurons counted.\nA motor neuron is ∼20-25 µm thick. The spinal cord is sectioned at 20 µm, meaning there is a distance of 60 µm between each section counted on a slide (i.e., section 1, 4, 7, and so on) ensuring the same motor neuron is not counted twice.",
    "The sixth procedure explains how to prepare and carry out the gallocyanin staining; this is an ideal staining method for numerous slides that need to be stained serially, equivalently, and reproducibly (Shah, 1991[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-bib-0010]). The main advantages over most other Nissl stains (such as toluidine blue, cresyl violet, and neutral red) are that there is no overstaining and the color resists most subsequently applied chemicals such as alcohol-water mixtures and acidic solutions of anionic dyes. It stains the Nissl bodies pale blue (Kellett, 1963[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-bib-0006]).\nCAUTION: When applying the stain, you should wear adequate personal protection and work in a well-ventilated space.\nMaterials\nSlide sets with mouse spinal cord samples (see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-prot-0005])\nGallocyanin solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-rec-0004])\nEthanol (EtOH; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10437341)\n70% ethanol solution, containing industrial denatured alcohol (IDA; Pioneer Research Chemicals, cat. no.

Alternately, perform staining manually in a fume hood using 50-ml Coplin jars or 250-ml staining jars, depending on how many slides there are to stain.\nThe example here uses frozen sections so they do not need dewaxing per se but these steps are used to fix the sections and provide a clearer final image.",
    "Process slides through three changes of xylene. The first change is for 15 min, the second for 4 min, and the final change for 2 min. After the xylene treatment, slides are placed into three changes of 100% IDA as follows: 2 min, then 1 min, and finally 30 s. Finally, a 70% IDA wash is used for 30 s. Place slides into distilled water to wash off alcohol.\nThe sections can then be stored at room temperature in distilled water for an unlimited timeframe. Each step described here utilizes 300 ml of reagent or chemical per change.\n2. Filter gallocyanin solution into a Coplin jar or staining jar. Place slides in the gallocyanin solution and ensure sections are completely covered with the solution and leave in the solution for 30 min at room temperature.\n3. Rinse sections by transferring the slides into a Coplin jar containing distilled water.\n4. To dehydrate the sections, transfer slides through a series of jars containing different percentages of ethanol (made up with distilled water): 70% EtOH, 90% EtOH, 100% EtOH. Treat for 2 min with each solution.\n5. To clear the sections, transfer slides into xylene: three changes, 3 min for each change; this step removes the alcohol and the slides should not be cloudy. Carry out this step in the fume hood.\n6. To mount the sections, use a Pasteur pipet to add a thin line of D.P.X. to a coverslip and gently lower slide with the sections facing down onto the coverslip. Turn slide over and allow the weight of coverslip to press the D.P.X. to the edges of the coverslip.\n7. Take care to avoid creating bubbles as these get worse as the medium dries. Gently tease out any air bubbles using a mountant needle.",
    "8. Place slides in a cardboard holder and leave to dry overnight at room temperature.",
    "In the context of motor neuron counting in ALS research, the motor neurons of the sciatic motor pool are the neurons of interest in mouse models of ALS. Sciatic motor neurons innervate fast fatigable muscles of the mouse's hind limbs, which are predominantly affected in disease (Frey et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-bib-0004]) and thus a reduction in motor neurons of the sciatic pool can be a readout of disease progression in mouse models.\nIdentifying the region of the lumbar spinal cord\nIn the spinal cord, motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of the gray matter. With the dorsal spinal cord located upwards, the gray matter (butterfly-like structure in the center of the spinal cord, will be stained a darker purple/blue than surrounding white matter) extends towards the dorsal edges of the spinal cord. At the ventral side, the gray matter does not extend as far towards the white matter. There is a U/V shape in the gray matter at the dorsal side, and an inverted U in the gray matter, below the central cord, on the ventral side (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/08058283-7630-46ea-98d7-54c7ddc8767b/cpz1428-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nHow to locate and differentiate motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord sections. (A) This is a representative image of the lumbar spinal cord with the dorsal and ventral side highlighted. The red dotted line indicates the 45° line used to separate the sciatic motor pool from other ventral motor neurons which are not counted. (B) A representative image of a motor neuron stained using gallocyanin. The cytoplasm stains a darker purple than the nucleus. The nucleolus can be seen as a dark dot in the nucleus (arrow head). The motor neuron is larger in size than surrounding interneurons and dendrites can be seen extending from the motor neuron.",
    "Motor neurons of the sciatic motor pool are large, pyramidal neurons which coordinate conscious movement of hind limb skeletal muscles. The sciatic motor pool is clustered laterally in the ventral horn and so a line is drawn at 45° on the ventral gray matter so the more medial motor neurons are not mistakenly included in the count (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0004]). Motor neurons in the region above the 45° line are counted.\nIdentifiable features of a motor neuron include:\n         \nLarge size and darkest staining.\nThe cytoplasm stains more darkly than the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the nucleolus can be seen as a dark dot (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0004], arrow head).\nUsually, three or more dendrites extend from the motor neuron.\nIn order to correctly count the sciatic motor neurons, most abundantly found in regions L4-L6, you must first identify the region of the lumbar spinal cord you are looking at. L1-L6 regions have subtle differences in appearance (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0005]).\n         \nL1 (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0005]): Cord is oval in shape. Central cord is rounded. Wide U/V in dorsal gray matter. Dorsal gray matter has bulges (red circle). Motor neurons are spread throughout ventral horn.\nL2 (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0005]): Central cord is becoming more oval in shape. U/V in dorsal gray matter is becoming narrower. Dorsal gray matter bulges still present. Motor neurons are still dispersed in ventral horn.\nL3 (Fig. 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0005]): U/V in dorsal gray matter is becoming narrower still. Dorsal gray matter bulges are becoming triangular, rather than bulging out. Motor neurons are starting to cluster laterally.\nL4 (Fig. 5E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-fig-0005]): Dorsal groove is becoming narrower and more V in shape.

The red dotted circle represents the bulges in the dorsal gray matter, (B) L1, (C) L2, (D) L3, (E) L4, (F) L5, (G) L6.\nBelow L6, the lumbar spinal cord starts to look like L1-L3 again, hence the need to be consistent when preparing, cutting, and analyzing the sections.\nCollecting results",
    "The most important factor when counting the motor neurons is to be consistent. Some interneurons will be mistakenly included in the count because they cannot be distinguished from the motor neurons. This is not an issue as they will be included in counts from both control and experimental group sections. If a motor neuron dissects the 45° line, include it in your count and be consistent between sections. As is expected, not all sections will come out perfectly. Sections may break when cut, fold over when annealing to the slide, or be obscured by air bubbles for example. If a section is folded, broken, and/or motor neurons cannot be counted, then make a note in the table and move on to the next section. The fewer broken sections the better to ensure reliability and validity of the counting.\nYou should expect around six to seven motor neurons per side, per spinal cord section in L5 in a wild-type mouse, however this varies between sections. Some sections will have very few motor neurons per side, with others having more than ten. Aged mice or mice with mutations affecting motor neurons may have fewer motor neurons, hence the need for a robust control group of sufficient size for you to be confident in the results.\nWhen counting motor neurons, collect the information as shown in Tables 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-tbl-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.428#cpz1428-tbl-0002].
