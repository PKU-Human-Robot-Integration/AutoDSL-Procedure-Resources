    "This method is appropriate for 30 samples (approximately 150 seeds per sample). Three biological replicates of ten different field-grown wheat varieties were used here.\n1. Preparation of grains\nRetrieve samples (whole grains) from -80 °C storage.\n\tNOTE: Freeze-drying of seeds is recommended shortly after harvest if samples are being collected from multiple seasons. This minimizes any changes in metabolite concentration that may occur after varying periods of storage. To do this, transfer seeds to a 15 mL plastic centrifuge tube (approximately 300 seeds will fill the tube) and cover with aluminum foil. Pierce the foil two-three times using a pin and freeze dry the whole grains overnight (approximately 24 h). Samples can either be returned to the -80 °C freezer at this stage or the next step can be carried out.\nGrind the seeds using a laboratory blender for two runs on high mode for 20 s.\n\tNOTE: The blender used for this protocol requires a minimum of approximately 150 seeds to fill the blender to blade height and give a relatively homogenously ground grain sample.\nRemove the blender from the base and tap the side of the blender to bring any coarsely ground grain to the surface of the sample. Coarse material can be discarded or stored.\nTransfer powder-like finely ground material from the blender to a 2 mL plastic microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: Wash the blender with deionized water and rinse with LC-MS-grade MeOH between samples. Ensure the blender is completely dry before proceeding to the next sample.\nReturn finely ground grain samples to the freezer or proceed to the next step (metabolite extraction).\n2. Preparation of extraction solvent\nNOTE: Prepare extraction solvent on the same day as performing the extractions.",
    "Prepare at least 2 mL of 1 mg/mL of each standard. Use acetonitrile (ACN) to prepare 2-aminoanthracene, miconazole and d6-transcinnamic acid. Use water to prepare 13C6-sorbitol.\nTake 2 mL of each 1 mg/mL standard and add to a 100 mL volumetric flask.\nFill the volumetric flask to the line with acetonitrile. Ensure that 100 mL of acetonitrile contains 20 µg/mL of each of the internal standards: 2-aminoanthracene, miconazole, 13C6-sorbitol, d6-transcinnamic acid.\n3. Metabolite extraction\nWeigh 200 mg of finely ground grain into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 500 µL of extraction solvent to 200 mg of finely ground grain sample.\nMix using a homogenizer for 2 runs of 20 s at 6,500 rpm.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min at 16,100 x g.\nTransfer the supernatant to a 2 mL plastic tube.\nRepeat this procedure from steps 3.1 to 3.5 twice more to give a total supernatant volume of approximately 1.5 mL.\nVortex to mix the supernatant.\nTransfer an equal volume (55 µL) of each extract to a separate 2 mL tube to make a pooled grain extract sample.\nTransfer a 50 µL aliquot of the extract to a glass vial.\n\tNOTE: Extracts can be frozen (-80 °C) at this point or proceed to the next step and follow through to the LC-MS analysis.\n4. Preparation of solutions for LC-MS analysis\nCAUTION: For concentrated acid, always add acid to water/solvent.\nPrepare 50 mL of 1 M ammonium formate stock solution. Weigh 3.153 g of ammonium formate and transfer to a 50 mL volumetric flask. Fill volumetric flask to the line with LC-MS grade H2O.",
    "Prepare 1 L of the mobile phase A consisting of 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid. To do so, add approximately 500 mL of LC-MS grade water to a 1 L volumetric flask. Add 10 mL of 1 M ammonium formate stock and 1 mL of formic acid. Fill volumetric flask to the line with LC-MS grade H2O. Transfer to a 1 L bottle and sonicate for 15 min to degas.\nPrepare 1 L of mobile phase B consisting of 10 mM ammonium formate in 79:20:1 acetonitrile:isopropyl alcohol:water, 0.1% formic acid ratio. Add 200 mL of isopropanol to a 1 L volumetric flask. Add 10 mL of 1 M ammonium formate stock and 1 mL of formic acid. Fill volumetric flask to the line with acetonitrile. Transfer to a 1 L bottle and sonicate for 15 min to degas.\n\tNOTE: Dilute the 1 M ammonium formate into the isopropyl alcohol (IPA) before adding the ACN. Ammonium formate is insoluble in CAN.\nPrepare 1 L of mobile phase C consisting of 10 mM ammonium formate in the ratio of 89:10:1 isopropyl alcohol:acetonitrile:water. To do so, add approximately 500 mL of isopropanol, 10 mL of 1 M ammonium formate stock and 100 mL of acetonitrile to a 1 L volumetric flask. Fill to the line with isopropanol. Transfer to a 1 L bottle and sonicate for 15 min to degas.\nPreparation of LC-MS system wash solvents\n\t\nReplace the pump-head wash solution with fresh solution. Use 50% methanol, 10% isopropyl alcohol or other as recommended by the manufacturer.",
    "Prepare strong and weak needle wash solutions for washing the injection fluidics prior to and following sample injection. For the strong wash, add equal volumes of ACN and IPA. For the weak wash, prepare a solution of 10% ACN (requiring approximately 500 mL and 1 L of each of the strong and weak washes respectively for this protocol and number of samples) in separate bottles.\nSet the needle wash volumes to 600 µL and 1800 µL for the strong and weak washes, respectively.\n5. Preparation of samples for LC-MS analysis\nAs per the manufacturers standard operating procedure for the preparation of 400 ng/µL leucine enkephalin, pipette 7.5 mL of water into the 12 mL leucine-enkephalin vial containing 3 mg of leucine-enkephalin. Freeze at -80 °C in 50 µL aliquots.\nPrepare 100 mL of 5% ACN containing 200 ng/mL leucine-enkephalin (50 µL of 400 ng/µL leucine enkephalin). Prepare on the same day as LC-MS analysis.\nAdd 950 µL of 5% acetonitrile containing the injection standard leucine-enkephalin to the 50 µL sample aliquot prepared from step 3.\nVortex to mix the prepared sample.\n6. LC-MS setup\nNOTE: A detailed description of instrument and acquisition method setup is described in the manufacturer's user guide. A general guide and the details specific to this protocol are outlined below. The following steps can be completed at any time prior to acquiring the data.\nOpen an LC-MS hardware profile.\nSet up the chromatographic method as outlined in Table 1. Ensure that the LC system is equipped with a quaternary solvent manager to set up this gradient.\n\tNOTE: IPA is a viscous solvent. It should be introduced at a low flow rate and a sufficient equilibration time should be used before increasing the composition to 98.0%. These steps will prevent the LC system from overpressuring and stopping.",
    "Set up the mass spectrometer acquisition methods for each of the positive and negative ToF-MS modes over the m/z range 50-1,300.\n\tNOTE: The instrument used for the work presented here requires positive and negative methods to be calibrated and run individually (i.e., polarity switching within a method is not possible).\nIf the LC column is new, condition the column according to the manufacturer's recommendation.\n\tNOTE: The following steps should be completed directly before data acquisition.\nIn an 'MS only' hardware profile, calibrate the mass spectrometer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Complete this step prior to each mode of acquisition, ensuring that the system has stabilized in each given modality before calibration.\nPurge and flush the LC fluidics system using LC-MS grade solvents, including mobile phase and wash solvents.\nEquilibrate the LC system using the LC method starting conditions, ensuring that column pressure has stabilized.\nInject sodium formate (0.5 mM in 90% IPA) at the beginning of the sample sequence (described below) to check the instrument calibration.\nSet up the instrument sequence table so that solvent and preparative (extraction) blanks are analyzed first; followed by pooled QC samples (6-10) for system conditioning; then the randomized sample list with QC samples run at regular intervals (e.g., every fifth injection) as technical replicates. Run two QC samples at the end of the sequence.\n\tNOTE: It is helpful to include the date and injection/acquisition order in the sample filename as well as the sample ID. For example: YYYY MMDD_Injection number_Variety_Biological replicate. Before pressing start, ensure the LC column pressure is stable and that the LC is connected to the MS.\n7. Data processing\nNOTE: A general data processing workflow is presented in Figure 1.",
    "Check the data quality (internal standard mass accuracy (calculation below) and signal reproducibility) while the sequence is running.
