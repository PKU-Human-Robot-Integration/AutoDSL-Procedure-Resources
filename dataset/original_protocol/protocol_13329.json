    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, and informed written consent was obtained from the patients involved in this study.\n1. Preoperative work-up\nPerform the high-resolution contrast-enhanced CT12,13 (see Table of Materials) to assess the tumor's extent and search for any abnormal vasculature.\nDetermine the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients.\n\t\nSelect patients meeting the following criteria: (1) a tumor located in the uncinate process that needs radical resection; (2) resectable cases.\nExclude the following cases: (1) metastatic tumor; (2) patients with poor cardio-pulmonary function that may not tolerate laparoscopic surgery; (3) a tumor that has invaded the major vessels such as SMA, common hepatic artery (CHA), or celiac artery (CA).\n2. Anesthetization steps\nUse 0.3 µg/kg sufentanil, 3 µg/mL propofol, and 0.15 mg/kg cis-atracurium (see Table of Materials) for anesthesia induction.\nPerform endotracheal intubation14 after the muscle relaxant takes effect.\nPuncture and catheterize the radial artery and central vein under the guidance of ultrasound.\nUse target-controlled infusion (TCI) of 1-2 µg/mL propofol, 1-3 ng/mL remifentanil, 1.53 µg/kg/min cis-atracurium, and sevoflurane (see Table of Materials) with an inhaled concentration of 1%-2% to maintain anesthesia, and keep the depth of anesthesia between 37 and 64 on the Nacrotrend Index15.\n\tNOTE: The Nacrotrend anesthesia monitoring system (see Table of Materials) is an anesthesia depth monitoring method developed in recent years. It obtains the original EEG, analyzes the changes in frequency and power in the EEG, integrates the factors of phase and harmonics, and expresses the anesthesia depth in the form of a value from 0-99.",
    "Set the ventilator parameters to volume control ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, an inhalation oxygen saturation of 60%, a gas flow of 2 L/min, and an end-expiratory carbon dioxide range of 35-45 mmHg.\n3. Installation\nRefer to our previously published8 article (Figure 1) for details on the patient position and trocar (see Table of Materials) location.\nSurgeon position: Ensure that the operator surgeon and the first assistant stand on the patient's right and left sides, respectively. Ensure that the holder of the laparoscope stands between the patient's legs.\n4. Surgery techniques\nInspect the peritoneal surfaces and intraperitoneal organs for any potential extrapancreatic metastases. Remove the greater omentum for better exposure, and open the lesser sac by severing the gastrocolic ligament.\nDissect the gallbladder triangle with an ultrasonic knife, then resect and sever the gallbladder artery and cystic duct, and finally, remove the gallbladder, and suspend the liver to expose the hepatoduodenal ligament and hilum (Figure 2).\nExplore the gap between the pancreatic neck and the SMV in order to assess the surgical resectability.\n\tNOTE: The preferred gap is the space between the posterior neck of the pancreas and the SMV, which is difficult to open and expose if the tumor has invaded the SMV.\nSuspend the transverse colon and its mesentery on the cephalic side to establish effective exposure.\nUsing the ileocolonic artery as the marker, open the transverse mesocolon. Protect the ileocolon artery and middle colonic artery.\nExpose the second and third segments of the duodenum, dissect along the right side of the SMV, and separate the second and third segments of the duodenum from the transverse mesocolon.",
    "Expose the main trunk of SMV and the proximal-dorsal jejunal vein (PDJV) between the SMV and SMA (Figure 3), and then ligate and dissect the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein (IPDV).\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as this might cause the IPDV to hemorrhage.\nPerform the median-anterior approach to the SMA following steps 4.8.1-4.8.4.\n\t\nStart the median-anterior approach to the SMA from the inferior colon region.\nPull the SMV just to the right, widen the operation field, and expose the SMA pulsation to determine its trajectory.\nExpose the right half of the SMA, and dissect outside the arterial sheath of the SMA on the anterior-right margin in order to separate the SMA from the pancreatic mesopancreas.\n\t\tNOTE: The middle colonic artery (MCA), which runs along the side of the vascular arch of the margin of the transverse mesocolon, can be directly linked to the trunk of the SMA in cases where it is difficult to identify the SMA, such as when it is difficult to assess arterial visual pulsation in obese patients. The best place to locate and identify the trunk of the SMA is where the MCA begins in the inferior colonic region. If required, color ultrasound assistance could be used.\nThrough the median-anterior approach to the SMA approach, expose the main branches of the IPDA or jejunal artery (JA) along the right side of the SMA, and then conduct a further follow-up to confirm them (Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The authors' experience is that IPDA and JA can be effectively identified by the subsequent left-posterior approach to the SMA.\nPerform the left-posterior approach to the SMA following steps 4.9.1-4.9.9.\n\t\nPlace the entire small bowel to the right side to facilitate space exposure between the fourth segment of the duodenum and the inferior vena cava.",
    "Dissect the fusion fascia, and expose the left renal vein (LRV) to establish the posterior space of the SMA.\nUse an ultrasonic scalpel to dissect the ligament of Treitz between the beginning part of the jejunum and the mesentery of the transverse colon.\nUse a stapler to divide the proximal jejunum.\nPlace an Fr8 catheter for suspending the dorsal sides of the SMA and SMV.\nTo facilitate SMA dissection on its periadventitial plane on the anterior-left border and its detachment from the mesopancreas, pull the catheter to the upper right side. Establish an effective exposure space at the left-posterior aspect of the SMA (Figure 5).\nTrace up the SMA to the root along the first jejunal artery (FJA).\nDissect the SMA on its periadventitial plane on the anterior-left margin in order to separate it from the pancreatic mesopancreas. Circumferentially dissect the SMA.\nLigate and dissect the IPDA (Figure 6). Sacrifice the FJA if it is involved in the tumor.\nUsing the median-anterior and left-posterior SMA approaches, separate the SMA and SMV from the uncinate process and mesopancreas completely (Figure 7).\nReturn to the superior region of the colon following steps 4.11.1-4.11.16.\n\t\nDraw the proximal jejunum from the dorsal of the SMA to the right.\nReveal the right gastrointestinal vein, the collateral right colonic vein, and the SMV trunk using an ultrasonic knife (see Table of Materials).\nExpose Henle's gastrocolic trunk vein to disconnect its distal and proximal ends on the right side of the SMV trunk.\n\t\tNOTE:Find Henle's gastrocolic trunk vein along the right reticular vein on the right side of the SMV.\nDivide the stomach 3-5 cm away from the pylorus using a stapler device (see Table of Materials).\nExpose the CHA at the superior margin of the pancreatic neck.",
    "Dissect along the CHA toward the first hepatic hilar to reveal the proper hepatic artery (PHA) and the right gastric artery (RGA). Ligate and sever the RGA.\nUse laparoscopic bulldog clamps (see Table of Materials) to temporarily occlude the common bile duct (CBD) after separating the CBD.\nDissect the hepatoduodenal ligament. Execute a lymphadenectomy along the CHA, PV, and PHA.\nLigate and dissect the right gastric artery.\nLocate the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) at the junction of the PHA with the CHA, and meticulously ligate or suture (5-0, see Table of Materials) the GDA to reduce the possibility of an ensuing erosion or hemorrhage.\nExplore the tunnel between the pancreatic neck and the SMV. Ligate and dissect the dorsal pancreatic artery (DPA).\nPlace two Fr14 catheters to block the pancreatic neck blood supply in order to reduce bleeding (Figure 8).\nDissect the parenchyma of the pancreatic neck using scissors. Suture (5-0, see Table of Materials) the bleeding point of the resection surface.\n\t\tNOTE: Examine a fast-frozen pathological specimen of the pancreatic stump to prove the negative margin.\nSuspend the splenic vein (SV) to establish exposure after the left first branch of the SMV has been ligated and dissected (Figure 9).\nLigate and dissect the uncinate process artery behind the SV. Identify and retain the alternative right hepatic artery originating from the SMA from the uncinate process artery.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, all the blood supplies to the tumor are completely occluded.\nLigate and dissect the branches of the PV.\nUsing the Kocher maneuver, cut off the lymphatics, and dissect the duodenum from the retroperitoneum. Resect the tumor in situ, and remove it en bloc following the oncologic principles of no-touch16,17.\nUse Child's method for the reconstruction of the digestive tract8,18.",
    "Perform a single-layer running suture hepaticojejunostomy from end to side using 4-0 absorbable sutures. Utilize an internal stent to perform a duct-to-mucosal, end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy.\n5. Postoperative management\nIf the gastric tube drainage is <200 mL, remove the tube on the next day.\nStart appropriate physical exercise if the vital signs are stable and the patient is generally in good condition.\nAssess the amylase level of the drainage liquid on postoperative day 3, and review the abdominal CT on postoperative day 7. Remove the drainage tubes if there is no evidence of biochemical leakage, lymphatic fistula, or hemorrhage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
