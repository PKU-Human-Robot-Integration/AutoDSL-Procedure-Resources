    "The Japanese medaka used in this study were treated humanely in accordance with the institutional guidelines of Toyo University, with due consideration for the alleviation of distress and discomfort.\n1. Silver Nanocolloids (SNCs)\nPurchase purified SNCs (20 mg/L−1, 99.99% purity, particle mean diameter about 28.4 ± 8.5 nm suspended in distilled water).\nValidate the purity and concentration of the silver by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses according to operating manual8. The pretreatment method for ICP-MS analyses is described in section 7.\n2. Preparation of SNC Solutions (Mixtures of Silver Colloids and Ag+) with Different Salinities\nPrepare 60× ERM consisting of 60 g NaCl, 1.8 g KCl, 2.4 g CaCl2·2H2O, and 9.78 g MgSO4·7H2O in 1 L of ultrapure water; adjust the pH to 7.0 with 1.25% NaHCO3 in ultrapure water.\nStir the ERM solution at 25 °C overnight.\nMix SNCs with diluted ERM. Prepare 40 ml of each SNC-ERM mixed solution. The final concentration is 10 mg/L−1 of SNCs in different concentrations of ERM (1x, 5x, 10x, 15x, 20x, or 30x).\nAdjust pH of the SNC-ERM mixed solution to 7.0 with 0.625% NaHCO3 in ultrapure water. pH adjustment is very important in preparing the SNC solution, because Ag+ release is facilitated by acidic conditions9.\nUse AgNO3 as a reference compound for SNCs.\n\t\nMix AgNO3 with diluted ERM. Prepare 40 ml of AgNO3-ERM mixed solution at an AgNO3 concentration of 15.7 mg/L-1 (10 mg/L−1 silver) in different concentrations of ERM (1x, 5x, 10x, 15x, 20x, or 30x).\n\t\tNote: To examine silver colloid toxicity, AgNO3 solution, which is a source of soluble silver, is used as a reference compound for SNCs, which are a mixture of silver colloids and soluble silver.\n3. Medaka Culture and Egg Harvesting\nObtain the medaka (O. latipes) (orange-red strain) (60 males and 60 females).",
    "Culture medaka as groups (20 males and 20 females as one group) in 1x ERM in 3 L tanks by using a medaka flow-through culturing system.\n\t\nCulture at the following conditions:\n\t\tpH range of the culture medium: 6.2 to 6.5  \n\t\tlight:dark cycle: 16:8 hr\n\t\ttemperature of the culture medium: 24 ± 0.5 °C\n\t\tosmotic pressure of the culture medium: 257 mOsm\nFeed medaka on Artemia salina nauplii at 10:00 (once a day) and feed an artificial dry fish diet at 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00, and 17:00 (five times a day).\n\t\nObtain A. salina nauplii.\nPrepare 5 L of a 3.0% salt solution in a plastic beaker.\nAdd 30 g of brine shrimp eggs to the salt solution in the beaker.\nIncubate the eggs at 25 °C for 48 hr with bubbling (4 L/min−1) using an aeration pump.\nAfter 48 hr, stop the bubbling.\nAllow the solution to stand for 5 to 10 min to separate the hatched A. salina nauplii (lower part of the solution) from the unhatched eggs and eggshells (upper part of the solution).\nRemove the upper layer of the solution by decantation.\nFilter the lower portion of the solution through a sieve with openings of 283 µm, and collect the nauplii that pass through on a net with openings of 198 µm.\nFeed the nauplii to the medaka within 6 hr.\nAfter the female medaka have spawned, remove the external egg clusters gently from the females' bodies or collect the eggs from the bottom of the fish tank by using a small net (net size 5 cm x 5 cm, hole size 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm).\nRinse the egg cluster with flowing tap water for 5 sec.\nAdd all of the rinsed egg clusters to 30x ERM solution.",
    "Remove the clusters from the solution after 1 min and place the egg clusters between dry paper towels and roll gently.\nPut the eggs back into the 30x ERM.\nSelect fertilized eggs under a dissecting microscope.\nPlace selected 810 eggs in 1x ERM in six-well plastic plates by using forceps.\nIncubate the eggs at 25 ± 0.1 °C in an incubator until developmental stage 21. (Developmental stages of the medaka embryos were defined from the work of Iwamatsu10.)\nPick out incubated eggs at developmental stage 21 under a dissecting microscope.\nRinse selected eggs with 1x ERM.\nSubject the rinsed eggs to exposure experiments (section 4).\n4. Toxicity Testing of SNCs or AgNO3 at Different ERM Salinities\nRinse medaka eggs (stage 21) three times with test solution [SNCs (10 mg/L−1) or AgNO3 (15.7 mg/L−1 as 10 mg/L−1 silver) at each concentration of ERM (1x, 5x, 10x, 15x, 20x, or 30x) at pH 7]. As controls, use eggs in 1× to 30× ERM at pH 7.\nAdd 15 rinsed eggs to 5 ml of each test solution in six-well plastic plates. (Perform the exposure experiments three times for SNC or AgNO3 toxicity testing using each test solution.)\nWrap the plates in aluminum foil.\nIncubate the wrapped plates at 25 °C in the dark until hatching or for 14 days.\nObserve the exposed eggs every 24 hr for biological changes and dead eggs (Figures 1 and 2).\nExchange the test solutions every 24 hr.\nPerform observations as follows.\n\t\nOn day 6 of exposure, count the heart rate (per 15 sec) of medaka embryos under a dissecting microscope by using a stopwatch (Figure 3a).\nOn day 6 of exposure, measure the eye size (diameter) of medaka embryos under a dissecting microscope by using a micrometer (Figure 3b).",
    "On hatching day, measure the full body lengths of larvae under a dissecting microscope by using a micrometer (Figure 3c).\nCount the total number of exposed eggs that hatch over the 14 days (Figure 3d).\n5. Isolation of Soluble Silver from SNC Solution, and Silver Analysis\nIsolate soluble silver from each SNC solution (a mixture of silver colloids and soluble silver) by filtering through a 3 kDa membrane filter at 14,000 x g and 4 °C for 10 min. Use a 3 kDa membrane filter to isolate soluble silver from the SNCs, because the reported mean diameter of aggregated SNCs in 1x ERM is 67.8 nm11 and that of Ag+ is 0.162 nm12; the 3 kDa membrane excludes particles with diameters of 2 nm or more13.\nMeasure the silver concentration in 50 µl of filtered solution (= the soluble silver concentration) by ICP-MS analysis (Figure 3e) according to the ICP-MS operating manual8. The pretreatment method for the ICP-MS analyses is described in section 7.\n6. Measurement of Silver Bioaccumulation in Medaka Embryos\nExpose medaka eggs (stage 21) to SNCs or AgNO3 as described in section 4.\nOn day 6 of exposure, remove chorion from the egg (i.e., dechorion) by using medaka hatching enzyme according to the protocol described in the Medaka Book14.\nMeasure the silver concentration of the dechorioned eggs by ICP-MS analysis according to the ICP-MS operating manual8 (Figure 3f). The pretreatment method for the ICP-MS analyses is described in section 7.\n7. Measurement of Silver Concentration by ICP-MS Analysis\nAdd samples [50 µl of silver solution (for validation of the silver concentration; section 1); three dechorionated embryos (section 5); or 50 µl of filtered solution (section 5)] to a 50 ml Teflon beaker.\nAdd 2.0 ml of ultrapure nitric acid to the 50 ml beaker.",
    "Heat the mixture on a hot plate at 110 °C until just before it dries out (about 3 hr).\nTo dissolve the organic matter completely, add 2.0 ml of ultrapure nitric acid and 0.5 ml of hydrogen peroxide to the beaker.\nHeat the mixture again on the hot plate until just before it dries out (about 3 hr).\nDissolve the residue in 4 ml of 1.0% ultrapure nitric acid solution.\nTransfer 4 ml of solution to a centrifuge tube.\nRepeat 7.6 to 7.7 twice (a total of three times). The final volume is 12.0 ml.\nMeasure the silver concentration of the sample (dissolved in 1.0% ultrapure nitric acid) by using ICP-MS analysis according to the operating manual8.\n\t\nUse an internal and an external standard solution (See Materials List) to quantify the silver concentration. The internal and external standard solution is accredited by American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). Detection limits of silver were 0.0018 ng/ml−1 (solution) and 0.016 ng mg-weight−1 (embryo body).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
