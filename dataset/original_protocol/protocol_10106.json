    "The housing and all procedures carried out were in accordance with German animal welfare legislation. All gauze, covering clothes, and surgical instruments are autoclaved and prepared before the operation. All procedures are carried out under sterile conditions.\n1. Preparation of the Rat for the Surgical Procedure\nPlace the rat in an induction chamber and anesthetize the rat with 4% vaporized isoflurane and 100% oxygen at 0.5 L/min for about 3 min, until the rat is completely anesthetized.\nTake the rat out of the induction chamber and measure its body weight.\nShave the fur of the surgical region on the abdomen.\nPlace the animal back into the isoflurane chamber for an additional 2 min to deepen anesthesia.\nPlace the rat on the operation table in supine position.\nFix the anesthesia mask to the mouth region of the rat and keep the animal anesthetized with a continuous gas flow of 2% vaporized isoflurane and 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 0.5 L/min.\nFix the limbs with pieces of tape.\nApply vet ointment on both eyes to prevent dryness.\nAdminister buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously, to relieve pain during the operation period.\nDisinfect the surgical field of the abdomen with 3 rounds of iodine tincture followed by 2 rounds of 70% alcohol.\nPlace sterilized gauze around the area where the incision will be made to only leave the operation field of the abdomen exposed.\nProceed to perform the operation when the toe-pinch withdrawal reflex of the rat is absent.\n2. Laparotomy of the Rat\nMake a transverse abdominal skin and muscle incision using scissors and an electrical coagulator.\nFix and pull the xiphoid process toward the head using a 4-0 polypropylene suture.",
    "NOTE: Pay attention to lift up the xiphoid process vertically to better expose the liver, but proceed with caution to avoid severe respiratory restriction and suffocation.\nOpen the peritoneal cavity by pulling both sides of the abdominal walls towards the head with two subcostal hooks to expose the liver.\nCover the duodenum and small intestine in the abdominal cavity with a moistened gauze to avoid drying.\nLift left and right median lobes up by using a moistened gauze and hold them against the thorax to better expose the hilum of the liver.\nPlace the rat under a stereomicroscope (8X magnification).\nDrop some warm saline into the abdomen and onto the surface of the liver and intestines every several minutes, to prevent drying during the whole procedure.\n3. Establishment of a Bypass Passage Within the Left Lateral Lobe\nDissect the left portal vein and ligate it with a 6-0 silk suture at the base (Figure 2A).\nBlock the left hepatic artery, the left bile duct along with the left median portal vein, the left median hepatic artery, and the left median bile duct with micro clamps to prevent a flow of the perfusate to the left median lobe (Figure 2B).\nSeparate the left lateral lobe by cutting off the surrounding ligaments of the lobe with micro scissors.\nBlock the left lateral hepatic vein by clamping at the base of the left lateral lobe with micro clamps (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: Make sure not to clamp the left portal vein as well by mistake.\nUse mosquito clamps to hold the ligature of the left portal vein and keep the vein with proper tension for later cannulation.\nCarefully make an incision in the front wall of the left portal vein by puncturing it with a 24-G needle-dwelling catheter ( Figure 3A).",
    "NOTE: To create a bypass, vascular access points on the left portal vein and the left hepatic vein are needed. For this step, it is preferred to create the vascular access by puncturing the vessels with a needle rather than making a larger incision using scissors. This reduces the risk of bleeding and later stenosis.\nWithdraw the catheter and take the needle out of the catheter to obtain a needle-free 24-G catheter.\nConnect the catheter to a perfusion tube, of which the other endpoint connects to a 20-mL syringe with 15 mL of 40 U/mL heparinized saline on a perfusion pump.\nTurn on the pump for perfusing the tube to expel air out from the tube and the needle-free catheter.\nTurn off the perfusion pump.\nAgain, insert the needle-free catheter into the left portal vein via the punctured incision on the vein (Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: Owing to the fact there is very limited space for fixing the catheter, it is not fixed at this point. Therefore, the surgeon should use care to avoid the displacement of the cannulated catheter.\nCarefully make another incision at the margin of the exposed region of the left lateral hepatic vein by puncturing it with a 22- or 24-G needle-dwelling catheter (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: It is recommended that the catheter be slightly smaller than the vessel.\nWithdraw the catheter and take the needle out of the catheter to obtain a needle-free 22-G catheter.\nTurn on the perfusion pump to perfuse heparinized saline into the left lateral lobe via the 24-G cannulated needle-free catheter of the left portal vein at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.\nUse dry gauze to absorb out-flowing waste fluid around the incision area of the left lateral hepatic vein.",
    "Cannulate the left lateral hepatic vein via the punctured incision of the vein with the 22-G needle-free catheter, to generate a fluid outlet to minimize intra-abdominal contamination (Figure 3D).\n\tNOTE: It is technically difficult to fix the cannulated catheter to the liver lobe. Therefore, the surgeon should pay attention to avoid displacement of the catheter. Alternatively, without cannulation of the left lateral hepatic vein with a catheter, waste fluid can also be absorbed at the incision region of the vein only with a dry gauze.\nKeep perfusing the left lateral lobe with heparinized saline for around 20 min (group 1) and then only with saline for 2 h, 3 h, or 4 h (group 2, group 3, and group 4, respectively).\nTurn off the pump to stop the perfusion.\n4. Physiological Reperfusion of the Left Lateral Lobe\nTake off both catheters from the left portal vein and the left lateral hepatic vein.\nClose the incision of the left portal vein with an 11-0 polyamide suture.\nClose the incision of the left lateral hepatic vein with an 11-0 polyamide suture as well.\nUnclamp the left lateral hepatic vein.\nUnclamp the left median portal vein, left bile duct, and left hepatic artery.\nCut off the ligature on the left portal vein to reopen the vein.\n5. Closure of the Abdominal Wall\nClose the muscle layer of the abdominal wall by interrupted suturing with a 4-0 absorbable polyglactin 910 suture.\nClose the skin layer of the abdominal wall by interrupted suturing with a 4-0 absorbable polydioxanone suture.\nAfter closing the abdomen, disinfect the skin incision with 70% alcohol.\n6. Postoperative Treatment of the Rat\nPlace the animal on a warming pad for resuscitation for about 10 min and then put it into a new cage.",
