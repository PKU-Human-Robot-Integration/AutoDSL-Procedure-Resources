    "All animal experiments were in accordance with Swiss Federal Animal Regulations and approved by the Veterinary Office of Zurich (n° 007/2017, 156/2019) assuring human care. Male C57BL/6 mice aged 10-12 weeks were kept on a 12 h day/night cycle with free access to food and water. Each experimental group consisted of six to eight animals. See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, equipment, and reagents used in this protocol.\n1. Partial hepatectomy in mice\nFor standard hepatectomy (70%), ligate and resect the left lateral lobe, the right portion of the median lobe, and the left portion of the median lobe (Figure 1B). For extended hepatectomy (86%)4, also remove the caudate lobes and the right anterior lobe (Figure 1C).\nNOTE: Standard hepatectomy is a procedure that has been used in liver regeneration research for many years. Protocols for this procedure are available3,17, including the video-assisted protocol of Mitchell and Willenbring18. Further details for the techniques used here for hepatectomies can be found in Supplementary File 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64493/64493fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Standard (70%) and extended (86%) hepatectomy in mice.

    "Prepare the perfusion, digestion, and preservation buffers (see Table 1).\n\t\nAdjust the pH of all buffer solutions at 37 °C by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or hydrogen chloride (HCl) as needed. The optimal pH for the buffers is 7.4.\nPlace the preservation buffer and Williams' Medium E on ice.\nPrepare the flow cytometry buffer and store it on ice.\nTable 1: Solutions and buffers used for the digestion and purification of hepatocytes. Please click here to download this Table.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64493/64493_Table_1_R2.xlsx]\n3. Preparation of perfusion equipment\nWarm the water bath to 42 °C and place the perfusion buffer (50 mL) and the digestion buffer (10-20 mL) in the water bath. Do not add collagenase to the digestion buffer yet.\nPrepare the peristaltic pump and insert the tubing. The complete perfusion setup is shown in Figure 2.\n\t\nConnect a 26 G IV cannula to the outlet end of the tubing using a Luer lock connector. Insert the inlet end of the tube into the prewarmed perfusion buffer tube in the water bath. Flush the tubing with 70% ethanol, followed by 50 mL of sterile sodium chloride (NaCl 0.9%). Prime the tubing with warm perfusion buffer (pump speed of 3 mL/min).\nSedate the mouse using isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (800 mL/min O2, 3%-5% isoflurane for induction and 2% for maintenance during the procedure). Handle isoflurane under a laboratory hood and provide adequate ventilation.\nAdminister buprenorphine subcutaneously 30 min before surgery at a dosage of 0.1 mg/kg body weight.\nTo prevent hypothermia, place the sedated mouse on a warming pad and put a rolled cloth tissue underneath the upper abdomen to elevate the liver above the other organs and facilitate access to the inferior vena cava.",
    "NOTE: Do not use tissue that is too thick as kinking of vessels is possible and perfusion efficacy would be affected.\nAdd eye ointment to prevent corneal damage.\nBefore starting surgery, ensure that the animal is adequately anesthetized by testing the pedal withdrawal reflex (foot pad pinch on both hind feet). In case of a response, supply additional anesthesia and retest before starting the procedure.\nClean the abdomen with 70% ethanol.\n\t\nReopen the midline incision by cutting the suture and gently pulling the wound edges apart. If the hepatectomy is older than 24-48 h, remove the suture and cut the skin with scissors.\nFix a 5-0 polypropylene suture to the sternum, pull it cranially, and fix it in this position. Use a retractor or simple clips to keep the abdomen open. The abdominal cavity has to be exposed as much as possible to optimize access and visualization.\nMove the intestines to the right using cotton swabs to reveal the portal vein and the vena cava. Use a wet cloth to retain the intestines.\nPlace a heavy object of approximately 2 cm height (e.g., a silicone-coated weight ring for volumetric flasks) adjacent to the mouse hind legs (Supplementary Figure S2A). Place the tubing with the connected 26 G IV cannula on the object and position the needle carefully on top of the vena cava. Adjust the length of the tubing.\nPut the prepared collagenase stock solution into the prewarmed digestion buffer tube. Add 250 µL of the stock solution to 10 mL of digestion buffer. Prepare 10-20 mL of digestion buffer per animal. For larger animals or perfusion of whole livers, prepare up to 30 mL of digestion buffer.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to add the collagenase stock solution to the warmed digestion buffer approximately 30 min prior to the start of the digestion process.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64493/64493fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Overview on the perfusion setup. (A) Surgical table with the equipment needed for the perfusion. (B) The materials needed for preparation of the liver, as well as hepatocyte extraction and isolation. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64493/64493fig02large.jpg]\n4. Cannulation and perfusion\nAdjust the pump speed to 3 mL/min and turn on the pump. Let the prewarmed perfusion buffer reach the needle. Discard the first 2-3 mL of perfusion buffer.\nPerform cannulation of the inferior vena cava.\n\t\nWhile the buffer is running through the needle, insert the 26 G IV cannula at a shallow angle into the vena cava below the kidney. Ensure that the needle bevel points upward.\nUse a cotton swab to gently pull the vena cava caudally below the puncture site so that the provided tension facilitates the insertion of the cannula into the vein. Look for blood in the flash chamber of the catheter when the needle enters the lumen.\nAdvance the needle an additional 2-3 mm to ensure that the tip of the plastic catheter also has entered the vein.\nSlide the plastic catheter over the needle and into the vena cava another 5 mm. Remove the needle slowly and very carefully.\n\t\tNOTE: Fixing the cannula with a ligature is not recommended. This step is time-consuming as the vessel must first be dissected for this purpose. If the cannula is loosely positioned and supported with an object, no further fixation is necessary (see perfusion setup in Supplementary Figure S2). To stabilize the cannulation site and prevent backflow, a single drop of monomeric n-butyl-cyanoacrylate can be added onto the cannulation site.",
    "When blood drops out of the cannula, fill it with warm perfusion buffer using a syringe.\nReattach the tube to the cannula, still running at a pump speed of 3 mL/min. Let the perfusion buffer enter the liver.\nAfter 2-3 s, look for white spots forming in the liver and/or expansion/swelling of the portal vein, which indicate that the perfusion buffer is flowing through the liver and entering the liver lobules from the central vein (Figure 3).\nWait for the portal vein to visibly swell within 1-2 s after the appearance of white spots on the liver surface. Cut the portal vein with scissors as distally as possible from the liver hilus. Use a micro vessel clip to label (not occlude) the cutting site (Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: This simplifies assessment of the flow through the liver during the perfusion process. The liver clears of blood instantly and turns yellow-white within a few seconds (Figure 3C). An additional cut through the skin on the right side of the abdominal opening facilitates the outflow of the blood as well as the perfusion solution (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S2B,C).\nIncrease the flow up to 4-7 mL/min depending on the weight of the animal, liver size, and the extent of the prior hepatectomy.\nClamp the portal vein with tweezers or vascular clamp for 7-10 s. Make sure no fluid is passing through.\n\tNOTE: The liver swells visibly during clamping and relaxes upon release. This is crucial to flush the whole liver and clear it of any remaining blood.\nPerform a second clamp after approximately 30 s and make sure that the liver swells and relaxes. Continue with flushing the animal until the buffer flowing out of the portal vein is clear, but at least for 3-4 min.",
    "NOTE: The pump speed depends on the tube as well as the size of the liver. It must be evaluated individually.\nAt this point of the procedure, euthanasia should have occurred secondary to exsanguination. Confirm that systemic circulation has stopped (no heartbeat or flickering of the heart). To ensure death, bilateral pneumothorax is performed at this stage of the procedure as secondary physical method of euthanasia.\n\tNOTE: Reduce the pump speed slightly if systemic circulation has stopped (no heartbeat or flickering of heart).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64493/64493fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Perfusion process from cannulation to digestion. (A) Anatomy of the mouse liver with the inferior vena cava (white arrow) and the portal vein (yellow arrow). (B) Cannulation of the inferior vena cava. The cannula is secured with a ligature (white arrow), and the location of the outflow through the opened portal vein is marked (not clamped) with a micro vessel clamp. (C) Note the appearance of patchy structures before the perfusion buffer has cleared the liver from all remaining blood (white arrow). The skin is incised (yellow arrow) and a cotton swab is placed to ensure drainage of blood and perfusion fluid. Intermittent clamping can be performed with a vascular clamp or tweezers. (D) The liver should be cleared of all blood (*). After the collagenase-containing digestion buffer has entered the liver, it will no longer relax after clamping and the liver lobes will increase in size. (E) After a while, a bubbly appearance on the surface of the liver can be observed (*).

Digestion\nPause the perfusion pump and quickly transfer the inlet tubing from the perfusion buffer to the prewarmed digestion buffer. Restart the pump.",
    "Before the digestion buffer reaches the liver, clamp the portal vein one more time for 3-4 s. Ensure that the liver relaxes upon release of the clamp and the perfusion fluid remains clear.\n\tNOTE: The digestion buffer contains phenol red and is easily distinguishable from the clear perfusion buffer. This allows for easy tracking within the tube.\nAs soon as the digestion buffer has reached the liver, clamp the portal vein once again with a micro vessel clip.\n\tNOTE: When clamping, the liver swells but does not relax upon release of the clamp. This is normal.\nTo facilitate the digestion process, close the superior vena cava with a vascular clamp directly below the diaphragm to allow the digestion buffer to pass from the inferior vena cava to the liver to the outflow through the opened portal vein.\n\tNOTE: This clamping ensures that the systemic circulation is bypassed and unnecessary contact with residual blood components/inhibitors is prevented. This step is optional, as it is difficult to approach the superior vena cava behind the enlarged liver tissue after sham surgery, but access is much easier in hepatectomized mice.\nDigest for approximately 4 min at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. As digestion progresses, look for signs of the liver beginning to swell and small clear/transparent sections on the surface of the liver. Furthermore, observe that the liver takes on the texture of a wet piece of cloth and appears almost soggy (Figure 3E). Probe the consistency by carefully touching with a damp cotton swab.",
    "Continue with the perfusion until a marked difference in the surface texture of the liver can be observed. Observe that the liver assumes a very light color and a bubbly appearance (Figure 3E), and the Glisson's capsule (i.e., the liver sack) separates from the parenchyma. Stop the digestion process as soon as the liver has acquired these properties, as over-digestion can damage the hepatocytes. Remove the needle before air gets into the liver.\n\tNOTE: Usually 10-20 mL of digestion buffer is needed to reach sufficient digestion. This depends on the animal's size, extent of hepatectomy, tubing setup, and quality of the collagenase solution. If needed, increase the perfusion time rather than the perfusion speed. Too much pressure in the vascular system can cause the liver to burst and the perfusion/digestion fluid might be lost to the retroperitoneal space.\n6. Preparation of the liver\nRemove the liver gently from the abdominal cavity. Be very careful as it is now very flimsy and fragile.\nGrasp the central connective tissue between the lobes using forceps and slightly lift it upward, using it as an anchor point.\nCut all the connections of the liver to other organs, remove the gall bladder, and place the liver in the ice-cold preservation buffer.\n\tNOTE: Ideally, hepatocyte extraction and further processing should take place immediately to maintain the viability of hepatocytes. However, if necessary, the liver can be stored for a short time at 4 °C (e.g., for transport). This delay should not exceed 30-40 min.\n7. Hepatocyte extraction\nTransfer the liver to a 10 cm Petri dish and add 10 mL of ice-cold Williams' Medium E.",
    "Rupture the Glisson's capsule with fine-tip tweezers in a few locations along the liver surface. Grasp a central part (e.g., connective tissue at the liver hilus) with two pairs of tweezers and slowly pull them apart, allowing the capsule to tear without damaging the hepatocytes. Release the cells by gently shaking the capsule (Supplementary Figure S3).\n\tNOTE: Ideally, the liver tears apart easily and releases the cells. Do not apply force. A cell scraper can help to completely remove all cells and increase cell yield. Do not cut the liver into pieces with scissors.\nFilter 5 mL of liver pulp through a 100 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL tube. Rinse the filter with 10 mL of fresh ice-cold medium. Filter the remaining 5 mL of pulp through the cell strainer.\n\tNOTE: Use a 25 mL serological pipette to transfer the liver pulp with the dissociated hepatocytes (Figure 4A). Smaller pipettes with smaller openings increase the shear stress and irreversibly damage the hepatocytes.\nAdd a total of 30 mL of cold medium to rinse the Petri dish, filter it, and add the suspension to the 50 mL tube until it is full. All isolated cells are now in suspension (Figure 4B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64493/64493fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Purification by gentle centrifugation.

Hepatocyte isolation\nSpin at 50 × g for 5 min at 4 °C (lowest acceleration and lowest brake possible).",
    "NOTE: Hepatocytes are denser than non-parenchymal liver cells. Due to the low centrifugation force, only hepatocytes are pelleted, while other cells (e.g., immune cells, erythrocytes, and sinusoidal cells) remain in the supernatant.\nAspirate most of the supernatant, leaving 1 mL to resuspend the cells by gently swirling the tube.\nAdd 40 mL of cold Williams' E medium and spin again at 50 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (low acceleration, low brake) to further remove dead hepatocytes and cell debris and pellet viable and fatty hepatocytes (Figure 4C).\nDiscard most of the supernatant, leaving 1 mL to resuspend the cells by swirling the tube.\nAdd 40 mL of cold Williams' E medium and spin again at 50 × g for 5 min at 4 °C (low acceleration, low brake).\nAspirate most of the supernatant, leaving 1 mL to resuspend the cells by gently swirling the tube.\n\tNOTE: Do not stop this process until cells are fixed or analyzed. Hepatocytes are very fragile and any delay in the perfusion, digestion, and purification process can damage the cells.\nDetermine the final cell concentration after the addition of trypan blue, using a Neubauer-improved counting chamber.\n\tNOTE: Most debris and non-parenchymal cells have now been removed, resulting in a clean pellet of approximately 10-15 × 106 hepatocytes left after 70%-hepatectomy.\nDepending on the desired concentration, add more ice-cold medium. Use the hepatocyte cell suspension for any downstream analysis or initiate a primary cell culture.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, only few immune and non-parenchymal cells (<5%) remain in the suspension. If further purification is desired, perform a negative selection of CD31+ and CD45+ cells by magnetic- or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (MACS/FACS). To date, there is no reliable and robust surface marker for liver parenchymal cells.",
    "9. Preparation of the isolated hepatocytes for flow cytometry\nCentrifuge the hepatocytes at 100 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and add the desired amount of flow cytometry buffer, depending on the concentration of the cell suspension.\nAdd 1 mL of cell suspension in a flow cytometry tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 100 × g and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 100-200 µL of the diluted Alexa Fluor 488 Zombie green viability dye (concentration 1:400) to the cells and shake them gently. Carefully resuspend the hepatocytes by manual shaking or using a vortex mixer at low speed (maximum 2-3) for 2 s.\n\tNOTE: Do not use small pipette tips to resuspend the cells. They are very fragile and the applied shear stress causes damage and reduces cell viability. If pipetting is not avoidable, use a 1,000 µL pipette after cutting off the smallest part from the tip to enlarge the diameter and pipette the cells very slowly.\nPlace the tubes on ice or store them at room temperature, depending on the desired staining. Incubate the cells for 20-30 min in the dark.\nAdd 2 mL of flow cytometry buffer and wash the cells 3x. Centrifuge the cells after each washing step at 100 × g for 5 min.\nAdd 2 mL of fixation buffer (1:1 4% PFA and PBS). Carefully resuspend the hepatocytes by manual shaking or using a vortex mixer at low speed (maximum 2-3) for 2 s.\nFix the cells for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 100 × g for another 5 min, discard the supernatant, and add flow cytometry buffer.\n\tNOTE: Cells can be stored in flow cytometry buffer prior to analysis up to 72 h after isolation.\n10. Analyzing hepatocytes with flow cytometry\nAnalyze the hepatocytes using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter.",
    "NOTE: Consider the relatively large size of hepatocytes and adjust the voltages. Start with a low voltage and do not go higher than 350 V for forward scatter (FSC) and 220 V for side scatter (SSC).\n\t\nAdjust the voltages for FSC and SSC to the estimated large size of the cells. Identify the hepatocyte population and record all events using SSC-A and FSC-A (Figure 5A).\nObserve that debris and non-parenchymal cells are displayed at the bottom left corner of the FSC versus SSC density plot and are excluded (Figure 5A).\nAs doublet cells can affect the analysis, construct a side scatter height (SSC-H) versus side scatter area (SSC-A) density plot to exclude doublets, as shown in Figure 5B.\nSelect the final hepatocyte population by gating CD31- (endothelial marker) and CD45- (immune marker) cells (Figure 5C).\nSubscription Required.
