    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPerforming worm lysis\nTiming: ∼1 h\nKeep the worm pellets on ice (or thaw on ice) and add an appropriate amount of lysis buffer (∼1 mL for ∼30,000 worms); incubate on ice for 15 min.\nResuspend the worms in the lysis buffer by trituration using a 1 mL pipette, and transfer to a microfuge tube pre-cooled on ice.\nRupture the worms in the lysis buffer by:\nSnap-freezing the tubes in liquid nitrogen followed immediately by quickly thawing in a 37°C water-bath. Repeat this freeze-thaw cycle four times.\nEnhance worm lysis by subjecting the sample to four sonic pulses of 30 s each at the setting 4 on the VirSonic sonicator (VirTis, SP Industries, Warminster, PA), with cooling on ice between pulses.\n(After the sonication, the lysate can be visualized under a light microscope to confirm worm lysis)\nNote: After this stage, the lysates are always kept away from direct light due to the light sensitivity of SNO-proteins.\nBlocking the free thiols\nTiming: ∼45 min\nCentrifuge the sonicated worm lysate at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet any worm-debris, and transfer the lysate supernatant to a 15 mL conical tube at 20°C–25°C.\nMake up the total volume of the worm lysates to 1.8 mL by adding an appropriate volume of the HEN buffer and perform protein quantification of an aliquot by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) method.\nNote: Total protein amount should be in the range of 1–4 mg per tube; lesser amounts will yield inconsistent signals.",
    "Add 200 μL of 25% Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to a final concentration 2.5% to the quantified worm lysate to denature the proteins and add 30 μL of 10% (v/v) of S-Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) to a final concentration 0.15% to block all free thiols. Incubate in a water-bath at 50°C for 30 min to fully denature proteins so all free thiols are blocked. Vortexing every 5 min improves the blocking efficiency.\nNote: Dilute the MMTS to 10% (v/v) in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for use in step 4. Also, if the supernatant seems turbid after centrifugation in step 2, an additional spin at 20,000 × g for 10 min can be performed. Other thiol-modifying agents can be used to block cysteine residues in place of MMTS. These include iodoacetate, iodoacetamide and N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) (Jaffrey, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Kenyon and Bruice, 1977[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). However, each of these blocking agents has different reactivity and accessibility toward protein thiols, which will be influenced by assay conditions, and more than one blocking agent may be required for complete blocking (Seth and Stamler, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). We prefer use of MMTS for this protocol as it leads to complete blocking of free thiols quickly under our described conditions, as demonstrated by the –Ascorbate control (Forrester et al., 2009b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nProtein precipitation, resuspension, and quantification\nTiming: ∼1.5 h\nAdd 3 volumes (6 mL) of ice-cold acetone to the blocked worm lysates to precipitate proteins, and mix well by inverting a few times. Incubate the samples for 20 min at −20°C to aid the precipitation. This step removes the excess free MMTS that would interfere with downstream steps.\nPause Point: Acetone precipitation can be left 16–18 h at −20°C.\nThe precipitated proteins are pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C in a swinging bucket centrifuge.",
    "Note: If the pellet is not tight and moves when the tube is inverted, centrifuge longer, up to an additional 30 min at 4,000 × g.\nCarefully decant the supernatant without disturbing the pellet, and gently rinse the pellet (without dislodging it) 4 times by gently adding 2 mL of ice-cold 70% acetone along the walls of the tube and then removing it by tilting the tube at an angle.\nAfter the final rinse, remove any remaining 70% acetone with a P-200 tip, followed by a P-20 tip, and then air dry the pellet for 15 min by leaving the uncapped tube at 20°C–25°C, but protected from light.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL of HENS buffer (HEN buffer + 1% SDS) by triturating up and down with a P-200 pipet tip. Alternatively, the pellet can be dissolved by sonicating three times for 1 s each.\nPerform protein quantification using the BCA assay as in step 3.\nReduction of SNOs to free thiols and binding to the resin\nTiming: ∼4 h\nTo a microfuge tube, add lysate to contain 2 mg of total blocked protein, and make up its volume to 400 μL with HENS buffer.\nThen add the following:\n50 μL of 500 mM sodium ascorbate, to a final concentration of 50 mM.\n50 μL of SNO-RAC resin (from a 50% slurry, mix well and transfer using wide-orifice tips) from step 6 under PREPARATION OF THE SNO-RAC RESIN.\nNote: In this step, addition of ascorbate specifically reduces the S–NO group on proteins, leading to the formation of free thiols (wherever NO was bound), which then chemically react with the SNO-RAC resin to form covalent disulfide.",
    "Simultaneously, for the minus ascorbate control sample, in a separate tube place an equal amount of protein plus HENS buffer up to 400 μL, but instead add 50 μL of HEN buffer (i.e., instead of the ascorbate) plus 50 μL of SNO-RAC beads.\nNote: In the absence of ascorbate, there should not be any available free thiols in the sample for reaction with the SNO-RAC resin. Thus, this sample serves as a control for the thiol blocking step, and should be performed for every condition.\nCritical: Protect the samples from direct sunlight and UV light.\nCover each tube with aluminum foil and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 4 h on a tube-rotator (Barnstead International, Model #415110) in the dark.\nWashing and elution\nTiming: ∼1 h\nCentrifuge the sample tubes at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 20°C–25°C in a swinging bucket centrifuge and remove the supernatant by aspirating with a 18G needle attached to a vacuum line.\nNote: Do not centrifuge at lower temperature as that might cause SDS precipitation.\nWash the resin by:\nAdding 1 mL of HENS buffer and inverting the tube three times to gently disperse the pellet, followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 20°C–25°C. Remove the supernatant by aspirating with a 18G needle attached to a vacuum line. Repeat this wash step more three times, for four total washes.\nWash the resin with 1 mL of 10-fold-diluted HENS buffer (HENS buffer diluted 10-fold with Milli-Q water) followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 20°C–25°C. Aspirate the supernatant. Repeat this step once more.\nAspirating all the remaining wash buffer from tube with a 27G needle attached to a vacuum line. Completely air dry the pelleted resin, which now contains the chemically-bound SNO-proteins, for ∼15 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Elute the intact SNO-proteins by adding 35 μL of elution buffer: 1× Laemmli sample buffer + 10% β-mercaptoethanol, followed by:\nGentle agitation of the samples (flick with finger intermittently) at 20°C–25°C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min to separate the eluted proteins in the supernatant from the pelleted resin.\nUsing thin gel-loading pipet tips (which will exclude the resin beads), remove all the supernatant liquid and place it in a fresh tube at 20°C–25°C.\nThe eluted SNO-RAC samples can now be stored in −20°C until they are ready to be run on a denaturing SDS-Polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gel or used immediately. Load on gel after heating at 94°C for 4 min to denature."
