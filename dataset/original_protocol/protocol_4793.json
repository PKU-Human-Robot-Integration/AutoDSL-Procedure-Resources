    "Preparation and plating of human Embryonic Stem (hES) cells-Time: day -6 to day 0Culture hES cell line HUES9 on matrigel-coated plates (see hES qualified Matrigel in Recipes) until they form large colonies (~1 x 106 cells) using hES cell media (see Materials and Reagents) (Figure 1A).Dilute reduced growth factor matrigel in ice cold DMEM/F12 using pre-chilled 5 ml pipets and 200 μl pipet tips: mix 100 μl of matrigel on ice and 6 ml of ice cold DMEM/F12.Add 1 ml of freshly prepared matrigel per well of a 6-well plate. Note: Place a sterile coverslip before adding the matrigel for immunofluorescence analysis.Evenly distribute the matrigel and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C into a water jacketed incubator.During matrigel incubation, discard hES cell media and wash with 1 ml of 1x PBS pre-warmed at 37 °C. Note: This protocol is adapted to the use of 3 well of a 6-well plate with large hES cell colonies as starting material.Discard PBS and add 1 ml of Accutase pre-warmed at room temperature.Incubate the hES cell plate until the cells start to detach (round shaped cells) at 37 °C (1-2 min).Stop the reaction with 1 ml of hES cell media.Collect the cells into a 50 ml conical tube with a P1000 pipet tip by pipetting up and down.Add 6 ml of warmed hES cell media.Add ROCK inhibitor Y27632 to reach the final concentration of 10 μM.Centrifuge at 1,300 rpm (400 x g) for 5 min at room temperature.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells into 12 ml of warm hES cell media.Add ROCK inhibitor Y27632 to reach the final concentration of 10 μM.Take the matrigel-coated plate from the incubator and discard the DMEM/F12 remaining on each well.Distribute 2 ml of hES cells suspension in each well of the matrigel-coated plate.",
    "Swirl the plate and incubate into an incubator at 37 °C.Change culture media every day until the cells reach full confluency (100%).Differentiation-Time: day 0 to day 21Prepare and sterile filter CI media needed for two weeks.Upon full confluency, remove hES cell media from the plate and add 2 ml of freshly prepared CI media (Figure 1B).Change media every day by slowly dispensing warmed CI media on the side of the well for at least 21 days (Figure 1C).Cell collection and analysisFor gene expression analysisDiscard the media, wash with 1 ml of 1x PBS and add 1 ml of Trizol reagent. Pipet up and down with a P1000 pipet tip and collect all the cells. Store at -80 °C or proceed to RNA extraction. Differentiation efficiency was confirmed by real-time PCR using primers against SIX6, CRX, S-opsin (OPN1SW), cone arrestin [also known as arrestin 3 (ARR3)], cone transducing (GNAT2), phosphodiesterase 6H (PDE6H) and phosphodiesterase 6C (PDE6C). Primers sequences are: SIX6 (F; CCTGCAGGATCCATACCCTA and R; ACCTGCTGCTGGAGTCTGTT), CRX (F; CCTTCTGACAGCTCGGTGTT and R; CCACTTTCTGAAGCCTGGAG), S-opsin (F; TGTGCCTCTCTCCCTCATCT and R; GGCACGTAGCAGACACAGAA), Cone Arrestin (F; CCCAGAGCTTTGCAGTAACC and R; CACAGGACACCATCAGGTTG), PdE6h (F; TACTCTGCCTGCTCCAGCTT and R; GAGAGTGGCAGAACCTCTGG), PdE6c (F; TTGGGAACAAGGAGATCTGG and R; GGCTCCTCCTTCTTGCTTTT) (Zhou et al., 2015).For protein analysisDetach the cells in the culture media using a cell scraper. Centrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 200 μl of protease inhibitor and store at -20 °C or proceed to protein extraction. Protein expression can be analyzed by western blotting using antibodies against CRX, S-opsin, cone arrestin and cone transducing (Zhou et al., 2015).For immunofluorescence analysisDiscard the media, wash with 1 ml of 1x PBS and add 1 ml of fresh PFA at 4%. Incubate 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Discard PFA and proceed to immunofluorescence using antibodies against CRX, S-opsin, ABCA4 and cone arrestin. Coverslips can be mounted on slides after secondary antibody incubation (Figure 1D) (Zhou et al., 2015)."
