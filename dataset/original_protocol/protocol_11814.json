    "The study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Kansai Medical University in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. All specimens were collected and used with informed consent from the donors.\n1. Preparation\nAfter obtaining informed consent, take blood from healthy adult donors. Here, blood was collected from four male blood donors between the ages of 28-38.\n\t\nRecommend donors to drink 500 mL of water 6 h before blood collection.\n\t\tNOTE: The reference ranges for hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC) count, and platelet (PL) concentration in healthy adults are described by Vajpayee19. In order to be suitable for blood donation, the donor’s blood analysis is required to be within these ranges.\n2. Blood collection\nHave the blood donors sit during the procedure.\nWear gloves. Fasten a tourniquet on the donor’s upper arm while the donor makes a fist.\nOnce a suitable vein is found, sterilize the skin twice with 70% alcohol and insert the needle.\nUse a 21 G syringe to collect blood. Do not loosen the tourniquet during the blood draw.\n\t\nUse an 8.5 mL blood collection tube to collect the blood. Observe the state of the blood in the tube and change to a new tube as soon as the blood flow slows down.\nCollect a sufficient amount of blood to make the PRP. Collect four tubes of anticoagulated blood with a total volume of 34 mL. Invert the tubes 10 times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant.\nUse a 10 mL serum blood collection tube (see Table of Materials) without anticoagulant to collect blood for making the activator (see Step 4). Collect 10 mL of non-anticoagulant blood.\n3. Double-spin method to make PRP",
    "Take 40 μL of anticoagulated whole blood for the platelet count. Use filtered pipette tips to protect the pipette from blood contamination.\nCentrifuge the anticoagulated whole blood for 7 min at 450 x g and room temperature. This is the first spin to obtain layered blood samples. The upper layer is the plasma fraction, the middle layer is the thin buffy boat, and the bottom-most layer consists of red blood cells.\nUse a marker to make a line at 2 mm below the buffy coat.\nUse a 20 mL syringe with a long cannula to collect the plasma just to the 2 mm mark below the buffy coat. The yellow plasma with buffy coat contains platelets, leukocytes, and some erythrocytes. Collect the plasma from two tubes into a serum blood collection tube. Combine the contents of 4 tubes into 2 tubes for a total volume of 16 mL of plasma collected.\nCentrifuge the plasma with the buffy coat for 5 min at 1,600 x g and room temperature. This is the second spin. The supernatant of the layered blood samples is platelet-poor plasma (PPP).\nUse a 20 mL syringe with a long cannula to transfer the PPP to a 50 mL serum blood collection tube containing 1 mL of liquid as a measure. Platelets that accumulated in the thrombocyte pellet in the remaining 1 mL plasma were used as the PRP. The total volume of PRP collected was 2 mL.\nVortex the PRP in each tube and then pool into one tube (total 2 mL).\nTake 400 µL of the PRP for a platelet count.\nAliquot the PRP into several 1.5 mL tubes, containing approximately 400 µL in each tube. There is a total of four tubes. Approximately 500 µL PRP per tube is recommended.\n4. Prepare the activator",
    "Allow the 10 mL of blood without anticoagulant in a serum blood collection tube (step 2.3.3) to sit for 30 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the blood sample without anticoagulant for 8 min at 2,015 x g and room temperature in a laboratory centrifuge.\nCollect the supernatant as autologous thrombin.\nMix 0.5 M CaCl2 and autologous thrombin in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio as an activator. For example, 500 µL of CaCl2 was mixed with 500 µL of autologous thrombin. Make a total volume of 1 mL of the activator.\n5. PRP activation\nMix PRP and the activator in a 10:1 (v/v) ratio. Mix 400 µL of PRP with 40 µL of the activator in each 1.5 mL tube, and then incubate for 10 min at room temperature. This is activated PRP in a coagulated form.\n6. Storage of PRP\nCentrifuge activated PRP at 9,000 x g for 10 min in a 4 °C laboratory centrifuge.\nCollect the supernatant via pipette into a proper volume syringe.\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.22 µm membrane.\nStore the final PRP at −80 °C until use.\n7. Measurement of platelet concentrations and growth factor levels\nCount the platelet number in whole plasma and PRP using an automated hematology system (see Table of Materials).\nAnalyze concentrations of PDGF-BB, IGF, and EGF levels in whole plasma and activated PRP using commercially available ELISA kits (see Table of Materials).\n8. Cell proliferation assay\nIsolate hASCs using a previously described method18.\n\t\nSeed hASCs at a density of 1.0 x 104 cells/well in 24-well culture plates and incubate in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics overnight at 37 °C. Use hASCs from passages 7-9 in experiments.",
    "Replace cell media with serum-free DMEM. After 6 h, add PRP at the designated concentrations and incubate further for 48 h at 37 °C.\nIncubate with WST-8 solution (see Table of Materials) for 1 h at 37 °C. Read absorbance at 450 nm with a multi-well plate reader.\nConstruct a standard curve: Seed hASCs at densities of 0, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, 50,000, and 100,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS for 3 h. Read the absorbance at 450 nm after incubation with WST-8 solution for 1 h at 37 °C\n\t\nDraw the standard curve by plotting the number of cells versus the A450 nm.\nEstimate the number of hASCs from the absorbance based on the standard curve.\nSubscription Required.
