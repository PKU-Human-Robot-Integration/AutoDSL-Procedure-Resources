Use of a reagent similar to TRIzol will isolate cell debris and protein isolated to the acidic phenol-containing layer whereas the aqueous layer will contain the desired total RNA.\nResuspend RNA in ultrapure water to a concentration of 1 μg/μL. More than 100 μg RNA is needed to perform all downstream procedures.\nUse an RNA clean & concentrator kit to separate small (17–200 nt) and large (> 200 nt) RNA species from total RNA, following the manufacturer’s instruction (https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r1013_r1014_r1015_r1016_rna_clean_concentrator-5.pdf[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r1013_r1014_r1015_r1016_rna_clean_concentrator-5.pdf]). Briefly, add the appropriate volume of RNA Binding Buffer and ethanol to each sample. Transfer the mixture to a silica-based Zymo-Spin IC Column and centrifuge. Large RNAs are retained in the column and small RNAs are in the flow-through. Mix the flow-through with ethanol and load the mixture to a new Zymo-Spin IC Column and centrifuge. After several cleanup procedures with wash buffer, large and small RNAs can be eluted from the column, respectively.\nNote: The yield of small RNAs is usually less than one-fourth the yield of large RNAs.\nNote: Alternatively, other commercially available RNA extraction kit which can isolate small RNAs can be used such as miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN).",
    "Measure the concentration of both small RNAs and large RNAs. If the concentration of small RNAs is more than one-fourth that of large RNAs, it is likely that the small RNAs are contaminated by large RNAs. Proceed to step d i. for digestion. RNA can be stored at −80°C if it is not immediately subjected to digestion.\nIsolation of mRNAs This section describes procedures to isolate mRNA from total RNA for enzymatic digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis.\nPurify polyA+ mRNA from either large RNA or total RNA by using the Oligotex-dT30<Super> mRNA Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/mrna/oligotex-mrna-kits/[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/mrna/oligotex-mrna-kits/]). Briefly, mix RNA with Binding Buffer and Oligotex-dT30 magnetic beads. Heat-denature the RNA at 70°C for 3 min and then let stand at room temperature for 10 min to hybridize magnetic beads and mRNA. After centrifugation, remove the supernatant and suspend the magnetic particles with wash buffer, then transfer the mixture to a spin column and centrifuge the column. Repeat the washing step and polyA+ mRNA can be eluted from the column with RNase free dH2O.\nMeasure the concentration of mRNA, which should be approximately 1%–2% of the input concentration. Proceed to step d i. for digestion. RNA can be stored at −80°C if it is not directly subjected to digestion.\nCritical: Do not exceed the maximum capacities of either spin columns or Oligo-dT beads. If excessive RNA is applied, mRNA fraction will be easily contaminated with rRNA and tRNA.\nCritical: If contamination is suspected, it is recommended to perform agarose gel electrophoresis to check the purity. 1% TAE-agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and RNA denature with formamide can be used (as described below). Purified mRNA fraction can be subject to a second round of purification if contamination is confirmed.",
    "Isolation of 18s rRNA and 28s rRNA This section describes procedures to isolate 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA from large RNA or total RNA by agarose gel extraction.\nPrepare 1% TAE-agarose gel. Measure 1 g agarose. Mix agarose powder with 100 mL 1× TAE (2 mL RNAse-free 50× TAE + 98 mL ultrapure water) in a microwavable flask. Microwave for 1–3 min until the agarose is completely dissolved. After the complete melt of agarose, let agarose solution cool down to about 50°C. Add 3 μL ethidium bromide solution (10 mg/mL) and swirl. Pour the agarose solution into an assembled gel tray and cover the tray with saran wrap. Let the agarose gel solidify for about 60 min at room temperature.\nMix 10 μL RNase-free formamide with 10 μL total RNA or large RNA (≤5 μg RNA), and denature samples by heating at 60°C for 15 min followed by quick cooling on ice.\nAdd 3 μL of 10× loading buffer composed of 50% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, and 0.05% Bromophenol Blue.\nElectrophorese the entire sample (23 μL) with voltage 100V for 20 min (until the dye has migrated two-thirds of the length of the gel). RNA molecular size marker such as DynaMarker (BioDynamics Laboratory) can be used to confirm the size of rRNAs.\nVisualize the gel on a UV transilluminator and excise the 28S or 18S rRNA bands using razor blade. Usually RNA shows a 28S rRNA band at 4.5 kb and an 18S rRNA band at 1.9 kb, and small RNA species that possibly contained tRNA and other small RNA species. For a typical photograph of the gel, please refer to the Figure 4G of Ogawa et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].",
    "Extract 28S or 18S rRNAs from the excised gel slices by using the Zymoclean Gel RNA Recovery Kit. When using 5 μg RNA as starting materials, the yield of 28S rRNA should be >900 ng; the yield of 18S rRNA >450 ng. The ratio of 28S rRNA to 18S rRNA should be approximately 2:1. Proceed to step d i. for digestion. RNA can be stored at −80°C if it is not directly subject to digestion.\nRNA digestion\nMix up to 2.5 μg of each RNA sample with 2 μL nuclease P1 solution (0.5 U/μL), 0.5 μL bacteria alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and 2.5 μL of 200 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), and bring the total volume to 25 μL with ultrapure water.\nDigest RNA for 3 h at 37°C. For 2′-O-methylated nucleosides, which are resistant to RNase (Sproat et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), prolonged digestion (up to 24 h) can increase the yield. For a prolonged digestion, use a PCR instrument to prevent evaporation.\nAfter digestion, the digested samples should be immediately subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.\nExtracellular nucleosides from cultuerd cells This section describes extraction of metabolites containing modified nucleosides from supernatant of cell culture.\nThaw cell culture medium (if frozen) and gently vortex.\nTransfer 50 μL to a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 250 μL of pre-cooled extraction buffer 1 and gently vortex.\nRotate the mixture using a rotator for 15 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer 250 μL supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 100 μL ultrapure water to the sample and gently vortex.\nTransfer the mixture into a preconditioned ultrafiltration tube.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C.\nTransfer the entire ultrafiltrate volume into a new 1.5 mL tube and puncture the lid by using a 20-gauge needle.",

In this case, cover the punctured lid with parafilm to avoid contamination.\nIntracellular nucleosides from cultured cells This section describes procedures to extract intracellular metabolites containing modified nucleosides from HEK 293A cells plated in 6-well plates at a density of 400,000–500,000 cells per well.\nAspirate supernatant from cell culture dish.\nWash cells with ice-cold 5% mannitol or PBS, and completely aspirate the fluid.\nAdd 500 μL pre-chilled extraction buffer 1 and incubate for 10 min on ice.\nTransfer the liquid to a 1.5 mL tube and gently vortex.\nAdd 400 μL pre-chilled chloroform and vortex.\nAdd 200 μL pre-chilled ultrapure water and vortex.\nFurther mix the tube contents on a rotating mixer for 15 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer 350 μL of the top layer into a preconditioned ultrafiltration tube.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C.\nTransfer the entire ultrafiltrate volume into a new 1.5 mL tube and puncture the lid by using a 20-gauge needle.\nEvaporate samples by using a SpeedVac Vacuum Concentrator.\nDissolve each dried sample in 25 μL ultrapure water.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 10°C.\nTransfer 20 μL of the supernatant into a new tube suitable for LC-MS/MS measurement.\nNote: See section 4 in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” for the procedures of preconditioning ultrafiltration device.",
    "Note: Samples should preferably be subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis immediately after preparation, but samples can be kept frozen below –20°C after evaporation (step f xii.).
