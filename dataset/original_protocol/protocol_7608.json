    "Start of the cell culture Mammalian cells are cultured in DMEM-WT. Cryopreserved cells are used to initiate the culture.Quickly thaw the cryotube with cells in a warm water bath.Add thawed cells to a T75 flask with 10 mL of pre-warmed DMEM-WT medium.Incubate cells for one day at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.The next day, replace the medium with a fresh pre-warmed DMEM-WT medium.Continue cell passage 2–3 times to ensure the culture is healthy.The day before the initial experiment, ensure that the cell colony achieves approximately 70% confluency.High-pressure freezing 3D-printed chambers for high-pressure freezing:Mitotic cells are highly sensitive and must be handled with care to avoid any interference with the mitotic process. To avoid any difficulties associated with the cryo-preservation of mitotic cells, we developed custom-made chambers using 3D printing technology to plate cells on a solid support. We designed 3D-printed chambers for small sapphire discs (3 mm in diameter). These chambers are designed to provide a stable environment for mitotic cells for a short time period before high-pressure freezing. Due to their small volume, these chambers increase the number of cells attached to the sapphire discs, thus enabling one to collect cells of the desired mitotic stages (Figure 1; Files S1 and S2 for 3D models). The chamber can hold either one (single chamber) or up to four sapphire discs (quadruple chamber). Before use, the 3D-printed chambers are cleaned with ethanol and stored in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For a high-throughput approach, we suggest using the quadruple chambers as they allow for an increased yield of collected mitotic cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g001.jpgFigure 1.

(2021)].Place all sapphire discs into a glass beaker with the cleaning solution and gently mix it to ensure that all sapphire discs are separated. Let it incubate for approximately 5–10 min.After the incubation time, remove all sapphire discs with fine tweezers and rinse them in water two times by placing them in three dishes with ddH2O and then once in ethanol (70%, v/v). Store them in an Eppendorf tube in 70% ethanol until further use.",
    "Coating: after the cleanup, coat the sapphire discs with poly-L-lysine (0.1% in ddH2O, w/v) and fibronectin (1:10 dilution in 1× PBS, v/v).Initially, slowly air dry the sapphire discs by placing them for 1 h in a closed Petri dish to prevent any contamination. Then, coat the discs with poly-L-lysine by applying a single drop on each disc and leaving it for 5 min under a Petri dish.After that, absorb the excess solution with small pieces of filter paper and then place the sapphire discs on a heating plate set to 60 °C for 2 h.Remove sapphire discs from the heating plate and leave them to cool down in a closed Petri dish. It helps to place the discs on a slightly sticky rubber pad (e.g., a piece of table tennis rubber or rubber glove). This will prevent the discs from sticking to a pipette tip.Next, coat the sapphire discs with fibronectin. Prepare a fresh 10% (v/v) fibronectin solution by diluting fibronectin in 1× PBS and gently mixing the solution with a pipette (the solution should not be mixed extensively to prevent fibronectin aggregation).Finally, apply a drop of fibronectin solution on the sapphire discs and leave them at room temperature for 10 min. After that, remove the droplet with a pipette.Place the sapphire discs into custom-designed 3D-printed chambers and store them in the cell culture incubator until further use.Mitotic shake-off: our preferred method for enriching mitotic cells is called a mitotic shake-off (Guizetti et al., 2011; Ma and Poon, 2017). This method takes advantage of the fact that mitotic cells round up during mitosis and can be easily detached. This approach is preferred because it does not require the use of any drugs and reduces temperature stress that may influence mitosis processes (Rao and Engelberg, 1965; Figure 2B).",
    "Warm the culture medium to 37°C and store it open in the incubator to allow for saturation with 5% CO2.If possible, move all T75 flasks with cell cultures to the incubator located conveniently in the same room as your high-pressure freezer machine one day before the planned experiment. This will limit the number of environmental changes during the mitotic shake-off.To synchronize the cells, remove the cell culture flask from the incubator and hit the bottom of the flask vigorously on a solid surface (e.g., the bench).Remove the entire medium from the flask that contains primarily dead and already mitotic cells and wash it by adding 5 mL of pre-warmed medium.Discard the medium from the flask, add 10 mL of fresh pre-warmed medium, and immediately place it back in the incubator for the next 2 h.Repeat steps B3c–B3e for multiple flasks at approximately 15–20 min intervals if multiple rounds of cryo-immobilization are needed.After 2 h of incubation time, repeat step B3c for the first flask.This time, collect all the medium after the shake-off with mainly mitotic cells by aspirating it with a 15 mL pipette, and place it in a single 15 mL Falcon tube.Centrifuge collected medium gently at 0.2× g for 5 min at 37 °C. After this step, one should be able to see a small cell pellet at the bottom of the Falcon tube.Remove the entire supernatant. Be very careful to not remove the cell pellet.Resuspend the cells with 1 mL of pre-warmed medium, mix it, and immediately add it to the sapphire discs stored in the 3D-printed chamber (Figure 2C).",
    "Immediately move the 3D-printed chamber to a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 10–15 min (depending on the mitotic stage that should be analyzed and on the cell type) to allow for the reattachment of the cells to the sapphire discs.Sandwich assembly for high-pressure freezing and cryo-immobilization:For optimal cryo-immobilization and ultrastructural preservation of the samples, high-pressure freezing was applied (McDonald and Morphew, 1993). We used the Wohlwend Compact 03 high-pressure freezer (Figure 3; Video 1). However, any other high-pressure freezer could be used for cryo-immobilization of mammalian cells.Warm up a metal heating block to 37 °C.Remove the 3D-printed chamber with sapphire discs from the incubator and place it on a prewarmed metal block.Assemble each sandwich as shown in Figure 2D–2I. For this, place the sample holder under a stereomicroscope (Figure 2D).Place an aluminum planchette with the 40 μm cavity facing up inside the holder (Figure 2E) and fill the cavity with 1 μL of the pre-warmed DMEM high-pressure freezing solution (Figure 2F).Take one sapphire disc from the 3D-printed chamber and remove it slowly from the chamber.Dip the sapphire disc with cells in the pre-warmed DMEM high-pressure freezing solution (Figure 2G).Flip the sapphire disc so that the attached cells face downward. Then, gently place a sapphire disc on top of an aluminum carrier (Figure 2H). Check that air bubbles are not trapped between the aluminum carrier and the sapphire disc, as this will result in bad cryo-immobilization and eventually a breaking of the sapphire disc during freezing.Immediately proceed by closing the sample holder (Figure 2I) and freeze the specimen using the high-pressure freezing machine.Retrieve the sandwich of the aluminum planchette and the sapphire disc with the cryo-immobilized cells by opening the sample holder under liquid nitrogen.",
    "Press with a cold tweezer from the back and place the sapphire discs inside a cryo-tube. Be careful not to lift out the specimen from the liquid nitrogen bath during this procedure.Store all cryo-immobilized specimens under liquid nitrogen until further use.Freeze-substitution and embedding in Epon/Araldite After cryo-immobilization, it is necessary to perform freeze-substitution of the cells (McDonald and Müller-Reichert, 2002; Studer et al., 2008). This process allows for a slow exchange of cellular water for acetone and later for epoxy resin (Epon/Araldite). The addition of osmium tetroxide preserves the cellular ultrastructure for subsequent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Mollenhauer, 1964). This process also introduces heavy metals (osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate) to the sample, thus providing contrast for electron microscopy. We also add methylene blue to the freeze substitution cocktail to selectively stain chromosomes for imaging of the resin-embedded samples by light microscopy (Kiewisz et al., 2021). This step allows for the selection and staging of mitotic cells before TEM.Freeze-substitution of cryo-immobilized specimens:Prepare saturated methylene blue solution in acetone by adding 5 g of methylene blue powder into 60 mL of anhydrous, glass-distilled acetone at room temperature and mix it well.Store the solution in a 50 mL Falcon tube and leave it at room temperature for 2 h.After that time, store the solution at -80 °C overnight.After removing the solution from the -80 °C freezer, quickly filter the dye-saturated acetone solution with a syringe filter.Prepare a freeze-solution cocktail by adding 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide and 0.1% (w/v) uranyl acetate to the dye-saturated acetone. Store 1 mL aliquots of this freeze-substitution solution in 2 mL cryo-vials in liquid nitrogen until further use.Open the high-pressure frozen sandwiches under liquid nitrogen and transfer the sapphire discs to the cryo-vials containing the AFS cocktail.Perform freeze-substitution in an automated freeze-substitution machine.",
    "Keep samples at -90 °C for 1 h, before warming up to -30 °C with increments of 5 °C/h. Then, keep samples at -30 °C for 5 h, and again warm up to 0 °C in steps of 5 °C/h. At 0 °C, remove the sapphire discs from the cocktail (samples should not remain at 0 °C for more than one hour to avoid overstaining).Infiltration with Epon/Araldite (resin) and specimen embedding:Wash the samples one time with pure anhydrous acetone at room temperature inside the cryo-vials (this will warm up a sample to room temperature in one rinse step) and then transfer the sapphire discs to a glass Petri dish filled with anhydrous acetone.Place the Petri dish under a binocular microscope and arrange each sapphire disc with cells facing up. To determine the side of the disc with the attached cryo-immobilized cells, the sapphire discs are inspected for cellular contents under the dissection microscope while remaining immersed in acetone.Transfer each sapphire disc to round flow-through rings within a plastic reagent bath (Leica), designed for 3 mm sapphire discs, with the cells facing up. Pre-fill the molds to a low level already with a 1:3 (v/v) resin/acetone mixture to prevent the sapphire discs from drying out. After all sapphire discs have been transferred to the plastic molds, check again under a dissection scope that all are properly placed in the indentations at the bottom of the molds. Then, fill up the mold to at least three-quarters with the acetone/resin mixture.Infiltrate the samples with Epon/Araldite resin at room temperature with increasing concentrations of resin/acetone (v/v). Start with 1:3, then 1:1, and then 3:1 (1 h for each step).",
    "The exchange of the resin solutions should be performed very slowly to prevent the detachment and loss of cells from the surface of the sapphire discs and to avoid movement of the discs.As a final step, fill the block molds with pure Epon/Araldite resin, and incubate the samples at room temperature overnight. It is important to completely fill the molds to avoid a meniscus of the resin within the individual mold subunits. This will cause a lensing effect of the transmitted light in the light microscope that is used to screen the blocks for cells of interest during the screening step.Polymerize samples at 60 °C for at least 48 h in an oven.Release of resin-embedded cells from sapphire discs:Cut the plastic molds open with a scalpel or a mechanical multitool (Dremel Fortiflex). Break the sample blocks out of the molds using a desmotome VT1 (a tool with a sharp arrow-shaped tip) as a chisel and a hammer. Under an ultramicrotome, carefully remove the resin around and on top of the sapphire discs using a single-edge razor blade. This needs to be done with great care to avoid breakage of the sapphire disc edges (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g004.jpgFigure 4. Removal of a sapphire disc from the Epon/Araldite block after resin polymerization. (A) Resin block with attached sapphire disc locked in self-locking forceps and dipped into liquid nitrogen. Only the sapphire disc should be submerged in liquid nitrogen for a few seconds. (B) Using a heating block to remove the sapphire disc from the cold resin block. After a few seconds, when the ice is starting to form on the surface of the cold sapphire disc, the edge of the sapphire disc is pressed to the heated razor blade of the heating block.",
    "This will leave the embedded cells (not shown here) in the resin. This figure was reproduced with permission from the book chapter: “High-throughput screening of mitotic mammalian cells for electron microscopy using classic histological dyes”, Methods in Cell Biology (162), 151–170 (2021), Copyright Elsevier [Kiewisz et al. (2021)].Lock each sample in the self-locking straight forceps (artery clamp). Submerge only the top part of the resin block containing the sapphire disc into liquid nitrogen for a few seconds (Figure 4A). Avoid submerging the block too deep into the liquid nitrogen as this could break the resin block.Remove the discs by gently pressing the edge of the discs to a heated razor blade (Figure 4B). The sapphire discs should self-release from the surface of the specimen without using extensive force, due to the different shrinkage and expansion of the resin and the sapphire disc exposure to the extreme temperature. If this method fails after 2–3 attempts of dipping, go back to step C3a and make sure that the resin from the sides of the sapphire discs is removed completely. This should allow a smooth removal of the sapphire disc from the resin block.Pre-screening of samples and serial-sectioning of a selected specimen Cells are located at the surface of the resin blocks (Kiewisz et al., 2021). Therefore, it is easy to pre-screen cells for subsequent ultramicrotomy. Although a standard light microscope can be used for this purpose, rare stages like prometaphase or early anaphase are hard to spot with certainty when relying solely on the different refractive indices within the resin. A fluorescence microscopy approach can be applied to obtain high-resolution image stacks that allow for identifying the desired stages. To achieve this, methylene blue or other histological dyes (Kiewisz et al., 2021) are added during freeze-substitution to specifically stain the chromosomes.",
    "This approach enables the screening of cells of interest before sectioning the specimens.Using an upright transmitted light microscope, screen the surface of the resin block to locate cells that are rounded and show any mitotic hallmarks, e.g., condensed chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate. Image the area of interest with a microscope camera or through the eyepiece with a smartphone. This step is necessary as the transmitted light microscope can only be used to observe cells that are relatively shallow.For a better relocation of cells of interest, it is advised to image the area at different magnifications (Figure 5B and 5C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g005.jpgFigure 5.

    "(2021)].Position a resin block with the specimen side facing the objective of a confocal microscope (such as the Leica SP5 or Leica SP8 Stellaris). It is advised to use an inverted microscope for this and place the resin block on top of a 24 mm × 60 mm coverslip. The block should be placed on the glass slide with the cells facing down and submerged in a droplet of water (Figure 5A). We found that using a 594 nm excitation laser and detecting the emitted light in the range of 620–730 nm yields the best results for methylene blue as a dye. Make sure to relocate areas of interest by identifying landmarks such as the distribution pattern of the embedded cells or any distinctive features (e.g., dirt).Collect images of the putative areas of interest and validate if the areas contain the cells of interest (Figure 5D–5E) by investigating the stage of the selected cells. At this point, damaged cells can be excluded from further processing.Re-localize a region of interest using either an upright brightfield microscope or the microscope attached to the ultramicrotome (Figure 6A–6C).Trim resin block surface for serial sectioning. We use razor blades for this step. Start with a rather large surface area (Figure 6D; Video 2).Again, re-localize the region of interest using an upright brightfield microscope (Figure 6E–6G).Repeat steps D6–D7 until the sample has been trimmed to the appropriate size (Figure 5F and Figure 6H).On an ultramicrotome, equipped with a diamond knife, overfill the boat of the diamond knife with water.Add 1–3 droplets of 70% ethanol.Remove some water from the boat with a syringe until a bright reflection is visible at the edge of the diamond.Move the trimmed specimen very carefully to the edge of the knife.Cut 300 nm sections with a speed of 1.6 mm/s.",
    "The cutting speed can vary by ± 0.3 mm/s, depending on the room temperature and humidity as well as the polymerization stage of the sample (Figure 6I–6J).Move ribbons of sections with hair glued to the tip of a toothpick. We prefer to use Dalmatian dog hairs for this procedure. However, any other non-sticky type of hair can be used for this.Collect ribbons of sections on Formvar-coated copper slot grids (Figure 6K).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g006.jpgFigure 6.

    "At this stage, it is crucial to keep the correct sequence of the ribbons. (K) Same view as given in J to illustrate how a single ribbon is collected on a Formvar-coated copper slot grid (see also Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Video tutorial showing how to perform serial-section ultramicrotomy. Trimming of a resin block containing a selected cell is achieved by using a razor blade. This is followed by serial sectioning of the trimmed area using a diamond knife. This video showing serial sectioning is speeded up. This video corresponds to Figure 6.Post-stain sections with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and image sections by using a TEM (Figure 5G).Add fiducial markers to the sections by immersing them into a droplet of colloidal gold (Ø 20 nm) solution for 1 min. Then, blot excessive fluid with filter paper and air dry the grid for 1 min. Wash grids for 1 min in double-distilled water and let them air dry before storing them in a grid box.Inspect the serial sections on the grids by using a TEM operated at 80 kV. This process allows to inspect and validate the selected cells by overlaying the electron micrograph with the fluorescence image previously taken (see step D3; Figure 5G–5I).After this control step, image-select cells with a TEM operated at 300 kV and equipped with a tilting stage (Mastronarde, 1997) with SerialEM software. For a detailed tutorial for acquiring tilt series tomography with this software, we refer to the online tutorial (https://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/[href=https://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/]).Load the grid with the serial sections into a tomography sample holder and insert it into the TEM.Open SerialEM, create a new map file, and mark the position of a cell of interest on each section on the grid.",
    "Make sure to adjust the Eucentric height at all positions as this will speed up the acquisition process.Using the SerialEM pre-exposure feature, expose each selected position on each section to 2,000 e-/Å2 at a 60° tilt angle for 5 min. This baking process allows the resin section to shrink to a stable level before the image acquisition is started.Set up serial acquisition in SerialEM to acquire a tilt series for each region at ± 60° with 1° increments at 4,700× magnification (a-axis tilt series).After all acquisitions are finished, rotate the grid by 90° and repeat steps D19b and D19d to record the b-axis tilt series.Automatic reconstruction of electron tomogram and microtubule segmentation Following the tomographic acquisition, each tilt series file has to be reconstructed to obtain an in-silico 3D volume. This process can be time consuming, which is why we chose to fully automate this process. Tomogram processing is carried out with the IMOD software package. The IMOD software package is a set of image processing, modeling, and display programs for tomographic reconstruction and 3D reconstruction of EM serial sections. Automation scripts and instructions for an automatic tomographic reconstruction with IMOD are available on GitHub (https://github.com/RRobert92/Assit_Automatic_Tomogram_Flattening_IMOD[href=https://github.com/RRobert92/Assit_Automatic_Tomogram_Flattening_IMOD]). For full documentation and a tutorial on how to use IMOD, we refer the reader to the IMOD tutorial (https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/etomoTutorial.html[href=https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/etomoTutorial.html]).Automatic tomogram reconstruction:To start an automatic tomogram reconstruction, open the etomo package from the IMOD software and follow step-by-step instructions from File S3.Open the batch processing mode.Load the automatic reconstruction setting available on GitHub (https://github.com/RRobert92/Assit_Automatic_Tomogram_Flattening_IMOD/blob/main/Kiewisz_Imod_batch_reconstruction.adoc[href=https://github.com/RRobert92/Assit_Automatic_Tomogram_Flattening_IMOD/blob/main/Kiewisz_Imod_batch_reconstruction.adoc]).Select raw data files (tilt series). Each pair of tomogram files (a- and b-axis) should be stored in a separate folder.Choose a device (CPU, GPU, or CPU + GPU) on which the tomogram will be processed.After pressing Run, the tomographic reconstructions will be calculated and stored on the hard drive.",
    "If the message shows completed, proceed to step E1g. If the message shows failed, one needs to check the step on which the algorithm aborted the reconstruction and fix it manually.Post-process reconstructed tomograms by trimming the histogram and rotating the volume around the x-axis.Run an automatic flattening tool from GitHub (https://github.com/Robert92/Assit_Automatic_Tomogram_Flattening_IMOD/blob/main/AAFT.bat[href=https://github.com/Robert92/Assit_Automatic_Tomogram_Flattening_IMOD/blob/main/AAFT.bat]) to flatten each tomogram.Use the new stack command from IMOD in the terminal to manually remove z-planes from the 3D stack that do not contain image information.Semi-automatic microtubule segmentation: as previously published (Redemann et al., 2014), microtubules are automatically segmented using the commercial Amira or AmiraZIBEdition software package. The Amira software package is a set of image processing and visualization tools that allows for precise and intuitive image segmentation of big data. A tutorial of this process is shown in Figure 7 and File S4. For a full tutorial on the filament segmentation see https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/MSD/Product-Guides/user-guide-amira-software.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/MSD/Product-Guides/user-guide-amira-software.pdf].imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g007.jpgFigure 7.

The red box indicates all traced microtubule filaments stored in .am Amira spatial graph file format.Load reconstructed tomogram volume into the Amira software (Figure 7).Select the Cylinder Correlation tool (Figure 7A, red box 1) and select the setting as shown in Figure 7A (red box 2).Press the green button Apply to start the calculation (Figure 7A, red box 3).After the calculation is finished, two new files are produced (Figure 7B).Select the Trace Correlation Lines tool. Then, select the two new files as inputs and use the setting as shown in Figure 7B (red box 1–2).Press the green button Apply to start the calculation (Figure 7B, red box 3). At the end of the calculation, a new file will be created called a spatial graph containing the predicted microtubule tracks (Figure 7C). Save the file locally on the hard drive.Be aware that Amira allows the generation of so-called Recipes. Within these Recipes, one could save the configuration of certain modules like Cylinder Correlation and Trace Correlation Lines. Therefore, one has only to apply the recipe to the raw tomogram to obtain the spatial graph as a resulting output, which saves time and prevents human errors in configuring the parameters of the modules. We recommend using the properly configured Recipes when segmenting microtubules if the tomogram quality is not strongly varying.Correction of microtubule tracks predicted with the Amira software. During the prediction of microtubule tracks from electron tomograms, several errors can occur as false-positive or false-negative microtubule tracks. This correction needs to be done manually and therefore can take up to several hours or a full working day per single tomogram (Figure 8A–8B). Each acquired tomogram needs to be corrected.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g008.jpgFigure 8.",

(B) Bar plot showing the segmentation time per entire data set (n = 14). Each data set is composed of 8–37 tomograms.For correction, open the filament tab in the Amira software (Figure 9, red box).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g009.jpgFigure 9. Manual correction of semi-automatically segmented microtubules using the AmiraZIBEdition software. GUI showing an overview of the filament editor tool (red box, top). The orange box indicates the different tools that can be used to correct the segmentation, the blue box shows visualization parameters, and the pink box indicates the stepping tool used to step through all individual microtubules.In an open new window, one can now see, side-by-side, the tomogram and all predicted microtubule tracks.On the top of the open window (Figure 9, orange box), one can see all the editing tools. By highlighting with the mouse cursor, one can read the descriptions and the keyboard shortcuts associated with them.On the top-left side of the open window (Figure 9, blue box), one can see the visualization setting of the spatial graph that controls the thickness of displayed lines.On the bottom-right side of the open window (Figure 9, magenta box), one can see the editing tool where one can switch between segmented microtubules.Correct the spatial graph by removing all false-positive segments and adding the missing (false-negative) microtubule tracks.Remove the false-positive microtubules (Figure 10A) by selecting them in the segment box menu (Figure 9, magenta box) and pressing D (for delete) on the keyboard.",
    "To add a new microtubule track, firstly press C and then T, and select the center of the microtubule by clicking on it within the left image viewer. This will create the first node. To extend the newly created microtubule track, press N, and while pressing the control key, continue to select and click in the center of the microtubule to draw a line until reaching the end of it.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g010.jpgFigure 10. Illustration of microtubule tracing correction using the AmiraZIBEdition software package as shown in Figure 9. (A) Example of false-positive filament annotation caused by the application of the semi-automatic segmentation approach. The left panel shows a cross-section view of a tomogram with selected microtubules highlighted in red and white arrow. The right panel shows an overview of all traced microtubules with selected microtubules highlighted in red and white arrow. (B) View from the AmiraZIBEdition software as shown in A. Example of a correctly tracked microtubule. (C) View from the AmiraZIBEdition software as shown in A. Example of manually and fully corrected filament annotation.Check if the microtubule track is correct and if the ends of the segment are positioned at the ends of the microtubule in the image. One can do that by moving through the Z-planes with the mouse wheel up and down.If the selected microtubule track looks correct, one can simply skip to the next one (Figure 10B) until all microtubules have been corrected and all false positive segmentations have been deleted (Figure 10C).Stitching of segmented serial sections. The final step of microtubule segmentation is the stitching of all serial sections together to one tomographic volume with all microtubules stitched together to one spatial graph. For this, we used a research version of Amira called AmiraZIBEdition comprising the SerialSectionStack tool (Lindow et al., 2021).",
    "This tool is also available on GitHub (https://github.com/zibamira/SerialSectionAligner[href=https://github.com/zibamira/SerialSectionAligner] or https://www.zib.de/software/serial-section-aligner[href=https://www.zib.de/software/serial-section-aligner]) as an extension for Amira v2020.3 or higher.Open Amira with the installed extension or AmiraZIBEdition and create the SerialSectionStack tool (Figure 11A, red box 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g011.jpgFigure 11. Stitching of serial sections by using the AmiraZIBEdition SerialSectionStack. (A) The main view of the AmiraZIBEdition software GUI. The red box number 1 indicates the data management window with the open SerialSectionStack tool. The red box number 2 indicates the button used to load all serial section data for stitching. (B) GUI view as shown in A. Loaded datasets in the correct order are indicated in the red box. (C) View of AmiraZIBEdition software GUI showing open SerialSectionAligner tool setting window. The left panel shows the zoomed area as shown in the blue box in the right panel. The numbered red boxes show the sequence of tasks that have to be done to initialize the SerialSectionAligner tool: No. 1, Advanced button; No. 2, Switch to matching mode; No. 3, Switch slice quality to high and the warping quality to the maximum; and No. 4, Compute the alignment of the transformation matrix for the first section by pressing Compute. The green box shows the alignment view window, allowing the user to observe and improve the alignment. (D) To compute the alignment transformation matrix for the next section, the user needs to switch to the next border using the buttons indicated in the red box.From the project tab (bottom left corner, Figure 11A, red box 2) select add files and select all tomographic volumes with corresponding spatial graph fields. The files should be named with consecutive numbering e.g., Tomogram_1.am, Tomogram_sg_1.am; Tomogram_2.am, Tomogram_sg_2.am (Figure 11B, red box), and they should be all in the same folder.",
    "With the right mouse button, press the SerialSectionStack tool and open the SerialSectionAligner tool. This will update the properties tab view (Figure 11C, right panel, green box).Initialize this tool by pressing Advanced (Figure 11C, red box 1) and switch to matching mode (Figure 11C, red box 2). Enable a high-quality display for tomographic slices and increase the warping quality to the maximum (Figure 11C, red box 3).Next, press compute (Figure 11C, red box 4). This will calculate the alignment transformation matrix for the first section based on matching microtubules from the first and the second section. When finished, the computation view window (Figure 11C, right panel, green box) will update to show the aligned two consecutive sections. Repeat this step a few times until the histograms (shown in the bottom right corner) do not change anymore.Repeat step E4e for each section by switching to the next section interface (Figure 11D, red box) and pressing compute.When the computation of the alignment matrix for all sections based on microtubule continuity between sections is finished, press create at the bottom of the properties view. One can optionally deselect crop to filament. This option, when enabled, allows the tool to crop tomogram volume to the spatial graph size and produce a smaller tomogram volume (Figure 12A).At the end of the calculation, a user obtains two files (Figure 12B, red box 1–2): the Amira spatial graph with all stitched microtubules and a 3D volume of the stitched serial sections (Figure 12C–12D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4849/bioprotoc-13-20-4849-g012.jpgFigure 12. Correction of stitched microtubules from all serial sections using AmiraZIBEdition SerialSectionStack. (A) After repeating the computation for all borders in between sections (see Figure 11D), the user can compute the stacked volume for all aligned sections using the computed alignment transformation matrix by pressing Create (red box).",
    "(B) At the end of the step shown in A, two new files are generated. The stitch tomogram volume (red box number 1) and corresponding file with all stitched microtubules (red box number 2). The file as indicated by the red button is the Amira Spatial Graph file that contains tracks for microtubules stitched from all serial sections. (C) View from AmiraZIBEdition as shown in A, indicating visualization setting. (D) View from AmiraZIBEdition showing a tomographic slice and all stitched microtubules using the setting as shown in C.As an important final step, check and correct each stitched microtubule. For this, repeat step E3 for the generated stitched files."
