    "1. Cell Harvesting\nObtain MD-MBA-231 cells from the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Detach cells from tissue culture plate using 0.5% Trypsin-EDTA solution. Use 1 ml of Trypsin-EDTA solution for cell cultured in a T25 flask.\nPellet cells in a 15 ml conical tube by centrifugation at 200 × g for 4 min, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend cells in 5 ml of culture media.\nCount cell density, ρ, using a hemocytometer.\n\tNote: To prepare the cell-seeded inner gel, the cell suspension will later on be diluted 10× to reach the final cell seeding density. Therefore, 10× concentrated cell suspension is required.\nCalculate the volume of medium required to achieve a 10× cell concentration:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52735/52735eq1.jpg\n\tNote: A final cell seeding density, cfinal, of around 2 × 106 cells/ml is recommended for MD-MBA-231 cells and is used in this protocol. Other seeding densities can also be explored for other cell types.\nPellet cells one more time in a 15 ml conical tube by centrifugation at 200 × g for 4 min, and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in the required amount (Vmedium calculated in step 1.3) of serum-free cell culture medium thoroughly to minimize cell clumping.\n\tNote: Phenol red is auto-fluorescent, and can interfere with fluorescence/reflectance imaging. Use of phenol red-free medium may be considered to achieve best image quality.\n2. Preparation of Collagen Solutions\nObtain the stock collagen solution, 10× PBS buffer, Milli-Q H2O, 0.1 M NaOH, and several microcentrifuge tubes. Keep all on ice to prevent premature collagen polymerization, and maintain sterile condition.\nEquilibrate a sterile glass-bottom dish by pre-warming it in the 37 °C incubator.\n\tNote: All volumes in this protocol have been optimized for a glass-bottom dish with 12 mm well. If other dish type is used, adjust the volumes correspondingly.",
    "Calculate the required volume needed to prepare 50 µl of 2.4 mg/ml collagen solution for the inner gel (solution I) based on the collagen stock concentration.\n\tNote: Other collagen concentrations for the inner gel can also be used.\nIn a sterile environment (typically a biosafety hood), slowly add 5 µl of 10× PBS buffer to the required amount of collagen stock solution (calculated in step 2.3) with gentle swirling. Take care to avoid air bubble formation.\nAdjust the pH of the mixture to 7.4 using 0.1 M NaOH using calibrated pH-meter. As a rough guide, use about 5 µl to bring the pH close to 7.4 (the amount varies depending on the stock concentration and pH).\n\tNote: Note that the volumes involved in this step is too small for the use of standard pH meter. Use one of the following tricks:\n\t\nPrepare collagen solutions for multiple samples. Adjust the pH in bulk using standard pH meter and distribute the collagen solutions across the samples.\nAlternatively, adjust the pH of a collagen solution in larger volume (i.e., volume that allow the use of standard pH meter). Note the amount of NaOH needed to bring the pH to the final pH. Scale down the volumes and use the appropriate amount of NaOH for the experiment. Confirm the pH value using Litmus paper.\nOtherwise, use a micro pH electrode to more accurately adjust the pH of small quantities.\nBring the solution to a volume of 45 µl using H2O. Perform all steps on ice to prevent premature collagen polymerization.\n3. Formation of Concentric Gel Culture\nTake the pre-warmed glass-bottom dish (see step 2.2) from the incubator.",
    "Add 5 µl of the 10× concentrated cell suspension (prepared in step 1.5) to solution I. Resuspend thoroughly. Take care to avoid air bubble formation. The mixture now has a volume of 50 µl and contains the final collagen concentration (2.4 mg/ml) and cell density (cfinal = 2 × 106 cells/ml).\nAdd 20 µl of the cell-containing solution I slowly to the center of the well, so that it forms a dome-shaped droplet (Figure 1A). Take care to avoid bubble formation at this step. If a bubble forms, carefully but quickly try to either rupture it or suck it out using a pipette tip. Gently place the dish back in the incubator to let the inner gel polymerize for 45 min.\nPrepare solution O (for the outer, acellular collagen gel) about 15 min before the end of this incubation step.\n\tNote: The outer gel condition can be varied in terms of collagen concentration and polymerization pH to obtain networks with different microstructures10. In this protocol, focus on a 1.5 – 4.0 mg/ml collagen gel polymerized at a pH of 7.4.\n\t\nBased on the collagen stock concentration, calculate the required volume needed to prepare 200 µl of collagen solution O at the final concentration.\nAdd 20 µl of 10× PBS buffer slowly to the required amount of collagen stock solution (calculated in step 3.4) with gentle swirling. Adjust the pH of the mixture to the final pH using 0.1 M NaOH with the use of calibrated pH-meter. See note to step 2.5 regarding pH adjustment.\nBring the solution to a final volume of 200 µl using H2O. Perform all steps on ice to prevent premature collagen polymerization.",
    "Take the dish from the incubator after 45 min polymerization of the inner gel (see step 3.3). Gently add 180 µl of solution O on top of the inner gel, so that the solution completely covers the inner gel and fills up the well (Figure 1B).\n\t\nPerform this step carefully without stirring the solution, which can lead to non-uniform fiber orientations in the outer gel. Take care to avoid touching the inner gel with a pipette tip, and to avoid the formation of bubbles or air pockets. If a bubble forms, carefully but quickly try to either rupture it or suck it out using a pipette tip. Gently place the dish back in the incubator to let the outer gel polymerize.\nTake the dish from the incubator after 45 min of polymerization. The gel should already be fairly solidified at this point, although it can still detach from the bottom surface if handled roughly.\n\t\nGently pour 2 ml of warmed cell culture medium to the dish (Figure 1C). Make sure that the gel is completely submerged in the medium. Refresh the medium every 2 – 3 days throughout the duration of culture.\n4. Live-cell Imaging\nPerform imaging using an inverted confocal microscope equipped with long-term live-cell imaging capability. Include a built-in incubation chamber with a temperature (37 °C) and CO2 (5%) control. Switch on the microscope and warm up the stage at least 1 hr before starting the experiment.\n\tNote: Use objective lens with long working distance to optimize the observation and localization of cells in the 3D gels.",
    "Incubate the gel in medium containing 5 µl of fluorescent cell tracker dye for 30 min to allow accurate localization of the cells in the 3D system. Subsequently, remove unbound dye by washing three times with 1× PBS. Afterwards, add cell culture medium to the dish.\nTake the dish from the incubator and place it on the microscope stage (Figure 1D).\n\tNote: Live cell imaging can start in principle right after the polymerization of the outer gel. However at this point, the cells in the inner gel have not spread yet. To examine the migration of the first cells that have invaded the outer gel, live-cell imaging can start 24 hr (depending on the cell type) after the initiation of culture. As a rough guide, around 12 - 14 days of culture are needed for most of the cells in the inner gel to enter the outer gel.\nSelect Volumes of View (VoV’s) in regions in the outer gel surrounding the inner gel. After 24 hr of incubation, the cell population will have spread, crossed the interface between the inner and outer gels, and started to invade the outer gel.\n\t\nFor the VoV’s, include the gel regions immediately next to the gel interface, intermediate regions, and regions close to the outskirt of the outer gel7. Exclude regions closer than 50 µm from the bottom and side surfaces, as well as from the top of the gel, to avoid possible edge effects. Each VoV typically measures 647 × 647 × 100 µm3 (in x, y, and z directions, respectively), with 5 µm interval in the z-stack.\nEnsure imaging modes, channels/filters, exposure times, and image resolutions are correctly selected. For label-free imaging of the collagen network, use confocal reflectance microscopy simultaneously during the time-lapse live-cell imaging.",
    "Take sample images, plot the intensity histograms, and adjust the gains and offsets to observe sufficient signal and avoid saturation by ensuring that the histogram lies between zero and the maximum intensity. Do not change these settings any more throughout the duration of the experiment.\nTake time-lapse images of the selected VoV’s, with a time interval, Δt, of 10 min for 8 hrs (or longer if necessary).\n5. Cell Tracking and Data Analysis\nCarry out quantitative image post-processing from the z-stack images using appropriate image processing software.\n\t\nSegment the time-lapse images to automatically select the 3D cell positions in (x,y,z,t).\nFor every frame, manually check the localization accuracy and remove false positives due to cell debris and cellular protrusions that may have been mistaken for cells. Remove proliferative cells from the analysis and split overlapping or connected cells into distinct objects.\nGenerate 3D time-lapse cell tracks from the cell coordinates (x,y,z,t) obtained in the previous step by linking the location of each cell in the time sequence.\nEliminate random and system noise by removing tracks shorter than a threshold track length (typically 20 min).\nCorrect for sample drift by subtracting the overall net displacements from the tracks if necessary.\nCalculate cell displacement, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52735/52735eq2.jpg, and cell migration distance, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52735/52735eq3.jpg, from the observed cell trajectories, where is a vector representing the 3D location of a cell at time and is the total number of time points.\n\t\nCalculate cell speed as S = d/(n • Δt), where Δt is the time interval between frames. Calculate cell migration directionality (or persistence) using P = Δd/d. This simple measure of persistence implies that for P = 0 the net displacement is zero and for P = 1 the trajectory is a straight directional line.\nSubscription Required.
