    "1. Designing and Preparing the Peptides\nAcquire the sequence of the fusion protein of interest from a public database such as NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or the virus pathogen database (https://www.viprbrc.org). Choose the protease recognition site preceding the fusion peptide and include 2-3 amino acids upstream and downstream of this sequence.\nWhen ordering the peptides, modify them with the FRET pair 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl acetyl (MCA) at the N-terminus and N-2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) at the C-terminus.\n\tNOTE: Several suppliers provide these modifications. Price and delivery time depend on the supplier of choice. However, alternative modifications exist which vary in sensitivity and require adjustments of the plate reader in terms of wavelengths.\nResuspend the peptide according to the manufacturers recommendations by gently pipetting up and down. For example, resuspend peptides in 70% ethanol to the final concentration of 1 mM.\nOptionally, add the tube containing the peptide and the solvent into a sonication bath until it is fully resuspended if the peptide does not resuspend very well by pipetting.\nAliquot the peptide into light dampening or resistant tubes to protect the peptide from bleaching. Keep aliquot sizes small to avoid multiple freeze/thaw cycles (e.g., 100 µL). Store aliquots at -20° C.\n2. Preparing the Fluorescence Plate Reader\nTurn on the plate reader and wait until the self-test is finished.\nOpen the operating software on the attached computer and make sure it is connected with the plate reader.\nOpen the temperature setting and set to 30 °C (or the required temperature for optimal performance for the protease).\nClick on Control | Instrument Setup to set up the experiment.\nChoose Kinetic.\nSelect Fluorescence.\nEnter Excitation and Emission wavelengths: 330 nm and 390 nm respectively.\nUnselect Auto Cut-off.\nSelect Medium, normal sensitivity.\nChoose a runtime of 1 h for the assay and select one measurement every 60 s.",
    "Set 5 s mixing before first measurement and 3 s before each measurement\nSelect wells to read and start the assay.\n3. Preparing the Assay\nPrepare the assay buffer by calculating the appropriate quantities for each ingredient and adding it. For furin, make buffer consisting of 100 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% Triton X-100. For trypsin, use standard phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution.\n\tNOTE: Volumes of 10 mL or less are sufficient. Depending on the protease(s) used in the assay the buffer varies.\nChill the buffer on ice.\nPlace the assay plate on ice with a thin metal plate underneath to support cooling and stability. Use a solid black polystyrene 96-well plate with a flat bottom and non-treated.\n\tNOTE: It is essential to use black plates to prevent fluorescent \"leakage\" from adjacent wells.\nCalculate the appropriate amount of protease to add for each reaction based on previous publications or experimental data. For furin, use 1 unit per reaction which corresponds to 0.5 µL. For trypsin, use 0.5 µL of 160 nM TPCK trypsin.\nPer sample prepare 3 technical replicates per assay in a total volume of 100 µL per sample.\n\tNOTE: It was experimentally evaluated that it does not make a difference whether the pipetting is carried out under normal light conditions or dimmed light. However, the peptides should not be exposed to light for an extended period of time.\nPipette the appropriate amount of assay buffer (94.5 µL as described under Step 3.1) into each well.\nAdd the protease to each well. For both, furin and TPCK trypsin, use 0.5 µL per sample. To 6 wells (3 wells for a blank control and 3 wells for a peptide control), add 0.5 µL buffer instead of the respective protease.",
    "Add the peptide to a final concentration of 50 µM to each well except the blank control. In this case, pipette 5 µL peptide prepared as described under Step 1.3. Add 5 µL of buffer to the blank control instead of peptide.\n\tNOTE: Several concentrations of the peptide were initially tested with the described enzyme concentrations to ensure that the enzymes were saturated.\nInsert the plate into the fluorescence plate reader and click start.\n4. Data Analysis\nSave the experiment file.\nClick on Export and export the file as a .txt.\nImport the .txt file into a spreadsheet.\nFor each technical replicate per sample, create a graph plotting the relative fluorescent units (RFU) on the y-axis against the time on the x-axis (Supplemental Figure 1).\nSelect the data range where the graph is in a linear range and the closest to the start of the fluorescence increase.\nPlot the selected data on a second graph and add a linear trendline.\nSelect in the trendline options Display equation on chart. The equation will show the Vmax.\nCalculate the average Vmax for each sample from the 3 technical replicates.\nRepeat the experiment twice more to obtain 3 biological replicates.\nCalculate the standard deviation based on the data from 3 independent biological replicates."
