    "An overview of procedures can be seen in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4408/bioprotoc-12-09-4408-g001.jpgFigure 1. An overview of procedures of DNA extraction protocol Sample collection and DNA extraction1. Collect samples and store them at -80°C, or immediately perform DNA extraction using the protocol described previously (Guo et al., 2022).2. Digest genomic DNA with RNase.Normally, 1 μL of RNase is added to each DNA sample, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min.3. Evaluate the quality of DNA.The quality of genomic DNA should be evaluated by running gel electrophoresis, and using a Qubit fluorometer or UV spectrophotometer. A large, clear, intact band on top indicates the presence of high quality genomic DNA. In addition to high-quality DNA, a successful bisulfite conversion reaction requires a quantity of DNA suggested by the commercial kit being used.Primer designPrimers can be designed using a variety of online tools, such as Bisulfite Primer Seeker (https://www.zymoresearch.com/pages/bisulfite-primer-seeker[href=https://www.zymoresearch.com/pages/bisulfite-primer-seeker]).Note: It is recommended that primers be designed before the bisulfite treatment steps. Primers for an internal control gene should also be designed. Ideally, this should be a gene that has already been determined to be entirely or largely unmethylated. Bisulfite conversionReaders should follow the instructions from the commercial kit being used for bisulfite conversion.Note: Converted DNA can be stable at 4°C or -20°C for a short period of time, but it is best to check the manual from the kit you are using. It is recommended to PCR-amplify the region of interest immediately after the conversion is done to ensure the best results. TA cloning of the PCR ampliconsTypical cloning PCR conditions are (Table 1):Table 1.

Therefore, it is necessary to use the appropriate DNA polymerase to ensure high fidelity, low bias, and sufficient yield. We recommend EpiMark Hot Start Taq DNA Polymerase from the New England Lab (NEB), which generates the PCR products containing dA overhangs at the 3’ end. This allows for a ligation to vector with dT/dU-overhangs. To clone the region of interest using PCR, it’s recommended to run a PCR with a larger volume, to ensure sufficient DNA can be recovered. Usually, 50 μL or more gives better results. One can directly purify the PCR product using a commercial kit. Alternatively, the PCR product can be recovered from the gel slice. If using this method, it’s important to use fresh TAE buffer and a clean razor blade, when performing electrophoresis and recovery. Ligation. Typical ligation conditions are (Table 2):Table 2.

    "Note: After PCR amplification and gel recovery, incubate the PCR products with the cloning vector, following the instructions below (Table 2). Our previous work used the cloning kit from Thermo Fisher (Guo et al., 2021). Ligation can be completed in 5 min at room temperature, but it is recommended to extend this time to 30 min or longer for any PCR products larger than 3,000 bp. TransformationReaders should follow the instructions from the commercial competent cells being used for transformation.Note: Once ligation is complete, samples are ready to undergo vector transformation using E. coli competent cells. Note the antibiotic-resistant gene carried by the vector. Typically, the Top10 strain grows faster than DH 5-alpha strain, but there is no significant difference in using either for a regular cloning experiment. After transformation, cells can be spread directly onto an LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics. Be sure to use either sterilized glass beads or a spreader. Incubate the LB plates at 37°C for 10–16 h. To determine the colonies that carry a positive amplicon, propagate the cells from individual colonies in liquid LB medium, and run a colony-PCR to select the positive colonies that will undergo sequencing. Typically,Prepare 2.0-mL tubes on a tube rack, and fill them with 2 mL of liquid LB medium containing antibiotics.Inoculate each tube with an individual colony from each plate, using a sterilized toothpick or pipette tip.Tubes are then placed onto a shaker set at 200 rpm and 37°C for 10–14 h.Note: Due to some unsuccessful ligation and propagation, and depending on the size of the PCR products, it is recommended to inoculate at least two-fold more colonies than the actual number you want to send for Sanger sequencing.",
    "Once transparent liquid LB medium becomes turbid, run a colony-PCR directly, using 1 mL of liquid LB medium containing cells as the DNA template.Note: Since the size of the vector is usually small, and this is a direct PCR amplification from the plasmid from E. coli, a strong positive amplification typically results after as few as 20 PCR cycles. Typical colony-PCR conditions are (Table 3):Table 3. Overview of colony-PCR conditions table:",

Extraction can be done using traditional methods, or a commercial kit. Once plasmids are ready, samples can be sent for Sanger sequencing. It’s recommended to send a few to test, before multiple samples are sequenced. Distinct sequences from ten colonies from each genotype or treatment should be obtained for analysis.Sequences can be trimmed using SnapGene viewer or any available software. Reference sequences and samples sequences are placed in a separate text file in the FASTA format. Be sure that all sequences are in the correct orientation relative to the reference sequence, and primer sequences are excluded. The two files are uploaded into Kismeth (http://katahdin.mssm.edu/kismeth/revpage.pl[href=http://katahdin.mssm.edu/kismeth/revpage.pl]), which provides quantitative data, as well as images for result visualization."
