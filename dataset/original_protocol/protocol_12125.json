    "1. pHuC_Mermaid Plasmid Generation\nNOTE: Mermaid is a biosensor developed by pairing the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of the Ciona intestinalis (now Ciona robusta)5 voltage sensor containing phosphatase (Ci-VSP) with the FRET partner fluorophores Umi-Kinoko Green (mUKG: donor) and a monomeric version of the orange-emitting fluorescent protein Kusabira Orange (mKOk: acceptor). For this biosensor, conformational changes of the VSD domain, induced by membrane depolarization, increase the proximity of the donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins, thus increasing the energy transfer between them (increasing the FRET Ratio)3. The VSD assures the efficient localization of the biosensor at the plasma membrane. The neuronal expression of the biosensor (in the spinal cord, the signal is detectable in both interneurons and motor neurons) is achieved by cloning the Mermaid open reading frame (ORF) under the zebrafish pan-neural promoter HuC6.\nAmplify by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the Mermaid ORF from the pCS4+ Mermaid plasmid3 with Pfu (proofreading) DNA polymerase using the T3 Universal primer and the Mermaid SmaI primer (5′TATCCCGGGATTCGACGGTTCAGATTTTA) in order to insert a SmaI restriction site upstream of the Mermaid ORF.\nUse the following PCR mixture: 0.5 µL of Pfu DNA polymerase, 7.5 µL of the specific 10x buffer, 1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 2.5 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.5 µL (50 ng) of the plasmid preparation, and 1 µL of 20-µM stock solutions of each primer in a total volume of 50 µL.\nHeat the PCR mixture for 15 s at 95 °C, prime it for 15 s at 50 °C, and elongate it for 4 min at 72 °C for a total of 35 cycles.\nGel-purify the specific blunt PCR product using a commercial gel purification kit, following the manufacturer's protocol.\nClone the DNA fragment into the pCMV-SC blunt vector following the manufacturer's protocol.",
    "Linearize the Mermaid-positive plasmid (named pCMV-SC_Mermaid) with the SmaI restriction enzyme for the following insertion of the HuC promoter.\nSet up the restriction reaction as follow: 0.5 µL (10 U) of SmaI restriction enzyme, 2 µL of the kit 10x buffer, and 5 µg of plasmid DNA in a total volume of 20 µL. Incubate the reaction at 25 °C for 1 h.\nGel-purify the digested plasmid using a commercial gel purification kit following the manufacturer's protocol.\nPCR-amplify the HuC promoter (pHuC), with Pfu DNA polymerase and zebrafish genomic DNA as template, using a pair of HuC-specific primers (HuCprom-forw1_SalI: 5′-GTAGTCGACCAGACTTGTCAAAAGGGTCCA and HuCprom-rev1: 5′-TCCATTCTTGACGTACAAAGATG) and spanning a 3,150-bp region upstream of the ATG.\nSet up the PCR mixture using the following scheme: 0.5 µL of Pfu DNA polymerase, 7.5 µL of the specific 10x buffer, 1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 2.5 µL of DMSO, 200 ng of genomic DNA, and 1 µL of 20-µM stock solutions of each primer in a total volume of 50 µL.\nAfter an initial step of 2 min at 95 °C, heat the PCR mixture for 15 s at 95 °C, prime it for 15 s at 50°C, and elongate it for 4 min at 72 °C for a total of 35 cycles.\nGel-purify the specific blunt PCR product using a commercial gel purification kit following the manufacturer's protocol.\nLigate an equimolar amount of the purified pCMV-SC_Mermaid (step 1.5) and the pHuC DNA (step 1.7) using 1 µL of T4 DNA ligase and 1 µL of the specific 10X buffer in a total volume of 10 µL. Incubate the reaction for 16 h at 4 °C.\nTransform an aliquot of competent cells with 5 µL of the ligation reaction (step 1.8) following the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Select the pHuC-positive clones (pHuC_Mermaid) with the promoter inserted in the proper orientation by a SalI-EcoRV double digestion (the SalI restriction site has been inserted upstream of the promoter fragment in step 1.6, while the EcoRV restriction site is positioned downstream of the polyadenylation region, PolyA, of the pCMV-SC plasmid).\nSet up the restriction reaction as follow: 0.5 µL (10 U) of both SalI and EcoRV restriction enzymes, 2 µL of the kit10X buffer, and 1 µg of pHuC_Mermaid DNA in a total volume of 20 µL. Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 1 h. Run the reactions onto an agarose gel.\n2. Embryo Microinjection\nTransfer the fertilized eggs obtained from wild-type (AB strain) or Sod1-G93R adult zebrafish4 to a 10 mm Petri dish using a plastic pipette.\nRinse the embryos in cold (4 °C) fish water and immediately microinject them into the yolk with 200 pg of pHuC_Mermaid plasmid using a microinjector (for an overall and detailed description of the microinjection procedure, see References 7 and 8).\nUsing a plastic pipette, transfer the embryos to a Petri dish and incubate them in fish water at 28 °C until they reach the desired developmental stage (20-24 h post-fertilization, hpf) for the following analyses.\n3. Spontaneous Tail Coiling Analysis\nNOTE: Evaluate the spontaneous tail coiling behavior in 20-24 hpf embryos with or without the drug riluzole.\nTransfer an embryo to a 90-mm round Petri dish filled with fish water containing 0.2% DMSO (riluzole vehicle) and manually dechorionate it using two jeweler's forceps with sharp tips. Incubate the embryo for 5 min.\nDetect the tail coiling at RT during a 1 min video recording using a digital camera mounted on a stereomicroscope. Acquire time series at a time resolution of 30 frames/s.",
    "Calculate the frequency of spontaneous tail coilings by counting the number of bends (both contralateral and ipsilateral) per time unit.\nTo evaluate the effect of the drug riluzole, gently use a plastic Pasteur pipette to transfer the embryo to a new 90 mm Petri dish filled with fish water containing 5 µM riluzole.\nIncubate the embryo for 5 min before recording a 1-min video and performing the behavioral analysis as above.\n4. Imaging Setup for Mermaid Biosensor Visualization in Living Embryos: Simultaneous Detection of Donor and Acceptor Signals\nMount the 20 - 24 hpf embryos in 1% low-melting-point agarose in fish water at 37 °C inside a 35 mm glass-bottomed imaging dish. Orient the embryos on their sides. Wait until the agarose solidifies at room temperature.\nTransfer the imaging dish to the stage of a inverted confocal mounted on an inverted microscope. Identify motor neurons expressing the biosensor with a 20X objective (0.7 numerical aperture, NA) by exciting the mUKG with the 488 nm argon laser line and recording its emission between 495 and 525 nm.\nFor a FRET measurement, excite mUKG, the donor of the FRET pair, with the 488 nm laser line. Simultaneously detect, with a resonant scanner operating at 8,000 Hz in the bidirectional mode, the fluorescence emitted by the donor (between 495 and 525 nm) and the fluorescence emitted by the mKOk acceptor (between 550 and 650 nm, FRET channel). If available, use the 473 nm laser.\n\tNOTE: The excitation efficiency of the donor will be slightly reduced (85% instead of 93% with 488 nm), but the cross-excitation of the acceptor will be reduced as well (from 17% with the 488 nm to 9% with 473 nm laser line).",
    "To reduce phototoxicity and fluorophore bleaching, minimize the illumination of the sample by reducing the power of the laser line (on the beam path window of the acquisition software).\nOptimize the excitation to match gain and offset parameters that are set at the beginning of the experiment and kept constant throughout the session. To set the offset, change the color of the image to intensity values (by using the Q look-up table) and, while scanning with the laser off, turn the offset knob (smart offset) so that the background pixels have an intensity slightly higher than zero. With the same look-up table, by switching the laser on while scanning, turn the gain knob (smart gain) to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, being careful to avoid saturated pixels.\nUsing an opened pinhole (2 airy units), acquire 16-bit images to provide a sufficient dynamic range for quantitative analyses. Avoid averaging to increase the acquisition speed and to minimize photobleaching.\nIn the software acquisition window, select an image field size of 512 x 64 pixels (pixel size: 605 nm) from the drop-down menu.\nFrom the acquisition mode window, select xyt (time lapse on a single xy plane)from the drop-down menu and record the changes in embryo spinal neuron voltage by acquiring a single xy plane, setting the acquisition parameters to record one image every 30 ms for 1 min.\nTo evaluate the effect of riluzole administration on membrane depolarization in the same neuron, acquire a new dataset 5 min after the addition of fish water containing 5 µM riluzole.\nFor FRET analysis, use the ImageJ macro Biosensor_FRET (expressing single-chain FRET biosensors.",
    "Evaluate the basal membrane FRET ratio of each neuron at t1 as ((FRET mean - FRET background)/(Donor mean - Donor background)), where FRET and Donor mean intensity is the mean fluorescence intensity calculated in the same region of interest (ROI) drawn around the cell for each channel acquired and FRET and Donor background is the mean fluorescence intensity calculated in an ROI of the field of view without the fluorescent sample.\n\tNOTE: A detailed step-by-step description of the use of the plugin can be found at the www.med.unc.edu/microscopy/resources/imagej-plugins-and-macros/biosensor-fret[href=http://www.med.unc.edu/microscopy/resources/imagej-plugins-and-macros/biosensor-fret] website.\nUse a graphing software to compare the frequency, amplitude, and duration of depolarization between different experimental paradigms. Compare two groups using an unpaired Student's t-test and consider mean values as statistically different when P <0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
