    "The protocol is approved and performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of North Carolina.\n1. Preparations\nPrepare Triton-X buffer (1% Triton X-100, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), bring up volume in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4). To make 500 mL: stir 5 mL each of Triton X-100 and 500 mM EDTA into 490 mL of PBS, pH 7.4. Store Triton-X buffer solution at 4 °C.\nPrepare High Salt Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 M KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, bring up volume in double distilled (dd) H2O). To make 500 mL: stir 10 mL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 14 mL of 5 M NaCl, 55.9 g KCl, 5 mL of 0.5 M EDTA, and 2.5 mL of Triton X-100, adjust volume to 500 mL using double distilled water). Store High Salt Buffer solution at 4 °C.\nJust prior to use, supplement an appropriate amount of Triton-X and High Salt Buffer (e.g. 1 mL for each 25 mg tissue sample) with a protease or protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail and discard any unused buffer containing the inhibitors.\nPrepare 5 mM EDTA in 1x PBS, pH 7.4. To make 500 mL: stir 5 mL of 0.5 M EDTA into 495 mL of 1x PBS, pH 7.4.\nIsolate different mouse organs (brain, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, colon, intestine, kidney, spleen) using approved protocols that comply with veterinary guidelines and institutional standards23. The tissue collection procedure should take no more than 5 min to preserve RNA and protein integrity of protease-rich tissues (e.g. pancreas should be processed first).",
    "Cut a small amount of tissue (~5-20 mg) and place in RNA storage solution, for subsequent RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis for IF gene expression. Place RNA storage solution tubes with tissue at 4 °C overnight and follow manufacturer protocol for further storage and isolation steps.\nCut the rest of the tissue into smaller fragments (e.g. 0.5 cm) and place in cryovial. Snap-freeze and store vials at -80 °C or liquid nitrogen for longer term storage.\n2. IF Gene Expression Analysis\nExtract RNA from tissues preserved in the RNA storage solution reagent. Use any suitable/preferred RNA extraction method according to manufacturer's protocol.\nQuantify RNA concentration and use 2 μg of RNA to generate cDNA using a suitable reverse transcription kit according to manufacturer's protocol.\nUsing the generated cDNA and mouse IF gene-specific primers set up qPCR reactions, including three technical replicates of each sample as well as blank control according to manufacturer's protocol.\nQuantify IF gene expression as fold change comparing different conditions (e.g. young versus old tissue).\n3. Preparation of Total Tissue Lysates for Immunoblot\nHomogenize 25 mg of tissue in 1 mL of 2x non-reducing SDS sample buffer. Omit bromophenol blue dye from the sample buffer if a colorimetric protein assay is to be performed to quantify protein concentration.\nAdd 5% (v/v) of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) to make reduced samples. To 200 μL of the non-reducing samples, add 10 μL of 2-ME.\nDetermine protein concentration using detergent- and reducing agent-compatible protein assay. If dye is already included in the sample buffer, the protein amount can be estimated after running a gel via a number of techniques, including Coomassie-based stain24.\nVortex all samples and heat at 95 °C for 5 min.",
    "Perform western blotting under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Exposure membrane briefly (<1 min) to reveals monomeric species, and longer (>1 min) to reveal high molecular mass complexes containing IF proteins. If monitoring aggregation, examine entire gel/membrane (including the bottoms of the gel wells).\nRun a parallel gel and stain with a protein stain as a loading control24. In disease models or injury experiments total protein stain should be used as a loading control, as opposed to immunoblots for 'housekeeping' proteins (e.g. actin, GAPDH) because the latter change under different stress conditions.\n4. Preparation of Detergent-soluble and High-salt Extracts of Tissue-specific IFs\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold Triton X-100 buffer into a glass tube homogenizer and place it on ice.\nRemove a small piece of tissue (~25 mg) from liquid nitrogen storage and place directly into the glass homogenizer. Use a polytetrafluoroethylene pestle to homogenize (50 strokes) and avoid making bubbles. Keep the homogenizer and lysate cold at all times.\nTransfer lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice and centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 10 min in a pre-chilled centrifuge (4 °C).\nCollect the supernatant fraction into a separate tube. This is the Triton X-soluble fraction, which can be used for immunoprecipitation (i.p.) and analysis of the detergent-soluble pool of IF proteins. Note that steps 4.1-4.4 may be repeated to achieve a cleaner IF extract from brain tissue.\nAdd 1 mL of High Salt Buffer to the tissue pellet, transfer to a clean homogenizer and dounce 100 strokes. Transfer the homogenate back to the microcentrifuge tube and place the tube on a rotating shaker in the cold room for 1 h.\nCentrifuge the homogenates at 20,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.",
    "Add 1 mL of ice-cold PBS/EDTA buffer to the pellet and homogenize the pellet (20 strokes) in a clean homogenizer as a final clean-up step*. Transfer to a new tube and centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the IF protein-rich high salt extract (HSE).\n\t* Optionally, vortex instead of homogenization at this step.\nDiscard the supernatant and dissolve the pellets in 300 μL of non-reducing SDS sample buffer that has been pre-heated. Break up the pellet initially by pipetting and vortexing, and then heat the samples for 5 min at 95 °C.\nVortex and pipet as needed to ensure the pellet is dissolved. It may take several minutes to fully dissolve the pellets.\nStore all samples at -20 °C until analysis.\n5. Automated Tissue Lysis for IF Protein Extraction in High-volume Experiments\nFor RNA extraction, place lysis buffer (600 μL buffer per 25 mg of tissue) in a tube containing lysing matrix D (uses small ceramic spheres) and pulse twice for 25 s in the tissue lyser. Separate lysate from the matrix by centrifugation at 20,000 x g and proceed to the next step in isolation.\nFor protein extraction, place Triton X-100 (or SDS sample buffer if preparing total lysate) in a lysing tube with lysing matrix SS (use a single stainless steel bead). After testing multiple matrices, this was selected because it produces IF protein extracts that are in similar quality as the traditional douncing method. Note that the automated method is not optimal for pancreas and spleen, and the standard homogenization protocol should be used for these tissues.\nTo proceed with preparation of High Salt Extract, remove the stainless steel bead from the tube using a magnet, and centrifuge the tubes at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "Continue with step 4.4 (above) of the manual protocol.\nStore all samples at -20 °C until analysis.\n6. Immuno-enrichment of Post-translationally Modified IF Proteins\nPrepare PBST buffer (0.02% Tween-20 in PBS). To make 50 mL, add 10 μL of Tween-20 to 50 mL of PBS, pH 7.4.\nPrepare PTM antibody solution (1-10 μg of antibody in 200 μL of PBST). In general, 3 μg of antibody/reaction is a good starting condition that can be further optimized if needed.\nFor each reaction, aliquot 50 μL of magnetic beads into a microcentrifuge tube, place on the magnet and aspirate the bead storage solution.\nConjugate the beads to the immunoprecipitation antibody by re-suspending in the antibody solution and incubating on rotator (end-over-end, to ensure mixing of small volumes) at room temperature for 20 min.\nPlace the tubes on magnet and aspirate antibody solution.\nRinse the antibody-conjugated beads once in 200 μL PBST and remove wash buffer.\nAdd 0.6-1 mL of the tissue lysate to the beads, mix by gentle pipetting and incubate for 3 h on rotator in a cold room.\nPlace tubes on magnet, remove lysate, and wash the beads five times with 200 μL of PBST. After the last washing step, collect the beads in 100 μL of PBS (no Tween-20) and transfer to a clean new tube. Place the tube on the magnet.\nAspirate the PBS and add 100 μL of non-reducing sample buffer. Remove 50 μL and add 2-ME (5%) to make reducing samples. Heat the samples to 95 °C for 5 min.\nSeparate the i.p. fraction from the beads on the magnet and collect it into a new tube.\nStore samples at -20 °C until analysis.\n7. Preparation of IF Protein Samples for Mass Spectrometry Analysis",
    "Schedule a consultation with a proteomics expert prior to initiating a study since there is significant time and cost involved with mass spectrometry analysis.\nTake special precautions to avoid contamination. Handle all gels with clean gloves and incubate in clean containers, washed only using ddH2O (avoid soap).\nRun 20-50 μL of the HSE sample (from Sections 4 and 5) on an SDS-PAGE gel according to standard conditions.\nStain with a protein stain for 1 h. Rinse multiple times and de-stain in ddH2O overnight. The IF protein bands should be easily visible after de-staining.\nPlace the gel between plastic sheet protectors, scan and mark the bands that will be excised and sent for analysis.\nExcise the IF protein bands using a new clean razor.\nPlace the gel bands in clean microcentrifuge tubes and transfer to a mass spectrometry facility.\nSubscription Required.
