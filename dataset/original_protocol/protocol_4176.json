    "Preparation of pre-embedding samplesCentrifuge 4 x 10 ml of a Plasmodium falciparum culture (5-10% trophozoites and schizonts) in 15 ml falcon tubes at 500 x g for 5 min, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 4 x 10 ml 1 x PBS. Centrifuge again.Purify infected red blood cells from culture using a Percoll gradient as described in Bio-protocol Immuno-EM analysis of PF13_0191-GFP Expressing Parasites [href=http://www.bio-protocol.org/e1137](steps A2a-e) (Heiber and Spielmann, 2014).Note: Combine the 4 pellets after the first washing step into one 1.5 ml Epppendorf tube.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml 1x PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and incubate at room temperature for 10 min on a rolling device.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min and wash the pellet 3x in 1 ml 1x PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 800 µl 1x PBS, add 8 µl tetanolysin (1 µg/µl) and mix the solution immediately by flipping the tube with your finger. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min and prevent the cells from sinking to the bottom by flipping the tube with your finger every few minutes.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min and wash the pellet once by resuspending it in 1 ml 1x PBS followed by centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min.Resuspend the pellet again in 1 ml 1x PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and incubate at room temperature for 5 min on a rolling device.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min and wash the pellet once by resuspending it in 1 ml 1x PBS followed by centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min.Resuspend the pellet in 500 µl 1x PBS containing 3% BSA and incubate at room temperature for 15 min on a rolling device.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 200 µl of freshly prepared 1:20 dilution of mouse anti-GFP antibody in 3% BSA in 1x PBS and incubate at room temperature for 1.5 h on a rolling device.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min and wash the pellet twice in 1 ml 1x PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 200 µl of freshly prepared 1:25 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse linker antibody in 3% BSA in 1x PBS and incubate at room temperature for 1.5 h on a rolling device.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min and wash the pellet twice in 1 ml 1x PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 200 µl of freshly prepared 1:20 dilution of protein A gold in 3% BSA in 1x PBS and incubate at room temperature for 1.5 h on a rolling device.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min and wash the pellet twice in 1 ml 1x PBS.FixationResuspend the cells in 500 µl sodium cacodylate buffer and add glutaraldehyde to 2% and incubate for 1 h at 4 °C. Note: The sample can be stored at 4 °C until use.Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 3 min and wash the cells 3x with 500 µl sodium cacodylate buffer.Post fix the cells with 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer for 30 min at 4 °C.Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 3 min and wash the cells 3x with 500 µl sodium cacodylate buffer.Prepare 3% low melting agarose by heating it over a Bunsen burner and cool down to 40 °C in a water bath.Resuspend the cells in the 40 °C liquid 3% low melting agarose and in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube spin the cells down immediately at 13,000 x g for 5 min.",
    "Let the agarose harden for 30 min at 4 °C to form a stable agarose pellet containing the infected red blood cells.Crop off the tip of the tube with a razor blade and remove the agarose pellet.Dehydration of the sample through increasing concentrations of ethanolStart with 30% ethanol and incubate for 10 min. Continue by transferring the sample to glass bottles containing 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, respectively and 3x to a new bottle with 100% ethanol and incubate each time for 10 min.Remove the agarose pellet from the ethanol and trim the embedded infected red blood cells with a razor blade into very small pieces (max. length of the edge ~1 mm).Incubate the sample 2x for 10 min in propylene oxide to fully cover the sample.Embedding and sectioningNote: All steps have to be performed in glass vials since the propylene oxide dissolves the plastic tubes and sufficient volumes need to be used to fully cover the sample. Incubate the sample in 3:1 propylene oxide/epon resin for 15 min in a sealed glass vial.Incubate the sample in 1:1 propylene oxide/epon resin for 30 min in a sealed glass vial.Incubate the sample in 1:3 propylene oxide/epon resin overnight in a sealed glass vial.Replace the resin mixture with fresh pure epon resin and incubate in an unsealed glass vial for 2 h at room temperature.Incubate for ~15 min at 60 °C to increase the fluidity of the resin. Fill gelatine capsules with resin and add the sample with tweezers. Incubate the samples over night at 60 °C to harden the resin.Note: The sample will sink to the bottom of the capsule.Prepare 50 to 70 nm ultrathin sections with an ultramicrotome and place them on copper grids using tweezers.",
    "Contrast the thin sections by placing them on a drop of 2% uranyl acetate for 5 min, followed by thorough rinsing in dH2O. Then place sections on a drop of lead citrate for 5 min, rinse thoroughly in dH2O and view the samples in a transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. An example for the appearance of infected RBCs in a section prepared according to the pre-embedding method is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140530/20140530202620_2702.jpgFigure 1.
