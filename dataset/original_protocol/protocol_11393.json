    "1. Cell Culture and Transfection\nCell culture\n\tNote: HN4, an HNSCC cell line, was derived from patients with HNSCC14.\n\t\nCulture HN4 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, 4.5 g/L glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin). Incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nCell transfection\nOne day before transfection, plate 5 x 105 cells in 2 mL/well of culture medium without antibiotics in 6-well plates.\nDilute 100 pmol CLIC4 siRNA or scrambled SiRNA in 250 µL of reduced serum media, gently. Dilute 5 µL liposome reagent in 250 µL of reduced serum media and incubate for 5 min. Combine the diluted siRNA with the diluted liposome reagent, mix gently, and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nAdd the mixture to each well containing cells and medium. Mix gently by rocking the plate back-and-forth. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 24 h before proceeding with the following Rh123 labeling procedure. Replace the medium with normal growth medium 4 h after transfection.\n2. Rh123 Labeling\nNote: Rh123 was utilized to measure the MMP in HN4 cells1.\nAfter CLIC4 siRNA treatment (Section 1), use HN4 cells in 6-well plates for the following treatment. The amount of HN4 cells in each well is enough to repeat the experiment 10 times on coverslips.\nUse tweezers to put circular coverslips on the bottom of new 12-well plates. The number of plates is set according to the experimental design (Figure 1A).\nPut 150 µL of 100 µg/mL polylysine on the middle of every coverslip inside the 12-well plates and wait 2 min. Pay attention to not put polylysine outside the coverslips. Then remove the polylysine by pipettor thoroughly (Figure 1B).",
    "Remove the culture medium of the HN4 cells inside the dish and add 1 mL 0.25% trypsin to detach the cells. After 6 min, add 2 mL culture medium to neutralize the trypsin. Gently mix the HN4 cells by pipettor for 5 times and seed 2 - 6 х 104 cells on the circular coverslips. Place in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 (Figure 1C).\nAfter 8 h incubation, incubate the HN4 cells with 2 µmol/L Rh123 for 40 min at 37 °C. Gently mix the medium up-and-down several times to ensure even distribution of Rh123 in the medium (Figure 1D).\nPrepare enough normal physiological saline solution (NPSS); to make NPSS (in mmol/L): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4). Preheat to 37 °C in a water bath.\nUse tweezers to remove the coverslips and wash the remaining liquid via briefly placing the coverslips into the preheated NPBS buffer (Figure 1E).\nPlace the coverslips on the bottom of the 500 µL stainless steel chamber (see Table of Materials) with a replaceable 25 mm glass coverslip bottom sealed in place by an o-ring. Fix it by tightening the lid of the chamber (Figure 1E).\nAdd 450 µL preheated NPSS buffer to the assembled chamber and put the bath under the visual field of the fluorescence microscope or confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope (Figure 1E).\n3. Detection of the MMP\nCommon fluorescence microscope\nTurn on the fluorescence microscope following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: Common fluorescence microscope was accomplished with a mercury lamp fiberoptic light source, a FITC filter set for Rh123 (480/40 excitation filter, 505 LP dichroic mirror and 535/40 emission filter) at room temperature. 20X objective was used to perform live-cell imaging.",
    "Open the imaging system software and select the \"New\" button from the command bar to begin a new experiment (Figure 2A).\nAdjust the visual field and focus to find the location of the cells in white light.\nTurn off the light and push the button to close white light. Click the \"Focus\" button from the Command bar and select \"Start Focusing\" to switch on the fluorescence. Find the location of the cells again via microscope with a 507 nm excitation and 529 nm long pass emission wavelength (Set before the experiment). Adjust the visual field and focus again if needed (Figure 2B).\nSelect a visual field containing only 20 to 30 separated HN4 cells. The change of intracellular fluorescence signal for each cell will be recorded accurately.\nOnce a clear visual field is achieved, click \"Close Focusing\" from the Focus bar. Click \"Acq One\" from the Command Bar to acquire one set of images. Click \"Regions\" from the Command Bar and click the \"OK\" button to edit measurement regions.\n\t\tNOTE: From the Edit Region bar, different region shapes can be used depending on the study.\nTo fit for different shapes of individual cells, select the \"Trace Region\" tool and circle the region of one single cell and double click when finished. Repeat the procedure until all cells are circled (Figure 2C). Click \"Done\" and select \"Save Images\" to find the saved location.\nClick \"Zeroclock \"and quickly push F4 to start monitoring the change of fluorescence intensity. Record the real-time change of fluorescence intensity once every 5 s for 5 min (Figure 2D).\nWhen the baseline becomes stable, add 50 µL NPSS mixed with 0.5 µL of 100 mmol/L ATP to the chamber via pipettor. Remember to not touch the chamber to avoid removing the visual field (Figure 2E).",
    "NOTE: The fluorescence image will be recorded for 20 min and then the experiment can end via manual operation. The time duration is routinely settled for 20 min in order to observe the entire fluorescence change. However, manual operation to stop capture is applied when unexpected factors influence the stability of the curve or when the entire process takes less than 20 min.\nConfocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope\nTurn on the confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope following the manufacturer's instructions, and open the bundled software.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, Rh123 was excited by an Argon laser set at 488 nm and the emitted signal was recorded over the range of 545 - 700 nm via application of the TD488/543/633 filter.\nClick \"Objective\" under the \"Acquire\" menu to select 63X/1.4 N.A. oil objective lens. Observe the specimen and find a clear visual field under the light field.\nPush the \"TL/IL\" button to switch to fluorescence mode and select the correct fluorescence filters to find the location of the cell under darkness via microscope. Push \"SHUTTER\" to protect the specimen when observation is finished.\nUnder the \"Acquire\" menu, adjust suitable PMT channel and click \"Achieve\" to activate the settled optical path (Figure 3A). Click on the \"Configuration\" menu and choose \"Laser\" to determine the needed laser type. \"Argon\" is recommended for this protocol (Figure 3B).\nClick \"Live\" to get real-time image and make sure the visual field contains only 20 to 30 separated HN4 cells. The change of intracellular fluorescence signal for each cell will be recorded accurately.\nSelect \"xyt\" in Acquisition Mode in the \"Acquisition\" submenu under the \"Acquire\" menu (Figure 3C). Set 5 s and 20 min for time interval and duration, respectively. Click\" Apply\" when all parameters are settled.",
    "Under the \"Quantify\" menu, use the \"Draw Polyline\" tool to circle the recording area of each cell. Select \"Line Profile\" and choose \"Start\" to conduct observation. Record the real-time change of fluorescence intensity for 5 min (Figure 3D - E).\nWhen the baseline becomes stable, add 50 µL NPSS mixed with 0.5 µL of 100 mmol/L ATP to the chamber via pipettor. Remember to not touch the chamber to avoid removing the visual field.\n\t\tNOTE: The fluorescence image will be recorded for 20 min and then the experiment is completed.\n4. Statistical Analysis\nCommon fluorescence microscope\nTurn on the fluorescence microscope routinely following the operator's manual. Open the imaging system software and select the \"Open\" button from the command bar to open a saved experiment. Click \"Regions\" from the 'Command Bar' and click \"OK\" button to edit measurement regions.\nSelect the \"Trace region\" tool and circle the region of one single cell and double click when done. Repeat the procedure until all cells have been circled. Click \"Done\" and select the \"F4: forward\" button to obtain a trace showing fluorescence intensity.\nOnce finished, click the down arrow button located on the lower right corner of the graph and click \"Show Graph Data\" (Figure 2F). Click \"OK\" twice and choose the \"Log Data\" button to open the interface of data processing software. Click \"Log Data\" again and find the records of real time fluctuation of fluorescence intensity appear on the spreadsheet.",
    "NOTE: For each cell, changes in MMP were displayed as the ratio of fluorescence relative to the intensity before the application of ATP or TG (F1/F0). Each fluorescence intensity data were the average of 20 - 30 cells. Data for Rh123 are presented as mean ± SE. Results from 2 groups were tested by the two-tailed independent t test and P value <0.05 was considered as statistical significance. Statistical analysis software was applied to conduct the statistical analyses in this experiment.\nConfocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope\nTurn on the confocal laser microscope and log into the bundled software following the manufacturer's instructions.\nSelect \"Fire\" to open a recorded experiment.\nSelect the \"Stack profile\" tool under the \"Quantify\" menu, choose \"All in one\" from \"Sort charts by Channels and ROIs.\"\nUse the \"Draw polygon\" tool to circle cell regions for observation.\nSelect the \"Graph\" menu and click the right mouse button, and choose \"Export to excel\" to add the values of fluorescent intensity to a spreadsheet. The following analysis is consistent with normal fluorescence microscopes (Figure 3F).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
