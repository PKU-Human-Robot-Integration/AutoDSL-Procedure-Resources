    "Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Animal Research Ethics Committee of Wen Zhou Medical College.\n1. Preparation of Culture Media and Alginate Hydrogel\nPrepare ovarian tissue and follicle handling medium using L-15 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Store at 4 °C for two weeks.\nPrepare ovarian tissue and follicle culture medium consisting of alpha-minimal essential medium [α-MEM] supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 1% insulin-selenium-transferrin, 10 mIU/ml rFSH, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Store at 4 °C for two weeks.\nPrepare alginate hydrogel using 0.8% (w/v) sodium alginate solution in sterile PBS, then drop 10 µL of this solution into the encapsulation solution (140 mM NaCl /50 mM CaCl2) to create alginate beads.\n\tNOTE: The alginate bead size was about 3 mm in diameter.\n2. Mouse Follicle Isolation and Encapsulation\nCull 14 day-old ICR female mice by cervical dislocation, remove ovaries aseptically using scissors and forceps, and put ovaries into 2 mL of handling medium.\nCut ovaries in half using a scalpel. The half-sized ovarian tissue was about 1 mm thickness for culture in the culture medium.\nManually isolate follicles from ovaries using 26 1/2-guage needles under a 2-4X stereomicroscope, and collect the selected follicles for culture in the culture medium.\n\tNOTE: Follicle selection criteria: 1) follicles were round with oocytes in the middle and 2-3 layers of granulosa cells surrounding the oocytes, 2) follicles had an intact basal membrane attached with some theca cells, and 3) follicle size was 90-100 µm in diameter",
    "Create alginate beads per step 1.3. Wash follicles with alginate solution and then pipette a single follicle into the middle of each alginate bead to make certain every bead contains a single follicle under a stereomicroscope. After rinsing in culture medium, culture the alginate beads in 150 µL of culture medium in a 35×10 mm culture dish or a RWV device.\n3. Ovarian Tissue or Follicle Culture Under Simulated Microgravity\nUse a RWV device for generating simulated microgravity. Fill the vessel with light paraffin oil (~10 mL), place 150 µL of culture medium in a droplet into the oil, then transfer one piece of ovarian tissue or three alginate beads with encapsulated follicles into the medium droplet. Close the vessel port cap and fix the vessel onto the rotating base of the device.\nIn control groups, place alginate beads containing follicles or ovarian tissue into 150 µL of culture medium in a droplet covered with light paraffin oil in 35×10 mm culture dishes.\nIncubate both the culture dishes and RWV device in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air.\nTo change culture medium in RWV device: pour the oil and medium from the vessel into a 150×20 mm culture dish, transfer the ovarian tissue or alginate beads to a culture dish with culture medium. Re-establish the vessel culture system per step 3.1.\n4. Decapsulation and Follicle Retrieval\nAfter 4 days of culturing, pour the oil and medium from the vessel into a 150×20 mm culture dish. Pick up alginate beads and decapsulate follicles from the alginate beads by incubating in handling medium supplemented with 10 U/mL alginate lyase for 30 min at 37 °C.\nCollect follicles and then wash them in handling medium under a stereomicroscope.\n5. Ovarian Tissue and Follicle Assessment\nCell Viability Assay",
    "Wash the decapsulated follicles three times in D-PBS, and then incubate them in 150 µL of the combined Cell Viability Assay reagents (2 µM calcein AM and 4 µM EthD-1) at room temperature for 45 min.\nTransfer follicles to a clean microscope slide with 10 µL D-PBS, cover with a coverslip, and then seal with clear fingernail polish.\nCount green and red cells in the slides under a confocal fluorescence microscope (400X).\n\t\tNOTE: In this viability assay, green cells are live cells, and red cells are dead cells. Follicles with less than 10% red cells (dead) are considered as survived follicles.\nHematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining of Ovarian Tissue and Follicle\nFix fresh 14-day-old mouse ovaries and preantral follicles isolated from 14-day-old mice in Bouin's solution as Day 0 samples. Fix the cultured ovarian tissue after either 2-day or 4-day culture, and individual follicles inside the alginate beads after 4-day culture as experimental samples.\nEmbed all samples in paraffin, section serially at 5 µm thickness, and then stain with H&E according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nFollicle Counting and Diameter Measurement\nIn ovarian tissue sections stained with H&E, count all follicles and healthy preantral follicles within the tissue section area under a microscope (magnification 400X). Calculate follicle density by dividing the number of preantral follicles by the total number of follicles.\n\t\tNOTE: the healthy preantral follicles are those with at least two layers of granulosa cells.\nMeasure follicle and oocyte diameter of the Day 0 follicles and Day 4 cultured follicles.\nImmunohistochemistry",
    "Fix ovarian tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde, embed in paraffin, section at 5-µm-thickness, and mount tissue sections on slides. Dewax the sections, rehydrate, and incubate them in citrate buffer for 15 min. Block the endogenous peroxidase in 3% hydrogen peroxide, unmask antigen in 5% goat serum, and then incubate with primary antibodies at room temperature for 3 h.\n\t\t\nWash in PBS for 3 min, then incubate the slides with 1:500 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) for 1 h at room temperature.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The primary antibodies used in the study were rabbit anti-GDF-9 antibody (1:500 dilution) and rabbit anti-PCNA antibody (1:200 dilution).\nIncubate ovarian section slides with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine [DAB] to detect the peroxidase activity and mount on glass slides with aqueous mounting medium.\nObserve ovarian section slides under a microscope at 400X magnification.\nTransmission Electron Microscopy [TEM]\nFix follicles in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 3 h at room temperature, then post-fix in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 37 °C. Wash with PBS, then treat the follicles with 1% phosphotungstic acid and 1% sodium uranyl acetate for 1 h at 37 °C. Dehydrate follicles using an acetone series: 25, 50, 75, 95, and 100% (3 times), and epoxy resin-acetone mixture after the final 100% acetone step at 37 °C, and then embed in epoxy resin at 45 °C.\nCut the embedded blocks into 1.0 µm semi-thin sections, and stain the sections with 1% methylene blue for 1-2 min to localize the follicles in the blocs. Cut the embedded blocks into 50 nm ultrathin sections and mount the sections on grids for TEM.\n6. Statistical Analysis",
    "Present all data in mean ± SEM format. Determine the differences between groups by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey multiple comparison test. The α threshold for test result significance was set at p < 0.05."
