    "The methods described here and in Section 2 have been approved by the Florida State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and follows the guidelines set forth in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition. All animals used in this in this protocol are house in a dedicated laboratory animal facility until use. No in vivo experimentation was performed prior to sacrifice. Animal numbers were based on experimental need using average cell and myelin collections as a guide in order to minimize usage.\nNOTE: This protocol describes the generation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Section 1), the preparation of fluorescently labeled brain-derived myelin debris (Section 2), the general procedure for analyzing myelin debris phagocytosis (Section 3), and the general procedure for analysis of myelin debris lipid accumulation (Section 4). Reagent preparation, cell harvesting and manipulation, myelin collection and labeling, and assay performance should be completed in a laminar airflow biosafety cabinet.\n1. Generation of Primary Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages\nPreparation of complete macrophage culture medium (CMCM)\n\tNOTE: Macrophage generation from bone marrow requires the use of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). This preparation utilizes L929 murine fibroblast conditioned media as the source of M-CSF.\n\t\nGenerate L929 murine fibroblast conditioned media by culturing cells in 145 mm dishes with 50 mL of high glucose (4500 mg/L L-glucose) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% new born calf serum (NCS) and Penicillin/Streptomycin for 7 days.\nCollect media from cultures into 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes and centrifuge for 30 minutes at 3500 x g, 4 °C.\nFilter supernatants through a 0.2 µm syringe filter into a new 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. Conditioned media can be stored at -80 °C for up to 6 months.",
    "To high glucose DMEM, add 5% vol/vol NCS, 15% vol/vol L929 murine fibroblast conditioned DMEM, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. Media can be stored at 4 °C for 2-3 months. Warm to 37 °C before use.\nCollection of primary bone marrow cells and macrophage induction\nNOTE: Using this protocol one mouse will generate approximately 20 million bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs).\n\t\nEuthanize the desired number of 8-10 week old mice using standard CO2 asphyxiation guidelines followed by cervical dislocation.\nSanitize the animal using 70% (vol/vol) ethanol:H2O, saturating the fur.\nCut a small opening in the abdomen and carefully pull back the skin to reveal the underlying tissue. Take care to not puncture the peritoneal cavity.\nRemove both hind legs starting at the hip and ending at the ankle. Place the collected tissue into a 100 mm Petri dish containing 5-10 mL sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.\nNOTE: When processing several animals make sure to keep dishes on ice to limit tissue degradation.\nRemove muscle and connective tissue from the bone using a scalpel. Only the femur and tibia are used for cell collection, the fibula can be discarded.\nExpose the marrow cavity of the collected bones by trimming a small section from each end with a scalpel.\nUsing a 25g needle, flush the marrow cavities with CMCM into a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. The bones will appear white once they have been sufficiently flushed.\nOnce collection is completed, agitate aspirates with an 18g needle for 30-90 s to generated a single cell suspension.",
    "NOTE: An optional red blood cell (RBC) lysis step may be performed at this point. It has recently been suggested that intracellular iron content may influence the effects of myelin debris upon macrophage polarization16. For information regarding the inclusion of a RBC lysis step refer to Trouplin et al.17.\nFilter the suspension through a 70 µm sterile cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nSeed collected cells evenly into 145 mm cell culture dishes containing 15-20 mL CMCM. Use approximately three culture dishes per mouse sacrificed. Incubate cultures at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 72 hours wash plates once with sterile PBS to remove non-adherent cells, then add 15-20mL fresh CMCM. Incubate cultures for an additional 4 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 7 days of total culture, the hematopoietic bone marrow cells initially isolated will be mature BMDMs (Figure 1).\n2. Generation of Fluorescently Labeled Brain-Derived Myelin Debris\nNOTE: All reagents can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nPreparation of myelin debris collection reagents \nPrepare Tris·Cl buffer solution.\n\t\t\nTo 800mL distilled deionized H2O (ddiH2O) add 20 mL of 1 M Tris·Cl, pH 7.45 (20 mM final concentration) and 20 mL of 100 mM Na2EDTA (2 mM final concentration).\nAdjust pH to 7.45. Adjust volume to 1000 mL with ddiH2O. Filter solution through a 0.2 µm filtration unit.\nPrepare 1 M sucrose solution.\n\t\t\nTo 100 mL of Tris·Cl buffer solution, add 68.46 g of sucrose.

Set rotor acceleration and deceleration to their minimum values to reduce myelin debris loss.\nCollect the myelin debris from the interface of the two sucrose densities.\nNOTE: Debris should appear as a white band towards the center of the tube.\nCombine the crude myelin debris into a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube and adjust the volume to approximately 35 mL using Tris·Cl buffer solution.\nHomogenize the crude myelin debris with a sterile hand-held rotary homogenizer for 30-60 s.",

Myelin debris can be store at -80 °C for 6 months.\nMyelin debris fluorescent labeling\nPrepare the 50 µM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) solution immediately before use.\n\t\t\nUsing sterile PBS, dilute a 5 mM stock solution of CFSE prepared with 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final working concentration of 50 µM.\nFilter solution through a 0.2 µm syringe filter.\nThaw the desired amount of 100 mg/mL myelin debris and re-suspend with a sterile 29g needle.\nNOTE: Freezing the myelin debris will cause it to drop out of solution requiring resuspension before use.\nTransfer myelin debris to a pre-weighed 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 14,800 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the myelin debris in 200 µL of CFSE solution per 100 µL myelin debris pelleted.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature (RT) protected from light.\nCentrifuge at 14,800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.

Myelin Debris Phagocytosis Assay\nNOTE: The following is the basic method for observing phagocytosis of fluorescently labeled myelin debris. Addition of other treatments and experimental conditions will need to be optimized by the investigator.\nPreparation of treatment plates\nFor each 145 mm plate, collect mature BMDMs into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube using 5-6 mL of 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS) (pH 7.4).\nNOTE: Do not use trypsin as it may alter the activation state of the cells18.\nAdd an equal volume of pre-warmed CMCM to each tube of collected cells.\nCentrifuge at 180 x g for 8 min at 20 °C.

Quantification of Intracellular Lipids Via Oil Red-O Staining\nNOTE: The following is the basic method for observing intracellular myelin-debris-derived lipids. The use of CFSE labeled myelin debris is not recommended for fluorescent quantification of ORO staining due to spectral overlap. Addition of other treatments and experimental conditions will need to be optimized by the investigator.\nPreparation of staining solutions\nPrepare 0.5% Oil Red-O (ORO) staining solution.\n\t\t\nSlowly add 100 mL of 100% propylene glycol (1,2-Propanediol) to 0.5 g of ORO (1-([4-(Xylylazo)xylyl]azo)-2-naphthol) while stirring.\nHeat solution at 95 °C for 15 min or until all large particles are dissolved.\nNOTE: Do not heat over 100 °C.\nFilter solution through a piece of filter paper while still warm into a new container.\nAllow solution to cool overnight at RT.
