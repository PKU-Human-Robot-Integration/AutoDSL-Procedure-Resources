    "All procedures involving zebrafish were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.\n1. Isolating Non-malignant B and T Lymphocytes from Transgenic lck:eGFP Fish\nAnesthetize the fish using 0.02% tricaine (MS-222) in fish system water.\nExamine 2–6 month old fish for fluorescent thymi, which are located at the dorsomedial aspect of the branchial cavity of zebrafish and other teleosts14. Use an epifluorescence microscope (470/40 excitation wavelength and 525/50 emission filter) to detect GFP.\nPrepare in advance 50 mL of filter-sterilized 1x Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium (RPMI) containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (sorting media). Unused sorting media can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months.\nEuthanize the fish by placing it in a beaker containing 0.2% Tricaine for approximately 5 min, followed by ice bath immersion. Confirm death by the cessation of opercular (gill) movement.\nPlace the euthanized fish in a Petri dish and dissect lymphoid organs of interest, using the fluorescent microscope to dissect the GFP+ thymi14, and bright field microscopy settings to dissect the kidney marrow and spleen15. Results presented here were obtained using 3 month-old fish. Lymphocyte proportions and absolute numbers vary by age and genotype (see discussion for further detail).\nPlace each dissected organ in a 1.5 mL tube containing 500 µL of cold sorting media.\nHomogenize the tissue on ice using a pestle micro-tube homogenizer.\nPass homogenized tissue through a 35 µm mesh filter to generate a single cell suspension. Keep the cells on ice until analysis.\n2. Isolating Malignant Lymphocytes from Double-transgenic rag2:hMYC;lck:eGFP Zebrafish\nBeginning at 2-4 months, microscopically screen rag2:hMYC; lck:eGFP fish for abnormal GFP patterns.",
    "NOTE: B cells are GFPlo in the lck:eGFP background, so B-ALL requires practice to recognize; T-ALL is obvious, because T cells are GFPhi. Consequently, the rag2:hMYC, lck:eGFP dual-transgenic line has two phenotypes: brightly-fluorescent T-ALL, which usually arise from the thymus and extend into the body, and dimly-fluorescent B-ALL.\n\t\nUsing a fluorescent microscope, screen the fish using “low exposure” settings (200 ms, 2.4x gain) to identify bright T-ALL (Figure 1A) and “high exposure” (1.5 s, 3.4x gain) to identify dim B-ALL (Figure 1A). WT controls and pre-leukemic fish have GFP localized only in the thymus (Figure 1B).\nAnesthetize and examine the fish as described in steps 1.1–1.2.\nCategorize the fish based on the extent of GFP fluorescence, using a simple three category system:\nNOTE: Level 1: Fluorescence appears as a thymic tumor with only limited local spread.\n\tLevel 2: Fluorescence appears beyond the thymus, involving <50% of the body.\n\tLevel 3: Fluorescence extends beyond 50% of the body.\nSeparate the fish with ALL from those without cancer. Monitor pre-leukemic fish (i.e., fish without GFP+ tumors) once monthly for the development of new ALL. By ~9 months, all rag2:hMYC, lck:eGFP fish develop T-ALL, B-ALL, or both.\nFor T- or B-ALL cell isolation, select Level 3 fish (ALL involving >50% of the body), which yield more than 2 x 106 ALL cells, and typically many more.\nEuthanize the fish as in step 1.4.\nNOTE: There are two methods to obtain ALL cells: whole body homogenization and a peritoneal wash technique16. The methods differ in the absolute number of cells collected for sorting, and thus, the amounts of FACS time required and cost (see discussion for further detail).",
    "For either method, first place the euthanized fish in a Petri dish and using a razor blade, remove the head including the thymic region. This can be processed separately, if desired, or used for histological staining.\nPeritoneal Wash Method\nUsing a P1000 pipette, wash the fish peritoneal cavity with 500 µL of cold sorting media, collecting the cells and media in a 5 mL tube.\nUsing a fresh pipette tip, inject an additional 200–300 µL of cold sorting media into the body cavity. Then, using the tip of the pipette, apply gentle pressure to the fish body to extrude the cells out of the body cavity. Collect this media and add to the 5 mL tube.\nRepeat step 2.8.2 2–3 times. Keep the collected cells in sorting media on ice.\nFilter the cell suspension though a 35 µm mesh filter prior to flow cytometry/FACS and keep the cells on ice until analysis.\nWhole Body Homogenization\nAfter removing the fish head, place the body in a 1.5 mL tube containing 200 µL of sorting media.\nHomogenize the body using a pestle micro-tube homogenizer.\nAdd an additional 300 µL of cold sorting media. Filter the cell suspension though a 35 µm mesh filter. Add sorting media as needed to wash all cells through the filter, until only tissue debris remains on the filter. Keep the cells on ice until analysis.\n3. Cytometric Analysis of Normal or Malignant B Lymphocytes\nSet flow cytometric analysis and/or FACS parameters according to manufacturer’s guide.\nAcquire desired number of events to initially characterize the sample. Analyze 1 x 104 to 5 x 104 events prior to sorting to determining specific gates for subsequent sorting steps.",
    "Determine gates: Define lymphocyte and progenitor cell gates using forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters, excluding cellular debris (Figure 2A-C)17. FSC and SSC correspond to cell size/diameter and granularity, respectively.\nNOTE: GFP-, GFPlo, and GFPhi cells differ 10-to-100-fold in terms of their GFP fluorescence intensity, making separation of these populations straightforward (Figures 2-5). Live-dead discrimination can be assessed at this point using propidium iodine (PI) or 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAAD) viability staining. Previous experiments with PI typically demonstrate >95% viability of GFP+ cells after FACS.\nExclude the cell doublets, according to the parameters of the FACS machine being used.\nWithin the lymphoid and/or precursor gates, determine the number and percentage of GFP+ cells.\nUse phycoerythrin (PE) and GFP intensities, define gate for GFP- vs. GFPlo vs. GFPhi cells.\nNOTE: B cells exhibit dim GFP fluorescence and T cells show bright GFP in lck:eGFP lines. Many lymphoid organs or tumor samples contain both GFP+ populations. B-lineage cells/B-ALL are GFPlo and T-lineage cells/T-ALL are GFPhi. Define gates to distinguish between GFP-, GFPlo, and GFPhi cells, and collect these populations separately (Figure 2A-C, Figure 3A-C, Figure 4A and Figure 5A).\nSort each cell population into different 15 mL polypropylene tubes containing 2 mL of sorting media, or directly into different 1.5 mL tubes containing an appropriate buffer for further analyses (e.g., RNA, DNA, or protein extraction, allo-transplantation, etc.).\nKeep purified cells on ice prior to further analyses.\nSubscription Required.
