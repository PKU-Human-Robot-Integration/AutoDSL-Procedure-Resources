To study cell competition in vitro, fluorescently labeled organoid populations can be cultured simultaneously in one well. This protocol provides detailed steps on how to initiate organoid co-cultures.\nCritical: For the interpretation of the co-culture results, it is critical to always take along a ‘control’ co-culture consisting of normal (wild type; WT) organoids in 2 distinct fluorescent colors (WT/WT) to compare with your experimental co-culture (WT/Mutant).\nBefore you start: Pre-warm 24-well culture plates at least 1 day prior to co-culture initiation.\nCheck well confluency and organoid condition under the microscope to assess whether they are suited for co-culture experiments. An example of optimal organoid density within a 24-well plate is presented in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nTo generate co-cultures in a 1:1 ratio, select wells with similar organoid density as estimated by eye. Alternatively, the amount of organoids per well of a 24-well plate can be counted by manual counting or by scanning the well in its fluorescent channel and quantifying using ImageJ. An example of a plating strategy in a 24-well plate with 4 technical replicates is given below (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1303-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example of 3D co-culture workflow in a 24-well plate generating a control WT/WT and experimental WT/Mutant co-culture with 4 technical replicates\nRemove ENR medium from the wells containing organoids.\nTo take organoids out of the Matrigel, add 250 μL Cell Recovery Solution to 50 μL Matrigel domes (volume can be adapted according to the amount of domes) and forcefully disrupt the Matrigel by pipetting up and down using a P1000 filter tip.",
    "Transfer the organoid solution of both populations in the same sterile 15 mL tube and pipet thoroughly up and down to mix and break down organoid fragments.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min.\nNote: Depending on your research question and the clonogenicity, expansion rates, and expected competitive effects (advantage/disadvantage) of your organoids, different plating ratios (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) can be used.\nAfter incubation on ice, centrifuge the tube at 480×g for 4 min in order to remove cell debris. Discard the supernatant.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1303-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Co-cultures of organoids using different (magenta:green) plating ratios, scalebar 500 μm\nResuspend the organoid pellet in an appropriate volume of Matrigel (volume dependent on the amount of co-culture wells to be generated).\nNote: 50 μL of Matrigel per seeded well of a 24-well plate is required for an optimal seeding density. It is recommended to add approximately 30 μL extra Matrigel to the total volume to ensure a sufficient amount of material available and to prevent the formation of bubbles. Essential in seeding co-cultures is to keep the Matrigel ice-cold for the duration of the handling.\nPlate exactly 50 μL of Matrigel containing co-culture suspension per well of a pre-warmed 24-well plate. In between plating the wells, pipet the solution up and down to mix organoid populations.\nCarefully transfer the culture plate to an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) and leave the plate for approximately 15 min to solidify the Matrigel domes.\nNote: After approximately 5 min, turn the plate upside down for optimal distribution of organoid within the Matrigel dome and to prevent attaching to the plate’s surface.\nProvide each well containing the organoid co-cultures with 500 μL of pre-warmed ENR culture medium.\nPlace organoids in a humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).",
    "Optional: 3D co-cultures can also be expanded as regular cultures to enable analysis over several passages.\nAlternatives: To study contact dependent interactions in 3D, fused organoid co-cultures can be established. To generate fused magenta:green organoid co-cultures, mechanically disrupt organoids and mix suspensions in Eppendorf vials. Mildly centrifuge and resuspend the cell pellet in a small volume of ENR medium. Incubate the organoid mixtures at 37°C for 30 min to ensure cell fragments to stick together before centrifuging the organoid mixture at 480×g for 4 min, discarding the supernatant and plating the organoids in Matrigel domes (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). An excellent manuscript demonstrating complete details on the use and execution of this co-culture method, please refer to (Krotenberg Garcia et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1303-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Example of co-culture with fused magenta:green organoids, scalebar 1 mm (left panel), 250 μm (zoom panel)\nProtocol 2: preparation of 2D organoid co-cultures\nThis protocol describes the generation of 2D co-cultures of mouse intestinal organoids on collagen hydrogels. This protocol has three distinct steps: the preparation of the hydrogels, the establishment of 2D monocultures, and the generation of 2D co-cultures.\nPreparation of collagen hydrogels\nTiming: 1 h + 30 min\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this part of the protocol, please refer to the step-by-step protocol from Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nNote: Prepare neutralization buffer for Collagen Rat Tail Type I (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). Collagen hydrogel formation is dependent on pH and temperature: 1 mL of properly neutralized Collagen at 1 mg/mL will form a gel within 30–60 min at 37°C. Calculate the volume of Collagen I and neutralization buffer needed for a final concentration of 1mg/mL in 1 mL. For an example see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nGently mix the calculated volume of Collagen I and the Neutralisation buffer.",
    "Pipet the 1 mL on top of one well of a 6 well plate.\nIncubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nNote: Plates can be prepared and stored up to one month at 37°C with 1 mL of PBS. Make sure to either refresh the PBS or seal the plates with parafilm to avoid hydrogels from drying out.\nCritical: The Collagen hydrogel formation is critical for the cells’ growth. Examples of properly and improperly formed hydrogels can be found in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1303-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Examples of properly (1) and improperly (2) formed Collagen Hydrogels in a 6-well plate\nAlternatives: 12 well plates can also be used for 2D Collagen cultures. Use 500 μL of neutralized Collagen solution for each well.\nEstablishing collagen monocultures\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this part of the protocol, please refer to the step-by-step protocol from Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nTiming: 6 days\nNote: Prepare Collagen hydrogels, and pre-warm ENR culture medium and PBS.\nDay 1\nTiming: 1 h\nCritical: Organoids are previously labeled with distinct fluorescent proteins.\nCheck well confluency and organoid condition under the microscope. For an example of optimal organoid density see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nRemove the ENR medium from the wells containing organoids.\nCollect Matrigel containing the organoids in 250 μL of Cell Recovery Solution. Pipet the mixture vigorously up and down to break organoids apart.\nAlternatives: If pipetting is not sufficient in this step, organoids can also be broken apart by incubating with TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C.\nTransfer the solution to a sterile 15 mL tube and incubate on ice for 30 min to dissolve Matrigel.",
    "Note: 2 full wells of organoids grown in 50 μL of Matrigel in a 24-well plate can be used for 1 well of a 6-well plate for collagen cultures.\nAfter incubation, centrifuge at 480×g for 4 min.\nRemove supernatant and continue with the cell pellet.\nOptional: If residual Matrigel is visible, add 1 mL of ice-cold PBS and repeat steps 20 and 21.\nResuspend pellet in 2 mL organoid medium supplemented with ENR and ROCK inhibitor.\nGently pipet the cell solution on top of the Collagen hydrogel.\nCritical: Pipet the mixture drop by drop to avoid breaking the Collagen hydrogel.\nDay 3 & 5\nTiming: 10 min\nNote: Pre-warm ENR culture medium.\nCheck the cells under the microscope to make sure they are attached and growing on the hydrogels.\nGently aspirate the old medium and add 2 mL of new ENR culture medium.\nNote: Cells grown on Collagen hydrogels can be split every 5–7 days. Check the confluency well under the microscope. Once the plate is at 80% proceed to passaging (steps 26–33). 1 well of a 6-well plate can be used for 2/3 new wells of a 6-well plate depending on confluency.\n2D co-culture assay\nTiming: 6 days\nNote: Prepare collagen hydrogels, and pre-warm ENR culture medium and PBS.\nNote: 3D cultures take time to adapt to the new 2D environment, for this reason it is advised to grow the organoids first as monocultures on Collagen I hydrogels for at least 1 passage before proceeding to co-cultures.\nDay 1\nCollect the Collagen hydrogels and the 2D grown cells using a 5 mL stripette with 1 mL PBS and transfer the mixture in a 15 mL tube.\nNote: For co-culture experiments, choose two lines with different fluorescent labels.",
    "Add 50 μL of Collagenase Type IV and place in the incubator at 37°C for 10 min.\nAfter incubation, add 10 mL of PBS at RT and pipet vigorously. The large volume of PBS will help to dilute out any remaining collagenase.\nCentrifuge at 480×g for 4 min.\nRemove supernatant.\nRepeat steps 28–30 two times.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL ADF medium supplemented with ENR.\nCount cells using a cell counting chamber.\nMix equal amounts of the two lines (50:50) in an organoid medium supplemented with ENR and ROCK inhibitors to a final volume of 2 mL. The cell seeding density will depend on the plate used (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1303_4.csv\nNote: The table provided gives an indication for the use of wild type organoids. If using organoids other than wild type, in which proliferation rate might differ, adjust accordingly.\nAlternatives: Other ratios of each line can be used depending on the experimental aim.\nPipette vigorously to homogenize solution\nGently pipette mixture on top of a Collagen well.\nOptional: If performing a co-culture assay with drug treatment, add your drug at the desired concentration to the culture medium and refresh according to the properties of the drug.\nAt predetermined timepoints:\nFluorescent microscopy imaging is used to analyze the size and growth of cells on the 2D co-culture.\nOptional: Flow cytometry analysis can also be performed for 2D cocultures. In this case, prepare separate wells for different timepoints.\nCritical: Washing steps are very important to remove residual Collagenase. Remnants of Collagenase can deteriorate the Collagen hydrogels.\nNote: Medium is changed every other day with a new ENR medium.\nProtocol 3. Co-culture imaging and analysis\nMicroscopy imaging\nPlace your organoid co-culture plate in the imaging system.\nBring your cells into focus.",
    "Note: To choose a focus point for 3D organoid co-cultures, go through the z planes of one well and select the plane containing most organoids in focus. Keep the same focus for all wells.\nOptimize fluorescent intensity of all required channels separately.\nCreate your own scan routine, depending on the microscope used.\nScan and save your files.\nCritical: Keep laser intensity settings equal between all conditions and for different timepoints. Focus on your co-culture using only one and the same color at every timepoint.\nNote: The imaging for this protocol was performed using an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System using GFP (excitation 470/22; emission 525/50) and Texas Red (excitation 585/29; emission 628/49) LED light cubes. Using the EVOS system, overexposed areas will turn red on the screen. For optimal fluorophore detection and analysis, set your laser intensity just below this overexposure detection. The laser intensity and detection of overexposed areas can differ depending on the microscope used.\nImage analysis\nThe image analysis for the 2D and 3D co-cultures is performed using ImageJ software. Using ImageJ, the number and size of the organoids (for 3D co-cultures) and the surface occupation (for 2D and 3D co-cultures) can be determined. Instructions and examples of image processing and analysis for 2D (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]) and 3D (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]) co-cultures are discussed below. For extensive user and troubleshooting guides, please refer to the ImageJ website (www.imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146.html[href=http://www.imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146.html]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1303-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

Boxplot visualizes minimum to maximum value, each dot represents an organoid.\n(D) Relative surface contribution can be measured over several timepoints (example).\nOpen ImageJ software\nImport the scanned images\nIn the top browser open Image → Color → Split Channels\nNote: Keep the channels based on your fluorophore open and close the channels you won’t use for the analysis. Each channel is now a single image with pixel values between 0 and 255 (for 8-bit images) which can be used for thresholding.\nOpen Image → Adjust → Color Balance\nSet display range for each individual channel\nNote: Display range will depend on laser settings. If settings were kept equal for both lasers while scanning then display range settings should be similar.\nOpen Image → Adjust → Brightness and contrast\nSet display range for individual channel\nNote: Adjusting the lower and upper limits of the display range helps to convert the informative pixels within the optimal range of 0–255. For example, adjusting the lower limit can exclude autofluorescent background signals. In addition, some fluorescent artefacts sometimes define the outer limit, which can be adjusted to the brightest true fluorescent signal. After setting the lower and upper limit, the pixel values of 0–255 will be mapped to the new display range.\nOpen Image → Adjust → Threshold and set the threshold range",
    "Note: Defining a threshold converts the pixels into binary classes, e.g. positive/negative or background/foreground. In our experiments, a threshold was used to separate the fluorescent areas from the background. Several images need to be checked so that the threshold only covers the fluorescent areas. There are various threshold algorithms to choose from, and the one that fits best to detect the fluorescent signal should be used.\nCritical: Keep the threshold algorithm and threshold values equal between all experimental conditions. For the analysis below, the ‘Default’ threshold has been used (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\nOpen Analyze → Analyze Particles:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1303_5.csv\nNote: ‘Size’ is the minimum number of pixels an object should have to be measured as an object. For our experimental 2D and 3D approaches, exclusion of measurements with <100 pixels results in significant noise reduction without loss of experimental data. The function ‘circularity’ includes or excludes objects depending on their shape, with 0.00 being the least circular and 1.00 being a perfect circle. As in our co-cultures experiments 3D organoids and 2D layers can have any possible shape, circularity function will not be used. Depending on your research question these parameters can be adapted accordingly. The ‘show’ function can be utilized to visualize the measurements being made and to validate whether the determined parameters do not lead to data loss.\nTick the box “display results” for a table containing area measurements.\nCopy/store the Area measurements and paste them in an excel sheet for analysis.",
    "Critical: Using the abovementioned protocol, area measurements will be given in pixels, which is sufficient when determining the relative surface contribution. However, to translate this data to the absolute size and surface expansion (in e.g. μm2) convert the pixel area to μm2. Depending on the imaging system used, the pixel-to- μm2 ratio is already included or can be manually entered via: analyze → set scale.\nProtocol 4. Co-culture flow cytometry and analysis\nTiming: 1 h + 30 min\nTo analyze the relative abundance of the organoids in the co-culture system, flow cytometry analysis can be performed. Organoid cultures are fluorescently labeled which enables tracing of co-culture contributions.\nOptional: When essential to determine the absolute cell numbers within a well, BD Trucount FACS tubes (BD Biosciences) can be used. These tubes contain a fixed number of beads that can be easily distinguished from your cell population in the FSC-A/SCC-A plot.\nTo prepare samples for flow cytometry analysis, refer to steps 40–51 of the ‘Sorting the organoids’ protocol described in Protocol C.\nSet up your gating strategy using samples that contain a single fluorophore. An example of a co-culture gating strategy to analyze co-cultures of mCherry and mVenus transduced organoids is presented in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1303-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. FACS analysis of 3D co-culture\n(A) Gating strategy to determine the ratio of mCherry:mVenus cells.\n(B) Example of co-culture analysis measured over several timepoints (t). Data are mean ± SD.\nCritical: This protocol describes flow cytometry analysis on the BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer, using a flow rate between 100–1000 events/second. Flow rates, lasers and laser settings may differ on distinct cell analyzers.\nDirectly before measuring your sample, add DAPI with a final concentration of 10 μM to distinguish living/dead cells.\nFirst, gate the cell population using the forward scatter (FSC)-A and side scatter (SSC)-A.",
    "To exclude doublets, use FSC-H and FSC-W density plots.\nTo select for a living cell population, gate the DAPI-negative cell population using FSC-H and 405 nanometer (nm) laser and a 450/50 nm bandpass filter.\nTo calculate the ratio of mCherry+ to mVenus+ cells, mCherry+ cells are detected using the 612/23(561) nm laser and mVenus cells are measured using a 530/30(488) nm laser."
