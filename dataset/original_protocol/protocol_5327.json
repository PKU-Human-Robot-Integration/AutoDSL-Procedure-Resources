    "Preparation of the SOR assay bufferPrepare a 70 mM Tris solution in ddH2O in a plastic beaker and adjust the pH value with 32% [wt/vol] hydrochloric acid, usually to 7.2.Note: The actual pH depends on the pH optimum of the respective SOR.Add 2% [wt/vol] elemental sulfur (sulfur flower) and 0.1% [vol/vol] Tween 20 for a better dispersal of the sulfur. Stir mixture on a magnetic stirrer for approximately 1 min.Transfer the beaker to an ice bath and disperse the elemental sulfur by sonication for 5 min with a macrotip at level 10 and 100% duty cycle.Note: The ultrasonic treatment of the almost insoluble sulfur flower in the presence of detergent will result in a finely dispersed yellow sulfur suspension.SOR activity assayStir the sonicated enzyme buffer on a magnetic stirrer and transfer 6 x 1 ml to 1.5 ml reaction tubes while continuing to stir.Preheat the reaction tubes with the enzyme buffer to the appropriate temperature for 5 min in a thermomixer with continuous shaking at 800 rpm.Note: The incubation temperature usually depends on the optimum of the respective SOR and is mostly in the range between 65 °C and 85 °C. Add 2 µg of enzyme to the first reaction tube and repeat this step every 30 sec for each consecutive tube (Figure 1). Notes:  The first addition of your enzyme to the reaction buffer corresponds to the 150 sec time point, the last addition corresponds to the 0 sec value of the enzyme assay. The amount of enzyme can be raised up to 100 µg/ml or lowered to 0.5 µg/ml depending on the specific activity of the individual SOR preparation, the assay temperature or pH in order to provide a suitable amount of product for the colorimetric assays (see below).",
    "Immediately after the enzyme addition to the last reaction tube, transfer all reaction tubes to an ice/water bath to quench the reaction. Keep the tubes for approximately 2-3 min on ice.Transfer the reaction tubes to a microcentrifuge and sediment the elemental sulfur (13,000 x g, 1 min).Use the supernatant for the three colorimetric assays (Figures 1 and 2) to quantify the reaction products. As a negative control, perform the same incubation with enzyme reaction buffer by adding water instead of enzyme solution to the reaction vials and perform the colorimetric assays accordingly. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713031241_2166.jpgFigure 1.

Polynomial (A) and linear (B) fits of thiosulfate calibration , polynomial (C) and linear (D) fits of sulfite calibration and linear fit of sulfide calibration (E); error bars from 3 replicates.Thiosulfate determinationThe quantification of thiosulfate is based on the discoloration of methylene blue (Pachmayr, 1960).Label one micro cuvette for each of the time points to be analyzed.Transfer 250 µl of the enzyme reaction mixture into an empty cuvette.Add 750 µl methylene blue solution (see Recipes). Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Determine the absorption spectrophotometrically at 670 nm against ddH2O as reference. Prepare a standard curve based on a 1 mM freshly prepared sodium thiosulfate solution (see Recipes, see Figures 2A and 2B). Perform the colorimetric assay as described above and replace the reaction mixture with different volumes of the sodium thiosulfate solution (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 75 and 100 µl; these values correspond to the same amount of thiosulfate in nmol). Make up the volume to 250 µl with ddH2O. Note: Note that there is a decrease in absorbance with an increase of the amount of thiosulfate (or concentration).",
    "Sulfite determinationThe quantification of sulfite is based on the reaction of fuchsine with sulfite. The addition of formaldehyde leads to the formation of a stable purple compound (Pachmayr, 1960).Label one 1.5 ml reaction tube for each of the time points.Transfer 50 µl fuchsine solution (see Recipes) into each reaction tube and add 200 µl ddH2O.Add 250 µl of the enzyme reaction mixture and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Pipet exactly 5 µl of 37% [wt/vol] formaldehyde into the inner lid of the reaction tube.Carefully close the reaction tube and briefly spin down the formaldehyde.Transfer the whole mixture to a cuvette using an L1000 pipette and incubate for 60 min at room temperature.Determine the absorption spectrophotometrically at 570 nm against ddH2O as reference.Prepare a standard curve based on a freshly prepared 1 mM sodium sulfite solution (see Recipes, see Figures 2C and 2D). Perform the colorimetric assay as described above and replace the reaction mixture with different volumes of the sodium sulfite solution as described above for the thiosulfate calibration curve (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 75 and 100 µl).Hydrogen sulfide determinationThe quantification of sulfide is based on the formation of methylene blue (King and Morris, 1967).Label one micro cuvette for each of the time points.Transfer 250 µl zinc acetate solution (see Recipes) into each of the cuvettes for fixation of the volatile hydrogen sulfide. Add 350 µl reaction mixture, 125 µl dimethyl-4-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride solution (see Recipes) and 50 µl iron-(III)-chloride solution (see Recipes) in the order provided. Incubate at room temperature for at least 12 h.Note: The incubation time can be extended up to 72 h if desired, e.g., over the weekend. Determine the absorption spectrophotometrically at 670 nm against ddH2O as reference.",
    "Prepare a standard curve based on a freshly prepared 1 mM ammonium sulfide solution (see Recipes, see Figure 2E). Perform the colorimetric assay as described above and replace the reaction mixture with different volumes of the ammonium sulfide solution as described above for the thiosulfate calibration curve (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 20 µl)."
