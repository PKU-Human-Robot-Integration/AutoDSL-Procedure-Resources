    "The steps below describe the production of OPGs in hydrostatic batch cultivations and the automated time-lapse acquisition of experimental images. The image analysis follows at “Data analysis”.Scanner setup (Figures 4A-4B)Connect a scanner to a computer and install scanner driver, e.g., VueScan.Set scanner settings and save program.24-bit RGB image.800 dots per inch (dpi) resolution yielding a pixel size of 32 µm. This resolution is sufficient to resolve the biological process and prevents the generation of excessively large files.Make sure there is no automatic color correction because this will complicate subsequent data analysis.Select the uncompressed Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) for saving images.Assign TIFF file names, e.g., YY-MM-DD_01+.tif and directory to save acquired scans.Set acquisition interval. Eight hours were sufficient to capture the dynamics of photogranulation. The interval can be increased as the experiment progresses.Take scanner image with a plain white sheet on top of the grid. This will be the background image for data analysis (Figure 5A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200923/20200923032322_7087.jpgFigure 4. Experimental setup. A. Light source and scanner setup (Note the cardboard box is not shown); B. Close-up of scanner setup with vials positioned on the grid.Light source setup (Figures 4A-4B)Install a flat light source above a scanner, preferably using a device that allows adjusting the distance between the light source and vials, for example by connecting it to the camera arm of a copy stand. A flexible distance makes it possible to adjust the light intensity that vials receive and allows easy placement and removal of vials.Light intensity is typically not homogeneously distributed over a LED panel. To ensure that the local light conditions are known, you can map local PAR at different points on the scanner surface, draw a contour map and decide where to place the vials, e.g., along contour lines of similar light intensities.",
    "You can design a grid with circles that indicate where to place the vials (Figure 2A). You can print the grid on paper, cut out the circles and place it on top of the desktop scanner for positioning the vials. If you want to use the grid regularly, you can make it out of a more solid material, e.g., metal (Figure 2B) using CNC metal milling or 3D printing.Adjust the distance between the vials and light source such that the light intensity at the vial positions corresponds to approximately 60 µmol·m2·s-1 PAR. This can be measured using a PAR quantum light sensor.Activated sludge sampling and characterizationSample 200 ml of activated sludge from the aeration basin of a wastewater treatment plant. This volume is largely sufficient for an experiment using 72 vials inoculated with 1.5 ml of activated sludge each, as described in the following. The sample volume needs to be adapted if you are interested in characterizing the activated sludge, e.g., total and volatile solids, chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, phosphorus, pH, chlorophyll, microbial community.It is useful to have available the measurement of total solids. This can be used to adjust the sludge concentration to a value comparable between experiments. We typically run an experiment with a concentration between 4 and 5 g/L of activated sludge.Vial preparation and placementKeep activated sludge in suspension upon arrival at the lab, e.g., using a magnetic stirrer.Note: Sludge can be stored at 4 °C when it cannot be used directly, but we recommend to use fresh activated sludge. Pipette 1.5 ml well-mixed activated sludge into 4 ml vials. Close vials with a screw cap. Our typical incubation set contains 72 vials.Place vials unagitated at the assigned areas on top of desktop scanner under constant light illumination at ambient room temperature (22-26 °C) (Figures 4A-4B).",
    "Place a light-impermeable box around the scanner and light source to limit loss of light and uncontrolled illumination of your samples.Vial incubation and time-lapse imagingStart scanner software to take an image of the bottom of the vials at the desired interval. Make sure the scanner takes an image at time 0 and that images are taken at indicated intervals.The unconsolidated sludge transforms into one OPG per vial that is typically situated at the bottom of the vial, unless it starts floating due to attached gas bubbles. Run the experiment until mature OPGs have been formed. A mature OPG is roughly spherical and remains its shape after vigorous shaking. Under the given experimental conditions, photogranulation can be expected to occur between three to six weeks. The experimental conditions, e.g., light intensity and sludge characteristics, may influence the time needed for photogranulation.Take a final scan before removing the vials from the scanner.Photogranulation successNote down whether OPGs are sitting on the bottom or floating for image analysis.Take camera images of OPGs to remember later what they looked like.Shake vials vigorously and note down in which vials a successful OPG has been formed. Photogranulation success is the percentage of successful OPGs among the total incubated vials.Characterize OPGs depending on the factors you are interested in, e.g., physicochemical parameters, microbial community."
