    "Single-cell lysis and cDNA synthesis are performed in the original plate that was used for cell sorting, which minimizes the risk for cross-contamination.When you calculate the volume of each reagent that you need, add 10% of reagent volume overage (e.g., for a full 96-well PCR plate, calculate for 105 wells), so that all the wells are filled properly. High attention when working with single cells must be considered; even talking over the plate can cause contamination. It is also very important to cautiously remove the adhesive PCR plate seals to avoid splashes. Store cDNA at -80 °C until further use. Immunoglobulin variable region gene amplification (approx. 2 days)Prepare heavy chain, lambda and kappa chain PCR master mixes for the first PCR in 3 separate tubes as described in Table 3. The targeted gene segments are all indicated in the name of the primer in Appendix[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20190827/Supplementary file Appendix.docx].Carefully add 38 μl of each PCR master mix 1 to the corresponding well and plate (heavy, kappa, or lambda) and then carefully add 3 μl of cDNA to each well.

To ensure that the master mix is not contaminated, prepare each master mix with enough volume to have one buffer control. Heavy chain, lambda and kappa chain PCRs are always performed in separate plates.  PCR products can be immediately used or stored at -20 °C until further use.Ig gene-specific PCR (approx. 4 h)Use the data generated from the IMGT/V-QUEST to identify for each PCR product (IgH, Igκ, or Igλ) the closest germline IgV and IgJ gene and to define each gene-specific primer for each well using primers described in the Appendix[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20190827/Supplementary file Appendix.docx] (Figure 3A).",
    "Prepare a pipetting scheme indicating the correct primer pairs for each well and plate (heavy, kappa, or lambda) (Figure 3B).Dilute gene-specific primers to a working concentration of 5 nmol/ml in nuclease-free water.In a 96-well plate carefully add 2 μl of the matched 5′ and 3′ primers for each individual PCR product into the same well.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190829/20190829004716_8862.jpgFigure 3.

A three-fold molar excess of insert DNA to vector should be used. The expression vectors are high copy number plasmids. High purity of cleaved vectors and PCR products is required for optimal results. To avoid self-ligation of the vector, ligase should always be added last. Transformation of DH5α cells (approx.",

Red arrow: expected size of negative colonies.Plasmid miniprep (approx. 2 days with o/n incubation)For each sample, pick 4 insert positives colonies from the backup plate using a 200 μl pipette tip and inoculate 4 ml LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in 15 ml culture tubes.Incubate the tubes overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm.After incubation, pellet bacteria by centrifuging the culture tubes for 10 min at 3360 x g. Discard the supernatant.Purify plasmids using a miniprep kit following the manufacturer’s instruction.Sequence the plasmid DNA using the (Ab sense primer) to confirm the identity with the second PCR product.Notes: Before starting the plasmid miniprep make glycerol stocks of each culture by mixing 300 μl of 1:1 sterile LB/glycerol and 400 μl of the inoculate to a 2 ml tubes, mix well and freeze at -80 °C. It’s necessary to check the complete sequence in order to verify that the PCR product is ligated in-frame within the plasmid without any introduced errors. It’s also important to check the signal peptide and the constant region sequences are correct. Sometimes miniprep sequences may not be high enough quality to generate complete sequences and it is important to repeat the procedure. Exploratory screening of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)Small scale production of mAbs (approx. 8 days with incubation)Mix 1.27 μg of total plasmid DNA for each 1 ml of cell suspension transfected. Half with heavy chain (0.635 μg/ml cell suspension) and half with light chain (0.635 μg/ml cell suspension). We recommend 30 ml cultures with 19 μg light chain and 19 μg heavy chain DNA for the initial screening.",
    "Weigh in PEI-MAX and dissolve it in OptiPRO serum free media (sfm) to make the working solution (100 μg/ml) and sterile filter the solution through a 0.22 μm filter, you need 0.05 ml working solution per ml of cell suspension to transfect.Adjust the concentration of the Expi293 cells to 2.5 x 106 cells/ml and aliquot cell suspensions to labeled cell culture shaker flasks and put the flasks into the incubator (8% CO2, 37 °C, and 125 rpm on an orbital shaker).Add working solution of PEI-MAX in OptiPRO sfm to the tubes with DNA plasmids (0.05 ml/ml cell suspension). Mix by brief vortexing and incubate for exactly 10 min at room temperature.Add the mix DNA plasmids/PEI-MAX in OptiPRO sfm media drop-wise to the cell suspension.Put the flasks back into the incubator as soon as possible.Incubate at 37 °C, 125 rpm for 6 days.After incubation, pour the cell suspension into 50 ml tubes.Centrifuge the cells for 30 min at 840 x g at room temperature.Decant the supernatant by slowly pouring into new 50 ml tubes. The cell pellet should not be disrupted.Centrifuge the supernatant for 20 min at 10,000 x g, room temperature.Filter IgG through a 0.22 μm syringe filter.Notes: The day before transfection, dilute the Expi293 cells in the EXPI293 expression medium to 1.8 x 106 cells/ml. The most critical for the expression is that the Expi293 cells are in a good growth phase and with high viability. Always sterile filter all reagents and plasmids preparations before transfection.  Always use freshly prepared PEI-MAX working solutions. During the 6 days incubation, there is no need to passage the cells or change the medium. Filter the supernatant under sterile conditions. lgG in the supernatant are stable at 4 °C for a couple of weeks, but purification is recommended as soon as possible.",

Take off supernatant using a pipette, then centrifuge again using the same program. Resuspend Protein G in DPBS to achieve a total volume of 400 μl per sample.Add 400 μl of Protein G into each tube containing the supernatant.Incubate the tubes containing supernatants and Protein G for at least 14 h at 4 °C under 25 rpm rotation.After incubation, centrifuge supernatants for 20 min at 840 x g, room temperature. In the meantime, prepare a 2 ml microtube containing 100 μl 1 M Tris (pH 8.0).Discard supernatant without disrupting pellet. Leave about 1 ml of the supernatant at the bottom with the beads.Resuspend the beads in the remaining supernatant, and transfer to the empty Bio-spin chromatography column.Wash the Protein G column three times with 2 ml DPBS each.Blot the bottom of the Bio-spin chromatography column on a paper tissue to get rid of excess flow through droplets.Add 1 ml of filtered 0.1 M glycine (pH 3.0) to the protein G resin in the Bio-spin chromatography column to elute the IgG into a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. Immediately mix with the neutralization buffer (1 M Tris, pH 8.0).Change buffer to PBS using Zeba Spin 5 ml centrifugation desalting columns.Remove the Zeba spin column’s bottom closure and place the column into a 15 ml collection tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g, discard flow-through and replace the column into the collection tube.Add 2.5 ml sterile DPBS to the column. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g and discard flow-through. Repeat this step two additional times.",
    "Blot the bottom of the column to remove excess liquid. Transfer the device to a new collection tube. Apply the eluted IgG fraction on top of the resin of the Zepa spin column.Centrifuge and retain flow-through that contains the buffer exchanged IgG. Discard spin column.After buffer exchange, measure the protein concentration using 280 nm absorbance by nanodrop, if the concentration is less than 100 μg/ml, use Amicon Ultra centrifugation units (4 ml MWCO 50 kDa) to concentrate the IgG to 100-200 μl following the manufacturer’s instruction.After buffer exchange and possibly IgG concentration, filter IgG preparations through a 0.22 μm low protein binding filter under sterile conditions.Aliquot the antibodies as following: one aliquot that can be used for ELISAs and SDS-PAGE gel and kept sterile at 4 °C; and one aliquot that should be frozen and stored at -80 °C for long term storage.Notes: Do not use brake on any of the centrifugations involving the protein G beads, even slight breaking at the end of the spin can cause the beads to fluff, making it difficult to cleanly remove the supernatant. Before starting confirm that elution glycine buffer mixing with the 1 M Tris will give pH 7. If not, adjust the volume of Tris used for neutralization. The time the antibodies are at low pH should be minimized so work fast. When you start the antibody purification, make sure that after elution, immediately buffer exchange to PBS and sterile filter through a 0.22 μm filter under the hood before storage.

    "The heavy and light chain bands differ slightly in MW from antibody to antibody but typically fall between 50 and 60 kDa for the heavy chain and 25 and 30 kDa for the light chains. Notably, some ACPA mAb carry N-linked glycosylation in the VH or VL regions that will result in a size shift or double bands on the reduced gels.

    "In this example, a positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient serum pool is used as a positive control reference for IgG anti-MDA reactivity (here dilution 1:100 is set as 100 Reactivity Units [RU]/ml) and a positive RF IgG containing RA patient serum pool is used as a positive control reference sample on the rabbit IgG surface (here dilution 1:500 is set as 100 RU/ml). Qualification of the mAb reactivity for comparison between ELISA runs can be made by fitting a linear or logarithmic line to the standard curves and extrapolating a relative reactivity in RU/ml from the absorbance values.Notes: It’s important to test all the monoclonal antibodies for BSA binding in parallel to other antigens in the same plate, to ensure that we keep a reasonable incubation time and a standard curve. The BSA assay primarily captures polyreactive antibodies binding to the plastic surface. The MDA-BSA assay can be used for identification of MDA-modified protein autoantibodies but clones that are positive for both MDA and BSA (or rabbit IgG) are considered polyreactive.  The rabbit IgG ELISA captures antibodies with rheumatoid factor activity but could also give false positivity for unstructured or aggregated IgG.Monoclonal antibodies that show binding in the BSA assay or any other control antigen are not considered as citrulline-specific antibodies.Monoclonal antibody screening for citrulline specificities (approx. 1 day)Anti-alpha enolase 1 ELISA Coat ½ area plates with citrullinated and arginine peptides (Table 7) in carbonate buffer pH 9.6, 50 μl/well overnight at 4 °C.Table 7.
