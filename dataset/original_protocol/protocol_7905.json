  "procedures": [
    "Zebrafish were raised and maintained in the Notre Dame Zebrafish facility in the Freimann Life Sciences Center. The methods described in this manuscript were approved by the University of Notre Dame Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Welfare Assurance Number A3093-01).\n1. Shuttle box learning paradigm (Figure 1A)\nNOTE: The learning paradigm provides a rapid assessment of cognition regarding associative learning.\nPrepare the shuttle box by modifying a 30.5 x 19 x 7.5 cm gel box with a 5 x 19 cm piece of aquarium grade plexiglass added to each side at a 45° angle. Make a line marking the halfway point of the tank to assess when fish have crossed the middle of the tank (Figure 1B).\nAdd 800 mL of system water to the shuttle box. Make this water by dissolving 60 mg of Instant Ocean in 1 L of deionized RO water. Fill the water to the middle of the tank to a depth of 5 cm.\n\tNOTE: Replace with fresh system water at 28 °C every h or after testing 3 fish.\nPlace 2-3 fish into a holding tank containing system water, located in a dark room where the shuttle box assay will be performed.\n\t\nIn the dark room, place 1 fish in the center of the shuttle box, secure the lid, and attach the electrodes to a power supply.\n\t\tNOTE: The room should remain as dark as possible during acclimation and testing.\nAcclimate the fish in the shuttle box for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The investigator should remain in the room during the acclimation period or return to the testing room quietly with ample time before the testing to allow fish to adjust to the investigator's presence. Successful acclimation can be considered when the fish freely explores the tank.",
    "If the fish fails to explore, continue acclimation for an additional 15 min. If the fish still fails to acclimate to the shuttle box, remove the fish. Do not use this fish for testing.\nManually shine an 800-lumen red lens flashlight ~2 cm from the gel box wall on the side occupied by the fish, following acclimation.\n\tNOTE: Do not start a trial if the fish is resting next to the platinum wire against the wall near the deep ends of the shuttle box.\nShine the light stimulus directly on the fish and manually follow any lateral movement of the fish with the light to ensure continual visualization of the stimulus (Figure 1C). Continue to provide the light stimulus until either of the following conditions are met.\n\t\nConsider the trail successful if the fish crosses over the halfway point of the tank within the 15 s of light exposure. Once the fish crosses the halfway point, stop the light stimulus immediately (Figure 1D).\nConsider the trail as failed if the fish does not cross over the halfway point of the box in 15 s. In this case, use an electrophoresis power supply to apply a negative shock stimulus (20 mV:1 A) alternating 2 s of On, 2 s of Off for a 15 s period (maximum of 4 shocks), or until the fish passes the halfway point of the box, at which point terminate both the light and negative stimulus.\nLet the fish rest for 30 s and repeat step(s) 1.5-1.6.2. Keep a detailed record of the order of successful trials (1.6.1) and failed trials (1.6.2).\n\tNOTE: Here, we defined learning as the completion of 5 consecutive successful trials. Once the learning has been demonstrated, the fish should be removed from the shuttle box and humanely euthanized.",
    "2. Memory paradigm (Figure 1A)\nNOTE: This paradigm provides an assessment of the short and long-term memory of a learned associative cognitive task.\nTraining Period\n\t\nAdd 800 mL of system water to the shuttle box. Make this water by dissolving 60 mg of Instant Ocean in 1 L of deionized RO water. Fill the water to the middle of the tank to a depth of 5 cm.\n\t\tNOTE: Water should be replaced with fresh system water at 28 °C every h or after testing 3 fish.\nPlace 2-3 fish into a holding tank that contains system water, located in a dark room where the shuttle box assay will be performed.\nIn the dark room, place 1 fish in the center of the shuttle box, secure the lid, and attach the electrodes to a power supply.\n\t\tNOTE: The room should remain as dark as possible during acclimation and testing.\nAcclimate fish in the shuttle box for 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The investigator should remain in the room during acclimation period or return to the testing room quietly with ample time prior to testing to allow fish to adjust to the investigator's presence. Determine successful acclimation when the fish is freely exploring the tank.\nIf the fish fails to explore, continue acclimation for an additional 15 min. If the fish still fails to acclimate to the shuttle box, remove the fish and do not use it for testing.\nAfter the successful acclimation, manually shine an 800-lumen red lens flashlight ~2 cm from the gel box side wall, on the side of the shuttle box that is occupied by the fish.\nShine the light stimulus directly on the fish and follow any lateral movement of the fish with the light to ensure continual visualization of the stimulus by the fish.",
    "While the light is shining on the fish, simultaneously apply the adverse shock stimulus (20 mV:1 A) alternating 2 s On, 2 s Off for 15 s (maximum of 4 shocks), or until the fish passes the halfway point of the box. Once this is achieved, terminate both the light and the adverse stimulus.\n\t\tNOTE: Allow the fish to rest for 30 s then repeat step 2.1.6-2.1.8 for 25 iterations (Figure 1A).\nInitial testing\n\t\nAllow 15 min of rest to the fish following the training period. Do not remove them from the shuttle box. Test initial memory retention by recording each trial as strictly pass/fail, immediately following this rest period.\nApply only the light stimulus for up to 15 s and record the responses as follows.\n\t\t\nConsider the trial successful if the fish crosses over the halfway point of the shuttle box within 15 s after starting the light stimulus. Stop the light stimulus immediately when the fish crosses the halfway point.\nConsider the trial as failed if the fish does not cross over the halfway point of the shuttle box 15 s after starting the light stimulus. Stop the light stimulus after 15 s.\n\t\t\tNOTE: During the initial testing, an adverse stimulus is not applied following a failed attempt.\nRepeat step 2.2.2, with a 30 s rest period between trials, and record successful trials (2.2.2.1) and failed trials (2.2.2.2) across 25 trials. This value will serve as an individual reference for each fish.\nImmediate memory\n\t\nInduce injury immediately following the initial testing period by preferred damage paradigm (e.g., a blunt-force trauma using the modified Marmarou weight drop). House fish individually for an easy identification. Record their initial testing values and return fish to the animal facility.\n\t\t​NOTE: Fish were injured by blunt-force TBI as previously described22.",
    "Gather 2-3 undamaged or TBI fish 4 h after initial testing and/or 4 h post-injury (or at the experimental timeframe in question) from the animal facility. Keep all fish in the dark room in individual tanks containing system water.\nPlace fish in the center of the shuttle box (prepared with system water as described in 1.1), one fish at a time, and secure the lid. Attach the power supply and allow the fish to acclimate for 15 min.\nFollowing acclimation, assess immediate memory (strictly pass/fail) by applying only the light stimulus for up to 15 s and record the responses as follows.\n\t\t\nConsider the trial successful if the fish crosses over the halfway point of the box within the 15 s test period. Terminate the light stimulus upon crossing the halfway point.\nConsider the trial as failed if the fish does not cross over the halfway point of the box within 15 s of starting the light stimulus. Terminate the light stimulus after 15 s period is over.\n\t\t\tNOTE: During this post-injury testing, adverse shock stimulus is not applied following a failed attempt.\nRepeat step 2.3.4, with a 30 s rest period between trials, and record the number of successful trials (2.3.4.1) and failed trials (2.3.4.2) across 25 trials.\nCalculate the percent difference in successful trials post-injury to the initial testing period using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62745/62745eq01.jpg\nDelayed memory\n\t\nReturn fish, housed individually for easy identification and recording of their initial testing values, to the animal facility immediately following the initial testing period.\nAllow fish 4 days (or the experimental timeframe in question) between the initial testing and injury and/or delayed memory testing.",
