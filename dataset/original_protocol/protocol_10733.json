    "1. Graphene-coating of NiTi\nThe  graphene samples used in this study were grown on copper (Cu) substrates using the  chemical vapor deposition technique, and subsequently transferred to 4.5 mm2NiTi  substrates.\nCu  foils (1 cm x 1 cm) were placed in a 1 in. quartz tube furnace and heated to 1,000  °C in the presence of 50 sccm of H2 and 450 sccm of Ar.\nNext,  methane (1 and 4 sccm) was introduced into the furnace at different flow rates  for 20-30 min. The samples were finally cooled to room temperature under  flowing H2, Ar and CH4.\nNext,  the Cu foils were spin-coated with PMMA (diluted with 4% anisole) at 4,000 rpm  followed by a heat treatment for 5 min at 150 °C. Graphene attached  to PMMA layer was obtained by etching the Cu foil using Transene Inc., CE-100  etchant, and subsequent rinsing in 10% HCl and de-ionized water for 10 min.\nThe  samples were transferred to NiTi substrates (4.5 mm2) and annealed  at 450  °C in Ar (300 sccm) and H2 (700 sccm) for 2 hr to  remove the PMMA. Finally, the substrates were washed with acetone to dissolve the  residual PMMA to obtain the Gr-NiTi sample. A Dilor XY triple grating  monochromator was used for the micro-Raman characterization (using 100X  objective) of all Gr-NiTisamples with the 514.5 nm excitation from an Ar+  ion laser.\n2. In Vitro Toxicity of Gr-NiTi\nRat  aortic endothelial cells (Cell application Inc.,) were cultured on a gelatin  coated 8 chambers slide. For testing the cell growth, pristine and  Gr-NiTisubstrates were placed in wells without any gelatin coating. Scanning  electron microscopy images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM.  Additionally, rat aortic smooth muscle cells were also grown in CellBind  96-well plates as a control group (Corning) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium  (ATCC).",
    "For  testing cell viability, cells (both endothelial and smooth muscle cells) were  seeded at 105 cells/well in wells containing pristine NiTi, 1 sccm  or 4 sccm Gr-NiTi substrates, where the stated sccm corresponds to the methane  flow used in the CVD growth of graphene. Cells were grown for the desired time  period in an incubator at 37  °C and 5% CO2, exchanging media every  other day.\nAt  the end time point, media was removed and fresh media containing 0.5 mg/ml  thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (or MTT obtained from Sigma) was added to  each well. Cells were then incubated for  an additional 3 hr. For the MTS  assay, media was removed at the final time point and replaced with 120 μl of  MTS working solution (Cell Tier 96 aqueous, Promega) and incubated for 3 hr.\nNext,  media was gently removed and 100 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma) was added to  each well. After allowing 10 min for  the MTT crystals to dissolve, the solution was transferred to another well plate. For the MTS assay, no dimethylsulfoxide was  added to the wells. Well contents were  moved to a new plate.\nAbsorbance  was read at 490 nm and the percent viability was determined by normalizing  absorbance to the average absorbance of the pristine NiTi sample.   At  least five repeats were done for each sample type.\n3. Confocal Microscopy Studies of Cell Morphology\nFor  confocal imaging of rat aortic smooth muscle cells, substrates were placed in  an 8-chamber slide (Thermo Scientific). The cells were seeded at 25,000  cells/chamber and incubated for 3 days at 37  °C and 5% CO2.\nCells  were fixed on the substrate with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline  for 20 min.\nPermeabilized  with 0.1% Triton-X for 1 min.",
    "Actin  was stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Life Technologies). 100 μl of alexafluor 488 phalloidin at 200 units/ml in  methanol was added to 1.9 ml of phosphate buffered saline. Cells were stained  with 250 μl of alexafluor 488  phalloidin for 45 min and then washed twice with phosphate buffered saline.\nNuclei  were mounted with VectaShield fluorescent mounting medium containing DAPI  (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were collected using a Nikon Confocal  TI. A chamber seeded with cells without  any substrate was used as a control.\n4. Protein Adsorption Studies\nSubstrate  dimensions were measured with calipers before starting the protein adsorption  experiments. Three measurements were  taken for each side of the approximately square samples and averaged to get the  length and width.\nEach  sample, pristine NiTi, 1sccm and 4sccm Gr-NiTiwere incubated with 1 mg/ml  albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 1 mg/ml fibrinogen in PBS at room  temperature for 3 hr.\nAlike  samples were combined in a microcentrifuge tube with 200 μl of reducing sample  buffer and boiled for 5 min.\nSamples  were then diluted in a Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer (Bio-Rad) and run through a  4-15% Tris polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (Bio-Rad) at 90 V for 100 min.\nGels  were then stained with SYPRO Red. Dilute SYPRO Red (Life Technologies) stock  solution at 1:5,000 in 7.5 v/v% acetic acid. Stain gels for 60 min.\nImage  gels using a Flourchem SP (Alpha Innotech).Fluorescent intensity was quantified  using ImageJ software. Fluorescent  intensity from each sample was normalized by the total area of substrate and  fibrinogen adsorption was compared to albumin adsorption.\n5. Western Blotting for Protein Expression\nWestern  blot was performed to analyze total actin in rat aortic smooth muscle  cells. Cells were seeded at 10,000  cells/substrate in a 96-well plate.",
    "Cells  were grown for three days before removing media. Total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer  and a standard BCA assay (Lamda) was performed to quantify total protein.\nSamples  were diluted to the same concentration in RIPA and then boiled in a reducing  sample buffer for 5 min.\nProteins  were separated by a 4-15% Tris polyacrylamide gel via electrophoresis at 90 V  for 100 min. A kaleidoscope protein standard (Bio-Rad) was used to assess  protein molecular weight.\nProteins  were transferred to a PVDF membrane and blocked with a 1% non-fat dry milk  (Bio-Rad) solution.\nTotal  actin was tagged with a rabbit anti-rat actin antibody (Sigma). A BM  chemiluminescent kit (Roche) was used to detect the primary antibody. Membranes were imaged using FlourChem SP  imaging equipment and fluorescent intensity was measured using ImageJ software. Fluorescent  intensity was normalized by comparing to the pristine NiTisample.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
