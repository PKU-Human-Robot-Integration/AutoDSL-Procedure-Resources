  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All procedures are in accordance with an animal protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Southern California.\n1. Preparation for Surgery\nLay out the necessary surgical tools and supplies (sterilized, items 1 - 18 in Materials list) and arrange a dissecting microscope and a fiber optics trans-illuminator in a hood or on a downdraft table.\nPlace a sexually mature mouse (20 - 30 g, 1 - 3 months old) in an induction chamber with 4% isoflurane to induce anesthesia.\nConfirm anesthesia with a paw and/or tail pinch test.\nApply ointment to the mouse’s eyes to avoid eye dryness during the surgery.\nMove the mouse to the microscope stage. Place the mouse into the nose cone of the maintenance hose and position laterally. Provide a warming pouch adjacent to the animal to help maintain body temperature.\n\tNOTE: Position of the mouse is dependent on personal preference and/or handedness of the surgeon., either left or right side is fine.\nAdjust isoflurane to 2 - 3% for maintenance, and watch breathing rate.\nInject buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously (lateral flank of the leg) for post-surgery pain with a 25 G needle. The leg may twitch which is a normal response.\n2. Opening Incision\nDetect the desired rib by palpation, and clear the area of hair with a shaver.\n\tNOTE: Ribs 8-10 are recommended since ribs 1-7 are closer to the lungs and 11-13 are considerably shorter. Counting the ribs should begin with the most rostral rib as number 1.\nPrepare the area with alternating povidone-iodine and isopropanol (70%) swabbing (3x is often recommended by animal use protocols).",
    "Cut a 2 cm incision through the skin, directly above and parallel to the desired rib with medium sized microsurgery scissors. Incise through the underlying muscle and fat layers.\nPlace all 3 layers (skin, muscle, fat) into a retractor to expose the surgical area, while minimizing the size of the incision.\n3. Excising the Rib\nCut through the intercostal muscles overlying the desired section of rib with a 5.0 mm scalpel. Position this incision around 5 mm proximal to the chondrocostal joint as this is where the rib is not as highly curved. Carefully separate the muscle from the bone with fine tip forceps.\nTo create a resection while retaining the periosteum in the animal, cut through the periosteum, along the length of rib with a 5.0 mm scalpel. Carefully separate the periosteum from the underlying bone laterally with fine tip forceps. Proceed with caution, as the periosteum is very delicate and has a gelatinous consistency.\nNext make a cross-section through the bone at one end with fine micro-scissors. If needed, measure the resection with a reticle in the microscope or a ruler type gauge. Then carefully lift the bone out of the periosteum and cut the other end.\n\tNOTE: Proceed with caution. This is the most delicate step, as pulling up without excising the rib below will tear the pleural membrane and result in a pneumothorax. If the pleural membrane is torn this will be readily evident as the interior of the thoracic cavity will become visible.\nIf bleeding occurs as a result of cutting the bone, apply pressure at the cut end with a cotton-tipped swab for 4 - 5 sec to stop the bleeding.",
    "NOTE: On the rare occasion that bleeding continues, it may be necessary to stop and euthanize the animal as significant blood loss will compromise recovery (without fluid replacement, the maximum blood volume which can be safely be lost is 10% of the total blood volume or 7.7 - 8 µl/g. For a 25 g mouse, this is equivalent to around 180 - 200 µl9).\nImmediately place the removed rib into 4% PFA for future analysis.\n\tNOTE: If the resection of both the bone and the periosteum is to be carried out, omit the periosteum incision and separation (step 3.2). Since the periosteum is very tightly attached to the pleural membrane proceed cautiously, teasing the rib away from the pleural membrane with forceps to avoid tearing.\n4. Closing the Incision\nSuture the intercostal muscles over the top of the remaining periosteal sleeve with 9-0 sutures (2 sutures are usually sufficient). Place the sutures directly above the cut ends of the rib, to act as indicators for surgery location.\nRemove the retractor. Suture the overlying muscle and fat with 9-0 sutures (3 - 4 sutures are usually sufficient). In mice with particularly thick layers of muscle and/or fat, suture each layer separately (e.g., 1 layer of sutures for the muscular layer and 1 layer of sutures for the fatty layer).\nClose the skin with 7-0 sutures (4 - 5 sutures are usually sufficient).\nSecure the incision with suture glue, pinching the edges together with large forceps.\nSlowly wean the mouse off isoflurane by first adjusting to 1% for few minutes and then turn off.",
    "Place the mouse under a heat lamp and leave until consciousness is regained, 5 - 10 min. After consciousness is regained and throughout the healing period, the mouse should move and ambulate normally and show no signs of distress.\n5. Recovery and Analysis\nProvide post-operative pain management including the administration of buprenorphine in an oral gelatin form at 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hr for 48 hr. Oral administration does not require restraining the animal which might cause pain to the thoracic region.\nMaintain the mouse in a cage with free access to food and water during the healing period. After the incision is dry, female animals can be co-housed while males must remain isolated to prevent fighting.\nAfter the healing period, follow the approved procedure for euthanasia. Remove the rib cage for fixation and analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
