    "All animal procedures and animal care methods should be approved by the institution's Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC). \n1. Surgical Preparation\nAssemble all necessary surgical tools and reagents: forceps, vana scissors, roungeurs, retractor, scalpels, scissors, sutures, skin staples, Q-tips, sterile saline, surgical sponges, and isoflurane. Prepare and autoclave a complete pack of surgical tools prior to surgery. If performing surgeries on more than one mouse, prepare and autoclave one packet of tools per animal, or autoclave one packet of surgical instruments and sterilize with a tool sterilizer in between surgeries. Generally, one pack of sterilized tools can be used on up to 5 mice if a glass bead tool terilizer is used to clean tools in-between surgeries (after 5 animals the tools must be re-cleaned and sterilized before use). Please check with your local IACUC administrator for institution specific guidelines.\nSterilize the surgical field with 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes. Set up surgical drapes to ensure a sterile field is maintained during surgery.\nWeigh each mouse prior to surgery. Administer a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight of buprenorphine, subcutaneously.\nAnesthetize the animal by administering isoflurane at a dose of 4% in the induction chamber of isoflurane machine.\nOnce the animal is anesthetized, apply ointment to the eyes to prevent dehydration, set the animal on a heating pad at 37 °C, and ensure that the mouse’s head is properly situated in the anesthesia cone. (Note: Use a heating source that will not cause thermal burns; i.e., a circulating water blanket, hot water bottle, or equivalent.) At this point administer a dose of 2% isoflurane to the animal.\nShave the dorsal surface of the mouse, approximately 1 cm around the intended incision location.",
    "Disinfect the incision site by washing with 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes, then with an iodine solution (10% Povidone-iodine, 1% available iodine). Repeat 3 times.\n2. Dorsal Laminectomy\nBefore making an incision, ensure that the animal is properly anesthetized by checking for reflexes using the toe or tail pinch method.\nMake an incision along the dorsal spine with scalpel and blade, and then check for reflexes again. Arch the back to help properly visualize landmarks, such as the boundaries between vertebrae.\nCut through the skin. Insert retractor to hold skin and fascia back from the spinal cord. Clear the tissue on either side of the spinal cord to expose the muscles covering the spine.\n\tNOTE: The surgeon should be familiar with the anatomical landmarks. For example, the inferior angle of the scapula corresponds with T7. The top of the natural curve of the mouse’s spinal is T12 and may be used as a reference point.\nWith proper lighting, determine the space between the vertebrae. Find the posterior end of T10 and cut muscles and fascia perpendicular to the intervertebral disk space. Cut just enough to expose the spinous process and posterior lamina of T10.\nUsing a pair of fine tipped Dumont #5 forceps, remove some of the tissue from the lamina and spinous process to expose a small sliver of the spinal cord. When necessary, use tissue forceps to stabilize the spinal column.\nPerform the laminectomy by inserting one side of a pair of small vana scissors along the dorsolateral side of the vertebra and just beneath the lamina.\n\t\nMake small, careful snips to cut through the lateral side of the vertebral lamina. Ensure that no pressure is applied to the spinal cord.\nRepeat on the other side.",
    "Apply gentle pressure to halt bleeding as necessary with a Q-tip or surgical sponge, taking care to not apply pressure to the spinal cord.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare gel foam soaked in sterile saline in the event that bleeding needs to be controlled.\nOnce the incisions have been made, lift off the dorsal aspect of the vertebra and gently clear any tissue attachments. Use appropriate means to control bleeding if necessary.\n3. Spinal Cord Compression\nUsing roungeurs or laminectomy forceps, ensure that the lateral sides of the spinal cord are free of vertebral bone so that the calibrated forceps for the compression injury can situate on either side of the spinal cord. The arms of the forceps must be able to be placed within the epidural space on adjacent sides of the spinal cord and the tips of the forceps must be able to reach the floor of the vertebral canal.\n\t\nEnsure that visibility of the spinal cord is good.\nSituate the calibrated Dumont #5 forceps approximately in the middle of the exposed segment of the spinal cord. Recall that the arms of the forceps must be placed within the epidural space on adjacent sides and the tips must touch the floor of the vertebral canal to generate reproducible injuries.\nCarefully compress the spinal cord until the spacers connect. Hold in place for 15 sec.\nGently release the compressive force and remove the calibrated forceps from the spinal cord. Sterile saline should be used to regain homeostasis before the wound is closed.\n4. Wound Closing\nCarefully suture the muscle layer over the spinal cord, taking care to not disrupt or apply pressure to the spinal cord.\nUse either sutures or staples to close the skin over the wound.\nIf using gas anesthetic, begin to taper/turn off the anesthetic.",
    "Administer 0.1 ml of lactated ringers per 10 g body weight to help account for dehydration during the surgery and after the surgery when the animal is lethargic and recovering from the injury. The solution should be warmed to body temperature prior to injection.\nPlace the mouse in a bedding-free cage. The cage should rest on top of a heating pad (as described in 1.1.5) in a manner that allows half of the cage area to be on the pad, while the other half is resting on a RT counter, in order to give the mouse climate options once it is ambulatory. Take care to ensure that the “recovery cage” is located in a quiet environment. Closely monitor the animal until it has regained consciousness, at which time the mouse can be transferred to a regular cage with bedding.\n5. Post-operative Care\nAfter the surgery, administer a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight buprenorphine subcutaneously every 12 hr for the first 3 days after surgery, and then as needed to manage symptoms of pain.\nAdminister a dose of lactated ringers (0.1 ml per 10 g body weight subcutaneously) for the first 3 - 5 days after surgery. Give this dose if/when the animal begins to exhibit signs of dehydration outside of this initial time period.\nManually express the bladder of the animals using the Crede maneuver twice daily. Gently palpate the animal’s abdomen to locate the bladder, and then apply gentle downward pressure until the bladder is empty.\n\t\nIf the bladder does not empty or the urine is bloody or cloudy, administer 50 mg/kg by body weight of Baytril to the animal via interperitoneal injection for 10 days.",
    "Monitor animals for signs of autophagy, dehydration, and excessive weight loss (greater than 20% of body weight). If an animal experiences any of these symptoms please consult with a veterinarian immediately with regards to treatment options, or euthanize the animal in a humane manner following IACUC guidelines.\n\t\nGiven that mobility may be limited right after surgery, take the necessary steps to make sure animals have access to food and water. Pre-packaged wet food, as well as hydrogel, can be made available to animals in these instances.\n6. Assess Tissue Damage Resulting from Compression Injury\nAnesthetize animal as described in steps 1.4 and 1.5. Check depth of anesthesia by toe pinch and monitoring corneal blink reflexes. When the animal is insensitive to stimuli, proceed to step 6.2.\nPerform an intracardial perfusion10.\n\t\nExpose the chest cavity and insert a needle into the left ventricle. Flush out existing fluids with 20 - 30 ml ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 15 - 25 ml of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nRemove the spinal cord.\n\t\nCut the skin dorsal to the spinal cord and clear away any excess tissue surrounding the length of the spinal column.\nExcise spinal column and cut away any remaining tissue. The actual level of the laminectomy and injury can be confirmed by counting ribs.\nUse vanna scissors and forceps to displace small sections of the spinal column in a caudal-to-rostral direction. Continue to cut until the cord is exposed enough to allow safe removal. Visualization of the cutting location and process can be facilitated through the use of a stereoscope.\nPlace spinal cord tissue in 4% PFA. Allow tissue to post-fix in this solution for 24 hr at 4 °C.\nCryoprotect tissue by incubating in 30% sucrose for 24 hr at 4 °C.",
    "Embed tissue in OCT. Briefly, take tissue from the 30% sucrose incubation and remove any excess solution. Place the tissue into a cryomold filled with OCT and incubate for 1 hr at 4 °C.\n\t\nRemove mold from 4 °C, confirm directional orientation of the tissue, put the mold in a shallow dish of 2-methylbutane (pre-chilled for 1 hr on dry ice) and allow OCT to completely solidify. Keep on dry ice if using immediately or store at -80 °C.\nCut the tissue into 20 µm sagittal sections using a cryostat. Mount tissue directly onto slides. Store at -20 °C until use.\nPerform Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain.\n\t\nBriefly, rehydrate the tissue (5 min, 2 times), stain with Hematoxylin (2.5 min), and wash with water (1 min, 2 times).\nIncubate tissue in 50% and then 70% ethanol (3 min each), stain with Eosin (45 sec), and dehydrate by incubation in 90% (5 sec), 95% (5 sec), 100% ethanol (2 min), and isopropanol (2 min).\nClear with xylene (5 min, 3 times).\n\t\tNOTE: H&E staining will vary with specific tissue thickness and conditions. Therefore, standardization is required before proceeding with experimental tissues samples.\nCover tissue with a thin strip of Permount (~100 µm) and coverslip. Press down on all sides of coverslip to ensure proper distribution of fluid. Let slides dry O/N.\nVisualize tissue sections using a digital microscope and capture images using the accompanying software."
