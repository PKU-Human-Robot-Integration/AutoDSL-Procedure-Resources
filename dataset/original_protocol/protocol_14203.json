    "All steps taken within this protocol were approved in accordance with the Research Ethics Board at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital. All participants provided consent prior to their participation in this research protocol/data collection.\n1. Obtain Pre-injury Demographic and Symptom Profile on Participant\nEnsure all material is prepared and functioning for data collection (chest strap, sensor, and watch; see Table of Materials) as well as relevant demographic collection, concussion symptom scale, and physical activity forms. Prior to the participant's arrival, remind participant to wear comfortable clothing, which includes a light t-shirt.\nAfter obtaining parental and participant consent, request that the participant fill out the demographic collection form, which includes age, sex, diagnosed learning disabilities, other medical diagnoses, and previous history of concussion (number and recency of injuries).\nInstruct the participant to complete the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTE)23.\nInstruct the participant to complete the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI)24.\n\tNOTE: There are various PCSI versions, which correspond to relevant developmental age ranges (i.e., 5 to 12 year olds; 13 to 18 year olds).\nMeasure and record the participants' height and weight.\nScore and record the GLTE and PCSI. When scoring the PCSI, record both the total score as well as the four domain scores (i.e., physical, cognitive, emotional, fatigue).\nEnter all demographic, physical activity and symptom scale information into a database.\n2. Obtain Pre-injury Physiological Profile on Participant",
    "NOTE: It is important to note that delineating a weekday versus a weekend or specific time of day for data collection is not always feasible given the busy school and sport schedule of the youth athlete. Protocols should take every effort to ensure consistency, or account for time of day in data analyses to address the natural variations in autonomic nervous system function. Further, if a participant sustains a concussion, but their baseline value was collected more than one year following the date of their concussion, the baseline value should not be considered accurate for the purposes of pre-post comparisons25.\nSelect appropriate chest strap size (XS/S or M/XXL), according to circumference of participant's torso.\nTo ensure accurate chest strap placement, place the strap around the torso of the participant (note: while participant is clothed with a t-shirt) and adjust the strap to reflect a tight, yet comfortable fit.\nEnsure the strap is securely fitted about the sternum, on the xiphoid process. Do not instruct the participant to place the strap directly onto their skin at this time.\nConnect the heart rate sensor to the chest strap by securing the clip-on buttons, ensuring the sensor is right side up.\nUsing hypoallergenic electrode gel, apply a small/modest amount of gel to the conductive plastic surface of the chest strap.\nProvide instructions to the participant to access a private area or washroom so the participant can place the chest strap directly onto their skin.\nOrient the participant to the chest strap clasp to ensure ease in securing the strap.\nInstruct the participant to ensure that the sensor should be placed directly onto the xiphoid process of the sternum and right side up to ensure optimal heart rate recording.",
    "Provide the participant with the watch, instructing them not to remove the watch throughout the 24 h recording duration.\nProvide the participant with a trouble-shooting instruction sheet (in the event the watch accidently stops recording). The trouble-shooting instruction sheet should explicitly outline how to re-start the watch recording and how to re-apply the heart rate monitor with electrode gel, adjust the strap, and ensure the sensor is right side up. Given the length of recording time and the potential for inconsistent recording length across participants, use rigorous data analysis methods to filter and account for this discrepancy; please see Paniccia et al.26 for further details on these approaches.\nInclude an area on this instruction sheet for the participant to record when they went to sleep and when they woke up. Also, encourage participants to report on other physical activities they engage in while wearing the heart rate equipment (e.g., going for a long walk).\nRemind the participant that participation in contact sport, swimming, and bathing are not permitted while wearing the heart rate technology. However, the participant is permitted to shower with these items on.\nEncourage the participant to go about their typical activities as they would on a daily basis.\n3. Performing Post-concussion Follow-up Assessment\nSchedule a follow-up assessment on the same day that the participant or legal guardian/caregiver indicates a concussive injury (or as soon as possible). Instruct the participant to receive a concussion diagnosis from a physician if they haven't already done so.\nEnsure all material is prepared and functioning for data collection; this includes the heart rate recording equipment (chest strap, sensor, and watch) and relevant demographic collection, symptom scale, and physical activity forms. Prior to the participant's arrival, remind participant to wear comfortable clothing, which includes a light t-shirt.",
    "Complete the Acute Concussion Evaluation form5 to collect information on the mechanism of injury and post-injury sequelae (e.g., loss of consciousness, retrograde amnesia).\nAdminister the GLTE to capture change in physical activity repertoire.\nAdminister the PCSI to determine number and severity of symptoms.\nCollect HRV data and repeat steps 2.1 to 2.7.\nWhile the participant is symptomatic, schedule weekly follow-up assessments and re-administer PCSI and collect HRV data (steps 3.3 and steps 2.1 to 2.7).\nWhen the participant's symptoms have abated (returned to baseline level), schedule 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. At these time points, re-administer GLTE, PCSI and collect HRV data (steps 3.4 and 3.5, and steps 2.1 to 2.7).\n4. Collect Matched Control Participant Data Across Follow-up Assessment Time Points\nUtilizing the baseline/pre-injury dataset, generate a list of potential participants, age and gender matched to the concussed participants. Ensure the birthdate of the potential control participant is within 6 months of the concussed participant.\nContact control participants and schedule follow-up assessments, with no more than 3-4 days from the concussed participant follow-up date.\nReplicate above testing protocol to the matched control (i.e., same number of follow-up assessments).\nOn the first follow-up assessment, repeat steps 1.1 to 1.7 and steps 2.1 to 2.7.\nOn subsequent follow-up assessments, repeat steps 3.1 to 3.7 (excluding step 3.3).\n5. Uploading and Processing HRV Data\nConnect watch to a computer with the provided USB Transfer cable and upload the heart rate data to the software program provided with the sensor. Next, transfer this specific (.hrm) file and upload the data to the data analysis software (see Table of Materials).",
    "To filter ectopic beats and correct artifacts, select the \"very low\" filter; this is the lowest correction level to maintain the integrity of the raw data. Visual inspection of data files is highly recommended for small datasets and within-participant analyses.\nIn line with recommendations from the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology12, ensure the frequency domain variable bandwidths are selected as follows: HF (0.15 to 0.4Hz); LF (0.04 to 0.15Hz).\nSelect a 300 s window frame, 50% overlap.\nSelect an interpolation rate of 4Hz.\nSelect the Fast Fourier Transform for power spectral analysis.\nSave the HRV data as an hrm file for potential data analysis in robust statistical software."
