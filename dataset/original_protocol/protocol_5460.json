    "Chromoplast protein isolation from Capsicum annuum Collect 300 g of exocarp (with some mesocarp) from red pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum).For this, cut the pepper fruit in strips lengthwise (Figures 2A-2D). Now cut off most of the mesocarp tissue and collect the outer exocarp (Figure 2E). Cut the exocarp (Figure 2F) in smaller pieces to facilitate grinding.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170915/20170915002405_2723.jpgFigure 2. Isolation of pepper fruit mesocarp tissue. A. Entire fruit; B. Halved fruit; C. Detail of B showing exocarp (outside the dotted line) and mesocarp (inside the dotted line); D. Sliced pepper fruit; E. Separation of exocarp from mesocarp with a knife; F. Isolated exocarp.Blend the exocarp with 400 ml of cold (4 °C) chromoplast isolation buffer (see Recipes) in a fruit juicer or Sorvall mixer, with lowest setting and for three 10 sec-pulses in the Sorvall mixer, or for 30 sec in the fruit juicer. After blending, the tissue should be entirely disintegrated. Avoid warming up of the extract.Filter the extract through two layers of miracloth placed in a glass funnel into the 500 ml polypropylene bottles for centrifugation.Centrifuge for 10 min, 12,000 x g at 4 °C ( JLA-10.500  rotor).Discard supernatant by pouring it into the waste. Do this step quickly since the pellet is not very stable.Carefully resuspend the pellet in 100 ml chromoplast isolation buffer using fine strokes of a paint brush.Centrifuge for 10 min, 12,000 x g at 4 °C ( JLA-10.500  rotor).Resuspend the pellet in 8 ml of 25 mM Tris-MES (see Recipes) pH 8, this time without the paint brush, but by pipetting the solution up and down. Transfer to 50 ml polypropylene tubes by pipetting.Break chromoplasts by pressing them 10 times through a syringe with a 0.6 mm needle. For this, the solution is sucked-in and pushed-out through the 0.",
    "6 mm needle using a 10 ml syringe. Avoid sucking of air.Centrifuge for 10 min, 15,000 x g at 4 °C ( JA-25.50  rotor).Transfer the supernatant to 13.2 ml allomer tubes by pipetting.Fractionate in a soluble and membrane fraction by ultra-centrifugation for 1 h, 150,000 x g at 4 °C (SW-41Ti rotor).Resuspend the obtained membrane pellet in 8 ml of 25 mM Tris-MES pH 8 and push 10 times through a syringe with a 0.6 mm needle as above.Chromoplast membranes can now be used for hydroxylation assays or can be stored for later use at -80 °C.Freeze aliquots of 1-2 ml of the Chromoplast membranes in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.Hydroxylation assayMix all compounds on ice in a 2 ml tube except for the substrate (epi-pFCC) according to the following:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170915/20170915002549_7403.jpgStart enzyme assay by adding the substrate to the mix from above.Incubate at room temperature in darkness for up to 40 min.Terminate the reaction by adding 50 µl of methanol.Centrifuge for 2 min, 16,000 x g at 4 °C (Biofuge).Transfer supernatant to a new tube by pipetting (avoid transferring particles from the pellet). Repeat centrifugation to get rid of any particles, which could block the HPLC or LC-MS/MS tubing.Analyze supernatant of the samples by HPLC or by LC-MS/MS for formation of epi-pFCC-OH (Hauenstein et al., 2016)."
