    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of bone marrow progenitors from donor mice\nTiming: 3–4 h\nSex and age-matched wildtype C57BL/6J (CD45.2+/+) or similar compatible background bone marrow donor mice are used to isolate bone marrow progenitors. Preferentially use mice between 6–10 weeks old.\nBones collection.\nEuthanize mice using either CO2 (<20% displacement/minute) asphyxiation or cervical dislocation.\nNote: Methods of euthanasia should be appropriate consistent with animal ethics regulations. Tissues should be harvested immediately after euthanasia of mice using aseptic procedures.\nRemove the mouse hind limb femur and tibia from both legs. After removing muscles and connective tissue, place the bones in sterile PBS on ice.\nNote: Hips and sternum can be also collected to improve cellular yields.\nExtraction of bone marrow cells.\nUnder a PSP2 cell culture hood, transfer the bones into a mortar and crush the bones using a pestle in fresh sterile PBS. Continue to crush the bones until the bone debris becomes completely white, indicating that all the bone marrow cells have been released.\nFilter the suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer in a 50 mL tube to remove the bone fragments. Rinse the mortar and the strainer using fresh sterile PBS.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nPerform red blood cell lysis using 5 mL of ACK buffer.\nAfter 2 min of incubation at 20°C, wash the cells by adding 10 times of the volume of ACK used of sterile PBS (final volume = 50 mL) to quench the lysis.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL and count cells using Trypan Blue exclusion cell viability staining using appropriate dilutions.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL per 107 cells of sterile cold MACS buffer.\nFilter the suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer in a 15 mL tube to remove red blood cell debris.\nEnrichment of IL-7Rα expressing bone marrow cells.\nCentrifuge the bone marrow cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C, discard supernatant, and resuspend cells in fresh MACS buffer at a concentration of 25 × 107 cells/mL containing an anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (5 μg/mL).\nIncubate cells on ice for 20 min, then wash by filling the tube with MACS Buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in MACS Buffer at a concentration of 50 × 107 cells/mL containing IL-7Rα -biotin antibody (CD127, A7R34; 5 μg/mL). Rely on the count performed in 2.f. Incubate for 40 min at 4°C.\nAfter incubation, wash cells by adding 1 mL of MACS buffer per 5 × 107 cells (rely on the count performed in 2.f.) to the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in MACS buffer at a concentration of 50 × 107 cells/mL (rely on the count performed in 2.f). Add 10 μL of α-biotin magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) per 107 cells.\nIncubate cells with the microbeads for 30 min at 4°C.\nAfter incubation, wash cells by adding 1 mL of MACS buffer per 5 × 107 cells (rely on the count performed in 2.f.).\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend up to 108 cells (rely on the count performed in 2.f.) in 500 μL of MACS buffer.",
    "Proceed to magnetic separation using LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec).\nAttach the MidiMACS Separator to the MACS MultiStand and place LS Column in the separator. Place a 15 mL collection tube under the LS Column to collect the negative (unlabeled) fraction.\nEquilibrate the LS column by rinsing it with 3 mL of MACS Buffer. Wait until the buffer completely run through the column without letting the column dry.\nAdd the cell suspension on the column. Wash the columns three times with 3 mL of MACS Buffer.\nAfter washing, add 5 mL of MACS Buffer on the column, remove the column from the MACS separator and place it on a new 15 mL collection tube to collect IL-7Rα+ cells. Use the plunger to flush out the labeled cells.\nCritical: Cells are positively selected and IL-7Rα+ cells are retained within the column until their release via removal from the magnetic column stand and washing while using the plunger. Cells that flow through while the column is attached to the magnet during successive washes should be IL-7Rα negative. Keep these flow-through cells on ice as they can be used for single stained controls to appropriately set PMT voltages and compensation on the FACS.\nWash the recovered IL-7Rα+ cells in MACS buffer and centrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant. Cells are ready to be stained with surface antibodies (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1819_7.csv\nPrepare fresh antibody cocktails using MACS Buffer.\nFlow cytometric cell sorting of bone marrow progenitors\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "Enriched single cell suspension(s) will be stained with antibodies and a lineage cocktail (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) to discriminate different bone marrow progenitors using a FACS ARIA III Cell Sorter or a comparable Cell Sorter with similar characteristics. Minimal requirements consist of a FACS Cell Sorter with four lasers – violet (405 nm), blue (488 nm), yellow (561 nm) and red (640 nm) – and appropriate filters to optimally detect the fluorochromes detailed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Prepare collection tubes (e.g., 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes) containing 1 mL of sorting buffer to collect sorted cells. Keep all the tubes, solutions and sorted cells on ice (4°C) during the sort to maintain cell viability.\nStaining of bone marrow progenitors.\nResuspend enriched cells in the antibody cocktail (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) together with the fixable viability stain 700 (100 μL/107 cells final volume in MACS Buffer) and stain for 30 min on ice. Protect from light from this point forward.\nAfter incubation, wash cells by adding 10 times the volume of the antibody cocktail of MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend the cells at 1 × 107/mL of MACS buffer and keep the cell suspension on ice until cell sorting.\nIsolation of ILC2p.\nBefore acquiring samples, set appropriate PMT voltages and compensation by using single stained controls. Adjust compensation using the same set of antibodies.\nNote: Alternatively, antibodies against different markers can be used but they need to be coupled to the same fluorochromes for appropriate compensation. Commercially available beads for compensation can be used (e.g., UltraComp eBeads Plus compensation beads, InvitrogenTM, Cat# 01-3333-42) but the autofluorescence signal won’t be captured.\nPerform cell sorting using a 70 μm nozzle with a sorting speed of 5,000–8,000 events/second.",
    "Critical: Use aseptic procedures to keep progenitor cells sterile for in vivo injections.\nNote: Where possible, a FACS Cell Sorter placed under a hood should be used to maintain complete sterility.\nIsolate ILC2 progenitors based on the expression of the following parameters and the absence of expression of lineage markers (AF700 and APC-Cy7 antibody coupled fluorochromes): Lineage-IL-7Rα+Flt3-α4β7+c-kit-CD25+Sca-1+ (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1819-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gating strategy to isolate bone-marrow ILC progenitors\nNote: It is expected to isolate between 2,000 – 4,000 of ILC2 progenitors from a single wildtype mouse donor.\nOptional: The common and alpha lymphoid bone marrow progenitors can be isolated based on the expression of the following markers: Lineage-IL-7Rα+Flt3+α4β7-c-kit+ and Lineage-IL-7Rα+Flt3-α4β7+c-kit+CD25-, respectively (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nVerify the purity of the sorted population by reanalysing 10 μL of cells, transferred into a new tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1819-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Purity check of the ILC2 progenitors\nCritical: It is essential to evaluate the purity of isolated progenitors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) as contamination by other lymphoid progenitors can give rise to unwanted lymphoid cell subsets in recipient mice.\nWash isolated cell progenitors by adding 1 mL of sterile PBS/104 of cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nRepeat steps 5e–f.\nResuspend cells in 200 μL and count cells using Trypan Blue exclusion cell viability staining using appropriate dilutions.\nResuspend cells in sterile PBS at 7.5–10 × 103 cells/mL and proceed immediately to the injections of progenitor cells in irradiated Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− mice.\nLymphoid cell reconstitution in Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− recipient mice\nTiming: 6–8 weeks\nThe generation of bone marrow chimeras requires reconstitution of sublethally irradiated recipient mice with bone marrow-derived donor immune cells.\nNote: The immunodeficient Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− mice receive a unique dose of 4.5 Gray irradiation to induce inflammation, promoting progenitor cell engraftment (Vély et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).",
    "Under a laminar flow hood (class II) cell culture hood, inject each Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− mouse intravenously with 200 μL of the donor cell suspension.\nNote: Mice are monitored during 30 min to 1 h after injections and then daily by experienced animal technicians as per local ethics guidelines to ensure good animal welfare. Prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., neomycin sulfate) can be used to prevent infection during the two first weeks after transplantation. However, this is not usually necessary as the low dose irradiation does not induce complete myeloablation.\nPerform ILC2 in vivo function assessment or ex vivo assays 6–8 weeks after bone marrow progenitor injection.\nNote: This time-lapse is necessary to allow full reconstitution of the lymphoid compartment. While it is possible to analyze mice earlier than 6 weeks, the full development of ILC function requires 6–8 weeks. In ILC2-reconstituted Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− mice, we found a progressive increase of eosinophil frequency over time in the peripheral blood compared with control animals (Jacquelot et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). These transplanted mice achieved similar frequencies of eosinophils to ILC2 sufficient mice at ±6 weeks post ILC2p injections. These observations highlight that at least 6 weeks is required prior to analysis of ILC2 function in bone marrow-reconstituted Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− mice for accurate functional analyses.\nEvaluation of reconstitution efficiency\nTiming: 6–8 h",
    "It is critical to establish the efficacy of ILC2 reconstitution in alymphoid Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− recipient mice to make sure that the observed phenotype is directly attributable to ILC2. This will distinguish ILC2 activity from other potential lymphoid populations which could result from contamination of ILC2p with other progenitor cells. Although carefully performed, this is rare, but can occur when limited separation of markers is observed during cell sorting affecting the purity of the ILC2p subset. For every reconstituted Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− recipient mice, we suggest analysing the frequency and number of lymphoid cells in the intestinal lamina propria which is known to be home of large numbers of both innate and adaptive immune cells, facilitating the evaluation of the reconstitution of the lymphoid cell compartment. Non-reconstituted non-irradiated Rag2−/−Il2rγ−/− and C57BL/6J mice should be analyzed in parallel and serve as controls. The protocol below will precisely describe the step-by-step isolation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and analysis of intestinal immune cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1819-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Pictures to illustrate the step-by-step isolation of intestinal immune cells\n(A) Identify Peyer’s patch (indicated by ∗) on the small intestine.\n(B) The intestinal contents are gently removed.\n(C) Small intestine is opened longitudinally and kept in PBS in a Petri dish.\n(D) Small intestine is cut in small pieces.\n(E) Tissue pieces are transferred in dissociation buffer.\n(F and G) Tissues are filtered from dissociation buffer and washed.\n(H) Tissue pieces are transferred in digestion buffer.\n(I) After incubation, most of the tissues should have been digested.\n(J) Remove remaining tissues through a cell strainer.\n(K) Pellet the single cell suspension.\n(L) Load the 80% Percoll from the bottom of the tube.\n(M) Clear separation between the 40% Percoll containing cell suspension in top and the 80% Percoll below.",
    "(N) After centrifugation the leukocyte are at the interface of the 40% and 80% Percoll.\n(O) Leukocytes collected at the interface is rinsed in 10 mL of cold PBS to remove any Percoll from the solution and spun down to pellet.\nIsolation of intestinal immune cells from the lamina propria.\nEuthanize mice and collect small intestines in 4 mL PBS in 6 well plate on ice.\nSeparate the duodenum and ileum from the stomach and the caecum, respectively.\nRemove successively the fat tissue and Peyer’s patches, when present, using tweezers and scissors.\nNote: On average, there are between 6 to 9 Peyer’s patches per mouse that are distributed along the small intestine (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, as indicated by ∗).\nCritical: It is essential to ensure the small intestine is kept moist to avoid tissue dehydration and associated cell death. This may strongly impact cell recoveries and analysis.\nCut the small intestine into 4 parts, open them longitudinally (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), and remove the intestinal contents by gently scraping the contents away from the mucosal surface.\nWash the small intestine in PBS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: It is important to gently remove the intestinal contents to avoid any damage to the underlying tissues.\nCut the tissue into 2 mm pieces (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D), transferred into 50 mL tubes containing 10 mL HBSS + 2% FBS.\nVortex vigorously for 10–20 s (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) and filter the solution through a 100 μm cell strainer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nWash intestinal pieces with 20 mL HBSS + 2% FBS and transfer the pieces into a new 50 mL tube containing 20 mL of the dissociation solution.\nVortex the tube for 10–20 s and incubate for 40 min at 37°C under gentle shaking (230 rpm).\nNote: The dissociation media allows the separation of the epithelial layer from the lamina propria.",
    "After incubation, vortex the tubes vigorously for 10–20 s and filter the solution through a 100 μm cell strainer.\nCritical: After vortex, the solution should appear cloudy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G). This means that the epithelial layer has been effectively separated from the lamina propria of the small intestine.\nWash the intestinal pieces with 20 mL PBS.\nTransfer intestinal pieces in a new 50 mL tube containing 8–10 mL of the digestion solution (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nOptional: Cells from the epithelial layer can be collected and analyzed separately. Keep the solution at 4°C until step 8.o. Intraepithelial immune cells can be enriched by centrifugation on a 40%–80% Percoll gradient. Flow cytometric analysis of the immune cells can be performed after surface and intracellular staining using desired antibodies.\nCritical: The enzymes are sensitive to freeze thaw cycles. The enzymatic cocktail must be prepared freshly every time you perform a gut digestion.\nVortex the tube vigorously for 20 s and incubate for 45 min at 37°C with gentle shaking (230 rpm).\nAfter incubation, vortex the tubes vigorously for 20 s and filter the solution through a 100 μm cell strainer. Rinse the cell strainer with 30 mL PBS.\nCritical: The solution should appear cloudy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I). Only minimal residual tissue should be seen on the cell strainer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J).\nCentrifuge cells at 400 g for 7 min.\nNote: A pellet should be clearly seen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend cells in 6 mL of 40% Percoll.\nTransfer cells into a 15 mL tube and underlay 2 mL of 80% Percoll using a glass Pasteur pipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L).\nNote: A clear separation of the two layers should be observed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]M).\nCentrifuge cells at 950 g for 20 min at 20°C without brake.",
    "Note: A ring which contains lymphocytes should be visible at the interface (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]N).\nUsing a vacuum aspiration system, carefully remove and discard the top layer constituted by remaining epithelial cells to avoid contamination of your immune cell preparation.\nCollect the lymphocytes at the interface and transfer them into 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of cold PBS.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: A pellet should be visible (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]O).\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5 mL cold PBS, count the cells using Trypan Blue, and transfer 1–2 × 106 cells in V-bottom 96 well plate for staining.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nIncubate the cells with an anti-CD16/32 antibody (2.4G2 5 μg/mL in 50 μL of FACS buffer) for 20 min on ice.\nWash cells with 150 μL of FACS Buffer.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nSurface antibody staining.\nResuspend the cells in the antibody cocktail together with the fixable viability stain 700 (50 μL final volume in FACS Buffer) (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) and stain for 30 min on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1819_8.csv\nPrepare fresh using FACS Buffer.\nNote: Protect samples from light from all subsequent steps.\nWash cells with 150 μL of FACS Buffer.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nCell fixation and permeabilization.\nPrepare fixation buffer using the Fixation concentrate diluted (1 in 4) in the Fixation/Permeabilization diluent and fix/permeabilize cells (50 μL per sample) for 30 min on ice.\nPrepare the permeabilization buffer (1×) by adding 9 volumes of distilled water to 1 volume of Permeabilization buffer (10×).\nWash cells with 150 μL of 1× permeabilization buffer.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nIntracellular antibody staining.\nResuspend cells in the antibody cocktail (50 μL final volume prepared in 1× permeabilization buffer) (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) and incubate for 45–60 min on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1819_9.csv\nPrepare antibody cocktail for intracellular staining using fresh 1× Permeabilization Buffer.\nWash cells with 200 μL 1× permeabilization buffer.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 200 μL of 1× permeabilization buffer and store your samples at 4°C for no greater than 2–3 days prior to FACS acquisition.\nAcquire your samples on a flow cytometer after appropriate compensation to detect your population of interest (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1819-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
