    "1. General Preparation\nPrepare D10 medium. Supplement DMEM medium-Glutamax with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Final concentration: 100 U/mL).\nPrepare sterile PBS. Dissolve the tablets in water according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sterilize by autoclave.\nPrepare 1x trypsin. Dilute 5 mL of Trypsin-Versene EDTA/10x 1:10 in 45 mL of sterile PBS.\n\tNote: Throughout the protocol, we use cell culture conditions that are closer to the physiological conditions for primary fibroblasts. This means that we incubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as is normally done but using 5% O2 instead of the “standard” 20% O2.\nHandle all samples in sterile conditions by using a laminar flow hood, lab coat and gloves. Keep cells at 20% O2 (room conditions) only while being handled.\n2. Induction of Senescence\nReplicative Senescence \nWhile handling cells or any material that will be in contact with them (pipets, flasks, media, etc.) work under sterile conditions, by using a laminar flow hood, lab coat and gloves. Keep cells at 20% O2 (room conditions) only while being handled.\nSeed 7 x 105 viable primary fibroblasts in a low population doubling (PD) in a T75 flask (~9.3 x 103 cells/cm2) containing 10 mL of D10.\nGrow the cells in a cell incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2 until they reach 70–80% confluence (3–4 days for proliferating cultures in a low PD).\nDetach the cells using 3 mL of 1x trypsin and incubating for ~5–7 min in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2. Monitor the cells regularly with a cell culture microscope to check the detaching process.\nWhen cells are spherical, stop the trypsin reaction by adding 9 mL of D10. Do not incubate longer than 10 min.",
    "Spin the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Cells will form a pellet at the bottom of the tube, while debris and smaller particles will remain in the supernatant.\nRemove the supernatant and dissolve the cell pellet in 1 mL of D10 and perform a cell count using an automated cell counter according to manufacturer’s instructions or a Neubauer chamber for manual counting. While counting, include an assay to check the viability of the cells (e.g., Trypan Blue exclusion23).\nCalculate the cumulative PD using this formula:\n\t\tPDnew = 3.32*(LOG(cell number total)-(LOG(cell number seeded)) + PDold\n\t\tCell number total = all cells counted: dead and alive.\n\t\tCell number seeded = number of viable cells seeded (8x105 cells).\n\t\tPDold = population doubling at the moment of seeding.\n\t\tPDnew = population doubling at the moment of counting (after incubation).\n\t\tNOTE: If 7 x 105 primary fibroblasts (PD 35.2) were seeded on a T-75 flask and, after 4 days they reach 80% confluence and are split again, counting now 1.3 x 106 total cells (dead+alive).\n\t\tPDnew = 3.32*(LOG(1,300,000 cells)-LOG(700,000))+35.2\n\t\tPDnew = 36.1\nReseed 8 x 105 cells in a new T75, repeating steps 2.1.2–2.1.8.\n\t\tNOTE: After multiple consecutive passages, the culture will take longer to get confluent until cells stop dividing at all. Once cells stop dividing, test for senescence markers and/or harvest for downstream applications.\nConsider that the bigger size of senescent cells may cause the culture to appear full and yet have a low cell count. Thus, senescence can be assumed when the PD is stable and other senescence markers appear in the culture (see protocols 3.1–3.5).\n\t\tNote: Use proliferating primary fibroblasts as control.\nIonizing Radiation-induced Senescence",
    "While handling cells or any material that will be in contact with them (pipets, flasks, media, etc.), work under sterile conditions by using a laminar flow hood, lab coat and gloves. Keep cells at 20% O2 (room conditions) only while being handled.\nSeed 7 x 105 viable primary fibroblasts in a low PD in a T75 flask (~9.3 x 103 cells/cm2) containing 10 mL of D10.\nIncubate the cells overnight in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nExpose the cells to 10 gray of gamma irradiation according to the instructions of the machine in use.\nAspirate the medium from the cells and replace with 10 mL of D10.\nIncubate the cells in 10 mL of D10 in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2 for another 10 days replacing the medium regularly, approximately every 3 days.\nAfter 10 days, test for senescence markers and/or use the cells for downstream applications.\n\t\tNOTE: Use proliferating primary fibroblasts of the same PD (before irradiation) as control.\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation-Induced Senescence\nWhile handling cells or any material that will be in contact with them (pipets, flasks, media, etc.), work under sterile conditions by using a laminar flow hood, lab coat and gloves. Keep cells at 20% O2 (room conditions) only while being handled.\nSeed 1.5–2 x 105 viable primary fibroblasts in a low PD in one well of a 6-well plate (1.5–2.0 x 104 cells/cm2), add 2 mL of D10 medium.\nPlace the cells in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2 and allow them to adhere to the plastic for at least 5 h.",
    "Take off the medium from the cells. Place the 6-well plate in the middle of the UV-radiation chamber and take the plastic lid off. Irradiate with UVB, 20–30 mJ/cm2.\nAdd 2 mL of medium per well.\nIncubate the cells in 2 mL of D10 in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2 for another 7 days replacing the medium regularly, approximately every 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: After 7 days, cells can be tested for senescence markers and used for downstream applications. Use proliferating primary fibroblasts of the same PD (before irradiation) as control.\nDoxorubicin-induced Senescence\nPrepare 1,000x Doxorubicin stock solution: Make a 250 µM stock of Doxorubicin in 1x PBS, filter-sterilize the solution and aliquot in 500 µL per sterile tube. Store the doxorubicin stock at -80 °C.\nWhile handling cells or any material that will be in contact with them (pipets, flasks, media, etc.), work under sterile conditions by using a laminar flow hood, lab coat and gloves. Keep cells at 20% O2 (room conditions) only while being handled.\nSeed 7 x 105 viable primary fibroblasts in a low PD in a T75 flask (~9.3 x 103 cells/cm2) containing 10 mL of D10.\nIncubate the cells overnight in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nDilute 11 µL of the 1,000x doxorubicin stock solution in 11 mL of D10 to a final concentration of 250 nM.\nAspirate the medium from the cells and replace with 10 mL of D10 + doxorubicin.\nIncubate the cells for exactly 24 h in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nAspirate the medium from the cells and carefully wash once with 10 mL of D10.",
    "Incubate the cells in 10 mL of D10 for another 6 days replacing the medium regularly, approximately every 3 days.\nAt day 7, test for senescence markers and/or use for downstream applications.\n\t\tNOTE: As control, use proliferating primary fibroblasts of the same PD treated for 24 h with vehicle (PBS) 1:1,000 in D10.\nOxidative Stress-induced Senescence\nWhile handling cells or any material that will be in contact with them (pipets, flasks, media, etc.) work under sterile conditions by using a laminar flow hood, lab coat and gloves. Keep cells at 20% O2 (room conditions) only while being handled.\nSeed 7 x 105 viable primary fibroblasts in a low PD in a T75 flask (~9.3 x 103 cells/cm2) containing 10 mL of D10.\nIncubate the cells overnight in a cell incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nPrepare a solution of ~200 μM hydrogen peroxide in D10 medium by adding 22.6 μL of 30% hydrogen peroxide in 11 mL of D10.\n\t\tNOTE: Optimize the treatment for the cell type of interest by making a curve dose-response to evaluate toxicity.\nAspirate the medium from the cells and add 10 mL of the freshly prepared D10 medium+hydrogen peroxide. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nAspirate the medium from the cells and wash once with fresh D10 without hydrogen peroxide.\nAdd 10 mL of D10 without hydrogen peroxide.\nIncubate for 48 h in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nRepeat steps 2.5.4–2.5.8 two times more for a total of three treatments.\nCheck for senescence markers or harvest for downstream applications.\n\t\tNote: As control, use proliferating cells of the same PD treated with 22.6 µL of sterile water in D10 for 2 h.\nEpigenetically-induced Senescence",
    "Prepare stock and working solutions for the small molecule(s) to use according to Table 1. Filter-sterilize the solutions. Aliquot in sterile tubes. Store at -20 °C.\nWhile handling cells or any material that will be in contact with them (pipets, flasks, media, etc.) work under sterile conditions, for instance, by using a laminar flow hood, lab coat and gloves. Keep cells at 20% O2 (room conditions) only while being handled.\nSeed 7 x 105 viable primary fibroblasts in a low PD in a T75 flask (~9.3 x 103 cells/cm2) containing 10 mL of D10.\nIncubate the cells overnight in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nPrepare 11 mL of D10 medium + working solution for the desired treatment. The exact dilution per treatment can be seen in Table 1.\n\t\t\nPrepare 11 µL of 1 mM SAHA working solution in 11 mL of D10.\nPrepare 44 µL of 1 M sodium butyrate working solution in 11 mL of D10.\nPrepare 11 µL of 10 mM 5-aza working solution in 11 mL of D10.\n\t\t\tNote: Optimize the treatments for the cell type of interest by, for instance, making a curve dose-response to evaluate toxicity.\nAdd D10 medium + working solution for the desired treatment to the culture.\nIncubate for 24 h in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nRepeat steps 2.6.4–2.6.6 two times more, for a total of three treatments.\nChange medium for simple D10 without drug.\nAfter 3 days more, cells become senescent and ready for testing of senescence markers and downstream applications.",
    "NOTE: As control, use proliferating primary fibroblasts of the same PD treated for three days with D10 medium+vehicle. The D10 medium+vehicle needs to be refreshed every 24 h during those three days. The vehicle depends on the treatment used: 1:1,000 DMSO for SAHA and 5-aza and 1:250 sterile water for Sodium Butyrate.\n3.

    "For each sample, seed 1 x 104 cells in at least one well of a 24-well plate (5.2 x 103 cells/cm2) containing 500 µL of D10 so that the cells are sparse. Treatments (if applicable) can be performed directly on this plate or, alternatively, cells treated already can be re-seeded into a 24-well plate.\nIncubate the cells overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nWash cells two times with 500 μL of PBS.\nFix 3–5 min at room temperature using 500 μL/well of 2% formaldehyde + 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS.\nWash cells two times with 500 μL of PBS.\nPrepare fresh staining solution, according to the number of samples to stain.\nAdd staining solution (500 µL/well) and seal the plate with parafilm to avoid evaporation.\n\t\tNOTE: Evaporation may cause crystals to form and hinder the observation under the microscope.\nIncubate cells in the dark (e.g. covered in aluminum foil) at 37 °C in a dry incubator (without CO2) for 12–16 h.\n\t\tNote: CO2 may affect the pH and therefore modify the results. Some cell types may require shorter incubation times.\nWash two times with 500 μL of PBS.\nAssess the results. Positive cells present a blue (mostly) perinuclear staining under a normal light microscope (Figure 1A).",
    "For quantification, observe at least 100 cells per sample and count the number of positive cells. Since senescent cells change shape, it is often difficult to define the cell boundaries and to count the cells. Counterstain with DAPI to facilitate visualization and quantification of individual cells (Figure 1B). Quantify the samples (percentage of positive cells versus total amount of cells) using a fluorescent microscope (Figure 1C). Take multiple pictures of the same sample so that at the end you can count at least 100 single-cells and evaluate the percentage of SA-β-gal positive cells in them.\nCompare results of senescent cells versus their appropriate control for the treatment used.\n\t\tNOTE: A co-staining with EdU on the same sample is possible. Consider that cells should then be seeded on coverslips.\nEdU Incorporation Assay\nPut a coverslip/well in a 24-well plate according to the number of samples to assess.\nSeed 1 x 104 cells in at least one well of a 24-well plate (5.2 x 103 cells/cm2) per condition containing 500 µL of D10 so that the cells are sparse. Treatments (if applicable) can be performed directly on this plate or, alternatively, already treated cells can be re-seeded into a 24-well plate.\nIncubate the cells overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nMake a 20 µM solution of EdU in D10 (1:250) according to the number of samples to treat (250 μL per sample).\nRemove half of the medium (250 μL) from each well to treat and replace it with the D10 + EdU solution that was just prepared. Final EdU concentration is 10 µM.\nIncubate 18–24 h in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 5% O2. Use the same incubation time in control and senescent cells.\nWash 2x with 500 μL of PBS.",
    "Fix the cells for 10 min with 500 μL of 4% formaldehyde in PBS.\nIncubate 5 min in 500 μL of 100 mM Tris (pH 7.6).\nPermeabilize the cells for 10 min in 500 μL of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS.\nWash 3x with PBS.\nPrepare 50 μL of label mix for each coverslip, adding the components in the following order: 44.45 µL of PBS, 0.5 µL of Cu(II)SO4, 0.05 µL of sulfo-Cy3-azide, 5 µL of sodium-ascorbate.\nPut 50 μL of the label mix on a piece of parafilm. Lift the coverslip with the aid of a pair of tweezers and a needle and let it rest on top of the label mix, with the surface containing the cells facing downwards. Ensure that there are no bubbles and that the whole surface of the coverslip is touching the label mix. Incubate for 30 min in the dark.\nPut the cells back in the wells of the 24-well plate and wash them three times with PBS.\nMount with mounting media (including DAPI to visualize nuclei) onto glass slides and let them dry overnight.\nVisualize the EdU incorporation using a fluorescent microscope. Use a filter appropriate for Cy3 (excitation/emission: 552/570 nm).\nTake multiple pictures of the cells for later quantification of at least 100 cells per condition (Cy3 and DAPI).\nQuantify the percentage of cells that incorporated EdU by using the following formula:\n\t\tEdU positive cells (%) = (EdU positive cell count (Cy3)/total cell count (DAPI)) * 100\nCompare results of senescent cells versus their appropriate control for the treatment used.\n\t\tNote: A co-staining with SA-β-gal on the same sample is possible. Consider that cells should still be seeded on coverslips.\nGene Expression of p16, p21 and SASP \nPrepare primer-sets of Genes of Interest (50 µM each primer).",
    "NOTE: A qPCR of p16, p21 and some relevant SASP factors is informative of the senescence status. The protocol described here makes use of the Universal Probe Library (UPL) system for relative quantification using a real time-PCR. Table 3 shows an overview of the primers used for detection of the CDK inhibitors p16 and p21 and of the most relevant SASP members, as well as for Tubulin and Actin, which serve as reference genes for the assay. The last column of Table 3 enlists the particular UPL probe to be used for each assay.\nPrepare separate qPCR reaction mix for the desired assays. Always include the reference gene as well according to Table 4.\nRun all samples in duplicate or triplicate.\nLoad 7.5 µL/well of the qPCR reaction mix on a 384-well plate.\nAdd ~5 ng of cDNA dissolved in 2.5 µL of RNase-free water.\n\t\tNOTE: It is preferable to have similar amounts of cDNA for all the samples to be compared. This can be achieved by using equal amounts of RNA for the reverse transcription.\nCover the plate with a seal and make sure that it sticks correctly covering evenly all the wells on the plate.\nSpin the plate at 2,000 x g for 1 min.\nRun the plate in the Lightcycler for 40 cycles using the following protocol:\n\t\t95 °C for 7 min\n\t\t40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s\n\t\t37 °C for 1 min\nFor the analysis of the results, use the method proposed for Livak and colleagues to analyze qPCR data24. Use either Tubulin or Actin as reference genes to calculate the ΔCt value and use the appropriate control to calculate the for the ΔΔCt value for the specific senescence-inducing treatment.\nProtein expression and secretion of IL6",
    "Seed 5–10 x 104 cells in at least one well of a 6-well plate (5.2–10.5 x 103 cells/cm2) per condition containing 2 mL of D10. Treatments (if applicable) can be performed directly on this plate or, alternatively, cells treated already can be re-seeded into a 24-well plate. Let it stand overnight after seeding.\nRemove the medium and replace for 2 mL of DMEM medium without FBS.
