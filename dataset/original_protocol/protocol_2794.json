    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol below describes (1) fabrication of the cornea-on-a-chip, (2) human corneal epithelial (HCEpi) cells and human corneal endothelial (HCEnd) cells seeding to create a corneal-barrier-on-chip, (3) measurement of corneal permeability (trans-epithelial electrical resistance and apparent permeability index), (4) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the stratified corneal epithelium, and (5) immunofluorescent staining of cytokeratin-3 and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) tight junction protein expression (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2492-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Experimental timeline\nDetailed overview of key steps on critical days of chip preparation, cells seeding, analysis of barrier function and sections imaging.\nFabrication of cornea-chip\nFabrication of the SU-8 silicon master and its silanization was described in the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Thereafter, this section describes (1) preparation of PDMS, (2) creation of the upper and lower PDMS substrate, and (3) alignment and assembly of the cornea-chip.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2492-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Overview of the process for microfabrication of the cornea-chip\n(A) SU8 photoresist is spin-coated on the silicon wafers, patterned by UV exposure, and developed to generate SU8 masters.\n(B) Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is cured on the SU8 masters to make microfluidic structures.\n(C) The PDMS slabs are peeled off and punched to make access holes and open wells. The lower PDMS slab and the glass substrate bond by oxygen plasma treatment. A porous polycarbonate membrane seals the open well in the lower PDMS slab. The upper PDMS slab is bonded to the lower layer to create the cornea-chip.\nManual mixing and degassing of PDMS\nTiming: 1 h\nPrepare a degassed mixture of PDMS silicone elastomer base and curing agent for replica molding.\nPlace an empty disposable plastic cup on a scale with appropriate precision and pour silicone elastomer base and curing agent in a 10:1 (base: curing agent) weight ratio.",
    "Mix silicone elastomer base and curing agent vigorously by hand using a disposable plastic fork for 5 min until PDMS appears white.\nPlace the cup containing the PDMS mixture in a vacuum desiccator for 30 min.\nRemove the cup from the chamber to complete degassing.\nCreation of the upper and lower PDMS substrate\nTiming: 6 h\nAttach a master silicon wafer with desired microfabricated channel features to the bottom surface of a Petri dish (100 mm) using double-sided tape.\nUse compressed filtered air to gently blow off dust particles from the silicon master.\nPour 20 g of degassed 10:1 (wt/wt, prepolymer: curing agent) PDMS mixture onto the upper layer master. This produces a 2-mm thick PDMS slab with the features of the upper microchannels.\nPour 10 g of degassed 10:1 PDMS mixture onto the cleaned master of the lower layer. This produces a 1-mm thick PDMS slab with the lower microchannels.\nPlace the Petri dish with PDMS in a vacuum chamber to degas for 10 min and then on a level surface for 1 h to ensure uniform coverage of the master surface with PDMS.\nCover the Petri dish with a lid and put it in an oven at 80°C for 4 h to fully cure PDMS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nRemove the dish from the oven and allow it to cool to 22°C.\nCut the fully cured PDMS along the edge of the silicon wafer using a scalpel and carefully peel it off.",
    "Make holes through the PDMS slab using hole punchers. Use a 1-mm puncher to make holes through the PDMS slabs, providing access to the central upper and lower cell culture microchannels, respectively. Use a 6-mm puncher to create the “Culture zone” and the “TEER zone”, respectively. Punch these holes from the micropatterned surface of the PDMS slab to ensure precise positioning of the holes relative to the microchannels.\nPut magic tape on both sides of the PDMS block and then peel the tape off to clean the surfaces.\nWrap the final PDMS slab in magic tape to keep it clean until use.\nAlignment and assembly of the cornea-on-a-chip\nTiming: 1 h\nPause point: These devices can be stored at 22°C for up to one month before bonding to glass coverslip.\nPeel the magic tape from the lower microchannel slab.\nTreat the lower PDMS surface and a coverslip with plasma for 1 min.\nPlace the lower microchannel slab attached to a coverslip.\nTreat the porous membrane surface with plasma for 1 min.\nPlace the porous membrane surface attached to the lower microchannel slab.\nRemove the magic tape from the upper microchannel slab and expose the channel side to plasma for 1 min.\nOverlay the upper microchannel slab on the membrane (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nWhen alignment is complete, press down the upper PDMS slab to eliminate trapped air pockets and to ensure firm contact between layers.\nInsert the blunt needles into the four ports of the side microchambers.\nCut four pieces of silicone tubing to a length of 8 cm and connect them to the free ends of the needles.\nMix 5 min epoxy on a clean surface and apply it around each needle.\nWait for 30 min to allow the applied epoxy to set.\nPreparation of the cornea-on-a-chip\nTiming: 3.5 h",

    "Add 20 μL of HCEpi cells suspension in the upper hole.\nTransfer the chip to the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nCritical: Once cells are seeded into the chip, do not move the chip until the next medium change (24 h later), to allow the growth of cells.\nAfter the HCEpi cells proliferation on the membrane, the culture medium is gently aspirated from the upper hole, and the air is then filled in the epithelial compartment to create an air-liquid interface.\nThe lower channels are introduced into the DMEM/F12 Complete Medium and Prigrow I Complete Medium mix (1:1) at a continuous flow condition with a volumetric flow rate of 100 μL/h by using a programmable low-pressure syringe pump.\nMaintain above conditions for 14 days and allow the HCEpi cells to grow until to form a stratified epithelium consisting of five to seven stacked cell layers.\nPhysiological phenotypes of the microengineered cornea\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis section describes (1) measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), (2) permeability coefficient (Papp) of the corneal-barrier-on-chip model, (3) staining of paraffin sections of stratified corneal epithelium, and (4) immunofluorescence staining of the corneal cells.\nMeasurement of transepithelial electrical resistance\nTiming: 1–2 h\nSterilize the Millicell-electrical resistance system (Millicell-ERS) with 75% ethanol before placing it into the biosafety cabinet.\nConnect the probe to the Millicell-ERS.\nSterilize the probe by submerged in 75% ethanol for 15 min.\nPrepare the cornea-chip by removing the medium from the basal compartment.\nAdd 100 μL of PBS to the apical and basal compartments.\nPrepare a blank sterilized microdevice without cells and inject PBS into the upper and lower culture channels.\nSet the function switch to “Ohms”.\nRemove the probe from 75% ethanol and drip it off the electrode tips.\nWash the electrode tips in PBS.",
    "Insert the long electrode tip into the “TEER zone”.\nLower the probe until the long electrode tip touches the bottom of the well.\nKeep the short electrode tip above the “Culture zone” surface.\nMeasure the resistance on the blank microdevice and record the value (Rblank).\nMeasure the resistance on the cornea-chip and record the value (Rtotal) (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2492_3.csv\nRemove the PBS from the apical and basal compartments.\nReconnect the microdevice to the low-pressure syringe pump and perfuse the lower channels with mixed culture medium at a volumetric flow rate of 100 μL/h.\nIncubate at a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: Keep the probe at a 90° angle. Allow time for the values to level off. Perform the TEER measurement procedure ideally within 5–10 min to ensure the optimal integrity of the cultures. If the device contains different media conditions, wash the probe with 75% ethanol and PBS between the readings.
