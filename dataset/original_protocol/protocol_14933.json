    "NOTE: Patient tissue procurement was authorized through institutionally review board (IRB)-approved Biospecimen and Clinical Protocols (Protocol numbers 09-121 and 11-041, respectively) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n1. Tissue Procurement\nProcurement of patient primary tumor/metastasis\n\tNOTE: To date, this protocol has been performed on surgically removed pancreatic, gastric and breast tumor types, as well as, lymphoma metastases.\n\t\nDirect the Surgical team to deliver the specimen by courier or pneumatic tube system to the Pathology department in tightly sealed and sterile leak-proof plastic specimen bag within sterile spill-proof container. Direct the Surgical team to transport the specimen in the fresh state with no formalin or fixative.\nDirect the pathologist or pathologist assistant to harvest the fresh specimen using sterile technique, which includes use of sterile gloves and instruments under a laminar flow hood.\nRecord the harvesting time of the procured specimen, which is kept rigorously under 30 min from the completion of the surgical procedure. Taking into consideration effects of cold ischemia, do not take samples from resected specimens with a cold ischemic time of > 30 min18.\nDirect the Pathology Department personnel to remove a primary tumor specimen of approximately 0.5 cm3 to 1.0 cm3 in a laminar flow hood to maintain a sterile environment. When possible, choose tumor tissue from the periphery of the index lesion to avoid potential frank central necrosis (cell death).\n\t\tNOTE: The necrotic tissue may be grossly recognizable by any of the following criteria: loss of color or paleness of the tissue; loss of strength in which necrotic tissue is soft and friable; a distinct demarcation between the necrotic and viable tissue.",
    "Direct the pathologist or pathologist assistant to provide peripheral tissue that is in excess (surgical discard) after immediate sampling of the tumor for diagnostic evaluation. Place the specimen in a 15 ml sterile conical centrifuge tube containing approximately 5 ml of minimum essential media (MEM) containing 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin).\nIf available (e.g., lymph node of axillary tail of mastectomy specimen), procure a grossly positive associated lymph node specimen of the same size (0.5 cm3 to 1.0 cm3) and compare to drug response of primary tumor. Like the primary tumor specimen, place the associated lymph node specimen in a 15 ml sterile conical centrifuge tube containing approximately 5 ml of minimum essential media (MEM) containing 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin).\nIf size of surgical specimen permits (e.g., mastectomy specimen), remove (distant from primary tumor) a sample of normal tissue (i.e., normal dense/fibrous breast parenchyma) and place in a 15 ml sterile conical centrifuge tube containing approximately 5 ml of minimum essential media (MEM) containing 1% antibiotics for transfer purposes only. Following transfer to the laboratory facilities, transfer the ‘normal’ specimen to a cryovial, ‘snap’ freeze and store in a -80 °C freezer for future molecular analyses.\nPlace all specimens on wet ice and immediately transport to the laboratory space for ex vivo fresh tissue sectioning. Do not section the normal specimen but rather store in a -80 °C freezer for future molecular analyses. Transfer a portion of the primary tumor and associated metastasis to a cryovial, ‘snap’ freeze and store in a -80 °C freezer for future molecular analyses.\nProcurement of tissue from clinical studies (e.g., optional core needle biopsies (CNB))",
    "NOTE: We obtain tumor tissues from patients enrolled on clinical protocols who give their consent to undergo a CNB of an accessible tumor metastasis prior to the start of therapy. CNBs, to date, have been performed on patients with breast, marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, metastatic paraganglioma, cervix (squamous cell) and ovarian cancers.\n\t\nHave clinical personnel from Interventional Radiology or relevant department perform a pre-treatment core needle biopsy and place the specimen in a 15 ml sterile conical centrifuge tube containing approximately 5 ml of minimum essential media (MEM) containing 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin).\nPlace the biopsy specimen on wet ice and immediately transport to the laboratory space for ex vivo fresh tissue sectioning.\n2. Preparation of Materials for Sectioning and Vibratome Settings\nPreparation of Materials for Sectioning\n\t\nMake a 4% agarose solution by adding 4 g of agarose to 100 ml of PBS. Autoclave (cycle settings: liquid, 121 °C, 30 min, 15 pounds per square inch) the solution before first use. For subsequent uses, place the 4% agarose in a microwave to liquefy (High heat for 30 sec intervals) prior to each use and cool appropriately to ~ 25 °C (i.e., warm to touch) mindful that agarose solidifies at RT.\nUse the 4% agarose as a non-permanent tissue embedding media. When the 4% agarose has cooled sufficiently and is still in a liquid state, with sterile forceps place the tissue specimen in an embedding mold and pour in the 4% agarose.\nPosition the tissue specimen close (~ 2 mm distance) but not directly on the cutting surface wall of the embedding mold. The 4% agarose will begin to solidify quickly, therefore appropriately position the tissue specimen quickly. During sectioning, keep the 4% agarose in a 55 °C water bath to keep in solution.",
    "To a 24-well plate for section analysis, add 1 ml of complete media (i.e., MEM + 10% fetal bovine serum + 1% antibiotics) to each well. Keep the 24-well plate at RT (~25 °C) throughout the duration of sectioning.\nPreparation of Vibratome Settings\n\t\nUsing the vibrating microtome, set the speed at which the blade approaches the specimen [0 (0.00 mm/sec) to 10 (2.5 mm/sec)] and the frequency of the blade [0 (0 Hz) to 10 (100 Hz)]. Adjust the settings according to the texture of the tissue (i.e., density/firmness).\nFor a primary breast tumor of invasive ductal carcinoma, adjust settings to 6 and 3, speed and frequency respectively. For less dense/firm tumor tissue, decrease speed and increase frequency accordingly.\nSet the section thickness within the instrument limits (1 – 999 µm). For these analyses, set the section thickness at 200 µm.\nMount the agarose-embedded specimen using a thin layer of liquid adhesive on the specimen disc that is submersed in a reservoir of media that is encased in wet ice.\n3. Tissue Sectioning, Treatment & Analyses\nRemove the precision-sliced sections immediately upon sectioning using sterile forceps and place in a multi-well plate with 1 ml of complete media. When sufficient sections are acquired for response and correlative analyses, place the multi-well plate for treatment response in a tissue culture incubator set at standard tissue culturing conditions.\nTake multiple control sections that bookend the treated sections in an effort to confirm dose-dependent response as opposed to cultured artifacts. Perform tissue sectioning rapidly (~30 – 40 min), well within any detrimental effects of cold ischemic time (~2 – 4 hr)18. Perform treatment of sections only following a 1 hr acclimation period.",
    "Following the 1 hr acclimation period, add increasing doses (therapeutically relevant; e.g., 0 – 10 μM concentrations) of drug to the sections and house under standard tissue culture conditions for the treatment period. For this study, use 24 and/or 48 hr assessment periods. However, control (vehicle only) tissue sections will remain viable, as tested in this study, for periods up to and including 96 hr assessment periods.\nFollowing treatment, remove all sections under sterile conditions and formalin-fix by placing the tissue section in a tube containing either 10% buffered formalin and place at RT O/N or in a tube containing 4% paraformaldehyde (dilute 16% paraformaldehyde from a vial with PBS for a final concentration of 4%) and place at RT for 2 hr.\n\t\nFix larger tissue sections (e.g., ~6 mm x 4 mm) 200 μm thick in 10% buffered formalin O/N at RT. Fix smaller sections (e.g., 1 mm x 1 mm) 200 μm thick in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hr at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: For efficient penetration of fixative the volume of fixative should be 20x the volume of tissue. Given that this protocol results in extremely small tissue sizes (e.g., 6 mm3 tissue = 6 μl volume), for assurance of proper fixation use 1 ml of fixative for all tissue sizes.\nFollowing fixation have the tissue specimens paraffin embedded by the Pathology Department personnel. Section specimen paraffin blocks onto charged slides to be hematoxylin and eosin stained and assessed immunohistochemically (e.g., apoptosis).\nSubscription Required.
