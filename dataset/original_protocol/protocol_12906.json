    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details related to all the materials, software, reagents, instruments, and cells used in this protocol.\n1. Gene-specific in vitro DMS-MaP\nRNA in vitro transcription\n\t\nObtain the sequence of the RNA of interest as double-stranded (ds)DNA (e.g., as DNA fragments, plasmids, or PCR from pre-existing/genomic DNA). If the DNA sequence contains a polymerase promotor, jump to step 3.\nPerform overlap PCR to attach an RNA polymerase promotor upstream of the desired DNA fragment (forward primer for T7 polymerase: 5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGG + first bases of target sequence 3').\nIn vitro transcribe the DNA fragment into RNA. Always keep the RNA on ice.\nDigest the DNA using a DNase.\nIsolate the RNA using a column-based approach (step 2.4) or by ethanol precipitation (step 2.5). Elute in an appropriate volume, expecting a yield of ~50 µg.\nEnsure the RNA integrity by running it on an agarose gel; denature the RNA for 2-3 min at 70 °C before running.\n\t\tNOTE: The buffer and agarose can contain RNases that degrade RNA and might contaminate the RNA sample. Precast agarose gels have previously been used in this lab; the results (especially with RNA) have been ambiguous at times. The best results were obtained with agarose or PAGE gels.\nDirectly use of store the RNA at −80 °C for several months unless degradation is visible after thawing.\nIn vitro DMS modification (at 105 mM DMS)\n\t\nPrepare a sufficient amount of refolding buffer (0.4 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, containing 6 mM MgCl2).\n\t\tNOTE: For each reaction (final volume of 100 µL), add 89 µL of refolding buffer.\nFor each reaction, transfer 89 µL of refolding buffer to a designated 1.5 mL tube, and prewarm at 37 °C in a thermoshaker placed underneath a chemical hood.",
    "NOTE: DMS is highly toxic and must always be kept underneath a chemical hood until quenched by a reducing agent.\nElute 1-10 pmol of RNA in 10 µL of nuclease-free water (NF H2O); transfer to a PCR tube.\nIncubate in a thermocycler at 95 °C for 1min to denature the RNA.\nPlace on an ice block immediately to avoid misfolding.\nAdd the RNA sample to the designated tube with refolding buffer at 37 °C, mix well, and incubate for 10-20 min to refold the RNA.\n\t\tNOTE: Most RNAs will fold in the order of milliseconds to seconds, although exceptions exist16.\nAdd 1 µL of 100% (10.5 M) DMS to the RNA sample, and incubate for 5 min while shaking at 800-1,400 rotations per minute (rpm).\n\t\tNOTE: Shaking (or other means of mixing) at this step is crucial as DMS is hydrophobic and may not fully dissolve in the refolding buffer. Deviations in reaction times might affect the reproducibility of the DMS reactivities. To minimize pipetting error, DMS can be dissolved in 100% ethanol prior to adding it to the sample if a final concentration of 1% (105 mM) DMS is maintained. For an untreated control, DMS can be substituted by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or water.\nAfter 5 min of reaction time, quench with 60 µL of 100% β-mercaptoethanol (BME), mix well, and immediately place the RNA on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: The RNA can be safely removed from the hood after quenching the reaction with BME to clean it up. However, direct exposure of BME to the surroundings should still be avoided due to its strong smell and irritating properties.\nClean up the RNA by sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation (see step 2.5) or a column-based approach (see step 2.6), and elute in 10 µL of water.\nQuantify the RNA using a spectrophotometer.",
    "Directly use of store the modified RNA at −80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Long-term storage should be avoided, as RNA is less stable after DMS treatment.\nGene-specific RT-PCR of modified RNA\n\t​NOTE: See Figure 1 for the RT-PCR setup of the DMS-treated fragments.\n\t\nElute 100 ng of modified RNA in 10 µL of nuclease-free (NF) H2O. Transfer to a PCR tube.\nTo the tube, add 4 µL of 5x first strand buffer (FSB), 1 µL of dNTP mix (10 mM each), 1 µL of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) (avoid freeze-thaw cycles), 1 µL of RNase inhibitor, 1 µL of 10 µM reverse primer (single primer or a pool of primers), and 1 µL of TGIRT III.\n\t\tNOTE: For a pool of primers, do not add 1 µL of 10 µM of each primer directly to the RT; instead, mix the primers first, and add 1 µL from the mix (at 10 µM total primer concentration).\nIncubate at 57 °C for 30 min to 1.5 h (typically, 30 min is sufficient to make a 500 nt product) in a thermocycler.\nAdd 1 µL of 4 M NaOH, mix by pipetting, and incubate at 95 °C for 3 min to degrade the RNA.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is crucial as it releases TGIRT from the cDNA by degrading the RNA. If skipped, the downstream PCR might be affected.\nClean up using a column-based approach (see step 2.6) that sufficiently removes the primers, and elute in 10 µL of NF H2O.\nPCR-amplify the cDNA by using 1 µL of the reverse transcription product per 25 µL of the reaction with a PCR kit designed to balance yield and fidelity.\n\t\tNOTE: The primers should have a melting temperature of ~60 °C.",
    "Run 2 µL of the PCR product on an agarose gel or a precast agarose gel to verify the PCR success.\nIdeally, only one band should show after the PCR. If so, clean up the reaction using a column-based approach. If alternative bands are present, use the remaining PCR reaction to excise the correct band from the gel. Elute in a sufficiently small volume (e.g., 10 µL).\nQuantify the extracted fragments using a spectrophotometer.\nIndex the dsDNA fragments for sequencing using an approach suited to the desired sequencing platform.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64820/64820fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental setup for the RT-PCR of large DMS-treated fragments. When performing reverse transcription on a modified RNA, the modifications on the sequence that the primer anneals to will not be recorded. Thus, when the fragments exceed 400-500 bp in length, fragments overlapping in the primer regions need to be designed, as exemplified here. The length of the fragments depends on the sequencing needs. When using paired-end 150 cycle sequencing, the fragments should not exceed 300 bp.

Whole-genome DMS-MaP using virus-infected cells\nNOTE: In cells, DMS treatment can also be combined with the gene-specific amplification approach described above. The whole-genome library requires enormous sequencing depth to achieve full coverage on a single gene. However, if viral RNAs make up a significant fraction of the ribodepleted RNA after extraction, whole-genome sequencing would be appropriate. Furthermore, other enrichment methods can be combined with the whole-genome library generation method.\nNOTE: Uninfected cells were used for demonstration purposes in the video protocol.\nDMS treatment\n\t\nGrow cells infected with the virus until the desired stage of infection.",
    "Transfer the cell container into a dedicated fume hood that is appropriate for handling both viruses at the required biosafety level and the chemical fumes generated by agents such as DMS.\nAdd a 2.5% volume of DMS to the culture medium, and seal the container (typically a 10 cm plate) with parafilm.\n\t\tNOTE: It is easy to under-modify and over-modify with DMS. When adding DMS directly to cells, it is very important to mix well. Alternatively, prewarm the new medium in a 50 mL conical tube at 37 °C, and add the DMS directly shaking vigorously. Decant the spent medium on the cells, and slowly pipette in the DMS-containing medium.\nTransfer to a 37 °C incubator for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the amount of time it takes to handle the DMS outside the incubator, it is possible that 5 min will lead to over-modification. Keep the time from adding the DMS to incubating to ≤1 min. If performing the experiment for the first time, it is recommended to do a DMS titration and vary the incubation time (between 3 min and 10 min) to find the optimal modification rate and ensure that the results are robust across a window of concentrations.\nCarefully pipette out the DMS-containing medium (into appropriate chemical waste) and gently add 10 mL of stop buffer (PBS with 30% BME [e.g., 3 mL of BME and 7 mL of PBS]).",
    "NOTE: The addition of DMS and BME can lift the cells from the plate if the cells are not strongly adherent. If the cells are lifting, they can be treated as suspension cells-instead of removing the DMS-containing medium, add the stop buffer directly, and scrape out the cells with DMS and BME into a 50 mL conical tube. Pellet the cells by centrifuging for 3 min at 3,000 × g; make sure to get rid of any residual DMS, which can pellet under the cells in large droplets. An extra wash step in 30% BME is recommended if the DMS medium cannot be removed initially.\nScrape the cells, and transfer them to a 15 mL conical tube.\nPellet by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 3 min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash 2x with 10 mL of PBS.\nCarefully remove as much residual PBS as possible.\nDissolve the pellet in an appropriate amount of the RNA isolation reagent (e.g., 3 mL for a T75 culture flask, 1 mL for a 10 cm plate).\n\t\tNOTE: Insufficient amounts of the reagent might impact the RNA yield.\nRNA extraction and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion\n\t\nTo 1 mL of homogenized cells in the RNA isolation reagent, add 200 µL of chloroform, vortex for 15-20 s until bright pink, and then incubate for up to 3 min until phase separation is visible.\n\t\tNOTE: The pink lipid phase should settle at the bottom. If this is not the case, the vortexing time was likely insufficient.\nSpin at maximum speed (~ 20,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase to a new tube.\nClean up the RNA by sodium acetate-ethanol precipitation (see step 2.5) or a column-based approach (see step 2.6), and elute in a sufficient volume of NF H2O.",
    "Check the RNA integrity on an agarose gel. Look for two bands corresponding to the two ribosomal subunits.\nDeplete the rRNAs using the preferred approach, and elute in an adequate volume (typically 20-50 µL) of NF H2O.\n\t\t​NOTE: For downstream applications, ~500 ng of total RNA is suggested in a volume of 8 µL. Non-ribosomal RNAs typically make up only 5%-10% of the total RNA.\nQuantify using a spectrophotometer.\nLibrary generation\n\t\nUse gene-specific RT-PCR or other approaches to generate libraries15. If using random hexamers for priming, add an incubation step at a low Tm (37-42 °C) to allow for hexamer annealing.\n\t\tNOTE: Standard library generation kits can also be used by replacing the RT enzyme with TGIRT and changing the RT temperature to 57 °C.\nColumn-based RNA cleanup using the RNA Clean & Concentrator columns\n\t​NOTE: All steps should be conducted at room temperature.\n\t\nAdd NF H2O to the sample tube to bring it to a volume of 50 µL.\nAdd 100 µL of binding buffer and 150 µL of 100% ethanol to the sample.\nMix and transfer to a spin column.\nSpin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 30 s; discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 400 µL of RNA prep buffer.\nSpin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 30 s; discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 700 µL of RNA wash buffer.\nSpin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 30 s; discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 400 µL of RNA wash buffer.\nSpin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 30 s; discard the flowthrough.\n(Optional) Transfer the column to a new collection tube, and spin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 2 min.\nTransfer the column to a clean RNAse-free tube and add an appropriate amount of NF H2O.\nSpin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 1 min.\nAcid phenol-chloroform RNA extraction.",
    "Add an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol.\nVortex thoroughly, and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 5 min.\nIf there is no phase separation, add 20 µL of 2 M NaCl, and repeat the centrifugation.\nTransfer the aqueous phase into a new tube.\nAdd 500 µL of isopropanol and 2 µL of co-precipitant.\nMix and incubate at RT for 3 min; then, incubate at −80 °C overnight.\nPellet the RNA by centrifugation at maximum speed (~ 20,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C.\nWash the pellet with 200 µL of ice-cold 70% ethanol.\nSpin at maximum speed (~ 20,000 × g) for 5 min; discard the flowthrough.\nResuspend the pellet in the appropriate amount of NF H2O.\nColumn-based cDNA cleanup using the Oligo Clean and Concentrator columns\n\tNOTE: All the steps should be conducted at room temperature.\n\t\nAdd NF H2O to the sample tube to bring it to a volume of 50 µL.\nAdd 100 µL of binding buffer and 400 µL of 100% ethanol.\nMix and transfer to a spin column.\nSpin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 30 s; discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 750 µL of DNA wash buffer.\nSpin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 30 s; discard the flowthrough.\n(Optional) Transfer the column to a new collection tube and spin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 2 min.\nTransfer the column to a clean RNAse-free tube, and add an appropriate amount of NF H2O.\nSpin at 10,000-16,000 × g for 1 min.\n3. Analysis of the sequencing data\nNOTE: To create RNA secondary structure models from the DMS-MaP sequencing data, the resulting .fastq files must be processed by several different steps. These steps can be automatically performed using the\nTrim the adaptor sequences with TrimGalore or Cutadapt.",
    "Map the reads to the reference sequences (.fasta format) using Bowtie2.\nCount the reads with specialized RNA structure software (e.g., DREEM14, RNA-Framework17, or similar), and create reactivity profiles.\n(Optional) Cluster the reads to find alternative RNA conformations using DREEM14, DRACO17, DANCE-MaP18, or similar.\nPredict the minimum free energy structure based on the reactivity profiles using RNAStructure12, ViennaRNA, or similar.\nVisualize the RNA11 structure using VARNA (https://varna.lri.fr/) or similar.\n\tNOTE: For practicality, software such as DREEM (www.rnadreem.org) and RNA-Framework19 vastly incorporate steps 1–-5 in their pipelines, which streamlines the analysis process. However, any structure prediction should be handled with care (e.g., by verifying the structure's agreement with the data20."
