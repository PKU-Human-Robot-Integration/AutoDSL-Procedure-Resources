    "A schematic overview of TeloPrime mapping of capped ends is presented in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201018/20201018182052_1610.jpgFigure 1. Schematic overview of cap methyltransferase activity assay. The population of cytoplasmic RNA (large black arrow) is reverse transcribed using the primer (small grey arrow) and reverse transcriptase (large grey arrow) included in the TeloPrime kit. The resulting mRNA:cDNA hybrid is ligated to a double-stranded DNA adapter that has a 5′ overhanging C residue on the antisense strand (red arrow) that weakly base pairs with m7G of the cap. Note that the G of the cap is not reverse transcribed. Ligation is performed using a proprietary double stranded DNA ligase included in the TeloPrime kit. RNA is then removed by second strand synthesis (large blue arrow) and specific transcripts are PCR amplified, using primers to the gene of interest (small purple arrow) and to the ligated adapter (small black arrow). Products are separated on a non-denaturing gel that is subsequently stained with SYBR Gold. DNA recovered from individual bands can be sequenced directly, cloned and sequenced, or secondarily processed to add Illumina sequencing adapters.Isolation of cytoplasmic RNANuclear RNA must be removed to assay cytoplasmic recapping. The following steps are used to isolate cytoplasmic RNA.Two to three days in advance, seed 10-cm or 15-cm dishes with U2OS, HEK293, or other adherent mammalian cells, at a density that will reach ~80-90% confluence at the time of harvesting. U2OS cells should be grown in McCoy’s 5A medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS; HEK293 cells should be grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells should be grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.On the day of harvesting the cells, chill Cytoplasmic lysis buffer (see Recipes) on ice. Leave out dithiothreitol (DTT) and RNAseOUT until immediately before use.",
    "Remove culture medium from adherent cells and rinse with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Harvest the cells by scraping into 1 ml of PBS using a cell lifter and transferring to 1.7 ml centrifuge tubes. Gently pellet the cells (70 x g for 10 min at 4°C), and then carefully remove the supernatant. Make note of the approximate volume of the cell pellets and place the tubes on ice.Add a volume of Cytoplasmic lysis buffer equivalent to 4-5 times the volume of each cell pellet. Gently resuspend the cells with 10 up-and-down strokes of a P1000 pipet. Incubate the cells on ice for 10 min, and then mix with 5 additional up-and-down strokes of the P1000 pipet.Remove nuclei by centrifuging at 16,100 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, then transfer the supernatants to new, pre-chilled 1.7 ml tubes on ice.Recover cytoplasmic RNA from the supernatant using Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrator-25 according to manufacturer’s instructions.

    "Shown is a gel for cap end PCR products for mCherry, one mRNA that has only a single capped species (RPS3), and two mRNAs that have capped ends located both at the canonical RefSeq cap site (indicated with a black dot) and further downstream. C. PCR amplification of EIF3D and EIF3K generated closely spaced bands. These were excised in a single gel piece and cloned, and multiple colonies were sequence to identify capped ends. The sequences of 24 colonies from EIF3K are shown beneath the figure, with the RefSeq sequence in bold and the number of colonies of a particular sequence indicated in parentheses (data are from Del Valle Morales et al., 2020).Purification of gel bandsThe bands of interest are excised and purified from the gel. The purified PCR products can be directly sequenced or in the case of multiple bands, cloned into plasmids for sequencing.Place the gel on a UV transilluminator set to 300 nm wavelength. While wearing gloves, lab coat, and a face shield, use a clean razor blade to excise the band of interest of the gel (see Note 6).Place the gel slice in a 0.6 ml microfuge tube having a hole at the bottom made with an 18 G needle. Note that if there are multiple closely spaced (as in Figure 2 with EIF3K and EIF3D) these should be recovered in a single gel slice and processed for cloning as described in Procedure H.Place the punctured microfuge tube with the gel slice in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 x g at room temperature to shred the gel. Add 5x volume of RNase-free water to the shredded gel slice. Incubate overnight at room temperature with rotation.",

Incubate the reaction at room temperature for 1 h.Transform 3 μl of the ligated vector to Stellar competent cells following the manufacturer's instructions. Plate the transformed cells on LB/Ampicillin plates and incubate overnight at 37 °C. The next day pick individual colonies from the LB/ampicillin plate with a sterile 10 μl pipette tip and transfer the colonies to a 5 ml bacterial culture tube containing liquid medium (LB/ampicillin). Incubate the bacterial culture tube in an incubated shaker overnight at 37 °C. To control for the recovery of plasmids without inserts at least 50 colonies should be sequenced.The following day purify the plasmid DNA from the bacterial culture tube using NucleoSpin Plasmid kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
