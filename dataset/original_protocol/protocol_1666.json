    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample collection\nTiming: 20 min\nAsk the donor to open the mouth.\nTake a Sugi® Eyespear from an unopened and sterile package.\nCritical: Using swabs, which have been exposed to air for periods longer than 12 h might result in poor absorption performance.\nAlternatives: Sugi® products portfolio is a swab device of different shapes and dimensions which are made of or contain the same medical grade material, therefore we expect the same or similar performance. Although we test only Sugi® Eyespear.\nPress the Sugi® swab softly onto the surface of the location of interest as described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1224_1.csv\nFor the three oral locations of interest anatomical descriptions and sampling procedure are reported in the table above.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1224-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Tips and tricks for sampling\n(A and B) The three pictures on the top show how to insert the Sugi® absorbent swab into the Salimetrics storage tube (A), whereas the three pictures on the bottom display wrong head positions (marked with a red X) and the correct head position to maintain during sampling procedures (marked with a green check mark) (B).\nNote: When placing the swab on the location of interest, be careful to not touch other external or oral surfaces (external surface, lips, teeth, etc.), in order to avoid cross-contamination.\nCritical: For above- and below- the tongue oral locations, “Table1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] - How to sample - step e.” is the essential step to ensure a correct sample collection, absence of contact between the swabs and the oral surfaces of interest will result in low volume or missing collection.",
    "Critical: For cheek, “Table1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] - How to sample - step c.” is the essential step to ensure a correct sample collection, absence of mechanical stimulation on the inner cheek will result in low volume or missing collection.\nAsk the donor to close the mouth.\nCritical: Allowing the donor to keep the mouth open during sample collection might result in a dry mouth and missing sample, especially in the case of multiple collections the mouth must be closed during sample collection.\nAsk the donor to maintain the head in a neutral position.\nWait for 2.5 min.\nPull out the swab and place the Sugi® device in a storage tube.\nNote: The swab does not fit completely inside the swab storage tube, but it is possible to squeeze the swab inside using the purple cap (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1224-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Anatomical descriptions for spatial sampling\n(A–C) The three pictures on the top are a visual demonstration of how to sample the cheek area (A), the two pictures in the middle show visually how to sample the above the tongue area (B) and the two pictures on the bottom are a visual demonstration of how to sampling the below the tongue area (C).\nPause point: The collected samples can be stored at −20°C for a period shorter than 1 week, for longer periods samples must be stored at −80°C. Several pause points are suggested in this protocol. However, we suggest to limit the freeze-thaw cycle to a single time.\nCritical: To ensure optimal collection from the cheek area the donor needs to maintain the head in a neutral position (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nSample preparation\nTiming: 1.5–3 h\nCentrifuge the storage tube at 1500 ×g for 15 min at 4°C.",
    "Note: The storage tube has an inner holder tube which allows to centrifuge the saliva out of the swab.\nRemove the swab from each storage tube after centrifugation.\nPause point: The processed samples can be stored at −20°C for a period shorter than one week, for longer periods samples must be stored at −80°C. Several pause points are suggested in this protocol. However, we suggest to limit the freeze-thaw cycle to one single time.\nAfter centrifugation, transfer 25 μL from each sample to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube for “LC method 1” or 40 μL for “LC method 2”.\nNote: The volume to be transferred can be adjusted as needed in order to ensure sufficient material for at least two injections and the aliquot needed to constitute the QC pool samples (step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] - step 22).\nOptional: If the volume collected is sufficient, additional aliquots might be stored as a backup.\nControl sample. Generate a minimum of six control samples by adding 30 μL of water to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and work up in parallel to your study samples (see below)\nNote: The samples of H2O are referred as “control” and critical for the statistical analysis.\nAdd ice cold MeOH in a 4:1 (v/v) ratio.\nPlace the samples at −20°C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 18,000 ×g for 20 min at 4°C.\nTransfer 90% of the initial volume of the supernatant into 2 mL glass vials.\nDry under a gentle stream of nitrogen.\nPause point: The processed samples can be stored at −20°C for a period shorter than 1 week, for longer periods samples must be stored at −80°C. Several pause points are suggested in this protocol. However, we suggest to limit the freeze-thaw cycle to a single time.",
    "Re-constitute the dried aliquots with 25 μL of 85:15 ACN:H2O (v/v %) for “LC method 1” or with 40 μL of 1:99 MeOH:H2O (v/v %) for “LC method 2”.\nNote: The volume used to reconstitute the dried aliquots is the same volume as has been transferred after centrifugation (step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] - step 10).\nOptional: Dried aliquots can be re-dissolved in a smaller volume to concentrate the samples.\nSonicate for 1 min.\nVortex for 5 s.\nTransfer the prepared solution into a glass vial equipped with a micro-vial insert.\nSamples are ready for analysis.\nPrepare a QC pool sample by transferring an aliquot of each reconstituted sample into a glass vial equipped with a micro-vial insert.\nNote: Calculate the necessary aliquot size for generating sufficient QCpool sample. Do not add aliquots from the control samples to the QC pool.\nPrepare a blank sample by filling a glass vial with 85:15 ACN:H2O (v/v %) for “LC method 1” or with 1:99 MeOH:H2O (v/v %) for “LC method 2”.\nNote: Ensure sufficient blank samples for your analysis batch.\nLC-MS/MS analysis\nLC method 1: Chromatographic separation is performed using a Nexera X2 UHPLC (Shimadzu) (or comparable) employing an Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC column (130Å, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm) (Waters). The column is kept at 40°C, and the injection volume is 2 μL. Gradient elution is performed using 10 mM ammonium acetate in H2O (eluent A), and ACN (eluent B). The flow rate is 0.4 mL min-1. The gradient is as follows: 0–1 min, 95 % B, 9–10 min, 40 % B, 10.5–17.5 min, 95 % B (equilibration).",
    "LC method 2: Chromatographic separation is performed using a Nexera X2 UHPLC (Shimadzu) (or comparable) employing a Synergi Hydro-RP column (100Å, 2.5 μm, 2 mm × 100 mm) (Phenomenex). The column is kept at 40°C, and the injection volume is 2 μL. Gradient elution is performed using 0.1% formic acid in H2O (eluent A), and 0.1% formic acid in MeOH (eluent B). The flow rate is 0.4 mL min−1. The gradient is as follows: 0–1 min, 95 % B, 9–10 min, 40 % B, 10.5–17.5 min, 95 % B (equilibration).\nMass spectrometry analysis is carried out using a TripleTOF 6600 (Q-TOF instrument, Sciex) (or comparable). The MS instrument is scanning from m/z 100 to 1000 for MS1 and from m/z 50 to 1000 for MS2 experiments. Measurement conditions are described in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1224_2.csv\nAll parameters required to ensure reproducible MS measurements are reported. When parameters diverge between ESI+ mode and ESI− mode, ESI− parameters are reported in brackets.\nBatch structure\nFor system equilibration the first eight samples of the batch are Injected as follows:\nFive equilibration blank samples with a composition equal to the HPLC starting condition.\nTwo QCpool samples, for further stabilizing the system.\nOne equilibration blank.\nNote: Equilibration samples are for system stabilization only and should be excluded from further data analysis.\nSubsequently, repeat the following sequence until all the samples are injected:\nOne QCpool.\nFive randomized samples (including prepared control samples (cf step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] - step 11).\nOne QCpool.\nA blank.\nNote: The order of samples among all sequences must be randomized in order to avoid batch effects.\nNote: The number of QCpool injected corresponds to 20%–25% of the total injections which ensures the analytical consistency of the data.\nEnd the batch with the following injections:\nA QCpool.\nOne blank.",
    "Note: Calibration is carried out using commercial (SCIEX) ESI calibration solutions for SCIEX Triple TOF systems. A calibration sample is injected at a flow rate of 50 μL min−1 each eight injections after a blank injection. ESI positive calibration and ESI negative calibration solutions are used for positive and negative mode respectively. Calibration samples are not included during batch setup but will automatically be run on Triple TOF 6600 systems."
