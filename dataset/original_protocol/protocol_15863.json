    "To search the Protein Ensemble Database (PED), please visit the webpage at https://proteinensemble.org/[href=https://proteinensemble.org/]. PED is an open-access database freely available without registration. In this protocol, we describe the different options for searching the database, browsing the ensembles, and retrieving relevant information.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nWhile PED works best on laptop or desktop computers, it is also accessible from smartphones and tablets. An active and stable internet connection is required.\nSoftware\nInternet browser. The browsing was optimized for Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/[href=http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/]), Google Chrome (http://www.google.com/chrome/[href=http://www.google.com/chrome/]), and Safari (http://www.apple.com/safari/[href=http://www.apple.com/safari/]).\nInput data\nNo input data are required\nPerforming a text search\n1. Open a web browser and connect to the Main page of the Protein Ensemble Database at https://proteinensemble.org/[href=https://proteinensemble.org/].\n2. Searches in PED can be performed in two ways:\n         \nUsers can perform a search using the “Search” box on the top-middle of the PED home page. After typing the query text in the box, hit the “Search” button (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0001]).\nUsers can look for a specific protein, e.g., Sic1 from yeast, by submitting the protein name, e.g., Sic1 or its corresponding UniProtKB (UniProt Consortium, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0039]) accession, P38634. This will redirect them to a list of associated PED entries.\nUsers might also be interested in looking for a specific publication. To do so, please provide a valid identifier of the publication, i.e., the corresponding PubMed (White, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0042]) identifier (PMID) or DOI.",
    "Alternatively, users can perform an advanced search by connecting to the Browse page of the Protein Ensemble Database at https://proteinensemble.org/browse/[href=https://proteinensemble.org/browse/]. Navigation to the Browse page is also possible from the Main page by clicking the corresponding button in the navigation panel, i.e., the first button on the top-right, titled “Browse” (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0001]). A search can be performed here using the search box by typing the query text, or a combination of queries, e.g., “UniProt ACC” and “experimental tag.” This search field is auto-updating, so that there is no need to click a button to register each change.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/89912a85-c4f3-4eb1-b129-0caf7e0a5ec5/cpz1192-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nThe Main page of PED.\n3. Select a term from the drop-down menu on the Browse page. The option selected from the drop-down list will limit the content being searched. Users can perform the following functions:\n         \nIt is possible to perform a free text search in the database by selecting the “free text” term from the drop-down menu.\nFor a specific experiment-centric page, select the “Entry identifier” term and look for a specific PED identifier, e.g., PED00001.\nFor all the experiment-centric pages, i.e., entries of conformational ensembles, associated to a specific protein, select the “UniProt ACC” term, e.g., P38634. This will retrieve all the experiment-centric entries associated with yeast pSic1.\nSelect the “Experimental tag” term to look for a specific experimental tag, e.g., “NMR” or “EOM.” This will retrieve all the entries associated with the tag(s). Three categories of tags are available—depending on the experimental setup used to generate the conformational ensemble—and are highlighted in the Browse table in yellow for the tags related to “measurement methods,” in orange for the tags describing “ensemble generation methods,” and in red for the tags associated to “molecular dynamics” simulations.",
    "Find conformational ensembles from a specific author by selecting the “Data owner” name and looking for the author's name. A list of the entries from that author will appear.\nFind all the entries curated by a specific biocurator by selecting the “Biocurator name” and specifying the biocurator's name.\nFind a specific protein. By selecting the “Protein name” term and looking for “Sic1” it is possible to retrieve all the entries deposited in PED related to that protein, i.e., PED00001, PED00023, PED00159, PED00160, and PED00161.\nA specific publication. In this case it is possible to select the “Publication title” option and enter the title of the publication into the search box or to search for the identifier of a publication—PubMed identifier or DOI—by selecting the “Publication ID” term.\nLook for PED entries cross-referenced to entries in DisProt, e.g., DP00631, or to raw experimental data deposited in SASBDB or BMRB, e.g., “16659” is a BMRB cross-reference, by selecting the “Cross-reference (PDB, BMRB, SASBDB)” term.\n4. Users can customize the table columns shown on the Browse page to visualize more/fewer details of the entries. By default, all columns are shown, i.e., “UniProt ACC,” “PED identifier,” “PED title,” “Coverage (to UniProt),” “Number of ensembles,” and “Number of conformers.”\nA more detailed description of the ways to search the Protein Ensemble Database follows, with dedicated examples.\nSearching for PED entries associated with a specific protein: The p53 use case\nThis section demonstrates how to look for all the entries—protein-centric and experiment-centric—associated with a specific use case, the p53 protein.\n5. Open a web browser and connect to PED at https://proteinensemble.org/[href=https://proteinensemble.org/], then select the “Browse” button from the top bar. Alternatively, directly access the Browse page of the Protein Ensemble Database at https://proteinensemble.org/browse/[href=https://proteinensemble.org/browse/] and select the type of search next to the search box.",
    "6. Entries associated with p53 can be retrieved by searching for the “Protein name” term and entering p53 in the Search box. This will immediately retrieve all the entries related to p53 in PED. The displayed results now include PED identifiers associated with more than one UniProt ACC, since p53 is part of multiple protein complexes with other proteins, e.g., for PED00037 (https://proteinensemble.org/PED00037[href=https://proteinensemble.org/PED00037]), the experimental entry titled “Solution Structure of p53-TAD::Cbp-TAZ1 fusion protein” is related to both the CREBBP (https://proteinensemble.org/P45481[href=https://proteinensemble.org/P45481]) and p53 (https://proteinensemble.org/P04637[href=https://proteinensemble.org/P04637]) protein pages.\n7. Users can then choose if they want to explore the protein-centric or the experiment-centric pages.\n         \nTo access the protein-centric page of p53, click on the “P04637” button in the first column of the result table. This will redirect the user to the protein entry, where it is possible to visualize all the conformational ensembles associated with the protein.\nTo access the experimental entry “Solution Structure of p53-TAD::Cbp-TAZ1 fusion protein,” click on the PED00037 button in the second column of the results table of the Browse page to be redirected to the page dedicated to this conformational ensemble.\nUsers can also directly search for the UniProt accession number of the p53 protein, i.e., P04637.\n8.

This will redirect the user to the protein entry, where it is possible to visualize all the conformational ensembles associated with the protein.\nTo access a specific experimental entry, “Structural ensemble of the complex between Tfb1 (2-115) and the activation domain of p53 (20-73),” click on “PED00087” (https://proteinensemble.org/PED00087[href=https://proteinensemble.org/PED00087]) in the second column of the results table of the Browse page to be redirected to the page dedicated to this conformational ensemble.\nExploring specific experimental setup using the controlled vocabulary of PED\nTo explore whether a specific experimental setup has been used by someone to model ensembles, users can employ the searchable experimental tags of the controlled vocabulary created and maintained by the PED biocurator team. For instance, one might be interested in a setup where both NMR and SAXS data were used to refine an MD-based pool of conformations generated by an AMBER force field.\n12.

You can add more tags to your search by clicking on the “Add” button on the right. The new search field that appears will be set to the default value “Free text.”\n16. Change the type of the second search field to “Experimental tag” similarly as before and enter the second keyword ’NMR.’\n17. Click again on the “Add” button on the right.\n18.

    "PED has a RESTful API for the programmatic access to retrieve entries and corresponding ensemble models, or to perform a customized search in the database. The Help page of PED lists all API endpoints with short descriptions and examples (https://proteinensemble.org/help#api[href=https://proteinensemble.org/help#api]). These endpoints are available from the https://proteinensemble.org/api/{endpoint_name} URL. Below, we exemplify three procedures, with explanations, using a Python script as a client: (i) how to retrieve metadata of entries; (ii) how to download ensembles; and (iii) how to search for the available ensembles associated with a protein accession number (UniProt accession) and with both an accession number and a given method.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nWhile PED works best on laptop or desktop computers, it is also accessible from smartphones and tablets. An active and stable internet connection is required.\nSoftware\nInternet browser. The browsing was optimized for Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/[href=http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/]), Google Chrome (http://www.google.com/chrome/[href=http://www.google.com/chrome/]), and Safari (http://www.apple.com/safari/[href=http://www.apple.com/safari/]).\nInput data\nNo input data are required\nHow to retrieve the metadata of entries\nMetadata of experimental entries can be retrieved by using their corresponding PED identifiers. The following syntax must be used to retrieve the metadata of a single entity from PED: https://proteinensemble.org/api/{identifier}, where the “identifier” must be a valid PED ID, for example PED00001. The query is customizable with version and release. Here we provide two python3 code snippets to access the metadata of an entry in JSON format (Code Snippet 1).\nCode Snippet 1:\n         \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\nped_id = \"PED00001\"\nurl = \"https://proteinensemble.org/api/\" + ped_id\nresp_json = requests.get(url).json()\nprint(resp_json)",
    "The JSON output format is easy to parse in Python and in other programming languages using popular JSON parser modules. Code Snippet 2 provides an example to extract information from the JSON outputs of Code Snippet 1. In the following lines of code, the title of the entry and the ensemble identifiers are printed. In addition, all ensemble identifiers are stored in the list variable ensembles_ids.\nCode Snippet 2:\n         \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\nped_id = \"PED00001\"\nurl = \"https://proteinensemble.org/api/\" + ped_id\nresp_json = requests.get(url).json()\nprint(resp_json[\"title\"])\nensembles_ids = []\nfor ensemble in resp_json[\"ensembles\"]:\n ensembles_ids.append(ensemble[\"ensemble_id\"])\nprint(ensembles_ids)\nCode Snippet 2 can access a given entry (here PED00001) and print the corresponding ensembles identifiers.\nHow to download ensembles\nIn this step, we demonstrate how the PDB models of ensembles can be downloaded. For this, in the following code (Code Snippet 3), we make use of the information obtained in Code Snippet 2, specifically the list variable ensembles_ids. Ensemble identifiers stored in the variable are inserted into the URL https://proteinensemble.org/api/get_ensembles[href=https://proteinensemble.org/api/get_ensembles] as a parameter.\nCode Snippet 3:\n         \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\n# get list of ensemble ids\nped_id = \"PED00001\"\nurl = \"https://proteinensemble.org/api/\" + ped_id\nresp_json = requests.get(url).json()\nprint(resp_json[\"title\"])\nensembles_ids = []\nfor curr_ensemble in resp_json[\"ensembles\"]:\n ensembles_ids.append(curr_ensemble[\"ensemble_id\"])\n# get direct link to the downloadable file (url as string)\nurl = \"https://proteinensemble.org/api/download\"\nparameters = {\n `ensemble_id': ensembles_ids\n}\ndownload_link = requests.get(url, params=parameters).text\nprint(download_link)\n# download ensembles\nresp_file = requests.get(download_link.replace(`\"', \"))\nwith open(`PED00001_pdbs.tar', `wb') as f:\n f.write(resp_file.content)\nThe response of the endpoint https://proteinensemble.org/api/get_ensembles[href=https://proteinensemble.org/api/get_ensembles] is a dedicated link stored in the download_link variable that can be used to download the selected ensemble(s). For security reasons, the link remains active for only 30 min. In the end, Code Snippet 3 downloads the selected ensemble into a .tar file.",
    "How to search for the available ensembles associated with a protein accession number (UniProt Acc) or both a protein accession number and a given method\nIn PED there is a built-in, customizable search engine that can also be accessed programmatically via the URL https://proteinensemble.org/api/browse[href=https://proteinensemble.org/api/browse]. In the query, accession numbers (here UniProt accession, “acc”), controlled vocabulary terms, and free text can be given. In Code Snippet 4, we exemplify a very simple search for a UniProt accession (P04637 for human p53). In Code Snippet 5, we extend this to experimental PED entries corresponding to the UniProt accession P38634 (for yeast Sic1) solved by the combination of NMR and SAXS.\nCode Snippet 4:\n         \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\nuniprot_acc = \"P04637\"\nurl = \"https://proteinensemble.org/api/browse?acc=\" + uniprot_acc\nresp_json = requests.get(url).json()\nprint(resp_json)\nCode Snippet 5:\n         \n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport requests\nparameters = {\n `acc' : `P38634',\n `term' : [`NMR', `SAXS']\n}\nurl = \"https://proteinensemble.org/api/browse\"\nresp_json = requests.get(url, params = parameters).json()\nprint(resp_json)\nThe resulting JSON output provides a list of objects representing different PED entries, each including the UniProt accession (uniprot_acc), the number of conformers (number_of_conformations), the number of ensemble replicas (number_of_ensembles), and the PED entry identifiers (entry_id).",
    "Here we present a use case, the Sic1 protein of yeast (https://proteinensemble.org/P38634[href=https://proteinensemble.org/P38634]), to describe how to interpret protein-centric and experiment-centric entries in PED. The Sic1 entry—also shown in the home page examples of PED—was first annotated in 2014 and has been extensively reviewed and updated in 2020 (Lazar et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0022]). It has also been significantly expanded by adding new conformational ensembles.\nSic1—a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor—can interact with Cdc4, and the interaction requires the phosphorylation of the N-terminal tail of Sic1. Phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of Sic1 is indeed sufficient—and required—to enable its targeting to Cdc4. However, although a significant amount of transient secondary and tertiary structure can be found in Sic1, neither binding nor phosphorylation can induce its complete folding. Both experiment-centric entries of the unphosphorylated N-terminal targeting domain (1-90) of Sic1 and of its multi-site phosphorylated state (pSic1) are available in PED (Gomes et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0013]; Mittag et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0026]).\nPED experiment-centric entries are annotated by an expert team of biocurators who aim at capturing the experimental setup used to generate the conformational ensemble, the model organism, and cross-references not only to related entries in other databases, e.g., DisProt (Hatos et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0014]) and IntAct (Orchard, Ammari, Aranda, & Breuza, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0029]), but also to raw experimental data deposited in BMRB (Romero et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0035]) and/or SASBDB (Kikhney et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0017]) when available. Moreover, PED biocurators carefully analyze the PDB files of each submitted ensemble to ensure that they satisfy the required standards of the database and define the ensemble construction, annotating each chain of the deposited PDB file, i.e., name and description, along with the corresponding UniProt ACCs, the boundaries of each protein in the ensemble, and tag sequences, if any.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware",

Navigate to the protein page. Protein pages use the UniProt accession number as identifier; therefore, their URLs are compiled as https://proteinensemble.org/[href=https://proteinensemble.org/] + UniProt ACC. Protein pages can be accessed by two ways:\n         \nLook up the UniProt ACC for the protein of interest by copy-pasting it in the above formula, e.g., the UniProt ACC for the Sic1 protein of yeast is P38634 and will result in the URL https://proteinensemble.org/P38634[href=https://proteinensemble.org/P38634].\nAccess a protein page from the Browse menu option by clicking on a UniProt ACC of a search hit (or from the Home page, by clicking on the search examples provided below the search box ‘Yeast SIC1’).\nBasic details of the protein entry\nProtein names and functional descriptions, as well as organism names and taxonomic IDs, are automatically retrieved from UniProt. In the cross-references section, a link is provided to the UniProt page of the entry, and—to be able to evaluate the intrinsic disorder of the given protein—URLs to MobiDB and DisProt are provided (if available).\n2. After navigating to the protein page of Sic1 as described in step 1, users can visualize the following details that are shown at the top (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0004]):\n         \nUniProt ACC and protein name: P38634—Protein SIC1.\nOrganism and NCBI taxon ID: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c)—ID: 559292",

The first element of the feature viewer is the protein sequence. Please note that for long proteins this may not be displayed with a font size large enough to be easily readable. The available entries and ensembles stored in the database for the given protein are listed below, grouped by entries (collapsed by default). Hovering the cursor over the regions will show the exact region modeled in the ensemble. If multiple replicas constitute an ensemble, those will be listed by clicking on the identifier of an entry. By clicking on the experimental IDs of ensemble replicas, a drop-down panel will display the location of post-translational modifications in the ensemble, the secondary structure content/entropy, and the solvent accessibility along the chain. Repeated clicking on the experimental ID will collapse the panel. The last element of the feature viewer is the experimentally verified disordered region(s) annotated in DisProt (if the protein has curated disorder).",
    "3. Explore the multiple ensembles of Sic1 that are deposited, shown by blue regions annotated by the feature viewer (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0004]). Hovering the mouse over the blue regions reveals the exact length of the regions, e.g., for Sic1 it ranges from amino acid 1 to 90 for all 12 ensemble models.\n4. Visualize the IDs of the PED experimental-centric entries associated with the protein that are displayed on the left, e.g., the first three records are ensemble replicas of PED00001 (PED00001e001, PED00001e002, PED00001e003) and are followed by three other replicas of PED00014 (PED00014e001, PED00014e002, PED00014e003). By clicking on their experimental IDs, e.g., ‘PED00001e001’, the drop-down panel displays the following:\n         \nPost-translational modifications: Six phosphosites scattered around the sequence [3 phosphothreonine residues (TPO) and 3 phosphoserine residues (SEP)].\nSecondary structure: Varying secondary structure entropy along the sequence corresponding to mostly coil-like conformers with low propensities to fold to short transient helices.\nRelative accessible surface area: Very exposed overall surface area for the whole chain.\n5. Observe a DisProt annotation that is available for region 1-90, covering the whole construct used in solving the ensemble.\nList of ensembles with summary statistics",
    "On the bottom of the page, the ensembles are listed on dedicated information cards with clickable PED identifiers (redirecting to the corresponding experimental entry pages), title of the ensemble, and clickable tags from the methods description (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0004]). Their corresponding ensemble replicas have structural snapshots and summary statistics quantifying the secondary structure entropy, relative solvent accessibility, and radius of gyration. Clicking the tags will perform a search for the experimental entries with the selected tag associated with them. A detailed description on the origin of these tags can be found in the section “Exploring an experiment-centric page in PED,” below. Users interested in a single ensemble should click on the experimental entry identifier to be redirected to the corresponding ensemble entry.\n6. Scroll down to the list of ensembles shown below the feature viewer. Here the ensembles shown in the feature viewer are displayed (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0004]).\n7. To explore a specific experiment-centric page, click on its experimental ID, e.g., PED00001 titled ’Structural ensemble of pSic1 (1-90) with phosphorylations at Thr5, Thr33, Thr45, Ser69, Ser76, Ser80.’ This will load the experimental entry page of PED00001. Go back.\n8. To explore a specific experimental setup, click on the corresponding tag, e.g., ’RDC’ methods tag of PED00001.

    "If the available ensembles for a given protein exceed a certain number, manual browsing for relevant entries may require the user to scan a long list of ensembles. To this end, a filtering tool is implemented that enables the (case-insensitive) textual filtering of the entries. The textbox and its ‘Filter’ button are on the left side of the page, immediately above the ensemble info cards. For example, yeast Sic1 ensembles can be filtered either for a given phosphosite, like phosphothreonine in position 5, that returns experimental entries containing Thr5 in the title, or for a method, like “smFRET,” that returns a different subset of entries for Sic1 determined by this method. This is described in detail in the following steps of the protocol:\n9. Click in the textbox of the filtering tool, type Thr5, and click on ’Filter’ After filtering out those that do not have this term, in the list of remaining hits the ensembles PED00001, PED00014 should be followed by PED000161.\n10. Delete the text Thr and click on ’Filter’.\n11. Click again in the textbox of the filtering tool and type smFRET, and click again on ‘Filter’. The top 3 ensembles displayed should be PED00159, PED00160 and PED000161, all containing the word smFRET in either the title or among their methods tags.\nExploring an experiment-centric page of PED\nBasic details of the experimental entry\nExperimental entry pages are identified with unique PED IDs in a format PED\\d{5} with 5 digits. This PED ID is found on the top of the entry page along with the title of the ensemble determination experiment. This is followed by the name and contact info of data owners and the associated publication (PubMed ID or DOI also supplied).",
    "12. Open the PED00001 experimental entry page (https://proteinensemble.org/PED00001[href=https://proteinensemble.org/PED00001]) for the multi-phosphorylated Sic1 protein determined by NMR and SAXS measurements (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e3d57f1a-3b27-4f6d-ab2e-b17cbd6c1ee2/cpz1192-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nExample of the experiment-centric entry page: PED00001—Structural ensemble of pSic1 (1-90) with phosphorylations at Thr5, Thr33, Thr45, Ser69, Ser76, Ser80. Basic details of the ensemble with cross-references, methods description, and a feature viewer with the ensemble-modeled constructs are shown in panel (A), while some of the ensemble replicas are shown in panel (B) with the structure viewer, Ramachandran maps, and Rg distributions.\n13. The name of the data owners matches the authors of the associated article published by Forman-Kay and collaborators (Mittag et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0026]) (35). The entry has a PubMed ID (20399186) as a cross-reference to the associated publication.\nThe ensemble determination and modeling methodology is summarized in a three-way structure: ‘Experimental procedure’, ‘Structural ensemble calculation’, and, when available, ‘Molecular dynamics’. From these manually curated sections, searchable tags are automatically extracted with the use of a pre-compiled controlled vocabulary (to browse the hierarchical terms, see the Controlled vocabulary section on the About page of PED at https://proteinensemble.org/about[href=https://proteinensemble.org/about]). Furthermore, cross-references to the experimental raw data (SAXS: SASBDB, NMR: BMRB) and curated evidence of the disordered state from DisProt, when available, are provided.\n14. In PED00001, users can see that only the ‘Experimental procedure’ and ‘Structural ensemble calculation’ aspects of the methods description were curated by five biocurators as relevant sections (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0005]).",
    "15. The tags extracted from these texts refer to the NMR measurements (‘NMR’, ‘RDC’, ‘chemical shift’, ‘relaxation’, ‘T2 relaxation’ and ‘PRE’), the SAXS measurement (‘SAXS’), and the software used to assign, process, fit, and evaluate the data (‘ShiftX’, ‘CRYSOL’, ‘CNS’, ‘TraDES’ and ‘ENSEMBLE’). By clicking on these tags, the user will be redirected to the Browse page and shown the hits for the ensembles having the given tags assigned (as described in Exploring a protein-centric page of PED; step 8, above).\n16. The NMR experimental raw data is available in BMRB with ID:16659, thus cross-referenced in PED00001.\n17. PED00001 also has a cross-reference to DisProt that points to the curated disorder pieces of evidence of Sic1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0005]).\nFeature viewer\nA feature viewer is provided on the experimental entry page (bottom of Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0005]) to visualize the basic features of the chains that compose the assembly in the ensemble model. The first element of the feature viewer is the protein sequence corresponding to the construct modeled in the deposited PDB-type structure files. This is followed by the fragments of the construct that may indicate the presence of cloning/purification/fluorescent, etc., tags and describe the build-up of fusion constructs. Post-translational modifications (PTMs), mutations, and other deviations from the specified construct are described in the next line. Hovering the mouse over the PTM/mutation will provide more information on the type of modification/mutation and the associated changes. The last two elements of the feature viewer display the secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of the chain in the same way as described in the previous section. If the ensemble has more than one chain, these elements are repeated for each chain.",
    "18. The construct of PED00001 is built up from a single chain (Chain ‘A’) of two fragments: a dipeptide tag with sequence ‘GS’ and a fragment corresponding to the region 1-90 of yeast Sic1 (O14558) (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0005]).\n19. The construct has six phosphosites scattered around the sequence [3 phosphothreonine residues (TPO) and 3 phosphoserine residues (SEP)] as mentioned in the previous section.\n20. Secondary structure and RSA annotation works the same way as described for the Protein page (Exploring a protein-centric page of PED; step 4b-c, above).\nDeposited ensembles\nFor each of the ensemble replicas modeled and deposited by the authors, the replica ID (PED\\d{5}e\\d{3}) and the number of conformers in the ensemble are displayed along with the chain names. A structure viewer shows (maximum) 10 conformers of the ensemble sampled with different compactness values. The active chain—tag in blue color—is shown in the structure viewer as well, while the other chains are colored light gray. Chain statistics with regard to secondary structure entropy, RSA, and average radius of gyration (Rg), as well as an Rg distribution box plot and Ramachandran maps, are displayed for the active chain.\n21. Scroll down to the deposited ensembles of PED00001 (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0005]).\n22. Compare the number of models in the three deposited conformational ensemble replicas: all are modeled by 10-11 conformers.\n23. The summary statistics for the three replicas are very similar (secondary structure entropy: 0.39-0.44; RSA: 0.68-0.70; average Rg: 26.71-28.15 Å).\n24. Based on the Rg distributions, users can see that the box plots are sampling almost the same distribution, i.e., the differences between the replicas are not significant (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0005]).\n25. Very similar tendencies can also be seen for the Ramachandran maps located next to the structure viewers.",

    "PED provides validation reports for all fully processed experimental entries with completed manual curation pipeline. The validation pipeline is an automated set of program scripts that evaluate the consistency of the metadata curation (e.g., automatically inferred differences between the constructs annotated and found in the models) and the completeness and accuracy of the PDB files (e.g., models should have the same sequence). The biocurators of PED are responsible for ensuring that all entries meet the expected quality standards by requesting changes in the models and metadata and re-running the validation pipeline until no errors are encountered.\nBesides providing quality control, the validation report also generates structural insights by plotting distributions of structural features of the ensemble, such as secondary structure propensities, radii of gyration, and pairwise model similarity.\nIn the following, it is demonstrated how users of the database can interpret the elements of the validation report.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nWhile PED works best on laptop or desktop computers, it is also accessible from smartphones and tablets.

    "The metadata contains the identifier and title of the entry, the corresponding publication, the cross-references, the release date and the name of the depositors, as well as the number of ensemble replicas. In the ‘Overall structure of ensembles’ section, the status, the number of conformer models, and the level of modeling is provided for each ensemble. The level of model resolution might be limited to a very coarse alpha-carbon (CA)−only backbone representation, although this is contraindicated. Current status codes include ‘Uploaded’, ‘Rejected’, ‘Validated’, ‘Processed’, and ‘Completed’. ‘Uploaded’ is assigned to newly uploaded ensembles awaiting validation and ‘Rejected’ to ensembles returning with errors during the validation process. ‘Validated’ is assigned to format-validated ensembles and ‘Processed’ to ensembles that are both validated and assessed using Molprobity, DSSP, and other in-house scripts. Finally, ‘Completed’ is shown for fully processed ensembles for which all the data plots are available. Full validation reports are only generated for ‘Completed’ ensembles.\nThe content of the ensembles is listed by chain fragments, also displaying the corresponding sequence and the corresponding UniProt accessions (if available). Missing, mutated, and modified residues are displayed separately, along with small-molecule ligands.\n         \nThe metadata reports that the entry PED00001 has three multi-phosphorylated Sic1 ensembles in the free state (Mittag et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-bib-0026]), released in 2012.\nIt has two cross-references: one for DisProt DP00631, another for BMRB 16659.\nThe three replicas (PED00001e001, e002, e003) are all ‘Completed’ all-atom models (validation ran without error), comprising 11, 10, and 11 models, respectively (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0006]).\nThe models are composed of a single chain (chain ‘A’) constructed from two fragments: a remnant Gly-Ser tag-linker dipeptide, and the main fragment corresponding to the 90-residue-long N-terminal IDR of Sic1 (UniProt ACC: P38634) as shown in Figure 6B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.192#cpz1192-fig-0006].",
