    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBone marrow thawing and cell counting\nTiming: 1 h\nTo prepare the cryopreserved bone marrow samples for mass cytometry staining, the samples must first be thawed, counted, and viability assessed.\nBefore staining, fill the appropriate number of 15-mL conical tubes (one per sample) with 9 mL of RPMI +10% FBS +1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (named Complete RPMI from now on) and place at 37°C\nPrepare the surface antibody master mix in CyFACs (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1])\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1444_4.csv\nThaw the samples by placing the frozen vial directly into the 37°C water bath until content is thawed, approximately 45 s, few small ice crystals might remain in the vial.\nTransfer the totality of thawed cell suspension into the 15 mL conical containing 9 mL of 37°C complete RPMI\nCount cells using AO/PI (1:1 dilution; 20 μL sample in 20 μL AO/PI) with the Cellometer® Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter\nGently invert the conical containing the freshly thawed cells to ensure accurate cell counts\nAdd 20 μL of the AO/PI-diluted sample to a Cellometer® SD100 Cell Counting Chamber\nCells should be >90% viable\nAdjust concentration of cell suspension to 3 × 106 cells/sample in complete RPMI\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 10 min\nWhile the sample is spinning down, prepare the 103Rh Viability Stain (1:500 dilution of 103Rh Cell-ID intercalator in 37°C warm complete RPMI)\nAfter the sample is spun down, carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant\nResuspend the sample in 1 mL of 103Rh Viability Stain\nIncubate for 15 min at room temperature\nOnce incubation is complete, fill conical up to 5 mL with complete RPMI and spin down (400 g, 10 min)\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet\nResuspend each cell pellet in 50 μL CyFACs and proceed to Fc-block and surface staining",
    "Critical: If cell viability is below 90%, filter the samples using 70 μM cell pre-wetted strainers to obtain a single cell suspension.\nOptional: The surface antibody master mix can be prepared during the viability stain incubation, but we recommend preparing the cocktail prior to the thawing of clinical samples to avoid any critical errors.\nFc-block and surface staining\nTiming: 1 h\nThis portion of the protocol stains the sample with pre-selected metal-tagged antibodies to be acquired and used in downstream analysis. Prior to antibody staining, the samples are Fc-blocked to prevent non-specific staining of antibodies.\nFc-block procedure:\nAdd 5 μL undiluted Fc-block to each sample\nIncubate on ice for 10 min\nDuring the incubation, aliquot the prepared surface antibody cocktail and distribute 50 μL/well according to 96 well plate map\nSurface staining:\nOnce the incubation is complete, distribute the totality of Fc-blocked samples into the appropriate wells (already containing the antibody cocktail) according to the plate map\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature\nDuring incubation, prepare the eBioScienceTM FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer as per manufacturer protocol (https://tinyurl.com/foxp3TF[href=https://tinyurl.com/foxp3TF]) (briefly, mix 1 part fix/perm concentrate (00-5123-43) + 3 parts fix/perm diluent (00-5223-56))\nDuring incubation, prepare the eBioScienceTM Perm/Wash solution by diluting 2 mL of 10× Permeabilization Buffer stock into 18 mL of Ultra-Pure H20\nPellet cells by plate centrifugation (400 g, 5 min)\nCarefully aspirate supernatant (∼ 100 μL), wash once with 200 μL CyFACs, spin plate down (400 g, 5 min) and proceed to intracellular staining\nOptional: The surface antibody master mix can be added individually to each sample well after the Fc-blocked cells have been plated, but this increases risk of technical error and experimental time.\nNote: The FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer is prepared in excess and will be needed for the DNA stain at the end of the protocol.",
    "Permeabilization and intracellular staining\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis portion of the protocol stains the sample with pre-selected metal-tagged antibodies that target intracellular markers. Prior to intracellular staining, the samples are incubated with eBiosciencesTM FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer to preserve cellular morphology while allowing the intracellular antibodies across the plasma membrane to stain intracellularly.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend samples thoroughly in 200 μL of FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature\nDuring incubation, prepare the intracellular antibody master mix\nCritical: Intracellular antibody master mix is made in Perm/Wash.\nNote: Granzyme K was conjugated to the 166Er metal isotope, prior to this protocol via the Fluidigm Maxpar® X8 Antibody Labeling Kit according to the manufacturer protocol (https://tinyurl.com/maxpAbLabeling[href=https://tinyurl.com/maxpAbLabeling]).\nSpin plate down (800 g, 5 min) and wash once with 200 μL of Perm/Wash\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant\nResuspend sample in 50 μL of Perm/Wash\nAdd 50 μL of intracellular master mix (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]) to each well containing sample\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1444_5.csv\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature\nAfter incubation is complete, add 100 μL of Perm/Wash and spin plate down (800 g, 5 min)\nWash once with 200 μL of Perm/Wash\nDuring spin, prepare fresh 4% PFA in Ultra-Pure H2O\nAdd 200 μL of fresh 4% PFA to each sample\nSpin down at 800 g for 10 min and proceed to DNA stain and Pre-Acquisition Wash\nDuring spin, prepare the 191/193 DNA Intercalator at a 1:5000 dilution of 191/193 Cell-ID Intercalator to FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer\nCritical: Spin time was increased to 10 min to improve cell recovery post-fixation of cells.\nDNA stain and pre-acquisition wash\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "The final steps of the protocol stain the cell nuclei to allow for single-cell detection and discrimination by the HeliosTM mass cytometer. After completing the DNA stain, the samples undergo a series of washes to prepare for acquisition.\nAdd 200 μL of 191/193 DNA Intercalator to each sample\nIncubate for 1 h at 4°C\nPause point: Samples can be incubated in intercalator solution overnight (or 8–16 h) at 4°C and protocol can be resumed the following morning\nOptional: If timing of the protocol needs to allow the acquisition within the same day – intercalator staining can be combined with intracellular staining, if extended to 45 min.\nAfter the incubation is complete, pellet cells by plate centrifugation (800×g, 5 min)\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant\nResuspend the samples in 200 μL of MaxPar Cell Staining Buffer\nTransfer the sample into a labeled, polypropylene tube with a 35 μm cell pre-wetted strainer cap\nAdd 300 μL of MaxPar Cell Staining Buffer per tube, bringing the total volume to 500 μL\nSpin the tubes down (800 g, 10 min)\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant\nResuspend the sample in 500 μL of MaxPar Cell Acquisition Solution (CAS)\nLoad 20 μL of sample directly into Cellometer® SD100 Cell Counting Chamber\nSpin the tube down (800 g, 5 min)\nCount the cells using the Cellometer® Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter during spin and record final cell count\nPrepare a 1:5 dilution of MaxPar EQ Calibration beads in CAS (CAS/EQ)\nCritical: Vortex the EQ Calibration beads for 1 min before preparing CAS solution.\nCarefully aspirate and discard supernatant\nResuspend samples at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells per 1 mL of CAS/EQ solution.\nFilter resuspended sample through 35 μm cell pre-wetted strainer cap and proceed to mass cytometer acquisition."
