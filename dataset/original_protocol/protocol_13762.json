    "Prepare 0.5 M potassium-ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (K-EGTA, pH 7.7) by dissolving 47.5 g of EGTA in water, adjust to pH 7.7 with KOH and the final volume to 250 mL, filter-sterilize, and store at room temperature.\nPrepare BRB80 (80 mM K-PIPES, pH 6.8; 1 mM K-EGTA; 1 mM magnesium chloride [MgCl2]) solution by mixing 3.2 mL of 0.5 M PIPES, 40 µL of 0.5 M K-EGTA, and 20 µL of 1 M MgCl2 and adjust the final volume to 20 mL. Store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) by dissolving 435 mg of PMSF in isopropanol to obtain a final volume of 25 mL and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare protease inhibitors mix (200x) by dissolving 10 mg of aprotinin, 10 mg of leupeptin, and 10 mg of 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride in water to obtain a final volume of 2.5 mL, make aliquots of 100 µL, and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 10% Triton X-100 by mixing 5 mL of Triton X-100 in 45 mL of water, filter-sterilize, and store at room temperature.\nPrepare Lysis buffer (BRB80 supplemented with 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 1x protease inhibitors mix and, optionally for HEK-293 cells, 0.2% Triton X-100) on the day of tubulin purification by mixing 20 mL of BRB80 with 1.5 µL of 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 µL of 0.1 M PMSF, 100 µL of the protease inhibitors mix and, optionally for HEK-293 cells, 400 µL of 10% Triton X-100.\n\tNOTE: 2-mercaptoethanol is toxic and should be used in the fume-hood.\nPrepare 0.2 M GTP by dissolving 1 g of GTP in 9.5 mL of water, adjust the pH to 7.5 using KOH, make aliquots of 20 µL, and store at -20 °C.

Add 2.6 g of DTT and 20 mL of 100% glycerol to the mix and stir until the solution becomes homogenous. Add the desired amount of bromophenol blue (2.5 mg) to reach the required color intensity. Make 5 mL aliquots and store at -20 °C. Prepare the 2x working solution of Laemmli sample buffer by diluting the 5x stock in distilled water.\n2. Amplification and harvesting sources of tubulin\nNOTE: In this protocol, three sources of tubulin were used: (i) cells (HeLa S3 and HEK-293) grown as suspension cultures; (ii) cells grown as adherent cultures (HEK-293, HeLa, and U2 OS); and (iii) mouse brain tissue. This protocol considers the day of tubulin purification as ‘day 0’ and accordingly, other steps have been described relative to day 0.\nAmplification of Cells\n\t\nCells Grown as Suspension Cultures\n\t\tNOTE: To successfully purify tubulin from suspension cultures, use at least 2 L of suspension culture.\n\t\t\nFor 2 L of suspension culture, revive and grow the preferred cell type to obtain 6 × 107 cells 10 days before the day of preparation. On day -10, plate cells on six 15 cm diameter dishes at 107 cells per plate.",
    "On day -8, preheat the required amount of complete medium to 37 °C. Add 1 L of pre-heated medium to each spinner bottle under sterile conditions. Place the spinners on a stirrer table set at 20–25 rpm inside the cell culture incubator, slightly open the lateral spinner caps to allow the medium to equilibrate to the incubator’s atmosphere.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To avoid any contamination, thoroughly clean the outer surface of the media and spinner bottles using 70% ethanol.\nOn day -7, trypsinize and collect the cells grown to 80–90% confluence (approximately 1.8 × 108 cells). Collect cells from 3 dishes at a time, spin down (200 × g, 5 min, room temperature), and re-suspend all cells in 10 mL of DMEM.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Thorough dissociation of the cells at this point is very important to avoid the formation of larger aggregates in the spinner bottles, which affects cell survival and results in low tubulin yield.\nAdd 5 mL of the cell suspension to each spinner bottle containing 1 L of DMEM, return the spinners to the stirrer table in the cell culture incubator, and allow cells to grow for one week.\nCells Grown as Adherent Cultures\n\t\tNOTE: To successfully purify tubulin from adherent cells, use a minimum of 10 dishes of 80–90% confluence.\n\t\t\nRevive and amplify the desired cell type to obtain 1 × 108 cells three days before the day of the tubulin preparation.\nOn day -3, plate these cells on ten 15 cm dishes at 1 × 107cells per dish and allow them to grow 80–90% confluence.\nOn day -1, if required, transfect cells with a plasmid to express a tubulin-modifying enzyme or a particular tubulin isotype.\nHarvesting the Cells/Brain Tissue\n\t\nCells Grown as Suspension Cultures",
    "Transfer the cell suspension from spinners into 1 L centrifuge bottles (Table of Materials) and pellet cells at 250 × g, 15 min, room temperature. For immediately starting another culture of HeLa S3 cells in the spinner bottles, leave 100 mL of cell suspension in the spinners, and add 1 L of complete, pre-heated DMEM to the spinner bottle.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Carefully check for bacterial contamination before proceeding for tubulin purification.\nResuspend pelleted cells from each centrifuge bottle in 10 mL of ice-cold PBS, and transfer all the cells into 50 mL screw-cap tubes. During re-suspension, keep the cells on ice. Pellet the cells at 250 × g, 15 min, 4 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Follow recommendations for spinner bottle cleaning and storage (see Table of materials).\nDiscard the supernatant and determine the volume of the cell pellet. From 2 L of suspension culture (two spinner bottles), expect a cell pellet of 5–6 mL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In the protocol described below, the cell pellet volume is assumed to be 10 mL. Adjust the experiment according to the pellet volumes.\nAdd 1 volume (10 mL) of lysis buffer and re-suspend the cell pellet.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The ratio of cell pellet volume to lysis buffer volume is very important for successful tubulin purification. Adding more lysis buffer decreases tubulin concentration, which then fails to reach the critical concentration needed for polymerization, thus greatly reducing the tubulin yield.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Cells resuspended in lysis buffer can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for two months.\nCells Grown as Adherent Cultures\n\t\tNOTE: Cells from adherent cultures must be harvested very quickly for successful tubulin purification (approximately 15 mins for harvesting ten 15 cm dishes). Three people participated in this step of the protocol.",
    "Remove the medium from 15 cm dishes by inclining the dishes, and then gently wash the cells with 7 mL of PBS-EDTA at room temperature (person 1). Work only with three 15 cm dishes at a time to avoid leaving the cells without medium or buffer.\nAdd 5 mL of PBS-EDTA to the cells and incubate them for 5 min at room temperature.\nUse a cell lifter to gently detach the cells by shoveling them to one edge of the dish (person 2), and collect all the cells in a 50 mL screw-cap tube (person 3). Rinse each plate with an additional 2 mL of PBS-EDTA to collect any remaining cells from the dishes. During this step, keep the 50 mL screw-cap tube containing the cell suspension on ice.\nPellet the cells at 250 × g, 10 min, 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and determine the volume of the cell pellet. Expect a volume of ~1 mL from ten 15 cm dishes.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In the protocol described below, the cell pellet volume is assumed to be 10 mL. Adjust the experiments according to the pellet volumes.\nResuspend the cells in 1 volume (10 mL) of lysis buffer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Cells resuspended in lysis buffer can be stored at -80 °C for up to two months.\nBrain Tissue\n\t\tNOTE: Mice of any age, sex, or genetic background can be used. The choice of the transgenic mouse strain will depend on the scientific question to be addressed. In this manuscript, we show the example of tubulin purified from the ttll1-/- mouse, lacking a major brain glutamylating enzyme, the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 1 (TTLL1) protein31.",
    "Sacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation, quickly decapitate, and collect the brain into a round-bottom tube. If there is excess blood on the brain, quickly wash with lysis buffer. Collect the brain as soon as the mouse is sacrificed as a post-mortem delay can affect the success of tubulin purification. Use round-bottom tubes to accommodate the width of the probe used for homogenization.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Collected mouse brains can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for up to 3 years.\nAdd 500 µL of lysis buffer to a single brain extracted from an adult mouse. For the rest of the protocol, the volume of lysis buffer added is assumed to be 10 mL. Adjust for your experiment according to the number of brains to be used.\n3. Lysis of Cells or Brain Tissue\nCells Grown as Suspension Cultures\n\t\nFor HEK-293, lyse the cells on ice by repetitively pipetting up and down using pipette tips of different widths. First, attach a p1000 tip to a 10 mL pipette, and pipette the cell suspension up and down every 5 min, for 10 min (three cycles of pipetting). Second, attach a p200 tip to a p1000 tip and further pipette every 5 min, for 20 min (five cycles of pipetting).\nFor HeLa S3, lyse the cells using a French press (see Table of Materials for settings).\nTake 1/100th volume of the lysis mix (L) (200 µL for 20 mL of L), and add the same volume of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C for further analysis.\nCells Grown as Adherent Cultures",
    "Transfer the cells into a 14 mL round-bottom tube whose height has been reduced to accommodate the sonicator probe (see Table of Materials for settings). Sonicate the cells for ~45 pulses, and confirm cell lysis by sampling a drop of the lysis mix under a microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of pulses could vary according to the cell type used for tubulin purification. Sonicating cells too much could cause tubulin to precipitate and will negatively affect the purification yield.\nPipette the cells up and down on ice every 5 min for 20 min (five cycles of pipetting), using a p200 tip.\nTake 1/100th volume of lysis mix (L) (200 µL for 20 mL of L) and add the same volume of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min and store at -20 °C for further analysis.\nBrain Tissue\nLyse the brain tissue using a tissue blender (see Table of Materials for settings). Alternatively, lyse the tissue using a microtube pestle or an equivalent equipment and pipette up and down on ice with a 1 mL syringe with an 18 G needle.\nTake 1/100th volume of lysis mix (L) (200 µL for 20 mL of L), and add the same volume of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C for further analysis.\n4. Purification of Tubulin\nLysate Clarification",
    "Clear the lysate (separating pellet and soluble fraction of the lysis mix) by centrifugation at 150,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min. See Table of Materials for details about ultracentrifuge rotors and tubes. For cell extracts, a white floating layer is often formed after centrifugation. Do not transfer this floating layer along with the supernatant, as it interferes with tubulin polymerization. Use a syringe of appropriate volume attached to a long 20 G or 21 G needle to gently remove the supernatant without disturbing the floating layer. If the supernatant is still cloudy, centrifuge at 5,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatant (SN1) to an ultracentrifuge tube and note its volume. For a 10 mL cell pellet, expect a volume of ~12 mL for SN1.\nTake 1/100th volume of SN1 (120 µL for 12 mL of SN1), and add the same volume of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C for further analysis.\nResuspend the pellet (P1) in BRB80 (Table of Materials) using the same volume as SN1. Take 1/100th volume of P1 (200 µL for 20 mL of P1), and add the same volume of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C for further analysis.\nFirst Polymerization in Low-Molarity Buffer\n\t\nPrepare the polymerization mix by combining 1 volume of SN1 (12 mL), 1/200th volume of 0.2 M GTP (60 µL; final concentration 1 mM), and 0.5 volume of pre-heated glycerol (6 mL) in a screw-cap tube of the appropriate volume.\n\t\tNOTE: Glycerol is used as a crowding agent in the polymerization steps throughout the protocol and thus is not considered in the calculations of other components’ concentrations.",
    "Pipette the mix up and down, gently avoiding the formation of air bubbles and transfer it to the appropriate ultracentrifuge tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: While transferring the mix to the tubes, adjust the weight of the tubes (in pairs). This allows the experimenter to directly proceed to the sedimentation of microtubules after the polymerization step. Do this for all polymerization steps throughout the protocol.\nCover the tubes with parafilm, transfer to a water bath set at 30 °C, and incubate for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 150,000 × g, 30 °C for 30 min. Remove the supernatant (SN2), and keep the pellet of polymerized microtubules (P2).\n\t\tNOTE: Microtubule pellet can be snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C for up to 1 year.\nTake 1/200th volume of SN2 (90 µL for 18 mL SN2) and add the same volume of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C for further analysis.\nFirst Depolymerization\n\t\nDepolymerize microtubules by adding ice-cold BRB80 to the pellet P2, and leave on ice for 5 min: for tubulin from cells, add 1/60th (200 µL), and for tubulin from brains, add 1/20th (600 µL) of the volume of the SN1.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume of ice-cold BRB80 added to the pellet during depolymerization steps is always relative to the volume of SN1.\nResuspend the microtubule pellet gently, avoiding air bubbles, until the solution is completely homogeneous. Use a p1000 tip for a couple of cycles of pipetting followed by a p200 tip every 5 min, for 20 min (five cycles of pipetting). This is a crucial step for the success of the tubulin purification.",
    "Transfer the solution to appropriate ultracentrifuge tubes, and spin down at 150,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. Transfer the SN3 to a new 1.5 mL ultracentrifuge tube. The pellet formed after this centrifugation step (P3) contains precipitated proteins (microtubule-associated proteins or MAPs) and non-depolymerized microtubules. The supernatant (SN3) contains soluble components: depolymerized tubulin dimers and MAPs, which have detached from the depolymerized microtubules.\nTake 1–4 µL of SN3, and add 9 volumes of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C for further analyses.\nResuspend the pellet P3 in BRB80 (in the same volume of SN3), take 1–4 µL, and add 9 volumes of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C.\nSecond Polymerization (in High-Molarity Buffer)\n\t\nPrepare the polymerization mix by combining 1 volume of SN3 (200 µL), 1 volume of pre-heated 1 M PIPES (200 µL, final concentration 0.5 M), 1/100th volume of 0.2 M GTP (2 µL, final concentration 1 mM), and 1 volume of pre-heated glycerol (200 µL) in a tube of the appropriate volume.\nPipette the mix up and down, avoiding the formation of air bubbles, and transfer it to ultracentrifuge tubes.\nCover the tubes with parafilm, transfer them to a water bath set at 30 °C, and incubate for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 150,000 × g, 30 °C for 30 min. Remove the supernatant (SN4), and keep the pellet of polymerized microtubules (P4). The pellet P4 contains the polymerized microtubules, and the supernatant SN4 contains unpolymerized tubulin, MAPs, and other soluble proteins.\n\t\tNOTE: The microtubule pellet after the second polymerization step can be snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C for up to 1 year.",
    "Take 1–4 µL and add 9 volumes of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C for further analyses.\nSecond Depolymerization\n\t\nDepolymerize microtubules by adding ice-cold BRB80 to the pellet P4, and leave on ice for 5 min: for tubulin from cells, add 1/100th (120 µL), and for tubulin from brains, add 1/40th (300 µL) of the volume of the SN1.\nPipette up and down with a p200 tip every 5 min, for 20 min (five cycles of pipetting).\nTransfer the solution to a 1.5 mL ultracentrifuge tube, and spin down at 150,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. Transfer the SN5 to a new 1.5 mL ultracentrifuge tube. The pellet formed after this centrifugation step (P5) contains non-depolymerized microtubules.

The pellet (P6) contains polymerized microtubules and the supernatant SN6 contains small amounts of non-polymerized tubulin.",
    "NOTE: Microtubule pellets can be snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C for up to 1 year.\nTake 1–4 µL and add 9 volumes of 2x Laemmli buffer, boil for 5 min, and store at -20 °C for further analyses.\nThird Depolymerization\n\t\nDepolymerize microtubules by adding ice-cold BRB80 to the pellet P6, and leave on ice for 5 min: for tubulin from cells, add 1/100th (120 µL), and for tubulin from brains, add 1/40th (300 µL) of the volume of the SN1.\nPipette up and down with a p200 tip every 5 min, for 20 min (five cycles of pipetting).\nTransfer the solution to the appropriate ultracentrifuge tubes, and spin down at 150,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min.
