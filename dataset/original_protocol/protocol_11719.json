  "procedures": [
    "All in vivo procedures used in this study complied with all relevant experimental guidelines for animal testing and research, in accordance with the Brazilian experimental animal use guidelines (L11794). The protocols used for handling chicken embryos were all approved by the Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals in Scientific Experimentation (Health Sciences Centre of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). The use of human cells was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Clementino Fraga Filho (numbers 043/09 and 088/04). Specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs of White Leghorn chicken (Gallus gallus) were used.\n1. Preparation of cell spheroids\nNOTE: Cell spheroids can be prepared with a wide range of cell types as long as they are adherent. For this protocol, human adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) were isolated as previously described21,27 will be used (Figure 2A). Cells were obtained by digesting adipose tissue fragments or lipoaspirates with collagenase IA for 1 h at 37 °C under agitation, followed by plating at 1−2 × 104 cells/cm2 and overnight incubation. Non-adherent cells were discarded, and the adherent cells were expanded for 3-6 passages. ADSCs were homogeneous for the expression of the surface antigens CD105, CD90, CD13, and CD44 and negative for hematopoietic antigens CD45, CD14, CD34, CD3, and CD1927. While the method described here can be performed easily with minimal materials beyond what is routinely used for cell culture, optimal aggregation time and the need for partial dissociation should be determined empirically. Alternative methods for preparing cell spheroids may be employed, such as the hanging-drop method33 or agarose-coated wells34; see the discussion for more details. All procedures should be performed on a clean bench employing aseptic techniques.\nWarm up sterile PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), culture medium, and trypsin solution to 37 °C before cell manipulation.",
    "Culture ADSCs in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Use a confluent 25 cm2 flask of ADSCs for the preparation of two plates of spheroids. Discard the culture medium and wash the culture dish three times with an appropriate amount of sterile PBS (5 mL PBS for each wash if a 25 cm2 cell culture flask is used).\nAdd enough trypsin solution (containing 0.78 mM EDTA) to cover the cells (1 mL of trypsin solution if a 25 cm2 cell culture flask is used) and let the culture flask sit for 5 min at room temperature.\nGently pipette the cells up and down to dissociate them. Add the same amount of culture medium containing FBS to inactivate the trypsin, and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 180 × g. Discard the supernatant, and tap the tube to loosen the pellet.\nResuspend the cells in 500 µL-2 mL of culture medium adequate for the cell type (see step 1.2).\n\tNOTE: The minimum concentration is 5 × 105 cells/mL for adherent cells such as ADSCs and fibroblasts. A confluent 25 cm2 flask of ADSCs should be resuspended in 2 mL of medium and plated in 2 Petri dishes, using 1 mL each. Less adherent cells, such as glia, may benefit from plating at ~2 × 106 cells/mL in a lower volume.\nCarefully transfer the cell suspension to one side of a sterile 60 mm Petri dish (uncoated and untreated, such as those used for preparing agar plates). Try to restrict the culture medium to the smallest possible area (Figure 1B) by propping the dish over a piece of folded, clean gauze to keep it tilted in the incubator.",
    "Incubate the cell suspension at 37 °C, 5% CO2, until cell aggregates are formed (6-8 h after plating the ADSCs).\n\tNOTE: Spheroid aggregation time may vary according to cell type.\nIf required (see discussion), partially dissociate large cell aggregates by gently pipetting up and down using 1000 µL tips. Dissociate ADSC spheroids 6-8 h after plating.\nPlace the plate in the incubator until the spheroids are ready to be transplanted: round with defined edges and not easily dispersed (Figure 1C,D).\n\t​NOTE: ADSC spheroids are ready 2 days after partial dissociation.\n2. Transplantation of spheroids into chick embryos\nPreparation\n\t\nPrepare chicken eggs by incubating 15-30 eggs in a humid incubator at 37.5 °C until the desired Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage is reached35: 40-45 h for grafts in somites at the limb bud level (HH11-12 or 13-19 somites) or 29-33 h for grafts at the cephalic region (HH8-9 or 5-8 somites). Position the eggs horizontally, and draw a line with a pencil on the top of the eggs before incubation (Figure 3D).\n\t\tNOTE: Incubation times may vary slightly according to individual incubators. Drawing a line will ensure that the top portion of the egg, where the embryo is found, can be easily identified if the egg is rotated before the experiment.\nPrepare sharp needles (\"microscalpels\") by attaching a sewing needle to a metal needle holder (Figure 3B). Using an oiled whetstone, sharpen the needle until it resembles a small scalpel with a thin edge (Figure 3C). Alternatively, prepare a sharp tungsten needle by electrolysis36.",
    "Prepare glass capillaries using the flame of a Bunsen burner to briefly melt the thin portion of a glass Pasteur pipette. Remove the molten portion from the flames and stretch it to form a thin capillary. Carefully divide the capillary into two parts by breaking it with microforceps. Prepare a thin capillary for India ink injection and a thick capillary for transferring spheroids (Figure 3B).\n\t\tNOTE: By varying the pulling strength, it is possible to create different capillary gauges. Capillaries should be prepared just before the surgery.\nPrepare the working surface and other materials for egg manipulation (Figure 3A). Sterilize all surgical materials in a 100 °C oven overnight or with 70% ethanol immediately before use. Warm sterile PBS to 37 °C. Attach a 200 µL tip (with barrier) to the aspirator tube assembly for India ink injection and transferring spheroids.\n\t\tNOTE: Use tips with barriers when transferring spheroids of human cells.\nJust before the experiment, add 2 drops of India ink stock solution to the 30 mm Petri dish and mix it with 1 mL of sterile PBS. Remove the spheroid plate from the incubator and place it over an icebox for the rest of the experiment.\nPreparation of each egg\n\t\nRemove one egg from the incubator and place it over an egg holder. Make a small hole in the sharp end of the egg (Figure 2D) and aspirate 1.5 mL of albumen using a syringe and needle. Insert the needle perpendicular to the egg to avoid damaging the egg yolk. Seal the hole using adhesive tape. Optionally, repeat this step for all eggs before the experiment, and reincubate the remainder of the eggs.",
    "Carefully cut open a window on the top of the egg using scissors (Figure 3D). Using the pipette, add 1-2 drops of PBS over the yolk. If necessary, remove large albumen bubbles (such as the ones seen in Figure 3F) using the pipette.\nAttach the thin capillary to the aspirator tube assembly. Fill the glass capillary partially with the India ink solution by aspiration. Inject enough India ink into the yolk under the embryo until the embryonic structures are seen (Figure 3E,F).\nUsing the stereomicroscope, count the number of somites (Figure 4A). Individually number the eggs using a pencil (Figure 4B).\nSpheroid transplantation\n\t\nIdentify the region of the graft: paraxial mesoderm at the wing bud level (presomitic mesoderm of the presumptive 15th to 20th somites37) (Figure 3G and Figure 5A) or presumptive first pharyngeal arch region (between the ectoderm and endoderm lateral to the posterior mesencephalon/first rhombomere38) (Figure 8A).\nCut the vitelline membrane over the target region using a microscalpel.\nUsing a pair of microscalpels, make a shallow cut in the region where the spheroid will be implanted (Figure 3H).\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid damaging the underlying endoderm; otherwise, the yolk will leak (if this happens, discard the egg).\nRemove the thin capillary from the aspirator and replace it with the thick capillary. Observe the spheroids under the stereomicroscope and choose a spheroid approximately the same size as the somite (Figure 2D). Aspirate this spheroid into the capillary.\nGently deposit the spheroid next to the cut region (Figure 3H). Using the sharp needles, push the spheroid into the cut region (Figure 3I,J).\nAdd 1-2 drops of PBS over the embryo using the pipette to ensure that the spheroid is firmly inserted.\n\t\tNOTE: If the graft is dislodged, a new spheroid should be transplanted (steps 2.3.4 and 2.3.5).",
    "Clean any albumin leak from the eggshell using tissue paper to ensure that the egg can be completely sealed, avoiding contamination. Seal the window in the egg using adhesive tape.\nTake note of the grafted region (Figure 4A). Carefully return the egg to the humid incubator at 37.5 °C to avoid dislodging the inserted spheroid.\nIncubate the egg until the desired stage.\n\t\tNOTE: When the xenograft is performed into somites at the limb bud level, migration and cell death have been successfully assayed in 3.5-day-old embryos (HH21), and cell differentiation and tropism have been observed in 6-day-old embryos (HH29) (Figure 5A). Integration into host tissues has been performed in 8-day-old embryos as well (HH33). Donor cells grafted to the pharyngeal arch territory have been studied in 4.5-day-old embryos (HH25) (Figure 8A).\n3. Tissue dissection, fixation, processing, and preparation of histological sections\nDissection and fixation\n\t\nPrepare the fixative (at least 1 mL/embryo): ethanol 100%-formaldehyde 37%-glacial acetic acid in a 6:3:1 ratio. Clean the work surface, a pair of microforceps, surgical scissors or iris scissors, and a slotted spoon. Fill a 60 mm glass Petri dish with cold PBS and place it under a stereomicroscope.\nOpen the egg by cutting out the adhesive tape.\nCut the membranes around the embryo and remove it using the slotted spoon.\nTransfer the embryo to the Petri dish. If the embryo is 5-day-old (HH26) or older, promptly decapitate it before any manipulation ex ovo.\nRemove any remaining membranes using microforceps and scissors. Gently agitate the specimen in PBS to wash away any remaining yolk droplets.\nIf the xenograft was performed at the wing level, discard the head. If cells were grafted to the cephalic region, cut and discard the lower half of the body, ensuring that the cardiac region is kept intact.",
    "Transfer each specimen to a separate 2.0 mL tube containing 1 mL of the fixative. Identify the tubes individually as before (Figure 4B). Incubate them overnight at 4 °C with agitation.\nUse a pellet of cells or spheroids (Figure 4F) as a positive control. For this, centrifuge a cell suspension (step 1.5) or cell spheroids (step 1.10) at 180 × g for 10 min in a 1.5 mL tube, discard the culture medium, and add 1 mL of the fixative without disturbing the pellet. Incubate the tube overnight at 4 °C without agitation, and proceed in the same manner as for the chick samples.\nDehydration and embedding\n\t\nDehydrate the embryos by successive washes of 1 mL of 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol in 1x PBS for at least 1 h each with agitation.\nIncubate the samples overnight in 1 mL of 100% ethanol at room temperature with agitation.\nIncubate the samples in 1 mL of 100% xylene for 1 h in a fume hood. Repeat two more times.\nTransfer the contents of the tube to the staining block and discard the xylene. Add enough molten paraffin to cover the embryo and cover the staining block with its glass lid. Incubate overnight in a 65 °C oven.\nPrepare a warm plate and a mold for paraffin blocks for embedding.\n\t\tNOTE: A pair of stretched-out paper clips are useful for positioning the embryo.\nFill the mold with molten paraffin and transfer the embryo to it. Position the embryo to obtain a transverse section of the trunk (Figure 5A) or a coronal section of the head (Figure 8A).\nInsert a paper name tag in the paraffin, opposite the surface to be sectioned, to help cut the embryo in the correct orientation (Figure 4C).",
    "If being used, place the embedding cassette over the sample. Let the block cool down completely before removing it from the mold. Alternatively, attach the hardened paraffin block to the cassette or other block holder using molten paraffin and let it cool down again.\nSectioning\n\t\nPrepare the materials for sectioning. Warm up a hot plate to 42 °C and cover a cardboard or Styrofoam plate with clean aluminum foil approximately 30 cm x 20 cm. Clean all surfaces before use.\n\t\tNOTE: Use gloves to avoid contamination with nucleases, especially if some sections will be used for RNA in situ hybridization. Avoid using a histology bath to stretch the paraffin sections for the same reason unless the water and surfaces can be thoroughly cleaned beforehand.\nTrim the excess paraffin with a microtome blade. Create a bevel on both sides, in a trapezoidal shape, for easy separation of each section using a scalpel blade in a later step (Figure 3A).\nAttach the block to the microtome. Position the block carefully to ensure that the left and right sides are parallel to each other. Perform a finer adjustment after cutting a few sections of the sample and observing them under a microscope.\nWhen the target region has been reached (either the limb bud or first pharyngeal arch), cut 7 µm sections and place the paraffin ribbons over the plate covered with aluminum foil. Section the whole target region (Figure 4C).",
    "For preparing serial sections, cover the adequate number of slide glasses with drops of sterile deionized water. Transfer individual sections to the slides sequentially, using brushes and a scalpel. Transfer adjacent sections to different slides to create serial sections (Figure 4D). Prepare series of 3 slides for 3.5-day-old, 4 slides for 4.5-day-old, and 5 slides for 6-day-old embryos. Stain adjacent sections with different probes, antibodies, or classical histological stains.\n\t\tNOTE: The same series may contain multiple adjacent slides if a large portion of the embryo is sectioned. Multiple sections can be transferred to each slide, keeping some space between sections to allow them to stretch. Do not place the slide on the warm plate yet.\nAfter all sections have been transferred to the slides, add more water until all the sections are floating over a single water drop. Place the slide on a warm plate and let the sections stretch. Remove the slide from the warm plate, and remove the water by tilting the slide glass carefully against tissue paper.\n\t\t​NOTE: Do not let the sections directly touch the glass slide before they stretch.\nLet the slides dry overnight in a 37 °C incubator.\n4. Synthesis of digoxigenin-labeled  Alu probes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nPrepare a stock solution of the following human-specific primers39: AluFw: 5'-CGA GGC GGG TGG ATC ATG AGG T-3' and AluRev: 5'-TTT TTT GAG ACG GAG TCT CGC-3'.\nPrepare 50 µL of the following PCR reaction40: 1x PCR buffer, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dCTP, 0.1 mM dGTP, 0.1 mM dATP, 0.065 mM dTTP, 0.035 mM dig-11-dUTP, 0.4 µM AluFw primers, 0.4 µM AluRev primers, 0.05 U/µL Taq polymerase, and 1 ng/µL human genomic DNA.",
    "Run the PCR using the following settings: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, followed by a final denaturation of 72 °C for 5 min.\nMeasure the probe concentration using a spectrophotometer. Store the probes at -20 °C.\n\t​NOTE: The PCR product should be 200-300 bp long after electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel29.\n5. Section in situ hybridization with Alu probes\nDay 1: Permeabilization and hybridization\n\tNOTE: A sterilized slide glass jar should be used for all steps performed on day 1.\n\t\nPreheat one wash of PBT (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) in a 37 °C water bath and prepare a moist chamber with 50% formamide/50% deionized water.\n\t\tNOTE: Calculate the volume of all washes based on the glass jar size. Unless specified, all washes are performed by immersion of the slides in the solution.\nRemove the paraffin by three successive washes in xylene, 5 min each, in a fume hood.\nRehydrate the series by two washes in 100% ethanol for 5 min each, followed by 90/70/30% ethanol washes in PBS for 2 min each.\nWash in PBT (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) three times for 5 min each.\nFor permeabilization, add 2 µg/mL Proteinase K to the preheated PBT, immerse the slides in the solution, and incubate them for 14 min in a 37 °C water bath.\nFix the sections by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature.\nWash with PBS for 5 min.",
    "After wiping excess PBS from each slide, cover the sections with 300 µL of hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 4x SSC pH 5.0, 1x Denhardt's solution, 5% dextran sulfate, 100 µg/mL salmon sperm DNA) (Table 1). Incubate for 1 h at 42 °C in the formamide chamber.\nPrepare a solution of 0.2 ng/mL Alu probe in hybridization buffer. Tip the slide to remove the hybridization buffer and add 120 µL of the Alu probe solution over the sections. Cover with a glass coverslip, taking care to avoid bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: Parafilm should not be used to cover the slides in this step, as it will melt at temperatures above 70 °C.\nHeat the slides on a hot plate at 95 °C for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not breathe the formamide fumes.\nIncubate the slides at 42 °C in the formamide chamber overnight.\nDay 2: Stringency washes and immunohistochemistry\n\t\nPrepare 20x SSC buffer (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.5) (Table 1). Preheat two washes of 0.1x saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer, pH 7.5, to 42 °C.\nFill a slide glass jar with 2x SSC buffer, pH 7.5. Gently place the slides in the solution and wait for the coverslips to detach themselves. Remove the coverslips using pincers and incubate the slides in 2x SSC buffer for 5 min at room temperature.\nRewash the slides with 2x SSC buffer, pH 7.5, for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash the slides two times with 0.1x SSC buffer, pH 7.5, at 42 °C for 5 min each.\nWash the slides two times with MABT (maleic acid buffer with Tween; 0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) (Table 1) for 30 min each at room temperature.",
    "Wipe excess buffer from each slide and cover the sections with 400 µL of blocking solution (10% inactivated normal goat serum, 2% blocking reagent in MABT). Incubate for 2 h in a humid chamber (prepared with deionized water) at room temperature.\nTip the slides to remove the liquid and add 150 µL of Fab anti-DIG fragments conjugated to alkaline phosphatase at a 1:2,000 dilution in blocking solution. Cover with a glass coverslip or parafilm and incubate in the humid chamber at 4 °C for 16 h.\nDay 3: Color development\n\t\nGently remove the coverslips or parafilm inside a jar with MABT (as in step 5.2.2), and incubate the slides in MABT for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash with MABT three more times for 30 min each.\nWash with MAB (maleic acid buffer; 0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 7.5) (Table 1) for 30 min.\nWash two times with NTM (NaCl-Tris-MgCl2 buffer; 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM magnesium chloride) (Table 1) for 10 min each.\nAdd the staining solution (0.45 µL/mL 4-Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, 3.5 µL/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine in NTM) (Table 1) to the staining jar and immerse the slides in the solution. Cover the jar with aluminum foil and let the color develop overnight at 37 °C.\nDay 4: Counterstaining and mounting\n\t\nWash the slides three times with PBS at room temperature for 10 min each.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the staining solution is disposed of properly as halogen waste.\nMount the slides as they are by adding drops of an aqueous mounting media and covering the sections with a glass coverslip. Alternatively, proceed to either nuclear fast red or Alcian blue counterstaining.",
    "Wipe away excess PBS and add 500 µL of a nuclear counterstaining solution of 0.1% nuclear fast red41 (Table 1) over the sections and incubate the slides in a humid chamber for 10 min. Tip to remove excess nuclear fast red and proceed to dehydration (step 5.4.5).\nImmerse the sections in 0.5% Alcian blue solution (cartilage counterstain)42 for 10 min; rinse in distilled water and incubate in 1% phosphomolybdic acid for 10 min. Rinse with water again and proceed to dehydration.\n\t\tNOTE: If the phosphomolybdic acid wash is omitted, Alcian blue becomes a nuclear counterstain.\nDehydrate in 70/95/100/100% ethanol for 5 min each.\nWash with xylene three times for 5 min each time in a fume hood.\nMount with a xylene-based mounting medium and glass coverslips.\nLet the slides dry for at least 16 h in a fume hood.\n6. Image acquisition\nAfter the mounted slides are thoroughly dried, examine all sections for the presence of grafted human cells using an upright brightfield microscope (Figure 4E). Look for blue-purple Alu-positive cells (Figure 4F,G) and mark the sections containing Alu-positive cells using a marker pen (Figure 4E).\n\tNOTE: Marking the sections with Alu-positive cells will make it easier to find them while photographing them and comparing adjacent slides stained with other markers.\nTake care to photograph sections containing the xenograft in the same order as their placement on the slide (antero-posterior direction). Name each photo with all relevant information, such as [date of the xenograft]_[cell type]_[embryonic age]_[probe type]_[section number]_001. Include metadata files to add the scale bar later.\nIf other slides from the same series are stained with another marker, e.g., RNA in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry, photograph and name adjacent sections (Figure 6) in the same manner.\nSubscription Required.
