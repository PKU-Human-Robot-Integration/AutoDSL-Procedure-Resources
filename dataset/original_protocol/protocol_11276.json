    "1. Preparation\nPrepare ≥1 x 105 cells/sample in any type of culture vessel as starting material.\nFor example, conduct a time-course experiment after exposure of U87 glioblastoma cells to ionizing radiation: Irradiate sub-confluent U87 cells in T25 flasks in triplicates for each time point. Choose early time-points (15 min up to 8 h after irradiation) to follow the kinetics of DSB repair (γH2AX level) and late time points (24 h up to 96 h) to assess residual DSB levels, cell cycle effects and apoptosis.\nNOTE: The protocol is not restricted to irradiation experiments or any specific cell line. It has been tested with numerous cell lines of all types, from different species and for various treatment conditions.\nPrepare the following solutions including 10% excess volume.\nPrepare 2 mL per sample of fixation solution composed of 4.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Prepare the solution fresh. Dilute PFA in PBS by heating to 80 °C with slow stirring under the fume hood. Cover the flask with aluminum foil to prevent heat loss. Let the solution cool to room temperature and adjust the final volume. Pass the solution through a folded cellulose filter, grade 3hw (see the Table of Materials).\nCAUTION: PFA fumes are toxic. Perform this step under a fume hood and dispose PFA waste appropriately.\nPrepare 3 mL per sample of permeabilization solution composed of 70% ethanol in ice-cold H2O. Store at -20 °C.\nPrepare 7 mL per sample of washing solution composed of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS.\nPrepare 100 µL per sample of 3% BSA in PBS as antibody diluent.\nPrepare 100-250 µL per sample of DNA staining solution composed of 1 μg/mL 4',6-diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI) in PBS.",
    "Set the centrifuge for 15 mL tubes to 5 min at 200 x g and 7 °C. Let the centrifuge cool down and use these settings for all centrifugation steps.\n2. Sample Collection\nIf processing adherent cells (e.g., U87 glioblastoma cells grown in T25 flasks with 5 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere), continue with steps 2.1.1. and 2.1.2. For suspension cells proceed directly to step 2.1.2.\nCollect the medium in a centrifugation tube. Detach the cells using a routine cell culture method, which may include the use of trypsin, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or other cell detachment agents.\n\t\t\nFor U87 cells, prewarm PBS and trypsin/EDTA (see the Table of Materials) to 37 °C, wash the cell layer with 1 mL of PBS, incubate the cells for 1-2 min with 1 mL of trypsin/EDTA and support cell detachment by tapping at the flask. Collect all washing solution and the cell suspension in the tube with the medium.\nCentrifuge the cells, discard the medium and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of PBS.\nPipet the cells up and down several times to ensure a single cell suspension and transfer the cell suspension into a tube with 2 mL of fixation solution (4.5% PFA/PBS, 3% final concentration).\nCAUTION: PFA fumes are toxic. Perform this step under a fume hood and dispose PFA waste appropriately.\nIncubate the cells for 10 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the cells and discard the supernatant by decantation.\nLoosen the cell pellet by tapping onto the tube and resuspend the cells in 3 mL of 70% ethanol. Proceed directly with the next step or store the samples at 4 °C for up to several weeks.\n3. Washing and Staining",
    "Centrifuge the cells and discard the supernatant by decantation.\nLoosen the cell pellet by tapping onto the tube. Resuspend the cells in 3 mL of washing solution (0.5% BSA/PBS), centrifuge and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat the washing step 1x with 3 mL, and then 1x with 1 mL washing solution. In the last step, discard the supernatant carefully by pipetting. Take care not to aspirate the pellet.\nDilute the antibodies against γH2AX, phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) and caspase-3 (see the Table of Materials) in 100 µL/sample with antibody diluent (3% BSA/PBS).\nLoosen the cell pellet by tapping onto the tube and resuspend the cells in 100 µL of the antibody solution prepared in step 3.4. Keep the samples in the dark from this step onward.\nIncubate the samples for 1 h at room temperature.\nCentrifuge the cells and discard the supernatant carefully by pipetting. Take care not to aspirate the pellet.\nLoosen the cell pellet by tapping onto the tube and resuspend the cells in 100-250 µL of DNA staining solution (1 µg/mL DAPI/PBS).\nUse 100 µL if 1-2 x105 cells are present and increase the volume for higher cell numbers (250 µL for ≥1 x 106 cells). Proceed directly with the next step or store the samples in the dark at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nNOTE: For some cell types optimizing the DAPI concentration can help to improve the separation of the cell cycle phases.\nPipet the samples through the cell strainer cap of a sample tube with a mesh pore size of 35 µm.\n4. Measurement",
    "Place the samples on ice, start the flow cytometer (see the Table of Materials) configured with an optical setup according to Table 1 and press the Prime button. If required, switch on the ultraviolet laser (355 nm wavelength) separately and set the power to 20 mW using the appropriate software.\nOpen the acquisition software (see Table of Materials), log in and create a new experiment by clicking the New Experiment button on the Browser toolbar.\nUse the Inspector window to customize the name of the experiment and choose '5 Log Decades' for plot display.\nClick the New Specimen button in the Browser toolbar and expand the new entry by clicking the '+' symbol at its left side to show the first Tube. Select the respective icon and type to rename the Specimen (e.g., cell type) and the Tube (sample identifier). Click the Tube Pointer of the first Tube (arrow-like symbol at its left) to turn it green (active).\nOpen the Parameters tab in the Cytometer window and choose the parameters according to Table 1. Delete all unnecessary parameters.\nNOTE: the parameter names may vary depending on the custom presets (e.g., Cy3 instead of Alexa555). Make sure that the selection matches the optical filters and detectors in Table 1. The light paths of all fluorophores are fully independent in this setup and compensation of spectral overlap is not required; however, it might be necessary if another optical setup is used.\nOpen the Worksheet window and create plots according to Figure 1. Draw 2 dot plots and 4 histograms using the corresponding toolbar buttons and click the axis labels to choose the appropriate parameters (front scatter (FSC-A) versus side scatter (SSC-A), DAPI-W versus DAPI-A and a histogram for DAPI-A and each antibody-coupled fluorophore.",
    "Attach a control sample to the cytometer and press the Run button on the instrument. Select the first tube in the Browser window of the software and click the Acquire Data button in the Acquisition Dashboard. Adjust the sample injection volume using the Low, Mid or High buttons and the fine tuning wheel on the instrument. Preferably work at Low setting, but try to acquire at least 100 events/second (see Acquisition Dashboard).\nAdjust the detector voltages for FSC, SSC and DAPI in the Parameters tab of the Inspector window using the dot plots in Figure 1 as a guideline. Switch to logarithmic scale for the FSC and SSC parameters if the cell population appears too dispersed on a linear scale.\nPress the Standby button on the cytometer and continue with the worksheet setup in the software.\nUse the Polygon Gate tool to define the Cells population in the FSC-A versus SSC-A plot and the Rectangle Gate tool to define the SingleCells population in the DAPI-W versus DAPI-A plot. Press Ctrl + G keys to show the Population Hierarchy and click on the default gate names to rename them.\nSubsequently right-click on all histograms and choose Show Populations | SingleCells from the context menu.\nOptimize the detector voltages for the antibody-coupled fluorophores to cover the full dynamic range by subsequently acquiring control and treated samples. Maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and avoid detector saturation. Make sure that the Alexa488 peak in the SingleCells population is neither truncated in the control nor the treated sample.\nPress the Standby button on the cytometer and optionally perform steps 4.11.1-4.11.3 in the Worksheet window of the software to get a rough estimate of treatment effects during sample acquisition.",
    "Select SingleCells in the Population Hierarchy and use the Rectangle Gate tool to define the G1 population in the DAPI-W versus DAPI-A plot. Right-click at the Alexa488 histogram and choose Show Populations | G1 from the context menu.\nRight-click at the Alexa488 histogram and choose Create Statistics View from the context menu. Right-click at the Statistics View and choose Edit Statistics View. Go to the Statistics tab and activate the checkbox for the median of the Alexa488 signal in the G1 population (deactivate all other options).\nSelect SingleCells in the Population Hierarchy and use the Interval Gate tool to define the subG1, M and Casp3+ populations in the DAPI-A, Alexa555-A (Cy3-A in Figure 1) and Alexa647-A histograms.\nPress the Run button on the cytometer and measure the samples using the Acquisition Dashboard in the software. Set the stopping gate to All events or the Cells gate (if numerous small particles are present) and the number of events to record to 10,000.\nClick Next Tube to create a new sample, rename it in the Browser window, click Acquire Data to start the acquisition and Record Data to start recording.\nSelect File | Export | FCS files from the menu bar to export the data. Optionally select File | Export | Experiments to save the experiment as an additional zip file to enable reimporting the experiment at a later time point.\nNOTE: The setup of existing experiments can be easily reused with Edit | Duplicate without data.\n5. Data Evaluation\nDrag and drop the '.fcs' files into the sample browser of the flow cytometric analysis software (see Table of Materials). Apply the gating strategy shown in Figure 2. Make sure that the gates fit to the corresponding population in all of the samples before proceeding with the next daughter gate.",
    "To apply changes to all samples, select the changed gate in the sample browser, copy it by pressing Ctrl + C, select the parent gate, press Ctrl + Shift + E to select the equivalent nodes in all samples and press Ctrl + V to paste or overwrite the gate. Do not use group gates.\nDouble-click on the first sample in the browser to open the SSC-A vs. FSC-A plot. Use the Polygon tool in the toolbar to define the Cells population (Figure 2, plot 1), excluding debris from the analysis. Make sure that the gate is wide enough towards the upper right corner to accommodate treatment-related shifts, but restrict the border facing to the lower left corner of the plot to reliably exclude the cell.\nDouble-click on the Cells gate to open a new plot window and change the axes to DAPI-W (vertical) vs. DAPI-A (horizontal) by clicking on the axis labels. Use the Rectangle tool to define the SingleCells population (Figure 2, plot 2), excluding cell doublets or clumps from the analysis (doublets of G1 cells have the same DAPI-A intensity as G2 and M cells, but a considerably higher DAPI-W value).\nNOTE: Varying cell counts in different samples will cause shifts in the overall DAPI-A signal strength due to equilibrium binding of DAPI to DNA. This will not affect the cell cycle analysis, but it may be necessary to adjust the right border of the single cell gate sample by sample to account for these shifts.",
    "Double-click on the SingleCells gate to open a new plot window and change the axes to show the DAPI-A histogram. Use the Bisector tool to distinguish single cells with normal DNA content (CellCycle population) from apoptotic cells with degraded DNA (subG1 population). Subsequently select the new gates in the browser and press Ctrl + R to rename them accordingly (Figure 2, plot 3).\nSelect the CellCycle gate in the browser and choose Tool | Biology | Cell Cycle... from the menu bar to open the cell cycle modelling tool. Choose Dean-Jett-Fox25,26 in the Model section to estimate the frequency of cells in G1, S and G2/M phase (Figure 2, plot 4). Use constraints only in case of poor modelling performance (minimize the Root Mean Square deviation between model and data).\nCreate gates for G1 (Ellipse tool), S (Polygon tool) and G2 + M (Ellipse tool) phase in the DAPI-W vs. DAPI-A plot of the CellCycle population to enable cell cycle-specific γH2AX measurement (Figure 2, plot 5). Do not use the modelling tool for automatic cell cycle gating based on the DAPI-A histogram, as this can be inaccurate.\nNOTE: It may be necessary to move the gates along the DAPI-A axis sample by sample to account for the aforementioned shifts in overall DAPI signal strength. Only move the three gates as a group and do not change the shape of individual gates to avoid bias.\nUse the Bisector tool to distinguish phospho-histone H3-positive (M) and -negative (M-) cells in the Alexa555-A histogram of the CellCycle population (Figure 2, plot 6). Hold Ctrl and select the gates G2 + M and M-. Press Ctrl + Shift + A to create the G2 (G2+M & M-) gate.",
    "Use the Bisector tool to distinguish caspase-3-positive (Casp3+) and -negative (Casp3-) cells in the Alexa647-A histogram of the SingleCells population (Figure 2, plot 7). Set the threshold such that the average of the Casp3+ population in the untreated controls amounts to ~0.8% to assure high sensitivity and minimize assay-to-assay variations.\nPress Ctrl + T to open the Table Editor and configure it according to Figure 3. Drag and drop the different populations from the sample browser into the Table Editor and double-click on the rows to change the statistic, parameter and name settings. Remove the unnecessary rows that are automatically added after the drag and drop of the cell cycle modelling icon by selecting the rows and pressing Del.\nChoose To File, the format and destination in the Output section of the menu ribbon and click Create Table to export the data as '.xlsx' file.\nUse table calculation software (see Table of Materials) for further data analysis according to Supplementary File 1 (FACS_Analysis_Template_(1).xlsx).\nCorrect the frequencies of cells in the different cell cycle phases such that their sum amounts to 100% by applying the formula X' = X * 100 / Σ(all cell cycle phases), with X': corrected value, X: raw value, to each cell cycle phase.\nNOTE: Deviations from a sum of 100% occur due to inaccuracies in the cell cycle modelling, but are usually small (<5%).\nNormalize the median γH2AX intensities to the DNA content in the different cell cycle phases by dividing the values in S phase by 1.5 and in G2 and M phase by 2.0.",
    "To calculate the combined normalized γH2AX level in the whole cell population, use the formula IA = IG1 * G1 + IS * S + IG2 * G2 + IM * M, where IA, IG1, IS, IG2, IM are normalized median γH2AX intensities of all, G1, S, G2, M cells respectively and G1, S, G2, M are corrected frequency of cells in the respective cell cycle phase.\nFor the normalized γH2AX levels and the frequency of subG1 and caspase-3-positive cells, subtract the average value of the untreated controls from each sample.\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of each parameter from all replicate samples and plot the results into diagrams.\nSubscription Required.
