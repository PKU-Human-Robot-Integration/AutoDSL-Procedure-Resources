Extraction from surgically resected tissues\n(A) Patient-derived materials were obtained from stomach resections.\n(B) CAFs extracted from gastric cancer tissues (white dotted line) and paired NFs extracted from noncancerous tissues. Scale bar, 5 cm.\n(C) Schema of the layer structure of the stomach.\nNote: The collection of human material must conform to all relevant institutional/governmental regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to collecting the primary human tissue materials.\nPatient-derived material was obtained from stomach resections (total gastrectomy or distal gastrectomy) of primary cancers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCAFs were extracted from gastric cancer tissues and paired NFs were extracted from noncancerous tissues using a scalpel. NFs should be collected at least 5 cm away from cancer. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B)\nNote: In this protocol, a trained surgeon should be involved in the separation of gastric cancer (GC) and adjacent normal tissue as soon as possible after surgery. CAFs are isolated from advanced GC. Thus, the borderline between cancer and normal tissue is obvious. However, the borderline of type 4 GC would not be clear. In such a case, the tissue stiffness using palpable sensation is useful for determining the borderline.\nNote: Extraction included the submucosa. All layers are not needed for extraction.\nThe dissected tissues were prepped by washing at least 3 times using wash buffer.\nNote: Wash tissues using only gentle inversion.\nThe tissues were transferred to culture medium and placed on ice.\nDissociation of tissues for the generation of a single-cell suspension\nTiming: 3 h (plus 3 weeks for culture expansion)",
    "This step describes how to dissociate fibroblasts from collected tissues. The procedure follows the instrument manufacturer’s protocols with a few modifications.\nTumor Dissociation Kit: https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-n/products/tumor-dissociation-kit-human.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-n/products/tumor-dissociation-kit-human.html#gref]\nPrepare the enzyme mix by gently adding 4.7 mL of RPMI 1640, 200 μL of Enzyme H, 100 μL of Enzyme R, and 25 μL of Enzyme A into a gentleMACS C tube.\nUsing scalpels, mince each material into small pieces that are approximately 2–4 mm in size (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/683-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

For a visual guide, refer to Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] (Running the gentleMACS program).\nAfter termination of the program, detach the gentleMACS C Tube from gentleMACS Dissociator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nIncubate each sample for 30 min at 37°C under continuous rotation using the MACSmix Tube Rotator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nAttach the gentleMACS C Tube upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Dissociator.\nRun the gentleMACS program h_tumor_02.\nAfter termination of the program, detach the gentleMACS C Tube from the gentleMACS Dissociator.\nIncubate each sample for 30 min at 37°C under continuous rotation using the MACSmix Tube Rotator.\nAttach the gentleMACS C Tube upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Dissociator.\nRun the gentleMACS program h_tumor_03.",
    "Note: The duration of the gentleMACS program is approximately 40 sec.

PDF\nPerform a short centrifugation at 300×g for 30 sec at room temperature (22°C–25°C) to collect the sample materials at the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend the sample in the culture media and apply the cell suspension to a MACS SmartStrainer (70 μm) placed on a 50 mL tube.\nAlternatives: Any 70 μm strainer could be used.\nWash the MACS SmartStrainer (70 μm) with 20 mL of RPMI 1640 to collect any remaining cells lodged in the cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300×g at 4°C for 7 min. Aspirate the supernatant completely.\nCulture the cells in a 10 cm collagen-coated dish in 10 mL of culture media in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nExpand the cells until they reach a confluency of 90% in a 15 cm dish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/683-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Observation of the primary CAFs at days 2, 4 and 7\nScale bar, 500 μm.\nNote: The morphologies of primary NFs and CAFs are similar. A total of 3×106 cells are collected from a confluency of 90% in a 15 cm dish.\nStore the cells in five tubes with 500 μL of Bambanker (Cat# CS-02-001), with approximately 6×105 cells in each tube.\nNote: CD90 expression by flow cytometry is useful for validating the enrichment of primary fibroblasts before storing the cells. However, the purity of CD90-positive cells following this protocol ranges from 97% to 100% according to previous reports (Izumi et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), (Kisselbach et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Therefore, the validation of CD90 by FACS staining is not essential.\nPause Point: Sample can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months at this point or processed as described below.",

Incubate at 37°C for 3 min.\nLightly tap the plate to lift the cells. If the cells are not all detached, incubate the plate at 37°C in increments of 2 min until all cells detach.\nNote: Total time in Accutase should not exceed 7 min. Accutase is a gentler alternative to trypsin and is used for primary fibroblast cells to decrease cell damage and increase cell viability.\nDilute Accutase 1:5 using the culture medium. Collect the cells into a 15 mL tube.\nSpin down at 210×g for 3 min and culture primary fibroblasts in 10 mL of culture medium in a 10 cm plate.\nNote: For the induction of senescence, the cells should be 20%–30% confluent after two times of these steps (27–31).\nTiming: 10 min\nChange the culture medium to 3 cytokines containing medium for 24 h.",
    "After 24 h, change the medium to culture medium without cytokines.\nTiming: 3–7 days\nCulture the fibroblasts for 3–7 days without passaging.\nNote: To validate senescence, check the changes in the morphology (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) and perform the following assays: senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assay (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), western blot analysis with p16INK4a, p15INK4b and Lamin B1, growth assay over a long period, and immunofluorescence staining with γH2A histone family member X (γH2AX) and phosphorylation of the consensus target sequences (pST/Q) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/683-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale bar, 50 μm.\nFor the SA-β-gal assay, we recommend using the Senescence Detection Kit (BioVision: K320) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. https://www.biovision.com/documentation/datasheets/K320.pdf[href=https://www.biovision.com/documentation/datasheets/K320.pdf]\nFor western blot analysis with p16INK4a, p15INK4b and Lamin B1, we suggest using Cell Signaling Technology’s standard protocol, which is available at https://en.cellsignal.jp/learn-and-support/protocols/protocol-western[href=https://en.cellsignal.jp/learn-and-support/protocols/protocol-western], and using the primary antibodies p16INK4a (Abcam: ab108349, 1:5000 dilution), p15INK4b (Santa Cruz: sc271791, 1:1000 dilution), Lamin B1 (Abcam: ab16048, 1:1000 dilution) and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology: 4967, 1:1000 dilution) and the secondary antibodies anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling Technology: 7074, 1:5000 dilution) and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz: sc2005, 1:5000 dilution). Dilution buffer is Can Get Signal® Immunoreaction Enhancer Solution 1, 2 (TOYOBO); 1 for primary antibodies and 2 for secondary antibodies.\nFor the growth assay over a long period, we recommend waiting at least 10 days until the growth curve reaches a plateau. We suggest using the Incucyte S3 Live-cell rpmseeded onto 96-well plates and stained with NucLight Rapid Red (Essen BioScience: 4717).",
    "For immunofluorescence staining for γH2AX and pST/Q, we suggest using Cell Signaling Technology’s standard protocol, which is available at https://www.cellsignal.com/learn-and-support/protocols/protocol-if[href=https://www.cellsignal.com/learn-and-support/protocols/protocol-if], and the primary antibodies γH2AX (Millipore: 05-636, 1:1000 dilution) and pST/Q (Cell Signaling Technology: 2851, 1:400 dilution) and the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes: A11008, 1:200 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes: A11005, 1:200 dilution with the DAPI solution (Dojindo: 340-07971) and 1:1000 for nuclear staining).
