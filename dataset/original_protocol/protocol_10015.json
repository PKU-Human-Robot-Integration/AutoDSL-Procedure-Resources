For 1 L of LB medium, add 25 g of LB powder to 1 L of ultrapure water.\nPrepare a starter culture with 100 mL of LB medium, 50 µL of sterile-filtered (0.22 µm filter) chloramphenicol solution (25 mg/mL in EtOH), and 50 µL of sterile-filtered (0.22 µm filter) carbenicillin solution (100 mg/mL in 50% EtOH and 50% ultrapure water).\nAdd a small streak from a pre-made bacterial stock containing E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS with the pET20b(+) expression vector encoding the polypeptide sequence MGHGVGVP((GEGVP)4(GVGVP))4((GFGVP)4(GVGVP))3(GFGVP)4GWP (abbreviated as EF) to a pre-warmed 100 mL starter culture and incubate at 37 °C for 16 h with 250 rpm in a shaking incubator (E. coli strains and vectors are available upon request).\nPre-warm the expression culture flasks and the LB media at 37 °C overnight so that they are prepared for the next day.\nDay 2: Protein expression\nAdd 750 mL of LB medium to each expression culture flask, 375 µL of sterile-filtered (0.22 µm filter) chloramphenicol stock (25 mg/mL in EtOH), and 375 µL of sterile-filtered (0.22 µm filter) carbenicillin stock (100 mg/mL in 50% EtOH and 50% ultrapure water).\nAfter agitation to distribute the antibiotics, take 2 mL of the media as a reference sample for the optical density measurement at 600 nm (OD600).\nAdd 7.5 mL of the starting culture to the expression flask and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C with 250 rpm.\nAfter this step the OD600 of each flask will be checked every 20 min.",

To adjust the pH, phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide are used. pH stripes are sufficient to determine the pH level.\nTo improve the yield of the purification the sample, heat the sample to 60 °C and add sodium chloride up to 2 M.\nSubsequently, centrifuge the sample at 16,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\nDiscard the supernatant and re-dissolve the pellet in PBS (but only half of the initial volume is used compared to the previous step).\nAdjust the pH to 7 with phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide. pH stripes are sufficiently accurate to determine the pH.\nCentrifuge the sample subsequently at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant and repeat steps 1.4.1–1.4.6 up to 3x total, except that in the last repetition of step 1.4.4, only water is added instead of PBS.\nMeasure the concentration of the peptides with an absorption spectrometer. Use an extinction coefficient of 5500/M/cm at 280 nm.\nAdjust the concentration of the ELP to 700 µM.\n2. Vesicle Production Using the Glass Beads Method\nConcentrate the ELP solution to 1.1 mM using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator.\nMix 200 µL of the concentrated ELP solution with 1,250 µL of a 2:1 chloroform/methanol mixture followed by vortexing.\nAdd 1.5 g of spherical glass beads (212–300 µm in size) to a 10 mL round bottom flask.",

To avoid loss of the glass beads, loosely attached aluminum foil should be wrapped around the round bottom flask opening.\nFor a single experiment, mix 100 mg of the peptide covered glass beads with 60 µL of the swelling solution, such as PBS. Incubate this sample at 25 °C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the sample quickly with a table-top centrifuge to sediment the glass beads.\nUse a pipette to collect the supernatant which contains the vesicles.\n3.
