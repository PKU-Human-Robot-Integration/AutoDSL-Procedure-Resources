We advise on protein tag usage and on experiments to test affinity tag construct functionality.\nDesign transgenic constructs to express tagged POI and tagged control for affinity purification:\nDesign a genetic construct for tagged POI expression in C. elegans according to the type of affinity purification that will be executed, biochemical properties of the POI, and potential follow-up experiments.\nNote: See Part VIII, step 29 for examples.\nNote: As a negative control, we used an affinity-tagged GFP (GS::GFP) C. elegans strain.\nTest all genetic constructs with phenotypic assays to ensure that the tagged-POI is functional (see step 3).\nCommon parameters to test include tag identity, tag size, tag location (e.g., N-/C-terminus or internal), linker sequence(s), promoter sequence, and genomic DNA versus cDNA for the POI.\nOur prior studies1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] used a 2× protein G - 5× streptavidin binding peptide tag (GS) separated by a TEV protease cleavage site (Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Mmc1.extension]). We anticipate our protocol would work well for other single-step affinity purification tags such as GFP, FLAG or HA. However, we note that optimization of affinity purification conditions should be performed for all tags. While the GS tag we used was originally designed for tandem purification,23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] we do not recommend tandem affinity purification. In our hands, this takes more optimization, results in lower amounts of POI, and extended time frames/steps for tandem purification reduce intact protein complexes.\nGenerate transgenic worms expressing extrachromosomal arrays (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for example):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Designing strains and constructs for ubiquitin ligase substrate enrichment",
    "(A) Example of three transgenic strains required for AP-proteomics experiments with ubiquitin ligase as POI. Note RPM-1 RING family ubiquitin ligase is used as example.\n(B) Schematic depicting RPM-1 which functions in a multi-component E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to target substrates for ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (upper diagram). RPM-1 LD construct generated by mutating three catalytic residues (C3535A, H3537A, H3540A). Substrates are biochemically ‘trapped’ by RPM-1 LD/FSN-1/SKR-1 ubiquitin ligase complex which enriches substrate interactions (lower diagram).\nOnce transgene designs are ready, clone expression constructs containing the native gene promoter, gene (cDNA or ORF), and native 3′ UTR.\nNote: Native promoters and integrated transgenes ensure physiologically relevant expression while still reaping benefits of more POI and associated complexes from mild overexpression. Negative control tags should also be driven by the native promoter for the POI.\nMicroinject POI protein null mutants (P0) with plasmids containing transgene and co-injection markers (see Part VIII, step 30 for example).\nNote: The use of POI protein null mutant is critical to ensure no competition with endogenous POI, and to promote formation of protein complexes with tagged POI. We generally start with 20ng/mL of plasmid for injection, but this amount might need to be optimized for function based on rescue (see step 3).\nSelect transgenic strains with 40%–60% transmission of the co-injection marker (percentage of total worms on a plate carrying the marker).\nNote: This moderate transmission frequency facilitates isolation of integrated transgenic strains at later steps.\nTest for functionality of affinity-tagged POI:\nTest strains isolated in step 2.c for expression and function of the affinity tagged POI using phenotypic rescue experiments (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A for example).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Evaluation of GS::RPM-1 function using transgenic rescue",
    "(A) rpm-1 mutants display high frequency axon termination defects. Defects are not altered by pha-1 ts mutant which is used as transgenic selection cassette. GS::RPM-1 with MCS linker is fully functional and robustly rescues rpm-1 (lf) defects. In contrast, GS::RPM-1 with Gateway linker and RPM-1 with C-terminal tag (RPM-1::GS) do not rescue efficiently. Untagged RPM-1 is positive control for rescue.\n(B) Evaluation of integrated transgenes showing GS::RPM-1 (MCS linker) is functional while GS::RPM-1 LD is not. GS::GFP is included as negative control for GS affinity tag. Histograms represent means, dots represent average for single count (35–40 worms/count), error bars are SEM. Significance was tested using Student’s t-test with Bonferroni correction. ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗p < 0.01 and ns = not significant.\nIf strains carrying extrachromosomal arrays do not successfully rescue the null phenotype, return to step 2.b and adjust injection concentrations higher or lower. Alternatively, return to step 1.a and alter the location of the tag on the POI, and/or test different linkers.\nBiochemically test the transgenic strains isolated in step 2.c for affinity tagged-POI. For detailed methodologies, see procedures below (Part III and IV) for affinity purification and western blotting which can also be used for biochemical evaluation of transgenic lines.\nTransgenic extrachromosomal arrays that display the best phenotypic rescue and have biochemically validated expression of tagged-POI should be integrated into the genome (see below in step 4).\nIntegrate transgenic arrays to create stable transgenic lines:\nPlace 200 late L4 (larval stage 4) extrachromosomal array-carrying worms in 200 μL of M9.\nMix 20 μL of 1 mg/mL TMP (dissolved in DMSO (store −20°C for 1 month)) in 380 μL of M9 and add the solution to the tube with worms.\nIncubate at 20°C–23°C for 15 min on a rotator with gentle mixing.",
    "In the dark, transfer TMP treated worms to an unseeded 10 cm NGM plate. With the lid off, expose worms to 350 μJ (X100)/cm3 UV using Spectroline UV crosslinker.\nAfter UV exposure, add concentrated OP50 (see Materials) and let worms recover at 15°C.\nThe next day, pick 10 healthy looking young adult transgenics (P0s) to 10 plates each (total of 100 P0s).\nIn the next generation, pick 25 F1 plates from each of the P0 plates.\nIn the next generation, pick 3–5 F2s to individual plates from each F1 plate.\nScreen F2s for 100% transmission indicating that the transgenic array is integrated into the genome. Outcross transgenic integrants at least 4×.\nCross integrated transgene onto POI null mutant (preferably protein null). Secondary check for rescue (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B for example) and confirm affinity tagged POI expression by immunoprecipitation and western blot.\nNote: Usually 1–2 integrants will be isolated. For more integrants, increase the number of P0, F1, and F2 worms picked. Other integration techniques can potentially be used, such as irradiation or bombardment.\nLarge-scale liquid culture (part II)\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThe following protocol will describe how to harvest 2 × 250 mL liquid cultures of C. elegans. The protocol can be scaled up or down based on how much POI is present.\nPrepare worms for culture:\nDay 1 plates: On one 10 cm plate containing OP50, transfer enough young adult worms to have a fully starved plate (L1 synchronization) after 72–80 h at 23°C. Several generations of worms will grow on the plate before starvation and L1 synchronization happens.\nNote: For wild-type N2, ∼13–15 young adult worms per plate.\nDay 2 plates: the next day, in four 10 cm plates, transfer enough worms for crowded but not starved plate after 72 h at 23°C.",
    "Note: For N2 worms, ∼8–10 worms per plate.\nSet up the liquid culture:\nBegin when Day 1 plates are fully starved. Starvation occurs 72–80 h after setup when OP50 bacterial lawn is gone, worms are at the L1 stage, and no dauers are present.\nNote: Presence of dauers on plates must be avoided as they will induce further dauer formation during liquid culture.\nPrepare 500 mL of S Complete media (use same day, do not store) using sterile procedures.\nAdd 225 mL of S Complete to each of the 2 × 2 L flasks.\nAdd 5 mL of prepared liquid HB101 culture (See Materials) to each flask.\nNote: To perform many experiments with different strains, large quantities of HB101 will be needed. While this can be grown in house, our group usually grows HB101 using a fermenter service (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] section).\nTransfer worms from Day 1 plate into 15 mL conical tube. Pour M9 onto the plate, swirl and remove liquid using a glass pipette and add to the conical tube. Wash 3 times: for each wash add 10 mL of M9, spin worms down (350 × g, 1 min 30 s), aspirate supernatant and repeat. After the final wash, resuspend in 6 mL of M9.\nDivide resuspended worms equally (3 mL) into 2 Erlenmeyer flasks prepared above (steps 6.b and 6.c).\nPlace flasks on orbital shaker and set at 185 RPM (calculated for a 2inch orbit shaker) at 20°C–23°C .\nThe next day (16–24 h), harvest Day 2 plates by washing with M9 as describe above at step 6d. Divide the resuspended worms equally between the flasks set up at step 6e, and feed by adding 7.5 mL of HB101 to each flask.",
    "On the 3rd day of culture add 10 mL of liquid HB101 culture to each of the flasks to provide more food for the worms.\nAfter 24 h (day 4 of culture), check health and density of worms:\nPipet 1 mL of liquid culture onto an unseeded NGM plate.\nLet the liquid evaporate and observe the worms’ health and density.\nNote: Some HB101 bacteria should still be present showing that the worms still have enough food to eat and worms should have visible gut granules indicating good health.\nNote: With successful liquid culture, you will see all developmental stages and very few dauers or pre-dauer L2d. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section if there are large numbers of dauers.\nHarvest liquid cultures:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "While tubes are on ice, prepare 250 mL 0.1 M NaCl (keep on ice) and aliquot 10 mL into 4 × 15 mL conical tubes on ice.\nSpin worms down (750 × g, 4 min, 20°C–23°C).\nAspirate off supernatant with a vacuum leaving 5 mL of liquid on top of the worm pellet. Be careful not to dislodge the pellet.\nConsolidate the worms into two 50 mL conical tubes. Adjust volume to 50 mL with 0.1 M NaCl and mix by inverting.\nSpin down (750 × g, 4 min) and aspirate supernatant leaving 10 mL of liquid on top of the worm pellet.\nResuspend worm pellet and transfer into 4 × 15 mL tubes. Adjust volume to 6 mL of worms per tube using 0.1 M NaCl.\nCritical: The next 6 steps should be done as quickly as possible (less than 5 min), as worms will not survive in sucrose for long.\nAdd 6 mL of ice-cold sterile 60% sucrose to each tube of worms. The final concentration of sucrose in the tube will be 30%.\nMix tubes well by inverting several times.\nNote: if the solution is not completely mixed, the sucrose floatation may fail.\nWith a 5 mL glass pipet, carefully overlay the suspension with 2 mL of 0.1 M NaCl.\nNote: NaCl layer should be visibly distinct from the sucrose layer. Worms will float to the top of sucrose while bacteria and debris remain in the sucrose solution and pellet.\nSpin the tubes (1,450 × g, 2 min 30 s) with no or minimal deceleration (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nUsing a glass pipette, carefully collect worms in NaCl (less than 5 mL) and bring as little of the sucrose layer as possible. Deposit worms into 15 mL tubes containing 10 mL of NaCl (prepared in step 7.c).",
    "Mix the tubes well by inverting several times.\nSpin the tubes (350 × g, 1 min 30 s) and aspirate supernatant.\nWash the tubes 2× to remove sucrose: add 15 mL 0.1 M NaCl to tubes, spin down (350 × g, 1 min 30 s) and aspirate the supernatant.\nAfter the final wash, aspirate supernatant leaving a small (<200 μL) amount of liquid over the worm pellet for resuspension.\nPrechill ceramic mortar with liquid N2 and fill to 75% full.\nWith a pipette pump and Pasteur pipette, resuspend worms. The solution will be very thick; add slightly more 0.1 M NaCl if you have trouble pipetting.\nTransfer a small drop of clean animals to an unseeded NGM plate to determine sample quality.\nNote: The prep should not contain dauers or bacteria and the worms should be healthy and contain a mixture of developmental stages (L1-adult).\nNote: worms grown in liquid culture will look longer and thinner than when grown on plates.\nPipet resuspended worms dropwise into liquid N2 and flash freeze into small beads. Repeat for each tube of worms.\nCarefully pour frozen worm beads into a 50 mL conical tube (prechilled with liquid N2). When liquid N2 has fully evaporated, measure the mass of beads.\nNote: Typical yield per 250 mL culture is 2–3g.\nStore frozen worms at −80°C.\nPause point: Frozen pellets can be stored up to 2 months.\nPreparing whole worm grindates using a cryomill (part III)\nTiming: 1–2 h\nOur published studies in C. elegans1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and previous AP-proteomics studies using yeast24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24] indicate that liquid nitrogen flash freezing and cyromilling is key for enhancing protein complex isolation and AP-proteomics outcomes. Here, we provide instruction on how to use a cryomill with C. elegans.",
    "Critical: Prechill all conical tubes on dry ice and metal spatulas in liquid N2. All tubes must be kept on dry ice at all times.\nMeasure 5 g of worm pellets per strain into prechilled 50 mL conical tubes and keep on dry ice.\nAdd ½ of a Roche cOmplete mini protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA free tablet to each tube.\nAssemble the cryomill, the grinding jar, and the grinding ball according to manufacturer’s instructions. Run pre-cool setting for 5 min to cool jars with liquid N2.\nNote: Use 50 mL jars to grind because smaller jars make it more difficult to completely remove ground worms.\nPour contents of conical tube (from steps 8 and 9) into the grinding jar with grinding ball and load onto the cryomill.\nFor 5 g of worms, pre-cool the jar for 2 min at 5 Hz (s-1) then grind for 5 min at 30 Hz (s-1).\nWhen worms are ground, pour liquid N2 into the prechilled mortar and add the ground worms. Use the prechilled metal spatula to remove any grindate stuck to the jar wall and grinding ball.\nPour ground worms and liquid N2 mix into the prechilled conical tube. Let the liquid N2 evaporate and return the tube to dry ice.\nRepeat steps 10–14 for each C. elegans strain.\nNote: Grind strains in the appropriate order (i.e., control first) to limit cross-contamination if reusing the grinding jar.\nStore conical tubes with C. elegans grindates at −80°C or proceed immediately to the next step.\nPause point: Frozen grindates can be stored for 2–3 days at −80°C. Long-term storage is not recommended.\nAffinity purification of POI protein complexes from whole worm lysates (part IV)\nTiming: 2–3 days",
    "The following protocol will outline the steps for affinity purification of proteins using 80 mg of total protein starting material as determined by a BCA assay. The amount of C. elegans lysate used will vary depending on POI expression levels. For mass spectrometry, you will need 0.4–1 μg of purified POI.\nCritical: To reduce keratin and other common contaminants, clean work surfaces fresh for each experiment with 70% isopropanol and use gloves, surgical mask, hair net and lab coat while handling samples. Only use single use, sterile plastics. High speed centrifuge tubes, cryomill grinding jars and cryomill grinding balls should be washed with detergent (Contrad 70, Decon Labs 1002) and wiped dry with filtered 70% isopropanol using low particulate cleanroom pads (Contec AMEC0001).\nPerform affinity purification on the protein of interest.\nNote: Perform the following steps at 20°C–23°C.\nCritical: Steps a to c need to be performed quickly (less than 1 min).\nRemove tube with C. elegans grindates stored at −80°C, and quickly dislodge aggregates by tapping the tube on a bench top or using a sterile spatula.\nImmediately add room temperature (20°C–23°C) lysis buffer to ground worms in 1:4 w/v ratio (e.g., resuspend 5 g worms in 20 mL lysis buffer). Keeping lysis buffer at 20°C–23°C helps dissolve the grindates.\nUse a sterile, plastic spatula to mix worm lysate (mix less than 1 min).\nMix on rotator for 5 min at 4°C.\nCritical: Perform the following steps at 4°C or on ice. All tubes must be prechilled on ice.\nTransfer lysates to a prechilled centrifuge tube.\nSpin (20,000 × g) for 10–15 min at 4°C.\nPipet supernatant into prechilled 50 mL conical tube.\nCritical: Do not freeze lysate after this step. Keep on ice.",
    "Perform BCA assay following manufacturer’s instructions to assess total protein concentration in lysate. Calculate amount of lysate needed for 80 mg total protein. Typical yield from 5 g grindate in 20 mL lysis buffer is a concentration of 3–5 mg/mL of total protein.\nNote: the amount of lysate required for a successful proteomics experiment should be optimized for your POI.\nPrepare 2 × 250 μL of Dynabeads (10 mg/mL stock) in 2 × 15 mL tubes by washing with cold lysis buffer 3 times. Collect beads with a DynaMag-15 magnet and discard the supernatant using a serological pipet after each wash.\nTransfer volume of lysate equivalent to 40 mg of total protein (about 10 mL) to each 15 mL conical tube of Dynabeads for a total of 80 mg total protein.\nIncubate with rotation at 4°C for 1–4 h. The antibody-POI complexes will bind to the affinity resin present on the Dynabeads. For example with a GS tagged POI, IgG is coupled to Dynabeads.\nNote: Length of incubation time should be optimized based on amount of POI in a set amount of lysate. We found shorter incubation times are better because they minimize degradation of POI and protein complexes. This is supported by previous studies in yeast that demonstrated short incubations times are key for enriching intact protein complexes.25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]\nUse the DynaMag-15 magnet to collect Dynabeads for 2 min. Invert the tube twice while on the magnet to collect any Dynabeads in the tube cap.\nWash Dynabeads:\nAdd 8 mL of cold lysis buffer to the tube, remove the magnet, invert several times.\nCollect beads with a DynaMag-15 magnet and discard the supernatant using a serological pipet after each wash.\nRepeat washes 5 times.\nTransfer the beads to a 1.7 mL low retention tube.",
    "Note: Low retention tubes limit the amount of protein that sticks to the plastic of the tube and reduces false positive hits.\nAdd 500 μL of cold lysis buffer to the Dynabeads and gently resuspend.\nTransfer 50 μL (10%) of suspension to a new tube and collect the beads using DynaMag-2 and aspirate supernatant. Set samples aside and use it for quality control analysis (see step 18 below).\nCollect beads from the 450 μL (90%) resuspension using the DynaMag-2 and aspirate supernatant. Store beads at −80°C until ready to perform mass spectrometry (see Part V below).\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −80°C for up to 2 weeks.\nPerform quality control for affinity purification:\nPreparing diagnostic sample:\nUse quality control samples set aside at step 17.q.\nAdd 25 μL of 1× LDS sample buffer directly to Dynabeads.\nHeat samples at 70°C for 10 min. Agitate tubes by flicking halfway through incubation to mix beads.\nCollect the beads with a DynaMag-2 magnet to separate them from the supernatant which will be used for silver staining (steps 18.e–18.j) and western blotting (steps 18.k–18.r).\nSilver stain: used for quality control only to determine sample purity and POI quantity (for example see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Add the appropriate buffer according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\nHigher molecular weight POI (150 kDa or larger) use 3–8% Tris-acetate gel.\nLower molecular weight POI (under 150 kDa) use 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel.\nLoad 90% of the diagnostic sample (equivalent to 9% of total from step 17.p) into NuPAGE gel.\nAlongside samples, load protein molecular weight standards (Cytiva) for analysis of protein size and quantity in samples. At least 3 concentrations of standard should be run to accurately determine amount of POI.\nNote: Protein molecular weight standards mass range and amount of standard loaded will depend on the size and amount of POI. Evaluate amount of POI using a similar size standard.\nRun NuPAGE gel (see manufacturer’s instructions).\nNote: For GS::RPM-1, we run the gel at 150 volts for 1 h and 30 min.\nTo perform a silver stain, use the Pierce silver stain kit (follow manufacturer’s instructions).\nDetermine the quality of affinity purification by comparing bands present in POI sample with the negative control sample.\nNote: The control should have relatively sparse labeling compared to test POI.",

For robust large-scale results, we recommend 4–8 proteomics experiments total with at least two independent experiments for a given extraction condition. Variable extraction using different lysis buffer conditions (e.g., varying detergent type and/or concentration) is highly recommended. In our studies we used 2 different detergents: NP-40 at two concentrations (0.1% and 0.3%) and CHAPS (0.1%). In our experience, protein complexes and binding proteins identified by proteomics can vary with extraction conditions (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and 6C). Empirical evaluation of different extraction buffer conditions for a given POI is recommended. Note that higher detergent concentrations are more stringent and could destabilize protein complexes.\nProcess MS/MS results using Scaffold Proteome Software to identify proteins associated with peptide MS/MS spectra.\nCreate spreadsheet for each experiment, strain and purification condition tested indicating the corresponding database protein database ID, protein name, protein size, percent coverage, total spectral count (peptide), exclusive spectral count, and unique spectral count (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "Each experiment is indicated in the first column and color code highlights varying detergent and buffer conditions. Later columns indicate: database ID, protein name, protein size, percent coverage, total spectral count (peptide), exclusive spectral count, and unique spectral count for samples (GS::GFP control, GS::RPM-1 and GS::RPM-1 LD). Shown are functionally validated RPM-1 binding proteins (FSN-1, SKR-1, GLO-4, RAE-1, PPM-2) and ubiquitination substrates (UNC-51, CDK-5).\nTotal spectral count indicates total number of times a given peptide was identified.\nExclusive spectral count indicates peptides that can be found only in one C. elegans protein.\nUnique spectral count indicates the number of specific peptide sequences found for each candidate protein.\nCandidate POI binding proteins are identified based on the following criteria:\nDetected in at least two experiments.\nPeptide identifications established at >5.0% probability to achieve a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1.0% by Scaffold Local FDR algorithm.\nProtein identifications are established at >98.0% probability to achieve an FDR <1.0% and contained at least two identified peptides. Assign protein probabilities using the Protein Prophet algorithm.\nCandidate shows 2× or greater enrichment of total spectra samples compared to negative control.\nCandidate is not commonly found in proteomics experiments. Examples of common proteins identified that are not usually functionally relevant binding proteins for a POI are ribosomal proteins and vitellogenin. These proteins are removed because they are generally found in C. elegans proteomic samples due to their roles in translation and post-embryonic development, respectively.\nCompare outcomes for a given candidate with different extraction conditions. For an example, see Part VIII, step 33 (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nCalculate normalized total spectral count for candidate protein based on size of candidate and numbers of peptides identified for POI by MS:\n(\n(\nC\na\nn\nd\ni\nd\na\nt\ne\nt\no\nt\na\nl\ns\np",

We use a p-value of p < 0.05 to limit false negatives. False positives are still possible but should be reduced by the criteria for protein identification above and by candidate validation (see Part VII below). Importantly, statistical significance can increase confidence in a putative binding protein, but lack of significance does not rule out the validity of a putative hit that meets criteria. This is particularly relevant when dealing with protein complexes where individual components are likely to show varying levels of identification by mass spectrometry.\nValidation of putative POI binding proteins identified by LC-MS/MS (part VII)\nTiming: 6–12 months but varies with number and type of validation experiments\nProteomics only reveals putative binding proteins for a POI. We consider it important to perform further experiments to confirm a proteomic candidate. Here we list the typical experiments we execute to validate a putative binding protein.\nValidate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with biochemistry:",
    "Note: Putative POI binding proteins can be validated biochemically using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) as well as other biochemical or optical approaches such as Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM)-FluoRescence Energy Transfer (FRET).\nDesign construct for tagged candidate protein using a distinct tag from POI.\nGenerate transgenic or CRISPR-engineered worms expressing tagged candidate protein.\nPerform co-IP (or other interaction assay) to verify physical interaction between candidate and POI.\nNote: The protocol for growing C. elegans, generating grindates and performing affinity purification (Part I-IV, above) is also used for co-IP to test PPIs. To do so, we use between 1 and 10 mg of total protein from whole worm extracts. We use 10–15 μL of protein G agarose beads (Roche) coupled to appropriate primary antibody to immunoprecipitate tagged POI protein complexes. Dynabeads were only needed for high-quality AP-proteomics.\nFor examples of successful in vivo biochemistry in C. elegans using coIP with both transgenic approaches or CRISPR-based native constructs see the following studies.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27] FLIM-FRET is an imaging approach that tests whether two proteins are in close molecular proximity at subcellular locations. For examples of using FLIM-FRET in C. elegans to evaluate PPIs we suggest the following studies.28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28],29[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]\nEvaluate genetic interactions between POI and proteomic candidates:\nNote: To explore the biological relevance of putative PPIs, we recommend genetic studies between a candidate and POI.\nEvaluate if the single mutant for candidate phenocopies the mutant for POI.\nGenerate and test a strain with null mutations in both candidate and POI to examine their genetic interactions.\nNote: We have found proteins in the same complex display both genetic enhancer effects and same pathway genetic outcomes. Genetic suppression has been observed when the POI inhibits a binding protein or enzymatic substrate. Phenotypic suppression is a common genetic relationship between ubiquitin ligase POIs and their substrates.",
    "Test for colocalization between POI and proteomic candidates:\nNote: Another criterion for biological relevance is localization of a candidate and the POI to the same cellular or subcellular compartment.\nEngineer different fluorescent tags onto the POI and candidate using either transgenics or CRISPR engineering.\nEvaluate colocalization with confocal microscopy or other high-resolution microscopy techniques.\nNote: Colocalization of a candidate with the POI in a subcellular compartment is consistent with the candidate being a POI binding protein.\nExample of experimental setup and analysis (part VIII)\nFor the example below, we provide extra details and data to fully illustrate the strategy and design underpinning our previous proteomic studies.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nDesign rpm-1 transgenic lines.\nNote: For RPM-1 proteomics, we utilized a GS affinity tag (Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Mmc1.extension]) which was previously used for tandem affinity purification (TAP) proteomics in mammalian cells.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] In our hands with the C. elegans model, rapid single-step affinity purification is superior to TAP because it yields more POI, less deterioration of PPIs and requires no optimization for TEV protease cleavage. The importance of rapid purification for AP-proteomics has also been supported by prior studies using yeast.25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25] We tested two linker sequences (Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Mmc1.extension]) between GS and RPM-1 and observed differing effects on RPM-1/POI function (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: We used a native rpm-1 promoter to drive GS::RPM-1 expression exclusively in the nervous system. GS::RPM-1 was expressed using genomic DNA (including native promoter and 3′UTR) on an rpm-1 protein null mutant background (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],30[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30] Thus, we ensured physiologically relevant GS::RPM-1 expression, and prevented competition for binding proteins with endogenous RPM-1.",
    "Note: In order to distinguish substrates from non-substrate binding proteins, we introduced point mutations to create GS::RPM-1 ligase dead (LD), which lacks catalytic ubiquitin ligase activity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). We have shown that GS::RPM-1 LD acts as a biochemical ‘trap’ to enrich substrates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] In our experience, substrates were enriched in GS::RPM-1 LD samples while binding proteins were present in both GS::RPM-1 and GS::RPM-1 LD samples.\nNote: As a control strain, we used the rpm-1 promoter to express GS-tagged GFP (GS::GFP). GS::GFP was subjected to the same experimental conditions as our POI constructs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). This negative control strain was used to identify false positive hits during bioinformatic analysis of mass spectrometry data (see Part VI).\nGenerate RPM-1 transgenic worms.\nNote: Microinjections were done on a pha-1(e2123); rpm-1(ju44) protein null mutant background using a concentration of RPM-1 plasmid previously shown to rescue mutant phenotypes and a PHA-1 rescue cassette.27[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27] While co-injection marker could vary, we chose to use PHA-1 positive selection to facilitate biochemical screening for GS::RPM-1 transgenic lines. Since the pha-1 mutant is temperature sensitive, non-transgenic pha-1; rpm-1 mutants arrest at the L1 larval stage at 23°C. In contrast, pha-1; rpm-1 mutants expressing PHA-1 and RPM-1 transgenes do not arrest. As a result, PHA-1 selection ensures that only transgenic worms are present in large-scale liquid cultures, which is highly advantageous for biochemistry with transgenic extrachromosomal arrays. Note that another visible co-injection marker is also necessary for the subsequent integration of extrachromosomal arrays.\nTest functionality of GS tagged RPM-1 through phenotypic rescue.\nNote: We used axon termination defects that occur in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants as a phenotypic readout to test GS::RPM-1 constructs. We evaluated variable GS tag placement (N- and C-terminus) and different linkers between the GS tag and RPM-1 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "Note: We first confirmed that pha-1 did not interfere with the rpm-1 phenotype (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, rpm-1; pha-1). As a positive control for rescue, we used untagged RPM-1. We observed robust rescue for GS::RPM-1 with a multiple cloning site (MCS) linker but rescue was substantially impaired by a linker generated using Gateway cloning (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Mmc1.extension]). RPM-1::GS (C-terminal tag location) did not rescue (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A), which is likely due to GS tag proximity to the catalytic RING domain (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Therefore, we selected GS::RPM-1 with an N-terminal tag and MCS linker for our studies, and generated both RPM-1::GS LD and GS::GFP control constructs similarly. A flexible linker might also be considered for fusing an affinity tag with the POI (Table S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2727-Mmc1.extension]).\nIntegrate extrachromosomal arrays.\nNote: We tested GS::RPM-1, GS::RPM-1 LD and GS::GFP control for expression using western blot (not shown). With function and expression confirmed, one extrachromosomal array was integrated for each construct. Transgenic arrays were integrated into the genome using the TMP/UV protocol described above.\nNote: After outcrossing to wild-type, integrants were isolated on an rpm-1(ju44) protein null mutant background and again evaluated for rescue. We confirmed rescue with integrated GS::RPM-1, while GS::RPM-1 LD and GS::GFP did not rescue (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: Affinity purifications were done from integrated transgenic strains using IgG coupled Dynabeads, and quality control diagnostics were performed by silver staining (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A, 9% of sample) and Western blotting (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, 1% of sample). This demonstrated two key points. 1) We successfully purified POIs, GS::RPM-1 and GS::RPM-1 LD, as well as the GS::GFP negative control. 2) We observed relatively clean GS::GFP samples, and the presence of numerous silver-stained bands in test samples (GS::RPM-1 and GS::RPM-1 LD) compared to negative control (GS::GFP) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nAnalyze RPM-1 AP-proteomics results.",
    "Note: Scaffold (Proteome Software) was used to validate peptides and protein identifications detected by LC-MS/MS. RPM-1 binding proteins were assessed using the criteria described above in step 23. Ribosomal proteins and vitellogenins were removed as they are found in samples because of their roles in translation and post-embryonic development, respectively. Keratin, a contaminant from sample preparation, was removed as was GFP as it is present only in the negative control.\nNote: We also tested how two detergents (NP-40 and CHAPS) and varied detergent concentration (0.1% and 0.3% NP-40) affect proteomic profiles. We found that silver stain profiles (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) and proteomic hits (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and 6C) varied substantially with different extraction conditions. Two independent proteomics experiments for each extraction condition yielded both common and unique proteomic hits. These findings support two points: 1) Extraction conditions influence protein complexes and binding proteins associated with the POI. 2) At least two independent proteomics experiments should be performed for a single extraction condition due to increased hit identification.",
    "Note: To present data for individual proteomics experiments, we plotted total spectral counts for individual hits that were enriched two-fold or more in test samples versus GS::GFP negative control (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D). Hits enriched in GS::RPM-1 and GS::RPM-1 LD samples compared to GS::GFP samples largely represent putative RPM-1 binding proteins. To further differentiate between putative RPM-1 binding proteins and possible substrates, we highlight a much smaller number of proteomic hits that were enriched in GS::RPM-1 LD compared to GS::RPM-1 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D). To evaluate data for a given proteomic hit, we normalized based on two considerations. 1) POI amount, because the amount of GS::RPM-1 was consistently a bit lower than GS::RPM-1 LD (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). 2) Protein size of the proteomics candidates, as larger proteins have a greater probability of being identified than smaller proteins (See step 25 for calculation)."
