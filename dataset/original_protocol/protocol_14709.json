  "procedures": [
    "De-identified blood samples from healthy individuals were from the University of Colorado Hospital (Aurora, Colorado). The use of de-identified blood bank samples for validation studies as well as for the preparation of calibrators and quality control samples was considered “exempt” by the Colorado Multi-institutional Review Board (COMIRB, Aurora, Colorado).\n1. Preparation of References and Solutions\nPurchase tacrolimus and the internal standard D2,13C-tacrolimus from the vendors listed in the Materials List.\n\t\nPrepare stock solutions in pure methanol at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for tacrolimus and a concentration of 10 µg/ml for D2,13C-tacrolimus. Make stock solutions of reference materials based on three independent weightings. Aliquot stock solutions and store at -70 °C or below.\nPrepare solution to precipitate proteins and extract tacrolimus using methanol / 0.2 M ZnSO4 in water (7:3, v:v). This solution also contains the internal standard D2,13C-tacrolimus at a concentration of 2.5 ng/ml and is used for the extraction of all samples except for the extraction of blank samples (please see 1.3.3).\n\t\nPrepare this protein precipitation solution freshly on each extraction day and set the expiration of the solution at 12 hr.\nPreparation of calibration curve and quality control (QC) samples\n\t\nPrepare stock solutions of tacrolimus by performing appropriate dilutions of the stock solution using pure methanol.\nTo prepare calibrators and quality control samples, spike 20 µl of appropriately diluted stock solution into EDTA whole blood, incubate at 37 °C under gentle shaking in a water bath to allow for homogeneous distribution of tacrolimus into the cellular blood components for 20 min and aliquot into 1.5 ml polypropylene tubes with conical bottom and snap-on lids. Ensure that the relative volume of organic solvent does not exceed 5%.\nSpot 50 µl of the spiked whole blood into the middle of each circle on the filter cards using a pipette.",
    "Dry the blood spots on filter cards at RT for 3 hr.\nPrepare tacrolimus calibration standards in human EDTA whole blood at tacrolimus concentrations of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 ng/ml. Prepare a blank sample for extraction like the calibration standards with the protein precipitation solution containing the internal standard D2,13C-tacrolimus (“zero sample”).\nPrepare QC samples in human EDTA whole blood at concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 20, 40 ng/ml. Prepare a blank sample. In contrast to the QC samples that are extracted with precipitation containing the internal standard D2,13C-tacrolimus, extract this blank sample with protein precipitation solution that does not contain the internal standard D2,13C-tacrolimus (“blank sample”).\nCollection of clinical samples\n\t\nCollect dried blood spots as described in43,44.\n2. Extraction of Tacrolimus Dried Blood Spot Samples\nVisually inspect the dried blood spot to ensure acceptable sample quality and volume45.\nPunch center of the blood spot on the filter card with a 6-mm hole punch.\n\tNote: The quality of punches may be monitored by weighing. A punched saturated filter disc weighs in average 5.02 mg ± 0.09 mg (range: 4.83- 5.14 mg, n=12).\nPlace discs into 1.5 ml polypropylene tubes with conical bottom and snap-on lids.\nAdd 20-30 bullets to each tube.\nAdd 500 µl of the protein precipitation solution (methanol: 0.2 M ZnSO4, 7:3, v:v with 2.5 ng/ml internal standard) into each tube. For the extraction of blank samples, use protein precipitation solution without the internal standard.\nHomogenize the discs in the bullet blender for 1 min (maximum speed, setting “10”).\nShake samples at RT on multi-tube vortex (maximum speed, setting “10”) for 10 min.\nCentrifuge samples at 16,000 x g and 4 °C for 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatants into glass HPLC vials equipped with a 300 µl insert. Use pre-slit Teflon seals.",
    "Note: Extracted samples may be stored at -20 °C or below until LC-MS/MS analysis.\n3. LC-MS/MS Analysis\nLoad 100 µl of the supernatant of the extracted sample onto the C8 cartridge extraction column and wash with a 7:3 ratio of 0.1% formic acid in water: acetonitrile at a flow of 5 ml/min for 1 min. The connections of the switching valve are shown in Figure 2 and the gradient run by the extraction pump in Table 1.\nHereafter, activate the switching valve resulting in back-flush of the analytes from the pre-column onto the analytical column.\nSet the column thermostat to 65 °C.\nElute the analytes from the analytical column using the flow rates and gradient shown in Table 1.\nConnect the analytical column to a tandem mass spectrometer via the turbo electrospray ionization source. Adjust the key parameters of the mass spectrometer according to Table 2.\nDetect positive ions ([M+Na]+) in the multiple reaction mode (MRM). Use the following ion transitions for quantification: tacrolimus: m/z (mass/charge) = 826.6 → 616.2 and D2,13C-tacrolimus: m/z= 829.6 → 619.2.\n\tNote: The total run time is 4.6 min.\n4. Quantification\nFor each run, generate a calibration curve based on the calibrators prepared in 1.3.5 and include in each analytical run.\n\t\nGenerate a calibration curve by plotting nominal concentrations versus response factor of analyte (Peak Area [Analyte] / Peak Area [internal standard]) using the mass spectrometer software.\nFit the calibrators using a quadratic fit in combination with 1/X weighting.\nTo quantity tacrolimus in the dried blood spots integrate the tacrolimus and internal standard peaks in the extracted MRM chromatograms. Calculate the response factor for tacrolimus (Peak Area [Analyte] / Peak Area [internal standard]) and compare with the calibration curve using the mass spectrometry software.\n5. Validation Procedures",
    "Lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).\n\t\nConsider the lowest tacrolimus concentration with a peak-to-noise ratio of 4:1 as the lower limit of detection (LLOD). Define the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) as the lowest concentration of the calibration curve with an accuracy equal to or better than ± 20% deviation from the nominal concentration and precision equal to or better than 20% (coefficient of variance).\nIntra- and inter-day accuracies and precisions.\n\t\nTest the accuracy and precision at four concentration levels of 2 ng/ml (QC1), 4 ng/ml (QC2), 20 ng/ml (QC3) and 40 ng/ml (QC4).\nPrepare the QC samples on each validation day in human EDTA whole blood, dry on filter cards, extract, and analyze as described above.\nDetermine intra-day accuracy and precision with 6 samples per QC concentration level.\nAssess inter-day accuracy and precision over 20 days. Measure each QC level with 4 samples each day.\nAnalyze two calibration curves together with the QC samples on each day.\nCalculate intra-day accuracy as the % of the nominal concentration (six samples per concentration level, please see 5.2.2). Calculate precision as the coefficient of variance (CV%).\nConsider intra-day accuracy acceptable if it falls into the acceptance limits 85% to 115% of the nominal concentration. Consider intra-day precision acceptable if it is equal to or better than a CV (coefficient of variance) of 15%.\nCalculate inter-day accuracy and precision as the mean for each QC concentration level analyzed over the 20 validation days.\nConsider mean inter-day accuracy acceptable if it falls into the acceptance limits 85% to 115% of the nominal concentration. Consider inter-day precision acceptable if it is equal to or better than a CV (coefficient of variance) of 15%.\nExclusion of matrix interferences.",
    "For the exclusion of interferences that may be caused by matrix signals, analyze blank dried blood spots (8 different individuals, preferably 4 males and 4 females).\nVisually inspect ion chromatograms. If peaks within the retention time window of tacrolimus are detected, integrate and compare their areas under the curve with those of tacrolimus peaks in blank samples spiked with tacrolimus at the LLOQ. The area of peaks in the blank samples are not supposed to exceed 15% of those of tacrolimus at the LLOQ.\nIon suppression/ion enhancement.\n\t\nUse a post-column infusion protocol as described45 to assess potential interference of ion suppression/ion enhancement caused by co-eluting matrix components.\nInfuse tacrolimus at a concentration of 10 µg/ml dissolved in 0.1% formic acid: methanol (30:70, v/v) post-column at a rate of 10 µl/min.\n\t\t\nConnect a syringe pump via T-piece between the analytical column and the electrospray source of the mass spectrometer.\nMonitor the MS/MS signal intensity of the MRM transitions for tacrolimus and its internal standard (m/z = 826.6 → 616.2 and m/z = 829.6 → 619.2) after injection of extracted blank samples (n = 8 samples from different individuals).\n\t\t\tNote: In the absence of ion suppression/ion enhancement the continuous signal caused by infusion of the analytes should not be affected by injection of the blank matrix, while ion suppression causes a dip of the signal and ion enhancement a peak.\nCarry-over.\n\t\nAssess potential carry-over by analyzing extracted blank samples after the highest calibrators (50 ng/ml, n = 6).",
    "Visually inspect ion chromatograms. If peaks within the retention time window of tacrolimus are detected, integrate and compare their areas under the curve with those of tacrolimus peaks in blank samples spiked with tacrolimus at the LLOQ. The area of peaks in the blank samples are not supposed to exceed 15% of those of tacrolimus at the LLOQ.\nExtraction recoveries.\n\t\nDetermine recoveries by comparing the signals of the analytes after extraction of QC samples at all four concentration levels (n = 6 per concentration) with those of blank dried blood spots spiked with the corresponding amounts of tacrolimus after the extraction.\nPrepare four sets of QCs (concentration levels: 2, 4, 20, 40 ng/ml).\nPrepare another 4 sets of corresponding “recovery test samples” by spotting 50 µl of blank EDTA whole blood onto the filter paper cards and drying for 2 hr.\nHereafter, for both the QC and blank “recovery test samples”, cut out the entire blood spot on the filter card with scissors and place the resulting discs into a polypropylene tube with conical bottom and snap-on lid.\nExtract all samples.\nTransfer the supernatants (400 µl) into glass HPLC vials.\nAdd tacrolimus stock solution to the blank “extracted recovery test samples” to reach concentrations of 2, 4, 20 and 40 ng/ml (4 µl of 200, 400, 2,000, 4,000 ng/ml tacrolimus stock solutions to 400 µl of supernatant).\nAfter LC-MS/MS analysis, compare the signals in both QC samples and “recovery test samples” of the corresponding concentration (recovery% = signal samples spiked before extraction / signal samples spiked after extraction x 100).\nDilution integrity.\n\t\nEstablish dilution integrity using samples spiked with the analytes at 500, 250 and 100 ng/ml.\nAfter extraction, dilute samples using protein precipitation solution (1:10, n = 3 per concentration level).",
    "Calculate deviations from the nominal concentrations. Consider results that fall within 85%-115% of nominal acceptable.\nStabilities.\n\t\nInvestigate stabilities using the QC samples at all four concentration levels (n = 4 per concentration) analyzed at different time-points and under the different storage conditions.\nCompare results after storage with the nominal values. Consider results that fall within 85%-115% of nominal acceptable.\nEstablish sample stability for 1 week at ambient temperature, 1 week at 4 °C, 1 month at -20 °C and 1 month at -80 °C.\nTest freeze-thaw stability over three cycles (-20 °C). Test extracted sample and autosampler stability by placing samples into the thermostatted autosampler adjusted to 4 °C. Inject samples after 72 hr.\nSubscription Required.
