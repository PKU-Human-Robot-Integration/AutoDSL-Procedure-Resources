    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVirus injection\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section includes the procedure of drilling, screw implantation, DR and PBC virus microinjection and the parameter setting of the injection process.\nAccording to the determined position parameters of the injected brain area, Bregma of the anterior fontanel is 0 point.\nMove the dental drill.\nMark the position range of the nucleus cluster with a pen.\nOpen the appropriate bone window according to the size of the range.\nNote: The window should be as small as possible without interfering with the experiment.\nCarefully grind the skull at the injection site with a dental drill to thin the skull slowly.\nWhen the skull cracks, use the needle of a medical syringe to carefully prick it to prevent damage.\nNote: If there is bleeding during the process, use a very small medical cotton ball to pull a long strip to suck the blood away.\nCritical: The drilling must be well controlled, otherwise it is easy to accidentally cause the brain tissue damage after drilling through the skull (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E and 2F).\nImplant four miniature screws along the lateral portions of the front and back of the skull, forming roughly a square (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2494-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(E) We implanted an ICV guide cannula on the right side of the skull to microinject KET, which indicates the lower incidence of S-IRA after photostimulation DR was remarkably reversed by ICV injection of KET at a dose of 18.3 nmol.\n(F) Representative images of implanted EEG, ICV and optic fiber devices in a DBA/1 mouse. ICV, intracerebroventricular injection; PTZ, pentylenetetrazole; DR, dorsal raphe nucleus; KET, ketanserin; EEG, electroencephalogram; ICV, intracerebroventricular injection.\nSlowly insert the glass electrode until it reaches the target nucleus.\nNote: In our experiment, there are blood vessels flowing above the target nucleus DR, so we avoid the blood vessels by adjusting the needle entry angle to achieve better injection effect (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nCritical: There may be blood vessels flowing above some nuclei. Vertical needle insertion will inevitably damage the blood vessels and cause bleeding at the injection site. Improper treatment may easily cause blockage of the glass electrode tip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nBased on the mouse atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (4th Edition, 2013), microinject (100 nl, at a rate of 20 nl/min) pAAV-TPH2-PRO-ChETA-EYFP-WPRES-PAS according to the following stereotaxic coordinates of DR (AP − 4.55 mm, ML − 0.44 mm, DV − 2.80 mm, 10°right) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nCritical: It is recommended that the injection speed should be set at 10–40 nl/min and the injection time should be controlled at 10 min.\nNote: This step is to observe the effect of activating 5-HT neurons in DR on the incidence of S-IRA.\nDeliver the viruses via a gauge needle for the specification of 10 μL (cat# 60700010, Gao Ge, Co., Ltd, ShangHai, China) by an Ultra Micro Pump (160494 F10E, WPI) over a period of 10 min (including the residence time of the needle tip in the brain area before and after injection).",
    "Note: During use, place the virus on ice or in a 4°C refrigerator to minimize the time at room temperature.\nTreatment for blocked needle tip of virus injection: firstly, wipe the needle tip with normal saline cotton ball. If the needle tip is still blocked after the injection pump is quickly pushed, cut off some electrode tips.\nCritical: During microinjection, observe whether the liquid level stratification of the virus and liquid paraffin in the glass electrode drops through the microscope.\nAfter the end of infusion, do not remove the syringe until 15–20 min to allow the diffusion of the viruses.\nNote: Determine the injection amount according to the target nucleus, virus titer (in this protocol the titer of photogenetic virus is greater than 5 × 1012 vg/mL) and virus type to achieve ideal experimental results.\nCritical: To avoid viruses leaking to the nucleus above the target brain area, the needle stopping time after injection shall not be less than 10 min. On the one hand, it allows the virus to spread, and on the other hand, it prevents the virus from leaking out of the nucleus as the needle is pulled out.\nFor retrograde labeling of projection neurons, microinject CTB-555 (100 nl, 1 μg/μL, BrainVTA Technology Co. Ltd, Wuhan, China) in the DR (AP − 4.55 mm, ML − 0.44 mm, DV − 2.80 mm, 10°right) or the right side of the PBC (AP − 6.80 mm, ML − 1.25 mm, DV − 4.95 mm), and we waited approximately 1 week (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2494-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The location of CTB-555 injection in DR and PBC\n(A) The drilling point in the mouse skull indicates the CTB-555 injection site(red) in DR and in bilateral PBC(blue).\n(B and C) Microinjection of CTB-555 in DR and the right side of PBC.",
    "(D and E) Neural projection from the DR to the PBC established by the application of the nerve tracer CTB-555. DR, dorsal raphe nucleus; PBC, pre-Bötzinger complex.\nNote: For virus expression, we wait approximately 1 week. This step is to directly verify the bidirectional projection between DR-PBC.\nFor the photostimulation of the bilateral PBC, deliver pAAV-TPH2 PRO-ChETA-EYFP-WPRES-PAS in the bilateral PBC (AP − 6.80 mm, ML − 1.25 mm, DV − 4.95 mm).\nNote: This step is to test the effect of activating 5-HT neurons in PBC on the incidence of S-IRA.\nDevice implantation\nTiming: 1 h\nTo avoid the damage caused by the second operation and the difficulty in locating the nucleus, we completed virus injection and device implantation at the same time in one operation. This section describes the scheme of implanting optical fiber in DR and PBC, implanting guide cannula and embedding cortical EEG electrodes in mice.\nImplant the optical fiber (FOC-W-1.25-200-0.37-3.0, Inper, Hangzhou, China) above DR for 0.05 mm (AP − 4.55 mm, ML − 0.44 m, DV − 2.75 mm, 10°right) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J–2L).\nNote: Implanted the optical fiber at a right tilt of 10° to avoid damaging the blood vessels above the DR, and reducing the postoperative mortality of the mice.\nUse the dental cement fix the optical fiber.\nFor intracerebroventricular injection (ICV) surgery, ICV guide cannula implantation (AP - 0.45 mm; ML - 1.0 mm; V - 2.50 mm) and fixation were completed using the protocol as described above and implant a headstage for electroencephalogram (EEG) in the same mice9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Note: This step is to investigate the role of 5-HT2A receptor in the brain in the regulation of S-IRA. We observed whether the suppression effect of S-IRA mediated by activating 5-HT neurons in DR or intraperitoneal injection of 5-HTP could be reversed by the ICV delivery of KET.\nFor microinjection of KET in the bilateral PBC, implant guide cannulas (O.D.0.48 × I.D.0.34 mm/M3.5,62033, RWD Life Science Inc.) on both sides of PBC (AP − 6.80 mm, ML − 1.25 mm, DV − 4.90 mm) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]M–2O, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2494-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The implantation of optical fiber in DR and bilateral guide cannula in PBC\n(A) The drilling point in the mouse skull indicates the virus injection site(red) in DR and the implantation site of bilateral guide cannula in PBC(blue).\n(B) The four gray dots correspond to the recommended location of the anchor screws.\n(C and D) Schematic illustration of pAAV-TPH2-PRO-ChETA-EYFP-WPRES-PAS delivery into the DR of DBA/1 mice and implantation of the optic fiber.\n(E) We implanted bilateral guide cannula in PBC to microinject KET, which indicates optogenetic activation of TPH2-ChETA neurons in DR-mediated reduction of PTZ-induced S-IRA was significantly reversed by injection of KET into the PBC.\n(F) Schematic diagram of intraperitoneal injection PTZ and behavioral assessment of seizure by recording. PBC pre-Bötzinger complex; PTZ, pentylenetetrazole; DR, dorsal raphe nucleus; KET, ketanserin.\nNote: This step is to further explore the role of 5-HT2A receptor located in the PBC in the inhibition of S-IRA by activating 5-HT neurons in DR.",
    "For the photometry recordings, deliver AAV2/9-mCaMKIIa-GCaMP6f-WPRE-pA via microinjection using the same protocol for the bilateral PBC (AP − 6.80 mm, ML − 1.25 mm, DV − 4.95 mm), and implant an optical fiber (FOC-W-1.25-200-0.37-3.0, Inper) over 0.05 mm (AP − 6.80 mm, ML − 1.25 mm, DV − 4.90 mm) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2494-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. The implantation of optical fiber in DR and bilateral calcium recording fiber in PBC\n(A) The drilling point in the mouse skull indicates the virus injection site(red) in DR and the implantation site of bilateral guide cannula in PBC(blue).\n(B) Portable laser power meter. Before the optogenetic experiments and photometry recordings, we use portable laser power meter to test whether the light intensity of the front end of the optical fiber reaches the expected value.\n(C) Schematic illustration of pAAV-TPH2-PRO-ChETA-EYFP-WPRES-PAS delivery into the DR of DBA/1 mice.\n(D and E) Bilateral microinjection of AAV2/9-mCaMKIIa-GCaMP6f-WPRE-pA and the implantation of calcium signal recording fiber in PBC.\n(F) Photometric recordings from DBA/1 mice infected with ChETA and GCaMP6f in the DR and the bilateral PBC and of neural activity based on calcium signaling in the bilateral PBC. DR, dorsal raphe nucleus: PBC, pre-Bötzinger complex.\nNote: This step is to record the change of calcium signal of PBC5-HT neurons during seizures and the effect of photostimulating DR on the calcium signal of PBC5-HT neurons.\nCritical: Before the bone cement effectively fixes the cannula, do not place and tighten the tube core to avoid the displacement of the casing position caused by external forces (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]P).",
    "Note: When using dental cement to fix the cannula, the anchor screws must be completely covered with cement, and only the upper part of the guide sleeve is visible outside the implant structure. It is not appropriate to apply too much dental cement to avoid adverse effects on the recovery and physiological activities of mice.\nFor the photostimulation of the bilateral PBC, deliver pAAV-TPH2 PRO-ChETA-EYFP-WPRES-PAS in the bilateral PBC (AP − 6.80 mm, ML − 1.25 mm, DV − 4.95 mm), and implant an optical fiber within a guide cannula (O.D.0.48 × I.D.0.34 mm/M3.5, 62033, RWD Life and FOC-W-1.25-200-0.37-3.0, Inper, Hangzhou, China) over 0.05 mm (AP − 6.80 mm, ML − 1.25 mm, DV − 4.90 mm) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2494-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. The implantation of bilateral optical fiber and guide cannula in PBC\n(A) The drilling point in the mouse skull indicates the virus injection site and the implantation site of bilateral optical fiber and guide cannula in PBC (blue).\n(B) All implantation devices in a DBA/1 mouse.\n(C and D) Schematic illustration of pAAV-TPH2-PRO-ChETA-EYFP-WPRES-PAS delivery into the PBC of DBA/1 mice and implantation of the optic fiber.\n(E) We implanted bilateral guide cannula in PBC to microinject KET.\n(F) Schematic diagram of intraperitoneal injection PTZ and behavioral assessment of seizure by recording. PBC, pre-Bötzinger complex; KET, ketanserin; PTZ, pentylenetetrazole.\nNote: After implantation, allow the virus to express for 3 weeks. It is worth noting that CTB-555 only needs 1week.\nThis step aims to explore the effect of activation of PBC5-HT neurons on the incidence of S-IRA and the effect of inhibiting PBC 5-HT2A receptors during PBC photostimulation on the incidence of S-IRA.",
    "At the end of the experiment, the expression of viruses and the location of an optic fiber cannula tip and guide cannula tip in the nucleus of each mouse were verified by histology.\nPhotostimulation and fiber photometry experiment\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to conduct photogenetics and fiber photometry experiment as well as parameter setting for specific experiments.\nSince calcium signal recording is susceptible to the influence of external light, we recommend that it be carried out in a dark environment.\nAnimal handle and habituation.\nHandle the mice injected with the virus and implanted with optical fiber two days in advance, mainly touching the back of the mice to reduce the stress reaction of the mice during the experiment.\nEach mouse stimulation lasts about 5–7 min.\nOn the third day, place the mice implanted with optical fiber in the test device to adapt to the environment of the box, and each mouse takes about 10 min.\nNote: Scrub the device with 75% alcohol before and after placement to eliminate external interference.\nConnect the optic genetic system and the photometry recording system with the experimental animal through the ceramic sleeve, optical fiber, rotary joints and fiber patch cables.\nNote: To ensure the accuracy of calcium signal recording, it is recommended to carry out the fiber photometry experiment in a laboratory with stable and dark light.\nIn the recording box, we place a camera to facilitate synchronous analysis of calcium signal data and animal behavior data (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2494-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Photostimulation and Fiber photometry experiment\nThe main components of photostimulation and fiber photometry experiment: a computer with movable camera, a recording box, a recording cage, an optic genetic system and a photometry recording system with some related accessories, such as fiber patch cables and rotary joints.",
    "Set the required experimental parameters, such as pulse width, frequency and time, on the optical genetic equipment.\nNote: In our experiment, the fiber photometry system (Inper, Hangzhou, China, C11946) used a 488-nm diode laser. The parameter for photostimulation of the DR: blue-light, 465 nm, 20 Hz, 20-ms pulse width, 15 mW, and 20 min) delivered by the laser (B12124, Inper) through a 200-μm optic fiber.\nCritical: Before inserting the optical fiber, use the light intensity tester to test whether the light intensity at the front end of the ceramic sleeve reaches the set value (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nIn the fiber photometry experiment, it is necessary to record 410 nm signal simultaneously.\nNote: 410 nm laser will not affect the signal of fluorescent protein, but it can reflect the signal changes of the above interference factors to reflect the background noise signal and can remove the background noise signal to directly obtain the real calcium signal data.\nAfter the animals adapt to the environment, start recording.\nNote: In the selection of consumables, black ceramic inserts and black ceramic sleeves can well avoid the interference of ambient light on the changes of fluorescence in the brain of experimental animals."
