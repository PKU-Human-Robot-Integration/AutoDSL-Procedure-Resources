    "All animal handling and surgical procedures were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were fed standard diet and water ad libitum.\n1. Preparation of Surgical and Non-surgical Instruments\nSterilize the surgical and non-surgical instruments in an autoclave. \nClean the surgical operating table with 70% ethanol and warm a heating pad to 37 °C.\nPlace the heating pad on the operating table and cover it with sterile surgical drapes.\nNOTE: In all survival procedures, the \"No Touch\" technique is used here to maintain sterility.\n2. Preparation of Animals and Performing the T9-T10 Spinal Laminectomy\nProcure adult (Balb/c) 10-week-old male mice. Induce anesthesia in each animal using an inhaler beginning with 5% isoflurane, and then decrease to 2-3% to maintain sedation for the remainder of the procedures.\nConfirm complete anesthesia by eliciting no response to a tail/paw pinch induced nociception stimulation.\nShave the hair over the dorsum (head to tail) with an electric clipper, and then apply the depilatory cream (3 min) to remove the remaining hair. Finally, wash the dorsum with running water/wet scrub, and return the animals to their cages.\nNOTE: This is necessary to avoid additional irritation to the skin and chemical contamination at the time of skin wounding\nThe next day, apply ophthalmic ointment to the corneas to protect the eyes from drying during the surgical procedure and then, scrub the skin with 3 alternative preparations of betadine scrub and 70% ethanol.\nWith a scalpel, perform a skin incision (~1.0-1.5 cm) along the midline on the back at the level of T8-T12 vertebrae.\nNOTE: The level of vertebrae is identified by back counting the vertebra from T13 using the location of floating ribs that correspond to T13 vertebra11,12.",
    "Clear the subcutaneous adipose tissue to get access to the paraspinal muscles and then dissect them slowly to expose the spinous processes and laminae on both sides.\nNOTE: Do this procedure very carefully to avoid excess bleeding or any injury to the spinal cord, at this point.\nPerform a laminectomy to expose the spinal cord (T9-T10 vertebrae) by gently peeling off the spinal lamina using microdissecting forceps.\nNOTE: Perform the laminectomy so that an excess of the spinal cord is exposed to facilitate the creation of the injury. In the control group, only the laminectomy is performed.\n3. Performing the T9-T10 Complete Spinal Cord Injury\nUsing forceps, secure the spinal column at T8 and lift up to exaggerate the spinal curvature.\nUsing fine scissors, section the spinal cord between the T9 and T10 vertebra all the way to the floor of the vertebral canal, to ensure complete transection.\nAfter observing the complete transection under a surgical microscope, apply a piece of subcutaneous fat over the laminectomy site to provide additional protection to the spinal cord prior to surgical site closure.\nFinally, close the wound and suture the paravertebral muscles, superficial fascia, using continuous suture and then close the skin using suture clips12.\nPost-SCI, observe the bowel movement on the next day; however, manage the urinary bladder by manual bladder evacuation.\nNOTE: The Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) can be used to monitor the progress of hindlimb functional recovery post-SCI at day 2 and then weekly, see Supplementary Figure 111,12,13.\n4. Induction of Skin Pressure Ulcer after Complete SCI\nImmediately after the SCI surgery, scrub the back of the animal with betadine and 70% alcohol.",
    "For a PU below the SCI site, inject in the dorsal skin near the sacrum, a very small volume (10 µL) of 0.125% bupivacaine solution using a 25 G needle at equidistant places ~0.5-1.0 cm apart, in an ellipse around the magnet application site.\nNOTE: For a PU above the SCI site, inject the dorsal skin near the cervical region.\nGently lift a skin fold on the back of the mouse and sandwich it between 2 magnetic discs (5×12 mm diameter, 2.4 g each, 3800 G magnetic force) (Figure 1).11,12\nImmediately after magnet application, return animals to single cages placed onto a heating pad until full consciousness is regained (Figure 1).\nAfter 12 h of magnet application, lightly anesthetize animal with isoflurane and remove the magnets. Take a photograph of the wound sites, to record the initial appearance of PU (day 0 time point). Cover the wound with transparent dressing film (3M) to avoid drying or contamination.\n5. Post-operative Animal Care, Euthanasia, and Tissue Collection for Histology\nImmediately after surgery, inject the animal with 1 mL of 0.9% saline subcutaneously for hydration.\nSubcutaneously inject buprenorphine-SR (1 mg/kg) immediately for analgesia.\nInject subcutaneously animal daily meloxicam (1 mg/kg), and cefazolin (50 mg/kg for 3-7 days), and twice daily manual bladder evacuation.\nPlace animals in single cages and provide accessible food and water ad libitum. Mice with complete SCI can walk using their forelimbs and approach the food and water without any difficulties.\nRemove surgical clips 7 days after SCI surgery.\nAt the desired time points after SCI and skin wounding, euthanize animals by CO2 inhalation (3-5 min), in accordance with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia14.\nCollect wounded skin samples, fix in 10% formalin for 24 h, and then store in 70% ethanol at 4 °C until sectioning.",
    "To process tissues, embed in paraffin and generate thin sections (5 µm) on a microtome. Stain with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to visualize tissue morphology (Figure 3). For immunohistochemistry studies (Figure 4), stain sections using appropriate antibodies for Ki67 (proliferation), CD31 (angiogenesis), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) as described in Kumar et al.12\nNOTE: Image analysis software can be used to quantify image features12.\nSubscription Required.
