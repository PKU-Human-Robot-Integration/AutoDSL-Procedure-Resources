The gRNA target sequences start with a 5′ G, which allows for efficient U6 promoter-driven expression. Oligonucleotide sequences were determined in the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section. This protocol was established by (Gratz et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) and is part of a cloning protocol selection by the FlyCRISPR website https://flycrispr.org/protocols/grna/[href=https://flycrispr.org/protocols/grna/].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/519-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Cloning strategy to insert gRNAs into the pU6-BbsI-gRNA plasmid\n(A) The pU6-BbsI-gRNA plasmid is used to express gRNAs under the control of the U6 promoter in Drosophila embryos.\n(B) Oligonucleotides are annealed and overhangs allow insertion into the linearized vector (1). The vector is linearized by BbsI digestion (2) and the annealed oligonucleotides are ligated into the backbone (3). Plasmids with successfully inserted gRNA1 (one-step CRISPR) or gRNA1 and gRNA2 (two-step CRISPR) sequences are purified for microinjection (4). gRNA2 is labeled with an asterisk as it is only required for the two-step approach.\nOne-step CRISPR and two-step CRISPR\nDay 1. Reconstitute and anneal the designed phosphorylated oligonucleotides (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nSet up the following annealing reaction for each oligonucleotide pair:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_519_1.csv\nAnneal oligonucleotides in a thermocycler at 95°C for 5 min, then ramp the temperature down to 25°C at a rate of −0.1°C/s (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 1).\nDigest vector for gRNA insertion with the BbsI-HF restriction enzyme, dephosphorylate and ligate the annealed gRNA oligonucleotides (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nDigest 1 μg of pU6-BbsI-gRNA plasmid in a 40 μL reaction with 10 Units of BbsI-HF restriction enzyme for 2 h at 37°C (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 2).",
    "Dephosphorylate the vector by adding Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (NEB, Cat# M0290) to the reaction and incubate for an additional 30 min.\nLoad digest reaction onto an 1% agarose gel and run at 100 V for about 30 min . Gel purify the digested plasmid to remove any undigested plasmid (for example QIAquick PCR & Gel Cleanup Kit; Qiagen, Cat# 28506).\nLigate the annealed gRNA oligos into the linearized pU6-BbsI-gRNA vector using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, Cat# M0202) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 3).\nTransform ligation reactions into competent cells, for example Stellar competent cells (TaKaRa, Cat# 636763).\nConfirm gRNA oligonucleotide insertion by sequencing minipreps (for example PureLink Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# K210010) with T7 or T3 primers.\nDay 2. Pick bacterial colonies and set up liquid cultures to grow for approximately 14 h.\nDay 3. Perform the miniprep protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions and send the DNA sample for sequencing.\nDay 5. Verify gRNA insertion based on DNA sequencing (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nStart liquid cultures and grow over night for approximately 14 h.\nDay 6. Purification of plasmid DNA after successful verification of oligonucleotide insertion (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nUse a kit to prepare plasmid DNA (for one gRNA for one-step CRISPR and two gRNAs for two-step CRISPR) that is sufficiently pure for microinjection (for example Maxi Prep Plus Kit; Qiagen, Cat# 12963) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 4).\nGenerally, elute in nuclease-free water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# AM9938).\nUse the extra wash step when suggested in the DNA prep kit protocol.\nFilter eluted DNA using Millipore filters (Merck, Cat. # SLGVR04NL) and spin down prior to injections.\nAlternatives: Both gRNAs can be expressed simultaneously from the pCFD4 or pCFD5 plasmids (http://www.crisprflydesign.org/plasmids/[href=http://www.crisprflydesign.org/plasmids/]).\nPause Point: The plasmids can be stored at −20°C for years.",
    "Introduction of homology arms into the dsDNA donor plasmid\nTiming: ∼11 days\nThis section outlines how to generate a dsDNA donor plasmid that is used for HDR after Cas9 mediated cleavage.\nFor the one-step CRISPR approach, HAs are located directly upstream and downstream of the cut site where the MS2 loops will be inserted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). The donor plasmid contains a pBlueScript backbone, a DsRed maker gene placed between two loxP sites, 24xMS2 stem-loops and MCSs for HA insertion (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) (Lim et al., 2018a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). Other sequences can be inserted instead of 24xMS2 stem-loops.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/519-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cloning strategy to insert HAs into the pDsRed- 24MS2 plasmid for one-step CRISPR\n(A) Detailed view of the target sequence that starts with a 5′G and ends with the NGG PAM site and the gRNA. HAs sit on either site of the Cas9 cleavage site, which is located in the target sequence, 3 nt away from the PAM sequence.\n(B) The pDsRed-24MS2 plasmid contains two MCSs for HA insertion, the DsRed marker gene flanked by loxP sites and 24xMS2 stem-loops.\n(C) HA1 is PCR amplified from genomic DNA (1). The plasmid backbone is linearized using restriction sites in the 5′ MCS (2) and ligated with the HA1 fragment (3). The resulting pDsRed-24MS2+HA1 plasmid is linearized by restriction digest (4) and the HA2 fragment is amplified from genomic DNA (5). HA2 is ligated into the linearized vector (6) and purified for microinjection (7).\n(D) The finished plasmid pDsRed-24MS2+HA1+HA2 is used as a dsDNA donor for CRISPR engineering.",
    "For the two-step CRISPR approach, we use the pTVCherry plasmid (DGRC, Cat# 1338), which contains an attP reintegration site, a mini-white marker gene, loxP sites and is flanked by MCSs into which HA sequences are introduced (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) (Baena-Lopez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The HAs are positioned upstream of the 5′ cut site (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B) and downstream of the 3′ cut site.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/519-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Cloning strategy to insert HAs into the pTVcherry plasmid for two-step CRISPR\n(A) The pTVcherry plasmid contains two MCSs to insert HA sequences for HDR, a mini-white marker gene, loxP and FRT sites, and an attP site. It also contains a mCherry gene (not shown).\n(B) Detailed view of the target sequence, starting with a 5′G and ending with the NGG PAM site. The Cas9 cleavage site is located 3 nt away from the PAM sequence and the 5′ HA ends upstream of the cleavage site.\n(C) HA1 is amplified from genomic DNA (1), the pTVcherry plasmid is linearized using restriction sites in the 5′ MCS (2) and both are ligated (3). The pTVcherry+HA1 plasmid is linearized using restriction sites present in the 3′ MCS (4) and the HA2 insert is PCR amplified from genomic DNA (5) before it is ligated into the plasmid backbone (6). The plasmid containing both HAs is purified for microinjection (7).\n(D) The resulting pTVcherry+HA1+HA2 plasmid can be used as a dsDNA donor plasmid during CRISPR engineering.\nAlternatives: Plasmids can be synthesized commercially.\nNote: The cloning to insert HAs into the dsDNA donor plasmid can be performed concurrently with the gRNA cloning to shorten the time needed to prepare plasmids for microinjection.\nOne-step CRISPR",
    "Day 1. PCR amplify HA1 (5′) and HA2 (3′) from genomic DNA from the fly line that will be used for injection and digest with restriction enzymes (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Use primers that were designed in the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section.\nUse a high-fidelity DNA polymerase, e.g., Q5 (NEB, Cat# M0491) or Phusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# F530) for PCR (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C, step 1).\nDigest the purified PCR inserts, with the restriction enzymes whose recognition sequences were added to the HA primers, for insertion into the donor plasmid.\nInsert HA1 into the linearized pBS-24xMS2-loxP-DsRed-loxP (hereafter referred to as pDsRed-24MS2) backbone plasmid (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nDigest the donor plasmid backbone with the same restriction enzymes as the HA1 insert (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C, step 2).\nDephosphorylate the vector with Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase.\nGel purify the linearized vector.\nLigate HA1 insert into the linear vector using T4 DNA ligase (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C, step 3).\nTransform the ligated plasmid into bacterial competent cells.\nDays 2–5. Verify successful HA1 insertion by diagnostic restriction digests and sequencing.\nDay 2. Pick bacterial colonies and set up liquid cultures for approximately14 h.\nDay 3. Use liquid cultures to generate plasmid minipreps. Set up a diagnostic restriction digest https://www.addgene.org/protocols/diagnostic-digest/ using, for example, the restriction enzymes that were used to insert the HA1 insert. Check the DNA fragments using gel electrophoresis.\nSequence minipreps, which show successful HA1 insertion by diagnostic digest, using primers positioned upstream and downstream of the insert.\nDay 5. Verify successful HA1 insertion from the sequencing reads (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nDays 6–10. Clone the HA2 insert into the pDsRed-24MS2+HA1 plasmid (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C, steps 4–6).\nRepeat steps 5–7 amplifying and inserting HA2.",
    "Day 11. Generate a high quality maxiprep (for example Maxi Prep Plus Kit; Qiagen, Cat# 12963, see additional considerations in step 4) of the donor pDsRed-24MS2+HA1+HA2 plasmid for microinjection (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C, step7). The finished plasmid is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D.\nNote: To generate the pDsRed-24MS2 plasmid, the 24xMS2 stem-loops were extracted from the pCR4-24xMS2SL-stable plasmid (Addgene, Cat# 31865) by BglII and BamHI digestion and inserted into the BamHI restriction site of pBluescript together with two loxP sites and a DsRed marker gene (Lim et al., 2018a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]).\nTwo-step CRISPR\nCloning steps are similar to the one-step CRISPR approach outlined in detail above, but a different starting plasmid that contains an attP site is used (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). In short:\nDay 1: HA1 and 2 are amplified using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase and digested with restriction enzymes that recognisethe sequences that were added to the HA primers (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, steps 1 and 5).\nHA1 is inserted into the linearized pTVCherry vector (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, steps 2 and 3).\nDays 2–5. Verify successful HA1 insertion by diagnostic restriction digest and sequencing (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nDay 6. Ligate HA2 into the linearized pTVCherry+HA1 plasmid (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, steps 4 and 6).\nDays 7–10. Use diagnostic digests and sequencing to verify the successful insertion of HA2 in the plasmid.\nDay 11. Generate a maxiprep of the pTVCherry+HA1+HA2 plasmid for microinjection (see additional considerations in protocol step 4) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C, step7). The finished pTVCherry+HA1+HA2 plasmid is shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D.\nPause Point: The plasmids can be stored at −20°C for years.\nMicroinjection and selection of CRISPR edited flies\nTiming: One-step CRISPR ∼8 weeks; two-step CRISPR ∼8 weeks to insert attP and 3 weeks to amplify for microinjection\nOne-step CRISPR and two-step CRISPR",
    "Week 1. The respective donor plasmid is injected together with one or two gRNA plasmids into Cas9 expressing embryos. A list of Cas9 expressing fly lines available can be found here: https://bdsc.indiana.edu/stocks/genome_editing/crispr_cas9.html[href=https://bdsc.indiana.edu/stocks/genome_editing/crispr_cas9.html].\nThe examples chosen in Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A (step 1) use the yw, nos-Cas9 fly line (gift from Simon Collier and available from the Ashe lab).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/519-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. One-step CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering in Drosophila embryos\nTogether the pDsRed+24MS2+HA1+HA2 donor plasmid and the plasmid expressing gRNA1 are injected into Drosophila embryos of the genotype yw, nos-Cas9 (F0) (1). Surviving flies (a female is shown as an example) are crossed to balancer flies (2). Putative CRISPR edited flies are identified by DsRed marker gene expression in F1 flies (3). Each CRISPR edited fly is individually crossed to Cre-recombinase expressing flies (4), resulting in the removal of the marker cassette from the genome (F2, select w+ CyO flies and against Sco). Correct editing is verified by sequencing (not shown). Flies, now lacking the DsRed marker, are crossed to each other (5), resulting in F3 flies, homozygous for the modified gene locus. These flies can be used for live imaging experiments. In this crossing scheme all flies carry yw mutations on the X chromosome (not shown in the genotypes for simplicity).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/519-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Two-step CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering in Drosophila embryos and ϕC31 integrase mediated attP/attB recombination",
    "(A) The pTVcherry+HA1+HA2 plasmid together with gRNA1 and gRNA2 plasmids are injected into Drosophila embryos of the genotype yw, nos-Cas9;; (F0) (1). Survivors are crossed individually to yw flies (2). Flies that potentially have a correct editing event are identified by red eyes (mini-white marker) in the F1 generation (3). These flies are then crossed individually to a balancer fly line (4), before confirming the editing event by sequencing (not shown). Balanced flies from the single mating are then crossed to each other in the F2 generation (5) to obtain flies homozygous for the CRISPR inserted attP locus.\n(B) The reintegration plasmid, containing MS2 stem-loops, a mCherry marker gene and the genomic region removed during CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering, and the plasmid expressing ϕC31 integrase are injected into Drosophila embryos carrying the attP site (F0) (1). Injected flies are crossed individually to balancer flies (2). Successful reintegration is detected by mCherry fluorescence in the eyes of F1 flies (3). Transformants are crossed to a Cre-recombinase expressing fly line to remove the combined marker region containing the mini-white and mCherry marker gene sequences between the two outermost loxP sites (4). F2 flies (select w+ CyO flies and against Sco) that have lost mCherry fluorescence are crossed to each other to obtain flies homozygous for the modified gene locus (5). Note that the flies used in these injection and reintegration schemes also carry yw mutations on the X chromosome (not shown).\nNote: Initially inject 200–400 Drosophila embryos. More embryos can be injected if low recovery of edited flies is expected, for example due to targeting genomic regions on the X chromosome that may cause male lethality. Many commercial injection services are available that have optimized the injection protocol.",
    "Critical: When using the DsRed marker gene or another fluorescent marker, make sure to use a Cas9 transgenic line without fluorescent markers of similar wavelength. Here we use a line with nos-Cas9 on the X- chromosome and no additional markers. This line has the advantage that it is compatible with CRISPR schemes based on selection with a fluorescent protein or mini-white, but relies on loss of nos-Cas9 over time. In contrast, Cas9 lines marked with fluorescent proteins, such as y1 M{RFP[3xP3.PB] GFP[E.3xP3]=vas-Cas9}ZH-2A w1118/FM7c [RRID:BDSC_51323], allow Cas9 to be selected against in subsequent generations, but are incompatible with some donor plasmids.\nNote: The plasmid concentration to be injected varies. We inject 100 ng/μl of each gRNA plasmid and 500 ng/μl of the donor plasmid. Other concentrations have been tested (Gratz et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nNote: The examples in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] and 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A show the crossing schemes for a targeted gene locus on the 2nd chromosome.\nNote: The example crossing scheme for the one-step CRISPR approach outlines a time efficient way to identify the CRISPR-Cas9 genome modification and remove the Cre-recombinase from the genome. Crossing the injection survivors to wildtype flies may increase the number of progeny, increasing the chances of finding a fly with a modified genome, but will then require the extra step of balancing the edited locus so it can be selected when the visible marker is removed by Cre.\nOne-step CRISPR\nWeek 3. Cross all surviving flies individually (F0 generation) to a 2nd chromosome balancer fly line (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], step 2).\nThe example in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], step 2, shows a surviving female.\nThe balancer stock used in this example is y1 w67c23; snaSco/CyO (Ashe lab).",
    "Week 5. Identify flies that may have successful HDR and germline transmission by the presence of the DsRed marker in the F1 generation (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], step 3).\nDsRed fluorescence is driven by a 3xP3 (pax) promoter and primarily expressed in the eyes and ocelli. Additionally, DsRed fluorescence can be detected in the abdomen.\nWeek 5. Cross the F1 CRISPR positive flies identified above individually to a Cre-recombinase expressing fly line to remove the DsRed marker gene flanked by loxP sites (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], step 4).\nChoose a Cre expressing fly line with a convenient balancer. A list of Cre-recombinase expressing fly lines can be found here: https://bdsc.indiana.edu/stocks/recombinases/recomb_alt.html[href=https://bdsc.indiana.edu/stocks/recombinases/recomb_alt.html].\nIn Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], step 4, a female F1 fly that has a modified gene locus over a CyO balancer is crossed to males expressing Cre recombinase on a CyO balancer [RRID:BDSC_1092].\nSet up individual crosses with a number of putative CRISPR positives in case of off-target effects.\nAfter the cross has produced a sufficient amount of eggs and larvae are visible, verify the correct genome integration by purifying genomic DNA from the DsRed positive CRISPR edited fly and sequencing PCR amplified regions across the editing site troubleshooting 4.\nKeep additional CRISPR positive flies as a backup.\nWeek 7. Identify flies that have undergone recombination (loss of DsRed expression) and carry the CyO, P[w+, Cre] expressing chromosome. Generate a homozygous stock by crossing the flies to each other (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], step 5).\nEnd of week 8. In flies emerging from the cross, selecting flies homozygous for the insertion will allow the loss of P[w+, Cre], located on the CyO balancer, from the genome. The homozygous flies allow the stock to be maintained and are ready to be used for live imaging experiments.",
    "Note: In the absence of selection, nos-Cas9 will be lost from the genome over time. Other lines with Cas9 linked to a fluorescent protein or white marker allow for it to be selected against in subsequent generations.\nNote: The one-step CRISPR approach will leave a loxP (34 bps) site and a few nucleotides (MCS) behind as a scar in the genome. The scarring can minimized by using restriction sites closest to the MS2 stem-loops/loxP in the pDsRed- 24MS2 plasmid.\nTwo-step CRISPR\nWeek 3. Cross all surviving flies to a white- fly stock (F0 generation) in individual crosses (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A, step 2).\nThe example in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A, step 2, shows a surviving female crossed to y1 w67c23 males [RRID:BDSC_6599].\nWeek 5. Identify F1 CRISPR edited flies by the presence of red eyes due to the mini-white marker gene (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A, step 3) (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]). Cross single transformants to a 2nd chromosome balancer fly line (for example y1 w67c23; snaSco/CyO (Ashe lab)) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A, step 4).\nSet up individual crosses with a number of potential CRISPR positives in case of off-target effects.\nAfter the cross has produced a sufficient amount of eggs and larvae are visible, verify correct genome integration by PCR and sequencing the targeted region in the adult fly troubleshooting 4.\nWeek 7. Select w+ CyO flies and cross them to each other to generate a stock that is homozygous for the attP insertion (lacking CyO) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A, step 5). Alternatively, this will allow maintenance of a balanced stock if the CRISPR edit causes lethality (see Note section below).\nWeeks 9–11. Amplify homozygous (or balanced where necessary) flies to obtain enough adults for a second round of microinjections.",
    "Note: attP containing flies will not be homozygous viable if the deleted genome region contains important regulatory elements such as promoters or enhancers. In this case the balanced stock can be used for injection of the reintegration plasmid.\nNote: The visible marker gene is not removed during this step, as the plasmid that will be used for reintegration through the attP site, contains a different marker. Both marker genes can be removed at the same time using Cre-recombinase after the reintegration step (Baena-Lopez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nϕC31 integrase-mediated site-specific transgenesis\nTiming: Cloning, 6 days; transgenesis, ∼8 weeks\nTwo-step CRISPR\nIn this step, site-directed reintegration utilizing the attB-attP system is used to insert MS2 stem-loops and the sequences that were removed in the first CRISPR step into the endogenous gene locus. To this end, the previously deleted genomic sequences are inserted into the RIVcherry+24xMS2-stem-loop plasmid (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A), upstream of the MS2 stem-loops. Other sequences can be introduced into the genome instead of the 24xMS2 stem-loops by using a similar approach.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/519-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Cloning strategy for the reintegration plasmid used for two-step CRISPR\n(A) The RIVcherry+24xMS2-stem-loop plasmid contains an attB site for ϕC31 integrase-mediated recombination and the MS2 stem-loops.\n(B) The plasmid is linearized using EcoRI and NotI restriction sites that are part of the 5′ MCS (1). The genomic region, removed in the first CRISPR step, is amplified from genomic DNA and digested with EcoRI and NotI (2) followed by ligation into the linearized vector (3). After successful insertion, the plasmid is purified for microinjection (4).\n(C) The reintegration plasmid also contains a pax-mCherry marker gene to identify positives.\nCloning\nTiming: 6 days",
    "Note: It is most time efficient to perform the molecular cloning to insert the genomic region into the reintegration plasmid concurrently with the fly crosses described above that generate the homozygous CRISPR edited flies carrying an attP site.\nNote: The 24xMS2 stem-loops were extracted from the pCR4-24xMS2SL-stable plasmid (Addgene, Cat# 31865) by BglII and BamHI digestion and inserted into the BglII restriction site of RIVcherry (DGRC, Cat# 1331) to generate the RIVcherry+24xMS2-stem-loop plasmid.\nDay 1. Digest the RIVcherry+24xMS2-stem-loop plasmid with EcoRI and NotI restriction enzymes (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B, step 1). Cloning steps are very similar to cloning the HA sequences (outlined in detail above, see steps 5–9), so are summarized in this section (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nPCR amplify the genomic region, which was removed during the first CRISPR step and sits inside of the HAs. This includes the cleavage site to PAM site sequence shown in black and orange, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B. Use primers designed in the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section that insert an EcoRI and NotI restriction site at either end of the insert (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9], step 2). Ligate the insert into the linearized plasmid (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B, step 3).\nDays 3–5. Confirm the insertion by diagnostic digests and sequencing.\nDay 6. Generate a maxiprep of the finished RIVcherry+24xMS2-stem-loop+genomic region plasmid (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C) for microinjection (Figure 9B, step 4) . Ensure the DNA is of high quality (see additional considerations in protocol step 4).\nAlternatives: The genomic DNA can be inserted downstream of the MS2 stem-loops using the 3′ MCS. If the MS2 stem-loops need to be placed within the genomic region that is reintegrated, two inserts can be generated and inserted upstream and downstream of the stem-loops respectively or alternative cloning strategies can be used.\nTransgenesis\nTiming: 8 weeks",
    "Week 1. Co-inject the RIVcherry+24xMS2-stem-loop+genomic region plasmid together with a ϕC31 integrase expression plasmid (act-phiC31-integrase, DGRC1368) into embryos from the homozygous attP CRISPR fly line amplified in step 21 (F0) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B, step 1). ϕC31 integrase-mediated site-specific transgenesis allows for the recombination of attB and attP sites. The reintegration forms attL and attR sites and inserts the target DNA (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, step 2).\nAlternatives: Instead of supplying a ϕC31 integrase plasmid, flies can first be crossed to a fly line that expresses ϕC31 integrase (for example RRID:BDSC_34771).\nWeek 3. Cross surviving F0 flies to 2nd chromosome balancer flies (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B, step 2).\nThe example in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B, step 2, shows a surviving female fly crossed to males of the y1 w67c23; snaSco/CyO genotype (Ashe lab) .\nIndividual crosses should be set up for a number of transformants in case of incorrect integration events.\nWeek 5. Select transformants based on pax promoter-driven mCherry fluorescence in the eyes of F1 flies (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B, step 3) (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nWeek 5. Remove the combined marker region, now containing 3 loxP sites, the mini-white marker and the mCherry marker by crossing F1 transformants to a Cre-recombinase expressing fly line (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B, step 4) (Baena-Lopez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nSelect an individual F1 female CyO fly that shows mCherry fluorescence and cross to males of the CyO, P[w+, Cre-] line BDSC_1092.\nAfter the cross has produced a sufficient amount of eggs and larvae are visible, sequence verify the correct integration of the MS2 stem-loops and associated sequences by sacrificing the adult transformant fly.\nWeek 7. To obtain flies ready for live imaging, the recombined flies (now lacking mCherry fluorescence) are crossed to each other to generate a homozygous stock.",
    "Cross females and males that carry the modified locus (are mCherry negative) and the CyO balancer (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B, step 5).\nEnd of week 8. In the F3 generation select against the CyO balancer and the white marker (P[w+, Cre]) to remove Cre from the genome. These flies are now homozygous for the genome modification, which allows for the stock to be maintained and it is ready to be used for live imaging experiments.\nNote: The two-step CRISPR approach will leave small scars in the genome in the form of the attR (attP/B) site at the 5′ end and one LoxP site (34 bps) at the 3′ end of the targeted locus. The plasmids used in this protocol contain minimal attP (50 bps) and attB (51 bps) sites (Baena-Lopez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) that were established by Huang et al., (2009)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23], reducing the attR sequence length contained in the final engineered fly line to 48 bps. The small attR size minimizes the amount of sequence to be added in addition to the MS2 stem-loop cassette, but adding additional sequences will be more problematic for other CRISPR applications that target the coding sequence. Additionally, a few nucleotides will have been inserted depending on the restriction sites that were used for cloning. Most of these additional nucleotides can be avoided by using In-Fusion or Gibson cloning or commercially synthesizing the plasmid."
