    "All the essential steps of the protocol are summarized in Figure 3. Prior to the start of the shaping procedures, rats are habituated to the experimenter and water deprivation is established.Water deprivation protocolDuring the experiments, and most critically during the shaping period, the animals have to be motivated enough to activate the drinking device. This requires a controlled reduction of their access to water in the animal housing facility. It must not be too severe to preserve the animal in a good physiological state, but sufficient enough to keep them motivated in a controlled and stable way. One week after their arrival in the animal facility, when the animals are habituated to their new housing environment, we quantify daily ad lib water consumption for each individual cage by measuring the bottle weight before and after drinking. Water restriction is introduced progressively one week later: during the first 2 d of deprivation, a drinking pipette is accessible in their home cage for 2 h in the morning (between 9 and 11 am) and in the evening (4 to 6 pm) respectively, then the access is reduced to 1h during the next 2 d and to 40 min during the following 7 d. All along this period, we control that the total amount of water consumed is close to the previous consumption during the ad lib period and consequently adjust the duration of the evening access. Additionally, the weight of the animals is periodically checked to ensure that it remains steady (±5%) across the entire protocol. During behavioral experiments, if rats are tested in the morning, they receive water for 20-40 min only in the evening, but if they are tested in the afternoon, they receive water during ~5 min in the morning and for 20-40 min in the evening.",
    "Moreover, evening access to water may be adjusted all along the experiments depending on the amount of water consumed by the animals in the experimental arena. Note: Within a 20 min period, rats are expected to perform at least 10 trials. For animals that do not perform the expected number of trials, and do not exhibit other signs than a lack of motivation, the access time to drinking water is reduced (e.g., from 40 to 20 min). Additionally, it is helpful to decrease the amount of drinking time on the day which precedes the first episode to increase the motivation of the rats and overcome stress which arises through exposure to a novel situation.Water consumption of the animals when water restriction has been established is estimated to around 20 ml/d. Upon water or sugar delivery, the rats make approximately 60 licks per trial, drinking 8 µl solution per lick, thus consuming around 10 ml in 20 trials. The time of free water access in the evening during the experimental period can therefore be adjusted in such a way that rats can consume at least 10-15 ml when the bottle is accessible for drinking. For the long-term test performed 24 days after the last episode presentation, water deprivation is interrupted at the end of the episode presentations and reinstalled one week prior to the test. It should also be slightly stricter than during exposure to the episodes, because by that time the rats spontaneously decrease their water consumption.ShapingNote: Because the time during which rats are exposed to the episodes is relatively limited, it is essential to minimize stress as much as possible in order to maximize behavioral exploration during episodes.",
    "Additionally, during shaping the protocol is adapted to each individual rat in order to start the episodic phase with a relatively homogenous group of rats in terms of their behavioral exploration. Habituation to the experimenterOne week after arrival of the rats the experimenter starts handling and playing with the rats for 5 min twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon), first in the animal facility and later in the experimental room, which continues for 2-3 weeks until the start of the experiment. Handling should also be done for one week before the long-term test to ensure that the rats get used again to the experimenter (this time only in the animal facility).Note: Preferably the same person should carry out the experiments, since it is an episodic memory task and the experimenters might be associated to the context of the episode by the animals. If several experimenters are doing the experiments, one should then pay attention that the same experimenter is performing the episode session and corresponding test (e.g., Episode E1 and Test in the context E1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160226/20160226044327_3144.jpgFigure 3. The different phases of the protocol. A. Shaping: Rats are submitted to 11 sessions (1 per day) to habituate them to the cage and the pipette operating system (a nose poke into any of the four odor ports triggers, after a delay, a pipette delivering water (Apparatus shaping, 7 d). During a second phase of shaping, rats are also habituated to receive odor stimulations associated with sugar or quinine from the pipettes (Odors shaping, 4 d). Once shaping is completed, rats undergo 3 routine sessions (R, 1 session a day) with no odor, no enriched context, and only water available from the 4 ports. B.",
    "Episodes exposure: During each of these sessions (1 per day) the animals are exposed to 2 distinct episodes [left, Episode 1 (E1) configuration; right, Episode 2 (E2) configuration] with a 1 d routine (R) session in between, or one day rest in home cages with maintained water deprivation. Episodes are presented once or twice in independent groups of rats. They were each characterized by a unique combination of odor-place-context associations rewarded with sugar solution (S): odor A at port 2 for E1; odor C at port 4 for E2, while the 3 other incorrect odor-place associations were associated with quinine solution (Q): odor B at port 2 and odors A and B at port 3 for E1; Odor D at port 4 and odors C and D at port 1 for E2. During episode exposures, in a given context (“in which context”), rats encoded at which port location (“where”), one of the odors (“what”) was associated with sugar solution. This configuration is referred to as P+O+. C and D. Episodic memory tests. During the retrieval test 24 h or 24 days after the last episode session, rats are placed again in one of the context (E2, in this case) to evaluate what type of information they are able to recollect. The 2-port test (C) completely matches the episode in terms of context, odors and locations, except that only water (W) is delivered whatever place-odor configuration is experienced. The challenging 4-port test (D) is a more complex situation since it takes place in the context of E2, but with 4 accessible ports [2 previously associated with context E2 (“In context”, IC, in pink) and 2 associated with context E1 (“out of context”, OC, in blue)]. Each port is associated with a pair of odors that correspond to their respective episode.",
    "Shaping consists of two phases completed in an average of 11 daily sessions lasting 20 min at maximum. During this period, the appearance of the cage is relatively neutral (see Figure 3A): The floor is black and smooth and no odors, sounds or visual stimulation are used. Phase 1 (apparatus shaping)The objective of this phase (5-7 d) is to teach the animal how to access water in the experimental environment. It includes several steps described in details below:Step 1: Rats housed in the same home cage are placed together into the experimental arena for 15 min with pipettes from all ports already introduced into the arena and ready to deliver water upon licking. This collective exploration period considerably reduces stress and facilitates the discovery of how to operate the drinking pipettes. This session is repeated the next day with the difference that rats are now placed into the experimental arena individually for 15 min. Once a rat licks from the pipette, we proceed to step B2, otherwise we repeat step B1.Step 2: At this stage, rats need to learn to trigger the introduction of the pipette into the cage by making a nose poke to the odor port. Odor ports are made as indentations into the walls of the cage, and the rats naturally come to explore them. At this stage the each pipette becomes accessible for drinking immediately after a nose-poke to the odor port and remains available for drinking for 20 sec. After this the pipette is automatically withdrawn from the cage and has to be triggered by the rat again after a refractory period (purge, duration: a few sec) which is set by the experimenter.Note: It is better to choose a short refractory period at the beginning of shaping procedures (e.g.",
    ", 5 sec) in order to accelerate learning of the link between the nose-poke and the pipette accessibility. For the same reason, it is important for the pipettes to be accessible for a sufficient amount of time (20 sec) to be discovered by the rats. Indeed during this period, rats usually do not wait at a particular port, but are moving around from port to port. Once they have understood how to trigger the pipettes, the amount of time during which the pipettes are accessible is reduced to 10 sec for the following session. If at this stage a rat still does not know how to trigger the pipette, this step can be repeated. This learning unit is acquired once rats perform 10-20 trials (pipette triggering) in 20 min.Step 3: A 3 sec offset between nose-poke and pipette entry into the cage is introduced at this stage to habituate the rats to wait for the pipette in front of the port. 10-20 trials should be initiated by the rats in a 20 min session.Any of the 3 steps can be repeated for individual rats depending on their performance.Phase 2 (odor shaping)The objective of this phase is to habituate the animals to receive odor stimulations after the nose poke and use it as an indication for the nature of the drinking solution that will be delivered a few seconds later. During this phase, two different odors are used: Eugenol and Geraniol. Hereby, geraniol is always associated with sugar solution, while eugenol is always announcing the distribution of a bitter quinine solution. For a given trial, the same odor-solution combination is delivered in the four ports present in the experimental arena. Each daily session consisted of 15 to a maximum of 24 trials initiated by the rats in 20 min.",
    "The session consists of a sequence of pseudo-randomly distributed geraniol and eugenol trials and is repeated on four consecutive days. The 3 sec delay between a nose-poke coupled with odor release and delivery of the pipette gives the animal some time to process the odor without being distracted by the pipette moving into the cage. Geraniol and eugenol are used uniquely in this shaping procedure.During this phase, the rats progressively learn that the odor coming from the odor port can be predictive of a positive or negative reward. As a consequence, their behavioral response is modified and they begin to avoid licking the quinine solution on the basis of eugenol cue. Depending on the rat, the odor shaping phase will take from 3 to a maximum of 4 d before such behavioral change is observed.Note: The first three trials of every shaping session are always positively reinforced in order to ensure that the animal receives sugar before quinine drinking solution and remains motivated throughout the session.Episodic taskRoutine (Figure 3A)Prior to exposure to the episodes, rats undergo routine sessions for 3 consecutive days, with one session per day (Figure 3A). Each session consists of 12-24 trials performed in the same condition as step 3 of phase 1 of shaping. Routine sessions are thus characterized by a contextual environment with which rats are already familiar from shaping procedures (smooth black floor, no specific acoustic and visual ambiance), without any odors being released from the odor ports and with water as the only drinking solution.",
    "The objectives of the routine sessions are: First, to verify that there is an even licking distribution among the ports without any preference for a particular place; second, to further monitor and adjust water deprivation (especially when there is a delay between the shaping and the experimental phase due to e.g., some surgical procedures); and finally, to increase the memorability of the following episodes, by contrasting them to accustomed and highly familiar routine sessions.Episodes (Figure 3B)Three essential characteristics distinguish episodes from routine sessions:The context: The simple black and smooth floor of the cage used during shaping and routine sessions is replaced by various materials specific to each episode. Distinct visual patterns are displayed on the floor of the arena by a projector to increase discrepancy between different episodes. Acoustic ambiance is enriched through the playing of natural sounds or music through the loudspeakers. For example, Episode 1 is characterized by a smooth white floor, projection of white triangles on a dark background and sounds of crickets. Episode 2 is characterized by a granular white floor, projection of white background with black circles and sounds of birds singing in the rain.Only two of the four ports of the cage can be activated by the rat in each episode, ports 2 and 3 for E1, and ports 4 and 1 for E2 (Figure 3). When a rat makes a nose poke to any of the two remaining non-active ports, nothing happens.On the active ports of a given episode two novel odors are delivered. For simplicity, odor A and B in Episode 1 and odors C and D in Episode 2. As a consequence, in each episode, four different combinations of odor-place can be encountered.",
    "Among these possibilities, only one odor-place combination is rewarded with sugar solution whereas the three others are associated with quinine. For example, in E1, sugar will be delivered when odor A is presented in port 2 (referred to as P+O+, positively reinforced place and odor). When odor B is presented on the same port, the animal will receive quinine (combination referred to as P+O-). The two other combinations involving port 3 will also lead to quinine: Odor A on port 3 is referred as P-O+ and odor B on the same port as P-O-.Each episode session consists of 12-24 trials and lasts 20-40 min. As during the routine session, the animal is free to explore the environment. Consequently, the number of trials can vary depending on the exploratory motivation of the rat. The odors are presented at the assigned ports in a pseudorandom sequence with three repetitions of the same odor-port configurations every 12 trials. Episode sessions are separated by either one routine session (R) or one day rest in home cages with maintained water deprivation. Depending on the experiments, each episode can be repeated once before the retention test, when more homogenous performance of the group is needed (e.g., when the effect of a drug is tested on episodic memory performance). To summarize: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160226/20160226044358_7328.jpgEpisode 1. Odor A (O+) is associated with a sugar drinking solution at port 2 (P+O+) and with quinine solution at port 3 (P-O+). Odor B (O-) is associated with quinine solution at port 2 (P+O-) and port 3 (P-O-).Episode 2. Odor C (O+) is associated with sugar drinking solution at port 4 (P+O+) and with quinine solution at port 1 (P-O+). Odor D (O-) is associated with quinine solution at port 4 (P+O-) and port 1 (P-O-).",
    "Memory recall test (Figure 3C or 2D)The test can be performed 24 h or 24 days after the last exposure to Episode 2 to probe recent or remote long-term memory, respectively. In both tests, quinine and sugar are replaced by water and performance of the rats is estimated by taking into account only the 12 first trials of the test. Two versions of the test that differ in their levels of difficulty can be carried out.2-Port Test: The test situation matches completely Episode 2 (Figure 3C). The same contextual environment as during the episode exposure is present. The same two ports are accessible and deliver the same two odors as during the corresponding episode (odors C and D, at ports 1 and 4).4-Port Test: The test takes place in the context corresponding to Episode 2 (same visual, auditory and tactile information), but this time all 4 ports are accessible for drinking, each delivering the same odors as during the corresponding episodes (Figure 3D). As during exposure to episode 2, ports 1 and 4 are releasing odors C and D and are therefore referred to as “In context” (IC) combinations, additionally ports 2 and 3 are releasing odors A and B, as during exposure to episode 1 and are referred to as “out of context” (OC) combinations.Note: One modification introduced to the original protocol is the removal of the routine sessions between the episodes. Instead of routine sessions the rats are kept in their home cages on the same water deprivation schedule as used before the shaping procedures (~30 min access to water in the morning and evening).",
    "We didn’t notice a difference in performance between the two protocols (with either a routine session between the episodes, or one day rest in the home cage with maintained water deprivation) and recommend therefore the simpler version of the protocol which doesn’t include routine sessions between the episodes. Note: The level of difficulty of both tests can be additionally adjusted by using more overlapping or distinct contextual features, such as e.g. the flooring material of the experimental cage, or the chemical proximity of the odors."
