    "Part I: Conventional method    Preparation of competent cells   10 μl of glycerol stock of the B. glumae strain is inoculated to 20 ml of LB medium in a 50 ml tube and further incubated at 28 °C for 16-40 h with horizontal shaking at 200 rpm until OD600 = 0.8 is achieved.   The lid of the tube is opened for 30 sec under a clean bench.   The tube is incubated again at 28 °C for 4 h with horizontal shaking at 200 rpm.   The tube is centrifuged twice at 800 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.   Each time the pellet is dissolved in 20 ml of autoclaved cold 10% glycerol.   The pellet is dissolved in 200 μl of cold 10% glycerol and divided into 50 μl aliquots and stored at -80 °C for a further transformation step.     Transformation   Remove from -80 °C tubes containing 50 μl of electro-competent B. glumae cells.   Thaw the cells on ice.   Add ~1 μg of pEDV5 based vector into the B. glumae cells. Incubate on ice up to 3 min.   Transfer the mixture of cells + DNA to a cold electroporation cuvette (0.2 cm electrode gap). Make sure the suspension is at the bottom of the cuvette.   Set the Gene Pulser apparatus at 25 μF the volt at 2.5 kV. Set the Pulse resistance controller to 200 ohms.   Place the cold cuvette in the chamber slide (Cuvette notch facing away from you).   Push the slide into the chamber until the cuvette is seated between the contacts in the base of the chamber.   Electroporate by pushing the red button.   Remove the cuvette from the chamber and immediately add 1 ml of LB medium to the cuvette and quickly resuspend the cells by pipetting.   Transfer the cell suspension from the cuvette to 1.",
    "5 ml tubes and incubate on shaker (200 rpm) at 28 °C for 2 h to allow recovery and expression of the gentamycin resistance marker (Clean cuvettes successively with dH2O, EtOH, sterile water, then wrap with aluminum foil then autoclave).   Pipette 200 μl of each transformation on KB agar plates containing 25 ng/ml gentamycin.   Spread the cells with cell spreaders. Place plates inverted at 28 °C for 2-3 days in the dark.        Part II. High competency method    Preparation of competent cells   A frozen glycerol stock of the B. glumae strain is picked with a toothpick and spread on a KB agar plate.Place plates inverted at 28 °C for 2-3 days in the dark.   Freshly grown B. glumae colony is inoculated to 5 ml of LB medium in a 15 ml tube and further incubated at 28 °C for 16 h with horizontal shaking at 200 rpm.   1 ml aliquots is centrifuged twice at 3,500 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.   Each time the pellet is dissolved in 1 ml of filter sterilized and room temperature 300 mM sucrose solution.   The pellet is dissolved in 200 μl of 300 mM sucrose solution and divided into 100 μl aliquots and used the cells immediately for a further transformation step.     Transformation   Add ~1 μg of pEDV5 based vector into the B. glumae cells.   Transfer the mixture of cells + DNA to an electroporation cuvette (0.1 cm electrode gap). Make sure the suspension is at the bottom of the cuvette.   Set the Gene Pulser apparatus at 25 μF the volt at 1.8 kV. Set the Pulse resistance controller to 200 ohms.   Place the cuvette in the chamber slide (Cuvette notch facing away from you).",
