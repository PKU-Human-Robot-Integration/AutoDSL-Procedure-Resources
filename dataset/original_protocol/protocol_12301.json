    "Experiments comply with National and European regulation on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and with internationally established principles of replacement, reduction and refinement.\n1. Flat-mounting of Xenopus laevis Tadpoles Anterior Neural Tube After Whole-mount In Situ Hybridization\nObtain X. laevis embryos according to standard procedures4 and age them until they reach neurula stage 26 and older (according to Nieuwkoop and Faber developmental table17.\nFix X. laevis tadpoles by incubating them in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Rock and rotate the embryos in a 2 ml glass vial , 1 to 1.5 hr at RT for stage 26 to stage 38 embryos, 2 hr at RT for embryos at later stages.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic by contact and a suspected carcinogen. It should be manipulated under a hood.\n\tNOTE: One X. laevis brood is usually fixed in a 2 ml glass vial but a larger glass vial can be used.\nWash the embryos in the same vial using 1x PBS with 0.1% Tween (PBT), 3 min at RT, twice.\n\tNOTE: Unless otherwise specify the PBS used is with or without calcium and magnesium.\nDehydrate the embryos in 100% methanol (MeOH) for at least 12 hr at RT in the same vial. Change the MeOH 100% at least twice under the hood using a plastic micropipette.\n\tNOTE: The MeOH turns slightly yellow as lipids dissolved in it. Caution the MeOH is toxic by inhalation and should be manipulated under a hood.\nRehydrate the embryos using the same vial through a graded series of MeOH baths: MeOH 75% in PBS, MeOH 50% in PBS, MeOH 25% in PBS, PBS twice, each bath 5-10 min at RT. The MeOH solutions are changed under the hood using a plastic micropipette.",
    "Using a plastic pipette, transfer the embryo to be dissected in a 60 mm Petri dish filled to the top with PBT. Using two fine forceps carefully remove the eyes by inserting one fine forceps between the eyes and the neural tube, at the level of the optic stalk. Detach the eyes from the neural tube. Carefully introduce the forceps below the ectoderm overlying the neural tube. With care, peel off the ectoderm starting from behind the head and discard it.\nPerform a double or single ISH using digoxigenin-labeled or fluorescein-labeled probes as previously described18,19.\nAfter the ISH transfer the embryos in a new 60 mm Petri dish filled to the top with PBT using a plastic pipette.\nUsing fine forceps carefully detach the neural tube from the rest of the embryo. At this stage, the anterior neural tube separates from the posterior neural tube. Carefully detach remaining parts of the ectoderm overlying the neural tube, the notochord that is loosely attached below the neural tube, the otic vesicles and remaining parts of the mesoderm. Ensure that the neural tube is devoid of any appendices at this stage.\n\tNOTE: To avoid damage to the neural tube perform all neural tube/embryo transfer with a plastic transfer pipette or a micropipette if necessary with a tip cut at its end. The diameter of the tip end is adjusted to the size of the neural tube.\nTransfer the dissected neural tube (see note step 1.9) in a 1.5 ml tube filled with 50% glycerol diluted in PBS. Wait until the neural tubes have fallen to the bottom of the glycerol solution, usually O/N at 4 °C.",
    "Remove the solution of 50% glycerol/PBS using a micropipette P1000 and add in the same 1.5 ml tube a solution of 90% glycerol/PBS using a micropipette P1000. Wait until the neural tubes fall to the bottom of the 90% glycerol/PBS solution, usually O/N at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: for long term storage, use 90% glycerol/PBS plus antibiotics to prevent bacterial development.\nTransfer the neural tubes on a glass plate, or a microscope slide with a plastic transfer pipette.\nDissect the neural tubes along the dorsal and ventral midlines using tungsten needles. During that step the neural tubes are kept in 90% glycerol/PBS.\nMount the two sides of the neural tube in 90% glycerol/PBS using reinforcement rings covered with a glass coverslip.\nFix the coverslips with varnish and keep at 4 °C.\n2. Animal Cap Explants Induction Using Anion Exchange Resin Beads\nTransfer 100 µl of anion exchange resin beads into a 2 ml tube using a micropipette P1000. Wash the beads at least five consecutive times with sterile distilled water. Allow the beads to sediment at the bottom of the tube and replace the sterile distilled water using a micropipette P1000. Do not touch the beads.\nLet the beads soak O/N in a 2 ml tube filled with sterile distilled water with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (10 mg/ ml) at 4 °C.\nTwo hr before collecting the ACs, place half of the beads into a new 1.5 ml tube using a micropipette P1000. Replace the sterile distilled water with 500 µl of the medium containing the molecule to be tested for its inductive potential, or known to induce a specific fate. Keep the other half of the beads, as they will be used as a negative control.\nIncubate the beads at 4 °C for at least 2 hr.",
    "Carry out all subsequent steps under the stereomicroscope and perform all AC transfer with a micropipette.\nTransfer blastula or very early gastrula embryos into PBS with calcium and magnesium complemented with 0.2% BSA using a plastic transfer pipette.\n\tNOTE: Embryos developing at 12 °C reach blastula and gastrula stages in 20 to 24 hr.\nRemove the embryo's vitelline membrane using forceps as previously described20. Fix the embryo with one forceps. Pinch the vitelline membrane with the side of the other forceps. Holding the membrane, slowly peel it off the embryo. Perform this procedure on the ventral (vegetal) side of the embryo. Do not damage the animal side of the embryo.\nIsolate small ACs as previously described21. The animal pole is the embryo's pigmented part. Using fine forceps cut out a small square of tissue out of the animal pole. The AC tissue contains only the ectodermal cells. Ensure that the tissue is of uniform thickness. If not, remove the AC from the analysis.\nPlace each AC in a Terasaki multiwell plates in 0.5x Modified Barth's Saline (MBS)4. Place the AC into the well with its pigmented animal side down, in contact with the round bottom of the well.\n\tNOTE: coating pipettes with a 0.1% BSA solution prevents the adhesion of small pieces of adhesive tissue to the plastic.\nPlace one bead on each cap using a micropipette P20. If needed, use forceps to carefully place the bead in the center of the cap.\n\tNOTE: When soaked in a conditioned medium, the beads are colored in pink. Select the most colored beads.\nIncubate at RT (18 to 22 °C) for 6 hr without moving the Terasaki multiwell plate. The bead sticks to the AC in less than 2 hr.",
    "Place the Terasaki multiwell plate on top of papers soaked in water. Cover the plate with a plastic container.\n\tNOTE: This 'humidity chamber' prevents premature evaporation of the wells.\nCulture the ACs in 0.5x MBS or 3/4 NAM (see step 4.1) in the humidity chamber at 15-20 °C until the sibling embryos have reached the correct stage to test the effect of your factor.\nFix the ACs for 1 hr in freshly prepared 4% PFA. Dehydrate the ACs in 100% MeOH as previously described (Step 1.4).\n3. Animal Cap Cell Dissociation and Reaggregation Before Grafting in a Xenopuslaevis Neurula\nCoat petri dishes (60 mm) or 12 wells plates with 3% agarose in sterile water or in PBS without calcium and magnesium. Add enough agarose to cover the bottom of the petri dish or the well. Pre-warm the plates at RT (18-22 °C). Optionally, stored the plates for couple of days at 4 °C to prevent dehydration.\nPrepare Calcium-free Holtfreter's saline (60 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM KCl, 4.6 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA (A-7888 Sigma pH 7.6)) and Holtfreter's saline (60 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM KCl, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 4.6 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA pH 7.6)5. NOTE: the solution of CaCl2 cannot be autoclaved.\nFill the agarose-coated well to the top with Calcium-free Holtfreter's saline.\nPrepare blastula or very early gastrula embryos to isolate their ACs as previously described (steps 2.5 to 2.7).\nIsolate at least 15 or up to 30, small ACs21. Using fine forceps cut out a small square of tissue out of the animal pole. The AC tissue only contains ectodermal cells and is therefore of uniform thickness. If not, remove the AC from the analysis.\n\tNOTE: The animal pole is the embryo's pigmented part.",
    "Transfer the ACs into an agarose-coated well filled to the top with Calcium-free Holtfreter's saline. Place the ACs with their pigmented side facing upwards.\n\tNOTE: The dissociation process starts rapidly in calcium-free Holtfreter's saline.\nWait a few minutes for cells to start dissociating. Observe this through disaggregation of the tissues. Using fine forceps, separate the pigmented layer from the rest of the AC and discard them with a micropipette P20. Complete cell dissociation process indicates separation of cells from one another.\n\tNOTE: One or two pigmented layers can be left within the re-aggregated explant to help visualization during grafting.\nCenter the cells using circular movements of the plate. Using a micropipette P1000 carefully remove as much medium as possible. Be careful not to touch the cells.\nAdd 1 ml of Holtfreter's saline with calcium to the well. Transfer the dissociated ACs into a 1.5 ml tube.\n\tNOTE: 2 ml tubes cannot be used due to their round bottom.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation, 5 min at a maximum speed of 2,000 rpm for a bench centrifuge (500 x g). Remove carefully the supernatant with a micropipette P1000.\nAdd to the dissociated cells 20 µl of Holtfreter's saline with calcium (60 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM KCl, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 4.6 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA (A-7888 Sigma pH 7.6)5.\nKeep the dissociated ACs, 3 to 6 hr at RT (18-22 °C).\n\tNOTE: This is necessary time for the cells to re-aggregate. The re-aggregation is visible as the cells form a small ball at the bottom of the tube.\nDetach the explant carefully from the bottom of the tube by adding 1 ml of 0.5x MBS or of 1 ml of 3/4 NAM (see step 4.1). Transfer the explant in an un-coated plate using a plastic transfer pipette.",
    "Stage the explants using their control siblings. For long-term culture use antibiotics: kanamycin (50 µg/ml), ampicillin (50 µg/ml) and gentamycine (50 µg/ml).\n4. Grafting of Animal Caps Explants in the Neural Plate of X. laevis Embryo\nPrepare 3/4 NAM (110 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM Ca(NO3)2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaHCO3, 0.2x PBS, 50 µg/ml gentamycin). Do not keep for more than 1 week for dissection and store at 4 °C. Older NAM can be used for preparing agarose-coated dissection dishes (below).\nCoat petri dishes (60 mm) with 3% agarose in 3/4 NAM into which small holes have been made using either a silicone mold, or the cover of a table tennis racket.\n\tNOTE: The agarose covers the bottom of the petri dish. Leave some space so that the petri dish to fill with 3/4 NAM. Alternatively make dissection dishes with non-drying modeling clay. Within the clay, squeeze the embryos slightly during the dissection procedure. Dig small holes in the agarose using rounded forceps This 'dissection dish' helps to hold the embryos during the dissection procedure.\nCollect dissection tools: plastic transfer pipettes, an 'eyebrow knife' (made with eyebrow hair embedded in paraffin at the tip of a glass Pasteur pipette)22, two fine dissection forceps, P1000 micropipette and tips, a stereosmicroscope with magnification 8-40X, a bright light source with optic fiber guides. Keep all the dissecting tools clean; after each experiment, rinse them twice with distilled water, once with 100% ethanol and let dry. Store away from dust and if necessary autoclave the metal dissecting tools.",
    "Let the dissociated and re-aggregated ACs (protocol 3), and their siblings X. laevis embryos develop until they reach stage 13 (neurula) according to Nieuwkoop and Faber developmental table17. For transplantation within the neural plate stage 13 to stage 15 embryos are used.\nCarry out all subsequent steps under the stereomicroscope.\nUsing a plastic transfer pipette, transfer the embryos into PBS with calcium and magnesium complemented with 0.2% BSA. Remove the embryo's vitelline membrane as previously described20. Fix the embryo with one forceps. Pinch the vitelline membrane with the side of the other forceps. Holding the membrane firmly, slowly peel it off the embryo.\n\tNOTE: Do this procedure on the ventral (vegetal) side of the embryo. Do not damage the embryos neural plate. If embryos have been damaged during the vitelline membrane removal step, transfer the embryos into a 60 mm petri dish containing 3/4 NAM using a plastic transfer pipette and wait 15 min, a sufficient time for the healing process to occur.\nFill in the dissection dish to the top with fresh 3/4 NAM.\nUsing a plastic transfer pipette, transfer the embryos without their vitelline membrane into the dissection dish. Place the embryos dorsal side up into the wells. During the transfer process do not allow the embryo to enter in contact with the air-liquid interface since X. laevis are lysed by surface tension.\nTransfer the AC explant to be grafted into the dissection plate using a plastic transfer pipette or a micropipette P1000. Once the pipette is inside the liquid, allow the explants to slowly sink down by gravity, or push very gently.\nMaintain the embryos with rounded forceps. With the eyebrow knife make an incision into the neural plate where you intend to graft your explant's piece.",
    "NOTE: At stage 14 the anterior bending of the neural plate can be use as a landmark, it marks the diencephalon territory (Figure 4).\nCut out a small piece of neuroepithelium, using rounded forceps and an eyebrow knive. Cut a small piece of the explant with the eyebrow knife.\n\tNOTE: The piece of explant should be about the same size and shape as the neuroepithelium ablated area.\nPlace the piece of explant into the neuroepithelium incision using the eyebrow knife and fine forceps. Ensure that the explant rapidly attaches to the embryo.\nAlternatively place a piece of glass coverslip onto the grafted embryo to maintain the graft in place. To do this, cut a fine glass coverslip into very small pieces using coarse forceps. Ensure that the size is approximately 1.5 mm2. Immerse the pieces into a Petri dish containing 3/4 NAM or PBS using forceps. Choose a piece of glass bigger than the embryo to avoid damaging it. The embryo will be a little bit flattened.\nWait for at least 30 min without moving, or only move the dissecting plate gently. Let the embryo recover for 30 min to 2 hr and gently remove the coverslip if necessary. Carefully pipette the grafted embryos into a clean dish filled with 3/4 NAM, using the plastic transfer pipette.\n\tNOTE: Grafted embryos tend to develop bacteria or fungi contamination. For long-term culture use antibiotics: kanamycin (50 µg/ml), ampicillin (50 µg/ml) and gentamycine (50 µg/ml).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
