    "The protocol is accompanied by example results based on applying the ISNAPDS system in analysis of actual population survey data in Mongolia. The procedures followed for collecting data in this survey were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Mongolian Ministry of Health Ethical Review Board and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Institutional Review Board (Protocol #21002). The eligible participants provided written informed consent to join the study and provide publishable data prior to enrolment and were free to withdraw from the study at any time.\n1. Specifying the method for populating food intake data\nIf food intake data are readily available in g/day, skip to step 2.\nIf food intake in g/day must be calculated based on intake frequencies and serving sizes, select cell B1 of the Food Intake Method spreadsheet and use the dropdown menu to specify whether each food is associated with a standard serving size (the default option) or whether serving sizes for each food vary between observations (variable serving sizes).\n\tNOTE: If food intake must be calculated but serving sizes are not readily available (e.g., in analysis of data collected using a nonquantitative food-frequency questionnaire), consider conducting a separate analysis of quantitative survey data to derive standard or variable serving sizes for different demographic strata15,16,17,18.\n2. Structuring and populating the input data spreadsheets using the pre-populated example data as a guide\nIn column A of the Food Composition spreadsheet, enter a list of all the unique foods reported to be consumed in the survey data (subsequently referred to as the food list). In the Food Intake sheet, enter the food list in row 1 and a list of all the unique observations in the survey data (subsequently referred to as the observation list) in column A.",
    "Ensure that the order and length of the food list in row 1 and the observation list in column A of any other sheet in which data is entered are consistent with the order and length of these lists in the Food Composition and Food Intake sheets.\nPopulate food intake in g/day by entering the necessary input data depending on the method specified in step 1.\n\t\nIf food intake data are readily available in g/day, populate the Food Intake sheet for all foods and observations in the data and skip to step 2.3.\nIf food intake must be calculated based on intake frequencies (expressed in servings/day) and either standard or variable serving sizes (in g/serving), in the Intake Frequencies sheet, enter the food list and the observation list and populate the sheet for all foods and observations in the data.\nIf calculating food intake using standard serving sizes, enter these data in column C of the Food Composition sheet. If using variable serving sizes, in the Variable Serving Sizes sheet, enter the food list and the observation list and populate the sheet for all foods and observations in the data.\nIf interested in calculating food group intakes or the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes, enter food groups in column B of the Food Composition sheet. In the Food Group Intake sheet, enter a list of all the unique food groups represented in the data (subsequently referred to as the food group list) in row 1 and the observation list in column A.",
    "Ensure that the length of the food group list and the name of each food group are consistent between column B of the Food Composition sheet and row 1 of the Food Group Intake sheet (and if calculating the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes, row 1 of the Nutrient Sources sheet). Food groups are not case-sensitive and may be entered in any order.\nIf interested in calculating nutrient intakes or the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes, in the Food Composition sheet, enter the list of all the nutrients to be analyzed in row 1 (subsequently referred to as the nutrient list) and populate the sheet with food composition data (expressed in unit/100 g). In the Nutrient Intake sheet, enter the nutrient list in row 1 and the observation list in column A. Summary guidance and online resources on how to identify, obtain, compile, match, and assess the quality of food composition data is provided in Supplemental File 3.",
    "NOTE: Despite its name, the nutrient list can include ingredients, foods, or food groups (e.g., Flour (g), Bread (g), or Refined grains (g)) and the data populated in the Food Composition sheet can therefore include ingredient, food, or food group concentrations (expressed in g/100 g) obtained from data on recipes or equivalency factors. This enables an additional or alternative approach for calculating food or food group intakes. When using this approach, foods or food groups are treated as if they were nutrients and their intakes are populated in the Nutrient Intake sheet. This approach provides a solution for situations in which there is a need to calculate intakes of specific ingredients or foods of interest (such as fortification vehicles) that are not included in the food list, or when analyzing data collected using a dish-based dietary assessment method and there is a need to assign food groups at the level of ingredients or foods. \n\t\nEnsure that the order and length of the nutrient list are consistent between row 1 of the Food Composition sheet and row 1 of the Nutrient Intake sheet (and if calculating the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes, row 1 of the Nutrient Sources sheet).\nIf interested in calculating the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes: in the Nutrient Sources spreadsheet, enter the nutrient list in row 1. In column A, enter the observation list # times by appending the list with copies of itself in a vertical fashion, where # is the number of food groups in the food group list. Populate every cell in column B with a different food group for each stack of observations.\n3. Modifying the pre-populated formulas in the output spreadsheets to match the structure of the input data",
    "If interested in calculating food group intakes or the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes: in the formula in cell B2 of the Food Group Intake spreadsheet, {=SUM(('Food Composition'!$B$2:$B$21=B$1)*TRANSPOSE('Food Intake'!$B2:$U2))}, change $B$21 to $B$#, where # is the bottom row of the data entered in the Food Composition spreadsheet and change $U2 to $*2, where * is the rightmost column of the data entered in the Food Intake sheet. Enter the modified formula.\nIf interested in calculating nutrient intakes or the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes: in the formula in cell B2 of the Nutrient Intake spreadsheet, {=SUM(('Food Intake'!$B2:$U2)*TRANSPOSE('Food Composition'!D$2:D$21))/100}, change $U2 to $#2, where # is the rightmost column of the data entered in the Food Intake spreadsheet and change $D$21 to $D$*, where * is the bottom row of the data entered in the Food Composition spreadsheet. Enter the modified formula.\nIf interested in calculating the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes: in the formula in cell C2 of the Nutrient Sources spreadsheet, {=SUM(INDEX('Food Intake'!$B$1$U$11,ROW()-ROUNDDOWN((ROW()-2)/(10),0)*(10),0)*(TRANSPOSE\n\t('Food Composition'!D$2:D$21*($B2='Food Composition'!$B$2:$B$21))))/100};, change $U$11 to $#11, where # is the rightmost column of the data entered in the Food Intake spreadsheet; change $D$21 and $B$21 to $D$* and $B$*, respectively, where * is the bottom row of the data entered in the Food Composition spreadsheet; and change both instances of (10) to (!), where ! is the length of the observation list. Enter the modified formula.\n\tNOTE: If using a software version prior to 2021, enter formulas as array formulas using CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER/RETURN (refer to Supplemental File 2 for guidance).\n4. Propagating the formulas within the output spreadsheets to populate the desired results",
    "If food intake must be calculated based on intake frequencies and either standard or variable serving sizes: in the Food Intake spreadsheet, select cell B2 and copy and paste or drag it rightward and downward until every observation in the data is populated with intake of every food in g/day.\nIf interested in calculating food group intakes or the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes: in the Food Group Intake spreadsheet, select cell B2 and copy and paste or drag it rightward and downward until every observation in the data is populated with intake of every food group in g/day.\nIf interested in calculating nutrient intakes or the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes: in the Nutrient Intake spreadsheet, select cell B2 and copy and paste or drag it rightward and downward until every observation in the data is populated with the intake of every nutrient group in units/day.\nIf interested in calculating the contribution of food groups to nutrient intakes: in the Nutrient Sources spreadsheet, select cell C2 and copy and paste or drag it rightward and downward until every observation in the data is populated with the contribution of every food group to every nutrient in units/day.\nSubscription Required.
