    "All animal-related experiments were conducted with approval from the Experiment Ethics Committee of Chongqing Institute of TCM. Twenty-four female Sprague Dawley rats (SD) that were 8-10 weeks old and weighed 200 g ± 20 g were used in this experiment.\n1. Preparation of the extraction\nCalculation\n\t\nPlan to administer the CR or CRV extract to a treatment group of six Sprague-Dawley rats (10 g/[kg∙day]) for 3 days. Use a CR or CRV extract concentration of 1 g/mL (1 mL of the extract is obtained from 1 g of herbs).\n\t\tNOTE: The dosage of CR is 6-10 g. In this study, the maximum dose of 10 g was used as the dosage. As the average weight of an adult person is 60 kg, the adult dose is 0.1667 g/kg. According to the weight conversion algorithm24, as the dose conversion coefficient between humans and rats is 6.3, the dosage for rats is 1.05 g/kg. The drug dosage was increased by 10 times to 10.5 g/kg for rats. The dosage was set as 10 g/kg for the convenience of calculation and the actual experiment. For example, by the calculation, if a total of 36 g of CR or CRV is needed, the Chinese herbal medicine should be prepared at least twice. Thus, 200 g of CR was required-100 g of CR was used as the CR, and 100 g of CR was processed into CRV.\nCalculate the volume of CR or CRV to be applied per rat using equation (1):\n\t\tV = 10 g/(kg∙day) × 200 g/(1 g/mL) = 2 mL   (1)\nProcessing of the CRV\n\t\nMix 100 g of CR and 20 g of vinegar (>5.5 g acetic acid/100 mL) thoroughly and incubate for 12 h.",
    "NOTE: To ensure that the interior of the CR was moistened by vinegar after 12 h, the CR and vinegar were mixed, stirred well, and then stirred again until the inner portion was moist.\nStir-fry the mixture in an iron pan for 10 min at 110-120 °C. Then, take out the mixture, and let it cool at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent the CR from scorching, it is necessary to stir continuously while heating. If the processed CRV is too wet, it can be dried at 60 °C. When the surface of the CR is sepia, the stir-frying can be stopped.\nExtraction\n\t\nCR extract\n\t\t\nAdd 10 times (the amount of CR) pure water to the CR, and soak for 2 h. Make sure that the medicinal materials are below the liquid level when soaking.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The CR only needs to be cut in half before extraction. The purpose of soaking is to extract the active constituents more effectively. The process of soaking is essential.\nBring the mixture of water and medicine to the boil over a high heat, and keep it boiling over a low heat for 20 min. Filter with a filter cloth (100 mesh), and collect the filtrate.\n\t\t\tNOTE: When decocting, a high heat was used before boiling, and a low heat was used to maintain the boiling.\nRepeat step 1.3.1.2 once, and combine the filtrates.\nConcentrate the extract with a rotary evaporator to 1 g/mL (based on the original medicine, the concentration temperature must be below 60 °C).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The active components in CR are volatile, so the concentration temperature should not be higher than 60 °C.\nCRV extract\n\t\t\nPerform the same steps (1.3.1.1-1.3.1.3) as for the CR extraction method.\nCR extract for testing",
    "Pipette 500 µL of the CR extract and 500 µL of methanol into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and vortex for 30 s to mix.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A mixture of methanol and water extracts the active components better. The extract should not be directly filtered for testing.\nCentrifuge each sample for 15 min at 1,6502 × g at 4 °C. Filter the supernatant, and then transfer it to the sample vial for testing.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After the high-speed centrifugation of the mixture of methanol and extract, the supernatant can be directly transferred to the sample bottle for determination without filtration. Due to the heat generated by the centrifugation process, it is preferable to use a cryogenic centrifuge.\nCRV extract for testing\n\t\t\nPerform steps 1.3.3.1-1.3.3.2 to prepare the CRV extract for testing.\n2. Animals\nCalculation\n\t\nTake 50 mg of estradiol benzoate, and add it to 50 mL of olive oil to prepare a 1 mg/mL solution. Take 50 mg of oxytocin, and add it to 50 mL of normal saline to prepare a 1 mg/mL solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The dose of the intraperitoneal injection of estradiol benzoate and oxytocin is 10 mg/(kg∙day). Estradiol benzoate is dissolved in olive oil, and oxytocin is dissolved in normal saline. Estradiol benzoate is not easy to dissolve in olive oil and can be treated with ultrasound to accelerate dissolution. Both the estradiol benzoate and oxytocin solutions must be prepared daily.\nCalculate the volume of estradiol benzoate solution to be applied per rat (i.e., V = 10 mg/[kg∙day] × 200 g/[1 g/mL] = 2 mL). Calculate the volume of oxytocin solution to be applied per rat (i.e., V = 10 mg/[kg∙day] × 200 g/[1 g/mL] = 2 mL).\nAnimal grouping and administration",
    "NOTE: Ten days were assigned for administration25,26. During treatment, the rats had unrestricted access to standard chow and water. Within 30 min of oxytocin administration, each rat's writhing activity was tracked. The PD rat model was developed successfully, as evidenced by the model rats' twisting responses, which included uterine contraction, one limb rotation, hind limb extension, a hollow trunk, and abdominal contraction26.\n\t\nAssign 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats (SD rats, 8-10 weeks of age, weighing 200 g ± 20 g) into four groups at random-control, model, CR, and CRV-and feed them for 7 days.\nAnimal administration\n\t\t\nIntraperitoneally inject rats in the model, CR, and CRV groups with 2 mL of estradiol benzoate solution every day. Intraperitoneally inject the rats in the control group with 2 mL of normal saline.\nFrom day 8, complete step 2.2.2.1. Then, administer intragastrically 2 mL of CRV extract to the rats in the CRV group, 2 mL of CR extract to the rats in the CR group, and 2 mL of normal saline to the rats in the control and model groups.\nOn day 10, complete step 2.2.2.2. Then, intraperitoneally inject the rats in the model, CR, and CRV groups with 2 mL of oxytocin solution and the rats in the control group with 2 mL of normal saline.\nRecord the writhing times of the rats within 30 min of the oxytocin injection.\nSample collection\n\t\nCollect abdominal aorta blood samples, excise the uterus rapidly and completely, and carefully separate the connective tissue and fat adhering to the uterine wall.\n\t\tNOTE: Blood was collected as close to within 1 h after the final dose.\nUse microcentrifuge tubes to preserve and transfer the uterine tissue to liquid nitrogen. Store the tissue samples at −80 °C.",
    "Centrifuge the blood samples for 10 min at 4,125 × g. Remove the serum-containing supernatant, and centrifuge at 16,502 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge the serum, and then keep it in the tube at −80 °C for storage.\n\t\tNOTE: The blood samples must be left at room temperature for 1 h for reprocessing.\nSample processing\n\t\nSerum samples\n\t\t\nPut 400 µL of methanol and 200 µL of serum into a microcentrifuge tube, and vortex for 30 s to mix. Centrifuge each sample for 15 min at 16,502 × g at 4 °C. Fill sample bottles with the supernatant after collection and filtration. Mix all the supernatants from each sample with the same volume to prepare quality control samples for testing.\nUterine tissue samples\n\t\t\nTake 100 mg of uterine tissue from the ipsilateral segment and grind it with a ninefold volume of normal saline. Centrifuge the homogenate for 10 min at 4,125 × g, and collect the supernatant. Place the supernatant in a refrigerator at 4 °C for testing or at −80 °C if not to be tested on the same day.\nPlace normal saline, tissue, and steel balls in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube, put the microcentrifuge tube into liquid nitrogen for 3-5 s, and then put the tissue into a tissue grinder for grinding.\nSample testing\n\t\nUse an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the PGF2α and PGE2 content in the uterine tissues of the rat samples.\n\t\tNOTE: The rat PGE2 ELISA kit was used to measure the PGE2 content, and the rat PGF2α ELISA kit was used to measure the PGF2α level. The detailed steps can be found in the manufacturer's instructions. The details of the kit are given in the Table of Materials.",
    "Assess the serum sample, the CR extract, and the CRV extract using UPLC-MS/MS.\n\t\t\nFor UPLC, use a C18 column (2.6 µm, 2.1 mm x 100 mm) and a binary gradient method with mobile phase A containing 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B containing acetonitrile. Set the elution gradient as follows: from 0 min to 1 min, 15% B; from 1 min to 8.5 min, 15% to 85% B; from 8.5 min to 11.5 min, 85% B; from 11.5 min to 11.6 min, 99% to 1% B; and from 11.6 min to 15 min, 15% B. Set the flow rate to 0.35 mL/min and the injection volume to 2 µL.\nFor MS, set the temperature to 600 °C, the curtain gas (CUR) flow rate to 0.17 MPa, and both the sheath and auxiliary gas flow rates to 0.38 MPa. Set the ion spray voltage of the positive ion mode and negative ion mode to 5.5 kV and −4.5 kV, respectively, the declustering potential (DP) voltage to 80 V or −80 V, the collision energy (CE) to 40 eV or −25 eV, and the collision energy superposition (CES) to 35 eV ± 15 eV.\nPerform the test following the manufacturer's protocol using UPLC-MS/MS. Perform MS for a mass range of 50-1,000 m/z.\nObtain the UPLC-MS/MS results using the matching workstation program in conjunction with the detection mode's information-dependent acquisition, multiple mass defect filter, and dynamic background deduction. Use the quality control samples of pooled serum to test the repeatability and stability of the UPLC-MS/MS equipment to verify the conventional approach. Before the research samples, inject the quality control samples for four successive runs, and then inject them after every five serum samples.\n3. Data processing\nData preparation",
    "Use conversion software to convert the raw data to the mzXML format. Normalize the total ion current (TIC) data of each sample.\n\t\tNOTE: An internal R-based application (www.lims2.com) built on XCMS was used to analyze the information for the integration, alignment, extraction, and peak detection27.\nPerform metabolite annotation using a proprietary MS2 database (www.lims2.com). Set the annotation threshold to 0.328.\n\t\tNOTE: The endogenous metabolites were identified in each group.\nPrincipal component analysis and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis\n\t\nUse analysis software to perform the principal component analysis (PCA) and the modeling. Import the standardized data of the metabolites to the analysis software. Then, use autofit to build the analysis model. Finally, use score to obtain the score scatter plot of the PCA.\n\t\tNOTE: The clustering of each group was obtained with the score scatter plot of the PCA. PCA is an unsupervised analysis mode that mainly groups the samples through dimension reduction without intervention.\nUse the analysis software to perform the orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).\n\t\t\nImport the standardized data on the metabolites in the CR and CRV groups into the analysis software.\nImport the data from the CR group into the created CR group, and import the data from the CRV group into the created CRV group.\n\t\t\tNOTE: OPLS-DA is a supervised analysis mode, and grouping of the samples is necessary.\nThen, use autofit to build the analysis model, and use score to obtain the score scatter plot of the OPLS-DA. Finally, use VIP to obtain the variable significance in the projection (VIP) value in the OPLS-DA.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The variable significance in the projection (VIP) values of the metabolites in the CR and CRV groups were obtained through the OPLS-DA.\nIdentification of the potential differential metabolites",
    "Screen out the metabolites with VIP values greater than 1 in step 3.2.2.3.\nUse statistical software to calculate the P value of the metabolites that were screened out in step 3.3.1 by the Student's t-test.\n\t\tNOTE: Significant differences in the potential differential metabolites in the CR and CRV groups were determined by a Student's t-test. The potential differential metabolites were those with a Student's t-test p-value < 0.05 and a variable significance in the projection (VIP) greater than 1. The representation was accomplished using a volcanic plot.\nIdentification of the differential metabolites\n\t\nScreen out the potential differential metabolites in step 3.3. Use the results of step 3.1.2 to identify these differential metabolites.\n\t\tNOTE: A small number of potential differential metabolites were identified, and they became the candidate differential metabolites.\nScreen out the differential metabolites to be matched in the KEGG database. Show the changes in the differential metabolites in the CR and CRV groups by drawing a heatmap.\n\t\tNOTE: A small number of candidate differential metabolites were matched, and they became the differential metabolites.\nExamination of the potential metabolic pathways\n\t\nUpload the different metabolites to the Metaboanalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca) database.\nUse Pathways Analysis to obtain the potential metabolic pathways.\n\t\tNOTE: The potential metabolic pathways were obtained in the CR and CRV groups. The P value and impact value were two very important indicators in the selection of the critical pathways. The P value was more important than the impact value. Significance was defined by a P value < 0.05; bigger impact values were associated with better correlations.\nAnalyze the potential metabolic pathways by uploading the different metabolites to the KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html) database.\n\t\tNOTE: The relationship between the function of the metabolic pathway and PD should also be considered. The critical metabolic pathways were obtained.",
    "Identification of the constituents absorbed into the blood\n\t\nIdentify the chemical constituents in the CR and CRV extracts using the in-house MS2 database (www.lims2.com), the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), and the Massbank and Chemspider databases.\nDetermine the constituents absorbed into the blood in the CR and CRV groups, and compare the constituents between the CR and CRV groups.\n\t\tNOTE: The constituents absorbed into the blood must be detected in the CR or CRV groups but cannot be detected in the control group.\nStatistical analysis\n\t\nAnalyze the data using univariate analysis (UVA) and multivariate statistical methods, including the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Student's t-test.\n\t\tNOTE: The experimental information was presented using statistical software as mean ± standard deviation (±SD). P < 0.01 was considered a highly significant difference, and P < 0.05 represented a significant difference28.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
