Four cancer cell lines were selectively cultured as monolayers (A), detached from tissue culture flasks, and seeded into ultralow attachment 96-well microplates to form spheroids (B). A549 lung carcinoma, HepG2/C3A liver carcinoma, SK-OV-3 ovarian adenocarcinoma, and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were seeded at 1 × 103-8 × 103 cells/well and grown up to 7 days to form single spheroids and optimize spheroid seeding density and cultivation time by continuous observation and planimetric measurements. Once formed, single spheroids were washed into a serum-free XF medium and carefully seeded into spheroid assay microplates, precoated with poly-D-lysine (C). Spheroids were subjected to extracellular flux analysis using the XFe96 analyzer using several protocols to address: (1) optimal spheroid size for basal mitochondrial respiration response; (2) optimized titration of mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors; (3) optimization of spheroid placement within microplate wells. (D) Post XF analyses, phase contrast microscopy, and spheroid DNA quantification were used for data normalization and other downstream in vitro assays.

Culture the cell lines to 65-80% confluency and passage them regularly up to a maximum of 25 passages.\nRinse the cell culture flasks twice in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (DBPS).\nDetach the cells from the flasks with 3 mL of the cell dissociation reagent (see the Table of Materials) for 5 min at 37 °C and confirm the detachment by microscopy.",
    "Aspirate the detached cell suspension gently to ensure a single-cell suspension and deactivate the cell dissociation reagent with 7 mL of complete tissue culture medium.\nCollect the cells by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in complete medium.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter and titrate to the desired cell density required for seeding.\n\tNOTE: To seed an entire 96-well plate at 100 µL/well at 4 × 103 cells/well, cells should be titrated to 4 × 104 cells/mL in a recommended volume of 12 mL.\nDecant the cell suspension into a sterile reservoir and dispense 100 µL of the cell suspension into each well of a cell-repellent microplate using a multichannel pipettor.\n\tNOTE: Only the inner 60 wells of a microplate should be seeded and the remainder filled with DPBS. This will form an evaporation barrier, ensure spheroid homogeneity across the plate, and minimize plate edge effects.\nCentrifuge spheroid microplates at 300 × g for 15 min to force the cells into loose aggregates.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for a minimum of 3 days to ensure spheroid formation.\nPerform phase-contrast microscopy using standardized laboratory practices to monitor the growth of spheroids. Replenish the cell culture medium every 3 days or twice weekly by performing a half-volume medium exchange.\n2. Probing mitochondrial energy metabolism of single spheroids using Extracellular Flux (XF) Technology\nAssay preparation (one day prior)\n\t\nCheck spheroid viability using an inverted light microscope with phase contrast at 4x magnification to ensure intact spheroid structure, morphology, and overall uniformity between samples.\nHydrate the sensor cartridge.\n\t\t\nAliquot ~20 mL of the calibrant into a conical tube.\nPlace the conical tube containing the calibrant in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator overnight.",
    "Remove the contents from the assay kit.\nRemove the sensor cartridge from the utility plate and place it upside down on the worktop next to the utility plate.\nPipette 200 µL of sterile ddH2O into each well of the sensor cartridge utility plate using a multichannel P300 pipette.\nPlace the sensor cartridge on top of the utility plate.\nCheck that the water level in each well is high enough to submerge the sensor probes.\nTransfer the assembled sensor cartridge to a non-CO2 37 °C incubator and leave it overnight.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step can be performed 12-72 h prior to assay commencement.\nCoat spheroid assay microplate\n\t\nUsing aseptic techniques, add 30 µL/well of sterile Poly-D-Lysine (0.1 mg/mL) solution to the spheroid microplate and incubate it for 30 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the solution from each well of the spheroid microplate, invert the plate, and tap it firmly onto tissue paper to remove any residual solution.\nWash the plate twice with 200 µL/well of sterile ddH2O.\nAfter the final wash, invert the microplate and tap it firmly onto tissue paper to remove any residual water.\nAllow the plate to air-dry for 30 min before using or storing it at 4 °C for future use.\n\t\tNOTE: The spheroid assay microplate should be coated with a molecular adhesive to ensure that the spheroids are fixed at the bottom of the microplate. Without a molecular adhesive, spheroids can become dislodged and interfere with assay results. Other molecular adhesives can also be used as an alternative to Poly-D-Lysine for precoating plates. Precoated plates can be stored at 4 °C but should be left to equilibrate to room temperature before assay commencement.\nPrepare XF Assay medium\n\t\nPrepare XF RPMI medium, as detailed in Table 1, and sterile-filter with a 0.22 μm syringe filter",
    "Assay preparation (1 h prior to assay)\n\t\nPrewarm the supplemented XF RPMI assay medium to 37 °C.\nPrewarm the coated spheroid assay microplate in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator or dry bath.\nPrepare the sensor cartridge.\n\t\t\nTake out the conical tube containing the calibrant and the sensor cartridge from the air incubator.\nRemove the sensor cartridge from the utility plate and place it upside down on the work surface.\nUsing a P300 multichannel pipette, aspirate the water from the utility plate and discard it.\nPour the calibrant solution into a sterile reagent reservoir and add 200 µL/well of the prewarmed calibrant to the utility plate using a P300 multichannel pipette.\nPick up the sensor cartridge and place it back on top of the utility plate, ensuring the sensors are well submerged in the calibrant.\nTransfer the assembled sensor cartridge back into the non-CO2 37 °C incubator until ready to load the port injection solutions.\nWash the spheroids with the assay medium.\n\t\nRemove the spheroid culture plate from the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and observe the spheroids under the microscope to ensure their integrity prior to the spheroid transfer steps.\nLoad all wells of the spheroid plate with 180 µL/well of prewarmed assay medium, including any background correction wells.\nPartially fill a 7 cm Petri dish with 3 mL of the assay medium.\nUsing a multichannel pipette loaded with wide orifice pipette tips, transfer the spheroids from the 96-well culture plate into 7 cm Petri dishes by setting the pipettor at an aspiration volume of 10-50 µL.\nSeed spheroids into the pre-coated spheroid assay microplate.\n\t\nUsing a dissection microscope and a lightbox apparatus, transfer the spheroids from the Petri dish to the spheroid assay microplate as detailed below.",
    "Set the volume of a single-channel pipettor fitted with a wide orifice pipette tip to 20 µL and carefully aspirate a single spheroid. Place the tip directly in the center of each well of the spheroid assay microplate and allow gravity to elute a single spheroid into the center of each well, i.e., do not expel any medium from the pipette tip and allow capillary action to withdraw the spheroid from the pipette tip. To confirm elution, the contents of the pipettor can be pipetted back into the 7 cm Petri dish under the microscope.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Gravity elution of a single spheroid typically takes 15-30 s depending on spheroid size/density. During this time, the pipettor should not be removed. Any background correction wells should be free of spheroids and only contain assay medium. Under the microscope, confirm the position of each spheroid. Each spheroid should ideally be positioned within the center of each well.\nOnce all the spheroids have been transferred to the spheroid assay microplate, transfer the plate to a non-CO2 incubator at 37 °C for a minimum of 1 h prior to the assay.\n3.

    "If using a loading guide, place it atop the cartridge plate according to the well-loading procedure, e.g., if port A is be loaded first, ensure that A is visible in the upper-left corner of the guide.\nTransfer the working solution of each compound into a suitable reservoir and, using a calibrated P100 multichannel pipette, dispense 20 µL into all corresponding ports. Repeat for each compound into the remaining ports.\n\tNOTE: If any ports are not used on the sensor cartridge plate, these can be left empty or filled with assay medium. If only a selection of a specific port letter is being used, ensure that the other ports corresponding to that letter are loaded with assay medium; otherwise, air will be injected into the well, compromising the results in those wells.\nAfter port loading, remove the plate-loading guides (if used) and prepare the analyzer for loading the sensor cartridge.\n\tNOTE: If the assay is not being run immediately after loading the ports, place the lid back on the sensor cartridge and put the plate back in the 37 °C air incubator until ready to load into the machine.\n4. Assay design, injection strategies, and data acquisition\nRunning the assay\n\t\nPower on the analyzer and connect to controller (computer).\n\t\tNOTE: This can be verified by the instrument connection status in the widget panel of the Wave Controller software.\nNavigate to the templates page in the WAVE software, find the assay template file for the experiment and double-click to open it.\n\t\tNOTE: If the assay template does not appear on the Templates view, import the template file into the template folder from a shared network drive or USB flash drive.\nTo start the assay, click the Run Assay tab.",
    "NOTE: If the group definitions have been correctly allocated within the plate map, the assay will be ready to run as indicated by the green tick on the right-hand side of the page. At this stage, any additional information can be input on the assay summary page or the page left blank; proceed to the next step.

    "Enter the save location for the result file, and place the assembled sensor cartridge onto the thermal tray that appears from the door on the side of the analyzer. Wait for the thermal tray to open automatically and the screen to display the Load Calibrant Utility Plate message. Before following the on-screen prompts, ensure i) proper fit of the sensor cartridge on the Utility plate, ii) the lid is removed from the sensor cartridge, and iii) correct orientation of the sensor cartridge on the utility plate.\nFollow the on-screen commands to initiate sensor cartridge calibration.\n\tNOTE: The time taken to complete calibration is approximately 10-20 min (for assays at 37 °C).\nAfter sensor cartridge calibration, load the spheroid microplate into the analyzer by following the on-screen instructions on the Wave Controller to initiate the 12 min equilibration step.\n\tNOTE: Green boxes with white ticks indicate a 'good' calibration for that well. If any wells fail to provide a 'good' calibration, they will be indicated with a red box and white cross. Such wells should be noted and excluded from any analysis after the assay is completed using the modification assay tab.\nWait for the analyzer to automatically begin acquiring baseline measurements after the machine has completed the equilibration step (as outlined in the instrument protocol).\nTo complete the experiment, follow the on-screen commands on the WAVE controller.\n\tNOTE: Once the spheroid microplate has been removed from the analyzer, discard the sensor cartridge and set aside the spheroid plate for further analysis if necessary (e.g., double-stranded (ds) DNA quantification). If the microplate is not required for further analysis, it can be discarded along with the sensor cartridge.\nWait for the assay dialog to appear and view the results or return to the templates view.",
    "5. Data normalization and analysis strategies - post assay normalization and downstream assays (optional steps)\nData normalization\n\t\nTo normalize spheroid data, refer to the series of protocols pertinent to data normalization strategies for calculating spheroid size and volume and quantifying dsDNA in spheroid assays. These have been included as supplemental files; see Supplemental file 1 and Supplemental file 2.\nData analysis\n\t\nTo export data into one of the automated analysis generators, follow the data export commands on the WAVE controller and select the export generator that matches the assay type. Alternatively, export the data file and upload it into Seahorse analytics.\n\t\tNOTE: The downside of report generators and Seahorse analytics is that data analysis is limited to how the XF assay is designed and does not allow for averages to be taken across measurement cycles. Manual export of datasets from the instrument software allows for user preference in this regard. Given that the injection strategy for assessing mitochondrial respiration of 3D spheroids will likely differ from that of a typical 'MitoStress' test, a series of spreadsheet templates have been developed to help analyze these datasets, specific to 3D cell cultures and will be provided upon request. These data template files will provide data on the key mitochondrial respiratory parameters detailed and explained in Figure 2.\nTo analyze the data, export the data as a spreadsheet report from the WAVE controller software and use an independent spreadsheet template for analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63346/63346fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic descriptors for parameters derived from extracellular flux data analyses.
