    "Gene cloningUse three-restriction digestion enzyme system BamHI-POI-BglII-stop codon-KpnI for connecting the gene of different protein fragments. In this enzyme system use BglII and KpnI digest to produce vector and use BamHI and KpnI digest to produce the insert. As BamHI digestion and BglII digestion leads to the same cohesive end (GATC), it is possible to use T4 ligase connect the vector and the insert.Confirm all genes by sequencing.Expression and production of interest proteinsNote: In the experimental operation, always pay attention to the aseptic operation. Different proteins have different E. coli harvest shelf life. It is necessary to test the shelf life for the specific protein. Transform the pQE80L-POI or pET28a-POI plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3) cell.Apply the bacterial solution to the LB plate containing ampicillin sodium salt (100 μg/ml) for pQE80L plasmid or kanamycin (50 μg/ml) for pET28a plasmid and incubate at 37 °C for 14-16 h.Pick single colonies into 15 ml LB medium containing ampicillin sodium salt (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Keep shaking at 200 rpm at 37 °C for 16-20 h.After grown saturation, dilute the overnight cultures into 800 ml fresh LB media (add to the LB medium in a ratio of 1:50) containing respective antibiotics (the concentration of antibiotics is the same as above). As for the metalloprotein, centrifuged the culture at 1,800 x g and resuspended the precipitation by 16 ml M9 medium, and then add to 800 ml respective antibiotics containing M9 medium as well.Shake culture at 200 rpm at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reaches 0.6-0.8 (this takes about 2.5-3 h, while M9 medium always takes about 5-6 h). Reserve a 100-μl sample of the culture as the pre-induction control for testing protein expression.",
    "Add IPTG (Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce protein expression, while metalloprotein always needs some additional metal ion, and shake the culture at 200 rpm at 37 °C for 4-6 h.Harvest the culture at 13,000 x g for 25 min at 4 °C and store at -80 °C before purification.Purification of interest proteinsResuspend the cells in 25 ml lysis buffer (contained 0.06 mg DNase, 0.06 mg RNase, 0.08 mg PMSF) and produce the lysis using a Biosafer sonicator (15% amplitude) on ice for 30 min. Clarify the cell lysate at 19,600 x g for 40 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant fraction.Pack a Poly-Prep column with 1-1.5 ml (bed volume) of Co-NTA or Ni-NTA affinity column and wash it with ten column volumes (CV) of Milli-Q water and then 10 CVs wash buffer (by gravity flow).Load the supernatant onto the column by gravity flow and collect the flow-through. Load the flow-through onto the column by gravity and collect the secondary flow-through. Load the secondary flow-through onto the column by gravity and finish the sample loading.Wash the column with 50 CVs of wash buffer.Elute the bound protein with 3 CVs of elution buffer at 4 °C for 15 min. Moreover, carry out anion exchange purification for pure metal form rubredoxin protein using AKTA with Mono Q column at pH 8.5 at 4 °C.Analyze the samples of the eluate and control group by SDS-PAGE.",
    "Use the Ellman method to confirm the concentration of ELPs, in which 10 μl protein incubated with 20 μl DTNB solution for 30 min at room temperature and the solution composited with 10 μl the elution buffer solution and 20 μl DTNB solution served as blank to detect the absorbance of protein and DTNB reaction solution at 412 nm (ε = 13,700 M−1 cm−1) by NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer.Functionalized coverslip surface preparationNote: The functionalized coverslip should be immediately used or stored at 4 °C for a month after preparation. Clean and activate glass coverslips by immersing in chromic acid at 80 °C for 30 min. Wash away chromic acid traces on the coverslips by water and then ethyl alcohol. Dry the coverslips by a stream of nitrogen.Aminosilylate the coverslips by immersing them in 1% (v/v) APTES toluene solution for 1 h at room temperature avoiding light.Wash the coverslips with toluene and absolute ethyl alcohol and dry the coverslips with nitrogen.Bake the coverslips at 80 °C for 15 min.Add 200 μl sulfo-SMCC (1 mg/ml) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution between two immobilized coverslips after the coverslips cooling down to room temperature and incubate for 1 h protected from light at room temperature.Wash every piece of the coverslips with 15 ml DMSO first and then with absolute ethyl alcohol to remove residual sulfo-SMCC. Use a stream of nitrogen to dry the coverslips.Stick cleaned quartz ring on the functioned side of the coverslip to build a chamber.Pipet 200 μl of 200 μM GL-ELP50nm-C protein solution onto the functionalized coverslip in the chamber and incubate for approximately 3 h.Wash the chamber with Milli-Q water to remove the unreacted GL-ELP50nm-C.Functionalized cantilevers surface preparationNote: Silicon nitride cantilever was used as a force probe. The surface chemistry of the cantilevers was similar to that of the coverslip.",
    "Immerse the cantilevers at 80 °C for 10 min by chromic acid treatment. Remove the traces of chromic acid by water first and then ethyl alcohol. Use a piece of filter paper blot ethyl alcohol traces up.Functionalize the cleaned cantilevers by amino-silanization with APTES and then conjugate the cantilevers to sulfo-SMCC as the method mentioned in Section D, Functionalized coverslip surface preparation.Immerse the functionalized cantilever with Cys-ELP50nm-NGL at the concentration of 200 μM to the surface with maleimide group of sulfo-SMCC for 1.5 h.Wash the coverslip with Milli-Q water to remove the unreacted Cys-ELP50nm-NGL and store the cantilever at -20 °C.Before the AFM experiment, immerse a ELP-functionalized cantilever in 50 μM GL-CBM-XDoc protein solution with 200 nM OaAEP1 for 20-30 min at 25 °C, and then wash away the unreacted proteins by 15-20 ml AMF buffer.Stepwise polyprotein preparation with controlled sequencesNote: Use 15-20 ml AFM buffer to wash away residual proteins after each reaction step. Figure 1 presents the schematic diagram of the controlled sequence polyprotein preparation. Mix unit Coh-tev-L-POI-NGL(50 μM) and OaAEP1 (200 nM) and add 60 μl to the functionaliazed coverslip. link the ligation unit Coh-tev-L-POI-NGL to the functionalized coverslip.Add 100 μl TEV protease solution to cleave the TEV site in the protein unit for about 1 h at 25  °C. And GL-Ub-NGL-glass will produce with exposed N-terminal GL residues.Repeat Steps F1-F2 (N-1) times to get the protein-polymer GL-(Ub)N-NGL-Glass. After OaAEP ligation of the final ligation unit, do not take the TEV cleavage reaction to obtain Coh-tev-L-(Ub)n-NGL-Glass.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200414/20200414025729_6411.jpgFigure 1. The schematic displays the stepwise ligation and cleavage procedure to produce sequence-controlled polyprotein on the glass surface and probed with an XDoc-protein maker-modified cantileverAFM measurementsNote: The AFM experiment parameters (Z length, Z speed, setpoint, sample rate and duration time) are adjustable in different experiments.",
    "Add 1 ml AFM buffer containing10 mM CaCl2 to the chamber (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200414/20200414025747_3732.jpgFigure 2. A photo image about AFM chamber with 1 ml AFM buffer solution. The black ring shows the position of the polyprotein.Move the laser to the D tip of the functionalized probe (Figure 3). Use the equipartition theorem to calibrate the spring constant (κ) of each cantilever in solution with an accurate value before the experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200414/20200414025805_1566.jpgFigure 3. CCD picture of the cantilever tip in the AFM experiment. The triangle which the red ring located is D tip. The red ring points out the lase radiation position on D tip.The cantilever tip attached to the sample surface and hold at this position for a while to formed the cohesin/dockerin pair as shown in Figure 4, segment 0 and segment 1.Retracted the cantilever from the surface at a constant velocity of 400 nm s−1 while recording the distance and cantilever deflection at a sampling rate of 4,096 Hz. As shown in Figure 4, segment 2.Hold the cantilever for a while to relax the cohesin/dockerin pair as shown in Figure 4, segment 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200414/20200414025821_4369.jpgFigure 4. The dialog about the AFM experiment parameter setting. One AFM measurement contain four step. Segment 0 makes cantilever move towards the sample surface. Segment 1 keep the cantilever staying at the height reached by segment 0 for duration time. Segment 2 retract the cantilever from the surface and the protein unfold during this period. Segment 3 keep the cantilever at the height reached by segment 2 for duration time."
