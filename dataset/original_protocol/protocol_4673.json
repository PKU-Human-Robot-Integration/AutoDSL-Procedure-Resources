    "Preparation of RNA/morpholinosPerform the in vitro RNA transcription of sequence of your interest (your RNA, or morpholino oligo for blocking selected specific RNA targets) using mMESSAGE mMACHINE Kit and add poly(A) tail with Poly(A) Tailing Kit.Purify the RNA sample by RNeasy Mini Kit.Measure RNA concentration by NanoDrop.Store the RNA in -80 °C before usage. Prepare working solution with a 20-50 ng/µl concentration of RNA or 1-10 µM concentration of morpholino. Dilute in RNase free water. Important: Centrifuge for 5 min/17,000 x g and use supernatant only to get rid of particles which then might seal the tip of micropipette. Keep working solution on ice.Micropipette preparationSet parameters on micropipette puller: heat 300, pull 80, velocity 70, time 150.Fix the capillary into the groove, pull firmly the holder, close the cover and press PULL. Thus you get the capillary with thin end suitable for microinjection (see Video 1). Then fix the capillary into the manipulator MF-79. Magnify and focus the end of the capillary and close it to the hot fiber which bends the capillary into the proper angle, approximately 30 degrees (see Video 1).Fill the prepared injection capillary with working solution (approx 1.5 µl) using microloader tip.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Micropipette preparation Oocyte isolation and cultivationObtain mouse ovaries from laboratory mice (Mus musculus, CD1) at least 6 weeks old (from 6 to 10 weeks old), which were stimulated by Folligon (PMSG; 5 IU per one mouse) 46 h before collection to get oocytes in the stage of germinal vesicle (GV stage). For zygotes, administer hCG (5 IU per one mouse) 48 h after PMSG and mate stimulated females with males. Isolate zygotes 17 h after mating.Euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation.",
    "Cervical dislocation is the recommended method of mice euthanasia due to its speed and reliability (of course after the acquisition of proper technique). Moreover any chemicals that could potentially affect the experiment are not added.Remove the ovaries and clean them from the fat tissue.Isolate oocytes immediately after collection ovaries using two needles: disrupt the follicles in transfer medium (TM) supplemented with IBMX (100 µM) (see Video 2). Transfer isolated oocytes into the cultivation dish with M16 medium with IBMX (100 µM) and incubate at 37.5 °C, 5% CO2. The dishes with medium have to be equilibrated before for at least 2 h in 37.5 °C, 5% CO2. After 15 min in the incubator, denude the oocytes by gentle pipetting (suction and discharge several times) the medium in the well. The pipetting will mechanically remove cumulus cells from the oocyte. Then let the oocytes in the incubator for other 15 min.Then select the best oocytes visually (rounded, nucleolus in the middle, fully grown oocytes ~ 70 µm in diameter; Figure 1). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.

Scale bar 40 µmMicroinjectionTurn on the microscope, microinjector, joystick and the gas (pressure up to 500 kPa). Set the injection pressure: FILL 0.1 psi, INJ 10.1 psi, BAL 2.9 psi, HOLD 14.5 psi.Put the holding capillary and the loaded injection capillary to the relevant holders and close them slowly to the petri dish with a drop of TM + IBMX and the oocytes. Then immediately inject: Hold the oocyte using the holding capillary (holding capillary creates a negative pressure by which the oocyte is held) and inject ~5 pl of your working solution from the injection capillary into oocyte, not close to the nucleus (Figure 2).",
    "Transfer oocytes with constructs to incubator in M16 + IBMX.To verify the success of the microinjection use fluorescent microscopy.See also Video 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205172633_4271.jpgFigure 2. Microinjection. Inject working solution not close to the nucleus.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Microinjection Live-cell imaging1-2 h after microinjection wash the oocytes from IBMX in TM and then in M16.Transfer the oocytes into 2 µl of M16 covered with oil in Lab-tek Chamber Slide System. The dish with medium has to be equilibrated in 37.5 °C, 5% CO2. Raised coverslip is not suitable. We also use dishes from Ibidi (No. 1.5 H), similar to Labtek. Or, for cell culture (not for oocytes) you can choose for example a dish from µ-Slide I Luer Family.Place your sample in the confocal microscope equipped with EMBL stage incubator (37.5 °C, 5% CO2). Be sure that the incubator is closed.Turn on the appropriate lasers and set the software for video capturing (image each 5-15 min). We usually let the mouse oocytes cultivate overnight, but cultivations of embryos over a week long were published, depending on the chemistry of respective dyes, bleaching etc.Assembly the movie using Image J (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij[href=http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij]).See also Figure 3 and Video 4 showing visualization of meiotic maturation of mouse oocyte using H2B-GFP mRNA.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205172702_7708.jpgFigure 3.
