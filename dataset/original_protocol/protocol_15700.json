  "procedures": [
    "1. Construction of miRNA expression vectors\nNOTE: The procedures for constructing miRNA expression vectors (steps 1.1-1.3, 1.5-1.6.) are optimized for the miRNA expression kit, Block-iT Pol II miR RNA expression kit with EmGFP, as previously described15,16. The kit provides the expression vector designed to allow miRNA expression (pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miRNA), a control vector (pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miRNA-negative control plasmid), accessory reagents, and instructions to produce miRNA expression vectors (see Table of Materials)17.\nDesigning single-stranded DNA oligos encoding pre-miRNAs against the target gene: Design single-stranded DNA oligos (\"top strand\" oligos (target pre-miRNAs) and \"bottom strand\" oligos (complements of top strand oligos)) using the online tool, RNAi Designer (see Table of Materials). See Figure 2 for the required features of the single-stranded oligos (Figure 2A) and examples of target sequences (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: It is recommended that 5-10 pre-miRNA sequences be generated for a given target gene and screened for knockdown activities in vitro (step 1.4).\nAnnealing of the top- and bottom-strand oligos to generate a double-stranded oligo\n\t\nSet up the following annealing reaction (Table 1) in a sterile 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nIncubate the reaction mixture at 95 °C for 4 min. Anneal the top- and bottom-strand oligos to generate a double-stranded oligo by allowing the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature (RT) for 5-10 min. Centrifuge the sample briefly (~5 s).\n\t\tNOTE: The annealed oligos can be stored at -20 °C without degradation for at least a year.\nCloning the double-stranded oligos into the miRNA expression vector (pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miRNA (Provided in the miRNA expression kit)): Clone individual double-stranded oligos into the linearized miRNA expression vector, according to the manufacturer's manual17.\nEvaluation of knockdown effects",
    "NOTE: It is recommended that individual miRNA sequences be tested for gene suppression efficiency in vitro before they are applied in ovo. Knockdown efficiency can be tested by transfecting miRNA expression plasmids into a cell line that expresses the target gene. Alternatively, individual miRNA expression plasmids can be co-transfected into cell lines with an expression construct for the target gene. For target genes encoding proteins that are not membrane-anchored in their native state (e.g., soluble proteins), an alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion protein can be used for monitoring the expression of the target protein. A cDNA sequence encoding the target protein can be fused in frame to human placental alkaline phosphatase in AP-tag vectors (APtag-1- APtag-5; see Table of Materials) and introduced into cells18. When expressed in culture cells (e.g., HEK293T cells), the AP-tagged target protein is secreted at high levels into culture media, and thus knockdown effects of miRNA sequences can be evaluated by measuring the decrease in AP activity in the culture media of miRNA-transfected cells (substeps 1.4.1-1.4.4).\n\t\nCulture HEK293T cells in a 24-well plate (8 x 104 cells/well) overnight. Transiently transfect the cells with individual miRNA expression constructs with an expression plasmid of an AP-tagged target protein. Use the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miRNA-negative control plasmid (provided in the miRNA expression kit) as a control. (If cell lines that stably express an AP-tagged target protein are used, transfect the cells only with individual miRNA expression constructs.)\n\t\tNOTE: A conventional lipofection reagent (see Table of Materials) is used for transfection.\nCollect the conditioned medium 48-72 h after the transfection and heat inactivate the endogenous AP activity in a 65 °C water bath for 5 min. Spinout debris in a desktop microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min.",
    "Buffer the supernatant with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 and pass it through a 0.45 µm filter.\nTake 100 µL (for measurement in a plate reader) or 500 µL (for a spectrophotometer) of the supernatant and add an equal amount of 2x AP substrate buffer (Table 2). Check the AP activity by measuring OD405 in a plate reader or a spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: If the AP activity of the conditioned medium is too high for accurate measurement, dilute it with HBAH buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0)) or another buffer that contains a carrier protein. Do not use phosphate-containing buffers (e.g., PBS) because inorganic phosphate acts as a competitive inhibitor of AP.\nChaining of miRNA sequence\n\tNOTE: Knockdown effects can be enhanced by chaining different miRNAs against the same target gene or repeating the same miRNA. The miRNA expression vector supports the chaining of multiple pre-miRNA sequences and their co-cistronic expression17.\n\t\nChain two different pre-miRNA sequences (against the same target gene) that show highest knockdown activities in in vitro assays (step 1.4), according to the manufacturer's instructions17.\nEvaluate gene suppression efficiency of the chained constructs using in vitro assays as described in step 1.4. If three or more pre-miRNA sequences show similarly high knockdown activities, test different combinations of two sequences and use the combinations that show the highest knockdown activity (see Representative Results).\nTransferring the EmGFP-pre-miRNA expression cassette to the Tol2 transposon vector",
    "NOTE: The expression cassette containing EmGFP cDNA and two pre-miRNA sequences is transferred into the Tol2 transposon vector (pT2K-CAGGS vector, see Table of Materials). To this end, the expression cassette (encompassing from the 3' end of the CMV promoter to the miRNA reverse sequencing primer site of the miRNA expression vector) is PCR-amplified using primers with an artificial restriction enzyme site, and the PCR product is cloned into the Tol2 transposon vector. The Tol2 transposon vector contains the ubiquitous CAGGS promoter, which drives the expression of the inserted expression cassette. The CAGGS promoter and the expression cassette are flanked by the Tol2 sequences (Figure 1).\n\t\nPCR amplification of the EmGFP-pre-miRNA expression cassette: Follow the reaction setup and the thermocycling conditions described in Table 3.\nLigate the gel-purified PCR product (c. 1.3 kb) into the restriction enzyme-digested Tol2 transposon vector. Electroporate the plasmid into competent E. coli cells (see Table of Materials) and select the recombinants (pT2K-CAGGS-EmGFP-2x miRNA constructs).\nPrepare the plasmid by using a conventional maxiprep kit (see Table of Materials). Check the structure and sequence of the plasmid by restriction mapping and by using the primers used for the PCR, respectively.\n2. Egg storage and incubation\nPurchase fertilized White Leghorn (Gallus gallus) eggs from local farms or commercial vendors.\n\tNOTE: Eggs may be kept at 12-16 °C or at 4 °C for up to 1 week prior to incubation without significant loss of viability or delay in development during incubation.\nLabel the eggs with the start date of incubation and mark the top side of the egg (where the embryo will be positioned). Incubate fertilized eggs in a horizontal position at 38 °C until the embryos have reached Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stages 10 (33-38 h) -11 (40-45 h)19.\n3. In ovo electroporation\nPreparation for in ovo electroporation",
    "Preparation of 0.25% fast green solution: Dissolve 25 mg of Fast Green FCF in 10 mL of PBS. Filter the solution using a 0.2 µm syringe filter. The solution can be stored at RT.\nDNA cocktail: Prepare the injection solution by mixing the individual pT2K-CAGGS-EmGFP-2x miRNA plasmids (substep 1.6.3) with the Tol2 transposase expression plasmid (pCAGGS-T2TP vector; see Table of Materials) (5 µg/µL each) at the ratio of 2:1. Add 1/10 volume of 0.25% fast green solution to visualize the injected area.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimum DNA concentration may vary depending on the constructs.\nSetting up the microinjection apparatus (Figure 3A,B): The microinjection apparatus consists of the followings (see Table of Materials): Hamilton syringe, 18 G needle (Needle length = 2\"), PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) tubing (2 cm length), Micropipette needle (Can be made by pulling capillary tubes with omega dot fiber (1 mm O.D. X 0.75 mm I.D) with a micropipette puller).\n\t\t\nFill a Hamilton syringe with heavy mineral oil. Attach an 18 G needle to the syringe and fill the inner space of the needle with oil by depressing the syringe plunger.\nAttach a piece of 2 cm long PVC tubing to the end of the needle and fill the tubing with the oil.\nAttach a pulled micropipette needle to the tubing. Break off the tip of the micropipette needle to a 10-20 µm diameter by fine forceps to make a small opening. Fill the entire needle with oil.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Care should be taken not to trap any air bubbles in the system, as they would inhibit the flow of the DNA solution.",
    "Put 5 µL of the colored DNA cocktail (substep 3.1.2) onto a sterile Petri dish. Under the dissecting microscope, place the tip of the micropipette needle into the DNA solution on the sterile Petri dish and slowly draw the solution into the needle.\nWait until the pressure equilibrates inside and outside the needle (to avoid that air goes into the needle) and take the tip of the needle out of the DNA solution. Keep the tip of the needle submerged in sterile PBS in a small beaker until injection.\nSetting up the electroporation apparatus (Figure 3A,C): \n\t\t\nSet a pair of platinum electrodes with an electrode holder on a micromanipulator. Adjust the spacing between the tip of the electrodes to 2 mm (Figure 3C,E).\nConnect the electrodes to a square wave pulse generator with cables (see Table of Materials).\nMicroinjection of DNA solution (Figure 3D)\n\t\nRemove a chicken egg from the incubator and wipe the surface of the egg with a tissue paper soaked in 70% ethanol.\nAttach an 18 G needle to a 10 mL syringe. Insert the needle through the blunt end of the egg, angled downward (45°) to avoid damaging the yolk.\nWithdraw 2-3 mL of albumin from the egg. Seal the hole with a piece of Scotch tape. Confirm that the embryo and vitelline membrane are detached from the shell by \"candling\" the egg with light.\nRemove a piece of eggshell (2-3 cm diameter circle) from the top of the egg using scissors and forceps to expose the embryo. Do not window more than five eggs at any one time to prevent drying out of embryos during electroporation.",
    "NOTE: If it is difficult to open a window without cracking the egg, the entire top of the egg can be covered with Sellotape or Scotch tape before removing a piece of eggshell.\nInsert the tip of the needle into the optic vesicle from its proximal side at a 45° angle and inject the DNA cocktail by slowly depressing (or tapping on) the plunger until the blue-colored solution fills the lumen (Figure 3D).\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, a pressure microinjection system (see Table of Materials) can be used for the injection of DNA solutions.\nWithdraw the needle and place its tip back into PBS.\nElectroporation (Figure 3E)\n\t\nSet pulse parameters of the electroporator as follows: Voltage: 15 V, Pulse length: 50 ms, Pulse interval: 950 ms, Pulse number: 5\nAdd a few drops of HBSS onto the vitelline membrane over the embryo. Lower the electrodes into the HBSS using the micromanipulator, perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, this procedure can be done without adding HBSS, as albumin is a good electric conductor that allows efficient electroporation.\nPlace the electrodes on either side (anterior (nasal) side and posterior (temporal) side) of the optic vesicle (Figure 3E). Ensure that the electrodes do not touch the embryo or blood vessels. Apply pulsed electric fields.\nRemove the electrodes and gently clean the electrodes with a water-soaked sterile cotton bud to avoid the accumulation of albumin.\nSeal the window with Scotch tape and re-incubate the embryo until the desired developmental stage.\nSubscription Required.
