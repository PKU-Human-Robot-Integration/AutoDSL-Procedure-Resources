    "Note: Dissolve aliquots of lyophilized custom peptides (Pepscan) in MilliQ water to a stock solution of 1 mM. Dissolve aliquots of lyophilized custom fluorescent RNA oligos (IDT) in MilliQ water to a stock solution of 100 µM. Dissolve lyophilized polyU potassium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) in MilliQ water to a stock solution of 10 µg/µl. Aliquots are stored at -20 °C. Fluorescent labeling of custom peptidesPerform labeling reaction with desired Alexa Fluor® labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, but purify the peptide with the use of Amicon Ultra spin columns (minimum peptide size must be above 3 kDa).Add labeling reaction to spin column and centrifuge in bench top centrifuge for 10 min at 20,817 x g (rcf, max speed) at room temperature (Eppendorf 5430).Discard flow-through. Add 400 µl MilliQ water and centrifuge again. Repeat at least five times or until there is visually no more dye in the filtrate.Pipet remaining solution which still contains labeled peptide from spin column and adjust volume to obtain a 500 µM-1 mM stock solution. Concentration is calculated based on initial input.Induction of arginine-peptide phase separation by molecular crowderMix by pipetting rigorously together the following reagents in MilliQ water to obtain described final concentrations. Note: Make sure to pipet PEG300 slowly and always with a new pipet tip to prevent errors due to the high viscosity of the solution.Potassium buffer (10x stock) to 1x (see Recipes)PEG300 (100%) to 30%Peptide (1 mM) to desired concentration (1-250 µM)If the peptide is prone to phase separation the solution should turn cloudy or opaque instantaneously at room temperature. For example, see Figure 2A. Briefly cooling on ice can promote phase separation of proteins that phase separate only weakly.Quantify extent of phase separation by measuring OD600 of 60 µl samples using trUView microcuvettes in a SmartSpec Plus (or similar) spectrophotometer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830235157_0519.",

Quantify extent of phase separation by measuring OD600 of 60 µl samples using trUView microcuvettes in a SmartSpec Plus (or similar) spectrophotometer.Imaging arginine-peptide phase separation by fluorescence microscopyPrepare phase separated peptide solution as described above. Spike the sample with fluorescent peptide or RNA oligomer to reach 200 nM and 100 nM respectively as final concentrations.Pipet 20 µl of the sample into each chamber of the cell counting slides (see Figure 3). Seal the chambers using clear adhesive tape and cover with nail varnish to prevent evaporation during imaging (see Figure 3).Let the samples equilibrate at room temperature in the dark for at least 30 min.Image samples on a LSM 780 Meta NLO confocal microscope with 20x long range objective. For example, see Figure 2B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830235455_6293.jpgFigure 3. Workflow of microscope chamber preparation. A solution containing a blue dye was used for illustration. Step 1: Pipet sample in the incubation chamber; Step 2: Seal both sides of the chamber with clear adhesive tape; Step 3: Apply clear nail varnish to make chamber securely air tight.Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysisSamples are prepared as described above.",
    "Bleach a circular area of 1-2 µM radius at 100% laser power in the center of a droplet with a radius between 5 µM and 10 µM. Use of larger droplets is advised so bleached area does not cover whole droplet compromising the study of intradroplet diffusion. When droplets do not reach this size spontaneously, incubation chambers were briefly centrifuged for 30 sec at 201 x g (rcf; 1,000 rpm on Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge).Monitor fluorescence recovery after bleaching for at least 60 sec using Zen software (Figure 4A). Make sure to record simultaneously the fluorescence intensity over time of the background solution and an unbleached reference droplet.Export raw data to Microsoft Excel for analysis."
