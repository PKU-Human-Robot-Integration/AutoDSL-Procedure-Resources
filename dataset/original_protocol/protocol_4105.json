  "procedures": [
    "This detailed protocol is divided into four sections:Part I. Generation of mutant libraryWe provide a detailed protocol for the generation of a mutant library in non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, but this can be used for all bacteria that are naturally competent.Part II. Mutant library screenAs example, we provide a detailed protocol for the identification of non-typeable Haemophilus genes essential for survival in environmental air, as published before (Langereis et al., 2013).Part III. Mutant library readoutPart IV. Data analysisFor data analysis, the web-based analysis software ESSENTIALS was used (Zomer et al., 2012). A detailed manual can be found on the website (http://bamics2.cmbi.ru.nl/websoftware/essentials/essentials_start.php[href=http://bamics2.cmbi.ru.nl/websoftware/essentials/essentials_start.php]).Part I.

Add 250 μl of 70% ethanol (just add, do not try to resuspend the pellet).Centrifuge at maximum speed in a precooled (4 °C) microcentrifuge for 5 min.Carefully remove all supernatant with a 1 ml pipet (do not touch the pellet).",
    "(Optional: Centrifuge in a microcentrifuge for a few seconds to collect the remainder of the supernatant at the bottom of the tube and carefully remove all supernatant with a 200 μl pipet.)Dry the pellet on air (pellets turns from opaque to white in ~30 min).(Optional: Place the tubes in a heating block at 30 °C to speed up evaporation of liquid.)Dissolve pellet in 15.8 μl sterile dH2O.Repair of the transposition reactionAdd to the dissolved pellet2 μl 10x T4 DNA polymerase Reaction Buffer 0.2 μl 10 mg/ml BSA1 μl 1 mM dNTP mix      1 μl 2.5 U/μl T4 DNA polymeraseIncubate for 30 min at 16 °C.Inactivate polymerase for 10 min at 75 °C in a heating block.Add to inactivated polymerase reaction2 μl 3 M Sodium acetate0.5 μl 20 mg/ml glycogen50 μl 100% ethanolMix and incubate in -20 °C freezer for at least 30 min.Centrifuge at maximum speed in a precooled (4 °C) microcentrifuge for 15 min.Remove supernatant with 1 ml pipet (do not touch the pellet). Note: At this moment it is not necessary to carefully remove al liquid. Add 250 µl of 70% ethanol.Centrifuge at maximum speed in a precooled (4 °C) microcentrifuge for 5 min.Carefully remove all supernatant with a 1 ml pipet (do not touch the pellet).(Optional: Centrifuge in a microcentrifuge for a few seconds to collect the remainder of the supernatant at the  bottom of the tube and carefully remove all supernatant with a 200 μl pipet.)Dry the pellet on air (pellets turns from opaque to bright white in ~30 min).(Optional: place the tubes in a heating block at 30 °C to speed up evaporation of liquid)Dissolve pellet in 17.8 µl sterile dH2O. Add to the dissolved pellet2 μl 10x E.coli DNA ligase Reaction Buffer     0.2 μl E.coli DNA ligase (5 U/µl)Incubate overnight at 16 °C.",
    "Store mutagenized DNA at -20 °C.TransformationGrow 10 ml non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) in BHI medium containing 10 μg/ml hemin and 2 μg/ml NAD shaking with 225 rpm at 37 °C to an OD620 of 0.3.Centrifuge the bacteria 10 min with 3,000 x g and resuspend in 10 ml PBS.Centrifuge the bacteria 10 min with 3,000 x g and resuspend in 10 ml M-IV medium and incubate 100 min shaking with 100 rpm at 37 °C.Centrifuge the bacteria 10 min with 3,000 x g and resuspend in 1 ml M-IV medium and transfer to a 1.5 ml tube.Add 1-5 μg mutagenized DNA and incubate 60 min with 100 rpm at 37 °C.Plate 1 to 100 μl per sBHI plate for over night growth at 37 °C + 5% CO2.Collect the colonies by adding 5 ml PBS + 15% glycerol on the plates and store 1 ml aliquots at -80 °C.Note: The number of colonies (transposon mutants) is dependent on the transformation efficiency of the NTHi strain used in this experiment. It is recommended to use a highly competent NTHi strain in order to obtain large mutant libraries. Alternatively, multiple transformations can be pooled to obtain sufficient transposon mutants, typically 10-20-fold the number of genes in the genome.Part II. Mutant library screenThe mutant library can be used in any control and stress condition. As proof of principle, we have used growth in air enriched with 5% CO2 (control condition) or ambient air with 0.04% CO2 (stress condition). To do so, the mutant library was constructed with 5% CO2 enriched M-IV medium (M-IV medium incubated at least 2 h at 5% CO2 in an open 50 ml tube) without shaking to prevent loss of mutants while making the mutant library (generation mutant library steps 27-28).",

(Start culture)Dilute the start culture 1:100 in 5 ml 5% enriched sBHI medium (control) or sBHI medium (stress) and grow to OD620 = 0.5 with 5% CO2 (control) or ambient air (stress) at 37 °C and store three 1 ml aliquots with 15% glycerol at -80 °C for storage and start culture for next round. (Round 1)Dilute the first round culture 1:100 in 5 ml 5% enriched sBHI medium (control) or sBHI medium (stress) and grow to OD620 = 0.5 with 5% CO2 (control) or ambient air (stress) at 37 °C and store three 1 ml aliquots with 15% glycerol at -80 °C for storage and start culture for next round. (Round 2)Dilute the second round culture 1:100 in 5 ml 5% enriched sBHI medium (control) or sBHI medium (stress) and grow to OD620 = 0.5 with 5% CO2 (control) or ambient air (stress) at 37 °C and store three 1 ml aliquots with 15% glycerol at -80 °C for storage. (Round 3)Thaw the challenged mutant library at RT, centrifuge 3 min 10.000 x g and resuspend the bacteria in 1 ml buffer B1 supplemented with 2 μl RNase A solution (100 mg/ml).Part III.",
