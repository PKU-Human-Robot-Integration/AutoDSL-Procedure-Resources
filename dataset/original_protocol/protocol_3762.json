The anticipated doubling time during exponential growth will be ∼3 h for the S. acidocaldarius strain DSM639 and ∼4.5 h for the S. islandicus strain E233S.\nCritical: The culture is hot and needs to be handled with care.\nDay 2\nTiming: 2 h\nFix cells as follows. It is important to take a cell culture and mix it with formaldehyde as quickly as possible. Also, make sure to incubate the mixture at 25°C. Variation in the temperature during fixation could lead to variable fixation efficiency (see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] for more detail).\nTake 20 mL of the culture while keeping the flask in the water bath. Quickly mix it with 80 mL of ambient temperature Fixation Buffer (approximately 20°C). Use Fixation Buffer containing 5% formaldehyde for S. acidocaldarius (the final concentration is 4% after mixing) and 7.5% for S. islandicus (the final concentration is 6% after mixing).\nIncubate the mixture for 30 min at 25°C with agitation (110 rpm).\nAdd 11.2 mL of 2.5 M glycine to quench the crosslinking reaction.\nIncubate the mixture for 10 min at 21°C.\nWash the fixed cells as follows.\nDispense the mixture into two 50-mL tubes and centrifuge them for 30 min at 3,120 × g, 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant but leave ∼2 mL of it in each tube to avoid loss of cells.",
    "Resuspend the cells in the left supernatant and dispense the suspension into as many 1.5-mL tubes as you need.\nSpin down for 2 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellets together in a total of 1 mL ice-cold 1× PBS.\nSpin down for 2 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS.\nRepeat the sub-step f.\nStore the pellet at −80°C.\nNote: The fixed pellet can be kept at least for a month.\nNote: In the protocol described here for 3C analyses, cells are fixed with higher concentrations of formaldehyde than used for Hi-C analyses of Sulfolobus cells (Takemata et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Takemata and Bell, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). These fixation conditions have been optimized by us to to allow capture of contacts between AluI (4-bp cutter) fragments, which are much smaller than HindIII (6-bp cutter) fragments generated in the Hi-C protocol.\nDNA digestion followed by proximity ligation\nTiming: 11 h\nThis section describes how to digest crosslinked cellular DNA with AluI. Generated fragments are used for proximity ligation without biotin labeling.\nResuspend a cell pellet in 320 μL of 1× PBS/1 mM EDTA (for S. acidocaldarius) or 1 × NEBuffer 2 (for S. islandicus).\nMix 20 μL of the suspension with 780 μL of 1× PBS to measure OD600.\nDilute the remainder of the cell suspension to an OD600 of 4 (roughly corresponding to a 2- or 3-fold dilution of the original suspension). For the dilution, use the same buffer as used in step 6. Use 400 μL of the diluted cell suspension for subsequent steps.\nIf you are using S. acidocaldarius, treat cells with proteinase K as follows to partially disrupt the cell wall. Skip this step when using S. islandicus.",
    "Dilute proteinase K solution to 2 mg/mL in 1× PBS/1 mM EDTA. Add 4.8 μL of the diluted proteinase K solution and incubate the sample for 20 min at 37°C with agitation (600 rpm).\nImmediately spin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C. Remove the supernatant.\nFor wash, resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS/1 mM EDTA and spin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C. Remove the supernatant.\nRepeat sub-step c three times for a total of 4 washing steps.\nResuspend the cells with 1 mL of ice-cold 1 × NEBuffer 2.\nSpin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C to remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 μL of 1 × NEBuffer 2.\nThe total volume of the cell suspension will be variable due to residual supernatant not removed in step 10. For accuracy, transfer 50 μL of the suspension to a new 1.5-mL tube.\nTo permeabilize the cells and remove non-crosslinked DNA-binding proteins for subsequent digestion, add 5.55 μL of 10% SDS for a final concentration of 1%. Incubate the mixture for 15 min at 65°C with agitation (600 rpm).\nImmediately cool down the tube on ice for exactly 90 s.\nNote: If the tube is left on ice too long, a precipitate could form and affect the downstream steps.\nSpin down condensate briefly and mix by pipetting.\nAssemble the following reactions in 1.5-mL tubes. For Sample D, add AluI last and mix the other components well to make sure that the reaction is properly buffered and SDS is quenched with Triton X-100 before adding the enzyme.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_13.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_14.csv\nIncubate the samples for 3.5 h at 37°C with agitation (600 rpm).",
    "Prepare two new 1.5-mL Eppendorf Safe-Lock Tubes and dispense 50 μL of Sample D to each of them. Label the two tubes as \"Sample L.\"\nAdd reagents as follows to quench the digestion.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_15.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_16.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_17.csv\nIncubate the samples for 30 min at 37°C with agitation (600 rpm).\nAdd the following reagents to each Sample L. To make sure that the reaction is properly buffered and SDS is quenched with Triton X-100 before adding T4 DNA ligase, mix the other components well first and then add the enzyme.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_18.csv\nIncubate all samples for 4 h at 16°C with agitation (600 rpm). Mix the Samples L by inverting the tubes every 30 min.\nCross-link reversal\nTiming: > 12 h (overnight)\nRemove crosslinks for subsequent DNA purification.\nAdd the following reagents to each Sample L.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_19.csv\nAdd 5 μL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K to each of all samples.\nIncubate the samples for 6 h at 65°C and then for > 6 h at 37°C. Agitate the samples at 600 rpm during the incubation. Overheating of the samples could lead to DNA degradation by endogenous nucleases (see troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for more detail).\nDNA purification 1\nTiming: 8 h\nThis section describes how to purify DNA and confirm successful DNA digestion and ligation.\nCombine and dispense the two Samples L into four 1.5-mL tubes (∼560 μL /tube).\nAdd 1 volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to each tube and mix by hand. Spin down for 10 min at 10,000 × g, 21°C. Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl is toxic and must be handled with care as noted above.\nTransfer aqueous phase in each tube (80 μL for Sample U and Sample D and 510 μL for Sample L) to a new 1.5-mL tube. Be careful not to disturb the interphase.",
    "(For Samples L only) Repeat 28. Take 450 μL of aqueous phase from each tube and combine them for a total of 1,800 μL. Dispense the combined extract into three 1.5-mL tubes.\nAdd 0.1 volume of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.2) to each tube.\nFor Samples U and D, add 2 μL of 20 mg/mL glycogen to each tube. For Sample L, add 2.7 μL of 20 mg/mL glycogen to each tube.\nAdd 1 volume of isopropanol and leave the samples for 1 h at −20°C.\nSpin down for 1 h at 21,000 × g, 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and rinse the pellet in 500 μL of 70% ethanol.\nSpin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and spin down briefly to remove residual ethanol.\nLeave the tubes open for 10 min at 21°C to air-dry the pellets.\nFor Samples U and D, dissolve the pellet in 20 μL of TE buffer containing 0.1 mg/mL RNase A. For Sample L, dissolve the three pellets together in 40 μL of TE buffer containing 0.1 mg/mL RNase A.\nIncubate the samples for 30 min at 37°C.",
    "Run 5 μL of each sample on a 0.7% agarose gel for quality control. In Sample U (undigested control), you will see a band above 10 kb in size (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The band will be slightly smeared, but it is acceptable. If digestion with AluI is successful, DNA in Sample D (digested, but not ligated) should be seen as a smear below 3 kb. In Sample L (digested and then ligated), you will see a broader smear that starts from approximately the same position as the DNA band in Sample U. This shift toward the larger DNA size is a sign of successful proximity ligation. See troubleshooting problems 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for potential problems and solutions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/685-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Quality check of 3C DNA by gel electrophoresis\n3C DNA obtained from S. acidocaldarius was run on a 0.7 % agarose gel together with control samples. DNA marker: 1 kb DNA Ladder (New England Biolabs N3232S).\nPause Point: You can stop the experiment by storing the remainder of Sample L at −20°C.\nDNA purification 2 and DNA shearing\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section includes second DNA purification and DNA shearing in preparation for library construction.\nAdjust the volume to 100 μL by adding Buffer EB.\nAdd 1 volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl and mix by vortexing.\nSpin down for 10 min at 10,000 × g, 21°C.\nTransfer 80 μL of the aqueous phase to a new 1.5-mL tube.\nAdd back 80 μL of Buffer EB to the tube containing phenol:chloroform:isoamyl. Mix by vortexing and spin down for 10 min at 10,000 × g, room temperature. Combine 80 μL of the aqueous phase with the extract previously taken for a total of 160 μL.\nAdd 0.1 volume of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.2).",
    "Add 2 volume of 100% ethanol. Leave the sample on ice for 1 h.\nSpin down for 30 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and rinse the pellet in 500 μL of 70% ethanol.\nSpin down for 5 min at 21,000 × g, 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and spin down briefly to remove residual ethanol.\nLeave the tubes open for 10 min at 21°C to air-dry the pellets.\nDissolve the pellet in 90 μL of Buffer EB. Transfer the solution to a 0.6-mL tube and chill it on ice for 10 min.\nShear the DNA into fragments of 300–400 bp on average using a Bioruptor and the following parameters. Power: Low, ON time: 30 s, OFF time: 30 s, Cycles: 40.\nNote: We generate DNA fragments in this step that are slightly larger than those desired in the same step for Hi-C of Sulfolobus (Takemata et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Takemata and Bell, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) Over-shearing of DNA generates fragments that do not contain ligation junctions and thus are unusable for generation of contact maps. These fragments can be easily removed in the biotin pull-down step in Hi-C but not in this protocol, in which the biotin enrichment procedures are omitted.\nPause Point: You can stop the experiment by storing the sheared DNA at −20°C.\nLibrary construction\nTiming: 4.5 h\nThis section describes how to prepare a 3C-seq library using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina. The protocol essentially follows the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.neb.com/protocols/2014/05/22/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-ultra-dna-library-prep-kit-for-illumina-e7370[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2014/05/22/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-ultra-dna-library-prep-kit-for-illumina-e7370] ).\nOptional: Measure the DNA concentration of your sample using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit before starting the library preparation.\nPerform NEBNext End Prep as follows.\nMix the following reagents in a PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_20.csv",
    "Incubate the reaction in a thermocycler with the heated lid on as follows: 30 min at 20°C, 30 min at 65°C, and then hold at 4°C.\nPerform Adapter Ligation as follows.\nMix the following reagents in a 1.5-mL DNA LoBind Tube. Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix is very viscous and should be pipetted carefully (see troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] for more detail).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_685_21.csv\nNote: Do not premix the Ligation Master Mix, Ligation Enhancer, and adaptor before use.\nNote: If you measure the DNA concentration of your sample using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and find that your input DNA is < 100 ng, dilute NEBNext Adaptor for Illumina according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.neb.com/protocols/2014/05/22/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-ultra-dna-library-prep-kit-for-illumina-e7370[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2014/05/22/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-ultra-dna-library-prep-kit-for-illumina-e7370] ). We usually get > 100 ng of input DNA and therefore skip the dilution step.\nIncubate the sample for 15 min at 20°C.\nAdd 3 μL of USER Enzyme (provided in the multiplex oligo kit with a red cap).\nIncubate the sample for 15 min at 37°C.\nPerform the \"Size Selection of Adapter Ligated DNA\" step as follows to purify DNA of 400–500 bp (insert + adapter).\nNote: As mentioned in the sonication step before the library construction, this 3C-seq protocol aims to shear ligated DNA into larger sizes than those desired in the Hi-C protocol for Sulfolobus (Takemata et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; also see Takemata and Bell, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Due to this difference, the size of DNA purified in step 57 is also larger than the size range in the same step for Hi-C of Sulfolobus (∼320 bp).\nAdd 13.5 μL of Milli-Q water to the reaction for a total of 100 μL.\nResuspend AMPure XP Beads by vortexing.\nNote: Warm AMPure XP Beads to 21°C before use.\nMix the reaction with 40 μL of resuspended AMPure XP Beads.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature.",

Please see troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] when the DNA size deviates from the expected one.\nPerform paired-end sequencing using an Illumina sequencing platform. We routinely use NextSeq for sequencing of Hi-C libraries. We typically aim to obtain 80–100 million of total reads per library. Although the genomes of S. acidocaldarius and S. islandicus are AT-rich (63% and 65% respectively), we get good quality reads with a small amount of PhiX spike-in (0.5%)."
