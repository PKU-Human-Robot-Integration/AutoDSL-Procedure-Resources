(2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]. We used EDTA coated tubes containing a total of 6 mL of blood or heparin coated tubes that contained 10 mL of blood. Mukai et al. describes in detail the effect of time post collection, refrigeration, and anti-coagulant type on CD63 expression post basophil activation test.\nWhole blood is stimulated with anti-IgE or IL-3 and processed for downstream cellular analysis.\nWarm whole blood in 37°C water bath for 30 s.\nPipette 1 mL of whole blood into 5 mL snap cap tubes with the following stimulants:\nSample Tube 1: 1 mL of RPMI (control, without stimulation).\nSample Tube 2: 1 mL of 2 μg/mL anti-IgE in RPMI.\nSample Tube 3: 1 mL of 4 ng/mL IL-3 in RPMI.\nLet sample tubes incubate at 37°C for 30 min in 5% CO2 incubator. Make sure tubes are tightly capped.\nTransfer contents of each tube to corresponding 50 mL falcon tubes.\nTo each tube add 20 mL of cold 1× RBC lysis buffer. Incubate for 15 min in the dark on ice.\nStop RBC lysis by adding 20 mL cold dPBS + 2 mM EDTA.\nCentrifuge cells at 350 × g, 5 min, at 4°C. Aspirate most of supernatant, leaving behind approximately 100 μL, in which the pellet of cells can be dissolved by tapping the tube.\nAdd 20 mL dPBS + EDTA to each tube, making sure cells are fully resuspended in fluid by gently tapping tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 350 × g, 5 min, at 4°C. Aspirate most of supernatant, leaving behind approximately 100 μL, in which the pellet of cells can be dissolved by tapping the tube.\nAdd 3 mL of CSM to each tube and transfer their contents to corresponding FACS tubes.\nCount cells in hemacytometer post RBC lysis. In each tube, there should be around 10 million cells.\nSpin tubes for 5 min at 350 × g, at 4°C.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant, leaving residual supernatant to avoid disrupting cell pellet. Tap tube to dissolve cells in solution. Given the concentrations of our antibodies in the panel, the cell volume should be 45 μL per tube prior to adding the surface antibody cocktail. The total staining volume, including surface cocktail will be 100 μL.\nCritical: Since basophils are a rare cell population, accounting for 1% of leukocytes in peripheral blood, avoid losing cells in washing steps. Decanting the supernatant or trying to aspirate supernatant entirely will result in increased cell loss. Spin live cells at 350 × g to maintain cell integrity.\nBlocking and surface immunostaining\nTiming: 1 h\nCells are prepared and stained with surface antibody markers. The staining cocktail is meant for up to 10 million cells.\nAdd 2.5 μL of Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend) solution. Tap tube to dissolve cells in solution.\nIncubate for 10 min at 20°C–23°C.\nAdd the volume necessary of the surface antibody cocktail into each tube. For our experiments this was 52.5 μL, bringing the total staining volume to 100 μL.\nTap cell volume to resuspend cells and prevent cell clumps.\nIncubate tubes at 20°C–23°C for 30 min.\nCisplatin staining and cell fixation\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Samples are stained with cisplatin (hazardous) to detect dead cells, which must be excluded from analysis. All analyzed cells are live, intact cells. Cisplatin is a hazardous chemical that crosslinks DNA and interferes with cell division. Handle with chemical resistant gloves, safety goggles, face mask, and lab coat, thus minimizing any exposure to skin. Individuals who are pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting pregnancy should not be exposed to this chemical.\nTo each sample tube, add 899 μL of low barium PBS and 1 μL of 0.5 mM cisplatin, for a final concentration of 0.5 μM cisplatin in a total volume of 1 mL.\nBriefly vortex and incubate for 5 min at 20°C–23°C.\nAdd 4 mL of CSM, and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant leaving behind approximately 100 μL and resuspend cell pellet by tapping tube.\nRepeat steps 20–21.\nTo each tube, add 900 μL of CSM buffer and 100 μL of PFA 16% for a final concentration of 1.5% PFA.\nIncubate for 10 min at 20°C–23°C.\nOnce cells are fixed, pellet the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant leaving behind approximately 100 μL and resuspend the cells in the residual volume by tapping the tube.\nAdd 4 mL of CSM. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant leaving behind approximately 100 μL.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1544-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Optimization of eosinophil and neutrophil detection\n(A) Cells were treated with RBC lysis buffer, followed by staining with surface antibodies (including CD16 and CD66b) prior to fixation with PFA as outlined in protocol.\n(B) Cells were treated with RBC lysis buffer, fixed with PFA, and then stained with surface antibodies.",
    "(C) Cells were treated with a commercially available RBC lysis/fix solution prior to staining with surface antibodies.\nPause point: Fixed cells can remain in CSM suspension at 4°C for 24 h.\nCritical: Fixing cells after cell surface staining allows for clear distinction of eosinophils from neutrophils when gating with CD16 and CD66b. Otherwise CD16 levels of eosinophils appear indistinguishable from those of neutrophils (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCell permeabilization and intracellular staining\nTiming: 1.5 h\nCells must be permeabilized to permit Intracellular staining with antibody markers.\nTapping all sample tubes to resuspend cell pellet, then add 1 mL of 4°C 100% MeOH. Incubate on ice for exactly 10 min.\nImmediately add 3 mL of CSM to stop further permeabilization.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant, leaving approximately 100 μL of residual volume, as to not disturb cell pellet.\nResuspend cell pellet by tapping and repeat steps 29–31.\nAspirate supernatant and bring to appropriate volume for intracellular staining. Given our antibody cocktail, we brought the supernatant to a total volume of 65 μL.\nAdd the volume necessary of the intracellular antibody cocktail into each tube. For our experiments this was 35 μL of antibody cocktail, bringing the total staining volume to 100 μL.\nIncubate for 30 min at 20°C–23°C.\nAdd 3 mL of CSM buffer to each tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant leaving approximately 100 μL of residual volume.\nResuspend pellet by tapping tube and add 900 μL of DNA intercalator solution to each tube, total volume 1 mL, and gently mix by pipetting up and down.",
    "Leave at 4°C for at least 16 h. Alternatively, to run the sample on the CyTOF the same day, leave cells with DNA intercalator solution for 20 min at 20°C–23°C. Place at 4°C until sample is processed.\nPause point: Fixed cells in DNA intercalator can remain at 4°C for up to a week prior to running samples through the CyTOF.\nPreparation for acquisition\nTiming: 30 min\nCell preparation for acquisition by CyTOF2\nAdd 4 mL of CSM at 4°C to each sample tube. Resuspend pellet by tapping tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant leaving approximately 100 μL of residual volume.\nResuspend pellet by tapping tube and add 4 mL of filtered double-distilled water.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant leaving approximately 100 μL of residual volume.\nRepeat steps 42–43.\nDilute EQ Four Element Calibration Beads 10-fold in filtered double-distilled water and keep at 4°C. For example, add 2.5 mL of EQ beads to 22.5 mL double-distilled water to have enough solution for three to four tests. EQ beads are necessary for data normalization, as the instrument signal detection changes slightly over time.\nCount cells with hemacytometer.\nImmediately before analysis, resuspend pellet by tapping tube and add diluted EQ beads to reach a cell density of 1 million cells per mL.\nFilter sample by using a Falcon round-bottom tube with cell strainer (35 μm) to avoid clogging the CyTOF or nebulizer.\nCells were acquired at an event rate of less than 500 per second to avoid doublets. If the event rate was higher than 500 per second, the cell solution was further diluted with EQ bead/water mixture.\nCritical: Keep samples on ice until their acquisition.\nData analysis\nTiming: 6 h",
    "After event acquisition, live single cells will be isolated in silico, bead-normalized for changes in instrument signal, and quantile normalized to correct technical variation between CyTOF runs.\nFCS files for each sample were processed through a MATLAB-based bead normalization software (Finck et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) before being uploaded to Cytobank for gating.\nPlease refer to Figure 1A of Vivanco Gonzalez et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] for a detailed gating scheme to isolate live immune cells and specific granulocyte subsets.\nIndividual immune cell types (e.g., basophils) were processed with R (http://www.r-project.org[href=http://www.r-project.org]) to quantile normalize protein expression by donor. This approach corrects for technical variation between CyTOF runs.\nAn inverse hyperbolic sine (arcsinh) transformation with a cofactor of 5 was applied to the data before employing Scanpy’s (Wolf et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) Python-based (http://www.python.org[href=http://www.python.org]) implementation. Scanpy was used to carry out dimensionality reduction via tSNE and clustering with the Leiden algorithm."
