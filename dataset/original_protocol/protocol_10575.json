    "1. Activating the Surface of Glass Coverslips\nPlace glass circular coverslips (25 mm diameter) in a Petri dish and smear 0.1 M NaOH solution on it for 5 min (chemical fume hood recommended).\nRemove the NaOH solution and fully immerse coverslips with sterile ddH2O for 20 min while gently rocking on a rocking plate in a sterile culture hood.\nDrain sterile ddH2O and repeat the step 1.2.\nRemove the coverslips with sterile tweezers and place them in a new Petri dish with the activated face up.\nDry coverslips under a steady flow of high-purity nitrogen gas.\nIn a sterile culture hood, smear a thin layer of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl acrylate (92%) on the activated side of the coverslip for 1 hr.\nExtensively wash glass coverslips with 3 washes of sterile ddH2O and immerse them in sterile ddH2O in a new Petri dish.\nTap the Petri dish with Parafilm and place it on a rocker plate under gentle agitation for 10 min.\nRemove the coverslips from ddH2O with sterile tweezers with fine tips and place them in a new Petri dish with the activated face up.\nStore at RT in a dry place with aluminum foil to avoid dust from sticking to the coverslips.\n2. Preparation of Hydroxy-PAAm Hydrogels\nPrepare a weight of 65 mg of N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide (HEA) in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. It is important to prepare a fresh HEA solution.\nAdd 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES buffer to HEA and mix using a vortexer until the complete HEA dissolution.\nAdd 400 µl of 40% w/w in HEPES acrylamide solution and the required volume of 2% w/w in HEPES bis-acrylamide solution (see Table 1) to reach the desired hydrogel stiffness. Adjust with 50 mM HEPES to a final volume of 5 ml.",
    "Mix the solution using a vortexer and degas it in a vacuum chamber for 20 min in order to reduce oxygen concentration within the solution, which prevents hydroxy-PAAm polymerization.\nUnder a sterile hood, filter the degased solution with a 0.2 µm pore size filter in order to sterilize it.\nActivate circular glass coverslips (22 mm diameter) in a UV/ozone cleaner during 7 min.\nPrepare 100 µl of 10% ammonium persulfate (APS) solution, that is 10 mg APS in 100 µl ddH2O. It is important to prepare a fresh APS solution.\nAdd 2.5 µl of tetramethylenediamine (TEMED) and 25 µl of APS solution to the sterilized hydroxy-PAAm solution (step 2.5) to initiate the polymerization. Mix the solution by 3 successive pipettings without introduction of bubbles, under sterile conditions.\nUnder a sterile hood, place a 25 µl drop of the hydroxy-PAAm solution on a 25 mm coverslip (available from step 1.9) and immediately place a 22 mm glass coverslip (prepared on step 2.5) on top of the droplet to squeeze the hydroxy-PAAm solution. Center the 22 mm glass coverslip with sterile tweezers and smooth out any bubbles.\nAllow hydroxy-PAAm hydrogels to polymerize at RT for 15 min. Invert manually the remaining hydroxy-PAAm solution in the Eppendorf tube to follow the completion of the polymerization process.\nFully immerse coverslips with sterile ddH2O and carefully separate the 22 mm glass coverslips by introducing the edge of a razor blade between the 22 mm glass coverslips and the hydroxy-PAAm hydrogel layer.\nWash hydroxy-PAAm hydrogels with sterile PBS (3 exchanges of PBS) and let the gels fully immersed in sterile PBS to maintain hydration.\nStore hydroxy-PAAm hydrogels in sterile PBS at 4 °C for up to 3 days.\n3. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) Microstamp Fabrication",
    "NOTE: The fabrication of a silicon master is required prior to start the PDMS microstamp fabrication. This microfabrication of a silicon master can be done by lithographic techniques, which requires specialized equipment and training. Collaborations with a nanofabrication facility are encouraged to fabricate the silicon master. Alternatively, contact a company that fabricates custom-made microstructured silicon masters on demand. It is important to note that the fabrication of the silicon master needs only to be done once. Indeed, microstructured silicon masters can be used indefinitely to produce elastomeric stamps.\nMix PDMS and the curing agent in a 10:1 ratio in a plastic beaker and mix thoroughly using a pipette for 10 min.\nDegas the PDMS mixture under vacuum to remove air bubbles that were formed during the step 3.1.\nPlace the microstructured silicon master in a Petri dish and cast a 10-mm thick layer of degassed PDMS mixture on it without forming bubbles.\nLet cure the PDMS for 2 hr at 60 °C in an oven.\nIn a dust-free environment, peel-off the PDMS layer and excise 1 cm2 microstamps with a scalpel.\nUsing forceps, place PDMS microstamps pattern-up in a Petri dish.\n4. Micropatterning Hydroxy-PAAm Hydrogels\nPlace PDMS microstamps in an ethanol/water (50/50) solution and sonicate for 15 min.\nDry the stamps with a stream of nitrogen flow and place them pattern-up in a UV/Ozone cleaner (λ < 200 nm) for 7 min.\nUnder a sterile hood, place a 150-µl drop of a desired protein solution (e.g., 100 µg/ml laminin in PBS or 25 µg/ml fibronectin in PBS) onto the microstructured surface of a 1-cm2 PDMS stamp.\nOptional: Modify the concentration of the protein solution to modulate the cell-ligand density.",
    "Spread the protein solution across the stamp surface by moving it with a sterile tip of a pipette toward each corner of the stamp.\nLeave the protein solution to adsorb on the PDMS stamp for 60 min under a sterile hood. Turn off lamps to avoid protein damage.\nUnder a sterile hood, transfer hydroxy-PAAm coated coverslips (available from step 2.13) into a Petri dish.\nRemove excess PBS from the surface of hydroxy-PAAm substrates with a low nitrogen stream under sterile conditions. Stop the procedure as soon as no evidence of standing water on the gel surface is observed. The gel should not be dried thoroughly at this stage.\nDry carefully the structured surface of the PDMS stamp with a steady flow of high-purity nitrogen gas.\nGrasp the protein-coated stamp with dressing tissue forceps and place the structured surface in contact with the dried hydrogel surface. Apply brief pressure points with the tip of tweezers on the top of the PDMS stamp to ensure a good contact between stamp microfeatures and the hydrogel surface.\nLeave the PDMS stamp on the hydrogel surface for 1 hr at RT.\nGently remove PDMS stamps from hydroxy-PAAm hydrogels with dressing tissue forceps and follow the step 4.1 to clean the stamp.\nWash extensively the stamped hydroxy-PAAm hydrogels by 3 exchanges of PBS (pH = 7.4) in sterile conditions for 10 min per exchange.\nOptional: Additional micropatterns of other ECM proteins can be added to the hydroxy-PAAm surface by following steps 4.5 to 4.11.\nPassivate non-printed zones with a sterile solution of BSA at 5 mg/ml in PBS during one night at 4 °C under a gentle agitation on a rocking plate.",
    "Wash extensively by 3 exchanges of PBS (pH = 7.4) in sterile conditions for 10 min per exchange. At this stage, stamped hydroxy-PAAm hydrogels can be stored at 4 °C up to one week.\n5. Cell Deposition on Micropatterned hydroxy-PAAm Hydrogels\nIncubate coverslips in cell media for 30-45 min prior to plating cells.\nWash adherent cells cultured in a 75 cm2 culture flask with sterile PBS at 37 °C and detach it with 3 ml of trypsin-EDTA or accutase for 10 min.\nTransfer the desired amount of pre-warmed complete growth medium appropriate for your cell line into the flask containing the detached cells and centrifuge the cell suspension for 3 min at 650 x g.\nRemove the supernatant with a micropipette and resuspend the cells in complete culture medium at 15-20,000 cells/ml.\nAdd 4 ml of the cell solution to a micropatterned coverslip (obtained from Step 5.1) and place the cell-covered coverslip in a culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% humidity for 1-2 hr.\nAspirate gently unattached cells and replace culture medium. Return the attached cells to the incubator and let them spread fully (3-6 hr, depending on the cell type).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
