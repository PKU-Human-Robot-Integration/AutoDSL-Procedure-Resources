    "The MCF-7 cells used for the present study were obtained from a commercial source (see the Table of Materials).\n1. Cell culture\nCulture the MCF-7 cells in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (10,000 U/mL)/streptomycin (10,000 µg/mL) (see the Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: The cells covering 90% of the bottom of the dish were employed for the experiment and assigned into the following groups: control group, doxorubicin hydrochloride group (DXR, 5 µM), and Sal groups (20 µM, 40 µM, and 80 µM), or control group, LY294002 (10 µM, an inhibitor of PI3K) group, Sal (80 µM) group, and LY294002 (10 µM) + Sal (80 µM) group (see the Table of Materials).\n2. Cell viability assay\nNOTE: For details on this procedure, please refer to a previous report27.\nSeed MCF-7 cells with a density of 8 x 104 cells/well in 96-well plates, and incubate with Sal (10 µM, 20 µM, 40 µM, 80 µM, 160 µM, and 320 µM) for 24 h or Sal (20, 40, 80 µM) for 12 h/24 h/36 h/48 h overnight until the cells are adherent.\nAfter treatment, co-incubate the MCF-7 cells with 10 µL/well of CCK-8 solution (see the Table of Materials) for 2 h. Then, measure the optical density at 450 nm (OD450) with an automatic microplate reader.\n3. Cell migration and invasion\nNOTE: For details on this procedure, please refer to a previous report35.\nIncubate 2 mL of 5 x 106 cells/mL cells seeded in 6-well plates to cover 90% of the bottom of the dish.\nPerform a linear scratch wound along the center of the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette tip. Acquire images using an optical microscope at 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h.",
    "Use Image J software to measure the width of the scratch wounds.\nFor the transwell assay, suspend MCF-7 cells with no serum medium, and seed in the upper transwell chamber pre-coated with or without Matrigel (see the Table of Materials).\nIn the bottom of the transwell chamber, use DMEM complete medium as a chemical inducer. After 24 h, remove the cells in the upper chamber, and fix the remaining invasive and migrant cells in methanol35.\nStain the MCF-7 cells with crystal violet solution (see the Table of Materials). Capture the images using an optical microscope.\n4. Activity evaluation of Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase\nUse a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit to measure the protein concentration in lysed MCF-7 cells, following the manufacturer's instructions (see the Table of Materials).\n\t\nAdd samples of the lysed cells in their corresponding groups into the 96-well plates. After that, add the working solution to further incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Finally, measure the values of OD636 with a multifunctional microplate reader.\n5. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis and the cell cycle\nNOTE: For details on this procedure, please refer to a previous report31.\nDigest the cells, and harvest to resuspend in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for a 20 min staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) (see the Table of Materials), and then determine the number of apoptotic cells using a flow cytometer.\nMix the resuspended sample solution with PI solution for a 30 min incubation, followed by detecting with a flow cytometer.\n6. DCFH-DA and Fluo-4 AM fluorescence staining\nNOTE: For details on this procedure, please refer to a previous report29.",
    "Incubate the MCF-7 cells for 20 min with a 10 µM DCFH-DA fluorescence probe (see the Table of Materials) at 37 °C. After thoroughly removing the surplus DCFH-DA by washing three times with PBS, test the fluorescence intensity at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and 525 nm, respectively, using a fluorescence microscope.\nIncubate the MCF-7 cells with a 5 µM Fluo-4 AM fluorescent probe solution (see the Table of Materials) for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS three times, determine the fluorescence intensity values at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and 516 nm, respectively, using a fluorescence microscope.\n7. Western blot\nAdd 2 mL of 5 x 106 cells/mL cell suspensions containing different drugs into 6-well plates, and culture in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: The groups for the western blot analysis were set as follows: control group, LY294002 (10 µM) group, Sal (80 µM) group, and LY294002 (10 µM) + Sal (80 µM) group (see the Table of Materials).\nCollect the cells and supernatant, and centrifuge at 560 × g at 4 °C for 3 min. Discard the supernatant, and wash twice with pre-cooled PBS. After each wash, centrifuge the cells at 560 × g at 4 °C for 3 min.\nAdd 50 µL lysis buffer to the cell sample from step 7.2 for a 15 min ice bath. Centrifuge at 8550 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to collect the supernatant protein sample.\nAfter detecting the protein concentration using a BCA method, mix the protein sample in step 7.3 with loading buffer in a ratio of 4:1, denature at 100 °C for 10 min in a metal bath, and cool to room temperature.",
    "Add 20 µg of the protein sample from step 7.4, separate the proteins with different molecular weights35using 10% SDS-PAGE (see the Table of Materials), and then transfer to 0.22 µm PVDF membranes. After blockage with 5% BSA, incubate the membranes with the corresponding primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The dilute concentration of the following primary antibodies is 1:1,000: cleaved caspase-9/7/3 (CC-9/7/3), Bim, Bax, Bcl-2, p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, mTOR, HIF-1α, FoxO1, and β-actin (see the Table of Materials).\nThe next day, incubate the membranes with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 2 h at 37 °C. Develop the membranes using an ECL chemiluminescent solution, and capture images using a contactless quantitative western blot imaging system (see the Table of Materials).\n8. qRT-PCR\nPerform centrifugation to collect MCF-7 cells at 560 x g at 4 °C for 3 min, and add 500 µL buffer RL1 into 5 × 106 cells. Blow and mix repeatedly with a pipette until no cell masses are visible.\n\tNOTE: Buffer RL1 is one of the components in the total RNA isolation kit (see the Table of Materials).\nTransfer the cell homogenates in step 8.1 to the DNA-cleaning column embedded in the collection tube, and centrifuge at 8,550 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Remove the DNA-cleaning column, and keep the supernatant in the collection tube.\n\tNOTE: The DNA-cleaning column and the collection tube are two of the components in the total RNA isolation kit (see the Table of Materials).\nAdd 800 µL buffer RL2 to 500 µL of the supernatant from step 8.2, and mix gently.\n\tNOTE: Buffer RL2 is one of the components in the total RNA isolation kit (see the Table of Materials). Add 120 mL of anhydrous ethanol to 60 mL of buffer RL2 before use.",
    "Transfer 700 µL of the mixture from step 8.3 into the RNA-only column embedded in the collection tube, and centrifuge at 8,550 × g at 4 °C for 1 min.
