    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nChemical injections of embryos\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nIntroduce different agents, such as small-molecule inhibitors (in our case BI2536 and Centrinone) or vehicle control (in our case DMSO) into the developing embryo. This step should be performed when embryos are at the 1-cell stage.\nNote: A Lecia S9i stereomicroscope was used for injections along with microinjector and micromanipulator (see Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for information). A video description of microinjections can be found on JoVE (JoVE Science Education Database, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). https://www.jove.com/v/5130/zebrafish-microinjection-techniques[href=https://www.jove.com/v/5130/zebrafish-microinjection-techniques].\nInjection Set Up (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E)\nDilute the solution to be injected before beginning (in our case we injected DMSO concentration of 0.1%–1% and BI2536 or centrinone B final concentration of 100 nM or 1 μM diluted in embryo water).\nNote: We diluted 1.3 μL of 1 mM drug into 8.7 μL dH2O and 1.3 μL of 1 mM drug into 98.7 μL dH2O to achieve a final concentration of 1 μM and 100 nΜ upon injection of 1 nL of diluted drugs in fish embryo volume which we estimate to be 130 μm3.\nPrepare 10 μL of solution so that there is extra in case of needle breakage.\nTurn the injector on and open the gas tank.\nLet the injection plate warm up to 20°C–23°C.\nLoading the needle\nLoad the injection solution into the needle by using a pipette and needle-loading pipette tips (see Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for catalog number). Pipette tip needs to reach the end of the needle to verify there is minimal air present at the end of the needle. If any air bubbles are present in the injection solution, remove them using pipette suction.\nUnscrew the barrel piece from micromanipulator and insert the flat end of the needle. Then screw the barrel back into the micromanipulator.\nObtaining the embryos",
    "Pull the dividers the morning after fish are set up for breeding.\nNote: Zebrafish breed in the morning in the wild, so dividers should be pulled when fish room lights turn on (mimics sunrise).\nMove the inner mesh-bottomed tank (with the divider) to another outer tank with new system water.\nPull the divider to allow the fish to mix and breed.\nCollect the embryos (see Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]):\nRemove the fish by placing the inner mesh-bottomed tank (with the fish) into a separate outer tank filled with system water.\nPour the system water containing the embryos through a white mesh net to collect the embryos.\nFill the empty tank with more system water and run it through the white mesh net a second time to ensure that all the embryos were collected.\nFill a Petri dish with embryo water and label it with the parent’s transgenic line as well as the embryo’s date of birth.\nReverse the white mesh net to have the embryos facing outward toward the water.\nGently touch the embryos to the water within the Petri dish. They should stick and sink to the bottom.\nBring embryos to injection station.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. Video of embryo collection\nTo collect embryos, move the inner mesh tank with fish in it to a new outer tank containing fresh fish system water. Run the water containing embryos through the mesh net to collect embryos. Reverse the net outward then gently touch the embryos to the embryo water surface in Petri dish. The embryos are ready for incubation. Relate to (Chemical Injections of Embryo, step 3b).\nPreparing embryos for injection\nAdd embryo water to the injection plate.",
    "Transfer the embryos carefully to the plate using a transfer pipette (refer to Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for catalog number).\nUsing a glass pipette with a melted tip, carefully push the embryos into the troughs. Be sure to leave space at the end of each row to make removing embryos from the rows easier (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for example).\nCalibrating your needle\nUsing the Stereomicroscope, cut the needle with forceps. The needles are fused at the end when made with a needle puller. Verify that the needle is no longer fused after cutting so that liquid can flow through the needle.\nNote: The location that the needle is cut by the forceps determines the thickness/flexibility of the needle. If the needle is too thin, it will be too flimsy to poke through the chorion without breaking. If this is the case, the needle can be cut again with forceps to remove a bit more length. However, the needle also needs to be thin enough to poke through the chorion and embryos without causing significant damage. If the needle is causing significant damage to the embryo upon injection, a new needle should be loaded and cut.\nAfter cutting the needle, zoom into 5× magnification on the microscope (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Adjust the injection time and pressure (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) until a liquid droplet that is 6 μm in diameter is formed. This produces a droplet of approximately 1 nL.\nNote: If the liquid droplet is changing in size, the balance on the microinjector (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) needs to be adjusted with the balance knob. Turn this knob gently until the droplet maintains a consistent size on the needle.\nOnce the needle is cut and calibrated, you are able to inject.\nInjecting",
    "Turn your injector plates until the troughs run at a diagonal. This will ensure that you do not puncture the agarose and break the needle (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C for example).\nPosition the needle so that the x axis knob on the micromanipulator is the only one you need to adjust to inject the embryos (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nTo inject, use the micromanipulator to puncture the embryo with the needle targeting the yolk. Press the foot pedal, remove the needle, and move the plate to the next embryo. Ensure that the needle is removed from the embryo before the plate is adjusted so that the embryo is not damaged.\nAfter injecting\nOnce done, carefully adjust the micromanipulator to bring the needle as high as possible above the plate. Remove the needle from the micromanipulator and dispose of it in the sharp’s container.\nUse the glass pipette with melted tip to remove the embryos from their troughs. Push the embryo upwards to dislodge it and collect embryos in a 60 mm petri-plate for incubation at 28.5°C until fixing/imaging.\nUsing DI water, rinse the agarose plate and store upside down in the refrigerator.\nTurn off the microinjector and close the gas tank.\nAgarose mounting for live imaging\nTiming: 15–30 min\nLive visualization of subcellular structures (in our case we image the centrosomes) in the early zebrafish embryos starting at 4-cell stage and up to post mid-blastula transition.\nNote: Transgenic lines or embryos with fluorescently tagged structures are required for this option (in our case we used the centrin-GFP line).\nWait until the embryos reach the 4-cell stage (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C for example; refer to Kimmel et al. (1995)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] for more detailed staging of the developing zebrafish embryo).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/436-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Staging of zebrafish embryos to determine fixation time",
    "Zebrafish embryo developmental stages starting with the 1-cell stage (A), 2-cell stage (B), 4-cell stage (C), 8-cell stage (D), and 16-cell stage (E) are shown. Scale bar, 50 mm. Arrows indicate stage at which 8- and 16-cell stage embryos should be fixed.\nUsing a disposable transfer pipette move the embryos to matTek plate (containing glass coverslip bottom; see Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nRemove as much embryo water as possible.\nAdd ∼300–500 μL low melting point agarose to the matTek plate coverslip. The agarose melts at 65.5°C (we set our heat block to 70°C). As hot agarose will damage the embryos, ensure that the agarose cools slightly before covering embryos. Agarose should be warm enough to remain liquid, but not hot enough to harm live embryos.\nUsing a 1 mL syringe needle, spread the agarose to cover the embryos and coverslip of the matTek plate. It is important to completely cover the glass coverslip by contacting all edges to ensure that the agarose and embryos do not move during imaging.\nUsing the tip of the syringe needle, rotate the embryos so that the cells are facing downwards (toward the coverslip).\nCritical: Make sure to be as gentle as possible when rotating the embryos so that chorion is not pierced with the syringe needle. Pressure change from puncturing the chorion will result in embryo loss.\nGently push the embryos using the syringe needle to place them as close to the coverslip as possible.\nAllow the agarose to solidify (1–2 min). Agarose will turn slightly opaque when set.\nAdd embryo water to matTek dish to prevent agarose from over drying and shrinking while imaging.\nEmbryos are ready for immediate live imaging.",
    "If imaging at a later stage, in our case 8- and 16-cell stages, wait until the agarose-mounted embryos reach the appropriate stage (outlined in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S2. Agarose mounting live embryos\nWhen embryos reach the 4-cell stage, move them to a matTek plate. Remove as much embryo water as possible then add ∼300–500 μL low melting point agarose. Use a 1 mL syringe needle to spread the agarose to cover the embryos and coverslip of the matTek plate. Rotate the embryos so that the cells are facing downwards (toward the coverslip). Gently push the embryos using the needle to place them as close to the coverslip as possible. Allow the agarose to solidify then add embryo water to matTek dish to prevent agarose from over drying and shrinking while imaging. Relate to (Agarose Mounting for Live Imaging, steps 8–17).\nImmunohistochemistry of Zebrafish embryos\nTiming: 11 h to 2 days\nVisualize subcellular structures (such as the centrosomes) of a zebrafish embryo. In our experiments we used this protocol on embryos ranging from 4 cell stage to post mid-blastula transition, but it can be used on embryos beyond these stages.\nCritical: After injection check the embryos often (every 5 min) to gauge their developmental stage and fix when appropriate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nOnce at the desired developmental stage (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), transfer embryos into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube\nReplace embryo water with fixing solution pre-warmed to 28.5°C.\nIncubate embryos in fixing solution for 2 h at 20°C–23°C with frequent and gentle agitation.\nIncubate tubes containing embryos and fixing solution at 4°C for 8–24 h.\nRemove fixing solution and wash embryos from previous step with PBST three times, 5 min each.\nDechorionate the embryos:",
    "Transfer embryos into a 60 mm plate containing PBST and remove chorions using forceps with thin tips.\nTransfer the embryos back into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nRemove PBST and block by adding 1 mL fish wash solution.\nIncubate embryos in fish wash solution for 1 h at 20°C–23°C.\nRemove fish wash solution and incubate embryos in 200 μL primary antibody solution (in our case, we used antibodies against human γ-tubulin at 1:200 dilution in fish wash solution).\nFirst option: incubate for 4 h at 20°C–23°C.\nSecond option: incubate 8–24 h at 4°C.\nNote: We recommend the second incubation option.\nPause Point: The experiment can be paused for up to 24 h while embryos are incubating in primary antibody.\nRemove primary antibody solution and wash embryos 5 times with fish wash solution. Wash steps should be 5 min each.\nIncubate embryos in fish wash solution for 30–60 min at 20°C–23°C to block.\nRemove fish wash solution and incubate embryos in secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in wash solution. Incubation time should not exceed that used for primary antibodies.\nFirst option: incubate for 8–24 h at 4°C (only if embryos were incubated in primary antibodies for 8–24 h).\nSecond option: incubate for 3–4 h 20°C–23°C.\nNote: The length of incubation time in secondary antibody solution should not exceed time of incubation in primary antibody solution.\nRemove secondary antibody solution and wash embryos 5 times with fish wash solution. Wash steps should be 5 min each.\nOptional: Incubate embryos in DAPI diluted 1:1,000 in 1× PBS for 1.5 h at 20°C–23°C. Wash embryos with 1× PBS 3 times. Washes should be 5 min each.\nChoice 1: Agarose mounting fixed embryos\nTiming: 15–30 min",
    "This protocol was performed on embryos ranging from 8 cell stage to post mid-blastula transition, but it can be used on embryos beyond these stages.\nUsing a disposable transfer pipette, move the fixed and stained embryos to matTek plate (containing glass coverslip bottom).\nUsing 1 mL syringe with needle, remove as much embryo water as possible (refer to Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] for agarose mounting technique).\nAdd ∼ 300–500 μL low melting agarose to the matTek plate coverslip.\nUsing a 1 mL syringe with needle, spread the agarose to cover the embryos and coverslip of the matTek plate.

Schematic of the hard-mounting procedure of zebrafish embryo cells\nThe procedure begins by placing the embryos on glass slide (A). The needle tips of the 1 mL syringes are used to separate cells from yolk (B–D). The separated cells are oriented such that the yolk-free side (side that was not attached to yolk) is facing away from glass slide (E). The cover slip is placed on top of the cells after applying ProLong (F).\nPlace embryos on glass slide.",
    "Use two 1 mL syringes attached to 28-gauge × 0.5 inch separate the cell mass from the yolk (as in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5D). Start by placing the tips of the syringe needles on either end of the cells. Use one needle to hold the cells while lifting thus separating the cell mass. Repeat for every embryo.\nRemove as much yolk as possible from the slides using a transfer pipette as excess yolk debris can obstruct visualizing embryonic cells.\nNote: Transfer pipette should be enough to remove most yolk, a few remaining particles should not cause a problem with imaging.\nFlip the embryo so that the tops of the cells (the side that was not attached to the yolk) is facing away from the glass slide (refer to Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nRemove as much PBS as possible using a 1 mL syringe.\nAdd 40 μL of ProLong to one side of the cells on the glass slide.\nPlace a No. 1.5 square (22 mm) coverslip on the same side making sure it touches the ProLong, then slowly lower the coverslip.\nApply gentle pressure to the coverslip ensure cells are flattened and ProLong is distributed across the coverslip and embryos. Avoid air bubbles.\nAllow ProLong on slides to harden for 24 h at 20°C–23°C and in the dark before imaging.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S3. Hard-mounting fixed embryos",
    "To hard-mount fixed embryos, transfer the embryos onto a glass slide. Separate the cell mass from the yolk using the needles of two 1 mL syringes. Remove the yolk from the slide and flip the cells so that the tops of the cells are facing away from the glass slide. Remove excess PBS using a 1 mL syringe. Add 40 μL ProLong onto the glass slide on one side of the cells. Place the edge of coverslip so that it touches ProLong then carefully lower the coverslip. Apply gentle pressure to flatten the cells.
