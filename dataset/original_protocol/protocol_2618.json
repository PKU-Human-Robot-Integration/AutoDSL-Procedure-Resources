    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHere we describe the steps for performing 150 siRNAs library plate screen on top of collagen.\nLabel WM266-4 cells with CellTracker orange\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes how to label cells prior to transfection.\nA day before transfections, label cells growing in 75 cm2 flasks with 2 μM CellTracker Orange CMTMR dye:\nRemove growth medium from the flasks and wash cells with PBS twice.\nDilute CellTracker in DMEM (1:10000) without FBS and add to the cells, 10 mL per 75 cm2 flasks. Incubate flasks for 30 min at 37°C 5% CO2.\nRemove medium with CellTracker, wash once with PBS and add fresh medium with 10% FBS and 5% penicillin/streptomycin.\nNote: Cell were labelled with Cell tracker in order to avoid staining/washes with other antibodies to minimise the risk to detach the collagen. It is always best to let the cells recover a couple of hours before transfection.\nReverse transfection\nTiming: Approximately 1 h depending on how many assay plates are needed\nHere we describe siRNA reverse transfection of WM226-4 cells in 96 well plates.\nPrior to seeding cells, add 20 μL/well of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) containing 160 nL/well Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) into the assay plates containing the siRNAs using a Multidrop Combi Reagent Dispenser (ThermoFisher). Incubate plates for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nFor all wells containing siRNA and a subset of control wells, seed approximately 5,000 cells/well in 80 μL of complete medium. Total volume per well 100 μL.\nIncubate plates with transfected cells for 24 h at 37°C.\nTransfer transfected cells on top of collagen plates\nTiming: 2–3 h depending on how many collagen plates are needed\nHere, we describe how to prepare 96 well plates with soft collagen and seed cells on top of collagen, one day after transfection.",
    "Prepare rat tail type I collagen mix on ice:\nIn a Falcon tube prepare collagen mix, add the HEPES buffer last and check the pH is 7.5.\nMix collagen slowly, avoid introducing bubbles.\nPour collagen mix into a reagent reservoir on ice and aliquot 100 μL collagen mix into 96 well cell carrier imaging plates (PerkinElmer):\nSpin plates at 112 × g and place in an incubator at 37°C for 1 h. If not used that day, then need to be stored in the fridge.\nLift transfected cells by trypsinization, where add 20 μL trypsin-EDTA (0.25%)/well for 1 min and then 80 μL medium /well. Transfer in total 100 μL transfected cells in medium on top of 100 μL/well rat tail type I polymerised collagen:\nSpin cells on top of collagen at 112 × g for 2 min and incubate plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nNote: We recommend seeding cells on top of collagen straight after collagen has polymerized.\nFixation\nTiming: Fixation 1 h per plate\nCells on top of 100 μL collagen/well plates to be fixed after 24 h incubation:\nFix cells after 24 h incubation by adding 100 μL of pre-warmed 8% methanol free formaldehyde (ThermoFisher) containing 5 μg/mL Hoechst stain (Sigma) and incubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C. Do not remove fixation solution to avoid disturbing the collagen material.\nNote: Cells were fixed after 24 h on top of collagen so in total 48 h post transfection. Plates can be kept in the fridge.\nImage acquisition\nTiming: Imaging variable per plate\nThese steps describe the image acquisition using the Opera high throughput system QEHS (PerkinElmer). Images of the wells are acquired in automated fashion.\nSet up the microscope settings and place plate into the imaging platform.",
    "Define the plate type (96 well cell carrier plates).\nSelect the appropriate objective, lasers and filters.\nDetermine microscope settings, exposure time and z-positions.\nSelect a well and find focus height using the Z-stack. Cells are found at different planes so determine the bottom of the stack and start imaging in depths of approximately 350–600 μm.\nImage plates with a high NA 20× air immersion objective.\nDefine the plate layout and number of fields per well (15 fields per well). Save experimental design.\nGo to run experiment, name it, and start the run.\nAfter the run is finished import data into the Columbus analysis software. Plates can be batch imported and batch analysed.\nNote: These are the settings that work most effectively for us. However, each setting can be adapted for specific cell types or different volumes of collagen per well.\nCritical: It is important to avoid imaging the edges of the wells to prevent the meniscus effect and focus failure."
