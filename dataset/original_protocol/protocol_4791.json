    "F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici wild type strain 4287 (race 2) was obtained from J. Tello, Universidad de Almeria, Spain. Δcon7-1 and cΔcon7-1 strains were described previously (Ruiz-Roldan et al., 20015). Strains are stored at -80 °C with 30 % glycerol as microconidial suspension. For fresh microconidia production, aliquots of frozen microconidial stocks are inoculated into 100 ml of potato dextrose broth (PDB) and incubated for 3 days at 150 rpm and 28 °C in an orbital incubator. Cultures are then filtered through Monodur nylon filters placed on funnels to separate mycelia (Figure 1A), and centrifuged at 3,020 x g for 5 min to collect microconidia. Finally, pellets containing fresh microconidia are resuspended into 1 ml sterile dH2O and counted using a hemocytometer. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160714/20160714005253_9405.jpgFigure 1. Filtration and mycelia harvesting procedure. A. Filtration of a fungal culture through a Monodur nylon membrane placed on a funnel. B. Subsequent harvesting of mycelia by scraping a nylon membrane using a spatula.Aliquots containing 2.5 x 108 fresh microconidia are grown in 100 ml PDB at 170 rpm and 28 °C for 14 h (wild-type and cΔcon7-1 strains) or 24 h (Δcon7-1 mutant). After harvesting by Monodur filtration, mycelia are washed twice with sterile dH2O, separated from the filter by scraping using a spatula (Figure 1B) and transferred to 2 ml-Eppendorf tubes containing a 5 mm-diameter glass bead. Cells are resuspended into 1 ml of extraction buffer (380 mM trichloroacetic acid and 12.7 mM EDTA) and disrupted by 3 cycles of 30 sec agitation each using a Mini-BeadBeater homogenizer, followed by incubation at room temperature with shaking at 250 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant is harvested by centrifugation at 11,336 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (10 μl each) are used for quantification of ATP levels using the ATP determination kit (http://tools.",
    "thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp22066.pdf[href=http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp22066.pdf]) following these instructions of the manufacturer with some modifications (indicated in underlines):Reagent preparationMake 1.0 ml of 1x Reaction Buffer by adding 50 μl of 20x Reaction Buffer (Component E) to 950 μl of deionized water (dH2O). This volume will be sufficient to make 1 ml of 10 mM D-luciferin stock solution.Make 1 ml of a 10 mM D-luciferin stock solution by adding 1 ml of 1x Reaction Buffer (prepared in the previous step) to one vial of D-luciferin (Component A, blue cap). Protect from light until use. The D-luciferin stock solution is reasonably stable for several weeks if stored at ≤ -20 °C, protected from light.Prepare a 100 mM DTT stock solution by adding 1.62 ml of dH2O to the bottle containing 25 mg of DTT (Component C, black cap). Aliquot into ten 160 μl volumes and store frozen at ≤ -20 °C. Stock solutions of DTT stored properly are stable for six months to one year. Thawed aliquots are kept on ice or at 4°C until use.Prepare low-concentration ATP standard solutions by diluting the 5 mM ATP solution (Component D, green cap) in dH2O. The concentrations and volumes to make depend upon the sensitivity and the luminometer used. Typically, ATP concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 1 μM are appropriate. These dilute solutions are stable for several weeks when stored at ≤ -20°C.Standard reaction solutionThe manufacturer suggests combining the components of the reaction as follows to make 10 ml of a standard reaction solution. Adjust the volumes according to particular requirements.8.9 ml dH2O0.5 ml 20x Reaction Buffer (Component E)0.1 ml 0.1 M DTT (from the previous step)0.5 ml of 10 mM D-luciferin (from the previous step, store the remaining 0.5 ml at ≤ -20 °C for up to several weeks)2.",
    "5 μl of firefly luciferase 5 mg/ml stock solutionGently invert the tube to mix, do not vortex; the firefly luciferase enzyme is easily denatured. Keep the reaction solution protected from light until use, it can be stored at 2-6 °C protected from light for several days.Standard curvePlace 190 µl aliquots of the standard reaction solution (prepared in previous steps) in a microtiter plate and measure the background luminescence using a flurorometer.Start the reaction by adding 10 µl of diluted ATP standard solutions (prepared in previous steps) and read the luminescence. The volume of the dilute ATP standard solution that is added to the standard assay solution (prepared in the previous step) should be less than 10% of the total assay volume. For example, a 100 μl total assay volume should contain 10 μl or less of the ATP standard solution.Subtract the background luminescence.Generate a standard curve for a series of ATP concentrations (Figure 2). Be sure to always add a constant sample volume of the ATP containing solution. R-values of around 0.9 are normally obtained with this kit.Sample analysisFollow the directions given in Standard Curve, substituting ATP standard solutions for 10 µl fungal experimental samples. Please note that the total volume of the experimental sample assays should be equal to that of the ATP standard assays, with the amount of sample added amounting to no more than 10% of the total assay volume.Calculate the amount of ATP in the experimental samples from the standard curve. The assay is repeated three times with independent biological samples."
