    "Sample preparation   Fix whole mice by perfusion.   Set up perfusion system consisted of needle, tubing, peristaltic pump and beakers with PBS (ice-cold) or 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (ice-cold).   Anesthetize mice and expose hearts by surgery.   Insert the needle into the left ventricle and make a hole in the right atrium.   Remove blood from mice by perfusion (8 ml/min) with PBS (ice-cold).   Fix mice by perfusion (8 ml/min) with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (ice-cold).     Isolate colons and cut them up into small pieces (~1.5 mm thick).   Fix again with 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h at 4 °C.   Wash samples by 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 8% sucrose.   Dehydrate samples with a series of ethanol as follows.   25% ethanol, 10 min at 4 °C    60% ethanol, 30 minu at -30 °C   80% ethanol, 30 min at -30 °C   99% ethanol, 30 min at -30 °C   99% ethanol, 10 min at RT   100% ethanol, two changes, 10 min each at RT     To promote the infiltration of resin, remove ethanol with propylene oxide as follows.   Ethanol-propylene oxide (2:1), 10 min at RT   Ethanol-propylene oxide (1:1), 10 min at RT   Ethanol-propylene oxide (1:2), 10 min at RT   Propylene oxide, 20 minutes at RT      Make resin infiltrate into samples by immersion as follows.   Propylene oxide-LR White containing accelerator (3:1), 2 h at RT   Propylene oxide-LR White containing accelerator (1:1), 2 h at RT   Propylene oxide-LR White containing accelerator (1:3), 2 h at RT   LR White containing accelerator, 12 h at RT     Polymerize resin under UV irradiation for two days at RT.   Cut the embedded samples (90 nm thick) with ultra microtome and mount on uncoated gold grids (300 mesh).",
    "Immunostaining   Treat sections with 3% (vol/vol) hydrogen peroxide for 30 min at RT to unmask epitope.   Wash sections with distilled water.   Treat sections with antigen-retrieval solution for 15 min under microwave at 95 °C by interval of 2 sec.   Block sections with 0.1% gelatin in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min at 37 °C.   Reacted sections with primary antibodies diluted with PBST overnight at RT.   Wash sections three times with PBST for 10 min each at RT.   React sections with 10-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted with PBST for 2 h at RT.   Wash sections twice with PBST for 10 min each at RT.   Wash sections twice with distilled water for 5 min each at RT.   Stain sections with 4% uranyl acetate for 10 min at RT.   Wash sections with distilled water.   Observe sections with an electron microscope."
