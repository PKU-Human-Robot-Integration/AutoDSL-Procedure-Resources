    "All procedures are conducted at room temperature (~23 °C) unless otherwise noted.\n1. Fabrication of Silicon Master\nClean silicon wafer with 100% ethanol or xylene and dry under O2/N2 gas.\nPlace silicon wafer in spin-coater at rotation speeds of 2,000-4,000 rpm to produce a 0.3-0.5 µm thick film.\nPattern the photoresist film with the correct dimensions by using a photolithography system\nFully immerse the patterned photoresist-coated silicon wafers in an appropriate volume of photoresist developing solution.\nRinse the developed photoresist-coated silicon wafers with deionized water.\nTo form arrays of sub-micron scale ridges with near vertical side walls, deep reactive ion etch the exposed silicon using an etching system.\nRemove the remaining photoresist by placing the silicon wafer in a plasma asher system.\nCut the silicon wafers with a diamond-tipped cutter into the appropriately sized silicon masters for subsequent replica molding.\n2. Fabrication of PUA Mold from Silicon Master\nNOTE: Volume to be added to silicon master for nanofabrication will vary depending on the area of the nanopatterned master to be replicated as well as the viscosity of the polyurethane acrylate (PUA) solution.\nClean silicon master surface with 100% ethanol or xylene and dry under O2/N2 gas.\nPlace silicon master pattern side up in a Petri dish.\nFor a silicon master with a 2 cm x 2 cm surface pattern, pipette 40 µl of PUA to the pattern surface.\nPlace a sheet of 4 cm x 4 cm transparent polyester (PET) film over the dispensed PUA.\nPress down on the PET sheet and spread the PUA underneath the sheet across the pattern face using a roller or flat edged surface (such as a card) so that the entire pattern is covered by the PUA prepolymer.",
    "Place silicon master, prepolymer, and PET approximately 10 cm below a 20 Watt (115 V) UV light (λ = 365 nm) for 50 sec. To be effective, the UV light wavelength can be anywhere between 310-400 nm. The intensity of the light is 10-15 mW/cm2 at the surface of the substrate.\nAfter curing, remove PET film slowly with forceps. PUA should attach to the PET film with a negative of the silicon master nanopattern.\nCure PUA/PET nanopatterns under UV for at least 12 hr prior to use. Overexposure is not an issue.\nTo clean silicon masters, place another film of PET on top of the master without the addition of PUA and expose to UV light (λ = 365 nm) for 50 sec and remove PET film. This will remove any unreacted monomers.\nRinse silicon master with 100% ethanol or xylene and dry under O2/N2 gas.\n3a. Nanopatterning Polyurethane Polymer\nPrepare 25 mm diameter circular glass slides by placing in an ozone treatment chamber for 10 min.\nPlace ozone-treated glass slides onto small PDMS block for easy handling.\nApply thin layer of surface adhesion promoter with paintbrush to glass slides. Air dry glass slides for 30 min.\nPlace the glass slide on a piece of printer paper.\nDrop dispense 10 μl of polyurethane (PU) pre-polymer (NOA 76) to center of glass slide. Make sure no bubbles are present after addition.\nPlace PUA mold, pattern face down, onto the glass slide. Disperse the PU uniformly across the surface of the glass slide by rolling a rubber cylinder roller along the PUA mold. Printer paper will absorb polymer overflow.\nWatt UV lamp. Polymerization time of the PU is dependent on power of UV source.",
    "Remove the sample from UV light source and carefully peel the PUA mold from PU coated glass slide. Polymerization of the PU is considered complete when the PUA mold peels cleanly away from the sample and the PU glass slide has an iridescent appearance.\nPlace finished samples in desiccator for storage for as long as a month.\n3b. Nanopatterning Poly(Lactide-Co-Glycolide) Hydrogel\nCreate a flat PDMS mold by vigorously mixing silicone elastomer base and silicone elastomer curing agent in a 10:1 ratio.\nPour mixed PDMS precursor solution into a Petri dish so that the PDMS precursor reaches 5 mm up the edge of the dish (i.e. so that the PDMS is 5 mm thick).\nPlace Petri dish and PDMS precursor in a desiccator for 1 hr to degas.\nMove Petri dish and PDMS precursor into a 65 °C oven for at least 2 hr to cure.\nAfter PDMS is cured, use a razor to cut the flat PDMS into 3 cm x 3 cm square sections. These will be the flat PDMS molds used later in the patterning process.\nClean 25 mm diameter circular glass slides by placing in isopropyl alcohol for 30 min in a water sonicator.\nDry cleaned glass slides under O2/N2 gas.\nDrop dispense 100 μl of PLGA solution (15% w/v PLGA in chloroform) onto glass slide.\nPlace a flat PDMS mold on top of the dispensed PLGA to absorb the solvent and obtain a flat PLGA surface. Apply a light pressure (~10 kPa) by placing a 200 g weight on top of the PDMS for 5 min.\nSlowly peel away flat PDMS mold and place the cover glass on a preheated plate (120 °C) for 5 min to remove residual solvent and increase adhesion between the PLGA and the cover glass.",
    "Place the NP PUA mold on top of the flat PLGA and apply constant pressure (~100 kPa) and heat (120 °C) by placing a 1 kg weight on top of the PUA mold while on the heating plate for 15 min.\nRemove the weight from PLGA cover slide and allow the substrata to cool to room temperature. Do not remove PUA mold until the substrata have been cooled.\nOnce the substrata have sufficiently cooled, carefully peel away the NP PUA mold, revealing the NP PLGA substratum. The NP PLGA substratum should have an iridescent appearance.\nPlace finished samples in desiccator for storage for as long as a month.\n4. Cell Seeding and Culture\nNOTE: This protocol describes the culture of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and H7 human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) but other cell sources may be used.\nAttach the ANFS coverslips (PU or PLGA) to a 35 mm tissue culture polystyrene dish. Pipette 20 µl of Norland Optical Adhesive (NOA83H) to the bottom of the dish and gently place the ANFS coverslip on top of the NOA. Allow glue to spread out and cover entire coverslip bottom. Cure NOA by exposing dish to UV for 10 min.\nSterilize ANFS by rinsing with 2 ml of 70% aqueous ethanol solution for 5 min, twice. Remove ethanol by aspiration. Allow ANFS to completely air dry for ~1 hr under the UV sterilization lamp (λ = 200-290 nm) in the biological safety cabinet.\nCellular adhesion is enhanced by coating the ANFS in fibronectin overnight. Dilute fibronectin in DI water to 5 µg/ml. Pipette 2 ml of fibronectin solution into dish. Place in incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight (at least 6 hr).\nObtain NRVMs, hESC-CMs, or other cardiac cells of interest according to previous protocols22.",
    "Centrifuge cell sample at 1,000 rpm for 3 min to pellet the cells.\nCarefully remove the supernatant by aspiration. Make sure not to disturb the pellet.\nResuspend cells in appropriate culture media to a concentration of 4.6 x 106 cells/ml.\nCarefully pipette 200 µl of cell suspension onto sterilized ANFS. Make sure cell suspension remains on the coverslip.\nPlace cells in incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 hr to allow cells to attach to ANFS.\nAdd 2 ml of warm culture media to dish and replace cells in incubator under the same conditions.\nAfter 24 hr, remove media and wash with 2 ml of DPBS twice to remove excess cells.\nAdd 2 ml of warm culture media to dish and replace cells in incubator under the same conditions. Culture the cells to confluence. Replace media every other day.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
