    "NOTE: The research conducted to develop this protocol was performed in compliance with New York State Psychiatric Institute Institutional Review Board guidelines (IRB #7655). One subject was scanned for recording the protocol video, and written informed consent was obtained. Refer to the Table of Materials for details about the MRI scanner used in this protocol.\n1. MRI acquisition parameters\nPrepare to acquire high-resolution T1w images using a 3D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with the following parameters: spatial resolution = 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm3; field-of-view (FOV) = 176 x 240 x 240 mm3; echo time (TE) = 3.43 ms; repetition time (TR) = 2462 ms; inversion time (TI) = 1060 ms; flip angle = 8°; in-plane parallel imaging factor (ARC) = 2; through-plane parallel imaging factor (ARC) = 233; bandwidth = 208 Hz/pixel; total acquisition time = 6 min 39 s.\nPrepare to acquire NM-MRI images using a two-dimensional (2D) gradient recalled echo sequence with magnetization transfer contrast (2D GRE-MTC) with the following parameters: resolution = 0.43 x 0.43 mm2; FOV = 220 x 220 mm2; slice-thickness = 1.5 mm; 20 slices; slice gap = 0 mm; TE = 4.8 ms; TR = 500 ms; flip angle = 40°; bandwidth = 122 Hz/pixel; MT frequency offset = 1.2 kHz; MT pulse duration = 8 ms; MT flip angle = 670°; number of averages = 5; total acquisition time = 10 min 4 s.\n\tNOTE: Although the displayed results used these MRI acquisition parameters, this protocol is valid for various T1w and NM-MRI imaging protocols. The NM-MRI protocol should cover ~25 mm in the inferior-superior direction to guarantee complete coverage of the SN.\n2. Placement of NM-MRI volume",
    "Acquire a high-resolution T1w image (≤1 mm isotropic voxel size). Use online reformatting directly after image acquisition to create high-resolution T1w images aligned to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line and the midline.\n\t\nCarry out online reformatting using the vendor-provided software (e.g., if acquiring data on a GE scanner: MultiPlanar Reconstruction (MPR) in Planning; if acquiring data on a Siemens scanner: MPR in the 3D Task Card; if acquiring data on a Philips scanner: MPR in the Render Mode of the VolumeView Package).\n\t\t\nCreate multiplanar reconstructions of the 3D T1w image in the axial plane perpendicular to the AC-PC line to cover the whole brain with minimal slice-gap.\nCreate multiplanar reconstructions of the 3D T1w image in the coronal plane perpendicular to the AC-PC line to cover the whole brain with minimal slice-gap.\nCreate multiplanar reconstructions of the 3D T1w image in the sagittal plane parallel to the AC-PC line to cover the whole brain with minimal slice-gap.\nLoad the sagittal, coronal, and axial views of the reformatted high-resolution T1w image and ensure that reference lines depicting the location of each displayed slice are present.\nIdentify the sagittal image that shows the largest separation between the midbrain and thalamus (Figure 1A). To do this, visually inspect the sagittal slices of the reformatted T1w image until the slice showing this greatest separation is identified.\nUsing the sagittal image from the end of step 2.3, visually identify the coronal plane that delineates the most anterior aspect of the midbrain (Figure 1B).\nUsing the coronal image from the end of step 2.4, visually identify the axial plane that delineates the inferior aspect of the third ventricle (Figure 1C).",
    "On the sagittal image from the end of step 2.3, align the superior boundary of the NM-MRI volume to the axial plane identified in step 2.5 (Figure 1D).\nMove the superior boundary of the NM-MRI volume 3 mm in the superior direction (Figure 1E).\nAlign the NM-MRI volume to the midline in the axial and coronal images (Figure 1F).\nAcquire the NM-MRI images.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62493/62493fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Images displaying the step-by-step NM-MRI volume placement procedure. Yellow lines indicate the location of the slices used for volume placement as described in the protocol. (A) First, the sagittal image with the greatest separation between the midbrain and thalamus is identified (step 2.3 of the protocol). (B) Second, using the image from A, the coronal plane delineating the most anterior aspect of the midbrain is identified (step 2.4). (C) Third, on the coronal image from the plane identified in B, the axial plane delineating the inferior aspect of the third ventricle is identified (step 2.5). (D) Fourth, the axial plane identified in C is displayed on the sagittal image from A (step 2.6). (E) Fifth, the axial plane from D is shifted 3 mm in the superior direction, and this plane indicates the superior boundary of the NM-MRI volume (step 2.7). (F) The final NM-MRI volume placement where the coronal image corresponds to C, the sagittal image corresponds to A, and the axial image corresponds to the axial plane in E. The NM-MRI volume is aligned to the brain midline in the coronal and axial images and the AC-PC line in the sagittal image (step 2.8).

    "3. Quality control checks\nEnsure that the acquired NM-MRI images cover the entire SN and that the SN is visible in the central images but not in the most superior or most inferior images of the NM-MRI volume. Otherwise (Figure 2), repeat steps 2.3-2.9 to ensure correct NM-MRI volume placement. If the participant has moved significantly since the acquisition of the high-resolution T1w scan, repeat steps 2.1-2.9.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62493/62493fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Example of an NM-MRI acquisition that failed the first quality control check (step 3.1 of the protocol). Each of the 20 NM-MRI slices displayed from most inferior (top left image) to most superior (bottom right image); the image window/level was set to exaggerate the contrast between the substantia nigra and crus cerebri. The orange arrows in slices 15-19 show the location of the substantia nigra in those slices. The red arrow in the most superior slice (slice 20) shows that the substantia nigra is still visible in this slice, and thus, the acquisition fails the quality check.

For example, this may appear as a low-intensity region that is flanked by two high-intensity regions.\nIf the artifact is the result of blood vessels (Figure 3A), retain the NM-MRI images because these artifacts will most likely always be present.\nIf the artifacts are the result of participant head motion (Figure 3B), remind the participant to stay as still as possible and reacquire the NM-MRI images according to step 3.2.5.",
    "If the artifacts are ambiguous (Figure 3C), reacquire the NM-MRI images according to step 3.2.5. Upon reacquisition, if the artifacts remain present, proceed with these images as they are likely biological rather than a result of acquisition issues.\nIf the NM-MRI images pass the quality control check in step 3.1, copy the previous NM-MRI volume placement. If the NM-MRI images fail the quality control check in step 3.1, repeat steps 2.3-2.9 to ensure correct NM-MRI volume placement (or steps 2.1-2.9 if the participant moved significantly).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62493/62493fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Examples of NM-MRI acquisitions that failed the second quality control check (step 3.2 of the protocol).
