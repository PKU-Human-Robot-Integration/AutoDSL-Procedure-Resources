    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFor quantification of live cell ruffles, follow steps 1–15; for quantification of fixed cell ruffles, follow steps 16–22.\nLive cell quantification: Initial image processing (optional)\nTiming: 5–15 min\nHere we outline the steps for initial processing of the data collected from before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] steps 1–18. Initial image processing is performed in FIJI/ImageJ (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for download link). While image processing is not always necessary for analysis, it can make analysis easier and is highly recommended for display purposes. The following steps can be adapted as necessary as some may be unnecessary based on the quality of the image and/or the system used.\nDrift/jitter correction: Often during live imaging there can be problems with drift if the system is not very stable (temperature or stage/dish stability).\nTo correct drift, run the FIJI/ImageJ plugin: Plugins › Registration › Correct 3D drift.\nAfter drift/jitter correction, crop out the black bars around the stack by drawing a rectangular ROI and running Image › Crop.\nNote: Jittering in the movies can occur during multi-point image acquisition, especially if the imaging regions are far apart. Both problems can be corrected using the Correct 3D drift plugin. The default settings work well in most scenarios, however, if processing speed is slow and/or the results are unsatisfactory, draw a rectangular region of interest (ROI) around a relatively unmoving part of the time series (e.g., a non-migratory cell) to calculate the stabilization on the contents of the ROI.\nBackground subtraction: The following background subtraction script can be run using the FIJI/ImageJ macro tool: Plugins › New › Macro.\nwaitForUser(\"Draw an ROI to indicate the background, then press OK\");\nfor (i=1; i<=nSlices; i++) {\n    setSlice(i);\n    getStatistics(area, mean);\n    run(\"Select None\");\n    run(\"Subtract...\", \"value=\"+mean);\n    run(\"Restore Selection\");\n    }\nrun(\"Select None\");",
    "Note: Subtracting the background of a time-series is often critical for distinguishing the signal from the background noise and is necessary before proper bleach correction.\nBleach correction: After background subtraction, bleach correction can then be used as necessary: Image › Adjust › Bleach Correction.\nNote: The Bleach Correction plugin provides three methods: Simple Ratio, Exponential Fit, and Histogram Matching. Exponential Fit is the typically preferred method; however, results can vary depending on the experimental setup.\nCritical: Because bleach correction is changing the values of your data, care must be taken to preserve its meaning. It is usually necessary to crop the time series that is to be analyzed before bleach correction to eliminate any debris or cells moving in and/or out of the field of view. If drift correction is required, it is almost always necessary to use at least some cropping before bleach correction (see step 1).\nSave the processed images as a separate file from the original data using the TIFF file format to preserve the original data and the quality of the processed data.\nLive cell quantification: Measurement of ruffles\nTiming: 1+ h\nHere we outline the method for measuring the data collected from before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] steps 1–18. While the actual measurement of ruffles is very simple, due to the difficulty in automating the process it can be time consuming. A large amount of information about ruffles, or many biological structures for that matter, can be derived by measuring the size of the structures over time. In the instance of ruffles, the simplest method is measuring the area. Here we outline a workflow for analysis using FIJI/ImageJ and a spreadsheet software (only basic functionality is required so any spreadsheet software will be appropriate, including free and open-source options).\nOpen FIJI/ImageJ.",
    "Drag an image set into FIJI such as the preprocessed data from the previous section and identify a cell forming or disassembling a ruffle within the duration of the time-series.\nSet-up the measurements in FIJI: Analyze › Set Measurements...\nSelect “Area” and “Display label”.\nUse an appropriate number of decimal places.\nGo to Analyze › Set Scale... to check if the pixel to distance conversion scale was imported. If not, the conversion can be entered.\nSelect the Freehand selections tool in FIJI.\nFor each frame of the ruffle, draw an ROI around the ruffle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) and then press Ctrl + M or M to run the Measure plugin (also Analyze › Measure).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1691-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Data management is key to successful analysis, and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] can be referred to for an example of formatting. For processing the data, we use a combination of basic spreadsheet functionality and the R programing language through the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Here, we will describe the data processing steps using spreadsheet software; however, experienced users of RStudio can accelerate this process by performing the calculations in RStudio.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1691_1.csv",
    "The lifetime, maximum area, and time of appearance variables are relatively self-explanatory and are easily acquired from the measurements made in the previous section (“Measurement of ruffles”).\nCalculate lifetime by taking the total number of frames the ruffle present and converting the value to time (e.g., when imaging every 30 s, a ruffle present for 15 frames will have a lifetime of 7.5 min).\nMaximum area is simply the largest area value for each ruffle, regardless of time point.\nCalculate time of appearance from the first row of the “Label” column of the ruffle area data (for example, t:10/61 in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B indicates that the ruffle appeared in frame 10).\nNote: Make sure to convert the value from frames to time and account for any frames acquired before growth factor treatment. Time 0 is the frame at which the growth factor was added.\nThe opening and closing rates are calculated by linear regression analysis of the linear portions of the ruffle opening and closing.\nOpening and closing rate are both calculated using the same principles. The opening and closing phases are defined as the linear portions of values starting from the first and last time-points respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nTo find the opening phase, determine the approximate region by eye and then calculate the R2 value for points before and after the approximate point. The end of the opening phase will be represented by a drop-off in the R2 value as the ruffle reaches maturity and the area stops increasing.\nOnce the opening phase is determined using R2 values, the slope of the resulting trend line is the rate of opening (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCalculate closing rate in the same way but instead start from the final value and work backward.",
    "Note: It may be necessary to define a minimum number of frames acceptable for an opening or closing phase as well as a minimum R2 value. While this will exclude some data, the resulting measurements will likely be more accurate as it will exclude ruffles that do not have sufficient temporal resolution or have too much variability to calculate an accurate rate. For example, a starting criterion could be a minimum of 4 frames for the opening and closing phases with an R2 value of 0.7 or greater.\nThe stability phase is defined as the time range between the final frame of the opening phase and the first frame of the closing phase (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nFor each measurement, enter the value in a spreadsheet using clean data principles (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for example) and saved as a file in CSV format.\nNote: For experienced users of R, or other programing languages, these data processing steps can be automated.\nFixed cell quantification: Analysis of ruffle area\nTiming: 15–30 min\nAfter collecting the images of actin and nuclei staining as outlined in before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] steps 19–42, the cells can be analyzed to quantify the average ruffle area/cell. Ruffles are characterized by a prominent increase in actin density. This allows for unbiased quantification of ruffles by means of a basic threshold which is set to include ruffles but exclude other actin structures such as stress fibers. While thresholding may occasionally separate other structures besides ruffles, the effect is generally insignificant.\nOpen each image individually by dragging it into FIJI.\nSet-up the measurements in FIJI: Analyze › Set Measurements...\nSelect “Area” and “Display label”.\nUse an appropriate number of decimal places.",
    "Go to Analyze › Set Scale... to check if the pixel to distance conversion scale was imported. If not, the conversion can be entered.\nRun Image › Adjust › Threshold... (or Ctrl + Shift + T).\nMake sure “Dark background” is selected.\nFor the first image analyzed, adjust the top slider to set the threshold for only the ruffles and make note of the threshold values (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1691-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example analysis of ruffle area\n(A) Workflow of image analysis used to calculate area covered by ruffles. Scale bar: 20 μm.\n(B) Image of nuclei used to count the number of cells. Scale bar: 20 μm.\nFor subsequent images, click “Set” and manually enter the threshold values used in the previous step.\nOptional: If images are noisy, use of a median filter (Process › Filters › Median...) before thresholding can increase the accuracy of the analysis by reducing the noise while preserving edges.\nRun Analyze › Analyze Particles...\nSet the size range of particles. Usually the default setting of 0-Infinity is appropriate unless there is noise that needs to be excluded based on size. Keep this value consistent across conditions.\nSelect “Summarize” and leave the other options unselected.\nClick “OK”.\nIf analyzing a multichannel image, select “No” when prompted to process all images.\nFrom the resulting Summary window, copy the “Total Area” value into a spreadsheet along with the number of cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) for the image as determined by the number of nuclei.\nNote: The units of the total area value will be in microns2 if the scale conversion was set in step 18 or imported with the image metadata. Otherwise, the area will be in pixels.\nIn the spreadsheet software:\nSum all total area values and cell number values for each condition.",
