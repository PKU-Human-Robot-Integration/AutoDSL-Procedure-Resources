    "1. Preparations\nDevelopment of γ-rays mutagenized populations\nTreat about 20,000 dried rice seeds (with moisture content of ca. 14%) of a japonica rice line (e.g., DS552) with 137Cs gamma rays at 100 Gy (1 Gy/min) in a γ irradiation facility (e.g., gamma cell).\nNOTE: Seeds used for treatment should have a high viability (e.g., with a germination rate >85%). The irradiation dose for indica rice could be increased to 150 Gy.\nSow the irradiated seeds after germination on a seedling bed and transplant seedlings individually to a paddy field and grow into the M1 population.\nNOTE: Direct seeding of M1 plants sparsely could also be applied to save labor cost. Prevent outcrossing of M1 plants with other rice varieties using physical or biological isolation means.\nBulk-harvest M2 seeds from the M1 plants, with 1-2 seeds from each M1 panic, to form an M2 population.\n\t\tNOTE: In practice and for simplicity, harvest all seeds of M1 plants and after fully mixing, a portion is sampled to form an M2 population.\nSoak about 5,000 M2 seeds in water for 24 (indica rice)-36 (japonica rice) h at room temperature. Then let the seeds to germinate at 37 °C for 2 days on moist filter paper in Petri dishes.\nNOTE: More M2 seeds can be germinated for analysis to increase the probability of identifying mutants.\nPlace the germinated seeds to seeding panels with small holes and grow them hydroponically for 3-4 weeks in a culture solution modified from Yoshida et al.15 in a glasshouse with a 12 h photoperiod [daytime (30±2) °C and night (24±2) °C].\nSampling of leaf tissues: Cut one disk (Φ ~2 mm) from the fully extended leaf of each seeding at the same position using a hole puncher.\nPreparation of DNA extraction solutions",
    "Buffer A: Add 2 mL of 5 M NaOH and 10 mL of 20% Tween 20 to make the final volume of 50 mL. Freshly prepare buffer A before DNA extraction.\nBuffer B: Add 20 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 80 μL of 0.5 M EDTA to make a final volume of 100 mL.\nPCR primers\nPrimers for HRM analysis: Design primers for amplification of the target sequence using software (e.g., Primer Premier5) and synthesize by a commercial company.\nNOTE: Because HRM is less applicable to the analysis of long fragments, and hence, the amplicons should be less than 400 bp. Fragments with too high (>75%) or too low (<25%) GC content are also not good for HRM analysis.\nPrimers for quality control: Use the 24 SSR markers distributed on the 12 rice chromosomes from Peng et al.16.\n2. DNA Extraction\nPlace 4 leaf discs into each well of a 96-well PCR plate, add buffer A solution (50 mL/well). Freeze the plate in a -80 °C freezer for 10 min.\nDefreeze the plate at room temperature, and then incubate at 95 °C for 10 min.\nAdd 50 μL of buffer B to each well and mix well by vortexing.\nCentrifuge the plate for 1 min at 1,500 x g. The supernatant is ready for PCR.\n3. PCR Amplification\nPCR Optimization\nAdd the following reagents to each PCR well: 1 μL of DNA (the supernatant in step 2.4), 5 μL of 2x Master Mix (containing 2x PCR buffer, 4 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.4 mmol/L 2'-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 50 U/mL Taq DNA polymerase, 0.2 μL each of 10 μmol/L primers, and make a final volume up to 10 μL using nuclease free water.",
    "Use a gradient-capable thermal block to determine the optimal annealing temperature for each target fragment by using the following PCR program: 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52-62 °C (gradient temperature), and 30 s at 72 °C, with a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min and a hold at 16 °C.\nExamine amplicons on 1% agarose gels for determination of the optimal annealing temperature.\nNOTE: An optimal annealing temperature should enable specific amplification of the target fragment, without nonspecific amplification and primer dimerization.\nPCR for HRM analysis\nNOTE: HRM compatible plates and DNA of M2 seedlings extracted as described in step 2.4 are used for PCR.\n\t\nPerform PCRs in a final volume of 10 μL, with 1 μL of DNA (supernatant), 5 μL of 2x Master Mix, 0.2 μL each of 10 μmol/L primers, and 1 μL of 10x fluorescence dye. In each plate include one wild type (WT) parented sample and one negative (without DNA) control.\nAdd a drop of mineral oil to each well to prevent evaporation.\nSeal the plate with adhesive film and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 1 min.\nRun the PCR using the optimized annealing temperature.\nNOTE: In a few cases, fluorescence dye may affect PCR amplification, hence the dye is added after completion of PCR. In such cases, the dye is incorporated into DNA strands by post-PCR denaturing and annealing.\n4. HRM Scanning and Mutation Confirmation\nRemove the adhesive film from plate and insert the plate into an HRM machine.\nSelect New Run from the file menu or press the Run button at the top of the screen.\nSpecify the starting and ending temperatures for the melt from 55 °C to 95 °C.",
    "NOTE: After the first run, the range of melt temperature can be determined for a particular fragment; hence, the melt temperature can be adjusted for subsequent analysis of the same fragment to save time.\nSelect samples for high resolution melting analysis, exclude samples similar to the negative control.\nNormalize the melting curves to have the same beginning and ending fluorescence. Visually confirm that the Lower Min and Lower Max temperature cursors are in a region of the curves.\nKeep the ∆F (difference of fluorescence) level at the default setting of 0.05.\nSelect the Common versus Variant from the Standards selection list and choose the Normal sensitivity.\nUse the WT as the control; samples with a ∆F value of ≥0.05 from WT are considered to contain mutant plant.\nIdentification and confirmation of mutant plants.\nIdentify the four plants, of which each mutant pool was made.\nExtract DNA from each of these plants using a CTAB method according to Allen et al.17 with some modifications.\nNOTE: DNase-free RNase and NaAc are not used when extracting DNA using the CTAB method described by Allen et al.17, as the DNA quality is good enough for further PCR amplification. Adjust the DNA to a final concentration of ~25 ng/μL after quantification using a spectrophotometer.\nAmplify the target fragment using PCR primers and program the same as for HRM analysis.\nIdentify specific molecular lesions by Sanger sequencing of the amplicons.\nNOTE: Once the completion of PCR amplification, send the amplicons to a company for Sanger sequencing. The molecular lesion can be identified by comparing the sequences between the M2 plant and the WT.\n5. Quality Control of Selected Mutants with Molecular Markers",
    "Perform PCR for the 24 SSR markers in a final volume of 10 μL with 25 ng of genomic DNA (extracted using the CTAB protocol), 5 µL of 2x master mix, 0.2 µL of each of 10 μM SSR primers.\nRun PCR using the following program: 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.\nSeparate the amplicons on 8% polyacrylamide gels and reveal polymorphism of amplified fragments by silver staining18.\nCompare the SSR haplotypes of selected variants and the WT.\nNOTE: Induced mutants often have SSR haplotypes identical to their WT, if more than one SSR markers are different between a variant and the WT, the variant is high likely to be a genetic contaminant (e.g., a mixture or outcrossed plant) rather than an induced mutant18.\nSubscription Required.
