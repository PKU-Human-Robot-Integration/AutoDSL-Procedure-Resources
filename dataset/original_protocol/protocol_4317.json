Modified from Lefrancois and Lycke (2001).Removal of small intestine and excision of Peyer’s patchesEuthanize mouse by CO2 asphyxiation, following guide lines approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Proceed as soon as possible to the aseptic intestine explantation and PP dissociation to obtain maximum cell viability.Note: All subsequent steps should be performed in a sterile flow hood.Gently lay down the mouse on its back, on a soft wood surface, stretch the limbs and fix the four paws with pins.Clean the abdomen with the disinfectant.A pair of scissors and a straight tweezers are used to perform a midline incision and retract the skin, then open the muscular wall with another cutting along median axis with a new pair of scissors and tweezers.Cut small intestine approximately 0.5 cm below the stomach, draw out of peritoneal cavity unfolding it. Cut intestine about 1 cm above the caecum, then remove fat, mesenteric lymph nodes and adjacent tissues.Note: You can cut the intestine with the same scissors and tweezers used for the muscular wall.Place the intestine on an aluminium foil and continuously moisten with cold PBS + 2% Pen/Strep to prevent drying. Expel faeces by placing a curved tweezers flat on the surface of the intestine and press down along the entire length. Press gently to avoid breaking the intestine.Remove PPs by tightening the patch with a new curved tweezers and cutting it with scissors, avoiding as much as possible the surrounding intestinal wall. The patches appear as small protruding whitish/greyish nodules (diameter 1-2 mm), similar to the lymph nodes, embedded in the outer intestinal wall, which appears to be yellow-brown. In general, five to ten PPs can be obtained from a single mouse, depending of age and strain.",
    "Notes: The presence of an excessive amount of surrounding epithelium reduces the yield of recovered cells, as it could prevent a good mechanical dissociation.  The removal of the surrounding tissue is crucial if the enzymatic dissociation is carried out; in this last case the intraepithelial cells could contaminate the resulting PP-single cells. Immediately after excision, save all PPs in 1 ml cold RPMI + 2% Pen/Strep.Isolation of PP cells by mechanical dissociationTransfer all PPs in a 70 µm cell strainer placed over a 50 ml tube.Dissociate PPs using the plunger of a 2.5 ml syringe and gently crush the patches forcing through the filter. During dissociation wash the filter with 5 ml of cold RPMI + 2% Pen/Strep (medium flow through the filter contains the single cells of PPs).Repeat step 2 twice more, until they are no longer visible pieces of tissue. At this point, the tube contain PP-single cells flowed through the filter and suspended in 15 ml of RPMI + 2% Pen/Strep. Centrifuge at 400 x g, 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cells and add 10 ml of cold RPMI + 2% Pen/Strep.Repeat step 4 two more times. After the last centrifugation resuspend the cells in 1-2 ml of cold RPMI + 2% Pen/Strep.Count viable cells using trypan blue dye exclusion.Notes: The variability in the number of cells recovered from a single mouse is very high, mainly due to the mouse (strain and age), the time elapsed between the euthanization and dissociation of PP, and the accuracy in removing every single PP.The mechanical dissociation allows to isolate mainly non-adherent cells, such as B and T lymphocytes. Adherent cells including monocytes, dendritic and non-immune epithelial cells appear to be present in small quantities since they require an enzymatic treatment to be isolated.",
    "The phenotype of recovered PP cells can be checked by FACS analysis. If needed, PP cells can be further purified by sorting with magnetic beads or FACS [see Guo et al. (2008) and Thornton (2003) in the reference section]. In vitro activation of PP cellsCentrifuge an appropriate amount of cells at 400 x g, at 4 °C for 10 min.Resuspend the pellet in complete medium at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/ml and culture the PP cells in 24-well plate, 1 ml/well, in presence of 10 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml Ionomycin for at least 24 h, in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator.Note: Other activation protocols, specific for B or T lymphocytes, can be used [see Li et al. (2006) and Muul et al. (2011) in the references section].Optionals: To eliminate adherent cells, PP cells can be cultured for 2-4 h in Complete Medium (see recipes) with PMA and Ionomycin without antibiotics. The presence of adherent cells (monocytes and/or dendritic cells) may differentially modulate the activation of B and T lymphocytes with a consequent alterations of the immune responses.To avoid as much as possible a bacterial contamination, PP cells are washed and cultured for 24 h as describe above, in Complete Medium + PMA/Ionomycin, with 100 μg/ml Gentamycin instead of Penicillin/Streptomycin. The use of a different antibiotic ensures the elimination of all kinds of bacteria. After 24 h (or more) the supernatants of cultures can be collected, centrifuged at 400 x g, at 4 °C for 10 min to eliminate the cells, and used to test the presence of specific antibodies or cytokines. Activated cells can be harvested, washed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min and used in flow cytometry assays and sorting."
