    "All animal experiments comply with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication no. 85–23, revised 2011) and the Portuguese law on animal welfare (DL 129/92, DL 197/96; P 1131/97). The competent local authorities approved this experimental protocol (018833). Seven-week-old male C57B1/J6 mice were maintained in appropriate cages, with a regular 12/12 h light-dark cycle environment, a temperature of 22 °C and 60% humidity with access to water and a standard diet ad libitum.\n1. Preparation of the surgical field\nDisinfect the operation site with 70% alcohol and place a disposable operating room table cover over the surgical area.\nSterilize all the instruments before surgery.\n\tNOTE: This procedure requires micro surgical scissors, 2 fine curved forceps, 3 fine straight forceps, a scalpel, small forceps, an angled dissector scissor, a needle holder, an ultrafine ligation aid, 2 hemostats and, lastly, a magnetic fixator retraction system is highly recommended (Figure 1A).\nCurve the tip of a 26 G blunted needle to 90° for an easier approach to the aorta. A 26 G needle will create a 0.45 mm diameter aortic narrowing (Figure 1B).\nAdjust the heating pad temperature to 37 ± 0.1 °C.\n2. Mice preparation and intubation\nAnesthetize young C57B1/J6 mice (20-25 g) by inhalation of 8% sevoflurane with 0.5 - 1.0 L/min 100% O2 in a cone tube.\nCheck the anesthesia depth using the toe pinch withdrawal reflex.\nPlace the mouse at dorsal recumbency on an inclined plate and proceed to orotracheal intubation.\nMove the mouse to the heating pad and quickly connect the orotracheal tube to the ventilator to initiate the mechanical ventilation.\nAdjust the ventilator parameters to a frequency of 160 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg.\n3. Preparation for surgery (for both banding and debanding surgeries)",
    "Shave and apply the depilatory cream from the neckline to mid-chest level of the mice.\nApply ophthalmic gel to the animals' eyes to prevent drying out of the cornea.\nPlace a rectal probe and the oximeter at the paw or tail for monitoring temperature and blood oxygenation, and heart rate, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Anesthesia induces significant hypothermia, therefore, it is important to maintain normal body temperature during surgery to avoid a rapid decrease in heart rate.\nMaintain anesthesia with sevoflurane (2.0 - 3.0%). Check the correct level of anesthesia by the lack of the toe-pinch reflex.\nPlace the mice in right-lateral decubitus on a heating pad and secure the limbs to the magnetic fixator retraction system with a tape to keep the animal in the correct position during the surgery (Figure 2, Figure 3A).\nDisinfect the mouse chest with 70% alcohol followed by providone-iodine solution.\n4. Ascending aortic banding surgery\nNOTE: For a detailed protocol description, consult 2,3,4,13.  \nWith a disposable blade, perform a small (~0.5 cm) skin incision on the left side immediately below the axilla level and dissect the skin.\nGently dissect and separate the pectoralis muscle and other muscle layers until the ribs become visible. Use fine forceps and avoid cutting the muscle.\nUnder a microscope, identify the intercostal spaces and open a small incision between the 2nd and 3rd intercostal space with fine forceps.\nRetract the ribs by placing the chest retractor (Figure 2A).\nUse small forceps to gently dissect and separate the thymic lobes until ascending aorta becomes visible.\n\tNOTE: Cotton applicators should be handy in case of bleeding. Warm sterile saline should be given subcutaneously in case of significant bleeding (e.g., the mammary artery).\nUse small forceps to gently dissect the aorta.",
    "NOTE: Aorta is considered to be dissected when there are no fat or other adhesions around it and it is possible to easily encircle the vessel with a small curve forceps.\nAfter aortic dissection, place a 7-0 polypropylene ligature around aorta by using ligation aid and curved forceps (Figure 2B).\nPosition the blunted 26 G needle parallel to the aorta (tip pointed towards the mice head) (Figure 2B). For mice weighing 20-25 g, this needle induces a reproducible 65-70% aortic constriction.\nMake 2 loose knots around the aorta and the 26 G needle with the help of 2 forceps (Figure 2B).\nTighten the 1st knot and, quickly after, the 2nd knot. Briefly confirm the right positioning of the constriction and quickly remove the needle to restore aortic blood flow. Finally, make a 3rd knot (BA group).\nReposition the thymus and the muscles into their initial position.\nPerform the sham procedure identical to the constriction procedure but keeping the suture loose around the aorta (SHAM group).\nCut the ends of the suture and remove the chest retractor.\n\tNOTE: Short suture ends may increase the probability of knots loosening with aortic pressure, while long ends make the debanding procedure riskier since adhesions can occur between the suture and the left atrium.\nClose the chest wall using 6-0 polypropylene suture with a simple interrupted or continuous suture using the lowest number of stitches possible. Tighten the last chest knot with the lungs inflated at end inspiration by pinched off the outflow of the ventilator for 2s to re-inflate the lungs.\nClose the skin with a 6-0 silk/polypropylene suture in a continuous suture pattern. \n\tNOTES: If a more recent ventilator is used, it is possible to programme it to pause in inspiration (Setup-Advanced-Pause-Inspiration)\n5. Post-operative care\nApply providone-iodine solution to the skin suture site.",
    "For proper analgesia, administer buprenorphine subcutaneously 0.1 mg/kg, twice daily, until the animal fully recovers (usually 2-3 days after surgery).\nInject sterile saline intraperitoneally to prevent dehydration in case of significant bleeding during the surgery.\nTurn off the anesthesia (without deintubating the mouse) and wait until the animal recover the reflexes (whiskers movements are an awakening signal)  and starts to breathe spontaneously.\nRemove the tracheal cannula.\nLet the animal recover in an incubator at 37 °C.\nReturn the animal to a 12 h light/dark cycle room after full recovery.\n6. Aortic debanding surgery\nSeven weeks later, perform the debanding of the aorta in half of the BA  animals and remove the loose suture from half of the SHAM mice, giving rise to 2 new groups -- debanding (DEB) and debanding SHAMA (DESHAM), respectively. DESHAM represents the control for the DEB group (Figure 4).\nRepeat all the steps 2.1 to 3.6 mentioned above.\nGently dissect the tissues, adhesions, and fibrosis around the aorta until its constriction becomes visible.\nCarefully dissect the aorta and separate the suture from the aorta. Cut the suture with angled one-probed spring scissors (Figure 3B).\nClose the chest wall using 6-0 polypropylene suture with a simple interrupted or continuous suture using the minimum number of stitches possible.\n\tNOTE: Try to tighten the last chest suture when lungs are inflated to avoid pneumothorax.\nClose the skin with a 6-0 silk/polypropylene suture in a continuous suture pattern. \nPerform all post-operative care procedures as mentioned in 5.\nSacrifice the animals 2 weeks later.\n7. Echocardiography to assess cardiac function and left ventricular hypertrophy in vivo\nPerform the echocardiographic exam every 2-3 weeks to follow the progression of hypertrophy and cardiac function.",
    "Anesthetize the animals, as described, by inhalation of 5% sevoflurane with a nose cone. Adjust the anesthesia level by decreasing it to 2.5%.\nShave and apply the depilatory cream from the neckline to mid-chest level.\nPlace the animal on a heating pad and place the ECG electrodes. Assure a good ECG trace and maintain heart rate between 300 and 350 beats/min.\nMonitor the temperature (~37 °C).\nApply echo gel and position the animal at left lateral decubitus.\nStart the echocardiograph and adjust the settings.\nPosition an ultrasound probe over the thorax.\nAssess the pressure gradient across the banding at 7 and 2 weeks after banding and debanding surgery, respectively. Position the probe at the LV long axis and place the beam over aorta. Press the button PW to activate pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography. After seven weeks of banding, aortic gradients will be >25 mmHg in the banded animals.\nRecord two-dimensional guided images of aorta showing the presence or absence of the ascending aorta constriction to anatomically visualize the efficacy of the banding and debanding.\n\tNOTE: It is possible to visualize turbulent flow at the constriction level if the color mode is available.\nAssess hypertrophy by positioning the probe at an LV short axis, at papillary muscles level, and press M-mode tracing to visualize LV anterior wall (LVAW), LV diameter (LVD) and LV posterior wall (LVPW) in diastole (D) and systole (S) (Figure 5).\nAssess systolic function, calculate the ejection fraction and fractional shortening as previously described14,15.",
    "Assess diastolic function by 1) determining the peak of pulsed-wave Doppler of early and late mitral flow velocity (E and A waves, respectively) using an apical 4-chamber apical view just above the mitral leaflets; 2) recording lateral mitral annular myocardial early diastolic (E') and peak systolic (S') velocities using pulsed-TDI and apical 4-chamber apical view (Figure 5).  \nRecord at least three consecutive heartbeats to each parameter assessment. These values will be subsequently averaged.\n8. Hemodynamic assessment\nAt the end of the protocol (Figure 4), perform final echocardiography, as described in 7, before the terminal hemodynamic assessment.\nRepeat steps 2.1 to 3.6.\nCannulate the right jugular vein and perfuse sterile saline at 64 mL/kg/h.\nRotate slightly the animal to the left side and make a skin incision at the level of the xiphoid appendix.\nSeparate the skin from the muscle with forceps or with a scissor.\nMake a lateral incision between the left ribs at the xiphoid appendix level.\nPerform a left lateral thoracotomy to expose the heart fully.\n\tNOTE: To avoid bleeding and lung damage, insert a cotton swab into the thoracic cavity and push the lung gently while inserting two hemostats on the right and left side of the place to cut.\nPre-heat the P-V loop catheters in a water-bath at 37 °C.\nCalibrate the catheter (setup, channel setting, chose the correct channel for pressure and volume, units).\nInsert a catheter apically into the LV and assure the volume sensors are positioned between the aortic valve and the apex. Volumes can be assessed by echocardiography (Figure 5). Visualization of the pressure-volume loops helps to confirm the correct positioning of the catheter (Figure 6).\nAllow the animal to stabilize 20-30 min without significant changes in the shape of the pressure-volume loops.",
    "With ventilation suspended at end-expiration, acquire baseline recordings (Figure 6). Continuously acquire data at 1,000 Hz to be subsequently analyzed off-line by appropriate software.\nCompute parallel conductance after the hypertonic saline bolus (10%, 10 µL).\nWhile anesthetized, sacrifice the animal by exsanguination, collect and centrifuge the blood.\nLastly, excise and collect the heart. Weight the heart, the left, and the right ventricle separately and immediately store the samples in liquid nitrogen or formalin for subsequent molecular or histological studies, respectively.\n9. Aortic banding/debanding procedure in rats\nPerform aortic banding in young Wistar (70-90 g) using a 22 G needle and 6-0 polypropylene ligature to constrict the aorta.\nEnsure a proper anesthetic and analgesic procedures with 3-4% of sevoflurane and 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine, respectively.\nDuring echocardiography, assure a heart rate always above 300 rate / min (ideally between 300 and 350).\nBefore step 8.9, gently dissect the rat aorta, place a flow probe around it to measure cardiac output. The use of the aortic flow probe is the gold standard procedure for rats.\nFor the hemodynamic evaluation, cannulate the jugular or femoral vein for fluid administration (32 mL/kg/h).\nReplace the pressure-volume catheter SPR-1035 by the SPR-847 or SPR-838, whose sizes better suit the rat ventricular dimensions.\nSubscription Required.
