  "procedures": [
    "Part 1: Preparation of clarified tissue homogenates\nDounce homogenize unfixed cortical tissue in 4 times volume of ice-cold buffer (0.1M phosphate-buffered saline [Ca++- and Mg++-free] plus 2x protease inhibitor cocktail [Santa Cruz]) with approximately 30 even pestle strokes (i.e. add 400μl buffer to 100mg tissue).  \nSpin homogenates for 5 minutes at 3,000g (4°C).  Carefully remove clarified supernatants and store aliquots of these extracts at -80°C until use.  \nDetermine total protein concentration (μg/μl) for clarified homogenates using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (ThermoFisher).\nPart 2: SDS-PAGE Sample preparation\nWith a 10 well, 10-20% Tricine gel (Invitrogen), the maximum volume that can be loaded per well is ~25μl.  Total volume includes 2x SDS sample buffer and 10x reducing agent, so the maximum volume of clarified homogenate that can be loaded per well is 10μl.  Clarified 20% (w/v) cortical homogenates should have a total protein concentration greater than 5 μg/μl, allowing for 50μg total protein per well.  Samples with less than 5mg/ml protein will necessitate loading less total protein per well.  However, high protein levels are optimal for the detection of monomeric and aggregated Aβ (50-60μg total protein is optimal).Always load the same amount of total protein per well.\nFor each gel, load at least one well with 10μl of a molecular weight marker such as SeeBlue Plus2 (Invitrogen).  As a positive control, run 10-100ng of synthetic Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptide (diluted in 1xPBS) in another well.\nPrepare reaction mixtures on ice, using freshly thawed, clarified homogenates.  Vortex tubes for 5-10 seconds, heat in a dry bath at 100°C for 5 minutes, then quickly spin all samples to remove condensation in the cap.\nPart 3: SDS-PAGE Gel electrophoresis",
    "Load vortexed samples onto a 10-20% Tricine gel in the XCell Sure Lock Mini-Cell Gelbox, using Tricine SDS running buffer, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), \nRun gel at a constant voltage of 125V for about 90 minutes.  Let samples run until the 4KDa marker band is about 1 cm from the bottom of the gel.\nPart 4: Transferring Proteins from Gels to Membranes\nCarefully remove gels from plastic case and assemble the transfer sandwich inside the XCell II Blot Module, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).  Pre-wet blotting pads and 0.2μm nitrocellulose membranes with Tris-Glycine transfer buffer (20% methanol), and remove any bubbles from blotting pads or the filter paper/membrane sandwich. \nIn the XCell Gelbox, fill the inner chamber with transfer buffer and fill the outer chamber with dIH2O (methanol exposure can wear down the plastic gelbox over time).\nRun the transfer for 2-3 hours at a constant amperage of 25mA.  \nWhen the transfer is complete, deconstruct the sandwich and place the gels into dIH2O and the membranes into 1xPBS, both in square plastic petri dishes (or another appropriate container).\nTo visualize the efficiency of protein transfer, gels can be stained with Simply Blue SafeStain (Invitrogen), and the membranes with Ponceau S Red stain (Sigma Aldrich), both according to the manufacturer's instructions.  This staining will not interfere with immunoblotting.  If staining reveals inefficient protein transfer, modify transfer time in Step 3.\nPart 5. Antigen-epitope retrieval & Immunoblotting",
    "Antigen retrieval is an important step in revealing the Aβ epitopes on the membrane for antibody binding during immunoblotting.  Any steamer, microwave, or water bath that maintains a constant temperature of 100°C will suffice.  For antigen retrieval in a steamer, heat-seal the membrane in a heavy-duty Kapak plastic pouch filled with 1xPBS, at room temperature.  Lay the pouch flat in a pre-heated steamer; once the pouch begins to expand, incubate for an additional 15 minutes.  Allow the membrane to cool slowly before removing it from the pouch, to prevent excessive wrinkling.\nAt room temperature, carefully remove the membrane from the steaming pouch and rinse the membrane for 5 minutes in 1xPBS, followed by a 5-minute rinse in TBS-T (Tris-Buffered Saline, pH 8.0 with 0.05% Tween-20 [Sigma]), on an orbital shaker.  Incubate the membrane in blocking solution (2.5% nonfat milk in TBS-T) for one hour, shaking.  Without rinsing, transfer membrane to a dish or plastic pouch containing the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution (6E10 at 1:1,000 [1μg/ml]   1:5,000 [0.2μg/ml] dilution, Covance), avoiding bubbles.  Incubate on an orbital shaker at room temperature for one hour and then 24-48 hours shaking at 4°C (longer incubation may give a better signal).  \nRinse the membrane for 30 minutes in TBS-T (one quick rinse followed by 3 x 10 minute rinses).\nIncubate the membrane in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham ECL sheep anti-mouse, GE Healthcare), diluted at 1:10,000 in blocking solution, for 90 minutes on the shaker at room temperature.\nRinse the membrane for 30 minutes in TBS-T (one quick rinse followed by 3 x 10 minute rinses).",
    "On the shaker, incubate the membrane in freshly-made SuperSignal West Pico Electrochemiluminescence reagent (ThermoFisher) for 5 minutes, blot off excess reagent on lint-free filter paper and place the membrane in a film cassette, between plastic sheet protectors.  Blot off additional SuperSignal reagent with dust-free Kimwipes if necessary.\nExpose to Kodak Biomax MR film for intervals of 30 seconds up to 30 minutes and develop in a film developer.  After 5 minutes, the Aβ monomer bands will probably be saturated.  \nMembranes can be stripped (after rinsing in TBS-T) by shaking in Restore Plus stripping buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature and reprobed with additional antibodies if desired.\nPart 6: Representative Immunoblot: \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/1916/1916fig1a.jpgimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/1916/1916fig1b.jpgimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/1916/1916fig1c.jpgFigures 1a-c. Clarified homogenates containing 50μg total protein from 7 human subjects are analyzed for the presence of multimeric Aβ and APP.  Immunoblotting with antibody 6E10 reveals Aβ monomers, dimers, trimers, tetramers, and APP (top band) in all Alzheimer's cases, as well as abundant higher molecular weight Aβ multimers in 2 AD cases. Synthetic Aβ40 confirms the identity of the lower molecular weight bands. AD: Alzheimer's disease, DLB: Dementia with Lewy Bodies, ND: Nondemented human. (a) 30 minute film exposure, (b) 5 minute film exposure, (c) 30 second film exposure.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
