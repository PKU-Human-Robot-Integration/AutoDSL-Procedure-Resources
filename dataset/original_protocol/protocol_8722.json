    "Note: All the procedure including animal subjects have been approved by Institutional Animals Ethics Committee (IAEC) at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi (IGIB/AEC/10/2013). This protocol is specifically adjusted for targeted delivery of Antagomir-29 in the brain and knockdown of miR-29.\n1. Antagomir Design Strategy\nRetrieve the mature miRNA sequence from miRBase11 (http://www.mirbase.org/[href=http://www.mirbase.org/]).\nRetrieve the sequences of related miRNA family members using the “Gene Family” link in the miRBase record\n\t(http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/mirna_summary.pl?fam=MIPF0000009[href=http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/mirna_summary.pl?fam=MIPF0000009] ).\nReverse complement the sequence: http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html[href=http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html] provides a convenient tool to reverse complement sequences.\nMark the positions to be modified by LNA using the following guidelines:\n\t\nChoose Thymine residues placed 3-4 bases apart for the LNA modification, since LNA pyrimidines are more stable than purines12.\nChoose Cytosine residues separated by 3-4 residues if previous step produces less than five modifications.\nPrioritize the five modifications to the 5’ end of the antagomir, since this avoids the seed sequence.\n2. Antagomir-neuropeptide Complex Preparation\nNote: This is the most critical step in the protocol and it needs standardization. To standardize the protocol any fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide (FLO) can be used in place of the antagomir9. The peptides should be of high purity (HPLC grade, 98% purity).Sequences and charge of peptide and antagomir are given in Table 1.\nDecide the number of moles of antagomir to be injected based on molar charge on antagomir, its toxicity and weight of the mouse. Calculate the number of moles of peptide to be injected based on molar charge ratio of antagomir : peptide.",
    "NOTE: Standardize molar charge ratio of antagomir : peptide for toxicity and effective delivery in the mouse brain. Use different molar charge ratios of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide: peptide for standardization. We found that Antagomir-29 and control were both toxic at 4microgram/gram body weight of mouse.  Antagomir-29 and control were used at 2microgram/gram body weight, but this effective concentration is likely to vary for each microRNA.\nDilute the peptide and antagomir in separate microfuge tubes from stock solutions with sterile 10% D-glucose to the desired final concentration as calculated in step 1.\nKeep the microfuge tube with the peptide solution on a vortex at moderate vortexing speed.\nAdd 1/3rd of the antagomir solution to the peptide solution tube, slowly, drop wise, while it is mixed thoroughly on a vortex mixer.\nContinue mixing of solutions on the vortex for next 1 min and then allow the mixture to stand for 1 min.\nRepeat the step 4 and 5 two more times to mix the remaining antagomir solution with the peptide solution in the same microfuge tube. The slow addition is critical for the formation of mono-disperse complexes that are effective in transfection. Rapid addition can lead to aggregation of the complexes and their precipitation.\nIncubate the complex for 30 min at RT without vortexing. During this time of    incubation, acclimatize the mice to the lab where injections will be performed.\n3. Tail Vein Injection of Antagomir-neuropeptide Complex\nTo restrain the animal, place the mouse in a restrainer or decapicone of proper size.\nClean the surface of the tail using cotton swab pre-soaked in warm water (about 40°C). This will promote vasodilation and increase the visibility of the vein.",
    "Approach the tail with a small volume (0.5 – 1.0 cc) insulin syringe at a 15-20° angle. Be careful not to introduce any air into the syringe. Start at the distal portion of the tail. Inject the complex. Remove the needle and apply an antiseptic swab directly to the injection site (approximately 5-10 sec) to stop any bleeding.\nReplace the mouse in an individually ventilated cage in the group of 3-5, with the corncob and tissue paper as enrichment. Do not keep uninjected and injected mice in same cage.\n4. Behavioural Assays\nNote: Keep the time interval of 3-4 hr in between injection and behavioural assays to allow recovery after injection. Bring the mouse to a quiet room.  Do not disturb the animals during this period of acclimatization.\nAcclimatize the mouse to the new room for 30 min and then start the following behavioural assays. Keep a gap of 10 min in between each behavioural assay.\nHindlimb clasping:\n\tNOTE: This test indicates motor dysfunction and neurological impairment.\n\t\nLift the mouse gently by holding near base of the tail in the clear background.\nCheck the hindlimb position for 10-15 sec. Wild type mouse splays hindlimbs away from abdomen, while an ataxic mouse tends to retract one or both hindlimbs towards the abdomen more than 50% of time suspended13.\nReturn the mouse to the cage\nLedge test:\n\t\nLift the mouse gently by holding the tail and keep it on the ledge of a cage.\nObserve the mouse specifically at the corner of the cage. Wild type mouse can pass the corners easily without fear and losing the balance. Ataxic mouse lose its balance, freeze or shakes while walking along the cage ledge and at the corners.\nMouse foot print assay:",
    "NOTE: For this assay keep the absorbent sheet ready, on the floor of a narrow runway (~70-cm-long, ~5-cm-wide with ~5-cm-high walls.)\n\t\nHold the mouse gently by one hand and apply ink on the hind limbs by a brush.\nPlace the absorbent sheet on the floor of a narrow runway.\nAllow mouse to walk or run over an absorbent sheet in a straight line in a runway from one end to other.\nRepeat the process two more times with each mouse using fresh absorbent sheet.\nMeasure the distance between two consecutive steps in the forward movement. Do not include first and last few footprints where the animal is just initiating and finishing its run, respectively.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
