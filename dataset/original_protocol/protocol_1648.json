In vivo imaging analysis of ARF-DTR mice\n(A) Photo of the mouse shaved hair on the ventral side.\n(B and C) Photos showing the mouse inside the IVIS spectrum imager.\n(D) Luciferase activity was observed in the lung and adipose tissue with aging in female ARF-DTR mice.\n(E) Photo of drawing the ROI by Living image software. Place a rectangle over the area of interest. Scale bar; 10 mm.\nSet up imaging settings at the IVIS spectrum imager system as follows; Exposure time: 3 min, Binning: Medium, F/Stop: 1, Emission Filter: Open, Field of View: B.\nIn vivo imaging\nInject the luciferin (VivoGloTM Luciferin, in vivo grade) intraperitoneally (i.p.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.promega.jp/products/luciferase-assays/reporter-assays/vivoglo-luciferin-in-vivo-grade/?catNum=P1043#resources[href=https://www.promega.jp/products/luciferase-assays/reporter-assays/vivoglo-luciferin-in-vivo-grade/?catNum=P1043#resources]).\nAnesthetize mice with 2% isoflurane in air.\nPlace the mice in the chamber and arrange them as necessary so that you can begin imaging (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nPerform the bioluminescence imaging 10 min post i.p. injection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nCritical: Because dark colored hair impairs the luminescence detection, hair on the ventral side should be removed thoroughly before in vivo imaging.\nNote: In ARF-DTR mice, luminescence reflecting senescent cells in the tissue is mainly obtained from lung, adipose tissue and testis.\nTo calculate light outputs, draw region of Interest (ROI) by Living image software (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nSenescent cell elimination\nTiming: ∼4 weeks\nThis step describes how to eliminate senescent cells from lung tissue (Hashimoto et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The experimental scheme for senescent cell elimination is described in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1208-Fig4.jpg",
