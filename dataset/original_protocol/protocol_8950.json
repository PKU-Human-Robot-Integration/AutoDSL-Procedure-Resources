    "1. Preparation of Assay Reagents\nThaw 200x dithiothreitol (DTT), 10x Matrix Binding buffer (10x Binding buffer hereafter), 10x Neutralization buffer (food or pH imbalanced samples only), and 10x BoTest Reaction buffer (10x Reaction buffer hereafter) at room temperature (RT) for 15 min or until completely thawed. See Table 1 for a list of buffers and reagents used in this protocol. See Table 2 for a list of materials and equipment required for this protocol.\nVortex the thawed buffers for 5 sec to mix. 10x Neutralization buffer, 200xDTT, and 10x Reaction buffer should appear clear while the 10x Binding buffer will have a cloudy appearance. Warm the 10x Reaction buffer for 5 min at 37 °C and repeat vortexing if it appears cloudy following thawing.\nGenerate 3.8 ml of 1x Reaction buffer.\n\t\nLabel a 15 ml conical tube \"1x Reaction buffer\" and add 3.42 ml molecular biology grade water, 380 μl 10x Reaction buffer, and 19 μl 200x DTT. Mix buffer well by inversion.\nCut a single EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet in quarters using a clean razor blade and add one quarter of the tablet to the 1x Reaction buffer (the remaining tablet portion can be stored at 4 °C for later use). N.B. Protease inhibitors may not be necessary if using purified toxin and simple buffers (e.g. pharmaceutical samples).\nVortex the 1x Reaction buffer until the protease tablet is fully dissolved.\nWarm the Matrix A beads (IP-A beads hereafter) for 20 min at RT.\nThaw the BoTest A/E reporter (A/E reporter hereafter) at RT protected from light.\nLabel a 15 ml conical tube \"0.5 μM A/E reporter\" and add 45 μl of the 20 μM A/E reporter stock to 1.8 ml 1x Reaction buffer. Mix thoroughly by pipetting and store on ice protected from light.\n2. Standard Curve Sample Generation",
    "The standard curve described here spans 10-30,000 mLD50/g food or per ml buffer in half-log dilutions (Table 3). The end-user is free to use alternate concentrations as applicable.\nSpiking and incubating the matrices with reference material. Generate the standard curve using a diluent of the same matrix as the unknown, if possible, to reduce matrix effects. Use gelatin phosphate buffer (GPB) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a diluent if additional, BoNT-negative matrix is not available (e.g. field or BoNT outbreak sample testing). Generate the standard curve by spiking BoNT/A into the matrix of choice following the appropriate protocol below.\n\t\nLow complexity samples (e.g. PBS, GPB, or pharmaceutical)\nAdd 10 ml of the appropriate buffer to a 15 ml conical tube and set aside. This sample will be used as diluent for the standard curve and unknown dilutions (Section 4).\nAdd 1.2 ml buffer to a microcentrifuge tube.\nCAUTION: This step uses BoNT and extreme caution must be used when handling and disposing of any reagents and materials that come in contact with the toxin. Use of personal protective equipment and proper disposal of all materials must be performed according the US Department of Labor OSHA guidelines for BoNT (http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/botulism/index.html). Add BoNT/A to the 1.2 ml sample such that the final concentration is 30,000 mLD50/ml (36,000 mLD50 total).\nLiquid food samples (or other complex liquid samples) Note: Initial testing is recommended to determine the volume of supernatant recovered from clarified samples as the particulate matter (e.g. pulp) in liquid matrices will vary. This protocol assumes at least 1.2 ml of clarified supernatant will be recovered from a 1.4 ml sample. Increase sample size if necessary.",
    "Add 10 ml liquid food to a 15 ml conical tube and set it aside. This sample will be used as diluent for the standard curve and unknown dilutions (Section 4).\nWeigh an empty 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and record its mass.\nAdd 1.4 ml of the liquid food to the weighed microcentrifuge tube.\nReweigh the microcentrifuge tube and calculate the mass of the added food sample by subtracting the mass of the empty tube.\nCAUTION: This step uses BoNT and extreme caution must be used when handling and disposing of any reagents and materials that come in contact with the toxin. Use of personal protective equipment and proper disposal of all materials must be performed according the US Department of Labor OSHA guidelines for BoNT (http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/botulism/index.html). Add BoNT/A to the 1.4 ml sample at a final concentration of 30,000 mLD50/g food.\nIncubate the diluent and spiked samples at RT or 4 °C for 2 hr to give the BoNT time to interact with the food matrix, mimicking a natural contamination.\nSolid food samples (or other solid samples) Note: Initial testing is recommended to determine the volume of supernatant recovered from homogenized and clarified samples following the addition of 1 ml GPB/g food. This protocol assumes that at least 1.2 ml clarified supernatant will be recovered from a 2 g sample. Increase sample size if necessary.\n\t\t\nWeigh out 10 g solid sample into a 50 ml conical tube and set aside. This will be used as diluent.\nWeigh out 2 g solid food sample into a second 50 ml conical tube.",

Use of personal protective equipment and proper disposal of all materials must be performed according the US Department of Labor OSHA guidelines for BoNT (http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/botulism/index.html). Add BoNT/A to the surface of the 2 g sample to a final concentration of 30,000 mLD50/g food (60,000 total mLD50).\nIncubate the diluent and spiked samples at RT or 4 °C for 2 hr to give the BoNT time to interact with the food matrix, mimicking a natural contamination.\nSample homogenization and buffer adjustment. Process the spiked standard curve sample and diluent generated above according to sample type.\n\t\nLow complexity samples\nNo further sample processing is necessary.\nLiquid food samples (or other complex liquid samples)\nNo sample homogenization is necessary.\nAdd 140 μl 10x Neutralization buffer to the 1.4 ml spiked sample and 1 ml 10x Neutralization buffer to the 10 ml diluent sample. Mix samples well by inversion.\nPartially clarify both samples by centrifuging for 10 min at 6,000 x g and 4 °C. Immediately remove the supernatants and transfer to new tubes.\nSolid food samples (or other solid samples)\nAdd 2 ml GPB (1 ml GPB/g food) to the 2 g BoNT/A-spiked solid food sample and 10 ml GPB to the 10 g diluent sample.\nHomogenize the samples using a pestle until thoroughly blended. Depending on the nature of the sample, there may be small chunks of material that cannot be homogenized, which is acceptable. Alternately, mechanical homogenization methods may be used. Use of a blender is not recommended as it may inactivate as well as aerosolize the toxin.",
    "Add 1/10th volume of 10x Neutralization buffer to the diluent sample based on the approximate total volume (e.g. 2 ml if the volume is 20 ml). Extrapolate the total volume of the BoNT/A-spiked sample and add 1/10th volume of 10x Neutralization buffer. Mix samples well by inversion.\nPartially clarify both samples by centrifuging for 10 min at 6,000 x g and 4 °C. Immediately remove the supernatants and transfer to new tubes.\nPrepare standard curve serial dilutions for testing\nUsing the BoNT/A-spiked standard curve sample as D1 and the nonspiked sample as diluent, generate the remaining standard curve samples in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes according to Table 3.\n3. Prepare Unknown Samples\nThis section can be completed in parallel to section 2.\nDetermine the number and dilutions of unknowns. Test unknowns in triplicate if possible.\n\t\nFor qualitative assays, run the unknowns without any further dilution than required to process the sample as described below.\nFor quantitative assays, prepare at least two 1:10 dilution samples, as described below, to ensure that one or more samples fall within the linear range of the assay response. Generate dilutions using a diluent of the same matrix as the unknown, if possible, to reduce matrix effects as described in Section 3. Otherwise, use PBS or GPB as the diluent.\nGenerating and diluting unknown samples according to sample type.\nLow complexity unknowns (e.g. PBS, GPB, or pharmaceutical)\nAdd at least 750 μl unknown to a microcentrifuge tube to generate Unknown dilution 1.\nAdd 675 μl diluent to two microcentrifuge tubes labeled Unknown dilution 2 and 3. The diluent will be the same material used for standard curve generation.\nSerially dilute dilution 1 by transferring 75 μl of dilution 1 into the dilution 2 tube and mixing.",
    "Serially dilute dilution 2 by transferring 75 μl of dilution 2 into the dilution 3 tube and mixing.\nLiquid food unknowns (or other complex liquid samples) Note: Initial testing is recommended to determine the volume of supernatant recovered from clarified samples as discussed in Section 3. Increase sample size if necessary.\n\t\t\nAdd ≥ 875 μl of the liquid unknown to a microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1/10th volume of 10x Neutralization buffer to the sample (e.g. 87.5 μl for a 875 μl sample).\nPartially clarify the sample by centrifuging for 10 min at 6,000 x g and 4 °C. Immediately transfer the supernatant to a new tube. This is Unknown dilution 1.\nAdd 675 μl diluent to two tubes labeled Unknown dilution 2 and 3. The diluent will be the same processed material used for standard curve generation.\nSerially dilute dilution 1 by transferring 75 μl of dilution 1 into the dilution 2 tube and mixing.\nSerially dilute dilution 2 by transferring 75 μl of dilution 2 into the dilution 3 tube and mixing.\nSolid food unknowns (or other solid samples) Note: Initial testing is recommended to determine the volume of supernatant recovered from clarified samples as discussed in Section 3.

Mix samples well by inversion.\nPartially clarify the sample by centrifuging for 10 min at 6,000 x g and 4 °C. Immediately transfer ≥750 μl supernatant to a microcentrifuge tube. This is Unknown dilution 1.",
    "Add 675 ml diluent to two tubes labeled Unknown dilution 2 and 3.

Final Sample Clarification\nIf testing liquid or solid food samples, centrifuge all samples for 5 min at ≥14,000 x g in a microcentrifuge to fully clarify the samples. Immediately remove the supernatants and transfer to new tubes.\n5. Plate Setup and BoNT/A Pull Down\nThe specific plate layout is application dependent; however, do not use the outside wells so as to avoid edge effects. Each unknown sample and standard curve sample D1-D8 requires 3 wells while sample D9 requires 6 wells. A suggested plate layout is shown in Figure 1.\nAdd 20 μl 10x Binding buffer to each well to be used.\nAdd 200 μl of each clarified dilution and unknown to each of three wells (six wells for D9) for triplicate testing. Mix the plate for 10 sec on a microplate mixer.\nAdd the IP-A beads.\n\t\nVortex the IP-A beads for 10 sec at the highest speed. Continue vortexing if beads are not fully resuspended and homogeneous.\nPipette 20 μl IP-A beads to each sample well.\nMix the plate for 30 sec on a microplate mixer.\nIncubate the plate using a rotating plate incubator for 2 hr at 750 rpm, 25 °C or RT. Assay performance is highly dependent on generating and maintaining the IP-A bead suspension during all incubation steps. Always resuspend beads with a microplate mixer after pelleting and maintain the suspension using an orbital microtiter plate shaker during all incubation steps.",
    "6. Plate Washing and Bead Resuspension\nWash the plates either by hand or by using a magnetic bead-compatible automated plate washer. An automated plate washer configured for magnetic beads greatly increases assay throughput.\n\t\nManual Washing\nLabel a 50 ml conical tube \"1x Wash buffer\" and add 45 ml molecular biology grade water and 5 ml 10x Matrix Wash Buffer. Mix buffer well by inversion.\nRemove the plate from the rotating plate incubator.\nImmediately place the plate on a 96-well magnetic bead separation plate for 5 min.\nWhile keeping the plate on the 96-well magnetic bead separation plate, gently remove and discard the supernatants from the sample wells using a single- or multi-channel pipette. Do not aspirate beads- visually monitor the aspirated buffer in the pipette tip for accidental bead removal. If removal is witnessed, gently add the tip contents back to the well, reseparate, and repeat removal.\nAdd 300 μl 1x Wash buffer to each sample well.\nFully resuspend the beads by mixing the plate for 30 sec on a microplate mixer.\nIncubate the plate on the 96-well magnetic bead separation plate for 2 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatants from the sample wells as before.\nRepeat steps 6.1.1.5-6.1.1.8 three more times for a total of 4 washes.\nWith the plate on the 96-well magnetic bead separation plate, visually inspect the wells to confirm even supernatant removal; use a pipette to remove excess residual buffer as necessary. Some buffer will remain in the wells and care must be taken to avoid bead removal or bead drying.\nAdd 50 μl 1x Reaction buffer to each sample well and mix the plate for 30 sec on a microplate mixer to fully resuspend the beads. If needed, use a pipette to fully resuspend the beads.\nAutomated Plate Washing",
    "Setup and program the washer according to Table 4. Clean and flush the washer with high-quality (e.g. nanopure) water.\nPrime the washer by running the program \"Prime\".\nRemove the plate from the rotating plate incubator.\nImmediately place the plate on the 96-well magnetic bead separation plate on the plate washer.\nRun the link program \"Master Wash\". The first program step is a 5 min incubation step where the washer will be stationary.\nFollowing program completion, remove the plate from the washer, add 50 μl 1x Reaction buffer to each sample well, and mix the plate for 30 sec on a microplate mixer to fully resuspend the beads. If needed, use a pipette to fully resuspend the beads.\n7. Assay Initiation and Incubation\nAdd 50 μl 0.5 μM A/E reporter (see Section 1) to each sample well and mix for 30 sec on a microplate mixer to fully resuspend the beads.\nAdd 100 μl water to each unused well on the plate to prevent edge effects.\nSeal the plate with plate sealing tape and incubate the plate using a rotating plate incubator at 750 rpm, 25 °C or RT. Protect the plate from light during incubation.\n8. Data Collection and Analysis\nNote: This assay is a real-time assay that can be measured multiple times until the desired sensitivity is obtained, there are no stop reagents required. Recommended initial read times are 2, 4, and 24 hr incubation time with assay sensitivity increasing with incubation time.\nData collection\n\t\nAt each read time, remove the plate from the rotating plate incubator, remove the sealing tape, and immediately place the plate on the 96-well magnetic bead separation plate. Allow the beads to separate for 2 min.",
    "Place the plate in the microplate reader and measure the emissions at ~470 and ~526 nm under excitation at ~434 nm.\nIf additional read times are desired, resuspend the beads for 30 sec on the microplate mixer, reseal the plate, and return the plate to the rotating plate incubator.\nData analysis\n\t\nCalculate the emission ratio for each sample by dividing the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) value at 526 nm by the RFU value at 470 nm.\nPlot the emission ratio versus the log[BoNT/A] for the standard curve data points. Depending on the BoNT/A potency range tested, a sigmoidal dose-response curve will be obtained (see Representative Results).\nFit the standard curve data with the variable slope dose-response curve Y=Bottom+(Top-Bottom)/(1+10^((logEC50-X)*Hillslope)) where X is the logarithm of concentration, Y is the response, and Y starts at Bottom and goes to Top with a sigmoidal shape.\nDetermine the limits of detection (LOD), limits of quantification (LOQ), and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50). Limits of detection are defined as a sample having an emission ratio less than 3 standard deviations (SDs) below the blank controls (n = 6). Limits of quantification are defined as a sample having an emission ratio less than 10 SDs below the blank controls (n = 6). EC50 is determined from the sigmoidal dose-response curve fit.\nInterpolate the potency of any unknown samples against the sigmoidal dose-response standard curve.\n\t\t\nFor quantitative results, the unknown sample should ideally fall within the linear portion of the standard curve. Approximate the linear portion of the standard curve by calculating the 20-80% total assay response window (e.g. if the emission ratio of the standard curve ranges from 0.5-2.5, the linear range would be the portion of the standard curve that ranges from 0.9-2.1).",
    "For qualitative results, compare the unknown sample against the LOD and LOQ of the standard curve.\nDo not extrapolate unknown samples beyond the limits of the standard curve.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
