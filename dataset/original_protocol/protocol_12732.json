    "The use of mice in this protocol was approved by the Administrative Committee on Animal Welfare of the Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China (Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee Authorization, permit number JSY-DW-2010-02). All institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed.\n1. RNA Extraction\nExtract RNA from rabies-suspected brain tissue, skin biopsies, saliva, or CSF or from RABV-infected cell culture, using guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform-based extraction methods or commercially available viral RNA extraction kits. Use the prepared RNA immediately or store it at -80 °C until required.\n2. Reverse Transcription of the Viral RNA\nRemove the RT reagents listed in Table 1 from the freezer, keep them on ice, and thaw and vortex them before use.\nPrepare 12 µL of RT reaction mix in a 0.2 mL PCR tube with the reagents listed in Table 1. Allow for pipetting variations by preparing a volume of master mix at least one reaction size greater than required.\nAdd 8 µL sample, positive control RNA or negative control to the RT reaction mix within a PCR workstation in a template room. The RT positive control is RNA extracted from the cell culture infected with fixed RABV strain CVS-11 (challenge virus standard-11) and stored at -80 °C. The negative control contains RNase-free ddH2O.\nMix the contents of the RT tubes by vortexing; then, centrifuge briefly.\nLoad the reaction tubes into a thermal cycler. Set up the cDNA synthesis program with the following conditions: 42 °C for 90 min, 95 °C for 5 min, and 4 °C on hold. Set the reaction volume to 20 µL. Start the RT run.\n3. First-round PCR",
    "Keep the PCR reagents listed in Table 2 on ice in a clean room until use; then, thaw and vortex them.\nPrepare the first-round PCR mix in a 0.2 mL PCR tube with the reagents listed in Table 2.\nAdd a 2 µL sample of cDNA or plasmid into the first-round PCR mix within a PCR workstation in a template room. The PCR positive control is CVS-11 cDNA prepared as mentioned in step 2.3 for the above RT method. The PCR negative control is ddH2O.\nTransfer the sealed tubes to a PCR thermal cycler and cycle using the parameters listed in Table 3.\n4. Second-round PCR\nPrepare the second-round PCR mix in a 0.2 mL PCR tube using the reagents listed in Table 4.\nAdd 2 µL of first-round PCR product into the second-round PCR mix. In addition, include ddH2O as a negative control of the second-round PCR.\nPerform PCR thermal cycling using the same parameters as given in step 3.4.\n5. Analysis of the PCR Products by Electrophoresis on Agarose Gels\nPrepare a 1.5% agarose gel by adding 1.5 g of agarose to 100 mL of Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) and dissolving it thoroughly by heating it in a microwave oven.\nAdd ethidium bromide (EB) (at a final concentration of 0.01%) or another commercial EB substitution. Pour the gel into the mold and leave it to solidify at ambient temperature for at least 30 min.\nPrepare the loading samples by mixing 5 µL of each PCR product with 1 µL of 6x loading buffer.\nLoad the samples and suitable DNA marker separately into the wells and run the gel for approximately 30-45 min at 120 V until the dye line is approximately 75%-80% down the gel.",
    "Turn off the power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then, carefully remove the gel from the gel box.\nUse a UV gel documenting device to visualize and photograph the DNA fragments.\n6. Characterization of Nested RT-PCR\n6.1. Specificity and sensitivity for the detection of 18 lyssaviruses plasmids \nOrder 18 commercial plasmids containing the full N gene of each lyssavirus (16 ICTV species and two novel species) for the PCR.\nCalculate the copy number of the plasmid using Avogadro’s number (NA) and the following formula.\n\t\t[(g/µL plasmid DNA)/(plasmid length in bp x 660)] x 6.022 x 1023 = number of molecules/µL\nPrepare stock solutions (2.24 x 109 molecules/µL) of all 18 plasmids in ddH2O.\nPerform nine 10-fold serial dilutions of all 18 plasmids in ddH2O. Dilute 10 µL of each plasmid stock with 90 µL of ddH2O. Vortex and centrifuge briefly.\nPerform PCR amplification as described in sections 3-5.\nAnalyze the specificity and sensitivity of the nested PCR by detecting a series of lyssavirus plasmids.\nDetermination of the detection limit\nAdjust the titer of the rabies virus strain CVS-11 cell culture to 105.5 TCID50/mL (virus titer determined according to the OIE Manual)5.\nPerform five 10-fold serial dilutions of CVS-11 (stock solution is 105.5 TCID50/mL) as described in step 6.1.4.\nPerform the RNA extraction and nested RT-PCR amplification procedures of all viral dilutions as described in sections 1-5.\nComparison of the nested RT-PCR with the \"gold standard\" FAT\nTest all clinical samples by nested RT-PCR, and then, confirm the results with the FAT5 and N gene sequencing9.\nUse normalized data for a statistical analysis with SAS 9.1. Use the kappa test and McNemar’s chi-squared test for a statistical comparison of the diagnostic tests (SAS command: proc freq; table/agree). Calculate confidence intervals assuming abinomial distribution.",
    "Evaluation of the efficacy in testing degraded samples\nExpose two confirmed clinical brain tissue samples of rabid dogs at 37 °C.\nAssay the two samples on each day of exposure at 37 °C by nested RT-PCR, the FAT, and the MIT5.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
