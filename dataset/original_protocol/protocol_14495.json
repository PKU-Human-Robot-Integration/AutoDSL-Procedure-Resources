    "1. EAE Induction in SJL/J Mice\nMice\nUse 11-week-old female SJL/J mice and allow them to habituate to the experimental room for about 7 days. Use n = 10 mice per group.\nFor the assessment of medication effects, administer the drug and placebo for the control group continuously via the drinking water or via food pellets starting 3 or 5 days after immunization (n = 10 per group). During the peak of the disease, administer medication or placebo with milk or 3% sugar water-soaked corn flakes.\nImmunization material\nUse an EAE induction kit consisting of antigen (peptide of proteolipid protein, PLP139-151, 1 mg/mL emulsion) in an emulsion with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Ra) and 2 vials (5 µg each) of lyophilized pertussis toxin (PTX).\nDissolve the PTX (2 µg/mL) in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; i.e., add 1.5 mL of PBS to each PTX tube, mix well, remove with the same pipet tip, and add to 1 mL of PBS in a 50-mL tube); mix well.\nImmunization\nInject PLP/CFA subcutaneously in 2 portions, each 100 µL, both at the base of the tail. Do not inject into the back of the neck, because any immune reactions in the skin in the upper back or neck will disturb imaging of the head and spinal cord.\nInject 100 µL of PTX intraperitoneally (i.p.), twice per mouse, the first 1 - 2 h after immunization and the second at 24 h.\nFor the control mice, inject CFA without PLP (2 portions of 100 µL) plus PTX without PLP.\nMouse handling after immunization\nWeigh the mice every other day up to day 7, and then weigh them daily.\n\t\tNOTE: Mice lose about 1 - 2 g of body weight during EAE. The decline marks the onset of EAE.",
    "Assess clinical symptoms daily from day 7 according to the standard scoring systems (i.e., Score 0: no obvious changes in motor functions; score 0.5: distal paralysis of the tail; score 1: complete tail paralysis; score 1.5: mild paresis of one or both hind legs; score 2: severe paresis of hind legs; score 2.5: complete paralysis of one hind leg; score 3: complete paralysis of both hind legs; score 3.5: complete paralysis of hind legs and paresis of one front leg. Euthanize mice with scores of 3.5 or higher for > 12 h.\nEAE course and time of imaging\nPerform the first imaging at the onset of the disease, when the mice reach scores > 1, which will occur around day 10 - 12 after immunization.\nPerform the second imaging at the peak, which will be reached 1 or 2 days after the initial symptoms develop and will last for 1 - 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Subsequently, the mice will fully recover within 7 to 10 days. Imaging during the intervals may still show vascular leaks, but inflammation indicators should be negative.\n2. Bioluminescent and Near-infrared Imaging of Optic Neuritis and Brain Inflammation\nSetup of the imaging system\nPerform in vivo imaging with any equipment that allows for the analysis of bioluminescence and near-infrared signals.\nKeep mice under 2 - 2.5% isoflurane anesthesia during all imaging procedures.\nPosition one or two mice beside each other in the apparatus using the middle gas supplies. Position the upper spine in the center.\nUse two mice simultaneously, one per group, for evaluation of medication effects to compare pairs. This is important for bioluminescent imaging.",
    "Shield the site of immunization with black cloth and take a photograph and baseline image to assess the correct positioning of the mouse/mice. Use the B-focus with a 6.5-cm distance to the camera for all images.\nInjection and imaging of bioluminescent inflammation probe\nUse the in vivo imaging system settings: Epi-BLI, Em filter open, Ex filter block, fstop 1, binning 8, focus B = 6.5 cm, ad exposure 120 s; take a baseline image.\nInject 100 µL i.p. of the ready-to-use chemiluminescent reagent (40 mg/mL). Mix well before filling the syringe.\nCapture bioluminescence images 5, 10, and 15 min after injection. The time course of the bioluminescent peak differs between animals.\n\t\tNOTE: The peak will occur 5 - 10 min after injection; a decline at 15 min indicates that no further images are required. Use mouse pairs of control and treatment groups to eliminate minor biases due to different time courses.\nFill in descriptions relevant to the experiment. Observe a dialog box pop up automatically; it includes information, such as mouse strain, sex, time point, time of probe injection, group, etc. Save the files all in one folder; they will have time tags and all descriptions.\nInjection and imaging of near-infrared fluorescent nanoparticles for BBB integrity\nUse near-infrared epifluorescence imaging in the B-focus (distance: 6.5 cm). The excitation/emission maxima of the pegylated fluorescent nanoparticles are 675/690 nm. Capture two images at different wavelengths, at Ex640/Em700 and Ex675/Em720; use a 2-s exposure, binning 8, and fstop 2. Take a baseline image.\nInject 70 µL of pegylated fluorescent infrared nanoparticles i.v. through the tail vein and imagine the mice 3 h and 24 h after injection using the above settings. Mix the solution well before filling the syringe.",
    "Inject 0.9% sodium chloride in control mice, which will be needed to assess the specificity of the signal.\nInjection and imaging of the near-infrared fluorescent probe for MMP activity\nShave or depilate the head and upper spine region cautiously one day before taking the baseline image. The skin must not be injured.\nUse near-infrared epifluorescence imaging in the B-focus (distance: 6.5 cm). The excitation/emission maxima of the MMP activatable probe are 680/700 nm. Capture two images at different wavelengths, at Ex640/Em700 and Ex675/Em720; use a 1-s exposure, binning 8, and fstop 2. Take a baseline image.\nAdd 200 µL of 1x PBS to the 1.5-mL tube of the ready-to-use solution (20 nmol/1.5 mL in 1x PBS) so that it will be sufficient for 10 mice; mix well before filling the syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: The provided volume does not take into account that some volume is lost during syringe filling and injection.\nInject 150 µL of the probe i.v. through the tail vein 24 h before imaging. Inject PBS only in control animals to assess the specificity of the signal.\nAt 24 h after injection, take Epi-FL images at least at two wavelengths, Ex640/Em700 and Ex 675/Em720, with the settings explained above (1-s exposure, focus B, binning 8, and fstop 2).\n\t\tNOTE: The use of two wavelengths allows for spectral unmixing by subtracting the unspecific signal.\n3. Image Analyses\nBioluminescence analysis (BLI)\nDouble-click the software to open it.\nIn the upper menu bar, click on the file browser icon, go to the directory of the folder of the experiment, and select it; this will open all files in the folder in a table.\nConfigure the columns showing the descriptions relevant to the experiment.",
    "For quality control, double-click on a file of a non-responder mouse without symptoms of EAE and/or a naïve mouse to check the specificity of the EAE signals.\n\t\tNOTE: There should be no signal in naïve mice and minimal signal in non-responder mice.\n\t\t\nCheck the baseline image before the injection of the probe for each mouse as further control of the specificity of the signal; it should be negative.\nTo select an image, double-click on the first file of the first EAE mouse and check the bioluminescent intensity (LUT bar range) and localization. Check all images one by one. Close the file with the lowest intensity for each mouse (i.e., keep 2 out of 3 images for each mouse).\nImage adjustment and exportation\n\t\t\nDouble-click the first file to be quantified. Observe a new window pop up. Under \"options\" (upper menu), customize the labels to display in each image.\nIn the right tool palette, go to \"image adjustment.\" By default, minimum and maximum intensities are set to \"auto\" and displayed in rainbow pseudocolor. Select \"manual\" to change the settings if necessary.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For example, all exported images may have identical LUT bars (identical minima and maxima) to be easily comparable. The adjustment of the minima and maxima has no impact on the quantitative results.\nClick on image export, select png, the directory, and an image name\nQuantification of Regions of Interest (ROI)\n\t\t\nGo to the \"ROI\" tool in the tool palette. Select the ROI method (circle, rectangular, auto, or free-hand) and the number of ROIs. Observe the ROI window pop up in the image window.",
    "Using the mouse, adjust the size and position. Use identical ROI thresholds for all images if the auto-ROI tool is used. Use identical areas for all images if ROI sizes and positions are defined manually (e.g., circular ROIs).\nClick on \"measure RO.I. Observe a new window pop up. Customize the columns (e.g., file name, animal number, group, experiment, area, total counts, average counts, SD counts, min and max counts, area, time point, time of probe injection, etc.). Save the customized settings. When ready, select all (Ctrl + A), and copy and paste the table into a spreadsheet.\nExport the image as a png with the ROIs in place. Save and close the image file.\nRepeat the procedure (steps 3.1.6 - 3.1.7) for all image files that need to be quantified. Copy all ROI quantifications into the spreadsheet.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, results can be sorted by group, time point, etc. and statistically analyzed. Use the total counts of bioluminescence signals in the ROIs for statistical analyses.\nNear-Infrared (NIR) analysis of fluorescent nanoparticles\nUsing the controls in the software, adjust the threshold of the image.\n\t\tNOTE: This has no impact on the quantitative result.\nVisually compare the images captured at Ex/Em 675/720 and Ex/Em 640/700 to assess the specificity of the signal.\nUse the images captured at Ex/Em 675/720 for the quantitative analysis (excitation maximum: 680 nm). Define ROIs, for which the auto-ROI tool may be used. Adjust the auto-ROI threshold and use it for all images. Quantify the total radiant efficiency in ROIs (see step 3.1).\nNear-Infrared (NIR) analysis of protease-sensitive probe\nUsing software controls, adjust the threshold of the image.",
    "NOTE: This has no impact on the quantitative result. Perform spectral unmixing of the auto-fluorescence. The unmixing tool is implemented in Living Image. The auto-unmixing uses the Ex/Em 640/700 as the specific and 675/720 as the auto-fluorescent image.\nSelect the unmixed image and define the ROIs, as described above. Use the total radiant efficiency in ROIs for quantitative and statistical analyses.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
