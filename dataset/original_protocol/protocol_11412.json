    "The current study (NCT00852111) was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland. Participants enrolled in this study were euthymic men, 18 years of age or older, who were diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer with or without prior prostatectomy and were scheduled to receive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Potential participants were excluded if they had a progressive disease that could cause significant fatigue, had psychiatric disease within the past five years, had uncorrected hypothyroidism or anemia, or had a second malignancy. Individuals who used sedatives, steroids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents were also excluded. Healthy control blood samples were obtained at the NIH Department of Transfusion medicine from healthy donors under an IRB-approved protocol (NCT00001846). All participants are recruited at the Magnuson Clinical Research Center at the NIH. Signed written informed consents were obtained prior to study participation.\n1. Mitochondrial Function Measurement Preparation (Day 1 of the Experiment)\nHydrate Sensor Cartridge (see Table of Materials; approximate duration: 5 min).\n\t\nRemove Sensor Cartridge from package. Add 200 μL Calibrant solution into each well of the utility plate, then fill each moat with 400 μL Calibrant solution.\nReturn Sensor plate to the utility plate, which now has Calibrant solution in it. Hydrate the Cartridge in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: Sensor Cartridge needs to be hydrated for a minimum of 4 h and a maximum of 72 h.\n2. Clinical Sample Preparation (Day 2 of the Experiment)\nMeasure fatigue using the 13-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F)2,23,24 at baseline (prior to EBRT initiation), midpoint and completion of EBRT, and 1-year post-EBRT.",
    "Use a 0 - 4 scale for each item response, where a 0 represents \"not at all\" and a 4 indicates that the respondent relates to the corresponding statement \"very much.\" Total scores should range from 16 - 53, with lower scores reflecting high fatigue intensity.\nDefine fatigue as a FACIT-F score lower than 43, with a FACIT-F score of ≥43 indicating absence of or not clinically-meaningful fatigue2.\n\t\tNOTE: A FACIT-F score of 43 best divides fatigue scores of cancer patients and the general population2.\nInclude the following 13 items in the FACIT Fatigue Scale: 1) I feel fatigued; 2) I feel weak all over; 3) I feel listless (\"washed out\"); 4) I feel tired; 5) I have trouble starting things because I'm tired; 6) I have trouble finishing things because I am tired; 7) I have energy; 8) I am able to do my usual activities; 9) I need to sleep during the day; 10) I am too tired to eat; 11) I need help doing my usual activities; 12) I am frustrated by being too tired to do the things I want to do; and 13) I have to limit my social activity because I am tired.\nIsolate PBMC from freshly collected blood samples (approximate duration: 1 h).\n\t\nCollect 8 mL of blood into a Mononuclear Cells Preparation Tube (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Blood samples should be processed within 2 h of collection. The quality of PBMCs may be compromised if blood samples are processed more than 2 h after sample collection.\nCentrifuge at 1,750 x g for 30 min at room temperature (18 - 25 °C). Transfer the cloudy layer to a 15 mL conical tube. Add up to 15 mL of PBS and invert 5 times.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 x g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant without disturbing pellet. Re-suspend the pellet by adding up to 10 mL PBS, and invert 5 times.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard liquid supernatant and re-suspend cells in 1 mL PBS. Transfer the PBMCs to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 610 x g for 10 minutes. Carefully remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in complete RPMI-1640 (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM Penicillin/Streptomycin).\nCoat cell plates for non-adherent cells (approximate duration: 30 min).\n\t\nPrepare cell and tissue adhesive solution (see Table of Materials) by diluting the stock solution in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate pH 8.0. The working solution should be at 3.5 μg/cm2 of surface area.\n\t\tNOTE: This solution contains polyphenolic proteins extracted from the marine mussel, Mytilus edulis. These proteins are key components of the glue secreted by the mussel to anchor itself to surfaces. We find that Cell-Tak works the best with PBMCs.\nAdd 100 μL of the diluted adhesive solution to each well and incubate for at least 20 min at room temperature. Wash three times with DI water and air dry.\n3. Mitochondrial Function Measurement\nPreparation of Assay Media (approximate duration: 10 min).\n\tNOTE: Assay media must be freshly prepared on the day of the experiment.\n\t\nAdd L-glutamine, pyruvate, and glucose to base media (the same constituents as Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), but without any sodium bicarbonate, glucose, glutamine, or sodium pyruvate) to make assay media. Warm media up to 37 °C, then adjust pH to 7.4.\n\t\tNOTE: Concentrations of L-glutamine, pyruvate, and glucose are usually the same as concentrations in normal growth media, but can be adjusted based on the assay.",
    "Prepare PBMCs for the Mito Stress test (approximate duration: 2 h).\n\t\nPlate enough PBMCs from Step 2 into each well to reach 80 - 90% confluency. In our experience, 1.5 x 105 cells/well yielded the most consistent results.\n\t\tNOTE: Wells A and H are background wells and should only contain assay media with no cells. In wells B to G, we recommend plating at least 3 - 6 wells per patient sample in order to account for outliers.\nSpin plates down at 200 x g for 2 min to allow cells to adhere to the bottom of the wells. Wash the cells once with Assay media. This step removes serum and sodium bicarbonate from the growth media.\n\t\tNOTE: In our experience, the washing step typically removes 20 - 30% of cells.\nAdd 180 μL Assay media into each well, including background wells A and H. Incubate in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator for 45 - 60 min.\nRunning the Mito Stress Test\n\t\nReconstitute drugs in the Mito Stress Kit with assay media as follows:\n\t\t\nOligomycin: Add 252 μL assay media into the vial to generate a stock solution at 50 μM.\nFCCP: Add 288 μL of assay media into the vial to generate a stock solution at 50 μM.\nAntimycin A/Rotenone: Add 216 μL of assay media into the vial to generate a stock solution at 25 μM.\nVortex reconstituted drugs for approximately 1 minute. Dilute into working solutions.\n\t\tNOTE: Concentrations of the working solutions should be titrated and pre-determined prior to the experiment depending on the cell type. For PBMCs, we find that 1 μM of Oligomycin, 1 μM FCCP, and 0.5 μM antimycin A/Rotenone work the best.\nPipette the drugs into each port in the sensor cartridge sequentially:",
    "Port A: Pipette 20 μL of 10 μM Oligomycin, for a final concentration in each well of 1 μM.\nPort B: Pipette 22 μL of 10 μM FCCP, for a final concentration in each well of 1 μM.\nPort C: Pipette 25 μL of 5 μM antimycin A/rotenone for a final concentration in each well of 0.5 μM.\nSelect \"Mito Stress Test\" on an extracellular flux instrument. Follow instrument prompt and insert the sensor cartridge. The instrument will automatically perform sensor calibration. Insert cell plate after sensor calibration, and the instrument will finish the rest of the assay. Oxygen dynamics is measured at 530 nm (excitation)/650nm (emission), and proton concentration is measured at 470 nm (excitation)/ 530 nm (emission).\n4. Normalization of Mitochondrial Function Data\nPrepare Cell Proliferation Assay solution (approximate duration: 5 min).\n\t\nAdd 48 μL nucleic acid stain (500x) and 240 μL background suppressor to 11.7 mL PBS (2x). The nucleic acid stain is a cell-permeant DNA-binding dye, and the background suppressor is a masking dye which blocks dead cells or cells with compromised cell membrane integrity from being stained. The combination of the DNA-binding dye and the background suppressor ensures that only live cells are stained.\nAdd equal volume of 2x working solution (180 μL) directly into the medium in each well after the Mito Stress Test has completed.\nIncubate the cells in the presence of cell proliferation assay solution in a 37 °C incubator for 45 - 60 min. Quantify the number of live cells (fluorescent) on a plate reader at 508 nm (excitation)/527 nm (emission) and normalize OCR data (approximate duration: 10 min).\n\tNOTE: in addition to the number live cells, users may also choose to normalize their data with the total number of cells, amount of nucleic acid, protein concentrations, etc.",
