Coat 35-mm glass bottom dish with 0.01% \\(w/v) poly-lysine, rock gently to ensure even coating of the culture surface \n  2. After 5 min, remove poly-lysine by aspiration\n  3. Rinse surface with sterile tissue culture grade water 5 times, and remove water\n  4. Dry the plate at 60°C for one hour\n  \n**b)** Cell seeding and transfection\n5. Seed HEK293 cells \\(2×10<sup>5</sup> cells) at pre-coated 35-mm glass bottom dish and culture for one day\n  6.

Add TG to a final concentration of 1 μM for 5 min to trigger store deletion. The nominal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS also facilitates stable formation of STIM1 puncta at ER-PM junctions.\n  9. Add biotin-phenol \\(at a final concentration of 0.5 mM; Note 1) to the medium for 30 min at 37 °C \n  10. Add freshly-prepared H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> \\(1 mM) to medium for exactly 1 min at room temperature \\(RT) to initiate biotinylation\n  11. Stop the reaction immediately by washing cells with 2 ml quencher solution for 1 min; repeat five times\n  12. Wash cells with 2 ml PBS three times and fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde at RT for 30 min\n  13. Rinse with PBS three times\n  14. Treat cells with cold methanol at -20 °C for 10 min\n  15.

Wash with PBS ten times to remove unbound streptavidin-DyLight594\n  19. Capture images using a confocal microscope or total internal reflection fluorescence microscope \\(as exemplified in **Fig. 1**)\n  The control samples were not treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> whilst other steps remain the same as described above.\n**Note 1**: The biotin-phenol solution should be freshly prepared for each experiment. The amounts of biotin-phenol and the reaction time may vary from case to case to biotinylate surrounding proteins whilst minimizing unspecific labelling. \n• **>>>Enrichment of biotinylated proteins, silver staining and Western blotting<<<** \n**a)** Coat plate with poly-L-Lysine as described above\n**b)** Cell transfection and proximity biotinylation \n1. Seed HEK293 cells on pre-coated 10-cm plates and culture for one day\n  2. Transfect GFP-STIM1-APEX2 \\(5 μg) using lipofactamine 3000\n  3. 24 h posttransfection, add biotin-phenol \\(at a final concentration of 0.5 mM) to the culture medium for 30min at 37 °C; Note 2 \n  4. Add biotin-phenol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as described above\n  5. After 1 min of labeling, wash cells immediately with the quencher solution five times; 10 ml per wash\n  \n**Note 2**: To capture protein complexes surrounding STIM1 after store depletion, replace DMEM medium with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HBBS solution and then treat cells in 1 μM TG for 5 min to trigger store depletion \n_For steps 6-13, all the steps should be operated at 4 °C and the samples should be kept on ice to reduce protein degradation_\n6. Scrap cells from culture dish and centrifuge at 5,000 ×g for 15 min",

Equilibrate resin with RIPA buffer for 30 min and shake gently\n  10. Centrifuge at 2,000 ×g for 1 min to remove buffer\n  11. Incubate cell lysates with resin \\(8 mg of biotinylated protein/ml of settled resin) and gently rotate the mixture for 4-6 h to enrich biotinylated proteins\n  12. Rinse beads with 1 ml PBS supplemented with 1×protease inhibitor cocktail, centrifuge at 2,000 ×g and remove buffer\n  13. Repeat wash step for ten times to remove unbounded proteins, discard wash buffer\n  \n**c)** Resolving biotinylated proteins on SDS-PAGE\n14. Boil resin with LDS sample buffer \n  15. Separate proteins by 4-12% Bis-Tris protein gels \n  Optional: elute enriched proteins from beads using elution buffer \\(8 M urea, pH1.5)\n16. Stain SDS-PAGE using the Silver Stain Kit; Note 3\n  17. Excise desired bands for further mass spectrometry analysis \\(in-gel digestion)\n  18. Another SDS-PAGE resolving the same samples is subjected to western blotting to detect biotinylated proteins by streptavidin-HRP \\(1:4000)\n  \n**Note 3**: for the silver staining, ultrapure water is used for buffer preparation and gel washing. Use clean gloves to reduce contamination. Scalpel should be changed after excising each gel slice to reduce cross-sample contamination.\n**d)** Elution of biotinylated proteins for in-solution digestion\nAfter step 13, enriched biotinylated proteins can also be eluted and precipitated by acetone for mass spectrometry\n19. Elute biotinylated proteins using 2 resin volumes of elution buffer \\(8 M urea, pH 1.5)",

    "LC-MS/MS analyses of the in-gel or in-solution digested samples were performed on a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to an Easy-nLC 1000 HPLC. Peptides were loaded on a pre-column \\(75 mm ID, 8 cm long, packed with ODS-AQ 120 Å, 10 mm reversed-phase beads from YMC Inc.) and separated on an analytical column \\(75 mm ID, 11 cm long, packed with Luna C18 100 Å, 1.8 mm resin from Welch Materials) with an acetonitrile gradient from 0–28% in 55 min and 28-80% in another 6 min \\(with 0.1% FA in the mobile phase from beginning to end) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The top 15 most intense precursor ions from each full scan \\(resolution 70,000) were isolated for HCD MS2 \\(resolution 17,500; Normalized collision energy 27) with a dynamic exclusion time of 20 s. Precursor ions of a 1+, > 6+ or unassigned charge state were excluded.\n**d)** Peptide identification\nThe MS2 spectra were searched against the Uniprot-human database \\(forward and reversed sequences) using ProLucid \\(12) with mass accuracy for precursor and fragment ions both set at 50 ppm and carbamidomethylation on cysteine as fixed modification. The ProLuCID search results were filtered using DTASelect 2.0 \\(13) with 10 ppm mass accuracy for precursor mass and a 1% FDR cutoff at the spectral level. At least two peptides were required to identify a protein and the protein-level FDR is <1%. Positive hits were primarily selected by three stringent criteria: first, for each candidate protein, at least two peptides were detected in LC-MS/MS; second, hits detected in our two control groups were discarded; third, the candidate proteins must be detected in at least two out of four repeated experiments."
