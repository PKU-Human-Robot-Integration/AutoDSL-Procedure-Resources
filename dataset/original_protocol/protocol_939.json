    "Preparation of RNA samples\nTiming: 1h\n1. The quality of the starting RNA samples is critical for the success of the PEAT strategy. We recommend TRIzol reagent to isolate total RNA from higher eukaryotes \\(both animal and plant). For yeast cells, hot-phenol approach1 tends to give the most reproducible results. To avoid potential biases that may incur during library construction, it is preferable to start with ~150 μg total RNA if the sample is easy to be obtained. For low-abundance samples, it is possible to reduce the amount to 10 μg. In this protocol, we use Drosophila embryos to demonstrate the PEAT strategy. One can adapt the protocol to construct PEAT libraries for other species as well\n  \nRNA cleanup\nTiming: 1 h\n2. RNeasy Mini kit \\(QIAGEN) is used to remove genomic DNA contamination in RNA preparation. On-column DNase I digestion step is included according to the manufacturer’s protocol Starting with ~150 μg total RNA, the final product is eluted with 80 μl nuclease-free water.\n  \n3. \\(Optional Step) The integrity of the purified RNA is checked with1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel \\(FA gel). Alternatively, Agilent RNA Nano Labchip can be used to determine the RNA quality. Proceed to the next step if the RNA samples pass quality control. \n  \nPolyA+ RNA selection with Dynabeads \\(dT)25\nTiming: 3 h\n4.
