    "The procedure below outlines four main steps: (A) preparation of mammalian cells, (B) cell differentiation, (C) cell counting, and (D) NBD-lipid uptake assay. This procedure was originally applied to study NBD-lipid internalization in mouse myoblast C2C12 cells (Grifell-Junyent et al., 2022). If this procedure is to be used with other cell types, adjustments might be required regarding the choice of cell culture medium, the requirement for coated surfaces, the cell density for microscopy, and possible detachment during incubation at low temperature (20 °C).Preparation of mammalian cells Grow adherent cells in sterile culture vessels (T-75 flask) in growth medium (see Recipes) in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) until they reach ~60%–70% confluency.Note: C2C12 cells will differentiate if grown too confluent and start to fuse. Differentiation and fusion are accompanied by transcriptional changes, which can lead to different results. Aspirate and discard growth media with a sterile serological pipette.Wash cells twice with 5 mL of HBSS (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free, pre-warmed at 37 °C) using a sterile serological pipette.Add 1.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution (pre-warmed at 37 °C) using a sterile serological pipette and incubate the T-75 flasks in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity). Tilt the vessel back and forth a few times to make sure the thin layer of trypsin is evenly spread.After 5 min, check for detachment by gently tilting the vessel and/or observing under an inverted microscope. If all cells have not detached in 5 min, incubate for an additional 1–2 min and check again. Continue to incubate and check as necessary, only until cells are no longer attached to the plate surface.Note: Avoid prolonged incubation period with trypsin-EDTA solution. Stop trypsinization by adding 7.",
    "5 mL of growth medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipes) to the cell suspension.Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL Falcon and set aside 100 μL in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for cell counting, e.g., using the hemocytometer (see section C).Centrifuge cells in the 15 mL Falcon tube at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant to remove the trypsin-EDTA-containing medium from the cells.Add 10 mL of fresh growth medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipes) to the cell pellet and re-suspend completely by gently pipetting up and down using a serological pipette.Note: Cells in suspension settle quickly. After counting, we recommend gently re-suspending the cell suspension approximately every 2–3 min when seeding multiple dishes. After counting (see Section C), seed 1.5 × 104 cells per 35 mm polymer bottom dishes and add growth medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipe 1) up to a final volume of 1 mL per dish.Note: Prepare at least one dish per lipid to be analyzed plus one more for a negative control. We used a low cell number for seeding because C2C12 is a fast-growing cell line (doubling time:  ~20 h) and this cell number guarantees that single cells are still present when the assay is performed the next day. Keep the cells in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) overnight.Cell differentiation To test the lipid uptake abilities and changes during differentiation of C2C12 cells, grow cells in 35 mm polymer bottom dishes in growth medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipes) in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) until they reach 100% confluency.",
    "Note: To check for changes during differentiation and fusion, we analyze cells before they grow confluent (indicated as day -1), cells when they reach 100% confluency (indicated as day 0), and cells that were grown in differentiation medium for a specific number of days (Grifell-Junyent et al., 2022). After reaching 100% confluency, aspirate and discard the growth medium.Wash cells twice with 1 mL of HBSS (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free, pre-warmed at 37 °C).Add 1 mL of differentiation medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipes) per 35 mm polymer bottom dish and keep the cells in a humidified tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity).Change the differentiation medium (pre-warmed at 37 °C, see Recipes) on a daily basis.Note: We culture the cells up to seven days in differentiation medium. Cell counting The purpose of this step is to quantify the cell concentration to resuspend the cells at the appropriate concentration for the NBD-lipid uptake assay. We routinely use the trypan blue hemocytometer assay. Alternative cell counting methods, such as automatic cell counters, may be used.Prepare the hemocytometer by cleaning the chambers and coverslip with ethanol. Dry the hemocytometer by using lint-free tissue. Place the glass coverslip over the counting chambers.Note: The correct placement is indicated by the appearance of the Newton rings.Add 100 μL of 0.4% trypan blue stock solution to 100 μL of cell suspension (step A6) to obtain a 1:1 dilution using a P200 Eppendorf pipette.Load the hemocytometer with 10 μL of cell suspension per counting chamber with a P20 Eppendorf pipette and examine immediately under an inverted phase contrast microscope at low magnification (e.g., 5×–10× magnification).Count the number of viable (seen as bright cells) and non-viable cells (stained blue) in the large outer quadrants.Calculate the percentage of viable cells: % viable cells = [1.",
    "00 - (number of blue cells ÷ number of total cells)] × 100. Cell viability should be at least 95%.Calculate the cell concentration based on the premise that each square accounts for a volume of 10-4 mL of cell suspension.To obtain the total number of viable cells per milliliter of aliquot, multiply the total number of viable cells by 2 (the dilution factor for trypan blue) and the correction factor of 104 (volume of each square).NBD-lipid uptake assay (see Figure 2) The assay is typically performed at 20 °C to reduce endocytosis. For this, all solutions are pre-warmed at 20 °C before use and all incubation steps are performed in an incubator at 20 °C.Prior to the start of the assay, prepare BSA solution in TBSS (see Recipes).Prepare conical bottom glass tubes with NBD-lipid stocks (see Recipes) suspended in 10 μL of DMSO using a P20 Eppendorf pipette for each cell sample.To prepare the cells for labeling, carefully aspirate and discard the growth medium using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.Wash cells twice with 1 mL of TBSS (pre-warmed at 20 °C, see Recipes) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.After washing, add 1 mL of TBSS (pre-warmed at 20 °C, see Recipes) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.To block the conversion of NBD-lipids by cellular phospholipases, add 5 μL of PMSF (see Recipes) and 1 μL of OBAA (see Recipes) to the cells using a P2 and P20 Eppendorf pipette to a final concentration of 1 mM and 5 μM, respectively,Gently mix by tilting the dish and incubate for 10 min at 20 °C in an incubator.",
    "To start labeling, remove 200 μL of TBSS from the cells in the dish, transfer into the conical bottom glass containing the DMSO NBD-lipid suspension (see step D2), mix well using a P200 Eppendorf pipette, and transfer the NBD-lipid suspension to the cells in the dish.Gently mix by tilting the Petri dish and incubate for 60 min in a tissue culture incubator at 20 °C.Note: If different NBD-lipids are to be tested, it is recommended to examine them one after the other rather than in parallel, as the time of microscopy would otherwise result in different timeframes of incubation. After incubation, mount the dish on the microscope for imaging prior to BSA wash.Note: At this point, cells can be tested for metabolic conversion of the NBD-lipids using lipid extraction and thin layer chromatography analysis, as previously described (Herrera et al., 2022). For subsequent BSA back extraction, remove the dish from the microscope.Remove TBSS and wash cells twice with 0.5 mL of BSA solution in TBSS (pre-warmed at 20 °C, see Recipes) for 1 min using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette.Note: We routinely use a BSA concentration of 5% (w/v) for NBD-lipid extraction. However, the volume of BSA required for extraction, as well as the incubation time, may vary depending on cell type and lipid analog used in the assay (Fellmann et al., 2000). To determine the optimal conditions, label the cells at 4 °C and measure the cell-associated fluorescence after a different time of contact of the cells with BSA. Add 1 mL of TBSS (pre-warmed at 20 °C, see Recipes) using a P1000 Eppendorf pipette and image on a confocal microscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4771/bioprotoc-13-13-4771-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "For labeling, cells pre-incubated with phospholipase inhibitors at 20 °C are supplemented with NBD-lipids and then incubated for up to 60 min to allow lipid internalization. After a TBSS wash, cells are analyzed using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Uptake of NBD-lipids results in intracellular labeling, while non-internalized NBD-lipids are found at the plasma membrane. Subsequently, back exchange with BSA is performed to remove non-internalized NBD-lipids at the plasma membrane, which allows visualizing only the internalized portion of the NBD-lipids."
