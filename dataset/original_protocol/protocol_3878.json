Work is performed within laboratories rated at biosafety level 1 or 2 according to the local regulations. All cell cultures are maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. All media are pre-warmed in a 37°C water bath before use.\nReviving human N/TERT-1 keratinocytes from frozen stock\nRemove a vial of cryopreserved N/TERT-1 cells containing ∼1 × 106 cells from liquid nitrogen and thaw for 1–2 min in a 37°C water bath.\nDisinfect the cryovial with 70% EtOH.\nTransfer the content of the vial to a sterile canonical 50 mL tube, and slowly add 12 mL DMEM 10% FCS to the cells.\nCritical: Cells are very sensitive at this stage and should be handled with care.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAspirate supernatant, and carefully resuspend cell pellet in 10 mL complete K-SFM\nTransfer cell suspension to a 100 mm culture dish and place at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.\nThe next day, aspirate medium and replace with 10 mL of fresh pre-warmed complete K-SFM. Examine cell survival and morphology under microscope.\nChange growth medium every other day. Cells are ready for passaging when they reach ∼30% confluence (to keep confluency low which is preferred with N/TERT-1. Other keratinocyte cell lines may tolerate to be grown to a higher confluency before differentiating). Generally, this takes ∼3–4 days after thawing.\nPassaging human N/TERT-1 keratinocytes",
    "When cells reach ∼30% confluence, remove the culture medium and add 0.5 mL warm TrypLE per 100 mm dish. Incubate the dish for approximately 5 min at 37°C until the cells have detached.\nAdd 1.5 mL DMEM 10% FBS, resuspend the cells and take 20 μL suspension for counting cell number. Transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge for 5 min, 300 × g, at 20°C–22°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend in warm complete K-SFM. Seed 2–3 × 105 cells into a new 100 mm dish. Rock the plate gently to distribute cells evenly. Place plates at 37°C in a humidified incubator and monitor growth every day. Change growth medium every second day by removing medium from the dish and adding 10 mL warm complete K-SF medium.\nCritical: Do not move the dish in the incubator for at least 4 h after seeding the cells. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for representative morphologies of healthy keratinocyte colonies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/791-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. DIC pictures of keratinocyte colonies\n(A) represents a good colony.\n(B) represents differentiating colonies not suited for organotypic cultures. Scale bar equals 20 μm.\nCulturing human fibroblasts and HEK293T cells\nTiming: ∼1 week\nThis step provides a general protocol for culturing human fibroblasts and HEK293T cells.\nCulturing human fibroblasts and HEK293T cells\nHuman fibroblasts (we use MRC-5, but other dermal fibroblasts can be used) and HEK293T cells are grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.\nPassaging - both cell lines are trypsinized (TrypLE) at ∼80–90% confluence. Trypsin is neutralized with DMEM/FBS and cells are seeded at ∼25%–30% confluency in a new T75 or 100 mm petri dish.\nGeneration of lentiCRISPR-v2 puro/blast vector with inserted gRNA sequence\nTiming: 3–4 days",
    "We use validated (Narimatsu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) or GPP predicted (Doench et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) sgRNA targeting the exons of particular glycogenes. This step describes how to insert sgRNA coding sequence into lentiCRIPSR-v2 vector containing a puromycin or blasticidin resistance cassette.\nAnneal the forward and reverse oligos:\nPrepare the following solution in a clean PCR tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_791_13.csv\nPlace the tube in a PCR machine and use the following program to anneal the two oligos: 95°C for 5 min; ramp down to 25°C at 5°C per min\nDilute the annealed oligos 1:200 with MiliQ water and use in the ligation reaction (see step 6a)\nDigestion of lentiCRISPR-v2 puro/blast vector with Bsmb1 restriction enzyme\nSet up the following digestion reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_791_14.csv\nIncubate at 55°C for 30 min\nAlternatives: Longer incubation time at lower temperature is also possible, such as 2 h at 37°C\nCheck digestion by running 2–3 μL of the digested product on 0.8% agarose gel\nNote: Digested lentiCRISPR-v2 vector results in two bands with the size of 1885 bp and 12990 bp\nMeasure concentration of the digested product on nanodrop\nLigate the annealed and phosphorylated oligo duplexes (from step 4) into the digested lentiCRISPR-v2 vector (from step 5)\nSet up the following ligation reaction\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_791_15.csv\nIncubate at 20°C–22°C for 2 h 30 min. Ligation mixture can now be used for bacterial transformation\nTransformation of Stbl3 E. coli cells\nNote: (1) Set a water bath to heat to 42°C. (2) Pre-warm SOC medium to 20°C–22°C.\nThaw chemical competent Stbl3 E. coli cells on ice for 10 min\nAdd 2 μL ligation mixture from step 6b\nKeep on ice for 15–20 min\nHeat-shock in a water bath at 42°C for 30 s\nPlace on ice for 2 min\nAdd 200 μL room-temperature SOC medium and shake (300 rpm) at 37°C for 1 h",
    "Plate cells on agar plates containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin and incubate at 37°C for 16–18 h\nPerform colony PCR to test for positive transformants\nPrepare the following mastermix for colony PCR\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_791_16.csv\nPick up and lyse single bacterial colonies:\nTransfer 10 μL 0.5 M NaOH to clean eppendorf tubes\nScrape a colony with a clean stick and rinse the stick in the tube containing 0.5 M NaOH\nIncubate for 5 min at 20°C–22°C\nAdd 5 μL 1 M Tris\nIncubate for 5 min at 20°C–22°C\nAdd 85 μL MiliQ water\nAdd 1 μL of this lysate to the mastermix (step 8a) to perform colony PCR\nRun the following PCR program\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_791_17.csv\nNote: Touch down 72°C-1°/cycle from cycle one\nRun the PCR product on a 2.5% agarose gel. Positive colonies should give a product of 267 bp.\nPurify plasmid DNA by Midiprep\nChoose a positive colony and inoculate in 200 mL LB medium containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin\nIncubate at 37°C in a shaking incubator for 16–18 h\nWe use NucleoBond Xtra Midi EF (Macherey-Nagel) kit to isolate plasmid DNA.\nTest the plasmid DNA with suitable restriction enzymes\nProduction of lentiviral particles in HEK293T cells\nTiming: ∼4–6 days\nThis section describes the production of lentiviral particles using pCMV-VSV-G envelope and psPAX2 packaging plasmid, which can be used with 2nd and 3rd generation lentiviral vectors. Transfected HEK293T cells will produce lentiviral particles which accumulate in the culture medium supernatant (Ferreira et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) and can be used directly for transduction of N/TERT-1 keratinocytes\nCritical: Cells should be actively growing and not cultured for many weeks before use when seeded. HEK293T cells should be ∼80–90% confluent on the day of transfection.\nSeed 5 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate the day before transfection.",
    "Alternatives: Seed 1 × 105 HEK293T cells per well in a 6-well plate and incubate for 2–3 days. Grow cells in 2 mL DMEM 10% FBS.\nOn the day of transfection, aspirate off culture medium and carefully add 1.5 mL fresh growth medium containing serum.\nFor each transfection sample prepare DNA-PEI complexes as follows:\nMix the following components in a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_791_18.csv\nVortex the tube vigorously for 15–20 s and leave for 20 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd the Opti-MEM mixture dropwise to each well. Mix gently and incubate cells for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.\nOn the following day, carefully remove the culture medium and add warm complete K-SFM. Incubate cells for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.\nCritical: It is important to exchange the medium with K-SFM at this step. Within the next 24 h the lentiviral particles will accumulate in the culture medium and this medium is going to be used to transduce WT N/TERT-1 keratinocytes.\nHarvest lentivirus-containing medium and filter through a 0.45-μm microfilter. The filtrate is used directly for transduction of N/TERT-1 keratinocytes (see steps 16 and 17).\nAlternatives: The filtered lentivirus-containing medium from step 15 can be placed immediately at -80°C for later use.\nLentiviral transduction of N/TERT-1 keratinocytes\nTiming: ∼10–12 days\nThis step provides a detailed protocol for the lentiviral transduction of N/TERT-1 keratinocytes necessary for the generation of knockout clones.\nTwo days before transduction, seed N/TERT-1 keratinocytes in 6 well plates. Seed 3 × 104 cells per well and include an extra well with cells to serve as a negative control.\nNote: It usually takes 2 days for the cells to reach 30% confluence and be ready for transduction.",
    "On the day of transduction, mix 1 mL of complete K-SFM and 1 mL of the filtered lentivirus-containing medium produced by HEK293T cells (see previous section). Add 4 μg/mL polybrene and mix carefully by inverting the tube. Do not vortex.\nRemove the culture medium of the N/TERT-1 cells. Add the lentivirus-containing medium from step 15 to the cells. Incubate cells overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.\n24 h post-transduction, remove medium containing virus and replace with complete K-SFM.\nStart selection of knockout clones 48 h post-transduction: remove grow medium and add complete KSFM containing the suitable antibiotic for selection.\nPuromycin selection - use 1 μg/mL puromycin. Non-transduced WT N/TERT-1 cells should die within 3 days of selection.\nBlasticidin selection - use 5 μg/mL blasticidin. Non-transduced WT N/TERT-1 cells should die within 4–5 days of selection.\nNote: Change media containing antibiotic every second day\nWhen cells reach ∼70% confluence, trypsinize the cells and take an aliquot for IDAA (Yang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) (see step 22). Seed 1/5 of the cells into a new well of a 6-well plate and freeze the rest of the bulk. After 3 days, passage cells again and expand to a 100 dish if necessary.\nIsolation of knockout clones\nThis step describes how we perform isolation and validation of isogenic knockout clones.\nQuick DNA extract for INDELs detection by IDAA\nTake an aliquot of bulk cells and transfer to a well in a 96 well plate. Fill up with 50 μL grow medium\nOn the next day, remove medium and add 30 μL CoboXtract buffer\nIncubate at 70°C for 20 min\nIncubate at 98°C for 10 min",
    "Use this crude DNA extract for setting up a PCR reaction with primers flanking the DNA cut size yielding a product of >200 bp. Analyze the presence of out of frame INDELs by performing IDAA (Yang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21], Bennett et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). We use ABI PRISMTM 3010 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher) and Peak Scanner Software V1.0 (Thermo Fisher).\nOnce you have validated the presence of knockout clones in the bulk, you can perform serial dilution of the bulk cells to isolate knockout clones.\nHarvest the bulk and take an aliquot to count cell number\nDilute cells in order to seed 0.4 cells per well in a 96-well plate\nNote: For each KO, we recommend you seed 4–5 96-well plates\nIncubate plates at 37°C in a humidified incubator\nAfter 4–5 days single colonies should become visible under the microscope. Mark the wells with single colonies and change grow medium with complete K-SFM\nWhen cells become large enough (1/3 of the well covered), cells are trypsinized and expanded to a 24-well plate. Take out and aliquote for IDAA and DNA sequencing to select for positive KO colonies\nWhen cells reach 30% confluence, expand them to a 12-well plate\nPositive candidates are subjected to another round of single cell cloning\nCritical: It is critical to be sure that you have only one cell per well, when cloning KO cells. Be sure to choose cells that grow and pick them before the colonies start differentiating.\nCasting collagen/fibroblast gels for organotypic cultures\nTiming: ∼ 4–6 days\nThis step provides a recipe for casting collagen/fibroblast gels for organotypic cultures (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: Keep all components sterile and chilled in an ice bucket. Have everything ready and all of the solutions chilled before you trypsinize the fibroblasts.",
    "Make acellular gel: prepare a deepwell plate (6 well size), by adding one cell culture insert into each well. Use sterile forceps.\nMix in a 50 mL tube on ice the following components, without making air bubbles:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_791_19.csv\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. How to make the dermal equivalent of the organotypic cultures, related to step 25\nMix gently and add a few drops of 1 M NaOH to the solution (the color should change to orange/light pink.\nCarefully pipet 1 mL of the acellular gel mixture into the culture insert and make sure it covers the whole bottom of the insert. Leave to polymerize in the incubator while preparing the fibroblasts and the cellular gel.\nTrypsinize fibroblasts with TrypLE. Neutralize and spin down. Count the cells and resuspend the fibroblasts in 10% calf serum DMEM at a concentration of 1 X 106 cells/mL. You will need 3 X 105 fibroblasts for each 6 well tray.\nMaking of cellular gel\nMix in a 50 mL tube on ice the following components without making air bubbles:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_791_20.csv\nMix gently and add a few drops of 1 M NaOH to neutralize the solution (the color should change to orange/light pink\nQuickly add 3 mL to the culture inserts on top of the acellular gel. Avoid air bubbles.\nPlace the tray in the incubator for approximately 30 min and the gels will be fully polymerized.\nFill DMEM 10% FCS in the well (18 mL) and 2 mL on top of the gel. Do not spray.",
    "After 4–6 days the gels are contracted and appear macroscopically as a slightly shrunken, white disk. They are now ready for keratinocytes. In our hands and for our specific modeling format, this action results in successful and reproducible organotypic cultures, possibly due to active deposition and re-organization of the ECM by fibroblasts.\nSeeding keratinocytes on the casted gels\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes how to seed keratinocytes on the contracted collagen/fibroblast gels.\nTrypsinize N/TERT-1 cells to be seeded (WT and validated knockouts) and adjust concentration to 1 × 107 cells/mL.\nNote: 3 × 105 cells need to be plated for each gel\nAspirate medium from the bottom of each well in the deepwell plate.\nRemove medium from the culture insert with a p1000 pipette.\nCritical: Avoid keeping the pipette too close to the gel inside the insert because you may aspirate the gel\nAdd 30 μL cell suspension (from step 35) in the center of the gel, in the concave area of the shrunken gel.\nAdd organoid culture medium at the bottom of the well in the deepwell plate until it reaches the bottom of the culture insert (∼9 mL).\nIncubate at 37°C for 20 min to let the cells adhere.\nAdd 2 mL organoid culture medium on top of the adhered cells carefully and place in the incubator. Do not spray as the keratinocytes will then detach.\nIncubate for 4 days before lifting the gels.\nAir-liquid interface lifting of the keratinocytes\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes how to perform air-liquid interface lifting of the 3D organoid culture.\nOn day 4 after seeding the keratinocytes, aspirate medium from the culture insert and from the plate wells carefully.\nPlace the insert into a sterile 100 mm dish using sterile forceps.",
    "Add two sterile airlift pads to the base of each well in the deepwell plate and place back the insert into the well over the pads.\nAdd approximately 9 mL organoid culture medium in the deep wells until the pads are completely wet.\nNote: Level of the medium should cover the pads and not be higher.\nAlternatives: For experiments using the sialyltransferase inhibitor Ac5SiaFEtoc, culture medium is supplemented with 1 mM Ac5SiaFEtoc when the inserts were raised to the air-liquid interface. Concentration of the inhibitor is replenished with subsequent medium changes.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in humidified incubator and change media in the deep wells every other day. Gels are ready to harvest in 10 days. The models are stable for 3 weeks.\nProcessing of skin organoids for histology\nTiming: 2 days (can be faster if you embed manually)\nThis step describes how we harvest and process the organotypic skin cultures for histology.\nFor PFA fixation:\nCollect the insert with forceps and cut the bottom of the insert with a scalpel.\nCritical: Careful of breaking the gel or damaging the epidermis at this step\nPlace the skin organoid in an embedding cassette\nClose the cassette tightly and dip it in 4% PFA. Incubate for 18 h.\nEmbed the organotypic cultures in paraffin like normal tissue for histology\nSections are cut in 3–5 μm thickness and put onto slides ready for staining\nSections can be stained with hematoxyline-eosine for phenotypic visualization or used for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence\nFor frozen sections:\nCut the insert like above\nEmbed OCT in tissue tech and freeze in hexapentane cooled on dry ice.\nKeep in −80°C freezer until cutting sections on cryomicrotome.\nSections can be stained with hematoxyline-eosine for phenotypic visualization or used for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence"
