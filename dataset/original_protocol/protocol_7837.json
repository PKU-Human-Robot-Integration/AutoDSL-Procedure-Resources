    "Adherent tumor cell preparationSeed adherent tumor cells into IBIDI channels by adding 60 μl of tumor cell suspension in LC medium. Micro-slides VI, ibiTreat characteristics are the following:Number of channels: 6Minimal volume per channel: 30 μlChannel length: 17 mmChannel width: 3.8 mmChannel height: 0.4 mmGrowth area: 0.6 cm2 per channelTumor cell concentration may vary according to the cell type (for instance: 1.6 x 106 cells/ml for NSCLC cell lines described in Reference 1). Cells should be at 90-95% of confluence the day of experiment.Incubate the IBIDI slide in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for at least 2 h for cell attachment.Fill gently the reservoirs with another 60 μl of LC medium. Avoid pipetting directly into the channels not to detach the cells.Incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Note: In case of tumor cell treatment (example siRNA transfection), cells should be plated two days before using the same experimental conditions. Medium may need to be changed every 24 h. Be sure that the cells are all alive and just reaching 90-95% confluence the day of experiment.T-cell preparationWash T cells with PBS 1x by centrifugation at 350 x g for 5 min.Stain cells with CellTracker Green (CMFDA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, resuspend cells at 2 x 106/ml in PBS and add one volume of CellTracker Green (CMFDA 2x) diluted in PBS (final concentration 1 μM). Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.Wash T cells twice with RPMI-based complete medium by centrifugation at 350 x g, 5 min. Resuspend T cells in T-cell medium, at final concentration 2 x 106 cells/ml, in 24 flat bottom well plates.Incubate T cells overnight in humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "T-cell adhesion strength under flow conditionsThe following day, warm the thermostatic chamber of the microscope at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (Figure 1A).Equilibrate RPMI-based complete medium (500 ml) inside the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Prepare syringe pump (Figure 1B).Connect the tube carrying a plastic clip (position closed) to the syringe and fill the syringe with prewarmed medium. Put the Elbow Luer connector and prime the tube (Figure 1A).Put the IBIDI slide (Figure 1C) under the microscope objective (20x) (Figure 1D). Be sure that the reservoirs are completely full. If not, add some medium.Connect the tube to one extremity of the IBIDI channel making sure there are no air bubbles remaining inside. This step is critical, because bubbles increase the risk of tumor cell detachment, influence the flow rate and can even stop the flow.             imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131020/20131020234338_3380.jpgimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131020/20131020232004_8507.jpgFigure 1. Flow system. A. Whole flow system; B. Pump system; C. Details of Micro-Slides IBIDI connections; D. During acquisition, the slide is fixed under the microscope and connected to the pump system. Use the second tube to connect the opposite extremity of the channel with a bottle collecting wastes (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131017/20131017002054_2321.jpgRed: adherent tumor cell layerGreen: T cellsBlue: LC mediumWhite arrow: direction of the flowFigure 2. T-cell adhesion under flow conditions. Stained T lymphocytes were incubated for 15 min on a monolayer of autologous tumor cells previously seeded into IBIDI channels. The IBIDI slide is then connected by silicon tubes, in one side to a pump (with a syringe filled with prewarmed medium) and in the other side to the waste recipient.Release the clip on the tube connecting the syringe to the IBIDI slide (Figure 1A).Note: Test the system to validate the maximal flow rate that doesn’t detach tumor cells.",
    "This rate will be applied to determine the T-cell adhesion strength on tumor cells.Wash T cells with RPMI by centrifugation at 350 x g for 5 min.Resuspend T cells in RPMI medium at final concentration 2 x 106 cells/ml.Replace the medium filling the channels with 50 μl of T cells suspension. Be careful to not detach tumor cells or introduce bubbles inside channels.Incubate 15 min at 37 °C.After incubation, prepare the flow system using the same conditions described for the test assay.Add 50 ml pre-warmed medium inside the syringe.Start the acquisition just before the flow (Figure 1D).Acquire images every 2 s for 60 s. It is expected that T cells adhere more firmly to tumor cells that express adherence molecules (such as ligands for integrins expressed by T cells) than tumor cells that do not express these molecules.
