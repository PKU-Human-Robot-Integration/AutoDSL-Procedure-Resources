    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1: Jelly-dosing training\nTiming: 4 days, 1–2 h for 1st day, 10–20 min per day for following 3 days\nSince mice exert innate avoidance to novel food (Kronenberger and Medioni, 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), a training period is necessary for mice to overcome neophobia and eat the jelly. The training involves fasting the singly housed mouse overnight followed by vehicle jelly (that does not contain a drug) presentation and 3-day follow-up jelly presentation without food restriction at the same time of the day.\nMake the vehicle jelly\nFast singly housed mice over night\nNote: We typically remove the food from hopper at 5 pm.\nNext morning between 8:30 to 9:00 am, scoop out vehicle jelly from the well with micro spatula and cut into equal 8 pieces (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nOpen mouse cage lid and place 1 piece of jelly on the cage floor or a small disposable weighing tray (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), then put the lid back on. Wait till the mouse finishes the jelly then refeed the mouse.\nCritical: Leave the mouse as un-disturbed as possible.\nNote: Typically it takes about 15–30 min for the mice to eat the jelly for the first time. See suggestions under Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for mice that have difficulties in overcoming neophobia or accepting the jelly.\nGive 1 piece of vehicle jelly to each mouse in the morning of the following 3 days without fasting them the night before.\nNote: If the drug will be given at a particular time of the day rather than in the morning, place the piece of vehicle jelly on the cage floor at that time instead of the morning. If the drug will be given multiple times of the day, give the piece of vehicle jelly to mice at those times.",
    "Pause Point: In our experience, once being trained, mice maintain the interest to the jelly even after jelly has been absent for a few weeks (3 weeks are the longest break occurred in current studies).\nStep 2: Option 1: drug treatment study\nTiming: few minutes per treatment, duration depends on study requirement\nGive mice oral drug treatment according to study protocol.\nMake vehicle and drug jellies.\nGive 1/8th of vehicle or drug jelly to mice in the control or treatment group, respectively.\nNote: The timing, frequency, and length of treatment depend on the study protocol. For each treatment, it may take 10–20 min depending on the number of mice under study. For 12 mice for example, it typically takes about 10 min per treatment.\nStep 2: Option 2: oral glucose tolerance test\nTiming: 10–20 min for glucose jelly dosing depending on number of mice under test + oral glucose tolerance test duration\nMake glucose jelly the day before the test day.\nOn the day of oral glucose test day, calculate the amount of glucose jelly each mouse needs to receive based on its body weight.\nWeigh out the amount of glucose jelly required for each mouse and give it to the mouse.\nCritical: The 0 time point in the oral glucose tolerance test is when the mouse finishes the entire piece of glucose jelly in a single attempt that takes about 1 min after jelly presentation."
