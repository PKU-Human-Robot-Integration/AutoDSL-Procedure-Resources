    "1. Cell Culture\nObtain the cells to induce tetraploidy. To date it has been confirmed that this technique can be applied to the human fibroblast cell lines TIG-1, BJ, IMR-90 and telomerase-immortalized TIG-1 (TIG-hT).\nGrow cells in minimum essential medium with α modification or any other cell culture medium suited for the cell type to be studied supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) by incubating in a 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Passage cells every 3 or 4 days not to exceed subconfluent density.\n\tNOTE: Population doubling level (PDL) should be calculated each time at passaging to evaluate cell growth and cell age. PDL can be calculated from the cell number seeded into a dish (N1) and the cell number harvested at the next passaging (N2) using the following formula (X is the initial PDL). PDL = X + (log N1 - log N2) / log 2\n2. Induction and Establishment of Tetraploid Cells from Diploid Fibroblasts\nInduce tetraploidy without shake-off.\n\tNOTE: Some cell strains (e.g. TIG-1) can become almost completely tetraploid by continuous treatment with demecolcine (DC) as follows.\n\t\nPassage cells into one or two 100 mm dishes on the day before treatment to induce tetraploidy. Usually, prepare 5 x 105 to 1 x 106 cells per dish for induction of tetraploid cells.\nTreat exponentially growing cells with medium containing 0.1 µg/mL DC for 4 days.\nReplace DC-containing medium with drug-free medium and incubate cells in a 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells usually resume proliferation within 1 week.\nInduce tetraploidy with shake-off.",
    "NOTE: Most cells become a mixture of diploid and tetraploid populations as a result of the simple treatment with DC described above (2.1). Therefore, some modifications of the procedure to eliminate a diploid population are necessary as follows (Figure 1).\n\t\nPassage cells into several T75 flasks the day before treatment to induce tetraploidy. Usually, prepare at least 5 x 106 cells (1 x 106 cells per flask) for induction of tetraploid cells.\nTreat exponentially growing cells with medium containing 0.1 µg/mL DC for 16 - 18 h to arrest cells in mitosis. The time required to arrest cells in mitosis may depend on target cells and should be determined by preliminary experiments to obtain as many mitotic cells as possible. For example, slower growing cells should be treated with DC for longer time than faster growing cells.\n\t\tNOTE: If cells are treated for too long in this step, they might undergo mitotic slippage and adhere to the dish surface, making it impossible to collect mitotic cells by shake-off in the next step.\nCollect DC-arrested mitotic cells by the shake-off method, in which loosely adhered mitotic cells are collected by gentle shaking of flasks and washing with medium followed by centrifugation (300 x g, 5 min). Count cell number by an appropriate method in this step.\nReseed collected mitotic cells into 60 mm culture dishes and treat cells with 0.1 µg/mL DC for an additional 3 days. Seed more than 1 x 106 mitotic cells per dish, because less than 10% of cells can survive this treatment.\nReplace DC-containing medium with drug-free medium and wait for cells to resume proliferation, which usually occurs within 1 week.\nPassage cells similarly to original diploid cells.\n3. Examination of DNA Ploidy",
    "NOTE: This is a well-established procedure and a technical manual should be referred to for detailed procedures and technical tips.\nHarvest cells (5 x 105 - 1 x 106) by incubating cells with a solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, and neutralize trypsin by medium containing 10% FBS.\nCentrifuge cells in medium and wash them by resuspending in 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by centrifugation (300 x g, 5 min).\nPrepare cells for DNA analysis by one of the following two methods\n\t\nA method for analyzing unfixed cells10\n\t\tNOTE: This method can be performed using a commercially available kit for cell cycle analysis. Samples prepared with this method should be analyzed immediately, because cells are not fixed in the procedure and stained nuclei will become damaged over time.\n\t\t\nWash cells with 40 mM citrate buffer containing 250 mM sucrose. Subsequently treat cells with 250 µL of 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P40 and 30 µg/mL trypsin in 200 µL of 40 mM citrate buffer containing 250 mM sucrose for 10 min at room temperature.\nAdd 200 µL of 0.5 µg/mL trypsin inhibitor and 0.1 µg/mL RNase A in 40 mM citrate buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, and incubate cells for 10 min at room temperature.\nAdd 200 µL of 0.4 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI) in 40mM citrate buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, and incubate cells for 10 min at room temperature to stain cell nuclei.\nA method for analyzing fixed cells\n\t\t\nFix cells with 80% ethanol by suspending cells in 1 mL of PBS, adding 4 mL of 100% EtOH dropwise while mixing the cell suspension and leaving it at room temperature for 30 min. Cells in this fixative can be stored at -20 °C for several weeks.",
    "Wash cells by resuspending them in 5 mL of PBS followed by centrifugation (300 x g, 5 min). Treat cells with 0.5 mg/mL RNase A and stain them with 50 µg/mL propidium iodide (PI) (475 µL of 0.5 mg/mL RNase A and 25 µL of 1 mg/mL PI) for 30 min at room temperature.\nAnalyze DNA content of the cells using a flow cytometer with a 488 nm laser and red channel emission filter (long pass > 610 nm). Analyze a reference sample prepared from genuine diploid cells at the same time to assess ploidy of the target cells.\n\t\nAlternatively, add fluorescence standard beads to assess the fluorescence intensity ratio of diploid cells vs. the beads. Use the 'pulse height vs. pulse width' option of the flow cytometer to discriminate between single tetraploid cells and clumps of diploid cells11.\n4. Examination of Chromosome Counts and Karyotype Analysis\nNOTE: These are all well-established procedures and a technical manual or the manufacturer's protocols should be referred to for detailed procedures and technical tips.\nTreat exponentially growing cells with 0.1 µg/mL DC for 4 h to arrest cells in metaphase.\nPrepare chromosome slides.\n\t\nHarvest cells (at least 5 x 105 cells) by trypsinization and suspend in medium containing FBS.\nCentrifuge cells in medium (300 x g, 5 min) and treat with hypotonic solution (5 mL of 0.075 M KCl) at 37 °C for 10 min.\nFix and suspend cells in Carnoy's fixative (methanol:acetic acid = 3:1).\nSpread cells onto a glass slide by dropping a small volume (25 - 35 µL) of cell suspension. Additional steps such as exposure to hot steam might be necessary to improve chromosome spreading.\nStain cells for chromosome counts or karyotype analysis or multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH).\n\t\nChromosome counts.",
    "Stain cells with 5% Giemsa solution (or 5 µg/mL PI containing 0.5 mg/mL RNase A for fluorescence microscopy) for 15 - 20 min.\nDigitally photograph at least 50 metaphase cells.\nCount chromosome number per cell using an image analysis software after manual separation of touching and overlapping chromosomes using a photo editing software. Although chromosome number can be scored manually, computerized scoring is recommended.\nKaryotype analysis\n\t\tNOTE: This analysis should be performed by a trained technician or a professional company.\n\t\t\nStain cells according to a standard G-banding technique12.\nAnalyze chromosomes to make standard karyograms12.\nmFISH\n\t\tNOTE: This step is optional and should be performed if necessary.\n\t\t\nStain cells using multicolor FISH probes for human chromosomes according to the manufacturer's protocol13.\nAnalyze chromosomes using a fluorescence microscope with suitable filters and a software for mFISH analysis13.\nSubscription Required.
