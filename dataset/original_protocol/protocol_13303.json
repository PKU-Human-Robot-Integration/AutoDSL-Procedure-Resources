    "All experiments were conducted after KU Leuven animal care committee approval and in line with European guidelines.\n1. Animal information\nNOTE: Male TOPIGS TN70 pigs, aged 3 months, with a body weight of approximately 30 kg and liver weight of 600-700 g are used for this study protocol.\nKeep the animals under a 12 h day/night rhythm in single pens with free access to food and tap water and visual, olfactory, and auditory contact between them.\nEnsure that the animals arrive at least 2 days prior to the surgery to get accustomed to their surroundings. Fast the pigs for 12 h prior to surgery with free access to water.\n\t​NOTE: Anesthesia is maintained with isoflurane and analgesia with fentanyl. Throughout anesthesia, the electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, capnography, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. The experiments are terminal; pigs are euthanized by exsanguination while procuring the liver under continued general anesthesia and analgesia.\n2. Preparation of the perfusion setup\nInstallation of the disposable perfusion kit\n\t\nFixate the reservoir at a fixed height approximately 15 cm higher than the liver receptacle.\nConnect the pump head to the designated slot on the centrifugal pump. Connect the oxygen tube to the oxygenator. Connect the in- and outflow tubes of the heater/cooler to the designated slots on the oxygenator.\nInstall one pinch valve on the outflow tube under the reservoir. Install the second pinch valve on the inflow tube to the reservoir after the Y-connection, where the other tube will feed the hepatic artery.\n\t\tNOTE: The first pinch valve will control the inflow into the portal vein. Closing the second pinch valve will increase the flow, and therefore also the pressure in the hepatic artery.",
    "Install the flow sensor distal from the first pinch valve on the reservoir outflow tube. Install the second flow sensor on the inflow tube to the pump head.\n\t\tNOTE: The first flow sensor will measure the flow into the portal vein. The second flow sensor will measure the outflow from the vena cava.\nCut the outflow tube from the oxygenator and insert the arterial filter in the correct direction.\n\t\tNOTE: Cut the tube to no longer than 2 cm after the oxygenator; if it is left too long, it will kink when the tubing becomes softer when it is perfused with a 37 °C perfusate. If it still kinks, support the arterial filter by tying it to the support of the reservoir.\nInstallation of the leakage recirculation tube\n\t\nThe perfusion kit contains two tubes with one 3/16 end and one 1/16 end. Connect the two tubes to each other by inserting the 1/16 end into the 3/16 end. Connect the 3/16 end to the reservoir.\nInstall the tube in the roller pump, considering the rotation direction. Set up the correct tubing diameter and set the speed to 15-18 rotations per minute (rpm). Place the 1/16 end into the liver receptacle and fixate if necessary.\nContinuous in-line blood gas analysis calibration\n\t\nSwitch on the gas analyzer and select Calibrate.\nCheck the correct serial number on the sensor package and press OK.\nTake the arterial sensor holder out of the cassette and connect the sensor to it with a blue cap on top and a white filter on the bottom.\nUnscrew and remove the white cap under the filter; do not unscrew the filter itself. Loosen the blue venting cap on top, do not remove it. Firmly insert the sensor and sensor holder into the calibration cassette.",
    "Start calibration. When calibration is finished, remove the sensor and sensor holder from the calibration cassette. Remove the white filter on the bottom and tighten the blue venting cap on top.\nInsert the sensor in the sampling line of the perfusion kit. Do not start gas analysis until the perfusion circuit is primed.\nPriming of the circuit\n\t\nInsert an infusion line into a 500 mL bag of plasma expander and attach it to the reservoir. Place a tube clamp on the reservoir outflow line and fill the reservoir with 300 mL of plasma expander.\nRemove the tube clamp and let the plasma expander fill the circuit\nDe-air the pump head and oxygenator. The circuit is now primed. Switch on the heater/cooler and set it to 38 °C\nPreparation of the infusion lines\n\t\nDraw 5 mL (25.000 U) of a 5 U/mL heparin solution into a 50 mL syringe. Draw an additional 25 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution to obtain a total volume of 30 mL of heparin solution (infusion rate: 1 mL/h).\nDissolve 5 g of sodium taurocholate in 50 mL of 0.9% NaCl and draw it into 450 mL of 0.9% NaCl to reach a 1% concentration. A total volume of 168 mL is needed (infusion rate: 7 mL/h).\nDraw 2 mL (200 U) of a 100 U/mL insulin solution into a 50 mL syringe. Draw an additional 28 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution to obtain a total volume of 30 mL of insulin solution (infusion rate: 1 mL/h).",
    "Draw 10 mL of glycine buffer (diluent) and add it to the 0.5 mg vial of epoprostenol. Using the microbial filter provided in the epoprostenol kit, draw 5 mL out of the vial containing the epoprostenol reconstituted with glycine buffer in a 50 mL syringe. Draw an additional 25 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution to obtain a total volume of 30 mL of epoprostenol solution (infusion rate: 1 mL/h).\n3. Induction of anesthesia\nSedation\n\t\nPrepare a syringe with 2 mg/kg xylazine and 8 mg/kg Zoletil (4 mg/kg tiletamine and 4 mg/kg zolazepam), a syringe with 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl, a three-way valve, an extension line, and an intramuscular 21 G needle.\nPlace the needle into the gluteal muscle, inject the xylazine and tiletamine mixture, and flush the extension line with the 0.9% NaCl. After 15 min, the pig is sedated.\nWeigh the pig and transport it to the operating room.\nAnesthesia\n\t\nTurn on the ventilator\nPlace the pig in a supine position on the operating table and fixate the extremities.\nPre-oxygenate with a ventilation mask with 1.5 L of O2, 1.5 L of air, and 1% isoflurane.\nAttach a saturation probe to the tail or ear. Connect the three electrocardiogram leads for continuous monitoring.\nInsert a 22 G catheter in an ear vein, connect to a three-way valve, and start a drip of intravenous (IV) fluids (Plasmalyte) at a rate of 400 mL/h.\nPlace a 60 mL syringe with 50 µg/mL fentanyl into an automatic syringe driver. Give a bolus of 1 mL and start a continuous infusion at a rate of 0.16 mL/kg/h.\nRemove the ventilation mask and insert the laryngoscope, lifting the epiglottis. Insert an endotracheal tube into the trachea and inflate the balloon to prevent air leakage. Fixate the tube with tape to the pig's snout.",
    "NOTE: Close off the isoflurane when removing the ventilation mask.\nConnect the endotracheal tube to the ventilator.\n\t\tNOTE: Ventilator settings: 0.4 L tidal volume; 0.5 kPa mean airway pressure; 2.5 kPa airway pressure; 0.5 kPa positive end expiratory pressure; 15/min frequency; 4.7-5.3 kPa end-tidal CO2.\nConnect the capnograph to the endotracheal tube.\n4. Surgery\nDeep venous catheter and arterial line\n\t\nDisinfect the surgical field with betadine and place drapes on both sides of the midline.\nMake a 7 cm long incision from the left side of the top of the sternum laterally to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and place an orthostatic retractor.\nDissect the subcutaneous tissue off the muscle in the lateral direction and identify the external jugular vein. Dissect free the vein, ligating side branches if present.\nPlace two 2/0 ligatures around the external jugular vein and tie off the cranial ligature.\nCut open the vein caudal from the tied ligature and insert a 12 French venous catheter.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the venous catheter is flushed with heparinized saline prior to insertion.\nFixate the catheter with the second ligature. If the venous catheter in the ear vein is fragile or too small, switch the IV fluid and fentanyl lines to the deep venous catheter. Otherwise, do not use it until blood collection to the cell saver.\nDissect free the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and replace the orthostatic retractor opening the plane between the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the lateral side and the trachea on the medial side.\nRemove the thymus to expose the carotid artery. Repeat step 4.1.4 for the artery.\nInsert the arterial line in the carotid artery in a caudal direction and fixate. Connect the arterial line to the line from the pressure monitor.\nDissection of the aorta and vena cava",
    "Perform a midline laparotomy from the xiphoid to the pubic bone.\n\t\tNOTE: In male pigs, caudal from the penis, incise 1 cm lateral from the midline to avoid damaging the subcutaneous urethra.\nTransect the umbilical ligament. Place an abdominal retractor. Pull the intestines left laterally and cranially to visualize the aorta and vena cava.\n\t\tNOTE: Porcine intestine is non-rotated; therefore, no colon mobilization is necessary to gain access to the retroperitoneum.\nDissect free approximately 3 cm of the aorta just cranial of the iliac bifurcation and place two ligatures around the aorta.\n\t\tNOTE: There is a large lymphatic vessel near the aorta; be careful not to damage it as this will blur the surgical field and complicate dissection.\nDissect free the vena cava at the same level as the aorta and place two ligatures.\nGastroduodenal ligament dissection\n\t\nStart the dissection at the lateral side of the gastroduodenal ligament, dissect free the common bile duct, and encircle with a vessel loop.\nRetract the bile duct to the medial side, exposing the portal vein. Remove a large lymph node on the lateral side of the portal vein\nFree up the portal vein toward the pancreas; there is often a branch from the stomach and pancreas that need to be ligated and transected. Encircle the portal vein with a vessel loop on the side of the liver and a ligature on the side of the pancreas. Retract the portal vein laterally, making sure not to close it off.\nIdentify the common hepatic artery and encircle it with a vessel loop.\nThoracic aorta dissection\n\t\nPull the liver caudal and open the central tendinous part of the diaphragm ventrally from the suprahepatic vena cava. Retract the esophagus to the right side, exposing the thoracic aorta.",
    "Dissect free from the surrounding tissue and be careful not to damage the azygos vein.\n\t\tNOTE: It is not necessary to encircle the thoracic aorta; dissection should be extended sufficiently to place a vascular clamp.\nPreparation of the cell saver\n\t\nHang the reservoir in the black ring, remove the cap from the single leg of the adapter, and attach the tube to the 3/8 inch outlet port on the bottom of the blood collection reservoir.\nUncap the suction/anticoagulant tube and connect it to one of the 1/4 inch blood inlet ports on the top edge of the blood collection reservoir.\nInsert the bowl of the wash kit by turning; make sure a click is heard.\nPlace the tube in the roller pump and the tube divider.\nHang a citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA)-1 blood collection bag on the pole, and make sure the connection is tight.\n\t\tNOTE: CPDA-1 blood bag composition (63 mL): 2.99 g/L anhydrous citric acid; 26.3 g/L dyhidrous sodium citrate; 2.22 g/L monohysrate sodium phosphate; 31.9 g/L dextrose monohydrate; 0.275 g/L adenine.\nHang the waste bag on the side of the machine (make sure it is closed properly) and connect it to the wash kit (yellow cap).\nConnect both Y-shaped tubes (white caps) to a bag of 3 L of 0.9% NaCl.\nAttach the tube with the blue cap to the adapter tube on the bottom of the blood collection reservoir. Switch on the autotransfusion system.\nCannulation of the aorta and vena cava\n\t\nAdminister 500 IU/kg heparin and allow it to circulate for 2 min. Tie the caudal ligature around the aorta and insert a 20 French cannula in the aorta and fixate. The same procedure is repeated for the vena cava.",
    "To mimic a DCD procedure, warm ischemia is induced by clamping the thoracic aorta for a period of time, in this case 60 min.\n\tNOTE: During warm ischemia, the caval and jugular drainage are opened, and blood collection to the cell saver is commenced. This results in exsanguination of the pig.\nFlushing the liver\n\t\nAt the end of warm ischemia, initiate a cold flush with 2 L of ice-cold (4-6 °C) preservation solution through the aortic cannula, and cool the abdomen with a topical application of slush ice.\n\t\tNOTE: During the cold flush, all remaining blood is flushed out and collected to the cell saver.\nWhen the first 2 L is flushed, remove the cannula from the aorta, tie the ligature on the portal vein, and cannulate the portal vein. Then, fixate it with the vessel loop.\nFlush the liver via the portal vein with another 2 L of ice cold (4-6°C) preservation solution.\nHepatectomy\n\t\nRemove the ice from the abdomen. Transect the bile duct close to the pancreas.\nRemove the portal cannula and divide the portal vein. Retract the intestines to the left to expose the infrahepatic vena cava.\nDissect the vena cava free from the retroperitoneum and divide just cranial from the renal veins. Dissect the common hepatic artery up to the celiac artery and origin from the aorta.\n\t\tNOTE: Cutting the right diaphragmatic crus can improve exposure.\nDivide the gastroduodenal artery and cut out the celiac artery with a patch of the aorta. Transect the lesser omentum close to the stomach cranially up to the esophagus\nMobilize the left liver by cutting the left triangular ligament. Cut the diaphragm on the left side of the vena cava.",
    "Mobilize the right liver by cutting down the right diaphragm from ventral to dorsal, ending just caudally from the infrahepatic vena cava transection.\nCut the suprahepatic vena cava and cut any remaining attachments. The liver is now free; remove it and place it in a bowl with ice water.\nBack-table procedure\n\t\nWeigh the liver. Cannulate the portal vein with a 25 French cannula and secure with ligatures. Cannulate the hepatic artery with a 14 French reinforced cannula and fixate with ligatures.\nCannulate the infrahepatic vena cava and position the tip of the cannula at the level where the hepatic veins drain in the vena cava. Fixate with ligatures.\nPut a purse string around the edge of the diaphragm to prevent bleeding from any diaphragmatic veins and tie off the suprahepatic vena cava.\nDe-air the portal cannula and perform a back-table flush of the portal vein with 250 mL of cold plasma expander. Check for any leaks.\n\t\tNOTE: Check for adequate outflow through the caval cannula.\nAfter the portal flush, place a tube clamp on the portal cannula, ensuring no air enters the cannula and portal vein.\nDe-air the arterial cannula and flush 250 mL of cold plasma expander through the hepatic artery. Check for any leaks and clip any side branches. Place a tube clamp on the arterial and caval cannula.\n5. Normothermic machine perfusion\nPerfusate\n\t\nDuring the back-table preparation, add the cell saver-produced, washed red blood cells to the circuit to obtain the desired hematocrit of 30%. Start the pump to mix the red blood cells with the plasma expander. Start the continuous gas analyzer.",
    "NOTE: The formula for red blood cell volume to obtain desired hematocrit: (liver weight + priming volume) x desired hematocrit/hematocrit after washing. The continuous gas analyzer also provides feedback on the perfusion temperature, which normally matches the setting of the heater at 38 °C.\nAdd 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate, 2 mL of heparin (10.000 IU), and 750 mg of cefuroxime in 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl to the perfusate. Set the manual gas blender to 0.5 L/min FiO2 of 21%.\nInitiation of perfusion\n\t\nSwitch on the pressure sensors, flow sensors, and roller pump for leakage recirculation.\nPlace the liver in the receptacle. Place the tube clamps on the portal and arterial inflow tube and caval outflow tube of the circuit, and cut out the Y-connector.\nConnect the cannulas to their respective in- and outflow tubes with a T-connection piece in between. Prevent air from entering the circuit.\nInstall three-way taps on the T-connection pieces and connect pressure lines to them. Zero pressure the lines and start continuous pressure monitoring.\nSet the pinch valves, almost closing them completely, to prevent supraphysiological flows and endothelial stress.\nStart perfusion by removing the tube clamps from the portal inflow. Immediately after the portal inflow has started, remove the clamps from the caval outflow and start the pump. The pump speed is pressure controlled, so aim for a pressure in the caval outflow between -5 mmHg and -2 mmHg. Aim for a portal flow of 0.75 mL/min/g liver.\nWhen portal perfusion is stable and caval pressures are adequate, remove the clamps from the arterial tube. Aim for pressures around 55-60 mmHg and flows around 0.25 mL/min/g liver.\nMaintaining stable perfusion hemodynamics\n\t\nCover the liver with a glass dome or plastic wrap to prevent heat loss from the surface.",
    "If the portal flow is too high, close the pinch valve on the portal inflow tube.\nIf caval pressure becomes too negative, the risk of creating a vacuum inside the vena cava increases. Excessive negative pressures can be countered by slowing down the pump speed. Alternatively, increasing inflow through the portal vein reduces the negative outflow pressure by providing more volume to the vena cava.\nIf arterial pressure is too low, it can be increased by increasing the pump speed or by closing the pinch valve toward the portal reservoir to push more flow through the arterial inflow tube.\nSampling\n\t\nObtain the perfusate samples from the caval outflow three-way valve or a designated sampling line between the oxygenator and the portal reservoir.\nObtain needle biopsies throughout perfusion. Needle holes must be sutured as there is no coagulation due to the heparinization of the circuit.\nCollect bile by fixating an 8 French cannula in the bile duct. Make sure to ligate the cystic duct.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
