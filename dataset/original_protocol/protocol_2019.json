    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Preparation of crypt organoid culture\nTiming: 3 h\nThis protocol will allow you to establish crypt organoids from the murine small intestine. The resultant crypt suspension is mixed with Matrigel, and domes are deposited in a 24-well culture plate. After adding ENR (EGF, Noggin and R-Spondin) media, crypts develop into organoids, which contain de novo crypts and villus-like structures, recapitulating the in vivo intestine structure. For further information on the use and characterization of organoids, please refer to the previously published work (Sato et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Mahe et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Sato and Clevers, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nPart 1A: Isolation of intestinal crypts\nCritical: To ensure minimal damage to the crypts, keep PBS 1×, Gut buffer, Chelating buffer and Crypt dissociation buffer on ice during the entire procedure. Have all the tools and reagents ready before sacrificing the mouse and perform the isolation on ice.\nEuthanize mice using an authorized, legal method, approved by the institution where the research is conducted.\nSterilize the abdomen with 70% Ethanol.\nMake an incision into the abdominal cavity from the external genitalia to the rib cage by cutting abdominal musculature on both sides.\nLift the liver and cut the intestine from the stomach at the pyloric sphincter.\nCut across the large intestine just prior to the anus to release the whole gut.\nCut the mesenteric attachment of the intestine if necessary and gently pull the gut out of the abdominal cavity (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]A).\nPlace the gut in a petri dish filled with the ice-cold gut buffer.\nTear the mesentery to unfold the gut (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]A).\nSeparate the small intestine from the colon by cutting the gut at the ileocecal junction (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]A).",
    "Flush the intestine of fecal content with the ice-cold gut buffer (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]B) using a 1 mL syringe mounted with a 1,000 μL tip. If necessary, use forceps to gently push the feces out of the gut.\nCut the intestine into 3 equal pieces (roughly corresponding to the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum).\nCut open each segment longitudinally so that the inside of the intestine is facing up.\nUse a slide to gently scrape out the villi (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Discard the part of the intestinal lumen that remains on the slide.\nCritical: To avoid crypt loss, scrape the intestine gently.\nPlace the intestinal segments in a conical 50 mL tube filled with the 20 mL gut buffer and invert gently the tube 3 times. Discard the supernatant.\nRecover the intestinal segments with forceps and cut them into 0.5 cm pieces. Transfer the pieces to a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of ice-cold chelating buffer.\nShake the tube using either an orbital shaker or a rocking plate at 4°C (fridge or cold-room) for 25 min at 20 rpm.\nGently invert the tube and filter the solution through a 100 μm strainer into a 50 mL conical tube to separate the tissue pieces from the solution containing cellular debris.\nNote: We recommend keeping this solution until the end of the experiment. If the crypt isolation is successful, discard it. If the crypt isolation is not effective, check if the crypts have been lost in this suspension (see the “troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” section).\nUse forceps to transfer the intestine pieces into a 50 mL conical tube containing the 25 mL ice-cold crypt dissociation buffer.",
    "Orient the tube at 45° to the ground and shake it for 4–6 min with a gentle and regular motion (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). Every 2 min, place the tube on ice to rest for 30 s.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1614-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Scale bar, 50 μm.\nNote: Pipet 50 μL of the solution and check under the microscope for crypt enrichment. If necessary, shake the tube for 2 extra minutes, and check again (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nPlace the tube on ice and allow the fragments settle down.\nFilter the solution through a 70 μm filter into a 50 mL conical tube on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: This step will remove villi and enrich for crypts.\nAdd 10 mL of the crypt dissociation buffer to wash the strainer. Discard the strainer.\nCentrifuge the crypt-containing solution at 150 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant (single cells) and resuspend the pellet (crypts) in 10 mL of ice-cold PBS 1× (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCount the number of crypts in 10 μL. The total number of crypts in the tube correspond to the number of crypts in 10 μL × 1,000.\nTransfer the volume required for 300 crypts/well to a new 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: For a full 24-well plate: 300 crypts × 24 wells = 7,200 crypts.\nNote: If the number of crypts in 10 μL is too high and difficult to count, further dilute the crypt suspension by adding an extra 10 mL of ice-cold PBS 1X.\nCentrifuge the required number of crypts at 150 g for 10 min at 4°C.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",

Pipette the Matrigel slowly to avoid introducing bubbles.\nGently resuspend crypt pellets in the required volume of 70% Matrigel until the clumps become fully dissociated.\nRemove the 24-well plate from the incubator. Place a 50 μL drop gently in the center of each well.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 15 min to allow Matrigel polymerization.\nAdd 350 μL of pre-warmed ENR media per well.\nCulture the organoids 37°C, 5% CO2. Replace the media with fresh pre-warmed ENR media every 4 days (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1614-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "The current protocol describes the isolation of enteric glial cells from the submucosa by combining EDTA chelation with non-enzymatic dissociation. As submucosal and myenteric EGCs share the same markers, the physical separation of the epithelial mucosa from the smooth muscle was utilized to specifically isolate mucosal EGCs. Although the initial cell suspension consists of 50% mucosal EGCs and 50% other stromal cells, after 3 days in culture, EGCs represent 95% of the cells in culture. This is achieved by culture conditions favorable to EGC growth, which include EGC-friendly substrates (PDL and laminin) and GDNF supplementation (Wang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Baghdadi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nEuthanize mice using an authorized, legal method approved by the institution where the research is conducted.\nSterilize the abdomen with 70% Ethanol.\nMake an incision into the abdominal cavity from the external genitalia to the rib cage by cutting abdominal musculature on both sides.\nLift the liver and cut the intestine from the stomach at the pyloric sphincter.\nCut across the large intestine just prior to the anus to release the whole gut.\nCut the mesenteric attachment of the intestine if necessary and gently pull the gut out of the abdominal cavity (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]A).\nPlace the gut in a petri dish filled with the ice-cold gut buffer.\nTear the mesentery to unfold the gut (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]A).\nNote: Make sure to remove any residual mesentery from the tissue.\nSeparate the small intestine from the colon by cutting the gut at the ileocecal junction (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]A).\nFlush fecal content from the intestine with the ice-cold gut buffer (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]B) using a 1 mL syringe mounted with a 1,000 μL tip.\nCut the intestine into 3 pieces (the duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and remove the longitudinal muscle.",
    "Separate the wooden stick from the cotton tip of a cotton swab. Soak the wooden part of the cotton swab in the cold gut buffer (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nSlowly thread one intestinal segment onto the pre-wetted wooden stick (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nUse a scalpel or razor blade to make vertical incisions along the intestine and tease away the longitudinal muscle by applying gentle horizontal strokes using the pre-wetted cotton swab (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nSustain this motion until the longitudinal muscle peels away from the intestine. Discard the longitudinal muscle (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nNote: Removing the muscle layer will discard EGCs from the myenteric plexus and avoid their contamination of the mucosal EGC culture.\nCritical: Incisions should not be too deep to prevent intestinal opening.\nCut open the intestinal segment using the forceps/razor blade to release it from the cotton swab (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nKeep the intestinal tissue in a 50 mL conical tube filled with the 20 mL gut buffer on ice. Repeat steps 40–43 with the two other intestinal segments.\nRecover the intestinal segments with forceps and cut them into 0.5 cm pieces.\nTransfer the pieces to a 50 mL conical tube filled with 25 mL of the ice-cold EGC isolation solution.\nGently shake the tube in either an orbital shaker or a rocking plate at 4°C (fridge or cold-room) for 15 min.\nTriturate the tissue pieces by pipetting up and down 20 times the tissue-solution mixture using a moistened 10 mL plastic pipette.\nNote: Moistening the pipette with EGC dissociation solution will avoid tissues sticking inside.\nRecover the tissues by filtering the mixture through a 100 μm strainer.\nUse forceps to transfer them to a new 50 mL conical tube filled with 25 mL of the ice-cold EGC isolation solution.",
    "Repeat three times, or until the solution is clear.\nTransfer tissue pieces to a 15 mL conical tube containing 10 mL of the Corning Cell Recovery solution and rock for 30 min at 4°C (cold room or fridge).\nTriturate the tissue pieces by pipetting up and down 20 times the tissue-solution mixture using a moistened 5 mL plastic pipette to dissociate EGCs from the mucosa.\nFilter through a 40 μm strainer in a 50 mL conical tube. Discard the tissue pieces.\nWash the strainer with 2 mL of cold PBS 1×. Transfer the flow-through to a 15 mL conical tube.\nSpin at 2,000 g and 4°C for 5 min.\nGently resuspend pellets in 1 mL of EGC culture media.\nPlate 330 μL of cell suspension in a well containing 170 μL of EGC culture media (PDL and laminin coated 12-well plate; 3 wells in total).\nAfter 24 h, slowly pipette off the media containing non-adherent stromal cells.\nGently rinse with PBS 1×. Replace with fresh pre-warmed EGC culture media.\nCells can be used for experiments 3–4 days after plating (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1614-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Organoids can be combined with conditioned media from primary EGC culture. We previously demonstrated that EGC media alone are not sufficient to sustain organoid growth (Baghdadi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Thus, we mixed 50% of EGC conditioned media (EGC-CM) with 50% of ENR organoid media. In these conditions, organoids can be expanded and passaged as usual for at least two weeks (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). In addition, EGC-CM can also be used for organoids that have been in culture for several months with the same efficiency.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1614-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Organoids cultured with EGC conditioned media sustain growth and survival over time\n(A) Organoids cultured with ENR:EGC-CM (50:50) for 2, 7, 10 and 14 days.

Scale bar, 150 μm. n=4 mice. Error bars indicate SD. n.s: non significant p value; two-tailed paired Student’s t test.\nAfter 3–4 days of culture (following part 2: Isolation and culture of mucosal enteric glial cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2], step 61), aspirate the EGC culture media and wash the wells twice with PBS 1×.\nAdd 500 μL of fresh pre-warmed EGC culture media without serum and GDNF.\nNote: Removing serum is essential to avoid adding extra growth factors to organoid culture.\n24 h later, collect this serum-free EGC conditioned media (EGC-CM) into a 15 mL conical tube. Pool all the wells from one mouse together.\nFilter the EGC-CM through a syringe equipped with a 0.22 μm pore size filter.\nPause point: Filtered EGC-CM can be stored at −80°C for later use and thawed at 37°C for organoid culture.",
    "Mix EGC-CM with ENR media at a 50:50 ratio: 125 μL of EGC-CM + 125 μL ENR media per well. Incubate this solution at 37°C for 10 min.\n4 days after culture (following part 1: Preparation of crypt organoid culture[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1], step 30), aspirate the ENR media from organoid culture.\nAdd 350 μL the ENR:EGC-CM mix.\nIncubate the organoids at 37°C and analyze them 48 h–72 h later (see part 4: Analysis of organoids[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]).\nPart 4: Analysis of organoids\nOne common method to analyze stem cell function using organoids is to measure the efficiency of de novo crypt formation (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). However, this phenotypic analysis does not allow a deep understanding of the different cell populations present in the crypts. Here, we propose two methods to assess crypt cellular composition and stem cell properties: a) RT-qPCR for transcriptional analysis (part 4A. RNA extraction for transcriptional analysis by RT-qPCR[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4.1]) and b) flow cytometry for analysis of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) number (part 4B: Cellular analysis of organoids by flow cytometry[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4.2]).\nPart 4A. RNA extraction for transcriptional analysis by RT-qPCR\nTiming: 7–8 h\nCritical: RNA molecules are highly sensitive to degradation. To isolate intact, high-quality RNA, it is essential that RNases are not introduced throughout the RNA extraction procedure. Decontaminate pipettors, benchtops, centrifuge, and ice bucket with a surface decontamination solution like RNAse Away®, and use RNAse-free tips, tubes, PBS 1× and H20. In addition, the whole procedure should be done fast to avoid RNA degradation.\nFollowing step 69, remove media from organoid culture and add 400 μL of ice-cold PBS 1× per well. Incubate the plate on ice for 5 min.\nBreak up the Matrigel-organoid dome by pipetting up and down.\nNote: To avoid bubbles, set the pipette at 250 μL.",
    "Pool two wells into a 15 mL conical tube filled with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS 1×. Pipette up and down with a 1,000 μL pipette 15 times to further dissociate the Matrigel.\nNote: For solid statistical analysis, we recommend to pool 2 wells for one qPCR data point and use 3 data points per mouse and/or condition.\nCentrifuge at 150 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 350 μL of Qiagen RLT buffer supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol.\nCritical: β-mercaptoethanol is toxic and should be used in the fume hood.\nVortex the tubes for 30 s to fully lyse the organoids.\nSpin the tubes at 150 g for 1 min at 4°C.\nPause point: At this step, the lysate can be transferred to a RNAse-free 1.5 mL tube, snap frozen in dry ice and kept at −80°C until ready for RNA extraction.\nProceed with the Qiagen RNeasy® Plus Mini extraction kit according to the manufacturers’ instructions: https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24&lang=en].\nPause point: RNA can be kept at −80°C until ready for the reverse transcription step.\nMeasure RNA yield and concentration with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.\nFor an optimal amplification, use ≤ 50 ng of RNA for one qPCR well.\nTransfer the necessary quantity of RNA in a clean RNAse-free 1.5 mL tube.\nPerform reverse transcription according to manufacturers’ guidelines: https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FsuperscriptIII_man.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FsuperscriptIII_man.pdf].\nPause point: cDNA can be stored at −80°C until ready to load qPCR plate.\nRun qPCR following manufacturers’ instructions: https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fcms_042179.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fcms_042179.pdf].\nNote: For 1 qPCR well: Mix 5 μL of SYBR green master mix + 4 μL cDNA + 1 μL primer mix (forward + reverse at 10 μM).\nCritical: Load qPCR plate on ice.",
    "Analyze data using the 2-ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). We recommend the use of two independent genes for expression normalization. First normalize the gene of interest with each housekeeping gene separately and perform the mean value of both to obtain the final 2-ΔΔCT value.\nNote: Specific forward and reverse primers for commonly used crypt population markers are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Tbp and Rpl13 are normalization housekeeping genes.\nPart 4B: Cellular analysis of organoids by flow cytometry\nTiming: 3 h\nFor analysis of ISCs by flow cytometry, we use crypt organoids derived from Lgr5-GFP mice (Barker et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) for labeling ISCs and organoids from wild-type (no GFP) mice for setting up the negative staining and single stained controls (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1614-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analysis of Lgr5High ISC frequency in organoids by flow cytometry\n(A) Representative scheme of the experimental flow.\n(B) Gating strategy to determine ISC proportion in organoids. First, doublets are gated out by FSC-H (forward scatter) versus FSC-A and then by SSC-H (side scatter) versus SSC-A gates. Second, single staining controls of PI, GFP, Epcam-APC and CD24-Pacific Blue are performed to distinguish the positive signal from the background negative signal and to evaluate if fluorescence compensation is required. After setting up all parameters (laser, compensation, positive signal), organoid samples can be analyzed. After gating on singlet, dead cells are excluded with Propidium Iodide (PI) staining. CD24 is plotted versus SSC and cells with low/medium expression of CD24 (20% of total CD24+ cells), and low granularity (40% of SSC) labeled as CD24Low/Med /SSCLow/Med are selected. From this cell population, Epcam-APC is gated versus GFP, and all the Epcam+/Lgr5-GFPHigh cells, labeled as ISCs, are selected. FACS plots were originally depicted in Baghdadi et al.
