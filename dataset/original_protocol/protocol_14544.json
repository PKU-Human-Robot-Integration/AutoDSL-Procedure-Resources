    "All procedures performed on animals comply with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statements for animal use in vision research. Fourteen four- to six-month-old male/female C57BL/6J wild type mice were used: ten mice for the injury model and four as control animals (unwounded corneas).\n1. Animal Preparation\nAnesthetize a mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of a 100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine mixture. After the anesthesia has taken effect, pinch the toe to confirm the anesthesia depth; the animal should not react.\nInspect the eye under a slit lamp before conducting the experiments to verify the absence of any previous corneal injury.\nInstill a drop of 1% tetracaine hydrochloride onto the eye. After 60 - 90 sec, test the corneal reflex to confirm the absence of sensation. Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% can be used instead.\nWhen the loss of corneal sensation is certain, gently place a drop of 5% povidone-iodine on the eye and on the hair around the eye. Wipe off the drop after 1 min or spread it on the hair around the eye to prevent the hair from interfering with the tool tip.\n2. Abrading the Corneal Epithelium\nWear surgical gloves and a gown. Prepare the required tools: a sterile rotating burr and a pair of sterile tweezers. For better control, use bent tweezers. Place the tools on a sterile sheet during the procedure.\nUsing the bent tweezers, stabilize the eye by grabbing the lids from the nasal side and gently proptosing the eye. Avoid using too much pressure.\nUnder a surgical microscope, shave 360Â° around the limbal area twice using the sterile rotating burr. Go around the limbus with a speed of 5 - 6 sec per round.",
    "NOTE: The burr has one fixed speed. However, for it to rotate at the established speed, the \"end nut\" should be completely tightened.\nRemove the whole corneal epithelium from limbus to limbus with the rotating burr. For better results, move the tool in a circular fashion and hold it somewhat parallel to the corneal surface to work with the lateral side of its tip. Take care not to injure the stroma by not re-brushing the areas where the epithelium has already been removed. Do not apply any pressure on the eye. Clean the brush tip as required.\nInstill a drop of sterile phosphate-buffered saline on the cornea and wipe away any detached epithelial sheets with a soft cleaning tissue.\nShave the remaining epithelium, if any.\nPay attention to the mouse tail during the surgery.\n\tNOTE: If any movement occurs, the anesthesia depth has faded and further injection is required. One-third to two-thirds of the primary injected volume should be sufficient. Do not overdose the animal with the anesthetic medication.\nSterilize all the tools before using them on another eye.\n3. Confirm Complete Epithelial Removal\nApply a drop of 1 mg/ml fluorescein sodium onto the cornea. Clean the cornea after 30 sec and examine it under a microscope with a cobalt blue filter to verify the complete removal of the epithelium.\n\tNOTE: Corneal areas with epithelial defects are visualized in green.\n4. Post-operation Care\nPut the animal on a heating blanket and keep it in a safe place (e.g., in its cage) while under recovery. Do not keep an unconscious animal in the company of conscious ones.\nApply 1% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment. This will also prevent eye dryness. Continue the application the antibiotic daily for a week.",
    "Inject 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously after the procedure and again after 12 hr. Continue the injection twice per day for two days.\nObserve the animal for 30 - 45 min, until complete recovery from anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Mild movement of the respiratory muscles on the ventral surface indicates animal wellness while under recovery.\nSubscription Required.
