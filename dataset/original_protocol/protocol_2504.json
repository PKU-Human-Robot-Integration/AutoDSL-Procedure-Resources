    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Proboscis extension response assay\nPrepare fresh particle food\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section describes the preparation of the particle food solution for the following behavioral tests.\nPrepare a 50 mM sucrose solution from a 500 mM sucrose stock solution by adding 950 μL water to 50 μL 500 mM sucrose solution.\nWeigh the silica microsphere powder (∼2–4 mg).\nTransfer the particles to a 0.6 mL microfuge tube.\nAdd 50 mM sucrose solution (20–40 μL depending on exactly how much silica is weighed out) to make a 10% w/v particle solution.\nMix by pipetting with a 10 μL pipette tip for 5 s.\nNote: Seal the tube with parafilm, store at room temperature, and use within 3 days of preparation.\nTrapping flies in a pipette tip\nTiming: 20–30 min\nThis section describes how to prepare flies for the taste assays.\nThe PER assays are performed after immobilizing the flies in a pipette tip as described below and demonstrated in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]. The 20–30 min is the time required to immobilize ∼24 flies (∼12 flies/group). The PER assays are performed after the fly preparations are done. Repeat steps 7-12 as needed depending on how many flies are to be tested. Beginners may take ∼2 min to prepare one fly. After practice, this typically requires only 30–60 s per preparation.\nAttach a 1 mL pipette tip to soft rubber tubing with the narrow side pointing out.\nTrim the narrow side of the 1 mL tip slightly with a razor blade to allow an individual fly to be introduced (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A; Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2138-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Introducing a fly into a pipette tip for performing PER assays\n(A) Apparatus for aspirating a fly into a 1 mL pipette tip.",
    "(B) Aspirate the fly into a 200 mL pipette tip.\n(C) A fly immobilized for performing a PER assay.\nAttach another 1 mL pipette to the other side with the wide end sticking out. This latter end is used to mouth aspirate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAspirate a fly into the 1 mL pipette tip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAttach a 200 μL tip to the end and expel the fly into the 200 μL pipette tip.\nGently shake the pipette tip downward while blowing out the air to trap the fly in the end of the tip with the fly head towards the open end (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The head should be slightly loose.\nUsing a razor blade, make a horizontal cut to remove any extra tip material above the fly head (first cut, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nDraw the fly back slightly from the end of the 200 μL by gentle inhalation, before introducing a second cut at an angle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C),\nExpel air to push the fly head a little out over the open end of the tip so that the labellum only is exposed.\nRemove the 200 μL tip from the apparatus.\nNote: The legs should be hidden inside of the tip.\nInsert a very small cotton ball with a sharp wooden stick under the fly to immobilize it (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: It may be necessary to try a second or third fly to obtain a fly with the proper orientation. Do not jam the fly too hard at the end of the 200 μL tip.\nNote: Place each individual fly preparation on a wet paper towel to keep the fly hydrated if you do not use the fly immediately.",
    "Note: If the flies are properly fixed, they will survive overnight in a humidified chamber (a tip box containing wet paper, e.g., a Kimwipe). However, it is best to use the flies right away.\nAlternatives: The sharp wooden stick (step 12) can be replaced with a 10 μL pipette tip overlaid with the top half of a second 10 μL pipette tip, which can reach the inside tip of the 200 μL pipette.\nCritical: To avoid damaging the fly labellum, be careful to inhale gently to withdraw the fly slightly from the end of the 200 μL pipette (step 7).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Fixing a fly in a tip, related to step 6\nProboscis extension response assay\nTiming: 15 min (for step 13–18)\nThis section describes how to perform the taste tests and score the behavioral responses.\nSaturate the fly with water before performing a PER assay with sugar/particle food.\nTo test if each fly is water saturated, offer each fly a drop of water at the end of a 10 μL pipette tip.\nNote: Wild-type and w1118 flies usually do not drink upon water application. ∼10% of the flies drink water ≤5 s and then do not drink the second offering of water.\nNote: Flies that drink water >5 s are discarded (typically <1% of the flies tested).\nMix the particle food in the 200 μL microfuge tube by pipetting for 3 s.\nWithdraw 2 μL of the particle food into a 10 μL pipette tip. Pipette the particle food in and out of the tip 2–3 times to mix the contents.",
    "Make contact between the labellum and the drop at the end of the tip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The contact time is ∼0.2–0.6 s. The liquid drop should be quickly withdrawn from the fly to allow full extension of the proboscis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2138-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Images of fly responses to particle food\n(A) Particle food contacting the labellum.\n(B) Fly extending its proboscis to ingest particle food.\nAs a control, perform PER assays using 50 mM sucrose alone with a parallel group of flies.\nTest all the flies with 500 mM sucrose alone. Flies that do not respond should be discarded.\nScore the responses as follows:\n1—The fly fully extends its proboscis and consumes food for ≥1 s (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]; can see the esophagus moving).\n0.5—The fly extends its proboscis and consumes food for <1 s.\n0—The fly fails to extend its proboscis.\nEach trial (n=1) includes ≥ 12 flies.\nNote: Based on the effect size comparing control flies and tmem63 mutants (Li and Montell, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), ≥8 flies are required. For comparing other mutants with control flies, we recommend ≥ 12 flies in case the effect size is smaller.\nThe PER index is calculated as:\n  PER =  ( sum of the scores )  /  ( number of flies tested )   \nRepeat the experiments 5 times on different days.\nNote: See below for more information on how to calculate and display the PER data (expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]; Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9], Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nPart 2: Calcium imaging of md-L neurons",
    "When the fly proboscis contacts liquid food, ∼3–4 L-type hairs per labium are deflected. The bending angles of the hairs cause curvature at the base of multiple sensilla and induce mechanical stimulation of md-L neurons. The angle of deflection of the hairs by food mixed with particles is larger compared with clear food. In this assay, we push the cuticle to deflect multiple hairs with various degrees of intensity to mimic the force on the labellum conferred by the grittiness in the food. Refer to Li and Montell (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nGenetic crosses\nTiming: 2 weeks (for step 22)\nThis section describes the genetic crosses to obtain flies for performing calcium imaging on md-L neurons.\nCross tmc-Gal4 flies with the UAS-GCaMP6f,UAS-tdTomato line or alternatives (see below).\nCollect 20–30 F1 flies (UAS-GCaMP6f,UAS-tdTomato/+;tmc-Gal4/+).\nTo make sure that the flies are healthy and are a consistent age, 1 day before dissecting the heads, transfer 3–5 day-old flies to a fresh vial.\nNote: It is acceptable to use older flies, as long as the ages are consistent among the genotypes.\nNote: UAS-GCaMP6f,UAS-tdTomato/+;tmc-Gal4/+ flies express the fluorescence proteins tdTomato, which is red, and the GCaMP6f, which is green, in the md-L neuron located in the middle of each labellum.\nAlternatives: In this example, the UAS-GCaMP6f and UAS-tdTomato transgenes are recombined onto a single chromosome. Other versions of GCaMP (including GCaMP7 and GCaMP8) can be used. For the baseline control, other fluorescent proteins (such as UAS-mCherry) can be used.\nFly head dissection and specimen preparation\nTiming: 10 min (for step 25)\nThis section describes the procedures for dissecting and preparing fly heads for calcium imaging.\nObtain the chambers previously prepared and silicone lubricant. Place a drop of silicone lubricant in the middle of the chamber (see above: “prepare chambers for the calcium imaging experiments[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4].”",
    "Briefly anesthetize the flies by injecting CO2 into the vial or by incubating the vial on ice for 2–3 min.\nWithdraw the fly by grabbing its wings with forceps and place it in a dissection well containing 1× PBS.\nDissect the head away from the body by cutting the neck with fine scissors.\nIncubate the isolated head for 5–8 min in PBS until the proboscis fully extends and the labellum is in a closed state (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2138-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Images of dissected fly heads\n(A) Dissected fly heads floating and incubating in 1× PBS. The blue arrows point to labella in an open state, while the yellow arrows point to labella in a closed state.\n(B) An example of a fly with the labellum in a flat and unfolded position (yellow arrow).\n(C) An example of a fly head positioned on silicone lubricant with the proboscis extended and with the labellum curled up (blue arrow).\nTransfer the fly head from dissection well to the chamber. Immobilize the fly head in the silicone in the chamber.\nOrient the head on one side with one eye facing up.\nPick the fly head with labellum in a closed state using forceps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nHold the head carefully with one side facing up.\nAttach one side of the labellum to the grease so that the labellum sticks to the grease.\nNote: If the proboscis is contracted, then hold the head and pull back slightly to fully extend the proboscis, and attach the head on the grease so that one side of the labellum remains flat and unfolded (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), and adjust the grease beneath the sample to make the labellum horizontal.\nAdd a drop of water (∼60 μL) to the chamber.",
    "Note: Keep the labellum flat and stretched in a horizontal position to help visualize the position of the labellum and sensillum as you apply force. If the labellum curls up (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C), use a new preparation.\nNote: After sticking the extended proboscis on the silicone lubricant, remove any bubbles around the labellum, which would interfere with the imaging.\nCritical: Be careful not to damage the labellum when removing the head with the forceps and scissors.\nLive confocal microscopy\nTiming: 10–20 min per sample (for step 34)\nThis section describes the confocal microscopy setup, and the methods to record the responses of md-L neurons due to mechanical stimuli.\nFor imaging experiments, use a laser scanning confocal microscope and perform the imaging at room temperature (∼23°C).\nNote: We used a Zeiss LSM 700 upright confocal microscope with a w Plan-Apochromat 20× /1.0 water objective and 1.9× optical zoom. Set the pinhole to 2.07 Airy Units = 4.1 μm section and scan at 614.4 ms per frame in line at 8 bits (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nSet the ZEN SP5 software to acquire the images at 256 × 256 pixels. With these settings, the pixel sizes are 0.67 μm × 0.67 μm and the image sizes are 171.8 μm × 171.8 μm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2138-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Panel settings on the Zeiss LSM 700 for live image recordings\nUse the 488 and 555 nm laser excitation lines to image EGFP and tdTomato, respectively.\nAcquire the bright-field image using the tdTomato channel (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Set the time series to record 3 images on the three channels at 614.4 ms intervals.",
    "Note: To obtain the highest spatial resolution with the highest temporal resolution (fastest scanning speed), we chose 256 × 256 pixels, and limited the scanning area to the region containing only the labellum and the extruded hairs. The soma of the md-L neuron will cover ∼200 pixels with the LSM700 set at a scanning frequency of 614.4 ms. For other confocal microscopes, adjust the image pixels and the scanning frequency to so that it is in the range of dozens to hundreds of ms.\nPlace the slide with the plastic chamber containing the head on the microscope stage under the 20× water immersion objective (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2138-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Preparation for performing calcium imaging on md-L neurons\n(A) The setup for applying mechanical force to the labellum. The glass pipette tip is controlled by a motorized micromanipulator. The GCaMP6f responses are monitored using a 20× water immersion objective.\n(B) A glass tip pointing at the labellum. The L7, L8 and L9 sensilla are indicated.\nPlace the end of the glass tip on the cuticle between the L8 and S6 sensilla (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B; S6 not visible in this image. Adjust focus to visualize S6).\nBegin recording the GCaMP6f, tdTomato fluorescence signals, and the bright-field at the same time.\nTo provide a baseline, record ≥5 frames before introducing the mechanical stimulus.\nUsing the glass tip that is touching the cuticle, apply mechanical force by controlling the step distances in one direction (5–40 μm) with a motorized micromanipulator and Linlab 2 software.\nPush the glass tip on the labellum in the proximal direction (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2138-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Image alignment\nAlign the soma of the md-L neuron in the calcium imaging videos using the template matching plugin in Fiji.\n(A) Fiji control panel and selection of the Split Channel menu option.",
    "(B) Split the videos into the tdTomato (left), bright field (middle) and EGFP (right) channels.\n(C) Combine the split tdTomato and EGFP image stacks in the same frame and select the ROI using the tdTomato signal as the landmark for the alignment, ROI is selected as a rectangular yellow box shown in the figure.\n(D) Align slices dialog box.\nThe duration of each stimulus is 2 s, which is the total time for stepping in and out.\nThe step distances are measured using video recordings of the bright-field images and Zeiss confocal software, or Fiji software.\nSave the videos using the .lsm format.\nNote: The L8 and S6 sensilla are in the middle distal region of the labellum (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section; Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). L8 is on the top layer of the labellum, while S6 is on the bottom layer. After placing the glass tip on the cuticle between L8 and S6, and before applying mechanical stimuli, re-adjust the focus on the md-L neuron cell soma and start recording. Because the soma of the md-L neuron soma is located near the middle of the labellum, the glass tip can still be seen on the screen.\nNote: Set the XYZ parameters on the Linlab 2 software (5–40 μm for one direction and 0 for the other two directions) to control the motion distance in each direction.\nOptional: The indentation distances on the cuticle (10–40 μm; see Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A), which are produced by the motion of the glass tip, are measured with software on the confocal microscope (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nImage processing\nTiming: 20–30 min\nThis section describes the processing of calcium imaging videos of md-L neurons using Fiji software, and the analysis of the neuronal responses to obtain curves showing the Ca2+ dynamics.",
