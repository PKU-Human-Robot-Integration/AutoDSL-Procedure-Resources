    "Animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Animal Use Protocol approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University Health Network. Male Lewis rats (255-330 g) were given ad libitum access to food and water. Then, they were maintained in a controlled environment (18-22 °C) with a 12 h day-night cycle. See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, solutions, and instruments used in this protocol.\n1. Initialization of the  ex vivo lung perfusion system\nEnsure that all transducers are connected to the isolated perfusion organ equipment and the data acquisition system (Figure 1). Then, open the data acquisition software.\nBefore perfusion, fill the EVLP circuit with 150 mL of Steen solution supplemented with 1,000 USP units of sodium heparin, 50 mg of cefazolin, and 50 mg of methylprednisolone.\nSet the warm water bath to 20 °C. Start circulating warm water to warm up the entire EVLP system.\n2. Donor lung procurement procedure\nAnesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) or according to local practice. Confirm proper depth of anesthesia by checking the toe pinch reflex.\nPerform orotracheal intubation (14 G intravenous catheter). After intubation, connect the tracheal tube to the small-animal ventilation system. Ventilate the rat with a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg, rate of 60 breaths/min, inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 0.5, and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 cmH2O.\nPlace the rat in the supine position.\nWith the help of appropriate scissors and forceps, enter the peritoneal cavity and carry the incision cranially, performing a median laparotomy and injecting sodium heparin (400 USP units) into the portal vein.",
    "Subsequently, enter the thoracic cavity through the xyphoid process. Carry out the sternotomy with the cranial resection of the sternum and cautious radial opening of the diaphragm, so as not to damage the lung.\nTo retrieve the heart and lung block, make an incision in the inferior vena cava (IVC) and along the apex of the left heart.\nUsing micro scissors, perform an anterior incision in the right ventricular outflow tract. Then, insert an 18 G intravenous catheter into the pulmonary trunk and flush the lungs with 20 mL of low potassium dextran (LPD) solution containing 10 µg/mL of prostaglandin E1.\nImmediately after flushing, clamp the lower third of the trachea at the end of inspiration to preserve the lungs in an inflated state.\nHarvest the heart and lung block and place it in LPD solution for storage.\n\t​NOTE: The lung graft can be stored at temperatures and different intervals of time according to the research purpose. Here, we show representative results of lungs that underwent varying lengths of cold ischemic time (CIT) on ice.\n3. Ex vivo lung perfusion procedure\nPlace a 0 silk ligature beneath the main pulmonary artery (PA) and around the ventricles, and pretied to facilitate cannulation.\nConnect the PA cannula in the inflow line of the EVLP system and start the peristaltic pump with 10% of maintenance flow, allowing the removal of any air in the PA cannula.\nPlace and secure the inflow cannula into the main PA (OD: 2.0 mm/Head Diameter: 2.5 mm), followed by the drainage cannula from the apex of the heart into the left atrium (LA-Head Diameter: 4.0 mm) through the mitral valve for subsequent perfusion. Use forceps to dilate the mitral valve, facilitating the cannulation.",
    "Make a small hole in the trachea and insert the tracheal cannula (OD: 2.0 mm/L: 14 mm). Then, connect it to the ventilation line of the system.\nConnect the LA cannula to the outflow line of the system.\nNOTE: We set 10% of maintenance flow as the initiation of perfusion. To avoid the insertion of air bubbles in the lungs, ensure the bubble trap is filled.\nGradually increase the flow rate perfusion to reach 20% of the cardiac output (CO).\n\tNOTE: To perfuse both lungs, we used an estimated CO of 75 mL/min for 250 g rats10,11. The flow rate of perfusion was gradually increased to 1 h to reach the target flow rate according to our clinical EVLP protocol12. The perfusion parameters are summarized in Table 113.\nRemove the tracheal clamp 20 min after the initiation of perfusion and start lung ventilation followed by starting the flow of EVLP gas (8% CO2, 6% O2, 86% N2) to maintain inflow perfusate PCO2 of between 35 and 45 mmHg.\n\t​NOTE: The ventilation parameters are summarized in Table 113.\n4. Parameters and sample management\nEvery hour during EVLP, record in real time the dynamic lung compliance and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).\n\tNOTE: At 5 min before the physiological assessments, the lungs should be expanded to an inflation pressure.\nTake perfusate samples from the sample port every hour and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen for further analyses.\n\tNOTE: In addition, we perform a recruitment maneuver (up to 20 cmH2O) 5 min before assessment, after which we take perfusates for blood gas analyses to measure pH, PCO2, PO2, electrolytes, glucose, and lactate.",
    "Stop perfusion and clamp the trachea to maintain the lungs in an inflated state. Subsequently, isolate lung samples and flash freeze them in liquid nitrogen or place them in fixing solutions for further studies.\n\tNOTE: Here, the lungs were perfused for 4 h.\nSubscription Required.
