    "Tissue collection All biopsies should be randomly sampled from the same anatomical location from anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs, as previously described (Stenlo et al., 2020, 2021). Samples should be taken by the same surgeon across all animals and timepoints to minimize differences in the sampling procedure. Prior to administering any injurious agents or sham treatment controls (e.g., saline), baseline samples are obtained. A small wedge resection is taken from the right lower lobe through a small thoracotomy and used for baseline samples. Endpoint samples from both the right and left lungs (upper and lower lobes) are taken as small wedge resections through a sternotomy. Wedge resections for biopsies are sampled randomly within the same anatomical location within each lobe to decrease bias. For scoring, biopsies from similar lobes are compared against one another, as different lobes have different susceptibilities to severe lung injury in these models. See Note 1 for details on tissue sampling in porcine models.Immediately after the samples are taken, biopsies of 0.5–1.0 cm3 should be placed in a sterile 15 mL conical tube, with 10% neutral buffered formalin solution, with at least two times the volume of the tissue for fixation. Leave at 4 °C overnight (at least 12 h and up to 48 h).After fixation, replace formalin with fresh and sterile PBS solution. The tissue can be stored at 4 °C in PBS until processing. See Note 2 for details on longer term storage in these conditions.Prepare the workspace for sectioning tissue biopsies (Figure 3A).The tissue should be stabilized with the help of forceps and sectioned into multiple small pieces in a glass petri dish with a sterilized scalpel (Figure 3B).",
    "Prepare segments of approximately 5 mm in the longest dimension and no smaller than 3 mm thick (or the thickness of the slots in the cassettes). Using forceps, place them in the tissue processing/embedding cassettes (Figure 3C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4493/bioprotoc-12-16-4493-g003.jpgFigure 3. Tissue sectioning from biopsies prior to tissue processing. A) Preparation for tissue sectioning; B) Sectioning of the tissue with a scalpel; C) Transfer of the tissue sections into a pre-labeled cassette.Up to 80 cassettes containing tissue should be placed into the first container (container 1) of an Automated Spin Tissue Processor STP-120 (Figure 1), or equivalent, for subsequent tissue processing (dehydration and clearing) and paraffin infiltration, according to the protocol described in the next sections. The steps outlined in Sections B–D should be programmed into the tissue processor. See Notes 3 and 4 for details on programming the tissue processor.Waste formalin solutions, and all subsequently described solutions should be discarded according to local chemical and biohazardous waste regulations (see Note 5 for further details).Dehydration (graded ethanol series and isopropanol)Solutions of graded ethanol should be prepared ahead of time in deionized water or isopropanol as described below (step B3) and placed into the tissue processor containers. See Recipe 2 for further details.The basket containing the cassettes should be slowly immersed into the lowest concentration ethanol container (container 1), stirring at 60 rotations per minute with changes in rotational direction every 60 seconds. The rotational agitation helps to achieve a more homogenous and complete infiltration of tissue with the dehydration and ethanol mixtures, due to increased diffusion as compared to immersion based protocols (Ostrander, 1996; Suvarna et al., 2018).Set the automatic tissue processor for each of the solutions and incubation times:Container 1: ethanol 30% – 1.5 hContainer 2: ethanol 50% – 1.5 hContainer 3: ethanol 70% – 1.",
    "5 hContainer 4: ethanol 80% – 1.5 hContainer 5: ethanol 80% – 1.5 hContainer 6: ethanol–isopropanol 80–20% – 1.5 hContainer 7: ethanol–isopropanol 80–20% – 1.5 hClearing (Diaphanization) Since xylene is associated with health hazards and an unfavorable environmental profile, isopropanol can be used to replace xylene as both a dehydrating and a clearing agent. The following steps occur immediately after Section B.Container 8: isopropanol 100% – 1.5 hContainer 9: isopropanol 100% – 1.5 hContainer 10: isopropanol 100% – 1.5 hParaffin wax infiltration To ensure complete infiltration of the paraffin into the full tissue thickness, the dehydrated and cleared tissue segments in the cassettes are automatically moved to the final containers in the tissue processor, which contain molten paraffin, in two different steps at 65 °C controlled temperature.Container 11: Paraffin – 6 hContainer 12: Paraffin – 12 hParaffin embedding Place 5–10 pieces of paraffin infiltrated tissue into the metal base mold with the lung parenchyma facing down (or according to the orientation needed); fill the bottom portion of the histology cassette and mold with molten paraffin, covering the tissue (Figure 4A–C).Quickly place the bottom portion of the histology cassette on top of the molten paraffin. Let the entire assembly cool down for at least 10 min on the cooling tray, until the paraffin has completely solidified (Figure 4D).After the solidification is complete, the paraffin block and cassette case can be easily removed for subsequent sectioning.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4493/bioprotoc-12-16-4493-g004.jpgFigure 4.

See Note 6 for more details on section thickness.Use forceps to pick up the sectioned tissue, and transfer to a pre-warmed water bath at 40 °C. Allow the tissue to float flat on the water surface (Figure 5C) until no visible creases can be seen in the paraffin (Figure 5D). (See Notes 7–9 for further details on the water bath).Carefully place the floating sections onto the histological glass slides as desired for subsequent staining and imaging.Slides containing tissue sections should be allowed to dry overnight on the glass slides. For long-term storage, keep them covered at room temperature until staining (see Note 10 for more details).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4493/bioprotoc-12-16-4493-g005.jpgFigure 5.

    "Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining Slides should be placed overnight in an oven at 65 °C in horizontal slide racks to allow the excess paraffin to melt away prior to deparaffinization and staining (Figure 6A).For all the steps below, place slides into Coplin jars filled with the following solutions and for the designated incubation times. Each step below is listed according to a new solution into which it is placed (i.e., if the same solution is listed for two subsequent steps, the slides should be placed into a new container with fresh solution). Coplin jars may be reused throughout the protocol if sufficiently rinsed and dried between steps.DeparaffinizationCoplin Jar 1: Xylene – 3 min (see Notes 11 and 12 regarding potential xylene substitution)Coplin Jar 2: Xylene – 3 minRehydrationCoplin Jar 3: Ethanol 100% – 3 minCoplin Jar 4: Ethanol 100% – 3 minCoplin Jar 5: Ethanol 90% – 3 minCoplin Jar 6: Ethanol 70% – 3 minCoplin Jar 7: Rinse in deionized water – 1 minStainingCoplin Jar 8: Stain with hematoxylin solution – 7 minCoplin Jar 9: Rinse once in deionized waterWash in running tap water, ensuring water flow is not directly on the slides (see Figure 6C) – 15 minCoplin Jar 10: Incubate/wash in distilled water – 2 minCoplin Jar 11: Immerse the sections in Eosin Y (0.",

Images for each slide should be extracted at three different digital magnifications (4×, 10×, and 20×) in the OlyVIA Olympus Software viewer, and assembled per slide into a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation containing a small scoring box (Table 1) for subsequent digital scoring by blinded scorers, as described below (see Figure 7 for example score sheets). Randomize the slides using a random number generator in Microsoft Excel (see Note 13 for further details). Identical acquisition settings and image brightness adjustments must be used for all the conditions (see Note 14 for further details).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4493/bioprotoc-12-16-4493-g007.jpgFigure 7. Representative examples of three different scoring sheets supplied to reviewers for the histological scoring system.",
    "Three different examples of the photomicrographs at three digital magnifications (4×, 10×, and 20× to provide representative views across magnifications). The score sheet uses a modified version of Table 1 on each page to collect information.Scoring As evident in the literature (Rosenthal et al., 1998; Martin and Matute-Bello, 2011; Ballard-Croft et al., 2012; Engel et al., 2020), the porcine model of ALI can have different features than those of small animal models (Wang et al., 2008). Therefore, and based on our previous experience in small and large animal models of ALI, we selected seven histological features for our porcine scoring system (inflammatory cells, hyaline membranes, proteinaceous debris, thickening of alveolar wall, hemorrhage, atelectasis, and a general injury score entitled ‘enhanced injury’) (see Figure 8). The selection of these main features has been recently and independently confirmed by an international panel of experts to be present and relevant in animal models of ARDS (Matute-Bello et al., 2011; Kulkarni et al., 2022) (see Note 15 for further details on the selection of the relevant features for large animal models). Previous histological scoring systems for lung and other organs have been developed, prior to the more widespread use of slide scanning technology, for use with manual microscopy methods (Gibson-Corley et al., 2013). Therefore, previous scoring methods have used randomization of multiple, high magnification regions and scoring of features utilizing a binary or three-point system (Guenthart et al., 2019; Frick et al., 2021; Leiphrakpam et al., 2021). However, scoring systems in small animal lung injury models have evolved to have larger score ranges to increase their sensitivity (e.g., for pulmonary fibrosis) (Ashcroft et al., 1988; Hubner et al., 2008). Therefore, we opted for a range of 0 (no damage)—8 (extensive damage) for each of the seven features selected as relevant (see Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4493/bioprotoc-12-16-4493-g008.",
    "jpgFigure 8. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections demonstrating the different features selected for development of the lung tissue injury score system in low and high magnification. Black arrowheads demonstrate examples of features.Scorers should be given a standardized training form with example histological images not contained in their scoring set. These images should contain text describing each feature, as well as arrows demonstrating each feature, as some animals with severe injury can contain multiple features in one image. The scorers should then be instructed to give scores depending on the severity of injury of these features on the scanned slides. Figure 8 presents an example of an overview of the features to be scored. See Notes 16 and 17 for details on the number of scorers and expertise.Table 1.
