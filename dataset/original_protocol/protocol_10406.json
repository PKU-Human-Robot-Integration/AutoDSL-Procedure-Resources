    "1. SU8 Master Fabrication\nDesign the microfluidic structures for three layer fabrication using design software and have the designs printed by a vendor on circuit board film with 10 µm resolution. The details of device design are given in an attached reference 6 and the channel geometries are shown in Figure 1. The layers should include alignment marks to help collocate features from each fabrication layer 8.\nPlace a pre-cleaned 3 inch diameter silicon wafer on a spin coater and turn on the vacuum to affix it to the chuck. Apply 1 ml of SU8-3050 in the center of the wafer and spin for 20 sec at 500 rpm, then 30 sec at 1,750 rpm, providing a layer thickness of 80 µm.\nRemove the wafer and bake on a 135 °C hotplate for 30 min. Allow the wafer to cool to RT before moving on to the next step.\nExpose the coated wafer to the 1st layer mask under a collimated 190 mW, 365 nm LED for 3 min. After exposure, place the wafer on a 135 °C hotplate for 1 min, then cool to RT before proceeding to the next step.\nPlace the wafer on the spin coater and turn on the vacuum to affix it to the chuck. Apply 1 ml of SU8-3050 in the center of the wafer and spin for 20 sec at 500 rpm, then 30 sec at 5,000 rpm, resulting in a layer that provides an additional thickness of 40 µm.\nRemove the wafer and bake on a 135 °C hotplate for 30 min, then cool to RT before moving to the next step.",
    "Align the 2nd layer mask onto the geometry patterned in 1.3 and expose the coated wafer to a collimated 190 mW, 365 nm LED for 3 min. After exposure, place on a 135 °C hotplate for 4 min 30 sec, then cool to RT before proceeding to the next step.\nPlace the wafer on the spin coater and turn on the vacuum to affix it to the chuck. Apply 1 ml of SU8-3050 in the center of the wafer and spin for 20 sec at 500 rpm, then 30 sec at 1,000 rpm, resulting in a layer that provides an additional thickness of 100 µm.\nRemove the wafer and bake on a 135 °C hotplate for 30 min, then cool to RT before moving to the next step.\nAlign the 3rd layer mask onto the geometry patterned in 1.3 and expose the coated wafer to a collimated 190 mW, 365 nm LED for 3 min. After exposure, place on a 135 °C hotplate for 9 min, then cool to RT before proceeding to the next step.\nDevelop the masks by immersing in a stirred bath of propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate for 30 min. Wash the wafer in isopropanol and bake on a 135 °C hotplate for 1 min. Place the developed master in a 100 mm Petri dish for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molding.\n2. PDMS Device Fabrication\nPrepare 10:1 PDMS by combining 50 g of silicone base with 5 g of curing agent in a plastic cup. Mix the contents with a rotary tool fitted with a stir stick. Degas the mixture inside a desiccator for 30 min, or until all air bubbles are removed.",
    "Pour the PDMS to give a thickness of 3 mm over the master and place back into the desiccator for further degassing. Once all bubbles are removed, bake the device at 80 °C for 80 min.\nCut the device from the mold using a scalpel and place on a clean surface with the patterned side up and punch the fluidic inlets and outlets with a 0.75 mm biopsy punch. The device must be cut so that the 120 µm and 220 µm tall geometries are accessible from the side of the device.\nPlasma treat the device, with feature side up, along with a pre-cleaned 2 inches by 3 inches glass slide at 1 mbar O2 plasma for 20 sec in a 300 W plasma cleaner. Bond the PDMS device by placing the patterned side of the PDMS device onto the plasma-treated side of the glass slide. Place the device in a 80 °C oven and bake the assembled device for 40 min.\nRender the channels hydrophobic by using a syringe to flush the device with a fluorinated surface treatment fluid. Immediately bake the device at 80 °C for 10 min to evaporate the solvent.\n3. Preparation of Optical Components\nPrepare the laser excitation fiber by removing the insulation from the last 5 mm of a 105 µm core, 125 µm cladding, NA = 0.22 optical fiber.\nPrepare the 2nd color laser excitation fiber by repeating 3.1 for a 2nd identical fiber.\nPrepare the fiber for collecting the fluorescence signal by repeating 3.1 for a 200 µm core, 225 µm cladding, NA = 0.39 optical fiber.\nInspect the tips of all the fibers — if the tips do not end in a flat surface, re-cleave the ends with a fiber scribe.",
    "Attach a laser fiber coupler to a 50 mW, 405 nm laser and attach one of the 105 µm core fibers to the laser. Direct the stripped end at the sensor of the laser power meter, and use the fine adjustments of the laser coupler to maximize the laser power.\nRepeat 3.5 for a 50 mW, 473 nm laser.\nMount a 446/510/581/703 nm quad bandpass filters on the PMT using lens tubes to block laser light and transmit emitted fluorescence. Attach fiber coupler so that light travels through the filters before hitting the PMT.\nAttach the fiber from 3.3 to the unit assembled in 3.7.\n4. Offline Mixed Emulsion Generation\nObtain a flow focus microfluidics dropmaker device with a 60 µm x 60 µm orifice.\nFill a 1 ml syringe with HFE 7500 oils with 2% ionic fluorosurfactant 9.\nFill a series of 1 ml syringes with the following combinations of fluorescein (FITC) and dextran-conjugated blue dyes (CB) in PBS: 1 nM FITC/10 nM CB, 10 nM FITC/10 nM CB, 1 nM FITC/100 nM CB, and 10 nM FITC/100 nM CB.\nMount the dropmaker device on the stage of an inverted microscope and the aqueous and oil syringes on syringe pumps. Couple the syringes to the devices using PE-2 tubing.\nRunning syringe pumps at 500 µl/hr for the oil and 250 µl/hr for the aqueous solutions, create a mixture of 80 µm droplets containing the solutions from 4.3. For each type of aqueous sample, use a fresh dropmaker device to eliminate cross-contamination. Collect ~200 µl of emulsion from each dye combination into an empty syringe.\nAfter the 4 droplets types have been collected in a single collection syringe, mix the emulsion by repeatedly rotating the syringe.",
    "Repeat steps 4.2-4.6 with aqueous solutions containing 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nM FITC in PBS.\n5. Optical Fiber Insertion\nPlace the microfluidic chip fabricated in step 2 on the stage of an inverted microscope coupled with a digital camera capable of < 100 µsec shutter speeds.\nWorking carefully from the side, insert the fiber coupled to the 473 nm laser into the farthest upstream 120 µm channel, taking care not to puncture through to the main flow channel.\nInsert the fiber coupled to the 405 nm laser into the farthest downstream 120 µm high side channel, providing fiber spacing of 300 µm.\nInsert the PMT-coupled fiber into the 220 µm tall channel normal to the two laser excitation fibers.\n6. Fluorescence Detection of Mixed Emulsions \nMount a 5 ml syringe filled with HFE 7500 with 2% ionic fluorosurfactant to the spacer oil inlet of the detection device with PE-2 tubing.\nMount the syringe containing the mixed FITC/CB emulsion on a vertically oriented syringe pump and couple to the device's droplet reinjection inlet using PE-2 tubing. Connect a length of PE-2 tubing from the device exit to a waste container.\nPrime the device by running each of the pumps at 1,000 µl/hr until both oil and droplets are seen to be regularly combining in the device and flowing downstream.\nAdjust the flow rates such that the spacer oil runs at 6,000 µl/hr and the droplets at 100 µl/hr, providing significant spacing between droplets traveling through the detection region.\nTurn on the lasers, start the data acquisition program, and adjust the PMT gain to provide signals that are more than 100x the baseline noise floor. Adjust the laser power so that all of the doublet peaks are clearly visible on a single, linearly scaled timetrace.",
    "Acquire 60 sec of the PMT voltage timetrace at at least 20 kHz. Import the data into computing program such as Matlab and measure the heights of peaks of the recorded doublets using the custom computing program script.\n\tNOTE: This is provided as supplementary information.\nRepeat steps 6.2-6.7 using the FITC-only mixed emulsion created in 4.7, with the 405 nm laser turned off.\nSubscription Required.
