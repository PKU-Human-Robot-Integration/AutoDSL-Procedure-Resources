    "1. INS-1E Cells: Maintenance and Plating\nMaintain INS-1E cells in a humidified 37 ˚C/5% CO2 incubator and cultured with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin solution, 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol. Culture cells in 10 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium (per plate), until they reach 80 - 90% confluence, when they can be trypsinized and passaged or used for the insulin secretion assay.\nDay 1: Aspirate media and wash cells once with 5 mL of pre-warmed PBS. Add 0.5 mL of trypsin (0.025%) diluted 1:1 in 0.5 mL PBS to trypsinize the cells and incubate for 3 - 4 min at 37 ˚C. Deactivate trypsin by adding 9 mL complete media and transfer cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube by pipetting.\nPellet cells by centrifugation and re-suspend the cell pellet in approximately 5 mL fresh media.\nTake 10 µL of the re-suspended cells and mix with 10 µL Trypan Blue vital dye to check for cell viability. Count live and dead cells in 10 µL of this mixture using a hemocytometer. Viability level should be above 90%. Dilute the re-suspended cells in fresh media to 1 million cells per mL.\nSeed 0.5 mL INS-1E cells per well in a poly-L-Lysine pre-coated 24-well plate, at a density of 500,000 cells/well.\nDay 2: Remove media 18 - 24 h after plating and add 500 µL/well of fresh RPMI 1640 media. Incubate the cells for another 24 h to allow cells to fully recover from the prior passaging step. This additional time permits the cells to spread on the tissue culture plate.\n2. Insulin Secretion Assay (Day 3)",
    "Prepare KRB buffer: 132.2 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, and 0.001 g/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4.\nAspirate media from cells and wash twice with pre-warmed PBS.\nFor the glucose starvation step, add 450 µL/well KRB (containing BSA) without glucose for 1 h at 37 ˚C/5% CO2.\nDuring the glucose starvation step, prepare serial dilutions of the drug(s) in KRB containing 200 mM Glucose (10x concentration).\n\t\nPrepare drug at 10x the final concentration in KRB supplemented with 200 mM glucose (also 10x the final assay glucose concentration). If the drug stock (plus the added 10x glucose) is in DMSO, make sure DMSO percentage is kept consistent throughout the assay (ideally final percentage of less than 0.1% DMSO).\nFor dopamine and quinpirole treatments, use a final assay drug concentration range of 100 µM to 100 pM (from highest to lowest concentration), with the last point of the dose response containing no drug. For bromocriptine, use a final assay concentration range of 10 µM to 10 pM, with the last point of the dose response being the drug-free control.\nAfter glucose starvation, add drug serial dilutions to the assay to produce a dose response.\nAdd 50 µL/well of each serial dilution to the corresponding wells (total assay volume 500 µL).\nFor the glucose stimulation step, incubate cells with the respective drug serial dilutions (in the presence of 20 mM glucose) for 90 min at 37 ˚C/5% CO2. Include a set of control wells: (1) stimulation with 20 mM glucose alone in the absence of any additional drug and (2) cells that are neither stimulated with drug nor glucose (which provides a basal rate of secretion).",
    "After the stimulation step, carefully remove the supernatants (use directly or store at 4 ˚C).\n\tNOTE: An additional 5 min gentle centrifugation step (600 x g, 1 min) may be introduced at this point to remove any remaining cells in the assay supernatants.\n3. HTRF to Measure Insulin Secretion\nDilute assay supernatants 1:10 in KRB (without BSA), preferably in clear 96-well plates.\nPrepare the insulin standard curve for the HTRF insulin assay (Table 1).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nStandard stock solution 500 ng/ml,Serial dilutions,Working [insulin] ng/ml\nSTD 7,30 µl Stock + 140 µl KRB,150\nSTD 6,30 µl STD 7 + 45 µl KRB,60\nSTD 5,30 µl STD 6 + 45 µl KRB,24\nSTD 4,30 µl STD 5 + 45 µl KRB,9.6\nSTD 3,30 µl STD 4 + 45 µl KRB,3.84\nSTD 2,30 µl STD 3 + 45 µl KRB,1.54\nSTD 1,30 µl STD 2 + 45 µl KRB,0.61\nSTD 0,45 µl KRB,0\nNote: STD Stock is 500 ng/ml,Note: STD Stock is 500 ng/ml,Note: STD Stock is 500 ng/ml\nTable 1. Serial dilutions to make the insulin standard curve.\nAdd the standard curve samples and the diluted assay supernatants to the HTRF plate. The measurement of secreted insulin by HTRF can be carried out in either a 96-well or a 384-well plate format, keeping in mind that the assay volume has to be re-adjusted. Use 10 µL/well sample in 96-well white half-area plates or 5 µL/well in a 384-well white low-volume, round-bottom plate (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare antibody mix in detection buffer (see Table of Materials) in a 1:2 donor (cryptate)/acceptor (XL-665) ratio.\n\tNOTE: Further specific details about the HTRF assay are available from the manufacturer.\nAdd antibody mix to the assay at 30 µL/well (for a 96 well-plate assay format) or 15 µL/well (for a 384-well plate assay format).",
    "Seal the plate and incubate at room temperature.\nRead plate after 2 h, 4 h, and/or overnight incubation with antibodies using the plate reader and the appropriate HTRF optic module (337 665 620 nm) (see Table of Materials and manufacturer's instructions). Set the integration start at 60 µs and the integration time at 400 µs. Use 200 flashes per well.\n\tNOTE: These parameters were based on the use of our particular reader. The readout at 620 nm and 665 nm may vary between different instruments. This is one of the reasons we suggest using the 665/620 ratio. In calculating this ratio, any potential differences from reader to reader will be normalized and provide consistent values irrespective of the instrument used to measure HTRF.\n4. Data Analysis and Normalization\nCalculate the insulin concentrations of the assay wells via extrapolation of ratiometric fluorescence readings (665 nm/620 nm) to a second order quadratic polynomial curve (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57531/57531fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Insulin standard curve. Human insulin stock of known concentrations was used to generate the insulin standard curve. The resulting HTRF ratios (665 nm/ 620 nm) were plotted against the insulin concentrations. The data was best fit to a second order quadratic polynomial curve (R2 = 0.99996). This is a representative standard curve. Error bars = SEM.

Within the experiment, derived the individual R2 values from the intra-experimental duplicates, allowing calculation the standard error of the mean for the curve fit.",
    "For determining the interplate variation, use the data from at least three individual experiments to calculate the standard error of the mean for the R2 value of the collective curve.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
