    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTreatment with metronidazole (MTZ)\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step is key to inducing cell damage and extrusion in the epidermis. While NTR expression does not alter the physiological functions of epithelial cells, addition of the prodrug metronidazole (MTZ) leads to the production of a cytotoxic DNA intercalating agent that induces damage and cell extrusion.\nPrepare MTZ solution.\nAdd solution to larvae at a final concentration of 10 mM and pipet well to avoid MTZ crystallization at the bottom of the well.\nNote: For the study by (Atieh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), MTZ was usually added to 4 larvae at a time in a 6-well plate at final volumes of 50 μL of MTZ solution to 5 mL of E3 embyro medium. For a higher number of larvae, we found that MTZ was less efficient at inducing extrusion and damage.\nIncubate at 28°C for 2 h in the dark.\nNote: MTZ final concentration and incubation time can be adjusted depending on the amount of cellular extrusion desired for the particular experiment. Changing the MTZ concentration or incubation time determines the amount of cell extrusion induced (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F in (Atieh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/721-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of glass bottom dishes containing 4dpf zebrafish larvae mounted in low-melt agarose for imaging\n(A) Zebrafish larvae mounted in a glass bottom MatTek dish with one compartment. Scale bar, 5 mm.\n(B) Zebrafish larvae mounted in a glass bottom Greiner dish with 4 compartments. Scale bar, 5 mm.\nImmobilization and mounting of zebrafish larvae in agarose\nTiming: 5–10 min\nThis step is necessary to immobilize zebrafish larvae for time-lapse imaging. For additional information and a video tutorial on mounting larval zebrafish for imaging, please see (Eisenhoffer and Rosenblatt, 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nAdd 5–7 drops of tricaine/well to anesthetize larvae.",
    "Using a glass pipet, transfer the desired number of larvae in a dry 35 mm glass bottom dish and add a drop of tricaine to the dish for 10–20 s .\nNote: For simultaneous imaging of larvae in different drug conditions, 4-compartment glass bottom dishes can be used ( Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) (also see step 10).\nPipet any excess liquid around larvae and add 100 μL of 0.5% agarose (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for low melt agarose preparation).\nUnder a routine stereo microscope, center larvae in agarose so that they are all mounted in the same direction. Larvae should be mounted to clearly see both dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes, so that the edge of the tail appears flat (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nKeep repositioning larvae so that they remain completely flat until agarose starts solidify (this should take 1–2 min at most).\nWhen agarose is completely solidified (should become opaque), add a drop of tricaine and complete with 1 mL of E3.\nCritical: Larvae should be perfectly flat when agarose polymerizes especially for high resolution imaging. This will avoid acquiring thick z-stacks and will allow reducing the time interval between image frames acquired to capture both pulsatile contractions and extrusion events.\nTime-lapse confocal imaging\nTiming: varies depending on the desired time of acquisition (up to 10 h)\nAcquire Z-stack images using a laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with either a 20× air objective (0.8 μm/pixel) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) or a 40× water objective (0.18 μm/pixel) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) depending on the desired x-y resolution (X-Y dimensions 512 × 512 or 1024 × 1024). Depending on the area acquired (portion of the epithelium vs whole tail), reduce or increase z-step from 1 to 3 μm.",
    "For in-depth analysis of pulsing events, we recommend that the time-step does not exceed 30 s as pulses last on average between 1 and 2 min.\nFor acquisition of the whole tail fin epithelium using a 20× objective ( Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] A), top bottom and right margins of approximately 5 um will facilitate capture of extrusion events and prevent the tail from going out of frame due to pulsing and eventual whole tissue area reduction.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/721-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative examples of epithelial cells at different magnifications time-lapse imaging\n(A) Maximum intensity projection of epithelial cells in the tail fin using a 20× air objective (for multi-positional acquisition). Scale bar, 20 μm.\n(B) Maximum intensity projection of epithelial cells using a 40× water objective (for high-resolution acquisition). Scale bar, 20 μm.\nEpithelial cells express Nitroreductase (NTR-mCherry, shown in magenta) and Lifeact-EGFP (green).\nNote: If you decide to monitor multiple conditions simultaneously, acquire images at a 5 min interval using a 20× air objective in a 4-compartment glass bottom dish ( Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). This approach facilitates incubation of larvae with different pharmacological agents, before or during MTZ treatment and imaging.\nAlternatives: While the use of a laser-scanning confocal microscope is described, alternative microscopy platforms, such as spinning disk microscopy, are also compatible with this protocol. Potential limitations of these alternatives are discussed below.\nGenerate maximum intensity projections for all captured z-stack files (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nSave maximum intensity projections in 8-bit Tiff file format.\nQuantitative and statistical analyses\nMeasuring cell area using Tissue Analyzer\nFor a better familiarization with the Tissue Analyzer software, we suggest referring to (Aigouy et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] )",
    "In this step, we use the ImageJ plugin Tissue Analyzer to track cell area changes that occur following MTZ treatment, prior to extrusion. Tissue Analyzer allows tracking of cell area over time based on segmentation by junctional protein fluorescence.\nSplit the time-lapse Tiff file into individual images that represents each time point.\nOpen the Tissue Analyzer plugin in Fiji and drag image sequences into the “Image List” box.\nIn the “Segmentation” section, click “Detect Bonds” and set parameters.\nNote: We advise starting with “Detect Bonds Preview Only” as this will quickly process the first image of the sequence and give an idea of what the segmentation will look like. Here, you can adjust parameters such as the minimum size of desired detected cells.\nOnce the parameters look correct, you can process all images at once by clicking “Detect Bonds (save watershed)”. This will automatically generate segmented images of epithelial cells (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nNote: For the study by (Atieh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), strong and weak blurs were set at 10 and 1 respectively and cell size was set to be detected at a minimum of 15 pixels.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/721-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell area analysis using Tissue Analyzer\n(A) Cell-cell Bond detection after correction.\n(B) Segmented processed image.\n(C) Scatter dot graph representing a single cell example of the area fluctuation overtime of an epithelial cell.\nIf mistakes in cell-cell junction detection are still present, you can manually correct them by either removing (right click over the junction) or adding (left click to draw junction) junctions.\nNote: In the case of manual correction being performed, do not forget to hit the “save” button in the bottom right side of the software before moving on to the next image.",
    "After all image sequences have been verified, process the segmentation in the “PostProcess” section by clicking “Finish all”.\nGo to the “Plots” section to generate an excel sheet containing quantified parameters (i.e., cell area, cell perimeter,… etc).\nIn (Atieh et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), we tracked single cell areas over time (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Retrospective analysis can facilitate assignment as extruding cells, neighboring cells and non-extruding cells. In order to generate single plots averaging multiple pulses, align pulses by overlapping minimal area values.\nCritical: For images containing many epithelial cells, Tissue Analyzer assigns cell ID numbers for each frame. Cell IDs are however different for every frame so we recommend quantifying a total of 1 to 6 cells at a time to ensure accurate tracking, especially when analyzing a significant amount of time-frames.\nMeasuring cell contraction and expansion using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)\nFor a better familiarization with the PIVlab software, we suggest referring to (Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). A detailed video to walk you through the PIV lab software is also available on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp3Ounq07Qc[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp3Ounq07Qc]\nSpilt Tiff file into image sequences.\nLoad image sequences in PIVlab. Add and import images. For this protocol, the sequencing style used was 1-2,2-3,3-4,…\nIn the “Analyses settings” section, start by selecting the region of interest that will be analyzed in Exclusion (ROI, Mask).\nNote: PIV does not ignore non-fluorescent parts of the image. Therefore, be sure to exclude any cells that are not fluorescently tagged (which can be the case for the zebrafish epithelial Gal4-UAS lines).\nAdjust image fluorescence in the “Image pre-processing” section.\nNote: For this protocol, we applied the CLAHE, highpass and denoise filters .\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/721-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Tissue flow analysis using PIVlab\n(A) Setting passes and interrogation windows.\n(B) PIV analysis after selection of velocity limits.",
    "(C) Convergence/Divergence (i.e., cellular contraction/expansion) colormap as generated by the software.\nIn the PIV settings section, we applied four passes: 128 × 128, 64 × 64, 32 × 32, and 16 × 16 pixel-size interrogation window with 50% overlap each ( Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nAt this point, images can then be analyzed in the “Analysis” section.\nOnce analysis is completed for all frames (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), calibrate your images by inserting the time interval and the scale of your acquisition in the “Calibration” section.\nIf you find some mistakes in the analysis (i.e., out of range arrows), you can correct them in the “Post-processing” section by selecting velocity limits .\nFor plot generation, you can choose the type of measurements performed (velocity magnitude, divergence,…) in “Plots → Derive parameters/modify data”.\nFor plot appearance, heatmaps and scale bars can be adjusted in “Plots → Modify plot appearance” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nFor getting numerical values of measurements go to “Extractions → Parameters from area”. The software will prompt you to draw the area you wish to get measurements from.\nMeasurements will automatically be saved as text files and movies can be saved as AVI files."
