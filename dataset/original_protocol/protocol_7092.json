    "EC cultureThaw cryopreserved ECs at 37°C in a water bath, and transfer the cells to a Falcon tube containing 10 mL of complete EGM. Then, directly transfer the cell suspension to a 75 cm2 flask, and place it in the incubator at 37°C.Once the cells have adhered to the flask (~4 h-6 h later), discard the medium to remove traces of DMSO, and add 10 mL of fresh medium.Change the medium every 2-3 days and, once confluent, detach ECs with 1 mL of Accutase at 37°C for 5 min.Add 10 mL of complete EGM, collect the cell suspension, and transfer it to a Falcon tube. Centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 1-2 mL of complete EGM. Count and replate ECs.Note: For “faster” passaging, seed 8,000-10,000 cells/cm2. Use Ecs for functional assays between passages 4 and 6 only.Plate Ecs at 80% confluency in a 24-well plate (~100,000 cells/well) in 500 µL of complete EGM.EC pre-treatment(s)Once the cells are adherent, remove the medium, and wash ECs with 1 mL of PBS 1×.Incubate ECs with the following culture conditions:Negative control: 500 µL of complete EGM only.Positive control: 500 µL of complete EGM containing 20 ng/mL of TNF.Note: TNF is very well known for being a cytokine that can strongly upregulate the expression of E-Selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 adhesion molecules on ECs in vitro, thus representing a robust positive control. Experimental setting: 500 µL of complete EGM containing ILCPs, at 1:1 ratio.Note: This protocol can be adapted to any immune cell type of interest and ratios can be adjusted. Please refer to Vanoni et al. (2021) for more details regarding ILCP isolation and culture. Incubate Ecs for 3h at 37°C.",
    "After 3 h, discard the supernatant, and perform two washing steps with PBS 1×.Detach ECs by adding 150 µL of Accutase and incubate at 37°C during 5 min.Add 1 mL of complete EGM. Transfer the cell suspension to a 5 mL round bottom tube, and wash with 3 mL of PBS 1×.Centrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.EC sortingNote: This section is not necessary if you do not incubate ECs with other cell types before performing the static adhesion assay. From Step B7, you can directly go to Step D1. Remove the supernatant, and stain ECs with FITC anti-human CD31 antibody in 50 µL of Sorting Buffer. Incubate for 20 min at RT in the dark.Wash the cells by adding 1 mL of PBS 1×, and centrifuge at 200 × g during 5 min at RT.Resuspend the cells in 500 µL of sorting buffer and proceed with the sorting, according to the manufacturer’s instructions and by following the gating strategy shown below (Figure 1). Collect the cells in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 500 µL of complete EGM.Centrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 5 min, and replate them in a 48-well flat bottom plate in 250 µL of complete EGM. Leave overnight at 37°C, or wait until the cells are adherent.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4276/bioprotoc-12-01-4276-g001.jpgFigure 1. Gating strategy to enrich CD31+ ECs. Following 3 h incubation with ILCPs, CD31+ ECs have to be sorted, in order to perform the static adhesion assay without any contaminating CD31- ILCPs. As shown in the SSC-A vs. FITC-A dotplot in panel B, ILCPs themselves adhered to ECs during the in vitro co-culture.",
    "To make ECs go through the same steps, also untreated (CTRL) or TNF-treated ECs (not shown) have to be sorted (examples of unstimulated and TNF-stimulated ECs are shown in Figures 2A and 2B, respectively).Isolation of PBMCs from fresh bloodIn parallel, in a 50 mL Falcon tube, dispense 12 mL of 1.077 g/mL Ficoll-Hypaque.In another 50 mL Falcon tube, transfer the 9 mL of blood, and add 9 mL of PBS 1×.Gently transfer the 18 mL of PBS-diluted fresh blood over the Ficoll-Hypaque solution, being careful to not mix them.Centrifuge at 650 × g during 20 min at RT, without brake (acceleration/deceleration rate of 9/0).Harvest the PBMC layer, and transfer it to a new 50 mL Falcon tube.Wash the PBMCs with PBS 1×, by filling up to 50 mL.Centrifuge at 450 × g during 5 min at RT, with brake (9/9).Remove the supernatant, and perform a second wash, by filling up to 40 mL.Centrifuge at 200 × g during 10 min at RT, without brake (9/0).Note: This step will allow platelet removal. Remove the supernatant and incubate the cell pellet with 500 µL of RBC lysis buffer during 5 min at 37°C.Wash the PBMCs with PBS 1×, by filling up to 50 mL.Centrifuge at 450 × g during 5 min at RT, with brake (9/9).Resuspend the cells in culture medium and perform cell counting.Static adhesion assayNote: In the original protocol from Safuan et al. (2021), the static adhesion assay lasted 5 min. By performing a kinetic experiment, we observed that 30 min is an optimal incubation period, that allows specific adhesion events to take place. The day after/once ECs have adhered, discard the supernatant and wash the cells with 500 µL of PBS 1×.",
    "Add freshly isolated PBMCs at 1:4 ratio (EC:PBMC) to each well, for 30 min at 37°C in a final volume of 200 µL of complete EGM.After 30 min, discard the supernatant from the wells.Perform two washing steps with 500 µL of PBS 1×, to ensure removal of non-adherent cells from the EC monolayer.Detach ECs, together with adherent PBMCs, by incubating them with 200 µL of Accutase at 37°C for 5 min.Add 1 mL of complete EGM. Transfer the cell suspension to a 5 mL round bottom tube and wash with 3 mL of PBS 1×.Centrifuge the cells at 200 × g during 5 min at RT.Stain the cells using 50 µL of FACS Buffer, for 20 min at RT in the dark, with the antibodies diluted as listed in the Materials and Reagents – Flow Cytometry Antibodies section.In the meantime, let the CountBright Absolute Counting Beads equilibrate at RT.Wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS 1× and centrifuge at 450 × g during 5 min at RT, with brake (9/9).Resuspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of FACS buffer.After having set up the flow cytometer, add 20 µL of well vortexed (30”) CountBright Absolute Counting Beads to the samples, just before acquiring them.Set stopping gate ‘beads’ at 2000 recorded events."
