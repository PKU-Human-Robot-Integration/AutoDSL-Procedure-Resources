    "The study was approved by the ethical committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, China17.\n1. Informed Consent\nObtain the patient's informed consent after explaining the details of the surgical procedure, postoperative prognosis, and possible complications (infection, epidural hematoma, spinal cord injury, failure of internal fixation, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage).\nExplain the other risks generally associated with using an implant (e.g., internal fixation system) such as allergic or immune system responses to the implanted materials.\nRule out any contraindications of the patients.\n2. Patient selection\nDiagnosis of BS\n\t\nBase the initial diagnosis of BS on the clinical manifestations and radiographic assessments8.\n\t\t\nLook for clinical manifestations and symptoms such as back pain, undulant fever, malaise, profuse night sweating, weight loss, polyarthralgia, and generalized myalgias8,18.\nIn plain radiographs, look for osteophytes, sclerosis, osteoporosis of the vertebral body, and narrowing of the intervertebral disc space, with posterior elements being mostly preserved.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Central necrosis is mostly not present, and the vertebral body is mostly morphologically intact (Figure 1)18.\nIn computed tomography (CT), look for small bone destruction lesions at vertebral edges that occur in multiple areas, and for hyperplastic and sclerotic lesions that are more prominent and often admixed (Figure 1)18.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: CT features are divided into those of vertebral osteolysis and vertebral hyperplastic sclerosis stages19.\nAs magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging tool for BS diagnosis (Figure 1)20,21,22, look for characteristic MRI findings that can be classified into five subsets: discitis, spondylitis, paraspinal/psoas abscess, appendicitis, and compound (Table 1).\nConfirm the diagnosis according to the presence of the following three criteria23:\n\t\t\nEnsure that the clinical picture is compatible with that of BS.\nConfirm the absence of any etiology other than Brucellosis that can explain spinal involvement.",
    "Confirm that the results of the standard tube agglutination test reveal a titer of antibodies to Brucella of ≥ 1/16024.\nIndications for surgery23\nLook for persistent pain due to spinal instability, which is caused by severe disc or/and vertebral destruction.\nConfirm severe or progressive neurologic dysfunction that can be attributed to nerve root compression by inflammatory granuloma or epidural abscesses.\nConfirm that there is no response to oral antibiotic therapy (e.g., doxycycline, rifampicin, streptomycin).\n3. Preoperative procedure\nAdminister a chemotherapy regimen (oral doxycycline 200 mg/day plus oral rifampicin 600-900 mg/day)25 to all patients.\nOffer surgical interventions to patients who have surgical indications after two weeks of antibiotic treatment.\n4. Operative procedures for single-stage transforaminal decompression, debridement, interbody fusion, and internal fixation via posterior-only approach\nPlace the patient on a four-poster frame in the prone position after administration of general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.\nDisinfect the surgical area with 1% iodophor, and then cover with standard surgical towels (see Table of Materials).\nMake a midline longitudinal incision over the spinous process of the infected vertebra.\nExpose the posterior spinal structures including lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.\nPlace the pedicle screws (diameter: 5-7 mm, length: 20-65 mm) into both sides of the affected vertebra with the assistance of C-arm fluoroscopy26,27,28 (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: To achieve adequate debridement, place the pedicle screws closest to the superior or inferior endplate and away from the infection lesions. Fix the screws to a temporary rod (diameter: 5.5 mm) on the less involved side (see Table of Materials).\nPerform the facetectomy at the involved level on the side where neurologic and radiological manifestations are more severe29.\nDebride the epidural abscess, granulation tissues, infected disc with curettes, and scrape the vertebral endplates. Meanwhile, protect the nerve root with a nerve retractor (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: Perform a blunt dissention to adequately drain the psoas abscess from the posterolateral as thoroughly as possible. Analyze the tissues and abscess histopathologically30,31. Noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with predominant lymphocyte and monocytes infiltration is the typical histopathologic finding of BS32. If the result of decompression and debridement is not satisfactory after a unilateral facetectomy, perform the same procedure on the opposite side.\nAfter adequately removing the lesions and decompressing the neural elements, use 1000-2000 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution for surgical area irrigation to clear the residual Brucellar lesion (see Table of Materials).\nSaturate an absorbable gelatin sponge (60 mm x 20 mm x 5 mm) with 0.75-1.5 g of streptomycin, and use it for both hemostasis and local antibiotic treatment within the surgical area (see Table of Materials).\nImplant the locally harvested autogenous bone into the defected space for interbody fusion with a bone graft funnel and bone pusher (see Table of Materials).\nFix pedicle screws (diameter: 5-7 mm, length: 20-65 mm) on both sides to the pre-contoured rods (diameter: 5.5 mm) under a slight compression33,34 (see Table of Materials).\nDrain and close the lesion35 (see Table of Materials).\n5. Postoperative management\nAdminister intravenous antibiotic (cefuroxime sodium, 1.5 g, q12h) for 1-3 days postoperatively.\nRemove the drainage tube when the drainage volume is less than 30 mL per day.\nAdminister the aforementioned antibiotic therapies with doxycycline (200 mg/day) and rifampicin (600-900 mg/day) for at least 3 months (range 3-12 months) after surgery.\nEnsure the patient remains in bed for 3-5 days postoperatively, and allow for mobilization by providing effective support with a lumbosacral brace.\nPerform plain radiography before the patient's discharge to evaluate the location of the graft and instrumentation.\nEnsure at least 2-3 months of brace protection.\n6. Follow-up evaluation",
    "Follow up with the patients at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively and then annually.\nMonitor the infection by measuring erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).\nEvaluate interbody fusion by radiography at the last follow-up.\n\tNOTE: Assess graft fusion with the radiologic criteria of Bridwell36. Perform CT scans if there is any uncertainty regarding plain radiographs.\nUtilize the visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess back pain.\nEvaluate pain-related dysfunction with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).\nUse the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scale to evaluate the functional outcomes.\nSubscription Required.
