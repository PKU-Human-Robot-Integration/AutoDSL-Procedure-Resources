    "1. Login\nPower up the Bioreactor. Click anywhere to open the login page. Select user name and enter password and click “Login”.\n2. Calibration\nCalibrate pH sensor (2 point prior to autoclaving).\nInspect pH sensor and confirm sensor tip is filled with electrolyte solution. Prepare two beakers with pH calibration solutions (electrolyte) pH 4 and pH 7 and have available a wash bottle with distilled water.\nConnect the pH cable to the pH sensor. Navigate to the “Actions” tab on the Hello interface and click “calibrate”. Enter buffer temperature in the Calibration Solution Temp field.\nPlace pH sensor in buffer 1 (pH 4) and enter value in the “zero” field. Wait for the graph to stabilize and the click the “calibrate 1” button. Rinse the pH sensor with distilled water.\nPlace sensor in buffer 2 (pH 7). Enter buffer 2 value in the “span” field. Wait for graph to stabilize and click calibrate 2 button.\nClick “Save” then click “Close”.\nCalibrate the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) sensor.\nEnsure the DO sensor has been polarized by being connected to the system for several hours. Navigate to the “Actions” tab on the Hello interface and click calibrate. Click the “DO A” button.\nDisconnect the DO sensor and enter 0 in the “zero” field. Wait for the graph to stabilize and the click the “Calibrate 1” button.\nReconnect the DO sensor and enter 100 in the “Span” field. Wait for the graph to stabilize and the click the “Calibrate 2” button.\nClick “Save” then click “close”.\n3. Autoclave and Install Sensors and Reagent Vessels\nAfter calibration, place sensors and thermal well in autoclave pouches and autoclave for 30 min at 121 °C, 15 psi.",
    "Sanitize autoclave pouches with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) and transfer pouches to biological safety cabinet (BSC). Remove outer packaging of vessel.\nSanitize inner packaging with 70% IPA and transfer vessel to biological safety cabinet (BSC). Remove inner packaging and inspect the vessel and tubing for damage inflicted during shipping.\nInstall the pH and DO sensors in the two front ports. Install the thermal well to the left back port. Open the sensor cap.\nGuide the sensor through the sensor port. Thread the sensor tightly into the port.\nTransfer vessel out of BSC.\nHang the DO and pH sensor cables outside the vessel sleeve and check that nothing is in the sleeve. Slide the vessel into the sleeve, feet first.\nCarefully fit the temperature sensor into the vessel thermal well. Ensure that the bottom of the vessel rests against the heaters.\nRemove the tubing sets from their bags. Match color coding on the tubing to the corresponding connectors and pumps on the bioreactor control unit.\nInstall the main gas line by pressing the connector into its gas outlet. Install the micro gas line by twisting the connector clockwise into the gas outlet. Install the exhaust filter tubing:\nOpen the filter oven. Secure the exhaust filter on the U-channel so its tubing goes through the two hooks to the filter and out of the oven.\nInstall the tubing by condenser bag in the tubing holder. Close the door.\nRoute addition lines A and B, both media lines, and the harvest line behind the DO sensor and onto the bench next to the bioreactor control unit.\nConnect the cables to the DO and pH sensors.\n4. Adding Medium and Micro-carriers\nNavigate to the “actions” tab and click “Control Pumps” on the computer interface.",
    "Form a sterile connection between an unused medium addition line (1 orange band) and the medium bottle/bag source by welding the tubing or using Luer fittings.\nClick the slider to turn on the media pump on. Click the slider to turn the media pump off after addition desired amount of medium.\nPlace microcarrier beads in Ca2+, Mg2+ free PBS for 3 hr at RT.\nWash beads several times with Ca2+, Mg2+ free PBS.\nAutoclave for 15 min at 115 °C, 15 psi.\n\tNOTE: Add 3 g/L (dry weight) in this experiment.\nPump in micro-carriers that have been hydrated, washed and autoclaved into the reactor in the same manner the medium was added in step 4.1.\n5. Equilibration and One-point DO Calibration\nSet the controllers to Auto and enter the desired setpoints. Here, use Agitation Set Point (SP) = 15 rpm, Temperature SP = 37.0 °C, pH = 7.2, DO = 100%. Wait for the parameters to equilibrate.\nConfirm sensor is fully polarized. Confirm DO present value has stabilized.\nNavigate to the “Actions” tab and click “calibrate”. Click “DO A”, click “One-point”.\nEnter ‘100’ in the “Span” field. Click the “Calibrate 1” button, click “Save” and click “close”:\n6. Starting a Run\nNavigate to the Actions tab. Click “Batch.” Use the on-screen keyboard or an external keyboard to enter a batch name 16 characters or less.\nClick the on-screen keyboard’s “Hide” button. Click the “Start batch” confirm by clicking “Start” in the overlay.\n7. Inoculate with Cells\nForm a sterile connection between an unused medium addition line (1 orange band) and the cell bottle/bag source by welding the tubing or using the Luer fittings.\nInstall the silicone section of the tubing in the media pump so the arrow points toward the tubing between the pump and vessel.",
    "Check tubing clamp is open and its branched tubing clamp is closed. Click the slider to turn the media pump on and click to “Off” after adding cells.\nNavigate to the “Actions” tab and click “Control Pumps”.\n8. Sampling\nAfter inoculating and as frequently as desired to monitor the culture, draw a sample from the culture in the following manner:\nNavigate to the “actions” tab and click “take sample”. Place the sampling tubing in the sampling pump and manipulate the sampling stopcock according to the on-screen instructions.\nPerform at least a daily microscopic observation and cell count on these samples.\nWhen the cells have reached the desired density, in this case 1.2 x 106 cells/ml, infect the cells with the addition of a virus inoculum.\nAseptically add the inoculum to a 20 ml syringe, and connect the syringe to one of the spare addition ports on the reactor. Introduce the inoculum to the reactor by pressing on the syringe plunger.\nContinue sampling and analyzing the culture for the adenovirus intracellular particle concentration."
