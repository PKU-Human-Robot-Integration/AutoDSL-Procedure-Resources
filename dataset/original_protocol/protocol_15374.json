    "All procedures described are conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals in research and all animal protocols were approved by the Oregon Health & Science University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Surgical Preparation\nWeigh the mouse.  The procedure described is performed on C57BL/6 mice weighing between 20 and 25 g.  Anesthesia is induced in an induction box using 3-4% \n isoflurane, and subsequently maintained using 1.5-2.5% isoflurane in air/oxygen mixture.\nLubricate the eyes and position the animal supine on a heating pad.  Immobilize 4 extremities using tape.  The hind-paws may be taped in a neutral position, \n however, the forepaws should be secured as near to the chest wall as possible to allow full chest wall excursion during chest compressions.\nLubricate and place a rectal temperature probe.  Temperature is controlled using a heating pad and lamp connected to an electronic temperature controller \n (Digi-Sense, Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills IL), which is set to maintain 37.0°C.  Because it is possible that a temperature gradient within the animal could develop \n during the no-flow state, it is important that temperature be measured and controlled near the organ of interest.\nIntubate the trachea using a 2.5 cm 22 ga teflon catheter (Insyte-W, BD, Franklin NJ) and the cut distal end of an angled introducer (Frova Introducer, Cook Medical, \n Bloomington IN).  Other methods of tracheal intubation are acceptable, however, use of the angled introducer allows proper positioning of the neck in a slightly \n extended position, which optimizes surgical exposure for placement of the intravenous catheter.  The endotracheal catheter hub is secured with a loop of suture to \n the incisor and maintained with slight tension to immobilize the head during chest compressions.",
    "Mechanically ventilate the mouse with a rodent ventilator set to 140 μL, 150 breaths/minute.  This is not adjusted for weight as this protocol is always \n performed in 20-25 g animals.  Do not over-deepen anesthesia.  Do not set the ventilator to apply end expiratory pressure as this impairs resuscitation.\nUsing sterile technique and an operating microscope, place a pre-flushed PE-10 catheter in the jugular vein.  Either side may be used, but use of the \n side closest to the operator reduces the chance of catheter dislodgement during chest compressions or other manipulations. 0.5% bupivicaine, 0.1 mL is infitrated into wound edges to control postoperative pain.\nSecure the PE-10 catheter into the skin closure with cyanoacrylate surgical adhesive.\nPlace subcutaneous EKG electrodes and connect to monitoring device.   Careful attention to the signal path and maximization of the signal itself is \n critical to the success of resuscitation.  Ensure that all wires are secured to the operating surface, minimize signal crossings, and minimize insulators \n (like air in hollow needles or stranded wire) within the signal path.  Solid needles connected to nonstranded lead wire may be purchased or made in the lab.  \n Once connected, optimize the EKG signal on the monitor.\n2. Cardiac Arrest\nEnsure that the mouse is normothermic, defined as rectal temperature 36.5°C - 37.5°C.  Administer 40 μL of room temperature 0.5 M potassium chloride \n intravenously and observe isoelectric tracing on EKG.  Dose adjustment for weight is not necessary within the range 20-25 g.  Start arrest timer.\nDisconnect the ventilator.  Discontinue the anesthetic vapor.  Turn off the heating pad and any other equipment which produces electronic noise that may interfere with EKG monitoring.  Place an insulating blanket over the mouse.",
    "Record temperature every minute during cardiac arrest.  If necessary, a heating lamp may be used to bring core temperature up to the normothermic range. During cardiac arrest, prepare supplies and equipment (for example, the epinephrine syringe) for resuscitation.  A checklist can be helpful to ensure uninterrupted resuscitation, which is essential for survival.\nAfter 7 minutes, 30 seconds of cardiac arrest, reconnect the ventilator and increase the rate to 180 breaths/min, keeping the tidal volume at the pre-arrest setting.\nAt 8 minutes, initiate chest compressions at 300 BPM.  Motion artifact on the EKG can be used to judge CPR rate.  Chest compressions should be delivered with the index finger, 5 mm above the xiphoid process and slightly to the left of midline.  The chest should be compressed 1/3-1/2 of the anteroposterior distance and full recoil must be allowed between compressions.  Finger positioning and optimal compression pressure are absolutely critical.  Failure to achieve survival in this model is almost always due to suboptimal CPR.\nInfuse 0.5 mL of epinephrine, diluted to 15 μg/mL, in the first 30 seconds of CPR.  Total epinephrine dose is 8-12 μg.  Carefully observe the EKG for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).  Narrow complex QRS complexes are seen between compression artifacts.  ROSC usually occurs between 90 seconds and 2 minutes after starting CPR.  Resuscitation is abandoned if ROSC does not occur by 3 minutes. Frequent premature ventricular contractions and changes in EKG axis are observed in the first 2 minutes after ROSC, and almost always resolve into steady sinus tachycardia at 2 minutes.\nRecord total time of resuscitation and epinephrine dose.  Record temperature every minute for 10 minutes after ROSC.\nEKG leads can be removed when spontaneous respiration begins, usually within 12-15 minutes after ROSC.\nExtubate the trachea when spontaneous respiratory rate is >60/min.",
    "Place the mouse in a recovery cage on a temperature controlled surface set to 37°C for the first 2 hours postprocedure, ensuring easy access to food and water. The cage may then be moved to standard postoperative housing conditions when the mouse has completely recovered from anesthesia and is active.\n3. Exsanguination/Perfusion-Fixation and Kidney Harvest\n24h after CA/CPR, induce anesthesia with isoflurane 3-4% and secure the animal in the supine position on a surgical surface within a fume hood which is appropriate for use with formalin..\nDeepen the anesthetic by gradually increasing the anesthetic vapor concentration to 5% and ensure the mouse is deeply anesthetized as evidenced by cessation of spontaneous respiration.\nPerform a clamshell thoracotomy and exsanguinate the mouse via apical puncture of the cardiac left ventricle according to standard techniques.\nVia the same needle, administer 0.9% saline by slow infusion.  To acclerate perfusion/exsanguination, nick the right atrial appendage with scissors.  Perform a laparotomy and observe the kidneys.  When they are blanched, saline may be changed to 4% formalin for fixation.  Kidneys are then embedded in paraffin and stained with Fluoro-jade B for quantification of tubular epithelial necrosis.\n4. Representative Results:\nWhen CA is induced, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and regional renal blood flow (RRBCF) drop to near zero and remain stable until \nresuscitation begins (Figure 1).  24h after CA/CPR, serum indices of renal function (blood urea nitrogen, BUN and creatinine) are significantly \nelevated relative to sham-operated animals.  AST/ALT are also elevated, offering evidence of profound whole-body ischemia (Figure 2).   Neutrophil-gelatinase \nassociated lipocalin (NGAL), a sensitive indicator of renal ischemic injury is massively upregulated 24h after CA/CPR (Figure 3).  Finally, photomicrographs \ndemonstrate the patchy, medullary necrosis typical of ischemic renal injury with thinning of tubular epithelium and luminal filling on hematoxylin and eosin stain",

Cardiac arrest induces instant loss of perfusion pressure, represented here as mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured in the femoral artery, \nresulting in near-complete cessation of regional renal cortical blood flow (RRCBF) throughout the period of cardiac arrest (shaded area).  Resuscitation with chest \ncompressions and epinephrine returns MAP to normal and RRCBF steadily rises in the post resuscitation period.

CA/CPR induces a pan-organismal ischemic insult, \nhere evidenced by massive elevation of liver-function enzymes alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in CA/CPR mice as \ncompared with sham-treated animals.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3116/3116fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Urine samples were obtained immediately prior to (“pre”) and 24h after (“24h”) CA/CPR in 4 animals (labeled a, b, c, and d above).  NGAL is \nmassively upregulated in mouse urine after CA/CPR.

These findings are substantially similar to renal biopsy findings from humans who develop AKI, and unlike those produced by other animal models of AKI.Subscription Required.
