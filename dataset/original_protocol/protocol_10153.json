    "1. Preparation\nMake Lysogeny broth (LB) agar and pour plates12.\nTransform BL21(DE3) with a pET28 plasmid containing the wtQβ coat protein sequence.\nThaw E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells in an ice bath. Place 50 μL of cells in a microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 2 μL of plasmid into one tube and gently flick the tube. Then incubate on ice for 30 min.\nHeat-shock the cells for 45 s in a water bath that is at exactly 42 °C. Place the tube back in the ice bath immediately after heat-shocking, and incubate for 5 min.\nAdd 950 μL of LB media that does not contain any antibiotic.\nShake the culture at 200 rpm for 60 min at 37 °C.\nPlate 100 μL of the culture on LB agar plates (with Kanamycin) and incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C. Select white colonies when needed.\nMake Super Optimal Broth (SOB) media.\nAutoclave two 2 L baffled Erlenmeyer flasks on a superdry cycle.\nIn an aseptic environment, weigh out and add 20.0 g of tryptone, 5.0 g of yeast extract, 2.469 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, 0.584 g of sodium chloride and 0.186 g of potassium chloride to each flask.\nBring the volume to 1 L with ultrapure water in each flask and autoclave on the liquid cycle.\nOnce the SOB media has reached room temperature after autoclaving, add 1 mL of kanamycin (100 mg/mL) to each liter of media and store at 4 °C.\nMake 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.00).\nMake 1 M potassium monobasic solution by dissolving 68.045 g of potassium monobasic in 500 mL of ultrapure water.\nMake 1 M potassium dibasic solution by dissolving 87.09 g of potassium dibasic in 500 mL of ultrapure water.",
    "Add 38.5 mL of potassium monobasic solution and 61.5 mL of potassium dibasic to a 1 L bottle.\nAdjust pH to 7.00 if needed, and bring to a volume of 1 L.\nMake 5–40% sucrose gradients in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.00).\nIn 50 mL centrifuge tubes, prepare solutions with 5–40% (increasing in increments of 5%) sucrose dissolved in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.00).\nDeposit 3.3 mL of 5% sucrose solution at the bottom of a 38 mL round-bottom polycarbonate tube using a long needle syringe and repeat this for five other tubes.\nCarefully deposit 3.3 mL of 10% sucrose solution at the bottom of the tube, and carefully remove the needle as to not disturb the gradient. Repeat for the other five tubes.\n\t\t \nContinue to deposit 3.3 mL layers of sucrose solutions, increasing from 15% to 40% in each tube, while being cautious to not disturb the gradient.\nWhen complete, cover the tops of the gradients with foil and store at -80 °C.\n2. Expression of Qβ\nWipe bench area with 1:1 bleach/ethanol.\nMake two 3 mL starter cultures in an aseptic environment by adding single colonies of E. coli BL21(DE3) into 3 mL of SOB media in an aseptic environment.\nGrow on a shaker at 250 rpm in a 37 °C and 0% relative humidity (rH) room overnight.\nInoculate starter culture in SOB media:\nTake both 3 mL starter cultures off the shaker and, in an aseptic environment, pour each starter culture into one of two 2 L baffled Erlenmeyer flasks with 1 L of fresh SOB media in each.\nPlace the inoculated media on a shaker at 250 rpm in a 37 °C and 0% rH room.",
    "Grow the bacteria on a shaker at 250 rpm in a 37 °C and 0% rH room until OD600 reaches 0.9–1.0.\nAdd 1 mL of 1 M isopropyl β-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) using a P1000 pipette to induce protein expression.\nLeave the media on the shaker at 250 rpm in a 37 °C and 0% rH room overnight. \nRemove media from the shaker the following morning and centrifuge it using 1000 mL bottles at 20,621 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to harvest the cells.\nDiscard the supernatant and collect the cell pellet.\nPour the supernatant into a flask with about 5 mL of bleach to kill bacteria. This is waste.\nUse a spatula to scrape the cell pellet from the bottom of the centrifuge bottle and put the pellet into a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\n3. Purification of Qβ\nResuspend the cell pellet with ~20–30 mL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.00).\nMake sure the resuspension has no chunks, and lyse the cells using a microfluidizer processor according to manufacturer’s protocol (see Table of Materials). Lyse the cells at least twice to increase the yield of the particles.\nCentrifuge the lysate in 250 mL centrifuge bottles at 20,621 x g for 1 hr at 4 °C.\nDiscard the pellet and measure the volume of supernatant in mL. Multiply that value by 0.265 and add that amount of g of ammonium sulfate to the supernatant.\nStir at 4  °C for at least 1 h on a stir plate at 200 rpm to precipitate out the protein.\nCentrifuge in 250 mL bottles at 20,621 x g for 1 h at 4 °C.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the pellet with about 10 mL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.00).",
    "Add equal volumes of 1:1 chloroform/n-butanol to the crude sample and mix by vortexing for a few seconds.\nCentrifuge in 38 mL tubes at 20,621 × g for 30 minutes at 4 °C.\nRecover the top aqueous layer using a Pasteur pipette. Be cautious not to take any of the gel like layer that has formed between the aqueous and organic layer.\nThaw six 5–40% pre-made sucrose gradients and load about 2 mL of the extract onto each.\nUltracentrifuge at 99,582 x g for 16 h at 4 °C with free deceleration.\nShine a light emitting diode (LED) light under each tube and a blue band should become visible. Recover these particles with a long needle syringe.\nUltrapellet the particles at 370,541 x g for 2.5 h at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the transparent pellet of purified particles with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.00).\n4. Quantification and Confirmation of the Product\nUse Bradford Assay to quantify the product13.\nRun reducing and non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to confirm the product14.\n\tNOTE: Reducing SDS-PAGE is used to confirm the molecular weight of coat protein; non-reducing SDS-PAGE is to confirm the higher order structure.\n5. Conjugating DB Compounds on Qβ\nReduce disulfides on Qβ.\nDissolve 0.0020 g of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) into 1 mL of ultrapure water to make a 100x stock solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare fresh TCEP before reduction.\nAdd 200 µL of Qβ (5 mg/mL) into a microcentrifuge tube.\nFollow by adding 20 µL of 100x TCEP stock solution.\nIncubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nRe-bridge reduced disulfide using dibromomaleimide polyethylene glycol (DB-PEG).\nDissolve 0.0017 g of dibromomaleimide-polyethylene glycol (DB-PEG) in 100 µL of DMF.\nAdd 680 µL of 10 mM sodium phosphate solution (pH 5.00).",
    "Add reduced Qβ into the solution of DB-PEG and observe the mixing process under a 365 nm UV lamp. The bright yellow fluorescence can be immediately visualized with a 365 nm handheld UV lamp upon mixing.\nLet the reaction proceed overnight at room temperature (RT) on a rotisserie.\nPurify the reaction mixture by centrifugal filter (COMW = 10 kDa) three times using 1x PBS at 3,283 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nMonitor the conjugation by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and native agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\tNOTE: VLPs run as intact particles in native agarose gel, and they are separated based on their charge, size and shape.\nSubscription Required.
