    "**Surface cleaning and APTES functionalization   TIMING ~ 1 h 2 min**\n1.  The Au-coated SPR chip was cleaned by incubating with Au surface cleaning solution for two minutes followed by extensive washing with DIW. It oxidizes the gold surface and generates hydroxyl groups.  \n  2.  The cleaned Au-coated SPR chip was then incubated with 100 µL of 2% \\(v/v) APTES for 1 h at room temperature \\(RT) in a fume hood followed by five washes with DIW. The procedure functionalizes the Au surface with APTES and generates amine groups on its surface.\n  \n**EDC-sulfoNHS activation of PrA    TIMING ~ 15 min**\n3.  PrA \\(990µL of 100 µg/ml in HBS) was incubated with 10 µL of cross-linking solution containing EDC \\(4 mg/mL) and sulfoNHS \\(11 mg/mL) in 0.1 M MES buffer, pH 4.7, at room temperature for 15 min. The procedure activates the carboxyl groups on PrA with EDC-sulfoNHS.  \n  **CRITICAL STEP** The ratio of EDC and sulfoNHS is important for optimal cross-linking. Use the recommended ratios of EDC and sulfoNHS or optimize this ratio. \n**? TROUBLESHOOTING**\n**Immobilization of anti-HFA antibody   TIMING ~ 12 min**\n4.  Fifty microliters of EDC-sulfoNHS activated PrA \\(100 µg/mL) was injected over all four flow cells of an APTES-functionalized Au chip at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. It cross-linked EDC-sulfoNHS activated protein A to the APTES-functionalized Au chip. \n  **? TROUBLESHOOTING**\n5.  Twenty microliters of 1% \\(w/v) BSA was then injected for blocking.   CRITICAL STEP Use filtered BSA or filter the BSA solution prior to use to remove any microbial or other contaminants. \n  **? TROUBLESHOOTING**\n6.  After baseline stabilization, 50 µL of anti-HFA antibody \\(100 µg/mL) diluted in 10 mM HBS, pH 7.4, was injected over all the flow cells at a flow rate of 10 µL/min.\n  \n**HFA-detection   TIMING ~ 10 min per concentration**",
    "7.  Fifty microliters of dilution buffer \\(10mM HBS, pH 7.4) was passed through all flow cells before HFA capture and the resultant changes in SPR response units \\(RU), corresponding to blanks, were recorded. \n  8.  Fifty microliters of HFA at six different concentrations \\(0.6, 1.2, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 ng/mL) were passed through the flow cells. The RU values obtained for blanks were subtracted from the RU values for HFA detected in the respective flow cells. \n  9.  The SPR-based HFA detection curves were plotted with SigmaPlot software, version 11.2 using standard curve analysis based on a four parameter logistic function. The analytical parameters such as EC<sub>50</sub> and Hillslope were generated by the software analysis report."
