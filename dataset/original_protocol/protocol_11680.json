    "All research described was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and under suitable licenses from UK Home Office in accordance with the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and subsequent modifications. Embryos/larvae should be reared at 28.5 °C until completion of gastrulation but may then be kept at 22-31 °C to control the rate of development. Fish may be scanned or stimulated at room temperature.\n1. Anesthetize zebrafish larvae\nCross suitable fluorescent reporter adult fish such as Tg(Ola.Actb:Hsa.HRAS-EGFP)vu119Tg reference36 or Tg(α-actin:mCherry-CAAX)pc22Tg reference37 and collect embryos as described38.\nAt the time of choice, such as 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), anesthetize embryos briefly using Tricaine-containing fish medium (either fish water or E3 medium), and screen for EGFP or mCherry under a fluorescence microscope, such as a Leica MZ16F. If one has many embryos, select those with the brightest signal. Return embryos to normal fish medium immediately after screening.\n2. Mounting fish for confocal scanning\nTurn on the confocal laser scanning system and lasers, to let the system stabilize for 30-60 min.\n\tNOTE: Here, we used a Zeiss LSM 5 Exciter microscope with upright materials stand (which enhances working distance) equipped with a 20x/1.0 W water-immersion objective.\nPrepare 1% low melting agarose (LMA) and keep in a 37 °C heat block for repeated use in a 1.5 mL tube. To avoid heat-shock, remove the LMA aliquot from the heat block and let it cool to just above setting before applying to the larva, testing against one's skin to judge the appropriate temperature, as when assessing the temperature of baby formula milk.\nSelect fish to be mounted and transiently anesthetize each fish in turn with Tricaine (0.6 mM in fish medium).",
    "Take a 60 mm diameter Petri dish that has been coated with a layer of 1% agarose and place on stage of a dissecting microscope.\nTransfer the larva with a 1 mL plastic Pasteur pipette onto the 60 mm coated Petri dish and remove as much transferred medium as possible. Then, still using the Pasteur pipette, place 5 to 10 drops of LMA onto the fish and rapidly position horizontally in lateral view with forceps (or a fire-polished fine glass needle) before the LMA sets. For optimal imaging, it is desirable to position the larva close to the upper surface of the LMA.\n\t\nAlternatively, using a 1 mL plastic Pasteur pipette, collect the larva with as little fish medium as possible, and transfer the larva into the aliquot of cooled LMA. Allow the larva to sink for 5 s to become fully surrounded by LMA. Then, retrieve the larva and transfer it in a drop of LMA onto the agarose-coated Petri dish. Quickly orientate and position the larva as described above.\nOrient the larva with both its anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes within 10° of the horizontal (see the note 'On error and its correction', at point 4.6 below).\n\t\nIf larva is not correctly mounted horizontally near the surface of the agarose drop, remove and re-embed. Larvae can be easily retrieved by gentle suction using a microfine 1 mL plastic Pasteur pipette, and LMA can be gently removed using Kimwipes. Practice really does make perfect in the mounting procedure; spend an afternoon embedding some unimportant larvae before trying this on a real experiment.",
    "​NOTE: On microscope design: Many labs use inverted confocal microscopes for imaging through a coverslip. We have found that the repeated embedded and removal of fish held in agarose under a coverslip for observation in an inverted microscope leads to greater loss of samples during repeated scanning than in the described procedure with an upright microscope. For this reason, the use of an upright system is recommended, if available. Nevertheless, a key to high quality data is the proper selection and use of objective and scan parameters, a subject too large for discussion here.\n3. Confocal scanning\nWhen LMA has set, flood the dish with around 10 mL of Tricaine-containing fish medium. If planning to capture confocal stacks, let the mounted fish rest for at least 10 min before proceeding to scanning, as some agarose swelling occurs.\nLoad the sample dish to the stage of the confocal system, locate the larva and focus on the desired somite. Somite 17 may be chosen because of its ease of localization near the anal vent and ease of imaging. Check by counting somites from anterior.\n\tNOTE: The first somite is fused behind the ear and has no anterior border, but can be readily observed to have striated muscle fibers.\nSet up as if to capture a Z-stack by defining top (i.e., just above the skin) and bottom (i.e., just below the notochord, so as to include the entire somite, even if the fish is mounted slightly skewed). Both left and right sides can be captured as desired. This will ensure that all the rapid YZ scans capture the desired region(s).",
    "Capture an XY image as follows. Orient the scan area with respect to the fish, as the confocal software permits. Position the fish with the anteroposterior axis parallel to the imaged X axis and dorsoventral axis parallel to the Y axis with somite 17 in the center of the field as shown in Supplementary File 1. Focus on a mid-level plane in the uppermost myotome in which the whole epaxial and hypaxial somite halves together with the vertical and horizontal myosepta are visible and capture a high resolution XY image. Remember to name and save the image.\nCapture one or more YZ images as follows. In the Representative Results (below) the accuracy of 2-slice and 4-slice methods is compared. In the 2-slice approach, single XY and YZ scans are employed. In the 4-slice approach, three YZ scans are averaged to give a more accurate estimate of myotome volume. If required by the confocal software, re-orient the scan field.\n\t\nDraw a precisely dorsal to ventral line across the chosen somite perpendicular to the anteroposterior axis of the fish at a selected anteroposterior position. Perform a Z-stack line scan.\nRepeat the YZ line scan three times at defined anteroposterior positions along the selected myotome to capture YZa, YZm, and YZp. Representative results are shown in Figure 2A. Name and save these images together with the related XY image.",
    "​NOTE: On selection of YZ planes: The myotome is V-shaped and its form changes during growth. To obtain the most accurate assessment of myotome 17 volume with the 4-slice method, position YZa on the anterior tip of the myotome, YZp on the posterior tips of the myotome at dorsal and ventral extremes, and YZm halfway between YZa and YZp. Assuming the somite tapers uniformly, the mean of measurements from each YZ section will represent the myotome as a whole. For the 2-slice method, the single YZ scan should be positioned at the posterior end of the horizontal myoseptum, which roughly corresponds to the anteroposterior center of the myotome of interest (such as YZm). Alternatively, a set of three YZ sections may be taken at anterior, middle, and posterior of the horizontal myoseptum but, as shown below, such measurement will slightly over- or under-estimate myotome volume (for rostral and caudal somites, respectively, due to myotome tapering). Fundamentally, consistency in positioning of YZ slice plane(s) between fish and experiments is key to reproducibility.\n4. Analysis\nAs the myotome changes size along the fish in a graded manner, always work with the same somite in comparative studies.\nTo measure and calculate the myotome volume, use the confocal software (such as the .lsm files created using Zeiss ZEN microscope software) or open-source universal image analysis software, such as Fiji/ImageJ.",
    "NOTE: If changing file formats, make sure the Z-step size is correctly transferred, as not all software can read proprietary confocal file formats correctly. For example, to import a ZEN line scan image into Fiji, first use the File/Export command to export as .tif in the Full resolution image window - single plane format, and then import into Fiji. Although YZ scan.lsm can be opened directly in Fiji, the resulting YZ images are generally compressed in the Z dimension due to incorrect evaluation of the Z step size.\nAnalysis using ZEN\n\t\nFirst, open the XY scan.lsm files in ZEN. Go to the Graphics tab and select the Line tool. Draw a line between the two vertical myosepta of somite 17 spanning the entire the myotome length (parallel to the anteroposterior axis of the fish). Check the M box to reveal the values of the measurement (Length = 89.71 µm, see Supplemental File 2).\nOpen the YZ scan.lsm files. Under the Graphics tab, select the Closed Bezier tool. Draw around the perimeter of the myotome. Once completed, check the M box, this would reveal the value of the measurement (Area = 11980.01 µm2, see Supplemental File 3).\nRecord the values of each measurement manually in a spreadsheet. Average the CSA measurements as required. Volume of the myotome can be calculated as Volume = Myotome length x CSA, i.e., 89.71 µm x 11980.01 µm2 = 1.075 x 106 µm3.\nAnalysis using Fiji/ImageJ\n\t\nOpen the XY scan.lsm files in Fiji/ImageJ. Check whether XY images directly opened in Fiji are correctly calibrated in scale, as they should be.",
    "Select the Straight Line tool from the icons. Draw a line along the length of somite 17 as described in step 4.3.1. Set measurement parameters by going to Analyze, then select Set Measurements…, and check the following boxes Area and Display Label. To measure, simply press the hot key M, or go to Analyze menu and select Measure. A resulting pop-up window lists all measurement values (i.e., Length = 90.023 µm; see Supplemental File 4). The results can be saved in form of .csv and opened in Microsoft Excel or similar for subsequent analysis.\nTo measure CSA on the YZ images, open YZ images in .tif format as described in step 4.2.\nCalibrate the YZ .tif images as they are uncalibrated when exported. Parameters for the calibration can be obtained in ZEN by going to the Info of the selected images: record the Scaling X (0.489 µm) and Scaling Z values (0.890 µm; see Supplemental File 5). Next, while the images are open in Fiji, go to Image and select Properties…. Input 0.489 µm for the Pixel Width and Pixel Height, and 0.890 µm for the Voxel Depth. Check the Global box to apply the calibration universally if repeated measurement of YZ images is anticipated (see Supplemental File 6).\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure all YZ images are captured using the same scanning parameters; restart Fiji/ImageJ or modify the calibration values if a new set of calibration is required.",
    "To measure the CSA of the calibrated YZ images, select the Polygon Selections tool from the icons. Draw around the perimeter of the somite, and press M to reveal the values of the measurement (Area = 11980.395 µm2; see Supplemental File 7). Volume of the myotome can be calculated as Volume = Myotome length x CSA, i.e., 90.023 µm x 11980.395 µm2 = 1.079 x 106 µm3.\nRepeat the measurements on the other XY and YZ images. It is recommended to use the same software for all measurements within an experimental series for consistency. The volume estimate from each software is similar but not identical due to the distinct drawing tools, i.e., ZEN = 1.074 × 106 µm3 and Fiji/ImageJ = 1.079 × 106 µm3. Growth of the myotome between two time points (i.e., 3 to 4 dpf) can be calculated as: (Volume 4 dpf - Volume 3 dpf)/ Volume 3 dpf × 100%.",
    "NOTE: On error and its correction. During mounting, the fish should be orientated with its sagittal plane (i.e., the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes) as close as possible to horizontal, to avoid yaw and roll, respectively. This is because both the myotome length L measured from the XY scan and the CSA measured from a YZ scan will be over-estimated if the fish shows yaw (rotation around the dorsoventral axis) due to oblique anteroposterior mounting. Neither pitch nor roll during mounting should affect measurements after scanning as described in section 3. Nevertheless, dorsoventral rotation (roll) degrades image quality. Simple trigonometry shows that up to 10° of yaw will give 3% error in volume measurement, as measured L and CSA each increase in proportion to (cosq)-1, where q is the angle away from anteroposterior horizontal (yaw). 15° and 20° off will give 7% and 13% over-estimates of volume, respectively.\n\t\tAs the notochord is cylindrical, inclusion of the whole notochord in the YZ scan can be used to calculate the angle and extent of obliquity from the orientation and magnitude of the major and minor axes and thereby correct the measured L and CSA to maximize accuracy. Corrected CSA = Measured CSA x Notochord minor axis/Notochord major axis. Corrected L = Measured L x Notochord minor axis/Notochord axis in microscope Z direction.",
    "A further consideration permits additional correction of L. As the myotome grows, it skews in the coronal plane (normal to the dorsoventral axis) such that the medial myotome is slightly anterior to the lateral myotome. Viewed from dorsal, the vertical myosepta on left and right sides form a broad chevron pointing anterior. If yaw is low, this morphology does not affect measurement of L. But if yaw is significant, trigonometrical correction becomes challenging and a better approach is to measure True L directly by estimating the XYZ coordinates of the two points where the anterior and posterior vertical myosepta meet the notochord at the horizontal myoseptum. Simple trigonometry permits calculation of True L from these coordinates as L = SQRT[(X2 - X1)2 + (Y2 - Y1)2 + (Z2 - Z1)2]. Weaknesses of this last approach are that a) selection of the points can vary with operator and b) no visual record of the points chosen is retained. This consideration does not affect CSA correction.\n5. Optional method: Remove and re-introduce muscle electrical activity\nCreate a stimulation chamber.\n\t\nTake a 6 x 35 mm well plate, create two small openings (<5 mm in diameter, 1 cm apart) on each side of each well (see Figure 1) using a narrow soldering iron.\n\t\tNOTE: Handle the hot soldering iron with care and work in a fume hood if desired to avoid inhaling vapor.\nThread a pair of silver or platinum wires (~20 cm long) through the openings of each well (see Figure 1). Reusable adhesive material (e.g., BluTack) can be applied near the openings to keep the wires in place, and ensure a 1 cm separation between the wires (see Figure 1).\nAt 3 dpf, split fish into three conditions: fish medium Control, Inactive, and Inactive+Stim.",
    "For Inactive and Inactive+Stim groups, anesthetize larvae at 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf) with Tricaine (0.6 mM).\n\t\tNOTE: Following reference38, frozen aliquots of tricaine stock are thawed and diluted (40 µL/mL fish medium, to a final concentration of 0.6 mM) before adding to fish. Do not add tricaine straight into the water containing fish, as some fish could receive high doses. Tricaine stock should be used within a month and never be re-frozen.\nFor the fish medium Control fish, leave them un-anesthetized.\nAt selected time(s) after the onset of tricaine exposure (i.e., at 80 hpf), prepare the Inactive+Stim group for stimulation.\n\t\nPrepare 60 mL of 2% agarose (1.2 g of agarose powder in 60 mL of fish medium), and melt fully using microwave, cool, add tricaine and pour 4 mL into each well of the stimulation chamber (Figure 1).\nImmediately add custom-made 4-well combs in between the electrodes (created by cutting out plastics (e.g., polypropylene) of desired dimensions and sticking together using Superglue; see Figure 1). Allow 10 min for gel to set. Remove combs carefully to create four rectangular wells.\nFill each well with tricaine water and place a single anesthetized Inactive+Stim larva in each well using a micropipette, with their anteroposterior axis perpendicular to the electrodes (see Figure 1).\nCheck under the dissecting fluorescent microscope whether each fish is fully anesthetized within each well of the chamber.\nConnect an adjustable electrophysiological pattern-generating stimulator to the chamber via a Polarity Controller, using crocodile clips connected to each of the electrodes on one side of the chamber (see Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The polarity controller is used to reverse the polarity every 5 s, so as to prevent electrolysis and corrosion of the electrodes.",
    "Stimulate fish. For example, 1s with a train of 200, 20 V pulses, with 0.5 ms pulse duration and 4.5 ms pulse separation, once every 5 s gives an effective repeated-tetanic contraction resistance regime.\nRegularly check under the microscope to confirm the fish are being stimulated; the example electrical stimulus should induce a visible bilateral contraction and slight movement, once every 5 s.\nFor a resistance/high force regime, stimulate the fish at a high frequency for a bout of 5 min, three times, with each bout separated by 5 min of rest.\n\tNOTE: While fish on one side of the chamber are resting, the crocodile clips can be connected to the electrode pair on the other side of the chamber, and those additional fish stimulated.\nAfter stimulation, carefully remove fish from each well by gently flushing them out with a plastic pipette and return to the incubator in fresh tricaine-containing fish medium.\nPour away the tricaine water from within the chamber and use forceps to cut around and remove the agarose from each well. Rinse the wells with tap water and allow to dry.\n\tNOTE: If using silver wire electrodes, occasionally silver oxide may accumulate on the surface of the wire after a stimulation experiment. As silver oxide is less conductive than silver, to maintain reproducibility, carefully rub silver oxide off the wire using Kimwipes before re-using the setup.\nSubscription Required.
