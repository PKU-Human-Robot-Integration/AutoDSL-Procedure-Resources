    "The present study enrolled consecutive myopia patients in the Department of Ophthalmology of Peking University Third Hospital. The research protocol was approved by the Peking University Third Hospital Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from each participant.\n1. Patient preparation\nUse the following initial inclusion criteria to enroll subjects: myopia subjects aged 17-45 years old.\nUse the following exclusion criteria: any history of ocular diseases, including keratitis, glaucoma, cataract, retinal and macular diseases, that significantly impact corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). Evaluate uncorrected distance visual acuity (using the standard logarithmic VA chart), dominant eye, intraocular pressure, slit lamp, corneal topography, fundus photography, automatic computer optometry, cycloplegic subjective refraction, and CDVA. Exclude participants with keratoconus, cloudy cornea, or retinal abnormalities, including retinal breaks, retinal vascular inflammation, congenital retinal and macular diseases, or monocular CDVA worse than zero (based on the standard logarithmic VA chart).\nSet up the DVA test components, including test distance, environment, hardware, software, movement mode, and rules as follows:\n\t\nFor test distance and environment, set the test distance according to the size of the screen and examination requirements.\n\t\t​NOTE: Here, DVA was assessed at 2.5 m in a quiet and bright room (luminance 15-30 lux).\nFor hardware, present the optotype with a 24 inch in-plane switching (IPS) or twisted nematic (TN) screen (refresh rate, 60 to 144 Hz; response rate less than 5 ms).",
    "Ensure that the software is designed to display the optotype according to the preset velocity and size. Use the dynamic optotype as the letter E designed according to the standard logarithmic visual chart with four opening directions: upper, left, lower, and right. Ensure that the visual angle of the motion optotype presented at the test distance equals the optotype with the decimal size in the standard logarithmic visual chart. Set the color of the letter E to black, with a white background. Express the velocity of motion as the viewing angle changes per second.\nMovement mode: during the test, ensure that the optotype with a specific size and velocity appears in the middle of the screen's left side, moves horizontally to the right side, and then disappears.\nTest rule: Ask the subjects to identify the opening direction of the visual target. Test the minimum visual target at a certain speed that the subjects can recognize.\n2. Subjective refraction\nNOTE: The result of subjective cycloplegic refraction is the basis for the eyeglasses prescription to correct the refractive error in myopia subjects.\nPerform automatic computer optometry as the primary data for subjective cycloplegic refraction and measure the pupil distance.\nExamine one eye at a time and occlude the other eye.\n\t\nFirst, achieve the maximum plus to maximum visual acuity: fogging with +0.75 - +1.0 D lens, inducing a visual acuity of 0.3-0.5 (decimal visual acuity). Next, gradually decrease the positive lens in a 0.25 D step. Use a Lancaster red-green test to tune the accurate spherical diopter. Add more negative/positive lens if the patients report that the letter seen against the red/green background is clearer.\n\t\tNOTE: The primary spherical diopter is obtained after the above step.\nRefine the cylinder axis.",
    "Place the Jackson cross cylinder device in the \"axis\" position so that the thumb-wheel's connecting line is parallel to the axis of the astigmatism. Rotate the thumb-wheel and ask the subject to compare the clearness between both sides. Turn the cylinder axis toward the red dots on the cross cylinder in the side with clearer vision. Repeat the binary comparison until the endpoint.\nRefine cylinder power.\n\t\nTurn the Jackson cross cylinder device so that the thumb-wheel's connecting line is at 45° to the astigmatism axis. Rotating the thumb-wheel, ask the subject to compare the clearness between both sides. If the patient reports clearer placement of the cross cylinder red/white dots connecting line along the cylinder axis, add a negative/positive lens, respectively. Repeat the binary comparison until the endpoint.\nFor the second maximum plus to maximum visual acuity, repeat the Lancaster red-green test to tune the accurate spherical diopter.\nFor binocular balance, apply a vertical prism of 6Δ before one eye to dissociate the binocular vision. Balance the clearness of the optotypes between both eyes.\n3. Dynamic visual acuity test\nNOTE: DVA was measured binocularly with refractive errors fully corrected with eyeglasses in the present study.\nTest settings\n\t\nAdjust the test distance according to the requirements. Adjust the seat to make the subject's sight at the screen's midpoint level. Ensure the subject wears the distance vision corrected eyeglasses binocularly.\nTest parameter configurations\n\t\nSet the optotype moving velocity and the initial optotype size.\nFor the pretest, display five optotypes with a randomized opening direction to guide the subjects to understand the test mode.\nFormal test\n\t\nStart the test at the size 3-4 lines bigger than the best-corrected distance visual acuity. Display the optotype with randomized opening directions.",
    "Ask the subject to identify the opening direction of the moving optotype. Present the next optotype after the subject's response. Present eight optotypes for a certain size. If five out of eight optotypes are identified correctly, adjust the optotype to one size smaller. Repeat the above procedures until the size for which the subject can identify less than five optotypes is obtained.\nRecord the minimum size (A, decimal VA) that subjects can recognize (five out of eight optotypes are identified correctly) and the number (b) of optotypes recognized for one size smaller than A.\nDVA calculation\n\t\nPresent eight optotypes for each size so that each identified optotype gains 0.1/8 visual acuity. Calculate DVA according to the algorithm of logarithmic visual acuity, as shown by Eq (1); see step 3.5 for an explanation of A and b:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63864/63864eq01v2.jpg (1)\n\t\tNOTE: In the present study, optotypes of 40 and 80 dps were examined in order. Previous studies have reported that people could apply smooth pursuit when observing dynamic objects moving at 30-60 dps, whereas observing objects moving faster than 60 dps involves head movement and saccade16,17. Thus, two motion speeds of 40 and 80 dps were selected.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
