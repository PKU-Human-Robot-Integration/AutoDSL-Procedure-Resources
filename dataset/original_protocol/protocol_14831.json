Use a stable HEK293 TOPflash cell line (Hans Clevers lab) with a Renilla luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Normalize the TOPflash assay with 100 ng/ml human recombinant Wnt-3A. Confirm at least a 10 fold-change activity of the conditioned media compared to control. Divide fresh Wnt-3A-conditioned medium into 10 ml aliquots in 15 ml conical tubes and freeze at -20°C for up to 6 months. Store thawed aliquots up to 5 days at 4°C without loss of activity.",
