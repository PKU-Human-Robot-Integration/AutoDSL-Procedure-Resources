    "Surface sterilize viable Arabidopsis seeds in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube with 1% Sodium hypochlorite for 3 min and rinse five times in autoclaved distilled water. Carry out all procedures inside a laminar flow hood to avoid contamination. Keep the rinsed seeds at 4°C for vernalization in dark conditions. After 2 days, place the vernalized seeds on the nylon mesh mounted on Fujifilm plastic mounts, and allow them to float on a Planton box already filled with modified MGRL solution (Recipe 1) in aseptic conditions, at 20 ± 2°C, with a photoperiod of 14 h, and with a photon flux density of 220 μmol m-2 sec-1 (PAR). After 5 days, with one hand decant the modified MGRL and replace with the treatment solution (10 μM AlCl3 solution containing 100 μM CaCl2, pH 5.0); while replacing the solution, hold the Fujifilm plastic mounts with the mesh bearing the seedlings on the other hand, using forceps. Harvest samples (whole plant tissue) for the redox pool assay at 6 and 12 h after the beginning of the treatment (Figure 1).Grind samples (whole plant tissue, 100 mg) in liquid nitrogen with a micro pestle in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and then extract with 1 mL of 0.2 N HCl. Centrifuged the homogenate at 16,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min; make multiple aliquots of the supernatant (0.2 mL each) for replicates.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4444/bioprotoc-12-12-4444-g001.jpgFigure 1. Arabidopsis plant grown in aseptic condition on MGRL hydroponic solution. For the NAD+ assay, incubate 0.2 mL of extract in boiling water (98–100°C) for 1 min, and then cool it rapidly and neutralize it by adding 20 µL of 0.2 M NaH2PO4 (pH 5.6), followed by the stepwise addition of 0.2 M NaOH aliquots. Vortex the sample after each addition and check pH with pH indicator paper.",
    "The final pH should be between 5 and 6, which requires approximately 0.16 mL of 0.2 M NaOH.To measure NADH, extract leaf samples as for NAD+ but with 0.2 M NaOH as the extraction medium, and neutralize the heated supernatant aliquot with 0.2 N HCl to a final pH of 7–8 for all samples. This requires approximately 0.14 mL of 0.2 N HCl. Vortex the sample after each addition and verify pH with pH indicator paper.Prepare the enzymatic reaction mixture as follows:Add MTT and 1-Methoxy PMS in separate tubes and dissolve in water (prepare these solutions at room temperature) (see Recipe 7).Add 2 mL of 1 M Bicine/NaOH Buffer, 0.4 mL of 1 M tris, 1 mL of 80 mM EDTA, and 1 mL of 10 M ethanol in a 50 mL centrifuge tube (see Recipe 7).Add the dissolved MTT and 1-Methoxy PMS to the 50 mL centrifuge tube, adjust the final volume to 20 mL, and incubate in a water bath at 25°C until further use (see Recipe 7). This solution will act as the reaction mixture.Prepare the ADH solution and keep it on ice (see Recipe 6).Add 40 μL of each standard sample (see Recipe 8 for NAD+, 9 for NADH), plant sample (from step 3 for NAD+ and from step 4 for NADH), and blank sample (40 μL water) to a 96-well plate.Add ADH (4 µL) to the reaction mixture (156 µL) and gently mix.Add 160 µL of enzymatic reaction mixture into each sample well of the 96-well plate and immediately measure the absorbance using a microtiter plate reader.Set the parameter for measurement of absorbance as: measurement filter, 570 nm; and kinetics, 10 measurements at 1 min intervals, shaking for 5 s before every reading.",
    "Plot the standard graphs of NAD+ and NADH in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and further evaluate the plant sample contents (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4444/bioprotoc-12-12-4444-g002.jpgFigure 2.
