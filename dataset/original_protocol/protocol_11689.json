    "1. Preparation of grape juice agar plates\nAdd 5 g of agar and 5 g of sucrose to 150 mL of distilled water. Boil it using a microwave until the agar and sucrose are fully dissolved. Mix 50 mL of 100% grape juice and the solution together.\nAdd 1 mL of 100% propionic acid to make the final concentration to 0.5% propionic acid. Pour 25 mL of the prepared solution into each plate. After the agar has solidified, store the media in 4 °C.\n2. Coating slides\nPretreat slides with detergent. Wash the slides 3 times with tap water and once with distilled water. Then dry the slides in a 45 °C oven for 2 h.\nImmerse the slides in about 450 mL of potassium dichromate sulfuric acid solution (20 g of potassium dichromate, 40 mL of distilled water, and 400 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid) for 24 hours. Wash the slides 3 times with tap water and once with distilled water.\n\t\nDry the slides in a 45 °C oven for two hours. Immerse in 95% ethanol for more than 2 h.\nAdd 0.5 g of chromium potassium sulfate and 5 g of gelatin to 1 L of distilled water. Dissolve in a 60 °C water bath before use. The chrome alum gelatin can be stored at 4 °C for long periods.\nDrop 10 µL of the chrome alum gelatin on the slide and fully and evenly cover the entire surface of the slide with the solution. Place the slide with the gelatin side up in an oven at 42 °C for 48 h. The prepared slides can be stored at 4 °C for later use.",
    "​NOTE: This is a critical step. The complete coating is necessary. For fruit fly and its embryo, this slide coating approach appears more efficient than poly-lysine coating.\n3. Drosophila embryo embedding\nDrosophila embryo collection\n\tNOTE: We collected Drosophila embryos in four periods of 0-2 hours (syncytial blastoderm), 2-3 hours (cellular blastoderm), 3-12 hours (early gastrula) and 12-24 hours (late gastrula)18. The proportion of the main embryo types in each period is shown in Table 1.\n\t\nPlace 400-500 flies in a plastic collection bottle and cover the bottle with the grape juice agar plate containing yeast extract. Drosophila embryos are laid on the grape juice agar at room temperature.\nCollect four periods of embryos, gently adding 2 mL of PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCL, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) to each plate to float the embryos. Transfer about 200 embryos to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and keep it on ice for 2 min to settle down the embryos.\nPre-embedding\n\t\nTransfer 200 Drosophila embryos to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Keep the tube on ice for 2 min to settle down the embryos, and then discard the supernatant with pipette carefully. Add 1 mL of 50% bleach in the tube and shake it gently for 2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The bleach should prepare fresh, and the amount of the bleach could vary depending on the amount of embryos collected.\nGently collect embryos by pour on filter paper and wash them 3 times with 1 mL of PBS at each time.\nTransfer the embryos with filter paper to about 5 mL of n-heptane.\nTransfer the mixture to a fresh 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Add 1 mL of methanol and shake it gently. Collect embryos after sedimentation.",
    "Remove supernatant and wash the embryos in 1 mL of PBS 3-5 times.\nFix the embryos with 400 µL of Bouin's solution (71% saturated picric acid, 24% formalin, 5% acetic acid) for 30 min. Wash the fixed embryos 3 times in 1 mL of PBS for 5 min each time.\nTo aggregate embryos, transfer the samples into a rubber stopper and remove the PBS.\nPrepare 1.2% agarose-PBS solution and keep solution at 60 °C. Add 200 µL of 1.2% agarose-PBS solution onto embryos to fix them into an agar block.\nTake the block out from stopper and store the block in PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: During pre-embedding approach, pro-warming is critical for successful. We strongly suggest that the centrifuge tubes and micropipette tips, which will be used in this step should be completely pre-warm before operating.\nParaffin embedding\n\t\nImmerse the pre-embedded agar block in 35% ethanol, 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, and 85% ethanol for 15 min each. Then dip 2 times in 95% ethanol and 100% ethanol.\n\t\tNOTES: About 5-10x of block volume of each followed by a graded fixative for 15-30 minutes is necessary depending on number of embryos in the block.\nImmerse the embryos block in 100% ethanol and xylene (1:1 ratio) solution for 15 min.\nTransfer the block to xylene for 1 min to make the embryo tissue transparent.\nSubmerge the block in xylene and paraffin (1:1 ratio) for 30 min.\nSubmerge the block in paraffin I, paraffin II, and paraffin III for 2 h each time.\nFill the embedding box with paraffin beforehand, and then gently and horizontally transfer the block into the bottom of embedding box. After the paraffin solidify naturally, the solidified paraffin block can be stored at 4 °C.",
    "​NOTES: The pre-embedded sample can be used in cryosection by following the following steps. After the embryos are pre-embedded with agarose as described above, the samples are simply embedded in OCT Compound. Afterwards, cryosection can be carried out according to routine cryosection protocol. Subsequently, regular staining approaches can be used on the sections.\n4. Hematoxylin-eosin staining\nPrepare Drosophila embryo sections. Place prepared sections in an oven at 60 °C for 15 min and then submerge the sections in xylene 2 times for 10 min each. Submerge the sections once in 100% ethanol and xylene (1:1 ratio) for 2 min.\nHydrate the sections in 100% ethanol I, 100% ethanol II, 95% ethanol, 85% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and in distilled water for 3 min.\nStain the sections with hematoxylin solution for 2 min. Dip the slides in 1% acid alcohol solution (1 mL of hydrochloric acid, 100 mL of 70% ethanol) quickly and wash the slides in distilled water.\nDip the slides in 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 85% ethanol, and 95% ethanol sequentially.\nStain the sections with eosin solution for 1 min.\nDehydrate the slides in 95% ethanol I, 95% ethanol II, 95% ethanol III, 100% ethanol I, 100% ethanol II and 100% ethanol III for 1 min each time.\nClear the slides in 100% xylene I, 100% xylene II, and 100% xylene III for 5 min each time.\nMount the slides with neutral balsam according to manufacturer's instructions.\n5.

    "Incubate the slides in about 40 mL of freshly filtered silver methenamine working solution (3% methenamine, 5% silver nitrate, 5% sodium borate solution) for 1 h and 20 minutes at 60 °C. Then rinse the slides in distilled water for 1 min.\nTone the slides in 0.2% gold chloride for 2 min and then rinse the slides in distilled water for 1 min.\nPlace the slides in 3% sodium thiosulfate for 3 min and then rinse the slides in distilled water for 1 min.\nCounterstain the slides in hematoxylin for 30 s. Wash the slides in running tap water for 3-5 min.\nDehydrate the slides in 70% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 95% ethanol I, 95% ethanol II, 95% ethanol III, 100% ethanol I, and 100% ethanol II for 5 min each.\nClear the slides in 100% xylene I, 100% xylene II and 100% xylene III for 5 min each.\nMount the slides in neutral balsam according to manufacturer's instructions.\n6. Immunohistochemistry\nDeparaffinize and rehydrate paraffin sections of Drosophila embryo to PBS following the standard protocol19.\nTreat slides with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min at room temperature and avoid light.\nPre-heat the appropriate antigen retrieval buffer to approximate 100 °C in a container with the slides in the vegetable steamer. The container should also have a lid. Put the slides in the container. Close the lid of the steamer.\n\t\nKeep the container in the steamer for 20 minutes from this point. Note that the lid of the slide container should not be entirely tightened so water vapor can enter during the steaming process.\nAllow the slides return to room temperature before gently rinsing it in PBS-T (PBS with Tween-20, pH 7.2) 3 times for 5 min each, and then rinse the slides in PBS 3 times for 1 min each.",
    "Block the slides with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 60 min at room temperature.\nIncubate the slides with primary antibody (anti-FKBP12 at 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C or at room temperature for 4 h.\nWash the slides in PBS-T 4 times for 5 min each.\nApply the slides with HRP labeled polymer conjugated with secondary antibodies (anti-Rabbit, 1:5,000) for 90 min at room temperature. Do this in the dark to avoid photo bleaching.\nWash the slides in PBS-T 3 times for 5 min each.\nIncubate the slides with 5% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (DAB) for 2-10 min until the color of reaction products is appropriate under microscope.\nCounterstain the slides in hematoxylin for 30 s and wash the slides in distilled water 2 times for 5 min each.\nDehydrate the slides in 50% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 100% ethanol for 1 min each.\nClear the slides in 100% xylene I, 100% xylene II and 100% xylene III for 5 min each.\nMount the slides in neutral balsam according to manufacturer's instructions.\n7. In-situ  hybridization\nNOTE: Drosophila embryo sections were prepared with 0.01% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water. All accessories used for in situ hybridization apply DEPC overnight treatment in advance.\nRiboprobe preparation\n\t\nLinearize template DNA by cutting at a restriction enzyme site downstream from the cloned insert using a restriction enzyme that creates 5' overhangs. After linearization, purify the template DNA via phenol/chloroform extraction, and subsequent ethanol precipitation. Use standard protocols.\nAdd 1 µg of purified template DNA to a RNase-free centrifuge tube. Place the centrifuge tube on ice. Add enough DEPC-treated water to the total volume 13 µL.",
    "Then add the following reagents in order: 2 µL of 10x NTP labeling mixture, 2 µL of 10x transcription buffer, 1 µL of protector RNase inhibitor, 2 µL of RNA Polymerase SP6 or RNA Polymerase T7.\nMix the reaction by pipetting and centrifuge shortly. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Longer incubations do not increase the yield of labeled RNA. A short spin (~800 rpm) applied on the reaction tube is critical necessary before continuing to the next step. This spin will allow all contents, which could generate from the incubation, to come to the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 2 µL of RNase-free DNase I to remove template DNA and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 2 µL of 200 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) to stop the reaction.\n\t\tNOTE: DIG-labeled RNA probes can be stored at -15 to -25 °C in ethanol for one year.\nPre-hybridization of Drosophila embryo section\n\t\nPlace sections of Drosophila embryo in a 42 °C oven for 48 h.\nDeparaffinize the slides in 100% xylene for 10 min twice.\nHydrate the slides by sequentially submerging in 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and 50% ethanol for 5 min.\nIncubate the slides in PBS for 5 min 3 times to remove the fixative solution/Bouin's solution from the tissue.\nWash the slides with 100 mmol/L glycine/PBS solution 2 times for 5 min each.\nWash the slides with PBS 2 times for 5 min each.\nIncubate the slides with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min to permeabilize the membranes.\nWash the slides with PBS 3 times for 5 min each.\nIncubate the slides in 15 µg/mL RNase-free proteinase K for 30 minutes at 37 °C.\nIncubate the slides with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3 min to stop the digestion.",
    "Wash the slides with PBS 2 times for 5 min each.\nIncubate the slides in 100 mM triethanolamine buffer (pH 8.0) with 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride 2 times for 5 min each.\nAdd DEPC water into the slide moisture chamber. Add 20 µL of pre-hybridization solution (containing 100 µg/mL of salmon sperm DNA) on the slides. Put the slides into the slide moisture chamber. Incubate the slides at 42 °C for 4 h.\n\t\tNOTE: It is necessary to ensure the tightness of the lid of the wet box and that the wet box is always kept in a horizontal to prevent volatilization and deviation from the tissue of the pre-hybridization solution and the followed hybridization solution.\nHybridization of Drosophila embryo section\n\t\nRemove the pre-hybridization solution and wash the slides with 0.2x SSC (150 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) 3 times for 5 min each. Wipe off excess 0.2x SSC around the tissue samples.\nApply 30 µL of probe hybridization solution (containing 2-6 ng of digoxin-labeled RNA probe by diluting in pre-hybridization solution) with a pipette. Incubate the slides in the slide moisture chamber at 42 °C for approximately 20 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Be sure on the cap-tightness as the suggestion of the last note. Otherwise, the dry-up caused from the leakage of either pre-hybridization or pre-hybridization will generate dirty background including pseudo-positive in slides.\nHybridization\n\t\nRemove the hybridization solution and wash the slides with 4x SSC solution 4 times for 15 min each at 37 °C.\nWash the slides in 2x SSC solution with 20 µg/mL of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C.\nWash the slides in 1x SSC solution for 15 min at 37 °C.\nWash the slides in 0.5x SSC solution for 15 min at 37 °C.",
    "Wash the slides in 0.1x SSC solution for 15 min at 37 °C.\nWash the slides with PBS 3 times for 5 min each.\nWash the slides in washing buffer (100 mM maleic acid, 150 mM NaCl, 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 min.\nIncubate the slides in 100 mL of freshly prepared blocking solution (2% sheep serum in maleic acid buffer without Tween 20) for 30 minutes.\nIncubate the slides in 20 mL of antibody solution for 45 minutes.\n\t\t\nCentrifuge the antibody for 5 min at 10,000 rpm in the original vial prior to each use, and pipet the necessary amount carefully from the surface. Dilute anti-digoxigenin-AP 1:5000 (150 mU/mL) in blocking solution.\nWash the slides in 100 mL of washing buffer 2 times for 15 minutes each to remove unbound antibody conjugate.\nEquilibrate the slides in 20 mL of detection buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 9.5) for 2-5 min.\nIncubate the slides with 10 mL of freshly prepared color substrate solution in the slide moisture chamber. The reaction begins within a few minutes and is complete after 16 h. Do not shake or mix while color is developing.\nWash the slides with 50 mL of distilled water for 5 min to stop the reaction.\nDry the sample overnight in the dark.\nDehydrate the slides in 70% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol I and 100% ethanol II for 3 min each.\nClear the slides in 100% xylene I, 100% xylene II and 100% xylene III for 20 min each.\nMount the slides with neutral balsam.\nDocument images and analyze with the inverted microscopy and manufacturer software. Perform distribution analysis using ImageJ according to density of positive signal either along longitudinal axis or within differential zone of embryos.",
    "NOTE: During the incubation with the freshly prepared color substrate solution in the step 7.4.12, the reaction color can be seen even with a bare eye. This observation on how color developing can be inspected under stereoscope. Once reaction color is reasonable and the step 7.4.13 can be carried out to stop the reaction.\nSubscription Required.
