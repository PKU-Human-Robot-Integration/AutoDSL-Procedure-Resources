    "Figure 1 shows a schematic of silk fibroin nanoparticles (SFNs) or enzyme-entrapped SFNs preparation using acetone.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181213/20181213234833_7610.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of silk fibroin nanoparticles (SFNs) or enzyme-entrapped SFNs preparation using acetone Degum the clean cocoon shell twice in boiling 0.2% (w/v) Na2CO3 for 0.5 h each time. After the degumming treatment, wash the resulting silk materials repeatedly in deionized water and then air dry.Immerse the degummed silk fibers into 20-fold volume (w/v) of Ajisawa's reagent (CaCl2/ethanol/H2O, 1:2:8 molar ratio) (Ajisawa, 1998) and stir at 70 °C (water bath) for 4 h.Centrifuge the silk fibroin-salt solution at 7,000 x g for 10 min to remove impurities and insoluble substances. Dialyze the filtered solution or supernatant continuously for 48 h with running deionized water to remove CaCl2, smaller molecules and some impurities using a cellulose semi-permeable membrane (cutoff 5 kDa).Concentrate the aqueous solutions of regenerated silk fibroin to 1%-5% of silk fibroin solution at 4 °C by using PEG and finally store it at 4 °C for SFN preparation.If preparing enzyme-entrapped silk fibroin nanoparticles (SFNs), add a given amount of enzyme (liquid or powder) to the above silk fibroin solution and homogenize the mixture mildly via shaking by hand. Rapidly Inject the silk fibroin solution or a mixture with enzyme into acetone (acetone is more than 70% of the final mixture) by using a 20 ml injector at room temperature; while injection proceeded, rapidly shake the 50 ml beaker or container containing the protein/enzyme by hand. The milk-like silk protein particles or enzyme-entrapped silk protein particles form immediately and suspend in the mixture composed of water and acetone. These particles are water-insoluble and can precipitate slowly due to nanoparticle aggregating. Filtrate and collect the precipitates of these nanoparticles through 0.",
    "22 μm filter paper, or purify from the mixture by centrifugation at 108,000 x g for 0.5 h to separate the particles from the solvent. After subject these filtered retentates or centrifuged precipitates to ultrasonic treatment (Output Watts: 16) five times for 2-min each, the nanoparticles or enzyme-entrapped nanoparticles disperse evenly in 50 mM phosphate buffer or water and can be stored at 4 °C for a long time."
