    "1. Build the microscope environmental enclosure\nNOTE: This large microscope environmental enclosure is used to control the temperature of the microscope body and the imaging environment to be stabilized at 37 °C (Figure 1A).\nMark the locations of the feet of the SRS microscope frame and the motorized stage using a marker pen on the optical table. Mount two Iris Diaphragms in front of the Galvanometer scanner of the microscope and adjust to make the pump and Stokes laser beams pass through the center of the Iris Diaphragms.\nRemove the microscope frame and the stage from the optical table.\nLay the silicone rubber sheet (size: 31 x 29 inches, thickness: 1/8 inch) on the optical table (Figure 1B).\nCut the silicone rubber along the marks using a knife, remove small rubber pieces, and place the square MICA ceramic sheets (size: 6 x 6 inches, thickness: 1/4 inch) into the same locations.\n\tNOTE: MICA ceramic is an easy-to-machine material15. It is as hard as aluminum but is an excellent thermal insulator. MICA ceramic sheets were used to stop heat transfer from the metal microscope frame and stage to the stainless-steel optical table. A few through-holes should be drilled on the MICA sheets to allow the use of ¼-20 screws for mounting the feet of the frame and the stage.\nMove the microscope frame and the stage back to the optical table and carefully align the feet onto the MICA ceramic sheets along the marker lines. Use ¼-20 screws to mount the frame and the stage on the table.\nRealign the SRS optical path. Adjust the mirror mounts of Mirror 1 and Mirror 2 to make the laser beam pass through the center of the two premounted Iris Diaphragms (Figure 2).",
    "NOTE: Technical details of the lab-built SRS microscope used for the current live-cell imaging work are described previously16. The pulse width of the pump and Stokes beams are ~3-4 ps with glass rod dispersion. The system is controlled using the ScanImage17 software.\nOn top of this thermal insulation foundation, assemble the environmental enclosure to cover the entire microscope frame using five pieces of large polycarbonate sheets (size: 31 x 29 x 28 inches, thickness: 0.25 inch).\n\tNOTE: The size of the enclosure box is determined based on the dimensions of the microscope frame and the stage. The front panel of the microscope enclosure box will need to be removed temporarily to install the flexible chamber and load the cell culture dish.\n\t\nTo assemble the enclosure, carry out simple machining work, including cutting, drilling, and tapping screw holes on each edge of the polycarbonate sheets. Cut two large holes with a diameter of 2.6 inches on the right and the left sheets of the enclosure to fit the inlet and outlet tubing, respectively. Cut a small hole with a diameter of 5 mm on the back sheet to allow the laser beams to enter the enclosure.\nSeal the edges and interfaces of the box using aluminum foil tape.\nConnect the flexible duct hose to the inlet and the outlet ports of the enclosure box to allow circulated warm airflow pumped and controlled by the heater module. Place the thermal sensor of the heater module in the flexible chamber where the cells are cultured and imaged. Set the targeted temperature at 37 °C.\n\t​NOTE: A diffuser may be used to get a more uniform airflow distribution in the environmental enclosure.\n2. Assemble the flexible chamber",
    "Mount the machined hollow cylindrical aluminum piece 1 (material: aluminum 6061) to the nosepiece of the objective using three set screws (Figure 2).\nMount the machined hollow cylindrical aluminum piece 2 to the sample holder using four ¼-20 screws (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The sample holder must be modified to hold the 50 mm cover glass-bottom cell culture dish. Drill a through hole in the center of the sample holder using a 1-7/8 inches hole saw. Counterbore the hole using a 50 mm hole saw and keep the depth of the through hole ~1 mm.\nFit the sample holder with the aluminum piece 2 onto the motorized stage and mount it using screws.\nPlace the natural rubber film sleeve (thickness: 0.01 inch; glued with cyanoacrylate adhesive) between the two machined aluminum pieces and mount it using rubber bands at each end.\nConnect the compressed CO2 cylinder to the gas mixer module using proper tubing and connectors. Set the CO2 input pressure at 20-25 psi. Use a built-in CO2 sensor and a controller to ensure the air mixer module can regulate and mix 5% CO2 into the airflow. Use inline filters to clean up the airflow.\nUsing proper tubing and connectors, guide the mixed air (with 5% CO2) to the presterilized water bottle placed on the hot plate, and then guide the humidified air to the flexible chamber. Set the hot plate at 37 °C. Bubble the airflow in the warm water to increase the humidity of the airflow.\n3. Preparation for time-lapse live-cell SRS imaging experiments\nWipe all parts of the flexible chamber with 70% ethanol, including the nosepiece, the water dipping objective, and the sample holder.\nDecontaminate the entire enclosure system using a UV lamp placed in the enclosure for 20 to 30 min.",
    "NOTE: Do not stay in the lab room during the UV disinfection process for safety.\nCulture SKOV3 cells in a 50-mm glass-bottom Petri dish for 12 h under normal physiological conditions in a regular incubator.\n\tNOTE: Start the SKOV3 cell culture18 in a standard biosafety cabinet.\nDisconnect the machined aluminum piece 2 from the sample holder by removing the screws.\n\tNOTE: This is the way to open the flexible chamber to load the cell culture dish.\nLoad the cell culture dish. Remember to add immersion oil on the top of the condenser before placing the cell culture dish. Remove the cover of the dish and immobilize the dish using the clamps.\n\tNOTE: To avoid contamination, all the operations should be performed with gloves.\nLower the objective into the cell culture media for coarse focusing. Lower the aluminum piece 2 to enclose the flexible chamber and mount it to the sample holder using screws.\n\tNOTE: A 2 mm silicone rubber cushion pad is attached to the bottom of the aluminum piece 2 to seal the gap tightly.\nSet the air supply with 5% CO2 and 19% O2 for normal cell culture with an airflow rate of 200 cc/min.\n\t​NOTE: A lower airflow rate may be used. It depends on how well the flexible chamber is sealed.\n4. Conduct time-lapse live-cell SRS imaging experiments\nTune the laser wavelength to 805 nm to target the 2854 cm-1 Raman shift, which is attributed to the vibration of CH2 chemical bonds. Use low laser power to reduce photodamage to the cells. To follow this protocol, use ~15 mW average power of the pump laser and ~7.5 mW of the Stokes laser (fixed at 1,045 nm) for long-term live-cell imaging.",
    "NOTE: Higher laser power will yield better SRS imaging quality. However, too high laser power will induce photodamage to live cells. There is a tradeoff between image quality and photodamage.\nAdjust and focus the objective to achieve good SRS imaging of the cells using the FOCUS button on the MAIN CONTROLS panel of the software. To perform rapid focusing, set the pixel number to be 512 × 512 pixels with a pixel dwell time of 4.8 µs on the CONFIGURATION panel.\nSet the lock-in amplifier input range (typically 5 mV) to be twice the maximal signal voltage. Set the low-pass filter to be the same as the pixel dwell time (4.8 µs).\n\tNOTE: Different lab-built SRS systems may use different data acquisition settings.\nAfter achieving good focusing, set the imaging resolution to be 2,048 × 2,048 pixels for a 175 µm2 field of view for the acquisition of high-quality images. Check the SAVE function on the MAIN CONTROLS panel and check the SRS channel on the CHANNELS panel. Set the interval time between two frames to be 180 s (3 min) on the MAIN CONTROLS channel. Set the acquisition number to 480 for time-lapse imaging over 24 h.\n\tNOTE: A lower imaging resolution may be used based on the purpose of the experiments.\nStart automated imaging acquisition using the LOOP function on the MAIN CONTROLS panel.\n\tNOTE: Check whether there is focal drift due to temperature instability in the first hour of imaging. The first-hour imaging may not be stable. Check focusing every 2-3 h during the time-lapse imaging session.",
    "Process the collected images using ImageJ19. Use the following two methods for LD quantification: (i) the LD/cell body area ratio, and (ii) the mean SRS intensity of total LDs. Measure the cell body area by thresholding and zeroing the non-cellular pixels in the SRS images at 2,854 cm-1. Measure the LD area and intensity by thresholding and zeroing the non-LD pixels in the SRS images.\n\tNOTE: More details about SRS image processing were reported previously16.\nSubscription Required.
