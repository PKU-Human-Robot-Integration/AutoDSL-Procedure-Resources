    "The protocol was performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the University of Malaya Medical Center. Written consent was obtained, and a detailed explanation of the procedure was provided to the patient. Permission was also granted to produce the video of the procedure for educational purposes.\n1. Positioning and sedation\nPlace the patient in a prone position. Provide moderate sedation using intravenous infusion of Propofol. Ensure the infusion is titrated by the anesthetist.\n2. Identifying the suitable target dilated left intrahepatic ducts\nAdvance the linear echoendoscope making sure it passes the gastro-esophageal junction.\nPlace the tip of the echoendoscope at the lesser curvature of the gastric cavity and proceed to identify the dilated left intrahepatic duct (IHD).\nPerform fluoroscopic imaging to ascertain the position of the echoendoscope. The tip of the echoendoscope must be placed at the lesser curvature of the gastric cavity, as stated previously. Always maintain the echoendoscope position and stabilize with periodic checks using fluoroscopic imaging throughout the procedure.\nIdentify the dilated segment 3 IHD. Slightly tilt the angle of the tip of the echoendoscope upward to facilitate the next step in needle puncture.\n\t​NOTE: Subsequent steps of the procedure involve inserting and exchanging of accessories via the working channel of the echoendoscope throughout the procedure.\n3. Needle access into the targeted dilated left intrahepatic duct\nPerform Doppler ultrasound to ensure that there are no intervening blood vessels around the targeted IHD.\nUsing a 19 G needle, puncture the segment 3 IHD (Figure 2A). Using a 10 mL syringe preloaded with 7 mL of the contrast solution, gently aspirate the bile solution, this was to confirm the success of biliary access.\nFollowing that, perform contrast injection to opacify the left IHD and the rest of the biliary system.\n4. Guidewire manipulation",
    "Use a 0.025-inch guidewire to navigate into the left IHD under the fluoroscopic guidance.\nCannulate the guidewire across into the right intrahepatic duct (Figure 2B).\n\t​NOTE: Ideally, the guidewire should be manipulated deep into the common bile duct; however, it was not possible in this case due to the obstructing hilar tumor.\n5. Fistula tract dilation\nDilate the fistula tract using a 6 Fr electrocautery dilator in addition to using a 4 mm biliary balloon dilator (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: Fistula tract dilation is required to facilitate insertion of the biliary stent later.\nPerform balloon inflation for approximately 5 s.\n\tNOTE: While doing these, monitor the position of the accessories monitored using both the sonographic and fluoroscopic image, ensuring that the wire is visible and the echoendoscope position is maintained. This is done to ensure a smooth transition during the exchange of accessories which is very important.\n6. Stent insertion and deployment\nDeploy a 10 mm sized partially covered biliary stent (length of 10 cm) under fluoroscopic guidance (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: The stent has a 3 cm uncovered distal portion and a 7 cm covered proximal portion. The uncovered part must be within the intrahepatic duct (Figure 3C). Approximately 3 cm of the covered part of the stent is left in the gastric cavity to prevent inward migration of the stent (Figure 3B).\nEnsure that the distal end of the stent opens in the IHD. Deploy the proximal end within the working channel of the echoendoscope and subsequently release into the stomach with bile seen flowing within the stent.\nSubscription Required.
