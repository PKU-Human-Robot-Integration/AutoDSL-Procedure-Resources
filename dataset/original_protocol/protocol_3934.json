For solid plates, agar (1.2%, w/v) will be added to the liquid medium before autoclave.\nAutoclave for 25 min (at 121°C with a pressure of 15 psi or 1.03 × 105 Pa) and cool the medium-agar mix to 55°C.\nAdd any antibiotics if needed (for example, to prepare agar plates with 100 μg/mL zeocin for growing zeocin-resistant diatom transformants) and pour the plates with 20 mL for each plate in a 100 mm diameter plate, and then cool down the plates to room temperature (22 ± 2°C) and dry the plates in the safety cabinet (laminar flow hood) for one hour after the agar solidifies.\nSubculture diatoms on the freshly prepared solid plates by distributing 200–400 μL liquid seed cultures, which are cultivated under continuous cool white fluorescent lights of 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1 at 22 ± 2°C and maintained in exponential growth phase on each plate.\nGrow the solid cultures under continuous cool white fluorescent lights of 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1 at 22 ± 2°C until observing single colonies and oval cells as the major morphotype. Freshly prepared samples should be used for cell observation to avoid morphotype changes during storage.\nPrepare liquid diatom cultures\nMake up a fresh medium according to the f/2+Si medium recipe (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nAutoclave for 25 min, cool the medium to room temperature (22 ± 2°C), and add any needed antibiotics.\nSubculture diatoms by inoculating seed cultures into the freshly prepared liquid medium (10%–20%, v/v) in 250 mL flasks with a total culture volume of 50 mL.",
    "Grow the liquid cultures under continuous cool white fluorescent lights of 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1 at 22 ± 2°C to the exponential growth phase and confirm fusiform cells as the major morphotype in the liquid cultures. Freshly prepared samples should be used for cell observation to avoid morphotype changes during storage.\nTranscriptome analysis of two different morphotype cultures\nTiming: hours to days\nHigh-quality RNA should be extracted from cells for both solid culture (oval > 75%) and liquid culture (fusiform > 90%) to facilitate the downstream RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and subsequent transcriptome analysis.\nExtract RNA from two different morphotype cultures for RNA-seq\nCollect diatom samples from fresh cultures. For both solid culture with oval cells > 75% of the population, collect cells from plates and resuspend them in deionized water; for liquid culture with fusiform cell > 90% of the population, take 30–50 mL cultures for each sample (approximately 10–20 mg dry weight for next steps 1b–1d).

A workflow to generate liquid culture (fusiform cells in dominance) and solid culture (oval cell in dominance)\nThere are usually three morphotypes in P. tricornutum cultures, i.e., fusiform, oval and triradiate cells. The fusiform cells are dominant in liquid culture under non-stress conditions, while the oval cells dominate surface colonization in solid culture. The microscopic images are representative to indicate the morphotype difference between samples.\nPellet cells in 50 mL tube by centrifugation at 4000 × g at 20°C for 5 min, use the pipette to remove the supernatant and wash the cell pellets using deionized water; repeat the step for 2–3 times, and then resuspend cell pellets in 1 mL of deionized water.",

Quantify RNA samples with specific concentration, purity, and integrity values by using the Qubit RNA assay kit. A minimum RIN score of 8 is preferred for proceeding to RNA-seq.\nCritical: The diatom cells must be ground thoroughly to break down cell walls by repeating the freeze and thaw cycle and also kept at low temperature (ice bath) conditions during the whole process to avoid any RNA degradation. In addition, the Lysis/Binding Solution for processing diatom samples must be freshly prepared and used on the same day.\nPerform RNA-seq on RNA isolated from the WT P. tricornutum strain in liquid and on solid media\nTake the samples of total RNA with high quality after quality control using a bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
