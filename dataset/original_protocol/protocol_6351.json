    "Pacemaker cardiomyocytes isolated from sinoatrial node (as described in Aziz et al., 2020) are plated on to laminin-coated coverslips (Recipe 5) at least 1 h prior to recording.Note: In our experience freshly isolated SAN cells can be used for patch-clamp for up to 4-5 h after isolation before they become difficult to patch-clamp.Whole-cell patch-clamp/Perforated whole-cell patch clampPull pipettes from appropriate glass capillaries (with filament for whole-cell and without filament for perforated patch-clamp) with a 2-step pipette puller and polish them with the microforge, their resistance should be around 4 to 5 MΩ when filled with pipette solution for the whole-cell configuration (pipette resistance is measured using the patch-clamp amplifier and the pCLAMP recording software when the pipette tip is placed in the bath solution). For perforated patch-clamp, pipette resistance is around 1.3-1.6 MΩ.Note: The heat settings for the pipette puller need to be optimized for the required resistance. This will be different for individual machines, however as an example, we set our pipette puller (PP-830, Narashige) to 62 °C (1st pull) and 48 °C (2nd pull) for whole-cell patch pipettes (with filament) and to 6 °C (1st pull) and 43 °C (2nd pull) for perforated-patch pipettes (without filament). The second pull is important for the shape and size of the pipette. Take a coverslip from the plate using curved forceps and place it, cell side up, into the patch-clamp chamber. Perfuse the cells continuously with extracellular solution (most patch-clamp rigs have gravity-driven perfusion systems on them to allow continuous perfusion of solutions during experiments).Fill the pipette with the relevant intracellular solution (~half-full using a 1 ml syringe attached to a microloader pipette tip) and remove any air bubbles by gently flicking the pipette before placing it on the pipette holder.",
    "For perforated patch-clamp, first fill the tip of the pipette with amphotericin-free intracellular solution by carefully dipping the tip in this solution for a few seconds, then back fill the pipette with stock solution containing amphotericin (Recipe 2).Notes: It is very important to remove any air bubbles so as not to compromise whole-cell access resistance and current/membrane potential measurements. It is advantageous to use non-filamented glass capillaries for perforated patch because it allows one to fill the end of the tip of the pipette with amphotericin-free solution, this helps with seal formation by delaying perforation. The time for ‘dipping’ the tip (to fill the tip with amphotericin-free solution) is important as it can influence the time taken to perforate the cell–this time must be optimized. In general, we ‘dip’ the tip for 2 s initially and see how that affects seal formation and perforation. If seal formation is difficult or the cell starts to perforate before seal formation then a longer ‘dipping’ time is required. Lower the pipette into the bath solution using the micromanipulator. After compensating for pipette offset (using the patch-clamp amplifier), under the microscope, approach and gently touch the chosen cell with the pipette to form a high resistance Giga-Ohm (GΩ) seal using negative pressure (suction).For perforated patch, wait until the access resistance (Ra) reaches at least 20 MΩ (this depends on the efficacy of the amphotericin). For the whole-cell configuration apply more negative pressure to achieve whole-cell access. Ra should be below 10 MΩ. In both configurations, compensate for whole-cell capacitance and series resistance (70-80%) using the patch-clamp amplifier (this has in-built circuitry to compensate for both parameters). Note the whole-cell capacitance (Cm) for each cell.For acquisition, set the filter at 2 kHz and sampling rate at 10 kHz.",
    "Whole-cell funny current (If) measurements using the perforated patch-clamp techniqueTo record whole-cell If currents from SAN cells, the amplifier should be set to voltage-clamp mode (this is done via a switch on the amplifier interface).The following solutions allow for detection and measurement of the If current: Perforated-Patch intracellular solution and Tyrode extracellular solution (Recipe 1).Acquire If current-voltage relationship using the following step protocol (see Figure 1): Hold the cell at a holding potential of -40 mV. From -40 mV step to -130 mV for 1,300 ms and then to +40 mV for 400 ms (this step is to investigate inactivation properties) and then back to -40 mV for 350 ms. This is repeated a further 9 times with an incremental change of 10 mV for each step e.g., -130, -120, -110 etc.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191226/20191226173140_0878.jpgFigure 1.

    "Representative 6 s spontaneous action potential train from a single SAN cell using conventional whole-cell patch-clamp. D. Magnified from C, showing the various parameters as in B. E. Representative action potential trace using a 5 ms, 1,000 pA trigger (lower trace) showing the various parameters as in B and D. The left-hand trace shows a much quicker upstroke compared to spontaneous action potentials.To measure spontaneous action potentials from SAN cells use the following solutions: Perforated-Patch intracellular solution (Recipe 3) and Tyrode extracellular solution (Recipe 1).Once an adequate whole-cell access resistance is reached and whole-cell parameters compensated, switch to current-clamp mode. The y-axis label on pCLAMP should change to mV.Acquire spontaneous action potentials using a gap-free recording protocol (no trigger is applied-the gap-free protocol is a continuous recording without any user-defined parameters other than the length of recording).If spontaneous action potentials are not firing, it is possible to initiate action potential firing using a trigger–a short 5 ms current pulse (between 300 and 900 pA is usually optimal). The frequency of the trigger can be set as desired. For example, 1 Hz (1 trigger/second) or 3 Hz (3 triggers/second).Note: Where a cell lacks spontaneous activity, action potentials can be triggered by injecting a current pulse. The size of the pulse can vary from cell to cell and must be optimized to trigger a full action potential.Action Potential measurements using conventional whole-cell patch-clamp (current-clamp mode–set using the amplifier interface) (see Figure 2)Spontaneous and triggered action potentials can be measured in the conventional whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. To record action potentials or changes in membrane potential in this configuration use the following solutions: Whole-Cell Current-Clamp intracellular solution (Recipe 4) and Tyrode extracellular solution (Recipe 1).After ‘going’ whole-cell and compensating for whole-cell capacitance switch to current-clamp mode.",
    "Record spontaneous or triggered action potentials (see Procedure D).Note: The whole-cell current-clamp intracellular solution has a ‘low’ EGTA concentration (less buffering of Ca2+)–in our hands, this is conducive for better action potential recordings over a longer period of time compared to intracellular solutions with higher EGTA."
