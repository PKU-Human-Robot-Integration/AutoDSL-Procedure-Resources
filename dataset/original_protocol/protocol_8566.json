    "1. Cell Line Preparation\nThaw approximately 1,000,000 mouse neuroblastoma spinal cord cells (NSC-34 cells) that were stored in a liquid nitrogen container. Use a 37 °C water incubator until the cells are fully thawed.\nAdd fresh, warm medium (DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% pen-strep antibiotics).\nCentrifuge thawed cells (SL16R) at 500 x g for 5 min, forming a cell pellet. Discard the medium and add 1 mL of new medium for the cell resuspension.\nPlace the resuspended cells in a 15 mL flask and add an extra 5 mL of medium. Incubate the cells overnight in a sterile incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nIn parallel, place 8 uncoated coverslips (cover glass: 12 mm, 0.13-0.17 mm thick) in a 60-mm culture dish and sterilize using 70% ethanol and exposure to 30 min of UV light until it is dry. Add medium to each dish and dispose to wash off the residual ethanol.\nAdd trypsin buffer (2.5 g of trypsin and 0.2 g of EDTA in 1 L of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution) to the cells after they reach approximately 90% confluence (roughly 6 million cells per flask) to allow adherent cells to dissociate.\n\tNOTE: NSC-34 cells are sensitive and only require 15 s of trypsin buffer incubation and 1 additional min of incubation free of trypsin before dissociation using the medium.\nPlate the cells onto the 60 mm culture dishes already containing the coverslips with 3 mL of medium, approximately 350,000 per dish. Leave them in the incubator for 24 h to allow cell attachment onto the coverslips.\n2. Cell Transfection\nNOTE: After approximately 24 h, the NSC-34 cells will reach 40% confluence (approximately 800,000 cells) and will be ready for transfection.",
    "Prepare pure DMEM medium (300 µL of DMEM medium for each 60 mm culture dish) in sterile microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd 2 µg of each plasmid required for transfection to each DMEM-containing microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: The shuttle-GFP plasmid is mandatory in all cell transfections.\nAdd transfection reagent to all the microcentrifuge tubes that contain their required plasmids. Here, add 4 µL of the commercial transfection reagent for each 2 µg of DNA.\nVortex the microcentrifuge tubes containing DMEM, plasmids, and the transfection reagent and incubate them at room temperature for 25 min.\nAdd each microcentrifuge tube to a culture dish and stir the dish gently to form a homogenous solution. Place the dish back in the incubator for 48 h.\n\tNOTE: Since shuttle-GFP should be expressed in all cells, the shuttle-GFP transfection efficiency can be partially examined and pre-tested using fluorescent microscopy after overnight transfection. A full examination of non-fluorescent expressed proteins can be conducted using an immunoblot analysis.\n3. Microscopy\nAttach the coverslips containing transfected NSC-34 cells to a coverslip holder and wash gently with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the detached dead cells.\nIdentify a suitable cell patch using a green fluorescent filter with an inverted microscope.\n\tNOTE: A suitable cell patch is defined as a microscope field of view showing a large number of cells (20-30 cells in a field) and in which the nuclei are clearly defined in the cells. Cell nuclei within the cell patch are first identified by eye and are manually marked by the imaging software.\nAdd 200 µL of an exportin-1 inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB) buffer containing 10 ng/mL LMB in PBS to the coverslips by dripping the buffer on the coverslips under the microscope.\n\tNOTE: This point in time is set as interval zero.",
    "Quantify the fluorescent intensity of the marked nuclei in 3 s intervals for around 400-500 s.\nTest between 3 and 5 cover slips for each transfection group in each individual experiment.\n4. Analysis\nNOTE: Since different cells express different levels of florescent shuttle-GFP, it is important to normalize the nuclear fluorescent intensity of each cell to its own initial fluorescent intensity.\nNormalize the fluorescent intensity of the marked nuclei by dividing 3-s fluorescent interval of each nucleus with the average of the initial six intervals of that nucleus.\nAfter the normalization of each nucleus, produce a fluorescent intensity curve representing the change in nuclei fluorescence as a function of time for each cell patch. To do this, calculate the average of all the cells in each cell-patch (consisting of approximately 20-30 cells in each patch).\n\tNOTE: The nuclei fluorescent intensity curve resembles a Michaelis-Menten saturation curve, which is better observed within increased time periods. This is due to a decrease in the cytosolic amounts of shuttle-GFP with time due to nuclear transport. This decrease statistically lowers the probability of a shuttle-GFP to transport into the nucleus, thus reaching saturation in nuclear fluorescence. The slope derived from the linear initial rate of the curve yields the Vmax entry rate into the nucleus.\nAnalyze the Vmax slopes of each cell patch, derived from three to five independent experiments, using the graphing software to produce one slope representing each experimental group. Perform quantification using one-way ANOVA statistical analysis.\n5. Protein Expression Validation\nPlace 60 mm culture dishes containing the residual cells (not used in the above experiment) from each experimental group on ice.\nDispose the medium and wash the cells twice with PBS to dilute and wash the remaining medium.",
    "Treat the cells with 200-400 µL of lysis buffer containing PBS, 0.5% Triton, and protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (PI). Scrape using a cell scraper.\nCollect the cells in lysis buffer in a microcentrifuge tube and homogenize with a homogenizer at 4,000 rpm for 1 min under ice.\nCentrifuge the homogenized cells at 2,500 x g for 10 min. Collect the supernatant, quantify the protein concentration using a Bradford assay, and store until use at -20 °C.\nCollect between 30 and 70 µg of total protein (depending on the protein) and load it into a SDS-PAGE gel to test for protein expression using an immunoblot assay.\nSubscription Required.
