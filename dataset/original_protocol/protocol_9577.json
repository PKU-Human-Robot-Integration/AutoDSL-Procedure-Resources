    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Patras and the Institutional Review Board of the University General Hospital of Patras. Prior to obtaining biological specimens, informed consent was obtained from healthy individuals. The eligibility assessment of participants was conducted according to institutional procedures and in compliance with JACIE standards for leukapheresis. If this protocol is to be implemented in a clinical ACT setting, all procedures must adhere to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines and be performed in GMP-compliant clean rooms. Special safety precautions are necessary when working with viral vectors, and these procedures should be conducted within a dedicated biosafety cabinet. In this study, the described procedures were conducted within a validated H35 HEPA Hypoxystation (see Table of Materials) to ensure a controlled and monitored environment. Decontamination of all hazardous liquids should be carried out using 10% bleach solution.\n1. PBMC isolation and T cell activation (Day 0)\nCollect cells from the donor apheresis bag (leukopaks, see Table of Materials) into 50 mL tubes, depending on the initial volume.\nPerform two washes of the cell bag by infusing 15 mL of complete hematopoietic media (+5% HSA, commercial serum-free hematopoietic media, see Table of Materials).\nConduct polysaccharide-based density gradient centrifugation at a 1:2 (reagent:sample) dilution. Centrifuge at 800 x g for 30 min at room temperature with breaks off (A/D, 9/0).\nUsing a micropipette, collect PBMCs into a clean 50 mL tube.\nWash the cells twice with 1x PBS, filling up to 50 mL for each wash (400 x g, 10 min, room temperature). Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of complete media.\nCount the cells using trypan blue using either a standard hemocytometer or an automated cell counter (see Table of Materials).",
    "Dilute the cells with complete media to achieve a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL.\nActivate 20 x 106 PBMCs by adding 10 µL of T cell stimulation reagent (see Table of Materials) per 2 x 106 starting cells.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is designed for the activation of 20 x 106 PBMCs but can be adjusted for larger cell numbers as needed.\nAdd rhIL-2 (20 U/mL) (see Table of Materials), mix gently, and transfer the mixture into an appropriate vessel (e.g., 6-well plate).\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 72 h.\n2. Lentiviral T cell transduction (Day 3)\nTransfer the cell culture into a suitable vessel, such as a 50 mL conical tube. Mix well and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at room temperature (RT) to remove the activation reagent. Carefully discard the supernatant completely and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of complete medium.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, it is possible to thaw the virus on ice.\nCount the cells using trypan blue.\nResuspend the cells in complete medium to achieve a concentration that allows for plating 0.5 x 106 cells in a total volume of 400 µL per well in a 24-well plate. Add rhIL-7 (155 U/mL) and rhIL-15 (290 U/mL) (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Ensure to account for the volume of viruses to be added. Refer to step 2.4.\nIn a separate tube, add Vectofusin-1 (see Table of Materials) to Opti-MEM medium at a concentration of 10 µg/mL, with a volume equal to the viral volume to be used.\n\tNOTE: Consider the total cell culture volume when calculating the concentration of Vectofusin-1. See step 2.3. Alternatively, Vectofusin-1 GMP can be used as a GMP-grade reagent.",
    "Combine the concentrated virus at a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 40 with the Vectofusin-1/Opti-MEM mixture (1:1 ratio) and mix thoroughly. Add this mixture to the cell culture and adjust the total volume to 400 µL per well using complete medium, if necessary.\nPlace the lid on the plate, seal it with paraffin film, and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 2 h at 32 °C. Subsequently, incubate the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight.\n3. Virus removal and T cell expansion (Day 4)\nCollect the cells and pool them into a suitable vessel, such as a 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 x g at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. Carefully remove the supernatant completely and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of complete media.\nCount the cells using trypan blue. Resuspend the cells in complete media at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL. Add rhIL-7 (155 U/mL) and rhIL-15 (290 U/mL) (see Table of Materials).\nTransfer the cells to an appropriate vessel, such as a T25 flask, at a concentration of 0.3-0.5 x 106 cells/cm2 and incubate them at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for 2 days.\n\t​NOTE: If a larger cell population is required, cells can be subcultured (1:2) in the presence of rhIL7 and rhIL-15 every 2 days, following the same incubation conditions mentioned above, until the desired cell numbers are achieved.\n4. Cryopreservation (Day 14)\nNOTE: Ice will be required to transfer cryovials to the storage location during this step. The timing of cryopreservation depends on the desired cell numbers. For this protocol, cryopreservation is performed on Day 14 after achieving a 25-fold expansion.\nOnce the desired cell number is reached, harvest the cells and transfer them to 50 mL tubes (adjust the number of tubes based on the total volume).",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at 400 x g at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. Carefully remove the supernatant completely and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of media. If necessary, pool the cells from multiple tubes.\nCount the cells using trypan blue. Keep an aliquot of 1 x 106 cells for each quality control (QC) testing (refer to Section 5) to assess Vector Copy Number and Transduction Efficiency.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 400 x g for 10 min at RT. At this point, label the cryovials accordingly.\nCompletely remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in a cryopreservation solution consisting of 50% HSA and 40% HBSS at a concentration of 1 x 107 cells per mL per cryovial. Transfer the cell suspension into the appropriate number of cryovials and add 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to each cryovial.\nPlace the cryovials on ice and promptly transfer them to a controlled-rate freezer for cryopreservation. After cryopreservation, transfer the cryovials to a monitored liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage.\n5. Quality control (Day 14)\nNOTE: For release testing, the product underwent several tests, including sterility tests for microbial growth, and endotoxin level assessment. These tests were conducted in certified laboratories at the University General Hospital of Patras and the University of Patras. Mycoplasma presence was determined in-house using a biochemical detection assay and measured on a luminometer following the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials). Cell phenotype (Figure 1) as well as cell number and viability were assessed in-house by flow cytometry (see section 5.1) and an automated cell counter (see Table of Materials), respectively. Release criteria were established based on published data and recommendations10,11for GMP-produced cell products (Table 1).\nPerform transduction efficiency-flow cytometry staining (Day 14)",
    "NOTE: An aliquot of 1 x 106 cells will be stained for viability (7-AAD) and CD3 marker2 to evaluate the transduction efficiency (see Table of Materials). If the gene of interest, such as in the case of CAR T cells, needs to be detected, the specific antibody should be in a different color from that of the CD3 marker and 7-AAD to avoid compensation. Appropriate control samples should be taken into account.\n\t\nPlace the sample in a FACS tube and add 500 µL of FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g at RT for 5 min.\nCompletely discard the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the pellet in a 1:5 diluted solution of CD3:FACS buffer (see Table of Materials).\nVortex the sample and incubate for 30 min on ice in the dark.\nAdd 500 µL of FACS buffer. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min (RT).\nCompletely discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in a 1:20 diluted solution of 7-AAD:FACS buffer (see Table of Materials).\nVortex the sample and incubate for 10 min on ice in the dark.\nAdd 200 µL of FACS buffer and analyze the sample using a flow cytometer (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
