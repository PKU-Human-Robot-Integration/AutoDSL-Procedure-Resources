    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol and timings below are described for 96 samples, including negative controls, which corresponds to the number of samples multiplexed for the 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\nPart 1: DNA extraction-isolation of total genomic DNA from infant feces\nTiming: approximately 2.5 – 3 h for 12 samples including 1 h automatized (approximately 3 days for 96 samples)\nDNA is isolated using a combination of a first manual step for sample preparation using a modified protocol of the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-powerfecal-pro-dna-kit/?clear=true] (version 12192013), followed by an automatized step using the QIAcube Standard Protocol “Purification of DNA from stool and biosolid samples V1[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/qiacube/standard/search.aspx?ApplicationTypeID=6&ProductLineID=2000994&MaterialTypeID=58]” (March 2017). The QIAcube can process 12 samples per run. In the library preparation step, we work with 96 samples at the same time, thus eight extraction batches are required in order to proceed. A negative extraction control (DEPC-treated and filter-sterilized water) should be included for each newly opened QIAamp PowerFecal DNA kit. A mock sample is processed in one of the eight batches for DNA isolation.\nThaw fecal samples at 20°C–25°C (room temperature) for approximately 20 min.\nAdd 0.1 grams (± 0.03) of feces to the Dry Bead Tube provided with the kit.\nTroubleshooting 1: Insufficient fecal material.\nNote: The remaining sample is stored at −80°C for long-term storage.\nAdd 750 μL of Bead Solution to the Dry Bead Tube. Gently vortex to mix.\nAdd 60 μL of dissolved Solution C1 and invert several times or vortex briefly.\nHeat the tubes at 65°C for 10 min.\nOptional: During the 10 min incubation, prepare the Rotor Adapter according to step 8 in the protocol. This will save you 10 min.\nDisrupt the samples using a TissueLyser II for 5 min at 30 Hz.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at 13,000 × g for 1 min.\nPrepare the Rotor Adapter as follows:\nPosition 1: Place a MB Spin Column. Place the lid in position L1.\nPosition 3: Place the elution tube (1.5 mL). Place the lid in position L3.\nInside a fume hood, transfer 450 μL of supernatant into the QIAcube Rotor Adapter position 2.\nProceed according to the QIAcube Protocol Sheet[href=https://www.qiagen.com/se/qiacube/standard/search.aspx?ApplicationTypeID=6&ProductLineID=2000994&MaterialTypeID=58]. For detailed instructions on how to load the Rotor Adapter, the samples, the reagent bottle rack, the tip racks, and the accessory buffers to the QIAcube, follow the QIAcube User Manual[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=f7d77c6e-0479-4b2b-a2e0-5ca747114e34&lang=en] (section 5.3).\nStart the QIAcube “Purification of DNA from stool and biosolid samples V1” protocol.\nOnce the extraction is finished (approximately 1 h later), the screen will display “Protocol complete”. Follow the instructions given in the QIAcube screen.\nProceed directly to the next step for DNA quantification or store the samples at 4°C (short-term storage) or at −20°C (long-term storage).\nCritical: Cell disruption during DNA isolation influences the microbial community profile. In general, gram-positive bacteria are difficult to lyse; particularly the detection of Bifidobacteria, a dominant genus among healthy breast-fed infants, is highly dependent on the mechanical cell disruption during the DNA isolation process (Walker et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). The original protocol solely uses chemical disruption; we optimized the protocol by adding a mechanical disruption step in order to obtain a more accurate bacterial community profile.\nCritical: Although the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA kit has recently been indicated as a good kit for gut microbiota profiling (Lim et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), we recommend to check for kit contamination (kitome), at least once for each new QIAamp PowerFecal DNA kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/qiaamp-powerfecal-pro-dna-kit/?clear=true] used. For this purpose, a negative control (i.e., DEPC-treated and filter-sterilized water) is used instead of a fecal sample.\nPart 1: DNA extraction-DNA quantification",
    "Timing: approximately 1 h for 12 samples\nThe DNA concentration is quantified following the manufacturer’s instructions of the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kits[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/Q32851] (MAN0002326 | MP32851, Revision B.0), which uses 1–20 μL of sample for DNA quantification. In Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], we provide the exact volumes of the reagents to prepare for the Qubit working solution for the DNA quantification of a 12-samples batch. In Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], we provide the exact volumes of reagents, standard, and sample used in this protocol. See Troubleshooting 2 if the DNA concentration is below the detection limit (common for DNA isolated from fecal samples collected during the first two weeks of life of ELBW infants).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_2.csv\nPause point: Store the DNA samples at 4°C (short-term storage) until 96 samples have been obtained in order to proceed with the library preparation step.\nAlternatives: The preparation of the Qubit working solution as described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] can be replaced by using the Qubit 1× dsDNA HS (High-Sensitivity) Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher), which provides a ready-to-use reagent and buffer formulation.\nPart 2a: 16S rRNA gene sequencing—library preparation\nTiming: approximately 7–8 h for 96 samples\nThe library preparation is based on the Illumina protocol “16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation[href=https://support.illumina.com/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/16s/16s-metagenomic-library-prep-guide-15044223-b.pdf], Preparing 16S Ribosomal RNA Gene Amplicons for the Illumina MiSeq System” Part # 15044223 Rev. B. An overview of the protocol is described below with detailed description of the modified steps and otherwise referred to the Illumina protocol.\nNote: one 96-well plate contains 93 fecal DNA samples, one mock DNA sample, one work-up negative control from the DNA extraction step, and one no template control from the library preparation.\nPrepare the Master Mix (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) for the Amplicon PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_3.csv",
    "Transfer 22.5 μL of the prepared Master Mix to each well of a 96-well plate and add 2.5 μL fecal DNA sample, mock DNA, or negative control per well. Pipette up and down several times to ensure proper mixing.\nSeal the plate and spin the plate for 30 s to collect the liquid at the bottom of the wells.\nPlace the 96-well plate in a thermocycler and run the Amplicon PCR program following the settings shown in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_4.csv\nAmplicon PCR clean-up using AMPure XP Beads.\nBring the AMPure XP beads to 20°C–25°C (room temperature) and prepare 80% ethanol by mixing 40 mL of 99.5% ethanol with 10 mL of DEPC-treated and filter-sterilized water.\nFollow the Illumina protocol for the PCR clean-up, pages 8–9.\nVerify that the generated amplicons have the correct size by using a QIAxcel according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The expected amplicon size is ∼550 bp.\nTroubleshooting 3: Amplicon PCR results in no amplification product.\nPause point: Before proceeding to the Index PCR, the 96-well plate (sealed) can be stored at −20°C for up to one week.\nPrepare Master Mix (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]) for the Index PCR inside a fume hood. Follow the Illumina protocol (pages 10–12) for instructions on how to combine the index primers.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_5.csv\nAdd 5 μL of clean Amplicon PCR product per well and pipette up and down several times to ensure proper mixing.\nSeal the plate and spin the plate for 30 s to collect the liquid at the bottom of the wells.\nPlace the 96-well plate in a thermocycler and run the Index PCR program following the settings shown in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_6.csv\nFollow the Illumina protocol (pages 13–14) for the Index PCR clean-up.\nIndex PCR size verification.",
    "Dilute the samples 10-fold in a new 96-well plate, by mixing 2 μL of sample with 18 μL of DEPC-treated and filter-sterilized water. This dilution will be used in the following Library normalization step.\nVerify that the 10-fold diluted amplicons have the correct size by using a QIAxcel according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The expected amplicon size is ∼630 bp.\nTroubleshooting 4: No product after Index PCR.\nPause point: Before proceeding to the Library normalization step, the 96-well plate containing the 10-fold diluted samples can be sealed and stored at −20°C for up to one week.\nNote: We recommend to also store the non-diluted 96-well plate at −20°C.\nPart 2a: 16S rRNA gene sequencing—library normalization\nTiming: approximately 3.5–4 h for 96 samples\nLibrary normalization.\nQuantify the 10-fold diluted libraries (1 library = 1 sample) using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay (as described above). Quantify each sample at least three times and use the mean.\nNote: Performing step 20a (DNA quantification) in parallel with step 19 (Index PCR size verification) will save you approximately 1.5 hours.\nCalculate DNA concentrations in nM for an average library size of ∼630 bp as follows:\n  DNA concentration in nM =     (  concentration in  ng μl   )  x   10 6     (  660  g mol   )  x  average library size in bp    \nDilute each library to a final concentration of 4 nM, using 10 nM Tris pH 8.5.\nPool 96 libraries into one unique aliquot by combining 5 μL of each normalized library.\nQuantify the pooled library with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (as described above) to ensure its concentration is approximately 4 nM. Do not dilute the pooled library. A concentration of approximately 1.7 ng/μL corresponds to 4 nM.\nPart 2a: 16S rRNA gene sequencing—library denaturing and MiSeq sample loading",
    "Timing: approximately 2 h sample preparation + 56 h sequencing for 96 samples\nFollow the Illumina protocol (pages 17–19) and the suggested volumes in order to obtain:\n20 pM denatured library\n10 pM diluted denatured library\n20 pM denatured PhiX control\n10 pM diluted denatured PhiX control\n20% (v/v) PhiX control spiked-in library. The PhiX control is added in order to increase complexity for the first sequenced bases.\nFollow the MiSeq System Guide[href=https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/system_documentation/miseq/miseq-system-guide-for-local-run-manager-15027617-05.pdf] for loading the library.\nNote: Use 2 ml screw cap tubes. Five tubes are needed (one per each step mentioned above).\nCritical: Perform the heat denaturation step of the pooled library with 20% spiked-in immediately before loading the library into the MiSeq reagent cartridge to ensure efficient template loading on the MiSeq flow cell.\nCritical: Before loading the library, it is very important to invert the Illumina MiSeq cartridge 10 times to mix the thawed reagents. Load the sample (600 μl) into the reservoir Load Samples.\nPart 2b: Quantitative PCR specific for L. reuteri DSM 17938\nTiming: 1 day for 2× 41 samples\nEach qPCR run (one 96-well plate) includes five standards, one work-up negative control from the DNA extraction step, one no template control (DEPC-treated and filter-sterilized water), and up to 41 samples in duplicates. The SsoFastTM EvaGreen® Supermix[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/en-se/product/ssofast-evagreen-supermixes?ID=MH5HL6MNI] (Bio-Rad) is used for qPCR reactions. The Supermix is a ready-to-use solution containing all reagents except primers and templates necessary for the qPCR. This Supermix can be used with qPCR detection systems like the CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection Systems (Bio-Rad), which we used.\nFor detection of the probiotic L. reuteri DSM 17938, we used the primer pair LR1/1694 (Romani Vestman et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) which generates 177 bp long amplicons of the L. reuteri DSM 17938-specific single-copy gene Lactobacillus reuteri unknown protein lr1694 (GenBank accession number: DQ074924.1)",
    "Standard curve preparation.\nMeasure the DNA concentration of the L. reuteri DNA eluate using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit as described above. 1 ng L. reuteri DNA corresponds to 4.1 × 105 L. reuteri bacteria.\nPrepare a L. reuteri standard stock solution with 5 × 105 lr1694 gene copies/μL by mixing the L. reuteri DNA eluate with nuclease-free water.\nPer day, prepare a fresh standard curve with five standards S1-S5 by serially diluting the standard stock solution as shown in Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_7.csv\nStore the standard stock solution at −20°C and the standards S1-S5 at 4°C until use.\nSample dilution.\nDilute fecal DNA samples 10-fold with nuclease-free water.\nNote: Depending on how many lr1694 gene copies are present in a sample, the sample can be used undiluted or in a higher dilution. For our study, a few samples had Cq values outside the range of the standard curve. Those samples were re-run in undiluted or 20-fold dilutions and then the Cq values fell within the range of the standard curve.\nStore the diluted samples at 4°C until use.\nPrepare the Master Mix for the qPCR (Table 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl8]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_8.csv\nFirst, dilute the forward and reverse primers to a concentration of 10 μM using nuclease-free water.\nVortex briefly and spin down.\nAdd SsoFastTM EvaGreen® Supermix.\nMix by pipetting up and down several times. Do not vortex.\nPreparation of the qPCR plate.\nAdd 18 μL Master Mix to each well of a 96-well plate.\nBriefly vortex and spin down standards S1-S5 and 10-fold diluted fecal DNA samples.\nAdd 2 μL standard, negative control, or fecal DNA sample per well. Add each standard, negative control, and sample in duplicate.\nSeal the plate and spin the plate for 30 s to collect the liquid at the bottom of the wells.",
    "Remove the seal and place the 96-well plate in a CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection System.\nRun the qPCR program shown in Table 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl9].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_788_9.csv"
