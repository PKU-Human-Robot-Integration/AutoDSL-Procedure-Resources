    "1. Prepare parts for well plate perfusion\nPrepare tubing\n\t\nCut two lengths of silicone tubing (1.6 mm inner diameter) for each cell culture to be perfused. Ensure that the piece used as the upstream tubing is long enough to reach from the syringe pump to the cell culture inside the incubator, and that the downstream piece can reach from the cell culture to the furthest extended position of the fraction collector.\nGive each piece of tubing a unique label on both of its ends with labeled tape.\nPrepare stoppers for the well plate\n\t\nObtain one silicone stopper for each well of the well plate to be perfused, with an appropriate diameter to fit snuggly into the wells with an airtight seal.\nCut off excess material from the bottoms of the stopper so that they fit into the wells while leaving space inside for air above the intended liquid level.\nPush two blunt 18 G needles through each stopper, into the top and out from the bottom to serve as the inlet and outlet for the flow through the well, diametrically opposite one another to maximize the distance between their tips within the well.\nAdjust the heights of the needles within the plugged well, as the height of the outlet needle will determine the stable height of the liquid level in the well during perfusion.\n\t\tNOTE: If the perfusion is started with the outlet needle above the liquid level, then the liquid will accumulate in the well until the level reaches the needle. If the perfusion is started with the outlet needle below the liquid level, the liquid level will remain steady unless air bubbles flow into the well, which will cause the liquid height to lower until it is the same height as the outlet needle.\nGather additional parts",
    "Obtain one sterile syringe for each cell culture to be perfused that is large enough to contain enough medium for the entire perfusion, plus an additional amount of medium to initially fill the tubing.\nFor each culture to be perfused, obtain one female-to-barb and two male-to-barb Luer connectors, as well as two female and two male Luer caps.\nClean and sterilize parts\n\t\nIf parts have been used previously, clean them by perfusing them with 0.1 N NaOH, followed by a rinse with deionized water.\nBy autoclaving or otherwise, ensure the sterility of all parts listed above.\n2. Laser-cut the multi-head dispenser and attach it to a fraction collector\nRecreate the multi-head dispenser model from Figure 3 in a computer-aided design program or download the provided model DXF file (Supplemental File 1).\nUse a laser cutter to cut the design from a 1/8 in acrylic sheet.\nRemove the three screws attaching the dispensing head to the moving base of the fraction collector.\nAlign the three smallest holes in the multi-head dispenser with the screw holes in the moving base, and screw the screws back in through the holes to attach.\nAdjust the tightness of the three screws to angle the multi-head dispenser up and down until the row of dispensing holes is aligned with the collection tubes below it.\nCarefully place 300 μL pipette tips through the desired holes to serve as dispensing tips.\n\t​NOTE: The fraction collector may be used without the multi-head dispenser to perfuse a single cell culture.\n3. Measure component RTDs and perform signal convolution\nSet up pumps and syringes for tracer pulse as shown in Figure 2.\n\t\nObtain two single-channel or multichannel syringe pumps.",
    "Choose a background solution to represent the medium that will be used in the flow system during cell culture experiments. Ensure that the background solution has similar mass transfer properties to the medium. In many cases, deionized water is an appropriate choice.\nChoose a tracer substance to represent the solute that will be of interest during cell culture experiments. Ensure the tracer has similar mass transfer properties to the solute of interest, and its concentration must be able to be measured. In many cases, food dye is an appropriate choice.\nDissolve the tracer substance in the background solution to make the tracer solution.\nFill one syringe with a background solution and load it into one syringe pump. Fill another syringe with tracer solution and load it into the second syringe pump.\nConnect both syringes to two of the three ports of a four-way stopcock using Luer connectors.\nClose the stopcock to the background solution and pump the tracer solution into the stopcock until it begins to drip out the open port. Stop the pump and do not adjust the syringe further.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that the moving bar of the syringe pump is pushed up against the syringe plungers before the timed portions of the experiment begin. This will allow the flow to begin immediately when the pump is started. Otherwise, the pump may be started, but flow will not actually begin until the moving bar catches up to the plunger position.\nClose the stopcock to the tracer solution and pump the background solution into the stopcock until all residual tracer solution has been flushed out of the open port. Stop the pump and do not adjust the syringe further.\nSet up the flow system component of interest and the fraction collector",
    "Set up the flow system component desired for RTD analysis. Ensure the component to be measured ends with a piece of downstream tubing of suitable length and flexibility to reach the fraction collector during operation.\nInsert the end of the downstream tubing into a pipette tip dispenser in the multi-head dispenser such that it is snuggly connected.\nAttach the open port of the four-way stopcock to the inlet of the component to be measured. Pump background solution through the component until it is entirely filled as it would be during a cell culture experiment, and it begins to drip out of the fraction collector dispensing tip. Stop the pump.\nInject tracer pulse, collect fractions, and measure tracer\n\t\nSet the pump for the tracer solution to the desired flow rate. Close the stopcock to the background solution and start the flow of the tracer solution. At the same time, start the fraction collector.\nContinue the flow of tracer solution for a short period of time to approximate an impulse input of the tracer. A pulse duration of 10 min was found to work well for RTDs at a flow rate of 1 mL/h.\n\t\tNOTE: If the tracer pulse is too brief, not enough tracer will enter the flow to be measurable. If the pulse is too long, it will no longer approximate an impulse and will change the shape of the RTD.\nAt the end of the tracer solution pulse period, stop the tracer solution pump. Quickly close the stopcock to the tracer solution and start the flow of the background solution at the same flow rate.\nAllow the background solution to flow and fractions to be collected until all of the tracer has passed through the system and into the collected fractions.",
    "Stop the system and measure the tracer concentration in the fractions. Only include fractions that were dispensed completely. If the collection is stopped part-way through the collection of a fraction, do not include that fraction.\nCalculate the residence time distribution (RTD) from measured data in MATLAB\n\tNOTE: A written explanation of the analysis performed by this MATLAB script can be found in the authors' previous publication11, and discussions of the theory are widely available in literature13.\n\t\nProduce a .xlsx file containing the concentration data in the format of the example_tracer_data.xlsx spreadsheet provided in Supplemental File 2. Enter the concentration values of the tracer in the fractions (any units) in chronological order from left to right in row 2. Enter the time elapsed from the start of the pulse to the end of the last fraction in cell A5, and enter the length of the tracer pulse in minutes in cell A8.\nSave the .xlsx file in the MATLAB directory.\nOpen the RTD_From_Data.m script, from Supplementary File 3, in the MATLAB editor.\nReplace the name of the .xlsx file in the parentheses in the first line of the Load Data section of the script with the name of the new .xlsx data file, following the instructions written within the script file. Run the script.\nEnsure that the script successfully performs RTD analysis13, producing a plot of the RTD and returning the value of the numerical integral over the RTD equaling 1. Find the time vector (t) and associated RTD values vector (Et) saved by the script to the MATLAB directory.\nFit a model function to the RTD in MATLAB\n\t\nOpen the Fit_RTD_Function.m script in the MATLAB editor from Supplementary File 4.",
    "Choose one of the three commented-out model functions to fit to the RTD: the axial dispersion model13, which fits RTDs for laminar flow in cylindrical tubes; the CSTR model13, which fits well-stirred tanks; and the n-CSTR model15, which approximately fits larger well plates. To fit another model not included here, add it to the script in the same format.\nRemove the comments in the section of the script containing the model chosen for fitting.\nChange the values of the initial guesses for the parameters to ones appropriate for the RTD.\nRun the script to produce a plot of the fit function overlaid on the RTD data and to print the fit parameter values for the function. If the fit is very poor or errors occur, change the parameter initial guesses and run the script again.\nPerform signal convolution in MATLAB\n\t\nChoose either one signal and one RTD or two RTDs to convolve.\nOpen the Signal_Convolution.m script, from Supplemental File 5, in the MATLAB editor.\nFor each of the two signals to be convolved (i.e., one signal and one RTD, or two RTDs), define one vector of evenly spaced time points in the desired units and a corresponding vector of signal values at those times.\n\t\tNOTE: The vectors of the two signals must have the same number of elements and the same size time steps. This is why it's useful to have the RTD as a continuous function that can be sampled for an arbitrary number of points at any time interval.\nEnter the two signals into MATLAB and run the script to obtain the time and signal vectors of the output signal.\n4. Set up the basic perfusion system with cells in a well plate\nPrepare the well plate",
    "Ensure the well plate culture has the appropriate medium depth for the perfusion experiment. Perform any final medium changes, stimulations, or other steps as desired prior to beginning perfusion. If suspension cells are being perfused, centrifuge the plate to ensure they are on the bottom.\nUnder sterile conditions, insert the stoppers with needles into the well plate cultures with the needles pulled up. After the stopper is in place, lower the needles to the desired height for perfusion, as the height of the outlet needle determines the stable liquid level.\nCap the needles with male Luer caps and keep the whole well plate in an incubator until use.\nPrepare the syringes and upstream tubing\n\t\nUnder sterile conditions, fill one syringe for each culture to be perfused with enough medium for the desired duration of the perfusion, plus enough additional medium to fill the upstream tubing.\nAttach the upstream tubing to the syringe using a female-to-barb Luer connector. On the other end of the tube, insert a male-to-barb Luer connector.\nDispense medium from the syringe until the upstream tube is entirely filled with medium.\nCap the open end of the tube with a female Luer cap.\n\t\tNOTE: All replicate syringes must have exactly the same volume at this point. If their volumes are not equal, their plungers will be in different positions, and they will not all fit well into a single multichannel syringe pump.\nUnder sterile conditions, insert a male-to-barb Luer connector into one end of the downstream tubing, and cap it with a female Luer cap.\nCarefully bring all prepared tubing, syringes, and the well plate to the incubator that will be used for perfusion.",
    "Place the syringe pump and fraction collector in the desired locations near the incubator. Place the syringe pump on top of or near the incubator, and place the fraction collector next to the incubator, near the port.\nBundle together the capped ends of all the upstream and downstream tubes and push them from the outside of the incubator to the inside through the port.\nLoad the syringes into the syringe pump and insert the open ends of the downstream tubes into the dispensing pipette tips of the multi-head dispenser of the fraction collector.\nInside the incubator, pull as much slack of the upstream tubes as possible into the incubator to maximize the length of tubing through which the flowing medium can receive heat and CO2 from the incubator air. While holding these in place, pull the downstream tubes out of the incubator, just enough so that they are able to reach the furthest extended point on the fraction collector while still keeping the capped ends inside the incubator.\nFor each plugged well, quickly uncap the needles and the upstream and downstream tubes for that well and attach them together with their Luer connectors.\nOnce all parts are connected, briefly run the syringe pump at a relatively high speed to ensure that all streams are flowing properly.\nAt this point, if it is desired to begin the experiment with the downstream tubes full of the medium, continue running the pump until all are filled. Otherwise, stop the pump.\nSet the syringe pump flow rate and the frequency of fraction collection and start both machines simultaneously to begin the experiment. Collect fractions for the desired experiment duration.\n5. Set up the perfusion system with a stopcock for multiple medium sources\nPerform all sub-steps of step 4.1 above.",
    "Prepare the two media to be used in the perfusion, labeling the medium that will be dispensed first as 1, and the other as medium 2.\nFor each culture to be perfused, fill one syringe with enough medium 1 for the duration of its dispensation, plus enough volume to initially fill the perfusion system. Fill a second syringe with enough medium 2 for the duration of its dispensation.\nConnect both syringes to two of the three ports of a four-way stopcock.\n\tNOTE: A length of tubing to connect the syringes to the stopcocks may be required.\nPrepare the stopcock and syringes in a similar manner as steps 3.1.7-3.1.8 above by closing the stopcock to medium 1 and dispensing medium 2 into the stopcock until it just begins to drip out the open port.\nClose the stopcock to medium 2 and dispense medium 1 into the stopcock until all residual medium 2 has been flushed out of the open port.\nAttach the upstream tubing to the open stopcock port using a female-to-barb Luer connector. On the other end of the tube, insert a male-to-barb Luer connector.\nDispense medium 1 from the syringe until the upstream tube is entirely filled with medium.\nProceed with steps 4.3-4.11 above, loading both syringes into separate syringe pumps and only dispensing medium 1.\nSet the syringe pump flow rate for medium 1 and the frequency of fraction collection, and start both machines simultaneously to begin the experiment.\nWhen the medium source is to be changed, quickly stop the syringe pump for medium 1, turn the stopcock closed to medium 1, and start the syringe pump for medium 2. If desired later, switch the source back to medium 1 in a similar manner.\nCollect fractions for the desired experiment duration.",
    "6. Set up the perfusion system with a stirred tank to mimic pharmacokinetics\nObtain pharmacokinetic data for the drug of interest and ensure that it consists of a concentration peak followed by an exponential decay.\nAfter setting the peak to time 0 and removing data points prior to the peak, use the Stirred_Tank_Fit.m script (Supplemental File 6) to fit the stirred tank RTD equation to the data. Input v (the desired perfusion flow rate) and the data to be fit as a pair of vectors directly into the script, along with t and C for time values and concentration values, respectively. Run the script to print the parameter V, which is the required stirred tank volume.\nPlan a layout for the perfusion system to include two syringe pumps and a plate shaker upstream of the incubator.\nMeasure the RTDs of the perfusion system components beyond the stopcock and perform signal convolution of the RTDs with various drug pulse durations and concentrations to find an appropriate pharmacokinetic profile. Use the fit stirred tank RTD equation in this calculation.\nProceed with steps 5.1-5.8 above.\nUse an additional well plate of appropriate size as the stirred tank for the setup. Each well may serve as a stirred tank for one perfused culture. Fill the well with the required volume of medium, V, and plug the well with the needles initially pulled up, then pushed to the bottom of the well, and cap the needles.\nLoad the syringes into the syringe pumps and quickly connect the tubing from the syringes to the capped inlet needles of the stirred tanks. Then connect the cell culture upstream tube inlets to the outlet needles of the stirred tanks.\nProceed with steps 5.9-5.10.",
    "At the desired time, switch to dispensing medium 2 containing the drug, as described in step 5.11. Switch back to medium 1 when the drug infusion is complete.\nProceed with step 5.12.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63935/63935fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: The multi-head dispenser.
