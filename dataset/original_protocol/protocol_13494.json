    "1. Preparation of starch samples\nPrepare two (or three) gram-scale replicate starch samples from starch-accumulating tissues of various plant species following the established procedures (e.g., potatoes15, sweetpotatoes28, wheat grains13,29, and maize kernels30, etc.).\nThoroughly wash starch samples with acetone or toluene 3-4x to minimize granule aggregates and dry them completely.\n\tNOTE: Use extraction procedures that yield more than 1 g of starch per preparation. One or two 0.5-g aliquots from each of the three or two replicate extracts, respectively, are sampled for granule sizing analysis of one starch extract.\n2. Electrolyte preparation\nPrepare 500 mL of 50 g/L lithium chloride in methanol for four sizing runs for replication starch samples (100 mL per run plus an extra 100 mL). Preferably, make the electrolyte in large-volume batches, e.g., 4 to 8 L at a time, to minimize the concentration variation.\nCool the container on ice or in a 4 °C cabinet to speed up dissolution of the lithium chloride.\n3. Setting up the analyzer\nChoose an aperture tube with a particle diameter range covering the known (in the literature or through trial runs) granule size range of starch samples to be analyzed, e.g., a 100 μm aperture for sweetpotato starches. For starch samples of unknown granule size range, select an appropriate aperture through trial runs using several aperture tubes having overlapping particle diameter ranges.",
    "NOTE: The particle diameter range of an aperture tube is its accurate sizing range between 2 to 60% of, and with an extended sizing range to 80% of its orifice diameter. Table 1 lists properties of three most useful aperture tubes for sizing granules of major crop starches. If the granule size range of a starch sample is wider than the sizing range of a single aperture tube, perform a multi-tube overlap analysis combining up to five particle size distributions measured with apertures of different sizes. Each aperture is identifiable by its diameter and part number labeled on the tube. Its diameter and serial number contained in a barcode on the tube can be scanned into the analyzer software using the Bar Code Reader on the Control Panel of the analyzer.\nChose a 100 or 200 mL analytical beaker (over cuvettes) for the determination of starch granule sizes, and set up automatic stirring (below) to maintain a good granule suspension during measurement.\nCreate a Standard Operating Method (SOM) to specify run settings, and a Preferences file for analyzing, viewing, and printing the results. Combine SOM and Preferences file into a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) as needed.\n\tNOTE: For non-standardizable analyses, use SOM to run the analyses, and adjust the SOM settings between runs through the Edit the SOM window (see below) as needed. After run completion, analyze, view, and print the run results by changing the Preferences as desired. For standardizable granule sizing analyses, use an SOP to run the analyses.",
    "Start the analyzer software. On the Main Manu, click SOP | Create SOM Wizard or Edit the SOM, or on the Status Panel, click Edit SOM. Use the wizard or the Edit the SOM window to select settings for an SOM. Settings typically used for sizing granules of sweetpotato starch samples are summarized in Table 2.\nSave the created SOM to a File in the SOM Wizard-Summary of Settings window, or in the Edit the SOM window.\nOn the Main Manu, Click SOP | Create Preferences Wizard or Edit Preferences. Use the wizard or tabs in the Preferences edit window to select preference settings as those in Table 3 or others as desired.\nSave the selected Preferences to a file in the Create Preferences Wizard-Summary of Settings window or in the Edit Preferences window.\nOn the Main Menu, click SOP | Create SOP Wizard. Following the step-by-step guide of the wizard, enter a description, select the SOM and Preferences file to create and save an SOP.\n4. Granule sizing analyses of the starch samples\nPrepare the Analyzer\n\t\nTurn on the analyzer, open the software in the computer and verify the Ready status at the top of the Status Panel after its automatic connection to the analyzer.\nFill the electrolyte jar with electrolyte, empty the waste jar if necessary.\nProperly install and secure the chosen aperture tube following the guide in the user’s manual. For an uncalibrated new aperture tube, calibrate it following the step-by-step guide under Calibration | Calibrate Aperture on the Main Menu. For a calibrated aperture tube, verify the calibration following the step-by-step guide of the Change Aperture Tube Wizard under the Run or Calibration | Verify Aperture Calibration on the Main Menu.",
    "Unlock the assay platform by pushing the lock-release clip (on the middle front of the left sample compartment wall) and manually lower the platform to the bottom. Place an analytical beaker containing 100 mL of electrolyte on the platform, move the stirrer to the stirring position, and manually raise the platform to the self-locking upper position to immerse the aperture tube and stirrer in the electrolyte.\nClick Fill on the bottom instrument Toolbar to have the analyzer automatically fill the system with the electrolyte and click Flush to have the analyzer automatically flush the system.\nLoad the SOM by clicking SOP | Load an SOM on the Main Menu, and use the SOM to run an analysis without a Preferences file. Alternatively, load an SOP by clicking SOP | Load an SOP on the Main Menu or Load SOP on the Status Panel, and use the SOP to run an analysis.\nIf using an SOP, click SOP | SOM Info or Preference Info on the Main Menu to verify the SOM and Preference settings. Click Sample | Enter Sample Info on the Main Menu or Edit Info on the Status Panel to enter the sample information for the run.\nPrepare starch-methanol sample and sizing suspensions\n\t\nWeigh two or one 0.5 g sample from each of the two or three replicate starch extracts, respectively.\nAdd each of the 0.5 g starch aliquots to 5 mL methanol in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube, and fully disperse starch granules using several pulses of low intensity ultrasound (12–24 W/cm2) from an ultrasonic processor.\nUsing a disposable transfer pipette, apply one small drop of the starch-methanol suspension (~0.2 mL) to the 100 mL of 50 g/L LiCl methanol electrolyte under constant stirring in the beaker. Close the sample compartment door.\nPerform a sizing run",
    "Click Preview in the bottom Instrument Toolbar to start a preview run. On the Status Panel, verify that the dynamically displayed concentration bar is in green, and shows a 5 to 8% nominal concentration range for the suspension.\nClick Stop on the bottom Toolbar to stop the Preview run. If necessary, dilute the starch-electrolyte suspension by replacing an aliquot of the suspension with the electrolyte, and then repeat a Preview run.\n\t\tNOTE: The 5% to 8% nominal concentration range of the suspension is critical for completion of a run without stoppage due to aperture blockage by aggregated granules. If needed, adjust the drop-sample size, and/or the concentration of the starch-methanol suspension to make a new starch-electrolyte suspension having the nominal concentration in the optimal range.\nAfter the verification, click Start on the bottom Toolbar to start the run. The analyzer automatically completes the run once the total count of sized granules, which is displayed along with the run time on the Status Panel in a run, reaches the set Total Count (125,000 or 250,000) by the Control Mode of the SOM. Depending on the suspension concentration (within 5-8% range or lower), a single run takes 2 to 5 min or more.\n\t\tNOTE: When the analyzer automatically detects an aperture blockage per blockage detection settings of the SOM, it will abort the run, flush to unblock the aperture and start a new run. This blockage action is set to maximally repeat for four times before the analyzer cancels the run operation. This run-aborting blockage problem may be overcome by using two technical methods as noted in Table 2 and detailed in the discussion.",
    "If needed, perform a technical repeat run (see Table 2 and detailed in Discussion) using the same starch-electrolyte suspension by simply clicking Start or Repeat on the bottom Toolbar.\nAfter completion of a run or repeat runs, empty the beaker, rinse it with methanol, and refill it with 100 mL fresh electrolyte solution for the next run.\nDuring a run, if an Extended Size Range notification dialog appears when the count of granules larger than 60 µm exceeds 0.1% of the total count (per the SOM setting), click Run 60% to 80% for running an extended dynamic sizing range to 80% of the aperture diameter.\n\t\tNOTE: The Extended Size Range setting controls actions for granules larger than 60% of the aperture diameter (100 µm, in this case). The setting in the SOM specifies inclusion of starch granules larger than 60 µm when their counts reach over 0.1% of the total count. The completion of the run is still controlled by the total count, and may take slightly less time than otherwise without inclusion of the larger granules totaling less than 0.1% (presumed statically insignificant amount) of the total count.\nAnalyze the run results\n\t\nIf an SOM was used to control the runs, select Preferences settings as desired for viewing, printing, and statistical analyses of the results using the Create Preferences Wizard or the Edit Preferences under the SOP on the Main Menu.\nOverlay results from multiple runs on a single graph for comparison.\n\t\t\nClick Overlay on the Main Toolbar or File | Overlay on the Main Menu to access the Overlay window. Navigate to and select multiple desired result files in the Files box, click Add to move them to the Selected Files box, and click OK to overlay the selected results on a single graph.",
    "To add a file to an open overlay, click RunFile | Open for Overlay on the Run Menu to access the Overlay window, navigate to the desired file, and click to add.\nAverage results from replicate analyses (2 extracts x 2 starch-sampling or 3 extracts x 1 starch-sampling), and view or print the average granule size distribution and statistics in a list or graph.\n\t\t\nOn the Main Menu, click File | FileTool | Average to open the Average window. Navigate to and select multiple desired result files in the Files box, click Add to move them to the Selected Files box, and click OK to average the selected results and display the average on a single graph.\nTo include an additional result file in an average distribution, on the Run Menu, click RunFile | Open and Add to Average to open the Add to Average window, navigate to and add the file. The new average appears on the graph in the Run (result) window or listing.\n5. Specifying the average distribution\nIn the Run-Menu window displaying the average distribution, click Calculate | Averaged Statistics on the Run Menu to open the statistics summary window, which displays the average statistics in rows, and the graph statistics for the average distribution in the columns.\nUse the graphic geometric mean (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61586/61586eq1.jpg) and S.D. (s*) in the graph statistics column to specify the average distribution in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61586/61586eq1.jpg x/ s* form. Calculate the CV measuring variations among the averaged replicate distributions by dividing the mean (µ, the same as the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61586/61586eq1.jpg of the average distribution) of the geometric means of the averaged distributions with the average S.D. (σ) listed in the average statistics row.",
    "NOTE: The average S.D. (for µ) assessing variations among the means of the replicate distributions is different from the graphic geometric S.D. (for imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61586/61586eq1.jpg) measuring the spread of the average distribution.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
