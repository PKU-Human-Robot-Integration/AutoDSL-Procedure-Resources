    "All experiments were approved by an ethical committee at the Federal Ministry of Science and Research of the Republic of Austria (BMWF-80.104/2-BrGT/2007 and BMWF-66.010/0037-II/3b/2013), or ethics commission of the Medical University of Graz, number 28-549 ex 15/16, and conducted according to the Directive of the European Communities Council of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September2010 (2010/63/EU). The animal experiments were designed and performed in such a way that the number of animals used was minimized.\n1. Dissection and Fixation of the Tissue\nEuthanize mice (21 weeks old, female C57BL/6J mice and C57BL/6N mice; male WT and NPY KO mice on a mixed C57BL/6:129/SvJ (1:1) background respectively) by injecting 150 mg/kg pentobarbital intraperitoneally.\nRemove the brains from the skull and immediately cut them in half (separating the left from the right hemisphere) - using a scalpel.\nImmediately place the halves into glass containers with 2% formaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (CH3)2AsO2Na·3H2O, pH adjusted to 7.4 with 1M NaCl), pH 7.4 at 4 °C.\n\tCAUTION: The fixatives are toxic and should be handled with great care. Use only with protective gloves and under the fume hood.\nFix the brain halves for 2 days at 4 °C and rinse in the same buffer for at least 24 h, also at 4 °C. The volume of the buffer should be at about tenfold the specimen volume.\n2. Identify the Region of Interest within the Brain by Comparing Vibratome Sections with Reference Sections from the Mouse Brain Atlas10\nPlace the brain sample onto a vibratome. Ensure that the orientation of the brain is correct (in this case, a coronal orientation was chosen for the hippocampus).",
    "Trim until the region of interest (ROI) in the brain is reached. Cut the sections at a large thickness (e.g., 100 µm) until the part of the brain with the region of interest is reached and throw away every section.\nStart to cut the vibratome sections with 20 µm thickness at the beginning of the brain part with the ROI and place the vibratome sections on a glass slide. Stain them (Nissl stain) by placing the sections into 0.05% thionine acetate in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2 for 1 min (Figure 1Ai).\nCompare the stained sections with the mouse brain atlas using a light microscope and continue cutting and staining until the desired brain coordinates are reached.\n3. Obtaining a Sample Region for Embedding\nAs soon as the right area is identified, start cutting one section at 150 µm thickness with the vibratome.\nMicrodissect this vibratome section with a razor blade under the stereo microscope. Cut away the parts around the ROI. The section should have a suitable size for the following preparation steps for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (not bigger than 1 x 1 mm2).\n4. TEM Preparation - Embedding, Ultra-Thin Sectioning and Staining\nEmbedding\n\t\nPost-fix for 2 h in 2% osmium tetroxide at room-temperature (RT). Use a volume to cover the sample with at least 10 times the sample volume, but avoid using excess fixative to prevent unnecessary toxic waste.\n\t\tCAUTION: Osmium tetroxide is highly toxic and should be handled with great care. Use only with protective gloves and under the fume hood.\nDehydrate using EM Grade alcohols in steps of 20 min. Use a greater volume than that in the previous step (50%, 70%, 80%, 96% and 100% ethanol).",
    "Place in propylene oxide for 40 min at RT. Place into a mixture of propylene oxide/embedding resin (1:2) for 2 h at RT and 1:3 overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: Propylene oxide is highly toxic and should be handled with great care. Use only with protective gloves and under the fume hood.\nEmbed the samples in 100% resin by changing the resin 2 times after 60 min and once after 90 min (all at 45 °C).\nFinally, place the samples into the proper molds and let the resin polymerize at 90 °C for 3 days (Figure 1Aii).\nTrimming and Sectioning on an ultramicrotome.\n\t\nTrim the block, ensuring that the sides are as smooth as possible for the sections to adhere to each other (Figure 1Aiii).\nProduce 55 nm ultra-thin serial sections (should be silver grey) using an ultramicrotome. Use a slot grid (slot width 1 x 2 mm) coated with pioloform (Figure 1Aiv).\nCounterstain ultra-thin sections on the slot grids using 2% uranyl acetate for 30 min and lead citrate for 30 s at RT (this is standard electron microscopy method11).\n\tCAUTION: Uranyl acetate is highly toxic and any direct contact should be avoided. Handle only with protective gloves. Lead nitrate is toxic if swallowed or inhaled and should be handled with great care.\n5. Imaging of Corresponding ROIs on the Reference and Look-Up Sections on TEM with Software Packages\nExamine the sections on the grid with the TEM using a low magnification (depending on the size of the sections) for orientation and to evaluate the quality of the sections.",
    "Start the software (a package of TEM Image Analysis Software, or TIA, supplied with microscope) to generate virtual images of the sections by storing the corner points of the sections. That allows the software to find the corresponding positions of the ROI on each section.\n\t\nGo to Section and choose Insert to add the corner points for the reference and look-up section. Follow the instructions of the pop-up window. Start with the reference section and then continue with the look-up section. Make sure that the edges of the section which are parallel to the next section as points 1 and 2 (Figure 1Bi) are entered.\nVisualize the reference section under low magnification to identify the region of interest and move the microscope stage using TIA on the reference section to multiple corner points of the ROI to create an outline of the ROI.\nRecord the coordinates of the resulting polygon using RPS software. For this, press Add coordinates in the dialog box of the RPS software at each point of the polygon that is needed to outline the ROI in the section (Figure 1Bii).\nDefine and enter a suitable size for the sampling areas and distances between the areas into RPS software (in the presented study, the size of the sampling areas is 7 µm and the distance between them is 20 µm, resulting in at least 20 sampling areas within the ROI). Press Calculate Raster, then the software generates sampling area coordinates in a systematic uniform random fashion for the micrograph's positions within the polygon (Figure 1Biii).\n\t\tNOTE: For better orientation, the polygon and the sampling areas within the polygon can be displayed by the RPS software (Figure 1Biv).",
    "Store the sampling points on the reference and look-up section using the RPS software and TEM Serial Section software. These are the coordinates of the montages which are recorded afterwards11.\n\t\nIn the RPS software, press Go to next position to move the microscope stage to x/y coordinates of each sampling area in the reference section. Go to Location and Insert to import these coordinates in the software in the reference section. Repeat this for all coordinates.\nTo mirror the coordinates from the reference section onto the look-up section, go to Section and press Go to Section. Enter the number of the look-up section (usually '2') in the dialog window.\nFor the recording of the montages (see next step), switch between the reference and look-up section as described before and change the position on the reference section with Location and Go to Number. Choose the next coordinate in the dialog window.\nFor the SerialEM montages at each sampling coordinate, go to File and choose New Montage from the drop-down menu. Select the right number of tiles and percentage of overlap in the dialog window. For the present study, a magnification of 5000X is sufficient to recognize the synaptic features under study, but the limited field of view of the CCD camera required making montages of 2 x 2 images. The montages are made with the SerialEM.\nBefore recording each montage, readjust the focus (or, if possible, activate the autofocus option in the recording software). Choose the folder to save the montage file and start the recording of the montage by pressing Start in the montage submenu on the left in SerialEM.\n6. Analyze the TEM images with ImageJ  To Document Ultrastructural Features.\nNOTE: For this, it is important to create an aligned image stack from the reference and look-up section.",
    "Convert the image-pairs with ImageJ Images to Stack into a stack file and align the images with StackReg (has to be installed from BIG-EPFL http://sites.imagej.net/BIG-EPFL/; in the present case, the algorithm Affine was used). To obtain the numerical densities of cellular structural features, the custom-made ImageJ macro Disector generates a counting frame with a size of 5.5 x 5.5 µm placed randomly over the image with a random angle.\nStart the macro Disector (location in the ImageJ menu depends on the directory where it is saved) and define the parameters (size of the counting frame, number of segments) as needed (Figure 1Cii).\nCount the number of synapse/µm2 using the Disector. Count every synapse within the counting frame that is visible in the reference section, but not visible in the lookup section. Omit those synapses that intersect with the two 'forbidden lines' of the disector; but do count synapses on the opposite 'acceptance lines'. For this, use the Multipoint Tool located in the Toolsbar in ImageJ (Figure 2A, Figure 2B).\nFor measuring synapse parameters, select only the synapses with a synaptic cleft oriented in cross section (on the reference section; within the same image frames used for the disector).\n\t\nStart the plugin ObjectJ in ImageJ from the drop-down menu (Figure 2A) via Plugins | Analyze. Open a new project from the ObjectJ drop-down dialog. This will open a window that allows the user to outline and mark structures with Marker Tool (Figure 2B, red circle). The synaptic parameters used for the experiments presented here are described in the following steps.\nMeasure the length of the presynaptic membrane and postsynaptic density length by drawing a line along the structure using the Marker Tool (Figure 2B, red circle).",
    "Obtain the mean width of the synaptic cleft by drawing a polygon covering both the pre- and postsynaptic membrane, with straight parallel sides and a segmented line midway, equidistant to both membranes.\nFor determining the number of docked vesicles, count all vesicles that have a maximum distance from the presynaptic membrane of one vesicle diameter or less.\nFor determining the number of undocked vesicles, count those vesicles with a maximum distance of one vesicle diameter from docked or other undocked vesicles at the same synapse.\n7. Producing Semi-Thin Sections for Light Microscopy to Document Macroscopic Features (in the present case the cell number) within the Same ROI as Chosen for the TEM Investigation.\nImmediately after cutting the ultra-thin sections for TEM, cut two semi-thin sections, 0.5 µm thick and immediately adjacent to each other. Place on a glass slide and stain them using 0.5% toluidine blue solution. Place a cover slip on the sections (with DPX mounting medium, consisting of distyrene, a plasticizer (tricresyl phosphate), and xylene). These two sections are used to count the cell numbers.\nPhotograph the semi-thin sections at low magnification using a light microscope.\n\tNOTE: The structures under investigation must be identifiable in the images. In the present study, 20X magnification was used to identify cell bodies. If necessary, multiple images can be stitched together with an image processing software.\nAlign the pairs of two consecutive semi-thin sections with an image processing software (e.g., ImageJ).\n\tNOTE: Differences of rotation and size (can occur due to compression artefacts introduced by the sectioning process) should be adjusted for a perfect overlay of the two sections.",
    "Mark the border of the ROI on the light microscopy image. The ROI must correspond to the ROI used for the TEM images. For this purpose, load the images into ImageJ and choose the polygon selection from the Toolsbar (Figure 2A).\nGenerate a grid over the whole image using ImageJ by opening Analyze | Tools | Grid and set the parameters as needed.\nCalculate the area and volume of the polygon from the number of grid-points within the area of interest and section thickness (Volume = NCS * AGS * hST ; NCS = Counted Cross sections; AGS = Grid Size; hST = Section thickness).\nCount the number of nuclei from neuronal cell bodies within the ROI if they are only present on one section. Choose Multipoint Tool in ImageJ from the Toolsbar and mark the cells. After counting the cells on each section, calculate the number of cells per volume (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58745/58745eq1.jpg; CDensity = Cell density; CCount = Cell Count).\nRecord all the measurements in the ObjectJ Results window (Figure 2C). Export and save them for further use.\n8. Using SerialEM Script to Optimize Elemental Analysis in Brain Samples in Combination with DigitalMicrograph (DM, supplied with imaging filter).\nTuning of Imaging Filter (GIF).\n\t\nLoad the sample into the TEM and go to a hole in the sample for the GIF tuning using the trackball or the joystick of the microscope.\nSwitch to Energy Filtered TEM (EFTEM) in DM software /or DM and select CCD camera in DM.\nChoose the magnification for the elemental analysis (the magnification depends on the structure/area of interest; in the present case, the magnification is set from 76 k up to 125 k). Set the exposure time to 0.001 s and start VIEW.",
    "Focus the beam carefully until the edges can be seen and center the beam in the image. Reduce C2/the objective aperture until the edges of the aperture are visible and center the beam with the trackball for the beam.\nDefocus the beam (around C2 46.2%, exposure time for tuning should be around 0.05 s) and find the zero loss peak (ZLP) by pressing the ZLP button. Start the tuning procedure by pressing the Full tune button.\nGet random points of acquisition.\n\t\nSwitch back to TEM imaging mode and select the Camera and check the focus at magnification 10 k (adjust z-axis and set defocus to zero).\nSelect LM 75X magnification and check if the camera is not inserted (otherwise it cannot be controlled by SerialEM software).\nStart SerialEM and open a new project.\nOpen the navigator. Check the settings for the camera in Camera & Script Controls (for VIEW and RECORD) and start VIEW (camera is inserted automatically).\nTo make a corner map of the ultra-thin section, choose Add points in the Navigator window.\n\t\t\nSet the corner points at the edges of an ultra-thin section. Move the stage to a corner point by holding down the right-mouse-key. When a corner of the section is reached, add a corner point with left-mouse-click. Repeat the procedure to add 3 more corner points. Make sure that in the navigator window the box C for corner points is ticked for the stored points.\nTo start the corner montage (preferable at magnification LM 75), go to Navigator in the SerialEM menu-bar and choose Montaging & Grids and Setup Corner Montage from the drop-down menu.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The best fitting settings for the chosen record parameters are displayed. Change them if needed. In the present case, only the overlap percentage was changed to 20%.",
    "Outline the section/ROI on the montage image. Choose Add Polygon in the navigator window and outline the section with multiple right-mouse-clicks. Choose Add grid of points in the navigator drop-down menu and define a distance between the points (the distance depends on the experimental question; e.g., 10 µm, Figure 3).\nFollow the script commands. Enter the number of grid points as shown in the navigator and enter the number of acquisition points (e.g., 20).\nSet the illumination threshold so that the script can avoid grid bars. Follow the script commands and move the stage manually to cover the field of view by one quarter with a grid-bar. According to the displayed value, enter a threshold illumination value (should be higher than the value displayed).\nWait until the points for acquisition are selected and the cooking routine is finished.\n\t\tNOTE: This takes a long time and can be done overnight; the script sends the microscope into standby after finishing the cooking routine; the cooking routine is important to stabilize the sections in the electron beam.\nEnergy filtered TEM (EFTEM) elemental analysis\n\t\nChoose EFTEM mode in TIA/DM and select CCD camera in DM.\nCenter the beam and follow the script commands that will move the stage to each sampling coordinate.\n\t\tNOTE: The user will be asked if the stage should be moved to the next coordinate.\nAlign the zero loss peak (ZLP) and set C2 to ~46.2%.\nSet the energy at 60 eV (in this case, the value is set for the detection of the Fe M-edge), slit at 10 eV and exposure time at 0.4 s. Insert the slit and set C2 to ~43.9%.\nStart view and focus the image.\nSet C2 to 46.2%, align ZLP and set C2 back to 43.9%.\nAcquire elemental map with elemental specific settings.",
    "NOTE: Default settings can be used in the acquisition dialog, but it is recommended to test these beforehand, if possible; example filtered images are shown in Figure 4.\nSet C2 to 46.2% and acquire thickness map.\nRepeat for all the determined acquisition points (Step 8.3.2-8.3.12).\nFollow the instructions of the script and get the single electron micrographs or montages of the acquisition points. Choose the magnification so that all the (ultra-) structural information is visible/identifiable.\nSave LOG file, navigator and results window and remove the slit.\nClose the valve, remove the sample and shut down the TEM."
