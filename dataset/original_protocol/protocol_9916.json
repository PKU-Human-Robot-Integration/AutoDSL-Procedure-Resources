  "procedures": [
    "This research was exempted from the IRB Review at Ewha Womans University and was assigned protocol number #143-18.\n1. Recruitment of Participants\nPrepare to conduct an online survey.\nNOTE: An online survey was conducted using a survey company in South Korea. The research company has the largest consumer panel with high response rates in Korea. Age and gender distributions in the panel reflect the state of the Korean population. The consumer panel has a high degree of reliability through the verification of real names. Since the research company manages the panel continuously with various innovative methods, the panel’s loyalty toward the research company is high; therefore, survey results obtained by the company are known to be highly reliable.\nRecruit female consumers who have experience shopping for apparel online.\nNOTE: Female consumers in Korea spend a high percentage of income on apparel shopping, and shopping behaviors occur mostly online23. Therefore, selecting this group as participants for this study is suitable.\nSend an invitation email to the participants that includes information regarding the purpose of the study and assurance of the confidentiality of their responses.\nSend guidelines to those who agree to take part in the survey showing how to create trench coats using the customization program (see Figure 1).\nNOTE: To avoid potential situations in which participants may encounter difficulty using the customization program, a moderator from the research company sent the guidelines. Furthermore, the moderator called the participants and explained the customization procedure while participants reviewed the guidelines.\nAsk the participants to capture a screenshot of the created trench coat and provide a price for the coat to ensure that they actually create a trench coat in the customization program.",
    "Send a link that is connected to the e-mass customization program in an existing shopping website when the participants understand the procedure.\nProvide the following scenario to the participants: “Please imagine that you are well-off enough to purchase likable clothing and have to purchase a trench coat to attend an important meeting. You want to create a unique trench coat. While browsing the internet, you come across the perfect apparel website that has a mass customization program”.\nNOTE: This step is required to increase involvement levels and control product type and consumer perception of product price.\nAllow participants 24 h to create a trench coat after reading the scenario.\nNOTE: Participants are free to create a trench coat by choosing a preferred overall style, collar, coat lengths, sleeve length, pockets, fabric, and lining in the case that they will actually purchase it. If they have problems creating a coat in the customization program, they are allowed to call and ask the moderator at any time during the 24 h period.\nActivate the survey link after 24 h so that participants who are ready to take the survey (i.e., those who have finished capturing the screenshot of the trench coat they created) can click on the survey link.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Directions for using the e-mass customization program. Participants of online survey read directions regarding how to create the trench coats using the customization program and follow steps 1–8.

Survey Procedure\nAsk participants to upload the screenshot and price of the trench coat they created to the first page of the survey (see Figure 2).\nNOTE: Only participants who upload the screenshot may access the questionnaire.",
    "Ask participants to complete the online questionnaire regarding perceived benefits, emotional attachment to the customized product, attitude toward the customization program, loyalty intentions, and demographic questions (see Table 1).\nGive a reward to those who complete the survey.\nNOTE: Here, participants received a reward of ₩10,000 (about US $10) for participation. Participants who quit the survey or fail to provide the screenshot and price received ₩1,000 (about US $1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Examples of trench coats created using the e-mass customization program. Participants created trench coats by selecting a preferred collar, length, fabric, etc., followed by uploading a screenshot of the trench coat creation.

Data Preparation\nSave the survey data in an SPSS file as “Data_TOTAL.sav” (see Figure 3), which contains all the responses of survey participants. Delete cases that include missing values. Use the cleaned data to conduct an SEM analysis.\nSeparate the total data into two data files: high and low fashion innovative groups. Use a median split. Sum and average the scores of six items of fashion innovativeness, and calculate the median score of fashion innovativeness (med = 4.17).\nNOTE: Median split is frequently used in psychology and marketing research, and using a median split for a continuous variable to examine group differences is valid24.",
    "Click “Recode into Different Variables” under the “Transform” menu. Create a new variable, “fashion innovative group (FIG)”, by coding “1 (low fashion innovative group)” if the mean score is lower than the median (e.g., median = 4.17), or by coding “2 (high fashion innovative group)” if it is higher than the median (see Figure 4).\nClick “Split into files” under the “Data” menu, double-click the variable “fashion innovative group (FIG)” to move it to the “Split Cases by” field, and assign the “Output File Directory” location to save the files (see Figure 5).\nSave “1.sav” and “2.sav” in the assigned directory. Change the file names to “Data_low fashion innovativeness.sav” and “Data_high fashion innovativeness.sav” to use both for LMA.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Data_TOTAL. The data includes responses of all participants (n = 290) used for SEM analysis.

Running a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)\nConduct a single group CFA with the five-factor measurement model to confirm the convergent validity. Click “Select data file(s) | Data_TOTAL.sav”. Develop the measurement model based on the research questions.",
    "The measurement model includes five latent variables (i.e., extrinsic benefit, intrinsic benefit, emotional product attachment, attitudes toward a mass customization program, and loyalty intentions) and 17 observed variables (three observed variables for extrinsic benefit, three for intrinsic benefit, four for emotional product attachment, four for attitudes toward a mass customization program, and three for loyalty intentions). Set variances of the latent variables as “1” (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). Click “Calculate estimates.”\nCheck the fit indices of the measurement model from results of the single group CFA: goodness-of-fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), normed fit index (NFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig06.jpg\nFigure 6: Model specification for confirmatory factor analysis.

Running an SEM\nTo test the relationships among latent variables, conduct an SEM. Click “Select data file(s) | Data_TOTAL.sav”. Develop the SEM based on the research questions, including five latent variables and 17 observed variables.\nDraw arrows from “Extrinsic_V” and “Intrinsic_V” to “EP_Attachment” and “Attitude_MP,” as well as from “EP_Attachment” and “Attitude_MP” to “Loyalty.” Add three unobserved variables, namely “z1” as a predictor of “EP_Attatchment”, “z2” as a predictor of “Attitude_MP”, and “z3” as a predictor of “Loyalty” (see Figure 8, Figure 9). Click “Calculate estimates”. Check the “Estimates” and fit indices of the model.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig08.jpg\nFigure 8: Model specification for structural equation modeling.

Conducting Invariance Tests for LMA\nTo compare the high and low fashion innovative groups, conduct an LMA based on multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA). Before the LMA, test configural invariance, metric invariance, and scalar invariance between both groups25.\nCreating the multi-group measurement model: create the measurement model (i.e., the model for MGCFA) with two groups named “high” and “low” under “Manage Groups”. Select the data files for the groups in the following manner: “Data_low fashion innovativeness.sav” for the low fashion innovative group and “Data_high fashion innovativeness.sav” for the high fashion innovative group (see Figure 10).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig10.jpg\nFigure 10: Selecting data files for groups. The measurement model for MGCFA was created, and two data files (“Data_low fashion innovativeness.sav” and “Data_high fashion innovativeness.sav”) were uploaded. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig10large.jpg]\nTesting configural invariance\n\tNOTE: If the structure of the measurement models in both groups have the same form (i.e., same dimensions and same patterns of fixed and non-fixed values), the configural invariance is satisfied (see Figure 11). If the fit of the measurement model is satisfactory, proceed to the next step for checking metric invariance26.\n\t\nPerform the CFA with the previously proposed five-factor measurement model for each group. Click “Calculate estimates”. Check the “Estimates” and fit indices of both models. If the fit of both models is satisfactory and the factor coefficients are significant, proceed to the next step.\nConduct MGCFA with the five-factor measurement model as a baseline model. Fix “1” for the factor coefficient from each latent variable to the first observed variable and let free the other factor coefficients. Click “Calculate estimates”.",
    "Check the “Estimates” of the two groups and fit indices of the model. If the fit of the model is satisfactory and the factor coefficients are significant, configural invariance is satisfied. Then, proceed to the next step involving the metric invariance test.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig11.jpg\nFigure 11: Equal dimensions and forms of the measurement models across two groups. (A) Model for the high fashion innovative group and (B) model for the low fashion innovative group. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig11large.jpg]\nTesting metric invariance\n\tNOTE: The test of metric invariance evaluates whether the factor coefficients linking latent variables to observed variables are equal across groups.\n\t\nFor the test of metric invariance, fix the factor coefficients across groups. Enter the same name for the same coefficients across groups (e.g., “a” for Extrinsic_V | E2, “j” for EP_Attachment | EA4, see Figure 12). Click “Calculate estimates”. Check the “Estimates” of the two groups and fit indices of the model.\nConduct a chi-square difference test by comparing the full metric invariance model (i.e., the model with fixed factor coefficients across groups) with the configural invariance model (i.e., the model with free factor coefficients across group). If the chi-square difference is non-significant, the metric invariance is satisfied. Then, proceed to the next step involving the scalar invariance test25,26,27.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig12.jpg\nFigure 12: Fixing the factor coefficients across groups. By entering same name for the same coefficients across groups, the factor coefficients were restrained. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig12large.jpg]\nTesting scalar invariance",
    "NOTE: Scalar invariance means that 1) the same values on the latent construct are associated with the same values on the observed variable and 2) the differences in the means of the observed variables are derived from the mean differences of the latent variables. To test scalar invariance, restrict the intercepts of observed variables so that they are equal across groups28.\n\t\nClick “Analysis properties” under the “View” menu. Click the “Estimation” tab and check “Estimate means and intercepts”. Right-click each observed variable and choose “Object Properties”. Select the “Parameters” tab and enter the parameter names such as “int_e1” and “int_ea1” in the intercept text boxes (see Figure 13).\nConduct a chi-square difference test by comparing the full metric/full scalar invariance model (i.e., the model with fixed intercepts of observed variables and fixed factor coefficients across groups) with the full metric invariance model (i.e., the model with fixed factor coefficients across group). If the chi-square difference is non-significant, the full metric/full scalar invariance is satisfied.\nNOTE: Here, a specific hierarchy (configural invariance test, metric invariance test, scalar invariance test) is used. Once each invariance test is satisfied, conduct the LMA by using the finally selected model (i.e., the full metric/full scalar invariance model).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig13.jpg\nFigure 13: Entering parameter names in the intercept text box.\nPlease click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig13large.jpg]\n7. Running a LMA\nConduct an LMA by utilizing the full scalar/full metric invariance model27,28. To compare the means of latent variables, fix the means of latent variables in one group and let them be free in the other group.",
    "Estimate the mean differences across groups by fixing one of means to zero for a reference group, then estimating the mean values for the other group. Thus, fix the means of all the latent variables in the low fashion innovative group at zero. It is important to ensure that the means of latent variables in the high fashion innovative group are free and their variances in both groups are free (see Figure 14).\nClick “Calculate estimates”. Check the “Estimates” of the two groups and fit indices of the model.\nClick “View text” and check the means of latent variables in the high fashion innovative group under “Estimates” (see Figure 15).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60035/60035fig14.jpg\nFigure 14: Setting the latent variable means and variances. (A) High fashion innovative group and (B) low fashion innovative group.
