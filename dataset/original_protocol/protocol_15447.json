    "1.  Anterior Segment Dissection.\nThe cornea is removed by first making an incision at the limbus into the anterior chamber using a 15° blade (Figure 1).  Then one blade of curved cornea-scleral scissors is inserted into the anterior chamber. Circumferential cuts are made in the cornea, just anterior to the limbus.\n0.12 Colibri forceps and Westcott scissors are used to cut the iris circumferentially anterior to the ciliary body.\nThe lens nucleus is removed with 0.12 Colibri forceps or a 15° blade (supersharp) and the cortex and capsule with forceps.  \n2.  Vitreous Core Aspiration.\nA 23-gauge needle on a 5-cc syringe is inserted into the mid-vitreous (Figure 1).\nApproximately 1  mL or more of vitreous core is gently aspirated.\nThe sample is then placed in a microfuge tube and then into liquid nitrogen.\n3.  Anterior Hyaloid Dissection.\nThe anterior hyaloid is seen as a semi-transparent ring by adjusting the incident light from a goose neck microscope light. Previous aspiration of the vitreous core separates the anterior hyaloid from other structures for easier identification.\nThe sheet of elastic tissue is carefully pulled away from the ciliary body with Colibri or dressing forceps and cut with Vannas scissors. This maneuver is repeated.\nThe sample is then placed in a microfuge tube and then into liquid nitrogen.\n4.  Vitreous Base Dissection.\nUsing 0.12 forceps to stabilize the eye cup, Westcott scissors are used to \"flower\" the eye by making four equally spaced stress-relieving cuts from the ciliary body towards the optic nerve head.\nThe pars plicata of the ciliary body (Figure 2) is removed from each of the quadrants using Westcott scissors.\nThe vitreous base is then grasped on either side of the ora serrata with forceps over the pars plana and the retina (Figure 2).",
    "Continuous traction on the vitreous base is applied with the forceps. Sequential cutting with Westcott scissors extracts a semi-transparent tissue with a \"string of pearls\" appearance as it is excised.\nThe sample is then placed in a microfuge tube and then into liquid nitrogen.\n5.  Vitreous Cortex Removal.\nThe pars plana is excised from each of the quadrants with Westcott scissors by cutting the leaflet approximately 3-mm posterior to the ora serrata (Figure 2).\nBetween the tissue leaflets, the vitreous cortex is visualized as a semi transparent film.\nThe elastic film is either grasped with 0.12 forceps or held by adherence to a Weck-Cel surgical sponge. The vitreous cortex is then pulled away from the retina and excised with Westcott scissors (Figure 1).\nThe sample is placed in a microfuge tube and then into liquid nitrogen. All samples are stored at -80° C until utilized for experimentation.\n6.  Representative Results\nTissue samples can be processed by a variety of methods for specific experiments. In our case, samples were submitted for protein analysis by SDS-PAGE (Figure 3).\n imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2455/2455fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Cross-sectional view of the human eye depicting different substructures of the vitreous body. The most anterior vitreous is a thin collagenous layer called the anterior hyaloid. The vitreous core comprises the entire central region of the vitreous body.  This portion of the vitreous is more aqueous in contrast to the vitreous base, which is viscous enough to be grasped by forceps and is firmly attached to the underlying ciliary body and retina.  Encompassing the vitreous core is a very thin collagenous shell called the vitreous cortex.\n imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2455/2455fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2.  Vitreous base anatomy. The vitreous base is a semi-transparent substructure of the vitreous body located along the ora serrata (white arrows), which is the dividing line separating the ciliary body and retina. The anterior border of the vitreous base extends over the pars plana (white line) of the ciliary body. The posterior border of the vitreous base extends 2-3-mm posterior to the ora serrata (white dash).  To excise the vitreous base, forceps are used to grasp the tissue and pull it away from the underlying ciliary body and retina. Once elevated, Westcott scissors are used to cut along the base.\n imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2455/2455fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.  One-dimensional SDS-PAGE of Vitreous Body Elements. Total protein concentrations for the anterior hyaloid, vitreous base, vitreous core, and vitreous cortex were 11.24, 20.1, 16.61, 14.24 mg/mL, respectively.  Gel electrophoresis was performed at 200 kV for 45 minutes, stained with Flamingo (Bio-Rad), and visualized using a VersaDoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad).  The profiles for the different tissues show several similar bands, indicating either conserved or cross-contaminating proteins, as well as unique bands (asterisk), indicating differentially localized proteins."
