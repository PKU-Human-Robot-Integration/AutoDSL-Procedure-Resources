    "NOTE: Immortalized human mesenchymal stromal precursor cells (SCP-1 cells) were used for the experiments. SCP-1 cells were provided by Prof. Matthias Schieker12.\n1. Expansion of SCP-1 Cells\nPrior to working with the SCP-1 cells, properly clean the working area (designated biosafety cabinet I) with 70% ethanol (v/v) wearing gloves.\nIn the cleaned biosafety cabinet prepare an appropriate volume of cell culture medium by mixing the required components as indicated in Table 1. In order to maintain sterility of the basal medium, add supplements by passing through sterile filters with a pore size of 0.22 µm.\n\t\nTo prevent contamination, prepare medium at least 24 hr before use. In order to test its sterility, incubate 1 ml medium in a cell culture plate without cells in the standard cell culture incubator: 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity. After 24 hr, check medium microscopically using a magnification of at least 200X.\nMaintain SCP-1 cells in a standard cell culture incubator with supportive condition: 37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity.\nFor maintenance and expansion, grow the SCP-1 cells until they reach 80-90% confluency. During this time period culture, change medium every 2-3 days. Upon reaching 80-90% confluency, split SCP-1 cells (in general a 1:2 ratio) to the next passage for expansion or plate for the experiments (as indicated).\nFor splitting the SCP-1 cells, warm the culture medium at 37 °C and thaw trypsin/EDTA using a water bath at 37 °C.\nCompletely aspirate the culture medium from the 80-90% confluent cells and discard it into a waste container.\nWash the cells at least twice with DPBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate buffered saline without magnesium and calcium, pH 7.2).",
    "Pipette an appropriate volume of DPBS onto the cells (5 ml DPBS for a T75 culture flask and 12 ml for a T175 culture flask).\nAspirate DPBS carefully and discard it into a waste container.\nPipette an appropriate volume of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA onto the cells (1 ml DPBS for a T75 culture flask and 2 ml for a T175 culture flask) and incubate for 5-10 min at 37 °C in the standard cell culture incubator with 5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity.\nDislodge the cells by tapping the vessel and ensure all cells are detached from the culture plastic (trypsinization) by observing the floating cells under the microscope.\nInactivate the trypsin reaction by adding 10 ml of culture medium. Mix the trypsin and cells with the medium carefully by repeated pipetting.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a reaction tube and centrifuge at 600 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml culture medium.\nCount the cells by Trypan Blue exclusion method as described in protocol 2.\nSeed the cells depending on the experimental design.\n2. Counting of SCP-1 Cells\nPerform a viable cell count (Trypan Blue exclusion method) of the resuspended cells using a hemocytometer.\nPrior to the cell count, clean the hemocytometer using tap water. Dry the hemocytometer components using a lint free tissue. Assemble it by moistening the cover glass and pressing it inversely onto the two glass runners on each side of the counting area. Ensure that Newtonian rings are seen on the glass runners (Figure 1).\nTake 10 µl of the resuspended cells and mix with 10 µl of 0.1% Trypan Blue solution to obtain a dilution factor of 2.\nLoad 10 µl of the total sample on the pre-cleaned and assembled hemocytometer chamber.",
    "Count the number of live (white/transparent cells) and dead (blue nuclei) cells on the 4x4 squares (see Figure 1B).\nCalculate the total number of cells following the given formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54537/54537eq1.jpg\n3. GFP Transfection of SCP-1 Cells\nNOTE: In order to observe SCP-1 cell growth on and into the knitted titanium scaffold over a certain culture period we marked the cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Overexpression of GFP is achieved by infection with adenovirus particles coding for GFP. Replication incompetent (-E1/-E3) adenovirus particles coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used to infect SCP-1 cells. The virus particles were obtained from Prof. Steven Dooley13 by collecting culture supernatant of recombinant adenovirus (Ad5-GFP) transfected HEK293T cells (Biosafety lab II). Three repeated freeze (-80 °C) and thaw (37 °C in the water bath) cycles ensured that no HEK293T cells remain viable to produce new virus particles. Using this adenovirus seed stock can efficiently infect the SCP-1 cells without producing new virus particles. Thus, the infected cells can be handled in a Biosafety Lab I.\nResuspend the target cells (SCP-1 cells) with a seeding density of 50,000 cells/ml in culture medium. Pipette 2 ml per well into a 6-well tissue culture plate.\nIncubate at 37 °C in the standard cell culture incubator; 5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity, till SCP-1 cells reach a confluency of 70-80%.\n\tNOTE: Confluency depends on the seeding density of the cells. For above stated conditions, SCP-1 cells reach a confluency of 70-80% in 1.5-2 days.\nAt a confluency of 70-80%, without aspirating the culture medium add 100 µl of the adenovirus seed stock per 1 ml of culture medium.",
    "Determine the concentration range individually depending on the amount of virus particles in each virus seed stock preparation. In case the infection efficiency is too low, purify and concentrate virus particles using various commercially available kits.\nIncubate for an hour in the standard cell culture incubator at 37 °C (5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity).\nRemove the culture medium containing the virus seed stock and collect it for disposal. Add fresh culture medium 2 ml per well of a 6-well-culture-plate to replenish.\n\t\nMake sure that prior to disposal, virus particle containing medium is autoclaved.\nEvaluate the intracellular GFP expression (infection efficiency) 24 hr after the infection using a fluorescence microscope with a GFP LED cube/filter set.\n\t\nObserve the cell morphology (Figure 2). Cells detaching from the culture plastic can give false positive results.\n4. Cleaning of Knitted Titanium Scaffolds\nPlace up to 5 scaffolds into a 50 ml reaction tube.\nWash the scaffold (6-7 mm thickness) three times with 30 ml distilled-deionized water for 20 min at room temperature, using rotor conditions (8 x g).\nReplace the distilled-deionized water with 30 ml 1% (w/v) Triton-X-100 solution (dissolved in distilled-deionized water) and then wash the scaffolds once for 20 min at room temperature, using rotor conditions (8 x g).\nDiscard the Triton-X-100 solution followed by washing with 30 ml distilled-deionized water twice (5 min each at room temperature) maintaining rotor conditions (8 x g).\nReplace the distilled-deionized water. Rinse the scaffolds sequentially with reagent grade 99% acetone, 99% isopropanol and 99% ethanol (30 ml each) for 2 x 5 min each in an ultrasonic bath (~ 50 Hz, 50 W, 220-240 V).\nWash again three times with 30 ml distilled-deionized water for 5 min, keeping the ultrasonic bath treatment constant.",
    "Place the scaffolds on a lint-free tissue in order to air dry overnight at room temperature.\nAutoclave the scaffold for 15 min at 121 °C with 15 psi.\nConfirm the cleaning protocol by indirect fluorescence as described in protocol 5.\n5. Imaging Scaffold Structures by Indirect Fluorescence\nNOTE: The present protocol describes the imaging of scaffold structures by indirect fluorescence using the fluorophore sulforhodamine B which gives a bright red fluorescence at an ex/em wavelength of 565/586 nm. However, the fluorophore can be changed to better fit for given microscope settings or possible auto-fluorescence of the scaffold.\nPrepare the sulforhodamine B staining solution (0.04%) in 1% acetic acid and store at room temperature with protection from light.\nTake a 24-well tissue culture plate and immerse the cleaned scaffold in 500 µl of the sulforhodamine B staining solution by placing it inside the well using forceps.\nCapture the negative images of the scaffold using fluorescence microscope.\n\t\nTake pictures with a RFP LED cube/filter set with an excitation wavelength of 531/40 nm and an emission wavelength of 593/40 nm. Alternatively choose the adequate excitation and emission wavelength with the help of the fluorescence spectral viewer20. Sulforhodamine B has its peak excitation at 578 nm and its peak emission at 593 nm.\nIn order to visualize the scaffold structure, take pictures at lower magnifications, e.g., 4X or 10X (Figure 3). Using these pictures, determine characteristics, e.g., the pore size and shape with the help of the ImageJ.\nIn order to detect scaffold impurities, take pictures at higher magnifications, e.g., 20X or 40X, considering that this will limit the analysis depth. Ensure that dirt particles/substances are not seen (see representative results; Figure 3).\n6. In Vitro Biocompatibility Assay\nPre-warm the culture medium at 37 °C in a water bath.",
    "Take a 24-well tissue culture plate and using forceps, place the cleaned and sterilized scaffolds in each test well aseptically. Work under the pre-cleaned biosafety cabinet I!\nSoak/incubate the scaffolds with a culture medium for about 15 min (500 µl per well of a 24-well tissue culture plate), in order to remove air from inside of the scaffold.\nMeanwhile, resuspend 500,000 Ad-GFP-infected SCP1 cells in 1 ml of culture medium.\nAfter 15 min of scaffold soaking, aspirate the medium completely off the scaffold.\nFor seeding the cells on the scaffold, dispense 100 µl of cell suspension carefully on the scaffold (which is placed in 24-well plate) surface. Maintain a minimum volume of cell suspension while seeding the cells, so to ensure no medium flows out of the scaffold.\nIncubate the cells for 30 min at 37 °C in the standard cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity).\nAdd 500 µl more culture medium and incubate for 24 hr in the standard cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity).\nEvaluate the cell adherence pattern and cell spreading on the scaffold surface using a fluorescence microscope.\n\t\nTake pictures with a GFP LED cube/filter set with an excitation wavelength of 470/22 nm and an emission wavelength of 510/42 nm. Alternatively choose the adequate excitation and emission wavelength with the help of the fluorescence spectral viewer. GFP has its peak excitation at 488 nm and its peak emission at 507 nm.\nIn order to visualize cell adherence pattern capture pictures at lower magnifications, e.g., 4X or 10X (Figure 4). In order to observe cell spreading a higher magnification (at least 100X) is needed — limiting the focus depth.",
    "For further evaluating cell spreading on the scaffold surface, fix the cells with 4% formalin and proceed with conventional fluorescence staining of cellular structures, e.g., actin filaments (Phalloidin). However, adapt incubation times and fluorescent labelling of the antibodies in order to fit the individual scaffold characteristics, e.g., diffusion times or auto-fluorescence14.\nThe next day, change the culture medium to remove non-adherent cells.\nCalculate the percentage of adherent cells on the scaffold by resazurin conversion measurement as described in protocol 7.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54537/54537fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Timeline of in vitro assay.

Resazurin Conversion measurement\nNOTE: Resazurin conversion assay is used for measuring the mitochondrial activity and thus indirectly cell proliferation. Resazurin reduction to resorufin generates a fluorescent signal, which is based on the mitochondrial activity associated with viable cell numbers (Figure 7A).\nCompletely aspirate the culture medium from the SCP-1 cells and discard it into a waste container.\nWash the SCP-1 cells once with DPBS to remove detached cells. Add 500 µl DPBS per well of the 24-well tissue culture plate containing SCP-1 cells on the scaffold.\nCover the cells with a required amount of sterile resazurin working solution (0.25% resazurin in culture medium) and incubate at 37 °C in the standard cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity) for 30 min.\n\t\nMake a note that; incubation time depends on the cell type and cell density. It can vary between 10 min and 6 hr. Optimized incubation time for SCP-1 cells is 30 min.",
    "As a background control, include at least one well with the resazurin working solution but without cells, that is incubated at 37 °C in the standard cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity) for the same amount of time.\nTransfer 100 µl conditioned supernatant from each well of the 24-well tissue culture plate into a 96-microwell plate.\nWash the remaining cells three times with 1 ml DPBS for 5 min at room temperature in order to remove residual resazurin working solution. After the third wash add culture medium to the implants with SCP-1 cells (500 µl per well of the 24-well tissue culture plate) and continue incubation at 37 °C in the standard cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 20% O2 and 90% humidity) for further time course measurements.\n\t\nMake sure to set up replicates at this step (2-4) in order to minimize pipetting errors.\nIn the meantime, place the 96-microwell plate into the microplate reader and measure the fluorescence of the formed resorufin.\n\t\nIn order to reduce background signal, measure fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 545 nm and an emission wavelength of 585 nm.\nAlternatively choose the adequate excitation and emission wavelength with the help of the fluorescence spectral viewer. Resorufin has its peak excitation at 572 nm and its peak emission at 585 nm. The given signal intensity is an average of 25 individual readings (25 flashes per well).\nMeasure the fluorescence of formed resorufin in conditioned medium, using a bottom optic.",
    "Make a note that, the gain depends on the average amount of resazurin converted and can vary between 10 and 4,000. Adjust the gain to the individual microplate reader used by pipetting a resorufin standard curve, such that the fluorescent signal is below 80% of the maximum signal intensity detectable (in this case 20,000). The optimized gain for SCP-1 cells is 800.\nSubtract the background signal (resazurin working solution without cells) from signal of the test samples.\nDepending on the experimental setup/purpose, proceed with further steps:\nCalculate the percentage of viability of the cells on the scaffold using a standard curve. Make an individual standard curve separately for each cell line used.\nAnalyze cell growth/proliferation by estimating the relative increase in resazurin conversion throughout the cultivation time. For this calculation, set the resazurin conversion on day 1 as reference. Freshly prepare the resazurin working solution for this kind of analysis. Furthermore, incubation times have to be equal between the different measurements.\nRepeat the entire protocol of resazurin conversion measurement at least three times to get consistent results.\n8. Live-dead Staining\nPlate the SCP1 cells on the scaffold with a seeding density of 50,000 cells/scaffold and allow it to grow on the scaffold keeping the standard cell culture conditions (refer to protocol 1 and 2).\nAfter 24-48 hr completely aspirate the culture medium from the SCP-1 cells and discard it into a waste container.\nWash the SCP-1 cells once with DPBS to remove detached cells. Add 500 µl DPBS per well of the 24-well tissue culture plate and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nStain SCP-1 using fluorophores (all three stains at the same time):\n\t\nFrom now on keep the scaffolds in the dark in order to protect the fluorophores bleaching from daylight!",
    "Set an incubation time to 30 min in order to allow equal distribution throughout the scaffold. If transferring to other scaffolds, make sure to optimize the incubation times to fit the individual scaffold characteristics (pore size, scaffold depth, etc.).\nIn order to detect viable cells on the scaffold, stain the cells with calcein AM at a final concentration of 2 µM (in culture medium).\nIn order to detect all cells on the scaffold, stain the cells with Hoechst 33342 at a final concentration of 0.002 µg/µl (in culture medium).\nIn order to detect dead cells, incubate the scaffold with ethidium homodimer at a final concentration of 4 µM (in culture medium).\nAfter the incubation time, wash the cells 3 times with DPBS (1 ml per well) for each 5 min at room temperature.\nImmediately take pictures by using a fluorescence microscope.\n\t\nTake pictures of the calcein (living cells) with a GFP LED cube/filter set (excitation and emission wavelength of 470/22 nm and 510/42 nm, respectively). Alternatively choose an adequate excitation and emission wavelength with the help of the fluorescence spectral viewer. Calcein has its peak excitation at 488 nm and its peak emission at 507 nm. Note: Ensure not to use GFP transfected cells for fluorescence staining with Calcein or other green fluorescent stains.\nTake pictures of the Hoechst 33342 with a DAPI LED cube/filter set with an excitation wavelength of 357/44 nm and an emission wavelength of 447/60 nm. Alternatively choose the adequate excitation and emission wavelength with the help of the fluorescence spectral viewer. Hoechst 33342 has its peak excitation at 347 nm and its peak emission at 483 nm.",
    "Take pictures of the ethidium homodimer with a RFP LED cube/filter set (excitation and emission wavelength of 531/40 nm and 593/40 nm, respectively). Alternatively choose the adequate excitation and emission wavelength with the help of the fluorescence spectral viewer. Ethidium homodimer has its peak excitation at 530 nm and its peak emission at 618 nm.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
