    "All protocols and experiments were in accordance with the current European guidelines (2010/63/EU) and approved by the regional authorities (Regierungspräsidium Gießen, MR 20/35 Nr.25/2015).\n1. Animals\nHouse male adult Wistar rats (200-250 g) in groups of 3-4 under standard laboratory conditions for at least one week before surgery to allow acclimatization.\nTwo days after surgery, house rats in pairs. Cover single cages with high acrylic lids. Avoid conventional lids made of metal grid since implants can get stuck, increasing the risk that they become damaged and/or unstable over time.\n2. Stereotactic surgery\nBefore starting the surgery, organize and prepare the following equipment and materials:\nObtain sterile surgical equipment consisting of sterile scissors, blunt-end forceps, spatulas, surgical clippers, dental drill, and cotton buds. \nObtain drugs and chemicals including isoflurane, xylocaine, tramadol hydrochloride, dexpantenol eye salve, 3% hydrogen peroxide, povidone iodine and 70% ethanol.\nObtain fixation material including stainless steel screws, acrylic resin, ultraviolet glue and cap protector.\nObtain a microelectrode unit, consisting of (i) a recording single electrode (quartz glass insulated platinum tungsten microelectrode, with conical tip shape, outer diameter: 80 µm, conical tip, impedance at 1 kHz: 500 kOhm) or a tetrode (quartz glass insulated platinum/tungsten 4 cores microelectrode, outer diameter: 100 µm, conical tip, impedance at 1 kHz: 500-800 kOhm); (ii) a stimulation electrode (platinum/iridium wire (90% platinum, 10% iridium), core diameter 125µm, outer diameter 150 µm, impedance <10 kOhm) connected to a contact plate and (iii) a platinum wire reference electrode (shaft diameter, 100 µm; Figure 1A).\nObtain electrode holder glued with water soluble glue to the microelectrode unit and tested for functionality at least 2 h in advance (Figure 1B).\nObtain a conventional tethered system consisting of a differential preamplifier, a main amplifier and a bandpass filter amplifier for recordings.",
    "Obtain additional material, such as gloves, heating pad, syringes, and physiological saline.\nObtain home cages (L x W x H: 42 cm x 26 cm x 38 cm).\nProcedure\n\tNOTE: Electrode implantation is performed during a conventional stereotactic surgery under isoflurane anesthesia.\n\t\nEnsure that the experimenter is wearing gloves, surgical mask, and lab coat.\nInitiate anesthesia placing the animal in an induction chamber (isoflurane 4-5%, oxygen flow 1 L/min, duration ~5 min).\nTest for loss of reflexes (tail and toe reflexes) with forceps to confirm deep anesthesia.\nPlace head of the animal in an anesthesia mask fixed around the upper incisor bar of the stereotactic frame and adjust anesthesia (isoflurane 2-3%, oxygen flow 0.7-0.8 L/min).\nFix and horizontally align the animal's head in the stereotactic apparatus using ear bars and upper incisor bar.\nShave the surgical field using surgical clippers or a scissor and sterilize with povidone iodine.\nPlace the animal on a heating pad to prevent hypothermia and treat eyes with dexpantenol eye salve to prevent them from drying.\nInject xylocaine (0.3-0.4 mL, subcutaneously, s.c.) in the center of the surgical field.\nTest for loss of reflexes again.\nMake a small incision (1.5 cm) with a scalpel in the middle of the surgical field to expose the skull. Separate the skin gently and remove residual tissue using forceps, scissor, and spatula.\nCarefully clean the skull using hydrogen peroxide-coated cotton buds.\nDrill 4-5 small holes (4.7 mm) in the skull for fixation of stainless steel screws.\nConnect the microelectrode unit/electrode holder to the preamplifier and attach to the stereotactic micromanipulator (Figure 1B and 1C).",
    "Drill a hole (approximately 7 mm) in the skull above the target area using coordinates from a brain atlas according to the animal used. In the present study, position the electrode tips aimed at the inferior colliculus using the following coordinates, with the bregma serving as the reference: anterior/posterior, −8.8 mm; medial/lateral, 1.5 mm; and dorsal/ventral, 3.5 mm14.\nAbsorb any blood with cotton buds.\nVertically introduce the microelectrode unit until the electrode tips reach the target area.\nPosition the ground cable along the stainless-steel screws and under the skin.\nMonitor spike activity and carefully adjust electrode position with micromanipulator until reaching a zone of active neurons in the target structure and detect neural activity with a signal-to-noise ratio suited for spike sorting.\nFix the microelectrode unit to the skull with ultraviolet glue and cover contact plate and screws with acrylic resin.\nInject physiological saline (1 mL i.p.) and tramadol (25 mg/kg, s.c.) to prevent dehydration and ensure post-operative analgesia, respectively.\nDisconnect the microelectrode unit from the electrode holder using a brush soaked in water.\nStop anesthesia, carefully remove rat from the stereotactic frame. Disconnect the preamplifier from the microelectrode unit.\nConnect the cap protection on microelectrode unit implanted and disconnect it only during the experimental procedures.\nKeep the animals in pairs in the home-cage from the second day after surgery.\nMonitor animals daily for possible wound infection, body weight, health condition, and general behavior for a period of 7 days after surgery. After this recovery period, perform in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: The surgical procedure lasts between 60-90 min. During surgery, tail flick reflexes must be continuously monitored and anesthesia adjusted, if necessary.\n3. In Vivo Electrophysiology\nEquipment and procedure\n\tNOTE: Electrophysiological recordings and stimulation are performed using the TWS.",
    "Obtain a head stage with an integrated preamplifier and connected battery (four recording channels; analog recording input range: 0-12 mV pk-pk; stimulation output: ±625 µA; L x W x H: 24 mm x 22 mm x 12 mm; weight: 6 g without battery, 12 g with battery; battery running time up to 1 h). This head stage is suitable to be connected directly to the implanted microelectrode unit via a miniature multipole connector (Figure 2).\nObtain a battery (lithium ion accumulator, 3.7-4.2 V DC, 230 mAh, 27 mm x 20 mm x 6 mm, 1 h operation time) mounted on top of the head stage (Figure 2C). If necessary use replacement rechargeable battery with capacity of 450 mA for approximately 2.5 h operation time. Make sure that a green light comes on in the head stage while the battery is connected to it.\nObtain a transceiver (receiver-transmitter) connected to a personal computer via standard USB port and allows wireless operation for up to 5 m (Figure 2E).\nObtain a personal computer with TWS software for electrical stimulation and recording of neural activity (Figure 3 and Figure 4).\nObtain a tethered preamplifier and a data acquisition system used during surgery (see item 2.1.5) for recordings, and a stimulus generator for stimulation, in order to compare the efficaciousness of the TWS in awake rats one week after surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: Electrical stimulation is provided and extracellular activity from single neurons is recorded from the same implanted microelectrode unit using both systems. The stimulation parameters (current intensity, pulse and frequency) should be adjusted to each animal according to the brain region targeted. In the present study, a 150-250 µA, 2500 Hz current was used to stimulate the inferior colliculus.\nBehavioral assays",
    "NOTE: Once no metal barrier is introduced between the transceiver and the animal head stage, the TWS is applicable to a broad set of behavioral tasks. As exemplary behavioral tests, it was used in the open field for measurement of general behavioral activity and on the elevated plus maze, a standard test to assess anxiety-like behavior in rodents15. A video camera was placed centrally above open field and elevated plus maze for behavioral recordings.\n\t\nPrior to behavioral testing, handle each animal on three consecutive days (5 min each day). Before each handling period connect the head stage with battery to the microelectrode unit previously implanted. Do not perform any recording or stimulation during handling.\nOpen field\n\t\t\nPlace the rat into the center of the open field (40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm; red light ~30 Lux) and allow it to explore the apparatus for at least 5 min under neural recording.\nDetermine the escape threshold - minimum current intensity producing running or jumping. In the present study, deliver a high-frequency 2500 Hz stimulation (pulse width: 100 µs; pulse interval: 100 µs) to the inferior colliculus in 1 min intervals increasing the current intensity by 20-50 µA steps until rats showed escape behavior.\nReturn the rat to its home cage, clean the open field (0.1% acetic acid solution) and dry it.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In order to compare the stimulation efficacy of the TWS with the traditional tethered system the procedure described above was performed using both systems.\nElevated plus maze",
    "NOTE: The plus-maze used in these experiments was made of gray acrylic and consisted of two open arms (50 cm long x 10 cm wide) and two closed arms (50 cm long x 10 cm wide, with 40 cm high walls) that extended from a central platform elevated 50 cm above the floor16.\n\t\t\nPlace the rat into the center of the plus-maze facing toward an open arm and allow it to freely explore the apparatus under continued recording during 5 min.\nRecord the number of entries into, and the time spent in the open and closed arms over a 5 min period.\nReturn the rat to its home cage, clean (0.1% acetic acid solution) and dry the maze before each test.\nPerfusion and histology\n\t\t\nAnesthetize the rat with xylazine/ketamine (150 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, respectively; i.p.).\nConnect the implanted electrode unit to the stimulation cable and apply electrical stimulation (current intensity 50 µA, pulse width: 100 µs; pulse interval: 100 µs) during 90 s in order to produce a small lesion around the electrode tip.\nDisconnect the stimulation cable and perfuse the animal through the left ventricle with physiological saline followed by 200 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3 (for a detailed description see reference17).\nRemove the brain and immerse it for 4 h in fresh fixative at 4 °C.\nMake sure the temperature of the main cryostat chamber is at -20 °C.\nFreeze the brains on dry ice and cut them into 50 µm serial coronal sections using a cryostat.\nStain the sections with cresylviolet in order to locate the positions of the electrode tips, according to the atlas by Paxinos and Watson14."
