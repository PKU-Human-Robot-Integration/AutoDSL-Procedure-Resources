    "Inoculation and growth of mycobacterial cultures   Inoculate liquid cultures (in either Sauton’s broth or Middlebrook 7H9 broth) of mycobacteria from frozen stocks, prepared from mid-log phase mycobacterial cultures (OD600 = 0.8 to 1.0) that were frozen in 50% glycerol at -80 °C. For inoculation, the doubling rate of the mycobacterial species needs to be kept in mind. M. smegmatis doubles approximately every 3-4 h, whereas BCG and M. tuberculosis double approximately every 24 h at 37 °C.    These pre-cultures are inoculated in 25 ml Sauton’s broth medium (or Middlebrook 7H9 broth) in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks. Include appropriate antibiotics if required for maintaining a plasmid when growing a transformed mycobacterial strain.    The mycobacterial cultures are incubated at 37 °C with no or slow shaking. Measure the OD600 of the culture and harvest exponentially growing mycobacteria (OD600 = 0.8 to 1.0) by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant.   Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of water and transfer the bacterial suspension in 15 ml conical plastic tubes. Pellet the bacterial cells again by centrifugation. This wash step is important to remove the remaining traces of medium. The bacterial pellet is then transferred to a round-bottom glass tube prior to lipid hydrolysis. All subsequent procedures will be performed in glass tubes due to the presence of organic solvents.      Fatty acid/mycolic acid extraction   Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 2 ml of tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxyde (TBAH) and incubate overnight at 100 °C using a heating block. This step allows complete fatty/mycolic acid hydrolysis.   The next day, let the tube cool down at room temperature and proceed with methyl esterification of the fatty/mycolic acids: To the 2 ml of TBAH mixture, add 4 ml CH2Cl2, 300 μl CH3I and 2 ml water.",
    "Mix the tube for 1 h at room temperature on a rotator.   Centrifuge at 3,500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. This will allow to separating the mixture in two phases: A lower organic phase containing the lipids and an upper aqueous phase. Discard the upper phase to waste.   Add 4 ml of water, mix the tube for 15 min and spin down at 3,500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat this wash step 2 more times and remove the upper phase to waste.   Dry the lower organic phase in the same tube under a stream of nitrogen using a TurboVap evaporator. Evaporation of the organic phase takes around 30 min.   To the dried residue, add 3 ml diethylether and sonicate in a waterbath for 10 min at room temperature.   Centrifuge at 3,500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature and, using a Pasteur pipette, transfer the fatty acid/mycolic acid methyl esters in a new glass tube.   Evaporate the diethylether under a stream of nitrogen and resuspend the residue in 100-200 µl CH2Cl2.      Thin layer chromatography   Load 10-30 µl on an aluminium TLC plate using 10 µl capillary tubes (Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141014/20141014233314_7308.jpg Figure 1. Loading the lipid samples with a capillary tube directly at the origin of the TLC plate    Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) and mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMES) are separated by thin layer chromatography in a TLC tank using hexane/ethyl acetate (19:1, v/v). When the solvent front reaches the top of the TLC plate, the plate is taken out, dried very briefly and placed again in the tank for a second round of migration. This allows to better separate the various mycolic acid subspecies.   Spray the TLC plate with 5% ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid using a reagent sprayer in a TLC spray cabinet (Figure 2).",

Homogenous spraying of the TLC plate with molybdophosphoric acid in a spray cabinet    Lipids are revealed following charring using a heat gun, which emits a stream of very hot air. Bands corresponding to the different mycolic acids will appear as represented in Figure 3.      Purification of the mycolic acid subspecies   Mycolic acid methyl esters are loaded on preparative plastic TLC plates and separated, as described above.    Spray the plate with 0.01% ethanolic Rhodamine 6G and visualize the mycolic acid subspecies using a handheld UV lamp.   Scrape off the bands corresponding to the individual mycolic acid subspecies and put the lipid-loaded silica powder into a glass tube.   Extract from mycolic acid with diethyl ether as mentioned above (steps B6-8).   If necessary, resolve again the lipids individually on new preparative TLC plates and repeat the whole procedure.    Evaporate the diethylether under a stream of nitrogen and resuspend the lipids in 100-200 µl CH2Cl2.   Assess purity of the mycolic acid methyl esters on a standard TLC plate as described in steps C1-4."
