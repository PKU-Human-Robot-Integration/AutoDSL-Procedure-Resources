    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMount embryos for imaging\nTiming: 15–30 min\nThis step will prepare a slide ready for time-lapse observations on Day 1. The goal of this step is to transfer embryos from our experimental plates prepared two days before to a slide that contains an agarose pad with M9 buffer. After the coverslip is placed on the samples, vacuum grease is used to seal the edges of the cover slip to keep the moisture of the microenvironment where the embryos are placed. This setting generates a microenvironment that permits C. elegans embryos to develop while being imaged under the microscope.\nUse a microwave oven to melt the 4% agarose solution.\nDispense between 100–300 μL of the melted agarose solution to the center of a slide.\nNote: The melted solution is very sticky, pipette it gently; this will avoid generating bubbles.\nImmediately flatten the agarose drop by placing another glass slide perpendicular to the one holding the drop and press gently.\nLet it stand for 2 min for the agar to solidify completely.\nCarefully separate the two slides by sliding one against the other.\nUsing a glass slide as a blade, cut the agar pad into an approximately 12 × 12 mm square.\nPlace 3 μL of M9 buffer at the center of the agar pad.\nUnder a stereotype microscope and a worm pick, collect between 50-80 embryos with a worm pick and transfer them into the drop of M9 in the agarose pad.\nNote: Our protocol does not required synchronization of hermaphrodites. On every agar pad we collect between 50 to 80 embryos from a mixed staged worm plate. The number of embryos ensures that at least some of them will be at the right stage and orientation for live imaging.",
    "Squeeze a thin line of high vacuum grease around the agarose pad.\nPlace a cover slip over the grease and with the tip of a P10 pipette press the corners first and then the remaining grease to seal the slide.\nCritical: When transferring embryos from the plate to the agar pad, make an effort to carry as little bacteria as possible. An excessive amount of bacteria in the sample mix will consume large quantities of oxygen and cause the arrest of embryonic development. See Troubleshooting Problem 2.\nTime-lapse recording of the acidification status of the C1, C2, and C3 phagosomes\nTiming: 2–6 h\nThe goal of this step is to monitor the acidification process of phagosomes in developing embryos. We measure the acidification index of engulfed apoptotic cells C1, C2, and C3 over time by following the Phis-72 his-72::gfp::mCherry reporter, which labels the nuclei of C1, C2, and C3 as well as nuclei of all other cells in the embryo. C1, C2, and C3 are identified by their fixed positions on the ventral surface of an embryo (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C) (See “Notes” below for how to identify the embryos with the ventral surface facing the objective). The 0 min time point is determined by the appearance of the ¨bottom-like¨ structure under the DIC optics (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C, 1D, and 1E). At each time point, the mCherry and GFP signal intensities are measured at the center of the phagosome (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E). The acidification index at a particular time point is defined as the ratio of GFP/mCherry signals over the GFP/mCherry ratio at the 0 min time point (T0) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). The acidification index of 1.0 indicates no phagosome acidification compared to the T0 value.\nSet up the microscope parameters (5 min).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2731_4.csv",
    "Under 20× objective, identify the embryos that carry the fluorescent reporter (which are GFP+ and mCherry+) and at the mid-embryonic developmental stage (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) (15 min).\nUnder the 100× objective (Numerical aperture 1.35), identify embryos that are between 320-330 min post-1st cleavage (the 1st embryonic cell division) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2731-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Distinct morphological features allow the identification of the ventral and dorsal sides of an embryo\nDIC images of an embryo at one moment between 320-330 min post the 1st cleavage (the first embryonic cell division). Scale bars are 10 mm.\n(A and B) The same image of the ventral side of an embryo.\n(C and D) The same image of the dorsal side of the same embryo.\n(B, D) The ventral (B) and dorsal (D) hypodermal cells, the distinct organization patterns of which allow the viewer to distinguish the ventral from the dorsal surfaces, are highlighted in purple.\nNote: It is imperative that the embryos to be imaged are with their ventral side facing the microscope objectives. The arrangement pattern of the hypodermal cells, which are highlighted in (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2D) can be used as a guide to determine the orientation and stage of the embryo (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The hypodermal cells on the ventral side of an embryo appear to extend towards the center of an embryo in symmetric pairs (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B), whereas those on the dorsal side of an embryo line up in a column (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nUsing the ¨point mark¨ and the ¨position visiting¨ functions of the Softworx 5.5 software to mark and visit the embryos to be recorded. We usually record 3 or fewer embryos in the same experiment (20 min).",
    "Define the Z-position where the z section recording should start. The serial z section recording is performed from the embryo’s ventral surface and proceeds to the center of the embryo (5 min for each embryo).\nTo cover the depth of three phagosomes (C1, C2, and C3) and providing enough depth even when the focal planes alter over time during the recording period, 12–16 sections of 0.5 μm Z-interval are recorded.\nStart recording when the embryo reaches 320 min post-1st embryonic cell division.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2731-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The scale bar is 5 μm.\nNote: Usually, we set our time interval of the recording to 3 minutes for 60–120 min or until the embryo reaches the 1.5-fold stage (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).
