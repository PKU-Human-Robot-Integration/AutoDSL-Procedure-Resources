    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1: Preparing the cells\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis section includes the steps for culturing the cells on the coverslips and preparing them for immunostaining.\nCoverslips preparation:\nPut 12 mm diameter coverslips in P24 culture plate wells.\nAdd 90 μL of commercial poly-L-Lysine solution for 1 h (as a tip to save time, during this step, step 2 might be conducted in parallel).\nWash three times using PBS.\nCells trypsinization:\nTake the culture medium carefully from the flask.\nWash once using pre-warmed 5–10 mL PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of trypsin and incubate for 3 min at the cell culture incubator.\nAdd 4 mL of pre-warm fresh culture medium and harvest the cells. Eliminate the trypsin by centrifugation 300 × g for 3 min and suspend the cells in pre-warm fresh medium.\nCritical: Cells must be carefully and thoroughly suspended before counting and seeding. Clamped cells will make the ulterior fluorescence analysis very difficult.\nCells adhesion on the coverslip.\nSeed 8 × 104 cell/mL in the P24 plate from step 1. Spread the cells by performing round movements assuring a homogeneous cell distribution on the coverslip.\nIncubate for 24 h in the cell incubator until reaching at 60%–70% confluency.\nCritical: It is essential not to go further than 70% confluence. Seeded amount will vary depending on the cell line and the experiment.\nCells fixation:\nAspirate the culture medium carefully.\nAdd 0.5 mL of p-formaldehyde 4% (v/v).\nIncubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nWash three times using 0.5 mL of PBS.\nPause point: Coverslip containing fixed cells can be stored in PBS at 4°C for no more than a week or move forward with the immunostaining.\nStep 2: Polyphosphate immunostaining\nTiming: 20 h",
    "This section describes the immunostaining method for polyP detection using Xpress tagged PPBD, its visualization by confocal microscopy and further quantification.\nBlocking and immunostaining:\nBlocking: Incubate the coverslip containing the cells for 1 h without shaking in 0.5 mL of blocking buffer (PBS containing goat serum 2.5% (v/v) and Tween20 0.5% (v/v)).\nPPBD and anti-Xpress antibody pre-incubation: mix anti Xpress antibody (5 μg/mL final concentration) and recombinant 6×His-Xpress-PPBD (20 μg/mL final concentration) in blocking buffer and incubate them for 1 h at 4°C in a rotating shaker.\nRemove the blocking solution and add 250 μL of the above PPDB and Xpress antibody mix. Incubate for 16 h at 4°C.\nWash three times for 5 min using 0.5 mL of PBS at 20°C with gentle agitation.\nIncubate with 0.5 mL of the Alexa Fluor 488 or 633 secondary antibody (1:1000) in blocking solution for 1 h at 20°C in gentle agitation.\nWash three times for 5 min using 0.5 mL of PBS at 20°C in gentle agitation.\nHoechst staining. Add 0.5 mL of Hoechst (final concentration 1 μg/mL) in PBS for 5 min at 20°C in gentle agitation.\nWash three times for 5 min using 0.5 mL of PBS at 20°C in gentle agitation.\nPut the coverslip upside down a slide using a drop of mounting solution. Keep them protected from light.\nNote: The mounting solution Fluoromount-G takes 1 h to get dry at 20°C.\nStep 3: Confocal microscopy",
    "This section includes the microscope configuration and image acquisition. We used a Leica DMi8 microscope with TCS SP8 confocal module equipped with a Leica 63× 1.4NA HC Apo CS2 immersion oil objective. Hoechst was excited using the 405 nm laser channel. Alexa Fluor 488 or 633 were excited using its correspondent laser channel. Channel was set by using Leica Application Suite X (LASX) Acquisition software. The images were obtained by the sequential scanning named “between frames” at 400 Hz. Pixel size was 240.5 × 240.5 nm; image size was 246.03 × 246.03 μm; zoom was set at 0.75. The initial microscope settings were: pinhole 1 UA (for both excitation wavelengths), laser energy power was between 0.5 al 2%, the gain was between 700 and 900, and the offset between -10 and -20. Emission was collected using a Leica PMT detector with collection windows of 408–475 nm (405 channel), 498–550 nm (488 channel) and 648–800 nm (638 channel).These settings must be fine-tuned to obtain optimal images.\nCritical: 1. Keep the laser energy and/or the PMT gain below the maximum rendering photobleaching. 2. Take a minimum of 10 shots for every condition in three independent experiments. 3. Save the pictures in .LIF format to be open using LAS X or ImageJ Fiji. Pictures can be saved to other formats such as tiff for ulterior analysis.\nStep 4: Polyphosphate quantification\nWe used the free available software Fiji ImageJ 1.53c. As a summary, to quantify the polyP signal intensity we used the blue channel (Hoechst) to identify the nuclei and define the “regions of interest” (ROIs). These ROIs were the areas where polyP signal was quantified.\nLIF file generation:\nGo to the ImageJ toolbar: file>open>file name>open.\nThe window “Bio-Formats Import options” pops up; select the following options:\nDataset organization>open all series.\nColor options>color mode>colorized.",
    "Split into separate windows>Split channels.\nClick OK to get images from the different fluorescence channels. In this case, the blue channel is for Hoechst and green for polyP.\nROIs selection:\nSelect the Hoechst channel.\nProcess>filters>Gaussian blur. Establish a value of 2 at “sigma (Radius)”. Click OK.\nImage>adjust>threshold. Select “dark background\">default>over/under. Select the auto setting or manually move the sliders until all nuclei are delimitated.\nClick “apply” to obtain a binary mask.\nProcess>binary>fill holes.\nProcess>binary>watershed.\nAnalyze>analyze particles. Click OK to get the ROIs.\nNote: To avoid the selection of undesired ROIs, the size of the ROI can be selected or modified to get a better automatic selection. Go to Analyze particles>size (micronˆ2). To help in a more precise selection go to Clear results>add to manager>exclude on edges.\nOpening “ROI manager” all the ROIs generated according to the selected parameters can be checked.\nSignal quantification:\nTo eliminate unspecific signal apply a threshold (cut off around 50 in 8 bits images). Select the green (polyP) channel>image>adjust>threshold.\nSelect “dark background”>default>over/under. Adjust the sliders manually until the unspecific signal disappear.\nCritical: To avoid alterations in the quantification, once the threshold has been established, DO NOT click on “apply\".\nCritical: To compare the signal intensity among different quantifications (pictures, conditions, etc.).\nThe threshold values must be the same.\nSelect “ROI manager”. Click on “show all” to overlay the ROIs over the image to be quantified.\nAnalyze>set measurements. Select at least “integrated density (intDent)” and “limit to threshold”. Click on “measure”.\nA new window pops up showing a table containing the results. “intDent” is the parameter used to measure the fluorescence intensity.",
    "For statistical significance, at least 400 cells in each of 3 independent experiments should be analyzed. We recommend the analysis of 3 independent experiments containing a minimum of 5 fields with 30–100 cells in each. For statistical significance analysis, we applied Mann-Whitney test using GraphPad Prism software."
