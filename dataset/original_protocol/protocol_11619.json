    "1. Wing disc and adult muscle dissection and preparation\nNOTE: Clean up the dissection bench and all the dissection instruments with RNAse inhibitor solution (Table of Materials). Laboratory gloves should be worn during the whole experimental procedure.\nWing disc\nPlace the L3 staged larvae in cold 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Figure 1A).\nRinse the larvae 3x with 1x PBS and keep them in this solution for 5 min.\nUsing two pairs of sharp forceps, hold the larva from the anterior part and pull and discard the rest of the body tissues (around 2/3).\nHold both the first 1/3 of the larva with one pair of forceps and the mouth hooks with the other pair. Retract the mouth hooks inside the larva until it is fully inverted.\n\t\tNOTE: Dissect approximately 30 larvae per experiment, to ensure adequate sample size for analysis.\nObserve that the wing discs are closely associated with the two primary branches of the tracheae, which run along each side of the larva.\nRemove all the other larval components (leg discs and brain) to obtain a clean inverted larval carcass with a pair of wing discs attached to the trachea (Figure 1B).\nPlace the samples in a 1 mL centrifuge tube and fix them in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in 1x PBS for 45 min at room temperature under agitation.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample agitation is achieved by an oscillating stirrer (Table of Materials).\nWash the samples 3 x 5 min with 70% ethanol (EtOH, diluted in RNAse-free water) and store them in the same washing solution at 4 °C for at least 2 days and up to 1 week.\nIndirect flight muscles\nAnesthetize the adult flies on a CO2 fly pad and remove the heads, abdomens, legs, and wings.",
    "Place the dissected thoraxes in cold 1x PBS and continue doing so until all samples are dissected (Figure 1D).\nPrefix the thoraxes in 4% PFA, (1% Triton) for 20 min at room temperature under agitation.\nRinse the samples 3 x 5 min with 1x PBT washing solution (1% Triton in 1x PBS).\nPosition the thoraxes on a double-sided tape (Table of Materials) on a glass slide and bisect them with a sharp microtome blade to produce two hemi-thoraces (Figure 1E,F).\nFix the samples in 4% PFA (1% Triton) for 45 min at room temperature under agitation.\nWash 2 x 20 min with 1x PBT washing solution (1% Triton, 1x PBS) at room temperature under agitation.\nPlace the hemi-thoraces in cold 1x PBS and use the forceps to gently isolate the IFMs from the hemi-thorace (Figure 1G).\n\t\t​NOTE: To achieve this, it is important to remove the cuticle as thoroughly as possible.\nTo permeabilize the samples, store the isolated IFMs in 70% EtOH solution for at least 2 days and up to 1 week at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: Isolate the IFMs from approximately 10 thoraxes per experiment to ensure adequate sample size for analysis.\n2. Hybridization, immunostaining, and mounting\nNOTE: Similar hybridization procedure is applied for both wing discs and IFMs samples. It is critical to isolate the wing discs from the larval carcasses and put them in 200 µL of Buffer A prior to starting the hybridization.\nResuspend the probes in 400 µL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for a final stock solution of 12.5 µM.\nTransfer the samples to a 0.5 mL centrifuge tube containing Buffer A (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: By decreasing the volume of the container, it becomes easier to visualize the samples and avoid losing them during the washing process.",
    "Wash the samples 2 x 20 min with Buffer A.\nAspirate Buffer A, replace it with 400 µL of the hybridization buffer (Table of Materials), and prehybridize the samples for 30 min at 37 °C in a thermal mixer (Table of Materials).\nDilute the probes to a final concentration of 125 nM for wing discs and 200 nM for adult muscles, in the hybridization buffer and add the primary antibody.\n\tNOTE: The antibody dilution varies depending on the specific antibody being used (Table of Materials). Adding antibodies is optional. Users may opt to forego protein staining and instead use a similar smFISH protocol that does not include the addition of antibodies.\nAspirate the hybridization buffer and replace it with 100 µL of hybridization buffer containing the probe and the antibody.\nIncubate the samples in the dark at 37 °C for at least 16 h under 300 rpm agitation in a thermal mixer.\nWarm up an aliquot of Buffer A at 37 °C.\nWash the samples for 3 x 10 min in the thermal mixer at 37 °C under 300 rpm agitation.\nDuring the last wash, dilute the secondary antibody (1/200) and DAPI (1/10,000) in Buffer A and incubate the samples in this solution at 37 °C for at least 1 h.\nWash the samples for 3 x 20 min with Buffer B (Table of Materials).\nCarefully transfer the samples on a microscope slide, wipe off the residual Buffer B, and add 30 µL of mounting medium, and cover with an 18 x 18 mm coverslip. Use a nail polish to seal the preparation.\nStore the samples for up to 1 week at 4 °C.\n\t​NOTE: However, it is recommended to perform the imaging as soon as possible to avoid probe signal degradation.\n3. Imaging",
    "Acquire images with an xyz acquisition mode using a confocal microscope equipped with 40x and 63x oil immersion objectives (Table of Materials). The smFISH signal is detected by the HyD detector via a photon counting mode.\nLocate the samples using the DAPI signal and UV lamp.\nTo image the wing disc-associated muscle progenitors and IFMs (Figure 2 and Figure 3), apply the following setup for laser lines and emission filters: select DAPI (excitation (ex.) 405 nm, emission (em.) 450 nm), Alexa Fluor 488 (ex. 496 nm, em. 519 nm), and Quasar 670 for the smFISH probes (ex. 647 nm, em. 670 nm).\nTo image the adult MuSCs (Figure 2D), apply the following setup for laser lines and emission filters: select DAPI (ex. 405 nm, em. 450 nm), Alexa Fluor 488 (ex. 496 nm, em. 519 nm), Alexa Fluor 555 (ex. 555 nm, em. 565 nm), and Quasar 670 for the smFISH probes (ex. 647 nm, em. 670 nm).\n\tNOTE: For the imaging, the wavelengths can be adapted according to the dyes associated with secondary antibodies and probes.\nSave the confocal images as .TIFF files.\n4. Post imaging analysis\nTo get started, launch ImageJ and navigate to the Plugins menu. From there, select Macros | Edit to open the macros source code.\n\tNOTE: This will enable adjustment of the parameters as needed, and if required, modify the folder directory for each channel within the macro's source code.\nTo follow this protocol and quantify Mef2 smFISH spots in larvae, use the following settings: Log_radius = 3.0 and Log_quality = 20.0. Segement Mef2-positive nuclei with blur = 2; nucleus_scale_parameter = 30; nucleus_threshold = -8.0; nucleus_size = 300.\nIn muscle fibers, use the following parameters: Log_radius = 2.5; Log_quality = 60.0; blur = 2; nucleus_scale_parameter = 100; nucleus_threshold = 0.0; nucleus_size = 300.",
    "To initiate the macro, simply execute the run command and wait for the macro to automatically load all images from the designated folder and quantify them in a sequential manner.\n\tNOTE: Please note that the duration of this process may vary from a few seconds to several hours, depending on the volume of data being analyzed.\nLook for the results displayed in two new .csv files: file_FISH_results and file_nuclei_results. The first shows the number of transcriptional spots and their average and maximum intensities. The second one gives both the total number of nuclei and the number of spots inside each nucleus."
