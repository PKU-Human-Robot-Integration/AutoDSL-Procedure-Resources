    "Cloning of the p-β SL mini µ WT uA1 plasmidTo generate the p-β SL mini µ WT uA1 plasmid, a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a stable stem-loop structure is introduced into the KpnI site of p-β mini µ WT uA1 plasmid (Yepiskoposyan et al., 2011).Open the p-β mini µ WT uA1 vector by KpnI restriction digestionDigest 4.2 µg p-β mini µ WT uA1 plasmid with 36 U Kpn I in a total volume of 40 µl according to the manufaturer’s protocol at 37 °C for 1 h.Add 5 µl 10x CIP Buffer and 5 µl CIP (1 U/µl) and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min to dephosphorylate the open vector.Run the digested vector on 1% agarose gel, excise the DNA band and isolated the vector using the Wizard SV Gel PCR Clean-Up System. Anneal SL Oligo 1 and SL Oligo 2Mix 1 µl SL oligo 1 (100 µM), 1 µl SL oligo 2 (100 µM) and 48 µl hybridization buffer.Heat the hybridization mix to 90 °C and slowly cool down to 40 °C (in a heat block).To phosphorylate the double stranded oligonucleotide, combine 2 µl of the hybridization mix, 24 µl MQ-water, 3 µl 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer, 1 µl T4 PNK and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Inactivate the kinase at 70 °C for 15 min.Ligate 50 ng of the open p-β mini µ WT uA1 vector with 2 µl of the double-stranded oligonucleotide in 1x T4 DNA ligase buffer with 1 µl of T4 DNA ligase (400 U/µl) in a total volume of 15 µl at room temperature for 2.5 h.Transform the 5 µl of ligation mix into 100 µl XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells.The presence of the sequence encoding the stem-loop preceding the mini µ open reading frame is verified by sequencing.",
    "Transfect hela cells either with p-β SL mini µ WT uA1 or p-β mini µ WT uA1 plasmidHela cells are cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% FCS (DMEM+/+: DMEM with antibiotics and FCS).(Day 1) Seed 3 x 106 hela cells into each of two 15 cm diameter dishes to have 60% confluent cells the next day.(Day 2) Cells were transfected either with 5 µg p-β mini µ WT uA1 or 5 µg p-β SL mini µ WT uA1 plasmid using 40 µl DreamFectTM according the manufacturer’s protocol. (Day 3) Split the cells from one plate into two 15 cm diameter dishes.(Day 4) Harvest the cells.Wash the cells with 25 ml PBS.To detach the cells they are incubated with 4 ml trypsin-EDTA (T/E) at 37 °C for 10 min.Add 9 ml DMEM+/+ and resuspend the cells.Count the cells using the Countess™ automated cell counter according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Lyse the cells1.2 x 107 cells are lysed on ice in 1.2 ml hypotonic gentle lysis buffer supplemented with 40 U/ml RiboLock RI RNase inhibitor for 20 min. Clear the lysate by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (16,000 x g, 4 °C, 15 min).Take protein and RNA input samplesProtein input samples are prepared by mixture of 50 µl lysate with 50 µl SDS loading buffer, cooked at 90 °C for 5 min and stored at -20 °C.Prior to the extraction of input RNA, 100 µl cell lysates are supplemented with 2.5 µl RiboLock RI RNase inhibitor and treated with 20 U/ml TURBO DNase at 37 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, the RNA was extracted with TRI reagent according the following TrIzol protocol.Mix 100 µl TURBO DNase treated cell lysate with 900 µl TRI reagent, vortex.Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.",
    "Add 180 ml chloroform to each sample and vortex for 15 s.Incubate at RT for 5 min.Centrifuge the samples (12,000 x g, 4 °C, 15 min), lift 350 µl of the aqueous phase and transfer into a fresh test tube.Add 2 µl glycogen, 450 µl isopropanol, vortex and incubate at -20 °C for 30 min.Precipitate the RNA by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min).Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 1 ml 70% EtOH.Spin the samples (12,000 x g, 4 °C, 10 min), discard the supernatant and air dry the pellet.Resolve the RNA in 60 µl MQ-water.Measure the RNA concentration on the NanoDrop 2000. A ratio of OD260/OD230 < 2 is indicative for phenol contamination and demands for an additional EtOH precipitation of the samples.UPF1 RNA immunopurification (RIP)Adapt the NaCl concentration to 150 mM by the addition of 52.5 µl 3 M NaCl to the remaining 1,050 µl cell lysates expressing either the mini µ or SL mini µ constructs.500 µl of each lysate is incubated head-over-tail at 4 °C for 90 min with 3.7 µg goat anti-RENT1 and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, respectively (for RIP incubation procedure see Table 1).Preparation of the Dynabeads® protein G beads.128 µl Dynabeads® protein G beads are washed with 1 ml wash buffer.Beads are washed with 1 ml hypotonic gentle lysis buffer.Beads are equilibrated in hypotonic gentle lysis buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% yeast tRNA at 4 °C for 1 h (to minimize unspecific binding).Wash the beads twice with 1 ml hypotonic gentle lysis buffer.The Dynabeads® are equally distributed on the four RIP samples and incubated head over tail at 4 °C for 90 min (Table 1).Table 1. UPF1 RIP incubation schemaimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140328/20140328035209_8750.jpgPrecipitates were washed six times with 1 ml Net-2 buffer.",
    "During the last wash step the beads are separated.One-third of the beads are incubated with 40 µl 2x SDS loading buffer at 90 °C for 5 min in order to elute the protein for subsequent western blot analysis.Two-thirds of the beads are dissolved in 50 µl Turbo DNase mix and DNase treated at 37 °C for 10 min. To isolate the RNA 900 µl TRI reagent is added to the samples and treated according to the Trizol protocol (see 4b). The RNA is dissolved in 34.5 µl MQ-water, reverse transcribed and analyzed by RT-qPCR.Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCRThe entire recovered RNA of the UPF1 RIPs, or 1 µg of the input RNA samples are reverse transcribed in a total volume of 50 µl containing 1x StrataScript RT buffer, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 300 ng random hexamer primers and 1 µl of StrataScript Multi-Temp reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturere’s protocol. Twelve microliters of the reverse transcription reactions were amplified with Brilliant III Ultra-Fast qPCR Master mix in the Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000 (Pipetting was done using the Corbett CAS-1200 robot.). The primers and TaqMan probes to measure SMG5 and mini µ mRNA levels are described elsewhere (Yepiskoposyan et al., 2011) (see also Table 2). The levels of SMG5 mRNA, which efficiently associate with UPF1 (Yepiskoposyan et al., 2011) are measured to normalize for variable RIP efficiencies in different samples.Table 2. TaqMan probesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140328/20140328035253_3991.jpgWestern blottingFor protein analysis, 2 x 105 cells and one-third of the RIP samples are separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE using the Mighty Small II running chamber SE260. The proteins are transferred to Optitran BA-S 85 reinforced nitrocellulose membrane using a semi dry blotter and Bjerrum transfer buffer.",
