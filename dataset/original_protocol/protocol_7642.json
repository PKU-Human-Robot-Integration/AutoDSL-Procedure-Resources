    "Part I: POLRMT Purification Overexpression of recombinant POLRMT in E. coli Transform the plasmid into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL and plate on LB agar plates containing ampicillin (or the appropriate antibiotic). Incubate inverted overnight at 37 °C.Note: This transformation can also be done with BL21-CodonPlus-RIL. This step can be skipped if glycerol stocks of cells carrying the POLRMT-coding plasmid have been made previously. Get an autoclaved flask with 50 mL of autoclaved LB media and add 50 μL of Amp stock (100 mg/mL, see Recipes).Pick five separate colonies from the plate with a sterile pipette tip or stick for inoculation (or add a small piece of glycerol stock).Once inoculated, start incubating the cultures in the afternoon around 5 pm at 28 °C and shake overnight (14–17 h) at 200 rpm (see General note 2 for temperature and oversaturation of cells).In four flasks (2.8 L Fernsbach culture flasks), prepare 1 L each of autoclaved LB media and add 1 mL of Amp stock per liter of media.Add 10 mL of inoculum per liter of LB media with ampicillin (see General note 3 for how to make glycerol stocks).Incubate the inoculated flasks at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Check cell density by measuring the OD600 after 3–4 h to see if it is between 0.4 and 0.6.Once in the above OD range, lower the shaker temperature to 18 °C. Withdraw a 1 mL sample (label as “Uninduced”) into a microfuge tube and tape it on the side of the flask to let it continue shaking.Cool down the flasks to 18 °C from 30 min to 1 h before adding IPTG (0.2 mM final concentration) to induce POLRMT expression.",
    "To do this, add 200 μL of 1 M IPTG stock (see Recipes) per 1 L of LB (see General note 4 for cooling flasks).Continue growing overnight (16–20 h) at 18 °C at 200 rpm.Withdraw a 1 mL sample at the end of the induction period (“Induced”) and remove the “Uninduced” sample tube off the side of the flask (see Recipes for SDS-PAGE samples). Run out samples on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and Coomassie stain to visualize POLRMT overexpression.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2,991× g for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 L centrifuge bottles.Safely dispose of the supernatant with 10% bleach and scrape the pellets into a 50 mL conical tube. Store the combined pellet at -80 °C (flash freezing is not necessary) or proceed with the next step.Lysis of POLRMT overexpression pellet by sonication Note: All steps below should be done at 4 °C or on ice unless noted otherwise. Thaw the pellet by putting the tube in tap water. Scrape out the cells with a spatula into a metal beaker and add 50 mL of cold Lysis Buffer with BME, lysozyme, and PIC. Optional:  Stir on a stir plate with a stir bar at 4 °C for 1 h to let the lysozyme break down cells.Put the beaker in an ice bucket and sonicate cell suspension for 30 min at 4 °C (30 s on and off, 60% amplitude). Check that the suspension has become less viscous and slightly darker at this point.Centrifuge the suspension at 30,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C.Pour supernatant (“Lysate”) into a cold beaker on ice and record the volume.Take samples to run on an SDS-PAGE gel: Pellet and Lysate (see Recipes).",
    "There will be more POLRMT in the pellet than in the lysate, but we will use the soluble POLRMT in the lysate for purification (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4892/bioprotoc-13-23-4892-g001.jpgFigure 1.

(C) Schematic of POLRMT purification including sonication, PEI precipitation, AS precipitation, a DEAE column, a HisTrap column, a HiTrap heparin column, and concentration.POLRMT PEI precipitation With the lysate in a cold glass beaker on ice or at 4 °C, add a stir bar and check that it gently stirs the solution while on a stir plate.Slowly add cold 5% PEI (see Recipes) dropwise into the lysate to get 0.3% PEI final concentration. To calculate how much 5% PEI we need, find 6% of the volume of the lysate:______ mL of 5% PEI to be added = ______ mL of lysate × 0.06Cover the top of the beaker with aluminum foil and keep stirring gently at 4 °C for an additional 30 min.Centrifuge at 30,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Take out samples for gel analysis [PEI pellet, PEI supernatant (see Recipes)] and run them out on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. POLRMT should be in the supernatant (Figure 1B).POLRMT AS precipitation Add AS powder slowly (for a period of 30 min) to the supernatant to get 55% saturation.For example, 55% saturation of 100 mL of lysate requires 35.1 g of AS.______mL lysate × 3.",
    "51 g/mL = _______ grams AS to be addedCover the top of the beaker with aluminum foil and gently stir at 4 °C for 1 h (or overnight) to dissolve AS and precipitate proteins.Centrifuge at 30,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. The POLRMT protein is in the pellet.Take out samples for gel analysis: AS pellet, AS supernatant (see Recipes). On an SDS-PAGE gel, you should see POLRMT (~140 kDa) in the AS pellet and not in the AS supernatant (Figure 1B).Record the weight of the pellet in grams and store it at -80 °C.Pause point:  The AS pellet can be stored for a few months before moving on to FPLC purification.POLRMT DEAE gravity column and overnight HisTrap column Note: One column volume (CV) corresponds to 5 mL for the HisTrap column (Cytiva). The DEAE gravity column can be replaced by using a HiTrap DEAE Fast Flow column (Cytiva) attached in tandem with the HisTrap column. Start by attaching the 5 mL HisTrap column and loading POLRMT HisTrap buffers (see Recipes) onto the FPLC.Wash and equilibrate the column (2 mL/min for five CV each of filtered Milli-Q water, HisTrap Buffer B, and then HisTrap Buffer A).Resuspend the AS pellet in the HisTrap Buffer A by adding 4 mL of cold buffer per gram of pellet. Stir gently until dissolved.Note: The following steps with the DEAE column can be done at room temperature as long as all the buffers are cold and the samples are kept on ice. Prepare the DEAE by placing 10 mL of the DEAE resin suspension into a clean gravity column. Once the resin settles, you should get approximately 5 mL of bed resin.Wash the DEAE with 5× bed volume of cold filtered water and cold HisTrap Buffer A.",
    "Note: This DEAE column can be washed with water and stored in 20% EtOH for reuse. With the stopper on the gravity column closed, pour the dissolved AS pellet into the column and gently stir with a spatula. Optional:  Incubate for 15 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking.Elute into a clean container on ice and then add 10 mL of HisTrap Buffer A to ensure all POLRMT is washed out.Filter the eluent with a 0.22 μm syringe filter and prepare to load it on the HisTrap column on the FPLC. Use these settings for the FPLC run while monitoring eluent absorbance at 280 nm (A280) and collect all flowthrough/eluent for a later SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2B):Sample application: 0.3 mL/min (for running overnight).Column wash with Buffer A: 0.5 mL/min (for running overnight). Wash the column until the A280 trace returns to baseline (approximately five CV or 25 mL). After reaching baseline, continue to wash for at least 20 mL.Protein elution: 1 mL/min, collect 5 mL fractions.Elution program:0–50% Buffer B gradient for 40 CV (200 mL). Optional:  Wash the column with Buffer B. No need to collect samples from these steps.70% Buffer B for five CV (25 mL)100% Buffer B for five CV (25 mL)Wash the column with five CV of water and five CV of 20% EtOH (use a lower flow rate of 1 mL/min) and store the columns.Note: POLRMT elutes in a small broad peak and is very dilute. Do not let the fractions sit for longer than one day, as the more concentrated fractions of POLRMT will start precipitating (see General note 5). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4892/bioprotoc-13-23-4892-g002.jpgFigure 2. Mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) HisTrap chromatography. (A) Chromatogram for the elution phase of the HisTrap column run on the FPLC and (B) 8% SDS-PAGE analysis of the collected fractions.",
    "Take out samples of the HisTrap fractions and run them on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel alongside a protein ladder. POLRMT appears around 140 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel and is more concentrated roughly around fractions #4–22 (Figure 2B). (To save time, start preparing the filters and concentrate while the gel is running; see step below.)Equilibrate two 50K MWCO Amicon filters at 4,000× g and 4 °C.Concentrate POLRMT by centrifuging the Amicon filtration units at 1,900× g. Pipette solution gently every 5–10 min to avoid precipitation. Stop when the total volume becomes less than 25 mL (see General note 6 about this concentration step).Add an equal volume of No Salt Heparin Buffer to the concentrate to bring the final NaCl concentration to 150 mM (see General note 7).POLRMT overnight HiTrap heparin column Wash and equilibrate the 5 mL HiTrap heparin column in Buffer A on the FPLC (2 mL/min for five CV each of filtered Milli-Q water, Heparin Buffer B, and then Heparin Buffer A).Load your protein sample that has been diluted with the No Salt Heparin buffer.Run the following FPLC program:Sample application: 0.3 mL/min (for running overnight).Column wash with Buffer A: 0.5 mL/min (for running overnight). Wash the column until the A280 trace returns to baseline (approximately five CV or 25 mL). After reaching baseline, continue to wash for at least 20 mL.Protein elution: 2 mL/min, collect 3 mL fractions.0–50% Buffer B gradient for 20 CV (100 mL).55% Buffer B for five CV or 25 mL (POLRMT elutes here!).70% Buffer B for five CV or 25 mL.100% Buffer B for five CV or 25 mL.Wash the column with five CV of water and five CV of 20% EtOH (use a lower flow rate of 1 mL/min) for storage of the columns.",
    "Concentration and storage of POLRMT Run a 10% SDS-PAGE gel of the fractions (see Recipes) and pool together the fractions with POLRMT (Figure 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4892/bioprotoc-13-23-4892-g003.jpgFigure 3. Mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) HiTrap Heparin chromatography. (A) Chromatogram for the elution phase of the HiTrap Heparin column run on the FPLC and (B) 10% SDS-PAGE analysis of the collected fractions.Equilibrate the membrane of a 50K MWCO Amicon filtration unit with 150 mM NaCl Heparin Buffer by spinning in the centrifuge for 5 min. Add pooled POLRMT fractions to the unit.Start centrifuging at 2,500× g at 4 °C and gradually decrease the speed to 1,300× g, pipetting gently from the bottom of the membrane and checking concentration frequently until at least 7 μM. POLRMT will easily precipitate out, so if you notice precipitate forming or if the concentration in the solution is not increasing, stop concentrating (see General note 8).Measure and calculate protein concentration using these parameters by the Protparam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/[href=https://web.expasy.org/protparam/]):6x-His-POLRMT: 137.7 kDa or 137,700 mg/moleMolar extinction coefficient: 143,700 L (cm*M)-1 (assuming all cys reduced)Abs 0.1% = 1.043 (assuming all cys reduced)Add sterile glycerol to get a final concentration of 25% glycerol.Aliquot 10 μL into low-retention tubes, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C.Part II: TFAM purification Overexpression of recombinant TFAM in E. coli Transform BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL cells using ~200 ng of ProEX_Htb_TFAM plasmid and plate on LB agar plates containing ampicillin. Incubate inverted overnight at 37 °C.Grow 5 × 5 mL starter cultures overnight in LB supplemented with ampicillin, one colony per tube.In the morning, spin down the 5 mL starter cultures at 2,782× g for 6 min and pour off the media. Carefully resuspend the cells in a total of 1 mL of LB, transferring the 1 mL to resuspend all the cells from the five tubes.",
    "Add ampicillin to LB media (1 mL of 100 mg/mL ampicillin stock per 1 L of LB). Evenly split the 1 mL cell suspension between the 1 L LB flasks.Incubate at 37 °C at 200 rpm. Check the OD600 after 4–5 h to see if it is between 0.4 and 0.6.Once in the above OD range, withdraw a 1 mL sample (“uninduced”) into a microfuge tube, tape the tube on the side of the flask, and lower the shaker temperature to 16 °C.Cool down the flasks before inducing with IPTG (0.2 mM final concentration; add 200 μL of 1 M IPTG stock per 1 L of LB).Continue shaking overnight at 16 °C (~16–20 h) at 200 rpm.Take a sample at the end of the induction period (“Induced”) and run it alongside the “Uninduced” sample (see Recipes) on an SDS-PAGE gel to visualize protein expression.Harvest the cells by centrifuging at 2,991× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Dispose of the supernatant and scrape the pellets into a 50 mL conical tube. Store the combined pellet at -80 °C or proceed with the cell lysis.Cell lysis: lysozyme treatment and sonication Note: All steps below should be done at 4 °C or on ice unless noted otherwise. Thaw cells if frozen. Add 40 mL of TFAM Lysis Buffer (with lysozyme, BME, and PIC; see Recipes) to the pellet (10 mL of lysis buffer per liter of expressed culture) and resuspend the pellet until homogenous.Incubate for 1 h at 4 °C.Sonicate cell suspension for 20 min at 4 °C (20 s on and off, 60% amplitude).Centrifuge at 30,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C.Save ~10 μL of “Cell Pellet” and “Lysate” samples (see Recipes) for SDS-PAGE gel analysis.TFAM Ni-NTA resin #1 Note: This is Ni-NTA by centrifugation method at 4 °C.",
    "Prepare a 5 mL Ni-NTA resin bed in a 50 mL conical tube according to the manufacturer’s instruction and wash three times with Ni-NTA Buffer A by resuspending the resin in the buffer, spinning it down at 363× g for 3 min at 4 °C, carefully decanting the buffer, and repeating the process.Add the supernatant and incubate overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation.Spin down the resin, collect the supernatant as “Sample Application” into a conical tube, and begin resin washing steps by adding 5 mL of Ni-NTA Buffer A to the resin, gently mixing, and spinning the sample at 1,932× g at 4 °C.Collect the supernatant as “Wash 1” and repeat washes to wash #10.Beginning with wash #10, check the absorbance of the sample at 280 nm and continue the washes until the absorbance is close to 0.Elute the proteins by adding 5 mL of Ni-NTA Buffer B and spinning as before. Collect the sample as “Elution 1” and repeat this 3–5 times, keeping “Elution” supernatants separate.Run a 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gel with collected samples from the cell lysis, sample application, washing, and elution (see Recipes). A TFAM band just above 25 kDa should be obvious but some contaminants will still be present (Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231117/20231117021316_3582.jpgFigure 4.

    "(E) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to test TFAM ability to compact plasmid DNA.Dialysis and TEV cleavage of the His tag on TFAM Add 2 L of ice-cold TFAM TEV Cleavage Buffer to a large beaker.Place the elution samples with significant TFAM content into dialysis tubing and add TEV protease at a 1:30 TEV:TFAM protein molar ratio. (Estimate TFAM content using the absorbance of the pooled elution samples at 280 nm. See step G for protein mass and extinction coefficient.)Allow the sample to dialyze in Cleavage Buffer and cleave overnight at 4 °C with gentle stirring.Check the success of TEV cleavage on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel by comparing the sample before and after dialysis. If cleavage is complete, continue to the next step. If not, add more TEV protease and continue dialysis (Figure 4C).Note: The version of TEV protease used in our lab is ~26 kDa in size. This means it will look a lot like uncleaved TFAM on the SDS-PAGE gel. TFAM Ni-NTA resin #2 Prepare a 5 mL resin bed of Ni-NTA resin as before (see step C1).Add the dialyzed sample to the resin and incubate overnight at 4 °C as before with gentle agitation.Spin down the resin as before (1,932× g at 4 °C) and collect the supernatant [“Sample application” (this will have the TEV-cleaved, now untagged TFAM)].Add 5 mL of Ni-NTA Buffer B to the resin, mix, and spin to collect “Elution 1.” You want to collect this to be sure the TEV protease was bound by the Ni resin.Repeat the elution 2–3 times.Run a 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gel to be sure that TFAM is in the “Sample application” (Figure 2C).",
    "TFAM concentration and HiTrap heparin column Note: An alternative to the first concentration step is to adjust the salt concentration by adding a version of the Ni-NTA Buffer A without any salt. Adjust the salt to <200 mM for use on the HiTrap heparin column. Wash and equilibrate the 5 mL HiTrap heparin column (Cytiva) on the FPLC with five CV of heparin Buffer B and then Buffer A.Add elution fractions from Ni-NTA resin #2 to a 50 mL conical tube and begin buffer exchanging the sample by adding it in 15 mL volumes to a 3K MWCO Amicon filter and spinning at 3,434× g at 4 °C. Stop concentrating when the buffer exchange sample is down to 2 mL.When the entire protein sample has been added and spun down to approximately 2 mL, fill the 3K MWCO Amicon filter with Heparin Buffer A and continue to spin. Continue to add Heparin Buffer A and spin until ~30 mL has flown through the filter and you are left with 2–3 mL. This lowers the salt concentration from 300 mM to 200 mM to ensure binding to the HiTrap Heparin column.Load the buffer-exchanged protein sample onto the prepared HiTrap Heparin column.Run using these settings:Sample application: 1.0 mL/min.Column wash: 1.0 mL/min until A280 reaches ~0.Elution: 2.5 mL/min with 2 mL fractions.0–100% Buffer B gradient over 10 CV (50 mL).Wash the column with five CV of water and five CV of 20% EtOH (1 mL/min) for storage.Concentration and storage of TFAM Run a 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gel of the fractions and pool together the fractions with TFAM (Figure 4D)Concentrate as before using a fresh 3K MWCO Amicon filter.When all the pooled fractions have been concentrated to a small volume (0.",
    "5–1 mL), add 2× Storage Buffer to fill the filter and continue to centrifuge. Repeat this process to pass two full volumes of Storage Buffer through the filter to exchange the buffer. Stop when the second full pass of 2× Storage buffer has reached ~2 mL and begin measuring the absorbance at 280 nm for TFAM concentration while continuing to centrifuge.Measure and calculate protein concentration using these parameters from the protein sequence by the Protparam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/[href=https://web.expasy.org/protparam/]):TFAM after TEV cleavage: 24.4 kDa or 24,400 mg/mole.Molar extinction coefficient: 35,410 L (cm*M)-1 (assuming all cys reduced).Abs 0.1% = 1.45 (assuming all cys reduced).When the desired concentration has been reached (100–200 mM), move the sample from the Amicon filter to a conical tube and add an equal volume of filtered 50% glycerol for a final concentration of 25% glycerol.Aliquot 20 mL per tube, flash freeze, and store at -80 °C.Testing TFAM DNA-compaction activity with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) Note: To know if the purified TFAM is active, it is best to run an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TFAM can bind DNA non-specifically, so any plasmid DNA can be used. If the bands shift upwards in the assay, the TFAM is active and will work with transcription assays. In our assays, we use the Puc19 plasmid. Prepare a 1% agarose EMSA gel using TFAM EMSA Running BufferPrepare reactions with 1× TFAM Binding Buffer, add ~200 ng of plasmid DNA, and add TFAM in increasing amounts to the plasmid. These reactions are typically done in total volumes of 20–30 mL.Incubate samples at 37 °C for 30 min.Add filtered glycerol to 10% in the samples and load onto the EMSA gel along with a 1 kb DNA ladder.",
    "Run the EMSA gel at 70 V for 65 min at room temperature in TFAM EMSA Running Buffer.Stain the gel with gentle agitation using ethidium bromide for 30 min at room temperature and image using UV light on a Bio-Rad Gel Doc EZ Imager system or equivalent (Figure 4E).Part III: TFB2M purification Expression of TFB2M Transform the plasmid containing TFB2M (Figure 5) into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL and spread on Kan-containing (25 μg/mL, see Recipes) plates. Incubate inverted overnight at 37 °C.Note: The transformation step can be skipped if glycerol stocks have been previously made. E. coli strain ArcticExpress (DE3) could also be used for transformation. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4892/bioprotoc-13-23-4892-g005.jpgFigure 5. Transcription factor B2, mitochondrial (TFB2M) purification flowchart. (A) Expression construct containing the nucleotide sequence for TFB2M, corresponding to residues 21–396 (Uniprot: Q9H5Q4).

(B) Schematic of TFB2M purification including protein expression, Ni-NTA #1 Resin purification, cleavage by TEV protease, Ni-NTA #2 Resin step, a HiTrap Heparin column, and concentration.Add five colonies or a small chunk of the frozen glycerol stock to 5–10 mL of LB culture with Kan (25 μg/mL). Grow overnight while shaking at 28–37 °C; avoid letting the starter culture become oversaturated (see General note 2 for POLRMT purification).In the morning, add primary culture (2.5–5 mL) to 1 L of LB culture.Grow at 37 °C at 200 rpm until OD600 reaches 0.7–0.8 (approximately 3–5 h).Once in the OD range, cool down the shaker to 14 °C and withdraw a 1 mL sample (“uninduced”) before inducing the rest of the culture with 0.2 mM final IPTG (refer to Recipes). Continue to shake for 16–20 h at 14 °C.",
    "Take a 1 mL sample (“Induced”) at the end of the induction period to run on an SDS-PAGE gel.Harvest the cells by centrifuging at 2,991× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Store cell pellet at -80 °C.Sonication Note: All steps below should be done at 4 °C or on ice unless noted otherwise. Add 40 mL of Lysis Buffer (with lysozyme, BME, and PIC, see Recipes) to 4 L-worth of cell pellet (10 mL of lysis buffer per liter of expressed culture) and stir the pellet at 4 °C for 1 h.In the cold room, sonicate for 20 min at 60% amplitude, 30 s on and off.Centrifuge at 30,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove cell debris.Ni-NTA Resin #1 Set up a gravity column by clamping it onto a stand and pipette 10 mL of Ni-NTA resin solution into the column to get 5 mL bed volume.Wash the resin with filtered, cold Milli-Q water three times and then wash once to equilibrate with your Ni Buffer A.Note: The volume of each wash should be five times the bed volume of the resin. Pour the cell lysate onto Ni-NTA resin and gently stir with a metal spatula to promote the binding of your His-tagged protein. Securely close the column/vial and rock gently for 1 h at 4 °C.Clamp the column again on the stand and collect your sample application flowthrough. Label the sample as “Ni flowthrough” for SDS-PAGE.Prepare the following mixtures of Buffer A and B to perform the wash and elution steps:One CV = 5 mL bed resin.Wash 1, 2, and 3: 0% B, five CV: prepare three tubes containing 50 mL of Buffer A each.Wash 4: 5% B, five CV: one tube containing 47.5 mL of Buffer A and 2.5 mL of Buffer B.",
    "Elution 1: 40% B, two CV: one tube containing 6 mL of Buffer A and 4 mL of Buffer B.Elution 2: 50% B, two CV: one tube containing 5 mL of Buffer A and 5 mL of Buffer B.Elution 3: 100% B, two CV: one tube with 10 mL of Buffer B.Keep them on ice or at 4 °C before use.Note: The washes and elution can be done at room temperature if all the buffers are cold and samples are kept on ice. Avoid drying out the resin. Wash the resin with Wash 1. Collect and label the flowthrough as “W1.”Repeat with Wash 2 and Wash 3.Wash a final time with Wash 4 (which contains 5% v/v of Buffer B in Buffer A). Save the flowthrough as “W4.”Elute TFB2M with Elution 1. Collect and label the elution as “E1.”Repeat with Elution 2 and 3.Pool elution 1, 2, and 3 together and estimate the protein concentration with the spectrophotometer:6x-His-MBP-TFB2M: 87.7 kDa or 87,691 mg/mole.Molar extinction coefficient: 117,230 L (cm·M)-1 (assuming all cys reduced).Abs 0.1% = 0.00134 (assuming all cys reduced).Overnight TEV cleavage Estimate the amount of TFB2M using the absorbance of the pooled elution samples at 280 nm:Amount of total TFB2M (spectrometer reading) =_____mg/mLTotal volume = ____ mLTotal amount of protein = ____mg (assume it is all TFB2M)We need a molar ratio of 1:25 TEV:TFB2MAmount of TEV to be added =_____mgConcentration of your TEV protease stock = _____mg/mLVolume of TEV to be added = _____mL.Add 2 L of ice-cold TEV Cleavage Dialysis Buffer to a large beaker with a large stir bar.Add TEV to the same tube as your Ni-resin eluted TFB2M, gently mix, and then transfer into the dialysis tubing (see General note 9).",
    "Allow the sample to dialyze in the TEV Cleavage Buffer for 19–20 h overnight at 4 °C with gentle stirring.Check the completion of TEV cleavage of TFB2M on a 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gel by comparing the TFB2M band size before (~88 kDa) and after dialysis (~43 kDa). If cleavage is complete, continue to the next step. If not, add more TEV protease and continue dialysis (Figure 6).Note: The MBP tag (42 kDa) will be similar in size to TFB2M, and the band may be more intense. The version of purified TEV protease used in our lab is approximately 26 kDa in size. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4892/bioprotoc-13-23-4892-g006.jpgFigure 6.

(B) SDS-PAGE of TFB2M expression, the first Ni-NTA purification step, the TEV cleavage process, and TFB2M presence in Ni-NTA #2 wash.Ni-NTA Resin #2 Note: This is to remove His-tagged TEV protease and other contaminants from the cleaved TFB2M, which is now missing its His-tag. TFB2M will be in the flowthrough instead of the elution (Figure 6A). Using the same Ni-NTA column from the previous step, wash the column with 5× bed volume of Buffer B to remove all the bound proteins, and then wash with Buffer A to equilibrate the column.Before applying your cleaved TFB2M sample onto the Ni-NTA resin, add Buffer B to the TFB2M solution to bring the imidazole concentration to 20 mM (matching that in Buffer A):(20 mM imidazole needed) (____ mL of cleaved TFB2M sample) = (500 mM imidazole in Buffer B) (x mL Buffer B needed)Note: Introducing a small (20 mM) amount of imidazole ensures that most of TFB2M does not bind to the resin.",
    "The other protein contaminants like the His-MBP-tag and His-tagged TEV protease will stay bound to the Ni-NTA. Add the sample to the Ni resin and rock gently for 30 min at 4 °C.Collect the flowthrough (or “wash”) containing TFB2M and run a 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gel to be sure that TFB2M is present in the flowthrough (Figure 6B).Note: What remains bound to the column are the His-MBP tag and His-tagged TEV protease. Be aware that the His-MBP tag is similar in size to untagged TFB2M (approximately 42 kDa), and its band is often more intense on a gel. Overnight heparin column Wash and equilibrate a 5 mL HiTrap heparin column (Cytiva) on the FPLC.Dilute the TFB2M sample (currently in 300 mM KCl buffer) with the No Salt Heparin Buffer to get a final salt concentration between 75 and 150 mM KCl.Note: The lower the salt, the more TFB2M binds to the heparin column. Do not concentrate TFB2M before loading it on the column or it will precipitate out. Run using these settings:Note: One column volume (CV) is 5 mL for the HiTrap Heparin column (Cytiva). Sample application: 1 mL/min.Column wash: 0.5 mL/min (for running overnight) for five CV.Protein elution: 0.5 mL/min, collect 2 mL fractions. Elution program:0–70% gradient for 10 CV (50 mL total)100% for one CVWash the column with five CV of water and five CV of 20% EtOH (1 mL/min) for storage.Collect fractions and run a sample on a 10%–12% SDS-PAGE to determine which fractions contain TFB2M (Figure 7B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4892/bioprotoc-13-23-4892-g007.jpgFigure 7.

    "Equilibrate a 10K MWCO Amicon membrane in a centrifuge for 5 min with the Heparin Buffer A.Start centrifuging the TFB2M sample at 2,500× g and gradually decrease the speed to 1,300× g if precipitate starts forming. Stop the centrifuge every 10 min and gently pipette TFB2M solution up and down with a pipette to mix. If you notice precipitate forming or if the concentration in the solution is not increasing, stop concentrating.Measure and calculate the protein concentration using these parameters from the protein sequence by the Protparam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/[href=https://web.expasy.org/protparam/]):TFB2M after TEV cleavage: 43.405 kDa or 43,405 mg/mole.Molar extinction coefficient: 49,390 L (cm·M)-1 (assuming all cys reduced).Abs 0.1% = 1.138 (assuming all cys reduced).Add sterile glycerol to get a final concentration of 25%, aliquot 15 μL into low-retention tubes, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C (see General note 10 for estimating salt concentration in TFB2M samples)."
