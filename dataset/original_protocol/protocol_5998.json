    "Sample preparationFor each sample, prepare 3 ml of 100% methanol in a 15 ml centrifuge tube and pre-chill at -80 °C for at least 1 h before fixation.For each strain, inoculate at least 10 ml of cells per time point and grow overnight (~16 h) in YEA to an optical density (OD600nm) of 0.25 at 30 °C in a shaking incubator at 110 rpm. OD is determined by spectrophotometer.Note: For example, if there will be 5 time points (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h, for instance), then grow 50 ml (5 x 10 ml) of cell culture in a conical flask. Add 0.01% of a 99% MMS stock into the cell culture and start timing.Note: MMS can be substituted with other drugs or treatments that will initiate foci formation. As a negative control for GFP signal, grow a 10 ml wild-type strain without any GFP tagging (WT) to OD600nm 0.5 using the conditions in Step A2. Cell harvesting and fixationCollect 10 ml of cells by passing the culture through the vacuum filtration holder set with glass microfiber filters.Note: Leave the vacuum pump on for an extra few seconds to ensure most of the liquid is removed. Immediately submerge the cell-containing filter into pre-chilled methanol using forceps. Repeat the process for the other time pointsFix the cells in methanol by leaving them at -80 °C for at least 15 min or up to 2 to 3 weeks.Rehydration of cellsNote: Keep the tubes on ice throughout the whole process of rehydration.Add 1 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS to the 15 ml tube, invert to mix. Dislodge the cells from the filter paper by repeatedly pipetting the PBS-methanol mixture inside the 15 ml tube over the surface of the filter and then remove the filter disc from the solution with forceps.",
    "Note: Dislodging the cells gently will prevent the generation of excessive fibers, which will cause unevenness when mounting on a glass slide. Rehydrate the cells by adding 6 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS gradually, i.e., add 1 ml, invert to mix, add another 1 ml and mix.Note: Do not add all 6 ml at the same time as this may burst the cells. Centrifuge at 1,600 x g for 1 min to collect the cell pellet.Remove the supernatant and transfer the cells to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with 1 ml of 1x PBS.Wash thrice each with 1 ml ice-cold 1x PBS. Resuspend the cells in 20 µl of ice-cold 1x PBS and keep on ice until observation.Note: Observations must be done on the same day the samples are rehydrated. Image acquisitionTo view the Rhp54-GFP signals, mount 1 µl of cells with an equal volume of 1 µg/ml DAPI onto a glass slide and cover with a microscope cover glass.Note: Coverslip with thickness No. 1 is used in the current experimental procedures. For optimal results, use coverslips with a thickness that is recommended for each individual type of microscope lens. No sealing of the slides is required as the sample is visualized immediately after mounting. Observe the S. pombe cells with a 100x magnification objective lens using a fluorescence microscope.Note: We use the Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope system with NIS-Elements Advance Research software (v5.02) as an example.  Set up an automated image acquisition parameter (ND Acquisition): first capturing a still image of DAPI then taking a Z-stack for GFP.Note: Acquisition of the Z-stack images is important, as the foci may only be focused in certain focal planes. The number of images captured defines the resolution.",
    "For accurate quantification and reconstruction of nucleus image perfectly, according to Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, Z-slice of 285 nm per individual steps is necessary (based on objective oil lens of 100x magnification and 1.4 NA) (Shannon, 1949). This is equal to ~14 Z-steps over a total depth of 4 µm.  To avoid photobleaching when running Z-scan, the cells are first focused by viewing the DAPI-stained nuclei. Once ready, click the “Run now” button for automated image acquisition. The captured image will be saved to a pre-destined folder automatically. Note: A new field of view should be observed as the focus plane moves away from the previous photobleached area during the scan in the Z-axis.  Capture a sufficient number of images with a total number of cells > 500 per sample.Note: All strains in the same experiment need to have images taken on the same day and continuously (without turning the microscope on/off or adjusting the light source) to ensure consistency and inter-strain comparability. Combined images of DAPI and Z-stack GFP will be saved as .nd2 file format.Image processingTo combine the GFP images from the different Z-axes into a single, focused frame, open a .nd2 image, click on the “Create EDF Focused Document” button (Figure 1A). Note: The EDF module functions by combining the focused portion in each plane into a single focused image. To standardize the variation in background intensity on the post-EDF image, select “Draw Square Background ROI” and box-up an area without any cells (Figure 1B). Select “Subtract Background Using ROI” to remove the background.To enhance the intensity of the GFP foci for easier detection by the software, select from the menu bar: Image > Local Contrast > set to 3 Degrees and with a radius of 0.65 µm.",
    "Note: Local contrast is a digital image processing step to increase the contrast of the image with respect to local surroundings, aiming to emphasize the details or sharpen an image. The “degree” is the contrast multiplicator or magnitude of contrast amplification. “Radius” is the size of the adjacent area (pixel) to be processed. When the radius value is small, it will make the bright pixels become brighter while dimming the darker adjacent pixels to enhance the smaller-scale details. Increasing the radius value makes a wider adjacent area visible but results in the loss of details, the GFP foci in this case. Hence, “degree” and “radius” have to be set such that the fine details of GFP can be enhanced while at the same time not exaggerated.  Save the .nd2 file.Repeat Steps E1-E4 for other images. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181213/20181213022307_3519.jpgFigure 1. Creating a focused image and removing the background noise. A. Button to create an EDF-focused image. B. Red boxes indicate the selection required for defining the background area on an image.Optimizing and determination of GFP foci (Batch process)Images of the positive control strain should be used as a reference to determine the parameters for GFP foci quantification. In the case of Lim et al. (2018), wild-type Rhp54-GFP cells that were treated with MMS for 4 h were used to set up the parameters. Example of images taken for DAPI and GFP signal is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181213/20181213022336_6732.jpgFigure 2. Example of DAPI and GFP images. A single .nd2 file consists of images of DAPI and GFP channel. The merged image of both channels shows that Rhp54-GFP signal localized to the nucleus. Scale bar: 10 μm. Open a processed .nd2 image (EDF and background subtraction done, after Step E4); at the menu bar, select Image > General Analysis.",
    "Under the “Analysis Palette” of the General Analysis window (Figure 3A), select “Add Channel” to add both the DAPI and FITC (GFP) channels (Figure 3B).To define a parameter for DAPI detection, select DAPI on the left and threshold on the right, and adjust accordingly (Figures 3A and 3B). The changes made will show up in real time on the image, as in Figure 3C; blue signals indicate the DAPI area defined after adjustment of the threshold.Note: Ensure the “Preview” box is ticked at the bottom of the window to view changes in real-time. See Note 1. For FITC (GFP), select “Bright Spot Detection” (Figure 3D, red box on the right; Figure 3E) and adjust other parameters accordingly until the number of pink spots appearing on the image matches the number of GFP foci observed by eye (Figure 3F). See Note 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181213/20181213022403_4223.jpgFigure 3. Adjusting the parameters for detecting DAPI and GFP signals. A.

    "To count the GFP foci number in the nucleus, under “Analysis Palette” select “Add Combined Layer” (Figure 3B) and adjust the following criteria: ROI = “DAPI”, Feature = “Count”, Measured On = “FITC” (Figures 4A and 4B). Save the final parameter in .ga format.Press “Run Now” and the counting results will be shown in the “Automated Measurement Results” table (Figure 4C), with “Source” indicating the image file name, “RoiID” indicating each of the individual DAPI-positive foci identified, and “NumberObjects” indicating the number of GFP-positive foci identified. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181213/20181213022424_1801.jpgFigure 4.

Select the method or criteria that will be used for the batch analysis (Figure 5A). In this case, select “General Analysis”; as in Figure 4A, the “Analysis Name” is “General Analysis”. Alternatively, the previously set parameter (.ga file) can also be loaded. Then click on “Batch”.In the “Batch Analysis” window, select the location of the folder and the image files to be processed and then press “Run” (Figure 5B). After the images are processed, the results will be shown in the “Automated Measurement Results” window, as in Figure 4C. Export the raw data to Microsoft Excel for data analysis.Note: The threshold or parameters set can only be used on samples taken on the same day.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181213/20181213022438_7314.jpgFigure 5.",

B. “Batch Analysis” is used to select the .nd2 files to be selected for batch process using the same parameters.Analysis of images obtained from other microscope systemsDAPI and GFP Z-stack images obtained from other microscope systems can also be analyzed using the Nikon NIS Elements software, with some additional steps.Z-stack images must be exported into individual .tif format images at the original microscope system. Note: If there are 7 steps for a Z-stack, 7 individual images will be attained after exporting. Ensure that the file name is in sequence. For example D1.tif, D2.tif, D3.tif … D7.tif.At the menu bar, select: File > Import/Export > Create ND File from File Sequence.Select the folder containing the individual Z-stack images, and choose “Z Series” (red box, Figure 6A) and press “Convert”. This will convert the GFP images into a single .nd2 file.If the images are in RGB, after Step G4, at the menu bar select: Image > Convert > Convert to grey (Figure 6B). This step should be performed on the DAPI image.On the GFP Z-stack image, create a single, focused image by selecting “Create EDF Focused Document” button (Figure 1A).To overlap DAPI and GFP images, drag the window with the post-EDF GFP image into the DAPI image to create a single overlap .nd2 file.Continue with Steps E2 to F8.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181213/20181213022457_4382.jpgFigure 6.
