    "Transgene expression is assessed as total area of green fluorescence (pixel2) per visual field. A typical result is shown in Figure 2.\nTransgene expression can also be determined by Flow Cytometry.\n4.  Representative Results:\nFollowing the protocol outlined above, one can generate AAV serotype vectors efficiently. The typical yield is ~500  μL containing ~1011 vgs/ μL of purified vector stock. The purity of the vector stock is determined by comparing hybridization signals on quantitative DNA slot blots, with and without Benzonase digestion.  Purified rAAV3 vectors transduce human liver cancer - hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - cell lines efficiently.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2538/2538fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.\tQuantitative DNA slot-blot analysis for determining the titers of rAAV3 vectors. Two-fold dilutions of purified viral stocks, digested with Benzonase (top row) were analyzed on quantitative DNA slot blots with 32P-labeled EGFP-specific DNA probe. The titer of AAV3 vector was determined by comparison with 1 ng (middle row) or 10 ng (bottom row) of AAV-EGFP plasmid standards loaded on the membrane. The numbers correspond to DNA copies.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2538/2538fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. \tRecombinant AAV vector-mediated transgene expression in human liver cancer cells.  Hep293TT cells, a recently established human hepatoblastoma cell line4, were either mock-infected (left panel), or transduced with 5,000 vgs/cell of either scAAV2-EGFP or scAAV3-EGFP vectors at 37°C for 2 hours. Transgene expression was visualized 72 hours post-transduction using a fluorescence microscope."
