    "Experimental procedures were approved by the National and Institutional Ethical Committees.\n1. Transient Knock-down of DEPDC5 Gene in Zebrafish Embryo \nPreparation of tools:\nPrepare silicon elastomer-coated injection Petri dishes: Mix the base and curing agent of the kit (see Table of Materials) in a 10:1 ratio. Fill a 35 mm Petri dish halfway with the mixture. Wait for the silicon to harden before using it (this can take several days). \nPrepare 1.2 mmol/L stock solutions of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO; see Table of Materials). Add 250 µL of sterile water to 300 nmole lyophilized AMO to obtain a 1.2 mmol/L stock solution. For complete dissolution, heat the vials for 5 min at 65 °C. Vortex briefly. Seal the tube cap with a plastic film (see Table of Materials). \nFor the control rescue experiments, prepare an expression plasmid containing the human cDNA of DEPDC5 (see Table of Materials) cloned in the pCS2 backbone or a similar zebrafish-compatible expression plasmid. As a negative control, a mutation causing an early stop codon (p.Arg487*) was introduced in the cDNA.\nPrepare embryo water: 0.06 g/L aquarium salt (see Table of Materials) in reverse osmosis water + 0.5 mg/L methylene blue.\nThe day of the injection, prepare microinjection borosilicate glass needles using a puller (see Table of Materials). Establish appropriate temperature settings on the needle puller. Use a 10 cm long, 1/0.5 OD/ID mm borosilicate glass capillary to generate two ~5 cm capillaries with thin tips with a length of approximately 1 cm. \nIf the tip of the needles is very fine, preventing the ejection of solution, break the very end of the tapered tip using forceps under a microscope.",
    "Just prior to injection, prepare the working solutions of AMOs. Always prepare fresh solution to ensure the reproducibility of the results. Heat the AMO stock vials at 65 °C for 5 min. Prepare a 5 µL injection sample containing Fast Green dye (0.02% final concentration, see Table of Materials) and the AMO diluted at the working concentration in water. \nDetermine the working concentration of the AMO empirically for each gene using a dose response curve. The working concentration represents a concentration where the AMO is effective in knocking down the gene without causing general toxicity, such as gross morphological defects. Typically, AMO working concentrations will be in a range of 0.2 mmol/L to 1 mmol/L (0.4 mmol/L was determined as the effective concentration for this study18). Inject the control Mismatch morpholino at the same concentration as the effective AMO. \nVortex the tubes and centrifuge briefly to bring the droplets to the bottom of the tubes.\nFor rescue experiments, prepare a 5 µL injection sample with the AMO diluted at the working concentration and the cDNA expression plasmid diluted in water to a final concentration to be determined empirically. For the expression of DEPDC5 and the negative control plasmid, 100 ng/µL was effective for phenotypic rescue. \nEmbryo preparation:\nThe day prior to microinjection, set up the zebrafish mating tanks. The morning of the injection, remove the dividers to enable spawning. Collect the eggs in 100 mm Petri dishes filled with embryo water using a fine sieve. Inject within 20-30 min from collection, while the eggs are at the one cell stage.",
    "Pick 60-80 eggs with a plastic Pasteur pipette and arrange them in the silicon-coated Petri dish for injection. The silicon surface will prevent the eggs from sliding during the injections. Remove most of the embryo water, leaving just enough to cover the eggs halfway.\nMicroinjections:\n\t\nFill a glass needle with injection solution. Place the needle vertically in one of the tubes containing the injection solution, ensuring that the bottom end of the needle is touching the solution. Wait several minutes until the colored injection solution rises by capillarity and is visible at the tip of the needle.\nMount the filled needle on the injecting handle of the microinjector (see Table of Materials).\nTurn on the air compressor and adjust the pressure setting to generate an injection volume of ~2 nL. \nTo calculate the volume of the injected solution, place a drop of mineral oil on a microtome slide. Inject the dye-containing solution using the set pressure and time parameters. Measure the diameter of the injected fluid sphere and calculate total volume using the formula Volume=4/3*π*(d/2)3, where d=the measured diameter of the injected bolus.\nUsing a dissecting binocular microscope with a 4X magnification, inject the eggs at the single cell stage by passing through the chorion and the yolk, and projecting the solution directly within the cell.\nCollect the injected embryos in a 100 mm Petri dish with embryo water, label the dish and incubate them at 28 °C. \nEnsure that the incubator temperature is stable over time, as embryos development rate is thermosensitive. For example, the growth would be accelerated at higher temperatures and the developmental stage is critical for properly assessing the phenotype24.\nCheck the quality of the eggs 6-8 h after injection and remove dead and unfertilized embryos using a plastic Pasteur pipette.",
    "The next morning, count and remove dead embryos in each dish with a plastic Pasteur pipette.\n2. Behavior Analysis \nGlobal activity analysis at 28 hpf:\nConduct the test the afternoon of the day after microinjection (28 hpf), ensuring that the time of day at which the test is conducted is consistent over experiments to perform valid statistical analysis as embryos development is very rapid.\nFill a 35 mm dish (test dish) with embryo water and allow it to warm up in the incubator (28 °C) for at least 15 min prior to starting the test.\nPlace a plastic mesh grid (1.2x1.2 mm) cut to size, on the bottom of the test dish.\nHave another experimenter randomize the order of testing of the embryos and mask the names of the conditions to be tested. \nMake sure that the mortality rate does not change among conditions and compared to non-injected embryos to ensure the specificity of the phenotype. The percent of dead embryos in all conditions shall not exceed 10-13%18.\nPlace 10-12 embryos still within their chorion on the plastic mesh using a plastic Pasteur pipette. Fill the test dish with enough embryo water to keep the embryos submerged but not floating. If needed, move the embryos with care using a plastic tip to position them on the grid.\nUsing a video camera (see Table of Materials) attached to a dissection microscope, record the spontaneous coiling activity for a defined length of time (10-20 min long videos are usually sufficient to obtain representative samples of activity bursts for the quantification) \nReturn the embryos to their respective dish and put them back in the incubator. Repeat the experiment with as many embryos as needed for each condition (as determined by a 90% power analysis).",
    "To analyze total spontaneous movement, use a ZebraLab system (see Table of Materials). Using the activity quantification module, upload the recorded video and design the tracking arenas around each embryo as appropriate. Set the freeze and burst threshold to 10 and 50, respectively. \nRun the automated video analysis, which quantifies total activity inside each of the defined arenas, then recover the data set as a spreadsheet and perform the analysis using a data analysis software.\nTouch-Evoked-Escape-Response (TEER) at 48 hpf:\nConduct the test in the morning two days after the injection (48 h after the fertilization).\nAt least 2 h prior to testing, dechorionate the embryos using fine forceps. Ensure that the time of day for the dechorionation and the behavior test is consistent over experiments. \nFill a 130 mm dish (test dish) with embryo water and allow it to warm up in the incubator (28 °C) for at least 15 min prior to starting the test.\nCount and remove dead and morphologically deformed larvae. Record the numbers for each condition.\nHave another experimenter randomize the order and codify the names of the conditions to be tested.\nMount the camera (see Table of Materials) over the test dish making sure that the entire test dish is within the field of view. Placing a ruler within the field of view provides an internal calibration for distance.\nWith a plastic Pasteur pipette, put an embryo in the center of the test dish and begin the recording using an acquisition rate of 30 fps.\nWith a fine plastic tip, touch slightly the tail of the embryo with a flicking motion.\nStop the recording when the larva has terminated its movement.",
    "Remove the embryo from the test dish and place it in a new dish filled with embryo water. Repeat the test with as many embryos as needed for each condition (as determined by a 90% power analysis).\nReturn the embryos to their original dish and put them back in the incubator.\nTo analyze the parameters of the swimming behavior, load the recorded video to ImageJ analysis software. Download and install the Manual Tracking plugin of ImageJ (see Table of Materials). Launch the plugin by choosing Tools | Plugin | Manual Tracking in the menu. \nIn the dialog window, introduce the calibrated scale of the image. Including a ruler in the camera field facilitates the conversion of cm to pixels. \nSelect Add track and start the trajectory tracing by clicking on the image of the zebrafish larva in the first frame. The frames advance automatically with each point that is added to the trace. \nContinue tracing the movement until the end of the swimming episode. \nSelect End track on tracking window, retrieve the X-Y coordinates and calculate total distance, velocity and turning angle.\n3. Electrophysiological Analysis\nReagent and tool preparation:\nPrepare 1% agarose in embryo water (see section 1.1.4). Aliquot the liquid agarose in microcentrifuge tubes and keep these on a heating block at 42 °C to prevent the agarose from hardening.\nPrepare the recording solution (in mmol/L): NaCl 134, KCl 2.9, CaCl2 2.1, MgCl2 1.2, glucose 10, HEPES 10, pH 7.8.\nPull borosilicate glass micropipettes with a tip opening of 1.5-2 µm (5-6 Mm2·kg·s−3·A−2 resistance) unpolished.\nPreparation of zebrafish larvae for electrophysiology: \nPlace the fish in a glass-bottom Petri dish (see Table of Materials) and remove excess extracellular media in order to ensure the fish is brought as close to the cover slip as possible.",
    "Using a plastic Pasteur pipette, add warm liquid agarose on and around the larva. Use just enough agarose to cover the fish. While the agarose hardens, use fine forceps to orient the fish in a straight position, ventral side down, in the center of the dish. \nAdd 2 mL of the recording solution containing 10 µM Pancuronium bromide (see Table of Materials) to block neuromuscular transmission. The addition of the paralyzer is necessary to eliminate artefacts due to small movements during the recordings. \nElectrophysiological recording\nFill the micropipette with recording solution.\nWith the patch clamp amplifier (see Table of Materials) in voltage clamp configuration, measure electrode resistance in bath to confirm its correct value.\nUsing a 20x objective, position the head of the larva in the central field of view and lower the micropipette to reach the recording position in the brain, within the optic tectum.\nSwitch the patch clamp amplifier to current clamp and fix the holding current to 0 mA.\nUsing a low-pass filter of 1 kHz, an acquisition rate of 1 kHz and a digital gain of 10, record spontaneous activity for 60 min for determining baseline activity levels.\nAfter 1 h of baseline recording, add 200 µL pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, see Table of Materials) solution 300 mmol/L to the bath for a final concentration of 20 mmol/L PTZ.\nRecord the neuronal activity in PTZ for another 120 min.\nDepolarization event determination\nField recording events have very slow dynamics (frequencies of interest are in the range of 0.005-0.2 s-1). Therefore, filter the signal with a low pass (Butterworth 5th order LPF at 100 s-1) in order to avoid aliasing. Subsample the recorded voltage data from the acquisition frame rate (in this case, 1 ks-1) down to 250 s-1 (RAW SIGNAL).",
    "To identify the timestamps for each depolarization event, use a DETECTION SIGNAL, which is a high-pass filtered version of the recorded signal (Butterworth 1st order HPF at 0.01 s-1). \nBy eliminating the low frequency components, the detection of depolarization events can be performed using a simple thresholding method. Use a fixed threshold for noise elimination and event detection (0.3 mV was used for this study).\nCharacterize the depolarization event by a series of thresholds crossings that occur at time intervals smaller than 4 s. Compute the start and the end of depolarization event as determined from consecutive sequences of threshold crossings. Events that are shorter than 40 ms can be discarded as noise.\nCompute the amplitude of the events in the unfiltered (RAW SIGNAL) to eliminate errors due to the effect of the low pass filtering on the peak of the event. Select the depolarization wavelet from the raw signal using the timestamps determined in the filtered signal. Measure the amplitude as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the wavelet selected from the raw signal.\nNOTE: The script files to perform step 3.4 — Depolarization event determination — and to obtain Figure 1 are provided as Supplementary File attached to this article."
