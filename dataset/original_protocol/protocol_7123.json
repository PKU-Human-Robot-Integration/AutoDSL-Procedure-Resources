    "Reviving glycerol stock of L. innocua Remove vial of permanent culture of Listeria innocua ŽM39 transformed with pMSP::Nluc from deep freezer and place it on ice.Aseptically transfer culture to TSA plates containing 10 µg/mL erythromycin with sterile loop.Incubate at 37°C for 24 h.Overnight culture for biofilm inoculum or calibration curve culture preparation Prepare 5 mL of TSB medium with 10 μg/mL erythromycin in a 15 mL tube.Transfer biomass equivalent to three medium sized colonies from the TSA agar plate and inoculate it into the medium prepared above.Incubate with shaking (190 RPM) at 37°C for 18-24 h.Setting up biofilm in microtiter plate Centrifuge overnight culture at 3,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min.Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of TSB medium with 10 μg/mL erythromycin and 5 μL of nisin for Nluc induction (stock solution concentration: 1 mg/mL).Dilute the suspension until its OD600 value corresponds to 1 × 107 CFU/mL (see Note 1).Dilute bacterial suspension from Step C3 as required [e.g., 100-fold in TSB with 10 μg/mL erythromycin and 5 μL of nisin (stock solution concentration: 1 mg/mL) to obtain dilution corresponding to 1 × 105 CFU/mL].Pipette 50 μL of the bacterial suspensions per well onto the microtiter plate in triplicate.Incubate at 30°C (see Note 2) for a selected time period (e.g., 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h).Wash biofilm three time using 80 µL of PBS. After last wash, add 50 µL of PBS to each well. Proceed with bioluminescence measurement.Preparation of calibration curve (see Note 3) Before the measurement (8 h), prepare 5 mL of TSB medium with 10 μg/mL erythromycin and 5 μL of nisin (stock solution concentration: 1 mg/mL) in a 15 mL tube.",
    "Transfer 100 µL of the overnight culture (prepared in section B) to the medium and incubate with shaking (190 RPM) at 37°C for 8 h.Immediately before the measurement, calibrate the OD600 of the suspension to correspond to 5 × 107 CFU/mL. This is the bacterial output suspension for the calibration curve.In 1.5 mL tubes, prepare five consecutive five-fold dilutions that will serve as a calibration curve.Transfer 50 μL of dilutions to the biofilm plate in duplicate.Bioluminescence measurement Prepare the appropriate amount of substrate by mixing one volume of Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay Substrate with 50 volumes of Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay Buffer (e.g., 200 μL of Substrate in 10 mL of Buffer). Prior to use, incubate the substrate at 37°C to equal the temperature of the samples.Add 50 µL of substrate per well quickly with a multichannel pipette. Wait 3 min and then measure the bioluminescence for the first time using plate reader (e.g., Infinite M-1000, settings: Luminescence mode; Integration time, 1 s; Settle time, 150 ms; Figure 2).Measure bioluminescence at 10 min intervals three more times (see Note 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4308/bioprotoc-12-03-4308-g002.jpgFigure 2. Screenshot of microplate reader settings for measuring bioluminescence of Nluc. Calculating concentration of bacteria in biofilms Use Excel to calculate logarithms of bacterial concentrations and logarithms of corresponding average bioluminescence and use them to plot the calibration curve. A representative calibration curve is shown in Figure 3.Use linear regression (Excel functions: Slope and Intercept) to calculate biofilm cell concentrations from measured bioluminescence.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4308/bioprotoc-12-03-4308-g003.jpgFigure 3.
