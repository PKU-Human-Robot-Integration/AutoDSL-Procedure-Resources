    "DAY 1\n1. Dissection of the Spinal Cord Floor Plate (FP) from E12.5 Mouse Embryos\nNote: The entire procedure requires the use of sterile conditions. It is preferable to perform the dissection under a dissection hood to avoid contamination. The surface of the hood should be cleaned with ethanol. All dissection instruments must be sterilized and kept in a sterile Petri dish. The liquids (medium, dissection medium) must be kept closed and put in an ice bath. Each embryo should be collected in individual fresh drop. This is important for tissue preservation. The dissection is performed with Dumont #5 forceps. To transfer the embryos between dishes, grip the umbilical cord or the head without any damage to the hindbrain. It is critical not to damage the spinal cord to successfully complete the dissection. Prepare cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)-6.5% glucose and room temperature neurobasal medium.\n1.1 Spinal cord dissection\nAnimals are treated according to the animal care guidelines of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique following European directives. The method of euthanasia is cervical dislocation, it consist of applying pressure to the neck and dislocating the spinal column from the brain. This method is recommended for mouse animal models, and can be performed in a fast and efficient way.\nEuthanize a pregnant mouse at E12.5 of gestation (E0.5= first day following matting). Place the mouse ventral side up.\nSoak the abdomen with 70% ethanol. Pinch the skin of the abdomen with Adson forceps and cut through the skin and the peritoneal layers with surgical scissors. Make an incision and use it to cut on both side of the mouse to expose the abdominal cavity.",
    "A string of embryos is present on each side of the mouse. Grasp one horn of the uterus in the tissue between two embryos and dissect it out starting from the exterior part. Transfer the intact uterus to a 100 mm Petri dish with cold PBS on ice.\nExtract the embryos from extra-embryonic tissues. Grasp the placenta tissue (in dark red) with two pairs of forceps and pull softly to tear the tissue and remove the embryos from the uterine sac.\nNote: For a better conservation, collect the embryos from their uterine sac one by one.\nThe next steps are done under binocular magnifying glass and dissection hood. Place one embryo in a drop of cold HBSS-6.5% glucose.\nUsing forceps, decapitate the embryo.\nNote: Cut between the lower jaw and the hindbrain, the posterior part of the hindbrain is important for the next steps.\nPlace the embryo ventral face down with the anterior part facing the experimenter.\nPinch the skin of the embryo with one pair of forceps and with the other pair pull away the skin.\nNote: This step has to be repeated until the skin is completely removed from the anterior part of the embryo.\nTurn the embryo anterior side to the left. With one forceps \"pin down\" the embryo in the anterior part. With the other forceps grab the skin and pull towards the rostral side of the embryo. The spinal cord is then accessible.\nUse one side of the forceps to cut the meninges that still wrap the spinal cord. The spinal cord is now open.\nTurn the embryo anterior side to the right.",
    "Detach the tissue from the spinal cord starting from the cervical side of the embryo. Slide the forceps under the spinal cord (the forceps should be held closed to avoid spinal cord damage). The forceps have to be visible under the spinal cord. Small rotatory movements under the spinal cord are sufficient to detach the surrounding tissue and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG).\nNote: Leaving attached surrounding tissue add weight to the spinal cord, thus increasing the probability of breaking it during the next step.\nPlace the isolated spinal cord in a fresh drop of cold HBSS-6.5% glucose.\nPlace the spinal cord in a flat position, meninges on the top and anterior side away from the experimenter.\n\"Pin down\" the spinal cord using the remaining hindbrain with one forceps, and with the second forceps grab the meninges. Peel off the meninges starting from the rostral side of the spinal cord.\nNote: The movement should be slow and constant to avoid any breaking of the spinal cord. Vibratory movements can facilitate the detachment of the meninges.\n1.2 FP dissection\nPinch the hindbrain with one forceps.\nThe FP is the central transparent part of the tissue. Using a scalpel cut out the floor plate.\nNote: To cut both sides with the same quality, start from the rostral side and alternately cut the right side and the left side of the floor plate.\nConserve the dissected FP in Neurobasal medium at room temperature.\n2. FP Culture\nNote: All steps should be performed under sterile conditions in a tissue culture hood. Use fresh medium and freshly thawed supplements and reagents. Prepare sterile glass coverslips, warm neurobasal+B27, plasma, and HBSS-thrombin.\n2.1 FP culture\nPlace several sterile coverslips in a 100 mm Petri dish and pipette 20 μl plasma in the center of each coverslip.",
    "Transfer two to four FP in each plasma drop and add 20 μl HBSS-thrombin next to the plasma drop and carefully mix. Keep the coverslips for a minimum of ten minutes at room temperature to allow coagulation of the plasma.\nNote: Transfer two FPs in case of complete dissection and more in case of partial dissection. Mix slowly with a pipette tip and avoid contact with the FP explants.\nThe plasma clot retracts a few μm as a sign of the coagulation. The coagulation must not be stopped prematurely, to avoid detachment of the plasma clot.\nTransfer each coverslip in a 24-well plate and add 500 μl of Neurobasal+B27. Incubate 48 hr at 37 °C.\nDAY 3\n3. FP Conditioned Medium (FPcm) Harvesting\nNote: Harvesting should be performed under sterile conditions in a tissue culture hood. If the supernatant is contaminated or if floor plates are floating (meaning they might have died during the culture period) then do not harvest the FPcm from this well.\n3.1 FPcm harvesting\nHarvest carefully the medium from each well.\nNote: Do not pipette the polymerized plasma-thrombin mix or any FP fragments.\nStore 100 μl aliquots at -80 °C.\nDAY 4\n4. Dissection of Spinal Cord Commissural Neurons from E12.5 Mouse Embryos\nNote: This preparation does not need to be performed under sterile conditions. Follow the procedure described above to collect the embryos. Prepare cold PBS, cold HBSS-6.5% glucose and cold neurobasal.\n4.1 Spinal cord dissection\nUsing forceps, decapitate the embryo.\nNote: Cut between the lower jaw and the hindbrain, the posterior part of the hindbrain is important for the next steps.\nPlace the embryo ventral face down in a fresh drop with the anterior part facing the experimenter.",
    "Pinch the skin of the embryo with one forceps and with the other one pull away the skin.\nNote: This step has to be repeated until the skin is completely removed from the anterior part of the embryo.\nTurn the embryo anterior side to the left. With one forceps \"pin down\" the embryo in the anterior part. With the other forceps, grasp the skin and pull towards the rostral side of the embryo, to expose the spinal cord.\nUse one side of the forceps to cut the meninges that still wrap the spinal cord. The spinal cord is now exposed and open.\nPosition the embryo anterior side to the right.\nDetach the tissue from the spinal cord starting from the cervical side of the embryo. Slide the forceps under the spinal cord (keep the forceps closed). Forceps must visible under the spinal cord. Small rotatory movements under the spinal cord are sufficient to detach the adjacent tissue and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG).\nTransfer the isolated spinal cord in a new drop of cold HBSS-6.5% glucose.\nPlace the spinal cord in a flat position, meninges on the top and anterior side away from the experimenter.\n\"Pin down\" the spinal cord using the remaining hindbrain with one forceps, with the second forceps grab the meninges. Peel off the meninges starting from the rostral side of the spinal cord.\n4.2 Commissural Neuron dissection\nPinch the hindbrain with one forceps.\nThe Commissural neurons are located in the most lateral part of the spinal cord (the dorsal side). Cut out this lateral part with a fine scalpel.\nNote: The dorsal part of the spinal cord can be distinguished from the ventral part by difference of cell density, the ventral part being more opaque.",
    "Note: To cut both sides with the same quality, start from the rostral side and alternately cut a small length of the right side and of the left side.\nConserve the dissected tissue in Neurobasal medium on ice for immediate use.\n5. Treatment of Commissural Tissue with the FPcm\nNote: This procedure does not require sterile conditions. The tissue should be collected in individual 1.5 ml tubes. The frozen FPcm should be used only once. Avoid multiple refreezing. Prepare warm FPcm (37 °C).\n5.1 Treatments of commissural neurons\nDilacerate the commissural tissue with small scissors.\nNote: Cut the tissue as small as possible, to potentiate the accessibility of the cells.\nDistribute fairly the tissue between the different experimental conditions control treatment and FPcm treatment.\nCentrifuge the tissue fragments at 800 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.\nCheck the repartition between tubes.\nNote: If necessary redistribute and centrifuge again until fragments are equally distributed.\nRemove the supernatant.\nAdd the warm FPcm and control treatments to the tissues.\nNote: The volume must be adjusted to the amount of the pellet and should be at least twice the volume of the pellet.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nNote: Gently shake every 10-15 min\nCentrifuge at 800 x g for 1 min and remove the treatment.\nAdd the lysis buffer\nNote: The volume must be adjusted to the amount of the pellet and should be at least twice the volume of the pellet.\nPipette up and down to resuspend the pellet.\nNote: A vortex can also be used.\nIncubate 15 min on ice.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nKeep the supernatant and measure the amount of protein with a Bradford assay9.\nAdd 6x Laemmli Buffer.",
    "Incubate at 95 °C for 5 min to denature the protein content.\nNote: Samples can be used immediately or can be stored at -80 °C.\nAssess the effects of the treatment by Western blot10.\nNote: At least 50 μg of total proteins should be loaded for each lane.Subscription Required.
