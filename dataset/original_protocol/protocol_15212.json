    "1. Patient Preparation\nObtaining informed consent.\nIdentify land marks on the chest for accurate lead placement. In order to minimize ECG artifact and noise the Mason-Likar electrode configuration is used in which limb lead electrodes are placed on the torso rather than the distal extremities (Figure 2).23\nPrep the skin of the torso with alcohol prep pads and dry briskly with gauze pads to ensure optimal skin electrode contact.\nIf necessary, clip chest hair at the specific torso locations in order to make adequate contact with the skin electrode. Perform this step with caution as many of this patient population receive anticoagulation therapy and are therefore prone to bleeding.\nUse indelible ink, if possible, to mark the skin electrode sites to ensure electrodes are returned to the correct location in the event they fall off or are removed for procedures (i.e., echocardiograms, chest X-ray, etc.).\nIn women, electrode V3 should be placed on top of the breast tissue and electrodes V4 and V5 should be placed immediately below a pendulous breast so that the breast lies on top of the electrode in order to ensure accurate placement and prevent motion artifact.\nDual monitoring is used in this study, the hospital bedside monitor and the research Holter recorder. Hence, two ECG skin electrodes are applied to the torso.\nConnect ECG lead wires to the skin electrodes before placing the electrodes on the patient's chest to prevent unnecessary pressure on the chest.Radiolucent skin electrodes are applied in order to avoid removal for radiographic procedures.\nEnter the patient's unique research identification number (de-identified) into the Holter device and start ECG monitoring.\nPlace the Holter recorder in a monitor pouch, and place via a lanyard around neck or place in the gown pocket.",
    "Obtain positional ECGs for use during the off-line analysis of the ECG data. The three positions to include are: 1) supine, 2) right side, and 3) left side lying.\nAssess the patient at least every 2 hr when the research staff is present in the hospital and at the end of the day-time shift to ensure monitoring is maintained over night. Staff education of nurses, and ancillary staff (i.e., X-ray, echocardiography, and catheterization technicians) is done to ensure skin electrodes are replaced if removed for a procedure. A torso diagram with correct electrode placement is left at the bedside as a resource so that staff can replace the skin electrodes if necessary as well as extra skin electrodes.\nIf the patient goes to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, connect the radiolucent lead wires to the skin electrodes so that ECG monitoring can be maintained during the catheterization procedure to ensure continuous monitoring.\nWhen monitoring is completed, the equipment is cleaned with antimicrobial wipes.\n2. ECG Analysis Procedure\nAt the completion of monitoring (may vary in duration), load the compact flashcard from the ECG Holter recorder onto the flashcard reader of H-Scribe research computer.\nPrepare the data for analysis by identifying and labeling each QRS complex as normal, ventricular, supraventricular or artifact with the H-Scribe arrhythmia analysis software.\nInitial assessment of the ECG data is done without knowledge of clinical data, to minimize bias.\nThe H-Scribe software is programmed to identify transient myocardial ischemia using the standard definition; ST deviation (elevation or depression) ≥ 100 microvolts in ≥ 2 ECG lead(s) lasting ≥ 60 sec.32 In this study, ST-segment deviation is measured at 60 msec past the J-point.",
    "ST-segment changes meeting these criteria are identified and labeled by the H-Scribe and indicated on the analysis summary. Human oversight to verify whether ischemia is present must be done for any computer generated event in order to ensure false positive ST-segment changes are identified correctly. This process will be described below.\nST-segment trends are assessed for changes suggestive of acute ischemia an efficient method of evaluating hours of continuously acquired ECG data (Figure 3).\nIn order to identify true myocardial ischemia, any trend suggestive of acute ischemia is assessed by obtaining three ECGs:\n\t\nBaseline ECG prior to the ST-segment changes, identified as 'pre-event ECG'\nAn ECG during the maximum point of ST segment deviation, identified as 'max event ECG'\nAn ECG when ST-segment deviation has completely resolved, identified as 'post-event ECG'\nAssess each of the three ECGs to ensure the ST changes are not due to false positive changes (e.g., accelerated ventricular rhythm, intermittent ventricular pacing rhythm, intermittent bundle branch block, or body position changes).20\nMissing ECG data, data of insufficient quality and false-positive ST changes are excluded from the analysis. These problems will be minimized by using several strategies. These include (1) use of radiolucent ECG electrodes, eliminating the need to remove the electrodes for X-rays; (2) high quality skin prep by research nurses performed at the outset of monitoring; (3) rounding every 2 hr on patients throughout the day; and (4) availability by phone to answer concerns or questions from the nursing and medical staff. Additionally, the research team communicates with both nursing and medical staff on a regular basis.\nOnce the ECG data is analyzed the patient's medical record is used to identify dates/times of treatments, medications and symptoms during the monitoring period.",
    "Verification of ECG analysis is ensured by having a second expert analyze the ECG data using the same methodology described above in a designated proportion of the sample. Our team does this for 20% of the patients enrolled.\nFor research purposes, archive de-identified ECG data onto an external hard drive and/or onto a network drive to ensure the data is saved appropriately."
