    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLibrary Preparation\nTiming: 1 day\nDuring this step, the 3′-5N-adapter is ligated to the RNA molecules, followed by RT primer hybridization, ligation of the 5′-5N-adapter, RT-PCR, and PCR amplification of the cDNA products. At the end of the day, you will have purified PCR libraries, ready to use for size selection.\nClean all surfaces and pipets with RNase ZAP.\nPrepare an ice bucket for all reagents and reaction mixtures, work on ice until the PCR amplification step (step 7).\n3′-5N-adapter ligation.\nPre-heat a thermocycler to 70°C.\nTake a PCR tube with dried PEG 8000 and add 4 μL plasma EV RNA, resuspend carefully. The PEG pellet at the bottom of the tube will take up 1 μL of the total volume.\nAdd 1 μL isomiR spike-in pool (100 pM = 100 amol each).\nAdd 1 μL 3′-5N-adapter (100 nM).\nMix by pipetting.\nThe total volume is 7 μL.\nIncubate for 2 min at 70°C in a thermocycler.\nAdd (pre-mixed):\n10 μL 3′ ligation buffer (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\n3 μL 3′ ligation enzyme mix (part of the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nThe total volume is 20 μL.\nIncubate for 1 h at 25°C in a thermocycler.\nNote: When preparing a pre-mix for multiple samples, prepare 10% more than necessary.\nNote: When using less than 4 μL of plasma EV RNA, adjust the total volume with Nuclease free water (step 3f).",
    "Note: Because RNA from low input samples, e.g., plasma EV, is difficult to accurately quantify, it’s preferred to use equal volumes of input RNA (= maximum 4 μL). To determine the presence of amplifiable miRNAs prior to library preparation, a QC qRT-PCR can be performed. For this, 3 μL 1:10 diluted RNA is reverse transcribed using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit in a multiplex reaction containing RT-primers for hsa-miR-486-5p (high abundance in plasma EV), hsa-miR-21-5p (intermediate abundance) and hsa-miR-10b-5p (low abundance).8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] After cDNA synthesis Nuclease free water is added up to a final volume of 50 μL. 3 μL of cDNA is added to PCR primers for the miRNA targets and the TaqMan Universal PCR master mix. The mixture is subjected to 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min on an ABI 7500 Fast system. All samples are measured in duplicate, and data is analyzed using 7500 Software v2.0.6.\nOptional: When preparing libraries from cellular RNA or other high input samples, use 200 ng of RNA and 1 μL 2.5 μM 3′-5N-adapter.\nRT primer hybridization.\nAdd (pre-mixed):\n4.5 μL Nuclease free water.\n1 μL SR RT primer (1:50) (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nMix by pipetting.\nThe total volume is 25.5 μL.\nIncubate for 5 min at 75°C, 15 min at 37°C, 15 min at 25°C in a thermocycler.\nNote: When preparing a pre-mix for multiple samples, prepare 10% more than necessary.\nOptional: When preparing libraries from cellular RNA or other high input samples, use 1:2 diluted SR RT primer.\n5′-5N-adapter ligation.\nPre-heat a thermocycler to 70°C.\nTransfer 1 μL of 5′-5N-adapter (225 nM) to a clean PCR tube.\nDenature the 5′-5N-adapter for 2 min at 70°C.\nPlace on ice.",
    "Add 1 μL of the denatured 5′-5N-adapter (225 nM) to the reaction mixture from step 4d.\nAdd 1 μL 5′ ligation buffer (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nAdd 2.5 μL 5′ ligation enzyme mix (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nMix by pipetting.\nThe total volume is 30 μL.\nIncubate for 1 h at 25°C in a thermocycler.\nNote: When preparing 5′-5N-adapter for multiple samples, prepare and denature 10% more than necessary.\nOptional: When preparing libraries from cellular RNA or other high input samples, use 1 μL 5.63 μM 5′-5N-adapter.\nReverse transcription.\nAdd (pre-mixed):\n8 μL First strand synthesis reaction buffer (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\n1 μL Murine RNase inhibitor (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\n1 μL ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nMix by pipetting.\nThe total volume is 40 μL.\nIncubate for 1 h at 50°C in a thermocycler.\nNote: When preparing a pre-mix for multiple samples, prepare 10% more than necessary.\nPCR amplification.\nAdd 5 μL Nuclease free water.\nAdd 2.5 μL SR primer for Illumina (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nAdd 2.5 μL INDEX (X) primer (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nAdd 50 μL LongAmp Taq 2× master mix (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nMix by pipetting.\nThe total volume is 100 μL.\nIncubate:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3052_3.csv",
    "Critical: Decide in advance which samples will be sequenced simultaneously in a single sequence run to make sure each sample has a unique index that can be de-multiplexed afterwards. Depending on which NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina is purchased, a total of 48 INDEX primers are available, “X” refers to the number of the index primer.\nOptional: When preparing libraries from cellular RNA or other high input samples, reduce the number of PCR cycles to 15.\nPCR cleanup and concentration, according to the Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit.\nTransfer the 100 μL PCR amplified sample from step 7g to a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 700 μL DNA Cleanup Binding Buffer and mix by pipetting.\nInsert the column into the collection tube.\nLoad the 800 μL sample onto the column.\nCentrifuge for 1 min, discard the flow-through (this is waste).\nRe-insert the column into the collection tube.\nAdd 200 μL DNA Wash Buffer.\nCentrifuge for 1 min, discard the flow-through (this is waste).\nRe-insert the column into the collection tube.\nAdd 200 μL DNA Wash Buffer.\nCentrifuge for 1 min, discard the flow-through (this is waste).\nTransfer the column to a clean 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 25 μL Nuclease free water to the center of the matrix.\nIncubate at 20°C–22°C for 1 min.\nCentrifuge for 1 min to elute the cDNA.\nStore the DNA eluate at −80°C until further use.\nCritical: Make sure no residual buffer is left in or attached to the outlet of the column after the second centrifugation step with DNA wash buffer (step 8k). This buffer contains ethanol that may interfere with the sample loading into the gel in the next phase of the protocol. If residual buffer is present, add an additional centrifugation step.",
    "Note: All centrifugation steps are performed at maximum speed at 20°C–22°C in a microcentrifuge.\nNote: Often, less than 25 μL sample will be recovered from step 8o. This doesn’t have any negative effect on the subsequent steps of the protocol.\nPause point: Samples can be stored for 16 h or up to 1 week at −80°C.\nGel size selection and purification\nTiming: 3 days\nIn this step the adapter-ligated miRNAs are separated from unwanted products, e.g., adapter-dimers, single adapters and/or larger RNA molecules. After elution and precipitation the libraries are ready for quantification, pooling and sequencing.\nGel size selection.\nTake 2 × 6% Novex TBE PAGE gel 1 mM 10-well, remove the white strip and comb, rinse the wells with demineralized water.\nIndicate the position of the different samples if preferred.\nPlace the gels in an XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System and fill both inner and outer chambers with 1× Novex TBE Running Buffer.\nPrepare samples:\nUse 25 μL sample from step 8p and add 5 μL Gel Loading Dye (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nUse 12.5 μL Nuclease free water and add 2.5 μL Gel Loading Dye for empty wells.\nUse 5 μL of Quick-Load pBR322 DNA-MspI Digest (ready-to-use, part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina) as a molecular weight marker to guide size selection.\nLoad samples and marker (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3052_4.csv\nEach sample is divided in 2 wells, to prevent overloading and obtain a better size separation.\nDifferent samples are separated by either an empty well or the molecular weight marker to prevent cross-contamination during the excision of the correct sized bands.\nRun the gels for 1 h and 15 min at 120 V.",
    "Carefully remove the gels from the cassette and place them in 1× Novex TBE Running Buffer.\nIncubate the gel for 2–3 min in 1× Novex TBE Running Buffer (50 mL) with 1:20000 Ethidium Bromide (2.5 μL). Leave the second gel in buffer without Ethidium Bromide until ready for processing.\nImage the gel using a UV transilluminator.\nExcise the band corresponding to adapters containing 22 nt miRNA inserts (expected size ∼151 nt) as tight as possible using a carbon steel surgical blade (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Avoid including adapter-dimers as much as possible (expected size of adapter-dimers 129 nt). The sample that was divided in 2 wells can be excised as 1 band and processed as 1 sample in the subsequent steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3052-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of a Novex TBE gel before and after size selection of the adapter-ligated miRNA products\nFor documentation image the gel again after excision of the correct band.\nPlace the gel piece in a gel breaker tube; this is a 0.5 mL tube punctured at the bottom with a 21 gauge needle and subsequently placed in a 2 mL tube (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3052-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Wear protective clothing, gloves, cover all exposed skin and use a face shield.\nNote: Running the gels for 1 h and 15 min at 120 V gives the most optimal separation between adapter-ligated 22 nt miRNA inserts and unwanted adapter-dimers.\nNote: The presence of PEG affects the sample running through the gel, the correct size bands are present slightly higher than expected (∼160–165 nt instead of the expected ∼151 nt).",
    "Note: Longer incubation times of the gels with Ethidium Bromide will not increase signal intensity for low input samples, but may increase sample loss.\nOptional: Instead of performing a manual gel size selection, an automated size selection with the BluePippin can be used (Sage Science, 3% Agarose gel cassette), following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nOptional: Different electrophoresis systems and corresponding gels may be used, make sure to optimize the running time to get the most optimal separation between adapter-ligated 22 nt miRNA inserts and unwanted adapter-dimers.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]; High level of adapter-dimers.\nElution of the libraries from the gel.\nCentrifuge the sample from step 9L for 2 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge at 20°C–22°C.\nMake sure all gel pieces passed the punctured 0.5 mL tube into the 2 mL tube.\nAdd 250 μL DNA Gel Elution buffer (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina).\nShake for 16 h at 1400 rpm at 20°C–22°C in a thermoshaker.\nNote: Do not incubate longer than 24 h.\nPrecipitation of the libraries.\nTransfer the eluate and gel debris from step 10d to a Spin-X Centrifuge Tube Filter with 0.45 μm Pore CA Membrane, use filter-tips with a small piece removed from the end of the tip.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed at 20°C–22°C.\nTransfer the DNA containing eluate to a DNA LoBind Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 1 μL Linear Acrylamide (part of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina), mix by flicking the tube.\nAdd 1 μL GlycoBlue, mix by flicking the tube.\nAdd 25 μL 3 M NaAc (pH 5.5, from −20°C), mix by flicking the tube.\nAdd 750 μL 100% Ethanol (from −20°C), mix by inverting the tube.\nPrecipitate the sample for 16–24 h at −80°C.\nPre-cool a microcentrifuge to 4°C.",

Wear protective clothing and gloves, work in a fume hood when possible.\nPause point: The precipitation step at −80°C (step 11h) can be extended up to 3 days.\nLibrary quantification and quality control\nTiming: 5 h\nIt is recommended to use the KAPA Library Quantification method (Roche) for quantification of low input plasma EV libraries. Quantification with bioanalyzer, TapeStation or fragment-analyzer results in 3 to 10-fold higher library concentrations compared to the KAPA kit, which may overstate the true library yield. More importantly, using the KAPA Library Quantification method (Roche) to prepare equimolar library pools ultimately results in less variation in sequencing yield between libraries. A quality control PCR using a forward primer directed against a miRNA (in this case hsa-miR-486-5p) and a reverse primer against the 3′-adapter is additionally used to determine the presence of adapter-ligated miRNAs.\nLibrary quantification using KAPA PCR.\nTake the 1:10 diluted libraries from step 11u.",

    "Critical: Prepare a library pool consisting only of similar or comparable low input, low complexity samples. When mixing low input samples (e.g., plasma EV) with high input samples (e.g., cellular RNA) this may lead to a phenomenon called “index hopping” (Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]; Index hopping).\nNote: Sequencing on a non-patterned flow cell (MiSeq, NextSeq 500) or using different setting (Paired-End 100/150 or Single-Read) is possible but it is preferred not to use different platforms or settings when sequencing large patient sample cohorts.\nOptional: To determine the quality of the sequence run and possibly correct for batch effects a control library can be added to each library pool. Prepare a large amount of a control small RNA library (preferably from similar input material as the material of interest), that can be added to multiple sequence runs. Store the control library in aliquots at -80°C.\nOptional: Data processed by sRNAbench can be downloaded and analyzed according to the user’s preferences.
