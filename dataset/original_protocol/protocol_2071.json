    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of cells and oligonucleotides transfection\nTiming: variable 24–48 h\nThe following steps describes the procedure of how to deliver 6-FAM labeled oligonucleotides to the cells using the Lipofectamine® 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We have utilized this procedure for the delivery of 6-FAM labeled oligonucleotides successfully with several cell lines including HeyA8, OVCAR8, OVCAR5. Standard working concentrations of oligonucleotides are 2 nM–5 nM. The optimal oligonucleotides concentration should be determined in preliminary experiments for each cell type.\nSeed 1 × 104 HeyA8 cells per well of 24-well plate in 1 mL of culture medium per well for transfection.\nNext day, transfect the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 5′ 6-FAM-labeled oligonucleotides (n=2, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). In brief, 2 nM oligonucleotides were added to 100 μL Opti-MEM medium and 2.5  μL lipofectamine 2000 was added to 100 μL Opti-MEM medium. Both solutions were incubated at 20°C–25°C for 5 min, before, the oligonucleotide solution was added to the lipofectamine solution. The mixture was then incubated at 20°C–25°C for 20 min and then transfection mixture was added to the cells. After 4 h, the transfection reagent containing medium was changed to regular culture medium.\nAfter 24 h of transfection, cells were trypsinized and counted for cell density using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer.\nCells were resuspended to a density of 1 × 103 cells in 1,200 μL of growth media and then added 100 μL equally into the wells of 12-well glass bottom chamber slides.\nCells were allowed to attach on glass bottom for 5 min under the hood, then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.",
    "For MYC knockdown, 5 nM pre-designed siRNAs for human MYC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were transfected using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent according to manufacturer instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in HeyA8 cells. After 48 h, cells were again transfected with 5′FAM-labeled oligonucleotides.\nCritical: The confluency of cells for PLA assay, should be at 40%–60% confluency. Too few cells will cause the culture to grow poorly without cell-to-cell contact. High confluency of cells results in contact inhibition, making cells resistant to the uptake of foreign DNA. Actively dividing cells take up introduced DNA better than quiescent cells. Therefore, cell density is an important parameter that impacts transfection efficiency.\nCritical: One crucial factor is to ensure that the cells are in a healthy state, properly mixed and evenly distributed into the wells. Cells should be checked before the incubation at 37°C to make sure that the suspended cells are homogeneously distributed in each well without cellular aggregation. When this is confirmed, do not further shake the slides until the cells are attached. After 24 h growth, the cells should be checked for green color (FAM fluorophore) in a microscope before doing PLA.\nFixation, permeabilization, and blocking of cells\nTiming: 50 min\nAspirate off media, wash with 1× DPBS and fix the cells with 4% PFA in PBS (fixative solution) for 20 min at 25°C.\nGently discard the fixative solution.\nWash with 1× DPBS and add 100 μL of ice-cold methanol or acetone to cells.\nIncubate at −20°C for 15–30 min to permeabilize.\nGently discard the methanol solution.\nWash the cells two times with 1× DPBS gently.\nAdd 50 μL of the blocking solution on chambers glass slide and incubate for 1 h at 4°C in a humidified chamber.\nOligonucleotide’s hybridization\nTiming: 1 h process overnight",
    "Add 100 nM specific biotin labeled oligonucleotide probes to fresh blocking buffer, heat at 70°C for 3 min, put on ice immediately and add 30 μL in each well of a chamber glass slide. Incubate for 1 h at 37°C or alternatively at 4°C overnight in a humidified chamber.\nCritical: Heating probes at 70°C for 3 min, then immediately cool in an ice-water bath increases the efficiency of probe binding to the target site.\nPrimary antibody incubation\nTiming: Overnight\nTo detect the RNA-protein proximal interaction, dilute both primary antibodies biotin (anti-mouse) and FXR1 (anti-rabbit) in 1:100 ratio as the final dilution in the 1× antibody diluent.\nCritical: The concentration and species source of the primary antibodies are essential for the detection of protein-protein or RNA-protein interactions, as discussed previously. Therefore, to choose the appropriate antibodies for the PLA assay, one should perform in advance both a positive and a negative control. For example, we used the same dilution condition for biotin antibody alone or FXR1 antibody alone for primary antibody incubation followed by proximity ligation probe hybridization with PLA probes. Similarly, we used PLA probe Anti-Rabbit Plus and PLA probe Anti-Mouse Plus for FXR1 detection. This allowed us to determine if the primary antibody is suitable for PLA assay. For a negative control, we used two PLA probes Anti-Mouse Plus for biotin and Anti-Rabbit Plus for FXR1. The same coupled oligonucleotides will not allow the ligation between them, therefore, any signals detected under this condition should be considered as non-specific background. We also used no primary antibodies and no PLA probes controls, which further confirms specificity of your antibodies and PLA probes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1662-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. FXR1 binds to the AU-rich elements (ARE) within MYC 3′UTR",
    "Representative fluorescence images of HeyA8 cells, prior transfected with FAM-labeled MYC oligonucleotides (Probe1 and 2), and then, replated, fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-FXR1 antibody and oligonucleotide PLA probes anti-sense to MYC 3′UTR. MYC was transiently knockdown using MYC siRNA followed by FAM-labeled cMYC oligonucleotides (Probe 1) treatment. PLA was performed to detect the interaction of FXR1 protein and the MYC mRNA (yellow merge color); nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Images were zoomed in by x4 times to show FXR1 protein and MYC mRNA colocalization in cells. Scale bars: 50 and 20 μm, respectively.\nAdd a solution of 1× PBS in each well without removing the blocking solution and gently aspirate with vacuum pump immediately.\nAdd 30 μL of the corresponding primary antibodies solution in the chamber slide and incubate for overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber.\nNote: Do not allow the sample to dry. Fill with 1× PBS in non-used wells of the chamber slides.\nAdd Wash Buffer A in each well. Incubate on a shaker at slow speed (10–30 × g) for 5 min. Remove the wash buffer with vacuum pump and repeat this step twice.\nNote: The Wash buffer is conserved at 4°C. Before using, it should be recovered at 20°C–25°C during ∼30 min to reach the 20°C–25°C.\nProximity ligation probe hybridization\nTiming: 60 min\nDilute the two PLA probes Anti-Mouse Plus and Anti-Rabbit Plus stock solutions in antibody diluent to 1:5 dilution.\nAdd 30 μL of the PLA probes mixed solution on the chamber slide. Incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nAdd Wash Buffer A in each well. Incubate on a shaker at low speed. Remove the wash buffer with vacuum pump and repeat this step twice.",
    "Note: During the washing step, one should start to prepare the ligation solution at 20°C–25°C for the next step.\nOligonucleotide ligation\nTiming: 45 min\nAt the second time of the washing step, prepare the ligation reaction solution as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1662_5.csv\nNote: Ligase should stay on ice block. However, the prepared mix should stay at 20°C–25°C.\nGently remove the wash buffer A with a vacuum pump after the second wash of ligation solution.\nAdd 30 μL of the ligation reaction mix on the cover glass. Incubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nAdd Wash Buffer A in each well. Incubate on a shaker at low speed. Remove the wash buffer with a vacuum pump and repeat this step twice.\nNote: During the washing step, one should start to prepare the rolling cycle amplification solution at 20°C–25°C for the next step, and make sure that the amplification solution is protected from light.\nRolling cycle amplification\nTiming: 90 min\nAt the second time of the previous step, prepare the amplification reaction mix as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1662_6.csv\nNote: The amplification buffer contains fluorescent dyes and should be protected from light. This mix should stay at 20°C–25°C.\nGently remove the wash buffer A with a vacuum pump after the second time of previous step.\nAdd 30 μL of the amplification reaction mix in the chamber slide. Incubate for 1.5 h at 37°C in the dark.\nAdd wash Buffer B in each well. Incubate on a shaker at low speed. Remove the wash buffer with a vacuum pump and repeat this step twice.\nNote: The slide should be protected from light during this step.\nRolling cycle amplification washing\nTiming: 20 min\nGently remove the wash buffer B with a vacuum pump.\nAdd 100 μL of 0.01× wash buffer B diluted in high purity water.",
    "Note: Users can process the samples at this step for further immunostaining by using antibody of their choice and routine immunofluorescence assay. Please avoid performing further immunostaining without washing at least once with 1:100 diluted wash buffer B since high concentration of buffer B may diminish the antibody staining efficacy.\nRemove the chambers with the help of clean forceps.\nAir-dry for 2 min.\nNote: Protect from light. Alternatively, the slide can be further processed for cytoplasmic staining or co-staining with immunofluorescence. Please avoid overly drying which will decrease the PLA signal intensity.\nSlide mounting\nTiming: 15–30 min\nAdd 50 μL of PLA mounting medium on glass slide.\nAlternatively: Add 50 μL of mounting medium with DAPI on glass slide.\nCarefully with the help of forceps put the cover slip over slide slowly to make sure mounting medium spread all over the slide.\nNote: Avoid producing air bubbles in the process.\nSeal with nail polish. Alternatively, if one uses ProLong Glass Antifade Mountant, (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36931), sealing with nail polish is not necessary.\nPause point: The slide can be stored at 4°C for long time before processing to microscopy image acquisition. In our laboratory, we have tested to store the slides for maximum 3 months at 4°C and we do not see obvious decrease of the fluorescence intensity.\nCritical: Do not freeze the slide. Freezing at −20°C or −80°C will create large crystal particles in the mounting medium which will influence the image acquisition quality.\nConfocal microscope setup and imaging",
    "Timing: Variable, it may take multiple sessions of several hours (4–24 h) to obtain sufficient data. The pixel resolution for the different objective lens used will depend on the specific parameters and the confocal microscope being used. We list the key parameters required for the image acquisition in the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1662_7.csv\nScan images at 20× lens first to locate the cells on slide followed by scanning with 40× lens. At least 3 images for each group should be captured and saved for further analysis.\nNote: Scanning images using 20× lens first is helpful to have a general view of the distribution of signals and to identify the cells of interest, which is a preliminary step before locating the scanning position using 40× or 63× lens. Process image acquisition with 20× objective, starting with DAPI channel (450 nm), then FAM channel (488 nm), then Cy3 channel (545 nm).\nNote: If you are using different fluorescent tag for the detection of proximity ligation assay, please optimize the corresponding filter. The PLA fluorescence are available for four different colors. Apart from the color used in this protocol, three additional fluorophores are also applicable. For green fluorescence, one should use a 488 nm/527 nm filter; For Cy3 orange fluorescence, one should use a 554 nm/576 nm filter; and for Cy5 far red fluorescence, one should use a 644 nm/670 nm filter.\nCritical: All slides from the same experiment should be imaged using the same conditions. At 40× don’t forget to use water on lens and keeping the slides facing glass cover on the bottom. Check to see if there is any fluorescence in an unstained well of the slide. If there is, then this is autofluorescence in the cells.\nPLA signal analysis and quantification",
    "Images acquired by Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope are saved as TIFF format. Zeiss software (LSM 510) allows the user to access images with TIFF format. The relative number of PLA dots were then quantified using ImageJ software as below.\nOpen a TIFF image in image J software, in the main menu of software and go to Process/Binary/Make Binary to convert the TIFF images into Binary format.\nAfter converting images to binary format, select region of interest that represent only one cell by using selection tool from main menu. Then, select Process/Filter/Median 2.0. Click main menu again and select Process/Binary/Watershed to segment spots (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1662-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental workflow employed to quantitate PLA signals per cell\n(A) Images of in situ PLA were captured using mouse anti-Biotin targets MYC mRNA and rabbit anti-FXR1 antibody in HeyA8 cells that were transfected with 6-FAM MYC mRNA (Green) and MYC probe P1.Scale bar: 20 μm.\n(B) PLA signals generated were labeled individually and quantified using Image J software, where cross marks indicate PLA signals.\n(C) Quantitative graph of PLA dots was identified per cell. Error bars represents mean ± SEM; ∗∗p<0.01 and n=4.\nIn the main menu of image J, select Process/Find Maxima to exclude edge maxima and light background. Select “Count” in the output type. This gives automatic calculation of PLA spots which are presented as medium ± standard deviation for 3 different images (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Select “Point section” in the output type. This marks each PLA spots with yellow crosses from single cell.\nAnalysis and quantification of co-localization coefficients\nIn this protocol we determined the co-localization between MYC mRNA and FXR1 protein and, co-localization coefficients were calculated using the JACoP plugin in ImageJ.",
    "Open a high magnification (400×) TIFF image in image J software and identify the cells that shows good interaction between MYC mRNA and FXR1 protein. Go to main menu of image J and select Image/Color/Split image. Split the image into individual images displaying MYC (green), PLA dots (red), and DAPI. Save the individual images (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1662-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Experimental workflow of how colocalization coefficient was determined for RNA-protein proximal interactions\n(A) Representative images show colocalization of MYC mRNA and FXR1 protein were captured and presented as 3D surface intensity plots. Scale bar: 20 μm.\n(B) Workflow employed for determining colocalization signals using JACoP plugin for ImageJ and the signal overlap using Manders’ coefficient value for both A (Green) overlapping B (Red) i.e., M1 and B (Red) overlapping A (Green) i.e., M2.\n(C) Quantitative violin plot represents colocalization coefficient of MYC mRNA and FXR1 protein. Data in the graphs represent mean ± SEM; ∗∗∗∗p<0.0001, n=8.\nSelect Plugin/JAcoP in the main menu of image J and choose the two channels for analysis in JACoP, e.g., Red (PLA dot) for Image A and Green (MYC) for Image B. Save these images.\nGo to analysis tab in the main menu and select the parameter appropriate to you. We used Overlap and Manders’ coefficients in our analysis.\nNote: Overlap coefficient is based on Pearson’s coefficient signal that is dependent on linear signals while Manders’ coefficient is based on ratios of two signals on top of the compartment and vice versa. Two independent correlation coefficient analysis will provide more accurate degree of relationship between co-localization signals.\nSelect Analysis or Threshold commands in the window, then adjust the signal for channel A and B to the level that can clearly differentiate between background without signal saturation. Click analyze (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "After clicking analyze, a data window will open in image J. Record the Manders’ coefficients and Overlap coefficient (using threshold value for both, A overlapping B, and B overlapping A).\nPlot the data in the form of table or graph, then perform statistical analysis using quantitated values (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad software."
