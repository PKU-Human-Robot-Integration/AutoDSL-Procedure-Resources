    "1. Priming the Osmotic Pump\nUse sterile techniques (e.g. gloves, laminar flow hood) when preparing the pumps. Remove the pump and flow moderator from the packaging. Weigh the empty pump and record the weight (mg).\nFill the pump slowly, to avoid creating air bubbles, by using a small 1cc syringe and blunt-tipped 27G filling tube. When the solution reaches the top of the pump, stop filling.\nWipe off the excess solution and weigh the filled pump. For most aqueous solutions, the weight in mg is the same as the volume in μl. The difference in empty versus filled weight should be more than 90% of the specified mean fill volume. If not, evacuate the pump with the syringe and refill. If you experience technical difficulty please refer to the troubleshooting section of the pump instructions at http://www.alzet.com/products/guide_to_use/filling.html \nUse a pair of forceps to break the white flange from the flow moderator; be careful not to bend or crush the tube. Attach a P50 catheter to either end of the moderator, covering about 3-4 mm. Use a syringe to fill the catheter and attached moderator and leave the syringe attached to the distal part of the catheter.\nInsert the flow moderator into the pump until the catheter is flush with the pump surface. Then, remove the syringe from the distal end of the catheter. Place the pump in a sterile 0.9% saline or PBS solution in a 37 °C incubator for a minimum of 6 hr (preferably O/N) to prime the pump before implanting it into the mouse. The pump delivery rate varies with the model number (i.e. Model 1002 = 0.25 μl/hr for 14 days).\n2. Creating Unilateral Hindlimb Ischemia in the Mouse",
    "Anesthetize the mice with isoflurane set between 2-4% in 100% O2 at a flow rate of 0.4 L/min and remove the hair (preferably the day before surgery) on the hindlimb and back area with a depilatory cream.\nSterilize all surgical tools before surgery. Place the mouse in the induction anesthesia chamber. Use the same anesthesia settings described in Section 2.1.\nWait until the mouse is non-responsive to outside stimuli and then place it in the prone position onto the operating table with a fitted nose cone that delivers a continuous flow of isoflurane (1.5-2.0%).\nInject the recommended dose of anesthetic (Bupivacaine; 0.25% (<1 ml/kg)) at the incision site; treat the skin with a povidone-iodine solution followed by 70% ethanol. Make a 4-6 mm incision on the back (at the side of the spinal column, in the scapulae region). Separate the subcutaneous membrane with fine forceps; then turn the mouse to the supine position treat the skin with a povidone-iodine solution followed by 70% ethanol  and make 0.8-1 cm incision with micro-surgical scissors above the knee towards the medial thigh, following the path of the femoral artery.\nTunnel up the side of the torso with small sheath tubing (6-French) from the medial thigh to the incision on the back.\nPlace the mouse in the prone position. Remove the primed osmotic pump/catheter from the PBS solution and guide the catheter, through the sheath tubing, to the thigh.\nPosition the pump inside the back and close the back incision with 6-0 prolene suture (treat the skin with a povidone-iodine solution followed by 70% ethanol). Place the mouse back in the supine position; remove the sheath tubing, leaving the catheter exposed through the incision on the thigh. Secure the leg with surgical tape.",
    "Separate the subcutaneous fat tissue to reveal the vasculature. To better visualize the vasculature, use a retractor to open the incision.\nPierce the membranous femoral sheath gently by using fine-pointed forceps to access the vascular bundle. Dissect and separate the femoral artery from the femoral vein and nerve near the groin, taking care not to cause excessive bleeding.\nPlace two 8-0 prolene adjacent sutures to interrupt the femoral artery 2-3 mm proximal to the femoral bifurcation (the origin of the profunda femoris and epigastrica arteries).\nCut the catheter to the appropriate length and place the tip to the anterolateral region of the thigh, securing it with a 6-0 prolene suture to the superficial fascia to ensure targeted delivery of the substance. Close the leg incision with a 6-0 running suture. Administer a final subcutaneous injection of analgesic (Buprenorphine; 0.1 mg/kg), treat the skin with a povidone-iodine solution followed by 70% ethanol  and return the mouse to the cage. Use a heating lamp during recovery.\nAfter a 30-min recovery period, prepare the mouse for laser Doppler imaging to confirm the creation of hindlimb ischemia.\nMonitor the animal twice daily for 5 days after surgery.  Mobility of the animal will be observed to analyze pain; waste in the cage will serve as an indicator of eating.  Also, during the monitor period determine if the animal is experiencing pain or discomfort and give a subcutaneous injection of Buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) twice daily.\n3. Imaging Specimen Preparation",
    "Anesthetize the mouse as stated in Section 2.1. Transfer the mouse onto the operating table in the supine position. Inject 1,000 IU of heparin subcutaneously to prevent clotting in the vasculature. While the mouse is attached to the nosecone, make an incision large enough to expose the thoracic cavity and the lower abdomen. Move the abdominal organs to the left side of the animal to expose the infrarenal abdominal aorta (IAA). Carefully separate the aorta from the inferior cava vein.\nLigate the proximal IAA to reduce bleeding during catheter insertion. Then, make a small incision on the IAA. Insert a 27½ G blunt needle (attached to a P10 catheter) into the IAA and secure it with a 6-0 suture.\nFill two 20cc syringes with heparinized saline and 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). Fill a 5cc syringe with a contrast radiopaque silicone rubber compound. Mix the three ingredients of MV-compound: MV-diluent: MV-curing agent in working ratios of 1:1.25:0.5. Since the mixture (Microfil) only has a working time of 20 min before the agent polymerizes, it is recommended not to add the MV-curing agent until right before injection into the vasculature.\nMake a cut in the right atrium and administer an overdose of isoflurane to induce euthanasia and to allow for drainage of excess fluid. Attach the saline-filled syringe to the needle tip and begin to flush the vasculature for 5 min. Make sure all the blood is flushed out of the vessels; turn off the isoflurane and disconnect the nosecone once the flushing begins. Next, attach the formalin-filled syringe to the catheter detailed above (3.2) and pressure perfuse for an additional 5 min. Finally, perfuse the last syringe, with the contrast agent, slowly into the mouse for 5 min.",
    "Optional: Photograph the Microfil in the vasculature with a camera to ensure that only the arterial structure is perfused.\nPlace the mouse in a container filled with 10% NBF and store at 4 °C O/N for contrast agent polymerization. After 24 hr, remove the skin on the lower half of the torso (distal to the lower abdominal aorta ligation) by using dissection tools, refresh the 10% NBF, and place the mouse back into the container for 4 more days at RT.\nDissect the contralateral and ischemic hindlimbs, and place the specimens in a formic acid solution (Cal-Ex II) for 48 hr to facilitate decalcification of the bone. Then, rinse the specimens under running water for 1 hr and return to 10% NBF and proceed with Faxitron (x-ray system used to ensure the bone is decalcified) and micro-CT imaging.\nSubscription Required.
