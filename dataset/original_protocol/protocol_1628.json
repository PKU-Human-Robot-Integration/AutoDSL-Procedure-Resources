    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThis protocol provides step-by-step instructions on performing density-based fractionation of urine to prepare highly purified, multi-omics grade, urinary EV. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] highlights the 4 major steps of the protocol. Urine samples are collected (1), pre-processed (2) and stored using validated standard operating procedures. Bottom-up density gradient centrifugation of pre-processed urine separates urinary EV from other extracellular particles (3). Finally, urinary EV are recovered from density gradient fractions by SEC and concentrated to a volume suitable for downstream integrative omics profiling (4).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/119-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustrative Overview of the Urinary EV Separation Protocol\nAfter collection and preparation of the urine sample, pre-enrichment of urinary EV is performed by ultrafiltration. Urinary EV are separated and recovered from this ultrafiltrate by the orthogonal implementation of a bottom-up density gradient and size-exclusion chromatography. The EV sample is concentrated to a volume suitable for downstream EV characterization and integrative omics analysis.\nUrine Sample Collection\nTiming: 5 min\nUrine samples are collected using a validated standard operating procedure.\nCollect urine in a sterile container with a screw cap. Collect a mid-stream sample of random-catch or second morning urine (∼50 mL).\nNote: The use of second morning urine is recommended to minimize variability between donors based on diurnal patterns and to omit the use of first morning urine collected from large bladder residues.\nAlternatives: If urine enriched in prostate-derived secretions is required, collect a first-catch urine sample (∼50 mL) immediately following digital rectal examination (DRE). DRE is performed by applying pressure on the prostate, depressing the surface ∼1 cm, from the base to the apex and from the lateral to the median line for each prostate lobe. Perform 3 finger strokes per lobe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) (Groskopf et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/119-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Standard Operating Procedure to Collect Urine Enriched in Prostatic Secretions\nA first-catch urine sample is collected immediately following standardized digital rectal examination.\nCritical: Experiments using human biological specimens must conform to local and national regulations, and in accordance to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent must be obtained from urine sample donors. Strict compliance with Biosafety Level 2 practices, containment equipment, and facilities are recommended when handling human body fluids (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Centers for Disease Control; National Institutes of Health, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nPerform test strip urinalysis to determine pathological changes in the collected urine sample.\nNote: Bacterial contamination, urinary tract infection, hematuria and proteinuria may affect downstream analysis of urinary EV.\nAlternatives: Urinalysis can also be performed using an automated urine chemistry analyzer.\nIf immediate sample preparation after collection cannot be achieved, refrigerate the urine sample at 4°C.\nCritical: Correct preservation of urine samples before sample preparation is essential to prevent microbial overgrowth, which can interfere with downstream urinary EV separation and characterization.\nCritical: Do not freeze urine samples prior to sample preparation. This leads to cell lysis and release of cell organelles into the sample.\nNote: There is no consensus regarding short-term storage stability of urinary EV. Therefore, we recommend Urine Sample Preparation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] within the same day, no later than 4 h after sample collection (Yamamoto, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). The addition of protease inhibitors is not recommended, since urinary EV are largely resistant to the endogenous proteolytic activity of urine (Mitchell et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nUrine Sample Preparation\nTiming: 15 min\nUrine samples are pre-processed and stored using validated standard operating procedures.\nTransfer the urine sample to a sterile 50 mL conical centrifugation tube.",
    "Place the centrifugation tube into a pre-cooled benchtop centrifuge with swinging bucket rotor and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Counterbalance when needed.\nCollect the supernatant, using an electronic pipettor and serological pipette, and transfer it to a new sterile 50 mL conical centrifugation tube. Discard the pellet.\nCritical: Avoid transferring or disturbing the pellet, which contains cells and cell debris, bacteria and urinary crystal precipitates.\nPause Point: Cell-free urine samples can be used immediately or stored at −80°C for up to 1 year.\nNote: When collecting and storing urine samples in a biorepository, report all pre-analytical and patient-related details according to the Biospecimen Reporting for Improved Study Quality (BRISQ) recommendations to better evaluate, interpret, compare, and reproduce experimental results obtained with these samples (Moore et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nUrinary EV Separation\nTiming: 21 h\nUrinary EV are separated from other extracellular particles using bottom-up density gradient centrifugation.\nWhen working with frozen urine samples that were stored in a biorepository, continue with step 7. When working with fresh urine samples, jump to step 8.\nOptional: To calculate recovery efficiencies and allow the normalization of quantitative results between protocol runs, spike a control urine sample with a known amount of GFP-positive recombinant EV (rEV). These rEV can be tracked during separation from urine using fluorescence-, protein- or RNA based methods. For detailed instructions on the generation and use of rEV, we refer to (Geeurickx et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nThaw the 50 mL urine sample at 20°C–25°C. After thawing, vortex the sample for 1 min.",
    "Critical: Urinary crystalline salts, such as calcium oxalate and amorphous phosphate or urate crystals, precipitate at low storage temperatures. Crystal precipitation is observed as an increased turbidity of the sample (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). These precipitates interfere with downstream EV separation. Therefore, urine samples containing crystal precipitates after thawing require additional centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, as described in steps 5–6 of the protocol. The pellet will be pink in appearance (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Alternatively, precipitates can be resolubilized by a 5 min temperature equilibration in a 37°C water bath or by correction of the urinary pH to 8.0 by addition of a 1 M Tris buffer (Yamamoto, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/119-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Removal of Urinary Crystalline Salts\n(A) Fresh urine sample (left) versus thawed urine sample containing crystal precipitates (right).\n(B) Crystal precipitates are removed by centrifugation. The pellet (arrow) is pink in appearance.\nNote: Limit the amount of freeze-thaw cycles to one. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, since this might negatively impact EV recovery from urine (Yuana et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]).\nTransfer the urine sample, using an electronic pipettor and serological pipette, into the sample filter cup of an assembled 10-kDa Millipore Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filter unit (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/119-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Preparation of a Concentrated Urine Sample\n(A) The cell-free urine sample is transferred into the sample filter cup of a centrifugal filter device (step 8).\n(B) The sample is concentrated to a target volume of 800 μL, corresponding to ~1 cm of remaining sample in the filter core (step 9).\n(C) The concentrated urine sample is recovered in the concentrate collection cup of the centrifugal filter device (steps 10–11).",
    "Note: The choice of centrifugal filter device for ultrafiltration is crucial and impacts the EV recovery efficiency of the protocol. Ultrafiltration devices equipped with a regenerated cellulose membrane and a 10 kDa pore size recover EV the most efficiently (Vergauwen et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nPlace the filter unit into a pre-cooled benchtop centrifuge with swinging bucket rotor and centrifuge at 3,000 × g for minimally 20 min at 4°C until the sample is concentrated to at least 800 μL. Counterbalance with a similar device when needed.\nCritical: Differences in concentration of urinary solutes due to donor fluid intake and renal function, cause variability in centrifugation times between samples to obtain the required sample volume. Overconcentration of the urine sample will negatively impact EV recovery. Therefore, regular visual assessment of the concentrate at several time points (e.g. 20, 25, 30 min, etc.) is critical. The target volume of 800 μL corresponds to approximately 1 cm of remaining sample in the filter core (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). See Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] in the Troubleshooting section.\nConnect a concentrate collection cup to the sample filter cup, invert the device and place it in the benchtop centrifuge. Counterbalance with a similar device when needed. Spin the concentrate down at 1,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nRemove the concentrate cup containing the concentrated urine sample from the sample filter cup. Collect the sample with a pipette and, if necessary, correct the volume to 800 μL with pre-cooled (4°C) Density Gradient Buffer 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]. Transfer to a 5 mL Eppendorf tube and place on ice.",
    "Critical: The concentrated urine sample will form the basis for the preparation of a 40% (w/v) iodixanol sample suspension in step 14 of the protocol. It is critical that the volume of this sample is exactly 800 μL in order to prepare the suspension correctly.\nPrepare the iodixanol working solution (50% w/v) by mixing 1 volume of Density Gradient Buffer 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1] with 5 volumes of OptiPrep in a 50 mL conical tube according to the following table. Keep the working solution cooled on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_119_4.csv\nNote: Fresh working solution should be prepared for each experiment. Protect Optiprep from prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, since this leads to release of iodine from the iodixanol molecule.\nPrepare 5%, 10% and 20% (w/v) iodixanol solutions by mixing appropriate volumes of working solution (50% w/v) and Density Gradient Buffer 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1] in 50 mL conical tubes according to the following table. Turn the tubes gently up and down until homogeneous solutions have been obtained. Keep the solutions cooled on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_119_5.csv\nNote: Fresh solutions should be prepared for each experiment.\nPrepare a 40% (w/v) iodixanol sample suspension by adding 3.2 mL of iodixanol working solution (50% w/v) to the concentrated urine sample (800 μL), prepared in step 11 of the protocol. Homogenize the mixture by gently pipetting up and down.\nCritical: Gentle pipetting to homogenize the 40% (w/v) iodixanol sample suspension is a prerequisite to avoid the introduction of air bubbles, which may disturb the density layers of the gradient (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/119-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Preparation of a 40% Iodixanol Sample Suspension\n(A) The suspension is homogenized by gently mixing the concentrated urine sample and the appropriate volume of iodixanol working solution (step 14).\n(B) Imprudent homogenization of the suspension generates air bubbles and should be avoided.",
    "Prepare a discontinuous density gradient in a clean 17 mL Thinwall polypropylene tube by layering iodixanol solutions with successively lower densities on top of each other.\nTiming: 10–20 min per density gradient\nHold the tube upright and gently dispense the 4 mL of 40% (w/v) iodixanol sample suspension, prepared in step 15 of the protocol, to the bottom of the tube.\nCarefully tilt the tube to 70°. Gently dispense 4 mL of the 20% (w/v) iodixanol solution to the surface of the liquid close to the opening of the tube. Keep the pipette tip close to the wall of the tube.\nNote: transferring the solution dropwise using a P1000 pipette (4 × 1,000 μL) provides a slow and smooth flow of liquid.\nGently dispense 4 mL of the 10% (w/v) iodixanol solution to the surface of the liquid close to the opening of the tube. Keep the pipette tip close to the wall of the tube.\nNote: transferring the solution dropwise using a P1000 pipette (4 × 1,000 μL) provides a slow and smooth flow of liquid.\nGently dispense 3.5 mL of the 5% (w/v) iodixanol solution to the surface of the liquid close to the opening of the tube. Keep the pipette tip close to the wall of the tube.\nNote: transferring the solution dropwise using a P1000 pipette (4 × 875 μL) provides a slow and smooth flow of liquid.\nGently dispense 1.0 mL of PBS to the surface of the liquid close to the opening of the tube. Keep the pipette tip close to the wall of the tube.\nPlace the density gradient upright in a tube rack on ice or in a pre-cooled (−20°C) aluminum cooling block.",
    "Critical: Keep the work area free from vibrations and disturbances. Dispense the iodixanol solutions carefully to avoid mixing and ensure the formation of distinct layers with a sharp interface (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Do not repeatedly shift between holding the tube tilted and upright, since this negatively affects gradient layering (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). See Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] in the Troubleshooting section.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/119-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Successful Preparation of a Discontinuous Bottom-Up Density Gradient\nThe iodixanol solutions form distinct layers (arrows) with a sharp interface (step 15).\nAlternatives: Robot-assisted layering of discontinuous density gradients eliminates user variability, is less time-consuming, and contributes to consistent and reproducible density-based EV separation from urine. In case an automated liquid handler with liquid level sensing (e.g. Biomek 4000 Workstation) is available to the researcher, we recommend robot-assisted preparation of density gradients. For detailed instructions on automated gradient layering, we refer to (Tulkens et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nPlace the SW 32.1 Ti rotor into the ultracentrifuge.\nGently place the density gradient(s), prepared in step 16, into the rotor bucket.\nGently place the rotor buckets into the rotor. Counterbalance when needed.\nProgram the ultracentrifuge run using the following settings:\nRotor type: SW 32.1 Ti Rotor\nType of centrifugation tube: 17 mL Thinwall\nSpeed: 100,000 × g\nTime: 18 h\nTemperature: 4°C\nAcceleration: 0 (MAX)\nDeceleration: 9\nStart the ultracentrifuge.\nPause Point: Plan the ultracentrifuge run as an overnight run and continue the protocol the next day.\nAfter completion of the ultracentrifuge run, carefully transfer the rotor buckets into a rack.\nTake the fractionated density gradient out of the bucket and collect the fractions from top to bottom.\nTiming: 10–15 min per density gradient",
    "Hold the tube upright. Gently place the pipette tip on the center of the fluid meniscus of the density gradient and carefully collect individual 1 mL fractions from the top of the gradient.\nCritical: Collection of density gradient fractions is technically challenging and prone to error. Hold the centrifugation tube between your thumb and index finger to ensure the tube stays upright during the entire process. Use a P1000 pipette with smooth and precise aspiration control (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. Preparation of a Discontinuous Bottom-Up Density Gradient\nIn step 15, a discontinuous density gradient is prepared in a 17 mL Thinwall polypropylene tube by layering iodixanol solutions with successively lower densities on top of each other. The iodixanol solutions are dispensed carefully to avoid mixing and ensure the formation of distinct layers with a sharp interface.\nTransfer the collected density gradient fractions to sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and keep them cooled on ice.\nAlternatives: As outlined in step 15, robot-assisted collection of density gradient fractions has several advantages over manual collection, contributing to standardization and reproducibility of the protocol by eliminating user variability. In case an automated liquid handler with liquid level sensing (e.g. Biomek 4000 Workstation) is available to the researcher, we highly recommend robot-assisted collection of density gradient fractions. For detailed instructions on automated gradient fractionation, we refer to (Tulkens et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nOptional: Determine the final density of the fractions collected from a blank control gradient using a multi-well plate reader.\nTransfer 200 μL of density gradient buffer 2 in the well of a 96-well microplate to use as a blank",
    "Transfer 100 μL of 5%, 10%, 20% and 40% iodixanol solutions into 100 μL of diH2O in the wells of a 96-well microplate to make 1:1 aqueous dilutions\nTransfer 100 μL of each of the fractions into 100 μL of diH2O in the wells of a 96-well plate microplate to make 1:1 aqueous dilutions\nPlace the 96-well plate in a multi-well plate reader and measure the absorbance values at 340 nm of the solutions in each well\nCalculate the density of the gradient fractions using a standard curve of the absorbance values of the aqueous dilutions of 5, 10, 20 and 40% iodixanol solutions. Corresponding densities of the iodixanol solutions (in 0.25 M sucrose) are provided in the table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_119_6.csv\nNote: For iodixanol concentrations above 35% (w/v), it may be necessary to make a second 1:1 aqueous dilution to avoid absorbance values above 1.2.\nPool density gradient fractions 9–10, enriched in urinary EV, and continue with urinary EV recovery.\nOptional: Other density gradient fractions can be collected and processed in function of the intended research objective. Soluble urinary proteins are enriched in high-density fractions 14–16 (Dhondt et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S2. Fractionation of a Density Gradient\nIn step 22a, density gradient fractions are collected from the top of the gradient. The tube is held upright. The pipette tip is gently placed on the center of the fluid meniscus and individual 1 mL fractions are carefully collected.\nUrinary EV Recovery\nTiming: 30 min per sample\nEV are recovered from density gradient fractions using size-exclusion chromatography.",
    "Note: Several methods can be used for urinary EV recovery from density gradient fractions (e.g. SEC and ultracentrifugation). However, complete separation of the iodixanol matrix from EV can only be guaranteed using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Vergauwen et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). Since iodixanol remnants in urinary EV preparations interfere with downstream mass spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA sequencing, complete removal is desirable. In addition, the efficiency of EV recovery from density gradient fractions by SEC is higher compared to that of EV recovery by ultracentrifugation. Therefore, if the final goal of urinary EV separation is performing integrative omics profiling, SEC should be used in order to obtain maximal EV purity and yield, qualitative tandem mass spectra for mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and optimal sequencing quality and depth for RNA sequencing.\nSize-exclusion Chromatography\nClamp the SEC column to a laboratory stand (See Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for instructions on how to prepare SEC columns). Check if the column did not dry out and remove the closing cone (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/119-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Size-Exclusion Chromatography Quality Assurance\nPrior to or during SEC, the column should be prevented from drying out (step 24).\nRinse the column with 2mL of pre-cooled PBS (4°C). Collect the eluate in a translucent vial and confirm the column does not leak Sepharose resin. See Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] in the Troubleshooting section.\nLoad pooled density fractions 9–10 (2 mL), collected in steps 22–23 of the protocol, onto the column as soon as the PBS buffer has completely disappeared into the resin.\nCritical: When loading PBS or sample onto the column, ensure not to disturb the Sepharose resin in the column. Load dropwise and close to the surface of the resin. Ensure a slow and smooth flow of liquid. Make sure the SEC column does not dry out (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).",
    "Immediately following sample loading onto the SEC column, start collecting individual fractions of 1 mL. SEC fractions 1–3 are void volume, while EV elute in SEC fractions 4–7. When the loaded sample has completely disappeared into the resin, load PBS buffer onto to column as long as it takes to collect the SEC fractions of interest and to prevent the column from drying out.\nNote: Collect the first 3 mL of eluate (SEC fractions 1–3) in a 5 mL Eppendorf tube and collect the next 4 mL of eluate (SEC fractions 4–7 containing EV) in a separate 5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nTransfer SEC fractions 4–7 into a 10-kDa centrifugal filter unit.\nNote: The choice of centrifugal filter device for ultrafiltration is crucial and impacts the EV recovery efficiency of the protocol. Ultrafiltration devices equipped with a regenerated cellulose membrane and a 10 kDa pore size recover EV the most efficiently (Vergauwen et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nPlace the filter unit into a pre-cooled benchtop centrifuge with swinging bucket rotor and centrifuge at 3,000 × g at 4° C until the sample is concentrated to 100 μL (10–30 min). Counterbalance with a similar device when needed.\nCollect the concentrated urinary EV sample by a reverse spin at 1,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Transfer to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and place on ice.\nPause Point: Urinary EV can be characterized immediately or stored at −80°C for several months.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S3. EV Recovery by Size-Exclusion Chromatography\nIn step 24c, EV-enriched density gradient fractions are loaded on top of a SEC column. Sample or PBS are loaded dropwise and close to the surface of the resin. Immediately following sample loading onto the SEC column, individual fractions of 1 mL are collected.",
    "Urinary EV Preparation for Integrative Omics Profiling\nUrinary EV samples are prepared for integrative omics profiling.\nNote: we provide different procedures for urinary EV preparation for integrative omics profiling. However, a detailed step-by-step description of these methods is outside the scope of this protocol. The approach to downstream sample processing is at the discretion of the researcher.\nPrepare urinary EV samples for mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis (a) and/or RNA sequencing (b). A 100 μL urinary EV suspension is sufficient for both downstream applications.\nPerform protein extraction and tryptic digestion of the urinary EV sample for mass spectrometry-based proteomics by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) (Dhondt et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Wiśniewski et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). Desalt the peptides and proceed to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\nPerform RNA extraction of the urinary EV sample for RNA sequencing by spin column-based purification of total RNA (eg. miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit – Qiagen – Cat# 217184). We recommend the use of Sequin (Hardwick et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) and ERCC (ThermoFisher – Cat# 4456740) RNA spikes to control for variation in RNA isolation and RNA expression data, respectively. Proceed to library preparation and RNA sequencing."
