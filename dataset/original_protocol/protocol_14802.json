    "1. Generation of Reproducibly Sized Tumor Spheroids\nWash tumor cell monolayers with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 5 ml for a 25 cm2 or 8 - 10 ml for a 75 cm2 flask), add cell dissociation enzyme (1 ml for a 25 cm2 or 2 ml for a 75 cm2 flask) and incubate cells at 37 °C for 2 - 5 min.\nCheck cell detachment under a microscope and neutralize cell dissociation enzyme with complete growth medium (5 ml for a 25 cm2 or 8 ml for a 75 cm2 flask).\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 500 x g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant, tap the tube and re-suspend cell pellet in 1 ml of complete growth medium using a P1000 pipette. This should yield a single cell suspension without cell clusters.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and dilute the cell suspension to obtain 0.5 - 2 x 104 cells/ml (optimal cell density needs to be determined for each cell line in order to obtain tumor spheroids of 300 - 500 µm diameter 4 days after cell seeding12,13).\nTransfer the cell suspension to a sterile reservoir and, using a multichannel pipette, dispense 200 µl/well into ultra-low attachment (ULA) 96-well round bottom plates12.\nTransfer the plates to an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity). Four days later, visually confirm tumor spheroid formation and proceed with the 3D invasion assay.\n2. 3D Tumor Spheroid Invasion Assay\nThaw BMM on ice.\nKeep a set of sterile filter tips for P10, P200 and P1000 pipettes and sterile tubes (1.5 ml volume or larger depending on total volume required) at -20 °C.\nPlace the ULA 96-well plates containing 4-day old spheroids on ice.",
    "Using a multichannel pipette, gently remove 100 µl/well of growth medium from the spheroid plates. For this step angle the tips towards the inside wall of the U-bottom wells, avoiding contact with the bottom of the well and the location of the spheroids; minimize disturbance of the spheroids.\nUsing ice-cold tips, transfer BMM to ice-cold tubes. For cytokine-induced invasion or for drug evaluation studies, add reagents (at 2x the final concentration) to the BMM using ice-cold tips. For example, use epidermal growth factor (EGF) to stimulate the invasion of CALS and CALR squamous carcinoma cells. Mix well by swirling gently, avoiding the formation of bubbles.\nGently dispense 100 µl of BMM into the U-bottom well, aiming the tip towards the inside wall of the well. This step is the most critical as, for optimal image analysis, spheroids must remain in the center of the well12.\nRepeat step 2.6 for all the required wells, allowing 5 - 6 replicates/condition. If necessary, change to a freshly-chilled tip.\n\tNOTE: When more experienced, dispense BMM using a multichannel pipette.\nUsing a sterile needle, remove bubbles, if present.\n\t\nUsing a microscope, visually check that spheroids are in a central position. If not, centrifuge the plate at 300 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. This will ensure that spheroids are centrally located in each well.\nTransfer the plate to an incubator at 37 °C and allow the BMM to solidify.\n1 hr later, using a multichannel pipette, gently add 100 µl/well of complete growth medium. For cytokine-induced invasion or drug evaluation studies, include cytokines or inhibitors in the medium (1x final concentration). Alternatively, if reagents were not added to the BMM in step 2.5, add them to the medium at this point (3x the desired final concentration).\n3. Automated Image Acquisition",
    "Scan plates on the cytometer (for specifications see Table of Equipment and Materials) at intervals starting from time zero (t0 = day of the invasion assay set up, immediately after step 2.10 up to 72 hr, or 96 hr for slower invading tumor cell lines.\nSelect the ‘Confluence’ application.\nCheck that the spheroid is in focus and, if needed, adjust manually and fix the ‘Focus off-set’.\nUnder ‘Sampling settings’, select to scan one central field of view (FOV). Following BMM addition, tumor spheroids should have remained in a central position, thus there is no need to scan the entire well.\nIn the software, define the wells to be scanned by highlighting them on the plate map. Click on ‘Start scan’.\n\tNOTE: The scan is automatically saved and can be reviewed later off-line.\n4. Automated Image Analysis\nSelect ‘Confluence’ application.\nIn the ‘Analysis’ tab, adjust application settings (e.g., “precision”: low, normal, high; “intensity threshold”: 1 - 15) to produce a precise segmentation around the spheroid, including cell processes and invadopodia extending into the BMM (see Figure 1). Adjust the settings for each tumor cell line and/or at various time points. The ‘Confluence’ application measures the % of the well area covered by the invading cells, in the selected FOV.\nCheck that the analysis settings are appropriate (i.e., segmentation is accurate) for other spheroids in the plate by clicking on a few different wells. If the segmentation does not accurately outline a spheroid, adjust the application settings further.\nClick on ‘Start analysis’.\nOn the ‘Results’ tab, check multiple wells to verify analysis quality. Export ‘Well level data’ to a spreadsheet program.",
    "Repeat analysis for all the time points. Calculate the mean % confluence for replicate wells and plot invasion (% confluence) against time in a bar chart, using scientific graphing and statistical software of choice.\n5. Manual Image Acquisition\nRecord an image for each tumor spheroid at intervals starting from t = 0 up to 72 - 96 hr, depending on the speed of invasion of the cell line in question, using an inverted microscope (for a 96-well plate this takes approximately 20 - 30 min). Use a 10X objective. Use a 4X objective when an invaded area is too large to be completely captured within the 10X field of view.\nSave each individual image acquired.\nFor calibration, take images of a stage graticule (1 mm) using both 10X and 4X objectives (and save images).\n6. Manual Image Analysis\nOpen the stage graticule images into the image analysis software of choice.\nEnter the graticule measurements, the units (µm), the objectives used (10X or 4X) and perform the calibration. This step is required only once. For subsequent image analysis, simply reload the required calibration settings.\nOpen the invasion assay images and select the calibration settings depending on the microscope objective (10X or 4X) used to obtain the images.\n\t\nAlternatively, import images obtained on an imaging cytometer (step 3) and analyze manually, as described for images obtained using an inverted microscope (see results shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4).\nMeasure the area covered by the spheroids.\n\t\nIn the software used here for the Representative Results (for specifications see Table of Equipment and Materials), go to ‘Measure’ and select ‘Count/size’. Chose ‘File’ then ‘Load settings’ and select pre-determined assay settings. Then choose ‘Count’. The spheroid should then be accurately segmented.",
    "Alternatively go to ‘Edit’ then ‘Draw/Merge Objects’ to open the ‘Magic Wand/Trace’ window. Use the wand cursor to click on the spheroid image and obtain segmentation. Select ‘Trace’ (in the ‘Magic Wand’ window) to manually outline the spheroid using a mouse.\nExport measurements of different parameters (area, diameter, perimeter etc.) to a spreadsheet. Record on the spreadsheet the relevant image information (e.g., well number, relative time point).\nPlot the mean area of replicate spheroids (invasion) versus time using scientific graphing and statistical software. Alternatively, calculate the change in spheroid area at each time point, relative to the area at t = 0. Then plot invasion (% t0) versus time as a linear graph."
