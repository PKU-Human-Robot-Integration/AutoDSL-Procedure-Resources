    "Note: All procedures are performed twice (using blood from two different donors) for three samples of each surface in the hood. Biomaterial sterilizationPlace biomaterial surfaces in each well of a 24-well plate. Prepare one plate for each time point (15, 30 and 45 min) and label them on the lid with the corresponding time point.Add 500 μl of ethanol for 5 min at room temperature.Aspirate the ethanol and rinse the biomaterial surfaces three times with 500 μl of PBS.Aspirate the PBS and rinse the biomaterial surfaces once with 500 μl of DI water.Aspirate the DI water and let the biomaterial surfaces dry for at least 30 min.Adding blood to the biomaterial surfaceDraw human whole blood in a vacuum tube with no anticoagulant.Immediately after the blood draw, carefully open the vacuum tube and pipette 7 μl of blood out of the tube and put onto each biomaterial surface (Figure 1).Close the lid and start counting the timer for each plate (15, 30 and 45 min).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119062224_1073.jpgFigure 1. Whole blood on biomaterial surfaces. 7 μl of blood are placed onto each surface and allowed to clot for 15, 30 and 45 min. Group A and B are different biomaterial surfaces being studied.Preparing the positive control (maximum hemoglobin release)Prepare a new 24-well plate with 500 μl of DI water in 3 wells.Add 7 μl of blood to each well with DI water (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119062253_0994.jpgFigure 2. Positive Control. A. the maximum hemoglobin release is obtained adding 7 μl of blood in 500 μl of DI water. B. 200 μl of each solution is transferred to a 96-well plate to read the absorbance.Place the plate on a horizontal shaker for 30 s (100 rpm).Move the plate to a bench and wait for 5 min to release the free hemoglobin.",
    "After 5 min, pipette 200 μl of the solution to a 96-well plate (Figure 2B).Read the absorbance using a microplate reader at a wavelength of 540 nm.Transferring samples to release hemoglobinPrepare a new 24-well plate with 500 μl of DI water in each well.After 15 min, gently transfer the biomaterial surfaces from the first plate to a new well with DI water. Be careful while moving the biomaterial surfaces to not disturb the blood on the surface. The samples should under water after this step. If your samples are thicker, use more water in order to cover the whole with the blood.Place the plate on a horizontal shaker for 30 s (100 rpm).Move the plate to a bench and wait for 5 min to release the free hemoglobin (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119062335_3900.jpgFigure 3. Different biomaterial surfaces, A and B, in DI water to release the free hemoglobin. The lysis of red blood cells occurs due to pressure change and hemoglobin is released in DI water.Reading the absorbanceAfter 5 min, pipette 200 μl of the “water + hemoglobin released” solution to a 96-well plate. Change the pipette tip for each solution (Figure 4).Read the absorbance using a microplate reader at a wavelength of 540 nm.Repeat Procedures C and D after 30 and 45 min for the second and third plates, respectively.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119062427_3197.jpgFigure 4. Solutions from different biomaterial surfaces, A and B (water + hemoglobin released). 200 μl of each solution in Figure 3 is transferred to a 96-well plate to read the absorbance."
