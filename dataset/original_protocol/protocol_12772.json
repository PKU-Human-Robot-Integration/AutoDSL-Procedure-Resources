    "NOTE: Ensure that any risk assessments applicable to the bacterial strains are adhered to when culturing and handling samples. Be aware that setting up too many gradients at one time can lead to musculoskeletal disorders due to the pressure on joints from the slow pipetting involved. Plan work and take precautions to avoid injury.\n1. Preparation of Bacterial Strains or Mutant Libraries\nStreak out the strains to be tested on appropriate agar plates. These are stock plates for the experiment.\nIncubate the plates overnight at the desired temperature to achieve single colonies. For this experiment, culture K. pneumoniae (NTUH-K2044 and ATCC43816 strains) on Luria broth (LB) agar at 37 °C, and S. pneumoniae (23F wild type and 23F Δcps) on blood agar in a humidified candle jar at 37 °C.\nPick a single colony from a stock plate (step 1.1) to inoculate 10 mL of appropriate broth using a sterile loop or cocktail stick. For screening of random mutant libraries, inoculate the broth with 10 µL of the random mutant library stock (TraDIS Library).\nIncubate K. pneumoniae strains in low salt LB media at 37 °C with shaking, and S. pneumoniae strains in brain heart infusion (BHI) media, statically at 37 °C.\nTransfer the overnight culture to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge in a bench-top centrifuge for 10 min at 3,200 x g in swing out buckets with 15 mL tube inserts and aerosol tight lids.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).",
    "NOTE: Dispose of supernatant via the appropriate liquid biological waste route in the laboratory. The purpose of the centrifugation and resuspension steps (1.2.2 and 1.2.3) is to concentrate the bacteria for easy visualization on the gradient. Bacterial cultures can be loaded directly onto the gradient if preferred. Heavily capsulated strains may not form a tight pellet. If this occurs, remove as much supernatant as possible without removing any bacterial cells, add 1x PBS to a final volume of 5 mL and resuspend the pellet. Continue the protocol with step 1.2.5.\nFor non-mucoid strains, go to step 2.\nCentrifuge the tubes as described in step 1.2.2.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of 1x PBS. Cells are now ready to use.\nNOTE: The density of the bacterial cell suspension is not critical but needs to be sufficient for visualization in the gradient. A minimum OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) of 4 is suggested.\n2. Preparation of Gradient Dilutions and Mini-gradient Test\nPrepare gradient dilutions.\nNOTE: Exact concentrations of density gradient medium (e.g., Percoll) needed in the density gradients to achieve good separation will differ depending on the bacterial strain and growth conditions used. Mini-gradient tests are performed first, to identify the concentrations that will give the best separation. These comprise 500 µL of a single dilution in a 2 mL tube. If bacteria will be extracted from the gradient and subcultured for downstream applications, these steps should be performed under aseptic conditions.\n\t\nCombine density gradient medium with 1x PBS to make the density gradient dilutions. Make dilutions of 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% (e.g., 2 mL of density gradient medium plus 8 mL of 1x PBS = 10 mL of 20% density gradient medium).",
    "Aliquot 500 µL of the 20% gradient dilution into a 2 mL tube for each strain to be tested (e.g., 4 strains = 4 tubes containing 500 µL of 20% gradient dilution).\nRepeat step 2.1.2 for the rest of the gradient dilutions.\nApply bacteria to the gradient.\nApply 100 µL of bacterial cells prepared in steps 1.2.3 and 1.2.6 to the top of each gradient dilution following the steps below.\n\t\t\nTake up 100 µL of cells using a 200 µL pipette and place the pipette tip on the side of the tube just below the meniscus of the mini-gradient.\nAspirate the bacterial cells onto the gradient extremely slowly so that they form a layer on the top of the gradient, without any mixing of the interface.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1.1–2.2.1.2 for all strains to be tested.\nUsing a fixed angle rotor with an aerosol tight lid, centrifuge the prepared tubes in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 8,000 x g.\nAfter centrifugation, transfer the tubes to a rack to visualize the minimum gradient dilution required to retain cells just above the gradient layer following centrifugation.\nIf the results are not clear, repeat the mini-gradient test with increments of 5% density gradient medium dilutions above and below the concentrations defined in step 2.1.1 (e.g., 25% and 35% dilutions should be tested if the result at 30% is ambiguous).\nNOTE: See Figure 2A for typical results at a single density gradient medium dilution.\nUse the results from steps 2.2.3–2.2.4 to determine the ideal gradient dilutions to use to separate cells in larger-scale discontinuous gradients.\n3. Preparation of Cells for the Main Experiment\nPrepare fresh overnight cultures by inoculating 10 mL of appropriate broth as described in step 1.2.\nIncubate the cultures overnight in appropriate conditions as described in step 1.2.1.",
    "Pellet the overnight culture as described in step 1.2.2.\nWash the cells as described in step 1.2.3.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 1x PBS. If the strain is mucoid and does not pellet easily, resuspend the pellet in up to 2 mL of PBS or residual media. Cells are now ready to use.\n4. Preparation of Discontinuous Density Gradients\nNOTE: An alternative method of gradient preparation from bottom (most concentrated) to top (least concentrated) using a pipette is described in step 7.\nPipette 1 mL of the most dilute density gradient dilution into a 5 mL polypropylene round bottom tube to form the top, most dilute, layer of the gradient.\n\tNOTE: Subsequent layers of more concentrated gradient dilutions will be added below this layer using a needle, so as not to disrupt the layers. A minimum of two and maximum of three gradient layers of 1 mL each are recommended for robust separation and easy visualization of bacteria.\n\t\nUsing a 1 mL disposable syringe with a 1.5 inch needle attached, take 1 mL of the next most concentrated density gradient medium dilution into the syringe. Avoid taking up any air, as bubbles can disrupt the gradient layers.\nPlace the needle end at the bottom of the tube containing the first layer. Aspirate the syringe contents very slowly to avoid mixing the interface.\nNOTE: The interface of the two dilutions will rise as the more concentrated gradient dilution is added. Observe the interface by holding it up to light or an outside window. If no distinct interface is observed, discard the gradient and start again.",
    "Remove the needle from the gradient very gently so as not to disturb the interface between the different gradient dilutions. Place the tube in a suitable rack to keep it upright.\nIf using three different dilutions, repeat steps 4.1.1–4.1.2.1 so that the densest dilution is at the bottom. If the gradient has been constructed successfully, there will be three distinct layers with no mixing at the interfaces.\n5. Adding Prepared Cells to Gradients and Separation by Centrifugation\nAdd 600 µL of prepared cells from step 3.3 to the top of the gradient in the tube very slowly and without mixing the interface, as described in step 2.2.\nPlace the tubes in tube adapters and weigh the combined adapters and tubes to ensure they are balanced.\nPlace the tube adapters in a fixed angle rotor within a bench-top centrifuge. Centrifuge for 30 min at 3,000 x g.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully remove the tubes, place them in a suitable rack, and photograph the results as a record.\nRecover the bacterial fractions for uronic acid quantification or DNA extraction by following step 6.\nIf downstream applications are not required, dispose of the samples/gradients via the appropriate liquid biological waste route in the laboratory.\nNOTE: It is important to validate the separation for new species/strains of bacteria. Individual fractions from the gradient should be examined by microscopy, by uronic acid assay (step 8), or another suitable quantitative assay to confirm the capsule phenotype of each fraction. If the aim is to separate based on aggregation or cell size, independent appropriate assays should be used.\n6. Recovering Sample Fractions and Optional Outgrowth Step\nRecover the fractions from a gradient by removing and discarding any liquid from the top dilution if no bacterial fraction is present within that layer.",
    "To remove the top fraction, use a P200 pipette and gently pass the pipette tip through the gradient to the fraction, and take up the fraction. Place the fraction into a 1.5 mL tube and label appropriately.\nTo recover further fractions, still using the P200 pipette, insert the tip gently through the gradient to the fraction and recover the fraction to a fresh 1.5 mL tube. Remove excess gradient as the fractions lower down the gradient are accessed.\nIf DNA extraction from a fraction containing very low cell numbers is required (e.g., for density-TraDISort), subculture the fraction by following the protocol from step 6.2 for optional outgrowth to obtain more cells.\nNOTE: There will be a low level of carryover from cells at the top of the gradient into lower fractions, as fractions are removed from top to bottom. Minimize this by working carefully so as not to mix the gradient, by using a needle to remove lower fractions, and by performing re-purification of very low abundance samples where carryover may affect results.\nTransfer cells from the low-abundance fraction recovered in steps 6.1.1–6.1.2 into 5 mL of appropriate liquid media. Place in an incubator and grow for 2 h at 37 °C.\nAfter 2 h of growth or when the sample has reached an OD600 of 1, transfer the culture to a 15 mL tube. Centrifuge the tube for 10 min at 3,200 x g in a centrifuge with swing out buckets and aerosol tight lids. Discard the supernatant\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 1x PBS.",
    "Prepare a fresh single-concentration density gradient in a 5 mL polypropylene tube. Use the gradient concentration from just above the location of the fraction in the original gradient (e.g., for purification of the ΔslyA mutant shown in Figure 2D, 15% density gradient medium would be used).\n\tNOTE: This re-purification step is optional.\n\t\nApply the cells to the top of the gradient and centrifuge as described in steps 2.2 and 5.1.\nRemove the tubes from the centrifuge and place in an appropriate rack. Photograph the gradient and recover the fraction for DNA extraction as described in 6.1–6.1.2.\nNOTE: The sample is now ready for DNA extraction or other downstream applications.\n7. Alternative Method for Gradient Preparation from Bottom (Most Concentrated) to Top (Least Concentrated) Using a Pipette\nUse the gradient dilutions determined in step 2.2.3. Using a 1,000 µL pipette, add 1 mL of the densest gradient dilution to a 5 mL tube.\nUsing a 200 µL pipette, add 200 µL of the next dense gradient dilution very slowly to the top of the layer in the tube, so as not to mix the interface. Add another 200 µL and then the final 600 µL. Adding multiple smaller volumes gives more control over pipetting speed and prevents mixing of the interface. If the interface mixes, discard and start again.\nRepeat step 7.1.1 with the third, least dense gradient concentration if three dilutions are being used. The tube should now have gradients of either 2 mL or 3 mL depending on the results from step 2.2.3.\nGo to step 5 of the protocol to add cells and continue the experiment.\n8. Measurement of Capsule Amount by Uronic Acid Assay\nAdjust the OD600 of each recovered fraction to 4.0 by dilution with PBS. Proceed with quantification of uronic acids as previously published1."
