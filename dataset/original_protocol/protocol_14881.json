    "1. Making the Viral Vectors\nThe coding sequences for the gene of interest, as well as the positive and negative controls, are inserted into pBABEpuro by traditional cloning methods (PCR amplification, restriction digestion and ligation). There are four restriction sites on the vector where the DNA can be inserted: BamHI, SnaBI, EcoRI and SalI.\nPrepare transfection-grade plasmid DNA from competent cells using the QIAGEN plasmid midi kit.\nMeasure DNA concentration using a NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer.\n2. Retrovirus Production\nThe Plat-E packaging cell line will be used to produce ecotropic retrovirus that will deliver the cDNA of interest to NIH 3T3 cells.\nEstablishing Plat-E Cultures from Frozen Cells\n\t\nQuickly thaw Plat-E cells in a 37 °C water bath and transfer to a 15 ml conical tube. Slowly add 9 ml of Plat-E medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) + 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) + Penicillin and Streptomycin).\nCentrifuge the tube at 180 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the cells with 10 ml of Plat-E medium and transfer to a 10 cm culture dish.\nIncubate the cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until they are 80-90% confluent (about 2 days).\nCell Splitting\n\t\nAspirate the medium and wash cells once with PBS.\nAdd 2 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 1 min at RT.\nDetach the cells by finger tapping, add 10 ml of Plat-E medium, and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 180 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells with 10 ml of Plat-E medium and seed them in new dishes at 1:4-1:6 dilutions.\nPlat-E Seeding and Transfection\n\t\nSeed 2 x 106 cells per 10 cm culture dish using Plat-E medium without any antibiotics.",
    "Incubate the cells O/N in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nNext day, transfer 300 μl of Opti-MEM into 1.5 ml microfuge tube.\nAdd 27 μl of polyethylenimine (PEI), a cost-effective transfection reagent12, to the prepared tube with Opti-MEM. Mix gently by finger tapping and incubate for 5 min at RT.\nAdd 9 μg of transfection-grade plasmid DNA into the Opti-MEM/PEI tube, mix gently by vortexing, and incubate for 15 min at RT.\nAdd the DNA/PEI complex drop-wise into the Plat-E dish, and incubate O/N at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nNext day, aspirate the medium containing the transfection reagent and add 10 ml of fresh Plat-E medium (without antibiotics).\nReturn the cells to the incubator.\n3. NIH 3T3 Cells and Infection\nEstablishing NIH 3T3 Cultures and Seeding\n\t\nQuickly thaw NIH 3T3 cells in a 37 °C water bath and transfer to a 15 ml tube. Slowly add 9 ml of NIH 3T3 medium (DMEM + 10% FBS).\nCentrifuge the tube at 180 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells with 10 ml of NIH 3T3 medium and transfer to a 10 cm culture dish.\nIncubate the cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. It is very important that NIH 3T3 cells are always kept underconfluent (50-60%), as the frequency of spontaneous transformation (and therefore basal levels of foci formation) increases once a culture reaches confluency.\nSeed 3 x 105 cells per 10 cm dish and incubate O/N for infection the next day.\nInfection\n\t\nHarvest the retroviral supernatant from the Plat-E dish by using a 10 ml disposable syringe, filtering it through a 0.45 μm pore size nylon membrane filter, and transferring it into a 15 ml tube.",
    "Add 10 ml of fresh Plat-E medium to the cells (without antibiotics), and return them to the incubator.\nAspirate the medium from the NIH 3T3 cell dish to be infected, and add 5 ml of regular NIH 3T3 medium and 5 ml of virus-containing filtered supernatant.\nAdd polybrene to the dish at a concentration of 6 μg/ml.\nIncubate the cells O/N at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nNext day, repeat steps 3.2.1 – 3.2.5 for a second round of infection.\nReplace the virus-containing medium with regular NIH 3T3 medium.\nAllow the NIH 3T3 cells to grow for 2-3 weeks, replacing the medium as necessary. Check expression of the protein of interest by conventional protein electrophoresis and immunoblot on whole cell lysates from replica plates.\n4. Staining and Quantification\nCrystal Violet Staining\n\t\nAspirate the NIH 3T3 medium and place the dishes on ice.\nWash the dishes twice with ice-cold PBS.\nFix the cells with ice-cold methanol for 10 min.\nRemove the dishes from ice, aspirate the methanol, and add 3 ml of 0.5% crystal violet solution made in 25% methanol (RT).\nIncubate the dishes for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the crystal violet solution and carefully rinse the dish with Milli-Q H2O until no color comes off in the rinse.\nAllow the dishes to dry O/N on a benchtop (uncovered).\nFoci Quantification\n\t\nOnce the dishes are dry, use a ruler to measure the darkly colored collections of cells on the plate. Only count those that are greater than 5 mm in diameter as “foci.” Record the number of foci and calculate averages and the significance compared to the controls.\nSubscription Required.
