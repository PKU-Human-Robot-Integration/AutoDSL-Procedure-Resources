    "1. Plasmid Construction\nConstruct an expression plasmid (pBAD-dual-TPL-GFP-WT) that expresses the TPL gene from Citrobacter freundii under the control of a constitutive promoter and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene with a His6-tag under the control of the araBAD promoter. For pBAD-dual-TPL-GFP-E90TAG, replace the codon for the site (E90) of DOPA with an amber codon (TAG), using a site-directed mutagenesis protocol. The details for the construction of this plasmid was described in our previous report18.\nConstruct a tRNA/aaRS-expressing plasmid (pEVOL-DHPRS2)18,19 for the genetic incorporation of DOPA. pEVOL is a special plasmid vector expressing two copies of aaRS genes with independent promoters, and the detailed information of the plasmid is described in a previous report19.\nUse commercially available plasmid preparation kits to obtain high purity plasmid DNAs. Check the purity of the prepped DNAs by using agarose gel electrophoresis, if necessary.\n2. Culture Preparation\nElectroporation\nUse the electro-competent E. coli DH10β strain for this experiment. Add 1 µL of each plasmid DNA (pEVOL-DHPRS2 and pBAD-dual-TPL-GFP-E90TAG) to 20 µL of competent cells. Mix them gently to make a homogeneous mixture, using a pipette.\nTransfer the mixture to the electroporation cuvettes. Place the cuvette in the electroporation chamber. Push the cuvette into the chamber to make firm cuvette-chamber contact.\nShock the cuvette, using 25 µF and 2.5 kV for 0.1-cm cuvettes.\nAdd 1 mL of prewarmed super optimal broth (SOC), containing 2% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM glucose, to the cuvette, and transfer the cells to a culture tube. Rescue the cells by incubating them for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking.",
    "Spread 10 - 100 µL of the rescued cells on a lysogeny broth (LB) agar plate containing 35 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 16 h.\nStarter culture preparation\nInoculate a single transformed colony in 5 mL of LB medium containing antibiotics. Incubate the colony for 12 h at 37 °C with shaking.\n3. Expression and Purification of GFP-E90DOPA by a Biosynthetic System\nExpression of GFP-E90DOPA by a biosynthetic system\nTransfer the starter culture (2 mL) to 100 mL of PA-5052 medium20 (50 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM [NH4]2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% [w/v] trace metals, 0.5% [w/v] glycerol, 0.05% [w/v] glucose, and 5% [w/v] amino acids [pH 7.25]) containing 35 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 100 mM pyruvate, 10 mM catechol, 25 mM ammonia, and 300 µM dithiothreitol (DTT) followed by an incubation at 30 °C with shaking.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.2% (w/v) L-arabinose when the optical density (OD) at 550 nm reaches 0.8. Incubate the sample for 12 h at 30 °C with shaking.\nSpin down the cells at 11,000 x g for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and freeze the cell pellet at -80 °C.\nCell lysis\nThaw the cell pellet on ice and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 10 mM imidazole, and 300 mM NaCl.\nSonicate the resuspended cells on ice for 10 min. Use 80% sonication amplitude with a pulse of 25 s on and 35 s off.\nSpin down the cell lysate at 18,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube for purification and discard the pellet.\nNi-NTA affinity chromatography",
    "Add Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) resin (300 µL of resin suspension for a 100-mL culture) to the supernatant and bind the proteins to the Ni-NTA resin at 4 °C by gently shaking the suspension for 1 h.\nTransfer the suspension to a polypropylene column and wash the resin 3x with 5 mL of wash buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 20 mM imidazole, and 300 mM NaCl.\nElute the proteins 3x with 300 µL of elution buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 250 mM imidazole, and 300 mM NaCl.\nDetermine the protein concentration by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient (24,630 M-1cm-1) for GFP-E90DOPA at 280 nm was calculated by a protein extinction coefficient calculator (e.g., https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) and the independently measured extinction coefficiennt (2630 M-1cm-1) for DOPA. As an alternative method, use the Bradford protein assay21 for a determination of the protein concentration.\n4. Oligomerization of Purified GFP-E90DOPA\nAdd 1 µL of sodium periodate in H2O (6 mM) (1.0 equiv. to GFP-E90DOPA) to a solution of 20 µL of GFP-E90DOPA (300 µM) in a phosphate buffer containing 50 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl.\nAllow the oligomerization reaction to proceed at 25 °C for 48 h.\nAnalyze the reaction mixture by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) (SDS-PAGE) as described in step 6.\n5. Conjugation of GFP-E90DOPA with an Alkyne Probe by SPOCQ\nAdd 1 µL of the Cy5.5-linked azadibenzocyclooctyne (Cy5.5-ADIBO)22 in H2O (4.0 mM) (10 equiv. to GFP-E90DOPA) to a solution of 20 µL of GFP-E90DOPA (20 µM) in a phosphate buffer containing 50 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl.\nAdd 1 µL of sodium periodate in H2O (400 µM) (1.0 equiv. to GFP-E90DOPA) to the reaction mixture.",
    "Allow the SPOCQ reaction to proceed at 25 °C for 1 h. If a light-sensitive probe is used, cover the reaction vessel with aluminum foil.\n6. Purification of the Labeled GFP\nDilute the SPOCQ reaction mixture by adding a phosphate buffer, containing 50 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl, up to 500 µL.\nTransfer the diluted solution to a centrifugal filter spin column. Centrifuge the spin column at 14,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min and discard the flow-through. Repeat this step 3x in order to remove any excess Cy5.5-ADIBO.\nTransfer the purified sample from the spin column to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAlternatively, carry out a purification by dialysis against the same buffer.\nStore the purified GFP at 4 °C.\n7. SDS-PAGE Analysis and Fluorescence Gel Scanning\nPrepare protein samples for SDS-PAGE analysis by adding 5 µL of protein sample buffer (see Table of Materials) and 2 µL of DTT (1.00 M) to 13 µL of purified, or crude, labeled GFP (13.6 µM or 0.38 mg/mL). For an analysis of oligomeric GFP, use a higher concentration of GFP (67.8 µM or 1.9 mg/mL). Denature the proteins by incubating them at 95 °C for 10 min.\nPlace a 4% - 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel cassette (purchased, premade gel cassettes) to the electrophoresis cell and add a running buffer (see Table of Materials). Load the protein samples and a molecular weight marker. Run the electrophoresis for 35 - 40 min at 200 V.\n\tNOTE: Avoid any exposure of the protein samples to light by carrying out all processes in the dark, to minimize photo-bleaching of the fluorescent probe.",
    "Use a fluorescence scanner for fluorescence imaging. Wrap a protein gel from electrophoresis and place it on a fluorescence scanner. Scan the gel by using an appropriate wavelength setting. For Cy5.5, select the Cy5 mode provided in the scanner software.\nStain the gel with a commercial protein staining reagent.\n8. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis by Trypsin Digestion\nIncubate 100 µL of purified GFP-E90DOPA (2.2 mg/mL or 80 µM) in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 25 mM DTT at 60 °C for 1 h.\nAdd 1 µL of Iodoacetamide in H2O (IAA, 4.0 M) (500 equiv. to GFP-E90DOPA) to the purified GFP-E90DOPA solution (80 µM) in the same buffer. Incubate the mixture at 25 °C for 30 min with protection from light.\nDigest the GFP-E90DOPA sample by adding trypsin (1:100 protease-to-substrate-protein ratio [w/w]) and incubate the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 4 h.\nPurify the digested peptide sample by using a standard desalting method with C18 spin columns.\nAnalyze the digested peptides by the reported protocol for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as a matrix23.\nSubscription Required.
