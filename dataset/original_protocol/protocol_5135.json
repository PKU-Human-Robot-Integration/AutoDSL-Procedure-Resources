    "Polymerization of fluorescent MTsIn a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, dissolve 0.25 mg tubulin in 60 µl of BRB80 solution (containing 10% glycerol). Store on ice.Add 20 µg of Rhodamine tubulin into the 60 µl solution. Mix gently for 30 sec and store tube half submerged in an ice bucket.Add 1/10 the total volume of the 60 µl of tubulin mix, worth of 10 mM GTP, to the 60 µl tubulin mix, with a final concentration of 1 mM GTP. Mix gently by inverting. Add 1/10 the total volume of mixture step 1c, worth of 1 µM taxol, to the mix, with a final taxol concentration of 0.1 µM. Incubate (in water bath) at 37 °C for 10 min.Add 1/10 the total volume of mixture step 1d, worth of 10 µM taxol, to the mix, with a final taxol concentration of 1 µM. Incubate (in water bath) at 37 °C for 10 min.Add 1/10 the total volume of mixture step 1e, worth of 100 µM taxol, to the mix, with a final taxol concentration of 10 µM. Incubate (in water bath) at 37 °C for 10 min. Store the polymerized MTs at room temperature, with the tube covered in aluminum foil and stored in a closet to protect the mixture from light. The MTs are stable for use for up to two weeks.Prepare chamberimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170328/20170328181842_4765.jpgFigure 1. Infusion of chamber. Using two pieces of double sided tape, a coverslip is attached to a microscope slide, completing the preparation of the flow chamber. Using a pipette with appropriate volumes, infuse chamber by pipetting solution into the opening of the flow chamber. A Kimwipe is used to facilitate diffusion of the solution across the chamber and absorb excess liquid at the end.",
    "Acid wash coverslip with HCl (37%, v/v) for 24 h, rinse with de-ionized water and air dry for 24 h.After cleaning, put a drop of 0.2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran on coverslip and let sit for 5 min.Absorb remaining liquid with Kimwipe and air dry coverslip.Place two strips of double sided tape (L x 22 mm) parallel to each other on microscope slide at a distance of 22 mm from each other. Place the coverslip down, matching the alignment of the tape, with the DEAE-dextran coated side facing towards the microscope slide. Refer to Figure 1.Prepare bundling mixture.Prepare 25 µl mix in buffer T, with the following reagents to a final concentration of; 2.5 mM MTs, 0.2 mM motor proteins, 10 µM taxol, and 1 mM ATP. Note: For motor proteins, we use hydrodynamic assays (Tao et al., 2016) to determine the MW. For MT, we use MW of tubulin dimer (α tubulin + β tubulin) to calculate the concentration of MTs.Shake the mixture at 50 rpm at room temperature for 30 min.Infuse mix from step 3 into flow chamber:Infuse 25 µl into the flow chamber(s), let sit for 3 min. Refer to Figure 1.Wash out any unstuck proteins with a continuous flow of 25 µl buffer T solution (including reagents with a final concentration of 1 mM ATP, 10 mM taxol, and Antifade), repeated two additional times. Use a similar technique as infusion. Refer to Figure 1.Observe and record MT bundling using inverted fluorescence microscope (12-volt 100-watt tungsten-halide lamp, excitation wavelength, 547 nm; emission wavelength, 576 nm in conjunction with a 570 nm dichroic mirror, objective: CFI Plan Fluor 100x oil, Nikon Instruments, model: Eclipse E600)."
