    "1. Preparation of Liposomes and Proteoliposomes\nLiposome Formation\n\t\nUsing a glass syringe, add 1,435 µl POPC (25 mg/ml, in chloroform) and 160 µl POPG (25 mg/ml, in chloroform) to a round bottom flask to obtain 52.5 µmol lipids in a molar ratio of POPC:POPG = 9:1.\nDry the lipids for 30 min using a rotary evaporator at a rotation speed of 145 rpm (no water bath is needed for this volume of solvent), then transfer the flask to a vacuum desiccator for at least 3 hr, or overnight, at room temperature (RT).\nHydrate the dried lipid film with 10 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl (henceforth referred to as buffer A) by gently swirling the flask until a homogenous, turbid suspension results;\n\t\tNOTE: The lipid concentration at this stage is expected to be 5.25 mM as no losses should have occurred so far.\nSonicate the suspension in a water bath for 10 min at room temperature with a frequency of 40 kHz. The solution will look somewhat clearer.\nUsing an extruder, pass the suspension 10 times through a membrane with a 400 nm pore size, followed by a second cycle of extrusion with 4 passes through a membrane with a 200 nm pore size.\n\t\tNOTE: The mean diameter of the resulting LUVs is ~175 nm. If necessary, the size and homogeneity of the LUVs can be checked by Dynamic Light Scattering according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nQuantify the phospholipid concentration of the LUV suspension as described in section 1.2).\n\t\tNOTE: Because of losses during extrusion, the concentration is usually around 3.6 mM.\nStore the LUVs at 4 °C for about 2 weeks if not used immediately.\nPhospholipid Quantification",
    "NOTE: To determine the phospholipid concentration of the LUV suspension used for reconstitution, as well as that of the proteoliposomes that are eventually generated, an aliquot of the sample is subjected to oxidation by perchloric acid. This procedure breaks down phospholipids to release inorganic phosphate that is then quantified by a colorimetric assay in comparison with standards 23.\n\t\nPrepare a 40 mM stock solution of sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) in deionized distilled water.\nDilute the stock solution with deionized distilled water to obtain 4 mM and 0.4 mM working solutions that will serve as calibration standards.\nUsing the working solutions, prepare standards in 13 x 100 mm2 glass tubes ranging from 0 to 80 nmol sodium phosphate in a final volume of 50 µl.\nTake 10 µl each of the LUV and proteoliposome samples to be quantified and dilute with 40 µl of ddH2O in 13 x 100 mm2 glass tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: As the lipid concentration of the LUVs and proteoliposomes is in the range 2.5-5 µM, the 10 µl of sample should contain 25-50 nmol lipid phosphorus.\nAdd 300 µl perchloric acid to each of the standards and samples and heat for 1 hr at 145 °C in a heating block. Put marbles on the tubes to prevent evaporation.\nLet the tubes cool to room temperature and add 1 ml of ddH2O.\nAdd 400 µl each of freshly prepared 12 g/L ammonium molybdate and 50 g/L sodium ascorbate and vortex to mix.\nHeat for 10 min at 100 °C with marbles on top of the tubes. Remove the tubes from the heating block and let them cool to room temperature.\nMeasure the absorbance of the samples against the blank (standard sample containing 0 nmol sodium phosphate) with a spectrometer at a wavelength of 797 nm.",
    "Determine the phosphate content of samples against the calibration standard curve.\nReconstitution of Opsin\n\tNOTE: It is necessary to determine optimal swelling conditions for reconstitution as these depend on the nature of the detergent, as well as the lipid composition and concentration of the LUVs. As LUVs change their light scattering properties on swelling the process can be monitored by measuring absorbance (Figure 2) as reviewed by Rigaud and Levy 24 and Geertsma et al. 25.\n\t\nPipette 800 µl of LUVs (from section 1.1; as lipid recovery after extrusion is 70%, the expected concentration of LUVs is 3.6 mM phospholipid) into a 2 ml microfuge tube.\nAdd 5.3 µl of buffer A and 34.7 µl of 10% (w/v) DDM dissolved in buffer A.\nIncubate for 3 hr at room temperature with end-over-end mixing.\nMeanwhile prepare the polystyrene beads:\n\t\t\nUse 400 mg of beads per sample and weigh them out in a glass beaker.\nWash them twice with methanol, three times with water and once with buffer A. For each washing step use 5 ml of liquid and stir slowly for 10 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to prepare the polystyrene beads for several samples at once, e.g., weigh in 6 g of beads and wash with 75 ml of liquid. Excess beads can be stored in a refrigerator for several days.\nDuring the last 30 min of vesicle destabilization dry the NBD-labeled phospholipid in a screw-cap glass tube ('reconstitution glass tube'): Per sample, 9.5 µl of NBD-PC (1 mg/ml in chloroform, yielding 0.4 mol% of total phospholipids) are dried under a stream of nitrogen in a glass tube and subsequently dissolved in 45 µl of 0.1% (w/v) DDM in buffer A.",
    "After 3 hr of vesicle destabilization add the dissolved-NBD-labeled phospholipid, the DDM-solubilized protein and buffer A such that the final volume of 1 ml contains 0.36% (w/v), i.e., 7 mM, DDM.\n\t\t\nThus, to generate protein-free liposomes (used as a control sample) add 45 µl of NBD-PC (dissolved in 0.1% DDM), 60 µl of 0.1% DDM and 55 µl of buffer A; for proteoliposomes add, for example, 40 µl of protein (from a typical stock solution of ~110 ng/µl) in 0.1% DDM, 45 µl of NBD-PC (dissolved in 0.1% DDM), 20 µl of 0.1% DDM and 55 µl of buffer A.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The order of addition should be as listed.\nMix the sample for an additional hr end over end at room temperature.\nAdd 80 mg of the prepared polystyrene beads and incubate the sample with end-over-end mixing for 1 hr at RT.\nNext add an additional 160 mg of polystyrene beads and incubate with end-over-end mixing for a further 2 hr at RT.\nTransfer the sample (leaving the spent polystyrene beads behind) to a glass screw-cap tube containing 160 mg of fresh polystyrene beads and mix overnight at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The easiest way to transfer the sample and avoid sucking up beads is to use a Pasteur pipette that is pushed to the bottom of the glass tube with a little positive pressure. Once the tip of the pipette is firmly at the bottom of the tube, then the sample can be withdrawn easily without interference from the beads.\nThe next morning, transfer the sample to a microfuge tube without carrying over beads and place on ice in preparation for the scramblase activity assay.\n2. Scramblase Activity Assay",
    "NOTE: The fluorescence intensity of liposomes or proteoliposomes diluted with buffer A is monitored over time upon the addition of dithionite in a fluorescence spectrometer. To obtain a stable starting intensity, the fluorescence is recorded for at least 50 sec (or until a stable signal is achieved) before adding dithionite to a constantly stirred sample and is then followed for at least 500 sec after adding dithionite.\nAdd 1,950 µl of buffer A to a plastic cuvette containing a mini stir-bar.\nAdd 50 µl of the prepared proteo(liposomes) and let the sample equilibrate in the fluorescence spectrometer with constant stirring for several sec.\nMeanwhile prepare a solution of 1 M dithionite in 0.5 M unbuffered Tris (e.g., for two samples weigh out 20 mg of dithionite in a microfuge tube and dissolve in 114 µl ice-cold 0.5 M Tris directly before use and keep on ice for the next sample).\n\tNOTE: The dithionite solution must be prepared freshly and should not be used more than 20 min after preparation; if many measurements are to be made, aliquots of dithionite can be weighed out in advance and dissolved right before use.\nStart the fluorescence monitoring (excitation 470 nm, emission 530 nm, slit width 0.5 nm).\nAdd 40 µl of the 1 M dithionite solution to the cuvette 50 sec after starting the fluorescence recording (use the septum in the lid of the cuvette chamber if possible) and continue to record the fluorescence for a further 400-600 sec.\nAnalyze the data as described in section 3.\n3. Data Analysis\nKinetics of Scrambling",
    "Characterize the fluorescence trace of each sample obtained by the scramblase activity assay by defining the initial fluorescence, Fi, prior to adding dithionite, and the end-point fluorescence, F, reached after >400 sec. Fi is determined for each sample as the mean value of fluorescence for the 30 sec period prior to addition of dithionite.\nDetermine the end-point data corresponding to the extent of fluorescence reduction, R = 100•F/Fi. We use the terms RL for protein-free liposomes and RP for opsin-containing proteoliposomes.\nDetermining the Molecular Weight of the Functionally Reconstituted Scramblase\n\t\nConvert the fluorescence reduction data according to the following equation:\n\t\tp(≥1 scramblase) = (RP − RL)/(Rmax − RL) (Equation 1)\n\t\tNOTE: Where Rmax is the maximum reduction that is obtained when sufficient protein is reconstituted such that all vesicles in the sample possess at least one functional scramblase, and p is the probability that a particular vesicle in a reconstituted sample is 'scramblase-active', i.e., it possesses at least one functional scramblase. The value for RL is typically 45% 3 whereas Rmax is typically 82.5% 3 , instead of the expected 100% (Rmax can be experimentally determined for opsin proteoliposomes with a PPR of >1 mg/mmol). As Rmax <100% it is assumed that a sub-population of vesicles is refractory to reconstitution. For Rmax = 82.5%, the fraction of vesicles that is unable to accept protein is 0.35.\nDescribe the relationship between p(≥1 scramblase) and PPR (mg protein/mmol phospholipid) by Poisson statistics as follows:\n\t\tp(≥1 scramblase) = 1 - e-m = 1 - exp(-PPR/α) (Equation 2)\n\t\tNOTE: Where m = number of scramblases per vesicle and α = mono-exponential fit constant in units of mg protein/mmol phospholipid.\nAs a fraction of the vesicles does not contribute to scrambling even at high PPR (see discussion), modify the equation to:",
    "p(≥1 scramblase) = 1 - exp(-PPR*/α) (Equation 3)\n\t\tNOTE: Where PPR* = PPR/(1-f), where f is the refractory population of vesicles or, in this case, PPR* = PPR/0.65 (Equation 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The fit constant α is determined by fitting a graph of p(≥1 scramblase) versus PPR* with a mono-exponential function. If opsin (molecular weight 41.7 kDa) functionally reconstitutes into 175-nm-diameter vesicles (each vesicle has 280,000 phospholipids 26) as a monomer, α = 0.187 mg mmol−1. If opsin dimerizes prior to reconstitution 3 to yield scramblase-active vesicles, then α = 0.37 mg mmol−1. If PPR rather than PPR* were to be used for the analysis, then the corresponding α values would be 0.122 and 0.244 mg mmol−1. These predicted values for α assume that all opsin molecules are functionally competent. If only a fraction of the molecules is competent to scramble lipids, then the corresponding values of α will be larger.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
