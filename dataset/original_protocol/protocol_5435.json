Overview of the phosphate assay in Chlorella. +S, sulfur-replete medium (control culture); -S, sulfur-depleted medium (experimental culture; for details, see Ota et al., 2016).Sampling and preparing algal samplesTake 10 ml of algal culture [OD595: 1-2 in TAP medium (Ota et al., 2016)] in a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 2,500 x g at room temperature with the swing rotor. Discard the supernatant. At this point, additional samples should be taken for dry weight and/or cell number measurement (see Data analysis below).Resuspend the pellet with 2 ml distilled water and transfer to a new 2-ml microtube. The suspended samples can be divided into halves: 1 ml for poly-P assay and 1 ml for total-P assay. Centrifuge again at room temperature for 5 min at 2,500 x g. Discard the supernatant. At this point, the pellet can be stored in a freezer at -20 °C for further analysis.Extraction of poly-PAdd 1 ml of > 5% sodium hypochlorite to the cell pellet.Add 2-3 microspatulas of glass beads (approximately 50 mg) and mix vigorously using a microtube mixer for 10-15 min at 4 °C in a cold room. Centrifuge for 2 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant.Add 1 ml of sodium hypochlorite to the cell pellet. Centrifuge for 2 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant. Repeat step 3. Note: The high chain length of polyphosphate is virtually insoluble in alkaline sodium hypochlorite (Sutherland and Wilkinson, 1971).Add 100 µl of distilled water and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Centrifuge for 2 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant (a).Add 100 µl of distilled water and incubate for 5 min.",
    "Centrifuge for 2 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant (b).Add 1.8 ml of ethanol to the supernatant (a + b) and centrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C. In this step, poly-Ps are precipitated as a white pellet at the bottom of the test tube.Remove the supernatant carefully, add 500 µl of distilled water, and mix vigorously (poly-P solution). Note: Amount of distilled water may be adjusted from 50 to 500 µl (OD880 > 0.3; see Data analysis below).Add 100 µl of 4% (w/v) potassium persulfate to the poly-P solution.For hydrolysis to orthophosphate, autoclave the poly-P solution at 121 °C for 20 min without fast exhaust option to avoid loss of samples. Leave the cap open and cover the microtube with aluminum foil when autoclaving.The autoclaved samples are now ready to use for molybdenum blue assay (see Procedure D).Extraction of total PResuspend the cell pellet from A3 with 1 ml of distilled water. Disrupt samples. Add 2-3 microspatulas of glass beads and mix vigorously using a microtube mixer for 10-15 min at 4 °C in a cold room.Add 200 µl of 4% (w/v) potassium persulfate to the sample.Autoclave the poly-P solution at 121 °C for 20 min without fast exhaust to avoid loss of samples. Leave the cap open and cover the microtube with aluminum foil when autoclaving. The autoclaved samples are now ready to use for molybdenum blue assay (see Procedure D). Note: The supernatant is used for assay. Normally, there is no need for centrifugation step.Molybdenum blue reaction in a 96-well microplatePipette 200 µl of diluted sample (196 µl of distilled water + 4 µl of poly-P/total-P samples) per well. Add 8 µl of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate solution (see Recipes below).Add 2 µl of 7.",
    "2% (w/v) L-ascorbic acid solution.Seal with plate seal film and mix well (Invert the plate 3-5 times).Incubate for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. The mixture will turn blue in color if orthophosphate is present (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830005744_2641.jpgFigure 2. Molybdenum blue reaction in a 96-well microplate. This is an example of the phosphate ion standard dilution series (0, 0.5, 1, 2 mg/L from left to right, n = 3).Measure the absorbance at 880 nm (OD880) using a microplate reader. Note: If wavelength at 880 nm is not available, select an alternative wavelength near 880 nm."
