    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPlasmids generation\nTiming: 1.5–2 weeks\nThis section describes how to generate both required plasmids for HDR genetic editing; the HDR donor plasmid using HiFi/Gibson assembly, and the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid using restriction enzyme cloning. HiFi assembly is idea to assemble the HDR donor plasmid since several pieces from different sources can be ligated simultaneously (Gibson et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). For the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid, PX459 includes an optimized restriction site to insert the sgRNA (Ran et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nPCR amplify all required pieces for the HDR donor plasmid using Q5 DNA polymerase or an alternative high-fidelity DNA polymerase (day 1–3).\nUse the online NEB Tm calculator (tmcalculator.neb.com[href=http://tmcalculator.neb.com]) to estimate the annealing temperature for each primer pair acquired from the HiFi NEBuilder tool.\nFollow the manufacturer’s guidelines to estimate extension times. Q5 polymerase generally amplifies 1,000 bp/20–40 s (difficult amplicons can take up to 40 s, while generally 20–30 s is sufficient. Manufacturer’s protocol available here[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2013/12/13/pcr-using-q5-high-fidelity-dna-polymerase-m0491]).\nThe DNA template for each piece will be different. For homology arms, it will be extracted mouse genomic DNA. For other fragments, it will be the respective source plasmid.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1948_2.csv\nWe use 1–3 ng for plasmid DNA, and 10–100 ng for genomic DNA templates. While the GC enhancer is optional, we usually find it helpful given that most assembly primers are long and have high annealing temperatures, which could be reduced with the GC enhancer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1948_3.csv\nFollowing amplification of all fragments, run PCR products on a 1.5% agarose gel to isolate the desired amplicon (band on the gel) from each reaction. Then, purify using QIAGEN gel purification kit or a similar kit (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nStore all gel purified fragments at −20°C until assembly.\nAnneal and phosphorylate sgRNA oligos (day 1).\nPrepare the following mix for the reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1948_4.csv",
    "Incubate the mix in a thermocycler at 37°C for 30 min, then 95°C for 5 min, then ramp down to 25°C at an interval of 5°C/min.\nThe product can be stored at −20°C.\nLinearize and dephosphorylate CRISPR-Cas9 PX459 vector (day 2).\nStart by purifying the plasmid from a bacterial exponential phase liquid culture using a kit such as the QIAGEN miniprep kit.\nThis vector is designed to be digested using BbsI, which will leave matching overhangs for the annealed sgRNA oligos to ligate (Ran et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Set up the following digest:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1948_5.csv\nIncubate in a thermocycler at 37°C for 40 min, followed by 65°C for 20 min to deactivate the enzyme.\nAdd 2 μL Quick CIP to the 50 μL product reaction and incubate at 37°C for 30 min to dephosphorylate the linearized plasmid.\nRun the product on a 1.5% agarose gel. Cut and gel purify the linearized plasmid band.\nThis product can be stored at −20°C long term, and be used to future sgRNA ligations.\nNote: Dephosphorylation and gel purification are not required in this step. However, they will increase the efficiency of sgRNA ligation to this plasmid (∼100% efficient).\nAssemble/ligate both plasmids (day 4).\nFor the HDR donor plasmid:\nPrepare the following mix using the NEB HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1948_6.csv\nNote: In our reaction, we have 4 pieces. Depending on available concentrations, we use 0.05–0.1 pmole/piece. For DNA fragments, pmoles = (weight in ng × 1000) / (length of piece in bp × 650).\nPrepare a similar reaction, lacking only one insert piece to serve as a negative control for transformation.\nIncubate the mix in a thermocycler at 50°C for 60 min.\nThe product is ready for transformation and can be stored at −20°C.\nFor the PX459 plasmid:",
    "Dilute the annealed sgRNA oligos from step 2: 1 μL in 200 μL ddH2O.\nPrepare the following ligation mix.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1948_7.csv\nPrepare a similar reaction, lacking the diluter sgRNA oligos to serve as a negative control for transformation.\nIncubate at room temperature (23°C–25°C) for 15 min, then place on ice.\nBacterial transformation of both plasmids (day 5).\nAny transformation competent bacteria may be used. We routinely use NEB 5-alpha competent E. coli. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2015/02/17/nebuilder-hifi-dna-assembly-chemical-transformation-protocol-e2621-e5520-e2623].\nUse 2 μL of each assembled plasmid per 50 μL of bacteria.\nInclude a negative assembly mix plate, and a negative PX459 ligation control.\nCritical: If you are using bacteria from another vendor, the HiFi assembly product needs to be diluted 4-fold prior to using 2 μL to transform bacteria.\nPick bacterial colonies and inoculate liquid cultures (day 6).\nNote that the negative control plates will be very helpful at this stage. If performed correctly, they should contain no to very few colonies.\nPick using sterile pipette tips in a sterile field and inoculate 5 mL with the appropriate selection antibiotic of L-broth (LB) per colony (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nNote: In our experience, both of these reactions are very (∼100%) efficient and should produce hundreds of colonies on a 10 cm bacterial L-agar plate. Picking 3–6 colonies per plate will be sufficient.\nPurify plasmids using a kit such as a QIAGEN miniprep kit (day 7).\nSave 1 mL of each culture and store at 4°C for inoculating a larger scale (maxi or midi) prep culture of your validated clones.\nValidate the HDR donor plasmid using restriction enzyme digestion (day 7).\nChoose 2–3 enzymes that produce 2–3 cuts and result in a unique gel signature upon digestion.\nWe use Benchling.com[href=http://Benchling.com] to run a virtual digest of the in silico plasmid for easy design.",
    "Validate both plasmids by sequencing (day 7–9).\nAny Sanger or long-read sequencing service would be suitable.\nsgRNAs are too small to detect using restriction enzyme digests, thus sequencing is required.\nFor the HDR donor plasmid, the most important region to validate by sequencing is the insert and immediate left and right arm borders to ensure correct in-frame design.\nInoculate a large culture (100–200 mL) of one sequence-validated clone per plasmid, and purify plasmids using a kit such as the QIAGEN maxiprep kit (day 10–11).\nNote: Aim for a concentration of 1–2 μg/μL for each plasmid to be ready for transfection. If concentration is less than 1 μg/μL, concentrate plasmid DNA using isopropanol precipitation or a kit.\nNote: If a glycerol bacterial stock is desired, 0.5 mL of the large culture may be mixed with 0.5 mL of 50% glycerol in ddH2O (vol/vol) or LB (without antibiotics) and stored for long term at −80°C.\nPause point: Purified and concentrated plasmid DNAs can be stored at −20°C for short or long term until ready to proceed to the cell transfection step.\nmESCs transfection and selection\nTiming: 10–12 days\nThis section details how to introduce the prepared plasmids into mESCs using an Amaxa 4D Nucleofector, to perform the desired genetic editing, and how to select the targeted cell population to enrich for cells having successfully integrated the HDR cassette. There are several alternative methods to achieve this, and we mention several of them throughout the protocol. In the following step, we use Lonza’s large cuvette/100 μL electroporation reaction. The manufacturer’s guidelines are available here[href=https://bioscience.lonza.com/download/product/asset/21266].\nOne day prior to transfection, prepare one 10-cm tissue culture plate by seeding MEFs feeders. Refer to the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section for details on culture conditions and concentrations (day 1).",
    "Change medium on growing mESCs in culture. Aim to have cells 70%–80% confluent on the day of transfection. Refer to “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” for details on culture conditions and concentrations (day 1).\nDay of transfection (day 2):\nDissociate 70%–80% confluent mESCs using 0.05% Trypsin. One well of 6-well plate produces ∼1.5–3 × 106 cells, which is sufficient for one transfection.\nQuench the Trypsin with medium and dissociate via pipetting to generate a single cell suspension.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer or automated counter, then centrifuge 2 × 106 cells at 350 × g and aspirate medium.\nResuspend cells in premixed 100 μL of electroporation buffer: 82 μL Nucleofector Solution and 18 μL Supplement. Pipette up and down gently several times until cells are completely resuspended. Avoid generating air bubbles.\nAdd the mix to a new tube containing 5 μg of PX459 and 5 μg of the HDR donor plasmids. Make sure the total volume of both plasmids does not exceed 10 μL (step 10).\nImmediately add the mix to an electroporation cuvette and run ES cells program (GC-104) on a Lonza Amaxa 4D Nucleofector.\nGently add 500 μL of medium to the cuvette after electroporation. Do not pipette up and down.\nGently transfer the entire mix to the pre-warmed MEF feeders-covered 10-cm dish.\nChange medium after 24 h. Avoid disturbing the cells as they recover from the electroporation (day 3).\nAlternatively, cells may be transfected using an alternative method established for use with mESCs, such as other electroporation techniques, or lipid-based approaches, such as Lipofectamine. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for each method.\nInitiate puromycin selection 48 h after transfection, and change medium every 1–2 days (day 4- day 10).\nAdd puromycin to medium at 2 μg/mL, before medium change.",
    "Change medium daily for the first 2–3 days of selection to wash off the significant dying cell debris resulting from the initiation of drug selection.\nNotice the expansion of puromycin resistant colonies representing individual clones (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: Continuous puromycin selection will initially select for all cells that have acquired the PX459 vector. After one week, the puromycin resistance from this vector will be diminished, and only cells that have integrated the plasmid insert correctly in-frame will be puromycin resistant and selected for. Transfection with both plasmids in a circular state minimizes random integration events, and renders the selection extremely efficient. Given that HDR is inefficient, and we are selecting for it, relatively few surviving mESC colonies will be present in the dish after selection ends compared to starting cells. These cells will be sparse and will form ∼50–100 colonies per plate in our experience, that are virtually all clonal. This approach eliminates the need to perform single cell seeding following transfection, which ultimately decreases the time of the protocol and the in vitro culture of correctly targeted mESCs prior to chimera generation. Confirming that all cells within any one clone carry the insertion is also possible using immunostaining, as is described in the validation section below.\nPicking, expanding, and freezing clones\nTiming: 10–12 days\nThis section discusses picking and expanding clones of targeted ESCs for carrying out downstream validation of targeted clones and cryopreservation. After 9–12 days, the colonies have well-demarcated bright edges and a dark center. The following steps will be carried in 96-well dishes to enable high-throughput analyses. Use of multi-channel pipettors is highly recommended, for speed and reproducibility.\nOne day in advance, prepare one flat-bottom 96-well plate with MEF feeders (day 1).\nProceed to colony picking (day 2).",
    "Prepare a U- or V-bottom 96-well plate by adding 25 μL 0.05% Trypsin into each well.\nAspirate medium from targeting/selection plates and wash twice with PBS−/−, then add 7 mL PBS−/− to the plate and proceed to colony picking.\nUnder a stereomicroscope in a sterile laminar flow hood, use a pipettor to pick large colonies with well-defined borders and place them in the prepared Trypsin-containing 96-well plate.\nCritical: Do not pick colonies that are not singular (these are likely to be mixed clones) or too small (these may not proliferate). Do not pick colonies that have differentiation at borders. Additionally, pay attention not to add two colonies to the same well of the multi-well plate, and check under the microscope after picking to exclude any wells that may have more than one colony added. You should perform the colony picking as quickly as possible without stopping until you have picked colonies into all wells or a sufficient number (if you don’t have enough colonies to fill the plate) of the wells. Pick clones that are similar in size to have synchronized culture and splitting time across all wells.\nNote: In our experience, ∼50% of clones will have at least one correctly edited allele. Picking 36–48 clones consistently generated many correctly targeted clones, including both heterozygous and homozygous alleles.\nIncubate the 96-well plate containing the picked colonies in a 37°C incubator for 10 min. Shake in the middle of the incubation to help dissociate the cells.\nAdd 75 μL of medium into each well and pipette up and down 10–15 times to gently dissociate the colonies into single cells.",
    "Add the entire 100 μL of cells to the prepared 96-well plate with MEF feeders, which should contain 75 μL of medium. The final cells and medium volume in each well will be 175 μL. Return to the incubator.\nChange medium every 1–2 days until the majority of wells have reached 80% confluency (usually 3–5 days).\nSplit/freeze the clones (day 6).\nAfter dissociating the cells with 25 μL Trypsin, resuspend in a total of 200 μL medium.\nSplit into three 96-well plates, 50 μL each, for validation assays. Note that passaging these cells will be done without feeders.\nNote: Since these cells will be used for analysis, there is no need to culture them on feeders. A gelatinized dish will suffice. Refer to “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”: step 9 for details of preparing gelatin-coated dishes.\nFreeze the remaining 50 μL cell suspension by adding 50 μL of 2× freezing medium: 20% DMSO and 80% FBS, for a final freezing medium with 10% DMSO.\nCover the wells with 80 μL of mineral oil and place in a −80°C freezer for short term storage while clones are being screened and validated.\nChange medium on analysis plates every 1–2 days (day 7–10).\nPause point: At this stage, it is possible to pause the protocol, but if this is done, we recommend freezing at least one additional plate of the clones for thawing for analysis, in addition to the one frozen plate which will be reserved for chimera generation or other experiments.\nOptional: If more downstream analyses are to be carried than detailed below, it is possible to keep expanding these clones as desired given that they are not being used for experiments requiring good developmental potential.\nValidation of correctly targeted clones\nTiming: 7–10 days",
    "This section describes methods used to screen and validate correct targeting of the clones and to determine hetero vs. homozygosity clones. The approach we use is aimed at maximizing speed and efficiency. As a result, we recommend taking advantage of the 2×HA tag as a readily detectable epitope to preliminarily assay correct targeting and degradation using immunofluorescence. Once several correct clones are identified, validation by western blotting for the fusion protein, and PCR for the edited allele can be performed.\nOnce 70% confluent, take two of the three validation plates (step 20), and treat one of them with 500 nM dTAG-13 or dTAGv-1 in maintenance medium for 2 h. Maintain/passage the third plate as needed (day 1).\nFix the treated and control plates in 4% PFA for 10 min, and perform fluorescent immunostaining (day 2–3).\nStain both plates using an anti-HA antibody, and if available also an antibody to the target protein. Typical immunostaining procedure can be followed[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/antibodies/antibodies-learning-center/antibodies-resource-library/antibody-application-testing-protocols/immunofluorescence-protocol-adherent-suspension-application-testing.html].\nCheck clones under an epifluorescence microscope. Take images of clones exhibiting fluorescence signal localized to the subcellular location expected for the target protein in the control plate and an absence of signal in the corresponding wells of the treated plate (in the case of NELFB, a nuclear signal is expected) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1948-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

(bottom) PCR validation of targeted knock-in of the tag.\n(C) Immunoblotting assay showing negative, heterozygous, and homozygous clones +/- dTAG-13.",
    "Note: The strong affinity of anti-HA antibody makes this immunostaining more cost effective than any other analysis for 1st pass screening of clones. In situ immunostaining enables identification of positive clones for the HA-tagged knock-in, the degradation of this tag in the dTAG treated plate, and the correct subcellular localization of the anti-HA signal which should correspond to the localization of the tagged fusion protein (e.g., nucleus vs. cytoplasm vs. plasma membrane).\nNote: Certain targets may be exclusively degraded using dTAG-13 or dTAGv-1. If HA staining is present in the correct compartment, but no degradation is observed with dTAG-13, this might be the case, and a repeat of this staining or trying dTAGv-1 in immunoblotting later is warranted. Alternatively, some targets may require several hours of incubation for significant degradation to occur.\nPerform a validation PCR for clones that show HA staining in the expected subcellular compartment (day 4).\nDesign PCR primers that amplify both wild-type and edited alleles (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nDNA can be acquired for any clone of interest from one of the immunostained plates.\nAfter finishing immunostaining, wash the plate 3× with PBS+/+ (with Magnesium and Calcium).\nAdd 40 μL of DNA lysis buffer to each well (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nIncubate overnight (∼16 h) at 55°C in a humidified chamber.\nNote: Due to the presence of MEF feeders, homozygous clones may show a faint wild-type band in the PCR assay, but it will be of lower intensity than the wild-type band observed in heterozygous clones. If a cleaner PCR is required for validation, cells may be passaged 2–3 times from the remaining validation plate prior to DNA lysis which will be sufficient to dilute out the feeders.\nIdentify 3–4 heterozygous and homozygous clones from the PCR and perform a western blot (day 4–7).",
    "Expand these clones from the remining analysis plate, each into one well in a 24-well plate, then into 2 wells in a 12-well plate. Ultimately, a minimum of two, 12-well plate wells are required for the following immunoblotting analysis. Expand to more wells if other analyses are desired.\nTreat one of the 12-well plates with 500 nM dTAG-13 or dTAG-v1 for 2 h (see step 24 note).\nIsolate protein from these plates and perform immunoblotting analysis using anti-HA and antibody against the target protein. Typical immunoblotting procedure can be followed[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/sites/default/files/2021-11/Bulletin_3258.pdf].\nTagged alleles will express a fusion protein and show a size shift corresponding to the molecular weight of FKBP12F36V (∼12 kDa) in the target protein blot. The HA blot will show higher (two-fold) intensity for homozygous clones. dTAG treated colonies should show near complete degradation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nPause point: At this stage, you should have identified correctly targeted clones and determined their hetero or homozygosity. When ready to proceed to the generation of chimeric mice (or alternatively in vitro differentiation experiments), thaw the frozen clones. If you do not plan to generate a genetically engineered mouse model (GEM) from your degron targeted mESCs, and are instead interested in homozygous targeted mESCs for in vitro differentiation experiments, this is the end of the protocol.\nChimeric mouse generation and colony establishment\nTiming: 4–6 months",
    "This section discusses the steps to generate a transgenic mouse from targeted mESCs. Generating mice is most commonly achieved by injection or aggregation of correctly targeted mESCs into host 8-cell or blastocyst stage mouse embryos, followed by transfer of embryos into pseudo-pregnant surrogate females (Poueymirou et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Alternatively, direct injection of the validated plasmids to mouse zygotes or 2-cell embryos could be pursued (Chen et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Gu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Performing microinjections and transferring embryos require technical skills and specialized equipment, and are typically performed as a service by an institutional transgenic core facility or a company. Once a date for injections is arranged with a facility, information on the parental mESCs regards the strain from which they are derived, in particular their coat color, is needed to determine the host wild-type embryo genotype and its derivative coat color (which should contrast with that of the mESCs). 7–10 days in advance, thaw the clones.\nOne day in advance, seed MEFs onto a 12-well plate (day 1).\nThaw 2–3 of the clones identified as correctly targeted (day 2).\nTake out the freezing plate and thaw in a 37°C incubator for 10–15 min.\nOnce thawed, transfer each clone of interest to one medium-containing well. This should be a well in a 24-well plate with 1 mL of medium to dilute the freezing medium as much as possible. The cells will be sparse initially, which is not a problem.\nChange medium daily and passage as needed on feeders (day 3–7) (troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nOn the day of injection, dissociate cells into a single cell suspension using Trypsin and submit 1–2 clones for injection/aggregation into wild-type embryos (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1948-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

(B) and (C) panels are from (Abuhashem et al., 2022c[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) and permission to reuse were granted.\nNote: The facility performing your mESC injections should provide you with instruction on how to prepare your cells. Typically, maintenance medium with a cell suspension prepared on ice is suitable. However, adding HEPES buffer may be beneficial for cell survival during injection experiments. We typically submit 2 clones for injection into embryos; one heterozygous and one homozygous. Note that homozygotes should be developmentally neutral if the fusion is behaving as your wild-type protein of interest, which is what you expect. Either heterozygous or homozygous would be sufficient to establish a colony. We prefer 8-cell diploid host embryo injections or 8-cell tetraploid host embryo aggregations over blastocyst injections as they produce completely mESC-derived embryos, expediting breeding and establishing a GEM colony (Eakin and Hadjantonakis, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Nagy et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Poueymirou et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nOnce litters are delivered, observe coat color to determine extent of mESC contribution (5 weeks) (troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]).\nOnce sexually mature, initiate mouse breeding with the highest percentage male chimeric mice to the desired genetic background towards generating a homozygous colony of animals (4 months) (troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17]).",
    "Note: Given that the used mESC are typically XY, high percentage chimeras that are female are typically karyotypically abnormal, XO, and often sterile. Unless no viable high contribution males were retrieved, these mice should be avoided.\nValidate homozygosity and heterozygosity of the targeted protein in the colony using immunoblotting (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nNote: In our experience, outbred female mice (e.g., CD1, ICR, or Swiss Webster) are ideal to cross with chimeric males due to their diversified genetics and large litter size, which enable quick and reliable establishment of a GEM colony. Additionally, F1 mice should be screened for any morphological/behavioral abnormalities that may reflect unintended phenotypes of the tagged protein.\nCritical: It is extremely important to have in place an easy and reliable genotyping protocol when establishing a mouse colony to ensure proper maintenance as it can be frustrating to have a GEM model that one cannot genotype.\nOptional: We highly recommend functional validation of the newly generated colony as soon as possible. This can be done by western immunoblotting for the tagged protein from tissues obtained from heterozygous adult mice. Dissection of embryos or isolation of target cell populations in culture can enable dTAG treatment of these tissues in vitro to ensure proper functionality.\nPause point: Once a GEM colony is established, the colony could be maintained as long as desired prior to the initiation experiments. Sperm/embryo cryopreservation is an effective strategy to back up the colony and enable retrieval if needed in the long term.\nIn vivo degradation of the targeted protein\nTiming: 1–3 days",
    "Once a dTAG GEM model is generated, it is possible to expose mice or tissues to dTAG small molecules to induce degradation rapidly and reversibly. In the case of the pre-implantation developmental period or any ex vivo culture of cells or tissues derived from post-implantation embryos or adult mice, dTAG-13 or dTAGv-1 can be added to the culture medium (Abuhashem et al., 2022c[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). For in vivo studies, direct delivery of dTAG-13 or dTAGv-1 can be achieved via simple intraperitoneal injections. In the case of the central nervous system, direct injection (e.g., stereotactic injection into the brain) is required given that neither dTAG-13 nor dTAGv-1 traverse the blood brain barrier.\nDissolve dTAG small molecules in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/25 μL. Aliquot 25 μL per 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 475 μL of 10% Cremophor EL in PBS+/+ (vol/vol) to each 25 μL of dTAG small molecules.\nNote: Other solubilizers such as Kolliphor can be used in place of Cremophor.\nImmediately, pipette up and down until the solution becomes clear.\nNote: dTAG small molecules are poorly water-soluble and will precipitate once 10% Cremophor EL in PBS is added. Continued pipetting ensures quick and complete resuspension of the precipitated dTAG small molecules.\nLoad 500 μL in 1 mL syringe for injection. Inject per animal facility guidelines.\nValidate degradation in tissue of interest using assay of choice, such as immunoblotting or immunostaining.\nIn our experience, a concentration of dTAG-13 or dTAGv-1 of ∼35 mg/kg, is sufficient to induce degradation within ∼4 h in all assayed tissues. However, it is critical to validate and titrate this concentration for one’s protein fusion and tissue of interest (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Intravenous injections can also be performed if higher concentration is needed in tissues and a more acute onset of degradation is desired (troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.19])."
