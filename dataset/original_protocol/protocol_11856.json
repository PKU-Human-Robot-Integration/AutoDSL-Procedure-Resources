    "This protocol was approved by Nationwide Children’s Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nNOTE: The protocol is described in chronological order that spans over the period of two days. Use fresh reagents as described in the protocol below.\n1. Preparation of Reagents on the Day Prior to the Assay\nHydrate the sensor cartridge.\nIncubate 5 mL of the calibrant (Table of Materials) in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator overnight.\nOpen the flux assay kit (Table of Materials) and separate the sensor cartridge (green; top) from the utility plate (transparent; bottom). Next, place the sensor cartridge upside down and adjacent to the utility plate.\nUsing sterile water, fill the wells of the utility plate (200 µL) and the chambers around the wells (400 µL).\nSubmerge the sensor cartridge into the utility plate making sure that the sensors are completely covered by water. Tap 3x to avoid the formation of bubbles.\nPlace the cartridge submerged in the utility plate in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator overnight. To prevent evaporation of the water, make sure that the incubator is properly humidified. Place an open beaker containing H2O as an extra precaution next to the cartridge-utility plate, particularly if using a regular oven.\nPrepare the assay plate.\nSterilize the surface of biosafety cabinet class 2 using 70% ethanol. Open the assay plate under the hood.\nAdd 40 µL of commercially available 0.01% (w/v) poly-L-lysine (PLL) solution to each well of the assay plate under the hood.\nCover the assay plate with the lid provided in the kit. Incubate the closed assay plate at room temperature (RT) under the hood for 1 h.\nNOTE: The goal of the incubation is to let PLL coat the surface of the assay plate to facilitate adhesion of suspension cells to the surface of the assay plate.",
    "After 1 h incubation of the assay plate, remove the excess solution with a sterile vacuum-based aspirator and air dry the well under the hood.\nNOTE: It takes ~30−60 min to air-dry the wells of the assay plate following the excessive PLL removal using the aspirator.\n2. Day of the Assay\nPrepare the cartridge.\nLift the sensor cartridge. Place it upside down in the tissue culture hood and discard the water from the utility plate.\nFill the utility plate wells with 200 μL of the pre-warmed calibrant.\nFill the chambers around the wells with 400 μL of the calibrant.\nSubmerge the sensor cartridge into the utility plate, making sure that the sensors are completely covered by the calibrant. Tap 3x to avoid the formation of bubbles.\nEquilibrate the sensor cartridge submerged in the utility plate in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator for 45−60 min.\nHarvest murine bone marrow-derived LSK HSPCs.\nTo accommodate sufficient biological replicates, plan to use HSPCs derived from one mouse per well of the assay plate.\nNOTE: This bone marrow-harvesting method provides ~50,000−80,000 LSK HSPCs from each mouse. This protocol to measure extracellular flux is optimized for ~70,000 LSK HSPCs per well of a 96 well-plate.\nEuthanize mice using CO2 overdose and cervical dislocation, following local IACUC approved methods.\nSterilize the surface of dissecting tools and the bench using 70% ethanol.\nFor each mouse, pre-fill one Petri dish with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at RT.\nNOTE: Do not use pre-chilled PBS as it will create clumps in the following steps.",
    "Spray 70% ethanol (v/v) on the entire euthanized mouse. Isolate all bones, including upper and lower limbs, hip bones, sternum, rib cage, and spine, from the mouse17,18. Pull out white matter from the spinal cord of the mouse as it can contaminate LSK cells. Place all bones in 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS), as they are being collected, in a Petri dish until further use.\nInvert a 50 mL conical tube (new each time) and use it to triturate bones submerged in 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS) in the Petri dish.\nUsing a 10 mL serological pipette, pipette up and down (~10x) to uniformly flush out cells from bones, after crushing bones.\nPlace a 40 µm cell strainer on a 50 mL conical tube. Pre-wet the surface of the strainer by passing 1 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS).\nHarvest bone marrow-derived cell suspension from step 2.2.7 and pass it through the pre-wet surface of the cell strainer to remove bone debris.\nRepeat steps 2.2.6 through 2.2.9 until all bone materials turn white as a marker that most of bone marrow cells are collected in the 50 mL conical tube.\nNOTE: It often takes two 50 mL conical tubes per mouse to collect all bone marrow-derived cells.\nCentrifuge 50 mL conical tubes containing bone marrow-derived cells for 5 min at 500 x g and RT.\nRemove the supernatant. Resuspend bone marrow-derived cells (combine contents of both 50 mL tubes) in 5 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS) as a final volume and keep cells at RT.\nHarvest mononucleated murine bone marrow cells.",
    "Add 5 mL of density gradient medium (i.e., Ficoll) to a 15 mL conical tube. Then slowly add 5 mL of the bone marrow cell suspension. Make sure that cells remain as a layer above the density gradient medium.\nCentrifuge for 30 min at 500 x g and RT. Do not use a brake in the centrifuge. Make sure the centrifuge is at the lowest possible acceleration (e.g., 1 acceleration and 0 deceleration).\nHarvest the middle interface of mononucleated cells (white color) following centrifugation into a fresh 15 mL conical tube.\nWash cells, harvested from density gradient medium, with 5 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS). Centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g and 4 °C. Remove the supernatant.\nRepeat step 2.3.4.\nResuspend cell contents of the tube in 300 µL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS). Aliquot 10 µL of cell suspension for unstained or single-color control in a FACS tube.\nHarvest LSK HSPCs from mononucleated murine bone marrow cells.\nMake a cocktail of biotin-antibodies by mixing 3 µL per sample of the following antibodies: Gr1, Cd8a, Cd5, B220, Ter119. Add 15 µL of the biotin-antibody cocktail to 300 µL of mononucleated bone marrow cells.\nNOTE: Each antibody is used at 1:100 dilution.\nIncubate cells with the biotin-antibody cocktail for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation to avoid cells clumping in the bottom of the tube.\nAdd 10 mL of pre-chilled 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS) to cells mixed with the biotin-antibody cocktail.\nCentrifuge the tube for 5 min at 500 x g and 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 400 µL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS). Aliquot 10 µL for streptavidin-single color control.",
    "Briefly vortex anti-biotin microbeads (Table of Materials) before use. Add 80 µL of microbeads to each cell sample (of 400 µL). Mix well and incubate for additional 20 min at 4 °C, with agitation.\nAdd 10 mL of pre-chilled 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS) to cells. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 500 x g and 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS). Store at 4 °C while setting up magnetic separation unit.\nPlace a column (Table of Materials) in the magnetic field of the magnetic assisted cell sorting (MACS) separator at 4 °C. Prepare the column for magnetic separation by rinsing it with 3 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS) under the gravity flow at 4 °C.\nAdd the cell suspension from step 2.4.7 to the pre-wet column at 4 °C. Allow the cells to pass through the column at 4 °C and collect effluent in a 15 mL conical tube.\nNOTE: The fraction with unlabeled cells in such effluent represents the enriched lineage negative cells.\nWash column with 3 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS) at 4 °C. Repeat 3x. Collect the flow-through and keep it at 4 °C. Count the eluted viable cells by trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL conical tube containing the flow-through for 5 min at 500 x g and 4 °C. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend cells in 0.5 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS) and transfer the contents to a FACS tube.\nAdd 24 µL of the LSK antibody cocktail to each 107 cells. The antibody cocktail contains equal concentration of 450-streptavidin antibody, PE-CY7-Sca1 antibody, and APC-c-Kit antibody.\nIncubate for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation under dark (covered with tin foil).",
    "Add 3 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS) to the FACS tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g and 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend antibody-labelled cells in 1 mL of 1x PBS (+ 2% FBS).
