    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBacteria growth\nTiming: 1 day\nDay 1.\nThese steps describe how to prepare and grow bacteria for mice infection.\nPrepare sterile Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB).\nScrape a portion of frozen bacteria from the S. aureus stock vial using a sterile p200 pipette tip and drop it in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of TSB.\nLoosely cover the flask and incubate under shaking at 37°C overnight (O.N.).\nAdd 5 mL of the O.N. grown culture in a 1L Erlenmeyer flask containing 250 mL of TSB.\nAdd 1 mL of bacteria culture in a cuvette and record the initial optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer (time zero), then incubate the flask under shaking at 37°C.\nAt 30 min intervals, remove 1 mL of the S. aureus suspension and measure its OD600 until this value is 0.4, corresponding to 3∗10ˆ7 CFU/mL in exponential phase.\nCritical: Accurately determining the concentration of bacteria in the final culture is crucial for the success of the experiments. To achieve this, we recommend using an empirical method to estimate the appropriate OD600 value, which corresponds to 3∗10ˆ7 CFU/mL. This involves creating a growth curve by collecting samples of the growing bacteria at different time points, measuring their OD600, and then plating them on agar dishes overnight at 37°C to count the resulting colonies the following day.\nMice infection\nTiming: 10 mins per mouse\nDay 2.\nThese steps describe how to intratracheally instill S. aureus into murine lungs.\nCentrifuge S. aureus culture at 4000× g for 10 min and wash twice with PBS. Resuspend at 8∗10ˆ8 CFU/mL with saline.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with 2–4% isoflurane accordingly to the procedure approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Wait until the animal does not move voluntarily and the breathing rate becomes slow.\nArrange the mouse onto an intubation stand.\nCarefully pull out the tongue with tweezers and instill 80 μL of bacteria suspension (6.4∗10ˆ7 CFU/mouse) with a p200 pipette directly into the mouth.\nWhile keeping the tongue gently pulled, wait until the mouse swallows and the liquid cannot be seen in the mouth anymore.\nPlace the mouse back in the cage and wait until complete recovery.\nNote: If the instillation has been properly done, the mouse will be gasping during the recovery from the anesthesia.\nCritical: The outcome of the experiment is greatly impacted by the quantity of bacteria used. It is therefore recommended to confirm the bacterial count by plating a sample of the cell suspension utilized to infect the mice onto agar dishes and incubating it overnight at 37°C. The following day, confirm the number of CFU used during the experiment.\nBALF isolation\nTiming: 20 mins per mouse\nDay 3.\nThese steps describe how to obtain the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in mice.\n24 h after infection, euthanize one mouse at a time according to the procedure approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nPlace the mouse in a prone position and remove all skin from the lower part of the thorax up to the neck using tools sterilized with 70% EtOH.\nExpose the trachea by removing all muscles and tissue around it, without damaging or cutting the trachea itself. Put a small pipette tip behind it to better expose the trachea.\nCarefully open the thorax to display the lungs and cut the diaphragm.",
    "Note: Having an open thorax allows the visualization of the inflation of the lungs, while cutting the diaphragm facilitate the inflation process.\nCut halfway the trachea with a razor blade and insert the intradermic tube.\nInflate the lungs by injecting 1 mL of PBS through the tube with a syringe.\nAspirate with the syringe to recollect the PBS in a FACS tube. Keep on ice.\nNote: If the lungs are too small, it is possible to lose some PBS. To avoid losing any material, stop inflating the lungs once they reach full capacity and do not expand anymore.\nRepeat steps 18–19 twice and collect a total amount of 3 mL of PBS per single mouse.\nNote: Record the exact amount of PBS that was recovered in order to normalize the data at the end of protocol.\nCritical: It is particularly important to euthanize the mouse right before the procedure to avoid any rigor mortis.\nCitH3 staining for flow cytometry\nTiming: 4 h\nDay 3.\nThis section describes steps for the flow cytometry staining of citrullinated histone H3 in neutrophils from BALF.\nCentrifuge the cells into the FACS tubes at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 μL of staining mix. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature and protect from light.\nNote: Supernatant can also be conserved and tested for cytokines or other parameter of NETs formation via ELISA kits. We successfully measured the quantity of Citrullinated histone H3 (Cayman, cat#501620) and quantity of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes by using a modified Cell Death Detection ELISA (Roche, cat#11544675001) and we found a positive correlation with the percentage of neutrophil positive for citrullinated histone H3 via flow cytometry.",
    "Note: It is possible to determine lung permeability and damage by measuring albumin concentration in the BALF by ELISA. We successfully quantify albumin in the supernatant of the samples with Albumin Assay kit (Abcam, cat# ab235628).\nNote: At this step it is possible to add antibody for staining of other cell populations of interest.\nWash the excess of antibody and fix the samples by adding 2 mL of staining buffer and centrifuge the cells at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat step 23.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL of staining buffer containing TruStain fcX (1:100 dilution), to avoid the aspecific binding of the anti-citrullinated histone H3 antibody primary antibody. Incubate 30 min at 4°C.\nWash the excess by repeating two times step 23.\nStain with primary antibody. Add 100 μL of staining buffer containing anti-citrullinated histone H3 antibody (1:400 dilution). Incubate 1 h at room temperature protected from light.\nWash the excess of antibody by adding 2 mL of staining buffer and centrifuge the cells at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature.\nStain with secondary antibody. Add 100 μL of staining buffer containing anti-rabbit Alexa 568 antibody. (1:500 dilution). Incubate 30 min at room temperature protected from light.\nNote: Use a secondary antibody with a bright fluorochrome or the signal could be too faint and could be hard to distinguish positive from negative events.\nWash the excess of antibody by adding 2 mL of staining buffer and centrifuge the cells at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 2 mL of PBS. Centrifuge the cells at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the cells in 300 μL of PBS.\nAdd 15 μL of CountBright™ Absolute Counting Beads.",
    "Acquire the samples with BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer and measure the percentage of neutrophils positive for citrullinated histone H3.\nNote: If the BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer is not available, any other flow cytometer with appropriate lasers and filters can be used.\nAnalyze the data with FlowJo (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section for more information).\nPause point: Depending on the type of stimulation and the number of mice, the duration of the protocol may vary. We suggest pausing the protocol after step 24. At this point the samples can be stored at 4°C overnight in staining buffer."
