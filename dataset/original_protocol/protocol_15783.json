    "1. Preparation of Recombinant Virus Suitable for Large Scale Expression of IKK1/α\nP1 virus preparation32\nDay 1: Plate Sf9 cells (~6 X 105) (passage number less than 10) in 2 mL of Sf900 III insect cell medium in each well of a 6-well plate and incubate at 27 °C. Passage cells when they reach a density of 2 to 3 X 106 cells per mL in suspension by diluting into fresh media at a density of ~6 X 105.\nDay 2: Dilute 8 µL of Sf9-transfection reagent in 100 µL of Sf900 III or Grace's Insect Medium without antibiotic and serum.

Add 1 mL of fresh medium without antibiotic and serum.\nAdd the diluted DNA-transfection reagent mixture dropwise onto the cells. Adjust the drop size such that it does not dislodge adherent cells.\nAfter ~6 h, add 1.5 mL of fresh medium on top or remove the medium and add 2.5 mL of fresh medium. Warm fresh medium to 25-27 °C before addition.\nIncubate the cells at 27 °C. Check the wells periodically every ~12 h for signs of viral infection. Carry out all Sf9 maintenance and expression at 27 °C.\nDay 5: Take out the medium containing cells 60-72 h post infection. Centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g and 4 °C. Save the supernatant; this is the P1-virus stock. Freeze small aliquots at -80 °C.\nSelecting the best expressing P1 virus clone.\nPlate cells similarly as described in step 1.1.",

Save the supernatant. This is the P2 virus stock. Store small aliquots of the stock at -80 °C.\nAdd 100 µL of 2x Laemmli SDS buffer to the harvested cell pellet. Heat at >95 °C for 10 min. Centrifuge (typically > 10,000 x g) for 5 min.\nRun 10-15 µL of each sample on 8-10% SDS-PAGE at 120-160 V till the dye front reaches bottom of the gel.\nElectro-transfer the resolved proteins by standard semi-dry transfer protocol (20 V, 30-45 min) on a Nitrocellulose/PVDF membrane.\nBlot with anti-IKK1 antibody (dilution ~1:2,000, must be optimized) or anti-PentaHis antibody (dilution ~1:3,000, must be optimized) for expression.\nChoose the best P1 virus clone by comparing expression of recombinant IKK1.\nPreparation of large scale P3 virus stock.\nPlate cells similarly as described in step 1.1 in a 15 cm plate containing 25-30 mL of Sf900 III medium.\n~6 h post plating, add 150-300 µL of the best-expressing P1 virus stock onto the cells.\nAfter 72 h post infection, aspirate the medium carefully from the plate in a suitable tube (sterile), and centrifuge the tube at 500-1000 X g for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard the cell pellet (if one is formed) and save the supernatant. This is P3 virus stock.\nDetermining the optimum virus titre for large scale protein expression\nPlate cells in 2 mL of Sf900 III medium, as described in 1.1, in a 6-well plate.",
    "Add 20, 30, 40, and 50 µL of P3 virus stock in separate wells ~6 h post plating. Include an uninfected control.\nHarvest cells from each well 48-60 h post infection.\nAdd 100 µL of 2X Laemmli SDS buffer. Heat at >95 °C for 10 min.

Large Scale Expression of 6x-His Tagged Human IKK129,33\nCarry out large scale expression in a suspension culture. Split cells in 1 L of Sf900 III medium in a 2 L Erlenmeyer Flask with a vented cap. The cell density should be ~5x105 cells/mL.\nGrow these cells in suspension at ~100 rpm at 27 °C in a shaker for ~2 days until it reaches a density of 1-2x106/mL. Cell density must not exceed 2x106/mL.\nAdd the desired amount of P3 virus, as assessed in 1.4.\nGrow the infected culture for 48-60 h at ~100 rpm at 27 °C in a shaker.\nHarvest cells by centrifugation at <1,500 x g at 4 °C.\nSave the cell pellet and discard the medium.\nProceed to protein purification directly. Flash freeze the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C for future use.\n3. Purification of His-IKK133\nOn day 1, resuspend the cell pellet in 40 mL of Lysis Buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.2% NP-40, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10% Glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor cocktail).",
    "NOTE: The wet cell pellet mass was not determined. Typically, ~2 L of culture was used for this step.\nLyse the cells by sonication at 60-70% duty cycles, 5-10 pulses of 30 s duration at an interval of >1 min, keeping the cell suspension chilled on ice.\n\tNOTE: This step requires optimization with each model of sonicator. Do not let the sample warm up above 10 °C.\nClarify the lysate by centrifugation at ≥ 28,000 x g for 45 min at 4 °C.\nEquilibrate 4 mL of Ni-NTA Agarose resin with lysis buffer, and mix the clarified lysate (supernatant) following the manufacturer's protocol.\nAllow the protein to bind the resin by incubating for 2 h on a rotary mixer in a 4 °C room.\nWash the resin thoroughly with the lysis buffer containing 30 mM imidazole. Check protein concentration in the wash fraction periodically using Bradford Assay. Wash until this protein concentration in the wash fraction reaches 0.1 mg/mL. Typically > 20 bed volume of wash buffer is required to reach this point.\nElute His-tagged IKK1/α protein under gravity flow, using 20 mL of elution buffer (the lysis buffer containing 250 mM imidazole). Collect 1-1.5 mL fractions.\nCheck the purity of eluted protein on an 8 or 10% SDS PAGE gel by loading 5-10 μL of sample from all fractions mixed with Laemmli buffer.\nPool peak fractions (concentration ≥ 2mg/mL), and measure protein concentration using the Bradford assay.\nDigest with TEV (1:30-50 (TEV protease:IKK1)) protease overnight (≥12 h) at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Optimize the amount of TEV protease required for complete (≥ 95%) digestion of the 6X-His tag a priori. TEV protease was purified in house.",
    "On the morning of day 2, incubate the protein with 1 mM ATP in the presence of 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate for 1 h at 27 °C.\nFilter the protein solution through a 0.45 or 0.22 μm filter.\nLoad 6 mL of the sample onto a ~120 mL preparative size-exclusion column attached to an automated liquid chromatography system. Equilibrate the column with Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 5% Glycerol), prior to applying the protein sample.\n\tNOTE: A smaller column could be used depending on the yield of protein after the Ni-NTA affinity purification step. Adjust/calculate load volume to be 5% of column volume).\nRun the size-exclusion chromatography at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and monitor elution at 280 and 254 nm. Collect fractions of 2 mL size.\nCheck purity of the peak fractions (typically around ~60-70 mL) on an 8-10% SDS-PAGE gel.\nPool the pure fractions (purity ≥95% with a concentration of ≥0.5 mg/mL) and concentrate in a 10 kDa or 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off centrifugal protein concentrator following the manufacturer's instructions.\nPeriodically check protein concentration of the concentrate by the Bradford method, and concentrate the sample up to 8-12 mg/mL.\nDispense 25 μL aliquots and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store these flash frozen samples in the -80 °C freezer.\n4. Screen for Crystallization Condition of IKK1\nCalculate the total amount (by volume) of protein required to screen for crystals following the methods described below.",
    "Try different inhibitors (generic kinase inhibitors: AMPPNP, and Staurosporine; IKK-specific inhibitors: MLN120B, Compound A, and IKK-inhibitor XII) to perform screening for crystallization. Make stock solutions of these compounds following the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure that the maximum concentration of the compound in its stock solution does not exceed 20 μM.\nPrepare the IKK:inhibitor complex for the crystallization screen by mixing 100 μM of IKK1 with 200 μM inhibitor, and incubate at 18-20 °C for 30-40 min. Centrifuge this mixture at >15,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature. Save the supernatant for crystallization screen.\nUse the commercially available crystallization screens (see the Table of Materials).\nPipette 80-100 μL of each crystallization reagent (reservoir solutions), using a multichannel pipette or a robot, into the reservoir of a 96-well plate. The plate is now ready to set up drops. Ensure that the plate accommodates 2 to 3 crystallization drops so that 2 to 3 inhibitors can be screened in a single plate.\nUsing a crystallization robot, dispense and mix 0.2–0.25 μL of IKK1:inhibitor complex with the same volume of reservoir solution.\n\tNOTE: Screening can be performed manually using larger drop volumes (0.5-1.0 μL of IKK1:inhibitor complex with the same volume of reservoir solution). However, use of a robot would help save valuable reagents.\nSeal the plates immediately after setting the drops with optically clear films to avoid evaporation. Seal properly using appropriate applicator. Make replica plates for each inhibitor set. Incubate one plate at 18 °C, and the other in the cold room (temperature range ~4–6 °C). Make sure that incubators are not affected by vibration.\nUse a stereomicroscope with a polarizer to check for appearance of crystals in each drop every day for the first seven days, and then at longer intervals. Systematically note and score these observations.",
    "NOTE: Use a stereomicroscope with a polarizer so that the growth defects in crystals can be visually assessed. Here, crystals appeared in a condition where the reservoir solution contained 3% w/v Dextran sulfate sodium salt Mr 5,000, 0.1 M BICINE pH 8.5, 15 % w/v Polyethylene glycol 20,000. Crystals of IKK1 grew only in the presence of IKK-inhibitor XII.\n5. Crystal Growth Optimization29,33\nPreparation of stock solutions.\nPrepare 30% w/v solutions of Dextran sulfate of different molecular weight (Avg. MW 5,000, 8,000, 15,000, 40,000 Da) in deionized H2O. Filter solution using 0.22 μm filters.\nPrepare 1 M or 0.5 M stocks of different buffers in the pH range of 6.5 to 9. Filter solutions using 0.22 μm filters.\nPrepare 25% or 50% (w/v) PEG solutions of different molecular weight (Avg. MW:1000, 1,500, 3,350, 4,000, 6,000, 8,000, 10,000, 12,000, 20,000 Da). Filter solutions using 0.22 μm filters.\nPerform a grid screen by systematically varying pH, buffer type, concentration, and type of both PEG and Dextran Sulfate.\nOptimize screening both at 18 °C, and in the cold room (temperature range ~4-6 °C).\nMix an equal amount of the IKK1:Inhibitor complex with well solution and incubate over the well solution in a sealed environment. This step can be performed manually or using a dispensing robot.\n\tNOTE: Here, the largest and well-defined crystals (as assessed by uniform color under the polarizer which indicated uniform growth) were obtained under the following conditions: 100 mM BisTris pH 7.0, 2.8-3.5% of Dextran Sulfate (average MW 15 kDa), 8.5-10% PEG 20 kDa in the cold room.\n6. Growing Crystals in Large Numbers\nPrepare the following stock solutions and filter them through 0.22 μm filter.\nPrepare 0.5M BisTris pH 7.0, and BisTris propane pH 7.0 and 7.5.",
    "Prepare 30% (w/v) Dextran Sulfate (Average MW ~15 kDa). Store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 50% PEG (Average MW ~12 kDa).\nUse 24 well hanging drop plates.\nApply sealant grease on the raised rings of each well.\nPrepare the well solution as follows (final concentration): 100 mM BisTris pH 7.0–7.5, 2.8–3.5% Dextran Sulfate ~15 kDa, 8.5–10% PEG ~12 kDa. Prepare 1 mL well solution in 1.5 mL tubes.\n\tNOTE: A minor variation in crystallization condition was observed depending upon the batch of protein, and/or Dextran Sulfate, thus a trial of a narrow range is recommended. Both BisTris and BisTris propane buffers of the same pH range yield single crystals.\nKeep the well solutions and greased plates in the cold room for at least 1 h.\nPrepare IKK1:Inhibitor complex as described in 4.3. Transfer the well solutions from 1.5 mL tubes to the individual wells of the 24 well plate.\nClean siliconized (commercial or in-house (siliconization/silanization)) glass cover slips using lint-free wipes and apply high pressure pinpointed air jets using commercially available aerosol duster.\nPlace 1–1.5 μL of well solution on a clean cover slip. Pipette equal volume of IKK1:inhibitor complex, mix gently by pipetting up and down 3-4 times. Turn the glass cover slip and place on the respective well with forceps and seal the well by pressing on the grease.\nAfter setting up all the drops of a 24-well plate, incubate the plate in the cold room in the dark. Occasionally check the drops under a microscope for appearance and growth of crystals.\n\tNOTE: It has not been tested whether incubating crystal plates under the light would change the outcome. It is critical, however, that the plates are incubated in an environment with minimum/no vibration.\n7. Cryo Protection of Crystals\nPreparation of cryo solutions.",
    "Prepare Cryo A (~2% Dextran Sulfate, ~10% PEG 12000, 60 mM BisTris propane (of the same pH as the intended well solution), 5 mM Tris pH 7.5, 40-50 mM NaCl, 2.5% Glycerol).\nPrepare Cryo B (~0.3% Dextran Sulfate, ~10% PEG 12000, 60 mM BisTris propane (of the same pH as the intended well solution), 5 mM Tris pH 7.5, 40-50 mM NaCl, 20 or 25% Glycerol or 20 or 25% Ethylene Glycol).\n\t\tNOTE: Test different cryo-protectants in addition to Glycerol and Ethylene Glycol (e.g., PEG 200, PEG 400, PEG MME 550, PEG 1000).\nGently remove the glass cover slip containing the crystal and place it onto a solid surface with the crystal drop facing upwards. Gently add 10 μL of Cryo A solution on top of the drop, and gently mix by pipetting so that the crystal is not touched.\n\tNOTE: This cleans the crystal surface of debris and help equilibrate the crystal with the initial cryo buffer. Avoid mechanical and thermal stress to the crystal. Perform all the subsequent steps under the microscope to avoid any damage to the crystal.\nSlowly remove some liquid from the crystal and keep about 5-8 μL of the solution. Avoid dehydration of the crystal. Take extreme care to avoid mechanical stress and dehydration of the crystal in all the subsequent steps.\nGently add 2.5–4 μL of the Cryo B solution onto the drop, mix very gently by pipetting. Cover with a small Petri dish to avoid direct air flow over the crystal. Wait for 5 min. Always be careful the crystal does not suffer rapid changes of osmotic pressure or dehydration.\nRepeat step 7.4 four times to slowly acclimatize the crystal into the cryo solution.",
    "Keep 10–20 μL of the cryo solution at this stage (i.e., allow the crystal to be bathed in about 20–25% cryo-protectant containing solution). Soak for different periods of time (5 min to 1 h) in the final cryo-solution.\nFreeze multiple crystals at different time-points.\nCarefully pick a single crystal from the drop in an appropriate cryo-loop mounted on a proper base and plunge-freeze in liquid N2. Perform this step smoothly and quickly to avoid ice formation on the crystal.\n\tNOTE: Pick the crystal using a loop diameter slightly larger than the longest axis of the crystal so that it can be mounted in the robotic goniometer used in Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.\nStore the crystal containing cryo-loops in pucks immersed in liquid N2. Store these pucks in liquid N2 Dewar flask until they are ready for shipment for X-ray diffraction at the synchrotron. Proceed to X-ray diffraction data collection and processing (sections 8 and 9).\n\tNOTE: Diffraction data of IKK1 crystals from home X-ray sources were not of high enough resolution for structure determination trials, although it indicated the quality of crystals to be screened at the synchrotron. All diffraction data were collected at different beamlines (primarily 19ID) of the Advance Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, USA.\n8. X-ray Data Collection\nCollect X-ray diffraction data at the ID19 beamline of the APS synchrotron source, using remote data collection software34.",
    "NOTE: Upwards of 100 crystals were tested for their diffraction properties. The crystals routinely diffracted to a resolution of 7-11 Å, only rarely crystals that diffracted to beyond 5 Å were observed, and only one large crystal diffracted beyond 4.5 Å. Since the crystals decayed rapidly during the data collection, datasets at different parts of the same crystal were collected. This was possible since the crystals were large (larger than 400 µm), and the beam diameter used was 100 µm.\n9. X-ray Data Processing\nMerge all datasets collected on different parts of the same crystal34.\n\tNOTE: seven datasets were merged from the best crystal and the resultant data was 93% complete. The overall I/σ was ~6.8) and Rmerge was 89% in the highest resolution bin (5.4-4.5 Å).\nProcess datasets with HKL200034 to obtain space group, unit cell dimensions, solvent content, and plausible composition of the asymmetric unit.\n10. Structure Solution\nPreparation of search models\nBased on available structural models of hIKK2 (pdb id 4E3C and 4KIK35), generate a series of dimers with different orientations of the N-terminal KD (that renders an opening of 30 and 62 Å, between P578 of two KD in the dimer). None of these models fetched a molecular replacement search solution after extensive trials.\nGenerate a map of IKK1 from single-particle cryo-EM data33.\nGenerate a model of human IKK1 from the highest resolution structure of IKK2 (pdb id 4KIK).\nDock the individual domains of the human IKK1 model into the cryo EM density map of human IKK1 using COOT36. This rotated the KD orientation about 24 degrees and modified the N-terminal opening to ~58 Å.\nApply the KD orientation of the cryo-EM fitted model (the monomer) to all dimers generated in 10.1.1.\nMolecular replacement",
    "Use dimers from 10.1.1 and 10.1.5 as search models in programs PHASER37, MOLREP38 and CNS39,40.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, using one of the dimers from 10.1.5 (52 Å opening) as a search model, six dimers (two hexamers) were located in the asymmetric unit by using MOLREP. The 52 Å opening in the search model is similar to the 49-50 Å opening of the dimers (all six dimers) in the refined structure.\n11. Structure Refinement\nStructure refinement procedure\nFix the orientation and position of this initial model by rigid body refinement in CNS (cns_solve_1.3)39,40.\nRefine the structure further using minimization and simulated annealing with a maximum likelihood target function and a flat bulk-solvent correction using the CNS system39,40.\nBuild the model based on 2FO-FC and Fo-Fc maps using Xtalview41.\n\t\tNOTE: Apply DEN-assisted refinement42 and NCS restrain during the refinements for better accuracy of the model. Indeed, DEN refinement dramatically improved geometries and R-factors of the structure, and the R factor was 22.2% and free R factor was 27.8% for the final model. The dramatic improvement of the R free must be due to the high accuracy model of IKK1 domains that were generated from the IKK2 model (4KIK).\nSubscription Required.
