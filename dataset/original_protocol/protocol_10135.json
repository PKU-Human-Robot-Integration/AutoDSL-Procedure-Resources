    "All procedures performed on vertebrate animal subjects were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Harvard University.\n1. Fabrication of Mesh Electronics\nNOTE: The procedure described in this section is intended for use inside a standard university clean room facility, such as the Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS) at Harvard University. This facility as well as similar facilities are accessible to outside users around the United States, for example, as part of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). In these facilities, many of the tools, equipment, and materials described in this section are provided along with access to the clean room facility and would not require separate purchase.\nCAUTION: Many of the chemicals used in the fabrication of mesh electronics are hazardous, including resists, CD-26, remover PG, SU-8 developer, and Ni etching solution. Consult the materials safety data sheets (MSDS) for these chemicals before use and implement and follow appropriate safety measures at all times.\nThermally evaporate 100 nm of Ni onto a clean Si wafer.\n\tNOTE: Typical deposition parameters are base pressure of 5 x 10-7 T and rate of 1–2 Å/s. The thin layer of Ni serves as a sacrificial layer that will later be dissolved to release mesh electronics from the wafer.\nUse the first PL mask (PL mask-1) to define the bottom passivating layer of mesh electronics with SU-8 negative photoresist (Figure 2A).",
    "NOTE: PL is a standard microfabrication technique in which ultraviolet (UV) light is shined onto a mask held over a photosensitive substrate. Light either makes insoluble (negative resists) or soluble (positive resists) the exposed areas on the substrate. The masks are drawn in computer aided design (CAD) software and then typically ordered from a vendor. A mask aligner is used to align masks to existing patterns on a substrate and expose them to UV light. Fabrication of mesh electronics requires four different masks (PL mask-1 through PL mask-4). Our mask designs are available by request or from the resource site, meshelectronics.org.\n\t\nSpin-coat SU-8 2000.5 negative photoresist onto the wafer at 4,000 rpm for an approximate SU-8 thickness of 400–500 nm.\nSoft bake the wafer on a hotplate for 1 min at 65 °C followed by 1 min at 95 °C.\nLoad the wafer into a mask aligner to expose the SU-8 with PL mask-1 corresponding to the bottom mesh SU-8 layer. Expose at an i-line (365 nm wavelength) dose of 100 mJ/cm2.\nPost bake the wafer on a hotplate for 1 min at 65 °C followed by 1 min at 95 °C.\nImmerse the wafer in a tray of SU-8 developer. Gently agitate the solution for 2 min until the mesh pattern in the SU-8 has been fully developed. Rinse in a tray of isopropyl alcohol for 1 min and blow dry.\nHard bake the wafer on a hotplate at 180 °C for 1 h.",
    "NOTE: SU-8 is normally hard baked between 150 °C and 250 °C following development. The hard bake anneals any surface cracks that may form during development and further crosslinks the SU-8 to ensure mechanical stability. Hard baking at 180 °C for the bottom SU-8 layer and 190 °C for the top SU-8 layer yields good results for mesh electronics.\nUse PL mask-2 to define metal interconnects and I/O pads (Figure 2B).\nSpin-coat LOR3A onto the wafer at 4000 rpm for an approximate thickness of 300 nm.\n\t\tNOTE: LOR3A is a polydimethylglutarimide-based resist which speeds undercutting during the subsequent metallization procedure.\nBake the wafer on a hotplate at 180 °C for 5 min.\nSpin-coat S1805 positive photoresist at 4000 rpm for an approximate thickness of 500 nm.\nBake the wafer on a hotplate at 115 °C for 1 min.\nLoad the wafer into a mask aligner to expose the S1805 with PL mask-2 corresponding to the metal interconnects and I/O pads. Expose at a h-line (405 nm wavelength) dose of 40 mJ/cm2.\nImmerse the wafer in a tray of CD-26 photoresist developer. Gently agitate the solution for 1 min until the metal interconnects pattern has been fully developed. Rinse in a tray of deionized water (DI) for 1 min and blow dry.\nThermally evaporate 3 nm of Cr followed by 80 nm of Au.\n\t\tNOTE: A base pressure of at most 5 x 10-7 T and deposition rate of 1 Å/s typically yield the best film quality.\nImmerse the wafer into a flat beaker of remover PG for approximately 3 h until the metal has fully undercut, leaving the metal only in the desired interconnect and I/O pad regions of mesh electronics. Rinse in isopropyl alcohol and blow dry.\nUse PL mask-3 to define Pt electrodes (Figure 2C).",
    "Repeat steps 1.3.1 through 1.3.4.\nLoad the wafer into the mask aligner to expose the S1805 with PL mask-3 corresponding to the Pt electrodes. Expose at a h-line dose of 40 mJ/cm2.\nImmerse the wafer in a tray of CD-26 photoresist developer. Gently agitate the solution for 1 min until the Pt electrodes pattern has been fully developed. Rinse in a tray of DI for 1 min and blow dry.\nUse an electron beam evaporator to deposit 3 nm of Cr followed by 50 nm of Pt.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical deposition parameters are a base pressure of 5 x 10-7 T and rate of 2 Å/s.\nImmerse the wafer into a flat beaker of remover PG for approximately 3 h until the metal has fully undercut, leaving Pt only at the desired electrode sites of mesh electronics. Rinse in isopropyl alcohol and blow dry.\nUse PL mask-4 to define the top passivating layer of mesh electronics with SU-8 negative photoresist (Figure 2D).\nRepeat steps 1.2.1 through 1.2.5, except exposing with PL mask-4 corresponding to the top passivating mesh layer of SU-8.\nHard bake the wafer on a hotplate at 190 °C for 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: This temperature is 10 °C higher than that for the hard bake of the bottom SU-8 (step 1.2.6). This elevated temperature slightly reflows the bottom SU-8, causing it to merge with the top SU-8 layer and thus form a single, continuous SU-8 structure.\nMesh electronics are now complete (Figure 2E and Figure 3); release them from the Si wafer by dissolving the Ni sacrificial layer.\nTreat the wafer with oxygen plasma at 50 W for 1 min. This oxidizes the SU-8 surface, making it hydrophilic and allowing the mesh to be readily suspended in aqueous solution.",
    "In a flat beaker, combine hydrochloric acid, ferric chloride, and DI at a volumetric ratio of 1:1:20, respectively, to make a solution of Ni etchant.\nImmerse the wafer into a flat beaker of the Ni etchant solution for approximately 3 h until the mesh electronics have completely been released from the Si wafer.\nUse a Pasteur pipette to transfer the released mesh electronics probes from Ni etchant to a 100 mL beaker of DI. Transfer the mesh electronics to a fresh beaker of DI at least 3 times to ensure rinsing.\nUse a Pasteur pipette to transfer the mesh electronics to a 70%/30% ethanol/water solution for disinfection, then use the pipette to transfer the mesh electronics to sterile water for rinsing.\n\t\tNOTE: After sterilization, the mesh electronics can be transferred to other solutions for functionalization. For example, to promote cellular adhesion, the mesh electronics can be transferred to an aqueous solution of poly-D-lysine (1 mg/mL) for 24 h.\nUse a Pasteur pipette to transfer the mesh electronics probes to a 100 mL beaker of sterile 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to injection in vivo.\n2. Loading of Mesh Electronics into Needles\nThe pipette holder as-purchased is open to flow at both ends. Seal the end opposite the circular screw fastener with epoxy, so there is no leakage during injection (Figure 4A). Let the epoxy harden before proceeding.\nInsert a glass capillary needle into the pipette holder. Fasten it in place using the circular tightening screw and cone washer (Figure 4B). A 400 µm inner diameter (650 µm outer diameter) glass capillary needle was used for this protocol. Other capillary needle materials (e.g., metal) and diameters may be used but might require changes to the design of mesh electronics to ensure injectability.",
    "NOTE: Capillary needles ranging from 150 µm to 1.17 mm inner diameter (250 µm to 1.5 mm outer diameter) have been used in our laboratory. Injection through smaller needles can be promoted by making the angle of intersection between the transverse and longitudinal SU-8 mesh elements more acute, decreasing the width of the SU-8 mesh elements, using thinner SU-8, and using a coarser (i.e., larger unit cell) mesh structure. Photomasks for meshes designed for smaller capillary needles are available by request or from the resource site, meshelectronics.org. Glass capillary needles with an inner diameter of 400 µm and outer diameter of 550 µm are also available commercially. These reduce the acute tissue damage caused by injection while maintaining compatibility with meshes requiring a 400-µm inner diameter, but they were not used for the studies described here.\nAttach a 1 mL syringe to the side outlet of the pipette holder using a 2–4 cm length of capillary tubing.\nInsert the glass capillary needle into the 100-mL beaker of PBS containing the mesh electronics. Position the end of the needle near the I/O pads of a mesh electronics probe and manually retract the syringe to draw a mesh electronics probe into the needle (Figure 5 and Supplementary Video 1).\n\tNOTE: The I/O pads, stem interconnect region, and mesh device region are easily identifiable by naked eye when the mesh electronics probes are suspended in solution. This enables unambiguous loading of mesh electronics into the needles with the correct orientation.\nPush/pull the syringe plunger while still immersed in saline to adjust the position of mesh electronics within the needle.",
    "NOTE: Ideal positioning is with the ultraflexible mesh device region as near to the end of the needle as possible. This configuration minimizes the volume of fluid that will be injected into the brain while guaranteeing the device region is injected first and the I/O pads last.\nCarefully detach the capillary tubing from the side outlet of the pipette holder. Detach it slowly to avoid creating a suction force that could alter the position of the mesh electronics within the needle.\n3. Stereotaxic Injection of Mesh Electronics into Live Mouse Brain",
    "NOTE: Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a mixture of 75 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg dexdomitor. The degree of anesthesia was verified with the toe pinch method prior to beginning surgery. Body temperature was maintained by placing the mouse on a 37 °C homeothermic blanket while under anesthesia. Proper sterile technique was implemented for the surgery, including but not limited to autoclaving all metal surgical instruments for 1 h prior to use, using sterilized gloves, using a hot bead sterilizer throughout the surgery, the maintenance of a sterile field around the surgical site, the disinfection of plastic instruments with 70% ethanol, and the depilated scalp skin was prepped with iodophor prior to incision. For survival surgeries, after the conclusion of the surgery, antiobiotic ointment was applied around the wound, and the mouse was returned to a cage equipped with a 37 °C heating pad. Mice were not left unattended until they had regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Mice were given buprenorphine analgesia via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight every 12 h for up to 72 h following the surgery. Mice were isolated from other animals following surgery. Mice were euthanized via either intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital at a dose of 270 mg/kg body weight or via transcardial perfusion (see step 6.1). Investigators may refer to Geiger, et al.30, Kirby, et al.31, and Gage, et al.32 for details on rodent stereotaxic surgery.\nAnesthetize the mouse and fix it in a stereotaxic frame.\nApply ocular lubricant to the mouse's eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nUse a dental drill and stereotaxic frame to open a craniotomy at the desired coordinates on the skull. Open a second craniotomy away from the injection site for the insertion of a stainless-steel grounding screw or wire.",
    "Fix a clamping substrate to the skull with dental cement. Cut an approximately 1-mm wide gap in the substrate to improve the reliability of the folding step later in the procedure.\n\tNOTE: A flat flexible cable (FFC) cut to a \"L\" shape works well (Figure 7A), although many materials would work as long as they are of the correct thickness for the 32-channel zero insertion force (ZIF) connector (designed for 0.18 ± 0.05 mm thick cables).\nMount the pipette holder with the needle containing mesh electronics onto the stereotaxic frame using a right-angle end clamp (Figure 4C and Figure 6A).\nAttach the side outlet of the pipette holder to a 5 mL syringe fastened in a syringe pump (Figure 6D) using an approximately 0.5–1 m length of capillary tubing.\n\tNOTE: Ensure there are no bubbles in the capillary tubing before connecting it to the pipette holder. Bubbles can interrupt the flow during injection and prevent a smooth, controlled delivery of mesh electronics.\nUse the stereotaxic frame to position the tip of the needle at the desired starting location within the brain.\n\tNOTE: The mesh electronics probes used here are designed with recording electrodes spread over a length of ca. 2 mm and with the first electrode located ca. 0.5 mm from the starting edge of the mesh electronics (left-most edge in Figure 3A). For this reason, the stereotaxic coordinates should be selected such that the starting location is 0.5 mm deeper than the brain region of interest. The spread and location of the recording electrodes within mesh electronics can be selected freely during the mask design process and should be selected so the recording electrodes span the brain region(s) of interest as they are injected along their stereotaxic trajectory.",
    "Position the camera (Figure 6B) to display the top of the mesh electronics probe within the glass needle. Some software allows the user to draw a line on the screen to mark the original position of the mesh electronics.\nInitiate the flow by setting the syringe pump to a low speed and pressing Start. 10 mL/h is a typical starting flow rate for a 400 µm inner diameter capillary needle. Slowly increase the flow rate if the mesh electronics probe does not move within the needle.\n\tNOTE: It is important to minimize the volume of fluid injected into the brain as this can damage the tissue surrounding the injection site. Best results are achieved with injection volumes less than 25 µL per 1 mm of injected mesh length. Ideal values are less than half of this volume; in our laboratory, we typically inject 10–50 µL per a 4 mm injected mesh length.\nAs the mesh electronics probe starts to move within the needle, use the stereotaxic frame to retract the needle at the same rate with which the mesh electronics probe is being injected, using the marked original position of mesh electronics as a guide.\n\tNOTE: This procedure, termed the field of view (FoV) injection method25, allows for precise delivery of mesh electronics to a targeted brain region without crumpling or dislocation. Often the flow rate can be reduced once the mesh electronics probe begins moving within the needle. In our laboratory, flow rates of 20–30 mL/h are often required to overcome the static friction between the mesh and capillary needle walls, but the rate can then be reduced to 10 mL/h once the injection process has been initiated. Flow rates and injection volumes are usually smaller for smaller diameter capillary needles.",
    "Continue flowing saline and retracting the needle until the needle has exited the skull. Stop the flow from the syringe pump.\n4. Input/output Interfacing\nNOTE: At this point, the mesh electronics probe has been injected from the desired starting point within the brain along the chosen trajectory. The needle has been retracted and is just above the craniotomy with the mesh electronics interconnects spanning from the brain to the needle and the I/O pads still inside the needle (Figure 7B). This section uses a printed circuit board (PCB; Figure 7, Figure 8) to interface to the mesh electronics probe. The PCB connects a ZIF connector to a 32-channel standard amplifier connector through an insulating substrate that becomes the head-stage for neural recording experiments. The PCB is customizable to accommodate various head-stage configurations. Our design files are available by request or from the resource website, meshelectronics.org, and can be used to purchase PCBs inexpensively from vendors of PCB manufacture and assembly services.\nUse the stereotaxic frame to carefully guide the needle to the FFC clamping substrate and across the gap, flowing the solution with the syringe pump to generate slack in the mesh electronics interconnects (Figure 7C).\nOnce the needle is above the clamping substrate and across the gap, resume the flow at a fast rate to eject the mesh electronics I/O pads onto the clamping substrate (Figure 7D).\nUsing tweezers and a pipette of DI, bend the I/O pads to ca. 90° angle as close to the first I/O pad as possible.",
    "NOTE: The bending is necessary to allow the pads to be inserted into the ZIF connector on a PCB in a subsequent step. The ZIF connector is exactly the same width as the 32 I/O pads of the mesh electronics probe, so an imperfect 90° bend, or a bend not occurring right before the first I/O pad, will result in having to cut off I/O pads (the left-most pads in Figure 7E).\nOnce the I/O pads are aligned, unfolded, and at a 90° angle to the mesh stem, dry them in place with gently flowing compressed air.\n\tNOTE: Mesh electronics probes with fewer than 32 channels can be interfaced to with the same 32-channel interface board. For example, our lab commonly uses 16-channel mesh electronics probes with 32-channel PCBs. This provides extra space within the ZIF connector, making interfacing easier, and the additional uncontacted channels are easily identified as open circuits by means of impedance testing during recording sessions.\nCut the clamping substrate at a straight edge approximately 0.5–1 mm from the edge of the I/O pads. Also cut off extraneous parts of the clamping substrate that will hinder the insertion into the PCB-mounted 32-channel ZIF connector (Figure 7F).\nInsert the I/O pads into the ZIF connector on the PCB and close the latch (Figure 7G). Use measurement electronics to measure the impedance between the channels and the ground screw to confirm successful interfacing. If the impedance values are too high, unlatch the ZIF connector, adjust the insertion, and retest until successful connection is confirmed.\nCover the ZIF connector and exposed mesh electronics interconnects with dental cement for protection. Flip the PCB at the gap in the substrate, and fix the PCB with cement onto the mouse skull (Figure 7H).",
    "NOTE: Bending the FFC at the gap reduces the mechanical strain that can sometimes break the mesh electronics interconnects.\nAllow the cement to harden, turning the PCB into a robust, compact head-stage for interfacing during subsequent recording sessions (Figure 7I).\n5. Neural Recording Experiments\nPlace the mouse in a tailveiner or other restrainer33. Insert the preamplifier PCB into the standard amplifier connector on the head-stage PCB. Use a separate cable to ground the reference screw.\nFor restrained recordings, leave the mouse in the restrainer. Record the data using the data acquisition system for the desired time period (Figure 8A).\nFor freely moving recordings, release the mouse from the restrainer after inserting the preamplifier PCB and grounding the reference screw. Record for the desired length of time using the data acquisition system while the mouse behaves freely (Figure 8B).\nAt the end of the recording session, put the mouse back in the restrainer, if necessary. Remove the grounding wire and preamplifier, then release the mouse back to its cage and return it to the animal facility until the next recording session.\n6. Histological Sectioning, Staining, and Imaging\nWait until the desired time post-injection, then anesthetize the mouse and transcardially perfuse with formaldehyde. Remove, freeze, and cryosection the brain into 10-µm thick slices. A detailed protocol on immunohistochemistry and cryosectioning of rodent brain tissue can be found in Evilsizor, et al.34.\n\tNOTE: Brain tissue containing mesh electronics can be fixed and sectioned normally, even though the monitoring electronics are left inside. This is a unique capability compared to conventional neural probes, which must be removed before sectioning and therefore may modify the tissue or make it difficult to analyze the probe-tissue interface.\nRinse the frozen brain tissue sections 3 times in 1x PBS.",
    "Block the sections in a solution of 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum in 1x PBS. Let sit at room temperature for 1 h.\nIncubate the sections with the solution of primary antibodies. The primary antibody solutions used here were rabbit anti-NeuN (1:200 dilution), mouse anti-Neurofilament (1:400 dilution), and rat anti-GFAP (1:500 dilution) with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% goat serum. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nRinse the sections 9 times for a total of 40 min with 1x PBS.\nIncubate the brain sections with the solution of secondary antibodies. The secondary antibody solutions used here were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200 dilution), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200 dilution), and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rat (1:200 dilution). Incubate the sections for 1 h at room temperature.\nRinse the sections 9 times for a total of 30 min with 1x PBS.\nMount the sections on the glass slides with coverslips using antifade mountant. Leave the slides in the dark for at least 24 h before imaging.\nImage the slides with a confocal microscope using 488 nm, 561 nm, and 633 nm lasers as the excitation sources for Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568, and Alexa Fluor 647, respectively. Use differential interference contrast (DIC) to image the mesh electronics on the same microscope for subsequent overlaying of the images and analysis."
