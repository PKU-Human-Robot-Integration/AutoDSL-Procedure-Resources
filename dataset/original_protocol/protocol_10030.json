    "1. Preparation of culture medium and culturing of TK6 cells\nNOTE: Some chemicals used in this protocol are toxic. Inhaling, swallowing or contacting skin with Cytochalasin B can be fatal. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment including a laboratory coat and two pairs of nitrile gloves. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Formalin/formaldehyde is toxic if inhaled or swallowed; is irritating to the eyes, respiratory system, and skin; and may cause sensitization by inhalation or skin contact. There is a risk of serious damage to eyes. It is a potential carcinogen.\nPrepare 565 mL of 1x RPMI culture medium. Add 5 mL of MEM non-essential amino acids (100x), 5 mL of sodium pyruvate (100 mM), 5 mL of penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (100x), and 50 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to a 500 mL bottle of 1x RPMI 1640 medium. Prepare the medium in a biosafety cabinet and store at 2-8 °C. Heat the medium to 37 °C prior to adding it to the TK6 cells (see Table of Materials).\nThaw 1 mL of TK6 cells (stored at -80 °C in DMSO) in 10 mL of medium. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 8 min and aspirate the supernatant. Transfer the cells to 50 mL of media and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The doubling time of TK6 cells varies from ~12-18 h and a few (3 or 4) passages will be required for the cells to reach their maximum proliferation rate (see Table of Materials).\nCulture 100 mL of cells to a concentration of ~7-8 x 105 cells/mL.\n2. Preparation of clastogens and/or aneugens and Cytochalasin B",
    "Prepare appropriate stock concentrations of desired clastogens and aneugens. For example, for Mitomycin C, dissolve a full 2 mg bottle in 10 mL of sterile water to achieve a final stock concentration of 200 µg/mL. Mitomycin C can be stored at 4 °C for three months (see Table of Materials).\nOn experiment day, prepare dilutions of the desired chemicals that are either 10-fold or 100-fold higher than the desired exposure concentrations if diluting in sterile water or DMSO, respectively.\nFor Mitomycin C, prepare 3 mL dilutions in sterile water of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 µg/mL. For Colchicine, prepare 3 mL dilutions in sterile water of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 µg/mL. Finally, for Mannitol, prepare 3 mL dilutions in sterile water of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/mL.\nPrepare a 200 µg/mL stock concentration of Cytochalasin B by dissolving a 5 mg bottle into 25 mL of DMSO. Cytochalasin B can be stored at -20 °C for several months.\n3. Exposure of cells to clastogens and/or aneugens\nAdd 1 mL of desired chemical (e.g. Mitomycin C) to 9 mL of cells at ~7-8x105 cells/mL in a T25 flask. For the control samples, add 1 mL of sterile water. Place the flasks in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 h.\n\tNOTE: If chemicals are diluted in DMSO, add only 100 µL of the chemical to each flask and add 100 µL of DMSO to controls. Each flask should contain 9.900 mL of cells.",
    "After 3 h, remove flasks from the incubator and transfer cells to 15 mL polypropylene tubes. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 8 min, aspirate the supernatant and transfer cells to new T25 flasks containing a total of 10 mL of fresh culture medium. Add 150 µL of the stock concentration (200 µg/mL) of Cytochalasin B to each flask to achieve a final concentration of 3 µg/mL.\nReturn the flasks to the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for a recovery time equal to 1.5-2.0 doubling times, as recommended by the OECD guidelines9. For the TK6 cells used in this work, the recovery time was 24 h.\n\tNOTE: The doubling time of the TK6 cells used here was 15 h and a recovery time of 24 h (1.6 doubling times) was used. Recovery times less than 1.5 doubling times will reduce proliferation in samples exposed to higher doses impacting the number of BNCs. Conversely, recovery times of more than 2.0 will produce a disproportionate number of polynucleated cells in control samples, skewing cytotoxicity calculations.\n4. Preparation of buffers for fixation and labeling of DNA content (see Table of Materials)\nPrepare 75 mM of potassium chloride (KCl) by adding 2.79 g to 500 mL of ultrapure water. Stir the solution for 5 min using a magnetic stirrer and sterile filter through a 200 µm filter. The 75 mM KCl solution can be stored at 4 °C for several months.",
    "Prepare a sufficient amount of 4% formalin for the experiment, anticipating that a total of 2.1 mL must be added to each sample. For example, to prepare 10 mL of 4% formalin, add 4 mL of 10% formalin stock to 6 mL of 1x Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline solution without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (PBS). This 4% formalin can be stored at room temperature for several weeks.\nPrepare 510 mL of wash buffer (2% FBS in 1X PBS) by adding 10 mL of FBS to a 500 mL bottle of 1x PBS.\nPrepare 10 mL of a 100 µg/mL concentration of Hoechst 33342 by adding 100 µL of the stock concentration (1 mg/mL) to 9,900 µL of 1X PBS. The Hoechst 33342 solution can be stored at 4 °C for several months.\n5. Sample processing: hypotonic swelling, fixation, cell counting and labeling DNA content\nAt the end of the recovery period, remove all flasks from the incubator and transfer all samples to 15 mL polypropylene tubes. Centrifuge all samples at 200 x g for 8 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells and add 5 mL of 75 mM KCl. Mix gently by inversion three times and incubate at 4 °C for 7 min.\nAdd 2 mL of 4% formalin to each sample, mix gently by inversion three times and incubate at 4 °C for 10 min. This step acts as a \"soft fixation\".\nCentrifuge all samples at 200 x g for 8 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 100 µL of 4% formalin for 20 min. This step acts as a \"hard fixation\".\nAdd 5 mL of wash buffer and centrifuge at 200 x g for 8 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 100 µL of wash buffer.\nTransfer all samples to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "Perform a cell count on each sample to determine the number of cells per sample. Samples will be highly concentrated so a 1:100 dilution in 1x PBS (10 µL of sample in 990 µL of PBS) will likely be required to obtain an accurate count.\n\tNOTE: At this point it is best to perform cell counts using a hemocytometer. Adding KCl gives the cytoplasm a translucent appearance, making it difficult for automated cell counters to recognize them. Also, automated counters have difficulty scoring polynucleated cells due to their size.\nIf not running the samples on the MIFC immediately, they can be stored at 4 °C for several days. When ready to run samples, add 5 µL of 100 µg/mL per 1x106 cells/mL to each sample. Also add 10 µL of 500 µg/mL of RNase per 100 µL of sample for a final concentration of 50 µg/mL. Incubate the samples at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nMicro-centrifuge all samples at 200 x g for 8 min and use a pipette to remove the supernatant leaving ~30 μL. Use a pipette to resuspend all samples before running on the MIFC ensuring there are no bubbles in the tube. Do not vortex.\n6. Starting and calibrating the MIFC\nEnsure the sheath, system calibration reagent, debubbler, cleanser and sterilizer containers are full and the waste tank is empty. Power up the system and double-click on the MIFC software icon. Click the Startup button and make sure that the Start all calibrations and tests checkbox is checked. This will flush the system, load sheath and system calibration reagents, and calibrate the system (see Table of Materials).\n7. Running samples on the MIFC",
    "NOTE: This section assumes the use of a 2 camera MIFC. If using a 1 camera MIFC, please see Supplement 1 - Full Protocol, section 7 for the creation of plots during acquisition\nLaunch the MIFC data acquisition software (see Table of Materials). Figure 1 shows the instrument settings. Turn on the 405 nm laser and set the laser power to 10 mW (A). Disable all other lasers (including SSC) and set the BF to channels 1 and 9 (B).

Specify the file name and the destination folder, change the number of events to 20,000, and select the DNA-positive population.\nClick Load (Figure 1F) and place the control sample into the MIFC. Click the Acquire button to collect the data (Figure 1G). Once the acquisition is complete, click the Return button to return the sample (Figure 1H). Remove the sample tube from the instrument. Repeat this process for all remaining samples in the experiment.\n8. Opening a data file in IDEAS\nLaunch the MIFC analysis software package (see the Table of Materials). Click on Start Analysis to start the Open File Wizard. Select a data file by browsing to the desired raw image file (.rif). Click the Open button and click Next.\nSince this is a single color assay, compensation is not necessary so click Next to bypass the compensation step. At this stage there is no analysis template to apply, so click Next again. If the analysis template has been downloaded from the supplementary material, select it now. These templates only work with a 2 camera MIFC with BF set to channels 1 and 9 and nuclear imagery in channel 7 during acquisition.",
