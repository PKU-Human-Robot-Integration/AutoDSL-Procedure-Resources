    "All experiments are approved by the national animal experiment board.\n1. Preparations\nPrepare all solutions and keep in room temperature, unless otherwise indicated. Follow waste disposal regulations to dispose used materials and solutions.\nUse NMRI and ICR outbred stocks, between ages 4-12 weeks and either gender. If using the C57BL/6 strain, follow the ketamine-medetomidine preparation method in step 1.3.2. For other steps, follow the instructions described in 1.3.3.-1.3.5.\nPrepare the veterinary medicine fresh and in time before starting the operation. Carprofen will be used later, thus it is not necessary to prepare it at this point.\n\t\nTo prepare a solution of ketamine-medetomidine for anesthesia, mix 0.375 mL (stock concentration 50 mg/mL) of ketamine (Ketaminol Vet) with 0.25 mL (stock concentration 1 mg/mL) of medetomidine (Cepetor Vet) and add 1.25 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl. Administer 0.15 mL/20 g of mouse weight (7.5 mg/kg, ketamine and 1 mg/kg, medetomidine).\nTo prepare a more dilute solution of ketamine-medetomidine for anesthesia on C57BL/6 mice, mix 0.375 mL (stock concentration 50 mg/mL) of ketamine with 0.25 mL (stock concentration 1 mg/mL) of medetomidine and add 2.5 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl. Administer 0.15 mL/20 g of mouse weight (3.75 mg/kg, ketamine and 0.5 mg/kg, medetomidine).\n\t\tNOTE: This is an alternative step, only for adult C57BL/6 mice.\nTo prepare buprenorfin for analgesia, add 0.1 mL (stock concentration 0.3 mg/mL) of buprenorfin to 1.9 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl. Administer 0.2 mL/20 g mouse weight (0.15 mg/kg).\nTo prepare atipamezole for discontinuing anesthesia, add 0.1 mL (stock concentration 5 mg/mL) of atipamezole to 4.9 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Administer 0.15 mL/20 g mouse weight (0.75 mg/kg).\nFor analgesia during post-anesthesia use carprofen. Add 0.1 mL (stock concentration 50 mg/mL) of carprofen to 4.9 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Administer 0.15 mL/20 g of mouse weight (7.5 mg/kg).",
    "Prepare fluorescent staining solution\n\t\nFor visualizing the abrasion under the Cobalt blue light (Figure 1), use a fluorescent solution. Prepare a 0.1% fluorescein solution by first measuring 10 mg of fluorescein salt with a fine scale and then add it to 10 mL in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS).\nProtect the fluorescein solution from light and shake for 5 minutes on a shaker.\n\t\tNOTE: The fluorescein solution is light-sensitive; keep the solution covered from light. This solution can be stored in +4 °C for 2-3 days. For use, it is helpful to place the fluorescein solution in a dropper bottle that is used for eye drops. Use a sterile-filter when moving the solution to the dropper bottle.\nClean the ocular burr tip before and after use; first with PBS and then with 70% EtOH. If making an abrasion to several mice during the same operation, do the cleaning steps between each mouse.\nPut the heated plate on (+37 °C) and place a paper towel on it.\n2. Corneal Abrasion\nCAUTION: Use protective wear (gloves, lab coat) when handling mice. Weigh the mouse to estimate the volume of medication to administer.\nUse the one-handed scruffing method to handle the mouse23. Administer ketamine-medetomidine mixture intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the left lower abdomen. Place the mouse to an individual cage and wait for it to fall asleep. This typically takes less than 5 minutes. Then, administer first buprenorfin and then atipamezole via i.p. injections. Use the same handling technique.\n\tNOTE: Once anesthesia is given, the protocol should not be paused at any moment.",
    "Before continuing, check that the heated plate is warm. Place the anesthetized mouse on the heated plate. The level of anesthesia is good if the tail reflex is absent, but the toe reflex is present. Check these reflexes by pinching the tail and any toe with fingers or forceps. Do not use excessive force. Anesthesia will last 20-25 minutes.\nTo make an abrasion, use the cleaned ocular burr. Rotate the base of the burr to turn on the vibration that is essential to make the abrasion. Feel the vibration in hand, when the burr is functioning properly.\n\t\nOpen one eye at a time by holding the eyelids separately with fingers. Then firmly touch the burr to the cornea and move the instrument back and forth as well as sideways on the ocular surface. The burr vibration will perform the scratch; do not press, shake or tear the cornea. In the central cornea, 20 abrading movements on the surface are sufficient to induce the wound. Do not lift the burr and try to stay in the region of the cornea to be abraded. Acquiring a standard-sized abrasion will require several rounds of practice.\n\tNOTE: Corneal asepsis can be achieved before abrasion by using betadine ophthalmic solution.\n3. Imaging the Abrasion\nIlluminate the abraded region using Cobalt blue pen light (Figure 1) and fluorescein solution. The ocular surface appears colorless in ambient light. After fluorescein application, the abraded region fluoresces in green when illuminating the eye with the pen light.",
    "If needed, open the abraded eye similarly as in 2.3 and administer one drop of fluorescein solution from the dropper bottle. Wash the eye once with PBS or 0.9% NaCl to reduce background of the fluorescein. Use a dropper bottle or a pipette for washing. Aspirate the liquid away with a soft wipe and clean the eyelashes, if needed. The excess liquid usually collects to the nasal border of the eye, close to the opening of the tear canal.\n\t\tCAUTION: Avoid touching the cornea while cleaining as minor abrasions might be induced.\nTake pictures of the corneal abrasion.\n\t\nTo obtain similar images during each imaging session, use steady attachment tools for the Cobalt blue pen light and the SLR camera (Figure 2). This protocol provides a setup that is easy to repeat (Figure 2).\n\t\t\nTo attach the pen light and the camera, use a table lamp with a flexible arm and clamp and an adjustable camera arm with a clamp, respectively. Cable-tie the pen light to the table lamp and position just above the mouse eye. Positioning the light differently might alter the visualization of the abrasion. A suggestion for positioning these tools is described in Figure 2.\nUse the SLR camera to take pictures of the eye. Place the animal in a desired distance and position and focus the camera (1:12) in room light. After that, close all other lights except the Cobalt blue pen light.\n\t\tNOTE: Tape the pen light handle down or use a rubber band to keep the light on all the time during imaging. This might help if the image becomes blurry. It is easiest to perform the imaging step with a colleague.\n4. Waking up after Corneal Abrasion",
    "Administer first buprenorfin and then atipamezole via i.p. injections. Use the same handling technique as in 2.1.\nPlace a drop of antibacterial, fucidin acid eye ointment (Isathal) to both abraded and non-abraded eyes to moisturize and keep the ocular surface clean from bacteria after anesthesia.\nAs the mouse will wake up in 5-20 minutes on the heated plate, observe the mouse during the post-anesthetic wake-up period. When it becomes mobile, place it in an individual cage.\n\tNOTE: If waking up takes longer, place the mouse in the cage with a heated pad or place the entire cage on the heated plate and monitor the mouse regularly. While the anesthesia wears off, the mouse typically shakes and reaches upwards with the anterior body. This behavior should return to normal in 3-4 hours and then you can place the mouse back to a shared cage.\nAdminister carprofen i.p. for analgesia and eye ointment on two consecutive days after the abrasion, similarly as in steps 2.2. and 4.2.\n5. Imaging during Wound Healing\nIn this protocol, use time points 18 h and 72 h after abrasion to observe the wound closure.\n\t\nFor consecutive imaging, anesthetize the mice as explained in 2.2.\nTake pictures as explained in 3.\nWake up the animals with atipamezole i.p. and monitor the wake-up period as explained in 4.3.\n\t\tNOTE: If not continuing the follow-up, euthanize the mouse right after 5.1.2. Euthanasia is described in 6.1.\n6. Cornea Collection and Paraffin Embedding\nAfter the last time point, sacrifice the animal. Place the mouse in a chamber that can be filled with CO2. Fill the chamber air with CO2. When the animal is immobile, dislocate the cervical vertebrae by pulling firmly from the base of the tail and pressing the neck region down at the same time.",
    "CAUTION: Always follow the guidelines of the local animal welfare body.\nCollect the whole eyeball by cutting an opening in the skin to the side of the eye with dissection scissors. Place the scissors under the eyeball and cut the ocular nerve to pop the eyeball out of the orbit. Use forceps if the eye does not come out easily.\n\t\nMake a hole on the back of the eye, on the retinal side, with a 26G needle to allow free penetration of solutions inside the eye.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not let the eye become dry, instead, place it in PBS until continuing with the protocol.\nCollect the eyeball in a 2 mL tube with PBS. Do not pause the experiment at this point.\nRemove PBS and fix eyeballs in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in +4 °C for 4-5 hours.\nMove the fixed eyeball to a tissue cassette for tissue processing. Use a tissue processing machine and the following program:\n\t\nRinse with PBS.\nIncubate 2 x 45 min in 70% ethanol at room temperature.\nIncubate 2 x 1 h in 94% ethanol at room temperature.\nIncubate 3 x 45 min in absolute ethanol at room temperature.\nIncubate 3 x 1 h in xylene, at room temperature and last xylene at 37 °C.\nIncubate 3 x 1 h in paraffin wax at 60 °C.\nAfter tissue processing, embed the eyeball into liquid paraffin (+ 60 °C) using a tissue embedding block. Place the eye inside the block so that it is looking sideways and the peripheral border is facing upwards. Let the block solidify on a cool plate for 5-10 minutes.\n7. Paraffin Sections of the Cornea\nPrepare the microtome for sectioning according to the institution's or manufacturer's instructions.\n\tCAUTION: Be careful when handling the sharp microtome blade.",
    "Place one water bath with room temperature ultrapure water beside the microtome and another with ultrapure water heated to +50 °C.\nMake 5 µm thick sections of the eyeball.\n\tNOTE: The lens breaks easily during sectioning. To avoid this, wipe the cutting surface with a moist tissue each time a new row of sections is started. Use tap water to moisten the tissue.\nPlace the sections beside each other in the room temperature water bath and then move them to the hot water bath with the help of a glass slide. Stretch the sections in the hot water bath until all wrinkles relax and the sections become matte.\nDry the glass slides with sections overnight in +37 °C.\nAttach the sections to the slides by keeping the slide for 1 minute on a heated plate in +60 °C. After this, the sections can be directly processed for staining, immunohistological methods or stored in +4 °C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
