    "Bacterial culture using B. megaterium YC4-R4 as an exampleRefresh YC4-R4 from glycerol stock on LB-Agar plate and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h*/**.Take a single colony to inoculate 5 ml LB medium (in vitro) (recommended 15 ml tubes). Incubate overnight in a shaker (220 rpm, 37 °C). For soil inoculation, scale up by using 1 ml of pre-culture per liter of fresh culture (final volume depends on soil initial moisture and pot volume)*.Prepare 0.45% NaCl solution by mixing 4.5 g per liter of ddH2O. Autoclave for 20 min at 121 °C. Cool to room temperature before use.Centrifuge the culture at 3,220 × g for 10 min. Resuspend the pellet in the same volume of 0.45% NaCl. OD600 ~0.8-1.1 (log growth phase; generally, equals to 106-108 CFU/ml) is recommended.Notes: *This step shall be done under sterile conditions. **For tests using antibiotic-resistant strains, LB plates may be prepared with the appropriate antibiotics. Prepare bacteria growth mediumMix 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g NaCl per liter of ddH2O.For making LB agar plates, add 15 g agar per liter.Autoclave for 20 min at 121 °C. For LB agar plates, pour the liquid medium into Petri dishes and allow it to cool down and solidify.Prepare plant growth mediumMix MS powder in half strength (2.21 g) and agar (0.7% and 1% for circular and square plates, respectively, depending on test requirements) per liter of ddH2O.Adjust pH to 5.7 with NaOH or KOH.Autoclave for 20 min at 121 °C. Pour the medium into the Petri dishes and allow it to cool down and solidify.Seed sterilization and plant growth conditionsMix seeds with absolute ethanol in 1.5 ml tubes and keep in agitation for 1 min. For 100 seeds, 1 ml of ethanol is recommended.",
    "Discard ethanol and add 20% bleach solution (from commercial bleach stock). For 100 seeds, 1 ml of 20% bleach solution is recommended. Agitate in a spinner wheel for 10-15 min.Discard bleach and wash three times with sterile ddH2O in a clean bench*.Plant the seeds on MS medium one by one with the aid of pipet tips*.Stratify the seeds at 4 °C for 48 h. After stratification, place the plates vertically in the growth chamber for 14 days under the following conditions: 22 °C; 12 h light/12 h dark cycle; 40% relative humidity; and up to 155 µmol·m−2s−1 light intensity.Note: *This step shall be done under sterile conditions. In vitro colonization testUnder sterile conditions, place 15-20 14-days-after-germination (DAG) seedlings grown in ½ MS 1% agar (in squared Petri plates) per replica in a 1.5 ml sterile tube (volume of sterile tube depends on plant size). Add 1 ml of bacteria in 0.45% NaCl solution.Incubate the tube overnight on a shaker (220 rpm, 26 °C*).Discard the bacterial solution. Place the seedlings on a sterile surface, such as sterilized aluminum foil or paper, or a Petri dish. Cut roots with sterile razor blades and keep them in 1.5 ml tubes.Sterilize the root surface by adding 1 ml of 75% ethanol, treating for 7-10 min with continuous agitation (spin wheel or equivalent).Discard the ethanol and wash the roots for three times with sterile ddH2O.Discard the ddH2O and grind roots with sterile pistils (for 1.5 ml tubes).Add 1 ml of 0.45% NaCl to the tube, homogenize by vortexing, and prepare serial dilutions (usually 5 times 10-fold dilution should be enough).Plate drop by drop (10 drops of 10 µl approx.",
    "up to a total volume of 100 µl) each dilution in LB-agar plates, let them dry for 2 min and incubate at 30 °C** for 24 h (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3976/bioprotoc-11-07-3976-g001.jpgFigure 1. Example of drop-by-drop seeding of a serial dilution in a quarter-divided growth plate. Drops are carefully placed on the dry growth medium plate to avoid interferences.Keep and centrifuge the original solution at the maximal speed. Once root debris is pelleted, discard the supernatant and fully dry at 60 °C in an oven for 48 h and record this weight as the dry weight (DW), by using Pasteur oven.Count bacteria colony numbers and calculate the colony forming units (CFUs) by taking into account the dilution and plated volume. Normalize the CFU values with root DW to obtain the colonization rates. Colonization rate = (CFUs × dilution factor)/mg of root DW.Notes: All work shall be done under sterile conditions. *This temperature has been tested to ensure non-stressing conditions for plants; at the same time, bacteria growth under the same temperature should also be considered to avoid imposing stress to the bacteria. **The temperature used herein is optimal for colony-counting of the example bacteria. It is highly recommended to optimize the temperature for different strains in order to avoid overgrowth/overlapped colonies. Determination of colonization ratio in soil-grown plantsGrow Arabidopsis seedlings as described above.Prepare soil based on the conditions required. In our tests, soil is prepared by meshing a mix 1:3 (v:v) of vermiculite and soil substrate. To minimize unwanted microbes in the soil, the soil needs to be tyndalized (75 °C for 3 h + cooling interval for 10 h + 75 °C for another 3 h). Transfer 5 DAG seedlings to the soil.Inoculate with bacteria in 0.45% NaCl solution. As reference, in a regular 0.",
    "4 L pot, inoculate 50 ml of bacteria solution around planted seedlings.Allow the plants to grow under conditions as required by the desired tests (e.g., with or without certain abiotic stress).Harvest the roots (usually 20-40 mg of roots) at the time when colonization quantification is desired. For root harvesting, manually detach the soil around each root (with the help of tweezers) and then use a soft tissue to detach the smallest and most adhered pieces of soil. Fine soil particles must be removed by 3 × ddH2O washing*. Once roots are clean, follow indications for sterilizing, grinding, preparing dilutions, and counting CFUs in Part E.Note: *This step shall be done under sterile conditions. Strain isolation and identificationAlthough the soil was tyndalized, typically Part F will yield a small portion of bacteria other than the inoculated strain. To confirm the identity of the inoculated strain and to calculate its proportion in the total bacterial population, first classify bacterial colonies by morphology (use https://microbeonline.com/colony-morphology-bacteria-describe-bacterial-colonies/[href=https://microbeonline.com/colony-morphology-bacteria-describe-bacterial-colonies/], as reference), then use sterile toothpicks to pick single colonies with similar morphology and transfer them to liquid LB medium for culturing. Usually, 20-30 colonies should be randomly sampled to avoid bias (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3976/bioprotoc-11-07-3976-g002.jpgFigure 2. An example of colonies with different morphologies in a regular root colonization quantification process. Different morphologies were selected by color, size, or brightness of the colonies. The colour of the arrows indicates a pre-group of strains: according to the following criteria: red – intense yellow color; blue – white color, big size; orange – white color, small size; and green – beige color, matte surface.Culture the individual colonies in 5 ml of liquid LB on a shaker (220 rpm, 30 °C) for 24 h.",
    "Centrifuge the culture (suggestion in bench centrifuge: 3,220 × g, 10 min), discard supernatant, and extract DNA from pellets by using a high-performance method. Here, a DNA extraction kit is suggested (see methods).Amplify and sequence 16S rRNA genes with the 27F (5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’) and 1492R (5’-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’) (or equivalent), and BLAST the sequence to identify isolated species.To further distinguish the inoculated strain from other strains of the same species, perform PCR with ERIC primer (5’-ATGTAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC-3’) to generate fingerprinting phenotype patterns for each strain. Use the stock strains employed in the test as the reference. Run the samples in a 2% agarose gel to maximize band separation. Use GelJ to compare the patterns with the reference and obtain similarity indexes. Figure 3 includes a representative gel image output.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3976/bioprotoc-11-07-3976-g003.jpgFigure 3.
