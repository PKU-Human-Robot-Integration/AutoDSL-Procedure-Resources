    "1. Preparation of Uranyl Acetate Solution\nTo prepare 2 mL of a 100 mM uranyl acetate solution, add 85 mg of uranyl acetate (UO2(OCOCH3)2, 2H2O; M = 424 g.mol-1) in solid state to a 5 mL plastic tube.\nAdd 2 mL of distilled water to the plastic tube and fit it with a plastic stopper.\nShake the tube vigorously until the total dissolution of the solid. Put the solution into the fridge for 24 h.\n\tCAUTION: The manipulation of uranyl [U(VI)] presents some chemical and radiological hazards. All the samples should be prepared and characterized with ad hoc equipment in specific laboratories. All U(VI)-containing liquids should be collected in specifically assigned waste containers and disposed of as toxic waste. Dry waste (pipets, tubes, etc.) could be washed with 0.1 N HNO3 solution, which will solubilize and remove U(VI).\nVerify the pH of the solution using a microelectrode and a pH-meter.\n\tNOTE: The microelectrode should be previously calibrated using commercial buffer solutions (pH= 4 and pH = 7).\n2. RAW 264.7 Cell Culture\nMaintenance of the cells.\nCultivate RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC, TIB-71) in 75 cm2 flasks in the following growth medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum and antibiotics: 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Maintain cells in incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange medium every 2 to 3 days. When the cells are 85-90% confluent, mechanically remove them from the culture flask using a cell scraper (as recommended by the ATCC) and split them at a ratio of 1:6.\n\t\tNOTE:Only cells between passages 3 to 10 are used for differentiation experiments.\nPreparation of the cells for experiments",
    "Dislodge cells from the flask substrate as described above and transfer them to a sterile 50 mL tube. Mix cells by pipetting up and down to break up clumps. Count them with a hemocytometer. Expect 35-40 million cells per 75 cm2 flask.\nCalculate volume of cells suspension necessary for each experiment as follows:\n\t\tNumber of experimental conditions x 3 (triplicates) x 1 mL/well + 3-4 mL (pipetting losses).\n\t\tNOTE: Seeding density for all assays described in this protocol is 5,000 cell/cm2. Therefore, for a 24-well plate, it means 10,000 cells per well in 1 mL of medium, and cell suspension density is thus 10,000 cells/mL.\nPrepare necessary volume of 10,000 cells/mL cell suspension and seed the cells into 24-well plates. For cytotoxicity assays, use normal growth medium. For differentiation and resorption assays, use alpha modified Minimum Essential Medium (αMEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine, 5% FBS and 50 ng/mL of GST-RANKL17.\n\t\tNOTE: The GST-RANKL protein produced in-house can be replaced by any commercially available RANKL cytokine. When working with a new RANKL batch, it may be useful to test its effectiveness in inducing osteoclastogenesis by performing a dose response experiment with RANKL concentration ranging from 20 to 150 ng/mL.\n3. Dilution of the 100 mM Uranyl Acetate Solution in Culture Medium\nNOTE: Uranyl ions [U(VI)] in culture medium form multiple complexes with other medium components that could modify its cellular toxicity18,19,20,21. For this reason, uranyl-containing media should be prepared extemporaneously without omitting or shortening equilibration steps.\nChose uranyl exposure concentrations and calculate volumes of culture media required for the experiment (taking into account that each condition is performed in triplicate).\nStarting from the sterile cell culture tested 7.5% sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution ([HCO3-] = 893 mM), prepare a 100 mM HCO3- solution in water and cool it on ice.",
    "Add drop-by-drop 1 volume of uranyl acetate 100 mM stock solution to 9 volumes of ice-cold 100 mM HCO3- solution, gently shaking the mixing tube. This operation will dilute uranyl acetate stock solution ([UO22+] = 100 mM, pH 4) to 10 mM and bring the pH to around 7.\nAdd 1 volume of sterile water to 9 volumes of ice-cold 100 mM HCO3- solution to reach 90 mM HCO3- (equal to HCO3- concentration in the 10 mM uranyl solution), which will serve to prepare the control medium.\nAllow prepared solutions to stand for 3 h at room temperature (RT) for equilibration.\nIn the meantime, prepare the basic exposure medium: αMEM with 2 mM L-Glutamine and 5% FBS.\n\tNOTE: For differentiation and resorption assays, add 50 ng/mL of GST-RANKL to the basic exposure medium.\nAfter 3 h, dilute appropriate amounts of the 10 mM uranyl solution drop by drop in the exposure medium so as to achieve the desired uranyl working concentrations. Prepare simultaneously the control medium by adding the amount of bicarbonate used in the most concentrated uranyl-treated condition, to the exposure medium.\nAllow prepared media to stand for 3 h at RT for equilibration.\nRemove growth media from the wells and replace it with the control and the uranyl-containing media.\n4. Analysis of RAW 264.7 Precursors Viability in the Presence of U(VI) (MTT Cytotoxic Assays)\nCAUTION: Both MTT and DMSO could cause skin and eye irritation. Wear gloves and eye protection when handling them. Collect waste products in specifically assigned waste containers.\nDissolve an appropriate amount of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) powder in PBS to obtain a 10x stock solution at 5 mg/mL. Sterilize it by filtration with a 0.22 µm filter and store aliquots at -20 °C.",
    "Plate cells on 24-well plates (3 wells per experimental condition per plate). Do not forget to reserve 3 empty wells per plate for the spectrophotometer blanks.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C for 22-24 h prior to uranium exposure to let cells attach.\nPrepare uranyl-containing media as described in section 3.\nReplace growth medium in the cell-seeded plates with uranyl-containing media. Incubate for 24 h.\nCalculate the necessary volume of 1x MTT solution as follows:\n\t(Number of experimental conditions + blank) x 3 (triplicates) x 0.4 mL/well + 10% volume for pipetting losses.\nPrepare the required volume of 1x MTT solution by diluting the 10x stock MTT solution in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) without phenol red.\n\tNOTE:For a successful colorimetric assay, MTT should be protected from light. It is recommended to dilute MTT into EMEM rather than DMEM in order to limit the background signal.\nRemove uranyl-containing media from the wells, wash them with PBS and add 400 µL of MTT solution to each well (including 3 empty wells for blanks). Incubate 2.5 h at 37 °C in the dark. Verify under microscope that dark purple formazan crystals have formed inside viable cells.\nDiscard the MTT solution and add 220 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) per well. Wrap plates in aluminum foil to protect them from the light and gently agitate for 10 min to dissolve formazan crystals.\nUse a microplate spectrometer reader to determine the optical density (OD) at 570 nm (formazan specific) and 690 nm (background). For each well, subtract 690 nm OD from 570 nm OD to adjust for possible non-specific OD value fluctuation due to scratches or turbidity22.",
    "Calculate the blank-corrected OD for each well by subtracting mean OD of the blank from the OD obtained in the previous step. Determine the mean OD value for each experimental condition.\nSet mean OD of the control condition ([UO22+] = 0 mM) to 100% viability and calculate the corresponding percentage of cell viability for other tested uranyl concentrations. Plot a dose-response curve. Evaluate the Cytotoxicity Index 50 (CI50), defined as the uranyl concentration leading to 50% cell death after 24h exposure.\n5. Analysis of Osteoclast Differentiation in the Presence of U(VI)\nDifferentiation of RAW 264.7 cells in the presence of uranyl and TRAP (Tartrate -Resistant Acid Phosphatase) staining.\nPlate RAW 264.7 cells on a 24-well plate, 3 wells per experimental condition. Incubate at 37 °C for approximately 6 h, the time to prepare and equilibrate the uranyl-containing exposure media.\nPrepare differentiation media with desired uranyl concentrations as described in section 3 (do not forget to add GST-RANKL to media).\nGently replace basic medium in wells with uranyl-containing medium. This day is considered as day 0 of osteoclastic differentiation.\nChange the medium on day 2 or 3 of osteoclastic differentiation by repeating steps 5.1.2 and 5.1.3. Multinucleated osteoclasts should appear between day 3 and 4.\nPerform the TRAP staining with the commercially available Leukocyte acid phosphatase kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE:Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) also called acid phosphatase 5, tartrate resistant (ACP5) is highly expressed in mature osteoclasts and extensively used as a marker for osteoclast differentiation. Therefore, TRAP staining is performed to visualize osteoclasts. Depending on experimental conditions and the rate of osteoclastogenesis, it could be done on day 4 or day 5 of the differentiation process.",
    "Keep TRAP-stained wells in PBS at 4 °C for further analysis (they can be maintained in these conditions up to 3 or 4 weeks).\nOsteoclast size/morphology analysis.\nAcquire an image of the whole surface of each well. The resolution of the image should be sufficient to distinguish cell nuclei. Consider TRAP-positive cells with 3 or more nuclei, as osteoclasts.\nOpen an image of one well in the ImageJ software: \"File\" → \"Open\".\nVerify the scale units in the upper left corner of the image. For the relative quantification, any unit can be used. If the absolute value of osteoclast size is necessary, convert scale units to µm: \"Image\" → \"Properties\". Check the box \"global\" in the pop-up window in order to have new scale units applied to all images opened later.\n\t\tNOTE: If a microscope was used for image acquisition, the pixel size in µm is indicated for each objective in the imaging software.\nSpecify measurement parameters to be analyzed: \"Analyze\" → \"Set Measurements\". In the Set Measurements window, check \"Area\" and \"Display Label\" boxes and uncheck all the others boxes.\nOpen the ROI (region of interest) manager: \"Analyze\" → \"Tools\" → \"ROI Manager\".\nIn the main window, pick the rectangular selection tool. Use it anywhere in the image to outline a sector of about 1,000 x 1,000 µm. This selection now defines the first region in which osteoclast size will be analyzed.\nIn the ROI Manager window, click on \"Add\" button to add this region of interest to the ROI manager and save it by clicking on \"More\" → \"Save\". The saved ROI can now be reloaded to the ROI manager anytime by clicking on \"More\" → \"Open\".\nRepeat steps 5.2.5 - 5.2.6 to define 4 additional regions for osteoclast size analysis (Figure 2A and 2D).",
    "NOTE: The defined regions will be used to analyze osteoclast sizes in all the images.\nCreate a copy of one of the 5 regions to be analyzed: chose this ROI in the main the ROI manager (the corresponding selection will appear on the main image) → right click inside the selection → \"Duplicate\". Use this duplicate for further analysis.\nIn the ROI Manager window, check boxes \"Show Al\"l and \"Labels\".\nIn the main window, choose the polygon selection tool to manually outline one of the osteoclasts in the selection. Add this outline to the ROI manager by clicking on \"Add\" in the ROI manager window. Proceed similarly for all osteoclasts that lie completely inside the selected region (Figure 2B and 2E).\nIn the ROI Manager window, select all the outlines and measure their surface by clicking on \"Measure\". Transfer the measurements that have appeared in a new window (Results window, Figure 2C and 2F) to a spreadsheet.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, the region of analysis with all the osteoclasts outlines could be saved as an independent image: \"File\" → \"Save As\" format of choice.\nRepeat steps 5.2.8 - 5.2.12 for the remaining regions of analysis of the current image. Then, repeat the whole procedure for all the other images.\nOsteoclast number analysis with ImageJ software.\n\tNOTE: As osteoclast distribution in the well is rarely homogenous, perform the counting on the whole well rather than on few selected zones. Given that osteoclasts are heterogeneous in form and size, no automated counting cell method is practicable.\n\t\nOpen a whole-well image in the ImageJ software (for this analysis, use images from previous sub-section).",
    "Open the cell counter window: \"Plugins\" → \"Analyze\" → \"Cell Counter\". Click on \"Initialize\" and check \"Type 1\" box (or whatever type number you prefer). Verify that \"Show Number\" box is checked and \"Delete Mode\" box is unchecked.\nOn the image, click on one osteoclast: colored dot and a number will appear where clicked. Proceed similarly for all osteoclasts. Save the markers regularly by clicking on \"Save Markers\" in the cell counter window\n\t\tNOTE: If the last point has to be removed from the count, click on \"Delete\" in the cell counter window. If there is more than one point to remove, check the \"Delete Mode\" box and indicate all invalid points by clicking on them. Then uncheck the \"Delete Mode\" box to continue the count.\nDisplay the result of counting by clicking on Results in the cell counter window. Transfer the final counting results to a spreadsheet.\n6. Analysis of Osteoclast Function in the Presence of U(VI)\nPit resorption assay.\nPlate RAW 264.7 cells on a 24-well osteo assay plate, which provides a synthetic inorganic osteomimetic surface that could be resorbed by osteoclasts.\n\t\tNOTE:In order to let cells attach to the biomimetic surface, it is often better to plate them the day before adding the differentiation medium.\nDifferentiate RAW 246.7 cells into osteoclasts as described in section 5 (steps 5.1.2 - 5.1.4)\nOn day 5 of osteoclastogenesis, remove osteoclasts from the bone mimetic surface by replacing uranyl-containing medium with 10% bleach solution. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Wash wells twice with deionized water and let them air-dry.",
    "Add a 1% Alizarin Red S sodium salt solution to the wells to stain calcium salts in the non-resorbed areas. Remove Alizarin solution after 10-15 s of incubation and gently wash the wells 3-4 times with water. Let the wells air-dry.\n\t\tNOTE: The staining procedure described above is designed to enhance contrast between the resorbed and the non-resorbed areas in order to facilitate consecutive analysis. This procedure must be done carefully because if wells are not completely dry before staining, parts of the remaining bone-mimetic surface could be accidentally removed. Moreover, if Alizarin solution is left too long in the wells, a persistent non-specific staining will appear. It should be noted that the test described in this section relates to the effect of uranium on both osteoclastic differentiation and function. To study the effect of uranium on resorption independently of osteoclast formation, RAW 264.7 cells can be treated with uranyl-containing medium for 24 hours, only once mature osteoclasts are formed (at day 4 or 5 of the differentiation process) 23.\nPit resorption analysis.\nAcquire an image of the whole surface of each well of the osteo assay plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Image acquisition methods can vary but should be consistent throughout replicate experiments. They can include a picture taken with a macro objective of a fixed camera, a high-resolution scan or a mosaic image made with an automated high throughput microscope.\nBegin analysis by repeating steps 5.2.2 to 5.2.4 from the previous section.\nConvert an RGB image to a greyscale 8-bit format: \"Image\" → \"Type\" → \"8 bit\".\nIn the main window, select the oval selection tool. Use it to draw a circle outlining all the surface of the well to be analyzed for resorption.\nSave this new ROI as in step 5.2.6.",
    "To facilitate threshold selection, clear all the features outside the defined ROI: \"Edit\" → \"Clear Outside\".\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, it is often better to make a few copies of the image: deselect ROI by clicking outside the selected zone → right click on the image → \"Duplicate\". This action will help avoid a repetition of the image treatment described above if the threshold chosen in the next step is unsatisfactory.\nSelect \"Image\" → \"Adjust\" → \"Threshold\". In the Threshold window, use the slider bar to choose a suitable threshold. All resorbed areas should be below the threshold (white) and non-resorbed, above (red). To finalize the threshold selection, click on \"Apply\" in the Threshold window.\nSave the final binary image: \"File\" → \"Save As\" → format of your choice.\nDefine measurements to be taken in the region of interest: \"Analyze\" → \"Set Measurements\". In the Set Measurements window, check \"Area\", \"Area fraction\" and \"Limit to threshold\" boxes and uncheck all the others.\nIn order to obtain the fraction of \"resorbed\" area directly in the Results window, invert the binary image (\"Edit\" → \"Invert\"). Ensure that the main ROI is selected on the final binary image (otherwise resorbed area fraction will be calculated based on the surface of the whole image window). Measure resorbed area fraction by either clicking on \"Measure\" in the ROI manager window or on \"Analyze\" → \"Measure\". Save the result.\nSubscription Required.
