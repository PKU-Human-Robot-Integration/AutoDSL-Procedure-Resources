    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSpin infection of stimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes with shRNA-mCherry lentivirus\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section provides step-by-step instructions on how to spin infect stimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes with shRNA containing lentivirus on Day 4.\nSpin infection of CD4+ T cells.\nThree days post-activation, resuspend cells and transfer to a 15 mL Falcon tube or any other suitable tube to remove the Dynabeads.\nFor best results, infect stimulated CD4+ T cells immediately with the shRNA-mCherry virus produced in steps 4–6.\nAdd 1 × 106 cells to 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes and pellet them by centrifuging at 800 x g for 3 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove supernatant without disturbing the pellet and add 500 μL of shRNA virus (10,000 ng of p24 Gag/mL), 5 μL 1 M HEPES and 0.5 μL of polybrene (4 μg/mL).\nSpinoculate by centrifuging at 800 x g and 32°C for 1.5 h.\nResuspend the spinoculated cells and transfer them into one well of a 6-well Flat-bottom plate.\nAdd 3 mL of fresh complete RPMI medium + 20 U/mL of IL-2 to each well.\nNote: The viral solution can be removed after spin-infection or can be left on the cells to allow a slight increase in infection over time. Dynabeads can be added back to the spin infected cells to keep activating the CD4+ T cells before the 2nd spin infection with HIV-1-NL4.3-GFP virus. This will slightly increase the spin-infection efficiency. However, the second spin-infection will also work without this continuous activation.\nCulture for 4 days at 37°C in a 5% CO2 in an incubator.\nReplace the medium with fresh complete RPMI medium + 20 U/mL of IL-2 every other day.\nValidation of knockdown efficiency by mRNA expression",

Elute RNA in 50 μL of RNase free water.\nKeep RNA on ice to avoid degradation and quantify total RNA using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.\nPrepare cDNA using Promega AMV Reverse Transcriptase[href=https://www.promega.com/products/pcr/rt-pcr/amv-reverse-transcriptase/?catNum=M5101] following the manufacturer’s instructions. Prepare the cDNA synthesis reaction mix according to Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3104_2.csv\nPrepare fresh at 20°C–25°C.

    "Analysis of SMYD5-mCherry expressing CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this paragraph we describe of how to analyze SMYD5-mCherry expressing CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry on Day 7.\nAnalysis of SMYD5-mCherry infection efficacy by flow cytometry.\n3 days after spin infection, wash cells twice with cold PBS.\nSpin down cells at 800 x g at 20°C–25°C for 3 min.\nDiscard supernatant and stain cells with live/dead eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F65-0865.pdf].\nPrepare a 1:1,000 dilution of the dye in cold PBS buffer.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL/well in a 96-well plate.\nIncubate for 15 min on ice in the dark.\nNote: Live/dead eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 works best since it is detected in the APC-Cy7 channel (red/637 nm) and does not overlap with FITC (blue/488 nm) and PE (yellow/green/561 nm) channels. Therefore, no compensation is needed.\nWash cells 1x with cold PBS buffer and proceed directly to flow cytometry analysis (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for gating strategy).\nNote: Avoid fixing samples with Paraformaldehyde (PFA) since it decreases fluorescence intensity. Cells can also be resuspended in PBS + 2% FBS to keep cell survival stable.
