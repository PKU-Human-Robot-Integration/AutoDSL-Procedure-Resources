    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of participants preceding each experimental day\nTiming: 48 h prior to each experimental day\nNote: Careful instructions to participants ensure filled glycogen stores and similar macronutrient balance on both experimental days.\nInstruct participants to avoid strenuous physical exercise, excessive eating, and alcohol consumption and to keep a food diary for 48 h prior to each experimental day.\nNote: The food diary is collected to control for intermittent fasting and/or excessive eating.\nInstruct participants to consume a standardized meal the evening before experimental days (between 6 and 8 PM) and remain fasted until the experimental day the next morning (equaling approximately 12 h of fasting including any liquids and/or medications).\nNote: If possible, the standardized meal should be the same as used in the ad libitum meal test and can be provided at the screening visit if kept frozen until used by the participant.\nNote: Avoid planning experimental days on Mondays since weekend activities often differ from activities during weekdays in general.\nExperimental days – Day 1 and 2\nTiming: 6–7 h each day\nThe two experimental days are performed in the exact same fashion except for intravenous infusion of native hormone on one day and placebo (vehicle) on the other day in randomized order. The experimental days are performed minimum one week apart. See the graphical abstract for an overview of the clinical study design.\nNote: During study days, exposure to food advertising from television programs, literature, and other sources should be avoided since food advertising can potentially prime eating behavior.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nPrepare the infusion according to the randomization scheme after noting the participant’s body weight upon arrival in the morning.",
    "Critical: To ensure double-blinding, the infusions should be prepared to be identically appearing by an unblinded staff member not otherwise involved in the study, and preparing the two infusions must take approximately the same time, i.e., for the sake of the blinding.\nNote: LEAP2 was diluted to a total volume of 500 mL in saline (9 mg/mL) containing 0.5% human serum albumin. Placebo infusions consisted of 500 mL saline with 0.5% human serum albumin.\nInsert an intravenous catheter in a cubital vein in each arm of the participant, one for blood sampling and one for infusion of hormone/placebo.\nNote: The forearm for blood sampling should be kept warm (45°C) to arterialize the venous blood. This can be done by wrapping the hand/forearm in a heating pad or by using a heated box.\nCollect baseline blood samples and perform procedures for other baseline data (i.e., visual analog scale ratings, indirect calorimetry, collection of urine samples, thermal imaging camera as mentioned in the following sections) according to the chosen sampling scheme and specific instructions for each analytical method included.",
    "Note: Blood-based biomarkers are measured from blood samples collected in specific tubes (pre-chilled on ice in some cases) according to the chosen biomarker analyses. Most tubes should immediately be cooled on ice (plain tubes with serum clot activator should be left at room temperature for approximately 20 min to coagulate), centrifuged, pipetted to storage tubes (plasma/serum), and stored at preferably −80°C until analysis. It is suggested to at least measure plasma concentrations of the administrated hormone as well as hormones involved in glucose metabolism such as insulin (and C-peptide) and glucagon. If oral acetaminophen administration is used as an indirect marker of the gastric emptying rate following the liquid mixed meal, plasma concentrations of acetaminophen should be measured (please refer to step 8 for a detailed method description).\nOptional: Plasma glucose can be measured bedside by the glucose oxidase method (YSI 2900 Biochemistry Analyzer) from blood collected in fluoride heparin-coated tubes and centrifuged immediately for 30 s.\nNote: Sensations of hunger, satiety, prospective food consumption, fullness, nausea, comfort, and thirst are rated on 100 mm visual analog scales. The reproducibility of this method has previously been validated in healthy men7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] and is often used in studies assessing appetite and satiety sensations.\nOptional: Measurements of resting energy expenditure and respiratory quotient by indirect calorimetry, protein turnover by renal urea excretion, and/or brown adipose tissue thermogenesis using a thermal imaging camera may be implemented in the study design and sampling scheme. For complete details on the use of these methods, please refer to.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] For thermal imaging, the room temperature should be similar on all experimental days and registered. Ideally, a climatic chamber with a constant temperature should be used, but similar room temperatures can also be obtained by standard air conditioning.",
    "Start the intravenous infusion of either the exogenous hormone or placebo at time point 0 min.\nOptional: It is suggested to take a small sample from the infusion bag before initiating the infusion and after the infusion is terminated, which may be used to measure the concentration of the infused hormone in specific cases, i.e., assessment of stability, randomization issues, etc.\nCollect blood samples and perform the chosen additional analytical procedures (visual analog scale ratings, indirect calorimetry, collection of urine samples, thermal imaging camera, etc.) throughout the experimental day according to the chosen sampling scheme and specific instructions for each analytical method included.\nNote: See notes associated with step number 5 for a detailed description of suggested analytical methods to include.\nNote: Blood samples may be collected at various time points. In this case, blood samples were collected at time points −35, −10, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 135, 165, 195 and 255 min (for all blood-based analyses) as well as at time points 120, 150, 180 and 225 min (for analysis of plasma glucose only) using a syringe.\nCritical: After each blood sampling it is important to infuse approximately 2 mL of saline into the intravenous catheter for blood sampling to avoid blood clotting in the catheter. Just prior to collecting the next blood sample, it is crucial to discard the first ml of blood to avoid dilution of the subsequent blood sample.\nPrepare and give a liquid mixed meal to the participant approximately 60–90 min after the start of the infusion (time point 60–90 min) depending on the length of the chosen fasting period.\nNote: The liquid mixed meal should be consumed evenly throughout 5 min.",
    "Optional: Admix 1,000–1,500 mg acetaminophen dissolved in 50–100 mL water to the liquid mixed meal for assessment of postprandial plasma concentrations of acetaminophen as an indirect marker of the gastric emptying rate, as previously validated.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nNote: We suggest adjusting the size (energy content) of the liquid mixed meal to the body weight of each participant measured on the first experimental day, e.g., an energy content of 2,400 kJ for an 80 kg person (2.97 mL/kg body weight) when applying the suggested standardized liquid meal (1,010 kJ, 29.7 g carbohydrate, 9.6 g protein and 9.3 g fat per 100 mL). If feasible, the meal volume should be adjusted to lean body mass only, particularly in cohorts with large variations in body composition between included subjects.\nServe a standardized ad libitum meal together with 400–500 mL of water approximately 200 min after giving the liquid mixed meal (time point 260–290 min depending on the time point for serving the liquid mixed meal).\nInstruct the participant to eat as much as they can until they feel comfortably full.\nNote: The ad libitum meal should be consumed within a maximum of 30 min.\nNote the weight of the meal before it is served.\nCritical: Serve the ad libitum meal in undisturbed surroundings without distraction from mobile phones, other persons, etc. Furthermore, to reduce any psychological and physiological factors affecting food intake,10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] verbal instructions for the meal test, the room used for eating, and heating time of the meal and the bowl should be similar in the two experimental days.\nNote: It is suggested to instruct the participant to eat directly from the bowl containing approximately 2,000–2,500 g of the standardized ad libitum meal to ensure that no participant is close to finishing the meal.",
    "Discontinue the infusion of exogenous hormone or placebo when the participant feels comfortable full marking the end of the ad libitum meal (at latest, time point 290–320 min depending on the time point for serving the ad libitum meal).\nNote the time spent eating, the weight of the meal after eating, water intake during the meal, and the total infusion volume during the experimental day.\nCalculate the total caloric intake and caloric intake per kg body weight."
