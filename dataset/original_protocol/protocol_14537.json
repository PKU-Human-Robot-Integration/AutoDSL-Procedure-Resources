    "All surgical procedures performed on animals should be carried out in accordance with Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals13 or other appropriate ethical guidelines. Protocols should be approved by the animal welfare committee at the appropriate institution before proceeding.\n1. Preparing for the ECG\nNOTE: Before beginning, don personal protective equipment including gloves, eyewear and a clean laboratory coat or disposable gown.\nClean the ECG pad using a non-alcohol and non-bleach based decontamination solution. Gently use a delicate task wipe to blot off excess solution to ensure that the electrode pad does not become damaged.\nIf the ECG pad has a heating feature, use it. Anesthetized mice tend to lose body heat rapidly. Heat the pad to 40-42 °C to maintain normothermic body temperature of 37 °C throughout the surgery14. Monitor body temperature using a rectal thermometer. Adjust pad temperature as necessary to maintain the body temperature ~37 °C.\nAs most thoracotomies are performed with the mouse lying on its back (supine), ensure that the toggle is flipped to the \"supine\" setting. Many ECG pads have a function to toggle between prone and supine positions. Failure to select the right orientation can result in misrepresentation of electrocardiographic events.\nAnesthetize mouse using 5% inhaled isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen. Once mouse is anesthetized, transfer mouse to ECG pad equipped with an anesthesia nose-cone and reduce isoflurane to 2% and 1 L/min oxygen. Confirm proper anesthesia by ensuring mouse does not react when the mouse's foot is pinched with forceps.\nApply a thin coat of eye lubrication ointment over the mouse's eyes to prevent dryness and corneal damage while anesthetized.",
    "Clean the mouse's paws with a wet wipe to remove all visible bedding that may be stuck to the paws or may interfere with the transmission of electrical impulses from the paws to the ECG pad. Dry paws with a wipe.\nApply a small amount (slightly smaller than a USD dime) of highly conductive electrolyte gel to each of the four metallic electrodes on the ECG pad.\n\tNote: Be sure to only apply a small amount of gel as too much gel makes it difficult to restrain the paws to the pad using tape. Additionally, paws are likely to slip out of the restraint during surgery if they were wet before applying tape.\nWith the mouse in supine position, use clear medical tape to restrain each paw to its corresponding electrode (Figure 1). First press each paw to its piece of tape and then adhere the tape to the ECG pad. Ensure that each restrained paw is in contact with the electrolyte gel and the electrode.\n2. Acquiring the ECG\nDepending on the equipment used for ECG acquisition, configure the machine so that the ECG waveform can be visualized in real time. For ECG recordings using the physiologic monitoring settings on an echocardiography machine, a live B-mode image will have the ECG waveform running along the bottom of the screen.\n\tNote: See individual machine user guides to determine how best to configure that equipment.\nEnable real time visualization of ECG waveform by pressing the B-mode key on an echocardiography machine or the equivalent on other ECG recording devices.\n\t\nAdjust the resolution to account for differences in amplitude. If the peak of the R-wave or the trough (valley) of the Q-wave are out of the visual frame, adjust the resolution until the entire height of the waveform can be observed.",
    "Note: This can be done under the physiological settings tab on an echocardiography machine. Click the increase or decrease arrows until the entire waveform is visible.\nAny time that an image is to be obtained, clear the ECG pad of tools. Touching the mouse during ECG recording with forceps or fingers will disturb the waveform. Ensure that the mouse is still and untouched on the ECG pad before recording any ECGs.\nUse the machine's \"record\" or \"store\" feature before making any surgical incisions on the mouse. This image will be used as a baseline for comparison later on.\n3. Surgical Procedure and Recording ECG\nInject anesthetized mouse with analgesic (buprenorphine, 1.5 µg, intraperitoneal) before beginning. The details of the ischemia/reperfusion surgical procedure can also be found elsewhere5.\nRemove hair around the surgical site chemically or mechanically and disinfect the area with betadine solution. Use a scalpel to make a vertical incision parallel to the esophagus and trachea. Gently move the lymph nodes to each side of the incision until the thin tissue covering the trachea is exposed. Using forceps, gently separate the tissue until the white cartilage rings of the trachea are visible.\n\tNote: We generally use Nair hair removal lotion. The lotion is applied on the surgical site for ~1 min. Nair is then thoroughly washed off using saline or water. This method is preferred in our laboratory because high resolution echocardiography (which can detect hair follicles) is performed before and after surgery. However, caution should be taken to avoid sensitive areas such as genitals, and then thoroughly washing the Nair off to avoid potential skin burns.",
    "Quickly remove the mouse's nose from the nose-cone and insert ventilation tubing into the mouth of the mouse and towards the throat. When the tip of the ventilation tubing is visible through the exposed neck area, align the tube with the start of the trachea. Gently wiggle the tube side to side while applying upward pressure until the tubing slides into the trachea which can be confirmed visually through the translucent trachea.\nEnsure that the mouse remains anesthetized during the intubation procedure. Pause from intubation and return the mouse to the nose-cone if it begins to stir.\nUsing a loop of string, hook the mouse's two front teeth through the loop and tape the string ends to the ECG pad to steady the head of the mouse and to ensure the ventilation tubing does not move during surgery. Quickly attach ventilation tubing to rodent ventilator and adjust ventilation settings according to the weight of the mouse. Tape ventilation tubing in place.\nCover the mouse's exposed trachea with a gauze soaked in warm saline to keep tissue from drying.\nMake a vertical incision using a scalpel along the left side of the sternum.\nUsing forceps, gently separate the fascia layer from the muscle layer. Carefully cut the underlying muscle layers without cutting visible blood vessels.\nUsing forceps, grab the third rib and pull upwards gently. Maintain grip on the rib with one hand and use surgical scissors to carefully cut the intercostal tissue between the third and fourth rib. Ensure that the lungs are not damaged.\n\tNote: Lungs will retract deep into the chest cavity almost immediately after the chest cavity is punctured by the surgical incision due to the loss of the pressure gradient. Wait until the lungs have retracted before continuing.",
    "Use forceps to grab and gently separate the thin layer of pericardium which surrounds the heart.\nInsert retractors or manually use forceps as rib retractors to move the ribs into a position where the heart is visible between the ribs.\n\tNote: It is common practice to move the mouse's lower left paw so that it is overlapping the lower right paw during the placement of the ligature. This helps to position the heart so that the left atrial appendage, or auricle, is easily visible during placement of the ligature. Be aware that valid ECG waveforms will not be obtained while the lower left paw is off of the electrode. For this reason it is advisable to return the paw to its electrode after the suturing ligature is passed through the myocardial tissue but before a knot is tightened.\nLocate the LAD visually, beneath the left auricle. Swiftly insert a 7-0 silk tapered suturing needle into the myocardium deeply enough to pass under the LAD but not so deep as to penetrate the LV cavity. Pull the suturing ligature through until there is about 4 cm of suturing silk left on the free (non-needle) end of the suturing ligature.\nBegin to tie a simple suture knot. Once the free end of the suturing silk has been pulled through the loops to form the knot, pause.\nHolding both the free and needle ends of the suturing silk with forceps, insert a ~1 cm section of PE-10 tubing underneath the forming knot and atop the epicardial surface.\nIf the mouse's left paw is crossed, return the paw to its proper electrode. Tighten knot so that the PE-10 tubing is sutured to the heart. Release all physical contact with the mouse to allow ECG to be recorded.",
    "Allow ECG waveform to cycle through for ~10 sec. Check ECG waveform visually and record waveform as \"Time of Occlusion\". If the T-wave does not increase in amplitude within 1 min, reassess placement of ligature.\n\t\nIf the T-wave amplitude does not increase, either discard the animal from the study or attempt to correct the ligature placement.\nVisually check the color of the myocardium to confirm ischemic paling of the LV.\nIf ECG changes and myocardial color changes indicate ischemia, double knot the suture around the PE-10 tubing.\nCover the open chest cavity with warm saline gauze.\nRecord ECG every 5-10 min for the duration of the ischemic period.\n4. Confirmation of Reperfusion Using ECG\nRemove saline gauze covering the chest cavity and visualize the heart.\nUse a blade to cut the suturing silk atop the PE-10 tubing. Once the ligature is cut, remove the section of PE-10 tubing and gently remove the suturing ligature from the myocardium.\nRelease all physical contact with the mouse and allow the ECG waveform ~10 sec to cycle. Record waveform as \"Time of Reperfusion.\" Continue to record ECG waveforms every 5-10 min until the desired experimental time point is reached.\nAdjust resolution for changes in amplitude as needed. If the T-wave does not change upon removal of the PE-10 tubing and ligature, reperfusion is not confirmed.\n\t\nIf the T-wave does not change upon removal of tubing, either discard the animal from the study or attempt to correct the ligature placement.\nVisually inspect myocardium to additionally confirm reperfusion by return to red color.",
    "Close chest cavity by suturing the intercostal space with a 5-0 silk suture while applying gentle pressure to the mouse's chest to expel excess air that has entered during surgery. Then suture the muscle layers and finally, skin. Note: Applying pressure to the chest cavity may not be sufficient to evacuate the chest cavity of air in all mice.  Therefore, the syringe and needle method of evacuation should be employed to ensure that all air has been expelled.\nRecord the last ECG before turning inhaled anesthesia off and removing the mouse's paws from the electrodes. Increase oxygen to 2 L/min and maintain ventilation until the mouse regains consciousness.\nAllow mouse to recover in a constant temperature controlled environment, e.g. heating pad or warm incubator, to avoid infarct variability. Treat mouse with buprenorphine 24 hr after the surgery and then as needed as indicated by the mouse grimace scale.\n\tNote: Procedure for reperfusion is also discussed in detail by Xu et al.5\nSubscription Required.
