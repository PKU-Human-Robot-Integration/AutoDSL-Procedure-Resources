  "procedures": [
    "All the following animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. If unfamiliar with these procedures, please check with local/national regulations and seek veterinary advice before starting the protocol.\n1. Choosing a Suitable Strain of Animals\nNOTE: A dorsal root crush injury results in the loss of sensation and paw deafferentation. Common adverse effects of forepaw deafferentation can include over-grooming, self-mutilation, and paw autotomy.\nObtain animals for the procedure.\n\tNOTE: For rats, the more active strains, such as Lister-Hooded and Wistar, have a higher incidence of paw autotomy after deafferentation as compared to the more docile strains, such as Lewis and Sprague-Dawley. If possible, the most docile strain, Lewis, should always be considered first. Should a particularly active strain be necessary for the experiment due to genetic modification or specific behavioral assessment requirements, veterinary treatment should be in place to address expected adverse effects.\n2. Preparing the Virus for Injection\nCAUTION: Handle all viruses in accordance with biological and laboratory safety regulations.\nDilute or concentrate the virus to a titer of 2 x 1012 genome copy (GC)/mL following individual virus packaging protocols9.\n\tNOTE: Here, the virus was diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) with 5% sucrose. The titer may have to be optimized depending on the type of virus, promoter, construct size, and targeted cell type.\nOptional: Add 1% colored dye (e.g., Fast Green) to the virus solution for easy visualization of the injection later on. Mix the solution very gently.\nKeep the solution on ice for immediate use (within 4 h) or in a -80 °C freezer for long-term storage.\n3. Performing the Preoperative Preparation of the Animal\nNOTE: Due to the extreme invasiveness of the surgery, aseptic techniques should be used at all times.",
    "Prepare and sterilize all surgical tools and the spinal stereotaxic frame prior to starting the surgery. For example, sterilize the tools in an autoclave at 134 °C. Use a fresh set of sterilized tools for each animal.\nAnesthetize the animal. Confirm proper anesthetization by pinching the paw to test for the withdrawal reflex or by touching the cornea for the eyelid reflex.\n\t\nFor adult rats using inhalation anesthesia such as isoflurane, use 4% isoflurane in 2.0 L/min of oxygen for induction. For maintenance throughout the surgery, use 2 - 3% isoflurane in 1.5 L/min of oxygen, varying the isoflurane concentration according to the breathing pattern of the animal to avoid over- or under-dosing.\nOnce the animal is initially anesthetized, record the preoperative weight of the animal.\nFor the cervical DRG injection, shave off the fur on the neck from between the ears to just distal to the scapulae. Disinfect the shaved area with an antiseptic product.\nInject 2 mL of saline subcutaneously on the flank of the animal, along with an appropriate dose of analgesic (e.g., 5 mg/kg carprofen) and antibiotic (e.g., 5 mg/kg enrofloxacin).\nApply eye ointment to both the eyes to prevent corneal drying during the procedure.\nProceed to surgery on a spinal stereotaxic frame with a heating pad at 37 °C placed underneath the animal.\n4. Injecting DRG and Performing a Dorsal Root Crush Injury\nNOTE: This is an extremely delicate surgery. It is advisable to practice on a few dead animals first to familiarize with the anatomy before advancing to live animal surgery.",
    "Locate the prominent C2 and T2 spinous processes over the skin. Make a skin incision between the C2 and T2 spinous processes with a no.10 scalpel blade (once the skin is opened, a white, fibrous-tissue midline should be visible on the first layer of muscle; the first layer of muscle has a \"jelly-like\" texture).\nMake a similar-sized incision on the first layer of muscle along the white midline using a scalpel blade. Do not go beyond the prominent T2 spinous process, as there is a major arterial branch from the descending aorta located near there.\n\tNOTE: Heavy bleeding can occur anywhere from this step onwards. Always stop the bleeding and remove the blood by using sterilized cotton buds or surgical absorbable sponges to allow clear visualization at all times. Proceeding with the procedure \"blindly\" may result in unwanted damage to the spinal cord, DRG, or dorsal root, leading to unexpected adverse effects in the animal later on.\nRetract the first layer of muscle using two retractors, one placed rostrally and one caudally; the second layer of muscle, with a striated appearance, should be visible.\nLocate the midline of the second layer of muscle (where two longitudinal muscles can be observed connected by a thin, membranous tissue). Dissect the membranous tissue using a pair of microscissors to separate the two longitudinal muscles. Avoid using a scalpel blade if possible, as this may result in unnecessary muscle damage and bleeding.\nAdjust the retractors accordingly to expose the third layer of thin muscle covering the spine. The spinous processes can be felt by lightly touching with a pair of forceps over the third layer of muscle.",
    "Make a small incision on the third layer of muscle using microscissors and gently scrape off the muscle from the bone using a curette or scalpel in a sideway manner to clearly expose the vertebrae. If required, cut some of the muscle or tendon away to make the laminectomy easier.\nTo expose the left C5 - C8 DRGs, perform a left hemi-laminectomy on the C4 - T1 vertebrae by carefully removing part of the lamina and pedicle using a pair of fine rongeurs. The DRG is located near the transverse foramen of the vertebrae.\n\tNOTE: C3 - C7 vertebrae do not have a prominent spinous process. The C5 DRG is located between the C4 and C5 vertebrae, the C6 DRG is between the C5 and C6 vertebrae, and so on, while the C8 DRG is between the C7 and T1 vertebrae. There is no C8 vertebra, despite the presence of a C8 DRG and a C8 spinal cord segment.\nOnce enough of the DRG has been exposed for injection, prepare the syringe by placing the virus-filled microliter syringe fitted with a custom-made, 33-gauge blunt needle onto the stereotaxic syringe holder. Before injection, use a 30-gauge beveled needle to make a small superficial opening on each of the targeted DRG to assist with the insertion of the injection needle.\nInsert the 33-gauge needle into the center of the DRG by turning the knobs gently to adjust the stereotaxic coordinates. Do not over-insert the needle, as this may cause fluid to leak out from the ventral side of the DRG. Should leakage occur, adjust the position of the needle immediately.\n\tNOTE: The numeric stereotaxic coordinates are not used; however, it is helpful to utilize the frame to hold the needle for injection.",
    "Inject 1 µL of the virus into each DRG at 0.2 µL/min using an infusion syringe pump. Wait for an additional three minutes before withdrawing the needle. During the injection, the DRG will slowly change color if the virus solution contains a colored dye.\nTo perform a concurrent C5 - C8 dorsal root crush injury, crush each root three times for 10 s each using a pair of fine-tipped forceps (Bonn Micro), opposing the ends of the forceps completely; a white line in the tissue should appear at the crush site. Do not go deeper than required with the forceps, as this may cause damage to the ventral root.\nFollowing the injection and/or crush, make sure that there is no bleeding or small pieces of bone fragments left at the incision site before closing up the animal. If preferred, place a small piece of surgical absorbable sponge on top of the exposed spinal cord and DRG.\nAllow the third layer of the muscle to retract back naturally onto the spine without suturing. Loosely suture the two longitudinal muscles on the second layer (≈ 3 interrupted sutures) with absorbable 6-0 suture material. Suture the first layer of muscle (≈ 5 interrupted sutures) with absorbable 6-0 suture material.\nSuture the skin with absorbable 5-0 suture material (≈ 10 interrupted sutures).\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the sutures are not too tight. Bulging of the skin is a sign of over-tightening and may cause discomfort to the animal.\nIf heavy bleeding occurred during the surgery, subcutaneously inject 1 - 2 mL of saline to replenish the loss of fluid from the animal as permitted under local regulations.",
    "Provide edible hydrating gel and allow the animal to recover fully from anesthesia, performing regular monitoring for at least 1 h before returning the animal back to the holding area.\nKeep the animal for at least 3 weeks for optimal transgene expression to assess sensory axon regeneration.\n5. Performing Post-operative Care of the Animal\nProvide food mash and soft cotton bedding for the animal during the first week post-surgery. If required, administer additional doses of analgesic and antibiotic to aid with the recovery in accordance with the local/national regulations and veterinary advice.\nRemove the sutures on the skin after 7 - 10 days.\n\tNOTE: Common adverse effects of the surgery include the formation of seroma or hematoma at the incision site, scratch marks on the skin due to the itchiness caused by the internal absorbable sutures, subtle sensory or locomotion deficits, and signs of self-mutilation on the deafferented paw after the dorsal root crush injury. For any welfare issues that are substantially more severe than expected, seek immediate veterinary advice.\n6. Performing an Anterograde CTB Injection for Axonal Tracing\nNOTE: It is recommended to perform cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) axonal tracing a week prior to tissue collection.\nPrepare 1% CTB solution as per the manufacturer's instruction.\nOptional: Add 1% colored dye to the solution for easy visualization of the injection later on. Mix the solution very gently.\nAnesthetize the animal (see step 3.2.1) and stabilize the left forepaw by taping the limb to the table.\nManually and slowly inject 1 µL of 1% CTB subcutaneously into the center of the glabrous footpad and four digits using a microliter syringe fitted with a custom-made, 33-gauge short needle.",
    "NOTE: Before injection, it helps to first use a 30-gauge beveled needle to make a small superficial opening on the skin, which assists with the insertion of the injection needle.\nAllow the animal to recover fully from anesthesia before returning the animal to the holding area.\n7. Collecting Tissue\nTo collect the virus-injected DRG and spinal cord for immunohistochemistry, administer an overdose of anesthetic and transcardially perfuse the animal with phosphate-buffered saline followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Carefully perform a full laminectomy on the spine to collect the fixed tissue under a microscope. Proceed with tissue preparation, sectioning, and processing as required for analysis4,5,6.\n\tNOTE: The recovered incision site should be apparent, as observed by the presence of scar tissue.\nAlternatively, to collect the virus-injected DRG for in vitro culture, sacrifice the animal humanely with an approved method, such as a rising concentration of carbon dioxide. Carefully dissect the DRG under a microscope, ensuring aseptic conditions whenever possible. Proceed with the tissue culture as desired4,5,6,10.\nSubscription Required.
