    "**Day 0: plating cells**\nOne day before transfection, plate 6×105 293T cells in 2 ml of growth medium \\(DMEM+10%FBS) without antibiotics in 6-well plates \\(BD corning) so that they will be 80% confluent at the time of transfection.\n**Day 1: transient transfection**\nFor each transfection sample, prepare complexes as follows\n1. Dilute 4 ug plasmid DNA in 250 μl of Opti-MEM®. Mix gently. Plasmid DNA mixture includes 1.3 ug of plasmid containing plasmids expressing sgRNAs against gene-specific targeting sequenceDNA sequence of interest or an control plasmid targeting AAVS1; and 2.6 ug of plasmid containing dCas9-AID P182X \\(MO91-dCas9-AIDx)x, Cas9 or dCas9. For experiments requiring inhibiting UNG activity, transfection requiring a second component\\(pcDNA3 Ugi), 100 ng of plasmid containing Ugi that component \\(pcDNA3 Ugi) or empty vector\\(pcDNA3) was also transfected.\n  2. Mix Lipofectamine 2000 gently before use, then dilute 10 ul in 250 μl of Opti-MEM®. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. \n  3. After 5 minute5-minute incubation, combine the diluted DNA with diluted Lipofectamine 2000. Mix gently and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. \n  4. Add the 500 μl of complexes to a well containing cells and medium. Mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth.\n  5. Incubate cells at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 24 hours.\n  \n**Day 2: drug selection**\n24 hours after the transient transfection, passage the cells and add puromycin and blasticidin to select for transfected cells. .\n1. Wash cells once with 1 ml PBS to remove excess medium and serum. \n  2. Add 0.3 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA trypsin/versene \\(EDTA) solution to the monolayer and incubate 1 minute at room temperature until the cells detach. \n  3. Add 1 ml of complete medium to stop trypsinization.",
    "4. Transfer cells to a 1.5 ml EP tube and cCentrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells.\n  5. Remove the supernatant, re-suspend cells in complete medium.\n  6. Divided the cells into two wells in a 6-well plate.\n  7. Add 2 ug/ml puromycin and 20ug/ml blasticidin to select for transfected cells.\n  8. Move the plate back and forth to plate the cells and the drugs evenly.\n  \n**Day 4: reduced drug selection**\n1. Change the medium withReplenish the cells with the fresh medium. \n  2. Add 1 ug/ml puromycin and 10ug/ml blasticidin to maintain the selection.\n  3. Mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth.\n  Day 7: harvest the transfected cells\n1. Wash cells once with 1 ml PBS to remove excess medium and serum. \n  2. Add 0.3 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTAtrypsin/versene \\(EDTA) solution to the monolayer and incubate 1 minute at room temperature until cells detach. \n  3. Add 1 ml of complete medium to stop trypsinization. \n  4. Transfer cells to a 1.5 ml EP tube and cCentrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells.\n  5. Remove the supernatant, re-suspend cells in PBS.\n  6. centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells.\n  7. Extract genomic DNA or store the pellet at – 80℃.\n  \n**Isolation of genomic DNA**\nThe genomic DNA is extracted with MicroElute Genomic DNA Kit \\(Omega) following to the manufacturer’s instruction.\n1 . Re-suspend the sample cell pellet volume to with100ul with PBS Buffer.\n2. Add 20 ul of Protease solution and mix well by vortexing.\n  3. Add 120 ul Buffer BL and vortex to mix. Incubate at 70℃ for 10 minutes. If the cells are too few, 4 ul of Linear acrylamide is recommended to be added to each sample.",
    "4. Add 120 ul absolute ethanol and mix thoroughly by vortexing for 15s at maxi speed. Bring down any liquid drop from inside of lid by brief centrifugation.\n  5. Assemble a HiBind® MicroElute column in a 2 ml collection tube \\(provided).\n  6.Transfer the entire solution from Step 4 into the column, including any precipitate that may have formed. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min to bind DNA. Discard the collection tube and flow-through liquid.\n7. Place the column into a new collection tube \\(supplied). Add 500 ul of Buffer HB in the column. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and re-use collection tube.\n  8. Place the column into the same 2 ml tube \\(supplied) and wash by pipetting 650 ul of DNAWash Buffer diluted with ethanol. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min. Again, dispose of collection tube and flow-through liquid.\n  Note: DNA Wash Buffer Concentrate must be diluted with absolute ethanol before use. Refer to label on bottle for directions or on Page 3 for preparation.\n9. Using a new collection tube, wash the column with a second 650 ul of DNA Wash Buffer diluted with ethanol and centrifuge as above. Discard flow-through and re-use the collection tube.\n  10. Using the same 2ml collection tube, centrifuge empty column at maximum speed \\(≥ 20,000 x g) for 3 min to dry the HiBind® membrane. This step is crucial for ensuring optimal elution in the following step.\n  11. Place the column into a sterile 1.5 ml microfuge tube and add 10-50 ul of preheated \\(70℃) Elution Buffer or water onto the center of the membrane.\n  Allow tubes to sit for 3 min at room temperature.",
    "12. To elute DNA from the column, centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 1 min.\n  Note: Incubation at 70oC rather than at room temperature will give a modest increase in DNAyield per elution. Alternatively the second elution may be performed using the first eluate or using the second 10-50ìl of preheated Elution Buffer or water.\n13. The DNA concentration is measured with NanoDrop.\n  \n**Primary PCR amplification**\nWork on ice unless stated otherwise.\n1.
