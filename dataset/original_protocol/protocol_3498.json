Steps 1 and 2 are used for\n      preparation of cell nuclei from embryos, while steps 3 and 4 are used for seedlings.\nApproximately 200 embryos at the late-cotyledon stage were collected with a 1 mL injection syringe under a\n        dissecting microscope at 25°C. The collected embryos were placed on a 3.5 cm diameter round dish supplemented\n        with B5 agar media (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The B5 agar will keep the embryos alive. The dissected\n        embryos were transferred into a 12 cm long square dish with 500 μL pre-chilled lysis buffer on ice.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/418-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Generation of nuclei suspension\n(A) The Arabidopsis embryos at the late-cotyledon stage were collected on the B5 agar.\n(B) The nuclei lysis suspension of embryos after filtering.\n(C) The 3-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were collected on the B5 agar.\n(D) The nuclei lysis suspension of seedlings after filtering.\nFinely chop embryos with a double-sided blade to release nuclei on ice in fume hood.\nNote: The embryos naturally settle at the bottom of the lysis buffer, so we can\n      collect the materials together and repeatedly cut them. Due to the small volume of embryos, please cut them\n      repeatedly to release more nucleus until the color of the lysis buffer is yellow-green (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), which should take approximately 10 min. 200 embryos should provide a sufficient\n      number of nuclei.\n    \nApproximately 3-day-old 150 - 200 seedlings grown on B5 agar were collected with forceps at RT. The seedlings\n        were transferred to a 12 cm long square dish with 500 μL pre-chilled lysis buffer on ice.\nFinely chop seedlings with a double-sided blade to release nuclei on ice in fume hood.",
    "Note: For seedlings, 5 min of chopping is enough. The color of the lysis buffer\n      will be bright green after chopping.\n    \nFilter the slurry through a 40 μm filter into 15 mL collection tubes on ice. Rinse the petri dish with 1.5 mL\n        lysis buffer and filter into the same 15 mL collection tube. The final nuclei suspension is about 2 mL in volume\n        and the color should appear yellow-green.\nCritical: For acquiring more intact nuclei, we recommend extensively chopping\n      plant materials in lysis buffer rather than grinding them in liquid nitrogen which leads to more tissue fragments\n      that will disturb FACS.\n    \nFACS of cell nuclei\nTiming: 1–5 h\n    \nThis step describes the procedure for sorting nuclei by FACS.\nThe nuclei suspensions are stained with DAPI for flow cytometric analysis. Set up an unstained control without\n        DAPI.\nNote: It is not necessary to estimate the density of nuclei suspension in this\n      step because we will sort ∼50,000 nuclei per replicate to ensure repeatability. The amount of nuclei suspension\n      required for control samples is flexible. The purpose of control is to determine the appropriate voltage needed to\n      exclude the interference of other particles.\n    \nAdd 2 μL of 1 mg/mL DAPI to the nuclei suspension in a sample tube, flick gently to mix.\nSelect parameters including FSC-A (forward scatter-A, particle size), SSC-A (side scatter-A, internal\n        complexity), DAPI-A (intensity of DAPI staining), and DAPI-W (voltage pulse width).\nUse the unstained control and stained samples to set appropriate photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages and\n        adjust compensations on a BD FACSAria II cell analyzer.\nCreate gates for the samples according to the position of 2C or 4C nuclei (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/418-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gate set for FACS\n(A) FACS histogram of embryo nuclei suspension. The DAPI-A-2C and 4C represent cell ploidy with 2 times",
    "and 4 times, respectively. Only DAPI-A-2C cell nuclei was sorted.\n(B) FACS histogram of seedling nuclei suspension. The DAPI-A-2C, -4C, and -8C represent cell ploidy with\n              2 times, 4 times, and 8 times, respectively. All DAPI-A-2C, -4C, and -8C cell nuclei were sorted.\nAdd 500 μL of lysis buffer to a 10 mL BD collect tube and collect a total of 50,000 events per sample (each\n        sample per tube). The nozzle size, psi, and sorting speed of FACS are 70 μm, 70, and 1, respectively.\nNote: 200 embryos and 150–200 3-day-old seedlings are enough material for getting\n      50,000 nuclei.\n    \nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: Since we cannot see the pellet at the bottom of the tube after\n      centrifugation, please leave ∼50 μL of liquid to avoid nuclei loss when discarding the supernatant.\n    \nPipette 1 mL of pre-chilled wash buffer into the centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant as much as possible.\nNote: Immature embryo cells at late-cotyledon developmental stage rarely divide.\n      DAPI-A detected nuclei almost with 2C from FACS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The nuclei were sorted into lysis\n      buffer as plant nuclei do not remain intact in PBS buffer that is used for FACS.\n    \nATAC-seq library constructing\nTiming: 5–8 h\n    \nThis step describes the procedure for generation of ATAC-seq library.\nWe use the TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for Illumina including 5× TTBL and TTE Mix V50 (Vazyme, TD50102; see\n      manual at http://www.vazymebiotech.com/products_detail/productId=70.html[href=http://www.vazymebiotech.com/products_detail/productId=70.html])\n      to construct ATAC-seq libraries. We use the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit including Buffer PB, PE and EB (Qiagen)\n      to purify transposed DNA.\nPrepare the transposition master mix in a 200 μL Lobind tube (Eppendorf) on ice. Add reagents in the order\n        shown below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_418_3.csv",
    "Note: The volume of nuclei suspension after step 14 is variable. Please sure that\n      the remaining nuclear suspension is less than 34.5 μL since the total reaction volume for transposition is 50 μL.\n      It is not necessary to optimize reaction conditions (e.g., transposition time) when working with different initial\n      volumes or numbers of nuclei.\n    \nDispense master mix into a PCR tube containing nuclear suspension. Pipette to mix.\nLoad the tube into a thermal cycler pre-warmed to 37°C and incubate for 30 min with occasional gentle mixing\n        to keep the nuclei in suspension.\nAdd 3–5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample.\nTransfer the mixture to a spin column that is situated in a provided 2 mL collection tube.\nCentrifuge at 13,523 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the flow-through and add 750 μL of Buffer PE to the spin column.\nCentrifuge at 13,523 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the flow-through and centrifuge the column for an additional 2 min.\nPlace column in a clean 1.5 mL DNA Lobind microcentrifuge tube and add 11 μL of buffer EB to the center of the\n        column for 2 min.\nCentrifuge at 13,523 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nPause Point: Samples can be safely stored overnight at 4°C or −20°C.\n    \nWe use the TruePrep DNA Index Kit V2 for Illumina sequencing (Vazyme) and NEBNext high-fidelity PCR mix to\n      amplify transposed DNA.\nPrepare the PCR amplification mix in a 0.2 mL PCR tube on ice as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_418_4.csv\nIncubate the reaction in a thermo cycler with the following PCR program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_418_5.csv\nTo determine the number of additional PCR cycles needed to adequately amplify the DNA library, prepare the\n        quantitative PCR (qPCR) Library Amplification Mix as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_418_6.csv",
    "Incubate the reaction in a qPCR thermocycler with the following PCR program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_418_7.csv\nTo determine the optimal number of cycles needed to amplify the remaining 45 μL of each library, view the\n        linear fluorescence versus cycle number plot on the qPCR machine once the reaction is finished. The cycle number\n        at which the fluorescence for a given reaction is at 1/3 of its maximum is the number of additional cycles (N)\n        that each library requires for adequate amplification (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/418-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic diagram of qPCR\nThe maximum of fluorescence is 2,000. As such, one-third of the maximum is ~666, and the number of PCR\n              cycles should be 9 (red line).\nIncubate the remaining reaction in a thermocycler with the following PCR program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_418_8.csv\nAdd 67.5 μL (1.5× of sample volume) resuspended Ampure XP beads to the PCR reaction. Mix well by pipetting up\n        and down at least 10 times. Alternatively, samples can be mixed by vortexing for 3–5 s.\nNote: If Ampure XP beads are stored at 4°C, please pre-warm to 25°C for at least\n      30 min and vortex before use.\n    \nIncubate samples on the bench for at least 5 min at 25°C.\nPlace the tube on an appropriate magnetic stand to separate the beads from the supernatant. Quickly centrifuge\n        the sample to collect the liquid from the sides of the tube before placing it on the magnetic stand if\n        necessary.\nAfter 5 min, carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the beads that contain\n        bound DNA.\nAdd 200 μL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the tube while in the magnetic stand.\nIncubate at 25°C for 30 s, and carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 34 and 35 once for a total of two washes.",
    "Note: Be sure to remove all visible liquid after the second wash. Briefly\n      centrifuge the tube on a benchtop centrifuge if necessary.\n    \nAir-dry the beads for up to 5 min while the tube is on the magnetic stand with the lid open.\nNote: Do not over-dry the beads. This may result in a lower recovery of DNA. Elute\n      the samples when the beads are still dark-brown and glossy looking, but when all visible liquid has evaporated.\n      When the beads turn lighter brown and start to crack, it shows beads are too dry.\n    \nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand. Elute the DNA from the beads by adding 30 μL EB buffer provided by\n        Qiagen.\nMix well by pipetting up and down 10 times, or on a vortex mixer. Incubate for at least 2 min at room\n        temperature. Quickly spin the sample to collect the liquid from the sides of the tube if necessary.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic stand for 5 min. Transfer 28 μL to a new 1.5 mL tube. Libraries can be stored\n        at −20°C. The concentration of the library can be checked by NanoDrop.\nATAC-seq library quality assessment\nThis step describes the procedure for assessment of ATAC-seq library.\nWe pipette 20 μL of library samples and send them to Novogene for library quality determination and sequencing\n      (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The library quality platform: NGS3K; Sequencing platform: HiseqPE150, paired-end.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/418-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Em, immature embryo; G3, 3-day-old\n          seedlings grown on the B5 agar plate.\nNote: If we started with 50,000 sorted nuclei, 20 μL of library sample is enough\n      for quality assessment and sequencing. Most sequencing companies perform library quality analysis before\n      sequencing."
