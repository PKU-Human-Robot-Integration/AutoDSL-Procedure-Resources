    "All protocols for mouse experiments discussed here were in accordance with institutional guidelines and approved by the Mount Sinai Medical Center Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee and Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Processing of the Sarcoma Tissue Sample, and PDX Formation\nUnder an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol, have pathology service personnel prepare sarcoma samples from surgery specimens and immediately put each sample on ice in a 100 mm Petri dish.\nPlace the sample into a 15 mL polystyrene conical tube with 6 mL of cold Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Process the tissue sample immediately.\n(Optional) For osteosarcoma only, follow the following steps, which can be skipped for soft tissue sarcoma.\nCut the tissue into 20 mm3 pieces using a scalpel. Transfer the tissue pieces to a 15 mL tube containing 3 mL of collagenase solution (RPMI 1640 with 1 mg/mL collagenase).\nPut the tube into a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min.\nThoroughly vortex the tube and, then, add 3 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS to neutralize the collagenase activity.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 350 x g at room temperature. Remove the supernatant.\nWorking in a sterile biosafety cabinet, place the tissue sample in a 100 mm Petri dish. Add 500 μL of sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the tissue. With a sterile scalpel, mechanically triturate the tissue into small pieces until no visible tissue piece is larger than 0.1 mm.\nTransfer the 500 μL cell suspension to a 35 μm cell strainer and collect the filtered suspension with a 50 mL polystyrene tube. Put this 50 mL polystyrene tube with the cell suspension on ice.",
    "Add another 500 μL of PBS to the tissue. Triturate for the second time, transfer the suspension through the cell strainer, and collect it into the same 50 mL tube.\nRepeat these steps (steps 1.5–1.6) until the tissue section is completely dissociated, usually 6x - 8x.\nPellet the cell suspension by centrifugation at 350 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet using 5 mL of hemolysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM EDTA), and incubate the solution for 5 min at room temperature to remove red blood cells.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 350 x g at room temperature and remove the hemolysis buffer. Wash the pellet with 5 mL of PBS. Centrifuge again for 5 min at 350 x g and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL of PBS and count the viable cell number using a hemocytometer or any other alternative method. Dilute the cells to a final concentration of 1 x 107 cells in 200 μL of PBS. Leave the cell suspension on ice.\nLeave the basement membrane matrix on ice to allow it to melt. Add 200 μL of basement membrane matrix to the 200 μL cell suspension. Gently mix and keep on ice.\nSubcutaneously inject the cell suspension:basement membrane matrix (1:1) mixture into two NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice into their flanks. Use 200 μL for each injection.\nMonitor the PDX formation by checking the injection site of the mice 2x a week. Remove the tumor xenograft when it reaches 1 cm in diameter.\n2. Isolation of Tumor-initiating Cells by FACS from the PDX\nSurgically remove the PDX from the mice as described previously12.",
    "Cut the tumor in half. Fix half of the xenograft with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. This is for histological analysis. Process the other half of the tissue as described above (steps 1.3–1.8) to get a tumor cell suspension.\nResuspend the pellet with PBS and count the viable cell number.\nDilute the cell suspension in PBS supplemented with 5% FBS to a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL. Leave the cell suspension on ice for 30 min. Divide the cell suspension over two tubes. Mark the tubes with isotope control and antibody, respectively. Note the number of cells in each tube.\nPrepare 2x HLA-1-PE antibody by diluting the antibody with PBS supplemented with 5% FBS (1:250). Dilute the negative isotype control antibody with the same condition. Mix the cell suspension from the “antibody” tube with diluted antibody (1:1) to make the final antibody dilution 1:500. Mix the cell suspension from the “isotope control” tube with isotope control (1:1). Put the cell suspensions on ice for 90 min.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 350 x g at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Add 10 mL of PBS to wash the pellet 2x.\nAdd 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to PBS to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. Add this DAPI solution to the cell pellet to make a cell suspension of 107 cells/mL (using the cell numbers from step 2.4).\nFilter the cell suspension through 35 μm strainer caps into 12 mm x 75 mm polystyrene tubes.\nUse a flow cytometer to sort the HLA-1-negative TIC subpopulation6. Gate viable cells (DAPI-negative) and collect both HLA-1-negative and -positive subpopulations into two 15 mL collection tubes, each containing 4 mL of RPMI 1640 culture medium.\n3. Characterization of Tumor-initiating Cells\nSarcosphere formation",
    "Make sarcosphere growth medium, using alpha-MEM cell culture medium. Add supplements to make a final concentration of B-27 supplements (1x), N2 supplements (1x), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (20 ng/mL), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (20 ng/mL) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/mL). Filter the medium with a 0.2 μm cell culture filter before use.\nPellet the sorted HLA-1-negative and -positive subpopulation from step 2.9 and count the cell numbers of each subpopulation.\nDilute 1.5 x 106 cells into 15 mL of the sarcosphere growth medium to make the cell dilution of 1 x 105 cells/mL.\nSerially dilute the cells with fresh sarcosphere growth medium to make 15 mL of each cell dilution of 104, 103, and 102 cells/mL. Then, prepare four 96-well ultra-low attachment cell culture plates, each for a cell dilution.\nTransfer 100 µL of cell suspension from the 105 cells/mL dilution to each well of the first 96-well ultra-low attachment cell culture plate. This plate has 104 cells in each well.\nUse the other three 96-well ultra-low attachment cell culture plates for the other three cell dilutions: 104, 103, and 102 cells/mL. Transfer 100 µL of cell suspension to each well of the 96-well ultra-low attachment cell culture plates. These three culture plates have 1,000 cells/well, 100 cells/well, and 10 cells/well, respectively.\nPut the plates into a 37 °C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator.\nAdd new bFGF and EGF directly to the cell culture medium (final concentration of 20 ng/mL) every three days without changing the medium to avoid cells lost in the suspension culture.\nUsing a light microscope, monitor the sarcosphere formation every day for three weeks, as shown in Figure 2A.\nAfter three weeks, count the number of sarcosphere-positive wells and sarcosphere-negative wells of each cell dilution for both HLA-1-negative and HLA-1-positive cells.",
    "Calculate the sphere-forming cell frequency based on a Poisson probability distribution13. Compare the HLA-1-negative TICs with the HLA-1-positive bulk cells.\nSerial-dilution tumor-formation assay\nCount the HLA-1-negative and -positive subpopulations from step 2.9.\nMake serial dilutions of the cells with PBS to concentrations of 106, 105, 104, and 103 cells/mL. Use 1 mL of each dilution for the tumor formation in 10 mice.\nAdd 1 mL of basement membrane matrix to the 1 mL cell suspension of each dilution (1:1). Keep the 2 mL of each mixture on ice.\nSubcutaneously inject 200 µL of the cell:basement membrane matrix mixture into the flanks of NGS mice, using HLA-1-negative cells for one flank and HLA-1-positive cells for the other flank of the same mouse. For each dilution, use 10 mice. Use 25G syringes with a needle for the injections.\nMonitor the tumor formation in the mice for four to eight weeks, depending on the rate of tumor growth.\nCalculate the tumor-initiating cell frequency by the percentage of tumor formation at different input cell numbers. Compare the HLA-1-negative TICs with the HLA-1-positive bulk cells.\nInduced differentiation along mesenchymal pathways\nUse the sarcospheres formed during previous steps (step 3.1.9). Transfer the sarcospheres to a new 6-well plate. Culture the sarcosphere with 2.5 mL of alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS to let the cells attach to the culture plate surface.\nAfter an attachment for two days, switch the culture medium from alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS to the 1:1 mixture of alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) growth medium.\nAfter two days, switch to complete hMSC growth medium.",
    "When the cells reach 90% confluency, aspirate the hMSC medium and add differentiation medium. For osteogenic differentiation, add osteogenic differentiation medium (hMSC growth medium supplemented with 10 nM dexamethasone, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 µg/mL L-ascorbic acid, and 10 mM lithium chloride). For lipogenic differentiation, add adipocyte differentiation medium (hMSC growth medium supplemented with 0.5 µM dexamethasone, 0.5 µM isobutylmethylxanthine, and 50 µM indomethacin).\nChange the differentiation medium every three days.\nAfter three to four weeks, stop the differentiation and wash the cells with PBS. Then, aspirate the PBS and add 2 mL of 10% formalin to the cells for fixation. Let the cells sit for 45 min at room temperature. Wash them with deionized water. The cells are now ready for Alizarin Red S staining (step 3.3.6.1) or Oil Red O staining (step 3.3.6.2).\n\t\t\nTo detect osteogenic differentiation, perform Alizarin Red S staining. Aspirate water and add 2 mL of Alizarin Red S working solution (2% Alizarin Red S, pH 6.0) to the cells, and let them sit for 5 min for staining. Wash the cells with deionized water and observe the reaction microscopically.\nTo detect adipogenic differentiation, perform Oil Red O staining.\n\t\t\t\nMake an Oil Red O solution. Prepare a stock solution by adding 300 mg of Oil Red O powder to 100 mL of isopropanol.\nWithin 2 h before using, mix three parts (30 mL) of Oil Red O stock solution with two parts (20 mL) of deionized water. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 min at room temperature.\nFilter the working solution using before use.\nRemove the water from the cells prepared according to step 3.3.6. Add 2 mL of 60% isopropanol to cover the cell monolayer and the cells sit for 2 min.",
    "Remove the isopropanol and add 2 mL of Oil Red O working solution. Allow the cells to sit for 5 min at room temperature.\nRinse the cells with deionized water and observe the reaction under a light microscope."
