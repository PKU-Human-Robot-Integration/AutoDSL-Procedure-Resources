    "Cell culture Retrieve one aliquot of 106 INS-1E cells from liquid nitrogen storage and thaw them slowly at room temperature. Once the cells have warmed enough to be safely handled, the tube can be further warmed by rolling it back and forth between the hands. CAUTION:  Liquid nitrogen is cold enough to cause skin damage in cases of prolonged contact. Wear appropriate PPE when handling liquid nitrogen.Once thawed, work under a laminar flow hood and maintain aseptic conditions. Transfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube and add 10 mL of growth medium, pre-warmed to 37 °C. Centrifuge the cells at 500× g for 5 min at room temperature and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the 106 cells in 10 mL of 37 °C complete growth medium and transfer to a 100 mm tissue culture dish. Store the culture dish inside of the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.After two days, passage the cells:Remove the old growth medium and rinse with 2 × 5 mL of 37 °C HBSS.After removing the HBSS, add 2 mL of 37 °C trypsin and incubate the cells for 5 min at 37 °C.Retrieve the cells and inactivate the trypsin with 5 mL of 37 °C growth medium.Collect the cells in a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 500× g for 5 min at room temperature.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of 37 °C growth media.Transfer the cells to a new tissue culture dish and return them to the incubator.Check on the cells daily until 80% confluency is reached and passage again.After three passages, evenly split the cells (15 × 106 cells) into two 100 mm culture dishes.After two days, check the confluency. If the cells are below 80% confluency, wait another day.",
    "Once the cells have reached ≥ 80% confluency (≥ 15 × 106 cells), transfer the cells from one 100 mm culture dish into a 150 mm culture dish. Split the second culture dish into two 100 mm culture dishes (7.5 × 106 cells each).One dish serves as a reserve for continuing the culture growth, and the other serves as a source of cells to produce GPMVs. Maintain these as normal in the incubator, changing the medium and splitting the cells as necessary.Allow the cells in the 150 mm culture dish to reach ≥ 80% confluency (≥ 33 × 106 cells) and split them evenly into two 150 mm culture dishes. These two 150 mm culture dishes will be used to produce GPMVs in the next steps. Maintain these two 150 mm culture dishes in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.This process is graphically summarised in Figure 1.Note: Working under aseptic conditions is essential here to avoid contaminating the cell culture. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4838/bioprotoc-13-19-4838-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of cell culture and splitting to prepare cells for giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) production GPMV formation Retrieve the two 150 mm culture dishes from the incubator once they reach 80% confluency (33 × 106 cells). Discard the old growth medium and wash the cells twice with 10 mL of 37 °C HBSS.Discard the HBSS and wash the cells twice with 10 mL of 37 °C wash buffer.Discard the wash buffer and add 5 mL of 37 °C GPMV buffer to the cells.Note: The GPMV buffer must be prepared fresh before each use, as the NEM is unstable in solution for prolonged periods of time. NEM was chosen as the GPMV-inducing agent due to its potent ability to induce GPMV formation and its low impact on peptide aggregation.",
    "Unlike other GPMV-inducing agents, NEM does not crosslink proteins but rather alkylates free cysteines (Scott, 1976; Erdinc Sezgin, 2022; I. Levental et al., 2010; K. R. Levental and Levental, 2015). Incubate the cells in the GPMV buffer for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Retrieve the two 150 mm culture dishes from the incubator and carefully collect the liquid above the cells containing the GPMVs in one 15 mL conical tube per culture dish.Centrifuge the GPMVs at 500× g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet any cell debris. Transfer the supernatant containing the GPMVs to two empty 15 mL conical tubes.GPMVs labelling To one 15 mL conical tube with the GPMVs, add 5 μL of the FAST-DiO solution (1 mg/mL) for a final concentration of 1 μg/mL and gently rock the tube back and forth for 10 s to mix it. To the second tube, add 2 μL of FAST-DiI solution (1 mg/mL) for a final concentration of 0.4 μg/mL and rock the tube back and forth gently for 10 s to mix.Note: FAST-DiO and FAST-DiI stock solutions are light sensitive. To avoid degradation of the fluorophores, work in a dimly lit environment. Incubate the GPMVs for 1 h at 37 °C to complete the labelling.Recover the two tubes from the incubator and transfer the contents of each tube to a 100 kD Amicon centrifugal filter unit to concentrate the GPMVs and to reduce the amount of any unincorporated tracers.Centrifuge the Amicon units at 400× g for 1 min and verify the volume remaining in the filter unit, ensuring that the entire volume does not pass through. Repeat these short centrifugations until 500 μL remain in each unit.This process is graphically summarised in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4838/bioprotoc-13-19-4838-g002.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Workflow for the isolation and labelling of giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) formed from cultured cells Carefully recover the GPMVs retained in the filter unit using a P200 pipette, transferring the labelled membranes into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes. The GPMVs prepared this way should be used within 48 h and can be stored at 4 °C if needed.Note: While FAST-DiO and FAST-DiI are not particularly sensitive to photodegradation after being incorporated into the membranes, it is good practice to nonetheless avoid unnecessary exposure to ambient light. Total phosphorus assay In order to ensure experimental reproducibility and to accurately quantify the ratio between GPMVs and peptide, the concentration of phospholipids in the GPMV suspension can be measured through the total phosphorus assay.Preheat an aluminium block to 210 °C on a hot plate.Prepare a calibration curve using the phosphate standard reagent using 12 mm × 75 mm glass tubes. See Table 1 for the quantities suggested.Table 1. Phosphorus quantities of PO43- standard table:",
    "﻿0,1\nQuantity of P (μmol),Volume of PO43- standard (μL)\n0.00000,0\n0.00650,10\n0.01625,25\n0.03250,50\n0.04875,75\n0.06500,100",
    "Transfer 100 μL of each GPMV suspension to 12 mm × 75 mm glass tubes.Add 450 μL of 8.9 N H2SO4 to all tubes.For each standard and sample to be analysed, puncture a plastic stopper five times with an 18 G needle to prevent the buildup of pressure during the next steps.Heat the tubes on the aluminium block for 25 min, ensuring that the temperature remains between 200 and 220 °C. This reaction serves to digest the organic matter in the samples.Remove the tubes and cool for 5 min until they can be handled. Add 150 μL of H2O2 to each tube, cap, and heat at the same temperature for 30 min. This reaction serves to remove any dark coloration that may develop in the reaction tubes due to the digestion of organic material.Remove the tubes from heat and allow them to cool at room temperature. Meanwhile, prepare a 100 °C water bath by bringing a metal bowl of water to a boil on the hotplate.Note: It is important that the bowl is large enough to place all the reaction tubes inside at the same time. This can be accomplished using a plastic test tube rack. Transfer the residual liquid in each tube to a clean 16 mm × 150 mm glass tube using a P1000 micropipette.Add 500 μL of 10% ascorbic acid, 500 μL of 3.5% ammonium molybdate (IV), and 3.9 mL of nanopure water.Gently vortex the samples, cover each tube with a glass marble, and heat in the water bath for 7 min. Here, the reduction of the mixture by ascorbic acid permits the colorimetric reaction between phosphorus and ammonium molybdate.Allow the tubes to cool for 5 min before transferring 200 μL of each into a 96-well microplate.",
    "Measure the absorbance in each well at 820 nm and calculate the concentration of phosphate using a linear regression. See the section on data analysis for details. CAUTION:  Hot H2SO4 and H2O2 are caustic and should be handled with care. Use gloves, lab coat, safety glasses, and work inside of a chemical fume hood.FRET kinetics Using the phospholipid concentrations obtained from D, prepare dilutions of the GPMVs at 2× concentrations (100, 25, and 6.25 μM) in the GPMV buffer.Transfer 50 μL of each mixed GPMV suspension to a 96-well microplate (black, non-binding surface with clear bottom) in triplicate. IMPORTANT:  It is crucial to prepare the appropriate blanks to be able to normalise the data afterwards.To each GPMV sample, add 50 μL of either GPMV buffer (blanks), IAPP freshly solubilised at 25 μM in GPMV buffer, or rat IAPP (control peptide) freshly solubilised at 25 μM in GPMV buffer.Cover the microplate with the silicone lid to prevent evaporation.In the plate reader, measure the fluorescence due to FRET every 10 min (λexcitation = 485 nm, λemission = 570 nm). Program the kinetics to perform a single agitation for 5 s and then record the fluorescence intensity from the bottom of the plate at 10 min intervals for 24 h with gain at the medium setting.Note: While this protocol has been developed to detect plasma membrane damage associated with amyloidogenic peptides, it is likely to work with other, non-amyloidogenic peptides as well. Additionally, the aggregation of amyloidogenic peptides is likely sensitive to the number of measurements made during the experiment. It is therefore strongly recommended being consistent in the number of wells measured and the frequency at which the data points are collected."
