    "Experiments were approved by the University of Guelph's Animal Care Committee (AUP #3700), conducted in compliance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines, and reported in accordance with ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments)20 requirements.\n1. Experiment preparation\nExperimental design (see Table 1).\n\tNOTE: This behavioral test is a scent-based Go/Go digging task, in which mice have to dig for high- or low-value rewards. It uses a rectangular arena (Figure 1) with two arms, in which one arm is scented while the other one is unscented. As outlined below, mice are trained to discriminate between positive and negative odor cues before being presented with an ambiguous odor mixture.\n\t\nPseudorandomly assign cages to mint or vanilla positive discriminative stimulus (DS+) groups as follows.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol has only been validated for mice assigned to vanilla DS+ odor mixture (see Representative Results and Resasco et al.19 for details). However, pilot tests are strongly recommended to confirm that the DS+, DS-, and ambiguous mixtures meet requirements for valid JB assessment (steps 4.7.3 and 5.3). Thus, the methods outlined here include the testing of both a vanilla and a mint DS+, to provide an example of a group that successfully meets requirements for assessment of JB (the vanilla DS+ mice) and a group that fails to do so (the mint DS+ mice). Prior pilot tests would identify this type of problem in advance.\nMint DS+ mice: for these mice, during arena setup for training (see step 1.4 below), mark scent dispensers and pots containing a high-value reward with the mint odor cue, and those containing no reward with the vanilla odor cue.",
    "Vanilla DS+ mice: for these mice, during arena setup for training (see step 1.4 below), mark scent dispensers and pots containing a high-value reward with the vanilla odor cue, and those containing no reward with the mint odor cue.\n\t\tNOTE: This task consists of reinforced training trials and unreinforced test trials. During unreinforced test trials, no rewards are accessible to the mice (see step 1.4.3 below) and the ambiguous odor cue for both mint and vanilla DS+ mice is the same 1:1 mint/vanilla mixture.\nPseudorandomly assign cages to left or right scented arm groups (counterbalancing across DS+ odor groups) as follows.\nLeft: for these mice, during arena setup for training and testing (see step 1.4 below), mark the left arm with the appropriate DS+ or DS- odor cue and ensure the right arm is always unscented (marked only with distilled water).\nRight: for these mice, during arena setup for training and testing (see step 1.4 below), mark the right arm with the appropriate DS+ or DS- odor cue and ensure the left arm is always unscented (marked only with distilled water).\nRandomly assign each animal a \"blind code\" as follows.\n\t\tNOTE: Blinding allows the researcher handling the mice and scoring their behavior to remain unaware of the animal ID or treatment, avoiding undesirable subjective bias. This is a mandatory step to comply with the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines and other reference documents20.\nAdd a column for blind code in a spreadsheet containing each animal ID and the corresponding treatment they have been assigned to.\nRandomly assign each animal a unique code (e.g., a letter and number combination \"A2\") that is unrelated to cage number or treatment.",
    "NOTE: All randomization should be conducted using a random number generator (e.g., Random.org). During this randomization step, counter-balance across treatment, strain, etc., where applicable. Have this done by a research assistant who will remain \"unblind\" to treatment throughout experiments. This individual must not collect data during testing, to avoid biased assessments.\nDuring all data collection, provide the \"blind\" researcher who is live- and video-scoring latency to dig and digging duration with only the animal's blind code to keep the researcher blind to treatment.\n\t\tNOTE: Spreadsheets used during data collection will only include the animal's blind code and the corresponding latency to dig and digging duration for each trial. At the end of the experiments, the corresponding animal ID and treatment information can be added to the spreadsheet, thus \"unblinding\" researchers for data analyses.\nMaterial preparation.\n\t\nHigh-value food rewards: break dried sweetened banana chips into approximately 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm pieces by hand.\nLow-value food rewards: using a cutting board and knife, cut rodent chow (from animals' regular diet) into approximately 0.125 cm3 pieces.\n\t\tNOTE: Pilot tests to identify high- and low-value rewards should be conducted prior to starting the task.\nMint and vanilla essences: Using a 1 mL syringe or micropipette, add mint and vanilla extract into labeled centrifuge tubes. Dilute extracts 1:4 with distilled water and mix by inverting several times. Make these daily and invert repeatedly before use to ensure that the mixtures are fresh and consistent.\nAmbiguous odor mixture: after mint and vanilla essences have been diluted, add equal volumes to a centrifuge tube (creating a 1:1 mixture of the diluted essences). Make these on the day of testing responses to ambiguous odor mixture, and invert repeatedly before use to ensure that the mixture is fresh and consistent.",
    "NOTE: Pilot tests to identify appropriate dilutions and intermediate odor mixtures are strongly encouraged to ensure the utility of ambiguous probes, since intensity may vary between manufacturers, batches, etc. If multiple ambiguous cues are offered, randomly assign mice to the near positive, midpoint, near negative test cues. See Discussion for further details.\nCotton pads: cut each circular cotton pad into six equal pieces (allowing them to fit within the tissue cassettes used as scent dispensers).\n\t\tNOTE: The number of high- and low-value food rewards, cotton pads, and volumes of odor mixtures will be dependent on the number of subjects being tested. Please refer to Table 1 for the number of trials per subject in each phase and Table 2 for the materials required in each trial type.\nIdentify the experimental area: Conduct training and testing on a bench in the colony room or elsewhere. Conduct all trials under red light during the dark phase when mice are active.\nPre-training (1 week prior to experiments) for digging in the home cage.\n\t\nFor each cage being tested, pour a small amount of corncob bedding into two digging pots (just enough to cover the bottom of the pot) to help treats remain in the center of the pot when being buried.\nIn one pot, place pieces of high-value reward on top of the corncob layer so that each mouse in the cage can have one piece (e.g., three pieces of banana chips for a cage of three mice). In the other pot, place pieces of low-value reward on top of the corncob layer so that each mouse in the cage can have one piece (e.g., three pieces of chow for a cage of three mice).",
    "Slowly pour corncob bedding over the treats in each pot, covering them and filling the pots to a height of 3 cm.\nSimultaneously place one high-value and one low-value pot in each cage for 10 min. After 10 min, remove the pots from all cages.\nDiscard any corncob and treats remaining in the pot. Wipe all pots thoroughly with 70% ethanol to prevent animal and cage odors from influencing future trials.\nRepeat steps 1.3.1-1.3.5 once per day for 5 consecutive days.\n\t\tNOTE: The goal of this phase is to allow all cage mates the opportunity to dig and eat a treat prior to the onset of formal training. This also facilitates habituation to food rewards.\nArena set up for training and testing.\n\t\nPlace the arena on a workbench under red light. Wipe all components of the arena, the digging pots, and scent dispensers thoroughly with 70% ethanol to remove dust and any odors from previous trials.\nPrepare the digging pots as follows.\nPlace the appropriate food rewards into the \"inaccessible compartment\" (see Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Rewards included in this compartment are dependent on which treats (if any) are buried in a given trial (see Table 2). Thus, each pot will always contain one piece of banana chip and one piece of chow across the two compartments.\n\t\t\nDS+ odor pots: during reinforced trials, place one piece of chow in the inaccessible compartment and bury one piece of banana chip in the accessible area of the pot.\nDS- odor pots: during reinforced trials, place one piece of chow and one piece of banana chip in the inaccessible compartment. No food rewards will be available in the accessible area of the pot.",
    "Unscented pots: during reinforced trials, place one piece of banana chip in the inaccessible compartment and bury one piece of chow in the accessible area of the pot.\nDuring all unreinforced test trials (positive, negative, and ambiguous), place one piece of chow and one piece of banana chip in the inaccessible compartment. No food rewards will be available in the accessible area of the pot.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This step is to prevent the scent of the buried treats from revealing which pot is rewarded. As such, the barrier between the two compartments is perforated to facilitate odor transmission.\nPour a small amount of corncob bedding into each pot to keep food rewards centered when being buried. Place one piece of the appropriate food reward (see Table 2) on top of the corncob layer and slowly pour corncob bedding over the treats, covering them and filling the pots up to a height of 3 cm.\nUsing a 1 mL syringe or micropipette, draw up 0.1 mL of the appropriate odor mixture (i.e., mint, vanilla, or ambiguous mixtures) or distilled water (see Table 2) and inject it directly on top of the corncob in a circular motion.\nPrepare scent dispensers.\n\t\t\nPlace one cotton pad piece in the base of the tissue cassette. Using a 1 mL syringe or micropipette, draw up 0.1 mL of the appropriate odor mixture (i.e., mint, vanilla, or ambiguous mixtures) or distilled water (see Table 2) and inject it onto the cotton piece. Cover the tissue cassette with its lid to enclose the scented cotton creating a scent dispenser.",
    "Place the digging pots at the ends of the arms and scent dispensers at the beginning of each arm. Insert the removable \"door\" immediately before the cassette slots to block entry to the arena arms and to create the start compartment (see Figure 1).\n\t\t​NOTE: Digging pots, scent dispensers, and syringes must be clearly labeled and only used for one scent throughout experiments to avoid unintentional mixing of odor cues (i.e., use a different set of materials for mint, vanilla, unscented, and ambiguous mixtures throughout).\n2. Digging training: 5 days, two positive trials per day (Table 2)\nFast mice for 1 h prior to training in their home cage by removing food from the hopper.\nSet up the arena for a reinforced positive trial by following the arena setup instructions above (step 1.4).\nOn Day 1 of digging training, place the food rewards on top of the 3 cm corncob bedding instead of burying them.\nProgressively bury the rewards deeper under the corncob over the following 4 days, until they are located at the bottom of the 3 cm bedding by Day 5 (i.e., Day 1: on top of corn-cob, Day 2: buried by a very thin layer of corn-cob, Day 3: buried half-way to the bottom of the pot, Day 4: buried three-quarters of the way to the bottom of the pot, and Day 5: buried at the bottom of the pot).\nMove mice from their home cage to an empty transport cage. Place a cue card with the animal's blind code on top of the transport cage so that the researcher conducting experiments remains blind to animal ID and treatment. Carry mice to the experimental area.",
    "NOTE: Steps 2.1 and 2.5 should be completed by a research assistant familiar with the mice. Subsequent steps during trials will be conducted by a researcher blind to animal ID (and treatment, if applicable). Always handle mice using cup handling (open hand) or tunnel handling (with a paper cup or plastic tunnel) to avoid the aversive effects of traditional tail handling21.\nMove mice from the transport cage to the start compartment of the arena. Remove the start \"door\", immediately lower the plexiglass lid over the arena, and start the 5-min trial timer.\n\tNOTE: If multiple mice from the same cage are being tested, this should be done simultaneously. However, the number of animals being tested at the same time will depend on the number of blind observers available; ideally, a researcher will observe and handle one animal at a time, but one individual can observe and handle two animals simultaneously, if necessary.\nLive-score latency to dig and latency to eat the reward in both arms.\n\t\nRecord latency to dig as the time at which the first occurrence of digging is observed. Digging is described as a mouse actively pushing or manipulating corncob bedding with the forepaws and/or muzzle.\nRecord latency to eat as the time at which the first occurrence of eating is observed. Eating is described as a mouse consuming a reward while holding it in the forepaws and sitting on haunches.\nWhen the trial ends, lift the plexiglass lid, and move the mouse back to its transport cage.\nDiscard all corncob bedding and treats left in the pots. Open tissue cassettes and discard cotton pieces. Wipe all components of the arena and the digging pots and scent the dispensers thoroughly with 70% ethanol.",
    "Set up the arena for a second positive trial (step 1.4). Repeat steps 2.6-2.9 for a reinforced positive trial.\nReturn the transport cage to the research assistant so mice can be placed back into their home cage.\nRepeat steps 2.1-2.11 for 5 consecutive days.\n3. Discrimination training : 10 days, four trials per day\nSet up the arena for a positive or negative trial (see Table 2) following instructions in step 1.4.\nConduct two positive and two negative trials per day following the order outlined in Table 2 (i.e., alternating positive and negative trials on days 1-5 and pseudorandom order on days 6-10).\nFollow instructions in step 2.1 at the beginning of each training day, and then follow steps 2.5-2.10. Repeat until mice have undergone four trials in total.\nReturn the transport cage to the research assistant so mice can be placed back into their home cage.\nRepeat steps 3.1-3.4 once per day for 10 days in total (i.e., two consecutive 5-day work weeks, separated by a 2-day weekend).\n4. Testing\nNOTE: Testing duration is 3-5 days (depending on the time taken for each mouse to meet learning criteria), five trials per day for the sessions in which positive and negative test trials are conducted, and three trials per day when the ambiguous test is conducted.\nFast mice for 1 h prior to training/testing in their home cage by removing food from the hopper.\nPerform one positive trial and one negative trial in a randomized order (see Table 1) by following arena setup instructions in step 1.4 and reinforced trial instructions in steps 2.5-2.10.\nPerform one video-recorded unreinforced test trial.",
    "NOTE: The unreinforced trials are identical to reinforced trials, except for the location in which the rewards are placed. Therefore, in the unreinforced trial, one piece of each high- and low-value reward are placed in the inaccessible compartment both for the scented and unscented pots.\n\t\nConduct one positive or negative test trial for each mouse daily until learning criteria are met (maximum 4 days; learning criteria is described in step 4.7.3). Ensure positive and negative test trials are conducted in alternating order across days (e.g., Day 1: positive test, Day 2: negative test, Day 3: positive test, etc.).\nFollow arena setup instructions in step 1.4.\nMove mice from the transport cage to the start compartment of the arena. Set up a video camera on a tripod so that both pots at the ends of arms are in view, and start recording. Ensure the cue card with the animal's blind code and the trial type (Positive Test or Negative Test) is recorded in the video (for reference during video scoring).\nRemove the start \"door\", immediately lower the plexiglass lid over the arena, and start the 2 min trial timer.\nWhen the trial ends, stop recording, move the camera to the side, lift the plexiglass lid, move the mouse back to their transport cage.\nDiscard all corncob bedding and treats left in the pots. Open tissue cassettes and discard cotton pieces. Wipe all components of the arena, the digging pots, and scent dispensers thoroughly with 70% ethanol.\nPerform one positive trial and one negative trial in a randomized order (see Table 1) by following arena setup instructions in step 1.4 and reinforced trial instructions in steps 2.5-2.10.\nReturn the transport cage to the research assistant so mice can be placed back into their home cage.",
    "Once all mice have completed their five daily trials, transfer videos from camera memory card to a computer for video scoring.\nScore positive and negative test trial videos on the day of testing to assess whether mice have met learning criteria. Ensure same-day video scoring since animals who meet learning criteria will undergo ambiguous tests the following day.\n\t\nUsing event recording software or a stopwatch, have the researcher who is blind to treatment record each mouse's latency to dig and digging duration in each pot during the first minute of positive and negative test trials.\nRecord latency to dig as the time at which the first occurrence of digging is observed. Digging is described as a mouse actively pushing or manipulating corncob bedding with the forepaws and/or muzzle. Record digging duration as the total time a mouse spends digging.\nCompare digging duration in the scented arm between positive (DS+) and negative (DS-) trials for each mouse to determine whether animals can discriminate the task. Consider the learning criterion to be met if digging duration in the DS+ scented arm is at least double that for the DS- scented arm during the first minute of testing (with a minimum DS+ digging duration of 3 s).\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.7 daily until mice have met the learning criterion.\n\t\nExclude individuals that have not met criterion by day 4 from ambiguous trials (and thus, judgment bias assessment).\nFor mice that have met learning criteria, test responses to the ambiguous odor mixture.\n\t\nFast mice for 1 h prior to training/testing in their home cage by removing food from the hopper.\nPerform one positive and one negative reinforced trial in a randomized order by following arena setup instructions in steps 1.4 and reinforced trial instructions in steps 2.5-2.10.",
    "Perform one video-recorded unreinforced test trial as described in step 4.3 using the ambiguous odor mixture (see Table 2).\nScore Ambiguous trial videos to assess judgment bias.\n\t\nUsing event recording software or a stopwatch, have a researcher who is blind to animal ID and treatment record each mouse's latency to dig (see step 4.7.2) in each pot during the first 1 min and 2 min of test trials.\n5. Data analysis\nNOTE: Exact analyses required will depend on the details of the experimental design. A general overview is outlined here, but researchers are strongly encouraged to refer to Gygax22 when planning analyses for animal JB experiments, and to Gaskill and Garner23 when selecting sample size (since required analyses are often too complex for a priori power analyses).\n\"Unblind\" the researcher by adding the corresponding animal ID and treatment information (e.g., enriched or conventional housing; drug or placebo etc.) for each blind code to the spreadsheet. Ensure that the resulting spreadsheet includes three rows for each animal that met the learning criteria (i.e., for the positive, negative, and ambiguous test trials) indicating latencies to dig in the scented arm.\nRun a repeated measures generalized linear mixed model, using preferred statistical software. Here, the outcome variable will be latency to dig. Ensure that the model includes Treatment (or continuous variable of interest), Trial Type, and the Treatment x Trial Type interaction as fixed effects. Include Mouse ID (nested within treatment) as a random effect. Additional terms included in the model will depend on the experimental design applied.\n\t​NOTE: If mice are group-housed (as is appropriate for this social species24) and cage mates are tested, then cage nested within treatment (if present) must be included in the model as a random effect (and Mouse ID must subsequently be nested within the cage).",
    "Plot the least-square means of latency in each trial type to confirm that the ambiguous cue presented was interpreted as intermediate (i.e., the latency least-square means estimate for the ambiguous trial should fall at a midpoint between the positive and negative latencies). Assess mouse JB only if this requirement is met.\nAssess the simple effect of treatment (or continuous variable of interest) on latency to dig in the ambiguous trial by investigating the Treatment x Trial Type interaction to determine whether mice display affect-modulated JB.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63426/63426fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Diagram of experimental apparatus.
