    "Expression of MGD1△137-6His proteinThe protein construction here described is a truncated form of MGD1 (MGD1△137-6His), deprived of its N-terminal 136 amino-acid residues and with a non-cleavable 6-histidine tag at the protein C-terminus. The deleted segment comprises the canonical N-terminal chloroplast signal peptide (res. 1-106; cleaved upon import to the organelle), and a 30-mer region predicted to be disordered, and not necessary for activity. The mgd1△137 DNA fragment was cloned at the NdeI/NotI sites of the pET29b vector (Novagen, 69872), generating the pET29b-MGD1△137-6His construct. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used as host cells for protein production. Prepare 1 L of sterile LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 µg/ml). Inoculate media with E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the pET29b-MGD1△137-6His construct. Incubate culture at 37 °C and 180 rpm.Monitor OD600nm of culture on a UV/VIS spectrophotometer. At OD600nm ~0.6-0.8, take 1 ml sample of culture for SDS-PAGE analysis (before induction - T0). Centrifuge (13,000 x g, 1 min), discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 40 µl of distilled water and 10 µl of 5x DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.Induce cells with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.25 mM. Incubate 4 h at 30 °C, 180 rpm.After induction, take 1 ml sample of culture for SDS-PAGE analysis (after induction - T4). Centrifuge (13,000 x g, 1 min), discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 80 µl of distilled water and 20 µl of 5x DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.Harvest cells by centrifugation (7,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C).Discard supernatant and store the pellet in a previously weighed 50 ml Corning tube.Weigh wet cell pellet and store at -20 °C if not immediately used (typically ~4 g/L culture).",
    "IMAC purification of MGD1△137-6His proteinResuspend cell pellet in the lysis buffer (typically 5 ml/g of cells). If cell resuspension is difficult, up to 10 ml/g of cells of lysis buffer can be used. Add Antifoam 204 (1-2 drops for ~20 ml).Disrupt cells on a Cell Disruption system at 1.5-1.8 kbar and incubate lysate for 20 min on ice. If lysate is too viscous upon disruption, add more Benzonase nuclease and/or increase incubation time on ice. Spin lysate at 45,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Recover supernatant, dilute 2x in binding/washing buffer and further clarify it by filtration using a 0.2 µm filter.Equilibrate the Histrap FF 1 ml (or 5 ml for scale-up) with 5-10 CV (column volumes) of binding/washing buffer at 1 ml/min (2 ml/min on the 5 ml column).Inject clarified lysate in the column at 1 ml/min. Collect the column flow-through.Wash column with the same buffer until Abs280nm is stable.Wash column at 1 ml/min (2 ml/min on the 5 ml column) with 5-10 CV of 8% elution buffer (40 mM imidazole) followed by 5-10 CV of 16% (80 mM imidazole) of the same solution. Elute proteins at 1 ml/min (2 ml/min for the 5 ml column) using a linear gradient from 16-100% of the same buffer (80-500 mM imidazole). Typically, gradient is performed for 10 min (15 min on the 5 ml column).Collect fractions (1 ml) throughout all purification steps.Evaluate protein purity of MGD1△137-6His containing fractions by SDS-PAGE analysis - take 16 µl of sample and add 4 µl of 5x DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading.Evaluate protein homogeneity of MGD1△137-6His containing fractions by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis (see Note 7 for details).",
    "Pool appropriate fractions and concentrate up to 20 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 20, MWCO 30,000 Da concentrator (see Note 8 for details).Monitor protein concentration by UV absorbance at 280 nm on a NanoDropTM 2000 spectrophotometer, using a sequence-derived extinction coefficient of 47,900 M-1 cm-1. Use 1:1 washing/elution buffer mix [(imidazole)final ~250 mM] as blank.Size exclusion purification of MGD1△137-6His proteinEquilibrate the Superdex S200 10/300 GL column with 2 CV (48 ml) of size exclusion buffer at 0.5-0.8 ml/min (control that pressure does not exceed the maximum limit of 1.5 MPa, otherwise decrease the flow).Inject a maximum of 500 µl of a 20 mg/ml protein sample in the column.Wash the column with the same buffer to elute proteins.Collect 0.5 ml fractions and perform SDS-PAGE and DLS analysis of the samples. For the SDS-PAGE, take 16 µl of sample and add 4 µl of 5x DB. Boil samples for 5 min and sonicate for 2 min prior to gel loading. If samples are too viscous for gel loading, increase boiling and/or sonication times.Wash the column with 2 CV of Mili-Q (MQ) water, followed by 2 CV of 20% ethanol.Pool fractions containing pure and homogeneous MGD1△137-6His protein.Concentrate the protein to ~10 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 20, MWCO 30,000 concentrator.Monitor protein concentration by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using the size exclusion buffer as blank.Prepare 40 µl aliquots and store at -20 °C, until further use.Crystallization of MGD1△137-6His proteinPrepare a protein stock solution at 6 mg/ml (use the size exclusion buffer for dilution).Prepare the precipitant solution containing 200 mM MgCl2·6H2O and 22% (w/v) PEG 3350.Pipet 400 µl of precipitant solution into the reservoir(s) of the crystallization plate. Prepare the crystallization drop(s) on the cover slip with 1 µl of MGD1△137-6His at 6 mg/ml and 2 µl of precipitant solution.",
    "Place the cover slip over the well (drop facing reservoir) and seal.Incubate plate at 20 °C. Inspect the plate frequently, under a microscope (crystals appear in one week, but often grow bigger within 10-12 days). Avoid temperature changes and keep the plate at 20 °C as much as possible.Crystals cryoprotection is achieved in a two-step procedure (i) by transferring into a stabilizing solution of mother liquor (precipitant solution) containing 27% (w/v) PEG 3350 precipitant, (ii) followed by a quick soak in the same cryoprotective solution supplemented with 30% (w/v) of the same precipitant. Use the cryocrystallography material to mount and handle crystals.Flash-cool and store crystals in LN2."
