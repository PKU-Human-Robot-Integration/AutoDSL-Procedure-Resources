  "procedures": [
    "All of the procedures with animal subjects were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n1. Preparation of the Cancer Cells\nHarvest sub-confluent Panc02-H7 cells with 0.25% trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C. Collect the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: The cells are grown in T-225 flask, which contains about 12 x 106 cells per flask at 80% confluency and 4 mL trypsin/ flask is used.\nCentrifuge the cells at x 900 g at 4°C for 5 min. Wash the cells by resuspending the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS (by pipetting up and down twice), and transfer the suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice.\nCentrifuge the cells again at x 900 g at 4°C for 5 min, and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Keep the pelleted cells on ice until injection.\n2. Preparation of the Mice and Surgery\nNote: 8-week-old, male and female C57BL/6J mice are used in this study. The surgery conditions follows the IACUC rules of our institution. The instruments are sterilized, the surgical working surface is disinfected, the animal is disinfected and the surgeon wears sterile gloves.\nOn the day before the surgery, anesthetize the mouse using 2% isoflurane and then remove the fur along the length of femur on the dorsal side with either a thin razor or a chemical hair removal agent.\nOn the day of the surgery, anesthetize the mice using 2% isofluorane in an induction chamber. Confirm the anesthetization by a toe pinch stimulus and a lack of response.\nApply vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness under anesthesia.",
    "Place the anesthetized mouse on its ventral side, and gently secure each limb with hypoallergenic tape to create mild tension in the limb to be injected. Anesthesia is maintained using isoflurane delivered via a precision vaporizer and nose cone.\nClean the injection site with Betadine, then again with 70% alcohol. Repeat this process two more times. Make sure that no loose hair remains on the surgical field.\nMake a 1 cm incision with small scissors about 2 mm below and parallel to the femur. Retract the skin with forceps laterally to expose the muscles underneath.\nThe sciatic nerve runs deep to the gluteus maximus and biceps femoris muscles. Separate these two muscles along a fascial plane with small scissors and expose the sciatic nerve underneath. Free the nerve from the surrounding muscles using blunt dissection.\nDraw 3 μL of cancer cells (about 50,000 cells) from the pellet into a 10 μL syringe.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, draw 3 μL of PBS as a control.\nPlace a small metal spatula underneath the nerve at the point of injection for support. Under visualization with a dissecting microscope, insert the needle into the nerve against the metal base, keeping the needle as parallel to the nerve as possible upon insertion. Be careful as not to puncture through the back of the nerve. Minimize the handling of nerve as much as possible throughout this process.\nSlowly inject into the nerve over 5 s. A formation of a bulb in the injection area indicates a good injection. Then leave the needle in place for 3 s before removing the needle gently. Keeping the needle in place for 3 s minimizes backflow of the cells out of the nerve.",
    "NOTE: Injection can be performed toward the distal nerve or the spinal cord. It is important to remain consistent within a set of experiments. If the cells spill outside, the animal should not be included in the analysis of the experiment. With experience, these events are very rare.\nReturn the nerve to its original position. Cover the nerve with the overlying muscles. Treat the mice with proper analgesia, and then close the skin with 5-0 Nylon sutures.\nPlace the mouse alone in a clean cage for observation during recovery, until it fully awakens from anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: It takes 5-15 min for the animal to regain full consciousness. The animal is not left unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. The animal is not returned to the company of other animals until fully recovered. Thereafter, evaluate recovery at least once every 24 h for 72 h.\n3. Sciatic Nerve Extraction\nOn postop day #7, euthanize the mice with CO2. Place the mouse on its ventral side, and stabilize the distal limbs using pins.\nRemove the skin on the dorsal side of the injected limb and torso.\nUsing blunt dissection, expose the sciatic nerve deep to the muscles.\nThe nerve courses between the ilium and the sacrum. To have access to the nerve at the spinal cord region, separate the two bones. First insert closed scissors in the narrow area where the sciatic nerve is located and then open the scissors while holding the mouse. Be delicate and maintain the integrity of the sciatic nerve during the dissection.\nCarefully dissect the sciatic nerve distally to the end of the femur, and proximally to the spinal cord.\nNOTE: Invaded nerves are extremely fragile and prone to breaking under tension or forceful handling.",
    "Harvest the nerve by first cutting its distal end. Carefully lift the nerve while freeing it from adjacent tissue. Cut the nerve at the proximal end, as close as possible to its exit from the spinal column.\nRecord then gross length of invasion using a Vernier caliper. This macroscopic estimation is only indicative.\n4. Nerve Processing and Quantification\nEmbed the dissected nerve in OCT compound. Make sure to place nerves longitudinally and as flat on the bottom of the mold as possible.\nIndicate on the cassette the proximal and distal side of the nerve by marking the letter P and D.\nPlace embedded nerves on top of dry ice, if they are not sectioned immediately. Sample could be preserved at -80 °C for several weeks.\nSection samples using a Cryostat microtome at 5 μm thickness and place sections on glass slides. If possible, fit 2 nerve sections per slide. Indicate proximal side of the nerve.\nStain slides using H&E staining12.\nDigitally scan stained nerve sections with a slide-scanner that provides high-resolution digital data.\nUsing imaging software, quantify the length of invasion by clicking the measure distance button, area of invasion, or other desired parameters. For a good estimation of the length of invasion, use multiple sections (2 to 4) of the same nerve.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
