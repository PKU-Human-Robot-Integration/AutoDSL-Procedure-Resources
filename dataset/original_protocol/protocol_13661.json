    "The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study design was reviewed and approved by the Bioethics Commission at the University of Rzeszów on 30/6/2017.\nNOTE: Pain management was also provided in an overall evaluation prior to starting MDT. Patients with signs of hyperalgesia and allodynia did not undergo therapy before achieving pain normalization to the level of 2-3 NRS. Regular painkillers were suggested during the therapy. Under the protocol, the preferred choice is treatment with agents from step 2 of the pain ladder - a combination of tramadol and paracetamol (in case of intolerance, other preparations from this group were recommended). Patients with symptoms of allodynia/hyperalgesia had consultations. In the pain management clinic, coanalgesics - pregabalin or gabapentin - were additionally used for a minimum of one week before using MDT.\n1. Assessment of the patient's status and qualification\nDiagnose chronic wound etiology (pressure injury, ulceration of the lower leg) based on evaluation of the patient's condition and physical examination, in accordance with clinical pressure sore classification of the NPIAP, as well as RYB (Red-Yellow-Black wound classification) and WAR (Wound At Risk score). Based on visual inspection and palpation, diagnose UPI that meet the criteria of a full-thickness Stage 3-4 wound (Figure 1).\nApply the following inclusion criteria: over 18 years of age, voluntary consent, pressure sore with full-thickness skin loss and a surface over 30 cm² with necrotic tissue (yellow or black according to the RYB classification), moderate to high level of acceptance in a questionnaire-based assessment (MDT acceptance questionnaire).\nApply the following exclusion criteria: age below 18 years, lack of consent for participation in the study, pressure sore without full-thickness skin loss, with no symptoms of necrosis, allergic reaction to chitin, low level of acceptance in a questionnaire-based assessment.\n2. Mechanical/surgical procedure",
    "NOTE: In some cases, wound debridement does not require surgical intervention due to the earlier debridement intervention. The presented case of using MDT is special due to the simultaneous presentation of demarked tissues preceding the implementation of MDT. In this case, the wound was prepared for the preparation of mechanically dead tissue (a written consent for the type of therapy).\nTo achieve demarcation of the dead tissue, apply dressings with addition of PVP-I (povidone-iodine), cover with foam dressing (e.g., Hydrotac, Allevyn Clasic). Apply a protective remedy to wound edges and prevent pressure sore development (alternating pressure mattress, preferably with tubular structure, change of body position in sequence 2-8 hours).\nRemove demarcated dead tissue from the wound bloodlessly, using sterile surgical tools (tweezers, scalpels, or scissors).\nApply wound dressing with the addition of an antiseptic gel and with Hydrofiber. Continue prevention of pressure sore development (discontinue antiseptic 12-24 hours before larvae application and dress the wound with a moist dressing with NaCl 0.9% or hydrogel on a hydrofiber dressing).\nAssess acceptance for MDT prior to application using questionnaire. Explain the protocol of the therapy procedure and obtain a written consent for the type of therapy.\n3. Applying MDT\nSecure wound edges against secretions released during cleansing. Use various methods of skin protection (e.g., hydrocolloid, stoma paste). 25% zinc ointment was preferred in our protocol.\n\t\nSubsequently, apply loose larvae to the wound (5-10 larvae per 1 cm2 of the surface). Secure the wound with non-woven fabric dressing, wet dressings followed by dry dressings. Keep the larvae on the wound for 3-4 days (72-96 hours) (Figure 2).",
    "After applying the larvae, secure the wound with a non-woven fabric dressing (e.g., Vliwasorb or Matovlies) soaked in 0.9% NaCl. Then dry and secure with a 15 cm wide non-woven fabric patch to protect the entire dressing against the potential larvae migration from the wound.\nInspect the wound after 22-24 hours. Change the top dressing and inspect the colony. Then rinse/moisturize with 0.9% NaCl.\n\t\nMonitor larvae viability and assess the quantity and quality of exudate and skin. Secure the skin with zinc ointment and the wound with non-woven fabric dressing using a patch.\nInspect the wound after 46-48 hours. Change the top dressing, inspect the colony and the wound-cleansing process. Rinse/moisturize the skin with 0.9% NaCl and secure with zinc ointment. Secure the wound with non-woven fabric dressing with a patch (Figure 3).\nInspect the wound after 70-72 hours. Change the top dressing, inspect the colony and the wound-cleansing process, rinse/moisturize the skin and secure with zinc ointment. Secure the wound with non-woven fabric dressing.\n\t\nDecide whether to remove the larvae or to leave them for the next 24 hours based on the amount of live tissue in the wound, the size of the wound, and the activity of the larvae within the wound (Figure 4).\nInspect the wound after 94-96 hours.\n\t\nRemove the dressing with the larvae (prepared for disposal) and assess the wound debridement (after palpation and visual assessment of the wound). Remove larvae from the wound by rinsing with 0.9% NaCl. Note that mature maggots move out of the wound and to the dressing (non-woven fabric).\nInactivate the larvae with isopropyl alcohol. Secure the wound with Hydrofiber or foam dressing.\nConsider further treatment by re-application of MDT, application of NPWT or application of active dressings (Figure 5). Calculate the purification index as follows:",
    "Debridement index = 100 - x 100,\n\twhere:\n\tx1 - percentage of dead tissue and exudate before treatment,\n\tx2 - percentage of dead tissue and exudate after treatment.\n\tThe acquired results classified in separate percent ranges, as follows:\n\t0 - no dead tissues removed (no therapeutic effect),\n\t10-30% - poor wound debridement (unsatisfactory therapeutic effect),\n\t40-80% - moderate wound debridement (good therapeutic effect),\n\t90-100 % - complete wound debridement (very good therapeutic effect).\n4. Statistics\nPerform statistical analyses in Statistica 13.1.\nApply non-parametric tests due to a failure to meet the assumptions of parametric tests (i.e., agreement of distributions with normal distribution) as verified with the Shapiro-Wilk W-test.\nAssess associations between level of wound debridement and selected quantitative variables using Spearman's rank correlation test.\nAssess differences in the degree of wound debridement in patients with or without selected symptoms, and with or without wounds in a specific location, with a two-tailed test for significance of differences between two means.\nAssume statistical significance at p < 0.05."
