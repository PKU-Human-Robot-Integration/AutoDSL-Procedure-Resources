    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollect the zebrafish embryos\nCross the transgenic zebrafish (with labeled immune cells – e.g., Tg(mpeg:GFP) a day prior to the collection of embryos.\nNote: Zebrafish eggs are collected from timed pairwise spawning. One female and one male are placed together in non-circulating 1-liter mesh-bottomed spawning tanks the afternoon/evening before collection. Tanks are set before the dark period of the light cycle begins, but after the day's feedings have been completed.\nNext day, collect the embryos in 100 mm petri dish in egg-water supplemented with methylene blue (100 μL in 1 L) and incubate at 37°C for 6 h.\nNote: Eggs are generally spawned shortly after the daylight period of the light cycle begins, but several hours should be allotted for disinterested zebrafish. Once eggs are apparent in the bottom of the tank, the adult zebrafish are returned to their home tanks, and the spawning tank water is poured through a fine metal mesh strainer to capture eggs. Eggs are maintained at 28°C in ∼20 ml of system water in 100 mm plastic petri plates until several rounds of cleavage have occurred, so that unfertilized eggs can be identified and removed. Fertilized eggs are sorted into fresh petri plates at a density of <50 embryos, and dishes are filled with approximately 20 ml of fresh egg water.\nChange to PTU-egg-water to prevent pigmentation of the fish.\nAt 3 day post-fertilization (dpf), transfer the larvae to a new petri dish containing PTU-egg-water that has been supplemented with 0.01% Tricaine to immobilize the larvae.\nNote: Use non-tissue culture (TC)-treated petri dish, as larvae can stick to the TC-treated dish causing unexpected injuries.\nSort transgenic larvae by epifluorescence using a dissecting microscope.\nTailfin injury\nTiming: 30 min–2 h",
    "In this step, we perform the tailfin cut to induce an inflammatory injury environment, which promotes immune cell migration to the injury site.\nAlign the larvae horizontally and dissect the distal tip of the tailfin with a sharp scalpel.\nTransfer the larvae to fresh PTU-egg-water to wash out tricaine and revive.\nRecover the larvae in a 28.5°C incubator for 6 h post-injury.\nFollowing the recovery period, transfer the larvae to a freshly prepared 3% Formaldehyde solution in PEM buffer, and incubate it for 16–18 h at 4°C.\nNote: Ideal time for this fixation is 16–18 h. An incubation longer than 18 h will result in brittle larvae, making subsequent processing more difficult.\nNote: As an alternative, larvae can be utilized for live imaging studies. Instead of transferring to PTU-egg water for recovery, transfer up to 6 larvae to 3% molten low-melting temperature agarose prepared in egg water + 0.01% Tricaine. Larvae can be then transferred to coverslip-bottom 35 mm petri dishes (Mattek) and imaged on a confocal microscope for a time course of up to 12 h.\nImmunostaining\nTiming: 2 days\nHere we describe the protocol for immunostaining of the larvae to facilitate visualization of the fluorescently labeled migrating immune cells.\nWash the larvae twice with PBS\nNote: Wash step involves incubating the larvae with indicated reagent (PBS here) on an orbital shaker for 5 min per wash.\nPermeabilize with PWDT for 20 min at 22°C–28°C.\nNote: Do not permeabilize for more than 20 min. It can lead to degradation and inconsistent staining of the larvae.\nWash once with PWD.\nBlock non-specific antibody binding with PWDB (contains 4% BSA) for 30 min at 22°C–28°C.\nWash once with PWD.\nImmunostain with primary antibodies by incubation at 4°C for 18 h in 50–100 μL of a 1:250 dilution of Chicken anti-GFP antibody.",
    "Wash three times with PWD.\nImmunostain with secondary antibodies by incubation at 4°C for 18 h in 250 μL of a 1:500 dilution of desired AlexaFluor labeled antibody.\nNote: Secondary antibody staining may alternatively be carried out for 2–4 h at 22°C–28°C, but better and more consistent results are obtained with 18 h staining.\nWash three times with PWD.\nMount the larvae on glass slides in an anti-fade mounting solution e.g.,.Vectashield (Vector Labs Cat# H-1000).\nImaging and quantification\nTiming: 1–4 h\nMount the slides on the confocal microscope\nImage the larvae using the appropriate laser wavelengths at 20×. If necessary to capture all labeled cells in a thick sample, collect a Z-stack by imaging multiple Z planes with an optical section depth of 1 μm.\nManually quantify the number of immune cells located distal to the notochord and through to the injury site.\nPerform appropriate statistical analysis to analyze the differences in immune cell migration."
