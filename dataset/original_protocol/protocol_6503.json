Set up the protocol.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. FlexStation 3 and SoftMax Pro 7 Preparation Preparation of the reading plate with cells in suspensionAspirate medium from 10 cm tissue culture dish with cells at 80-90% confluent. Add 2 ml Trypsin-EDTA solution to dish and return dish to tissue culture incubator for 2 min. Neutralize Trypsin-EDTA by adding 3 ml fresh culture medium, then transfer the cells to 15 ml tube and centrifuge for 2 min at 150 x g.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 21 ml SES for single injection experiment, or in 16 ml SES for double injection experiment. Transfer cell suspension in Channelmate 25 ml insert. Using 8-channel pipette, transfer suspension to 96-well black clear bottom reading plate, 200 μl/well for single injection experiment, or 150 μl/well for double injection experiment.Load reading plate with cells in reading chamber drawer of the FlexStation 3.Incubate cells 20 min in the reading chamber at 25 °C to allow equilibration prior to performing experiment.If the protocol requires pretreatment with a GPCR antagonist, pretreat the cells with the antagonist prior to the aforementioned 20 min incubation step mentioned in line 4.Preparation of the reading plate with adherent cellsDepending on the clonal cell line used, some clones show a small injection artifact upon administration of test solutions to suspensions of these cells. This artifact can be avoided by performing the experiment with a monolayer of adherent cells grown in reading plate wells coated with rat tail collagen (RTC). This approach requires an additional day since overnight culture of the cells on RTC is required.",
    "Day 1: Coating plate with Rat Tail CollagenIn the tissue culture hood transfer Rat Tail Collagen Coating Solution in Channelmate 25 ml insert. Using 8-channel pipette, transfer solution to 96-well black clear bottom reading plate, 50 μl/well.Incubate plate for 60 min at room temperature.Using Multiwell Plate Manifold, aspirate coating solution from the plate.Using 8-channel pipette, wash plate once with PBS 100 μl/well.Note: Plate may be used immediately, or air dried in a tissue culture hood and stored at 2-8 °C up to one week under sterile conditions. Loading reading plate with the cellsAspirate medium from 10 cm tissue culture dish with cells. Add 2 ml Trypsin-EDTA solution and return dish to tissue culture incubator for 2 min. Neutralize Trypsin-EDTA by adding 3 ml fresh culture medium. Transfer the cells to 15 ml tube, vortex and count the cells using hemacytometer.Centrifuge cells for 2 min at 150 x g.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in fresh culture medium to concentration 600,000 cells/ml.Transfer 12 ml of the cell suspension in Channelmate 25 ml insert. Using 8-channel pipette, transfer cells to rat tail collagen-coated 96-well reading plate, 100 μl/well.Note: A cell count of 60,000 cells/well on the plate will allow ~80-90% cell confluency the next morning after adherence of cells. Such confluency helps minimize dislodging of the cell monolayer during medium or buffer exchange during experimental preparations. If cells other than HEK293 cells are used, the cell count must be adjusted in order to reach 80-90% confluency on the day of experiment. Incubate plate with the cells in tissue culture incubator overnight.Day 2: Using Multiwell Plate Manifold, aspirate culture medium from plate. Using 8-channel pipette, add SES to plate, 200 μl/well for single injection experiment, or 150 μl/well for double injection experiment.",

Data Analysis Representative examples of dataPresented in Figures 1A and 1B are examples of how to perform a FRET assay using a Flexstation 3 in which H188 is used to determine the dose-response relationship for stimulatory effects of glucagon on intracellular [cAMP]. Figure 1A illustrates how to load the compound plate with test solutions that are dissolved in SES at a 5x higher concentration than what will eventually be the final concentration after delivery of the test solutions to the reading plate. Figure 1B illustrates which wells these test solutions are injected into on the reading plate that contain cells (see legend for Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603195822_6395.jpgFigure 1. Design of compound and reading plates for determination of the glucagon dose-response relationship using the human glucagon receptor and cAMP sensor H188. A. Compound plate containing test solutions.",
    "Each of the first four wells in rows A-H on the compound plate contain 300 μl of the test solution specified on the left side of the plate. For example, wells A1, A2, A3 and A4 are loaded with SES serving as the Vehicle control; wells B1, B2, B3 and B4 loaded with 5 pM glucagon in SES and so on up to 5,000 pM glucagon. For each concentration, the mean % ∆FRET ± S.D. for n = 12 wells will be determined. B. Reading plate containing HEK293-hGCG-R-H188 c10 cell suspensions. For each concentration of glucagon tested, three wells on the reading plate receive 50 μl of a 5x concentrated test solution that is transferred from one well on the compound plate, and added to the 200 μl cell suspension. For example, the wells colored red for A1, A2 and A3; B1, B2 and B3, continuing to H1, H2 and H3 on the reading plate receive test solutions A1, B1, continuing on to H1 (red color) on the compound plate. Next, wells A4, A5 and A6; B4, B5 and B, continuing on to H4, H5 and H6 (green color) on the reading plate receive test solutions A2, B2, continuing on to H2 (green color) of the compound plate. The same procedure is applied to the remaining wells (blue, yellow color).Illustrated are data obtained in these FRET assays that determine the glucagon dose-response relationship (see legend for Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603195848_6337.jpgFigure 2. Establishment of the glucagon dose-response using cAMP sensor H188. A. Raw data obtained from a single well on the reading plate illustrates the time-dependent reciprocal increase and decrease of 485 and 535 nm H188 relative fluorescence unit (RFU) emission intensity in response to application of 300 pM glucagon to HEK293-hGCG-R-H188 c10 cell suspensions.",
    "Administration of the test substance is indicated by the vertical arrow, here and in subsequent figures. B. Determination of the single well percent change of H188 485/535 nm emission ratio (% ∆FRET) calculated using the single well raw data illustrated in panel 2A. An increase of the 485/535 nm FRET ratio signifies an increase of [cAMP]. A value of 0 is obtained after baseline subtraction of the FRET ratio at time point 0. A value of 70 corresponds to a 70% increase of FRET ratio relative to baseline. C. Glucagon produced a time-dependent and dose-dependent increase of the 485/535 nm H188 FRET ratio. Data for each time point is the mean % ∆FRET ± S.D. for n = 12 wells. D. Non-linear regression analysis of the data illustrated in panel 2C demonstrated that the EC50 for glucagon action in this cell line was 8.1 pM. Non-linear regression analysis was performed with Origin 8 software using the highest ∆FRET values for each data point. Non-linear reduction can also be performed with GraphPad Prism 8. For instruction in how to obtain values for time-dependent, dose-dependent and non-linear reduction with SoftMax Pro 7.1 see Video 2.Illustrated are data obtained in FRET assays that monitor [Ca2+]i using the YC3.60 reporter, the CCK2R agonist DG2, and cells that express the CCK2R (see legend for Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603195912_5610.jpgFigure 3. Dose-dependent action of demogastrin-2 (DG2) at the human CCK2 receptor to increase [Ca2+]i as detected using YC3.60. A. Raw data obtained from a single well on the reading plate illustrates the time-dependent reciprocal decrease and increase of 485 and 535 nm YC3.60 relative fluorescence unit (RFU) emission intensity in response to application of CCK2 receptor agonist DG2 (300 nM) to suspensions of HEK293-hCCK2R c29 cells adenovirally transduced with YC3.60. B.",
    "Determination of the single well percent change of YC3.60 535/485 nm emission ratio (% ∆FRET) calculated using the single well raw data illustrated in panel 3A. An increase of the 535/485 nm FRET ratio signifies an increase of [Ca2+]i. C. DG2 produced a time-dependent and dose-dependent increase of the 535/485 nm YC3.60 FRET ratio. Data for each time point is the mean % ∆FRET ± S.D. for n = 6 wells. D. Non-linear regression analysis of the data illustrated in panel 3C demonstrated that the EC50 for DG2 action in this cell line was 604 pM. Non-linear regression analysis was performed with Origin 8 software using the highest ∆FRET values for each data point. Non-linear reduction can also be performed with GraphPad Prism 8. For instruction in how to obtain values for time-dependent, dose-dependent and non-linear reduction with SoftMax Pro 7.1 see Video 2.Illustrated is a double injection protocol that monitors the ability of PYY(3-36) to lower levels of 299 [cAMP] in cells that are treated with forskolin and that express NPY2R (see legend for Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603195937_6806.jpgFigure 4. Peptide YY(3-36) lowers levels of cAMP in HEK293-NPY2R-H188 c18 cells. A. HEK293/hNPY2R/H188 c18 cells stably expressing the human NPY2R receptor and H188 were allowed to adhere to an RTC-coated reading plate for overnight culture. On day 2 the ability of forskolin alone to raise levels of cAMP was monitored (red trace). Note that this action of forskolin was dose-dependently reduced when the NPY2R agonist PYY(3-36) (1-10 nM) was administered 125 s prior to administration of forskolin using a \"double injection protocol\". PYY(3-36) binds to NPY2R to activate Gi proteins and to lower adenylyl cyclase activity, whereas forskolin directly stimulates adenylyl cyclase. Thus, this assay monitors the opposing actions of PYY(3-36) and forskolin to control levels of cAMP.",
    "Non-linear regression analysis of the data demonstrated that the IC50 for PYY(3-36) action in this cell line was 2.1 nM. Non-linear regression analysis was performed with Origin 8 software using the highest ∆FRET values for each data point. Note that the time scale is 1,200 s, thereby revealing short and long-term actions of forskolin and PYY(3-36) in this assay. B. Converse experiment in comparison to A in which forskolin was administered prior to PYY(3-36) using HEK293/hNPY2R/H188 c18 cells and the double injection protocol. Note that the time scale is 400 s, thereby revealing the fast action of PYY(3-36) (1 μM) to reduce the rate of increase of ∆FRET. This NPY2R-mediated action of PYY(3-36) signifies Gi protein-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with resultant lowering of cAMP levels, as detected using H188."
