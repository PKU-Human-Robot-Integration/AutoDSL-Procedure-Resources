    "All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Texas Medical Branch, an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) accredited facility.\n1. Animal Preparation for ABS Blast Injury\nTurn on mechanical rodent volume ventilator and set breath rate between 40–45 breaths per min.\nSwitch thermostatically controlled warming blanket ON and tape a blue pad over it.\nAttach ventilator hose to the ventilator.\nGather endotracheal intubation sled, laryngoscope, long pickup tweezers, stylet, endotracheal tube, and a cotton swab soaked with 0.05 mL of 1% Lidocaine HCl. Organize on the blue pad.\nConfirm that rodent anesthetic \"bubble\" chamber, ventilator, air chamber and isoflurane chamber hoses are securely connected and attached to their respective plug or socket. The anesthetic bubble chamber clamp should be OPEN; the ventilator clamp should be CLOSED.\nOn the air chamber, set the knob for room air to 2 L/min and the knob for oxygen to 1 L/min.\nTurn on the isoflurane and set the knob to 4% of volume mixture.\nStart a timer and place a young adult (≈3 months old), male Sprague-Dawley rat (350–400 g) in the anesthetic bubble chamber for 4–6 min.\nWeigh rat at the 2 min mark.\nConfirm rat is fully anesthetized by gently pinching hind paw toes. If no paw withdrawal is observed, reduce the room air and set knob to 1 L/min, oxygen to 0.4 L/min and isoflurane to 2% of volume mixture.\nTurn on rectal telethermometer temperature monitor.\nOPEN the clamp to the ventilator and CLOSE the clamp to the anesthetic bubble chamber.\nRemove rat from anesthetic bubble chamber and position on endotracheal intubation sled.",
    "Intubate rat. Place laryngoscope in animal's mouth, use long pickup tweezers to position the tongue out of the way, swab lidocaine-soaked cotton swab tip along inside of the throat and gently insert stylet containing the endotracheal tube into rat's trachea.\nOnce intubated, insert the end of the ventilator hose to the outside end of endotracheal tube and observe and confirm the rat is breathing steadily and without difficulty.\nTie down the endotracheal tube into place taking care that the tongue is free from the knot.\nApply white petroleum jelly to rectal telethermometer probe and insert directly beneath the tail.\nRemove the ABS specimen tray from the specimen chamber and place under the heat lamp for warming before rat placement on tray.\nShave the top of the rat's scalp starting above the eyes and down to between the ears.\nCut a standard-sized foam ear plug into identical halves with scissors. Start at the center of the base of the plug and cut straight up to the rounded tip. Insert a halved piece into each ear tip first along the ear canal until contact is made with the tympanic membrane.\nMonitor rectal temperature. Once a temperature of 37 °C is reached, the rat is ready to be loaded into the ABS specimen tray.\nSecure the rat onto the ABS specimen tray. Remove the ventilator hose from the endotracheal tube and quickly but softly slide the rat into the top end of the tray, gently guiding the head through the head holder opening and rubber collar. Reinsert the ventilator hose back into the endotracheal tube, check the rubber collar to make sure it is securely but not tightly around the neck and verify that the rat is laying in a lateral prone position (Figure 3).",
    "Turn off the isoflurane and remove the ventilator hose from the endotracheal tube.\nLock and secure the ABS specimen tray containing the anesthetized rat into the ABS specimen chamber.\nGently pinch hind paw toes using long tweezers every 3 s until a withdrawal reflex response is elicited.\n2. ABS Blast Device Preparation and Blast-TBI Induction\nNOTE: Protocol steps 2.1–2.10 are typically completed at the same time as steps 1.1–1.22 so the ABS is ready for blast injury administration right after the rat is loaded and secured into the specimen chamber.\nLoosen the hydraulic hand pump (Figure 4A) knob in order to allow for any residual trapped air to escape from the driver chamber (Figure 4B) and to loosen the chamber from its seal.\nLoosen the cap nuts (Figure 4C) from the all-thread rods (Figure 4D) surrounding the driver chamber and slide the chamber to the left and away from the expansion chamber (Figure 4E).\nCompletely remove the two all-thread rods and their corresponding cap nuts located at the top of the driver chamber in order to allow for placement of the mylar sheets in between the driver and expansion chamber.\nStack and tape together along the top edge four pre-cut and pre-measured (30 cm length, 20 cm width, 0.004 in. thick) mylar sheets (forming a mylar 'membrane') using a 2.54 cm piece of masking tape. Using a second piece of tape, securely tape the top edge of the mylar membrane to the top of the expansion chamber and over the center of the opening between the driver and expansion chambers (Figure 4F).\nSecure the driver chamber against the mylar membrane by replacing the two all-thread rods at the top of the chamber and hand-tightening all cap nuts surrounding the chamber.",
    "Situate the accessory steel block against the hydraulic hand pump block and driver chamber until securely fit.\nTighten the hydraulic hand pump knob and confirm the driver chamber remains pressurized with no leaks by observing a constant pressure threshold on the hydraulic gauge.\nOpen the trigger acquisition file that records ABS blast device pressure traces on the ABS blast device computer.\nLoosen the compressed air tank's (Figure 4G) main knob enough to slightly open the airway.\nOperate the hydraulic hand pump until the gauge indicator reaches the red arrow indicating a desired chamber pressure level of ≈5,000 psi.\nSecure and position the anesthetized animal onto the ABS specimen tray (Figure 4H) in a lateral prone position (Figure 3) and lock the specimen tray into the ABS specimen chamber (Figure 4I).\nGently pinch a hind paw using long tweezers every 3 s until a withdrawal reflex response is elicited.\nClick Start on the opened acquisition page on the ABS blast device computer.\nOnce the 'Acquisitioning' window appears on the screen, press and hold down the ABS blast device trigger until the blast goes off, rupturing the mylar membrane and administering the ABS blast injury (20.9 psi ±1.14, 138 kPa ±7.9) to the rat. Right after the blast detonates, start a second timer to keep track of how much time (in min and s) has elapsed post-injury.\nRemove the rat from the ABS specimen tray and return to the blue pad and warming blanket, placing him fully on his back for assessment of righting reflex suppression.",
    "Record the time for return of the righting reflex. Observing the second timer, document in min and s the length of time post-injury it takes for the rat to roll from his back onto his stomach three successive times. Return the rat to the anesthetic bubble chamber.\nLoosen the hydraulic hand pump knob in order to allow for driver chamber loosening and movement.\nTighten the compressed air tank's main knob in order to close the airway.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58792/58792fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Rat placement on ABS specimen tray and inside ABS.

Preparation of Rodent MCA PSS Solution\nNOTE: Protocol steps 3.1–3.3 are typically completed at the same time as steps 1.1–1.22 to have the PSS solution is ready for use.\nPrepare and mix a 1,000 mL physiological salt solution (PSS) of the following composition and concentrations: 130 mM NaCl; 4.7 mM KCl; 1.17 mM MgSO4∙7H2O; 5 mM glucose; 1.5 mM CaCl2; 15 mM NaHCO3.\nEquilibrate the PSS with a gas mixture of 21% O2 and 5% CO2 in a balance of N2. The solution is ready when the pH reads 7.4.",
    "NOTE: All gases are obtained from compressed gas cylinders in the above mentioned concentrations.\nFill the reservoir bottles and tubing with prepared PSS solution and chill the remaining solution.\n4. Extraction of Rodent MCA Segments\nAfter documenting the length of the righting reflex time, return the rat to the anesthetic bubble chamber. CLOSE the clamp to the ventilator, and OPEN the clamp to the chamber. Turn the isoflurane on to 4% of volume mixture and keep the rat in the chamber for 2–3 min until deeply anesthetized.\nOnce the rat is anesthetized, OPEN the clamp to the ventilator and CLOSE the clamp to the anesthetic bubble chamber. Reduce the isoflurane to 2% of volume mixture, and remove him from the bubble chamber. Place him on his stomach on the warming blanket and re-insert the end of the ventilator hose to the outside end of endotracheal tube.\nMaintain mechanical ventilation at a breath rate between 40–45 breaths per min and anesthesia at 2% of volume mixture for either 30 or 60 min immediately post-bTBI injury.\nAfter completion of either the 30 or 60 min survival time, increase the isoflurane to 4% of volume mixture, and deeply anesthetize for 5–6 min. Immediately euthanize by decapitation using a rodent-specific guillotine.\nNOTE: In these experiments, we kept the animals anesthetized and mechanically ventilated following the return of righting reflex until decapitation.  If the study requires longer survival timepoints, analgesics should be administered to the animal before emergence from anesthesia. \nDelicately remove the brain from the skull. Use a #10 scalpel blade to make a central, 1.5 inch vertical, bone-deep incision from the top of the shaved scalp down to the occipital condyle.\nUse small bone rongeurs to open and separate the scalp skin from the skull bone.",
    "Use large bone rongeurs to cut and extract the occipital, interparietal, and lower half of the frontal bones encasing the brain.\nUse a surgical spatula to carefully excavate the brain out of the skull once the brain is free of surrounding bone.\nNOTE: Take extreme caution when separating the brain from the skull so as not to unnecessarily tug, jerk or pull the delicate MCA segments from the cranial wall.\nDeposit the harvested brain into the chilled PSS solution contained in a small glass Petri dish that is directly resting on top of a solid ice-block.\nCarefully remove both the left and right MCA beginning at the Circle of Willis. Continue removing the segment laterally and dorsally for approximately 4–5 mm.\nGently clean the collected MCA segments of approximately 4–5 mm in length of any connective tissue using microforceps.\nMount the MCA's on the arteriograph. Cannulate the proximal end of each segment with the first glass micropipette (diameter ≈70 µm) and secure with a 10-0 nylon suture.\nSoftly perfuse the lumina with PSS to remove any residual blood and other contents from the lumen.\nCannulate the distal end of each segment with the second micropipette without stretching the MCA segment and secure with a 10-0 nylon suture.\nAfter successful mounting of the MCA segment, place the chamber on top of an inverted microscope's stage for magnification of the vessels. The microscope is equipped with a video camera, monitor and a video scaler calibrated with an optical micrometer for arterial diameter measurements.\nFill each segment and the surrounding arteriograph bath with continuously circulated PSS warmed from room temperature to 37 °C and equilibrated with the gas mixture of 21% O2 and 5% CO2 in a balance of N2.",
    "Equilibrate the MCA segments at a pressure of 50 mmHg for 60 min by raising the reservoir bottles connected to the micropipettes to an appropriate height above the segments.Pressure transducers located between the micropipettes and reservoir bottles will assess transmural pressure within the MCA segment indicating when the desired 50 mmHg pressure is attained.\nAfter the conclusion of the equilibration period, increase the intravascular pressure to 100 mmHg by setting the reservoir bottles at different heights.\nDeliver 30 mM K+ (for confirmation of vessel contraction) via the luminal perfusate and measure arterial diameters. Approximately 10 min later deliver 10-5 M Ach (for vessel dilation) and measure arterial diameters.\nExamine vessel dilatory responses. Lower the reservoir bottles to reduce the intravascular pressure from 100 mmHg to 80 mmHg. Allow the MCA segments to equilibrate for 10 min. Measure arterial diameters.\nReduce the intravascular pressure from 80 mmHg to 60 mmHg. Allow the MCA segments to equilibrate for 10 min. Measure arterial diameters.\nReduce the intravascular pressure from 60 mmHg to 40 mmHg. Allow the MCA segments to equilibrate for 10 min. Measure arterial diameters.\nReduce the intravascular pressure from 40 mmHg to 20 mmHg. Allow the MCA segments to equilibrate for 10 min. Measure arterial diameters."
