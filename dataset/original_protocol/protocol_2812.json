    "Note: Each larva contains two eye-antennal imaginal discs. If you are recovering other imaginal discs note that within a larva there are two labial discs, two clypeolabral discs, two wing discs, two haltere discs, six leg discs, and one genital disc.\nTransfer each clean larva to a small pool (∼1 mL) of Wash+ Buffer at the edge of a silicone-based dissection plate.\nUsing forceps transfer a single larva to a large pool (∼2 mL) of Wash+ Buffer in the middle of the same silicone-based dissection plate.\nUsing two pair of forceps, one in each hand, grasp and lightly hold the larva lengthwise with forceps.\nNote: One pair of forceps should be used to gently but stably hold the larva approximately 1/3 of the body length from the mouth hooks. The other pair of forceps should be used to grab onto the mouth hooks.\nHolding the mouth hooks steady, quickly but gently pull the body of the larva away from the mouth hooks. You should feel a slight release in tension as the larva tears apart.\nRelease the forceps holding the body of the larva and allow for the internal tissues remaining attached to the mouth hooks to spread out.\nImmediately transfer the larval carcass (the portion without the mouth hooks, brain hemispheres, ventral ganglion, salivary glands and imaginal discs) out of the dissection bubble.\nHolding the mouth hook complex firmly use a pair of forceps to remove the excess tissues including the salivary glands and overlying cuticle until a single complex of mouth hooks, brain hemispheres, ventral ganglion and imaginal discs remain.\nOrient the remaining complex with the ventral side facing downwards.",
    "Use one pair of forceps to again firmly hold the mouth hooks. With a second pair of forceps, remove the brain hemispheres by placing a single tong into the space between the brain and eye-antennal discs and rapidly pulling the brain away from the mouth hooks.\nNote: For a visual demonstration of the dissection of imaginal discs please see the video protocol associated with Spratford and Kumar, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13].\nIsolate the remaining imaginal tissues by pinching off the discs as closely as possible to the connecting cuticle.\nOnce the imaginal discs are free from all other tissue transfer the newly dissected disc to the LoBind tube containing the Concanavalin A beads in Wash+ Buffer.\nFor abundant chromatin marks such as trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) repeat above steps until 10 individual imaginal discs have been transferred to each of the two LoBind tubes.

We have found this starting concentration to be sufficient for providing robust and reliable chromatin cleavage following dilution.\nNote: Our Protein A/G MNase stock was made in-lab by first transforming bacterial cells with the pAG/MNase plasmid (#123461) available from AddGene. This was followed by induction of protein production, protein extraction and column purification, and finally desalting of the purified protein. Concentration of the purified protein was determined by a Bradford assay.

    "In our experience with over 100 samples, performing CUT&RUN using histone marks with broad domains yields purified chromatin fragments with concentrations of 200–300 pg/μL as measured by an Invitrogen Qubit 3 Fluorometer using the dsDNA high-sensitivity assay. For more narrow histone marks the concentration of purified chromatin fragments is not detectable by NanoDrop spectrophotometer, Qubit fluorometer, or Agilent TapeStation. However, even with undetectable concentrations, we have never encountered a sample that was unable to produce a quality DNA library.\nDNA libraries are prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina from New England Biolabs. The DNA fragments obtained from the CUT&RUN protocol described here are used as-is for DNA library production. No further shearing or fragmentation is necessary.\nNext-generation sequencing is carried out using Illumina NextSeq equipment at a read-depth of 15 M reads per sample."
