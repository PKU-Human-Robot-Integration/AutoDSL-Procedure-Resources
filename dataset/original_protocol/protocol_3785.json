The detection time of a sample is usually 11–15 min.\nNote: According to the results of aSEC, the protein yield and homogeneity of different constructs can be judged.\nFluorescence thermal stability experiment\nNote: Fluorescence thermal stability experiment uses chemical dye CPM (N-[4-(7-diethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarin) phenyl] maleimide) for membrane protein.

    "Use GraphPad Prism software for data analysis. According to the fluorescence thermal stability experiment, the constructs with relatively higher Tm values are selected for the following crystallization trials.\nNote: The protein constructs or ligands showed higher Tm values were selected for the further crystallization trials. Based on the past experience, if the Tm value is higher than 60°C, it will have more chance to get the crystal hits (Popov et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nProtein crystallization and crystal optimization\nTiming: 1 day\nNote: Most of the well diffracting crystals of GPCRs are successfully obtained using the lipid cubic phase (LCP) method. The principle is as described in the literature (Caffrey and Cherezov, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPreparation of Lipid-Cholesterol mixture. Because the grease is hygroscopic, take it out from −20°C and make it to 20°C before use (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/706-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Before sample preparation, two 100 μL Hamilton Syringes need to be washed with methanol and dried, the Lipid-Cholesterol mixture is taken out from −20°C, and the metal bath is heated at 42°C for dissolving the grease.\nThe protein sample (CB2-T4L) used for crystallization is centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and put into one of the 100 μL Syringe with a relatively thin pipette tip (Avoid bubbles when transferring), and determine the protein solution weight.\nAccording to the weight ratio of 2 (Protein): 3 (Lipid), transfer the prepared lipid to another 100 μL Syringe preheated at 42°C.\nUse the coupler to connect two Syringes, put them at 20°C and then mix them to form a transparent LCP phase (Heat will be generated during the mixing process, so the pushing speed should not be too fast, just 1 s for 1 round of back and forth).\nCrystallization experiment. The crystallization robot, Formulatrix NT8, is used for the high-throughput crystallization screening, which includes protein constructs, ligands, precipitants, and buffers.\nFollow the instructions of crystallization robot to perform the experiment.\nNote: According to the past experience, the crystallization conditions for preliminary screening mainly include pH (5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0), Hampton Salts (100 mM/400 mM 49 unique salts), PEG400 concentration (25%–40%) and commercial membrane protein crystallization kits.\nThe initial small crystals were obtained in the condition of pH6.0, 30% PEG400 and 400 mM lithium sulfate monohydrate. The strategy for crystal optimization includes pH optimization with 0.2 intervals around pH6.0, adjusting the salt concentration and/or the PEG400 concentration.",
    "Of note, when crystallizing CB2-AM12057 sample, there exist two different crystal forms in the same crystallization condition, which are in the bulk and long-rod shape, respectively. The ratio of those two crystal forms varies by changing the concentrations of PEG400, where the bulk crystals appear more in the lower PEG400 concentration while the long-rod crystals grow more in the higher concentration of PEG400. The diffraction resolution of bulk crystals is about 4 Å, while that of long rod crystals is about 3.0 Å.\nOptimized crystals of CB2-AM12057 were obtained from precipitant conditions containing 100 mM sodium cacodylate trihydrate pH 6.2, 40% PEG 400, 400 mM lithium sulfate monohydrate, and reached a full size of 200 μm after 2 weeks. Crystals were harvested from the LCP matrix using MiTeGen micromounts and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nFluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching, FRAP.\nNote: The main principle is described in the previous literature (Cherezov et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The LCP-FRAP experiments have been widely used in protein crystal screening for different optimized constructs and crystallization condition optimization (Cherezov et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The key points of the good-diffracting crystal optimization are summarized as following:\nAt first, the constructs with N-terminal fusion show good homogeneity and thermal stability, however, no crystals were obtained after extensive crystallization trials. This may be due to the flexibility of the N-terminal fusion. Then, the optimization of protein constructs was focused on the fusion proteins at ICL3.",
    "The aSEC and CPM results showed that inserting T4L (T4 Lysozyme) or Fla (Flavodoxin) fusion protein into ICL3 can improve the protein properties compared with other fusion proteins. Then, the FRAP assay was used to test the diffusion of CB2 constructs with T4L or Fla in the lipid cubic phase. The construct with T4L fusion protein shows better diffusion properties compared with that of Fla. Usually, the protein construct with good diffusion activity will facilitate the nucleation and crystal growth.\nExtensive optimization including crystallization conditions and junction sites of T4L were performed. However, the best diffraction resolution of the crystals is around 10 Å. In order to improve the resolution, a series of N-terminal truncation construct was further optimized and used for crystallization trials. The crystallization results showed that the N-terminal truncation played very important role in improving the diffraction of the crystals.\nFinally, the construct CB2-T4L describe in this protocol, which has T4L insertion at residues Ser222-Ala235, five mutations (Gly782.48Leu, Thr1273.46Ala, Thr1533.45Leu, Arg2426.32Glu, Gly3048.48Glu), N-terminal truncation of residues 1–20, as well as C-terminal truncation of residues 326–360, could significantly improve the crystal quality and used for the final structure determination of CB2 in complex with antagonist AM10257.\nCrystal diffraction data collection, processing, and structure determination\nTiming: 7 days\nGPCR crystals are relatively small, they are more suitable for Microfocus Beamlines for crystal diffraction data collection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/706-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Elucidation of the 3D structure of CB2 and the binding mode of AM10257\nThe frozen crystals in this project were mainly collected at the BL41XU beamline in the Spring-8 synchrotron radiation source in Japan.\nThe beamline station is equipped with an Eiger fast reading detector for collecting diffraction images, which greatly improved the data collection efficiency.",
    "LCP coatings during the crystal fishing process, the diffraction scanning system (raster scan) is often used for automatic identification of crystal locations and diffraction quality screening.\nCollecting a large amount of crystal diffraction data, XDS software was used for data processing.\nThe software CCP4, Phenix and Coot are generally used for structure determination and refinement (Emsley et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])."
