    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWide-field calcium imaging\nTiming: 1 h\nWide-field calcium imaging of the whole body can show correlations between specific neuronal activity and behavior.\nNote: Example microscope setup – A fluorescence dissecting microscope (Leica M165) equipped with a long-pass GFP filter set (Leica filter set ET GFP M205FA/M165FC), a 1.6× Plan Apo objective, and an sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0) is used to image Hydra mounted between a coverslip and a glass slide separated by a 150–200 μm spacer. Neuronal activity is imaged at a frame rate of 2 Hz for approximately 1 h.\nMounting Hydra.\nPrepare a glass slide and a coverslip: Clean the glass slide and a coverslip with ethanol, rinse with water, and dry.\nAttach the spacer: Remove the protective film from one side of the spacer and stick it onto the glass slide.\nAn optimal preparation will have a firm attachment of the spacer (at a height of 150–200 μm) without any wrinkles.\nMount Hydra: Place transgenic Hydra expressing GCaMP6s in a specific neuron type onto the glass surrounded by a spacer.\nAn optimal preparation will have Hydra well submerged in Hydra medium and not touching the spacer.\nGently lower a clean glass cover slip onto the top of Hydra without introducing air bubbles (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2883-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mounting Hydra for calcium imaging\n(A) Hydra cultured in a 10 cm round plastic dish.\n(B) Hydra mounted in a confined space: 1. Glass slide, 2. Glass coverslip, 3. Spacer, and 4. Hydra submerged with Hydra media.",
    "Note: It is important to use a Hydra of a small size so that it is not overly compressed, as excessive compression can stress the Hydra and alter its neuronal activity and behavior. It may take practice to empirically find the right-sized Hydra for the imaging. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nImaging.\nPrepare the microscope: Turn on the fluorescent microscope and adjust the settings for imaging. Place the glass slide mounted with Hydra onto the microscope stage.\nThe recommended reference parameters are as follows: Magnification = 3‒5; light intensity = set intensity switch to maximum; exposure time = approximately 200 ms.\nSet imaging parameters: Choose imaging parameters that suit experimental needs.\nBegin imaging: Start imaging the whole-body Hydra, and continue for the desired length of time. Keep an eye on the Hydra throughout the imaging session to ensure it remains within the field of view.\nNote: As an example, the frame rate can be set to greater than 2 Hz to cover faster neuronal activity of Hydra, and exposure/acquisition time can be set to be optimized for fluorescent signal and movement of Hydra.\nNote: A dissection microscope can be used to achieve a greater depth of field and a larger field of view, ensuring clear imaging of neuronal activity and body movement during Hydra’s behavior. Alternatively, a compound microscope can be used for the same purpose by using an objective with lower magnification or a larger numerical aperture. The issue of the depth of field with compound microscopes can also be overcome by using techniques such as focus stacking.",
    "Critical: It is important to set the camera frame rate to be over 2 Hz to capture all neuronal spikes, as faster spikes in Hydra can reach up to 1 Hz.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Additionally, it is recommended to image for about 1 h to record less frequent behaviors such as somersaulting, which occurs on average only 1–2 times per h.\nTwo-photon stimulation\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe aim of this protocol is to use two-photon laser stimulation to investigate the causal relationship between neuronal activity and behavior using Hydra expressing GCaMP6s in a specific neuron type.\nNote: Example microscope setup (used in Yamamoto and Yuste, 2023)6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] – A modified two-photon laser scanning microscope (Ultima In Vivo, Bruker) was used.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] GCaMP6s signals are recorded using a Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) with its wavelength tuned to 940 nm, and photostimulation was performed by using a low repetition rate pulse-amplified laser (Spirit 1040–8, Spectra-physics) with a fixed wavelength of 1040 nm. The power of both lasers is controlled by two independent Pockels cells. The two laser beams on the sample are individually controlled by two independent sets of galvanometric scanning mirrors. Short movies (approximately 270 s) with a sample rate of 3.64 Hz are collected (Imaging laser power <50 mW; dwell time 2 ms/pixel; 256 × 256 pixels in the whole field of view).\nCritical: To minimize cell damage, the power of photostimulation is adjusted on each neuron to the lowest value that elicits a response. Single-cell photostimulation is performed with a spiral pattern scanned by a pair of galvanometric mirrors delivered to the center of the cell (3 μm diameter; 3 spiral revolutions) for 30 ms.",
    "Note: An electrically tunable lens (ETL) is used to adjust and keep the same focal plane between imaging and photostimulation. Simultaneous imaging and photostimulation are controlled by PrairieView and custom-made software to control an ETL and data acquisition (DAQ, USB-6008, NI) running in MATLAB.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nNote: Optogenetics is not yet feasible in Hydra due to inability to express exogenous opsin proteins using available transgenic techniques. However, two-photon laser can evoke neuronal activity without exogenously expressing channel rhodopsin. This method evokes neuronal activity likely through various mechanisms, including photothermal,9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] photomechanical,10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] and photochemical effects.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nOptical settings (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2883-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Two-photon stimulation of Hydra\n(A) 25× Objective.\n(B) An illuminator with a bandpass filter (650 ± 8 nm) to visualize Hydra behavior.\n(C) Hydra mounted as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], placed above the center of a through hole of the stage for a behavior camera to record the behavior from underneath.\n(D) A custom-made stage with through holes at the focus of the imaging/stimulating laser and behavior camera.\n(E) A behavior camera with another bandpass filter (650 ± 8 nm) to record Hydra behavior.\nPlace a stage with a through hole larger in size than the Hydra.\nPlace a behavior camera beneath the stage.\nInstall 25× objective.\nPlace bandpass filters on both the behavior camera and the external illuminator.\nNote: It is essential to filter light at the wavelength that is used for imaging and stimulation to not interfere with the recording of Hydra behavior.\nMounting Hydra.\nMount Hydra as described in the previous step (Step 1a).\nCalibration of photostimulation laser.",
    "As laser systems use various galvanometers, photostimulation (via uncaging galvanometers) needs to be calibrated precisely to target the same x, y coordinates as the imaging laser. This can be done using a built-in function of PrairieView software (Please refer to the manual that is available for download at https://eliceirilab.org/sites/default/files/PrairieViewManual_5_2013_0.pdf[href=https://eliceirilab.org/sites/default/files/PrairieViewManual_5_2013_0.pdf]). To align the z plane, an ETL is used.\nPlace an autofluorescent plastic slide.\nStart the system, with keeping the light on with the filter.\nOpen PrairieView software.\nDefine scan settings (Image Size, Dwell Time, Sampling period, etc.) in the main control window. The same parameter setting work for different experiments.\nStart two-photon imaging according to the manual.\nConduct Point Photoactivation/Uncaging to calibrate the location and power of laser stimulation.\nUse the electrically tunable lens (ETL) controller program to locate the photostimulation focal plane aligned to the imaging focal plane.\nNote: The alignment of the imaging system and calibration should be done before photostimulation.\nNote: In sub-step d, set the \"Image Size\" according to the desired field of view so that multiple target neurons can be observed, the \"Dwell Time\" according to the laser power and desired signal-to-noise ratio (longer dwell times will result in better signal-to-noise ratio but slower imaging), and the \"Sampling Period\" according to the desired imaging rate (shorter sampling periods will result in faster imaging but lower signal-to-noise ratio). These parameters should be set just enough to see the morphology and the activity of neurons to ensure the well-targeted stimulation. Please refer to the beginning paragraph of this section for approximate parameter values.\nOnline two-photon stimulation.\nSet up the parameters such as time and the number of stimuli (ex. 3 μm diameter; 3 spiral revolutions, and 30 ms).",
    "On the PrairieView software, open the “Mark Points” window and choose “Live/Ablation” to enable laser pulses upon clicking the mouse.\nLocate a neuron of interest by moving the manipulator.\nOptimize the laser power to determine the lowest power required for efficient stimulation. Start from low power (approximately 5 mW) and increase it by 5 mW steps until the laser reaches neuronal activation.\nStart simultaneous recordings of calcium imaging and behavior imaging.\nStimulate the neuron selected during the imaging recordings (online).\nRepeat steps from 6c to 6f with different neurons until the Hydra starts to move faster.\nNote: These parameters can be determined empirically. The diameter of the spiral should be within the diameter of the cells, which is around 5–10 μm. The number of spiral revolutions and the duration of the stimulation should be set to efficiently stimulate neurons. In our setup, we found the spiral diameter of 3 μm, 3 spiral revolutions, and a duration of 30 ms worked well.\nNote: Compressing Hydra under a cover slip limits its movement to a confined space but is necessary for imaging. However, excessive compression can stress Hydra and disturb its neuronal activity and behavior. Therefore, it is crucial to find the right size of Hydra that is compressed enough to limit its movement without being stressed. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nTwo-photon ablation\nTiming: 2–3 h\nGFP-expressing neurons are ablated using a two-photon laser to establish the function of specific neuron types for behaviors. The following protocol is based on the same setup as two-photon stimulation with a few additional steps.\nSet up lights and filters.\nFollow the same setup as two-photon stimulation (Step 3).\nMounting Hydra.\nPrepare two clean glass coverslips.",
    "Remove the film from one side of a spacer and stick it onto a glass coverslip to reach a depth of 150–200 μm.\nPlace a small amount of non-toxic grease on the film of the spacer (non-sticky side), and brush it to form a thin layer.\nMount Hydra expressing GFP in a specific neuron type with Hydra media onto the glass, and place another glass cover slip on top without introducing air bubbles.\nPress the glass coverslip to make it stick better.\nNote: Neurons on either side of Hydra need to be ablated, so glass coverslips are used on both sides. The grease ensures that there is no leakage of water when handling the sample.\nCalibration of laser.\nFollow the same step as two-photon stimulation (Step 5).\nTwo-photon ablation.\nOptimize the laser power using the “Live/Ablation” mode of the PrairieView software to determine the lowest power required for efficient ablation.\nUsing the manipulator to locate each neuron, ablate neurons individually so that all accessible neurons are ablated on one side of the Hydra.\nFlip the coverslip to the other side and repeat the ablation process for the remaining neurons. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nBehavioral imaging and analysis\nTiming: 3–4 h\nAfter ablation, the freely behaving Hydra is imaged using a bright field microscope. Hydra is mounted in a dish to allow free behavior while limiting movement outside the focal range. The behavior is recorded for 1 h, since some spontaneous behavior may occur only once per hour.\nMounting Hydra (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2883-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Behavioral imaging of Hydra after neuronal ablation\n(A) Hydra mounted in a well: 1. Glass coverslip attached to the side of the well with grease, 2. A well depth of 700–750 μm, and 3. Hydra submerged in Hydra media.",
    "(B) A dissection microscope (Leica) attached to a high-speed camera (Hamamatsu) is used for behavior imaging.\nPrepare a glass-bottom culture dish and a clean glass cover slip.\nPlace Hydra on the glass well with media.\nApply a small amount of non-toxic grease around the glass well.\nPlace the glass coverslip to cover the glass well, and press down to create a tight seal.\nAdd Hydra media on top of it to prevent evaporation during imaging.\nNote: The depth between the coverslip and the glass bottom of the well should be approximately 700 μm for Hydra to behave freely.\nImaging (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nPlace the glass-bottom dish on the stage of a microscope equipped with a high-speed camera.\nSet the imaging parameter to a frame rate > 1 Hz.\nStart recording the behavior of Hydra for 1 h, ensuring that the glass coverslip remains attached during the entire recording. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nTracking Hydra movements.\nCritical: An open-source software package for markerless pose estimation, DeepLabCut,16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] is used to track the position of Hydra body parts such as mouth, mid-body, foot, and basal disc. This software package has several dependencies, including Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-image, Matplotlib, H5PY, and PyQt5. You must install these dependencies before running DeepLabCut using Python’s package manager, pip. Follow the instructions to ensure that all required packages are installed.\nNote: This part explains how the GUI of DeepLabCut to track the position of Hydra body parts. For specific instructions of how to use the GUI, how to change parameters please refer to Nath et al., 2019.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nCreate a new project: Launch the Anaconda prompt and activate the DeepLabCut environment. Open the DeepLabCut GUI and enter the project name and the video file path.",
    "Assign labels: Edit the config file to assign names for the body parts that are being tracked (e.g., mouth, midbody, foot, basaldisc).\nExtract frames: Extract frames to be labeled using the default setting (using kmeans algorithm and openCV).\nLabel frames: Use the mouse to manually label the Hydra body parts in each frame.\nCreate training dataset: Create a new training dataset using the default setting (using resnet_50 for the network).\nTrain network: Select the number of iterations as around 20,000. Train the network.\nCreate videos: Create a labeled video with the tracked movement. Evaluate the tracking by assessing the labeled video. If the labels do not jump between frames, move to the step 14.\nExtract outlier frames: Extract outlier frames that need to be relabeled using the default setting.\nRefine labels: Refine the labeling of the outlier frames to improve the accuracy of the network. Use the refined labeling to repeat e-g.\nNote: Move to step 14 when the labeled video has only a few outlier frames (around 10 frames or less), as the values computed during quantification will be smoothed.\nNote: You can save time by refining labels repeatedly, rather than increasing the number of iterations for training the network. Also, by reducing the number of frames in the video by a factor of 10, you can decrease the time for training the network.\nQuantifying Hydra movements.\nWe describe a Python code that analyzes the movement of Hydra based on x, y coordinates acquired at Step 13. The code computes parameters including time, body length, body length speed, basal disc distance, basal disc speed, and foot angle. Additionally, as an example of a behavior, the code identifies the number and time locations of somersaults by thresholding the computed parameters.",
    "Note: To run the code, you need to import the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib packages. Each cell is executed in order. The following sub-steps explain what each cell does when run in Google Colab.\nOur code is available for download at https://github.com/NTCColumbia/Hydra_Somersaulting/blob/main/DLC_Analysis_WY.ipynb[href=https://github.com/NTCColumbia/Hydra_Somersaulting/blob/main/DLC_Analysis_WY.ipynb].\nUpload the file with x, y coordinates in CSV format acquired at the previous step.\nRename the headers of the CSV file to prepare it for analysis.\nConvert all the numbers to float.\nCompute parameters including body length, body length speed, basal disc distance, basal disc speed, and foot angle.\nThrow out noise for the body length using high pass filter.\nPlot the filtered body length over time.\nCompute the number and time locations of somersaults.\nNote: The threshold for detecting somersaults (substep g) should be determined based on the graph of basal disc speed generated in a previous cell, and the minimum and maximum thresholds should be used to exclude noise."
