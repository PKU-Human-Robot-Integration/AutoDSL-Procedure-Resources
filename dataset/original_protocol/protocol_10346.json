    "The Animal Care Committee of the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) and the Government of Middle Franconia, Germany, approved all the experiments. For the experiments, male Lewis rats with a body weight of 300 - 350 g were used.\n1. The Arteriovenous Loop Model in the Rat\nImplantation Procedure (Figure 2)\nFor anesthesia use a special plastic box that is connected via tube to the isoflurane vaporizer and closed by a lid. Turn on supply gas and flow meter between 0.8 - 1.5 L/min.\nPlace the rat in the induction plastic box and seal the top. Turn on isoflurane vaporizer to 5%.\nCarefully observe the rat during induction of anesthesia. After 3 - 4 min, the rat will be anesthetized.\nConfirm proper anesthesia: loss of righting reflex, loss of palpebral reflex, withdrawal reflex, positive corneal reflex.\nRemove the rat from the box and check its weight for calculation of drugs. Apply eye ointment to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nAdminister pain medication and antibiotics (e.g., 7.5 mg/kg enrofloxacin subcutaneously (s. c.), 12.5 mg/kg tramadol and 100 mg/kg metamizole both intravenously (i. v.)). Administer weight-adapted crystalloids during operation (e.g., 30 ml/kg s. c.).\nPlace the rat on its back on a warming plate at 37 °C under anesthesia with 1 - 2% isoflurane inhalation administered via mask.",
    "Monitor anesthesia properly and increase isoflurane if anesthesia level is too low (movement of the rat, response to pain, jaw tone, no loss of reflexes (see 1.1.4.), heart rate increasing). Be careful not to overdose isoflurane (loss of corneal reflexes, high heart rate, decrease in oxygen saturation). Use a special pulse oximetry for small animals for checking the oxygen saturation (95 - 100%) and heart rate (250 - 450/min) of the rat. During the operation monitor temperature of the rat (36 - 40 °C) and adjust temperature of the warming plate if necessary.\nShave the inner sides of the hind limbs with an electric razor and disinfect the area with antiseptics. Spread the hind limbs and fix them with adhesive tape.\nLay the rat under a surgical microscope and cover the rat with sterile draping. Ensure that the whole operation procedure is performed under sterile conditions.\nOpen the skin in the middle of the left thigh with a longitudinal incision from the upper knee to the groin using a scalpel (No. 10).\nCut the subcutaneous tissue and fascia in layers of approximately 3 cm in length using dissecting scissors and microforceps until the femoral vascular bundle is exposed from the pelvic artery in the groin to the bifurcation of the femoral artery in the knee.\nSeparate the vessels and remove the adventitia using adventitia scissors and microforceps.\nCoagulate the side branches using electric coagulation. Cover the operation field with a damp compress.\nOpen the skin on the right side as described for the left side, 1.1.11 - 1.1.14.\nFor harvesting the venous graft, ligate the right femoral vein by electric coagulation on the proximal and distal ends at a distance of 1 - 1.5 cm.",
    "Remove the venous graft with microforceps and flush the venous graft with a heparin solution (50 IU/ml in 0.9% sodium chloride solution) using an irrigation cannula and transfer it to the left thigh. Cover the operation field at the right side with a damp compress.\nLigate the femoral vein on the left side proximally at the inguinal region with a microvessel clamp. Coagulate the femoral vein distally by electric coagulation, at the upper knee before branching, at a distance of about 2 cm.\nFor anastomosis connect the proximal end of the venous graft with the proximal end of the vein by end-to-end anastomosis with an 11-0 suture. Use about 8 interrupted sutures. Begin with placing the first two sutures at the 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock positions. Then, put in 2 to 3 more sutures between these points on the front side and then put 2 to 3 more sutures into the back side.\nLigate the femoral artery in the same way described for the femoral vein (1.1.18.). Make sure the loop vessels are not twisted. Anastomose the distal end of the venous graft with the proximal end of the artery as described for the femoral vein (steps 1.1.19.).\nAdminister 25 IU heparin intravenously. Make again sure the loop vessels are not twisted, Remove the clamps and check for leakage and patency of the loop for about 5 min.\nDribble papaverine (e.g., 4 mg/ml) on the vessels to prevent vascular spasms. If there is patency, the loop expands and the pulse of the artery can be observed.\nPrefill the implantation chamber with the first half (about 500 µl) of the matrix (e.g., a hydrogel or a bone matrix with or without cells). Embed the loop into the implantation chamber.",
    "Fill the implantation chamber with the second half of the matrix to a total volume of 1,000 µl. Seal the chamber with the chamber lid.\nFix the implantation chamber on the thigh with a non-absorbable 6-0 suture. Fix the chamber lid with a non-absorbable 6-0 suture. Stop possible bleeding with electric coagulation.\nClose the skin with absorbable 4-0 sutures. Cover the wound with aluminum spray.\nAdminister antibiotics and analgesics (e.g., 7.5 mg/kg enrofloxacin s. c., tramadol 12.5 mg/kg per os (p. o.) (through drinking water) for 3 - 5 days and afterwards depending on the behavior of the rat).\nTurn the vaporizer off and allow the rat to breathe supply gas until it begins to awaken.\nPlace the rat in a box with thermal support and observe it carefully until fully recovered.\nDo not leave the rat unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nDo not return the rat to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nExplantation Procedure\nPerform the explantation after a short-time or long-time implantation (according to the study design, for examples please see References 27-32). Anesthetize the rat according to steps 1.1.1.-1.1.9.\nOpen the skin of the abdomen with a scalpel (No. 10) and move the intestines aside with a compress. Expose the abdominal aorta and the vena cava caudalis using cotton swabs.\nCannulate the abdominal aorta (e.g., 24 gauge plastic cannula) and cut the vena cava caudalis with dissecting scissors.\nFlush the abdominal aorta with 0.9% sodium chloride solution containing 100 IU/ml heparin until the leaking fluid is clear. Perfuse the aorta with 30 ml perfusion solution (e.g., contrast agent or India ink).\nEuthanize the rat by injection of a lethal dose of embutramide, mebezonium iodide, tetracaine hydrochloride injectable solution (0.1 - 0.2 ml/kg) in deep anesthesia.",
    "Ligate the abdominal aorta and vena cava caudalis with a non-absorbable 4-0 suture.\nClose the open wound area with 1 - 2 clamps. Store the rat for 24 hr at 4 °C (curing of the perfusion solution).\nPlace the rat on its back. Spread the hind limbs and fix them with adhesive tape.\nOpen the skin above the chamber with a longitudinal incision with a scalpel (No. 10).\nRemove the connective tissue from the chamber and the loop pedicle using dissecting scissors and microforceps. Cut the loop pedicle at a distance of 1 cm from the chamber opening with dissecting scissors and remove the chamber.\nOpen the lid of the chamber and carefully remove the construct from the chamber with forceps and fix it in 4% buffered formalin solution for 24 hr at room temperature. Afterwards use the construct for 3D micro-computed tomography or paraffin-embedded for histological analysis30.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
