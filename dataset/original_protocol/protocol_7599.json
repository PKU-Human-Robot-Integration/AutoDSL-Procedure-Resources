    "Pre-experiments to determine bacterial viability on wood blocks Grow bacterial isolates in 5 mL of TS liquid medium overnight (25 °C, 220 rpm, uncontrolled light/dark conditions).Harvest bacteria and wash them with 1 mL of 0.85% NaCl solution (3×, centrifugation at 5,900× g for 10 min).Use a Thoma chamber to adjust the bacterial suspension to 108 CFU/mL with 0.85% NaCl solution (end volume minimum 10 mL).Immerse the autoclaved wood blocks with bacterial suspension and incubate them in a sterile glass Petri dish overnight at 25 °C.The next day, imprint the wood blocks gently on TSA plates, using a sterilised tweezer. Remove the wood blocks. Incubate at 25 °C overnight to 24 h.If bacteria grow rapidly on TSA plates, they are useable for the main experiment.Preparation of the main experiment Establish fungus on solid agar medium (Figure 1; here, S. lacrymans was pre-cultivated on modified Melin-Norkrans (MMN) for 3–4 weeks at 25 °C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4837/bioprotoc-13-19-4837-g001.jpgFigure 1. Established culture of S. lacrymans. Arrow: peripheral zoneAdd mycelia-covered agar plugs (use a sterilizable punch, ~0.8 cm × 0.7 cm × 1.1 cm) to vessels filled with 25 mL of MEA medium.Note: Use the peripheral zone of the pre-culture(s). Set aside some vessels, as they serve as control (Figure 1). Incubate in darkness for four weeks (25 °C).In the meantime:Number the wood blocks (50 ± 0.5 mm × 25 ± 0.5 mm × 15 ± 0.5 mm, e.g., from Picea abies).Autoclave wood blocks (120 °C) and note their weights (maintain sterile conditions, e.g., put balance under the sterile workbench). Keep them in a sterile environment until use.Put a minimum of four moisture control specimen wood blocks in the oven and dry them at ~50 °C for 72 h.Weigh and record the dry mass of the moisture control wood blocks.Number and weigh glass Petri dishes.",
    "Setup of the main experiment Start to prepare bacteria approximately 2–3 days before fungal cultures are ready. Culture them on TSA medium (25 °C).Inoculate 5 mL of liquid TS medium with bacteria (25 °C, 220 rpm, overnight).Harvest bacteria and wash them with 0.85% NaCl solution (3×, centrifugation at 5,900× g for 10 min)Use a Thoma chamber to adjust the bacterial suspension to 108 CFU/mL (use 0.85% NaCl solution).Immerse the numbered, autoclaved, and weighed wood blocks with the bacterial suspension, remove them immediately, drain the excess suspension (sterilised filter paper) and put one (immersed) wood block in each vessel with fungal mycelium. Prepare a minimum of five replicates.Note: Set aside some vessels as they serve as control. For each approach, put wood blocks in vessels filled with MEA but without mycelium, as these are additional controls (axenic bacterial controls) (minimum triplicates per bacterium).Treat a minimum of 14 wood blocks solely with 0.85% NaCl solution and place them on top of the mycelium (axenic fungal control).Incubate the vessels at 25 °C in darkness (e.g., put them in a carton package) for eight weeks (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4837/bioprotoc-13-19-4837-g002.jpgFigure 2. Preparation and setup procedure of the wood decay experiment. Illustration of sections B and C.Harvesting Remove superficial mycelium from the wood blocks with sterilised tweezers (Figure 2). Collect the mycelium under sterile conditions for further use in step D3.Imprint the wood blocks on TSA plates and incubate them at 25 °C.Put each wood in one numbered and pre-weighed glass Petri dish; the numeration should match.Weigh the wood blocks + Petri dish.Dry the wood blocks at approximately 50 °C.Weigh the mycelium collected from the wood.Dilute the mycelium sample 1:10 with NaCl solution (0.85%).Shake the mycelium solution for 30 min on a rotary shaker.",
    "Plate 100 μL of the solution on TSA agar plates and incubate at 25 °C.Use the residual solution.For plate casting after Koch (if less than 1 mL):i. Mix residual solution with 3 mL of TSA soft agar.ii. Vortex gently.iii. Pour evenly on TSA plates.For concentration on a nitrocellulose filter with vacuum (if more than 1 mL):i. Clean the filter unit with 96% EtOH and sterilise the tweezers.ii. Install the sterile filtration funnel and the filter.iii. Pour the solution on the filter.iv. Apply vacuum.v. Put the filter on TSA medium.Incubate all agar plates at 25 °C and check daily for growth (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4837/bioprotoc-13-19-4837-g003.jpgFigure 3. Harvesting and evaluation procedure of the wood-decay experiment. Illustration of sections D and E.Evaluation Weigh dried wood blocks.The wood blocks can stay in the glass Petri dish, as the weight was determined at the start of the experiment.Weigh them daily until they are dry (should take no longer than 2–3 days).Check TSA plates for growth, documenting on which plates growth occurs.Use single bacteria colonies for establishment of pure cultures (TSA agar plate, 25 °C).Perform colony PCR and check if bacteria match with applied species by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene (Embacher et al., 2021).i. Prepare PCR reaction: mix 12.5 μL of Red Taq DNA Polymerase Master Mix (2×) with 0.625 mL of each of the primers 27F and 1492R (10 μmol), 10.75 μL of distilled water, and 0.5 μL of BSA (2%) (total volume = 25 μL).ii. Pick a single bacterial colony not older than three days with a sterile toothpick and add it to the PCR mixture.iii.",
    "Transfer the reactions to the PCR cycler: PCR conditions are 95 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min.iv. Check the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis (sodium borate buffer 1×, 100 V, approximately 20 min) to confirm their correct size (~1,550 bp).v. Purify the PCR reaction(s) (PEG protocol by Travis Glenn).1) Transfer 18 μL of the respective PCR reaction(s) into a 1.5 mL tube and mix with 16 μL of PEG (20%) by constantly pipetting the solution up and down.2) Put it on the thermo shaker (37 °C, 800 rpm) for 15 min.3) Centrifuge at 15,000× g for 15 min at RT (21 °C).4) Discharge the supernatant (as it contains leftover polymerases, primer dimers, and unused dNTPs interfering with the subsequent sequencing reaction).5) Wash the pellet with 50 μL of ice-cold 80% ethanol (-20 °C).6) Centrifuge at 15,000× g for 2 min at RT (21 °C).7) Remove the supernatant.8) Repeat the centrifugation step and remove the supernatant completely.9) Incubate the tubes on the thermo shaker (37 °C and 800 rpm) with lid open until no trace (visible drops as well as smell) of ethanol is left.10) Add 18 μL of nuclease-free water.11) Pipette the nuclease-free water up and down several times (this ensures that the DNA is fully resuspended in the water).vi. Check the purified PCR products again with agarose gel electrophoresis (sodium borate buffer 1×, 100 V, approximately 20 min) (Figure 3).vii. Send for sequencing [using e.g., the Microsynth sequencing service (Balgach, Switzerland)]."
