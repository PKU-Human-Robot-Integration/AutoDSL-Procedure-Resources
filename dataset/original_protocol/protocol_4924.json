    "Production of HIV-1Note: HIV-1 particles are produced after calcium phosphate transfection in 293FT cells.293FT cell culture293FT cells are cultured in D10 medium in 10 cm plates, in the presence of 500 μg/ml of Geneticin®. When approaching confluence, cells are trypsinized (0.05% trypsin), washed by centrifugation (475 x g, 5 min at 4 °C) and plated after 1/5 dilution in 10 cm plates. Plate 8 x 106/15 cm plate, 293FT cells the day before transfection in 30 ml of D10 medium without Geneticin®. One 15 cm plate is going to produce 20 ml of virus, so transfection experiment should be scaled accordingly.Note: In order to maximize viral particle production, 293FT cells are never kept more than 3 weeks in culture (After 3 weeks, always go back to frozen starting aliquots). Calcium phosphate transfectionNote: The Promega kit is used for calcium phosphate transfection. Transfection protocol is described for transfection in one 15 cm plate. Dilute 60 μg of DNA (X4-HIV-Gag-iGFP) with 1.12 ml nuclease-free H2O in a 15 ml conical tube (tube 1).Add 168 μl of CaCl2, 2 M, to the diluted DNA.In another tube (tube 2), add 1,350 μl of 2x HEPES-buffered saline (2x HBS).While gently vortexing tube 2, add dropwise the prepared DNA solution to the HBS in tube 2.Incubate the solution at room temperature for 30 min.Vortex the transfection solution again just before adding it to the cells.Add the solution containing DNA- CaCl2-HBS, dropwise in various places around the plate.Swirl the plate to distribute the solution evenly.20 h after transfection, carefully replace the culture medium with 20 ml of D10 medium without G418.24 h after medium change, harvest the supernatant.Filter the supernatant twice (to remove cells and debris) with 0.45 μm sterile filter unit with PVDF membrane.Filtered viral supernatant can be used fresh or stored at -80 °C.",
    "Differentiation of monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs)Obtaining peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs are obtained from buffy coats ordered from the New York Blood Center using mononuclear cell isolation with Ficoll-Paque separation media. Ficoll and DPBS are brought to room temperature (RT).Recover blood from buffy coat using 60 ml syringe and 18 G thick needle.Mix blood with RT DPBS (1:1 ratio).Add 25 ml of diluted blood using a needle to a 50 ml Falcon tube already containing 15 ml of Ficoll.Centrifuge for 30 min at 845 x g, RT and with brake off. Recover the white leukocyte layer (in between the yellow serum and the red platelets layers) with a plastic pipette.Wash the leukocyte layers containing the PBMCs with cold DPBS, centrifuge at 170 x g for 10 min at 4 °C (slow spin to remove platelets).Resuspend the cells in MACS buffer, wash, spin at 475 x g, 5 min at 4 °C.Count the cells.Add 50 μl of anti-human CD14 microbeads from Miltenyi and 950 μl MACS buffer per 100 million PBMCs.20 min incubation at 4 °C. Note: While doing the staining of PBMCs with anti CD14 magnetic beads, always do the staining in the fridge rather than on ice in order to prevent antibody ‘capping effect’. Wash in MACS buffer, then spin at 475 x g, 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend in 5 ml MACS buffer and filter using a 40 μm nylon cell strainer.Run the sample through an LS MACS separation column for positive selection.Perform 3 washes of the LS column, using 3 ml of MACS buffer.Recover the CD14+ cells from the column by using 5 ml of MACS buffer and a plunger. Count the cells and plate them at a concentration of 1 million/ml in DC medium with hGM-CSF (10 ng/ml) and hIL-4 (50 ng/ml).",
    "Note: To obtain optimal results regarding monocyte differentiation into MDDCs, plate 20 million monocytes per 10 cm plate, in 20 ml DC medium. 2 days post isolation, add 40% of new DC medium with hGM-CSF (10 ng/ml) and hIL-4 (50 ng/ml).4 days post isolation, check MDDC differentiation by flow cytometry: monitor upregulation of DC-SIGN and downregulation of CD14 (1/200 of stock solution for both antibodies). MDDC loading with HIV-1 or dextranPlate 50,000 MDDCs (1 million/ml) per well in a U bottom 96-well plate. Place the 96-well plate on ice, while adding HIV-1 or dextran molecules, for synchronization of capture.Add 50 ng of HIV-1 or 100 μg/ml of FITC-labeled dextran molecules of various size (10kDa, 70kDa, 500kDa, 2,000kDa). Note: Don’t forget to add negative controls: no virus or dextran and/or cells staying at 4 °C.Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for 4 and 24 h for HIV-1 and 30 min and 4 h for dextran molecules.After incubation, wash extensively by adding 200 μl cold DPBS and centrifuge 5 min, 475 x g at 4 °C. Repeat the washing step 3 times. Analyze HIV-1 or dextran capture.Analysis of HIV-1 or dextran capture by flow cytometryFor flow cytometry analysis, take the cells loaded with dextran or HIV-1.Stain with 50 μl of a live/dead blue fixable dye diluted in HBSS (1x) (1/500) 15 min on ice. Wash using MACS buffer, 475 x g, 5 min, 4 °C.Stain with anti-hDC-SIGN-PE (1/200 diluted in MACS buffer) and anti-hCD14-APC (1/200 diluted in MACS buffer) to control for MDDC differentiation.Incubate for 30 min, 4 °C, covered.Wash using MACS buffer, 475 x g, 5 min, 4 °C.Resuspend in 100 μl.For dextran detection, no further staining is required. For HIV-1 detection, cells need to be fixed, using 50 μl of BD Cytofix/CytopermTM, 20 min at 4 °C.",
    "Wash using 100 μl of BD perm/Wash buffer.Stain for HIV-1 capsid using anti-P24-RD1, diluted 1/500 in BD perm/Wash buffer. 1 h at RT.Wash using MACS buffer, 475 x g, 5 min, 4 °C.Resuspend in 100 μl.Proceed to flow cytometry analysis.Note: For flow cytometry, BD high throughput sampler (HTS) can be used to run 96-well plates. Analysis of HIV-1 capture by Quantitative PCR (QPCR)Real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed after reverse transcription using a Roche LightCycler 480 with Roche 480 SYBR Green I Master reagent according to manufacturer specifications. The relative abundance of HIV is calculated based on the amount of GFP mRNA (the virus encodes GFP) using a standard curve and normalized using GAPDH as a control.Total RNA is extracted from 3 x 50,000 MDDCs using TRIZOL® RNA isolation protocol. 5 μl of RNA is reverse transcribed using SuperScript® III first-strand synthesis system in a 20 μl final reaction volume.For each sample, 2 μl of diluted cDNA (dilution in water, 1/2 and 1/5) is used for QPCR reaction.QPCR mix:6 μl of 2x SYBR Green mix0.6 μl primer F (10 μM)0.6 μl primer R (10 μM)2.8 μl of H2O2 μl of cDNAQPCR reaction:Step 1: 95 °C, 5 minStep 2: 95 °C, 5 sec Step 3: 60 °C, 30 sec Step 4: 72 °C, 20 sec Back to step 2, 50 cyclesQPCR analysis: based on standard curve, determine GFP mRNA quantity and normalize it by GAPDH in each sample.Analysis of HIV-1 or dextran capture by confocal microscopy (Figures 1 and 2)MDDCs loaded with HIV-1 or dextran are put on coverslips previously coated with poly-L-lysine solution, for 30 min at 37 °C.Phalloidin staining (to detect cortical actin), or any cell surface staining, is performed in PBS-1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature (Figure 2).",
    "For fixation, incubate with warm paraformaldehyde A (PFA) (2%) in PHEM buffer, for 10 min at room temperature.Permeabilize in 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PHEM buffer, for 5 min at RT.Blocking is done in 5% casein solution, 1 h at 4 °C.For intracellular staining (if needed), antibodies are diluted in 5% casein solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.For nuclear detection, cells are then stained with DAPI, (1/5,000 dilution from stock at 5 mg/ml in H2O), at RT (Figures 1 and 2).Upon 5 washing (200 μl each) in PBS-0.1% BSA, cells are mounted in a homemade DABCO-PVA medium.Using a confocal microscope, analyze for each cell the intensity of internalized GFP or FITC, which represent, respectively, captured HIV-1 particles and dextran molecules. To do so, acquire 400 nm Z-stacks and determine the HIV-1 and dextran molecules. Quantification of HIV-1 and dextran uptake will be discussed in the Data analysis section.
