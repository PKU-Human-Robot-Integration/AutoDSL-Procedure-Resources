  "procedures": [
    "In the discrete paired-trial variable delay T-maze task, mice were exposed to a sequence of randomly chosen forced runs, each followed by a choice run so that they were required to integrate information held online (the forced run) with the learned rule (non-match to sample) (Papaleo et al., 2012). After a week of single housing, body weight and 24-h food intake are recorded for 3 consecutive days. Animals are then food restricted throughout the experiment to maintain 90% of their ad libitum body weight. During the first week of food-restriction, each animal is also habituated to the food reinforcer (14 mg, 5TUL, TestDiet, Richmond, IN) for three consecutive days. Thereafter, animals are habituated to the T-maze apparatus allowing to retrieve the food reinforcement for 10 min/day for two consecutive days. After this, animals are exposed to 1 day of 10 forced-alternation runs. The animals are placed in the T-maze with one goal arm closed off and will have up to 2 min to locate and eat the food reinforcer in the open arm. After consuming the food pellet, each mouse is given an inter-trial period of at least 20 min in the home cage, and then placed back in the maze for another forced run. Beginning on the following day, the discrete-trial delayed alternation training starts. Following a randomly chosen forced run, and a 4-s delay interval in the home cage, the mouse is placed back in the maze with access to both arms. The food reinforcer is located in the opposite arm entered in the previous forced trial. After an inter-trial period of 20 min, the animal is placed back in the maze for another forced run-choice run paired trial, for a total of ten paired trials per day. A different pseudo-randomly chosen pattern of forced runs (e.g.",
    ", R-R-L-R-L-L-RL-R-L) is used every day, but on a given day the same pattern is used for all animals. The apparatus must be cleaned with water and ethanol 10% after each trial with special attention to the choice point of the T-maze. Mice are trained at a 4-s inter-run delay and 20-min inter-trial delay for 20 days, or until the mouse successfully performs 8 correct out of 10 daily trials (80% choice accuracy) for 3 consecutive days. Animals that do not reach this criterion are eliminated. Once the mouse performs consistently at the 4-s inter-run delay, training at three additional inter-run delays (30, 60 and 240 s presented in a random fashion) and a 20-s inter-trial delay begins. Mice are given 4 trials of each delay on 4 consecutive days of testing for a total of 16 trials for each day. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200630/20200630210452_7591.jpgFigure 2. Timeline of the discrete paired-trial variable-delay T-maze task. Training: each discrete trial consists of a forced run–choice run pair (inter-run delay of 4 s and inter-trial delay of 15-20 m); Criterion: 80% of correct choices in three consecutive days (10 paired-trial/day); Final phase: intra-trial delay of 4 s, 30 s, 60 s and 240 s and inter-trial delay of 20 s (16 paired-trial/day for four consecutive days) (Papaleo et al., 2012; Leggio et al., 2019).Step by Step protocol Day 1: 5:00 PM: Weight and singly house each mouse. 1 min handling (H1). Change cage, water, filter and food.Day 2: Singly housing habituation.Day 3: Singly housing habituation. 1 min handling (H2).Day 4: Singly housing habituation.Day 5: Singly housing habituation. 1 min handling (H3).Day 6: Singly housing habituation.Day 7: Singly housing habituation.Day 8: Singly housing habituation.Day 9: About 5:00 PM weigh the food and each mouse.",
    "Day 10: About 5:00 PM, weigh each mouse and food (24 h intake)Day 11: About 5:00 PM, weigh each mouse and food (24 h intake). Take all food off, leave water on. Change cage, filter and water.Day 12: 5:00 PM, Animals are partially food-deprived and remain that way throughout the experiment. Give ≈ 60% of their 24 h intake. Check nest status.Day 13: 5:00 PM. Give ≈ 60% of their 24 h intake. Arrive to 90% of their initial weight.Day 14: 5:00 PM. Give ≈ 60% of their 24 h intake. Arrive to 90% of their initial weight.Put also the rewarding food (about 10 pellets of 5TUL 14 mg).Day 15: 5:00 PM. Give 60% of their 24 h intake. Put also the rewarding food (about 10 pellets of 14 mg). Arrive to 90% of their initial weight.Day 16: 5:00 PM. Give 60% of their 24 h intake. Put also the rewarding food (10 pellets of 14 mg). Arrive to 90% of their initial weight.Habituation period: Day 17: Each mouse is allowed to explore the maze with all doors raised for 10 min. Food is placed in both goal arms. Quantifying the time required to eat the 1st pellets. They have to eat all the food presented (max 16 pellets; 2 pellets in each goal arm).Day 18: Each mouse is allowed to explore the maze with all doors raised for 10 min. Food is placed in both goal arms. Quantifying the time required to eat the 1st pellets. They have to eat all the food presented (max 20 pellets; 2 pellets in each goal arm).Day 19: Animals are exposed to 1 day of 10 forced-alternation runs.",
    "Specifically, they are placed in the T-maze with one goal arm closed off and had up to 2 min to run and eat the reward in the open arm (only one pellet in the open arm). After consuming the reward, they are removed from the maze, one trial for each mouse. Run the experiment with about 10 cages in the room. Mice are tested back-to-back. One pellet at the end of the arms.Day 20-Day 39: Discrete paired-trial delayed alternation trainingEach discrete trial consists of a forced run–choice run pair.For the forced run, animals are constrained to enter a randomly chosen arm. After they consume the reward in that arm (timer started as soon as the animal has finished food) and a 4-s retention interval (this 4-s time is considered as a mean of time recorded to accomplished this procedure, see also Kellendonk et al., 2006), each mouse is placed back in the maze with access to both arms but with only the opposite arm entered in the previous forced run baited. On the forced run bait the alley with 1 pellet; on the free choice run bait the correct alley with 2 pellets. After an inter-trial period of about 15-20 min to avoid proactive interference from the last trial (Kellendonk et al., 2006), the mouse is placed back in the maze for another forced run. Test mice in the room back-to-back.A different, randomly chosen, pattern of forced runs (for example, R-R-L-R-L-L-R-L-R-L) is used every day. However, on a given day the same pattern is used for all animals. Animals are trained at a 4-s inter-run delay for 20 days, or until they successfully perform eight out of 10 trials (80% correct choices) for 3 consecutive days. Animals that don’t reach this criterion are rejected.Light cycle: 6-6. Habituation about 8:45 AM.",
    "Test from 9:45 AM to 5:00 PM Reefed animals about 5:00 PM. Day 40 or earlier: Once an animal performs consistently at the 4-s inter-run delay, training at three additional delays (30, 60 and 240 s) and with an inter-trial delay of only 20 s began. Mice are tested at all 4 inter-run delays for 4 consecutive days with 16 paired-trial/day (4 paired trial at each delay every day).Note: This procedure is considered stressful for animals because each mouse is consecutively tested in several trials (16-paired trials) for, at least, 45 min. Conversely, during the training phase of the paradigm, each mouse performs 10-paired trials per day with an inter-trial-interval of 10 min."
