    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBait the training mazes\nTiming: 15 min\nEach maze plate contains nine mazes, according to the mold design described above (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Each maze plate is used either as Training or as Testing plate. Training mazes are baited to attract nematodes toward a specific side arm. Each Training plate is used within 1 h from the first baiting or is discarded.\nThe experimental protocol and the preference indices introduced to assess C. elegans behavior in the maze have been developed for use with an attractant, namely OP50 or a mix of OP50 and L-lysine. We have also used successfully isoamyl alcohol 10% in ethanol (data not shown). Other attractants or food sources could be used, or even repellents. In case of the latter, the preference indices (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]) should be adjusted and interpreted accordingly. We have not assessed C. elegans learning in the maze driven by a repellent, e.g., negative associative learning.\nTilt the Training maze plate so that the target maze arm is lower than the rest of the maze\nPerform this step under a dissecting microscope.\nTilt the plate under a ∼45° angle.\nFeel free to rotate the plate to a position that allows you to reach the target location with the pipette tip.\nPipette carefully 1.2 microliters of liquid E. coli OP50 or other attractant onto the floor of the circular auxiliary area (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) of the target maze arm.\nUse long reach pipette tips, which can be more easily inserted in the narrow maze space.\nHold the pipette perpendicularly to the maze floor.\nAim for the edge between the maze floor and the circular wall of the auxiliary area.\nRelease the bait slowly but firmly.",
    "The inserted liquid should form a crescent-shape pocket between the maze floor and the circular wall of the auxiliary area.\nCritical: This step is critical. Loading the mazes wrongly will heavily affect the results. Refer to Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc7].\nNote: Take extra caution not to touch with the loaded pipette tip any other part of the maze or the maze plate. This could result in spreading the scent of the bait at unintended areas, and therefore distract the worms during Training. Mazes and maze plates that are thought to be compromised should not be used.\nNote: The amount (volume) of the bait may vary, depending on the compound concentration and the maze dimensions. It is suggested to run a few trials before deciding on the volume used. Further adjustments can be made, depending on the nematode strain used and the experimental design. As an example, for the aging experiments in Gourgou et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] (Gourgou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) the bait included OP50 mixed in 1:1 ratio with 3M L-lysine, a well-known attractant (Bargmann, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), to a final volume of 1.2 microliters, to enhance the mixture’s attractiveness to older C. elegans.\nNote: If you are baiting the mazes with a bacterial food source, make sure to vortex its container before loading the maze, as bacteria tend to precipitate. If the concentration of bacteria is imperative for the experiment, a spectrometer can be used to measure light absorption.\nNote: It is recommended to practice bait placement by using diluted food color. The process is performed efficiently when bait is placed only in the targeted area. Proceed with experiments only when food placement is mastered satisfactorily (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1017-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "Top row: Three examples of liquid bait placement, the least successful being the left one, and the most successful the right one. Bottom row: the same T-mazes, with highlighted bait borders. Scale bars: 1 mm.\nContinue with baiting the rest of the mazes.\nBait the mazes in triplets, usually by row or by column, to avoid diffusion to neighboring mazes. Return to bait the next triplet after completing the experiments with the previous triplet. Therefore, in a maze plate with nine individual mazes (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]), there will be three loading sessions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1017-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Loading the mazes\nIn a maze plate with nine mazes, it is advised to load and use them in triplets, either by row (yellow frame) or by column (green frame), to avoid bait diffusion to neighboring mazes. Scale bar: 5 mm.\nLeave the baited maze plate tilted for about 10 min, until the liquid bait is absorbed.\nBait can be placed on either of the maze arms. It is not advised to switch side arms for baited mazes in the same Training plate.\nNote: Bait that is not in liquid form, e.g., scrap of bacterial lawn, small chunk of NGM infused with some odorant, could also be used. The authors have not optimized the protocol for use with non-liquid bait, so preliminary studies would need to be tailored to the process accordingly.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S6. BaitMazes – step #1, bait the training mazes\nIntroduce C. elegans nematodes in the maze\nTiming: 5 min for each worm/maze\nEach maze is used only once, and only one worm is placed in each maze for each trial. Any C. elegans strain with adequate mobility can be tested.",
    "Using a platinum wire worm picker, no food attached, pick a worm crawling outside the bacterial lawn on the culture plate.\nNote: This is necessary to minimize transfer of food along with the nematode.\nPlace the worm on the floor of the starting area of the baited Training maze (bottom auxiliary area, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nOrient the plate so that the stem corridor of the T-maze is aligned with the picker to allow for easier placement of the worm. See also Methods video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8].\nTilt the plate slightly toward you to allow for better visual contact.\nLower the picker so that it gently touches the floor of the starting area.\nAllow the worm to climb off the picker.\nCritical: Refer to Methods video S7[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8] on how to position the plate during this step.\nNote: The worm should land on the floor of the starting area and not on the wall. A worm that lands on a side wall presents an increased probability of starting its maze trip with a side bias.\nNote: Once the worm lands, immediately bring the plate to the intended orientation and let it rest on the microscope stage.\nOptional: Initiate the recording (see recording C. elegans maze behavior[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3])\nCover the maze with an agar pad. See also Methods video S8[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc9].\nRemove the agar pad from the glass slide using a clean pair of tweezers.\nPlace the agar pad on top of the maze in a way that covers the maze and its surroundings.\nPress it down very gently to seal the maze.\nNote: This step must be executed swiftly.\nProceed with recording (see recording C. elegans maze behavior[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3])\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S7. InsertWorms – step #6, introduce C. elegans in the maze\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
    "Methods video S8. MazeCovers – step #7, introduce C. elegans in the maze\nRecording C. elegans maze behavior\nTiming: varying among individual nematodes, estimated range 5–30 min\nThe process is described for N2 Bristol wild type C. elegans, however the same steps can be followed when working with mutant strains. When working with a fluorescent strain, the same protocol can be performed under a fluorescent microscope (see also Gourgou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nSwitch on the imaging software.\nSet up the recording and camera settings depending on the imaging software of choice.\nMake sure that the entire maze can be imaged in the field of view.\nNote: In Gourgou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], we used CellSens, by Olympus.\nNote: It is suggested to turn the software on before you insert the worm in the maze, i.e., before step #6. Step #10 (below) is included in this subsection as part of the recording process.\nAs soon as the worm is placed in the maze and before you put the cover on, hit the recording button.\nThis is recommended in order to include in the recording as much of the maze trip as possible. However, if you plan to place the maze cover pad during the recording, this action will be also captured. Feel free to adjust the initiation of the recording according to your experimental needs.\nIf you are not using an agar pad to cover the maze, just start recording as soon as the worm is inserted.\nNote: If you plan to use the recordings in the future to track the worms using tracking software, refrain from changing the focus during the maze trip, because this will increase the “noise”, from the perspective of the tracking algorithm.",
    "Record each nematode until it reaches one of the maze arms (first decision) or until 30 min pass without reaching either end of the maze (see Gourgou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Supplementary Table S1). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nNote: The time limit of 30 min is selected based on the finding that most nematodes reach a maze arm in less than 30min (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] in Gourgou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nIn the Training maze, if the worm reaches the maze side with no bait, it is not processed any further (unless it is required by the experimental design). If the worm reaches the bait-containing maze arm, it is allowed to remain in the area for ∼3 min.\nAfter 3 min, or as soon as the worm departs from the bait-containing area, whichever happens first, the nematode is picked up using the picker.\nIf the assay is concluded, the worm is discarded.\nNote: The same process is followed for worms tested in empty mazes (e.g., control experiments), with the omission of food placement.\nIf a Testing trial is to follow, then immediately after removal from the Training maze, the worm is placed into a new, empty maze (Testing maze).\nNote: The Testing maze should be in a different maze plate, made from the same NGM batch.\nNote: Step #15 applies also in case a second Training is to follow.\nNote: Practice with diligence transferring worms from one maze to another before you run the actual experiment. This is often a time where worms get stressed or injured. Picking a nematode out of a maze should be done swiftly and decisively, as multiple picking attempts might result in stressing the worm, thus jeopardizing learned information retrieval. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]",
    "The second maze (Testing or second Training) is covered with an agar pad as described above (steps #7–9) and the worm is recorded until it reaches one of the maze arms (first decision recorded) or until 30 min pass without reaching either end of the maze (steps #11–16). (see Gourgou et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Supplementary Table S1).\nMake sure to label your recordings to indicate the Training-Testing recording pairs.\nNote: In case of multiple Training or Testing sessions, steps 6–18 can be repeated as many times as required. In case of increased time intervals between Training and Testing, the nematodes in study can be transferred to intermediate plates after Training and before Testing, as dictated by the experimental design."
