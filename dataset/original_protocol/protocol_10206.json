    "1. Setup Layout and Alignment\nInstallation and collimation of the tracking excitation laser\n\t\nAffix the laser to the optical table using a home-built mount. The mount is a simple aluminum plate with mounting holes for the laser head and the optical table. The laser should be firmly attached to a metal mount for stability and heat dissipation. For this work, use a 488 nm solid state laser for illumination (Figure 1), though the wavelength can be selected to suit a particular fluorophore or experiment. A critical factor is that the laser wavelength fit the 2D-EOD working range, which is determined primarily by the wave plate between the two deflectors (Figure 1: W2). The 488 nm laser can effectively excite the green or yellow fluorescent protein (GFP/YFP), which are common fluorescent tags in live cell experiments.\nAdjust the laser beam height and direction using a pair of dielectric mirrors (Figure 1: M). Make sure the laser beam is parallel to the optical table and adjust it to a suitable height.\n\t\tNOTE: The height should be chosen based on the microscope platform. This height should be maintained for all subsequent mirrors used in this protocol, though it will not be explicitly stated.\nCollimate the beam with a pair of lenses (Figure 1: L1 and L2). The focal lengths of lenses should be carefully chosen to avoid the laser spot being clipped by the aperture of the 2D-EOD. Clipping is evident by a change in the laser beam shape after passing through the 2D-EOD. The quality of collimation here is very important because aberrations will be amplified by subsequent lenses and any divergence will deteriorate the performance of the 2D-EOD deflection. Ideally, collimate the beam by focusing the beam to a point at least 20 m away.",
    "Place a pinhole (Figure 1: PH) of appropriate size at the focus of the first collimation lens (Figure 1: L1).\n\t\nChoose an appropriately sized pinhole. The pinhole size can be chosen based on the following calculation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56711/56711eq1.jpg\n\t\tWhere λ is the wavelength of laser, f is the focal length of the first lens, and D is the input beam diameter.\nMount the pinhole on a 3D translation stage so that it can be placed precisely at the focus of the first collimation lens.\nAdjust the position of the pinhole. Place a laser power meter after the pinhole and adjust the pinhole position in XYZ to maximize the power meter readout. If a diffraction ring is observed, block it with an iris placed before the 2D-EOD.\nInstallation of Glan-Thompson polarizer\n\t\nPut the Glan-Thompson polarizer (Figure 1: GP) after the second collimation lens (Figure 1: L2) to clean the polarization of the laser beam. Rotate the polarizer to find maximum transmission with the power meter.\nInstallation of EODs\n\t\nUse 2 EODs (Figure 1: EOD1 & EOD2) to deflect the laser in the X and Y directions. Maximize the laser transmission by adjusting the yaw, pitch, and height of each EOD.\nAlign the two EODs with respect to each other using the alignment marker provided by the manufacturer on the side of each deflector.",
    "Apply a test pattern to the controller of the 2D-EOD to inspect the output of the EOD. This can either be the knight's tour (Figure 2) via the FPGA described below or a simple sine wave provided by a function generator. For the best performance, the deflection by each deflector should be parallel to either the X or Y direction of the piezo nanopositioner. This direction is dictated by the angular direction of the deflectors about the transmission axis. To rotate the deflection direction without moving the 2D-EOD, place a dove prism after the 2D-EOD to align the deflection axes to the piezo nanopositioner axes.\nInstallation of half-wave plate\n\t\nPlace a half-wave plate (Figure 1: W1) between the Glan-Thompson polarizer (Figure 1: GP) and the 2D-EOD to align the incoming laser beam polarization with the deflection axes of the 2D-EOD. Place a long focal lens (300 mm) after the 2D-EOD and place a sCMOS camera at the laser focus. Next, turn on the 2D-EOD to generate the knight's tour described below (Figure 2). Rotate the half-wave plate until an evenly square laser distribution is observed on the camera.\nInstallation of a beam expending lens pair and relay lens pair\n\t\nPlace a pair of lenses (Figure 1: L3 and L4) after the 2D-EOD to expand the beam to fill the back aperture of the objective lens (Figure 1: OL) and another pair of lenses (Figure 1: L5 and L6) to relay the focal plane to the microscope objective. Be sure to leave enough room between these two pairs of lenses as the TAG lens will be installed between them in a later step.\nInstall the dichroic filter, 10/90 beam splitter, focusing lens, APD, objective lens, and fluorescence emission filter to complete the detection pathway.",
    "Install the dichroic filter (Figure 1: DC) to reflect the laser towards the objective lens. Align the laser to go straight through the center of the objective lens using two irises on the top and bottom of a long lens tube.\nInstall a 10/90 beam splitter (Figure 1: BS) by which 10% of light is reflected for imaging by an sCMOS camera (described below) and 90% of passes through to the APD for tracking.\nAlign the APD. Focus the laser onto a coverslip by the objective lens. Use the reflection from the coverslip to align all downstream elements by putting a coverslip at the objective focus and checking the intensity of the APD readout. After the beam splitter, install the APD focusing lens (Figure 1: L7) followed by the APD on a 3D translation stage. Position the lens such that the laser reflection from the objective goes through the center of the lens. The APD position can be optimized by adjusting the 3D position to maximize the intensity from the laser reflection on the coverslip. The APD position is at the optimal position when a move of the detector position in any direction decreases the intensity.\nInstall a longpass fluorescence emission filter (Figure 1: F) before the beam splitter to remove the reflected and scattered light.\nInstallation of the TAG lens\n\t\nPlace the TAG lens between the two pairs of lenses (between Figure 1: L4 and L5) as mentioned before and shown in Figure 1. Adjust the yaw, pitch, height, and lateral position such that the beam passes perpendicularly through the center of TAG lens.\n2. Sample Preparation.\nFixed particle preparation",
    "Dilute 190 nm fluorescent beads to ~ 5 × 108 beads/mL in PBS. Add 400 µL beads solution onto a coverslip and mount on the sample holder of the piezoelectric stage (the volume of beads will depend on the sample holder; the diameter of the sample holder chamber used here is 18 mm). For the beads used here, PBS causes the particles to deposit on the coverslip.\nFree moving particle preparation\n\t\nDilute 110 nm fluorescent beads to ~ 5 × 108 beads/mL with DI water. Add 400 µL beads solution onto a coverslip and mount onto the sample holder of the piezoelectric stage.\n3. Optimize Tracking Parameters\nRaster scan fixed particles\n\t\nPut a fixed particle sample on the microscope.\nTurn on the laser, micropositioner controller, piezo nanopositioner controller, TAG lens controller, and EOD controller. Note that the order is not critical. Run the piezo nanopositioner in closed loop.\nRaster scan the sample in XYZ using a custom scanning software program (Figure S3, software available upon request from the authors), which drives the 2D-EOD in a knight's tour (Figure 2), collects counts from the APD, drives the piezo nanopositioner, and performs position calculation (Figure S2). The step size is 40 nm and the scanning range is 2 µm.\n\t\t\nTo place the coverslip at the focus of the objective, remove the fluorescence emission filter and use the reflection of the laser from the coverslip to maximize the signal intensity as a function of the Z position of the micropositioner. After placing the sample at the focal plane, place back the fluorescence emission filter.",
    "Open the scanning program. Set the scanning range and step size by typing the number in the 'start', 'finish', and 'step'. First set a large scanning range and step size to locate a particle (e.g., 10 x 10 µm range with 200 nm step size). After finding the particle, shrink the scanning range and decrease step size (e.g., 2 x 2 µm range with 100 nm step size). Click the 'scan' button to perform a 3D raster scan to find the fluorescent focus.\nTAG lens settings (see also Figure 3)\n\t\nClick on the TAG lens control software. Click 'connect', 'power on' sequentially.\nTo change the output phase of the trigger signals, it is necessary to change the output trigger mode. First change the mode from 'RGB' to 'Multiplane' and then change it back. Now the phase can be changed (Figure 3b).\nSet the output phase to be 0 °, 90 °, and 270 °. While any three phases which cover the phase space can be used, these three are found to work well empirically (Figure 3c).\nSelect the 68,500 Hz frequency setting.\nTo find the optimal frequency it is often necessary to change the frequency search range. Click 'advanced', 'setting'. Change the 'Max. Freq(Hz)' of column 0 from 70,000 Hz to 71,500 Hz. This can be adjusted to whatever frequency range is appropriate. Click 'Save Calibration', 'Exit Calibration' (Figure 3d).\nTo make the new calibration effective, switch the resonance to another frequency (for example, 189,150 Hz) and then switched back to the 68,500 Hz frequency setting (Figure 3e).\nChange the amplitude gradually to 35%. Click 'Lock Resonance'. After the frequency is locked, click 'Unlock Resonance' (Figure 3e). The TAG lens is ready to use now.",
    "To calibrate, change the parameters that are used in the estimation to make the estimated position equal to the real position, as shown in Figure 4e, f. Input the scanning range of x, y, and z and then click the 'scan' button to scan the sample in XYZ to move the particle through the moving laser spot. The position of the particle as it is scanned through the laser focus should agree with the estimated particle position determined by the position estimation loop (Figure S1). The relationship between the estimated position and real position (Figure 4d) can be extracted from estimated position images (Figure 4f). If the positions do not agree, adjust the values of laser position (ck) used in the position estimation loop (Figure S1).\nAlign TAG lens\n\t\t\nWhen the TAG lens controller is off, the raster scanned particle images (described below) taken before installing TAG lens and after installing TAG lens should look identical. Next, perform fluorescent particle Z stack scanning by moving the objective with the z nanopositioner to tune the position and angle of TAG lens (Figure 4). Tune the position of the TAG lens until there is no drift in the particle images in XY plane along the Z direction, which is achieved when there is no change in the XY position of the particle as a function of the Z position (Figure 4d). The tracking system is ready to use after alignment of the TAG lens.\nInstallation of sCMOS camera for particle monitoring",
    "Install a sCMOS camera to visualize particles while they are being tracked. Install the sCMOS only after the all the components of the tracking system have been installed and optimized. Load a fixed fluorescent particle sample onto the microscope and run the tracking program to lock one particle in the objective focal volume. Then, install the 100 mm focal length lens (Figure 1: L8) and sCMOS. Adjust the sCMOS position so that the image of the particle is focused to the smallest and brightest spot.\n4. Real-time 3D Tracking of Freely Diffusing Nanoparticles\nPut the 110 nm free moving particle sample on the microscope.\nTurn on laser, micro-positioner controller, piezo nanopositioner controller, TAG lens controller, and EOD controller. Run the piezo nanopositioner in open loop. Set the TAG lens software according to step 3.2.\nOpen and run the tracking software (available upon request from the authors). Set the position estimation parameters to their optimized values, which were found in Section 3.\nTo place the coverslip at the focus of the objective, remove the fluorescence emission filter and use the reflection of the laser from the coverslip to maximize the signal intensity as a function of the Z position of the micropositioner. After finding the coverslip, increase the focus position 15 µm to focus the laser away from the coverslip and into the solution. Place back the fluorescence emission filter.\nSet the integral control constants. The integral control constants can be set starting at a low value and slowly increasing until oscillations can be seen in the particle's position readouts. Once oscillations are observed, set the integral control constants to 80% of the value causing the oscillations. Typical values will be around 0.012 for the XY 'integral gain' and 0.004 for the Z 'integral gain'.",
    "Set the tracking thresholds in 'Track Threshold' and 'Track Minimum' and start the tracking experiment by clicking 'Search' and 'Auto Track'. The threshold for terminating tracking is set slightly higher than the background level and the threshold for triggering tracking is about two times higher than the background. Here, the threshold for triggering tracking is 3 kHz and the threshold for ending the trajectory is 1.5 kHz.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
