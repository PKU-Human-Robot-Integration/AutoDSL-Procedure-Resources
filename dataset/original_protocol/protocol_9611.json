    "1. Engineering a fluorescence-based reporter cell line to monitor the transcriptional activity of the target gene by flow cytometry\nIdentify cell lines expressing the target gene to be silenced. Browse the target gene to be silenced in the Human Protein Atlas38 and navigate through its \"Cell line\" section to identify those lines representative of the somatic tissue of interest (e.g., a hepatic cell line if the final targets are liver hepatocytes). Alternatively, interrogate a publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) database (e.g., NCBI GEO).\nAmong the candidates, prioritize cell lines for which efficient transient gene delivery protocols-instrumental for ETR delivery-are available.\n\tNOTE: Among the different modalities, nucleofection represents one of the best options, as it ensures high transfection efficiencies. Here, human erythroleukemia K-562 cells have been chosen to generate a cell line reporting the transcriptional activity of the beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene (hereafter referred as to the B2MTdTomato K-562 cells).\nFurther prioritize the candidates to avoid cell lines in which the target gene is essential for cell viability, as this impairs the maintenance of cells with stable silencing of the target gene in culture. If not previously reported, to have a sense of the essentiality of the target gene in the cell type of choice, generate a genetic disruption control by transfecting the cells with Cas9 nuclease and a gRNA targeting one of the first coding exons of the gene.\n\tNOTE: Genetic disruption is a stable event by definition; counterselection of disrupted cells over time indicates that the target gene is essential for the physiology of the selected cell.\n\t\nIdentify the target splicing isoform preferentially used in the selected cell line (the isoform NM_004048.4 of the B2M gene is targeted in this protocol).",
    "Identify a gRNA that can cut effectively and specifically in the first coding exon of the target isoform (e.g., Chopchop (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/)39, which is a valid and user-friendly online gRNA selection tool).\nFor K-562 cells, transfect 1 µg of spCas9-encoding plasmid (hCas9; see Table of Materials) and 250 ng of gRNA-encoding plasmid (phU6-gRNA; see Table of Materials) per 5 × 105 cells through nucleofection (according to the manufacturer's instructions).\nCulture the cells (K-562 cells at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin [100 U/mL]) and monitor the levels of gene disruption over time by exploiting a mutation detection kit (follow the manufacturer's instructions).\nClone a donor template for homologous recombination-mediated integration of a fluorescent reporter under the transcriptional control of the target gene of interest (Figure 1).\n\t\nIdentify the region of the target gene to integrate the fluorophore expression cassette.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid targeting transcriptionally relevant elements, such as CpG islands and regions enriched for H3K27 acetylation (marker of active promoters and enhancers). Altering these regulatory elements (potentially important to be targeted by the ETRs to instruct epigenetic silencing) makes the reporter cell line less predictive of the physiological regulation of the target gene.\n\t\t\nIf the target gene does not encode for a secreted protein, fuse the reporter to the last codon of the target gene through a 2A self-cleaving peptide to maintain the functionality of the target gene.\nIf the target gene does encode for a secreted protein, to avoid potential secretion of the reporter, place the reporter in an intronic region of the target gene. Force integration of the reporter in the spliced transcript through a splice acceptor site (SA) and subsequent translation through an internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) impairs the functionality of the target gene.",
    "Use Chopchop to select gRNA cutting in the target region (here, a gRNA is selected to target the sequence 5′-AGGCTACTAGCCCCATCAAGAGG-3′ of the first intron of the B2M gene).\nDesign a donor template for the gRNA cut site consisting of: i) a left homology arm (n base pairs [bp] matching the region just upstream of the gRNA cut site); ii) a promoter-free transgene expression cassette (in the case here shown, an SA-3X Stop Codon-IRES-tdTomato-BGH poly(A) favoring splicing with the first intron of the B2M gene); and iii) a right homology arm (n bp matching the region downstream of the gRNA cut site).\n\t\tNOTE: The length of the homology arms necessary to effectively induce homologous recombination can vary between different cell types (100-500 bp is a proper range for K-562 cells).\nDeliver the CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system and the donor template inside the target cell line. For K-562 cells, transfect 1 µg of spCas9-encoding plasmid (hCas9; see Table of Materials), 250 ng of gRNA-encoding plasmid (phU6-gRNA; see Table of Materials), and 1 µg of donor template-encoding plasmid per 5 × 105 cells through nucleofection (according to the manufacturer's instructions).\nCulture the cells for at least 14 days (for K-562 cells) and monitor the expression levels of the fluorescent reporter over time by using a flow cytometer (activate the phycoerythrin (PE) channel to measure the fluorescence intensity of the tdTomato reporter and follow the manufacturer's instructions to perform flow cytometry).\n\tNOTE: The donor template-especially if plasmid-based-can contain cryptic promoter sequences, leading to the expression of the fluorescent reporter from non-integrated donor copies. Culturing the cells allows for dilution of these non-integrated copies by cell division and finally maintaining the expression of the reporter only from the donor copies integrated in the target genome.",
    "Clone reporter-positive cells through fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) at a single-cell level. For this protocol, activate the PE channel to measure the fluorescence intensity of the tdTomato reporter and follow the manufacturer's instructions to sort single tdTomato-positive K-562 cells per well of a 96-well plate.\nUpon cell expansion in culture (typically 20-30 days for K-562 cells), screen reporter-positive clones by PCR to select one bearing a bi-allelic integration of the reporter cassette inside the target locus.\n\tNOTE: This maximizes reporter expression and facilitates further resolution between reporter-expressing and reporter-silenced cells by flow cytometry upon ETR treatment.\n\t\nExtract genomic DNA from 1 × 105 cells per reporter-positive clone using a DNA extraction kit (following the manufacturer's instructions).\nAmplify the B2M target region with forward (5'-GTATTTGCTGGTTATGTTAG-3') and reverse (5'-AATGGTTGAGTTGGAC-3') primers following the instructions of the PCR amplification kit. The annealing temperature for this pair of primers is 47.7 °C with Taq-based DNA polymerases and 0.5 µM primer concentrations.\nAnalyze the PCR product using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (following the manufacturer's instructions). Screen for clones showing the band related to integration of the tdTomato in the B2M target locus (3,413 bp), without the band related to the wild-type target locus (1,027 bp).\n2. Designing gRNAs for CRISPR/dCas 9-based epigenetic silencing of the target gene\nBrowse the target gene in the UCSC genome browser40 and extract the nucleotide sequence of regions potentially regulating its transcriptional activity, such as CpG islands and sites enriched for H3K27 acetylation (marker of active promoters and enhancers).\n\tNOTE: According to a recent study, the best targeting region is a 1 kilobase (kb) window centered on the transcription start site of the target gene32.",
    "Paste the selected sequences in the Chopchop online tool and select repression as the purpose of the gRNAs to be retrieved. Wait for Chopchop to provide a list of gRNAs mapped on the genetic sequence of interest and listed according to a score considering both the number of off-target matches and the predicted on-target efficiency (Figure 2).\nSelect at least 10 gRNAs per target sequence. If possible, try to select gRNAs spanning throughout the whole region to be interrogated, with no full matches with other intragenic sequences throughout the genome.\n3. Arrayed transient delivery of CRISPR/dCas 9-based ETRs in the reporter cell line\nAmong the transgene delivery systems previously reported for the target cell line, choose those allowing only transient transgene expression, maximizing delivery efficiency, and minimizing cell manipulation-related toxicity. In the case of K-562 cells, both plasmid and mRNA nucleofection are highly recommended, with plasmid production representing a technically easier and cheaper alternative.\nClone both the gRNAs selected in section 2 and CRISPR/dCas9-based ETRs in the transgene delivery system of choice. See the following steps for a protocol for cloning the ETRs in plasmid DNAs.\n\tNOTE: Plasmids separately encoding for dCas9:KRAB, dCas9:DNMT3A, and dCas9:DNMT3L30 are not available on Addgene. They were cloned by replacing the VP160 trans-activator from the plasmid pAC154-dual-dCas9VP160-sgExpression41 (see Table of Materials) with either the KRAB, DNMT3A, or DNMT3L domain-coding sequence30. A plasmid encoding for an all-in-one ETR, termed CRISPRoff-v2.132, is available (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nTransform plasmids encoding for the ETRs in chemically competent E. coli cells (following the manufacturer's instructions). Screen the colonies for the presence of the ETR-bearing plasmid by restriction enzyme digestion and Sanger sequencing, and finally choose one of the positive colonies for plasmid DNA Midiprep production (following the manufacturer's instructions).\nClone the gRNAs inside the phU6-gRNA backbone (Figure 3).",
    "Using molecular biology design software, append a 5'-CACCG-3' sequence upstream of the protospacer (the first variable 20 nucleotides [nt] of the selected gRNA) to generate a 25 nt-long oligo in silico, referred to as SGfw.\nSimilarly, append a 5'-AAAC-3' sequence upstream of the reverse complement of the protospacer of the selected gRNA and a 5'-C-3' downstream of it to generate a 25 nt-long oligo referred as SGrv.\nOrder both the SGfw and SGrv sequences as salt-free single-stranded DNA oligos, resuspended in water at 100 µM.\nAdd 1 µL of each oligo to 2 µL of annealing buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5-8.0], 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and 16 µL of water.\nPerform oligo annealing by placing the solution in a thermocycler programmed to start at 95 °C for 10 min. Then, gradually cool to 25 °C over 45 min.\nDilute 1 µL of the annealed oligos with 99 µL of nuclease-free water, and then ligate 1 µL of this dilution with 50 ng of phU6-gRNA plasmid previously digested with the BsaI restriction enzyme (follow the instructions of BsaI and ligase kit vendors for the digestion and ligation procedure).\nTransform 20 µL of chemically competent E. coli cells with 2 µL of the ligation product (follow the manufacturer's instructions for the transformation procedure).\nPick multiple colonies for plasmid DNA Miniprep production (follow the instructions of the vendor) and control the successful cloning of the protospacer by Sanger sequencing with the following primer matching to the U6 promoter 5'-GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATT-3'.\nChoose one of the positive colonies for plasmid DNA Midiprep production (following the manufacturer's instructions).\nDeliver the selected gRNAs and CRISPR/dCas9-based ETRs in the reporter cell line in array (one specific gRNA per condition) (Figure 3).",
    "NOTE: As a representative case, the workflow for the nucleofection of plasmids encoding for dCas9:KRAB, dCas9:DNMT3A, dCas9:DNMT3L, and gRNAs targeting the B2M CpG island in B2MTdTomato K-562 cells is shown in the following steps.\n\t\nPrepare separate tubes containing 500 ng of each of the dCas9:KRAB-, dCas9:DNMT3A-, and dCas9:DNMT3L-encoding plasmids, but differing for the gRNA to be tested (125 ng of a gRNA-encoding plasmid per tube). Include a gRNA- and ETR-free nucleofection condition as mock-treated sample. Perform the screen with at least three technical replicates per sample.\nPellet 5 × 105 B2MTdTomato K-562 cells per tube and nucleofect them with the plasmid mix (following the manufacturer's instructions).\nResuspend the cells in 200 µL of previously warmed RPMI-1640 mammalian cell culture media and place them back in the incubator.\n4. Analyzing the transcriptional activity of the target gene over time\nUse flow cytometry to measure the percentage of silenced cells at different time points after delivery of the ETRs (Figure 4). Use wild-type (WT) cells-not bearing the fluorophore-coding sequence-to set the threshold of reporter-negative cells. Use the mock-treated sample to set the gate for reporter-positive cells.\n\tNOTE: As suggested in step 1.3, include a genetic disruption control in the experiment. This can be useful to both monitor the CRISPR delivery efficiency and the fitness of cells deprived of the target gene; the loss of both transcriptional silencing and genetic disruption over time can be ascribed to the essentiality of the target gene in the cell type of choice. Include both short- (day 3, day 7, day 10) and long-term (day 21, day 35) time points to get an indication of both acute and long-term efficiency of silencing.",
    "Identify the top three gRNAs in terms of long-term silencing efficiency. Use FACS to select the reporter-negative subpopulation stably maintained in those samples. Also, perform FACS of the bulk mock-treated samples to keep them under the same treatment as the test samples to allow proper comparison in the subsequent analyses.\n5. Evaluating the specificity of the ETR treatment by RNA-seq and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-seq\nUse RNA-seq to evaluate any eventual genome-wide transcriptional deregulation upon ETR delivery.\n\t\nFor both the reporter-silenced subpopulation of the samples treated with the three top-performing gRNAs and mock-treated cells, extract RNA using commercially available kits. Assess the quality and concentration of the RNA by using commercially available kits.\nPerform RNA fragmentation, retrotranscription, and library preparation using commercially available kits for the preparation of RNA-seq libraries (following the manufacturer's instructions).\nPerform library quantification and quality control using quality control instruments compatible with next-generation sequencing and digital electrophoresis.\nSequence libraries on a next generation sequencer following the manufacturer's instruction, with a 100 bp paired-end protocol and aiming at an average of 45 M reads/sample.\nAlign read tags to the appropriate reference genome and quantify transcript expression. Perform alignment on the tdTomato sequence and quantify it separately.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, STAR aligner (v 2.3.0)43, with default parameters, coupled to Rsubread package44 is used.\nPerform analysis of the RNA-seq data according to published best practices45.\n\t\tNOTE: The R/Bioconductor package edgeR46 is used here, applying a filter of at least one count per million (cpm) in at least three samples to discard low-expressed genes. Alternatively, the filterByExpr function in edgeR can be used.\nEvaluate differential gene expression using a negative binomial generalized log-linear model implemented edgeR (function glmFit)47. Set a threshold of 0.01 on adjusted p values (Benjamini-Hochberg [BH] correction) to retain differentially regulated genes.",
    "Evaluate any eventual off-target CpG methylation activity of the ETRs by MeDIP-seq.\n\t\nFor both the reporter-silenced subpopulation of the samples treated with the top three gRNAs and mock-treated cells, extract genomic DNA using commercially available kits (following the manufacturers' instructions).\nSonicate 500 ng of genomic DNA using an ultrasonicator and the following parameters: Duty: 20 %; PIP: 175; Cycles per Burst: 200; Time: 40 s.\nPrepare sequencing libraries with the commercially available kits for MeDIP-seq (following the manufacturers' instructions).\nAfter the adaptor ligation step, quantify libraries by fluorometric assay and check the ligation efficiency by qPCR using commercially available library quantification kits (following the manufacturers' instructions).\nObtain library pools by mixing randomly-selected libraries to reduce technical biases. Use an equal library amount (ng) for each library to balance the pools. To each pool, add the methylated and unmethylated spike-in control DNA provided in the kit. For control purposes, keep a 10% volume of the library, labeled as \"input\" and not immunoprecipitated. Perform immunoprecipitation on the remaining 90% of the library using the monoclonal antibody directed against 5-methylcytosine provided in the MeDIP-seq kit.\nPurify enriched and input libraries using the kits for purification of the 5-methylcytosine immunoprecipitation product, following the manufacturers' instructions.\nEvaluate the enrichment efficiency by performing quantitative real-time PCR on the internal spike in controls using primers provided with the kit. For each immunoprecipitation (IP), compute enrichment specificity from the recovery of methylated and unmethylated DNA, using the cycle threshold (Ct) values of MeDIP and input fractions obtained from the qPCR reaction (see equations 1and 2):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64403/64403eq01.jpg (1)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64403/64403eq02.jpg (2)\n\t\tNOTE: Consider IP libraries to be successful if the specificity values are ≥0.95.\nAmplify the libraries using MeDIP-seq library preparation kits, following the manufacturers' instructions, and perform quantification and library size distribution analysis of the product.",
    "Perform library sequencing on next generation sequencers. Use paired-end sequencing, with a read length of 100 bp, aiming at an average of 30 M reads/sample.\nAlign the sequencing read tags to the appropriate reference genome (e.g., hg38) using bwa (v 0.7.5 or higher)48 and then identify peaks using MACS (v 2.0.10 or higher)49, allowing for the identification of broad peaks (-slocal = 0,-llocal = 500000).\nCreate a common set of regions from different samples using BEDTools' multiintersection tool50, enabling the clustering option.\nCalculate the per-sample coverage over the final region list using BEDTools' multicov, discarding duplicated reads.\nPerform analysis of the matrix count using edgeR. Apply a filter of at least one count per million (cpm) in at least three samples to discard low-enriched regions.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, the filterByExpr function in edgeR could be used.\nIdentify differential methylation by adopting the generalized log-linear model implemented in edgeR (function glmFit) and normalizing using conditional quantile normalization51 to correct for region-wise GC-content. Select differentially methylated regions by applying a threshold of 0.01 on BH adjusted p values. Perform the analysis of repeated sequences as follows.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to the edgeR user guide for the full list of options and parameters (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html).\n\t\t\nFilter MeDIP-seq results for a nominal p value <0.01 and create two sets of regions: select regions having logFC >1 in the first set and regions having logFC <-1 in the second set.\nRetrieve the RepeatMasker annotation for the chosen genome as a bed file and count the number of elements in each set. Convert the count as a ratio over the number of regions for each dataset.\nExtract the ratio of methylome that overlaps each class of repeats and perform a Chi-squared test to detect any significant enrichment.",
    "Evaluate if differentially transcribed or differentially methylated regions between ETR- and mock-treated samples map to in silico-predicted off-target gRNA binding.\n\t\nUse CRISPR design suite52 as the off-target gRNA binding prediction tool.\nFor every putative off-target region, look at the closest transcription start site (TSS) and the closest methylated region. Consider as a true off-target effect a region associated either to a gene regulated with FDR <0.01 and a distance to TSS smaller than 10 Kb, or a methylated region regulated with FDR <0.01 and a distance lower than 1 Kb.\nIdentify the number and features of the regions transcriptionally altered or overmethylated in samples treated with each of the three top-performing gRNAs compared to mock-treated samples (Figure 5) to identify the most specific among the gRNAs. Rank the potential impact of an off-target site on the physiology of the target cells in the following order (from the most impacting to the less impacting):\n\t\ti) Intragenic, regulatory region-physiologically expressed gene\n\t\tii) Intragenic, exonic region-physiologically expressed gene\n\t\tiii) Intragenic, intronic region-physiologically expressed gene\n\t\tiv) Intragenic, regulatory region-not expressed gene\n\t\tv) Intragenic, exonic region-not expressed gene\n\t\tvi) Intragenic, intronic region-not expressed gene\n\t\tvii) Intergenic region"
