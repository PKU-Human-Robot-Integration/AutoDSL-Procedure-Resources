    "Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Provision and General Recommendation of Chinese Experimental Animal Administration Legislation and were approved by the Institution of Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical University (Ref no. AEEI-2014-052). Female Balb/c mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were used.\n1. Preparation of the Cells and Animals\nOne day before the operation, shave the hair around the fourth nipples to expose the operating area.\n\t\nUse one hand to hold the mouse tightly at the back to make sure the mouse will not move freely, turn up the mouse to expose its belly to the operator, and then use another hand to shave the fur around the fourth nipples with an electronic shaver.\nPut a thin layer of hair removal cream around the nipples for 30 - 60 s, clean away the cream with distilled water, and then dry the mouse with soft paper.\nOn the day of the operation, collect murine breast cancer cells (4T1-luc2), count the cell number, and adjust the cell density to 2 x 105 cells/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in sterile microcentrifuge tubes and keep them on ice. For each mouse, 1 x 104 cells/50 µL in a 1-mL syringe is prepared.\n2. Orthotopic Injection\nAnesthesia of mice \nInduce anesthesia. Put the mice in a closed transparent container and turn on 2% isoflurane gas to anesthetize the mice for about 5 min, till they all lie down and fall asleep.\nMaintain anesthesia. Transfer the mice from the container to individual anesthesia masks, put some vet ointment on their eyes to avoid dryness, keep the mice supinely with their nipples exposed to the operator, and let them continue to inhale isoflurane gas for a few minutes until the injection has been performed.",
    "Confirm the success of anesthesia by the lack of a toe pinch withdrawal reflex.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mice to prevent eye dryness.\n\t\tNote: According to the container size and the number of individual anesthesia masks available, a group of mice can be anesthetized together and injected one by one under individual anesthesia.\nPerformance of the injection\nUse one hand to tent up the skin around the fourth nipple with tweezers, to set up an uplifted “tunnel” for the syringe to follow. Use the other hand to hold the syringe with the needle turned upwards to enter the skin subcutaneously at 5 - 10 mm from nipple; then, follow the “tunnel” until the needle tip comes close to the nipple, carefully move the needle tip up into the mammary fat pad till the needle eye comes under the nipple tip, discard the tweezers, and inject the cells slowly.\nTurn around the needle a little and retract the syringe slowly; use a cotton swab to press the needle wound for 10 - 20 s to make sure there is no fluid seepage.\nObserve the fourth nipple to confirm a successful injection: one white transparent flat sphere with the nipple as the center can be observed (Figure 1).\nKeep the mice anesthetized for another minute to avoid letting the mice recover and move too quickly, which will cause the injection wound to open and the tumor cells to leak out.\n3. Analysis of the Tumor Growth and Metastasis\nNote: Primary tumors are identified as transparent or blister-like bumps after injections, and as spherical or ellipsoid solid lumps with the nipple a few days later. Tumor growth is evaluated by tumor volume and tumor bioluminescence.",
    "To establish the tumor volume, hold the mouse with one hand. Expose its belly to the operator and use the other hand to caliper the tumor length (L) and width (W). Calculate the tumor volume (V) as follows.\n\tV = (L x W2)/2\nTo capture the tumor bioluminescence, inject 150 mg/kg D-luciferin at the back of the mouse’s neck, 10 min before imaging. Anesthetize the mice with 2% isoflurane gas for 5 min and transfer them to individual anesthesia masks to let them inhale isoflurane gas for 5 min longer. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, capture bioluminescence images of the primary tumor and metastasis, with auto exposure time, medium binning, and f/stop at 1.\n4. Harvesting of the Primary Tumor and Metastasis Organs for Analysis\nNote: When achieving the purpose of this experiment, or reaching the humane endpoint, the primary tumor can be harvested for further study. In this study, tumors are removed at 4 to 5 weeks after the injection, when the tumor volume reaches about 800 mm3. The lungs are removed at week 8.\nHarvesting of the primary tumor\nPerform the surgery in a sterile hood to maintain a sterile atmosphere. Anesthetize the animals by isoflurane. Confirm the success of anesthesia by the lack of toe pinch withdrawal reflexes. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mice to prevent them from drying out.\nDissociate the tumor from the skin with scissors, dropwise painkiller (1 mg/mL tramadol, 1 drop of about 50 µL per mouse) to relieve postoperative pain.\nStitch the skin with a surgical suture, cut off excess suture, drape off the incision.",
    "Cut the primary tumor in half with a scalpel, put 1/2 of the tumor into 4% paraformaldehyde for further hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry, and immediately freeze the other 1/2 with liquid nitrogen for western blotting or an RNA isolation study later.\nAfter suturing, warm the mice with a lamp till they recover, keep the mice in single cages until fully recovered. Continuously administer 10 mg/kg tramadol with an oral gavage for 3 d after the surgery.\nHarvesting of metastasis organs\nEuthanize the mice with an overdose of pentobarbital, open their chests with scissors, gently take out the lungs, and wash them with PBS. Lung metastasis foci can be identified as white transparent bumps which are morphologically different and distinguishable from normal pink lung tissue.\nPut the lungs into 4% paraformaldehyde to verify the metastasis by H&E staining.\nSubscription Required.
