    "Samples were collected following the Njala University Institutional Review Board (NUIRB) protocol no. IRB00008861/FWA00018924.\n1. RNA Extraction from Blood Samples\nCollect 3 mL of whole blood from the species to be analyzed into a blood collection tube prefilled with 6 mL of DNA/RNA stabilizing reagent (see Table of Materials) and mix by inverting 5 times. Store the blood sample for up to one month at 4 °C.\nTransfer the contents of the blood collection tube into a 50 mL collection tube, add 120 µL of proteinase K, and mix by vortexing for 5 s. Incubate the sample for 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd 9 mL of isopropanol to the mixture and vortex for 5 s.\nPlace a reservoir onto an RNA purification spin column (see Table of Materials) and place the assembly onto a vacuum manifold (see Table of Materials). Add the sample mixture into the reservoir. Apply a vacuum until all liquid has passed through the column.\nAlternatively, if no vacuum manifold is available, the blood can be passed through the column in 700 µL portions by repeated centrifugation for 30 s at 12,000 x g with the flow-through discarded between centrifugation steps. However, this will require approximately 26 centrifugation steps.\nPlace the RNA purification spin column into a collection tube and add 400 µL DNA/RNA prep buffer (see Table of Materials). Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 30 s and discard the flow-through.\nAdd 400 µL of DNA/RNA wash buffer (see Table of Materials) to the column, centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 30 s and discard the flow-through.\nMix 5 µL of DNase I (1 U/µL) (see Table of Materials) with 75 µL of DNA digestion buffer (see Table of Materials) and add the mixture onto the column. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "Add 400 µL of DNA/RNA prep buffer to the column and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.\nWash the column with 700 µL of DNA/RNA wash buffer and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.\nRepeat step 1.9 with 400 µL of DNA/RNA wash buffer and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 2 min to remove all residual wash buffer and to dry the column. When removing the column from the collection tube, make sure not to wet the underside of the column with the buffer in the collection tube.\nPlace the column into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and add 70 µL of nuclease-free water. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature and centrifuge for 30 s at 12,000 x g. Store the RNA at -80 °C until further use (or use immediately).\nOPTIONAL: To quantify the RNA, take an aliquot and determine the concentration using a UV spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials).\n2. Reverse Transcription of NPC1 mRNA into cDNA\nIn a 0.2 mL reaction tube, add 8 µL of template RNA (1 pg to 2.5 µg of RNA) and 1 µL each of 10x DNase buffer and DNase enzyme (see Table of Materials). Incubate at 37 °C for 2 min. Subsequently, centrifuge the reaction briefly and place it on ice.\nAdd 4 µL of reverse transcriptase master mix (see Table of Materials) and 6 µL of nuclease-free water to the reaction tube and mix gently. Incubate the reaction in a thermocycler for 10 min at 25 °C (for primer annealing), followed by 10 min at 50 °C (for reverse transcription of RNA). To inactivate the enzyme, incubate for 5 min at 85 °C.",
    "Transfer cDNA to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and store at -80 °C until further use (or use immediately).\n3. Amplification of the NPC1 Open Reading Frame\nInitial amplification step\nSet up a touchdown PCR15,16 to amplify the NPC1 cDNA with Primer Set 1 (see Table 1), using a hot start high fidelity DNA polymerase (see Table of Materials) with the appropriate reaction buffer in a 50 µL reaction volume with 1 µL template. If possible, set up the reaction on ice or in a 4 °C cool block.\nIncubate the reaction in a thermocycler with an initial denaturation step of 30 s at 98 °C, followed by 10 cycles with denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, primer annealing for 20 s at 65 °C, lowering the temperature by 0.5 °C per cycle, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. Subsequently, run an additional 20 cycles with 10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final elongation step of 5 min at 72 °C.\nPCR purification using magnetic beads\nTransfer 50 µL of PCR product into a 1.5 mL DNA-low binding reaction tube (see Table of Materials). Resuspend magnetic beads (see Table of Materials) thoroughly by vortexing and add 50 µL beads to the PCR reaction. Mix well. Incubate the sample on a rotating mixer (see Table of Materials) for 5 min at room temperature (at 15 rpm).\nBriefly spin down the sample and place the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on a magnetic rack (see Table of Materials) to pellet the magnetic beads. Wait until the supernatant has been completely clarified before continuing with the next step.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the bead pellet and discard.",
    "Pipette 200 µL of 70% ethanol into the reaction tube and incubate for 30 s. Aspirate the ethanol without disturbing the pellet and discard. Repeat for a total of two washes. Make sure that no ethanol is left. It may be necessary to first aspirate with a larger pipette (e.g., 1000 µL), and then to remove any remaining ethanol droplets with a smaller pipette (e.g., 10 µL).\nAir-dry the pellet for 1 min at room temperature.\nRemove the reaction tube from the magnetic rack, resuspend the pellet in 30 µL of nuclease-free water and incubate for 2 min at room temperature.\nPlace the reaction tube back on the magnetic rack and wait until the beads are completely pelleted.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and transfer it to a new 1.5 mL reaction tube.\nAddition of barcode adapters by nested PCR\nSet up a 50 µL touchdown PCR with hot start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase with 5x reaction buffer and Primer Set 2 (see Table 1). Primers in this set consist of a target sequence-specific region to allow binding of PCR products generated in step 3.2 (inside of the primer set 1 sequences), as well as an adapter sequence that is used as target in the subsequent barcoding PCR reaction (cf. section 4). If possible, set up the reaction on ice or in a 4 °C cool block. Use 1 µL of the purified PCR product prepared in section 3.2 as template.",
    "Incubate the reaction mix in a thermocycler using an initial denaturation step of 30 s at 98 °C, followed by 10 cycles with denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, primer annealing for 20 s at 65 °C, lowering the temperature by 0.5 °C per cycle, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. Subsequently, incubate the reaction for a further 30 cycles for 10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 71 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final elongation step of 5 min at 72 °C.\nClean up the PCR product using magnetic beads as described in section 3.2.\n4. Barcoding of NPC1 Amplicons\nFor each PCR product generated in section 3, set up a barcoding PCR reaction in a 0.2 mL reaction tube using 50 µL of Taq DNA polymerase 2x master mix (see Table of Materials), 2 µL of one of the barcode primers from a PCR barcoding kit (see Table of Materials and Table 2), and 1 µL of purified PCR product from step 3.3.2 as template. Add 47 µL of nuclease free water to obtain a final volume of 100 µL.\nIncubate the reaction in a thermocycler at 95 °C for 3 min as an initial denaturation. Subsequently, run 15 cycles for 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 62 °C, and 1.5 min at 65 °C. As a final elongation, incubate the reaction at 65 °C for 5 min.\nPurify the PCR product as described under 3.2, but use 100 µL of magnetic beads and elute in 30 µL of nuclease-free water.\nIf possible, quantify the sample using a UV spectrophotometer.\n5. Library Preparation",
    "Combine an equal amount of barcoded DNA from each sample for a total of 1 µg of DNA in a volume of 45 µL (if necessary, add nuclease-free water) in a 0.2 mL reaction tube. If no UV spectrophotometer is available, use equal volumes of each sample. For dA-tailing, add 7 µL of End-prep reaction buffer (see Table of Materials), 3 µL of End-prep enzyme mix (see Table of Materials), and 5 µL of nuclease-free water. Mix gently by flicking the tube.\nIncubate the reaction for 5 min at 20 °C, followed by 5 min at 65 °C in a thermocycler.\nPurify the reaction product as described in section 3.2, but use 60 µL of magnetic beads and elute in 25 µL of nuclease-free water.\nOPTIONAL: Take 1 µL to quantify the concentration of the sample using a UV spectrophotometer. The total amount should be more than 700 ng.\nCombine 22.5 µL of purified DNA from step 5.3 with 2.5 µL of 1D2 adapter (see Table of Materials) and 25 µL of blunt/TA ligase master mix (see Table of Materials) in a new 1.5 mL DNA-low binding reaction tube, mix gently by flicking, and briefly spin down. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nPurify the reaction product as described in section 3.2, but use 20 µL of magnetic beads, increase the incubation time for DNA binding to 10 min, perform two wash steps with 1 mL of ethanol each, and elute in 46 µL of nuclease-free water.\nCombine 45 µL of the reaction product from step 5.6 with 5 µL of barcode adapter mix (see Table of Materials) and 50 µL of blunt/TA ligase master mix in a DNA-low binding reaction tube.

    "Purify the reaction product as described in section 3.2, but use 40 µL of magnetic beads, do two wash steps with 140 µL of ABB buffer (see Table of Materials) instead of ethanol, resuspend the beads by flicking and pellet on a magnetic rack. Elute in 15 µL of elution buffer (see Table of Materials). Increase the incubation times for the initial binding of DNA to the beads as well as for the elution step to 10 min. Store the resulting product on ice or at 4 °C until use.\n6. Quality Check of Flow Cell\nPerform a quality check on the flow cell before use. To this end, connect the sequencing device to the host computer and open the software.\nInsert a flow cell (see Table of Materials) into the sequencing device and choose the flow cell type from the selector box and confirm by clicking Available.\nClick Check flow cell in the bottom of the screen and choose the correct flow cell type.\nClick Start test to start the quality check. A minimum of 800 active nanopores in total is required for the flow cell to be usable.\n7. Loading the Flow Cell and Starting the Sequencing Run\nOpen the priming port cover by sliding it in a clockwise direction. Set a P1000 pipette to 200 µL and insert the tip into the priming port. Adjust the pipette to 230 µL while keeping the tip in the priming port, to draw up 20-30 µL buffer and remove any air bubbles.\nIn a new 1.5 mL DNA-low binding reaction tube prepare the priming mix by combining 576 µL of RBF buffer (see Table of Materials) with 624 µL of nuclease-free water.",
