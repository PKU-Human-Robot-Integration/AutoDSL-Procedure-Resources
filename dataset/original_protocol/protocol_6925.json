    "Sample collection and preparationMouse tissue All animal experiments must be performed according to an approved institutional animal protocol.Note: Paraformaldehyde (PFA) and its fumes are toxic. Always consult the safety data sheet before handling and use the recommended personal protective equipment (including gloves, lab coat, and face protection). Handle PFA inside a fume hood, and collect all waste for proper disposal in accordance with the institutional requirements. During perfusion, high-absorbency disposable pads can be placed inside the hood to collect blood and PFA. Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (3-5% for induction and 1-2% for maintenance). Proceed when the mouse is fully anesthetized, as indicated by the absence of a response to toe pinching.Perform a transcardial perfusion (Wu et al., 2021) with ~20 ml cold heparinized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10-20 units/ml), using a peristaltic pump (flow rate ~6 ml/min), until the blood is removed from the tissue and the fluid exiting the right atrium is clear.Continue perfusing with ~20 ml ice-cold 4% PFA until the body is stiff.Note: A good perfusion is critical to the quality of the experiment. To ensure a good perfusion, it is essential to remove as much blood as possible. The addition of heparin to the PBS is important to prevent blood clot formation. When perfusing with heparinized PBS, observe the color of the liver and continue perfusing with heparinized PBS for 2-3 additional minutes after the liver becomes pale before switching to PFA to ensure that blood has been removed from the pancreas. Dissect the pancreas immediately, taking care not to damage the stomach and intestines (Figure 2). Place the dissected pancreas into a Petri dish containing cold PBS and remove adipose and mesenteric tissue under a dissection microscope.",
    "Note: Mesenteric adipose tissue looks pale and glistening under a dissection microscope and can easily be pulled away from the pancreatic tissue with blunt tweezers. It can also be carefully cut away with small scissors. For easier anatomical assessment, the pancreas can be divided into anatomical subregions (duodenal, splenic, or gastric) before proceeding with the clearing protocol (Figure 2). Alternatively, for antibody evaluation, the tissue can be sectioned into smaller pieces (2-3 mm3).Postfix pancreata overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C with shaking (~25 RPM on a nutating shaker).Note: Use a ratio of 5:1 PFA to tissue volume in an Eppendorf tube (for sizing, see Table 1). Prolonged fixation can increase tissue autofluorescence. Wash samples 3 times in PBS for 30 min.Place the sample in a Petri dish with PBS, and use fine tweezers to remove hair and lint from the sample under a dissection microscope.Proceed immediately with sample delipidation (Part B).Note: If necessary, samples can be stored in PBS with 0.02% sodium azide (NaN3) at 4°C for a few weeks, but this may impact the quality of the experiment. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210729/20210729224738_7282.jpgFigure 2. Mouse pancreas with surrounding organs and anatomical subregions indicated Human tissue Fix samples in 4% PFA immediately upon acquisition. Leave overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C with shaking (~25 RPM).Proceed with the protocol for mouse tissue starting at Step A7 (PBS × 3).Note: Since human tissue will not be perfused, its quality may be more variable than that of rodent tissue. Sample pretreatment (delipidation, bleaching, and permeabilization)Note: All steps with shaking should be performed at 25 RPM on a nutating shaker. Transfer samples to tubes of adequate size (Table 1) with the sample ideally taking up no more than 25% of the volume of the tube, and label each tube carefully using a scalpel or razor blade.",

    "Dehydrate samples in a gradient of methanol in H2O (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%). Incubate in each concentration for 1 h at RT with shaking. Always fill tubes completely to avoid sample oxidation.Note: Methanol is toxic, flammable, and volatile. Always handle methanol inside a fume hood and collect all waste for proper disposal according to the institutional requirements. Wash samples in 100% methanol for 1 h at RT with shaking.Wash samples in 100% dichloromethane (DCM) for 1 h at RT with shaking to remove hydrophobic lipids.Note: Handle DCM inside a fume hood and use only with compatible materials (e.g., polypropylene). Use double nitrile gloves or gloves compatible with DCM (e.g., neoprene). Collect all waste for proper disposal according to the institutional requirements. Wash samples in 100% methanol for 3 × 30 min at RT with shaking.Bleach samples in 5% H2O2 in methanol overnight at 4°C without shaking to reduce tissue autofluorescence. Keep samples protected from light.Note: H2O2 may degrade with shaking, light, and heat exposure. Rehydrate samples in a reversed gradient of methanol (80, 60, 40, and 20%). Incubate in each concentration for 30 min at RT with shaking.Wash samples in permeabilization buffer for 1 h at RT with shaking.Incubate samples in permeabilization buffer overnight at RT with shaking.Wash samples in PTxwH for 3 × 30 min at RT with shaking.Proceed immediately with immunolabeling.Note: If necessary, delipidated samples can be stored in PTxwH with 0.02% NaN3 at 4°C for a few weeks. Prolonged storage may impair staining efficiency.

    "Block samples in blocking buffer overnight at 37°C with shaking.Prepare primary antibodies by diluting them in PTxwH, mixing on a shaker for 10 min, and centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The volume prepared depends on the tube and sample size (Table 1). Transfer the spun-down antibody solution to the sample tube, leaving ~10 μl at the bottom of the antibody tube to remove precipitates. Add 3% NDS to the sample. If necessary, add extra PTxwH to the sample to fill the tube all the way up.Incubate samples with primary antibodies for 3-6 days, depending on sample size, at 37°C with shaking. Protect samples from light.Note: Add 0.01% NaN3 to prevent microbial growth and protect the antibodies from degrading during extended incubation times. An incubation time of 6 days is recommended for whole mouse pancreatic tissue and large hemipancreata to ensure complete and even antibody diffusion (see “Notes” section). Wash samples with PTxwH 5 times over 1 day at RT, with the final wash overnight.Prepare secondary antibodies by diluting them in PTxwH, mixing them on a shaker for 10 min, and centrifuging them at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The volume prepared depends on the tube and sample size (Table 1). Transfer the spun-down antibody solution to the sample tube, leaving ~10 μl at the bottom of the antibody tube to remove precipitates. Add 3% NDS to the sample. If necessary, add extra PTxwH to the sample to fill the tube all the way up.Note: It is recommended to use red or far-red secondary antibodies. Due to tissue autofluorescence, GFP-tagged secondary antibodies can only be used for markers with very high expression, and it is not recommended to use secondary antibodies with shorter wavelengths.",
    "Near-infrared secondary antibodies can also be used for highly expressed markers but may require prolonged exposure times during imaging. Incubate samples with secondary antibodies for 3-6 days, depending on sample size, at 37°C with shaking. Protect samples from light.Note: Add 0.01% NaN3 to prevent microbial growth and protect the antibodies from degradation during extended incubation times. Wash samples with PTxwH 5 times over 1 day at RT, with the final wash overnight.Wash samples with PBS 5 times over 1 day at RT, with the final wash overnight.Embed pancreatic samples in 1% low melting point agarose in PBS. Heat the agarose/PBS in a microwave until melted, then pour into a Petri dish to cool. When the temperature of the agarose falls below 37°C (this can be measured with a thermometer or by hand), place the pancreas carefully in the liquid agarose using tweezers, taking care to position it properly and cover it in agarose with no air bubbles. Low melting point agarose starts to solidify at 25°C, but this process can be sped up by placing the Petri dish in the fridge. Use a razor blade or scalpel to cut the agarose to size after solidifying.Note: Embedding is necessary for light sheet imaging but may not be necessary for confocal imaging of small pancreatic sections in an Ibidi μ-slide or glass-bottomed Petri dish. Tissue clearingNote: Protect samples from light during all steps. Dehydrate samples in a gradient of methanol/H2O (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%); each step is for 1 h at RT with shaking. The samples can optionally be left overnight in methanol at RT.Note: Methanol is toxic, flammable, and volatile. Always handle inside a fume hood and collect all waste for proper disposal.",
    "Wash samples in 100% methanol 3 times for at least 30 min each at RT with shaking.Wash samples in 100% DCM 3 times for 30 min each at RT with shaking.Note: Handle DCM inside a fume hood and be careful to only use it with compatible materials (e.g., polypropylene). Use double nitrile gloves or gloves compatible with DCM (e.g., neoprene). Collect all waste for proper disposal. Transfer samples into dibenzyl ether (DBE) for clearing (Figure 3). Fill tubes with DBE to the top to avoid any air being left in the tube, which can cause sample oxidation. Store samples in DBE, protected from light.Note: Samples in DBE can be stored at RT, but storage at 4°C may preserve fluorescence for longer. The melting point of DBE is 1.5-3.5°C, so samples stored in a fridge may freeze. Handle DBE in a fume hood and collect any waste for proper disposal according to the institutional requirements. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210729/20210729224939_5681.jpgFigure 3. Optical clearing. Agarose-embedded mouse pancreata before (left) and after (right) being subjected to the optical clearing protocol.ImagingA light sheet microscope (LaVision Ultramicroscope II or similar) is recommended for whole tissue and hemipancreata. A 1.3× or 2× objective is suitable for whole-tissue mounts, whereas a 4× or 12× objective is recommended for fine innervation. An inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM or similar) equipped with a 10× objective is recommended for imaging small pancreatic sections, particularly when a higher resolution is needed, such as for analyses of nerve contacts or pancreatic ganglia. Figure 4 shows the differences in magnification between the systems and objectives.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210729/20210729224957_6174.jpgFigure 4. System comparisons. Single z-stack images captured with a light sheet microscope (LaVision Ultramacroscope II) equipped with a 1.3× objective, a 4× objective, and a 12× objective (hemipancreata), and an inverted confocal microscope equipped with a 10× objective (small pancreatic section).",
    "Light sheet imaging Note: Always consult the microscopy core facility and/or specific microscope user manual for details on operation. In a fume hood, remove the sample from its storage vial with blunt tweezers and attach it to a correctly sized sample holder (Figure 5A).Large, agarose-embedded samples may need to be secured to a flat sample holder with cyanoacrylate glue (Figure 5B).Assemble the sample holder into the sample mount, which is then submerged in DBE in the cuvette of the light sheet microscope (Figure 5C). Take care not to spill DBE on the instrument, and clean any spills immediately with methanol. Replace gloves contaminated with DBE before handling any instrument or equipment to avoid damage.Orient the sample mount in the cuvette to ensure that the sample is perpendicular to the light sheet.Move the sample using the joystick until the light sheet illuminates the sample, then lower the objective to focus the sample. If using a dipping objective, move it until it touches the surface of the DBE, then lower it slowly to prevent accidentally hitting the sample or holder. Adjust the display settings to properly view the sample while focusing.In the light sheet microscope software (ImSpectorPro), select which light sheet(s) to use (this will depend on the specific instrument; consult with the imaging core) and adjust the width of the light sheet so that it evenly illuminates the entire sample. Select the lasers and adjust the focus for each channel individually if using multiple wavelengths. Adjust the laser power and exposure time to ensure a non-saturated signal.Save your user settings to ensure consistency between imaging sessions.Note: Always use the same imaging settings for samples that will be statistically compared. For whole-mount imaging, acquire z-stacked optical sections at 1.",
    "3× or 2× magnification with the lowest zoom setting and a step size of 3-5 μm. This resolution is sufficient to image insulin+ islets and large filamentous structures such as nerve trunks, ducts, and blood vessels.Acquire z-stacked optical sections at 4× or 12× magnification with dynamic horizontal focus and a step size of 2-5 μm to generate images suitable for assessing finer structures, such as individual α cells, β cells, fine filamentous innervation, fine ducts, blood capillaries, and intrapancreatic ganglia. For analyses of ganglia, which can consist of as few as two neurons, it is important to use sufficient magnification to confidently identify individual cell bodies (Figure 4).Tiled mosaic images can be acquired at 4× and 12× with 20% overlap and stitched using the plugin TeraStitcher (Bria and Iannello, 2012). However, generating mosaic images can be time consuming and result in very large files that require more processing power to analyze. An alternative to mosaic images is to acquire 1-3 separate z-stacks at 4× or 12× magnification from each sample, segment and analyze them separately, and pool the results.Note: Factors that affect the light sheet acquisition time are exposure time, dynamic horizontal focus (number of steps per image), and step size. The step size will also affect the final file size. The exposure time can be shortened by increasing the laser power; however, an increased laser power increases the risk of sample bleaching, so only increase the laser power immediately before imaging. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210729/20210729225019_8216.jpgFigure 5. Sample mounting for light sheet microscopy. Sample holder for smaller agarose-embedded samples, where the sample is fixed with a screw (A). Sample holder for large agarose-embedded samples, where the sample is fixed with glue (B). The sample holder is then attached to the sample mount and fixed with a screw for submerging in DBE (C).",
    "Confocal imaging Note: If performing light sheet and confocal imaging of the same samples, do the confocal imaging last due to the increased risk of sample bleaching. Always consult the microscopy core facility and/or microscope user manual for details on operation. Remove the sample from the storage vial using fine blunt tweezers and place it in a glass-bottomed μ-slide or a μ-dish, avoiding air bubbles between the sample and the glass.Check the integrity of the chamber/slide before and after imaging to ensure that DBE is not leaking, which can damage the microscope.Acquire z-stacked optical sections with a standard 10× objective and a step size of 5-10 μm for larger structures such as islets and ganglia, or a step size <5 μm for finer details such as nerve contacts. Note: Due to the shorter working distance, a standard 20× objective can only be used for imaging structures that are close to the sample surface. For higher magnification, it is recommended to use an objective with a long working distance."
