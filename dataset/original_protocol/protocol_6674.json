    "Preparation of bacteriocin production medium and bacterial growthPrepare the bacteriocin production BAC semi-solid agar medium in a beaker and keep the sterilized medium in the cold room overnight (18-24 h) before inoculation.Prepare a preculture of bacteriocin-producing LAB strain of interest into a sterile 13 ml culture tube with ventilation cap containing 10 ml of THYE broth, and incubate statically at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator for 18 h.Using a sterile glass Pasteur pipet, stab the BAC semi-solid agar medium approximately 300 times under aseptic conditions (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3824/bioprotoc-10-22-3824-g001.jpgFigure 1. Stabbing of the bacteriocin production medium. Using a sterile glass Pasteur pipet of 22.9 cm, the semi-solid agar medium is stabbed multiple times. The depth of the stabs should correspond to the tip length of the pipet used (approx. 120 mm for a Pasteur pipet of 22.9 cm).Pour the overnight preculture of the bacteriocin-producing LAB strain on the surface of the BAC semi-solid agar medium and cover the beaker with the same aluminum foil used for sterilization of the medium. Use 5 ml of an overnight preculture at an OD600 of ~1.0 per liter of BAC semi-solid agar medium (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3824/bioprotoc-10-22-3824-g002.jpgFigure 2. Inoculation of the bacteriocin production medium Incubate the mixture at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator for 72 h (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3824/bioprotoc-10-22-3824-g003.jpgFigure 3. Culture of bacteriocin-producing LAB obtained after 72 h of incubation. Bacterial growth of Streptococcus mutans LAB761, a strain encoding several bacteriocin loci, can be seen in stabbed BAC semi-solid agar medium.Extraction of secreted bacteriocinsMash the mixture using a spatula and transfer into 250 ml centrifuge bottles (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3824/bioprotoc-10-22-3824-g004.jpgFigure 4. The stabbed bacteriocin medium showing bacterial growth (A) is mashed into small pieces using a spatula (B).",
    "The mashed mixture is then transferred into centrifuge bottles (C) Store the bottles containing the mashed mixture in an ultra-low temperature freezer for 18 h.Thaw the mixture by putting the bottles in a water bath at 65 °C for 1 h. The freeze/thaw cycle is necessary in order to disrupt the cell membrane of LAB.Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 40 min at 4 °C using a floor refrigerated centrifuge.Carefully collect the supernatant (Figure 5A) and transfer into a 1 L glass bottle.Add an equal volume of chloroform (Figure 5B) and shake vigorously by hand for 20 min (Figure 5C). Store the mixture at 4 °C overnight (18-24 h).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3824/bioprotoc-10-22-3824-g005.jpgFigure 5. Chloroform extraction of bacteriocins. One volume of chloroform is added to one volume of collected supernatant (A). The mixture (B) is mixed thoroughly by hand for approx. 20 min (C).Remove the upper layer and transfer the white layer into screw cap tube 50 ml (Figure 6). Let the emulsion settle on its own (approx. 5-10 min).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3824/bioprotoc-10-22-3824-g006.jpgFigure 6. Bacteriocin extraction following chloroform method. The upper phase (A) corresponding to the “chloroform waste” is carefully removed (B) and the white material containing the secreted peptides is transferred into 50 ml tubes (C).Collect the floating white interfacial layer and transfer into a glass beaker (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3824/bioprotoc-10-22-3824-g007.jpgFigure 7. Extraction of bacteriocin following chloroform method. A floating white interfacial layer should be clearly visible (A). The white interface corresponding to the bacteriocin fraction is transferred into a glass beaker (B).Keep the material in a fume hood until complete evaporation of the residual chloroform (approx. 2-3 days). A bacteriocin-containing powder of brownish color should be obtained (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3824/bioprotoc-10-22-3824-g008.jpgFigure 8. Appearance of the extracellular peptide extract following complete evaporation Dissolve the extracellular peptide extract in 25 ml of ACN-TFA solvent.",
    "Transfer the resuspended extracellular peptide extract in a screw cap tube 50 ml.Centrifuge at 3,200 x g for 40 min at 4 °C using a benchtop refrigerated centrifuge to remove insoluble materials.Transfer the clear supernatant into a clean screw cap tube 50 ml.The supernatant is passed through a 0.22 µm syringe filter with low protein binding membrane.Prewash a C18 cartridge with 100 ml of methanol:water, 80:20 v/v.The resultant liquid obtained at Step A18 is passed through a Sep-Pak® C18 cartridge using 50 ml of increasing concentration of methanol:water v/v (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 95% [pH 2]) using a portable pump at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. All fractions are tested for bacteriocin activity using a spot-on-lawn assay.To obtain a more concentrated peptide extract, dry the active fractions using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator at room temperature and dissolve using ACN-TFA solvent to acquire desirable concentrations.Keep an aliquot of the extracellular peptide extract at 4 °C for immediate use while the rest is stored in a freezer (-20 °C).Detection of bacteriocin activity using spot-on-lawnPrepare a preculture of a target strain into a sterile 13 ml culture tube with ventilation cap containing 3 ml of THYE broth, and incubate statically at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator for 18 h.Measure the absorbance (OD600) of the preculture and dilute the target strain in 4 ml of Columbia soft-agar pre-warmed at 55 °C to obtain a concentration of approximately 107 CFU/ml using a plot standard curve (OD600 vs. CFU/ml).Pour the inoculated soft-agar onto the surface of a Columbia-CaCO3 agar plate. Keep at room temperature until the top layer has solidified.Prepare a series of two-fold serial dilutions (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128) of the extracellular peptide extract in ACN-TFA solvent.",
    "Drop 20 µl aliquots of two-fold serially diluted extracellular peptide extract on top of Columbia-CaCO3 agar plate overlay containing the sensitive target strain. Wait until the drops have been completely absorbed before incubating the plates. To accelerate the absorption, keep the plates next to the flame of a Bunsen burner with the lid slightly off for 10-15 min.Incubate the plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator for 18 h."
