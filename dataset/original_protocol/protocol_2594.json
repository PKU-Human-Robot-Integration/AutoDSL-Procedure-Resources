    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGeneration of antibody heavy and light chain plasmids from primary sequence\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nThe purpose of this section is to generate two separate expression plasmids, one encoding the sequence for the antibody heavy chain and one encoding the sequence of the antibody light chain.\nWith antibody heavy and light chain sequences in-hand, design and order two separate gene fragments, one containing the entire heavy chain sequence, and one containing the entire light chain sequence.\nNote: When ordering the gene fragments, use a codon optimization algorithm that optimizes the sequence for expression in human cells. Also, make sure the gene fragments contain the sequence elements required for downstream cloning (e.g., appropriate overhangs for Gibson assembly).\nCritical: Signal peptides target proteins through the secretory pathway, thus it is critical to include signal peptide sequences in both heavy and light chain gene fragments so that antibodies will be secreted into the cell growth media. If native signal peptides are included in the sequence (e.g., sequences are obtained through transcriptome sequencing), include these in the gene fragments. If they are not (e.g., sequences are obtained through mass spectrometry analysis of purified antibodies), make sure to add signal peptide sequences, located N-terminal to the variable region of each chain13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAlternatives: A cost-saving alternative to ordering gene fragments encoding for the entire heavy and light chain sequences is to only order the variable regions of each of the chains and clone them into parent plasmids along with constant regions of choice (described below in step 5).\nUpon receipt of the gene fragments, follow the manufacturer’s provided protocol to suspend the DNA in nuclease-free water. We order gene fragments from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and follow their protocol for resuspension of the plasmids as follows:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2253-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Heavy and light chain expression plasmids for production of full-length IgG antibodies\nShown on the left is a schematic indicating the major components of the two expression plasmids containing the heavy chain and light chain sequences. Light brown indicates the expression plasmid backbone (typically containing a CMV promotor for high expression in human cells). Red indicates the signal peptide sequence, which directs the expressed protein through the secretory system and into the cell media. The two shades of green indicate the heavy and light chain variable regions, and the two shades of purple indicate the heavy and light chain constant regions. Shown on the right is a schematic of a full-length IgG antibody, which is also color-coded.\nCentrifuge the tube for 3–5 s at 3,000 × g in a microcentrifuge to pellet material to bottom of the tube.\nAdd nuclease-free water to the tube to reach the desired concentration (e.g., 25 μL for a final concentration of 20 ng/μL from a synthesis scale of 500 ng).\nBriefly vortex, and spin down again.\nDetermine DNA fragment concentration (e.g., using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer) and store at −20°C when not in use.\nPrepare parent plasmids for gene fragment insertion.\nDigest 1 μg of the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (or other expression plasmid) with appropriate restriction enzymes (e.g., we digest the pEGFP-N1 plasmid with Sac1 and Not1 to remove the sequence encoding for EGFP and to linearize the plasmid).\nRun the digest on a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer.\nUsing a clean razor blade, cut out the band corresponding to digested plasmid, place in an Eppendorf tube and purify from the agarose gel using a DNA gel recovery kit (e.g., Zymo Clean Gel DNA Recovery Kit).\nDetermine DNA digest concentration (e.g., using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer).",
    "Use digested plasmid for both heavy and light chain “parent” plasmids as needed in downstream cloning reactions. Store at −20°C when not in use.\nNote: Any plasmid designed for a high level of protein expression in mammalian cells (e.g., driven by a CMV promotor) can be used to generate the parent heavy and light chain plasmids for this protocol.\nClone entire heavy and light chain DNA from the gene fragments into separate, digested heavy and light chain parent plasmids. The Gibson assembly method that we use is described here:\nTo a single 15 μL aliquot of isothermal enzyme mix (or commercially purchased Gibson enzyme mix), add 50–100 ng of digested parent plasmid and the gene fragment of interest using a 1:2 molar ratio (digest:fragment). In a typical Gibson reaction, for the heavy chain, we use 100 ng parent plasmid (3,952 bp) and 70 ng heavy chain DNA fragment (1,400 bp), and for the light chain, we use 100 ng parent plasmid (3,952 bp) and 35 ng light chain DNA fragment (700–800 bp).\nBring the reaction volume to 20 μL with H2O, mix, and incubate at 50°C for 20 min.\nTransform 3 μL of each cloning reaction into DH5α competent E. coli cells, and grow on appropriate LB (Luria broth) + antibiotic agar plates (e.g., our parent plasmids are Kanamycin resistant).\nSelect and expand individual colonies for screening by inoculating 3 mL LB plus antibiotic, and shake at 225 rpm for 16 h at 37°C.\nPurify plasmid DNA clones using a DNA miniprep kit.\nScreen for correct plasmid clones by Sanger or nanopore sequencing.\nStore positive clones as miniprep DNA at −20°C.",
    "Critical: The Gibson assembly cloning method requires 20 base pair overlapping sequence regions between gene fragments and digested parent plasmids. Information on Gibson cloning can be found in Gibson et al.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] and Gibson.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nAlternatives: As an alternative to generating in-house isothermal assembly enzyme mixes, Gibson enzyme mixes can be purchased commercially.\nAn alternative to cloning the entire heavy and light chain sequences into parent plasmids is to order gene fragments containing only the heavy and light chain variable regions. These are then combined with heavy and light chain constant regions (amplified by PCR), and cloned into parent plasmids. The Gibson assembly method for this approach is described here:\nFollowing steps 1 and 2 above, design, order, and prepare two separate gene fragments, one containing the heavy chain variable sequence, and one containing the light chain variable sequence. Again, be sure to include signal peptide sequences and any necessary overlap sequences for downstream cloning.\nUsing standard PCR methodologies, design primers and perform PCR to obtain DNA fragments of the heavy chain constant region and light chain constant region of choice (using PCRBio VeriFi Mix or similar), being mindful to ensure that the fragments will be compatible with your downstream cloning method of choice.",
    "For both the heavy and light chains (in separate reactions), to a single 15 μL aliquot of isothermal assembly enzyme mix (or commercially purchased Gibson enzyme mix), add 50–100 ng of digested parent plasmid, the variable region gene fragment, and the corresponding constant region PCR fragment using a 1:2:2 molar ratio (digested parent plasmid:variable region gene fragment:constant region PCR fragment). For example, in a typical Gibson reaction for assembling the heavy chain expression plasmid, we would use 100 ng of digested parent plasmid (3,952 bp), 20 ng heavy chain variable region fragment (400 bp), and 50 ng heavy chain constant region PCR fragment (1,000 bp).\nFollow steps 4b–4g above to complete the cloning process.\nPrepare purified DNA (e.g., Maxipreps) of the appropriate expression plasmids containing both the heavy and light chain antibody sequences.\nCritical: Ensure that DNA preparations contain an endotoxin removal step.\nTransfection of expression plasmids into human suspension cell cultures\nTiming: 6–8 days\nThe purpose of this section is to transfect the two antibody expression plasmids, one encoding the heavy chain and one encoding the light chain, into human suspension cell cultures.\nTwenty-four hours prior to transfection, seed 30 mL cells at 1 × 106 cells/mL for a total of 30 × 106 cells. The viability should be greater than > 90%.\nNote: Depending on the desired yield, the number of cells can be scaled up. Irrespective of the total number of cells, seed at 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nOn the day of transfection, count cells and ensure that > 90% of the cells are viable. Pellet 45 × 106 cells by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 4 min at 4°C.",
    "Aspirate off the supernatant and gently resuspend cell pellet in 15 mL fresh Expi293F media. Return resuspended cells to spinner flasks and incubate in the orbital shaker while the transfection reagent reactions are prepared.\nPrepare the transfection reactions.\nMix 100 μL of polyethylenimine (PEI) at 1 mg/mL plus 1 mL serum-free Optimem media.\nIn a second tube, mix 50 μg of the light chain plasmid, 35 μg of the heavy chain plasmid (3:2 of light chain plasmid to heavy chain plasmid), in 1 mL of Optimem media.\nIncubate contents of the two separate tubes for 5 min with occasional flicking, at a temperature between 20°C–25°C.\nAfter 5 min, combine the contents of the two tubes and incubate for 15 min at a temperature between 20°C–25°C, flicking the tube approximately every 2 min to ensure thorough mixing.\nRemove cells from the orbital shaker, add the transfection reaction, place the cells back in the shaker, and incubate for 24 h, rotating at 125 rpm.\nRemove cells from the shaker and add 15 mL fresh Expi293F media to the 17 mL culture plus 300 μL of 220 mM valproic acid, which has been shown to increase recombinant protein production. Return cells to the shaker and incubate for 4 days.",
    "Four days after addition of the valproic acid, it is advisable to test the cell media for positive antibody reactivity using an assay that the purified antibody is intended to be used for (e.g., immunofluorescence, immunoblotting). To test, remove 0.5 mL of the media, spin at 2,000 × g for 4 min at 4°C, and collect the supernatant/clarified media. We suggest testing a range of dilutions of the clarified media (from undiluted to 1:1000). We typically test the media at days 4, 5, and 6 post-transfection to determine the optimal time window in which to harvest the antibody. This may vary between antibody preparations and should be tested for each different antibody individually.\nPurification of antibodies\nTiming: 2 days\nAfter transfection of the expression plasmids, Expi293F cells will produce the antibody heavy and light chains and secrete the folded, bi-valent antibody into the cell media. The purpose of this section of the protocol is to harvest and purify the antibody for use in downstream applications.\nFour to six days post-transfection, and ideally after confirming positive reactivity of the cell media (see step 13), remove cells from the incubator, transfer to a 50 mL conical tube, and centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 4 min at 4°C to pellet the cells. Remove the antibody-containing supernatant without disturbing the pellet, and pass through a 0.2 μm filter into a sterile 100 mL glass bottle. Measure the volume of the filtered supernatant, and add 1.0 M Tris-HCL (pH 7.4) to bring the pH between 7.4–7.7 (adding ∼10% of the measured volume, or 3 mL to a 30 mL prep). Store the filtered supernatant at 4°C until purification, which is optimally within 24 h of harvesting.",
    "Remove a prepared Protein A Sepharose column from storage at 4°C (see “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] / preparation of key reagents and supplies[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]\" section above). Attach to a column stand and open the stopcock to drain storage buffer. Wash the column with 30 mL (approximately 3 column volumes) 1 × TBS (pH 8.0). Drain the wash buffer until it approaches, but does not enter the compacted Protein A Sepharose (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2253-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Images of the column apparatus used for protein purification\n(A) The white arrow indicates the top of the Protein A Sepharose bed, and the image shows the liquid approaching, but not entering, compacted bed.\n(B) The funnel reservoir is attached to the top of the column.\n(C) The reservoir adaptor is placed on top of the funnel reservoir and then attached to the peristaltic pump through tubing.\n(D) The column adaptor is placed on top of the column and attached to the peristaltic pump through tubing.\n(E) The column cap is placed on top of the column for storage.\nNote: The binding affinity of Protein A for the constant region of IgG antibodies varies depending on the specific subclass of IgG. For our purifications, we have used Protein A beads for all antibodies thus far, which include the following subclasses: mouse IgG1, mouse IgG2a, mouse IgG2b and rabbit IgG kappa. For these subclasses of antibodies, Protein G has a similar affinity as Protein A, therefore Protein G could also be used. In the cases where the constant region of a particular antibody subclass has a higher affinity for Protein A vs. G, this should be taken into consideration when choosing between the two.\nApply the antibody-containing cell media to the column.\nClose the stopcock and place a funnel reservoir on the top of the column (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Move the column apparatus to a 4°C walk-in cold room.\nSlowly add the filtered cell media to the column. The cell media should fill the column and partially fill the funnel reservoir.\nAllow any disrupted Protein A Sepharose to settle for 1 h.\nOnce the Protein A Sepharose has settled, place a reservoir adaptor (with an inlet for tubing) on the funnel reservoir, and attach the apparatus to a peristaltic pump with tubing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nOpen the stopcock, turn on the peristaltic pump and collect the flow-through at a rate of 1 mL/min into a sterile 100 mL glass bottle.\nOnce the liquid approaches the compacted Protein A Sepharose bed, close the stopcock.\nRemove the reservoir adaptor, and gently add back the collected flow-through to the funnel reservoir.\nAllow the Protein A Sepharose to re-settle for 1 h.\nOpen the stopcock and collect the flow-through at a rate of 1 mL/min.\nStop the pump and close the stopcock when the liquid approaches the compacted Protein A Sepharose.\nRemove the funnel reservoir, slowly add 3 mL of 1 × TBS (pH 8.0) to the column, and let settle for 15 min.\nGently attach a column adaptor with a threaded valve on top of the column and connect via tubing to the peristaltic pump (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nOpen the stopcock and collect the flow-through at a rate of 1 mL/min.\nWhen the buffer approaches the top of the compacted Protein A Sepharose, close the stopcock.\nElute the antibody from the Protein A Sepharose.\nSlowly add 9 mL of elution buffer to the column.\nOpen the stopcock and turn on the peristaltic pump adjusted to a flow rate of 5 mL/min.\nCollect the eluate in a 15 mL conical tube containing 0.9 mL 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).",
    "Once all of the elution buffer has entered the Protein A Sepharose, close the stopcock, and stop the pump.\nImmediately cap and invert the 15 mL conical tube to mix the solution and neutralize the low pH of the elution buffer.\nImmediately clean the Protein A Sepharose column to avoid any damage to the Sepharose beads.\nGently fill the column with elution buffer and set the peristaltic pump to 5 mL/min.\nWash with two column volumes of elution buffer (∼20 mL) followed by two column volumes (∼20 mL) of 1 × TBS (pH 8.0).\nAfter the second 1 × TBS (pH 8.0) wash, stop the pump and close the stopcock when the 1 × TBS (pH 8.0) approaches the compacted Protein A Sepharose bed.\nFill the column with 20% EtOH (∼7 mL), place a cap on the column (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E), and store upright at 4°C. Columns can be used for up to 5 rounds of purification of an individual antibody before being discarded.\nTransfer the eluate from step 17 into pre-soaked dialysis membrane, and seal with dialysis clips. Place the dialysis membrane into a beaker containing 1 L of 1 × PBS (pH 7.2) and a 6 cm stir bar. Gently stir at 4°C for 4 h. After 4 h, replace the 1 × PBS (pH 7.2) with 1 L fresh 1 × PBS and stir for 14–16 h at 4°C.",
    "Soak a 30 kDa cutoff centrifugal filter concentrator in 1 × PBS for 1 min, and then spin at 2000 x g for 1 min to remove PBS. Retrieve purified, dialyzed antibodies from the tubing and place into the concentrator (should be approximately 10 mL). Spin at 2,000 × g, and check the volume of the concentrated antibody solution every 20 min, until the final, concentrated volume reaches between 100 and 200 μL.\nRemove the purified antibody from the concentrator and measure the protein concentration (e.g. using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer). Dilute the antibody to 1–2 mg/mL in 1 × PBS (pH 7.2) plus 15% glycerol. Aliquot the antibody into tubes and store at −20°C.\nNote: We typically make small-volume aliquots (2–5 μL), in order to avoid multiple freeze/thaw events), as well as large-volume, “stock” aliquots (100–200 μL). Once the stock aliquots are thawed, we re-aliquot the antibody into smaller, 2–5 μL aliquots.\nSerially dilute a sample of the purified antibody and load a 4%–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with the samples (e.g., ∼0.01 μg–40 μg). Run the gel according to standard SDS-PAGE protocols, and stain/destain with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or other appropriate protein stain. A typical gel showing the expected bands is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] (gel shown is from DeLuca et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2253-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Image of protein gel in which decreasing concentrations of a purified, recombinant, monoclonal IgG antibody was applied\nStarting from the left, 40–0.01 μg purified rMAb-Hec1ms antibody was run on a 4%–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Antibody chains are labeled in the figure. Gel shown was originally published in DeLuca et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]",
    "Note: After purification, antibodies should be validated for the intended application (e.g., immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation). It is advised to first test a wide range of concentrations and adjust the range accordingly after obtaining initial results.\nNote: In addition to purifying an antibody using the sequences of the heavy and light variable regions paired with sequences of constant regions corresponding to the species the antibody was originally generated in, it is also straightforward to generate plasmids containing the heavy and light chain variable regions combined with the constant regions from a different species. By generating species specificity variants of an original antibody, this overcomes a common limitation in indirect immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical experiments, where the combination of antigens researchers wish to detect is limited by the species specificity. Sequences of plasmids containing constant regions specific to mouse, rabbit, and human can be found in DeLuca et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]",
    "Note: Once an antibody sequence is in-hand, it is also possible to generate single chain antibody fragments including native scFv (single chain variable fragments) and native scFvC (single chain variable fragments plus a truncated constant region). “Native” is used to indicate that the scFv or scFvC fragments are derived from the original primary sequence of the full-length antibody. Such fragments can be designed such that they are genetically encoded and tagged (e.g., with a fluorescent protein) for expression and visualization in cells. In brief, to generate a native scFv, the following PCR fragments are produced: (1) the heavy chain variable region; (2) a flexible linker, and (3) the light chain variable region. PCR fragments are then cloned into a parent plasmid containing the sequence for GFP, resulting in a final single scFv plasmid. For construction of a native scFvC plasmid, the following PCR fragments should be generated: (1) heavy chain variable region; (2) a flexible linker, (3) the light chain variable region, and (4) heavy chain constant regions CH2 and CH3, specific to the species of preference. Similar to the scFv protocol, PCR fragments are then cloned into a parent plasmid containing the sequence for GFP, resulting in a final, single scFvC plasmid. Plasmids can then be transfected into a cell line of choice and imaged via fluorescence microscopy. All relevant plasmid sequences for this protocol can be found in DeLuca et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]",
    "Note: There are growing numbers of scFv sequences available to the public due to advances in approaches such as antibody phage display and hypervariable domain grafting.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] Using the techniques described in this protocol, it is possible and straightforward to reverse-engineer full-length, bivalent antibodies from an scFv sequence. In brief, to convert an scFv sequence into a full-length antibody, PCR fragments are generated corresponding to the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of the scFv, which both include an N-terminal signal peptide. PCR fragments corresponding to the light chain and heavy chain constant regions (chosen from the species of choice) are also generated and, together with the heavy and light chain variable regions, are cloned into an expression plasmid for transfection into HEK293 cells for downstream purification."
