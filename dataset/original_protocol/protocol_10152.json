    "1. Decellularization of Plant Tissue Using the Detergent-based Approach\nUse fresh or frozen F. hispida, leaf samples. Freeze unused fresh samples in a -20 °C freezer and store for future use (up to a year).\n\tNOTE: Use stem or leaf tissue of nearly any desired plant. Extended storage times can cause damage to the tissues.\n\t\nDetermine the size and shape of samples to be processed on the basis of the sample’s intended use (i.e. samples cut into strips are well suited for mechanical testing applications, meanwhile 8 mm disc samples are useful in multi-well culturing applications). Cut the leaf into 8 mm discs with a sharp, clean biopsy punch while submerged under room temperature (20-25 °C) deionized H2O.\n\t\tNote: This protocol can be used on whole leaves and stems. However, smaller samples will decellularize faster.\nIncubate the samples for 5-10 min at room temperature (20-25 °C) deionized H2O on a shake plate set to a low speed setting to wash and/or thaw them. Use enough deionized H2O to ensure all samples are thoroughly wetted.\nPrepare a solution of 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in deionized H2O. Place the samples in a suitable container (a glass or plastic dish is ideal) and add SDS solution to completely cover the samples. Incubate samples for 5 days at room temperature (20-25 °C) on a shake plate set to a low speed to prevent damage to the samples.\n\tNOTE: Do not overcrowd the container as this can slow down the decellularization process and lead to uneven treatment by the SDS. During this step, samples should acquire a brown hue.\n\t\nAfter 5 days, replace the SDS solution with deionized H2O. Incubate the samples for an additional 10-15 min on the shake plate to thoroughly rinse off any residual SDS solution.",
    "Prepare a 1% (v/v) non-ionic surfactant in 10% (v/v) bleach solution. To make a 500 mL solution, mix 5 mL of the non-ionic surfactant with 50 mL of bleach then add 445 mL of deionized H2O. Submerge samples in the freshly prepared solution.\n\tNOTE: The non-ionic surfactant/bleach solution does not have a long shelf life, therefore, should be used within 48 h of preparation.\nReplace the non-ionic surfactant/bleach solution every 24 h until the samples are completely cleared (refer to Figure 1A for visual comparison). Then incubate the sample in deionized water on a shake plate for 2 min to rinse off the excess non-ionic surfactant/bleach solution. Set the shake plate to a low setting to prevent damaging the samples.\n\tNOTE: The time required to clear the samples used varies, depending on the type and species of the plant. The complete discoloring of the samples is indicative of full decellularization (perform DNA quantification to ensure thorough clearing).\n\t\nLyophilize the samples to store them up to a year (flash freezing using liquid nitrogen is preferred, freezing samples in -80 °C is also acceptable) and store them at room temperature (20-25 °C) in low humidity.\nReconstitute samples in Tris-HCl (10 mM, pH 8.5) using enough to coat samples. Rinse samples 2-3 times in serum-free media gently using a micropipette before use (i.e. use 150-300 µL per rinse, in a standard 24 well plate).\n\t\tNOTE: Tris-HCl buffer and serum-free media (i.e. DMEM, but any basic cell culture media can be substituted) are more effective in lowering the impact to cell viability of SDS treated samples than those treated with deionized H2O alone.\n2. Preparation of Samples Using the Detergent-free Decellularization Approach\nNOTE: The initial steps of this procedure coincide with steps 1.1-1.1.2 (see above).",
    "Prepare a 5% (v/v) bleach (NaClO) and 3% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution. Warm the solution in a fume hood to 60-70 °C for F. hispida leaf samples cut into 8 mm discs while stirring on a hot plate.\n\tNOTE: The sodium bicarbonate can be substituted with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), or sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The desired temperature varies greatly (from room temperature to 90 °C) and should be adjusted according to the properties of the samples used.\nOnce the solution reaches the desired temperature range, submerge the samples and reduce the stirring speed to avoid damaging them. After the samples are visibly cleared (refer to Figure 1B for visual comparison), remove from the bath carefully. Incubate samples once in deionized H2O for 1-2 min to remove excess bleach solution.\n\tNOTE: The time required to clear the samples can vary widely. For example, cut parsley can be cleared in 10-15 min, while thicker and/or larger samples such as whole leaves or stems can take hours in high-temperature baths to clear completely.\nLyophilize the samples and store them at room temperature (20-25 °C) in low humidity.\nSubscription Required.
