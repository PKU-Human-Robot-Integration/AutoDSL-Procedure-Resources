    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      The following steps will show blocks of code for use through terminal (for\n      windows one can install anaconda and use cmd.exe, windows terminal app, or\n      git-bash for linux). The data and files used below are retrieved from the\n      Zenodo link above. The estimated times given assume 16GB RAM, Intel i7\n      8-cores, and the sample data. Note that the software requires around 16GB\n      of RAM.\n    \nData preprocessing\nTiming: <30 min\n    \n      The first SECAT command reads the input files and propagates the\n      information to SECAT’s SQLite database. If the normalize option is true,\n      this step will perform a cyclic LOWESS normalization of the peptide\n      intensities over the replicates and conditions, via a sliding window of\n      the fractions. This step can account and normalize for some variability,\n      for example arising from heterogeneous sample amounts measured by\n      label-free quantification, but not for differences in proteome coverage or\n      SEC gradients between replicates and conditions. A successful\n      normalization results in overlapping total protein abundance profiles over\n      the SEC fractions for all conditions and replicates, changing the total\n      amplitude, but not the underlying distribution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). In contrast, unaligned runs due to different proteome coverage or an\n      unaligned SEC fractionation process will result in altered distributions\n      of conditions and replicates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2691-Fig1.jpg\n          Figure 1.

A set of DIA\n          experiments on the left (red) and a set DDA experiments on the right\n          (blue). The normalization relies on the peptide counts, and the DIA\n          experiment counts are relatively consistent while the DDA experiment\n          counts differ drastically between experiments.\n        \n          (B) The normalization of the DIA data (left, red) successfully smooths\n          the data between the experiments. However, the DDA experiment",
    "normalization has a negative effect on the smoothness of the data. DDA\n          experiments often differ widely in peptide counts between experiments\n          and fractions; therefore, SECAT users should consider whether their\n          experiment should use normalization by viewing the normalization\n          plots.\n        \n        Prepare and move the files listed in the\n        materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section\n        into a folder.\n        \n            Minimum requirements: (1) peptide intensity file, (2) sec\n            (co-fractionation) mw file, (3) uniprot annotation file.\n          \n            First time users are suggested to use the sample data and run the\n            blocks of example code.\n          \n        Run the data preprocessing step by inputting the parameters in\n        terminal-related interface.\n        \n            Example code from sample data:\n            \n>secat preprocess\n--out=hela_string.secat\n--sec=input/hela_sec_mw.csv\n--net=common/9606.protein.lnks.v11.0.txt.gz\n--posnet=common/corum_targets.txt.gz\n--negnet=common/corum_decoys.txt.gz\n--uniprot=common/uniprot_9606_20190402.xml.gz\n--min_interaction_confidence=0\ninput/pep∗.tsv\n            Required/Important Parameters:\n            \n--out PATH\nNote: [Required] The SECAT file is\n              an SQLite database that is saved as ‘.secat’ file.\n            \n            SECAT with a previous ‘.secat’ file will override the current data\n            from the previous run while still maintaining the data structure.\n            \n--sec PATH\nNote: [Required] A table input of\n              the SEC calibration. Refer to the example data for its structure.\n              The five columns are: run_id, sec_id, sec_mw, condition_id, and\n              replicate_id. The run_id must match the names of the intensity\n              file columns. This file may be edited to fit other\n              co-fractionation methods besides SEC if a MW can be ascribed to\n              each fraction.\n            \n--net PATH\nNote: [Optional but recommended] A\n              reference network file for querying interaction targets in the\n              protein profiles. Currently, SECAT supports querying networks in\n              miTAB, STRING DB, BioPlex, and PrePPI formats. The network formats\n              are identified by their column names. Also, a custom target\n              interaction network can be input as well. The target network\n              should be formatted with two columns: one for each protein\n              participating in the interactions. When there is no attached\n              posnet (true positive interaction network) or negnet (true",
    "negative interaction network) the net file is used to create a\n              positive and negative network for the semi-supervised learning.\n              Once SECAT has trained a model, the net file is then used for\n              identifying PPI interactions in the samples. Only interactions\n              listed in this file will be identified and quantified for later\n              analysis. If this parameter is not included, all possible protein\n              interactions will be targeted.\n            \n--posnet PATH\nNote: A positive binary\n              interaction reference file. The interactions will be used as the\n              true positives in the semi-supervised learning by PyProphet when\n              generating the classifier. If a positive network is not included,\n              one will be generated from the target network. The data should be\n              formatted as described above for the ‘net’ input. For an example,\n              refer to the positive CORUM network in the Zenodo repository.\n            \n--negnet PATH\nNote: A negative binary\n              interaction reference file. The interactions will be used as the\n              false interactions in the semi-supervised learning by PyProphet\n              when generating the classifier. If a negative network is not\n              included, one will be generated from the positive network. As\n              previously, refer to the above ‘net’ input format and/or the\n              negative CORUM network from the resources.\n            \n--uniprot PATH\nNote: [Required] UniProt metadata\n              XML file for molecular weight reference (can also be formatted as\n              an xml.gz file). For the best results use the latest UniProt file\n              including the extended TrEMBL entries. In general, the\n              corresponding XML file to the primary mass spectrometric analysis\n              FASTA database should be used.\n            \nNote: UniProt XML parsing works\n              directly on Human, Mouse, and Yeast. However, other organisms may\n              have slightly different UniProt formats that may require parsing\n              modifications.

Use this feature to specify alternative\n              primary analysis software report header names. E.g., for\n              Spectronaut reports, this parameter could be set to --columns\n              run_id sec_id sec_mw condition_id replicate_id R.FileName\n              PG.ProteinAccessions EG.PrecursorId FG.Quantity.

This parameter should be changed if\n              the number of fractions and resolution of the fractionation change\n              dramatically from the example SEC setup. In the sample data,\n              elution peaks span around 10 fractions. Increase the normalization\n              window if your peaks will span significantly more than this.\n            \n--normalize_padded / --no-normalize_padded\nNote: Use padding for first and\n              last SEC fractions to ensure that each fraction is covered by an\n              equal number of windows [default: normalize_padded]. Only consider\n              disabling this option if the sliding window is almost as large as\n              the total number of SEC fractions.\n            \n--decoy_intensity_bins INTEGER\nNote: Number of decoy bins for\n              intensity, only used if no negative network is supplied [default:\n              1]. The number of decoy bins can be tweaked to increase the\n              likelihood of proteins with similar elution profiles to be\n              randomly selected as null data point. This option could be tweaked\n              for experimental designs substantially differing from the SEC\n              experimental design, but generally does not need to be configured.\n            \n--decoy_left_sec_bins INTEGER\nNote: Number of decoy bins for\n              left fraction of an SEC elution peak (start of peak), only used if\n              no negative network is supplied [default: 1]. The number of left\n              decoy bins can be tweaked to increase the likelihood of proteins",

This option could be tweaked for experimental designs\n              substantially differing from the SEC experimental design, but\n              generally does not need to be configured.\n            \n--decoy_right_sec_bins INTEGER\nNote: Number of decoy bins for\n              right fraction of an SEC elution peak (end of peak), only used if\n              no negative network is supplied [default: 1]. The number of right\n              decoy bins can be tweaked to increase the likelihood of proteins\n              with similar elution profiles to be randomly selected as null data\n              point.

The decoy query generation function\n              shuffles the bait_id from the net_data input (or the posnet_data\n              when present). The number of decoys will increase as the decoy\n              oversample parameter increases. We have found that a larger number\n              of decoys improves the accuracy of the classifier.\n            \n--decoy_subsample / --no-decoy_subsample\nNote: Decoys generation is\n              subsampled to approximately the same number of targets queries\n              [default: no-decoy_subsample]. Use this parameter with care.\n              Generally, more decoys are beneficial to the classifier\n              performance. However, this can be useful if there is an\n              overwhelming number of decoys that are negatively affecting the\n              error-rate estimation step.\n            \n--min_interaction_confidence FLOAT\nNote: Minimum interaction\n              confidence for reference interaction databases. Use this parameter\n              to filter out interactions in networks that include a confidence\n              score for each entry [default: 0.0] (E.g., probability > 0.9\n              for STRING, and probability > 0.5 for PrePPI).\n            \n--interaction_confidence_bins INTEGER\nNote: Number of interaction\n              confidence bins for grouped error rate estimation if a reference\n              interaction confidence value is provided for the target network",
    "[default: 100]. When used with reference interaction networks like\n              STRING DB or PrePPI, which provide a confidence score for\n              different categories of interactions, higher likelihood PPIs will\n              be scored in separate groups than lower likelihood PPIs, thus\n              increasing the sensitivity.\n            \n--interaction_confidence_quantile /\n                  --no-interaction_confidence_quantile\nNote: Whether interaction\n              confidence bins should be grouped by quantiles [default:\n              interaction_confidence_quantile]. If the prior confidence scores\n              should be considered as a confidence ranking score, rather than as\n              an accurate distribution of the score, grouping interactions by\n              quantiles can be more robust.\n            \n--use_cached_uniprot True/False\nNote: Stores a parquet file of the\n              parsed Uniprot file on disk to reduce preprocessing time for\n              future runs. The file is stored with the same base name as the\n              input Uniprot file from part f. and in the same directory. This\n              parameter is intended to reduce the memory footprint of the data\n              preprocessing step and to reduce execution time overall. The same\n              Uniprot file will yield the same table internally so there is no\n              benefit to re-parsing the file during each run. Caching is not the\n              default so users must explicitly include the flag to utilize\n              Uniprot file caching.\n            \n--help\nNote: Shows brief description of\n              parameters.\n            \n        Check the normalization of the data and continue to signal processing.\n      \nNote: Low/Empty intensity fractions often\n      overcorrect and disrupt normalization. Overcorrection is easily detected\n      by viewing the normalized plot PDF reports and can be overcome by removing\n      or correcting empty fractions. In our experience, removing empty/low\n      intensity fractions in only the problem condition/replicate will usually\n      resolve this issue.

Each\n      protein’s peptide elution profiles are used to compute a score for signal",
    "cross-correlation, elution coverage, and other criteria that can be used\n      by the classifier in the next step to differentiate true from false\n      interactions. By default, the scoring in SECAT does not use any peak\n      picking methods, but certain data types may benefit from the following\n      parameters (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2691-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2. Peak picking and detrending\n        \n          SECAT provides the options to choose peak picking or detrending of the\n          peptide intensities when scoring interactions. Depending on how the\n          users data appears and their interactions of interest, different peak\n          picking and detrending options are recommended. Each panel contains\n          the recommended peak picking and detrending parameter, a description\n          of the peaks, and an example of the description from the sample data.\n        \nNote: Depending on the type of input data,\n      different peak picking and detrending options may improve analysis. The\n      recommendations provided are geared toward maximizing the number of PPI in\n      the sample SEC-SWATH-MS data. SWATH-MS and DIA data analyzed with programs\n      such as OpenSWATH (without “re-quantification”, such as optionally\n      conducted by tools such as TRIC or DIAlignR) generally produce single\n      clearly defined peaks and do not require any sort of peak picking or\n      detrending. DIA data analyzed with “re-quantification” or\n      match-between-runs (MBR) by programs such as Spectronaut or DIA-NN that\n      provide quantitative background DIA signals will often produce peaks with\n      long tails of low intensity. Such data can typically benefit from\n      detrending. In contrast, data with multiple undefined peaks will likely\n      benefit from peak picking and/or detrending.\n    \n      However, these recommendations may not hold true for all protein\n      interactions or co-fractionation methods. For users interested in specific\n      protein interactions, it is best to look at the elution profiles of the\n      proteins of interest to determine which type of profile is produced when\n      determining the peak picking method. Furthermore, other (untested)",
    "separation methods than SEC may provide different elution patterns, and we\n      recommend such users to test different peak picking and detrending options\n      to determine which is a best fit for their data. A simple benchmark that\n      users can utilize in their own optimization is to look at overall numbers\n      of recovered interactions or simply check whether their protein of\n      interest is recovered.\n    \n        Run the scoring step using the output SECAT file from the\n        data preprocessing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] step and select the necessary\n        parameters.\n        \n            Example code from sample data:\n            \n>secat score --in=hela_string.secat --threads=8\n            Required/Important Parameters:\n            \n--in PATH\nNote: [Required] Use the data\n              preprocessing out SECAT file as the input for this step.\n            \n--peakpicking [none | detrend_zero | detrend_drop |\n                  localmax_conditions | localmax_replicates]\nNote: The method for peak picking\n              of the peptide chromatograms: \"none\",\n              \"detrend_zero\", “detrend_drop\",\n              \"localmax_conditions\" or \"localmax_replicates\"\n              [default: none].

The positive and negative networks from\n      reference databases (or optionally derived from the target network) are",
    "used to train a classifier in a semi-supervised fashion over multiple\n      iterations by a gradient-boosting approach. This classifier is then used\n      to assign a confidence score to the interactions in the query space, and\n      then to estimate confidence scores for each interaction. While it is\n      recommended to use a target network along with positive and negative\n      networks for creating a classifier, these parameters are not required. The\n      impact of using all or some of these parameters is shown below (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). Analyses of poorly characterized systems often do not have reference\n      protein-interaction networks associated. In these cases, SECAT analysis\n      will be limited in modeling true interactions and the number of detected\n      interactions will be reduced accordingly.\n    \nNote: The initial input of networks in the\n      preprocessing steps will have varying results for the\n      scoring[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] and learning steps of the analysis. In\n      general, adding a net file will produce better recovery due to the higher\n      confidence in interactions, but will limit the discovery of novel\n      interactions. Using a well characterized model with posnet and negnet\n      files will improve the classifiers’ ability to distinguish between true\n      interactions and false positives, but this data is limited to\n      well-characterized model organisms.\n    \n        Run the learning step using the output SECAT file from the\n        scoring[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] step and select the necessary parameters.\n        \n            Example code from sample data:\n            \n>secat learn --in=hela_string.secat --threads=5\n            Required/Important Parameters:\n            \n--in PATH\nNote: [Required] Input SECAT file\n              from previous step.\n            \n--pi0_lambda <FLOAT FLOAT FLOAT>\nNote: To compute confidence scores\n              for each interaction, PyProphet needs to estimate the proportion\n              of truly absent interactions (pi0) that still result in a\n              partially overlapping signal using the lambda tuning function,\n              proposed by Storey & Tibshirani.35[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35] The\n              default start, end and step values for the lambda function are\n              defined as three parameters separated by an empty space.

For some scenarios, it might be useful to enforce\n                  a more conservative estimate of pi0 by setting a fixed value\n                  (e.g., 0.4) or by limiting the range of lambda (e.g., from\n                  0.01–0.1). For debugging purposes, but not production-level\n                  applications (e.g., to visualize the data using SECAT) the\n                  lambda function could also be set to an extremely low value\n                  (e.g., 0.01 or 1e-6), which result in a pi0 estimate close to\n                  1.0, thus assuming that almost all candidate PPIs result in\n                  false signals. A detailed description of the assumptions and\n                  considerations can be found in Fig. 3 of Storey &\n                  Tibshirani (2003).35[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35] For more details\n                  refer to problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] in\n                  troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\n                \nNote: Lower pi0_lambda values\n                  are more lenient.

Most often, the quantitative consistency or coverage\n                  of the dataset is not sufficient for SECAT.

This function could be useful if learning is not possible\n              on one dataset (e.g., if no reference interaction networks are\n              available for organism X, but a different dataset with similar\n              properties exists for organism Y).

This parameter\n              feeds into PyProphet [default: 0.8]. This parameter can scale with\n              the size of the input data. Cross-validation needs to subset\n              different portions of the data, and the larger the data set, the\n              smaller the required fraction of data. SECAT was optimized on 3\n              replicates for 2 conditions but increasing the number of\n              replicates and conditions will allow one to reduce the\n              cross-validation fraction to speed up the learning step and may\n              generate a more robust classifier.

Otherwise, the default is to save the output in the --in\n              PATH.\n            \n--paired / --no-paired\nNote: Whether replicates should be\n              paired (e.g., replicates 1 of conditions A & B were measured\n              with heavy and light SILAC labels as part of the same runs).\n              Paired replicates need to have the exact same “replicate_id”,\n              defined in the experimental design table [default: no-paired].\n              This parameter is useful in scenarios where a paired t-test should\n              be conducted instead of an independent t-test.\n            \n--min_abs_log2fx FLOAT\nNote: Minimum absolute log2\n              fold-change for integrated nodes. Interaction below the set log2fx\n              will be ignored [default: 1.0]. This value can be increased to\n              focus only on interactions that change dramatically between\n              conditions. It will make differences easier to spot but reduce\n              coverage.\n            \n--minimum_peptides INTEGER\nNote: Minimum number of peptides\n              required to quantify an interaction [default: 1]. SECAT uses a top",
    "N approach and increasing the minimum number of peptides will\n              remove many proteins from analysis. Typically, increasing this\n              parameter does not have many benefits.\n            \n--maximum_peptides INTEGER\nNote: Maximum number of peptides\n              used to quantify an interaction [default: 3]. Only the highest\n              intensity peptides will be chosen for each protein. Setting a\n              maximum number of peptides will remove less intense peptides that\n              may result in non-confident interactions.\n            \n--missing_peptides TEXT\nNote: Whether missing peptide\n              abundances should be set to 0 (\"zero\") or dropped\n              (\"drop\") for fold change computation [default: zero].\n              Setting the missing peptide abundances to zero will allow the\n              algorithm to assess changes even in the absence of measured\n              signal. It is recommended to set as zero to include these cases.\n            \n--peptide_log2fx / --no-peptide_log2fx\nNote: Whether peptide-level log2fx\n              should be computed instead of protein-level. Protein-level is more\n              robust if measured peptides are variable between conditions or\n              replicates [default: peptide_log2fx]. This option was added to\n              allow analysis of some legacy DDA data.\n            \n--threads INTEGER\nNote: Number of threads/CPU to use\n              for parallel processing. -1 means all available CPUs [default:\n              -1].\n            \n--help\nNote: Shows brief description of\n              parameters.\n            \n        Proceed to export the results in the next step to view the differential\n        interaction networks.\n      \nExport of results\nTiming: <1 min\n    \n      Exports tables of that are formatted for network creation using software\n      such as Cytoscape.
