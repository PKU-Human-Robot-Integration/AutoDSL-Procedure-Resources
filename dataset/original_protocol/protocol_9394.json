    "1. Preparation of Neurons\nDorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are grown on sterile (autoclaved) 12 mm glass coverslips in a 24-well culture plate.\nThe 10 mM stock of EdU (in DMSO, Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay Kit) is typically diluted 1:100 in culture medium to make a 10X EdU solution (100 μM) and then diluted 1:10 into the culture wells (e.g. 30 μL of the 10X EdU solution into a total of 300 μL of culture medium).  DRG neurons are incubated with a final concentration of 10 μM EdU at 37°C and 5% CO2 between 2-24 hours.  The length of time depends on how treatments affect the rate of mtDNA synthesis.\nIn a fume hood, DRG neurons are fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10-15 min at room temperature, washed twice in 1X PBS 2-5 minutes each wash and stored in fresh 1X PBS for up to 1 month at 4°C.\nCoverslips are transferred with fine-tipped forceps to a prepared humid chamber (Corning BioAssay dish with black papered bottom for contrast, wrapped in aluminum foil to protect light sensitive components and humidified with water saturated Kimwipes) and placed on a sheet of Parafilm M that provides a hydrophobic surface to confine the solutions to the coverslip.  The protocol below is designed for 28 coverslips and solutions are prepared for 32 coverslips (about 14% extra volume).  Solutions with expensive or limited components are made so that 75-80 μL are used on each coverslip.  Otherwise, 200-300 μL are used for wash and block solutions to thoroughly wash out previous solutions.\nRe-apply 1X PBS to cover the surface of each coverslip (200-300 μL).  Prepare the Click-iT assay and tyramide signal amplification kits as described below and in the manufacturer's instructions.\nPreparation of Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay Kit",
    "Most components from the Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay Kit come pre-made and are stored at 4°C [2x Click-iT Reaction Buffer (10x Component E), CuSO4 (100 mM, Component F), Click-iT EdU fixative (Component D) and Blocking Buffer (2x Component H)]. Click-iT EdU Buffer Additive (10x Component G) is stored at -20°C to prevent it from turning yellow-brown over time. This component tolerates repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\nThe Oregon Green 488 azide (Component B) should be divided into small aliquots (10-20 μL) to minimize freeze-thaw cycles and stored at -20°C.\nTo prepare a stock solution of the anti-Oregon Green HRP conjugate (Component I), add 75 μL of Milli Q dH2O to the vial.  Mix by gentle pipetting or by inversion to avoid foaming and store at 4°C.  Do not vortex.\nPreparation of TSA Kit #12, with HRP Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide Kit\nTo prepare the tyramide stock solution, dissolve the solid material (Alexa Fluor 488 tyramide, Component A) in 150 μL of DMSO (Component B). Invert the vial several times to dissolve any tyramide coating the sides of the vial. Store stock solution in small aliquots (10-20 μL) at ≤-20°C, desiccated and protected from light.\n2.  Click-iT 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) Labeling\nNOTE: All solutions are removed with a bulb transfer pipette with a 200 μL tip affixed to the end to gently remove liquids without losing cells.  Avoid using a vacuum line, which usually remove solutions too vigorously.  A bulb pipette is used to gently flood coverslips with 200-300 μL of wash solutions to thoroughly wash out the previous solution.\nCells are permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 in 1X PBS solution for 10 minutes at room temperature in a covered humid chamber. Use 1% Triton-X-100 stock solutions.",
    "Make 3000 μL of 0.1% Triton-X-100 by adding 300 μL 1% Triton-X-100 stock to 2700μL 1X PBS.\nUse 75-80 μL per coverslip.\nRemove the Triton X-100 solution and rinse twice with 1X PBS.\nEndogenous peroxidase activity is quenched by a 1% H2O2 in 1X PBS solution for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Dilute 30% H2O2 solution with 1X PBS. This solution should be made fresh but can be made during the 10 minute permeabilization step above (step 3.1).\n          \nMake 3000 μL of a 1% H2O2 by adding 100 μL 30% H2O2 to 2900 μL 1X PBS.\nUse 75-80 μL per coverslip.\nRemove the peroxidase solution and rinse twice with 1X PBS.\nClick-iT EdU Reaction\n          \nFor 32 coverslips (32 x 80 μL = 2560 μL) a total of 2560 μL is needed.  The 2x reaction is made in 1280 μL, which is half of the total volume of the reaction.\nFreshly prepare the Click-iT Reaction Cocktail prior to starting the 5 minute post fix (step 3.5 below).\nMix the cocktail by pipetting up and down. Do not vortex when making this reaction. \ntable:\n﻿0,1\n2 x Reaction Cocktail  Components are from Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay Kit,Half Volume: 1280 μL\nMilli Q dH2O,1132.8 μL\n2x Click-iT Reaction Buffer (10x Component E),100.3 μL\nClick-iT EdU Buffer Additive (10x Component G),25.6 μL\n\"CuSO4 (100 mM, Component F)\",25.6 μL\nOregon Green Azide (Component A),6.4 μL\nTotal,1290.7 μL\n                    NOTE: The volumes used above are proportional to the volumes listed in the Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay kit directions.  The final volume of Reaction Cocktail is slightly more than 1280 μL.\nThe 2X Click-iT reaction is diluted with equal volume of Click-iT EdU fixative (Component D) right before use.  Mixing these together makes a uniform reaction solution for all coverslips.",
    "Add 1290.7 μL Click-iT EdU fixative (Component D) to the 1290.7 μL reaction cocktail.  Use 75-80 μL per coverslip.\nPost-fix the neurons with Click-iT EdU fixative (Component D) for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nRemove fix and add reaction cocktail from above (step 3.4). Cover to protect from light and incubate for 25 minutes at room temperature.  Gently remove the Reaction Cocktail.  Wash twice with diluted 1X Blocking Buffer (2X Component H).\n          \nMake 5200 μL of 1X Blocking Buffer by diluting 2600 μL Blocking Buffer (2x Component H) with an equal volume of MilliQ d H2O (2600 μL).  Use 75-80 μL per coverslip.\nUnder an epi-fluorescent microscope, check for Oregon Green staining in nuclei of mitotically active control cells.\n3.  Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) of EdU Signal\nAdd 1% TSA block solution to each coverslip and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.\n          \nMake 6000 μL of 1% TSA block solution by weighing 0.06 g of TSA Blocking Reagent (TSA kit #12, Component D) and adding it to 6000 μL 1X PBS.  Vortex to mix.  Addition of 5% goat serum in the 1% TSA block solution will often help to reduce non-specific binding.\nBriefly spin the anti-Oregon Green horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibody stock (Component I of the Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay), prepared 2-24 hours in advance of TSA.  Dilute the primary antibody 1:300 in 1% TSA blocking solution and invert or pipette up and down gently to mix.  Do not vortex to avoid disrupting the HRP-conjugated antibody.  Remove 1% TSA block solution, add 75 μL to each coverslip and incubate overnight at 4°C.",
    "The antibody can be used more concentrated, such as 1:150, but it is supplied in limited amounts, so use it sparingly.  Again, addition of 5% goat serum in the 1% TSA block solution will often help to reduce non-specific binding of the anti-Oregon Green horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibody.\nMake 2560 μL of a 1:300 antibody solution by adding 8.53 μL of the stock Rabbit anti-Oregon Green-HRP (Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay) to 2560 μL 1% TSA Blocking.  Mix by gentle pipetting or inversion.\nThe next day, remove the antibody solution and rinse three times with 1X PBS.  Incubate the coverslips in the final wash for an additional 30-60 minutes at room temperature to ensure that unbound primary antibody is removed.\nPrepare Tyramide reaction for 2560 μL (32 coverslips x 80 μL).\n          \nMake 400 μL of a 0.15% H2O2 solution (100X) by adding 2 μL of the 30 % H2O2 (TSA kit #12, Component F) to 398 μL Amplification Buffer (TSA kit #12, Component E).  This should be made right before needed.\nFor a final volume of 2560 μL combine:\n                    \n25.6 μL Tyramide-488 (TSA kit Component A)\n2508.8 μL Amplification Buffer (TSA kit Component E)\n25.6 μL 0.15% H2O2 (from above for a final 0.0015% H2O2)\nRemove 1X PBS and incubate with the Tyramide reaction for 15 minutes at room temperature.\nRemove Tyramide reaction and rinse three times with 1X PBS, incubating in the final wash for 30-60 minutes at room temperature as before.\nCheck for mtDNA labeling under an epi-fluorescent microscope.\n          \nMount coverslips on glass microscope slides with an antifade mounting medium, such as ProLong Gold with DAPI.  Alternatively, the EdU labeling and amplification can be followed by standard fluorescent immunocytochemistry to label other cellular markers.\n4.  Representative Results:  Visualization of Mitochondrial DNA Replication as a Marker for Mitochondrial Biogenesis",
    "We are interested in how sensory neurons (Figure 1) regulate the number of mitochondria.  This protocol will label newly synthesized mtDNA with a fluorescent marker as a way of measuring new mitochondria.  The incorporation of the synthetic nucleotide EdU followed by the click chemistry of the Oregon Green-azide and subsequent amplification with the Alexa-Fluor 488 tyramide results in the labeling of mtDNA with a green fluorescent signal (Figure 2).  If done correctly, the amplified green signal is sufficiently higher than background fluorescence (such as cellular autofluorescence or a side-effect of the HRP-TSA reaction).\nThis technique is designed to label newly replicated mtDNA in order to visualize and quantify mtDNA biogenesis within subcellular compartments of neurons (Figure 3).  The EdU labeling allows for subsequent fluorescent immunocytochemistry to label other cellular markers such as neurofilament (Figure 3D).\nThe TSA reaction can also be done with other fluorescent Alexa Fluor tyramides such as Alexa Fluor 594-tyramide.  This results in a green fluorescent nuclear signal from the Oregon Green-azide click reaction in the nucleus but no green signal in mtDNA, which is undetectable prior to TSA.  The amplification with Alexa Fluor 594-tyramide intensifies the nuclear label and reveals the incorporated EdU in mtDNA with a red fluorescent signal (Figure 4).  A similar amplification procedure is used to visualize BrdU incorporation into newly synthesized mtDNA (Figure 5), however, this method requires an additional step to recover the BrdU epitope by either a harsh acid (HCl) or enzyme digest, which is not necessary for EdU labeling.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2147/2147fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Figure 2. Schematic diagram representing the procedure for labeling EdU in mtDNA with a green fluorescent signal. The schematic represents the three-step protocol for labeling EdU in mtDNA with a green fluorescent signal.  Mitotically active F11 neuroblastoma cells serve as a positive control and illustrate the labeling pattern of EdU that was incorporated in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.  The first step (P1) is to incorporate a thymidine analog into newly synthesized mtDNA by incubating cells in the presence of EdU.  The second step (P2) is based on click chemistry to label incorporated EdU with an Oregon Green-azide.  Green signal is visible in nuclei of cells that replicated their nuclear DNA. The final step (P3) is to amplify the Oregon Green-azide signal by incubating with a HRP-conjugated rabbit antibody against Oregon Green followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 labeled tyramide in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to visualize green signal in mtDNA.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2147/2147fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Finally, the signal is amplified with a green or red fluorescently labeled tyramide in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to visualize signal in mtDNA."
