    "Introduction to the Novel GFS Configuration",
    "The GFS consists of several essential components: A regular light microscope, an equatorial mount, a camera, and a computer [Figure 1]. The sealed flow-cell chamber which holds the sample is also indispensible according to the GFS design. The Light microscope is mounted onto the equatorial mount so the scope can be rotated into different orientations in space. This ability allows the static vector of gravity to be exploited so that the samples can be dynamically oriented in relation to the vector so the force of gravity can impart piconewton-range force loads to the samples. The camera replaces the light microscope's ocular lens so it can record changes in the orientation of the sample. This raw data is digitized and manipulated by the computer to interpret the data into actual force and distance measurements. The sealed flow-chamber is designed to allow all degrees of freedom in space without sample loss. In the chamber resides the sample molecule which is tethered near one terminus to an \"anchored\" bead that is glued to the surface of the chamber. The opposite terminus is tethered to a \"mobile\" bead that is free from the surface of the chamber. It is this mobile bead, free in the assay buffer that can be acted upon by gravitational force thereby stretching the tethered molecule at such low force loads [Figure 2]. The sample simply looks like a pair of microspheres under the microscope, although it does take some experience to discern good usable pairs coupled by their attachment to a molecule from pairs where both beads are sitting on the surface of the flow-chamber. One modification to the system is the addition of a floating platform which holds the GFS and is suspended by springs.",
    "In this configuration, once the sample has been rotated into a position where gravitational force can act on the sample, the platform and all its components can be dropped against the spring constant. Near free-fall, the force acting on the mobile bead is close to zero and at the springs' maximum extension, the gravitational force is multiplied by as much as two times. In this way, a graded force/distance response can be graphed to measure the behavior of a single molecule at different force loads.",
    "1. Microsphere Preparation\nSubmerge about 10 mg of glass or silica beads in 0.04% 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (cut with acetone) for two minutes.\nRinse with two changes of double distilled water and centrifuge to pellet at 2000 X G for 5 minutes. Discard supernatant.\nAdd 5  mL of coupling buffer (0.01 M pyridine cut with double distilled water and adjust pH to 6.0), and shake this mixture vigorously.  Centrifuge as described above.  Repeat this step three times.\nTo wet cake of beads, add 2 mL of 5% gluteraldehyde solution (cut gluteraldehyde with coupling buffer). Shake vigorously.\nUnder a hood, rotate bead/gluteraldehyde mixture for 3 hours at room temperature.\nCentrifuge as above and aspirate the supernatant.\nWash the beads in 5 mL of coupling buffer by shaking them vigorously and centrifuge and aspirate the supernatant.  Repeat this three more times.\nAdd about 15 μL of the desired antibody to beads and shake vigorously.  The beads should be rotated for 16-24 hours.\nUnder the hood, add 5 mL of 1 M glycine quenching solution (cut glycine with double distilled water and adjust pH to 7.0).  Shake this mixture vigorously and rotate for 30 minutes.\nCentrifuge and aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL of wash buffer (0.01 M Tris, pH 7.0; 0.1% sodium azide; 0.1% BSA; 0.15 M NaCl; and 0.001 M EDTA).  Shake this vigorously, centrifuge and aspirate the supernatant. Repeat this step three additional times.\nChange buffer to low-salt buffer (0.1 M KCl; 0.02 M imidazole; 5 mM MgCl2; adjust to pH 7.0).  Repeat three times.\n2. Sample Attachment to Microspheres",
    "Take a small amount of prepared beads (about 2 μL from each cake of beads however, if there is a large discrepancy in diameter between batches, it is advantageous to use around an 8:1 ratio of large to small beads) and add them to a microcentrifuge tube with assay buffer.  Reduce the concentration of your protein to around 5 μM, using the assay buffer. Prepare at least a total volume of 400 μL including the buffer, the protein, and the beads.\nRotate this mixture at around 1 RPM for 3 hours (if the protein is agitated too much, it will aggregate and become useless).\n3. Slide Chamber Preparation\nCoat a thick microscope slide with 0.01% nitrocellulose (in amyl acetate).  Let this slide dry for about 10 minutes.\nWith a sharp glass cutter, cut cover slide so as to make a chamber.  This requires four strips of glass.\nUse the factory edge of the glass and rake it across a smear of vacuum grease on both sides of the edge.\nPress grease coated strips onto dried nitrocellulose covered slide to create a box on the surface of the slide.\nPipette about 2 μL of bead/protein mixture by tapping pipetter onto surface of glass inside the box.\nAdd about 20-400 μL of low salt buffer depending on how large the chamber is.\nPress a cover slip on top of the box which is already coated with vacuum grease to finish   the sealed and buffered chamber.\nLet slide sit on a level place so the beads have ample time to anchor themselves to the nitrocellulose.\n4. GFS Data Acquisition\nMount slide onto GFS stage\nMonitor what the GFS camera is recording and search for legitimate \"bead pairs,\" in which the small microsphere is attached near the equator of the large microsphere.",
    "When a potential bead pair is found, go through the depth of focus to determine if the \"mobile\" bead is not resting on the surface of the slide.\nOnce a suitable pair is identified, note angle mobile bead is away from dmax (dmax = the maximum distance between the centroids of the coupled microspheres). Move the scope into position to acquire video.\nThe angle of travel of the GFS should be sufficient to record dmin, dmax, and dmin which might call for 25-90 degrees depending on the length of the molecule.\nRECORD as the pair travels from dmin to dmax and back to dmin.\nIt is a good idea to also shoot a movie of the background so it can be subtracted later for analysis.\nIf performing a GFS drop, move the scope back to dmax and record the drop at at least 60 frames per second.  The critical part is the first oscillation, but long record times can also be used for dynamic study.\n5. GFS Data Analysis\nTransform raw video into digitally \"thresholded\" image and run macro in imageJ to determine the centroid position of each bead in every frame of video.  This is also for the drop video.\nDump the X,Y and area data from ImageJ into Excel and plot the points.\nIf a proper bead pair was acquired by video, a noticeable hump in the graph is indicative of the beads being at their closest (dmin) and at the apex of the graph is the position of dmax.\nUsing this data, the radius of each bead should be determined precisely in ImageJ and all this information is put into the nested equation:\nd = [(g sin α)2 + (g cos α + dmax - g)2]0.5",
    "g = [dmin2 + rb 2 - (ra + rb)2]0.5 = rb sin β\nc = dmax - ra - g\n(d = distance between centroids; g = force of gravity; α = the angle in degrees parallel to the objective lens; rb = radius of mobile bead; ra = radius of anchored bead; β = angle of attachment off the axis of the equator of the anchored bead.\nUsing the fitted radius of the mobile bead which also yields its volume, and given the density of the bead, the force the mobile bead imparts on the molecule can be calculated in piconewtons after the buoyancy of the solvent is subtracted.  This method measures the force on the tethered molecule in piconewtons and calculates the absolute molecule length between antibody attachments in nanometers. F = V (d-b) a (F = force, V = volume, d = density of the glass microsphere, a = acceleration due to gravity, b = the density of the displaced water).  \n6. Representative Results:\nIf the bead prep is done correctly, there will be minimum bead aggregation although there may still be an occasional bead clump.  When viewed through the scope, there should be a reasonable distribution of beads whether paired or not in the chamber.\nIt is important to minimize vibrations as much as possible; to do this either an air table, special shock absorbing feet for a tripod that holds an EQ mount, or on the system that utilizes springs can be used for vibration isolation.",
    "Another useful tip concerning the sealed flow chamber is to let it stand for about five minutes on a level table after it has been fully constructed.  This allows any unattached larger beads to float down through the buffer and rest in the layer of nitrocellulose.  If the slide were instead mounted directly upon completion, the investigator would continually have to deal with beads literally flying through the field of view; and if this happens during video acquisition it can corrupt the experiment.  If this is done properly, bead flight is significantly minimized and cleaner video results.\nWhen a potential bead pair is identified by the GFS operator, it is useful to put it through a preliminary rotation to monitor the behavior of the pair.  Rarely, the large bead is not firmly affixed to the slide.  If this happens, there is no use in utilizing the pair because it is critical that the larger anchored bead stay in a fixed position through the duration of the acquisition.  If the pair is stable and does not exhibit \"anchored bead roll,\" then it is suitable for experimentation.",
    "A plot of bead separation distances versus change in angle relative to gravity can be used to evaluate the acquired data.  A good representative result would show little separation on a plateau and as the mobile bead frees itself from the anchored bead because of the influence of gravity, the graph will show more separation.  This continues until a nice peak is reached which is called dmax and the curve starts downward again returning to the baseline dmin [Figure 1].  In ideal conditions, this signature is symmetrical.  A non-representative result would show a graph with incoherent patterns showing no distinct dmin-dmax-dmin pattern; or it would show separations that are orders of magnitude too high for a single molecule indicating maybe there was a piece of dust between the beads, or maybe that the mobile bead was simply not attached at all.  The process of finding the pair, shooting it, processing it, and analyzing it has many stop gaps where improper bead pairs are culled out.  So, if you get to the end of the entire process and you have a molecule length that is consistent with previous results, one can be very confident that the original bead pair is representative and can be included in the results.  On a good day, about half of the bead pairs shot can be taken through to become a legitimate data point.  For instance, the length of the coiled coil of myosin between MF20 and MF30 antibodies, is known based on EM data and AFM, data to approach 100 nm 2,7,8,9.  If the result is several times this length, the sample has aggregated.",
    "The results presented here are from standard GFS rotation experiments and demonstrate a distance of 96 nm ± 5 nm,  [Figure 2] which agrees closely with the measurements of the MF30 (which binds at the N-terminus of myosin subfragment-2) and MF20 (which binds in the light meromyosin) antibody separation distance on myosin deduced from the literature values [Figure 3].",
