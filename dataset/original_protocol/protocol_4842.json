    "In vitro transcription of 5-bromo-UTP (BrUTP)-incorporated RNA probesNote: DNA template such as pBluescript vector encoding the target sequences should be made linear DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (Figure 2). Preparation of DNA template such as plasmids, PCR-generated or synthetic oligonucleotides.In vitro transcription reaction:20 ng-1 μg DNA template 2 μl 10x transcription buffer2 μl 50 mM ATP solution2 μl 50 mM GTP solution2 μl 50 mM CTP solution1 μl 50 mM UTP solution1 μl 50 mM 5-bromo-UTP (BrUTP) solution0.5 μl RNase inhibitor 2 μl T7 RNA polymeraseX μl RNase free ddH2O (up to total 20 μl)Mix by pipetting, and centrifuge.Incubate for 2 h at 42 °C.Add 10-20 U DNase to 20 μl total solution to digest any DNA. After mixing, incubate for 1-2 h at 37 °C.The RNA probes are purified using Trizol following standard protocol.Optional: If you want to confirm the size of RNA transcripts, agarose gel electrophoresis of RNA in formaldehyde will be performed following standard protocol.  Conjugation of anti-BrdU antibodies with protein G beadsWash protein G agarose beads three times with an equal volume of nuclease-free PBS (centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C).Apply 100 μl of the solution (50% beads made up with PBS) to 1.5 ml new microcentrifuge tubes. Add 500 μl of bead wash buffer to each tube.Add 50 μl of anti-BrUTP m Ab to each tube.Incubate the tubes while rotating for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The sample can be incubated at 4 °C overnight.Wash antibody-conjugated beads once with 1 ml of bead wash buffer (centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C).Discard the supernatants carefully.Binding of BrUTP-labeled RNA to antibody-conjugated beadsResuspend the antibody-conjugated beads with 500 μl of bead wash buffer.",
    "Add 50 pmol of prepared BrUTP-labeled RNA (prepared in step A), and RNase inhibitor.Incubate while rotating for 2 to 3 h at 4 °C.Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.Discard supernatant and wash BrUTP labeled RNA bound to the antibody-conjugated beads with 500 μl of bead wash buffer (centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C) (To step E).Pre-clearing the protein extraction Optional: Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extract can be separated using NE-PER Nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents. Protein extracts were prepared from at least 1.0 x 108 cells.The preparation of the protein extractsCollect the cultured cells into a 1.5 ml new microcentrifuge tube (if dissociation is necessary, Trypsin-EDTA solution can be used).Centrifuge the tube at 2,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatants carefully.Transfer 1 ml lysis buffer into the tube with cell pellet, and resuspend the cells on ice.Put the tube on ice for 10 min.Centrifuge the tube at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant (protein extract) carefully into a 1.5 ml new microcentrifuge tube.Store 50 μl protein extract as input.The preparation of protein G beadsWash 50 μl protein G agarose beads three times with an equal volume of nuclease-free PBS (centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C). Discard supernatant gently.Apply 100 μl of the solution (50% beads made up with PBS) to 1.5 ml new microcentrifuge tubes (50 μl beads per sample).Add 500 μl of bead wash buffer to each tube.Centrifuge the tubes at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant carefully.The mixture of the protein extract and 50% bead solutionTransfer the protein extract into the tube with protein G beads.Incubate the tube while rotating for 1 h at 4 °C.",
    "Binding of proteins to BrUTP-labeled RNA-conjugated beadsCentrifuge the sample tubes containing the protein extract and protein G agarose beads at 2,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C (save 10 μl of the protein extract as an input).Transfer the protein extract (optional: either purified cytoplasmic or nuclear protein extract) into the tubes prepared in step C.Incubate with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C.Purification of the binding proteins to RNA-conjugated beadsAfter incubation, centrifuge the samples at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant carefully.The protein-RNA complex on the beads is washed three to four times with 1 ml RNA-binding buffer. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Elution of proteins binding to BrUTP-labeled RNA-conjugated beadsResuspend the beads in 200 μl of nuclease-free PBS and transfer the slurry to a bottom-plugged spin column.Detach the bottom plug from the spin column, and then put the column into a new centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the column at 1,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C.Attach the bottom plug to the spin column, and put the column into a new centrifuge tube. Add 50 μl of elution buffer into the column.Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking.Detach the bottom plug from the spin column, and put the column into a new centrifuge tube.Elute the protein-BrUTP-labeled RNA complexes by centrifugation. For enrichment of purified proteins, repeat elution steps G3-6, and collect the eluates into a new tube.Detection of RNA-binding proteins by LC/MS/MSThe eluted samples are subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by CBB staining.Cut the gel on the several compartments, in which some bands were detected.The samples cut are eluted, and then analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Target RNA-binding proteins are confirmed by Western blotting (After step G)."
