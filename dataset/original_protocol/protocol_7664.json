  "procedures": [
    "Summary:• Nine week-old male Balb/c mice are sensitized on days 0 and 7 by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 50 μg ovalbumin adsorbed with 2 mg aluminium hydroxide (alum) in saline.• Mice are challenged on days 18, 19, 20 and 21 by intranasal (i.n.) instillations of 10 μg ovalbumin in saline; control animals receive i.n. instillations of saline alone; i.n. administrations must be carried out under anesthesia (ketamine and xylazine diluted in sterile saline, see Recipes).• Assessments are performed 18-24 h after the last i.n. challenge.Allergen sensitizationFreshly prepare a suspension containing 0.5 mg/ml of ovalbumin (see Recipes) and 20 mg/ml of alum in sterile saline (0.9% NaCl): Weigh 80 mg alum in a 5 ml tube, add 1 ml from a 2 mg/ml ovalbumin aliquot, and 3 ml of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl).Gently homogenize the suspension in a rotator for 4 h at 4 °C so that ovalbumin may adsorb on alum. The mixture appears as a white suspension, susceptible to rapidly settle down to the bottom of the tube. It should be homogenized by rapid reversals (3-4) of the tube/syringe just before use.Before use, bring suspension to room temperature (18-25 °C) on the rotator.Hold the mouse in your hand by the dorsal skin so that its head is up and its rear legs are down. Maintain its tail with fingers.Use \"1 ml\" syringes and \"25 G\" needles to inject i.p. 100 μl suspension per mouse. Note: Gently homogenize the suspension by 3-4 repeated reversals of the tube/syringe between each use so that the suspension does not drop at the bottom of the tube/syringe).Allergen challengeBefore use, bring solutions (anaesthetics, 0.4 mg/ml ovalbumin aliquot (1 aliquot per 24 mice), and saline) to room temperature (18-25 °C). Vortex for 4 sec at the highest speed to mix.",
    "Hold the mouse in your hand by the dorsal skin so that its head is up and its rear legs are down. Maintain its tail with fingers.Use \"1 ml\" syringes and \"25 G\" needles to inject i.p. 100 μl per mouse (25 g) of the anesthetic solution (at room temperature).Wait until the mouse is anesthetized; check that vibrissae do not move any more.Hold the mouse in your hand so that its head is up and its rear legs are down. Administer 12.5 μl of the 0.4 mg/ml ovalbumin solution in each nostril for sensitized mice, and saline alone for control mice, by use of sterile tips (note: Solution must be  administered drop by drop, slowly and very carefully).Keep the mouse in your hand in a vertical position at least for 1 min, and check that the mouse breathes normally.Note: If the mouse does not breathe normally, perform a thorax massage by pressing the rib cage several times, quickly but carefully.Place the mouse in decubitus on a heated blanket until complete recovery."
