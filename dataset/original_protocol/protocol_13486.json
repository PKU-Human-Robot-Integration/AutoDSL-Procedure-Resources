  "procedures": [
    "Following ethical approval (N045/2021), male and female C57BL/6 mice neonates were observed until 9 days old. The animals were born and provided for experimental purposes by the animal facility of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. The neonates were housed in a cage together with their parent animals. The environmental conditions were controlled in temperature (20-24 °C), 12:12 h light-dark cycle, and relative humidity of 40%-70%.\n1. Experimental preparation\nPrepare the required equipment for surgical operation, including scissors, forceps, etc. (see Table of Materials).\nPlace disinfected and autoclaved instruments on a sterile surface next to the operation table.\nEuthanize a P9-aged neonatal mouse quickly by decapitation with an operating scissor. Place the body of the euthanized neonatal mouse on a sterile operation field. Dissect the EBDSs in 9-day-old mouse neonates (step 5).\n\t​NOTE: The described dissection procedure gives any scientist the proper tools to remove the EBDS from neonatal and older mice. The older the mouse, the easier the preparation.\n2. Access to the peritoneal cavity\nGrasp the skin above the location of the urinary bladder with forceps. Incise a 2 mm diameter hole into the skin using scissors, without damaging the peritoneum and underlying structures. Expand the cut to the location of the decapitation, following the left front axillar line. Remove the skin from the left to the right side with the atraumatic forceps.\nTake hold of the peritoneum surrounding the spleen. Gently lift it up until the peritoneum resembles a tent-like structure and cut a 1 mm diameter hole in the center. Wait for the \"peritoneal tent\" to fill up with air. Use a 10x microscopic magnification for this and the following steps.",
    "Cut off the peritoneum in a window framed by the lower ribs, both lateral abdominal regions, and the lower bladder area to ensure full access to the liver, bile duct system, stomach, small intestines, and colon.\n\t​NOTE: To improve access to the liver, an additional incision can be performed, removing the three lowest ribs while leaving the xiphoid process, falciform ligament, liver, and bile duct structures intact. The view of the liver is easy to obtain.\n3. Examination of the gall bladder and bile ducts\nNOTE: Ensure to keep the sample wet on a regular basis during all of the following steps.\nCarefully pull the xiphoid process in a cranioventral position to examine the gall bladder.\n\tNOTE: The tension on the falciform ligament increases with this motion, and the attached gall bladder becomes visible.\n\t\nPerform only a slight pull to avoid uncontrollable tearing of the falciform ligament, which could lead to the gall bladder tearing from the bile duct system. Release the pull of the xiphoid process before the next step.\nGently pull down the duodenum to free the bile duct system.\n\t​NOTE: As the tension on the hepatoduodenal ligament increases, the bile duct tissue becomes visible.\n4. En-bloc-resection\nPerform the lower en-bloc-mobilization following the steps below.\n\t\nIdentify the duodenal papilla, which connects the bile duct system to the duodenum.\nCut through the duodenum about 2 cm from to the right lateral side of the papilla.\nCut through the pyloric area. Ensure that the stomach contents are present in the pyloric area between the cutting location and the duodenal papilla.\n\t\tNOTE: This is an important step for later security of orientation for the correct location of oral and aboral duodenal parts.\nPerform the upper en-bloc-mobilization.\n\t\nGently pull the xiphoid process and get access to the falciform ligament.",
    "Perform a 1 cm long cut through the falciform ligament, as close as possible to the xiphoid process, between the gall bladder and the xiphoid process. Ensure not to damage the gall bladder.\nCut through the following connecting structures between the liver and the thorax: esophagus, inferior vena cava, thoracic aorta, all ligaments that surround the bare area of the liver, and all dorsally remaining tissue connections.\n\t\t​NOTE: The en-bloc sample is completely dissected. It contains the liver, bile duct system, and the duodenal corpus, which is connected with the pyloric region of the stomach.\n5. Final gall bladder and bile duct dissection\nPerform the gross preparation following the steps below.\n\t\nPlace the en-bloc sample on a foam pad usually used for dehydration. Use a 20x microscopic magnification and two microsurgical atraumatic forceps with a maximum tip size of 6 mm for this and the following steps.\nAssemble the sample on the foam pad. Reorganize the sample in the correct anatomical position. Flatten the oral and aboral part of the duodenum, performing a gentle movement.\nStart the movement at the duodenal papilla and continue to the cutting edges using atraumatic forceps. Smooth out the white pulpy contents of the stomach, which will only occur in the oral part of the duodenum. Ensure to identify the oral and the aboral part of the duodenum to rule out probable bile duct rotation.\nCut away large remnants of hepatic tissue to begin dissection of the bile duct.\nPerform the final isolation.\n\t\nGently press the remaining hepatic tissue into the pores of the foam mat. Ensure that the scraping movements start from the bile duct system and lead to the liver boundaries.",
    "Transfer the sample to a cleaner position on the foam mat after a few scraping movements in various directions. Use the advantage of less squeezed liver tissue in the background to optimize the view for the best possible differentiation between EBDS and unwanted cells. Scrape the hepatic tissue from the bile duct until nothing, or as little as possible, of the hepatic tissue remains.\nProcess the hepatoduodenal ligament until the isolated EBDS remains. Remove intraligamentous blood vessels like the hepatic artery, portal vein, and small remnants. Remove this delicate filament, with a gentle pull and high care, to the left lateral side. This dissection step might have already started unintentionally or partly completed during the prior removal of hepatic tissue, which in the end leads to the same result.\n\t\tNOTE: The blood vessels are emerging as a white and very delicate filament approximately 3-5 mm orally of the duodenal papilla and join the hepatoduodenal ligament from the left lateral side, accumulating with the bile duct to the glissonian triad. With the completion of this step, the final sample is completely isolated. If there is a need for a record, images can be captured after organizing the bile duct structures into their anatomical position (Figure 1). Doing the last preparation steps on a foam mat is recommended because the sample will not stick as much to the surface of the operation field. If the pores are wet, the bile duct levitates or floats. When moving the sample, it will not stick as firmly as it would with preparation on the operation cloth, resulting in no ripping while moving the sample.\n6. Preparation for histological analysis\nPut the isolated sample in a buffered solution, special medium, or formalin-containing fixatives (see Table of Materials) as soon as possible after the dissection.",
    "Chose a suitable storage solution depending on further planned processing steps.\n\tCAUTION: Use formalin-containing fixatives only under an air vent because of acute toxicity, corrosivity, and diverse health hazards.\n\tNOTE: In the presented study, the EBDS samples have been inserted in paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. They have been stored at room temperature and cooled down prior to sectioning. In a warming cabinet, 2 µm slices were kept overnight and stained using conventional hematoxylin and eosin4 (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
