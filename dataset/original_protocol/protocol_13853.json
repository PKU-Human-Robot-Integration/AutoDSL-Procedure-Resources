  "procedures": [
    "The experiments were performed on female C57BL/6 mice, age 10-12 weeks and 20-25 g body weight. All animal procedures complied with the standards stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy of Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA) and were approved by the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Preparation and intubation\nAutoclave all surgical instruments before surgery. If multiple surgeries are to be performed in one session, clean the instruments after each animal and re-sterilize using a hot bead sterilizer.\nAnesthetize the mice with 3.5-4% isoflurane at 1 L/min O2 in an induction chamber.\nAdminister Buprenorphine SR 1 mg/kg (analgesic) subcutaneously, weigh the animal, and input the weight into the ventilator.\nShave the left side of the chest from the sternum to the level of the shoulder and apply depilatory cream to remove excess fur.\nFor the ischemia reperfusion procedure maintain the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator at 2 cmH2O. For the delayed injection of cells procedure change the PEEP to 3 cmH2O to prevent lung collapse.\nIntubate the animal using a 20 G endotracheal tube, transfer to a controlled heating pad to maintain a body temperature of 35-37 °C.\nPlace the mouse on a ventilator in lateral recumbency with cranial end on the left and caudal end on the right.\nMaintain anesthesia at 2-2.5% isoflurane at 1 L/min O2 for the remainder of the procedure.\nScrub the surgical area alternating between povidone-iodine and alcohol swabs three times and apply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes.\n2. Ischemia reperfusion injury\nUsing a #10 blade scalpel make a vertical incision 2.5 mm to right of the leftmost nipple in the field of view.",
    "Using scissors cut through the superficial muscle layers until the intercostal muscles and ribs are visible.\nWhile lifting the ribs and surrounding tissue, cut through the intercostal space between the 4th and 5th ribs, then insert the eyelid retractor into the open space.\nRetract the pericardium using curved forceps, moving the lung upwards and out of view.\nVisualize LAD artery and, using a 9-0 nylon suture, pass through the myocardium beneath the artery 2.5 mm distal to the left auricle and tie a loose square knot.\nCut 1 cm of polyethylene tubing and place it within the loose knot.\nSecure the suture around the tubing, confirm ischemia, then release after 35 min.\n\tNOTE: Confirm ischemia by pallor and ventricular arrhythmia.\nAfter releasing the ligation and removing the tubing, wait for 5 min to confirm reperfusion of the myocardium.\nPlace a 24 G I.V. catheter tube into the thoracic cavity one intercostal space to right of the opening.\nClose the intercostal incision with a 6-0 absorbable suture in a simple interrupted pattern.\nClose the muscle layer with a 6-0 absorbable suture in a continuous suture pattern.\nAfter closing the superficial muscle layer, remove the chest tube while withdrawing the air from thoracic cavity using a 1 mL tuberculin syringe.\nClose the skin incision with a 6-0 absorbable suture in a continuous horizontal mattress pattern\n\tNOTE: Nylon sutures and a discontinuous suture pattern may also be used for the skin layer.\nAdminister 1.5 mL of warm saline subcutaneously and apply triple-antibiotic ointment to the incision site to prevent infection.\nTurn off isoflurane and allow the animal to breathe through the ventilator on 100% O2 until it can breathe continuously without aid.",
    "Transfer the mouse to a bedding-free cage or a cage with covered bedding (paper towel or drape) on a warm pad with a temperature of 35-37 °C until fully recovered.\n3. Mouse mesenchymal stem cell delivery\nNOTE: The strain of mice used for the procedure are an inbred line and are deemed genetically identical. The mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from animals of the same strain and, by protocol design, immunosuppression was not induced1.\nComplete the preparation and intubation steps as done previously for the first procedure.\nRemove the suture from the skin layer using scissors and forceps.\nWith a #10 scalpel, make an incision in the same location as the previous surgery.\nContinue to use the scalpel to cut through scar tissue until muscle layer suture is visible\nUsing the scissors and forceps remove the suture and cut the muscle layer open.\nVisualize and remove the sutures holding the ribs together and continue cutting through the intercostal muscle from the previous incision.\n\tNOTE: The lungs may have adhered to the chest wall, if this occurs, use blunt or curved forceps to carefully separate and release them.\nPlace the eyelid retractor into the intercostal space and locate the area of the previous ligation.\nLoad the mesenchymal stem cells (3.0 x 105), suspended in 20 µL PBS, into a 30 G insulin syringe, bend the needle slightly as needed for the proper angle to inject.",
    "NOTE: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from the adipose tissue of 4-6-week-old C56BL/6 mice. Early passage cells (p3) were transduced with a vector expressing the firefly luciferase gene under the CMV promoter to allow in vivo cell viability monitoring. Adipose-derived mouse MSC were characterized by flow cytometry and the cells were positive for CD44, CD29, CD90 and CD105 but negative for the hematopoietic marker CD4514. Prior to the injection, MSCs were cultured for at least one passage to avoid the loss of cells from the thawing process.\nMoving in the direction from the apex towards the base of the heart insert the syringe into the peri-infarct region until the needle opening is completely inside the myocardium.\nOnce inside slowly inject the cells into the myocardium, wait 3 s, then remove the needle.\nObserve the heart closely for 3 min to be sure of no abnormal reactions to the cells such as ventricular fibrillation.\nPlace a 24 G IV catheter tube into the thoracic cavity one intercostal space to right of the opening.\nClose the intercostal, muscle, and skin layers and remove the chest tube in the same method as the first procedure.\nAdminister 1.5 mL of warm saline subcutaneously and apply triple-antibiotic ointment to the incision site to prevent infection.\nTurn off isoflurane and allow animal to breathe through the ventilator on 100% O2 until it is able to breathe continuously without aid.\nTransfer the mouse to a bedding-free cage or a cage with covered bedding (paper towel or drape) on a warm pad with a temperature of 35-37 °C until fully recovered.\n4. Post-operative care following both procedures\nObserve the animal continuously until spontaneous breathing, sternal recumbency and normal movement is established.\nContinue observation every 15-30 min for at least 3 h on the day of the surgery.",
    "Check the mice for wound dehiscence or abnormal pain once daily for 5 days, then 2-3 times weekly.\nIf the animal shows signs of pain (i.e. arched back, minimal movement, grimacing, or scruffy fur) after 72 h post-op, provide an additional dose of the Buprenorphine SR analgesic.\nSubscription Required.
