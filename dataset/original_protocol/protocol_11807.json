    "1. Prepare Animals, Tools, and Media for Dissection\nCross male and female flies to obtain progeny of the desired genotype. Useful transgenic markers for identification and staging of meiotic spermatocytes include GFP-tubulin to label the meiotic spindle and RFP-histone 2A to label chromsomes8. Use five to ten females per cross and maintain crosses on standard fly food in vials in a 25 °C incubator until third instar larvae begin crawling up the sides of the vial (4–5 days). Early white pupae will begin forming one day later.\nObtain two pairs of straight forceps with fine tips. Ensure that the tips are sharp, even in length, and straight (Figure 1A). Use these forceps only for dissections, and cap with 10 μL pipette tips when not in use.\nPrepare a scalpel tool.\nInsert the blunt end of a black anodized steel insect pin into a pin holder, and twist the screw of the holder to secure the pin in place. Using a pair of forceps and under a dissecting microscope, grasp the insect pin in the middle and bend it to form an internal angle of 135° (Figure 1B). The sharp end is for cutting tissue, while the edge is used for transferring testes between drops of media.\nCap with a 1,000 μL pipette tip when not in use.\nWorking in a tissue culture hood, prepare 5 mL aliquots of Schneider’s media and store at 4 °C until the time of use. When ready to begin dissections, warm one 5 mL media aliquot to room temperature. Then transfer the warmed dissection media to a 10 mL syringe and attach a 0.22 µm syringe filter.\n2. Dissection of Testes from Larvae and Early Pupae",
    "Use the media filled filter syringe to expel three drops of media (50 µL each) at the top, middle and bottom of a glass slide.\nUse a dissecting probe to transfer five to ten third instar larvae or early pupae (pupae that are still white or yellow) to the top drop. Gently agitate the larvae and pupae in the media with the dissecting probe to remove any food or debris.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, turn a single larva or pupa on its side with a dissecting probe to identify the two bilateral testes if present, which appear as oval shaped translucent structures in the posterior third of the body (Figure 2A, B). Animals that lack testes are female and should be discarded.\nWhen a male larva or pupa is found and is clean, move it to the second drop of media. Repeat until 3 or 4 male larvae and/or pupae have been transferred to the second drop of media.\nWorking in the second drop of media, grasp a single male larva or pupa with a pair of forceps at its mid-region, just anterior to the testes. Use the second pair of forceps to gently tear the animal in half.\nHold the posterior end of the larva or pupa down on the glass slide with a pair of forceps. Starting just next to the forceps, push down on the cuticle using the edge of the scalpel tool and move the scalpel toward the cut end of the animal. This will expel the animal’s internal organs, which include the guts, fat bodies, and testes.\nGently tease apart the testes from the rest of the organs. The testes are clear, oval shaped organs embedded in ribbons of fat body (Figure 2C).",
    "Transfer the testes one at a time to the third drop of media. To accomplish this, insert the edge of the scalpel under the fat body, lift the tissue out of the media, and quickly move it to the third drop.\nAlternatively, if there is not enough fat body still attached to the testes to successfully lift the tissue, gently transfer the tissue using a glass Pasteur pipette that has been pre-wetted with dissection media.\nUse the sharp end of the scalpel tool to gently slice away excess fat body from the testes, leaving just a small rim of fat body around the edges (Figure 2C). It is not necessary to remove all of the fat body, and attempting to do so will likely result in damaging or rupturing of the testes.\nRepeat the above steps for all of the male larvae on the glass slide.\nProceed either to step 3 or step 5.\n3. Mounting Testes for Live Microscopic Imaging\nNOTE: This mounting procedure was adapted from a recently published protocol for imaging of Drosophila larval brain neuroblasts20. Additional details can be found in this reference.\nUse the filter syringe to deposit a single drop of Schneider’s media (about 30 µL) onto the center of a 50 mm gas-permeable culture dish.\nUse a pre-wetted Pasteur pipette to transfer the prepared testes to the drop on the gas-permeable dish. The testes will generally float to the surface of the drop.\nUse the scalpel tool to gently push the testes down onto the gas-permeable membrane. Take care not to rupture the gas-permeable membrane with the sharp point of the scalpel. Push all of the testes to the center of the drop.",
    "Use a 1 mL syringe filled with halocarbon oil to make four drops of oil, about 30 μL each, on the gas permeable membrane. Space the drops of oil around the drop of media containing the testes to correspond to the four corners of a 22 mm glass coverslip.\nLine up the corners of a 22 mm glass coverslip with the four drops of halocarbon oil and gently lower the coverslip onto the media and oil. Allow the coverslip to settle and for the media containing the testes to spread between the drops of oil.\nRemove excess media to allow the coverslip to settle onto the surface of the testes. While observing the testes under a dissecting microscope, insert the corner of a delicate task wipe into the media under the coverslip to wick away a small amount of liquid. Wick away enough media until the glass coverslip just makes contact with the surface of the largest testis. It is critical not to remove too much media and lower the coverslip too far, as this will exert pressure on the testes and cause them to rupture (see Figure 5).\n4. Live Imaging of Meiotic Spermatocytes\nNOTE: Spermatocytes can be imaged using a laser scanning or spinning disk confocal microscope. The system must have adequate speed and sensitivity to avoid photobleaching of fluorescent proteins or photodamage of the tissue.\nPlace a drop of immersion oil on the glass coverslip just above the testes. Flip over the dish and place it on the microscope stage and move the microscope objective (40x or 60x) into the oil until it is just below the testes. Use transmitted light to find a single testis and bring it into focus.",
    "While capturing fast images with the confocal, move the testis around to examine the organization of the cells. One end of the testis will have many small, densely packed cells. This end contains the germline stem cells and spermatogonia. Moving toward the other end of the organ, identify progressively larger cells organized into discrete clusters or cysts. These large cells are the spermatocytes (Figure 3A).\nIf imaging GFP-tubulin, identify spermatocytes that will commence meiosis within 30–60 min by the presence of two bright microtubule asters (i.e., centrosomes) located at the cortex of the cell (Figure 3B, C).\nOnce a cyst of meiotic spermatocytes has been identified, set up acquisition parameters to capture z-stacks of images over time. Typically, acquisition of 15–20 images spaced 1.5 μm apart in the z-dimension is sufficient to capture the full volume of several spermatocytes within the same cyst.\nAcquire full z-stacks every 2 min if imaging the entire first meiotic division, which takes about 1.5 hours. It is possible to use faster acquisition rates, particularly if only a specific event of meiosis is to be analyzed. However, take care not to cause photobleaching or photodamage due to repeated exposure of the sample to laser excitation.\nUse a continuous, automatic focus control system to prevent focal drift over the long time-course of acquisition. Temperature control of the sample on the microscope stage generally is not necessary, assuming room temperature of approximately 22–23 °C. If temperature control is available, maintain the sample at 25 °C on the microscope stage.\nIf meiotic spermatocytes are not found, store the sample for several hours or overnight in a 25 °C incubator and image again.\n5. Fixation and Immunostaining",
    "From step 2.10 above, use a glass Pasteur pipette to transfer testes to a well in a 9-well glass dissecting dish containing 0.5 mL of 8% paraformaldehyde in PBSTx (phosphate buffered saline with 0.3% Triton X-100). Ensure that the testes are laying on the bottom of the dish.\nNOTE: Paraformaldehyde is toxic and should be handled with gloves in a fume hood.\nFix the testes for 20 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the testes to a well containing 0.5 mL PBSTx. Wash for 5 min with gentle agitation. Repeat the wash step in new wells with fresh PBSTx two more times.\nDilute primary antibody to the desired concentration in 0.5 mL PBSTx containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Transfer testes from the 9-well glass dissecting dish to the tube of diluted primary antibody and incubate overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking or nutation.\nWash the testes in 0.5 mL of PBSTx for 5 min in a well of a 9-well glass dissecting dish. Repeat the wash step with fresh PBSTx two more times.\nDilute secondary antibody in 250 μL of PBSTx containing 5% BSA and dispense into a clean well of a 9-well glass dissecting dish. If desired, add DAPI to stain DNA. Transfer testes to the well containing secondary antibody, cover with plastic wrap, and incubate in the dark with gentle agitation for 4 hours at room temperature.\nTransfer the testes to a clean well filled with 0.5 mL of PBSTx. Wash with fresh PBSTx twice for 5 min and a third time for 30 min.\n6. Mounting Fixed Testes",
    "Transfer the testes from the last wash onto a glass microscopy slide using a Pasteur pipette. If necessary, use the edge of the scalpel tool to push the testes down onto the surface of the slide.\nUse the corner of a delicate task wipe to wick away excess liquid from the testes. Remove as much liquid as possible.\nApply a 30–50 µL drop of microscopy mounting medium to the testes.\nPlace a 22 mm coverslip onto the drop of mounting medium and allow the coverslip to settle and the mounting medium to spread under the coverslip. Apply gentle pressure to the coverslip if necessary to squeeze out excess mounting medium and allow the coverslip to rest on the surface of the testes.\nUse nail polish to seal the edges of the coverslip.\nSubscription Required.
