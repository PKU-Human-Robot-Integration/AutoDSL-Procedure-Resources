    "This protocol describes differentiation of PSCs into TE-like cells. Once the PSC are ready, it requires 5 days to make TE-like cells. This section is partially abstracted from Horii et al. (2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0017]), which originally referred to the resulting cells as “CTB-like,” and expanded upon to provide a clear description of this protocol (see Background Information section below for details on the new designation of these as “TE-like” cells). Successful completion of this protocol will result in TE-like cells with a “cobblestone” morphology and over 80% EGFR positivity by flow cytometry.\nMaterials\nPSC line(s)\n               \nNOTE: We have used both hESC (including WA01/H1, WA09/H9) and several of our own iPSC lines (derived from human dermal fibroblast or human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells) in this protocol. Prior to differentiation, cells should be adapted to StemFlex media (ThermoFisher) or mTeSR Plus (STEMCELL Technologies), following the manufacturer's protocol.\nStemFlex medium (ThermoFisher, cat. no. A3349401)\nEDTA, 0.5 mM (see recipe)\nTrypLE express (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 12604021)\nY27632 (see recipe)\nPBS, without calcium and magnesium (Corning, cat. no. 21-040-CV, or equivalent)\nKnockout serum replacement (KSR) (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 10828-028)\nTrophoblast induction medium (see recipe and Table 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-tbl-0008])\nGeltrex coated 6-well tissue culture plates (see Support Protocol)\n5-ml Serological pipettes\n10-ml Serological pipettes\n25-ml Serological pipettes\n15-ml Conical tubes\n50-ml Conical tubes\nHemocytometer or automated cell counter\nCentrifuge (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 75004261 or equivalent)\nCell culture incubator\nFlow cytometer and additional materials for cell staining and analysis as described in Horii et al, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0017]",
    "1. Use newly prepared Geltrex coated tissue culture plates (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0006]). Culture PSCs in StemFlex until sub-confluent (∼80%). Cells are recommended to be passaged by clump passaging using a gentle dissociation buffer such as 0.5 mM EDTA every 2 to 3 days to expand the cells. Passaging details can also be found in Horii et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0017].\nNOTE: It is essential to have good starting material. Ideal passage number for the use of ESC and iPSC are passage numbers below 50 for ESC, and passage number below 20 for iPSC. If ESC or iPSC are not growing well, consider thawing a new vial, or changing to new batches of StemFlex or Geltrex. For PSC medium, other regularly used medium (i.e., StemPro, E8, or mTeSR Plus) will also work for this protocol. We have found passaging at split ratios between 1:6 and 1:9 for H9 ESC, and 1:3 for our iPSC works well; however, splitting ratio varies between cell lines, so we recommend optimizing the split ratio beforehand.\n2. On day -1, seed cells into a new Geltrex-coated 6-well plate (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0006]). Pre-warm new Geltrex-coated plate (either a freshly-made or stored plate) at 37°C for at least 30 min. Aspirate the medium from sub-confluent well of PSCs and add 1 ml of room temperature TrypLE express for 3 min at 37°C to dissociate to single cells. Harvest cells, placing them in a conical tube. Wash wells with 2 to 5 ml of warm StemFlex media to collect as many cells as possible. Centrifuge 5 min at 200 × g, room temperature to pellet the PSC. Re-suspend and count the PSC.",
    "3. Remove Geltrex from the well and seed 60,000 cells per well in StemFlex with 5 μM Y27632. Shake the plate gently by hand to spread the cells, allowing them to attach evenly on the plate (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0002]).\nNOTE: 60,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate is optimal for WA09/H9 ESC. However, seeding density will need to be optimized for each ESC/iPSC line. For our iPSC, we plate 100,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate. At these seeding densities, cells could grow up to roughly 1 million per well of a 6-well plate by day 4 of TE induction. It is very important to plate the cells sparsely at the beginning of the TE induction. If the PSC colonies are too big at the start, the center of the colony will not differentiate well. This is one reason to dissociate the cells using TrypLE express instead of EDTA. Daily cell culture work for TE induction should be done during a similar time in the day to ensure collection of samples and media changes are done every 24 hr. For subsequent conversion to TSC (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0002]), you will need around 500,000 cells/well of a 6-well plate.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/78725899-c490-42f4-9b25-fbff31c96dae/cpz1875-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

(2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0017]). Following the 4-day induction with BMP4+IWP2, cells were re-plated in feeder-conditioned media with 10 ng/ml BMP4. (F) Representative flow cytometric analysis of EGFR/HLA-G double staining before and after differentiation using the protocol from Horii et al. (2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0017]). EVT differentiation resulted in (at most) 30% HLA-G positive cells from this protocol.\n4. On day 0, check that the cells have attached evenly and formed small and sparse colonies (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0002]). If the PSC morphology and density look good, change medium to Trophoblast Induction medium (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0002]). Change the medium every day for 4 days. Cells will gradually acquire an epithelial (cobblestone-like) morphology (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0002]).",
    "5. On day 4, check cell surface EGFR expression using the flow cytometer. Using one well from the differentiation, remove the media and wash the cells with 1 ml of PBS. Aspirate PBS and add 1 ml of TrypLE express. Incubate at 37°C for 3 min. Add 1 ml of 10% Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) in PBS onto the wells containing the TrypLE express, then wash the well and collect the cells in the TrypLE Express/10% KSR in PBS mixture in a 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge 5 min at 200 × g, room temperature. Stain cells for EGFR expression following previously published protocol described in Horii et. al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0017].\nNOTE: Without the KSR, the cells will not form a dense pellet and there is a higher risk to lose the cells during aspiration of the supernatant.\n6. If flow cytometric analysis shows over 80% of cells are EGFR+, proceed to the re-plating step in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0002]. If the proportion of EGFR+ cells is less than 80%, change the medium on the remaining cells with Trophoblast Induction Medium and let the induction proceed for another day prior to measuring surface EGFR expression again by flow cytometry.\n7. At the end of this step, successful induction should result in over 80% of the cells positive for surface EGFR expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0002]). Terminal differentiation of the TE-like cells generated by this protocol, previously referred to as CTB-like cells, using feeder-conditioned medium plus 10 ng/ml BMP4, as previously described by Horii et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0017], resulted in differentiation into mostly STB, with a small proportion (around 30%) of HLA-G+ EVT (Fig. 2E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0002], F). EVT differentiation is significantly improved by adaptation to PSC-TSC (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0002]) and subsequent use of Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0005].",
    "This protocol describes conversion of PSC-derived TE-like cells to TSC (PSC-TSC). Once the PSC-derived TE-like cells are confirmed to be over 80% EGFR positive by flow cytometry, proceed to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0002] to re-plate the TE-like cells onto Collagen IV-coated plate. Collagen IV-coated plates could be prepared on day 3 of the Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0001].

Aspirate media from the well containing PSC-derived TE from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0001] and add 1 ml TrypLE express to dissociate the cells to single cells. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 3 min.\n3. Without removing TrypLE express, add 2 to 3 ml PBS to the well using a 5 ml pipette and collect the cells into a conical tube.\n4. Centrifuge 5 min at 200 × g, room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend in iCTB complete medium to make a cell suspension of 250,000 cells per ml.\nNOTE: If the cells do not form a dense pellet, add KSR for a final concentration of 10% to the cell suspension and centrifuge again.",
    "5. Remove collagen IV from the well and wash once with PBS. Seed 500,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate, for a total volume of 2 ml per well. Agitate the plate to have the cells spread and attach evenly on the plate.\nNOTE: Up to 1 million TE-like cells are generated in one well of a 6-well plate at the end of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0001]. If there are 4 wells of a 6-well plate at the end of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0001], we recommend coating 4 to 6 wells of a 6-well plate with collagen IV.\n6. Change iCTB medium every other day until the cells are confluent.",
    "This protocol describes how to passage PSC-derived TSC. This step is essential to establish self-renewing PSC-TSC, and terminal trophoblast differentiation. Once the PSC-derived TE-like cells are replated onto a collagen IV-coated plate, EGFR expression level by flow cytometry will diminish during the first couple of passages. If completed successfully, EGFR expression will be regained and be expressed by over 90% of the cells by passage 5. This protocol typically takes up to 2 to 3 weeks to complete and will establish self-renewing PSC-TSC.\nMaterials\nPBS, without calcium and magnesium (Corning, cat. no. 21-040-CV, or equivalent)\nTrypLE express (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 12604021)\niCTB complete medium (see recipe and Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-tbl-0005])\nCollagen IV-coated plate (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0007])\n5-ml Serological pipettes\n10-ml Serological pipettes\n25-ml Serological pipettes\n15-ml Conical tubes\n50-ml Conical tubes\nHemocytometer or automated cell counter\nCentrifuge (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 75004261 or equivalent)\nCell culture incubator\n1.

We recommend preparing enough wells to passage at a 1:3 split ratio. Therefore, for 1 well of PSC derived TSC, prepare 3 wells with collagen IV).\n2. When the cells are 80% confluent, passage the cells at a 1:3 split ratio.\nNOTE: Split ratio varies between the cell lines, so optimizing the split ratio beforehand is recommended. We typically use a 1:2 to 1:4 split ratio among different ESC- and iPSC-derived TSC lines.\n3. Aspirate iCTB medium and add 1 ml of TrypLE express per well of a 6-well plate. Incubate at 37°C for 10 to 15 min.\n4. Collect cells in 15 ml conical tube using PBS or iCTB basal medium.\n5. Centrifuge 5 min at 200 × g, room temperature.",
    "6. Aspirate the supernatant and then re-suspend cells in appropriate volume of iCTB complete medium for a split ratio of 1:3.\n7. Aspirate collagen IV from the wells that are intended for plating and wash wells once with PBS.\n8. Plate cells with appropriate split ratio in 2 ml medium for each well. Agitate the plate to allow the cells to spread out and attach evenly.\n9. Passage cells every 2 to 3 days, or when 80% confluent.\n10. Following 4 to 5 passages in this media (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0003]), the cells should be over 90% EGFR+ when examined by flow cytometry (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0003]). At this point, cells can be frozen down. After thawing, PSC-TSC can be passaged and differentiated in a lineage-specific manner into either STB or EVT.",
    "NOTE: It takes about 1 week to prepare the cells for the initial TE induction (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0001]) and an additional 2 to 3 weeks to complete the TSC derivation (Basic Protocols 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0003]). During the adaptation phase into iCTB media, a drop in EGFR cell surface expression has been observed and is expected (as low as 10% EGFR+ cells). Over a few passages, cells will re-acquire EGFR expression as their morphology becomes more similar to primary TSC (Soncin et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0037]). Conversion time to PSC-TSC varies between cell lines and is usually completed by passage 8 for most cell lines. After establishing PSC-derived TSC, cells can be passaged multiple times (we have successfully maintained them for up to 20 passages). Similar to primary TSC, it is important to passage PSC-derived TSC at sub-confluency (<80% confluency), rather than over-confluent, to avoid differentiation and acquisition of cell surface HLA-G. However, once a high proportion of cells acquire over 20% HLA-G, it is difficult to recover cells to the TSC stage (EGFR+, HLA-G-). In this case, thawing earlier passage cells or re-derivation of PSC-TSC is recommended.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/24d882a3-6fd3-44ac-8580-90ca3666132a/cpz1875-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\n(A) An illustration of TSC conversion from trophectoderm (TE)-like cells in iCTB medium.

    "This protocol describes STB differentiation from PSC-derived TSC. Correct confluency (∼30%) of PSC-TSC on day 0 is essential for successful STB differentiation. If the cells are under- or over-confluent, they will detach from the plate before differentiation is complete. It will take around 8 days to complete the protocol (days -1 to day 6). If successful, resulting cells at day 6 of the protocol will exhibit STB-associated function, such as hCG secretion. Cellular assays such as ELISA for hCG and cell-cell fusion assays can be conducted on day 6. An example of positive results is shown in Figure 4C and D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0004].

Day -1: prior to differentiation, check the cells by flow cytometry to ensure the PSC-TSC population is over 80% EGFR+ and less than 20% HLA-G+.\n3. Day -1: for STB differentiation, plate PSC-TSC at a density of 100,000 to 150,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate. Using PSC-TSC from Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0003], roughly 300,000 cells are expected from one well of a 6-well plate.\n4.

    "NOTE: Due to differences in growth rate, it may be required to optimize the seeding density of PSC-TSC to achieve 30% confluence at day 0. Alternatively, if the cells are less than 30%, wait until the PSC-TSC reach 30% of confluence before switching to STB differentiation media. This will avoid significant cell death throughout the differentiation and will perform better cell-cell fusion.\n11. On day 3, change medium using freshly prepared STB differentiation medium (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0004]).\n12.

If completed successfully, cells should be over 60% positive for EVT marker, HLA-G, at the end of day 6. This assay is also described in our previous publications (Horii et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0016]; Horii et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0018]; Soncin et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0037]).\nMaterials\nPBS, without calcium and magnesium (Corning, cat. no. 21-040-CV, or equivalent)\nTrypLE express (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 12604021)\niCTB complete medium (see recipe and Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-tbl-0005])\nEVT differentiation medium-I (see recipe and Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-tbl-0002])\nEVT differentiation medium-II (see recipe and Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-tbl-0003])\nFibronectin-coated plate (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0008])\n5-ml Serological pipettes\n10-ml Serological pipettes\n25-ml Serological pipettes\n15-ml Conical tubes\n50-ml Conical tubes\nHemocytometer or automated cell counter\nCentrifuge (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 75004261 or equivalent)\nCell culture incubator\n1. Prepare plates coated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin in PBS (see Support Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0008]).\n2. Day -1 or 0: prior to differentiation, check the cells by flow cytometry to ensure the PSC-TSC population is over 80% EGFR+ and less than 20% HLA-G+.\n3. Day 0: for EVT differentiation, plate cells at a density of 200,000 to 250,000 cells per well of 6-well plate. We expect to obtain about 300,000 PSC-TSC per confluent well of a 6-well plate at the end of Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-prot-0003].\n4. Thaw Matrigel on ice. Once Matrigel is thawed, prepare EVT differentiation medium-Ⅰ (see recipe) and allow medium to reach room temperature before use.\n5. Aspirate iCTB medium, then add 1 ml of TrypLE express. Incubate at 37°C for 10 to 15 min.",
    "6. Collect cells in 15 ml conical tube using PBS or iCTB basal medium. Count the cells.\n7. Centrifuge 5 min at 200 × g, room temperature.\n8. Aspirate supernatant, then re-suspend cells in EVT differentiation medium-Ⅰ.\n9. Aspirate fibronectin solution from wells and wash with 1 ml of PBS per well.\n10. Aspirate PBS and plate 200,000 to 250,000 cells in 2 ml of EVT differentiation medium-Ⅰ for each well of a 6-well plate.\n11. On day 3, prepare EVT differentiation medium-II, and change medium (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0005], B).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6a9f9176-a690-4a3b-99d3-ff47e9b3b3d9/cpz1875-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\n(A) Representative bright phase images (20×) of daily morphologic changes during EVT differentiation. Scale bar: 200 μm. (B) An illustration of the modified EVT differentiation protocol starting with PSC-TSC. Changes in matrices and media are noted and highlighted with different colors. Arrowheads correspond to time-points requiring media change. (C) Representative flow cytometric data prior (day 0) and after (day 6) EVT differentiation modified from Okae et al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-bib-0032]). Over 90% of PSC-TSC express EGFR and only a very small percentage (∼5% in this example) express HLA-G. After EVT differentiation, over 80% of PSC-EVT are positive for surface expression of HLA-G. Differentiation of EVT from PSC-TSC has a significantly better yield of HLA-G+ EVT than our previous two-step trophoblast differentiation protocol (compare to Fig. 2F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0002]).\n12. On day 6, collect cells for further analysis (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.875#cpz1875-fig-0005]).",
