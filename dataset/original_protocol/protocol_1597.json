As identification of slices with fluorescently labeled neurons one by one is tedious under the high-magnification objective of the experimental setup, we recommend the following procedure:\nArrange all slices in a holding chamber that you than place under an upright widefield epifluorescence microscope with a low magnification and a large working distance. Use white light for a first inspection (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) and, then, illumination with a blue laser or a halogen lamp, equipped with a GFP filter set consisting of a 470 nm bandpass filter for the excitation light, a 505 nm beam splitter and a 510 nm longpass filter for the emitted fluorescence, to detect the SF-iGluSnFR fluorescence (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Select slices which show fluorescence in the target region (CA1 or CA3).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1161-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Preselection of brain slices\n(A) Widefield image under white light illumination of the slice holding chamber containing all hippocampal slices from a mouse 20 days after virus injection.\n(B) Image of the same slices as shown in (A) for excitation with a mercury lamp and a GFP filter set. Scale bars: 5 mm.\nCritical: The aCSF in the slice holding chamber needs to be bubbled constantly with carbogen. During the selection process, however, it may be necessary to briefly interrupt the gas flow for a better view of the slices. Keep such interruptions as brief as possible.\nCritical: To avoid bleaching of the fluorescent glutamate sensor and phototoxicity, use minimal levels of fluorescence excitation light levels and short exposure times.",
    "Gently collect one of the selected slices with a Pasteur’s pipette and transfer it to the experiment chamber. Secure the slice position in the chamber, for example, with a flattened platinum wire frame with a nylon fiber grid (Edwards et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nKeep the remaining slices at room temperature in aCSF bubbled continuously with carbogen. A slice at a time can be collected for imaging for up to 8 h without any obvious decrease of recording quality.\nPopulation glutamate imaging\nTiming: 2–3 h per brain slice, up to four brain slices per day\nGlutamate imaging of SF-iGluSnFR-expressing neurons works similarly well with single- or two-photon imaging. For two-photon population imaging (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5C), you can use any standard two-photon microscope which can achieve a high frame rate (see below). Set the excitation light wavelength to 920–940 nm and introduce a beam splitter (705 nm) into the light path to reflect the emitted light into the photomultiplier tube (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). For standard imaging recordings, we recommend using a long working-distance 40× water-immersion objective. Our microscope is equipped with a 12 kHz resonance scanner and a 80 MHz Ti:Sapphire laser.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1161-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The stimulation pipette is barely visible as a dark shadow under these conditions and is outlined for clarity (white lines). The dashed white rectangle indicates the ROI from which population glutamate transients can be recorded. Inset: Wide field image of a hippocampal slice expressing SF-iGluSnFR in CA1, imaged through a 20× water immersion objective.\n(F) Single-photon glutamate population signals of SF-iGluSnFR expressing dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons at increasing stimulation strengths.\nScale bars in (B and E), 50 μm, inset scale bar in (E), 20 μm. fEPSP: field excitatory postsynaptic potential, PMT: photo multiplier tube, ROI: region of interest, sCMOS: scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor, Stim: stimulation pipette.\nFor single-photon imaging (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D–5F), equip an upright microscope with a 488 nm laser or laser diode for excitation and a fast and sensitive camera with a bit-depth of at least 12-Bit (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). Introduce a 505 nm beam splitter into the light path to guide the excitation light onto the sample and a 520 nm longpass filter in front of the camera for the detection of the emitted light. For our recordings, we used a sCMOS ANDOR Zyla 4.2 camera mounted on an Olympus BW51WI scope. The microscope was either equipped with an inverted camera objective with a focal length of 50 mm or a 20× water immersion objective.",
    "In both cases, we recommend imaging frame rates of 30–100 Hz to ensure optimal sampling of the synaptically-evoked glutamate transients. The recording setup has to be equipped with a slice perfusion system mounted on a small stage and a micromanipulator for the positioning of the micropipette used for synaptic stimulation. If needed, a second manipulator for electrophysiological recordings can be added.\nPreparations\nMount the experiment chamber to the stage under the objective of the microscope, start perfusion with warmed (34°C), carbogen-saturated aCSF (0.5–2 ml/min). Illuminate the slice, for example with a white LED placed near the recording chamber and lower the water-immersion microscope objective into the aCSF. Adjust the focal plane until the slice surface becomes visible through the ocular of your microscope.\nLocate the CA1 region by using the outline of the hippocampal slice and densely packed neuronal somata in the stratum pyramidale as guiding structures.\nTurn on the single- or two-photon microscope. Inspect the SF-iGluSnFR expression level in the stratum radiatum under single- or two-photon excitation, respectively. Identify the region of interest with dense and homogenous expression of SF-iGluSnFR (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5E).\nCritical: For two-photon imaging, set the focal plane at least 50 μm below the slice surface, as superficial neurons may be damaged by the slicing procedure. In the widefield microscope, this is not necessary as you will also collect out-of-focus fluorescence from below and above your focal plane\nCritical: Try to keep the laser intensity low to prevent phototoxicity. Try to use a laser power below 15 mW (two-photon) and 1 mW (single-photon), when measured under the microscope’s objective.\nOptional: Acquire an image series along the z-axis (z-stack) for orientation during the analysis of the experiment.",
    "Use the micromanipulator to place a stimulation pipette filled with 2M NaCl solution below the objective. Carefully lower the pipette until it touches the slice surface (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Advance the pipette 50–100 μm below the slice surface with the tip in the stratum radiatum at a distance of 75–100 μm from the stratum pyramidale (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nOptional: The visualization of the stimulation pipette is facilitated by the addition of a fluorescent dye to the NaCl pipette solution. For example, if your system supports imaging at longer wavelengths (1040 nm and 561 nm for two- and single-photon imaging, respectively), you can add 5–20 μM Alexa 594 to the pipette solution. Alternatively, Alexa 488 (excited at 920 nm and 488 nm, respectively) can be used.\nCritical: Avoid any lateral movement of the pipette to prevent tissue damage.\nFor simultaneous recordings of fEPSPs, mount another pipette filled with 2M NaCl to the headstage of your extracellular amplifier connected to a second micromanipulator. Advance the pipette tip to a location 50–100 μm below the slice surface and 75–100 μm from the pyramidal layer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B), as described in step 7 for the stimulation pipette. Typically, the fEPSP electrode is placed 100–150 μm away from the stimulation pipette towards CA3. Place the reference electrode in the bath solution.\nCenter the field of view (FOV) to the area surrounding the tip of the fEPSP recording electrode (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5E). Adjust the focal plane to a depth of about 100–150 μm below the surface. We usually imaged a rectangular FOV with an edge length of about 60–120 μm.\nConnect the stimulation pipette and the ground electrode to a stimulus isolator.",
    "Deliver short pulses (80–100 μsec, 1 V) and monitor both the fluorescence changes in a region of interest covering the whole FOV and the electrophysiological responses. With this low level of stimulation strength (1 V), synaptically-evoked signals are generally not detectable.\nRepeat step 11 with increasing voltage levels (in increments of 3–5 V) until you can detect a population glutamate signal and a corresponding fEPSP (typically at stimulation strengths of 30–50 V, Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and 5F). The stimulation settings are optimal if single pulses can evoke robust glutamate transients and fEPSPs without population spikes (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1161-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Scale bars in (A and B), 5 μm, in (C), 20 μm.\nCritical: To avoid tissue damage, do not exceed a stimulation voltage of 60 V and don’t increase the pulse duration. If you have difficulties with this step, refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nImaging experiment\nRecord 10-20 image series of 3–4 sec with the stimulation pulse delivered after one second of baseline registration (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A–6C, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Ideally, stimuli should be delivered at least 10 s apart to minimize activity-dependent plastic changes of synaptic responses.\nNote: For simultaneous recordings of fEPSPs, it will be necessary to synchronize the electrophysiological recordings with the imaging. If your imaging system can record voltage traces, you can record the trigger and the fEPSP directly in your imaging software. Otherwise, you can create a voltage pulse in your imaging software which you record with the fEPSP and align the imaging and electrophysiology with the trigger signal.\nFor local drug application through a glass pipette, you can use a third micromanipulator or replace the fEPSP recording pipette with a similar pipette containing the desired drug (e.g., TTX, 5 μM). Connect a pressure application device to the drug application pipette. Place the pipette tip near the site of imaging, 50–100 μm below the slice surface.",
    "Record a series of sweeps under baseline conditions to make sure that the population glutamate signals remained stable.\nCarefully eject a small volume of the drug by applying increasing pressure under visual control until you see a small movement artifact from the ejected substance (typically 10–50 mbar). Readjust the focal plane to keep all previously imaged structures in the FOV. For troubleshooting of typical errors, refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]).\nRecord a series of sweeps during the drug application, then stop pressure application. Wait several minutes for the complete washout of the applied substances and record a third set of 10–20 sweeps.\nAfter the imaging experiment, retract all pipettes and remove the experiment chamber from the microscope table.\nOptional: After the completion of the optical recordings, the slice can be fixed in paraformaldehyde and used for additional anatomical and immunohistochemical analyses (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.
