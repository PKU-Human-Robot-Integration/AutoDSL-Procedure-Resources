    "Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient to use medical data and the operative video for education and scientific purposes. This research was performed in compliance with all institutional, national, and international guidelines for human welfare.\n1. Positioning and robot docking\nPosition the patient on a vacuum mattress in a supine French position. Lower the right arm alongside the body on an arm support and extend the left arm. Tilt the operating table 10-20° in anti-Trendelenburg and 5-10° to the right.\nAfter all safety procedures (hood, sterile glove, and sterile scrub) are ascertained, create a sterile exposition. Make a 2 mm incision in the left hypochondrium on the midclavicular line and create a pneumoperitoneum with CO2 to 15 mmHg by placing a Veress needle.\nInsert the robotic camera through a visiport 12 mm trocar in the right pararectal space just below the umbilicus and perform a diagnostic laparoscopy. Once diagnostic laparoscopy confirms no contraindication for surgery, place the remaining trocars as shown in Figure 2.\n\t\nPlace four 8 mm trocars above the umbilicus and introduce a 12 mm laparoscopic assistant trocar for the bedside surgeon on the right side of the umbilicus.\nEnsure that the bedside surgeon can reach the transection area for suctioning, compression, clipping, and stapling without difficulty. The distance between the four ventral trocars is approximately 8 cm.\nPlace the robot on the right side next to the patient and dock the arms to the four robotic trocars.\nEnsure that the first surgeon takes place at the robot console and the bedside surgeon between the patient's legs.\n2. Mobilization\nStart with the mobilization of the left lobe. Divide the round and falciform ligaments using the robotic cautery hook and vessel sealer.",
    "Then, continue the mobilization by dividing the left coronary and triangular ligaments using the robotic cautery hook and/or vessel sealer.\n\tNOTE: It is important not to injure the left hepatic vein and branches of the phrenic vein, often located nearby and draining into the left hepatic vein.\nOpen the triangular ligament using the robotic cautery hook and/or vessel sealer all the way toward the origin of the left hepatic vein. Dissection is completed until the origin of the left hepatic vein is reached.\nVisualize the lesser omentum by lifting the inferior aspect of the liver cranially. Dissect the lesser omentum using a vessel sealer.\n\t​NOTE: If an aberrant left hepatic artery is present, ligate using the robotic cautery hook and/or vessel sealer.\n3. Hilar dissection\nIdentify the proper and left hepatic artery in the hepatoduodenal ligament by lifting the liver cranially and moving the robotic camera to the hilum.\nDissect and isolate the left hepatic artery using both the robotic cautery hook and bipolar forceps (optional: Maryland bipolar forceps).\nAfter visualizing the left hepatic artery, identify and dissect the origin of the right hepatic artery to make sure it is preserved.\nThen, dissect and isolate the left portal vein carefully. Switch the view to ICG-fluorescence imaging to identify the exact localization and trajectory of the left bile duct with respect to the left portal vein.\n\t​NOTE: ICG was administered preoperatively in parallel to induction of general anesthesia prior to the start of the surgery.\n4. Cholecystectomy\nIdentify the cystic duct and artery.\nFirst, dissect and isolate the cystic duct and artery using the robotic cautery hook to achieve the critical view of safety, also known as the Calot's Triangle.",
    "Clip both cystic duct and artery using polymer locking clips. Place two clips proximally and one distally on the cystic duct. Place one clip proximally and one clip distally for the cystic artery.\nDivide the cystic duct and artery between the clips with robotic scissors.\nSecond, dissect the gallbladder circumferentially off the liver using a robotic cautery hook until the gallbladder is detached from the liver.\nPlace the resected gallbladder in an extraction bag and position it outside of the working field.\n5. Vascular transection\nPrepare a pringle loop by passing a vessel loop around the hepatoduodenal ligament. During this procedure, the pringle maneuver was not applied.\nPerform an intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) of the liver to confirm the localization, borders, and depth of the biliary cyst.\nSwitch the view to ICG-fluorescence imaging to confirm the trajectory of the right and left hepatic duct before heading to the arterial and venous hilar transection.\nFirst, clip the left hepatic artery carefully with polymer locking clips by placing two clips proximally and one distally.\nDivide the left hepatic artery between the clips with robotic scissors.\nPass a vessel loop around the left portal vein using the Maryland bipolar forceps to ensure isolation of the left portal vein with preservation of the segment 1 branch.\nThen, clip the left portal vein with polymer locking clips by placing two clips proximally and one distally.\nDivide the left portal vein between the clips with robotic scissors.\n\t​NOTE: The left hepatic bile duct is not divided during this phase of the procedure to ensure no injury to the right hepatic duct.\n6. Parenchymal transection",
    "Visualize the ischemia line on the liver surface. The ischemia line should overlap the Cantlie's line since the aim is to perform anatomical left hepatectomy. Mark the transection line following the ischemia line using a cautery hook.\nPerform the superficial part of the transection using a cautery hook until a depth of 1 cm parenchyma is reached. For the deeper parenchyma, use the vessel sealer, the cautery spatula, and Maryland bipolar forceps.\nControl intrahepatic vascular and biliary structures with the vessel sealer as well. Control any intrahepatic small bleeding using the cautery spatula or bipolar forceps. Now carefully identify the branch of the middle hepatic vein for preservation.\nTransect the parenchyma until the left hepatic vein is reached. Before completion of the parenchymal transection, move back to the hilum to focus on the left hepatic duct.\nSwitch the view to ICG-fluorescence imaging to confirm the exact trajectory, size, and localization of the left hepatic duct.\nDissect the left hepatic duct carefully using the Maryland bipolar forceps.\nAt last, clip the left hepatic duct with polymer locking clips by placing one clip proximally and one clip distally. Divide the left hepatic duct between the clips with robotic scissors. The procedure ends with the division of the left hepatic vein.\nPass a vessel loop around the remaining liver parenchyma and left hepatic vein for the hanging maneuver.\n\tNOTE: This allows retraction of the right lobe of the liver toward the right side and puts tension on the remaining liver parenchyma and left hepatic vein to be able to get a better vision and grip on the left hepatic vein.\nThen, divide the left hepatic vein using a laparoscopic stapler.",
    "After completion of the left hepatectomy, place the resected specimen in an extraction bag and take both the specimen and gallbladder out through a Pfannenstiel incision. No intra-abdominal drain was placed."
