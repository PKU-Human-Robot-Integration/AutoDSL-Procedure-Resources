    "In line with Swiss legal requirements, the protocol was approved by an academic committee and supervised by the cantonal and federal veterinary agencies (authorizations n° GE/165/16 and GE/100/18).\n1. Specific devices and animals\nCylinders\nMachine cylinders with lateral stabilizing tabs out of PEEK to have inner diameter of 5 mm, outer diameter of 8 mm and a height of 5 mm (Figure 1).\nMachine PEEK caps with a design allowing to clip precisely onto the top of the cylinder (thickness 1 mm).\nSterilize PEEK cylinders and caps by autoclaving before surgery.\nScrews\nUse self-drilling micro screws (made of commercial pure titanium (grade 5)) to fix the cylinders (1.2 mm in diameter, 4 mm in length). Sterilize by autoclaving before surgery.\nAnimals\nPurchase three-month-old New Zealand white rabbits (male or female), weighing ~2.5 kg each.\n\t\tNOTE: We obtained rabbits by breeding at the University of Geneva.\n2. Surgery\nSurgical tray \nKeep scalpels, scissors, two forceps, periosteal elevator, syringes (1, 2, 5, 50 mL), surgical motor, round surgical burs (0.8 mm diameter), needles, sterile saline, four cylinders, eight screws, and screwdriver ready.\nPreclinical treatment\nAcclimate the animals one week prior to surgery.\nProvide a prophylactic antibiotic daily (5–10 mg/kg by mouth (PO)) starting 2 h before surgery up to 3 days after surgery.\nAnesthesia and intubation\nSedate the animals by intramuscular (IM) injection of ketamine (25 mg/kg, 50 mg/mL, 0.5 mL/kg) + xylazin (3 mg/kg, 20 mg/mL, 0.15 mL/kg). Wait ~20 min for the animals to sleep\n\t\tdeeply (complete muscular atony).\n\t\tNOTE: This premedication will allow a simple, fast and painless intubation process. Deep analgesia and anesthesia is induced as described in step 2.3.8.\nPlace an intravenous (IV) cannula into the marginal vein from the ear and keep it closed until intubation is completed.",
    "NOTE: This IV line will serve to perfuse fentanyl and propofol for deep analgesia and anesthesia, respectively (see step 2.3.8).\nMaintain anesthesia by supplying 5% sevoflurane in pure oxygen until intubation is performed.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is necessary only if the animal shows signs of awakening (eye movements, muscular contractions).\nAnesthetize the trachea locally by spraying 10% lidocaine. Place the rabbit in prone position and maintain its head in vertical extension.\nSlide the first endotracheal tube of small diameter (2.5 mm) into the rabbit trachea until airflow can be heard in the tube. This will open the larynx and facilitate the insertion of the definitive tube.\nInsert a guide (intubation catheter) in the tube to fix the position of the tube into the trachea. Remove the small diameter tube and slide the definitive endotracheal tube (4.9 mm) on the guide.\nRemove the guide and inflate the balloon at the end of the endotracheal tube to seal and block the device into the trachea. The tube will stay in place but it may be secured by using a lace tied around the forehead.  Immediately ventilate (7 mL/kg, frequency of 40/min) the animal with 3% sevoflurane in pure oxygen.\nContinuously perfuse (ear vein) fentanyl (0.01 mg/mL, 2–4 mL/h) to induce analgesia, 2–4 mg/kg of (2%) propofol (20 mg/mL, 4–8 mL/h) to induce anesthesia, and 4 mL/kg/h of Ringer's acetate to maintain iso-volumetric conditions.\nPlace a rectal temperature probe. Also monitor heart function, temperature and oxygen saturation during the entire process.\nControl the depth of anesthesia by monitoring autonomous breathing; if the animal shows signs of autonomous breathing, dispense a small bolus of propofol and fentanyl.\nSite preparation\nPlace the rabbit on a heated pad (39 °C) covered by a mattress pad (to avoid burns) on the surgery table. Shave the scalp.",
    "Apply a lubricating gel on the eyes to avoid irritation and dryness. Disinfect the site by scrubbing the skin with povidone iodine (10%). Then drape the rabbit with a sterile surgical drape and cut out an access area for the skull.\nDisinfect the surgical site with povidone iodine (10%) for a second time. Apply a lubricating gel on the eyes to avoid irritation and dryness.\nPrepare a draped table (sterile drape) on which to place the complete surgical tray.\nSurgical site opening\nAnesthetize locally with a subcutaneous (SC) injection of lidocaine 2% (1 mL) on the skull.\nIncise through the skin (with a scalpel) along the calvarial sagittal line, from the orbits to the external occipital protuberance (~4 cm in length). Ensure that the periosteum is incised.\nGently elevate the periosteum (with a periosteal elevator) on both side of the incision. Rinse the site with sterile saline.\nCylinder placement\nLocate the median and coronal sutures on the skull (Figure 2A,B). Note that these anatomical lines form a cross. The cylinders will be placed in each of the quadrants defined by the cross, ensuring that the edge of the cylinder is not over the suture (Figure 2C).\nPlace the first cylinder on the left upper quadrant (left frontal bone), and try to lay the device flat. Fix in the position with strong hand pressure and screw a micro-screw, until resistance is felt. Ensure that the screw head is flush with the surface of the cylinder tab.\nRepeat the same procedure on the other tab to fix the cylinder tightly onto the skull. Ensure that the cylinder is hermetically fixed to the bone.\nRepeat the procedure on the right upper quarter (right frontal bone), left lower quarter (left parietal bone) and right lower quarter (right parietal bone).",
    "Bone drilling of 5 intramedullary holes within the area circumscribed by the cylinders (Figure 1)\nDrill an intramedullary hole under saline irrigation (0.8 mm in diameter, ~1 mm in depth) with a round bur on the bone, in the center of the area circumscribed by the cylinder. Ensure that bleeding appears.\nDrill two more intramedullary holes along the axis passing through the two tab screws, at the inner edges of the cylinder. Along the perpendicular axe, drill two more intramedullary holes at the inner edges of the cylinder. Ensure that bleeding appears.\nRepeat the operation within the three other cylinders.\nFilling cylinders with material samples and capping (Figure 3)\nPrepare the desired bone substitute material according to manufacturer instructions or material specifications.\nFill the first cylinder to the brim with the material sample and close the cylinder by fitting the cap. Repeat the process in the 3 other cylinders.\nSurgical site closure\nClose the skin above the cylinders with an intermittent non-resorbable suture.\nApply a sprayable dressing onto the wound.\n3. Post-surgical treatment\nStop analgesia and anesthesia (propofol and fentanyl perfusion arrest) supply and check the recovery of autonomous breathing.\nStop the ventilation once the animal has recovered autonomous breathing. Maintain the animal under pure oxygen before complete awakening.\nInject buprenorphine hydrochloride SC (0.02 mg/kg, 0.03 mg/mL, 0.67 mL/kg) and repeat the injection every 6 h for 3 days as post-surgical analgesia.\nTransfer the animal into its usual housing with water and complete feeding.\nRemove the sutures after about 10 days of wound healing.\nSubscription Required.
