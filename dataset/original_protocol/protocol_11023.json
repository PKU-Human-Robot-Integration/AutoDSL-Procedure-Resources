    "Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain (approval ID: PR(IR)79/2009 PR(AG)114/2014, PR(AG)18/2018). Human colon tissue samples consisted of biopsies from non-necrotic areas of primary adenocarcinomas or liver metastases, corresponding to patients with colon and rectal cancer who underwent tumor resection. Experiments were conducted following the European Union's animal care directive (86/609/EEC) and were approved by the Ethical Committee of Animal Experimentation of the VHIR-the Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (ID: 40/08 CEEA, 47/08/10 CEEA and 12/18 CEEA).\nNOTE: Female NOD-SCID (NOD. CB17-Prkdcscid/NcrCrl) mice from 8 weeks-of-age were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.\n1. Derivation of patient cells\nTumor extraction\n\tNOTE: The following procedure is performed in a biological cabinet at room temperature (RT) in the animal facility.\n\t\nObtain tumor samples from the patients' surgeries or biopsies and from PDXs growing subcutaneously in mice.\nFor the orthotopic injection, prepare the tumor cells from established subcutaneous PDX tumor models instead of tissue obtained directly from patients9.\nGenerate PDX tumors by inoculating a suspension of 1 x 105 tumor cells in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (50 µL) mixed with Matrigel matrix (50 µL) subcutaneously in the flank of NOD-SCID mice2.\n\t\t\nMeasure tumor growth using a caliper every other day.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Importantly, our laboratory has generated a biobank of more than 350 PDX models. The CRC-PDX tumor models used in the protocol are established PDX models in the lab that have been amplified more than three passages in mice, and passed the inclusion/exclusion criteria with a positive result (Table 1).\nEuthanize the mice by cervical dislocation when subcutaneous tumors reach the maximum size established by the CEEA (1 cm of diameter), or when the animals reach endpoint criteria.",
    "Extract the tumor and carefully remove it from the skin and surrounding non-tumor tissue using scissors and forceps.\nStore the harvested tumors in PBS at 4 °C until the next step.\n\t\tNOTE: Dissociate the tumors in cell suspension as soon as possible after removal from their original location in the patients' lesions or subcutaneous xenografts in mice. Cell viability is significantly reduced 24 h after tissue removal, resulting in an inefficient implantation in recipient mice.\nCell preparation\n\tNOTE: The following procedure is performed in a biological cabinet at room temperature (RT) in the tissue culture room.\n\t\nDissociate the tumors using a blade in a 10 cm culture plate with 1 mL of complete CoCSCM 6Ab medium (Table 2) (to make mincing easier). Place the homogeneous dissociated sample into a 15 mL conical tube.\nAdd complete CoCSCM 6Ab medium to a final volume of 5 mL (use no more than 3 mL of dissociated sample in the same tube).\n\t\tNOTE: Primary CRC resected from patients are naturally contaminated with bacteria and fungus. It is essential to remove pathogens present in the original patient sample using a cocktail of six antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, fungizone, kanamycin, gentamycin, and nystatin). Injection of tumor cells contaminated with bacteria in immunodeficient mice may result in animal death.\nIncubate with 50 µL of DNase I (0.08 kU/mL) and 50 µL of collagenase (1.5 mg/mL) (digestion medium; Table 2) for 1 h at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator, at a 45° position. Mix the solution well every 15 min with a 5 mL pipette before the incubation.\n\t\tNOTE: Dissociate the tumor tissue and digest it by pipetting several times to obtain a single cell solution. This is essential for counting the cells before injecting in recipient mice and therefore achieving a homogeneous implantation of tumor cells.",
    "Add 5 mL of complete CoCSCM 6Ab medium and mix well with a 5 mL pipette.\nSort the solution with a 100 µm cell strainer using a new sterile 50 mL tube.\nSpin the sorted cells at 500 x g for 8 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 3 mL of 1x RBC lysis buffer solution.\nIncubate for 10 min at RT.\nAdd 3 mL of complete CoCSCM 6Ab medium, pipette the sample, and spin at 500 x g for 10 min at RT. Aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 5-10 mL of complete CoCSCM 6Ab medium, and use a cell counter to calculate the total number of cells.\nSpin the cells at 500 x g for 10 min at RT, and resuspend in 10 mL of PBS.\nResuspend the pellet to obtain a concentration of 20 x 106 cells/mL, and mix well to obtain a homogeneous cell suspension.\nPrepare 29 G syringes (0.5 mL U 100 needle, 0.33 mm [29 G] x 12.7 mm) for cecum injection in the tissue culture (one syringe/mouse). Load 50 µL of the tumor cell suspension (1 x 106 cells/injection) into the syringe and keep it on ice. Ensure that air bubbles are removed from the cell suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: Eliminating air bubbles when the tumor cells are loaded in the syringe is essential to avoid injection of an excessive volume in the cecum wall, which could result in tissue rupture and sample loss. It is imperative to mix the cell suspension well when loading the syringe to avoid uneven tumor size among mice in the same experiment.\n2. Orthotopic injection in cecum",
    "NOTE: The following procedure is performed on a bench in a specific pathogen free (SPF) room at the animal facility. The equipment used is previously cleaned and sterilized. In addition, it is sterilized again in a portable sterilizer between individuals or zones in the animal facility.\nClean the surgical site by spraying with disinfecting detergent and wiping.\nDepilate the mice abdomen using a mouse hair removal machine.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position. Use 2% isoflurane to anesthetize the animal. Confirm the effect of anesthesia by gently pinching the extremity and observing the absence of stimulation.\nPlace a 50-100 µL drop of veterinary ointment (3 mg/g Lacryvisc) in the eyes to prevent dryness during anesthesia.\nDisinfect the mouse abdomen by scrubbing with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine several times in a circular motion.\nMake a 1 cm longitudinal incision over the lower abdomen using surgery scissors. Carefully separate the skin to each site to present the peritoneum that is under the skin.\nMake a 0.5-1 cm incision in the peritoneum membrane, big enough to exteriorize the cecum.\n\tNOTE: Exteriorize the cecum without excessively manipulating the internal organs, which could dramatically increase the lethality of the procedure.\nCarefully isolate the cecum from the mouse using a pre-cut, sterile gauze.\nMoisten the cecum with saline solution throughout the whole procedure.\nImmobilize the cecum by carefully taking hold of it with forceps, and introduce the needle superficially into the cecum wall. Avoid capillaries and vessels in the injection site. Remove bubbles from the cell suspension.\nInject the whole 50µL of tumor cell suspension slowly. It usually takes around 10 s to administer. Avoid perforating the cecum lumen with the needle, as this results in the elimination of the tumor cell suspension from the body through intestinal peristalsis.",
    "NOTE: Injecting the tumor cell suspension in the cecum of the mice is the most challenging step of the entire procedure. A bright light focused on the injection site and a magnifying loupe should be used in this part of the protocol. Introduce the needle parallel to the cecum surface. The cecum is a very fragile tissue; therefore, immobilization of the cecum should be performed using surgical forceps and by applying gentle pressure to avoid tissue rupture resulting in hemorrhage. Successful implantation results in a white bubble (pellet of cells) in the cecum wall. If the bubble cannot be visualized, it may indicate that the cecum has been perforated and the cells have ended in the cecum lumen, resulting in their clearance by the intestinal tract.\nAfter injection, slowly remove the needle from the cecum and apply gentle pressure on the injection site with a cotton-tipped applicator, to avoid tumor cells escaping and reduce slight bleeding.\nClean the cecum with saline solution to remove any debris.\nReturn the cecum back into the abdomen of the animal.\nClose the peritoneum using 5/0 sutures.\nClose the skin of the abdomen using 5/0 sutures.\nAdminister post-operative antibiotics (100 mg/kg amoxicillin or 20 mg/kg enrofloxacin) and analgesics (5 mg/mL metacam/meloxicam) by subcutaneous injection. Place the mice on a heating pad and keep them there until they have fully recovered. Then, return them to the cage with other animals.\n3. Evaluation of orthotopic tumor growth using µCT scanning\nNOTE: The following procedure is performed in the preclinical imaging platform (PIP) from the animal facility.\nPerform all animal procedures following institutional ethical committee regulations.\nStart monitoring the tumor volume by µCT 2 weeks after cell injection, and every week thereafter.",
    "Freshly dilute the contrast agent iopamiro (300 mg/mL) in saline solution, in a ratio of 3:1 for both doses. Administer 300 mL of iopamiro by oral gavage.\n\tNOTE: Due to the poor soft tissue contrast of the µCT, a contrast agent is recommended to improve the sensitivity of the technique. The protocol includes an oral administration of an iodine-based agent (iopamiro) to delimitate the intraluminal tumor burden, and a secondary intraperitoneal administration of the same agent to define the tumor burden in the visceral face of the intestine. Pilot experiments have been previously performed to determine the exact time that the contrast agent needs to arrive to the cecum of mice before its elimination. In the case of iopamiro, it is around 2 h.\nAfter 2 h, administer an intraperitoneal injection of 300 mL of previously diluted iopamiro. The administration helps to define the tumor limits in the parietal face.\nAnesthetize the animals using 2% isoflurane.\nAfter confirming that the animal is correctly anesthetized by pinching the foot of the mouse, place the animal in the scanning bed of the µCT. The best position is supine (face up).\nIn the control software, start the live mode (fluoroscopy mode) to place the abdominal area into the field of view (FOV) of the scanner. To do that, move the bed forward and backward and laterally until the desired position is achieved. Rotate the X-ray tube and the detector 90°, and move the scanning bed in the y-axis to center the animal completely.\nUse the following parameters for the µCT scan images: 30 mm FOV, 26 s of acquisition time, 90 kV of current voltage, and 200 µA of current amperage, using an FX µCT imaging system.",
    "Return the animals to their cages for recovery when the scan is finished. Provide thermal support and monitor the animals until they recover from anesthesia before returning to housing.\nThe µCT acquisition yields a file 250 Mb in size for each scan. The created data files have a VOX format. In order to make them accessible for any imaging analysis software, convert the files to DICOM format using the database managing software of the µCT. Store the batch of created files in a portable hard disk in order to analyze them using any computer with available imaging software.\n\tNOTE: During image analysis, the cecum is localized as a dilated bowel with a radiodense content (iopamiro), frequently in the left side of the caudal abdomen. In the visceral flexure of the cecum, a wall thickening is observed, compared to the adjacent intestinal regions. The thickening corresponds to tumor growth.\nOnce the tumor is localized, find the highest diameter in the different views (axial, coronal, and sagittal). Measure these three axes and calculate the tumor volume following the ellipsoid formula: volume = 4/3π x (x-semiaxis x y-semiaxis x z-semiaxis)10.\n4. Therapeutic intervention in mice bearing orthotopic tumors\nMonitor the mice bearing orthotopic tumors weekly.\nWhen a tumor µCT scan signal is detected in most of the mice, perform another µCT scan the following week to confirm the presence of the tumor.\n\tNOTE: The time to start the treatment depends on the PDX model used, and varies from 3-12 weeks after tumor cell inoculation in the cecum.\nRandomize the mice in four groups: a vehicle group (n = 10-15 mice), a testing drug group (n = 10-15 mice), a standard of care chemotherapy group (n = 10-15 mice), and a combination treatment group (n = 10-15 mice).",
    "Treat the mice intraperitoneally with saline (vehicle group), the testing drug (20 mg/kg) (testing drug group), irinotecan (50 mg/kg) (standard of care group), or the testing drug (20 mg/kg) with irinotecan (50 mg/kg) (combination treatment group). Perform the administration once a week until the end of the experiment.\nMonitor the tumor growth weekly by µCT scanning throughout the course of the experiment.\nAt the end of the experiment, euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation and collect livers, lungs, and any other possible lesions in other organs.\nInclude the tissue samples in cassettes and incubate them in 4% formalin overnight. Use intestine tissue from a mouse without a tumor in the cecum as a control.\nRemove the cassettes from formalin and incubate with 70% ethanol for at least 3 h.\nEmbed the cassettes with paraffin, using histopathology facility standard protocols.\nPerform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining from the cecum, liver, and lung, using histopathology facility standard protocols.\nSubscription Required.
