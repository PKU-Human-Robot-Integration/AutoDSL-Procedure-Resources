    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of enzyme mix\nTiming: 20 min before initiating protocol\nPre-warm a 4.7 mL aliquot of RPMI or Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) in a 15 mL conical tube using a 37°C incubator.\nThaw a frozen aliquot of enzyme H, R, and A on room temperature or on ice.\nPrepare enzyme mix by adding 200 μL Enzyme H, 100 μL Enzyme R, and 25 μL enzyme A to 4.7 mL pre-warmed RPMI 1640 or DMEM in a 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: This volume of enzyme mix is optimized for tumor samples that weigh up to 1 g of tissue or are ∼0.5 × 0.5 cm in area. For larger samples, double the volume of enzyme mix.\nMincing and washing of head and neck tumor specimen\nTiming: 10 min\nOn a dry petri dish at room temperature, use two sterile scalpels to remove and discard fat, fibrous tissue, clots, and necrotic areas from the tumor sample.\nNote: Tumor tissue is firm and white or pink in appearance; adipose tissue is soft and yellow in appearance; fibrous tissue appears white with a rubbery texture; clots are soft and appear purple or black; necrotic tissue is soft and are typically brown or black in appearance.\nThoroughly mince the tumor tissue sample into approximately 1–2 mm pieces (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2675-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mincing of human head and neck tumor tissue\n(A) Initial tumor sample.\n(B) Tumor sample after the removal of fatty, fibrous, hemorrhagic, and necrotic areas.\n(C and D) Mincing of tumor tissue into 1–2 mm pieces using two sterile scalpels.\nCritical: Ensure that the tumor sample is thoroughly minced, as incomplete mincing may lead to diminished cell yield.",
    "Transfer as much of the minced sample to a 15 mL conical tube as possible using a scalpel.\nAdd 10 mL PBS to the petri dish and pipette it over the surface of the petri dish multiple times to collect any residual tissue fragments. Transfer the PBS solution containing residual tissue fragments to the 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL conical tube containing the sample for 5 min at 300 g at 4°C.\nMechanical and enzymatic dissociation of head and neck tumor specimen\nTiming: 60 min\nAfter centrifuging, aspirate and discard supernatant and add pre-warmed enzyme mix.\nTriturate (pipette up and down approximately 20 times) with a 10 mL serological pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2675-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Trituration of head and neck tumor sample with serological pipette\n(A) Tumor sample prior to trituration.\n(B) Placement of serological pipette in contact with the bottom of the 15 mL conical tube to facilitate additional mechanical dissociation.\n(C) Sample after multiple rounds of trituration.\nNote: If the specimen is larger (i.e., greater than 2 g or 1 cm3), consider first triturating the sample using a 25 mL pipette in a 50 mL conical tube.\nCritical: When triturating, titrate technique to the ease with which the sample is aspirated into the pipette. In the early stages of dissociation, when tissue fragments are larger, there may be difficulty with pipetting fragments. If this is encountered, stop triturating and proceed to the incubation step. Forcing the sample into the pipette when it is too large may result in loss of sample into the pipette filter due to buildup of negative pressure or difficulty with expelling it out of the pipette, causing buildup of positive pressure and loss of sample out of the top of the conical tube.",
    "Incubate the sample in a water or bead bath at 37°C for 10 min and invert the tube every few minutes to maximize surface area of sample exposed to the enzyme mix.\nRepeat steps 10–11 to effectively dissociate the sample. When possible, switch to triturating with a 5 mL serological pipette.\nNote: As the sample begins to dissociate, it will be possible to pipette up and down with the pipette tip close to or in contact with the bottom of the conical tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). This technique narrows the space through which the cell solution passes, thus creating additional mechanical shearing forces for dissociation of cell clusters.\nCritical: When triturating with the pipette in contact with the bottom of the conical tube, it is critical to avoid buildup of negative or positive pressure in the pipette, which may result in loss of sample as described above.\nAs the sample dissociates, the media should start to appear cloudy. To assess the adequacy of dissociation, remove 90 μL sample into a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube and add 10 μL trypan blue. Under the microscope, the sample should contain mostly individual cells; if the majority of the cells are clustered together, then the sample may benefit from additional trituration. Steps 10–11 should be repeated for no more than 1 h, as extended incubation in the enzyme mix may cause excessive cell death.",
    "Note: For treatment-naïve head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) primary tumor samples, we find that approximately an hour of dissociation time is sufficient. For adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) samples, dissociation typically takes 30–45 min, as samples are less fibrous and more highly cellular. For lymph node samples, regardless of cancer type, dissociation also typically takes 30–45 min. For tumors samples that are large (greater than 1 cm3) and difficult to dissociate, consider dividing the original sample in two and performing two dissociations in parallel.\nAfter adequate dissociation, pipette the single cell suspension through a 100 μm (yellow) cell strainer into a 50 mL conical tube. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2675-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Filtration of single cell suspension\nA 100 μm strainer is used to filter gross debris and undissociated tissue.\nCritical: Pipette the sample onto the bottom of the strainer, rather than onto the sides, as straining through the sides may result in loss of sample when removing the strainer.\nWash the strainer with 10 mL media (RPMI 1640 or DMEM) and then wash the cells by pipetting up and down.\nNote: Store the cell strainer containing residual tissue on ice or at room temperature. Residual tissue can be reprocessed with fresh enzyme solution using the same protocol if the cell recovery is low. The cell strainer can be discarded at the end of the dissociation once an adequate cell count is confirmed.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 300 g at 4°C.\nPreparation and staining of single-cell suspension\nTiming: 30–40 min\nAspirate and discard the supernatant. To avoid disrupting the pellet, the last 1 mL of supernatant may be removed carefully with a P1000 pipette.",
    "At this point, if a tumor specimen is being processed for cell or organoid culture applications it may not be necessary to perform cell sorting prior to culture and the cell suspension can simply be resuspended in the appropriate culture media.\nIf the pellet appears red, it may contain red blood cells (RBCs). Remove these cells using RBC lysis solution. If the pellet appears white, proceed to step 19.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).\nPrepare 1× RBC lysis solution (1 mL RBC solution in 9 mL ddH2O).\nAdd 9 mL 1× RBC lysis solution to 1 mL cell suspension in HBSS.\nVortex for 5 s.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 300 g at 4°C.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nNote: In our experience, careful separation of clots and bloody tissue in step 1 typically prevents RBC contamination.\nResuspend cells in PBS + 1% BSA such that the final volume is 100 μL after adding antibodies (step 20).\nIf multiple different cell populations are to be isolated by FACS, the dissociated specimen can be divided into separate 100-μL samples at this point.\nAdd 10 μL CD45-VioBlue, 5 μL CD90-PE, and 5 μL CD31-PE-Cy7 antibodies to the cell suspension.\nNote: This combination of antibodies is most useful for enriching for malignant cells from HNSCC tumors by depleting for immune cells (CD45), fibroblasts (CD90), and endothelial cells (CD31). Due to the higher fraction of malignant cells in ACC tumors, enriching CD90 negative and CD31 negative cells is typically not necessary.\nNote: To enrich for T cells, stain with the combination of 10 μL CD45-VioBlue and 5 μL CD3-PE-cy7.",
    "Note: Antibody-fluorophore complexes are sensitive to photo-oxidation. Protect these stocks from light by turning off the lights in the tissue culture hood while staining.\nIncubate sample on ice covered with foil for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 300 g at 4°C. Remove the supernatant.\nWash cells with 1 mL PBS, 1% BSA.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 300 g at 4°C. Remove the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the cells in 0.5–1.5 mL PBS, 1% BSA (volume correlating with pellet size) and transfer the sample to a FACS tube with a 35 μm filter top. Pipette carefully through the filter. Change the top to non-filtered top. Keep the samples on ice protected from light by covering with foil to prevent photo-oxidation.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting\nTiming: 60–90 min\nPrior to sorting, add calcein AM (1:1000) to stain live cells and To-Pro-3 iodide (1:3000) to stain dead cells.\nFor example, for a total volume of 150 μL, add 1.5 μL calcein and 0.5 μL To-Pro-3 iodide.\nGently vortex and allow 1 min for the stain to work.\nNote: Add calcein and To-Pro-3 Iodide immediately prior to sorting. If multiple samples are being sorted, add compounds individually.\nNote: Alternative live/dead cell stains can be used as long their spectra do not significantly overlap with the other antibodies used for sorting.\nSort as appropriate for subsequent applications.\nFor plate-based single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, sort 1 cell per well of a 96-well plate prepared with 10 μL lysis buffer (buffer TCL + 1% beta-mercaptoethanol).\nFor droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, sort cells into a 1.7 mL Lobind Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube containing PBS with 1% BSA.\nFor cell and 3D organoid culture applications, cells may be sorted directly into serum-containing media in a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Note: FACS must be performed on a FACSAria Fusion Special Order System (BD Biosciences) or equivalent, using 488 nm (calcein AM, 530/30 filter), 640 nm (To-Pro-3, 670/14 filter), 405 nm (Vioblue, 450/50 filter), 561 nm (PE, 586/15 filter; PE-Cy7, 780/60 filter) lasers.\nCritical: A 100 μm nozzle must be used for cell sorting, as the 70 μm nozzle with higher sorting pressures results in frequent lysis of cells and decreased viability of sorted cells."
