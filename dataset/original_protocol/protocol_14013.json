    "The protocol was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China.\n1. Preparation prior to the training\nNOTE: The vascular reconstruction training machine is shown in Figure 1. It consists of a control panel and an operating floor.\nClick the Clean button on the control panel to clean and drain the residual liquid from the operating floor.\nClick the Add Liquid button on the control panel and add 0.9% saline into the machine from the operating floor until the prompt \"The testing liquid is adequate\" appears on the control panel.\nPrepare the magnetic tractor, which consists of a circular permanent magnet with a diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1 mm, an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic casing, a spiral spring, a 30 cm nylon traction wire, and a stainless-steel clamp with plastic sleeves or a vascular clamp.\n\t\nGlue the circular magnet and the plastic casing together using an acrylate adhesive. The traction force will increase with the lengthening of the traction wire. Use a universal testing machine to test the association between the length of the traction wire and the traction force (Figure 2).\nFix the clamp and the plastic casing on the upper holder and the lower holder of the universal testing machine, respectively. Gradually elevate the upper holder to stretch the traction wire between the two holders. Test the strength of the traction wire while it is being stretched.\n\t\tNOTE: The magnetic suture tractor and magnetic vascular tractor are shown in Figure 3.\nPrepare a magnetic suture puller.",
    "Use a quasi-oval polylactic acid board with a thickness of 2 mm, a major axis diameter of 10 cm, a minor axis diameter of 2 cm, three magnetic balls with a diameter of 5 mm, and three magnetic cylinders with a diameter of 5 mm and a height of 5 mm.\nPunch three holes with a diameter of 3 mm and a depth of 0.5 mm on the polylactic acid board, so that the magnetic balls can cling to the board by magnetic attraction force from the magnetic cylinders under the board.\n\t\tNOTE: The magnetic suture puller is shown in Figure 4.\nFix the suture under the magnetic ball after one stitch. This plays the role of a suture puller, preventing the previous suture from loosening. Extract the end with the suture needle with a force of about 0.3 N, closely in parallel to the polylactic acid board, and continue the next stitch.\nLigate all the vein branches using 3-0 silk sutures to avoid leakage after anastomosis. Use tissue scissors to trim the ends of the veins and clear the excess tissue on the wall of the veins to make the veins smooth.\n\tNOTE: The vasculature used in this study included the right and left iliac veins (diameter ~10 mm) harvested from Bama pigs weighing 50–60 kg. To simplify the reconstruction, only a few branches of the iliac veins were picked, and the two veins were similar in size. The vasculature was kept at -20 °C. Before training, it was immersed in 0.9% saline at room temperature.\n2. Fix the veins on the operating floor\nTie the two veins on the water inlet and water outlet of the training machine with 2-0 silk sutures.\n\tNOTE: This study uses the two-point vascular anastomosis5.",
    "Adjust the length of the water outlet of the training machine and ensure that the ends of the two veins are tension-free in a parallel direction.\nStraighten the veins and lay two 4-0 polypropylene traction sutures at the 6 o’clock and 12 o’clock positions.\nInsert the needle of the traction sutures from the outside of the vein and then insert from the inside of the other vein.\nWet the surgical glove and sutures to avoid damaging the sutures. Gently tie at least five knots to avoid tearing the walls of the veins.\nUse the two stainless-steel clamps of the magnetic suture tractor to grasp the traction sutures and attract the circular magnets of the magnetic suture tractors to the ferromagnetic stainless-steel operating floor. Adjust the position of magnetic attraction and ensure that the ends of the two veins are stretched in a vertical direction.\nUse the two vascular clamps of the magnetic vascular tractor to clamp the anterior wall of the veins and attract the circular magnets of the magnetic vascular tractors on the operating floor. Adjust the position of attraction and ensure that the anterior walls of the veins are retracted, and the posterior walls of the veins are clearly exposed.\n3. Anastomosis of posterior walls\nUse the two stainless-steel clamps of the magnetic suture tractor to grasp the traction sutures and attract the circular magnets of the magnetic suture tractors on the ferromagnetic stainless-steel operating floor. Leave the tail segment of the polypropylene suture at the 12 o’clock position for the traction suture and use the segment with the needle for continuous suture.\nEnsure intima-to-intima contact between the two veins.\nInsert the first suture from the outside of the vein to the inside.",
    "In subsequent sutures, insert the needle from the inside of the vein and then insert from the outside of the other vein.\nCheck that the sutures are not loose.\nAfter one suture, ensure that the polypropylene suture is hung on the magnetic suture puller and pull the polypropylene gently until the magnetic ball presses the polypropylene.\nExtract the end with the needle of the suture with a force of about 0.3 N, closely in parallel to the polylactic acid board, and continue the next stitch.\n\tNOTE: By using this technique, the tail of the polypropylene suture will be sufficiently tight. As the sutures continue, the polypropylene suture will become shorter. According to the length of the suture, select the most suitable of the three magnetic balls, and then manually press the suture under it.\nInsert the last suture from the inside of the vein to the outside to ensure intima-to-intima contact between the two veins.\nAvoid stenosis after anastomosis by two means: Keep same, proper margin and needle spacing when stitching, and keep the \"growth factor\"15 when knotting.\n\tNOTE: The \"growth factor\" is the reserved space away from the vessel wall when tying the first knot after the anastomosis so that vessels can remain flexible rather than stenose.\n\t\nMaintain the same suture margin and needle spacing.\n\t\tNOTE: In this study, iliac veins with a diameter of approximately 10 mm were used, so the suture margin and needle spacing was about 1 mm.\nKeep the \"growth factor\"15 when tying the knots. After anastomosis of the posterior walls, tie the end of the suture and the tail segment of the suture at the 6 o’clock position together away from the vein wall in order to prevent suture stenosis. Use the standard method for tying knots.\n4. Anastomosis of anterior walls",
    "After anastomosis of the posterior walls, remove the magnetic vascular tractor, leave the tail as a traction suture, and use the segment with the needle at the 6 o’clock position for the anastomosis of the anterior walls.\nInsert the needle from the outside of the vein and then insert from the inside of the other vein.\n\tNOTE: The methods used in the anastomosis of the posterior walls to ensure the intima-to-intima contact between the two veins (the suture not being loose and avoiding stenosis after anastomosis) were followed in the anastomosis of the anterior walls5,15.\nAfter anastomosis of the anterior walls, cut off two traction sutures using suture scissors.\n5. Test the effect of anastomosis\nSet the test parameters.\n\t\nSet the perfusion pressure as 2.0 kPa on the control panel.\n\t\tNOTE: The normal vein pressure will not exceed 2.0 kPa.\nSet the duration of peak pressure as 5 s on the control panel.\nSet the temperature as 25 °C on the control panel.\nSet the pressure deviation as 0.1 kPa on the control panel.\nClick the Test button and observe the time and pressure on the control panel and whether the reconstructed vein leaks.\n\tNOTE: If the vein does not leak during the peak pressure, the anastomosis is successful. If leaks are found, the leakage position should be located and sutured, and then the test should be performed again. The results of the test in this video are shown in Figure 5.\n6. Checking the safety of the magnetic suture puller",
    "NOTE: To test whether the magnetic suture puller damaged the polypropylene suture, perform the breaking strength and light microscopy tests. In this experiment, three groups with six segments of 4-0 polypropylene suture in each were tested: a control group with no intervention on the polypropylene suture, a manual group in which the polypropylene suture was manually pulled with sterile gloves 20x, and a magnetic puller group in which the magnetic puller pulled the polypropylene suture 20x.\nTest the breaking strength of the polypropylene suture on the universal testing machine. Fix the two ends of the polypropylene suture on the upper holder and the lower holder of the universal testing machine. Gradually elevate the upper holder. Test the strength of the polypropylene suture while it is being stretched. Set the breaking strength as the tension force when the suture snaps. Compare the breaking strength among the three groups and perform pairwise comparisons.\nObserve the damage of the polypropylene suture under a light microscope. Define the number of damage points as the number of fibrous or coarse fracture points visible at 200x magnification. Compare the number of damage points among the three groups and perform pairwise comparisons.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
