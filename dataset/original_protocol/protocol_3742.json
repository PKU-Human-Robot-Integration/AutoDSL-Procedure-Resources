    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell culture and treatment\nTiming: 2–3 days\nCritical: Cell culture needs to be performed entirely under a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet to avoid contamination\nNote: Pre-warming the complete cell culture medium and Trypsin-EDTA is recommended to avoid exposing culture cells to excessive thermal shift and minimizing detachment time, respectively.\nCells are seeded in 24-well plates containing sterile glass coverslips and allowed to attach and recover normal proliferation in view of challenging them with irradiation or other experimental conditions that may induce the accumulation of dsDNA in the cytosol.\nDetach TS/A cells from maintenance cultures in T75 flasks\nDiscard exhausted culture medium\nAdd 2 mL 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA to each flask\nIncubate flasks for 2–3 min at 37°C\nNote: Although Trypsin-EDTA is classified as non-hazardous (NONH), it should be manipulated by wearing appropriate recommended PPE.\nNote: As detachment time can vary considerably with cell type and may be inhibited by some medium leftovers, flasks should be visually inspected for complete cell detachment before proceeding.\nAlternatives: Mechanical scraping can be employed as an alternative to enzymatic detachment.\nAdd 7 mL complete culture medium to each flask\nCollect detached cells in 50 mL Falcon tubes\nNote: The amount of Trypsin-EDTA and complete culture medium employed depend on flask size. Indicatively 1 mL trypsin and 4 mL culture medium are appropriate for T25 flasks, while 5 mL trypsin and 10 mL culture medium are appropriate for T175 flasks.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 350 g, 20°C–25°C for 5 min\nDiscard supernatants\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL complete culture medium\nTS/A cells are seeded in coverslip-containing 24-well plates\nCount cells with a standard or automated hemocytometer\nAdd complete culture medium to the cell suspension to achieve 1 × 104 cells/mL",
    "Seed 0.5 mL of this suspension in coverslip-containing 24-well plates and return plates to the incubator\nPause Point: Freshly seeded cells must be allowed to attach to coverslips and resume proliferation for at least 16 h. Some cell types may require up to 24–36 h for fully recovering proliferation upon seeding.\nCritical: Cell density at seeding must be tailored to the overall duration of the experiment as well as the proliferation rate of each specific cell type so that control (untreated) cells achieve no more than 50%–60% confluence at fixation.\nTS/A cells are irradiated\nIn all wells, replace exhausted culture medium with 0.5 mL fresh, pre-warmed complete culture medium\nExpose cells to a single irradiation dose of 8 Gy with a SARRP\nNote: Exposure time to achieve 8 Gy total dose depends on the dose-rate employed for irradiation.\nNote: Any experimental treatment of choice can be tested for its ability to promote cytosolic dsDNA accumulation, provided that appropriate control conditions are implemented including (but potentially not limited to): (1) untreated or vehicle-treated cells as negative control, and (2) cells exposed to agents known for their ability to drive the release of nuclear or mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol as positive controls. The latter include irradiation (Rodriguez-Ruiz et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Yamazaki et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) as well as a variety of pharmacological agents that interfere with DNA repair, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) (Chabanon et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Ding et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and ATR serine/threonine kinase (ATR) inhibitors (Dillon et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Dillon et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCritical: The maximal number of 24-well plates that can be simultaneously irradiated in the SARRP in the absence of a sizeable reduction in dose at the edges of the irradiation field depends on the elevation of the support platform.",
    "Alternatives: Systems other than the SARRP can be employed for irradiation provided that they offer control on total dose (as the latter influences cytosolic dsDNA accumulation) (Vanpouille-Box et al., 2017b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nPause Point: Control and irradiated cells are maintained in standard culture conditions for the desired amount of time prior to processing for IF microscopy.\nCritical: The time elapsing between irradiation or other challenges and fixation may influence considerably the amount and origin of dsDNA molecules detectable in the cytosol (Harding et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Mackenzie et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Yamazaki et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nCytosolic dsDNA staining (and optionally COX4 or TFAM co-staining)\nTiming: 2 days\nNote: Sterile conditions are no longer required.\nNote: For all steps below until staining, coverslips remain in 24-well plates.\nTS/A cells are subjected to fixation and permeabilization conditions that enable for the IF microscopy-based assessment of cytosolic dsDNA molecules relative to COX4 or TFAM\nFixation/permeabilization\nDiscard culture medium\nFix cells with 0.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v in PBS) for 10 min at 20°C–25°C\nNote: Optimal fixation conditions may vary with cell type.\nWash fixed cells twice with 0.5 mL PBS.\nPause Point: Fixed cells can be stored (before staining) for up to 1 month at 4°C, provided that coverslip are covered with 1 mL PBS and that plates are sealed with parafilm to avoid PBS evaporation. In this case, coverslips should be visually inspected to ensure normal cellular morphology before resuming the protocol.\nTransfer coverslips selected for staining to a fresh 24-well plate containing 0.5 mL PBS per well\nDiscard PBS\nPermeabilize cells with 0.5 mL permeabilization buffer A for 10 min at 20°C–25°C\nNote: Optimal permeabilization conditions may vary with cell type.\nCritical: Permeabilization conditions must be optimized to avoid permeabilization of intracellular membranes at this step (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).",
    "Wash coverslips three times with 0.5 mL PBS\nBlock unspecific binding sites with 0.5 mL blocking buffer for 1 h 20°C–25°C\nPrimary staining\nTransfer coverslips sample-side onto microscopy slides or parafilm within an opaque humidified chamber containing ddH2O\nNote: Virtually any opaque or aluminum-covered container that allow for coverslips to lay in the absence of physical contact with ddH2O can be harnessed as a humidified chamber.\nNote: Up to 3 coverslips can be transferred next to each other on the same slide.\nNote: It is recommended to encircle each coverslip with a hydrophobic barrier from a PAP Pen to avoid (1) an excessive dispersal of the staining solution that may allow parts of the coverslip to dry, as well as (2) cross-contamination, if different staining solutions are used for coverslips next to each other.\nStain cytosolic dsDNA by gently dropping 60 μL of blocking buffer supplemented with anti-dsDNA antibodies (1:1000 v/v) onto each coverslip, and maintain coverslips in the humidified chamber for 12–16 h at 4°C\nOptionally, simultaneously stain COX4 or TFAM by further supplementing the blocking buffer with anti-COX4 (1:300 v/v) or anti-TFAM (1:500 v/v) antibodies\nSecondary staining\nTransfer coverslips to a new 24-well plate containing 0.5 mL washing buffer per well\nWash coverslips three times (5 min each) with washing buffer\nStain anti-dsDNA antibodies with 0.3 mL of blocking buffer supplemented with Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (1:1000 v/v) for 30–60 min at 20°C–25°C\nOptionally, simultaneously stain anti-COX4 or anti-TFAM antibodies by further supplementing the blocking buffer with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1000 v/v)",
    "Alternatives: The staining of anti-dsDNA (and optionally anti-COX4 or anti-TFAM) antibodies can also be performed upon returning coverslips into the humidified chamber. In this case, 60 μL of blocking buffer supplemented with Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated anti-mouse (and optionally Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-rabbit) antibodies (1:500 v/v) are used.\nAlternatives: Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies can be equally used for staining (30–60 min at 20°C–25°C) anti-dsDNA antibodies if no co-staining is planned. We chose to reveal dsDNA with Alexa Fluor® 594 and other structures with Alexa Fluor® 488 because with our imaging system this specific approach provided images with superior quality.\nWash coverslips three times (5 min each) with washing buffer\nAlternatives: If coverslips were returned to the humidified chamber for the secondary staining, they must be transferred to a new 24-well plate containing 0.5 mL washing buffer per well prior to washing.\nWash coverslips once with 0.5 mL PBS\nAlternatives: Cytosolic dsDNA and LMNB1 co-staining\nTiming: 2 days\nTS/A cells stained for cytosolic dsDNA molecules are further fixed, permeabilized and stained to enable the IF microscopy-based co-detection of LMNB1.\nFixation/permeabilization\nDiscard PBS\nRe-fix cells with 0.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v in PBS) for 10 min at 20°C–25°C\nWash coverslips three times (5 min each) with 0.5 mL PBS\nRe-permeabilize cells with 0.5 mL permeabilization buffer B for 10 min at 20°C–25°C\nNote: Optimal re-fixation and re-permeabilization conditions may vary with cell type.\nCritical: Additional fixation is required to obtain sharp resolution (high signal-to-noise ratio) on the dsDNA staining (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nWash coverslips three times with 0.5 mL PBS\nBlock unspecific binding sites with 0.5 mL blocking buffer for 1 h at 20°C–25°C\nPrimary staining\nTransfer coverslips sample-side onto microscopy slides or parafilm within an opaque humidified chamber containing ddH2O.",
    "Note: Virtually any opaque or aluminum-covered container that allow for coverslips to lay in the absence of physical contact with ddH2O can be harnessed as a humidified chamber.\nNote: Up to 3 coverslips can be transferred next to each other on the same slide.\nNote: It is recommended to encircle each coverslip with a hydrophobic barrier from a PAP Pen to avoid (1) an excessive dispersal of the staining solution that may allow parts of the coverslip to dry, as well as (2) cross-contamination, if different staining solutions are used for coverslips next to each other.\nStain LMNB1 by gently dropping 60 μL of blocking buffer supplemented with anti-LMNB1 antibodies (1:500 v/v) onto each coverslip, and maintain coverslips in the humidified chamber for 12–16 h at 4°C\nSecondary staining\nDiscard the staining solution\nTransfer coverslip to a new 24-well plate containing 0.5 mL washing buffer per well\nWash coverslips three times (5 min each) with washing buffer\nStain anti-LMNB1 antibodies with 0.3 mL of blocking buffer supplemented with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1000 v/v) for 30-60 min at 20°C–25°C\nAlternatives: The staining of anti-LMNB1 antibodies can also be performed upon returning coverslips to the humidified chamber. In this case, 60 μL of blocking buffer supplemented with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:500 v/v) are used.\nWash coverslips three times (5 min each) with washing buffer\nAlternatives: If coverslips were returned to the humidified chamber for the secondary staining, they must be transferred to a new 24-well plate containing 0.5 mL washing buffer per well prior to washing\nWash coverslips once with 0.5 mL PBS\nMounting and acquisition\nTiming: 1–3 days\nNote: The timing for mounting and acquisition is largely influenced by the number of samples, type of acquisition and number of images collected per sample.",
    "Stained coverslips are mounted onto microscopy slides and images are acquired on confocal or widefield microscopy.\nMounting\nPlace one drop of DAPI-containing mounting medium on a standard slide for microscopy\nAlternatives: Although commonly used by us and others, DAPI has broad excitation and emission spectra, which may negatively influence signal-to-noise ratio at detection wavelength employed for Alexa Fluor® 594 and Alexa Fluor® 488. As an alternative, nuclear counterstaining can be achieved by incubating coverslips in 0.3 mL Hoechst 33342 solution (working concentration 5 μg/mL in PBS) for 10 min at 20°C–25°C, followed by mounting with ProLong™ Glass Antifade Mountant (Fisher Scientific Cat #P36980)\nRetrieve individual coverslips from 24-well plates with Graefe forceps and rapidly dry them on paper\nCritical: Drying should be rapid and relatively superficial (aimed at avoiding excessive dilution of the mounting medium) as many biologically samples become auto-fluorescent if allowed to completely dry after fixation (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nLay coverslip sample-side down on the mounting medium drop so that stained cells are in direct contact with the medium\nNote: Up to 3 coverslips can be mounted next to each other on the same slide\nAllow mounting medium to cure for 24 h at 20°C–25°C under protection from light\nPause Point: Mounted slides can be stored at 4 °C under protection from light for at least 4 weeks in the absence of significant photobleaching prior to imaging.\nConfocal microscopy imaging\nAdjust laser power and gain of each channel to satisfy the dynamic range of the experiment by imaging 2–3 control and 2–3 treated samples\nOnce laser power and gain are selected, image at least 3 representative fields from each sample on individual blue (DAPI), red (cytosolic dsDNA) and green (LMNB1, COX4 or TFAM) channels (see above for excitation/emission peaks and laserline/detector settings)",
    "Single-channel images of specific Z-planes can be merged, and/or single-channel or merge images can be reconstructed into 3D animations (based on the maximum projection approach) for visualization purposes\nCritical: Laser power and gain should be adjusted to prevent overexposure of each fluorophore even in the brightest condition.\nNote: All commercial confocal microscopes are provided with software packages that enable merging and 3D reconstructions.\nAlternatives: ImageJ/FIJI (NIH) can also be employed for merging and 3D reconstruction, respectively.\nWidefield microscopy imaging\nAdjust illumination power and exposure time of each channel to satisfy the dynamic range of the experiment by imaging 2–3 control and 2–3 treated samples\nOnce illumination power and exposure time are selected, image at least 3 fields per coverslip on individual blue (DAPI), red (cytosolic dsDNA) and green (LMNB1, COX4 or TFAM) channels (see above for excitation/emission peaks and laserline/detector settings)\nSingle-channel images can be merged for visualization purposes and/or subjected to automated analysis for quantitative assessments, as detailed below\nCritical: Illumination power and exposure time should be adjusted to prevent overexposure of each fluorophore even in the brightest condition.\nNote: ImageJ/FIJI and widefield microscope software packages for acquisition can be used to merge images.\nPause Point: Images can be stored indefinitely prior to analysis.\nAutomated image analysis\nTiming: 1 day\nSingle-channel widefield microscopy images are processed for the assessment of number of cytosolic dsDNA-positive foci in each cell, percentage of cells containing cytosolic dsDNA-positive foci (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), and spatial localization of cytosolic dsDNA-positive foci with respect to COX4, TFAM or LMNB1.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/667-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Pipeline for automated image analysis\nImages that exemplify automated segmentation and quantification of cytosolic dsDNA+ objects. Scale bar = 30 μm.\nNote: Photoshop (Adobe), ImageJ/FIJI or equivalent imaging software is employed to adjust images prior to automated analysis.\nGeneration of LUT files",
    "Open single-channel images from multiple conditions and adjust levels manually to obtain sharp resolution. Carefully avoid over- and under-exposure by monitoring histograms.\nUse the function “Save presets” in the Levels pop-up window to save “Look Up Table” (LUT) files for each channel\nApply LUT files as defined above to each single-channel image by the function “Load presets” in the Levels pop-up window\nSave level-optimized single-channel images in a dedicated folder for automated image analysis\nAlternatives: Cell Profiler can be employed to adjust single-channel images prior to automated image analysis (Kamentsky et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). This is expected to shorten workflow, but requires implementation of additional steps not described herein.\nNote: Adjusting the levels in Photoshop could alter pixel intensities and scaling of the grey values of the image and hence influence intensity measurements. That said, comparing the results of automated image analysis to quantifications by three independent operators, we never found this potential issue to significantly alter quantitative assessments.\nNote: Cell Profiler is employed for automated image analysis based on publicly available algorithms that have been customized to fit the identification of nuclear and cytosolic objects (Kamentsky et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: Before running the actual analysis, it is recommended to test each step using the “Test Mode”.\nIdentification of nuclear and cytosolic objects with Cell Profiler\nIdentification of nuclear objects\nIdentify nuclear objects as objects of 40–110 pixels diameter in blue-channel images with the “IdentifyPrimaryObjects” package\nAlternatives: In case of LMNB1 co-staining, green-channel images can be equally employed to define nuclear objects as above.\nDiscard objects outside this diameter range as well as objects on the image borders",
    "Identify clumped objects by “Shape” and separate them based on “Signal intensity”. Turn on the following additional features “Automatically calculate size of the smoothing filter for declumping” and “Automatically calculate minimal allowed distance between local maxima”.\nIdentification of cytoplasmic areas\nOn blue-channel images with identified nuclear objects that are used as input objects, identify cellular objects with the “IdentifySecondaryObjects” package, by the distance - N method expanding the primary object by 50 pixels\nUsing the package “IdentifyTertiaryObjects”, define cytoplasmic areas subtractively based on cellular and nuclear objects\nNote: The optimal extent and method of expansion to identify cellular objects may vary considerably with cell type and magnification. Visual comparison of cytoplasmic areas in processed images vs. cells in enhanced green-channel images can be used to assess fidelity and alter the extent of expansion if needed.\nAlternatives: In case of LMNB1 co-staining, green-channel images can be equally employed to define cytoplasmic areas as above.\nIdentification of dsDNA+, COX4+ and TFAM+ objects with Cell Profiler\nUse the he “EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures” package to enhance speckles of 15 pixels diameter on red- or green-channel images, depending on the secondary antibodies employed for IF\nNote: The optimal diameter for this step may vary considerably with cell type and magnification.\nCritical: Insufficient or excessive enhancement largely compromises automated image analysis as it prevents proper identification of prevents correct identification of primary objects and hence precise quantitative assessments (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nOn enhanced images, identify dsDNA+, COX4+ or TFAM+ objects as objects of 4–25 pixels diameter on red- or green-channel images, depending on the secondary antibodies employed for IF, with the “IdentifyPrimaryObjects” package\nDiscard objects outside this diameter range as well as objects on the image borders",
    "Identify clumped objects by “Shape” and separate them based on “Signal intensity”. Turn on the following additional features “Automatically calculate size of the smoothing filter for declumping” and “Automatically calculate minimal allowed distance between local maxima”\nApply the “MeasureObjectIntensity” package to dsDNA+, COX4+ or TFAM+ objects\nDiscard objects with signal intensity <0.04\nNote: Intensity, size thresholds and declumping parameters for defining and discarding dsDNA+, COX4+ and TFAM+ objects may vary in different cell types, across experiments and/or with different image acquisition devices. Visual comparison of dsDNA+, COX4+ and TFAM+ objects in enhanced images vs. dsDNA+, COX4+ and TFAM+ structured in enhanced red- or green-channel images can be used to assess fidelity and alter parameters if needed.\nNote: The optical resolution of our system (∼0.32 μm) is intrinsically insufficient to resolve cytosolic dsDNA+ foci closer to each other of <0.32 μm, implying that quantitative results will suffer from some degree of underestimation, especially in presence of cytosolic dsDNA+ foci at high density.\nIdentification of cytosolic dsDNA+ objects with Cell Profiler\nRelate dsDNA+ objects and cytoplasmic areas (defined as above) as child and parent, respectively, with the “RelateObjects” package\nUsing the “FilterObjects” package, select cytoplasmic areas containing a minimum value of 1 children object as positive cells.\nNote: Thresholds should be validated for each set of images as they might vary in different cell types, across experiments and/or with different image acquisition devices. “Test mode” should be used to validate that the parameters are adequate for each set of images. Specifically, the value of children objects employed to define positive cells is selected as the closest integer number below to the average number of cytosolic dsDNA+ dots observed in untreated cells (in our settings, 1.46 see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1])",
