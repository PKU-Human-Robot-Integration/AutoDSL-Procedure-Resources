    "CRITICAL STEP: During the whole procedure it is crucial to keep all working spaces sterile.\n**Faecal sample dilution** \nTIMING: 5 min per sample\n1| Weigh the faecal material \\(50 mg) and add 500 μL of sterile PBS to attain a 10% \\(m/v) suspension.\n**Sample homogenisation** \nTIMING: 1 min per sample\n2| Set the MINILYS homogeniser for 3000 rpm \\(speed 1) for 60 seconds using 2 mL tubes with O-ring\ncaps.\nCRITICAL STEP: Tubes should not have any type of beads, this results in massive loss of viruses. Without homogenisation filters are more likely to clog.\n**Centrifugation**\n TIMING: 3 min\n3| Centrifuge at 17000g for 3 min. Retrieve at least 150 μL of the supernatant for the next step. \n**Filtration**\n TIMING: 1 min per sample\n4| Filter the supernatant obtained in a 0.8 μm \\(PES) filter at 17000g for 1 min.\nTROUBLESHOOTING: In case of clogging of the filter membrane consider further diluting the sample or replace the spin membrane with a new one and transfer the remaining supernatant. Alternatively, a pre-filtration step with a larger pore size of 10 μm could be performed.\n**Nuclease treatment**\n TIMING: 2h\n5| Set a heating block for 37 ̊C.\n6| Add 7 μL of 20x homemade buffer \\(1M Tris, 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 30 mM MgCL<sub>2</sub>, pH=8) to 130 μL of sample filtrate.\n7| Add 2 μL of benzonase and 1μL of micrococcal nuclease.\n8| Mix by gently inverting the tubes 3 times.\n9| Incubate for 2h at 37 ̊C\n10| Stop the reaction by adding 7 μL of 10 nM EDTA and freeze samples at –80°C for 24h or preferably proceed for extraction.\n▪ PAUSE POINT\n**Extraction**\n TIMING: 25 min for 1 sample. \n1h30min for 24 samples.",
    "Extraction is performed using the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini kit from Qiagen, without carrier RNA. Change gloves between steps and use aerosol-barrier tips. To avoid contamination do not place tubes immediately next to each other in the rack. Please note that even though it is an RNA extraction kit, DNA will also be extracted.\n11| Mix in an RNAse-free 2 mL tube the following:\n560 μL AVL buffer\n140 μL sample after nuclease treatment\nCRITICAL STEP: Do not add carrier RNA to the AVL buffer. \n12| Mix the mixture by pulse vortexing.\n13| Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\n14| Change gloves.\n15| Briefly centrifuge the mixture with a microcentrifuge.\n16| Add 560 μL of absolute ethanol to the sample mixture.\nCRITICAL STEP: Mix very well by pulse-vortex.\n17| Briefly centrifuge the mixture with a microcentrifuge.\n18| Add 630 μL of the sample mixture to the spin column.\nCRITICAL STEP: Do not touch the column rim with the pipet.\n19| Centrifuge at 6000_g_ for 1 min, change the collection tube and repeat steps 18 and 19. \n20| Add to the spin column the following:\n500 μL AW1 buffer \nCRITICAL STEP: Prepare the AW1 buffer according to the guidelines of the supplier, as it is originally as a concentrate.\n21| Centrifuge at 6000_g_ for 1 min, change the collection tube.\n22| Add to the spin column the following:\n500 μL AW2 buffer \nCRITICAL STEP: Prepare the AW2 buffer, as it is originally as a concentrate.\n23| Centrifuge at 20 000_g_ for 3 min, change the collection tube.\n24| Centrifuge at 20 000_g_ for 1 min.

    "CRITICAL STEP: Pipet the AVE buffer directly onto the filter membrane without touching it with the pipet tip.\n26| Centrifuge at 6000g for 1 min.\n27| Store viral RNA and DNA at –80°C.\n▪ PAUSE POINT\n**Amplification** \n TIMING: 3h30\nAmplification is performed using a modified WTA2 \\(Complete Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit) protocol from Sigma Aldrich.\nCRITICAL STEP: The number of cycles chosen depends on the input material. Typically we recommend 17 cycles, however for samples with expected low viral DNA and RNA content, an increase to 22 cycles should be considered. Similarly for samples with a high level of input material, 12 cycles can be used.\n29| Mix 0.5 μL of Library Synthesis Solution with 2.82 μL of extracted viral sample by pipetting and incubate in a thermocycler programmed for 95°C for 2 minutes then cool down to 18°C.\n30| To the cooled-primed DNA and RNA \\(18°C) sample, immediately add the following:\n0.78 μL RNAse free water\n0.5 μL Library Synthesis Buffer\n0.4 μL Library Synthesis Enzyme\n31| Mix and incubate in a thermocycler programmed for:\n18°C for 10 minutes \n25°C for 10 minutes \n37°C for 30 minutes \n42°C for 10 minutes \n70°C for 20 minutes \n4°C\n32| To the DNA library add the following mix to each sample:\n7.5 μL Amplification mix \n60.2 μL RNAse free water\n1.5 μL WTA dNTP mix \n0.75 μL Amplification enzyme \n33| Mix by pipetting and incubate in a thermocycler programmed for:\n94°C for 2 minutes.\n**94°C for 30 seconds**\n**70°C for 5 minutes**   **x17 cycles**\n34| Purify the PCR product using any standard PCR purification kit.

    "CRITICAL STEP: Make a dilution from the WTA2 purified product according to the Qubit measurement to 1.2 ng/μl to be used as input material.\nCRITICAL STEP: The number of cycles chosen \\(15) and the extension time depends on the input material and the optimal fragment size. In this protocol, the tagmentation time was decreased from 5 to 4 min \\(resulting in longer fragments) and the PCR extension was increased to 45 sec. Consider testing other combinations of conditions for optimal results with your specific samples.
