    "Proteome Harvest\nThe present protocol allows for the enrichment of C–terminal peptides from complex cellular proteomes. Stable isotope labeling is optionally incorporated to allow for the quantitative comparison of C-termini from different samples. \n1. Lyse cells in 100 mM 4-\\(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid \\(HEPES), pH 7.5 in the presence of 1 µg/ml of DNAse I and RNAse A and the following protease inhibitors: 1 mM trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido\\(4-guanidino)butane \\(E-64), 10 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride \\(PMSF), and 1 mM ortho-phenanthroline. Lysis methods such as ultrasonication or freeze–thaw cycles can be employed.\n  Keep samples separate in experiments where comparisons will be made.\n2. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min and proceed with supernatant.\n  3. Determine protein concentration and use 2 mg as starting material.\n  4. Add guanidine hydrochloride to a final concentration of 2.0 M.\n  \nProtection of Sulfhydryls and Primary Amines\n5. Reduce disulfide bonds by incubation with 20 mM dithiothreitol \\(DTT, final concentration) for 30 – 60 min at 70 °C.\n  6. Protect free sulfhydryls by incubation with 50 mM iodoacetamide \\(final concentration) for 3 h at 25 °C.\n  7. Quench unreacted iodoacetamide by incubation with 5 – 10 mM DTT \\(final concentration) for 30 min at 25 °C.\n  8. Protect primary amines by dimethylation using 20 mM formaldehyde \\(final concentration) and 20 mM NaCNBH3 \\(ALD coupling solution, final concentration) for 16 h at 25 °C.\n  In case of a comparative experiment, label one sample with light formaldehyde \\(d\\(0)C12) and one sample with heavy formaldehyde \\(d\\(2)C13) \\(Cambridge Isotopes).\n9. Precipitate proteins by addition of 15 % \\(v/v, final concentration) trichloracetic acid \\(TCA).\n  10. Incubate on ice for 1 h.\n  11. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min, keep pellet and discard supernatant.\n  12. Wash pellet three times with –20 °C cold methanol. If pellet loosens, repeat centrifugation.\n  \nProtection of Carboxyls",
    "13. Resolubilize proteins in 200 mM 2-\\(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid \\(MES), pH 5.0, 2.0 M guanidine hydrochloride, 1.0 M ethanolamine. Incubate in an ultrasonication bath to enhance resolubilization.\n  14. Check that pH equals 5.0 and adjust if required.\n  15. Add 10 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide \\(NHS) and 20 mM 1-ethyl-3-\\[3-dimethylamino-propyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride \\(EDC).\n  16. After 1 min incubation, check that pH equals 5.0 and adjust if required.\n  17. Incubate for 1 h at 25 °C. \n  18. Repeat EDC step – including pH control – twice, with the last incubation lasting 16 h.\n  19. Precipitate proteins by addition of 15 % \\(v/v, final concentration) TCA.\n  20. Incubate on ice for 1 h.\n  21. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min, keep pellet and discard supernatant.\n  22. Wash pellet three times with –20 °C cold methanol. If pellet loosens, repeat centrifugation.\n  \nTrypsin Digestion and Chemical Protection of new N Termini\n23. Resuspend proteins in a minimal volume of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2.0 M guanidine hydrochloride. Incubate in an ultrasonication bath to improve resolubilization.\n  24. Reduce guanidine hydrochloride concentration to 0.5 M by addition of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5.\n  25. Determine protein concentration.\n  26. Add sequencing-grade trypsin at a ratio of 1:100 \\(w/w, trypsin/total protein) and incubate for 16 h at 37 °C.\n  27. After digestion, protect neo-N-termini of internal peptides by reductive dimethylation with 20 mM \\(final concentration) formaldehyde and 20 mM \\(final concentration) NaCNBH3 and incubation for 6 – 16 h at 37 °C. \n  In case of a comparative experiment, label one sample with light formaldehyde \\(d\\(0)C12) and one sample with heavy formaldehyde \\(d\\(2)C13) formaldehyde \\(Cambridge Isotopes). Use the same labeling scheme as in step 8. After amine protection, mix samples at equal abundance. \nDepletion of Internal and N-terminal Peptides",
    "28. Prepare a 2 mM stock solution of poly-allylamine \\(average molecular weight ~56 kDa, Sigma) in 200 mM MES pH 5.0, 2 M guanidine hydrochloride, 20 % \\(v/v) acetonitrile.\n  29. Check that pH of poly-allylamine stock equals 5.0 and adjust if required.\n  30. Add one volume of poly-allylamine stock to the tryptic digest to reach a final poly-allylamine concentration of 1 mM. \n  31. Add 10 mM NHS and 50 mM EDC \\(final concentrations).\n  32. After 1 min incubation, check that pH equals 5.0 and adjust if required.\n  33. Incubate for 3 h at 25 °C. \n  34. Repeat EDC step – including pH control – twice, with the last incubation lasting 16 h.\n  35. Pass polymer / tryptic digestion mixture through a 10-kDa cut-off Microcon filter device \\(Millipore). Due to the hygroscopicity of poly-allylamine, the ultrafiltration step can be lengthy. Keep the filtrate, which contains uncoupled, C-terminal peptides.\n  36. Repeat ultrafiltration step twice with 500 μl water.\n  37. Pool the three filtrates and desalt using C18 solid phase extraction columns.\n  38. Determine peptide concentration.\n  \nLiquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry and Data Analysis\n39. Analyze C-terminal peptides by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry \\(LC-MS/MS). Standard LC-MS/MS settings for peptide/proteome analysis are employed. These settings are machine specific and not within the scope of this protocol.",
    "40. Spectrum-to-sequence assignment using an appropriate software such as Mascot \\[16] or X\\!Tandem \\[17]. Since trypsin does not cleave at dimethylated lysines, set cleavage-specificity as C-terminal to arginine \\(ArgC-like specificity). Apply semi-style cleavage searches with up to three missed cleavages. Set static modifications as carboxyamidomethylation of cysteine residues \\(+57.02 Da), dimethylation of lysines and amino termini \\(+28.03 Da for normal isotope abundance; 34.06 Da for d\\(2)C13 formaldehyde), and ethanolamine-modification \\(+43.04 Da) for aspartate and glutamate residues as well as peptide C-termini. For quantitative comparison with stable isotope labeling, use software tools like XPRESS \\[18] to determine Heavy:Light \\(H/L) ratios."
