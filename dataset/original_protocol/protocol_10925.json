    "The protocol being described in this article follows the protocol used in the previously published study that abided by the ethical standards for human research of the Internal Review Boards of Texas Woman's University and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, USA26.\n1. Participant Screening and Study Preparation\nScreen all participants for inclusion and exclusion criteria by phone, and then ask them again about these criteria while in person during the approved informed consent process.\n\t\nAsk the participants about their polio history and whether they have been diagnosed with PPS.\nAsk if the participants have any concern about being able to bear weight through their lower extremities (LEs) at least 20 min in short blocks of time.\nReview the exclusion criteria commonly reported in the literature and used in the previously published study26 for appropriateness for a future study.\n\tNOTE: Typical exclusion criteria are body weight more than 227 kg (vibration platform maximum), current medical conditions such as cancer, infection, wound, fracture, thrombosis/embolism, epilepsy, severe migraine headaches, severe vestibular conditions, discopathy, spondylolysis, or implanted devices, metal fixators or joints.\n\t\nCheck the weight limit of the selected or available vibration platform, and weigh the participants in person if they appear close to that body weight maximum.\n\t\tNOTE: A typical bathroom scale may not measure weights high enough. Many vibration platforms have weight limits of 227 kg or 500 lbs.\nDetermine the inclusion criteria that will be specific to the target population and clinical or laboratory setting. If a physician is not on the study team, consider requiring the participants to seek medical approval from their personal physician, for reasons similar to someone starting a new exercise program.",
    "NOTE: In the previously reported study26, the participants were English speaking survivors of polio, with or without PPS, 40–85 years of age, and able to weight bear through their LEs up to 20 min. Note that their ability to walk was not an inclusion criterion.\nDocument the reasons why the individuals do not agree to participate in the study and why they withdraw, if that occurs. Determine if the withdrawals need to be reported to the Internal Review Board of the institution or facility.\nExplain to the participants what the experimental design is (in lay terms), what to expect in terms of time commitment per session, how many sessions, and how many weeks or months the study will last.\nExplain to the participants that they will be standing up or weight bearing on the vibration platform for several short bouts for each session and what the vibration will feel like.\n\t\nShow the participants the vibration platform. If the participants seem hesitant during the informed consent process and baseline testing, offer to turn on the platform to show the participants how it works. Inquire if he or she wishes to try it briefly prior to starting the intervention in the next session.\n2. Experimental Design\nUse random assignment to groups, if possible. If a randomized controlled study is selected, consider offering a delayed-start intervention for the control group to help avoid disappointment or attrition due to the lack of interest.",
    "NOTE: The previously conducted study used a random-order cross-over experimental design with two weeks for a wash-out period and a two-week follow-up period; therefore, all participants received the same dosage or amount of vibration intervention with treatment block order randomized (low intensity first/high intensity second or high intensity first/low intensity second). No control group was used due to anticipated small sample size26.\nIf the participants will use any type of written log for the symptoms such as cramping or activity levels, provide the log for them in paper or electronic version, based upon their preference. Request their log each week to help them keep up with their documentation and to avoid recall bias issues.\nBuild in a follow-up period with repeat testing in the study design to see if any changes persist.\nBe available by email or phone for questions or concerns that may arise during the study period.\n3. WBV Interventions\nSchedule the sessions with at least one day off in between sessions, two to three times per week to avoid undue fatigue or muscle soreness.\n\t\nSelect the number of weeks of intervention based upon the current literature and the outcome measures selected.\n\t\tNOTE: Because the previous study was a feasibility study, two four-week intervention blocks with treatment order randomized were used to determine if the WBV would be a safe and tolerable method to achieve weight bearing exercise26. Gains in bone mineral density will require months, whereas other gains can occur immediately or in days or weeks.\nInstruct the participants to stand on the WBV platform with the knees slightly bent and weight as evenly distributed between their two LEs as possible27,28. Allow the participants to support themselves with their arms, as needed, for balance during the vibration and when stepping up and down from the platform.",
    "If the person is not able to stand at all or stand long enough, allow him or her to sit in a chair or wheelchair, with the feet on the platform, forearms resting on thighs, leaning forward to achieve as much weight bearing through the lower body as possible, still keeping the feet on the platform.\n\t\nIf the motorized wheelchair has a seat elevator, raise the seat as high as possible.\nIf the person will be sitting in a standard chair, ask him or her to sit on some folded blankets or pillows to raise the hips up into a higher position.\n\t\tNOTE: The closer the LEs are to a standing position, the more weight bearing will occur through the LEs to enhance vibration stimulation into the body.\nAsk the participants to remove their shoes and LE orthoses (braces) and wear socks (for cleanliness) during the vibration. Offer socks with rubber treads on them if the person is not wearing socks or is apprehensive of standing or stepping on the tile floor of the lab.\n\t\nExplain to the participants that wearing only socks on their feet will enhance their nerve stimulation to their muscles, spinal cord, and brain for peak effectiveness.\nExplain to the participants that the orthoses are to be removed because the vibration may cause rubbing between the orthosis and their skin, putting them at risk for skin breakdown. Inform the participants that it may also cause hardware loosening of metal components of the braces.\nEncourage each person to move into his or her optimal alignment.\n\tNOTE: For people with significant LE weakness on one or both sides, they may not be able to weight bear symmetrically or stand with knees flexed, especially without their orthoses.",
    "Use a wedge or cuff weight under the heel to accommodate leg length discrepancies or plantarflexor contractures, if necessary, to allow weight bearing through as much of the plantar surface of the foot as possible.\nStart with ten 1 min vibration bouts, with 1 min sitting rest periods between the vibration bouts. Increase to ten 2 min vibration bouts, and do not change the rest periods unless needed or requested by the participant. See Table 1 for a typical intervention progression.\n\t\nTake the person’s vital signs.\nObserve this person who had polio as a child step up onto the platform used for the low intensity protocol.\nInstruct the person to stand with the knees slightly bent, weight as evenly spread between two feet as possible.\nTell the person that he/she can hold onto the handle if he/she needs to balance, but to hold it as lightly as possible.\nInform the person that he/she will feel the vibration in the soles of his/her feet, radiating up into his/her body.\nAsk the person if he/she is ready to start, and when he/she says yes, turn on the machine.\nUse a timer set for 1 min for the first session if the platform does not have a preset time choice.\nAfter 1 min of vibration has ended, ask the person to sit down for 1 min to rest, setting a timer, offering to answer any questions he/she may have.\nAfter the 1 min rest, ask the person if he/she is ready to step up and resume the vibration. If so, continue for total of 10 repetitions of vibration.\nIf the person is not ready to continue, ask why, and provide more rest, as needed. Document how much rest time is required, if different than the established protocol.",
    "Repeat this sequence with the higher intensity protocol, but inform the person that the intensity is higher, and he/she may feel it spread higher into his or her body.\n\t\t\nConversely, if using a two-intensity protocol and the person starts with the higher intensity intervention first, warn him/her that the second lower intensity will be quite gentle compared to what he/she is used to.\n\t\t\tNote: The platform used for higher intensity vibration actually elevated a little, and it gradually lowered during the preset time. As it reached the end of the time, returning to the starting position, the vibration intensifies, so inform the participant that this phenomenon will occur beforehand to avoid undue concern.\nWBV intensity and equipment\n\t\nUse a medium to higher intensity (peak to peak vertical displacement 8.82 mm, 35 Hz, and g force 2.76) vibration to allow significant effects. Depending on the targeted population and selected outcome measures, choose more or less aggressive settings.\n\t\tNOTE: The previously published study26 used settings in an attempt to simulate that reported for bone mineral density studies, thinking ahead to possible future studies. The second platform listed in the Table of Materials was used for this intensity. It is a commercial grade platform that was available in the research lab of Texas Woman’s University. The settings used were 35 Hz, “low amplitude”, and desired time.\nBecause low intensity (peak to peak vertical displacement 4.53 mm, 24 Hz, g force 2.21) vibration did not cause any significant changes, do not use this intensity or less unless the targeted study population is very frail, fearful, or both. Then if the participants are able to tolerate this intensity, gradually increase it for each person.",
    "NOTE: The first platform listed in the Table of Materials was used for this intensity. It was purchased for the original study through Post-Polio Health International. It is a unit designed for home or personal use. It has no handles, and a grab rail was installed on the laboratory wall to ensure safety. This platform had a rotating dial, and the lowest setting was selected. A separate timer was used for on and off times.\nIdeally, select a vibration platform that the amplitude and frequency can be set independently for individualization to the unique needs of the study population. See Table of Materials for the vibration platforms used in the previously reported study26.\n\t\tNOTE: Both units used for the reported study had synchronous vertical displacement during vibration. Some units have asynchronous vertical displacement, rotating over a center; in these, the wider the person’s base of support is [feet further from center], the more intense the vibration16.\nUse an independent accelerometer to determine peak to peak displacement, frequency, and g forces.\n\t\tNOTE: Manufacturers may not provide all required information, and it is needed for accurate reporting of methods and equipment used16. G forces reported above were measured by an accelerometer listed in Table of Materials.\nWhen reporting the amplitude of vibration platforms, be careful with the terminology due to inconsistencies in the literature.\n\t\tNOTE: The term amplitude is to be used for equilibrium point to peak displacement. Although the term peak to peak displacement is synonymous with peak to peak amplitude, and this value will be twice that of traditional amplitude, the use of peak to peak displacement is preferred to avoid confusion16.\n4. Participant Testing",
    "Take heart rate and blood pressure prior to all testing and intervention sessions, especially if working with people with neurologic conditions. Keep in mind that hypertension is considered a “silent killer” and that many people may have this problem and not be aware of it or fail to take prescribed medications for it.\n\t\nTake the participants’ vital signs again, after at least the first few sessions to ensure safety, and during sessions if the participants experience symptoms that could indicate excessive exertion or abnormal responses to vibration.\nAsk the participants to report perceived exertion with a standardized scale, after each intervention session.\n\tNOTE: Borg’s rating of perceived exertion [RPE] is widely used and has sound psychometric properties29.\nTo reduce testing bias, have a licensed physical therapist blinded to intervention administer selected outcome measures pre and post each intervention block and at the end of the follow-up period.\n\tNOTE: A double blinded study with vibration interventions will be difficult to conduct because the participants will be able to feel the vibration.\nSelect reliable and valid outcome measures that address more than one domain (body functions and structure, activities, and participation) of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) of the targeted population30.\n\t\nWhen available, use measures that have sound psychometric properties for the population. For less common populations, use more generic measures or ones that have been tested for populations similar in some way. Consider the use of the following outcome measures for survivors of polio, although none were developed specifically for them.\nMeasure physical performance of gait speed by 10 m walk test (10mWT)31 and gait endurance by 2 min walk test32.",
    "Administer surveys to determine pain severity and interference by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)33,34, sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index35, and fatigue by the Fatigue Severity Scale36,37.\nMeasure LE strength by manual muscle test and handheld dynamometry38,39,40.\nProvide log forms or calendar for participants to document muscle cramping incidence.\n\t\tNOTE: No sensory outcome measures were selected in the previously reported study due to the fact that sensory impairments in polio survivors occur only in the presence of other medical conditions or comorbidities. The original poliomyelitis infection affected the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord (lower motor neurons) impacting motor function while preserving sensory function17,18."
