Here, you can continue processing the sample in multiple ways prior to Micro-C sequencing library generation, depending on the desired experimental design. Micro-C has been successfully carried out using three chromatin preps: 1) Total chromatin. 2) Supernatant. 3) Pellet. Any of these fractions can be subjected to the following Micro-C protocol, although we note that optimal signal-to-noise is achieved using relatively insoluble \\(Pellet) chromatin.\n  \n**V.
