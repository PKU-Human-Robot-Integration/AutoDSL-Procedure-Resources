    "Preparation prior to isolation70% ethanol (see Recipe 1).Autoclave 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Sterilize tools with 70% ethanol.Collagen type I to coat cell culture plate (see Recipe 2).Matrigel to coat cell culture plate (see Recipe 3).Plate coatingCoat 100 mm plates with 5 ml of collagen type I to cover the plate completely for 30 min at room temperature. After 30 min, transfer collagen type I to the original tube, and air-dry the plate. The plate can be stored in A2 biosafety cabinet until ready to use. This plate will be used for pre-plating.Note: Collagen type I can be reused for future use. Coat 60 mm plates with 3 ml of Matrigel to cover the plate completely for 20 min at room temperature. After 20 min, transfer Matrigel to the original tube, and air-dry the plate. It is recommended to use the plate right after Matrigel is dried out. This plate will be used for differentiation of myoblasts.Note: Matrigel can be reused for future use. Digestion medium (see Recipe 4).Neutralization medium (see Recipe 5).Growth medium (see Recipe 6).Differentiation medium (see Recipe 7).0.05% trypsin (see Recipe 8).4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation solution (see Recipe 9).100 mM glycine solution (see Recipe 10).Blocking buffer (see Recipe 11).bFGF (see Recipe 12).PBS-T (see Recipe 13).Muscle dissectionSacrifice a mouse aged 4-6 weeks following the approved protocol in your laboratory. In this case, cervical dislocation is used.Note: Dissection of a mouse does not need to be performed inside an A2 biosafety cabinet. Spray the mouse with 70% ethanol and pin the mouse face up on a dissection board.Cut the skin at the ankle using sterilized scissors. With the mouse in a transverse abdominal position, use tweezers to expose the quadricep muscle. Collect muscles in cold PBS. Flip the mouse and pin it with its back facing up.",
    "Remove the skin on lower body, dissect two entire hind limb skeletal muscles and place them in cold PBS.Transfer the dissection tools and the plate containing muscle to a biosafety cabinet. Wipe all dissection tools with 70% ethanol to avoid potential contamination from outside of the biosafety cabinet. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Muscle dissection of mouse. This video demonstrates a detailed procedure of how to isolate hind limb muscles, as well as how to remove the epimysium and fat around the muscle and the neural bundles within the muscle. After transferring the muscle to a 60 mm plate containing PBS, it was washed several times in PBS, minced with a pair of scissors or a razor blade, and digested by collagenase type II to liberate MuSCs from myofibers.Muscle digestionWash hind limb muscles with PBS until muscles are free of hair.Note: It is recommended to wash several times until hair is completely removed from muscle tissue. Blot dry muscles on tissue paper.Transfer muscle to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Mince the muscle using dissection scissors inside a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Note: Finely minced muscle will yield more myoblasts. Transfer the minced muscle into a 15 ml Falcon tube.Digest the muscle with digestion medium (5 ml per mouse) in a 37 °C water bath for 12 min, shaking the tube every 2 min.Mix the digested muscle with a 10 ml serological pipette until the mixture can be smoothly pipetted.Digest for another 12 min in the 37 °C water bath, shaking the tube every 2 min.Stop digestion by adding 5 ml neutralization medium.Place a 70 µm sterilized cell strainer on top of a 50 ml tube, and pre-wet the strainer with 3 ml neutralization medium.Note: Pre-wetting is important for cells to pass smoothly through the cell strainer.",
    "Collect the media containing cell mixture using a 10 ml serological pipette and filter through the 70 µm sterilized cell strainer.Note: Collect cell filtrate underneath cell strainer using 1 ml pipette. Spin the cell mixture at 2,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Discard the supernatant using a vacuum pipette.Note: Do not aspirate the cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet with 5 ml growth medium.Seed the cells from one mouse in a non-coated 100 mm culture plate and incubate at 37 °C for 4 days, and supplement 5 ml of growth medium on top of pre-existing medium each day for 3 days.Note: A heterogeneous population of cell mixture and broken fibers will be visualized under a microscope on Day 4.Primary myoblast isolation and pre-platingOn Day 4, small fibers pieces with rounded primary myoblasts can be seen, and cells are now ready for pre-plating.Mechanically detach cells attached to the bottom of plate by pipetting using a 10 ml serological pipette and transfer to a 50 ml tube. Floating cells are also transferred to the 50 ml tube.Notes: This method only utilizes mechanical detachment, therefore trypsin is not necessary. Confirm if most cells were detached from the plate by checking under a microscope. Centrifuge the 50 ml tube at 2,000 x g for 5 min.Note: Let centrifuge stop without applying brake. This usually takes a couple of minutes. Aspirate the media from the 50 ml tube.Add 3 ml trypsin into the 50 ml tube and resuspend cells carefully and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min.Note: Cells are still heterogeneous population. Centrifuge the 50 ml tube at 2,000 x g for 5 min.",
    "Discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and resuspend the cells with 5 ml of growth mediumTransfer to a non-coated culture plate and incubate at 37 °C incubator for 45 min.After 45 min, transfer supernatant from the non-coated culture plate to collagen-coated plate.Note: Myoblasts do not adhere to the culture plate in a short time, therefore, transferring supernatant media helps to purify myoblast from other cells such as fibroblasts in the bottom of the plate. Steps D2-D9 (Pre-plating) can be repeated multiple times to obtain ≥ 95% purity of myoblasts.Note: Pre-plating can be repeated twice to increase myoblast purity. Myoblasts should appear small and rounded, while fibroblasts will appear elongated and at times have bipolar processes.Culturing and differentiation Culture the purified primary myoblasts in the growth medium, changing the media every 2 days. Maintain the cell density under 80% confluency to prevent the fusion of primary myoblasts.Note: Collagen type I coated plate is not required after pre-plating step. Prior to differentiation, coat a 60 mm culture plate with 3 ml of Matrigel for 20 min in the hood at room temperature.After removing Matrigel, allow for complete evaporation in the hood for 30 min.Note: It is not recommended to reuse Matrigel more than 5 times and should be stored at 4 °C or on ice when not in use. Incubate cells with 1 ml trypsin for 1 min at room temperature to detach primary myoblasts and seed cells onto Matrigel coated plate.Note: Primary myoblasts are cultured on Matrigel coated plate with 4 ml of growth medium until the desired cell density is reached. Once the confluency reaches 80-90%, change myoblast medium to differentiation medium.Maintain primary myoblasts with differentiation medium for the following three days.Note: Daily monitoring morphological change of primary myoblasts under a microscope is necessary.",
    "Clear morphological change from rounded primary myoblasts to elongated myotubes can be observed on Day 3.Immunostaining of Primary MyoblastsPlace an autoclaved cover slide in a well of a 6-well plate.Seed myoblasts on the autoclaved cover slideNotes: Adherent myoblasts should be visible on the cover slide the following day. Myoblasts can be cultured several days to the desired confluence. Aspirate growth medium from the culture plate.Fix adherent cells by adding 1 ml of 4% PFA and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Aspirate 4% PFA from the culture plate.Gently wash 3 times with 1 ml of PBS for 5 min each at room temperature.Aspirate PBS from the culture plate.Add 1 ml of 100 mM glycine and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Remove 100 mM glycine and wash with 1 ml PBS for 5 min at room temperature.Repeat Step 9 for a total of 3 washes.Add 1 ml of blocking buffer and incubate for 1-2 h at room temperature.Add appropriate amount of primary antibody (Pax7-1:10, MyoD-1:300 in blocking buffer) and incubate overnight at 4 °C.Gently wash 3 times each with 1ml of PBS-T for 5 min at room temperature.Add appropriate amount of secondary antibody (Goat anti-mouse IgG1 for Pax7, MyoG, Goat anti-mouse IgG2b for MyoD, Goat anti-Rabbit IgG for MF20, DAPI-1:1,000 in PBS-T) at room temperature for 1 h.Note: Secondary antibodies are sensitive to light, so the steps below should be performed in a dark room. Gently wash 5 times each with 1 ml of PBS-T for 5 min at room temperature.Note: More washing is recommended to minimize background staining. Mount the coverslip with a drop of mounting medium and allow to dry.Evaluate staining under a fluorescent microscope."
