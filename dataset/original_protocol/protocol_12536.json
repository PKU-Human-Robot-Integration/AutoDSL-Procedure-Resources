    "All experiments are approved by the Animal Experiment Board of the University of Eastern Finland. This protocol describes a clinically relevant treadmill exercise test for pigs to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapies for heart diseases. Female domestic pigs weighing 25-80 kg were used for the present study. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Setting up the running track\nSet up the running track so that animals can only move one way. Use gates and hatches to prevent the animals from moving back. The floor plan of the running track is shown in Figure 1, and an example of a running track is in Figure 2.\nEnsure the treadmill (see Table of Materials) has enough space to allow incline changes.\nEnsure the treadmill has an adjustable width to prevent the animal from turning during the run.\nUse transparent plastic to make the front wall of the treadmill. This prevents the animal from running away from the treadmill, but still allows the animal to see through the wall.\n\tNOTE: It is essential that the animals can see through the front wall, as our experience suggests that pigs are more motivated to run if they see their fellow pigs on the other side of the wall.\nPlace an ECG monitor and defibrillator (see Table of Materials) next to the treadmill.\n\tNOTE: Fatal arrhythmias may occur during the stress test, especially if the pig has myocardial ischemia14,15,16.\nEnsure the running track includes a water point where the animals can drink and cool off after the run.\n2. Acclimation period of the pigs before the test\nHouse the animals for 2 weeks before starting the experiments.",
    "During the 1st week of acclimation, ensure the animals get accustomed to their handlers and new housing environment, excluding the running track.\nDuring the 2nd week of the acclimation period, ensure the animals get accustomed to the running track.\nStart accustoming so that the animals get familiar with the running track. First, keep all the gates open, so the animals can walk freely on the track and explore the environment.\nWhen the animals are more familiar with the track, turn on the treadmill and let the animal run for short periods at a time, such as 7 min. The length of the running times must be extended daily.\n\t​NOTE: Remember to reward the animals during the acclimation period. For example, the pigs were rewarded with unsalted popcorn in the present study.\n3. The exercise test\nNOTE: Pigs should be fasted at least 2 h before the exercise test or given only a tiny portion of food before the run.\nTurn on the treadmill and set the incline to 5%-10%.\nAs soon as the animal is on the treadmill, start the treadmill with a starting speed of 2 km/h.\nIncrease the speed by 0.5 km/h every 60 s until 5 km/h is reached. The total running time is 15 min.\nIn case the animal cannot run the entire time at the maximum speed, perform the steps below.\n\t\nIf the pig is not running as fast as a selected speed, gently push it from the back, as this may give the animal the feeling that it needs to run faster without slowing down.\nTry gently pushing the animal a maximum of three times; after that, slow down the speed by 0.5 km/h at a time until the pig can handle the speed. Do not slow down to below 2 km/h.",
    "If the animal refuses to run even at a slow speed, turn off the treadmill and stop the test.\n4. ECG monitoring during the exercise test\nPlace ECG electrodes (see Table of Materials) in anatomical locations which have minimal movement during the run, such as scapulas or the chest.\n\tNOTE: Use ECG electrodes designed for exercise tests to achieve better adhesion to the skin. Remember to shave hair from the area where the ECG electrodes will be placed.\nRecord the heart rate changes during the run.\n\t​NOTE: Our experience suggests that ST segment analyses are often complicated due to movement and other artifacts. Rhythm monitoring can also be done using an implantable loop recorder or pacemaker.\n5. Data collection\nRecord the run distance, total time, and speed every time the speed is changed.\n\tNOTE: Modern treadmills may collect a lot of other data, so it is essential to familiarize yourself with the treadmill manual to utilize the equipment's full potential.\nNote possible changes in animal behavior, such as limping.\n\tNOTE: If needed, contact a veterinarian and make sure that the animal receives necessary analgesia. Remove the animal from future exercises until it fully recovers.\n6. Post-procedural care\nEnsure the animal has access to the water point.\nReward the animal, for example, with treats or toys.\nMonitor the animal for 30 min after the run for possible adverse effects.\nSubscription Required.
