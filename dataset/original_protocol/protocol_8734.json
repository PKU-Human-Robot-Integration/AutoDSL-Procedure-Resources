    "Ethics Statement:\nThe work involved a routine trapping method of free-living small passerines approved by the British Trust for Ornithology and the capture protocol eliciting a mild stress in the bird was carried out under UK Home Office licenses.\n1. Set-up for Filming\nCreate a filming set-up where birds are encouraged to position themselves in front of the camera (Figure 1). The bird enters the set-up through a hole in one end wall and has access to food close to the opposite end wall.\nIn order to habituate the birds to the set-up, provide a suitable food (e.g., peanut kernels) at the feeder for several weeks prior to recording. Apart from provision of the food, leave the set-up undisturbed. During this period, place a dummy tripod in front of the feeder to allow the birds to also habituate to the camera.\nOn the day of recording, reduce the availability of peanut kernels in the set-up by removing all remaining food from the feeder and replacing it with food contained in a transparent container with only a small hole at the center on the top through which birds can access the food. Position this food container in the center of the cage at the end opposite to the entrance hole.\nPlace a small square of black insulation tape of known emissivity to that of natural integument in one of the corners of the mesh of the box so it appears in all images. Attach the black insulation tape to a thermocouple connected with a temperature logger that records the temperature of the black insulation tape with a resolution of 0.1 °C every 1 sec.",
    "Place the thermal imaging camera 50 cm from the center of the box trap so that all of the box fits within the camera’s field of view, and birds feeding from the clear container will be positioned in the camera’s zone of focus. Connect the camera to a laptop, set the camera to record images at on average of 7.5 frames per second (with a time stamp), and send images to the laptop’s hard disk to be saved there.\nAttach a fishing line to the rotating door of the set-up and roll it out to a position where the experimenter is hidden from view of the birds, but the set-up can still be observed — about 20 m from the set-up.\n2. Filming the Bird’s Response to a Mild Acute Stress\nOnce a bird enters the feeding box, leave the bird undisturbed in the box for ca. 5 sec.\nPull the fishing line after the bird had spent ca. 5 sec in the box to close the feeding box. Take care that the bird is still at the far end of the box in order to minimize the risk of injury to the bird.\nImmediately approach the feeding box and stand motionless behind the camera for approximately 3 min. Then retrieve the bird from the box and let it go.\n3. Extraction of Eye-region Temperature from Thermal Images\nExtract maximum temperature from each frame. Note: The maximum temperature was virtually always recorded from within the region around the eye, bounded by the exposed skin of the periophthalmic ring (Figure 2), and is hereafter referred to as eye-region temperature.",
    "In the Thermal Imaging Analysis Software right click on image, ‘add’ a new plot for the image maximum. Then, right click on the plot that exports the data (eye-region temperature and the time the frame was taken) to a CSV file.\nDelete from the CSV file all lines from frames where the eye-region of the bird was not visible.\nPlot maximum temperature against time in R 27, identify manually points where temperature spikes > +0.2 ºC between two successive readings when the nictitating membrane was pulled over the eye (blinking) and points with low values outside the range of body temperatures for birds 28 (i.e., when the eye-region was visible but blurred through motion for multiple frames) and then remove the relevant lines from the CSV data file produced during step 3.1.\nMeasure ambient temperature.\n\t\nDownload the data (time and logger temperature) from the temperature logger onto a computer and export into a spreadsheet.\nTo get the ambient temperature from the thermal image, in the Thermal Image Analysis Software draw a square over the black insulation tape that covered the temperature logger probe, then right click on the square and select ‘add new plot' for the square's average temperature.\nThen, right click that plot, to export the data (time and IRT temperature) to a CSV file. Merge the two resulting temperature time series for temperature logger and thermal image matching for time into one spreadsheet.\nCorrect eye-region temperature against ambient temperature. Export the spreadsheet created in step 3.4 into the CSV file matching for time. To each retained eye-region temperature add the difference between the temperature logger and the thermal imaging-derived temperature values (logger temp – IRT temp) measured at the same time.",
    "Carry out automated filtering to remove less accurate low eye-region temperature values using the peak search algorithm (see Supplemental Code File) to extract the highest (and therefore most accurate) points in the data automatically.\n\tNote: The peak search algorithm reorganizes the temperature data into a vector with a user-defined width (span), recommended span = 3, extracting the central value in rows where the numbers either side are lower, i.e., the peaks.\nUse linear interpolation to close the gaps left by sequences when no peak was extracted, and when the eye-region wasn't visible. Use the command na.approx (zoo package v1.7-11 in R 27) to give a single temperature value per second for each individual.\nIn the CVS data file, add a value of 0.2 to each eye-region temperature to correct for the effect of taking the images through a mesh.\n\tNote: Tests showed that when a black body, heated to approximate mean bird body temperature of ~41 ºC in its active phase 28, was imaged through the mesh window with the same mesh size as used in the filming set-up, temperatures recorded by the thermal imaging camera in areas not obscured by the wires were 0.2 ºC lower than values obtained without the intervening mesh (mean difference = -0.2 ºC ± 0.085 SD, n = 30, temperature range of black body = 41.6–42.5 ºC).\n\tNote: This is the correction factor specific to the conditions in this study and is likely to vary with instrument make, and type and width of the mesh between the animal and the camera, and in each situation needs to be established for the specific study conditions.",
    "From the maximum eye-region temperatures recorded from before the box was closed select the highest value, which will constitute the baseline eye-region temperature of the undisturbed bird. Add this baseline eye-region temperature as a new column to the CVS file (baseline). Then subtract the baseline value from each retained maximum eye-region temperature value, generating a new column in the CVS data file.\n\tNote: This new value now express the bird’s response to mild acute stress as deviation from its undisturbed baseline temperature.\nPlot the deviations in maximum eye-region temperature from the baseline eye-region temperature of all individuals from after the trap was closed using the command ggplot (package ggplot2 v1.0.0 in R 27). Generate bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals using the option mean_cl_boot (package ggplot2 v1.0.0 in R 27). For details see the Supplemental Code File."
