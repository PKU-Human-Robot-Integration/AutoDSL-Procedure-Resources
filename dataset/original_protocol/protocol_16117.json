    "The most suitable target tissue for biolistic transformation of Arabidopsis is roots of young seedlings. This is because the root contains a meristematic cell layer, the pericycle, that remains diploid and does not undergo somatic endopolyploidization. By contrast, leaf cells of Arabidopsis exhibit a strong tendency to become polyploid (with the average ploidy level in fully expanded rosette leaves being 13C; Preuten et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0023]). While polyploidy does not pose an obstacle to successful transformation, it leads to problems with plant regeneration, and even if plants can be regenerated, they are usually infertile (Hibberd, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0014]; Sikdar et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0030]; Yu, Lutz, & Maliga, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0038]).",
    "For efficient plastid transformation in Arabidopsis, it is highly recommended that (1) an ecotype that displays good regeneration properties in tissue culture and (2) an ACC2-deficient genotype are used. ACC2 is a nuclear gene encoding an alternative acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) that can partially replace the plastid ACCase under conditions of inhibited plastid gene expression (Parker, Wang, & Meinke, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0020], 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0021]). Expression of ACC2 has been shown to be largely responsible for the low sensitivity of cultured Arabidopsis cells to the plastid translational inhibitor spectinomycin (Parker et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0020], 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0021]). Because the spectinomycin resistance gene aadA is the most efficient selectable marker gene for plastid transformation (Bock, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0005]; Svab & Maliga, 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0033]), the poor inhibition of cell division in the presence of spectinomycin greatly impairs the isolation of transplastomic Arabidopsis cells. This problem was solved by generating an ACC2 knockout line (Δacc2) by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in the easily regenerated Arabidopsis ecotype C24 (Ruf et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0026]). It is recommended that the Δacc2 C24 line be used as the recipient for plastid transformation. The protocol below describes the generation of tissue for biolistic plastid transformation by (1) raising Arabidopsis seedlings under aseptic conditions, (2) harvesting roots, and (3) inducing microcallus tissue from roots for biolistic transformation. If executed with the recommended amount of seeds, the protocol will provide material for up to 70 bombardments (i.e., shots with the biolistic gun), which are sufficient for one chloroplast transformation experiment and two control bombardments with a nuclear transformation vector.\nNOTE: All materials for plant tissue culture (TC) must be sterilized by autoclaving, heat sterilization, or surface sterilization.\nMaterials\nArabidopsis thaliana (At) seeds: cultivar C24, knockout mutant Δacc2\nUltrapure water, autoclaved\nEtOH + detergent solution: 25 ml ethanol (70%, v/v, tech. grade) plus 0.75 ml Tween 20 (10%, w/v)",

Prepare hypochlorite + detergent solution by combining 40 ml NaOCl (cold) and 1.2 ml Tween 20 (10%, w/v).\n5. At this point, all work should be done in the sterile laminar flow hood.\n6. Remove EtOH + detergent solution from seeds with a 5-ml pipet.\n7. Add cold hypochlorite + detergent solution to the seeds (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0002]).\n8. Incubate 17 min with shaking (disc rotary mixer in the cold room at 4°C).\n9. Remove hypochlorite + detergent solution with a 5-ml pipet. If you are not done after 3 min (i.e., 20 min after start of incubation), quickly add 2 volumes of sterile water to dilute the NaOCl (and prevent killing the seeds).\n10. Wash seeds with water by adding 30 ml sterile water. Mix by inverting. Wait a short time until the seeds sink to the bottom.

Spread (with the scalpel) each aliquot of root material onto the net in the center of an AtCIM plate.\nThe root material should form a thin homogeneous layer in a circle of ∼30 mm diameter (Fig. 3J[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003], K[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]).\n28. Close plate with the lid and seal it with medical tape (Fig. 3L[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003]).\n29. Number individual plates, so that you know which root plate originates from which germination plate (e.g., “Root plate 1-1”)\nMicrocallus induction\n30. Put AtCIM plates with the root material into a black cardboard box for dark incubation.\n31. Incubate plates for 5 days in darkness: 16 hr dark at 25°C/8 hr dark at 20°C before proceeding to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-prot-0002].\nThe hormones in the AtCIM will induce cell division and callus formation. Pay attention to the maximum time span of 5 days. Longer incubation times on callus induction medium (CIM) increase the risk of regenerating chimeric plants and greatly decrease the efficiency of shoot induction. Avoid accumulation of condensed water in the lid of the root plates.",
    "Particle gun-mediated transformation (also known as biolistic transformation) represents a nearly universally applicable method for the introduction of foreign DNA into cells and subcellular compartments (Altpeter et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0002]). It is also the method of choice for the transformation of the plastid genome (Bock, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0003], 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0005]; Maliga, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0017]). Although a few alternative methods for plastid transformation have been proposed, most of them have not been shown to produce stable transplastomic plants. The only exception is PEG-mediated transformation, which, however, is inefficient and available only in those (few) species in which plants can be efficiently regenerated from protoplasts. For plastid transformation of Arabidopsis, biolistic transformation is currently the only option.\nNOTE: General information: All materials that will be in contact with the plant tissue must be sterilized by autoclaving, heat sterilization, or surface sterilization.\nMaterials\nGold particles, 0.6 µm diameter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652262)\nEthanol p. a., 100%, water free\nUltrapure water, autoclaved\nChloroplast transformation vector: plasmid DNA, concentration 1.8-2.2 µg/µl purified by NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit for transfection-grade plasmid DNA (Macherey-Nagel, 740410.50)\nNuclear transformation vector for kanamycin selection (e.g., pGreen0029GFP) as control for transformation efficiency\nCaCl2, 2.5 M, cooled to −20°C\nSpermidine (free base), 100 mM stock solution (Duchefa, S 1369)\nEthanol p. a., for surface sterilization of the gun supplies\nHigh-quality 1.5-ml reaction tubes, to minimize gold particle adherence to the wall (e.g., Eppendorf, DNA LoBind, 0030 108.051)\nHigh-quality pipet tips, to minimize gold particle adherence\nTable-top centrifuge, e.g., Eppendorf MiniSpin Plus, with rotor F-45-12-11 (maximum centrifuging radius: 6 cm)\nTest tube shaker (e.g., vortex mixer)\nBox with crushed ice\nWaste containers (e.g., beakers) for discarded supernatants\nHelium-driven particle gun PDS-1000/He (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and vacuum pump\nMacrocarriers (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652335)\nRupture disks 1,800 psi (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652332)\nStopping screens (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1652336)\nGlass Petri dishes, 140-150 mm, sterile",

The typical chloroplast transformation experiment involves the bombardment of 20 to 30 root plates by 49 to 70 mono shots with a chloroplast transformation vector. It is recommended that two controls are always included: One root plate that remains unbombarded and will serve as a tissue culture and regeneration control (in the absence of antibiotic selection) and two plates that are transformed with a nuclear transformation vector. The root plates should be bombarded two to three times with the plasmid DNA-loaded gold particles.\nThe smallest possible unit of preparation of plasmid-coated gold particles is for 7 shots (prepared in one 1.5-ml tube).

    "This protocol describes the procedures involved in the selection of primary transplastomic lines, their regeneration into shoots, and the growth of transplastomic plants to maturity for seed production. Rooting of in vitro regenerated Arabidopsis plants is inefficient (Weigel & Glazebrook, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0037]) and it is therefore recommended that the T0 generation be kept under sterile culture until seeds have been obtained.

    "Selection of resistant callus, shoot induction, and plant growth\nIt is highly recommended that you carefully read Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting (especially the sections Media preparation and Handling of tissue cultures) and meticulously follow all instructions therein.\n1. Transfer polyester net with the bombarded microcalli to AtSIM with 50 mg/L spectinomycin.\nThis is done best with the help of one or two pairs of tweezers.\n2. Seal plates with medical tape.\n3. Incubate under a diurnal cycle of 16 hr light at 25°C/8 hr dark at 20°C with a light intensity of 4-5 µmol of photons m-2 s-1.\n4. Change medium every 14 days by placing the polyester net with the calli onto fresh medium (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]). Seal plates with medical tape.\nThe yellowish calli will grow and expand in size. As the calli become larger, take great care to ensure good medium contact. To this end, gently press the calli with tweezers on the net. The calli can remain on the net as long as there is good contact to the polyester netting and the medium.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/633c2ded-a463-4c54-bc83-49b3b30b019a/cpz1103-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nSelection and regeneration of transplastomic lines.

The photograph was taken 75 days after root harvest. (B) Callus pieces arranged on a fresh plate with selective medium. (C) Propagation of green spectinomycin-resistant callus tissue. (D) Resistant shoots regenerating from callus tissue.\n5. When calli start to overgrow each other (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]), separate them from each other and place callus pieces of ∼5-8 mm diameter directly (without polyester netting) onto fresh AtSIM spec50 plates (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]).",
    "As a rough estimate, one plate with calli on netting will give three plates with separated callus pieces. Distribute the callus pieces evenly on the plate, placing ∼63 callus pieces on each plate (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]). Note that the callus pieces will continue to grow, likely necessitating multiple rounds of breaking and redistribution. Generate the pieces by gently breaking the callus with two pairs of fine-tipped tweezers.\nIn a successful experiment, green spectinomycin-resistant calli will start to appear after ∼7-52 weeks.\n6. When green resistant callus appears, wait until it is ∼2 mm in size. Then separate green callus from the yellow-beige callus material and transfer green callus to a fresh AtSIM spec50 plate. When green calli exceed a diameter of ∼5 mm, break them into smaller pieces with two pairs of fine-tipped tweezers.\nCollect green calli from other (independent) events and place them on the same plate (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]). This is important, because an array of calli will grow much better than a single callus on a plate. Keep track of the origin of the calli by appropriately labeling callus pieces representing independent events versus those coming from the same primary resistant callus.\nShoot induction from the green callus material can take quite a while. Shoots can develop from green callus or directly from the root-attached callus. The size of the shoots can vary greatly. Wait until the developing shoots reach a reasonable size (Fig. 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0005]) before separating them from the callus. Premature separation bears the risk of destroying the shoot or damaging the apical meristem. When all structures of a shoot (leaves, stem, and growing tip) become clearly visible, it can be transferred (see step 7).",
    "Keep propagating the remaining green callus from which the shoot was excised to produce additional shoots, thus increasing the chance of successful rooting and seed production (see below).\n7. Remove shoots from callus by breaking them off with two fine-tipped pairs of tweezers. Place them onto a fresh plate with AtSIM spec50. Culture multiple shoots in a single plate to stimulate growth (see comment under step 6).\n8. Incubate under a diurnal cycle of 16 hr light at 25°C/8 hr dark at 20°C, with a light intensity of 4-5 µmol of photons m-2 s-1.\n9. Change medium every 14 days by transferring green calli and shoots to plates with fresh medium. Seal plates with medical tape.\n10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 until seeds have been obtained from the transplastomic line and the seeds germinate on medium with spectinomycin (see below).\n11. Start taking shoots for root induction when they have a height of ∼8 mm (or when you have multiple smaller shoots from the same transplastomic line and can sacrifice a few shoots without risk of losing the line).\nOn average, one third of the green antibiotic-resistant calli will differentiate into shoots.\nRoot induction\n12. Remove shoots regenerating from the calli by gently breaking apart the callus tissue with two fine-tipped pairs of tweezers. The extracted shoots must not have any residual callus material at the base of the shoot.\nResidual callus tissue would inhibit root induction and root growth.\n13. Transfer shoots to TC flat tubes with AtRIM spec10. Stick two to four shoots per tube into the agar slant (Fig. 6A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006], B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]). Place tubes upright in a tube rack.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/27da4fe2-1cd0-4159-8a1f-8a442c8f127a/cpz1103-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",

Incubate for 2 weeks under a diurnal cycle of 12 hr light at 20°C and 12 hr dark at 18°C with a light intensity of 50-70 µmol m-2 s-1.\n15. Transfer shoots, independent of them having formed roots or not, to Magenta boxes with AtPM spec10. Stick three to four shoots per box into the medium (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]).\n16. Close Magenta box with a punched filter paper (with a hole of 10 mm diameter). Cover hole with medical tape and fix filter paper with medical tape to the wall of the Magenta box (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]).\nClosing the Magenta box with its lid should be avoided at this stage to lower the humidity. The hole in the filter paper cover allows for convenient watering of the plants later on.\nInduction of rooting is not trivial. Typically, only half of the shoots can be successfully rooted. However, on the AtPM spec10 culture medium, even rootless shoots can develop flowers and produce seeds, albeit with reduced efficiency. Extending the incubation time of 2 weeks on the agar slants is not recommended, as this may inhibit root outgrowth.\nPlant growth and seed production\n17. Incubate plants in Magenta boxes (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0006]) for 1-2 weeks under a diurnal cycle of 16 hr light at 22°C and 8 hr dark at 22°C with a light intensity of 35-65 µmol m-2 s-1.

Close jar with a layer of filter paper with a punched hole. Cover hole and fix filter paper to the jar with medical tape.\n20. Water plants twice a week with 10-20 ml sterile water.\n21. When the plants flower, support self-pollination by daily tapping with your fingers on the wall of the jar until you see the flowers shaking.\n22. When the siliques are ripe, harvest seeds and collect them in a sterile tube.\nSeed assay as test for homoplasmy and maternal inheritance",
    "Successful transformation of the chloroplast genome and integration of the transgenes by homologous recombination should be confirmed by Southern blot analysis (e.g., Ruf et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0026]; Ruf, Hermann, Berger, Carrer, & Bock, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0027]; Tabatabaei, Ruf, & Bock, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0034]) using labeled probes flanking the transgene insertion site in the plastid genome. For several reasons (including the possibility of vector integration into the nuclear genome and the presence of promiscuous plastid DNA in the nuclear genome; Hager, Biehler, Illerhaus, Ruf, & Bock, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0012]; Koop et al., 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0015]; Ruf, Biehler, & Bock, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0025]), PCR is not suitable for this purpose. Southern blot analysis is also essential to assess whether or not all wild-type copies of the highly polyploidy plastid genome (Golczyk et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0010]; Greiner et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0011]) have been successfully eliminated by spectinomycin selection, a status referred to as “homoplasmic transplastomic.” Homoplasmy is essential for the genetic stability of the transplastomic lines, as heteroplasmic lines can lose the transgene through (random) segregation of plastid genomes in the absence of selection (Drescher, Ruf, Calsa, Carrer, & Bock, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0008]). Independent confirmation of plastid transformation and homoplasmy should be provided by seed assays in which the uniparentally maternal inheritance of the (chloroplast encoded) spectinomycin resistance and the lack of segregation (i.e., absence of antibiotic-sensitive seedlings from the progeny) are demonstrated (Bock, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0003]; Ruf, Karcher, & Bock, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0028]).\n23. Incubate seeds harvested from the T0 generation plants (representing the T1 generation) for 3 hr in sterile water.\nBecause the seeds were obtained from plants growing under aseptic conditions and harvested under sterile conditions, no surface sterilization is necessary. As a negative control, include the untransformed Δacc2 recipient line.",
    "24. Place seeds on AtGM spec100 in a Petri dish (round Petri dishes 100 × 20 mm or squared Petri dishes 120 × 120 × 17 mm; Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0007]). To be able to pick individual seeds, pour seed suspension onto a sterile filter paper in a Petri dish. Individual seeds can then be conveniently picked with a sterile toothpick and placed onto germination medium (evenly spaced, to avoid cross-protection from the antibiotic; Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0007]).

Seeds were germinated in the presence of spectinomycin. Half of the plate contains T1 seedlings from a transplastomic line (green), the other half contains seedlings of the Δaac2 control line that are spectinomycin sensitive and therefore bleach out. The photograph was taken 20 days after sowing.\n25. Incubate plates for 2 days in the dark at 4°C.\nThis stratification step is necessary to achieve uniform germination.\n26. Transfer plates to an incubator with 12 hr light at 20°C and 12 hr dark at 18°C, light intensity 70-80 µmol of photons m-2 s-1.\nThe seeds should germinate after ∼1 week, and after 2-3 weeks, their resistance phenotype can be evaluated and documented (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0007]). The progeny of homoplasmic transplastomic T0 plants will display a uniform spectinomycin-resistant phenotype (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0007]). The transplastomic T1 seedlings can then be transferred to soil and grown to maturity under standard greenhouse conditions for further seed production. These plants should also be used to perform reciprocal crosses with the wild type to ultimately confirm maternal inheritance and lack of pollen transmission of the transgenic chloroplast genomes (see Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-fig-0003] in Ruf et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.103#cpz1103-bib-0026])."
