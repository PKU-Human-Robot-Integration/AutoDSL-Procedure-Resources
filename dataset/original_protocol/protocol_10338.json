    "All experimental protocols and animal care were conducted according to the guidelines of the University Animal Care Committee for Animal Research of Gyeongsang National University (GLA-100917-M0093).\n1. Materials\nMice\n\t\nUse males of C57BL/6 strain background weighing 22–24 g at postnatal week 7. Habituate in the breeding room for 1 week before the experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: All mice were purchased from a laboratory animal company.\nHouse mice individually in a temperature-controlled vivarium (22–24 °C) under a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 A.M.), with normal laboratory chow and water available ad libitum.\nRestrainer\n\t\nUse a cylindrical, transparent, acrylic tank (height = 8.5 cm, diameter = 2.5 cm) fixed on a square pedestal to restrain and to produce depressive behavior (Figure 1A). The diameter of this cylinder was made to fit the body so that the mouse could not turn and move forwards or backwards. The restrainer can be purchased commercially or made in the lab.\nTail suspension apparatus\n\t\nUse a reasonable size tail suspension box made of translucent acrylic (height = 30 cm, width = 20 cm, length = 20, Figure 1B). To prevent interactions between the animals, use rectangular partitions within the box so that the floor and three of the four walls are blocked by acrylic plates. Leave the remaining two sides of the box open to allow video recording and to fix the horizontal bar. The box can be purchased commercially or made in the lab.\nVideo recording device and video tracking software\n\t\nUse a black and white-display closed-circuit television camera (see Table of Materials) connected to a computer and a tripod (or other support products) to allow recording of the behavioral experiment. Video recording is essential to allow behavioral scoring in this experiment, because at least two mice are tested at the same time.",
    "Ensure that the camera resolution is high enough to allow the video data to be analyzed using the video tracking software (see Table of Materials) installed in the connected computer.\n2. Induction of depression by CIS restraint\nNOTE: Handle the mouse gently, but firmly with confidence. Both rough and tentative handling is another stress factor in the experiment and it is an important reason for the mouse struggling, biting, and scratching.\nSet the room light to light (200 Lux) conditions using a digital lux meter.\nHouse the mouse in a separate cage at least a week before testing and place the mouse in the testing room for at least 30 min before the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Handle the mice at least once a day for at least 3 consecutive days before the experiment so that the mice become familiar with the experimenter. An adaptational period before the experiment is necessary to ensure that the mice acclimatize to the circumstance, such as the testing room.\nGently hold the mouse tail to avoid tensing the mouse, and then carefully place it on a rough surface (top of wire bar of the cage or cage lid).\nCover the restrainer with a small white towel, and then gently place the mouse at the opening of the restrainer so that the mouse enters the restrainer voluntarily.\n\tNOTE: In this case, the mouse is positioned in the opposite direction to that which it enters the restrainer with. To lead the mouse to enter the restrainer voluntarily, the restrainer is covered with a small towel to make the inside darker.\nPlace the closure to restrain the mouse as tight as possible, being careful to avoid damage to the body, such as tail, feet, and testicles.",
    "Restrain the mouse for 2 h/day (9:00 A.M. to 11:00 A.M.) for 15 consecutive days.\nMeasure body weight and food intake every 48 h during exposure to the restrainer (i.e., food intake quantity during the 48 h before the initiation of the movement restraint).\n\tNOTE: When measuring body weight and food intake, place control mice in their home cages in the testing room during CIS. Ensure that other environmental factors are the same as for the CIS mice.\nConfirm the induction of depression by performing behavioral tests such as the sucrose preference test (SPT) and the tail suspension test (TST) (refer to steps 4 and 5).\nConfirm the induction of depression by measuring the stress marker corticosterone using ELISA assay (refer to section 6).\n3. The sucrose preference test\nBefore testing, habituate the mice to the presence of two drinking bottles (one containing 0.1 M sucrose and the other containing plain water) for 48 h. Switch the positions of the two bottles after 24 h to reduce any confounding produced by a side bias.\nOn the 3rd day, deprive the mice of water for 24 h.\nOn the day of the SPT experiment, expose the mice to two drinking bottles for 6 h. After 3 h, switch the position of the water bottles.\nRecord the volume (mL) of sucrose solution and water consumed and then calculate the animals’ affinity to sucrose.\nGenerally, calculate sucrose preference as a percentage of the volume of sucrose consumption over the total fluid consumption during the test.\n4. The tail suspension test\nBring the CIS-induced mice into the testing room at least 30 min before beginning the TST.\nSet the room light to dim (50 Lux) conditions.",
    "To obtain the highest resolution video file, place the camera as close to the mouse as possible (around 40 cm from the mouse).\nSuspend the mouse firmly from the horizontal bar (30 cm from the bottom line) using cellophane adhesive tape (the distance from the tip of the tail is 1 cm). Complete the process of applying tape to the mouse as soon as possible to minimize other sources of stress.\nOnce the mouse is positioned in the middle of suspension box, start recording and observe the behavioral alterations continuously for 6 min.\n\tNOTE: If the mouse attempts to climb its tail, use a stick or climb stopper to prevent it from doing so.\nAt the end of the experiment, move the mouse to its home cage and carefully remove the tape from its tail.\nAnalyze the accumulated time of immobile periods using the video tracking software.\n\tNOTE: The duration of immobility is the most important CIS parameter. This can be calculated as the accumulated time of immobile periods, defined in terms of a motion threshold contained within the level-filtering device of the software.\n5. Measuring corticosterone levels in blood by ELISA\nNOTE: A day after the behavioral test, the mice are sacrificed for blood collecting.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane in an induction chamber until anesthesia. Ensure the mouse has sufficient time in the induction chamber (at least 2 min) to prevent waking up during surgery.\nCollect blood from the heart using a 1 mL syringe, and store the blood in vacutainers containing K3EDTA on the ice (at 9 A.M.)\nSeparate plasma by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nQuantify plasma corticosterone levels using the corticosterone ELISA kit (see Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer's protocol.",
