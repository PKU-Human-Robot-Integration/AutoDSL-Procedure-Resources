    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Intravitreal AAV injection\nTiming: [0.5 day, ∼1 minute per eye for injection]\nAnesthetize the mouse with Ketamine and Xylazine\nWeigh the mouse (plan to administer 0.1 mL per gram)\nNote: Depending on your own experimental design, and whether you are interested in development or aging etc, mouse can be almost any age. This protocol, as written, describes how to conduct these procedures in mice > 4 weeks of age. We have not attempted this protocol in pups less than 4 weeks old.\nAdminister proper dose of anesthetic via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection\nCheck for complete anesthetic state by tail or foot pinch for movement, or by the eye blink reflex.\nNote: A second injection at 1/3 to 1/2 of the original dose can be used is the animal is not under after 15 min. Follow your institute’s ethics protocol.\nAttach microinjection needle (ensure the tip is sharp and narrow) to the prepared Hamilton syringe and tubing (See above).\nApply 1 drop of Tropicamide to each mouse eye to dilate pupil.\nApply 1 drop of Proparacaine to each mouse eye for local anesthesia.\nHold mouse head in left hand, so that its skin spreads away from eye.\nUsing a Bulldog Serrefines (FST, #18051-28) to clamp skin surrounding back of eye so that eye protrudes out for injections (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/991-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Anatomy of mouse eye and intravitreal injection site\n(A) Highlights the structural differences between the mouse eye and that of a dog or human, with the lens being significantly larger.\n(B) Indicates the site where the glass micropipette should be inserted into the eye for the injection of the AAVs to promote axonal regeneration or Cholera Toxin Subunit β (CTB).\n(C) Example images of the regions shown in the schematic in (B).",
    "Open clip as wide as possible and approach the back (caudal) side of the eye.\nLine up tip of clip with outer edges of eye (at the widest point/diameter)\nAllow clip to close so the eye lid skin around the eye is pinched causing the eye to protrude out.\nPlace mouse head under dissection scope at a 60º angle and stabilize the head with non-dominant hand.\nUsing your dominant hand, insert needle at a parallel angle to the eye within the sclera (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) about 0.5 mm posterior to the limbus and into the vitreous body.\nFor left eye, insert needle close to ear/clamp. For right eye, insert needle from nose side\nEnsure tip is angled towards back of eye, and slightly rotate tip during insertion to ease entry.\nNote: The lens of the mouse eye is very large, make sure the needle is at the periphery of the eye within the sclera, to avoid damaging the lens (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nRemove ∼1–2 μL of vitreous humor from eye using Hamilton syringe and the micropipette.\nAseptic technique requires using one needle to remove liquid and another for injection – do NOT attempt to ‘wash’ and reuse the needle, use a fresh one each time.\nNote: This is done to reduce spilling and intraocular pressure from the upcoming injection.\nFill new micropipette with 2–2.5 μL of pre-mixed AAVs using Hamilton syringe.\nBe careful to not get bubbles in the needle.\nInject AAVs into the eye\nRe-insert needle into back of eye (via hole from 1st insertion)\nSlowly inject the 2 μL of AAVs into the intravitreal space\nLeave needle in place for a few seconds after injection to allow it to disperse in the eye and reduce AAV loss to spilling.\nUse cotton bud to remove any blood.",
    "Rotate the mouse and repeat steps 6–11 on the 2nd eye (if doing a bilateral ONC).\nApply antibiotic ointment (i.e., Vetropolucine) directly onto the mouse eyes from the tube.\nBe sure to cover the eye completely.\nMonitor mice approximately every 15 min until fully recovered from anesthesia\nCheck respiratory rate, hydration (by evaluating skin turgor), pain, and position of mice.\nTurn mouse from side to side every 30 min to prevent pulmonary congestion.\nRemain with the animals until all mice awake and can then return cages to housing unit.\nMonitor mice daily for 7–10 days and then twice a week for long term.\nPart 2: Oligodendrocyte lineage reporter expression\nTiming: [1 h]\nBegin to administer Tamoxifen 5 days prior to Optic Nerve Crush (below).\nEnsure tamoxifen powder is still in solution.\nNote: If tamoxifen has precipitated, warm in water bath and vortex until back into solution prior to administration.\nCan be administered via oral gavage or via i.p. injection\nDetermine Injection dose by weight for each animal\nUse approximately 100 mg tamoxifen/kg body weight\nFor adult mice, a standard dose of 100 μL tamoxifen in sunflower oil solution is effective for inducing recombination.\nIf administering via i.p. sanitize injection site with 70% ethanol prior to injection,\nAdminister Tamoxifen once every 24 h for 5 consecutive days.\nNote: Throughout the course of tamoxifen injections and any post-injection wait period, mice should be closely monitored for any adverse reactions to the treatment. Also keep Tamoxifen solution protected from light whenever possible.\nPart 3: Optic nerve crush\nTiming: [0.5–1 day depending on the number of animals]\nNote: Video of the optic nerve crush procedure can be found on JOVE (Tang et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Slight differences between their protocol and ours exist, but the overall procedural process is grossly similar.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with i.p. injection of ketamine and xylazine (See materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] and AAV Intravitreal Injections above).\nApply eye ointment containing atropine sulfate to protect the cornea during surgery and administer first dose of 0.1 mg/kg Buprenorphine.\nOptional: Retract the eyelids slightly using surgical tape\nMake a small incision through the dorsal conjunctival membranes at the 4 o’clock position around the eye\nExpose the optic nerve intra-orbitally\nNote: The optic nerve will appear starkly white compared to the surrounding tissues within the eye socket.\nUsing jeweler’s forceps (Dumont #5, #11252-00) crush the optic nerve for 5 s approximately 1 mm behind the optic disc.\nNote: Do not to damage the underlying ophthalmic artery to ensure the preservation of the retinal blood supply\nApply antibiotic ointment (i.e., Vetropolucine) directly onto the mouse eyes from the tube and coat the eye and remove surgical tape.\nMonitor mice approximately every 15 min until fully recovered from anesthesia (See AAV Intravitreal Injection anesthesia recovery above).\nMice should receive analgesic, such as 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine hydrochloride, subcutaneously every 8–12 h for 24 h post optic nerve crush.\nNote: Alternatively, subcutaneously injection of 1 mg/kg Buprenorphine sustained release (SR) can be used. One dose of Buprenorphine can last for 46–48 hours in mice.\nSee Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOptional: Depending on your experimental purpose, you may choose to investigate the rate, timing, or fate of OPCs that proliferate after specific times after injury. If this is not necessary for your given experiment, please omit Part 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] and proceed to Part 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5], below.\nPart 4: BrdU injection\nTiming: [0.5 h]\nConduct BrdU birth dating by administering BrdU via i.p. injection at a concentration of 100 mg/kg.\nNote: You can use BrdU for two different readouts:",
    "If interested in OPC proliferation rate at specific time points after injury, inject only once and wait 3 h before starting tissue collection (Part 6, below).\nIf interested in rate or progress of OPC differentiation post injury by BrdU co-immunostaining, inject BrdU once daily for 7 days from day 3 to day 10 post injury. Harvest tissue when you are ready to conclude your experiment. (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A in Wang et. al. 2020).\nOptional: CTB injection protocol is used if you wish to visualize the regenerating RGC axons within the optic nerve during your analysis. This injection should be conducted 2 days prior to euthanizing the mouse to harvest the optic nerve. If not needed, please omit Part 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5] and proceed to Part 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.6], below.\nPart 5: Label regenerated axons\nTiming: [0.5–1 day depending on the number of animals]\nNote: CTB injection protocol is extremely similar to the AAV intravitreal injections above.\nAttach micropipette to the prepared Hamilton syringe and tubing.\nNote: Keep the CTB solution on ice during the injection.\nApply 1 drop of Tropicamide to mouse eyes to dilate pupil\nApply 1 drop of Proparacaine to mouse eyes for local anesthesia\nHold mouse head in left hand, so that its skin spreads away from eye.\nUsing a Bulldog Serrefines clamp skin surrounding back of eye so that eye protrudes out (See AAV intravitreal injections, above for more detail)\nPlace mouse head under microscope at a 60º angle and stabilize the head with non-dominant hand.\nUsing your dominate hand, insert needle at a parallel angle to the eye.",
    "Note: You should be able to see the previous injection site from AAV administration. Try to insert the micropipette at the same location. The lens of a mouse eye is much larger than human or dog (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, and Intravitreal AAV Injection above).\nRemove ∼1 μL of vitreous humor from eye using Hamilton syringe\nThis is done to reduce spilling and intraocular pressure from the upcoming injection.\nNote: Aseptic technique requires using one needle to remove liquid and another for injection\nPipette 1–2 μL of CTB into microinjection needle using Hamilton syringe\nMake sure there are no bubbles in the needle or syringe to ensure smooth and good injection.\nRe-insert needle back into back of eye (via hole from 1st insertion) and slowly inject CTB into vitreous space eye\nNote: Leave needle in place for a few seconds to allow CTB to diffuse and reduce loss when micropipette is removed.\nRotate the mouse and repeat for 2nd eye.\nUse cotton bud to remove any blood.\nApply antibiotic ointment (i.e., Vetropolucine) directly onto the mouse eyes from the tube.\nMonitor mice approximately every 15 min until fully recovered from anesthesia.\nRemain with animals until all mice awaken and can then return cages to housing unit.\nMonitor mice daily for 7–10 days, and then twice a week for long term, per your ethical committee post-operative protocol.\nPart 6: Optic Nerve Dissection\nTiming: [0.5 h per mouse]\nTissue can be harvested at variable time points after ONC, depending on read-out of interest and treatments protocol you are testing.\nNote: As a reference point, relatively robust myelination was observed ∼48 days post-crush with the treatments outlined in Wang et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nGive animals an i.p. of anesthesia (Ketamine-Xylazine Mixture).\nUse paw and tail pitches to confirm the animal is fully anesthetized",
    "Perfuse the mouse:\nPin the mouse down using needles through each paw so the animal is splayed on their back with their chest facing you.\nIncise the musculature immediately caudal to the sternum.\nCut the ribs bilaterally and then completely cutting the diaphragm.\nInsert needle into left ventricle and pierce right atrium with sharp fine scissors.\nPerfuse the animal transcardially with ∼100 mL PBS until no blood is seen following out of the left ventricle.\nPerfuse with ∼100 mL 4% PFA\nNote: Flow rate of perfusion should be so that it takes ∼1–2 minutes to administer 100mL of the PFA.\nSeparate head of the animal and place in Falcon tube containing 4% PFA.\nPassively fixate the head at 4°C for 8–12 h.\nWash off PFA the following morning using 1×PBS for 3×10 min\nNote: Over fixation of the tissue can lead to later issues with immunohistochemical staining, such as increased background noise, or loss of signal.\nDissect out the optic nerves from the head:\nRemove skin/fur from the skull.\nInsert the tip of small scissors into the exposed back of the brainstem (starkly white tissue).\nKeeping scissors angled upward, cut skull in a straight line through the bregma to the front of the brain.\nUsing forceps peel and break off the skull to expose the brain.\nWith the forceps, grab the brainstem / cervical spinal cord region, and gently lift and flip the brain up and out of the skull cavity.\nOptic nerves (connected to the optic chiasm) should be seen resting at the base of the skull (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/991-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Optic nerve dissection",
    "View of the optic nerves once the brain and side skull bones have been removed (Step 48). Yellow lines indicate the cut sites to detach the nerve from eye. It is important to cut as close to the eye as possible to preserve the crush site in the nerve sample. Crush site will only be ~ 500 μm back from the eye. Scale Bar = 1 mm\nMove under a dissecting microscope\nUsing forceps, carefully break and pull away the remaining bone around the eye socket.\nNote: The skull bone can accidentally damage the optic nerve if not removed properly. Make sure to pull the bone AWAY from the eye and nerve by pulling bone fragment in towards the empty skull cavity (where the brain was located) and not down or out towards the base of the skull or eye (respectively). This will help prevent accidental damage to the nerve.\nUsing curved Student Vanna spring scissors (F.S.T. #91501-09), cut the eyelid way from the eye so its separated\nLooking through the scope, locate the ocular muscle that sits on top of the eye and cut\nThis will cause the muscle to pull back and expose the optic nerve as it enters the eye.\nCut the optic nerve as close to the back of the eye as possible using the spring scissors (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: The crush site is only ∼500 μm - 1 mm back from the eye, so it is essential that you cut at the most distal part of the optic nerve right as it enters the eye so that you have the crush site in your analysis.\nCut the optic chiasm in half so each optic nerve can be separated\nUsing fine forceps, grasp the end of the nerve at the optic chiasm and gently pull.",
    "Should the optic nerve be properly cut, it should slide out through the muscle and eye socket without any resistance.\nFor picking up or handling of the optic nerve using forceps, be sure to grab the nerve near the optic chiasm, which is far enough from the crush site. This will prevent damaging the tissue around the crush site. The optic chiasm is not used for the later analysis.\nStore optic nerves in 1×PBS in 24 well plates at 4°C\nPause point: Tissue can be stored under these conditions for ∼ 1 week until ready to proceed.\nPart 7: Immunohistochemistry & analysis\nTiming: [5–6 days]\nNote: Please see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for the expression pattern of the Oligodendrocyte lineage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/991-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Oligodendrocyte maturation and markers\nSchematic depicts the major steps of maturation that occur from OPCs to mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes. It also highlights some markers that can be used to identify oligodendrocytes at different stages of this maturation.\nPlace the dissected optic nerves into 30% sucrose (with 1×PBS) for ∼48 h at 4°C to cryoprotect the tissue.\nNote: Tissue will sink to the bottom of the well when it is ready to proceed to the following steps.\nRemove excess sucrose from the surface of the optic nerves using a Kimwipe to absorb the liquid prior to embedding.\nEmbed the optic nerves in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) for cryo-sectioning. Make sure the nerve is laid flat so that the nerve can be sectioned evenly along the longitudinal direction.\nSection optic nerves at 10 μm thickness and attach sections on to pre-coated glass coverslips for immunohistochemistry.\nPause point: Slides can be stored at −80°C until ready for staining. Short term (<1 month) storage at −20°C is also acceptable.\nBring slides to room temperature",
    "Wash slides in 1×PBS to remove OCT from the slide.\nSee Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOptional: If not staining for BrdU, step 55[href=https://www.wicell.org#o0845] can be omitted.\nIf staining for BrdU, denature tissue sections.\nPlace tissue in HCl (2 N) for 30 min at 37°C.\nThen neutralize with 0.1 M sodium borate buffer for 10 min\nThen proceed to the normal staining procedure\nPlace tissue sections in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature.\n0.5% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum in PBS\nReplace solution with primary antibody solution in blocking buffer and incubate at 4°C in a humidifying chamber for 8–12 h.\nSee Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nRemove primary solution and wash slides in 1×PBS\nRepeat for a total of three 10 min washes\nAdd secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature in a humidifying chamber.\nChoose secondaries that correspond to the primary antibodies used.\nNote: Be sure to avoid secondaries in the red channel (555-, 594-, or TexasRed) as you will be unable to discern the tamoxifen induced tdTomato+ oligodendrocyte lineage cells from your other antibody marker(s).\nWash off secondary antibody solution in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1×PBS.\nRepeat for a total of three 10 min washes\nDry slide as much as possible without allowing the tissue to dry out\nMount slides with DAPI-containing mounting solution and sealed with glass coverslips and clear nail polish.\nAllow slides to dry completely before imaging.\nPause point: Slides can be stored at 4°C until ready for imaging.\nImage sections for quantification:\nUse a confocal microscope for best cellular resolution\nUse a 10× or 20× objective.\nImage within 1.2 mm distal to the crush site because this area will have the highest proportion of regenerating axons and it is important to maintain a consistent location of analysis (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/991-Fig6.jpg",
