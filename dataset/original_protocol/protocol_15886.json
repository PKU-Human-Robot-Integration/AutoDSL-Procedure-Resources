    "In this protocol, we explain how to find articles and preprints on a topic of interest by searching the Europe PMC database using the main search bar. Alternatively, users can search for articles on a particular topic using Europe PMC Advanced search. This protocol describes how to find relevant articles and preprints using a keyword search or exact phrase search, and how to navigate the search results page.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDevice capable of supporting a Web browser and an Internet connection\nSoftware\nUp-to-date Web browser (e.g., Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome)\n1. Open the Europe PMC homepage http://europepmc.org[href=http://europepmc.org] in a browser of your choice (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/905cd892-2fe8-4839-aebd-5bd0ff5e01c3/cpz1694-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nThe Europe PMC homepage with the main search bar.\n2. To perform a simple search, type a keyword, or a string of terms, such as metastatic bone cancer, into the main search bar and select the ‘Search’ button.\nA search for a term or a string of terms, such as metastatic bone cancer, will bring up publications containing metastatic and bone and cancer, but the words may appear anywhere in the text and are not necessarily in close proximity to each other.\nSearch coverage: The Europe PMC search will return all records, including journal articles and preprints, where the search term or multiple terms are found in the abstracts, metadata, or full text, where available. Here metadata includes information about the record, such as authors, title, journal, or keywords. Note that the search excludes references. See Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-prot-0005] for steps to limit search to a specific article section.\n3. It is also possible to search for an exact phrase match using quotation marks, for example “tRNA function”. Exact search retrieves publications where the entire phrase is present in the same sequence as specified.",
    "A key difference between a term search, such as tRNA function, and an exact phrase search, such as “tRNA function”, is that the term search will bring up publications containing both tRNA and function, but the words may appear anywhere in the text and are not necessarily in close proximity to each other. For example, both articles titled “tRNA Function and Dysregulation in Cancer” and “Function and Therapeutic Implications of tRNA Derived Small RNAs” will be picked up by tRNA function keyword search, but only the first article will be retrieved by the “tRNA function” exact phrase search.\n4. To retrieve a broader number of results, search terms are modified by the search engine to be case insensitive, special characters are replaced, and stop words and punctuation are removed.\nSearches in the main search bar are case insensitive. For example, when searching for MYC, results containing myc will also be found. Searches filter out stop words, such as “a”, “on”, or “is” (Solr, 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-bib-0038]). For example, if downstream of rac1 is typed into the main search bar, the search performed will be downstream rac1. Stop words remain for exact phrase searches, such as “downstream of rac1”. Punctuation and special characters are removed from keyword searches with few exceptions (Solr, 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-bib-0038]).\n5. Search results are displayed on the search results page (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0002]). The results page shows the total number of results, the list of the first 25 results, as well as the navigation to further results pages. The results page also provides options to change sort order, export results, and refine search using filters (described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-prot-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/99a05584-3ecd-48fc-856e-c4c1d35f7085/cpz1694-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

    "This protocol describes how to access version history, peer review status and materials, as well as citations and other impact metrics to evaluate articles and preprints of interest.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware\nDevice capable of supporting a Web browser and an Internet connection\nSoftware\nUp-to-date Web browser (e.g., Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome)\n1. To distinguish preprints from peer-reviewed articles in Europe PMC, search results look for a green Preprint label (Fig. 10A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0010]). Preprint records also display an orange notification box on the preprint page that warns the reader that the preprint may not have been peer reviewed (Fig. 10B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0010]).\nPreprints are complete scientific manuscripts uploaded by the authors onto a public server. A preprint is posted without peer review but may acquire feedback or reviews at a later stage or be eventually published in a peer-reviewed journal. Europe PMC allows you to search preprints across more than twenty different preprint platforms, including bioRxiv (bioRxiv, 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-bib-0003]), medRxiv (medRxiv, 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-bib-0020]), ResearchSquare (Research Square, 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-bib-0035]), and many others.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c0bfa905-a932-4dc2-a5f5-d47d3d1d3054/cpz1694-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\n(A) Search result with a green Preprint label.

To access the peer-reviewed journal version of the preprint (if available) open the ‘journal published article’ link in the orange notification box. You can access other preprint versions from the ‘Preprint version history’ drop down menu. The current preprint version is indicated in the green Preprint label (Fig. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0011]).\nEurope PMC retains preprints and versions even if a peer-reviewed journal version is published. This ensures preprint citations can be linked and found. It is also critical to retain versions in support of transparency of sharing of scientific research.",
    "For preprints to be linked to the peer-reviewed journal article they both must be included in Europe PMC. A link is established based on the title and first author match. A link might be missed due to title and/or first author changes from preprint to published article. Preprint version history is the documentation of the initial preprint submission (version 1) and any updated versions that have been released, e.g., version 2, version 3, and so on. They are all crosslinked in Europe PMC to ensure you can access the most up-to-date version of the research. For some preprint servers, such as bioRxiv (bioRxiv, 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-bib-0003]) or medRxiv (medRxiv, 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-bib-0020]), preprint version history is unavailable due to versioning practices established by the server.

To change the order of results, use the ‘Sort by’ drop-down menu and select the desired option (Fig. 14[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0014]).\n‘Relevance’ sorting provides you with the most relevant articles for your search. To do this, Europe PMC gives a higher placement for articles with a combination of features:\n         \nHigh search term frequency (the more a search term appears in the article, the higher the article ranks);\nHigh number of different search terms (the more of your search terms appear in the article, the higher the article ranks);\nRare search terms (rarer search terms appearing in the article makes the article rank higher, for example, amongst results for maffucci OR syndrome search, articles containing maffucci will rank higher than articles containing syndrome, as maffucci is a rarer term;\nShort content (shorter articles containing the keywords will be ranked higher than longer articles, as the statistical probability of the terms appearing in shorter texts is smaller and thus, they are considered to be more relevant);\nRecent publication date.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c48b2c71-9be8-4eb1-a0d4-f07196e4eb67/cpz1694-fig-0014-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 14\nSearch results page with an orange arrow pointing to the Sort by drop down box displaying the following sort options: Relevance, Most recently added, Times cited, and Date published.",
    "2. To further assess the relevance of your search results you can look at the search snippets, sentences from the article that match your keyword(s) search, with keyword(s) appearing in bold (Fig. 15A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0015]). Snippets provide useful context for the search, making it possible to judge if it is a negligible mention or an essential reference.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/185a2bd1-eaa7-4b02-90c2-3926b395c4b4/cpz1694-fig-0015-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 15\n(A) The search results page showing a snippet for one of the results highlighted in the orange box.

To see the snippets in context and find them within the article text, from the search results list select the title of the search result you are interested in, as shown in Figure 15A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0015]; this will open the article page. Scroll down below the abstract to ‘Occurrences of search terms within full text’, as shown in Figure 15B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0015], which shows two excerpts from the article that contain your search terms. Select the snippet you want to view. This will take you to where the snippet is located within the full text, Figure 15C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0015].\n4. Where necessary, search results can be further refined using the following filters: ‘Type’, ‘Free full text’, and ‘Date’ (Fig. 16[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0016]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/eb6c9c9f-a355-4f3b-aab1-4283324d89be/cpz1694-fig-0016-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 16\nSearch filters indicated by an orange box around the Search only section are available from the search results page. URL used for the screenshot: https://europepmc.org/search?query=maffucci%20syndrome%20AND%20%28SRC%3APPR%29&page=1.\n5. Use the ‘Type’ filter to limit the type of articles returned by your search to one of the following options:\n         \nResearch articles: Journal articles presenting the results of experimental research;\nReviews: Reviews on a topic covering a broad set of previously published articles;",
    "Preprints: Research articles that have not yet undergone formal peer review and have been submitted to public preprint servers.\n6. When selecting the ‘Preprints’ type filter it is possible to further limit your results using the ‘Journal published’ sub filter (Fig. 16[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0016]). This will return preprints that are linked to a subsequent peer-reviewed journal publication.\n7. Use the ‘Free full text’ filter to limit your search to ‘Free to read’ or ‘Free to read and use’ articles available in Europe PMC.\nFree full text is available from legal sources for many articles in Europe PMC. Articles with free full text can either be free to read or free to read and use, based on their licensing.\n         \n‘Free to read’ filter includes articles that have free full text openly available in Europe PMC.\n‘Free to read and use’ filter includes articles that are made available under a Creative Commons license, or similar license. These articles are a part of the Europe PMC open access subset and can be reused, for example, to adapt a figure for a different publication, translate the original publication into another language, or include part of the publication in a textbook (Europe PMC, 2022d[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-bib-0012]).\n8. Use the ‘Date’ filter to limit your search to articles that were published within a specific year or a year range. You can select one or multiple boxes for the three most recent publication years. Alternatively, select the ‘Custom date range’ option, input publication years you are interested in, and use the search icon to search within the specific range (Fig. 16[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0016]).\n9. In addition to using search filters, search can be refined by combining search terms with Boolean operators, AND, OR, NOT. For example, microvesicles AND exercise, pathogens OR bacteria, sepsis NOT covid (Fig. 17[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.694#cpz1694-fig-0017]).",
    "Boolean operators are a logical connection between search terms. You can use the Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT to control search results in Europe PMC. Note that AND is a default Boolean operator used by the Europe PMC search to connect individual terms in a keyword string. For example, in Europe PMC a search for metastatic bone cancer is equivalent to a search for metastatic AND bone AND cancer.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/01b76bfb-e2af-46e9-9f90-864b981bc9dd/cpz1694-fig-0017-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 17\nBoolean logic.
