    "NOTE: This protocol aims to use a modified commercial vitrification apparatus to prepare the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) samples at specific temperatures, especially higher than 37 °C. The overall experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. The protocol uses 55 °C as an example. For the specific conditions at other temperatures, please refer to Supplementary Table 2 in reference12.\n1. Preparation of the vitrification apparatus\nMake a 1 cm hole in a 50 mL centrifuge tube on its closed end.\nPlace the tube in the vitrification apparatus chamber at the ultrasonic water outlet, as shown in Figure 2.\n\tNOTE: The purpose is to minimize water condensation by guiding water vapor to the heat exchanger through the tube before reaching the entire chamber.\nSet up the vitrification apparatus temperature to the specified temperature (e.g., 55 °C, as shown in Figure 3), and allow the vitrification apparatus chamber to reach to 55 °C and 100% relative humidity. Let it stand for at least half an hour to stabilize the conditions before starting the experiment.\n2. Warming up the sample and the tools\nPlace the water bath on a hotplate and set the hotplate to the desired temperature (here 55 °C). Check with a thermometer to ensure that the water reaches 55 °C.\nIncubate the sample in the water bath and preheat the pipette tip on the edge of the hotplate for 2 min or longer before the blotting experiment.",
    "​NOTE: The highest temperature setting for the vitrification apparatus chamber is 60 °C. To prepare higher temperature grids for cyro-EM experiment (e.g., 70 °C), the sample is incubated in the water bath at 80 °C, and the average between the sample temperature and the vitrification apparatus temperature is estimated to be the actual temperature of the sample on the grid (70 °C in this case). See the Discussion section for further details and limitations on this estimation.\n3. Preparation for the blotting experiment\nGlow discharge a holey carbon-supported grid at 25 mA for 30 s, or alternative to the values depending on the device used.\nIncubate the tweezers with the grid in the vitrification apparatus for 2 min or longer.\nFill the ethane container with ethane according to standard procedures. Do not let the ethane overflow.\n\tNOTE: This step takes about 10 min and should be followed immediately with the blotting experiment to avoid freezing.\nPlace the vitrification filter paper into the vitrification apparatus chamber no sooner than 5 min before the blotting experiment.\n\tNOTE: Placing the filter paper in the chamber too soon will cause it to become too wet.\n4. Blotting experiment\nNOTE: When holding the grid, ensure that the grid is stable and there is a minimal contact area with the tweezers (Figure 4). This is done to maintain the best cooling efficiency of ethane and to avoid non-vitreous ice.\nUse a pipette tip to apply 7-9 μL of the sample to the grid. Then wait for 1-2 s, blot for 1-1.5 s, and quickly plunge the sample to liquid ethane.\nTransfer the grid from liquid ethane to the cryo box, which is stored in liquid nitrogen.",
    "​NOTE: This step must be performed very carefully because the tweezers is still hot, so the entire cooling tank is full of vapor at this time.\n5. Quality check for the grids\nClip the grids and upload them to a cryo-EM instrument.\nUse the display screen of the cryo-EM instrument and the low dose function of the software to screen the ice condition on the grid and the distribution of the sample on the grid.\n\t​NOTE: Often, the grids are very dry, or the ice layer is too thick. The success rate of the grids prepared at high temperatures is substantially lower than that at room temperature or 4 °C. Representative results of good grids and non-satisfactory grids are shown in the next section.\nIf the quality of the resulting grid is not good, repeat the process of grid preparation with varied conditions (such as waiting time, blotting time, etc.). If the quality of the resulting grid is good, repeat the same steps to make grids at a different temperature.\n6. Data collection\nTransfer the good quality grids to a high resolution cryo-EM instrument.\nPerform data collection and data analyses according to established procedures.\n\tNOTE: As shown in our previous publication, the resolution of the structure is not affected by the high temperature12.\nSubscription Required.
