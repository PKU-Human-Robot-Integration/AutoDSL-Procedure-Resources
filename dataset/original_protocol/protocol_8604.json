    "All procedures were approved by the Penn State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC - Protocol ID: 43242) and adhered to all local, state, and federal regulations.\n1. Preparation\nPurchase or construct the Barnes maze, assuring that goal holes are appropriately sized for the species of interest. For this protocol, use seven adult side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana). Determine adequate sample size for studies using other species.\n\t\nIf constructing the Barnes maze, purchase any standard, nonporous round table (106 cm in diameter), elevated 76.2 cm off the floor.\nUsing a tape measure, mark 10 equidistant points spaced 26 cm apart around the perimeter of the table and 6.35 cm from the edge of the table. Use 10 holes whereas rodent mazes typically have more holes. Doing so allows for a reduction in the number of escape options.\nUsing a hole saw bit (2.54 cm in diameter), drill out all 10 goal holes and sand any sharp edges.\nMount four shelf support pegs under each hole with screws, using a home enclosure as a guide for dimensions.\nPlace the maze in a quiet room with bright overhead lighting and spatial cues available for navigation (doors, cabinets, etc.).\nMount an auto focus, wide-angle lens webcam (11.3 cm x 3.99 cm) or other suitable camera directly above the maze. Be certain that the field of view from the video feed encompasses the entire maze.\nPlace the computer and observer chair at least 1 m from the maze.\nMark the legs of the maze on the floor with a permanent marker or tape. This allows for correction of any minute movement of the maze over the course of the trials.",
    "Randomly assign one of the holes as \"1\" and number the other holes consecutively through \"10\". With a permanent marker, write numbers along the side of the outside of the maze for ease of reference. Ensure that the numbers are not visible to an animal within the maze.\nRandomly assign goal holes to the subjects using a random number generator.\n2. Training Trials\nNOTE: Reptiles have a preferred body temperature that can be obtained from the literature. If animals become sluggish over multiple training trials, the maze may be too cool and this may affect behavior. A small space heater or heat tape on the underside of the maze can adequately increase maze surface temperature, the best thermal indication of body temperature, to maintain optimum body temperature and behavioral performance.\nIf subjects are housed outside of the testing room, bring animals in their home enclosures into the room at least 30 min before testing. Be certain to provide heat in home enclosures (e.g., heat lamps, heat tape) in order to maintain body temperature before testing.\n\t\nOpen tracking software and webcam application for the video feed. The custom tracking software was written for Matlab and the Image Processing toolbox; other tracking software is commercially available.\nEvaluate the field of view from the video feed. If the maze is not in the field of view, check that the maze is within the marks on the floor.\nOpen the worksheet containing information as to the date, start/end time of training trials, subject ID, assigned goal hole, number of training trials run, notes, and observer's initials.\nRandomize the order in which subjects will be tested. Test subjects in a systematic manner.",
    "Remove the first subject from its home cage and gently place the subject in the middle of the maze. Place a plastic tub over the animal; doing so prevents unconscious orientation bias by the researcher. Allow 30 s to acclimate.\nMount the animal's home cage under the maze, directly below the assigned goal hole, by sliding the top of the enclosure into the peg mounts. Be certain that the basking rock in the home cage is directly under the hole, which will serve as a perch when the animal descends into the hole. At this point, the use of thermal or chemical cues of the home enclosure for use in navigation is irrelevant.\n\t\nRodent mazes use a clean enclosure as an escape for the subject. However, encourage entry into the hole during training trials by mounting the animal's home enclosure under the maze.\nGently remove the plastic tub from the top of the maze.\nStart recording of the training trial with the webcam application.\n\t\nAllow the subject to explore the maze for 10 min. If anything atypical occurs, note this in the worksheet.\nIf the subject falls or runs off the table, gently return the subject to the middle of the maze. Continue timing and recording if the animal is out of the maze for 30 s or less. If the subject is out of the maze for more than 30 s, abort the trial. Record this information in the notes section of the workbook.\nIf the subject descends into the goal hole unassisted, consider the trial as over at that time.\nIf the subject does not descend into the goal hole, consider the trial as over after 10 min have elapsed.",
    "If the subject does not descend into the goal hole after 10 min, by hand gently guide the animal, head first, into the appropriate goal hole.\nStop video and tracking software. Save video footage.\nAllow the subject to rest for at least 2 min in its home enclosure while the enclosure is still mounted under the maze.\nUsing a spray bottle and paper towels, clean the top of the maze with a diluted soap mixture of 1:10 soap to water. Doing so precludes the use of chemical cues when navigating the maze. Some species, particularly those that make heavy use of chemosensory information, necessitate additional rinsing of the maze with hot water to eliminate all scent cues.\nRemove the enclosure from under the maze and either repeat the training trial with the same individual or a new individual. Each subject can be run in up to 5 training trials per day, with 30 min interval between an individual's trials.\nRepeat this procedure until a subject descends into its goal hole unassisted, in 3 different training trials, indicating that learning of the goal location has occurred. The three training trials do not need to be consecutive. If a subject reaches this criterion, the subject moves to the probe trial in order to assess spatial memory.\n3. Probe Trials\nNOTE: Once a subject reaches criterion, the subject has learned how to navigate to the goal. However, at this point, it is still unclear if the subject is navigating using a spatial strategy or some other navigational strategy. Probe trials test for this and should be performed the day after the subject reaches criterion in the training trials.",
    "Rotate the maze 180°, assuring that the legs of the maze are within the marks on the floor. Rotation of the maze allows for local cues that directly identify the goal to be in direct conflict with the more stable spatial cues.\nRepeat steps 2.1 - 2.5.2, omitting step 2.3 of mounting the subject's home enclosure under the maze. Doing so precludes the use of olfactory or other cues emanating from the home enclosure during maze exploration.\nDuring probe trials, subjects are free to explore the maze for the full 10 min to assess exploratory behavior. After 10 min, stop video and tracking software.\nRemove the subject from the maze and return it to its home cage.\nClean the top of the maze with the diluted soap mixture.\n4. Behavioral Measures\nNOTE: For training trials, include behavioral measures such as latency to arrive at the goal hole, number of errors made (investigation of a nongoal hole; the animal's snout must be within 1 cm of the hole), and proportion of time spent in the correct quadrant of the maze.\nFor training trials, determine a search strategy. A direct strategy is defined as descending into the goal hole with fewer than 3 errors. A serial strategy is examination of 3 or more consecutive maze holes along the perimeter of the maze. A random strategy is non-serial examination of maze holes with 3 or more errors.\n\tNOTE: For probe trials, behavioral measures include latency to arrive at the spatially correct hole, number of errors made before investigating the spatially correct hole, and the proportion of time spent in the spatially correct quadrant of the maze.\nFor a more stringent assessment of non-random choice of the spatially correct goal hole, employ sampling without replacement when calculating chance rate.",
