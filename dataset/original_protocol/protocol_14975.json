    "The study through which this protocol was implemented was approved by the Royal Marsden Committee for Clinical Research (Sutton, UK) and the Research Ethics Committee (London – Riverside, UK) (ISRCTN 53485935).\n1. Radiotherapy Clinic\nAssess patient suitability for the voluntary breath-hold technique in the clinic: left breast or chest wall radiotherapy (without nodal irradiation) recommended by radiation oncologist.\nReview the patient’s performance status and comorbidities (especially lung-related).\nAsk the patient to practice holding their breath at home, while lying down, initially for 5 sec, and building up in 5 sec intervals to 20 sec.\n2. Radiotherapy Planning-CT session\nPosition the patient on the CT couch in the standard treatment position.\nDefine the position of tattoos and place CT markers (crosses) on the patient midline in free breathing, approximately half way along the likely field edges. Add lateral markers to each side of the patient in free-breathing, in line with the midline marker.\nAsk the patient to practice taking a deep breath in and holding it, initially for 5 sec, before building up in 5 sec intervals to 20 sec. Instruct the patient to breathe in and breathe out twice before asking them to hold their breath for up to 20 sec. This relaxes the patient, helps them prepare for the breath-hold and helps breath-hold consistency.\nRecord the maximum duration for which the patient can comfortably hold their breath.\nRepeat the breath-hold and mark the position of the anterior and lateral tattoos in relation to the lasers in breath-hold to help establish reproducibility. Record the height of the lateral tattoo above the couch top during breath-hold before proceeding with the CT scan.\nGive the standard breath-hold instructions to the patient and start the scan once satisfied the patient is in breath-hold.",
    "Once the CT scan has been completed, check and record the height of the lateral tattoos on the CT scan to confirm that a consistent breath-hold was performed. If the lateral couch height differs by greater than 3 mm from the initial couch height, remeasure the anterior and lateral reference points.\n3. Radiotherapy Treatment Planning\nNOTE: The radiotherapy treatment planning process is the same as for a standard breast patient.\nApply tangential radiotherapy fields according to local protocol.\nProduce clinical radiotherapy treatment plan which fulfills ICRU criteria.\nRecord the anterior beam source-to-skin distance (SSD) in addition to recording standard treatment planning data (according to local protocol). NOTE: The anterior beam SSD is used to check the anterior-posterior setup in the treatment room.\n4. Radiotherapy Treatment Setup\nAlign the tattoos in free-breathing. Mark the posterior and inferior measurements from the left lateral tattoo and the anterior midline tattoo on the patient’s skin (from information recorded at planning-CT session).\nInstruct the patient to breathe in and out twice before taking a deep breath in and holding. The reference mark on the patient’s skin should rise up to the level of the laser. Ask the patient to repeat the breath-hold procedure a couple of times to confirm reproducibility before proceeding with patient setup.\nAsk the patient to perform a breath-hold and align the midline tattoo to the isocenter position superior/inferior and set the focus-to-surface distance (FSD) at the midline.\nIn free-breathing, move the bed laterally to the isocenter.\nMeasure and mark the medial and lateral field borders in free-breathing.\nSet all other machine parameters (e.g., field size and gantry, collimator, and couch angles) for the first beam (anterior oblique). Ask the patient to perform a breath-hold and check the medial border aligns with mark made in Step 4.5.",
    "Mark the field edge (as defined by the light field) with a pen at every fraction: this aids visualization of the patient’s breath-hold.\nRepeat steps 4.6 and 4.7 for the posterior oblique beam, and treat using this beam first.\nIf patient setup is out of tolerance (according to local tolerance levels for a standard breast radiotherapy patient), refer to the troubleshooting algorithm (Figure 2).\nIf there are insufficient cameras to monitor the field edge as well as the position of the gantry relative to the couch from the control room, assess gantry rotation prior to leaving the treatment room in order to avoid collisions.\n5. Radiotherapy Treatment Delivery\nOnce in the control room, zoom the treatment room cameras so that the field borders marked on the patient’s skin are visible on the control room monitors.\nOnce ready to commence treatment, ask the patient to perform a breath-hold (as detailed in 4.2) via the intercom system. Check the light field aligns satisfactorily with the marked field border and then commence treatment (Figure 3).\nMonitor the patient’s breath-hold during treatment delivery. Treatment should be interrupted if there is concern that there has been a change in breath-hold depth.\n6. Radiotherapy Treatment Verification\nPerform imaging verification of patient position (such as with electronic portal imaging (EPI) or cone-beam CT), following local protocols for type/frequency of imaging and tolerance levels.\nCorrect for systematic errors with isocenter moves according to local protocols for standard breast radiotherapy patients. Adjustment of marks on the patient’s skin should not be necessary."
