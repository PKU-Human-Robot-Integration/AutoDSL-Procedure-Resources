    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Weill Cornell Medicine (protocol 2020-0027) and followed proper guidelines. The following experiments were performed with male and female AB wild-type zebrafish aged 14-to-20-months post fertilization for adults, and 35-days post fertilization for juveniles.\n1. Needle pulling and reagent preparation\nPull a 1.2 mm OD (outer diameter) standard borosilicate glass capillary using a needle puller (Figure 1A,B) (see Table of Materials), into two needles using optimal settings. In this case, heat 525; pull 65; velocity 60; time 250.\nVortex commercially obtained stock colloidal solutions of MS (1% solids in water) and QD (2 µM, see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The MS colloidal solution is white in color and easily seen when injected.\nFilter 500 µL of MS stock colloidal solution through a 0.45 µm syringe filter (see Table of Materials) to minimize clogging the needle.\nTo prepare the working colloidal solution of only MS, dilute 100 µL of the filtered MS colloidal solution with 100 µL of 1x PBS (Phosphate buffered saline).\nTo prepare the working colloidal solution of MS and QD, mix 100 µL of the filtered MS colloidal solution with 100 µL of the QD colloidal solution.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the experiment, MS, and QD can be mixed or injected individually.\nPrepare and arrange the necessary reagents and equipment: stereoscope, wet sponge, micromanipulator, injector, 20 µL pipette, tricaine solution, straight iridectomy scissors, forceps, pulled needles, microloader femtotips, recovery tanks, and nets as shown in Figure 1D (see Table of Materials).\nTurn on the injector air supply and set up the gated injection pulse rather than the timed injection pulse.",
    "​NOTE: For the instrumental details, please see Table of Materials. Some instruments require the injection pedal to be inserted into the gated input port on the instrument's back side.\n2. Injection station preparation and zebrafish preparation\nTurn on the dissecting microscope and adjust the focus.\nWith microloader pipette tips, load the control solution (e.g., 0.05% phenol red in 1x PBS).\nInsert the needle into the needle holder of the microinjector.\nUnder the dissecting microscope, cut the pulled needle at 1 mm from the tip using forceps.\n\tNOTE: Cutting the needle as narrow as possible is optimal for piercing the myocardium. However, if the needle is too narrow, it may bend when trying to penetrate the cardiac tissue.\nSet the appropriate injection pressure to around 0.50 kPa/7.3 psi, and the balance pressure to around 0 psi so there is no liquid retraction into the needle (Figure 1C).\nOnce the desired pressure is reached, test the injection setup, and record the time taken to inject a bolus of solution into mineral oil that is less than 1 mm in diameter (<0.5 µL).\n\tNOTE: Ideally, the injection must release the fluid at approximately 50 nL/s to give an approximate bolus diameter of 0.8 mm in 5 s. Depending on the tip diameter of the needle, adjustments in time and pressure can be made to inject 0.25-0.3 µL into a single fish over a 5 s injection. Higher injection pressure, as opposed to a longer injection time, is desirable to ensure that the high interstitial tissue pressure can be overcome during the injection.\nLoad the needle with the selected volume (e.g., 10-15 µL, Figure 1B) of injection solution and repeat steps 2.5-2.6.",
    "NOTE: Gated injections will allow one to inject for as long as the foot pedal is pressed, allowing for adjustments of the tip position to be made until the right intratissue injection site is found.\nInsert the needle loaded with injection solution into the needle holder of the microinjector.\n3. Injection\nPrepare a grooved sponge by carving a fish-like outline in the middle.\nPrepare the working concentration of tricaine by diluting 4.2 mL of stock solution (4 mg/mL) into 100 mL of fish facility water (see Table of Materials) in a crystallizing dish.\nAnesthetize the zebrafish in tricaine solution until the movement of the gills is reduced and it has stopped swimming.\n\tNOTE: Pinch the tail to confirm the loss of response in anesthetized zebrafish.\nPosition the zebrafish with its ventral side facing the objective lens in the moistened grooved sponge under the dissecting microscope (Figure 2A and Figure 3A).\nUse iridectomy scissors to make a small transverse cut at the level of the pectoral fins and open the chest cavity (Supplementary Video 1).\nWith forceps, gently peel away the pericardium to expose the apex of the heart (Figure 3B).\nWith the loaded needle holder in hand, direct the needle toward the apex of the ventricle at an acute angle of <30° to the body axis.\nInsert a 0.1-0.2 mm needle into the heart without penetrating too deep into the ventricle (Figure 2B and Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: If the tip end of the needle fills with blood, retract the needle slightly to avoid injecting the MS and QD into the ventricular lumen.",
    "With the needle inserted into the heart apex, slightly raise the ventricle away from the body by reducing the angle between the needle and the body axis while moving the needle tip toward the base of the heart (Figure 2C and Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: The needle may be faintly visible through the myocardial wall.\nPush the needle further toward the head so the needle tip moves toward the myocardium surface.\nInject by pressing the pedal of the microinjection device for ~1-5 s or until a white spot is visible within the heart tissue (Figures 2C and Figure 3C,D).\nIf the chest cavity starts filling with injection fluid while injecting, it indicates that the needle tip has completely penetrated the myocardium (Figure 2D). Withdraw the needle slowly until a buildup of microbeads is visible within the tissue.\nReposition the needle tip if the fluid is injected into the ventricular lumen and cleared with the subsequent heartbeat (Figure 2E). In such a situation, lift the tip of the needle and push the needle toward the direction of the head until the injection pressure results in a white spot in the tissue.\nIf no white fluid or spot is visible, then the injection needle is blocked. In such a situation, retract the needle fully. To continue the experiment, either slightly break the tip of the needle or replace the needle. In both cases, check the injection flow prior to reinjecting the myocardium.\nAfter successful injection, gently withdraw the needle from the myocardium (Figure 3F) and immediately transfer the zebrafish into a recovery tank with fish facility water.\nMonitor the fish until it totally recovers from the tricaine.\nTransfer the recovered fishes into a 2.8 L tank and place it in the fish facility, until the desired time point for heart extraction.",
    "4. Heart extraction and imaging\nPrepare the working concentration of tricaine by diluting 4.2 mL of stock solution (4 mg/mL) into 100 mL of fish facility water in a crystallizing dish.\nTerminally anesthetize the zebrafish in tricaine solution until the movement of the gills has stopped and it is unresponsive.\nTransfer the zebrafish to a moistened grooved sponge under the dissecting microscope positioned ventral side facing the objective lens.\nOpen the ventral wall of the chest with iridectomy scissors at the level of the pectoral fins.\nOpen the pericardial sac and locate the outflow track of the heart. Use forceps to grasp the aorta anterior to the Bulbous Arteriosus (BA) and carefully pull them up with the base of the ventricle.\nWith the anterior pole of the heart raised, cut the ventral aorta/sinus venosus to release the heart and place in a 35 mm Petri dish containing PBS.\nUsing forceps, remove any blood clots and fix the heart in 4% PFA (wt/vol) for 15 min.\nImage the hearts using a microscope capable of acquiring the fluorescent wavelengths used.\n\tNOTE: In the example date, a confocal microscope with 405, 488, 567, and 647 laser lines was used.\nUse ImageJ/Fiji software (see Table of Materials) for image analysis.\n\tNOTE: Calculation of QD or MS enrichment was performed using the high or low thresholding and create selection functions with the lymphatic vessel channel to first select regions of lymphatic vessels and those lacking vessel signal. Then, the Measure function was used to measure pixel intensity of the QD or MS channel from which a ratio of the two selections were calculated.\nSubscription Required.
