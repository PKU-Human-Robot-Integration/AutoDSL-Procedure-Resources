    "Dissociation of primary human skeletal muscle tissueNote: All steps in this protocol should be performed in a sterile laminar flow biosafety cabinet using sterile tissue culture technique. Human skeletal muscle can only be obtained following approval from the Institutional IRB. We obtain de-identified, discarded skeletal muscle tissue under a protocol approved by Boston Children’s Hospital IRB. Pre-weigh one 10 cm tissue culture plate with lid, and place the tissue sample to be dissociated in a second (non pre-weighed) 10 cm tissue culture plate.Using sterile scalpels, remove any connective tissue from the muscle biopsy. Tissue should be kept moist. Add a few drops of sterile 1x HBSS as necessary to prevent it from drying out. Place muscle tissue in the pre-weighed 10 cm tissue culture plate, replace lid, and weigh the plate again. Subtract from this number the tare of the empty plate to calculate the amount of muscle tissue to be dissociated.Thaw frozen aliquots of dispase II and collagenase D in a 37 °C water bath. Thawed collagenase D stock solution (see Recipes) and dispase II stock (see Recipes) will be added at a volume of 3.5 ml each per gram of muscle tissue to be dissociated. Thaw only the amounts of collagenase D and dispase II necessary for dissociation. If an excess of enzymes is thawed, it can be refrozen once and re-used.Using sterile scalpels, mince muscle tissue until it resembles a fine paste. During mincing, add a few drops of sterile 1x HBSS to prevent exposed tissue from drying out. Tissue should always appear moist, but with no excess of liquid.After tissue is finely minced, add equal amounts of the thawed dispase II and collagenase D solutions. The final concentration will be 5 mg/ml for collagenase D and 1.2 U/ml for dispase II in this solution.",
    "Pipette minced tissue and enzyme solution up and down through a sterile wide-bore 25 ml pipette a few times.Incubate plate in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C for 15 min.Pipette the digestion solution up and down through a sterile 25 ml pipette a few times and incubate again for 15 min. Repeat this step additional 1-2 times, until the slurry easily passes through a sterile 5 ml pipette and all tissue chunks are dissolved. The total digestion time will range between 45 min and 1 h 15 min.Add 2 volumes of complete growth medium (see Recipes) (based on the total volume of dispase II and collagenase D) to the digested slurry and filter the digestion solution through a 100 µm cell strainer over a 50 ml conical tube. Change cell strainer if it appears clogged.Pellet cells for 10 min at 1,100 x g, RT.Resuspend the pellet in 1 volume of complete growth medium (i.e., 3 ml) and add 7 volumes (i.e., 21 ml) of red blood cell lysis solution. Invert the tube a few times and then filter the solution through a 40 µm cell strainer over a 50 ml conical tube.Count cells using a hemocytometer, then pellet the cells for 10 min at 1,100 x g, RT. Expect approximately 107 cells/gram tissue from postnatal skeletal muscle and 108 cells/gram tissue from fetal skeletal muscle. Cell numbers vary among individuals. Freeze cells at a concentration of 1 x 107 cells/ml in ice-cold freezing medium (see Recipes). Store cryovials at -80 °C overnight, then transfer them to -150 °C where they can be permanently stored until necessary. Cell freezing is not required if all reagents and FACS equipment are immediately available.",
    "Purification of myoblasts from dissociated human skeletal muscle mononuclear cellsNote: All steps in this protocol should be performed in a sterile laminar flow biosafety cabinet using sterile tissue culture technique. Cell sorting should be performed in as clean an environment as possible, including sorting human cells under a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet, if possible. Thawing of cryopreserved sample prior to FACSCryopreserved cells should be carefully thawed and plated 1 day prior to cell sorting. This allows the cells to recover from the freezing process before undergoing FACS.Pre-warm complete growth medium in a 37 °C water bath. Then, pipette 10 ml pre-warmed medium into a sterile 50 ml conical tube.Coat sterile tissue culture-treated plates (10 cm plate) with 10 ml 0.1% gelatin (see Recipes) for 1 h at 37 °C, then remove the gelatin solution by aspiration. Let plates dry briefly in the biosafety cabinets and replace lid.Carefully and quickly thaw a vial of cryopreserved, dissociated cells in a 37 °C water bath and transfer the cells into the 50 ml conical tube with 15 ml pre-warmed proliferation medium using a 1 ml pipette. Rinse the inside of the cryovial with fresh complete growth medium to remove as many cells as possible. This step should be performed very quickly as the DMSO used during the cryopreservation process is toxic to the cells at RT.Plate the cells in the pre-warmed medium onto sterile, tissue-culture treated plates at approximately 0.5-1 x 107 cells/10 cm plate or 1.5-3 x 107 cells/15 cm plate. If using a 15 cm plate, add 15 ml pre-warmed medium to bring the total medium volume to 25 ml.Note: No plate coating is required for this step.Incubate the cells in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C overnight.",
    "If plating cells several days in advance, change the growth medium every other day and do not allow confluence to exceed 80%.Preparation of sample for FACSPre-warm complete growth medium and 1x DPBS in a 37 °C water bath. Place the 5% FBS/HBSS (see Recipes) on ice.Check the cells under a phase contrast microscope with 10x magnification. Ensure that there is no contamination and that the cells look healthy.Note: There will be many floating, live cells in your culture, which is normal for dissociated human skeletal muscle. It is also likely that there will be small clumps of cells in the culture, and the number of clumps will vary. These clumps will be filtered out prior to cell sorting. Additionally, the dissociation process results in a large amount of debris in addition to cells. This will make the culture appear ‘dirty’ (i.e., little black specks, etc.), but again, this is normal and should not be considered contamination. This debris will be removed during the FACS sample preparation process.Wash the cells with 5 ml (10 cm plate) or 10 ml (15 cm plate) of 1x DPBS at least twice or ideally three times.Pipette 2 ml (10 cm plate) or 5 ml (15 cm plate) of TrypLE ExpressTM dissociation enzyme onto the plate and incubate in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C for 2 min. Check under the microscope if cells have lifted and are now floating freely in the medium. If cells still adhere to the plate, gently tap the bottom of the plate to loosen the cells and return the plate to the incubator for another minute.",
    "After incubation, remove the cells by gently swirling the medium, pipetting the cells a few times and pooling the cells to one side of the plate by tilting it at an angle (~45°), then carefully pipette the medium into the 50 ml conical tube. Note: When the plate is tilted at an angle, the cells can be seen on the surface of the plate as a light opaque coating. Repeatedly rinse gently the cells off the plate using the trypsin solution (TrypLE ExpressTM Dissociation Enzyme with Phenol Red) until this coating is no longer visible.Repeat step B2f with growth medium (5 ml for 10 cm plate and 10 ml for 15 cm plate) to collect any remaining cells and quench the TrypLETM.Note: Prolonged exposure of the cells to undiluted TrypLE ExpressTM may negatively affect the health of the cells. Addition of growth medium to the trypsinized cells will quench this effect.Check the plate under a phase contrast microscope at 10x magnification for the presence of cells. There should be very few cells on the surface of the plate after this process.Centrifuge the 50 ml conical tubes containing the cells and washes at 1,100 x g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet the cells.Remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 10 ml 5% FBS/HBSS.Determine the cell concentration using a hemocytometer or other cell counting device.For FACS controls, use 5 ml round-bottom test tubes and set aside 2.5 x 105 cells in 500 µl 5% FBS/HBSS for each of the following controls:‘Unstained’ controlCalcein blue single color controlCD56 single color controlCD82 single color controlPipette the ‘unstained’ control sample through the strainer cap of a 5 ml round-bottom test tube. Keep on ice.",
    "Note: Some FACS machines may require tubes that are different in diameter/size from the tube specified in this protocol. Check in advance that the tubes fit in the FACS machine.Centrifuge the remaining cells (to be labeled with both CD56 and CD82 antibodies or single color controls) for 10 min at 1,100 x g at 4 °C.Resuspend cells at a concentration of 1 x 107/ml in 5% FBS/HBSS.Primary antibody incubation: add CD56 and CD82 antibodies to the appropriate cell solutions at a concentration of 5 µl per 1 x 106 cells.To gate for live cells, add calcein blue at a concentration of 0.5 µl per 1 x 106 cells to the appropriate cell solutions. Gently mix and place on ice protected from the light for 30 min.Note: Calcein blue is a cell viability dye and is used in this protocol to discriminate live from dead cells during the FACS.After this incubation, wash the cells 1 x in 2ml of 5% FBS/HBSS.Centrifuge the cells for 10 min at 1,100 x g at 4 °C.Resuspend the CD56 and CD82 single color controls in 500 µl of 5% FBS/HBSS, and pipette through the strainer cap of a 5 ml round-bottom test tube. Store on ice in the dark.Resuspend the CD56/CD82/calcein blue stained cells in 1 ml of 5% FBS/HBSS, and pipette through the strainer cap of a 5 ml round-bottom test tube. Store on ice in the dark.Prepare collection tube for CD56+CD82+ sorted cells by pipetting 500 µl of growth medium into a new tube. Store on ice.Fluorescence-activated cell sortingIt is beyond the scope of this chapter to review FACS or flow cytometry in detail. Gating specifications are briefly indicated (Figure 1).Determine optimal excitation voltages and compensation values using the ‘no stain’ and single color controls.",
    "Determine the live cell population gating for calcein blue positive cells.Determine the double positive (DP) CD56+/CD82+ and double negative (DN) populations. Gate and sort for the DP cell population.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171030/20171030232610_6689.jpgFigure 1. Example of FACS gating technique for human myogenic cells immunostained with anti-CD56 and anti-CD82 antibodies using calcein AM blue as vital dye marker. A. Unstained control sample, gate on single cells; B. Calcein blue signal (calcein AM blue) to gate on live cells; C. Gated live cells stained for CD82-PE and CD56-APC. DN = double negative cells; DP = double positive cells.In vitro culture and analysis of human fetal skeletal myoblastsIn vitro cell cultureNote: All steps in this protocol should be performed in a sterile laminar flow biosafety cabinet using sterile tissue culture technique. Coat sterile tissue culture-treated plates (10 cm plate) with 10 ml 0.1% gelatin (see Recipes) for 1 h in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C, then remove the gelatin solution by aspiration. Let plates dry briefly in the biosafety cabinets and replace lid.Pre-warm complete growth medium in a water bath set to 37 °C.Resuspend sorted CD56/CD82 double positive cells at 0.5-1 x 106 cells/10 ml complete growth medium and plate on coated plates. Gently rock plate(s) to evenly distribute cells, and then incubate in a CO2 incubator. Sorted cells will be small and have a bright, rounded appearance and should attach within 1 day post-sorting (Figure 2). Propagate the cells to 65-75% confluency. This should take approximately 2-3 days; however, if necessary, replace the medium with fresh growth medium every 2 days until the plate is at 65-75% confluency.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171030/20171030232845_1887.jpgFigure 2. In vitro culture of FACS sorted CD56 and CD82 double negative (DN) and double positive (DP) human cells.",
    "(A and B) On day 1 after sorting, both DN and DP cells appear bright and rounded, while some cells have flattened and firmly adhered to the plate. (C and D) On day 7 after sorting (4 days in growth medium and 3 days in differentiation medium [see Recipes]), DN cells remain mononuclear, whereas DP cells have fused and formed multinucleated myotubes (arrows). (E and F) Examples of immunostaining for myosin heavy chain (MHC) and desmin on double-positive cells are shown.To passage cellsCoat sterile tissue culture-treated plates with 0.1% gelatin as above (as in step D1a).Pre-warm the following in a water bath set to 37 °C: 1x DPBS, TrypLETM Express dissociation enzyme, and complete growth medium.Remove medium from plate by aspiration and wash the cells twice with 10 ml (10 cm plate) 1x DPBS. Remove DPBS by aspiration.Pipette 2 ml TrypLETM Express onto the plate and incubate in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C for 2-3 min. Gently remove the cells from the plate by pipetting up and down a few times before transferring cells into a sterile conical tube. Wash any remaining cells from the surface of the plate with additional complete growth medium.Centrifuge the cells at 1,100 x g at RT for 10 min.Resuspend the cells in 10 ml fresh complete growth medium.Determine the cell concentration using a hemocytometer and plate the cells at 0.5-1 x 106 cells in 10 ml complete growth medium/10 cm plate.Cells should be passaged every 2-3 days and should not be grown past 70% confluency.Note: Cells should never reach 100% confluency when proliferating, as they will begin to differentiate and fuse on contact. The high serum growth medium will lower in serum concentration over time and will not be able to prevent fusion.",
    "To freeze cellsTrypsinize and centrifuge cells as in steps D2c-D2e.Resuspend cells in ice-cold freezing medium (10% DMSO in complete growth medium) at desired cell concentration (106-107/ml). Store cryovials at -80 °C overnight then transfer to -150 °C where they can be permanently stored until necessary.To perform an in vitro fusion assayCoat 4-well chamber slides with 0.1% gelatin.Trypsinize the cells (with TrypLE ExpressTM Dissociation Enzyme with Phenol Red) and determine the cell concentration as described above, then plate 20,000 cells in 500 µl complete growth medium/well.Incubate the cells in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C until cells are ~80% confluent.When cells are ~80% confluent, remove the growth medium from each well and replace with 500 µl pre-warmed differentiation medium (see Recipes). Incubate the cells in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator set to 37 °C overnight.Note: Low serum medium induces differentiation and fusion of myoblasts in culture (Yaffe and Saxel, 1977).Replace the differentiation medium in each well daily during the course of the fusion assay.Monitor the differentiation of the cells using a phase contrast microscope at 10x or 20x magnification. Fusion should occur within 1 week of exposure to differentiation medium (Figure 2). When mature myotubes of > 10 nuclei/myotube are present, perform the following immunocytochemistry protocol to visualize the cells by fluorescence microscopy.Immunofluorescence for in vitro fusion assayNote: This immunocytochemical protocol may also be utilized for the detection of other myogenic markers of proliferating or differentiating cells. Thaw 4% PFA (see Recipes) at RT.Carefully wash the cells with 200 µl 1x PBS/well. Remove PBS using a 1,000 µl pipette.Fix the cells with 200 µl 4% PFA for 20 min at RT; remove fixation liquid using a pipette, then permeabilize the cells with 200 µl permeabilization solution (see Recipes) for 3 min at RT.",
    "Remove permeabilization solution using a pipette, and then block the cells for 30 min at RT with 200 µl blocking solution (see Recipes).Prepare the primary antibody solution by diluting the anti-human desmin antibody 1:100 in fresh blocking solution. Incubate the cells with primary antibody solution overnight at 4 °C.Wash the cells 3 times with 1x PBS for 5 min at RT. The plate may be gently agitated on a rotating shaker.Prepare the secondary antibody solution by diluting the anti-mouse antibody 1:1,000 in blocking solution. Incubate the cells in the dark with secondary antibody solution for 1 h at RT.Wash the cells 3 times with 1x PBS for 5 min at RT in the dark. The plate may be gently agitated on a rotating shaker.Mount the cells with Vectashield with DAPI and store at 4 °C protected from light with aluminum foil.Visualize the cells by fluorescent microscopy using ultraviolet/DAPI and FITC/GFP filter sets for DAPI and desmin, respectively."
