  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The protocol below is recommended for the staining of organoids that were grown in 5 wells of a 96 well plate and pooled together (> 100 organoids). Organoids were derived from mouse mammary stem cells. Donor mice were housed and handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Rennes (France).\n1. Reagents\nTo prepare the fixative solution, dilute 125 µL of 16% paraformaldehyde (PFA) aqueous commercial solution in 375 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to generate a 4% PFA solution.\n\tCAUTION: Manipulate PFA that is a toxic substance under a chemical hood.\nTo prepare the permeabilization buffer, dilute 1.5 µL of Triton X100 in 500 µL of PBS, to produce a 0.3% Triton X100 solution.\nTo prepare the blocking buffer, dilute 1.5 µL of Tween-20 and 75 µL of normal goat serum in PBS, to generate a 5% goat serum-0.1% Tween 20 solution.\nTo prepare the light sheet mounting medium, dissolve 1 g of ultrapure low melting point agarose in 100 mL of dH20 or PBS at 65 °C. Prepare 1 mL aliquots and store at room temperature.\n2. Organoids recovery\nTransfer organoids from the culture wells to a low binding polymer 1.7 mL tube, after pipetting them up and down 3 times in the wells, with an FBS-coated tip for which the end was cut (minimal diameter of the extremity 1.5 mm).\n\tNOTE: The coating prevents organoids from sticking to the tip. The low-binding polymer material enables to reduce the attachment of organoids to the side of the tube during the entire staining procedure.\nFill the tube with PBS, and spin down at 350 x g for 3 min. Remove the supernatant.\n3. Fixation, permeabilization and blocking",
    "Resuspend the organoids in 500 µL of 4% PFA. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Spin down at 350 x g for 30 s. Remove the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: From this step onwards, resuspend organoids in the different buffers by simply adding the buffers on the pellet of organoids without touching them. Perform all washing steps at room temperature.\nWash the organoids with 1 mL of PBS for 3 min. Spin down at 350 x g for 30 s. Remove the supernatant.\n\tPAUSE: Fixed organoids can be kept in PBS at 4 °C for at least a week.\nPermeabilize the organoids by resuspending them in 500 µL of PBS-Triton X100 0.3% and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Spin down the organoids at 350 g for 30 s.\nWash the organoids by resuspending them with 1 mL of PBS and incubate for 3 min. Spin down at 350 x g for 30 s. Remove the supernatant. Repeat once.\nOptional: Resuspend the organoids in 500 µL of ice-cold methanol. Incubate at - 20 °C for 10 min. This step may be required for the staining of specific centrosomal markers.\nOptional (if step 5 was performed): Wash the organoids with 1 mL of PBS for 3 min. Spin down at 350 x g for 30 s. Remove the supernatant. Repeat once.\nBlock non-specific antibody binding sites in organoids by resuspending them with 500 µL of blocking buffer (PBS, 5% goat serum, 0.1% Tween 20). Incubate 1 h and 30 min at room temperature. Spin down at 350 g for 30 s. Remove the supernatant.\nWash the organoids by resuspending them with 1 mL of PBS and incubate for 3 min. Spin down at 350 x g for 30 s. Remove the supernatant.\n4. Labelling",
    "Resuspend the organoids with 200 µL of blocking buffer with diluted primary antibodies and incubate overnight at 4 °C with mild shaking (60 rpm on a horizontal shaker). Place the tubes with a 45° angle with the horizontal plan of the shaker. It will maintain the organoids at the bottom of the tubes in the staining buffer.\nWash the organoids by resuspending them with 1 mL of PBS and incubate for 5 min. Spin down at 350 x g for 30 s. Remove the supernatant. Repeat twice.\n\tNOTE: Some organoids in the last step may stick to the side of the tube, resulting in organoid loss during aspiration of the supernatant after centrifugation, adding 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the PBS in the washing steps may reduce organoid loss.\nResuspend the organoids with 200 µL of blocking buffer with secondary antibodies and incubate for 1 h and 30 min with mild shaking (60 rpm on a horizontal shaker). Place the tubes with a 45° angle with the horizontal plan of the shaker. It will maintain the organoids at the bottom of the tubes in the staining buffer.\n\tNOTE: Hoechst (or other nuclear dyes, such as DAPI or DRAQ5) can be added to the buffer with secondary antibodies.\nWash the organoids by resuspending them with 1 mL of PBS and incubate for 5 min. Spin down at 350 x g for 30 s. Remove the supernatant. Repeat twice.\n\t​NOTE: Some organoids in the last step may stick to the side of the tube, resulting in organoid loss during aspiration of the supernatant after centrifugation, adding 0.2% (w/v) BSA to the PBS in the washing steps may reduce organoid loss.\n5. Preparation of the agarose sample for imaging",
    "Melt light sheet mounting medium by incubating it at 65 °C. Once the medium has melted, incubate it at 37 °C for 5 min.\nResuspend the organoids in 100 µL of mounting medium using a 200 µL tip, with the extremity of the tip cut (minimal size of the extremity: 1.5 mm), by pipetting up and down twice.\nSuck the mounting medium with the organoids in a glass capillary (green capillary, inner diameter: 1.5 mm) using a plunger. Incubate the capillary at room temperature for 5 min for the mounting medium to solidify.\n\tPAUSE: Capillary can be stored in PBS at 4 °C for a week before imaging.\n6. Imaging\nUsing a light sheet microscope (e.g., ZEISS Lightsheet Z.1), image the organoids with 20x or 40x water immersion objectives.\n\t\nPlace the glass capillary in the observation chamber. Locate the capillary with the front camera and place the tip of the glass capillary at the upper limit of the detection objective.\nSelect the sample and set the optimal focus using the tip of the glass capillary in brightfield illumination. Push out the agarose sample slowly from the capillary and locate organoids within the solidified agarose.\nKeep the organoids to be imaged close to the tip of the capillary, to reduce movements of the agarose sample in the PBS. Rotate the capillary to set the optimal sample orientation and define the desired zoom.\nSelect acquisition mode. Define the channels to image, set proper orientations of the light sheet, set the laser power for each channel (to reduce photobleaching, use low laser power), set the size of the image and the desired illumination side(s). Example of imaging parameters: Image size 1920 x 1920, illumination: dual side.",
    "Define the Z-stack to image by setting the Z-extremities of the stack using the Z-stack module and set the Z-step size to optimal.\nProcess the output file using the image processing module of the microscope software to navigate in the sample, obtain a Z-projection and 3D-representation.\nTurn the sample and acquire a new image from a different angle or image other organoids.\nAnalyze images with an interactive microscopy image analysis software (e.g., Imaris) enabling (i) the visualization of the sample in 3D (ii) the segmentation of objects (iii) identification and quantitative analysis of objects.\nSubscription Required.
