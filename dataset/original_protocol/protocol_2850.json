    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      IELs and LPLs were separated either from intestinal graft biopsy specimens\n      or surgically obtained intestinal graft specimens at the time of stoma\n      closure/revision, according to a protocol adapted from previous reports5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\n      and used in our previous studies.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nIsolating intraepithelial lymphocytes\nTiming: 1 h\n      These steps isolate IELs from patient samples. The epithelial integrity of\n      ileal biopsy is disrupted by DTT, a reducing agent, and EDTA, a calcium\n      chelator that targets calcium-dependent junctions and promotes the\n      detachment of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). The DTT and EDTA\n      incubation steps liberate IELs and IECs into the medium without altering\n      the basement membrane.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] Supernatant collected from\n      both steps are combined to enrich IELs.\n    \n        Collect research ileoscope samples from consented patients during\n        clinical endoscopy. Each patient sample consists of 1–4 ileal biopsy\n        pieces, ideally around 4–6 mm3 per piece, from one patient at\n        one timepoint (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2558-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1. Isolating intraepithelial lymphocytes\n            \n              (A) Collect research samples, which consist of 1–4 ileal biopsy\n              pieces from consented patient during clinical endoscopy.\n            \n              (B) Place the sample into the DTT buffer in the labeled 125 mL\n              ventilated flask a with sterile stir bar.\n            \n              (C) Place the flask into the prewarmed water bath beaker at 37°C,\n              ensuring the water level in the beaker is above the buffer level\n              in the flask.\n            \n              (D) Filter DTT cell suspension through 40 μm single-cell strainer\n              into 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension, pouring\n              off the supernatant after and resuspending the pellet in 5 mL MLR\n              media.\n            \n              (E) Add 20 mL prewarmed EDTA buffer to the flask. Ensure the\n              sample is floating in the buffer.\n            \n              (F) Filter EDTA cell suspension through 40 μm single-cell strainer\n              into the 50 mL conical tube from the previous DTT step with MLR\n              media.\n            \nCritical: Ileal biopsies should be",
    "processed the same day they are collected, and no later than the next day.\n      If a specimen will not be immediately processed, it should be stored in a\n      sterile vial with saline solution or MLR media at 4°C.\n    \n        For each patient sample, add 20 mL of prewarmed DTT buffer to a sterile\n        125 mL flask.\n      \n        Transfer the ileal biopsy piece(s) into the 125 mL flask, ensuring each\n        piece is floating in the DTT buffer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\n      \n        Place the flask into the prewarmed water bath beaker set on the hot\n        plate stirrer.\n      \nNote: The water level in the beaker should\n      be above the buffer level in the flask but below the flask cap (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). If there is a large volume of buffer being used, such as when\n      processing larger pieces of tissue, this is not necessary. The flask\n      should sit still in the beaker. If it is floating, consider adding a\n      weight on top of the flask.\n    \nNote: A 37°C incubator with agitation\n      could be used for each incubation, but the beaker with hot plate stirrer\n      may be optimal: because a stir bar is better at ensuring the small biopsy\n      pieces move around in the buffer for efficient cell isolation.\n      Additionally, each hotplate stirrer functions independently. When\n      processing different tissue samples from multiple patients at once, it is\n      useful to be able to adjust each incubation setting on its own.\n    \n        Incubate biopsy pieces in DTT buffer with constant stirring,\n        125–150 rpm, for 20 min at 37°C.\n      \nNote: If processing larger pieces of\n      tissue, the stirring rate can be increased to 150–250 rpm.\n    \n        Allow pieces to settle to the bottom of the flask and filter the DTT\n        cell suspension through a 40 μm strainer into a 50 mL conical tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).",
    "Centrifuge the DTT cell suspension at 465 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\n        Pour off the supernatant to retain the cell pellet.\n      \n        Add 5–10 mL MLR media to the cell pellet in the conical tube and keep it\n        on ice.\n      \n        Add 20 mL prewarmed EDTA buffer to the flask (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\n      \n        Incubate biopsy pieces in EDTA buffer with constant stirring,\n        150–200 rpm, for 30 min at 37°C.\n      \nCritical: Between incubation steps,\n      biopsy pieces can adhere to the flask wall while the cell suspension from\n      the previous incubation is poured through the cell strainer. If the tissue\n      pieces stay in this position during subsequent incubations, they will dry\n      up and cell viability and yield will be negatively impacted. Thus, it is\n      important to ensure each biopsy piece is re-submerged in the new buffer\n      before proceeding with the next incubation.\n    \n        Allow pieces to settle to bottom of the flask and filter the EDTA cell\n        suspension through 40 μm strainer into the 50 mL conical tube that\n        already has the DTT cell suspension (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\n      \n        Centrifuge the DTT and EDTA cell suspension at 465 × g for 5 min\n        at 4°C.\n      \nPour off the supernatant to retain the cell pellet.\n        Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL MLR media, transfer to a 5 mL flow\n        cytometry tube with a cap, and keep on ice or in a refrigerator at 4°C.\n      \nIsolating lamina propria lymphocytes\nTiming: 1.25 h\n      These steps subsequently isolate LPLs from the patient samples. The lamina\n      propria regions of ileal biopsies are disrupted by the collagenase D\n      treatment.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\n        Add 25 mL of prewarmed LPL buffer to the 125 mL flask, ensuring the\n        biopsies are submerged in the LPL buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2558-Fig2.jpg\n              Figure 2.

    "sample is in the buffer.\n            \n              (B) Filter LPL cell suspension through 40 μm single-cell strainer\n              into new 50 mL conical tube.\n            \n              (C) Wash the sides of the 125 mL flask with 25 mL MLR media and\n              filter contents through 40 μm single-cell strainer into the same\n              50 mL conical tube with the LPL cell suspension.\n            \n        Place the flask back into the beaker and incubate with constant\n        stirring, 150–200 rpm, at 37°C for 1–1.5 h.\n      \nCritical: During longer incubation\n      periods, it is especially important to periodically monitor the water bath\n      temperature to ensure it does not exceed 37°C, as incubating the tissue at\n      higher temperatures may reduce cell viability and yield. Adjust the\n      hotplate settings if the temperature begins to climb.\n    \n        Pour the LPL cell suspension through a 40 μm strainer into a new 50 mL\n        conical tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\n      \n        Wash the sides of the 125 mL flask with 25 mL MLR media and pour through\n        a 40 μm strainer into the 50 mL conical tube that already has the LPL\n        cell suspension (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n      \nCentrifuge at 465 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPour off supernatant to retain cell pellet.\n        Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL MLR media, transfer to a new 5 mL flow\n        cytometry tube with a cap, and keep on ice or in a refrigerator at 4°C.\n      \nNote: Collagenase D function is\n      calcium-dependent, and its activity is inhibited by low temperature and\n      reagents such as EDTA, DTT, and 2-ME.\n    \nPause point: The experiment can be\n      paused at this point, ideally for no longer than 4 h, before proceeding to\n      flow cytometry staining. However, proceeding with the antibody staining\n      steps sooner is suggested to ensure better viability of cells.\n    \nAntibody staining for flow cytometric analysis\nTiming: 1.25 h",
    "These steps stain the IELs and LPLs isolated from patient samples with\n      various antibodies in an 18-color panel (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\n    \n      Prior to antibody staining and acquisition of patient samples,\n      fluorescence compensation of the antibody panel must be performed on the\n      flow cytometer that will be used for cell acquisition (in this case, the\n      BD LSR II). This is critical because different fluorophores can have\n      partially overlapping emission spectra, and it is necessary to correct for\n      this fluorescence spillover.\n    \n      To perform fluorescence compensation, stain single color controls\n      (0.5 × 106 PBMCs isolated from a healthy human donor per\n      control) for each fluorophore (general ratio for each Ab is 10 μL diluted\n      Ab at pre-determined titer per 1 × 106 cells, where the cells\n      are already resuspended at a ratio of 10 × 106 cells/mL in FACS\n      buffer), in addition to an unstained control (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). When acquiring each single-color control on the flow cytometer, adjust\n      voltage settings such that the target fluorophore displays the highest\n      mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in comparison to the spillover seen in\n      the other fluorophores to minimize ambiguity on the origin of fluorescence\n      and compensate the full panel.\n    \nAdd 1 mL FACS buffer to each flow cytometry tube.\nCentrifuge samples at 465 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\n        Pour off the supernatant and, keeping the tube inverted, quickly touch\n        tube rim with a clean Kim Wipe to absorb away any last drops of\n        supernatant.\n      \nResuspend cells at 10 × 106 cells/mL in FACS buffer.\nNote: For samples around the ideal size,\n      it can be assumed that there are 0.5 × 106 cells in each IEL\n      and LPL flow cytometry tube. This cell count for antibody staining is an\n      overestimation of the targeted CD45+ cell population based on",
    "our previous flow cytometry data from patient biopsies, where around\n      2,000–100,000 CD45+ cells were obtained from up to 4 ileal\n      biopsy pieces around the ideal size described earlier. Given that the\n      target cell number from these biopsies is low, we omit the regular\n      counting step to save more cells for chimerism and phenotypic analysis.\n    \nNote: When larger tissue pieces are\n      processed and stained (for example, from a stoma revision/closure, or\n      graft explant), perform cell counting and adjust the amount of each\n      antibody needed for staining.\n    \n        Stain each cell sample with Fc block, pipetting up and down to mix.\n      \nNote: The general ratio for Fc block\n      staining is 5 μL Fc block per 1 × 106 cells, where the cells\n      are already resuspended at a ratio of 10 × 106 cells/mL in FACS\n      buffer.\n    \nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nStain each sample with the prepared primary antibody master mix.\nNote: The general ratio for antibody\n      staining is 10 μL diluted of each Ab at a pre-determined titer per\n      1 × 106 cells, where the cells are already resuspended at a\n      ratio of 10 × 106 cells/mL in FACS buffer. In the situation of\n      a 18-color panel staining (including DAPI) where the Ab cocktail volume\n      (5 μL × 17 = 85 μL) is greater than the volume of FACS buffer (50 μL) used\n      to reconstitute 0.5 × 106 cells at 10 × 106/mL, at\n      least a 2-fold lower dilution should be used of each Ab (e.g.: 1:4) rather\n      than the titer selected at the time of Ab titration of a single color\n      panel (e.g., 1:8).\n    \n        Incubate for 30 min at 4°C in the dark, ideally in a fridge at 4°C.\n        However, placing the cell samples in a bucket of ice with a lid should\n        also work.",
