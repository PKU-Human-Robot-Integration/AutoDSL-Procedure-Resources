  "procedures": [
    "1. Resuspend 75 mg of Azocoll with 50 ml of 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4. \n  2. Gently swirl the suspension at room temperature for 2 h. \n  3. Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 x g at room temperature for 10 min. \n  4. Remove the supernatant containing the degraded peptide which may cause high background in protease activity assay.   \n  5. Repeat steps 1 to 4. \n  6. Resuspend the washed Azocoll reagent in 50 ml of 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4.  This is ready for further protease activity assay. \n  7. For protease activity assay, incubate 100 &#x3BC;l of the protease under examination with 400 &#x3BC;l of the Azocoll reagents from step 6, under gentle end-to-end rotation at room temperature for 2 h.  Set up triplicates for each sample. \n  8. Centrifuge the reaction mixture at 10,000 x g at room temperature for 10 min. \n  9. Transfer the supernatant to a 96 well microtitre plate.\n  10. Monitor the absorbance at 550 nm using ELISA reader. \n  11. The protease activity is presented as the A550 of the incubation supernatant."
