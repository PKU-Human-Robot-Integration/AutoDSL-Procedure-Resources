    "1. Cleaning Glass Cover-slides and Observation Chambers\nArrange the glass cover-slides on a multi-slide tray made of an inert material like Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).\nImmerse the tray with slides and the observation chamber in a surfactant solution (any product recommended for cleaning quartz cuvettes is suitable).\nUsing an ultrasonic bath, ultra-sonicate in the surfactant solution for 30 min at room temperature (between 20 and 30 °C).\nRinse 5 times with ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ.cm, 0.059 µS/cm).\nUltra-sonicate in surfactant solution for 30 min at room temperature (between 20 and 30 °C).\nRinse 10 times with ultrapure water.\nRepeat steps 1.5 and 1.6 twice.\nStore in water at room temperature (between 20 and 30 °C) for up to one week.\n2. Fabrication of Protein Nano-dots\nDeposition of beads\n\t\nDeposit the suspension of silica beads (2% v/v, 70 µL) drop by drop on a cover-slide (24 x 24 mm, thickness 170 µm) held at an inclination of 15 degrees.\nLet the suspension spread for about 1 min while flipping the glass by 90° every 15 s.\nAllow the liquid to evaporate under ambient conditions.\nStore in a clean glass or PTFE chamber at ambient conditions for up to 2 days.\nDeposition of aluminum\n\t\nPlace the slides (prepared in section 2.1) inside a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering equipment 8, on a rotating table at a distance of about 105 mm from an aluminum (99%) : silicon (1%) target.\nPump down the deposition chamber to 2.6 x 10-4 Pa using a turbo-molecular pump. This step is important for the removal of possible gaseous impurities.\nIntroduce pure Argon atmosphere (5N, 99.999%) with a flux of 10 s.c.c.m. at a pressure of 0.8 Pa (6.6 mTorr).",
    "NOTE: The incoming argon flux is controlled by a mass flow controller and the process pressure is monitored using a pressure gauge. The argon gas flow is continuous and is controlled by a balance between the inlet and outlet opening valves.\nSwitch on the RF power generator.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, a typical range of 400-600 W radiofrequency power at 13.56 MHz frequency was used. The RF generator is used with a matching network in a capacitive plasma coupling mode. The reflected power is monitored and minimized using the network adaptation.\nAfter the plasma is stabilized, sputter for 2 min keeping the shutter closed to remove possible impurities from the surface of the target.\nOpen the shutter and allow the sputtering to continue for 60 min to deposit aluminum on the glass slide to a thickness of 200 nm.\nCut the flow of argon, close the gate valve to isolate the turbomolecular pump from the deposition chamber and vent the chamber with clean nitrogen to obtain the room pressure. Recover the aluminum-coated slides. Store for up to a month in a clean and hermetically sealed glass or PTFE box under ambient conditions.\nVapor deposition of Organosilane\n\t\nImmerse the aluminum-coated slide prepared in step 2.2.6 in ultrapure water at room temperature and ultra-sonicate for 30 s in an ultrasonic bath (50 W, 50/60 Hz, between 20 and 30 °C).\nDeposit 0.5 mL of (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTES) at the bottom of a desiccator.\n\t\tCAUTION: APTES is an organosilane, which evaporates easily and is toxic. APTES should be handled only under a flow-hood and with gloves.\nPut the glass slides (prepared in 2.3.1) on a ceramic grid and place inside the desiccator.\nConnect the desiccator to a membrane pump and run at maximum power for 30 min to generate a low vacuum.",
    "Close the valve of the desiccator and switch off the pump.\nHeat the desiccator to about 50 °C for 1 h.\nOpen the desiccator and collect the slides.\nTransfer to another clean desiccator for storage for up to 48 h at room temperature (20 to 30 °C).\nDeposition of first layer of protein - bovine serum albumin labelled with biotin (BSA-biotin)\n\t\nPlace one of the slides prepared in section 2.3 on a PTFE support.\nDeposit 1 mL of 25 µg/mL BSA-biotin dissolved in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Leave for 30 min at room temperature (20 to 30 °C).\nRinse 10 times with PBS. Store the sample for up to 24 h at 4 °C away from light source.\nRemoval of aluminum mask\n\t\nIncubate the slides in a solution of NaOH in PBS (prepared by dropwise addition of 1 M NaOH to about 100 mL PBS to obtain pH≈12) over-night at room temperature (between 20 and 30 °C).\n\t\tCAUTION. NaOH is corrosive and should be handled using gloves.\nRinse 10 times in ultrapure water.\n3. Deposition of Supported Lipid Bilayer (SLB)\nCleaning the Langmuir trough\n\t\nRemove the water in the PTFE enclosure of the Langmuir trough using a pump.\nClean with a lint-free non-woven disposable towel soaked in chloroform.\n\t\tCAUTION. Chloroform is toxic and should be manipulated in a well-ventilated area, with a mask (or under a flow-hood) and with appropriate gloves.\nClean 4 times with lukewarm ultrapure water (40 to 50 °C).\nClean at least 6 times with cold ultrapure water.\nDeposition of the first lipid layer\n\t\nPlace PTFE trays in the PTFE enclosure of the Langmuir trough and then fill it with ultrapure water.\nUse the control software of the Langmuir apparatus to set the measured pressure to 0 mN/m.",
    "Use a gastight glass/metal syringe to deposit 30 µL of a 1 mg/mL lipid solution (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) in chloroform) on the surface of the water. The chloroform evaporates and the lipid molecules spontaneously form a monolayer.\nUse the control software to compress the lipid monolayer by closing the PTFE barrier till the desired pressure (27 mN/m for DOPC) is reached.\nUse the control software to dip the glass slide prepared in the section 2.5.2 into the PTFE enclosure using a motorized clamp.\nHold the slide, in the clamp, perpendicular to the air-water interface. Use the control software to raise it slowly (15 mm/min) through the interface, while maintaining a constant pressure at 27 mN/m.\nPlace in a dry environment for either immediate use or for storage up to 24 h at room temperature (between 20 and 30 °C).\nDeposition of the second lipid layer\n\t\nMaintain the surface pressure in the Langmuir trough at the desired value of 27 mN/m. Compress using the control software of the Langmuir apparatus and/or add a small amount of lipid to achieve the desired pressure.\nPlace the glass slides carrying the lipid monolayer, prepared in section 3.2.6, horizontally on the surface of the water. Ensure that each slide is floating above a PTFE tray.\nPush the glass slides down, one slide at a time, into its corresponding PTFE tray using PTFE or metal tweezers such that they are immersed in the water. Avoid tilting the slides while pushing.\nUse PTFE or metal tweezers to transfer the PTFE trays containing the slides into a crystallizer filled with ultrapure water making sure that the slides are not exposed to air.\nUse PTFE or metal tweezers to transfer, while working underwater, a bilayer coated glass slide into an observation chamber.",
    "NOTE: The observation chamber is placed under water inside the crystallizer. The observation chamber is custom made and consists of a PTFE ring with a rubber gasket and steel casings, which can be assembled underwater to make a water-tight chamber whose bottom surface is made from the glass slide previously coated with the lipid bilayer.\nClose the chamber while continuing to work under water and ensuring that about 1 mL of water is trapped inside the chamber.\nTake the assembled chamber out of the water. Make sure that it is water-tight and leakage free.\nReplace the 1 mL of ultrapure water present in the observation chamber with PBS by adding and removing 500 µL of PBS 10 times. Ensure that the chamber is never devoid of liquid.\nSLB blocking step\n\t\nIntroduce 100 µg/mL of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the observation chamber containing the slide prepared in section 3.3.6 and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (between 20 and 30 °C).\nRinse the bilayer by removing and adding 500 µL of PBS 10 times. The bilayer can be kept 24 h at 4 °C.\n4. Functionalization with Ligands\nAdd fluorescent or non-fluorescent neutravidin (NAV, a deglycosylated version of avidin not charged at pH 7) at 2 µg/mL into the chamber containing the slide prepared in section 3.4.2 for 30 min at room temperature (between 20 and 30 °C).\nRinse by adding and removing 500 µL of PBS 10 times.\nAdd biotinylated anti-CD3 at 2 µg/mL to the chamber containing the slide prepared in section 3.4.2. For double functionalization of the SLB and the dots, add Fc-ICAM1 His-tag at 5 µg/mL (here, the bilayer is made of DOPC + 1% of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) lipids). Leave for 30 min at room temperature (between 20 and 30 °C).",
    "Rinse by adding and removing 500 µL of PBS 10 times\nReplace the PBS with cell medium (PBS + 0.1% BSA) by adding and removing 500 µL of the cell medium 10 times.\nLeave 200 µL of cell medium in the chamber with the slide.\nPlace the chamber for 10 min at 37 °C before adding cells.\n5. Cell Deposition (see reference 7 for details)\nCarefully deposit 400 µL of the cell suspension into the chamber. Incubate the cells for 30 min at 37 °C.\nFix the cell with 2% of paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at 37 °C. Replace the PFA with PBS by repeated removal and addition of 500 µL of PBS.\n6. Observation\nProteo-lipidic Nano-pattern and SLB fluidity\n\t\nUse a fluorescence microscope to image the protein pattern in epi-fluorescence mode using appropriate illumination wavelength (639 nm) and filter cubes (e.g. here, EX TBP 483+564+642; BS TFT 506+582+659; EM TBP 526+601+688).\n\t\tNOTE: The intensity of the signal can be quantified to estimate the amount of protein inside and outside the dot. Use an appropriate illumination wavelength (330 nm) and filter cube to image the bilayer (BP 365/12, FT 395, LP 397), which appears bright with dark holes.\nUse continuous photo bleaching (CPB) technique13,15 to measure the diffusion constant of tracer lipids in the bilayer. This observation is preferably made just after the SLB deposition.",
    "NOTE: In order to quantify the diffusion constant, two parameters are measured during CPB process: the specific bleaching time of the dye (tauT) and the decay length of the fluorescent profile of the halo formed around the bleached area (tauD). The first is obtained by plotting the time evolution of the fluorescence intensity at the center of the illuminated field during the CPB process. The second is obtained by plotting the intensity profile at the edge of the illuminated zone (averaged over 12 lines and 5 images after steady-state is reached). The curves are fitted to obtain tauT and tauD. The diffusion constant is given by tauD2/ tauT (D=imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55060/55060eq1.jpg).\nSubscription Required.
