    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committee of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for performing this study.\n1. Patient selection\nSelect patients with a malignant tumor in the middle section of the liver, including patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).\nEnsure that these patients show no invasion of the portal or hepatic vein and no distant metastasis.\n2. Patient preparation\nNOTE: The patients were classified preoperatively as Child-Pugh A13.\nAdminister antiviral drugs, such as entecavir or tenofovir (see Table of Materials), to the patients 1 week before the operation in case they are detected with hepatitis B. In our study,tThe ICG retention rate at 15 min was <10%.\nPerform three-dimensional reconstruction in advance14. In our study, the future liver remnant (FLR) accounted for >50% of the standard liver volume (SLV).\n3. Surgical technique\nPreoperative preparation\n\t\nPlace the patient in a supine position, with the legs open and lying on the right side. Perform standard general anesthesia involving tracheal intubation and controlled ventilation.\n\t\tNOTE: The dosage of anesthesia varies widely from patient to patient, determined mainly based on patient characteristics, age, and other medical conditions.\nEnsure that the surgeon stands on the right and the assistant on the left. Place the camera in the middle of the trocar sites and the camera holder in the middle.\nPlace the trocar (see Table of Materials) as illustrated in Figure 1.\nPrepare fluorescent laparoscopic equipment and B-ultrasound with a laparoscopic probe (see Table of Materials).\nExploration phase\n\t\nPerform abdominal cavity exploration from the epigastrium to the hypogastrium from left to right to reveal ascites, cirrhosis, and abdominal adhesions.",
    "Perform intraoperative ultrasound exploration of the liver. Evaluate the tumor size, location, relationship with surrounding blood vessels, and variations in the MHV and RHV.\n\t\tNOTE: The tumor size is measured by intraoperative ultrasound. The relevant data are presented in Table 1.\nCholecystectomy and presetting of the hepatoduodenal ligament occlusion band\n\t\nAnatomize Calot's triangle. Then, cut the cystic duct 5 mm from the common duct. Perform retrograde dissection of the gallbladder.\nPerform the hepatoduodenal ligament occlusion with a cotton string by using the Pringle maneuver15.\nPerform intermittent occlusion of the first porta hepatis by blocking for 15 min and opening for 5 min. Shorten the blocking time to 10 min for patients with obvious cirrhosis.\nResection of segments 4, 5, and 8\n\t\nFirst, separate the liver parenchyma by resecting at 1 cm on the right side of the falciform ligament. Ligate and transect several branches of the segment 4 Glisson pedicle16 using clips.\nSecond, separate the right anterior hepatic pedicle along the Laennec's capsule4. Ligate or occlude the right anterior hepatic pedicle.\nAdminister a peripheral injection of 2 mL of 1:100 diluted ICG (see Table of Materials) for negative staining, to define the boundary between the right anterior section and the right posterior section (Figure 2).\nDissect the liver parenchyma along the right fluorescent border. Transect the right anterior hepatic pedicle using a linear stapler after obtaining sufficient space.\nSeparate the MHV at the root and transect it using a linear stapler.\nUnder fluorescence tracing, reserve the trunk of the RHV, and transect the V5d and V8d branches of the RHV17. Finish resecting the specimens.",
    "NOTE: ICG (25 mg ICG to 100 mL of sterile water) was diluted at a ratio of 1:100 for injection. Appropriate liver-cutting instruments, such as an ultrasonic scalpel, bipolar, cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspirator, etc., should be used, according to the surgeon's preference.\nResection of segments 5 and 8\n\t\nSeparate the right anterior hepatic pedicle along the Laennec's capsule.\nPerform a peripheral injection of 2 mL of 1:100 diluted ICG for negative staining to define the boundaries between the left, right anterior, and right posterior sections (Figure 3).\nFirst, process the left resection plane. Dissect the liver parenchyma along the left fluorescent border, preserve the trunk of the MHV, and transect the V5v and V8v branches of the MHV.\nThen, transect the right anterior hepatic pedicle using a linear stapler after obtaining sufficient space.\nNext, dissect the liver parenchyma along the right fluorescent border. Preserve the trunk of the RHV, and transect the V5d and V8d branches of the RHV. Finish resecting the specimen.\nHemostasis of residual liver after hepatectomy\n\t\nCarefully check the residual liver and close the bleeding points one by one using bipolar electrocoagulation.\nSpecimen examination\n\t\nAfter the surgery, visually confirm that the specimen margin is negative. Additionally, examine the specimens to confirm that the tumor capsule is complete and measure the distance from the tumor to the cutting edge.\nImmerse the specimens in formalin and send them to the pathology department. The operation is successful if the capsule is complete or the incision margin is >1 cm.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
