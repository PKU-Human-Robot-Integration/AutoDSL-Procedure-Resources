    "1. Start-up\nActivate the whole pyrolysis and condensation system by starting the auxiliary N2 supply and the pyrolysis gas fan. Flush the pyrolysis test rig with 500 L hr-1 of nitrogen during standby. Regulate the fan by opening the fan's menu in the process control and adjusting its nominal volumetric flow such that the pressure in the reactor is 3-8 mbar above ambient pressure.\n\tCaution: Especially during start-up, there is an increased risk of build-up of explosive atmospheres. The system must be completely inert in order to mitigate this risk.\nFill the bio-oil cycle (i.e., organic-rich condensate) with an appropriate amount of ethylene glycol as the starting medium for the quenching system to allow safe operation of the pump and homogenizer (e.g., 15 kg in the example given). Record the weight of the starting material.\nFill the aqueous condensate cycle with an appropriate amount of water to allow safe operation of the pump (e.g., 7 kg in the example given). Record the weight of starting material.\nHeat up the system, including the heat carrier heater and all auxiliary heaters, by opening their menus in the process control and entering the desired values (e.g., around 500 °C). Auxiliary heating is recommended for the reactor itself and the connecting pipes up to the first condenser in order to prevent uncontrolled condensation of vapors.\nStart the cooling cycle for the heat exchangers in both condensation cycles by switching on the cooler.",
    "Start the pumps of both condensation cycles by opening their menus in the process control and click on activate. Use the same menus to adjust the mass flow to provide enough cooling power. For example, recirculate the bio-oil at a rate of around 350 kg hr-1 and cool it down to 80 °C before spraying it into the quenching vessel. Recirculate the aqueous condensate at a rate of around 600 kg hr-1 and, in addition, supply cooling water at a rate of 300 kg hr-1 at 8 °C.\nSwitch on the electrostatic precipitator.\nAfter both condensation cycles have run for 10-20 min, check the nozzles of the quenching system for blocking and remove any blockage present.\nStart the heat carrier loop by opening the menu of the bucket elevator and the heat carrier feeding screw in the process control and click on activate. Set the heat carrier temperature to a value above the desired reactor temperature in order to allow a smoother start-up by accounting for the heat requirements for the pyrolysis reaction. For example, supply the heat carrier with a mass flow of 1,000 kg hr-1 at a temperature of 520 °C during operation, but heat to 545 °C before starting the biomass feed.\n\tCaution: Make sure that the twin-screws of the reactor are started automatically once the heat carrier feeding screw is activated. Otherwise there is the risk of blocking and even damage to the feeding system.\nAfter the system (i.e., all temperatures) has reached the set values, start feeding biomass by filling the biomass storage with the desired feedstock. Subsequently, open the lock hopper and start the biomass feeding screw by clicking on activate in their menus in the process control. Slowly increase the feed rate in order to prevent excessive pressure fluctuations.",
    "2. Steps and Observations Continuously Required during Operation\nRecord the amount of biomass fed in order to account for balancing and take appropriate samples.\nCheck for the desired reactor temperature (exit temperature of the heat carrier) and regulate the heating of the heat carrier loop accordingly.\nRegulate the fan by adjusting its nominal volumetric flow to keep the desired reactor pressure.\nCheck for blocking in the nozzles of the quenching system (drop in mass flow and/or increase in quenching temperature).\nObserve the pressure drop across the cyclones and the quenching system in order to detect excessive scaling early enough. Install appropriate measures to be able to remove excessive scaling during operation, especially at the point of the first temperature drop of the pyrolysis vapors (usually the inlet of the quenching system).\n\t\nFor example, clean the tube's cross section by using a rod to remove scaling mechanically. Seal the rod with a gasket to prevent intake of air into the quenching system. Install a ball valve at the inlet point of the rod to further decrease air leakage if the cleaning is not in operation.\n\t\tCaution: Cleaning the inlet of the quenching system by inserting a rod leads to temporary blockage of the gas removal from the reactor. Biomass feeding must be stopped if it cannot be assured that the cleaning is performed in <10 sec.\nMonitor the condensation temperatures of both condensation cycles and adapt the temperature set-points of the process thermostats if necessary.\nRemove condensate from cycles as soon as 80% of the maximum allowable filling level has been reached (depending on the size of the buffer tanks and the amount and type of biomass fed).\nConduct measurements of the gas phase. Measure the amount of gas as well as its composition (see details in step 4.5).",
    "NOTE: Primary gaseous compounds include N2, CO, CO2, CH4, O2, and H2. Additional compounds are to be expected, such as C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8. An example of a gas measurement system is described below (see step 4.5).\n\tCaution: If parts of the pyrolysis unit are operated under pressure, leakage of air may lead to the development of an explosive atmosphere. It is highly recommended to closely observe the amount of oxygen in the pyrolysis gas.\n3. Shutdown\nTo stop the experiment, simply turn off the biomass feed and regulate the fan to keep the desired reactor pressure.\nAllow the system (heat carrier loop and condensation cycles) to run for another 30-40 min to ensure that all remainders are pyrolyzed and the products recovered.\nTurn off the heating of the heat carrier loop.\nTurn off the pumps of both condensation cycles and the electrostatic precipitator.\nEmpty both condensate cycles and record the weight of each condensate. Subtract the amount of starting material (see steps 1.2 and 1.3) before setting up the balances.\nAllow the containers for char collection to cool down to room temperature in an inert atmosphere. Weigh the amount of char.\n\tCaution: The char may exhibit pyrophoric characteristics, and specific care should be taken when handling this material.\nClean the bio-oil cycle with fresh ethylene glycol and the aqueous condensate cycle with a 1:1 mixture of water and ethanol. Fill with appropriate amounts (see steps 1.2 and 1.3) and allow to run for 30-40 min.\n4. Required Analyses for Setting up 'Dry' and 'Elemental Carbon' Balances\nPerform the following feedstock analyses (examples for applicable standards are given in parentheses):\n\t\nDetermine the water content17.\nDetermine the ash content18.\nDetermine the elemental carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents19.",
    "NOTE: It is highly recommended to analyze the water content each experimental day because differences in weather conditions might affect the moisture content of the feedstock. Depending on the size of the lot, several samples are required to reliably characterize the feedstock. Additional analyses such as fiber analysis and higher heating value are recommended but not mandatory for setting up the above-mentioned balances.\nPerform the following char powder analyses (examples of applicable standards are given in the references):\n\t\nDetermine the water content17.\nDetermine the ash content18.\nDetermine the elemental carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents19.\n\t\tNOTE: It is assumed that char has no moisture content when leaving the process for setting up the balances. Moisture take-up may occur during the course of analyses, and the water content is required for the correction of the other two analyses.\nPerform the following bio-oil analyses (examples of applicable standards or other recommended methods are given in parentheses):\n\t\nDetermine the water content by volumetric Karl-Fischer titration according to standard protocols. Dissolve a sample in dry methanol and titrate it with a mixture of a base, SO2, and a known concentration of I2 (detailed examples of materials are given in the material list). Each mole of water reacts with one mole of I2.\nDetermine the solids content by taking a 3,040 g sample of FPBO and dissolve it in methanol to a final solution volume of about 100 ml. Stir the solution for 10 min at room temperature. Filter the solution through cellulose filter at particle retention of 2.5 µm and rinse the residue thoroughly with methanol until a clear filtrate is obtained. Dry the solid residue at 105 °C overnight and determine the residual weight.\nDetermine the elemental carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents19.",
    "Determine the ethylene glycol content by 1H NMR analysis according to standard protocols. Dissolve an FPBO sample in a solution of deuterated methanol with 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TMSP) as reference material (approximately 0.1 g FPBO in 0.8 g solution). For example, the solution may contain 44 g methanol and 0.1 g TMSP. Centrifuge the dissolved sample in order to remove solids. Analyze the sample by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The hydroxy groups of ethylene glycol show a peak at 3.55–3.65 ppm. The reference peak of TMSP appears around 0 ppm and is used to quantify the ethylene glycol content.\n\t\tNOTE: Start-up with pure ethylene glycol leads to a dilution of the condensate in the first condenser. This needs to be considered in the calculation of mass and energy balances and for the presentation of the results. It is highly desirable to identify individual chemical compounds. Such an analytical method is very complex due to the vast number of different compounds and the nature of the condensate matrix. A description of such analyses is outside the scope of this paper. It should also be pointed out that the above-mentioned analyses are merely required for setting up balances and are not sufficient for describing the bio-oil as a product. Standards that cover FPBO applications are in preparation.\nPerform the following aqueous condensate analyses (examples of applicable standards are given in parentheses):\n\t\nDetermine the water content by volumetric Karl-Fischer titration (see 4.3.1).\nDetermine the total organic carbon as non-purgeable organic carbon20.\n\t\tNOTE: Start-up with pure water leads to a dilution of the condensate in the second condenser. This needs to be considered in the calculation of mass and energy balances and for the presentation of the results.",
    "Monitor the gas composition throughout the experiment because composition varies considerably with time. For example, analyze the product gas during the experiments presented here in a process gas chromatograph every 30-60 min. Analyze the following gas species: Ne, H2, CO, CO2, N2, O2, CH4, and alkane/alkene C2-C5 components.\n\t\nInject a constant gas flow of Ne into the reactor as a reference. Calculate the mass of each gas species based on the reference volumetric flow, the average gas composition ratio, the duration of the experiment, and the density of the species. In order to determine the water content of the pyrolysis gas, assume saturated conditions at the outlet temperature of the last condenser."
