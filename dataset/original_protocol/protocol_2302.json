    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNeural induction of hiPSCs\nTiming: ∼2 weeks\nThis step describes the neural induction of hiPSCs to allow for the robust generation of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). Neural induction is achieved through the inhibition of BMP and TGF-β signaling and the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) (Chambers et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Kim et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). After isolation of EB-derived neuroepithelial-like rosettes, hNPCs can be replated and maintained as proliferative, multipotent cells. Prior to neural induction working concentration of relevant reagents should be made as described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and the necessary media should be made.\nNote: HiPSCs should be grown for a minimum of two passages post-thaw prior to initiating differentiation. HiPSCs should be healthy, displaying their characteristic morphology.\nDifferentiation should be initiated when hiPSCs are 70–80% confluent (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, left panels).\nOn day 0, aspirate the medium from the well.\nGently wash each well with 1 mL PBS. Then, add 1 mL of Accutase per well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate the plate with Accutase at 37°C for 5 min.\nWash the surface with 1 mL of DMEM to further dissociate the cells from the plate (blast cells with P1000 where necessary).\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube. Take 10 μL of the cell suspension and count cells using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in E8 supplemented with 5 μM ROCKi so that the final cell concentration is 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nAdd 4 mL of cell suspension per well of 6-well cell-repellent plate. A total of 4 × 106 cells will be added to each well.",
    "Note: For neural induction in suspension culture, the cells should be cultured in a 6-well cell repellent plate. To allow for appropriate cell aggregation, we do not recommend other cell culture formats be used.\nPlace the plate on an orbital shaker set at 95 rpm inside a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Aggregates in the form of embryoid bodies (EBs) should be observed 24 h post-plating (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, right panels). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOn day 1, carefully aspirate 3 mL of the medium from each well using a P1000 and replace with 3 mL of fresh E8 medium.\nOn day 2, carefully aspirate 2 mL of the medium from each well using a P1000 and replace with 2 mL of fresh E8 medium.\nOn day 3, carefully aspirate 3 mL of the E8 medium from each well and replace with 3 mL of NIM.\nCritical: Formation of EBs in E8 medium prior to neural induction allows for more consistent aggregate size and neural induction.\nOn days 4–8, carefully aspirate 2 mL of the medium from each well and replace with 2 mL of NIM.\nOn day 9, use a 5 mL serological pipette to gently transfer aggregates to a 15 mL conical and let the aggregates settle. Transfer aggregates to a Cultrex® Basement Membrane Extract (BME) coated 6-well plate, splitting aggregates at a 1:2 ratio.\nAdd NIM supplemented with 5uM of ROCKi so that the total volume in each well is 3 mL. Gently move the plate in several quick, short, back-and-forth, and side-to-side motions to disperse the EBs evenly across the cell culture surface.",
    "On day 10, EBs should have settled and adhered to the Cultrex® BME-coated plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, left panels). Change the medium with NIM on days 10–15. By day 12, the EBs should spread out on the Cultrex® BME-coated plates and neural rosette-like structures should be visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, right panels). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCoating of plates with poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and laminin (Ln)\nTiming: ∼8 h\nThis step describes the coating of plates with poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and laminin (Ln) that will be used for hNPC culture. Prior to this step, the stock solutions of PLO and Ln should be made as described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nTo prepare PLO working solution, add 48 mL of PBS and 2 mL of PLO stock solution to a 50 mL conical.\nAdd 2 mL of the PLO working solution to each well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate at 37°C for 4 h.\nAspirate the PLO and wash each well twice with 2 mL PBS.\nThaw aliquots of Ln stock solution on ice.\nTo prepare Ln working solution, add 49.6 mL of PBS and 400 μL of Ln stock solution to a 50 mL conical.\nAdd 2 mL of the Ln working solution to each well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate at 37°C for 4 h.\nImmediately prior to use, wash each well twice with 2 mL PBS.\nNote: PLO/Ln coated plates can be stored at -20°C for 2 weeks with the Ln working solution remaining on the plate.\nNeural Rosette selection\nTiming: 2 days",
    "This step describes the selective isolation of neural rosette clusters from adherent EBs. The isolated rosettes can be expanded as hNPCs in the presence of FGF and EGF (Koch et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Before starting this step, the Neural Induction Medium (NIM) should be prepared. Rosette selection is adapted from the manufacturer’s protocol for STEMdiff™ Neural Rosette Selection Reagent.\nOn day 16 of neural induction, aspirate NIM from the well and wash with 1 mL of DMEM/F-12.\nAspirate DMEM/F-12 and add 1 mL of STEMdiff™ Neural Rosette Selection Reagent.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1.5 h.\nCarefully aspirate the STEMdiff™ Neural Rosette Selection Reagent using a 1 mL pipette.\nUsing a P1000, firmly wash the surface with 1 mL of DMEM/F-12 to dissociate the rosettes from the plate.\nNote: The DMEM/F-12 should be aimed directly at the rosettes in order to dissociate the neural rosettes from the culture surface.\nAdd the neural rosette suspension to a 15 mL conical tube using a 5mL serological pipette.\nRepeat steps 32 and 33 until most of the rosettes have been isolated from the well. Do not over-select for rosettes. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCentrifuge rosette suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.\nGently resuspend by pipetting cells in 3 mL NIM supplemented with 5 μM ROCKi 1–2 times.\nSplit cells at a 1:1 ratio. Add 3 mL of cell suspension to 1 well of a PLO/Ln coated 6-well plate. From herein, the cells are called hNPCs and this is considered passage 0.\nPlace the plate in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Gently move the plate in several quick, short, back-and-forth, and side-to-side motions to spread cells evenly across the wells.\nThe next day, change the medium with 3mL NIM.",
    "Change the medium with fresh NIM every day until cells reach 70–80% confluence. Flat adherent cells should appear with a morphology as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C. Culture cells in NEM from passage 1.\nHNPC expansion\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nThis step describes the expansion and routine passaging of hNPCs. HNPCs should be passaged when the cells reach 70–80% confluence. Healthy cell growth should require passaging every 3–4 days. This protocol describes expansion of hNPCs in 6-well plates. The protocol should be adjusted appropriately for expansion in other tissue culture plate formats.\nWhen the cells reach 70–80% confluence (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), aspirate the medium and add 1 mL of Accutase.\nIncubate the plate with Accutase at 37°C for 5 min.\nWash the well with 1 mL of NEM to remove adherent cells (blast cells with P1000 where necessary).\nTransfer cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube. Take 10 μL of the cell suspension and count cells using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing cell pellet.\nResuspend cell pellet in NEM so that the final cell concentration is 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nPlate the cells at a density of 2.5 × 104/cm2 onto fresh PLO/Ln coated plates that have been washed twice with PBS prior to use.\nAdd the appropriate volume of NEM to each well so that the final volume per well is 3mL.\nPlace the plate in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Gently move the plate in several quick, short, back-and-forth, and side-to-side motions to spread cells evenly across the wells.\nEach passage increases the passage number by 1.",
    "Cells should continue to display similar flat morphology as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C. Cells should be characterized at passage 6 with >90% of the cells should expressing SOX1, SOX2, and NESTIN (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCryopreservation of hNPCs\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes the cryopreservation of hNPCs. HNPCs should be passaged between passage 5 and 10 for use in large-scale differentiations. We recommend cryopreserving hNPCs on passage 5 after characterization. Before starting this step, prepare the Freezing Medium.\nWhen the cells reach 70–80% confluence, aspirate the medium and wash once with PBS. Then, add 1 mL of Accutase.\nWash the well with 1 mL of NEM to remove adherent cells (blast cells with P1000 where necessary).\nTransfer cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube. Take 10 μL of the cell suspension and count cells using the hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in Freezing Medium so that the final cell concentration is 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nTransfer 1 mL of cell suspension to a cryovial and transfer to a Mr. Frosty™ freezing container.\nPlace the Mr. Frosty™ in a −80°C freezer for 24 h before transferring the cryovial to a −150°C freezer.\nPause point: HNPCs can be stored at −150°C for 1 year.\nThawing of hNPCs\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis step describes the thawing of cryopreserved hNPCs. We recommend that hNPCs be expanded a minimum of 2 passages after thawing before proceeding with large-scale differentiation.\nQuickly thaw a vial of hNPCs (1 × 106 cells/vial) in a bead bath and add cell suspension to 4 mL DMEM in a 15 mL conical.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 × g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.",
    "Resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL NEM.\nPlate at an appropriate density (25–50% higher than density at which cells are routinely cultured; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) and expand hNPCs on PLO/Ln coated plates as described in steps 41–51.\nCoating of microcarriers (MCs) with vitronectin-derived peptide (VDP)\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this protocol, a fully defined peptide substrate—termed vitronectin-derived peptide (VDP)—will be employed as a growth substrate for the large-scale differentiation of hNPCs in a microcarrier (MC)-based suspension culture system (Srinivasan et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]; Varun et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]). This step describes the coating of MCs with VDP. Although this protocol can be adapted to be used with PLO/Ln coated MCs, VDP provides a more reproducible and cost-effective substrate for the large-scale expansion and differentiation of hNPCs.\nSterilize weighing scale with 70% ethanol and transfer to tissue culture hood. Weigh 200 mg of sterile MCs and transfer to a 15 mL conical using a disposable spatula and weigh paper.\nAdd 5 mL PBS to 15 mL conical.\nUsing a P1000, mix the MCs in PBS by pipetting up and down.\nTransfer 500 μL (approximately 20 mg) of MC suspension to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge the Eppendorf tube at 200 × g for 3 min.\nUsing a P1000, aspirate 50 μL PBS from the Eppendorf tube and replace with 50 μL VDP stock solution.\nUsing a P1000, mix the MCs well in VDP solution by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate MCs with VDP for 48 h at 37°C.\nImmediately before use, centrifuge the Eppendorf tube at 200 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the MC pellet.\nGently add 1 mL PBS to resuspend the MCs. Do not pipette the MCs up and down vigorously.\nCentrifuge the Eppendorf tube at 200 × g for 3 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the MC pellet. Gently add 1 mL NEM.\nCentrifuge the Eppendorf tube at 200 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant without disturbing the MC pellet. Gently add 1 mL NEM. This is later added to the cell suspension prepared as described below.\nLarge-scale neural differentiation of hNPCs on VDP-coated MCs\nTiming: ∼30 days\nThis section describes the expansion of hNPCs on VDP-coated MCs as well as their subsequent differentiation to neurons and astrocytes through the removal of FGF and EGF and addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Prior to starting this step, prepare the Neural Differentiation Medium (NDM).\nDissociate a healthy, confluent hNPC culture as described in steps 41–47. Resuspend the hNPCs at a concentration of 2 × 106 cell/mL in NEM.\nIn a 15 mL conical, mix 2 × 106 cells in suspension, 130 μL washed VDP-coated MCs, 870 μL warmed NEM, and 2 μL ROCKi. The total volume of 1 well of a 6-well plate should be 2 mL.\nTransfer contents of 15 mL conical to a single well of a 6-well cell-repellent plate. If seeding cells in more than one well of a 6-well plate, make sure to mix MCs and cells well and seed one well at a time using a 5mL serological pipette.\nPlace the plate in static conditions in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 12 h.\nAdd 2 mL of NEM and 2 μL ROCKi to the well.\nPlace the plate on an orbital shaker set at 95 rpm in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nAfter 24 h, use a P1000 to remove 3 mL of media and replace with 3 mL of fresh NEM.",
    "Every day, use a P1000 to remove 2 mL of media and replace with 2mL of fresh NEM.\nCritical: While changing the media, swirl the aggregates to the middle of each well to ensure no cell aggregates are accidently removed.\nContinue changing the media until the cells are confluent, approximately 4–5 days after seeding the MCs. There should be a thin layer of cells surrounding the MC aggregates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, left panel). The hNPCs should continue to express high levels of SOX1, SOX2, and NESTIN when grown on the MCs.

Red arrows are pointing to patches of cells detaching from the MCs.\nOnce confluent, use a P1000 to remove 3 mL of NEM and replace with 3 mL of NDM.\nFor the next 30–35 days, each day use a P1000 to remove 2 mL of media and replace with 2 mL of NDM. The MC aggregates will continue to grow in size throughout the differentiation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, right panel). Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDissociation of cells from the MCs\nTiming: ∼5 h\nThis step describes the enzymatic dissociation of differentiated neural cells from the MC-based cultures into single-cell suspension. This protocol is a modification of a previously published protocol for the single-cell dissociation of organoid-based cultures (Sloan et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]). Prior to starting this step prepare the Enzyme and Inhibitor (E/I) Stock Solution, the Low Concentration Ovomucoid Solution and the High Concentration Ovomucoid Solution.",
    "Critical: This protocol is written for dissociation of 2 wells of 6-well plate of MC cultures. Dissociation of additional wells should be performed in parallel and not combined into a single 50 mL conical tube.\nLabel a 50 mL conical tube ‘Low concentration ovomucoid inhibitor solution’. Add 27.8 mL E/I stock solution to the conical. Label another 50 mL conical tube ‘High concentration ovomucoid inhibitor solution’. Add 5 mL solution to the conical.\nPlace both conicals upright in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator with screw caps loosened to allow for equilibration. Alternatively, adjust the pH of E/I stock solution prior to use with 1N HCl and skip the equilibration step.\nPrepare a 30U/mL papain enzyme solution by adding the appropriate volume of papain, 75 μL L-Cysteine stock solution, and 14.4 mL of E/I stock solution to a 50 mL conical.\nNote: The volume of papain enzyme solution may vary according to enzyme stock concentration. The final concentration must be at 30 U/mL. The solution will be cloudy when the papain stock is added.\nCritical: Do not add the DNase I at this step. It will be added at a later step.\nIncubate the papain enzyme solution at 37°C for 20 min until the solution becomes clear.\nFilter the papain enzyme solution with a 0.2 μm filter into a new 50 mL conical.\nAfter filter sterilization, add 94 μL DNase I stock solution to the papain enzyme solution.\nUsing a 25 mL serological pipette, transfer 2 wells of MCs to a 15 mL conical tube. Wash the well with 3 mL NBM to transfer any remaining aggregates left in the well.\nCentrifuge the conical at 200 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 2 mL of Accutase per well.\nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C.",
    "Use a P1000 to gently break up the aggregates by pipetting up down several times.\nAdd 2 mL of NBM to the 15 mL conical.\nCentrifuge the conical at 200 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 4 mL papain enzyme solution that was prepared in step 96.\nUsing a 5 mL serological pipette, transfer the aggregates in papain enzyme solution to 2 wells of a 6-well cell-repellent plate at 2 mL per well.\nPlace the plate on an orbital shaker set at 95 rpm in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Incubate for 70 min.\nDuring the incubation period, finish preparing the low and high concentration ovomucoid inhibitor solutions.\nFor the low concentration ovomucoid inhibitor solution, thaw the low concentration ovomucoid solution on ice. To the 50 mL conical prepared in step 92, add 2 mL of low concentration ovomucoid solution and 188 μL DNase I.\nFor the high concentration ovomucoid inhibitor solution, thaw the high concentration ovomucoid solution on ice. To the 50 mL conical prepared in step 92, add 1 mL of high concentration ovomucoid solution and 38 μL DNase I.\nAfter incubation in papain enzyme, transfer cells from the 6-well cell-repellent plate to a 15 mL conical.\nCentrifuge the conical at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant and add 4 mL low concentration ovomucoid inhibitor solution prepared in step 108a.\nUse a 5 mL serological pipette to gently pipette the aggregates up and down 15 times.\nCritical: Do not introduce bubbles while pipetting as this may lead to cell damage and death.\nAllow undissociated aggregates to settle down and transfer cloudy cell suspension to a new 15 mL conical.\nRepeat steps 111–113 with a P1000 until aggregates are broken up into single cell suspension. Triturate slightly more vigorously each round.",
    "Put a 40 μm cell strainer over a new 15 mL conical and, using a P1000, slowly pass all the single cell-MC suspension obtained in step 114 through the filter.\nNote: Change the cell strainer if it gets clogged with MCs. For higher yields, wash the cell strainer 1 to 2 times with low concentration ovomucoid inhibitor solution to ensure all single cells have passed through.\nCentrifuge the single cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 6 mL low ovomucoid inhibitor solution.\nIn a new 15 mL conical tube, add 6 mL of high ovomucoid inhibitor solution prepared in step 108b.\nAdd the resuspended single cell suspension obtained in step 117 to the 15 mL conical with the high ovomucoid inhibitor solution prepared in step 118 dropwise.\nNote: This step will allow for the removal of cell debris from the single cell suspension. When added slowly, the low ovomucoid cell suspension will stay on top of the high ovomucoid solution.\nCentrifuge the conical at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 10 mL of warm NDM supplemented with 5uM ROCKi with a P1000.\nNote: Resuspend with 1 mL NDM first to ensure the pellet is thoroughly broken up prior to adding the remaining 9 mL NDM.\nIncubate the cell suspension for 1 h in a 15 mL conical tube in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator to allow the cells to recover from the dissociation.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nTake 1 × 106 cells and proceed with the cell viability assay as described in step 190 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The remainder of the cells can be purified using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) as described in step 125.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1910-Fig3.jpg",

The magnet can sort a maximum of 3 mL of solution (∼2.5 × 108 cells) at once. As such, if more than 2.5 × 108 cells are being purified then MACS sorting of parallel cell preparations staggered by 5 min should be performed.\nPlace the tube in the MojoSort™ magnet so that the solution is completely covered by the magnet. Loosely place a cap on top of the tube. It should not be sealed.\nLeave the magnet in place for 5 min.\nWith the magnet still in place, decant the CD44- fraction into a new polypropylene tube labeled ‘CD44- cells’ in one motion.\nRepeat steps 137–139 for higher purity of CD44- cells.\nNote: The CD44+ cells from step 138 will be used in step 141. Do not combine the CD44+ cells left after a second round of MACS separation with the cells from step 138.\nAfter the second round of MACS separation, add cells to a 15 mL conical labeled ‘CD44-cells’ and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.

    "Count the cells using a hemocytometer. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nProceed to step 143 for replating and culturing of the astrocytes.\nAstrocyte culture\nTiming: ∼2 weeks\nIn this section, we described the plating and expansion of MACS purified astrocytes. After culture, these astrocytes can be characterized for their expression of high levels of mature astrocytic markers (step 209) as well as properties characteristic of functionally mature astrocytes including production of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE; step 228) and appearance of robust calcium transients (step 235). This protocol describes the culture of astrocytes in 6-well plates. The protocol should be adjusted appropriately for expansion in other tissue culture plate formats.\nTransfer 2.5 × 105 cells from the cell suspension obtained in step 142 to each well of a Cultrex® BME-coated 6-well plate.\nNote: Because the Streptavidin Nanobeads might still be attached to the astrocytes, the cell counts obtained via the hemocytometer might be inaccurate. To that end, the user can elect to split the astrocyte cell suspension obtained in step 143 into empirically determined ratios onto Cultrex® BME-coated plates. We have found that evenly splitting the astrocyte cell suspension obtained in step 143 into 4 wells of a Cultrex® BME-coated plate will allow for robust attachment and growth.\nAdd appropriate amount of warmed Astrocyte Medium supplemented with 5 μM ROCKi so that the total volume per well is 3 mL.\nPlace the plate in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. Gently move the plate in several quick, short, back-and-forth, and side-to-side motions to spread cells evenly across the wells.\nAfter 24 h replace the medium with 3 mL of fresh Astrocyte Medium. Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nChange the medium each day (∼5 days) until the wells are 90% confluent.\nWhen the cultures are 90% confluent aspirate the medium and add 1 mL of Accutase to each well.",

Around passage 4, the nanobeads should be mostly removed.
