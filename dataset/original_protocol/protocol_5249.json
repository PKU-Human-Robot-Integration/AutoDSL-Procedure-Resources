    "Collection of biological samples Note: This step differs for embryos and imaginal discs.EMBRYOS:Melt egg laying medium using a microwave (see Recipes).Fill the Petri dishes with 15 ml of egg laying medium.While egg laying medium is cooling down, fill a beaker with 100 ml of sink water and put it on a magnetic stirrer.Add progressively 50 g of yeast to the beaker. Achieve the mixing by hand stirring as the yeast mixture becomes very viscous.Once the egg laying medium gets solid, spread 5-10 ml of yeast mixture on each dish (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531012532_3054.jpgFigure 1. Egg laying medium covered with yeast mixtureAssemble the Petri dishes onto the cages (see Figure 2) and let flies lay eggs as long as required to get a sufficient amount of embryos (see Figure 3). Note: See Note 3 to know the number of embryos required. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531012638_1095.jpgFigure 2.

Petri dish layered with Drosophila embryos (O/N egg laying)Collect the embryos in a sieve by spraying 1x embryo buffer with a wash bottle (see Figure 4). Use a paintbrush to help.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531014515_1644.jpgFigure 4. Embryos in a sieve (O/N collection)Wash the embryos three times by putting the sieve in a bath of embryo buffer (use the cap of a tip box).Collect the embryos with a cut 200 µl tip and transfer them in an Eppendorf tube. Remove as much buffer as possible and store them at -80 °C.IMAGINAL DISCS:Dissect imaginal discs in Schneider’s medium (SM) (Spratford and Kumar, 2014), and put them in a 1.5 ml LoBind Eppendorf tube, kept on ice and containing 1 ml of SM. Note: See Note 4 to know the number of discs required.Dissection time should not exceed 1 h.Centrifuge for 2 min (4 °C, 4,000 x g) and remove the supernatant.",
    "Imaginal discs can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for months, allowing multiple rounds of dissection in order to collect enough material.Cross-linking proteins to DNANote: At this step, embryos and imaginal discs samples are processed the same way. If samples have been frozen, thaw them on ice for a couple of minutes. Resuspend the tissues and pool them in a final volume of 888 µl of ice-cold A1 buffer.Transfer them into a 2 ml tight Tenbroeck at room temperature (RT).Fixation: quickly add 112 µl of 16% formaldehyde (FA) in the Tenbroeck (final concentration of 1.8% FA). Fixation is performed at RT. Note: See Note 5 for the concentration of FA to be used.Disrupt the tissues for 5 min by slowly moving the pestle of the Tenbroeck up and down in the mortar. Transfer the disrupted tissues back to a 1.5 ml LoBind Eppendorf tube. Put on a rotating wheel at RT: total time for fixation is 15 min.Stop crosslinking: add 160 µl of 2.5 M glycine (350 mM final) and put on a rotating wheel for 5 min, then put on ice.Note: All the following steps are done on ice or at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Centrifuge for 2 min (4 °C, at 2,000 x g) and discard the supernatant.Wash with 1 ml of buffer A1 (disrupt the pellet by pipetting). Centrifuge for 2 min (4 °C, 2,000 x g).Repeat steps B9 and B10 twice. Wash once with lysis buffer 1, centrifuge for 2 min (4 °C, 2,000 x g) and remove the supernatant.Chromatin isolation and fragmentation by sonication Note: This step differs for embryos and imaginal discs samples.EMBRYOS:Prepare 2 ml of 0.1% SDS lysis buffer 2 (10 µl of 20% SDS + 1,990 µl of lysis buffer 2).",
    "Resuspend the pellet with (Number of embryos/1,000) x 250 µl of freshly prepared 0.1% SDS lysis buffer 2.Incubate for 2 h on ice, and put the ice bucket with the samples in a shaker (600 rpm) to avoid SDS precipitation. Note: See Note 6 for an alternative method.Sonication: split lysate in several 15 ml polystyrene Falcon tubes in order to get 1.5 ml of lysate per tube. Note: See Note 7 for considerations about sonication efficiency.Set the Bioruptor sonicator as follows: Number of cycles = 12, power = HIGH, ON = 30 sec, OFF = 30 sec. After sonication, pool all the tubes back together. At this step, samples can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and conserved at -80 °C for months.IMAGINAL DISCS:Prepare 1 ml of 1% SDS lysis buffer 2 (50 µl of 20% SDS + 950 µl of lysis buffer 2).Resuspend the pellet with (Number of imaginal discs/600) x 150 µl of freshly prepared 1% SDS lysis buffer 2.Incubate for 2 h on ice, and put the ice bucket with the samples in a shaker (600 rpm) to avoid SDS precipitation. Note: See Note 6 for an alternative method.Sonication: split lysate in several 1.5 ml LoBind tubes in order to get 150 µl of lysate per tube. Note: See Note 7 for considerations about sonication efficiency.Set the Bioruptor sonicator as follows: Number of cycles = 18, power = HIGH, ON = 30 sec, OFF = 30 sec.After sonication, pool all the tubes back together. At this step, samples can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and conserved at -80 °C for months.Sonication test Note: At this step, embryos and imaginal discs samples are processed the same way. If your sonication conditions are well established, you can skip this step.",
    "For the sonication test, transfer 5-10 µl of the lysate (200 ng of DNA is sufficient) in a fresh 1.5 ml Lobind tube. During the sonication test, keep the remaining lysate at 4 °C. Bring the volume up to 100 µl with lysis buffer 1.Add 2 µl of 10 mg/ml RNase A and incubate for 6 h (to O/N) at 65 °C with 450 rpm agitation.Add 100 µl of phenol-chloroform and vortex for 30 sec.Centrifuge for 10 min (RT, maximum speed).Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh 1.5 ml Lobind tube and add 10 µl of 3 M NaAc (pH 5.5), 2 µl of 35 mg/ml glycogen and 250 µl of 100% EtOH. Vortex and incubate for 30 min at -20 °C. Centrifuge for 20 min (4 °C, maximum speed).During centrifugation, prepare a 1.5% agarose gel by dissolving 0.75 g of agarose powder with 50 ml of 1x TAE buffer. Melt the agarose solution in a microwave, and let it cool down for 5 min before adding 3 µl of ethidium bromide.Cast the gel in an agarose gel caster and let it cool down at RT.Once the 20 min centrifugation is over, remove the supernatant and air dry the pellet for 10 min at RT.Resuspend the pellet in 8 µl of nuclease free H2O and add 2 µl of low blue loading buffer (see Recipes for details).Deposit 5 µl of 100 bp DNA ladder and the 10 µl of the sonication test on the gel.Run the gel for 20-25 min at 135 V and observe it using a UV lamp. An example of efficient sonication is depicted in Figure 5. Note: See Note 8 for considerations about the importance of sonication quality.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531014443_9327.jpg Figure 5.

    "The size of bulk DNA fragments ranges from 100 to 300 bp.Immunoprecipitation Note: This step differs for embryos and imaginal discs samples.EMBRYOS:If the sonication pattern is adequate, centrifuge the sonicated lysate for 5 min (4 °C, 14,000 x g). If sonication is insufficient, sonicate the chromatin for 2 cycles more with the same settings and repeat the sonication test. Transfer the supernatant into a fresh tube (if possible LoBind).Quantify the DNA using the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit, following manufacturer’s instructions (1 µl of sonicated lysate should be enough). Note: See Note 9 for recommendations about the amount of DNA to be used for IPs.Split chromatin samples into N aliquots, each containing 250 µl. N = number of IPs + 2 (One Mock and one INPUT).Wash (number of samples + 2) x 15 µl of Protein A or G Dynabeads. Note: See Note 10 to know how to wash the beads and see Note 2 to know the type of Dynabeads to be used (A or G).Preclearing: Add 15 µl of washed Protein A or G Dynabeads to the chromatin samples and preclear chromatin for 2 h (to O/N) at 4 °C on a rotating wheel.Put the tubes in the magnetic rack and transfer the precleared chromatin (supernatant) in fresh 1.5 ml LoBind tubes.Store the tube(s) containing the Input at 4 °C until step F13 (DNA recovery).Immunoprecipitation: Add the antibodies in the IP tubes and the Mock; incubate for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. For the Mock, use the same amount of normal IgG from the same species that has been used for the IPs. Note: See Material and Reagents for the catalog number of the rabbit normal IgG we use.",
    "See Notes for details about the quantity of antibody to use (Note 11) and which controls can be performed (Notes 12, 13 and 14).During incubation: wash (number of IPs + 1 Mock) x 30 µl of Protein A or G Dynabeads. Note: See Note 10 to know how to wash the beads and see Note 2 to know the type of Dynabeads to be used (A or G).Add 30 µl of Protein A Dynabeads per sample and incubate O/N at 4 °C on a rotating wheel.IMAGINAL DISCS:If the sonication pattern is adequate, centrifuge the sonicated lysate for 5 min (4 °C, 14,000 x g).

Note: See Note 9 for recommendations about the amount of DNA to be used for IPs.Split chromatin samples into N aliquots, each containing 100 µl. N = number of IPs + 2 (One Mock and one INPUT). Dilute 10 times by adding 900 µl of lysis buffer 2 (without SDS) in order to reach a 0.1% SDS final concentration. Final volume is 1 ml.Wash (number of samples + 2) x 15 µl of Protein A or G Dynabeads. Note: See Note 10 to know how to wash the beads and see Note 2 to know the type of Dynabeads to be used (A or G).Preclearing: Add 15 µl of washed Protein A or G Dynabeads to the chromatin samples and preclear chromatin for 2 h (to O/N) at 4 °C on a rotating wheel.",

The next day, put the tubes on the magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.Put 1 ml of lysis buffer wash (kept on ice) in the tubes containing the IPs and the Mock, remove them from the magnetic rack and put them back on ice.Homogenize by pipetting and incubate for 5 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel.Put the tubes on a magnetic rack and remove the supernatant.Repeat steps F2-F4 three times with lysis buffer wash (4 washes in total) and two times with TE buffer (kept on ice).After the last wash, be careful to remove all the remaining TE buffer.",
    "First elution: Add 100 µl of elution buffer 1 and homogenize by pipetting.Incubate the IPs and the Mock at 65 °C for 15 min under vigorous shaking (1,300 rpm).Put the samples on the magnetic rack and transfer the supernatants in fresh 1.5 ml LoBind tubes.Second elution: Add 150 µl of elution buffer 2 to the beads and homogenize by pipetting.Incubate at 65 °C for 15 min under vigorous shaking (1,300 rpm).Put the tubes on a magnetic rack and pool the two eluates (final volume 250 µl).Decrosslinking: incubate all the samples for 6 h (to O/N) at 65 °C, 300 rpm. Don’t forget to also take the Input(s) that was/were kept at 4 °C.The day after, add 3 µl of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K per tube and incubate for 2 h at 56 °C.Add 1 volume of phenol-chloroform and vortex for 30 sec.Centrifuge for 15 min (RT, maximum speed).Transfer aqueous phase to fresh 1.5 ml LoBind tubes and add 1/10 volume of 3 M NaAc, pH 5.5 (25 µl), 2 µl of 35 mg/ml glycogen and 2.5 volumes of 100% EtOH (625 µl).Precipitation: vortex the samples and incubate them O/N at -20 °C.Identification of factor associated DNA sequences by PCR or sequencing Note: At this step, embryos and imaginal discs samples are processed in the same way.
