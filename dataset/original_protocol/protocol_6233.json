    "C. merolae standard growth conditionsStandard growth medium is MA2 Allen medium (Recipe 2). We suggest preparation of 10x concentrated stock solution of MA2 with A2 trace elements, without A2 Fe-EDTA and autoclave it. For every new preparation of culture medium, dilute an appropriate volume. After autoclaving add A2 Fe-EDTA (Recipe 4).The cultures should be grown in a transparent sterile vessel, of at least five times larger volume than the cell culture (e.g., 50 ml cultures in 250 ml flasks).Cultures must be gently agitated (30-50 rpm on an orbital shaker).Cultures must be sterile so any culture vessel must be closed off but it must allow for gas exchange. Atmospheric CO2 is sufficient for growth, but up to 5% CO2 in air can be applied.The light intensity should be in the range between 50 and 100 µmoles photons m-2 s-1 of continuous illumination. Growth rates are similar in the temperature range of 37-42 °C.OD of C. merolae should be kept between 0.01 and 1 at most. We advise to refresh every culture weekly or biweekly by inoculation of fresh culture out of 1/100 of the volume of the old culture. PEG transformation of C. merolae cellsSet up at least (work in duplicates) 2x 50 ml culture of OD750 = 0.1 a week prior to transformation and allow it to grow in the standard conditions up to OD750 = 0.4.Two days before transformation, introduce a photoperiod of 8/16 ho light/dark.One hour before transformation expose to standard light conditions (if the dark period isn’t completed).Spin down 100 ml of culture at 40 °C and 2,000 x g for 5 min.Resuspend the pellet in 50 ml of MA-1 solution at 40 °C and spin down again at 40 °C and 2,000 x g for 5 min.Resuspend the pellet in 0.",
    "5 ml of MA-1 solution at 40 °C (now ready for transformation).Produce large quantity (above 50 μg and high concentration (above 200 ng/μL, measure precisely on NanoDrop) of transformation vector.Dilute the transformation vector to 20 μg in total 400 μl MA-1 buffer.Add 100 μl of the cell suspension to 400 μl of DNA and gently mix it by pipetting it up and down 2-3 times.Add 500 μl of 60% sterile PEG and gently mix it with the tip (the final concentration of PEG should be 30%).Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Transfer the cell suspension to 50 ml MA2 and spin down at 40 °C and 2,000 x g for 5 min, repeat one more time.Resuspend in 50 ml of MA2 medium and apply standard growth conditions.Allow growing under continuous light for 3 days, after that introduce selectable conditions–chloramphenicol at 150 μg/ml form freshly prepared stock solution of 100 mg/ml.Culture should fade (slowly turn yellow/white) and then regain growth (by appearance of green color).After 2-3 weeks, transfer 500 μl of the culture into 50 ml of MA2 medium in 250 ml flask.Plate 50 μl of culture on 1% (w/v) agar-solidified MA2 Petri dishes, seal 3 times with parafilm to avoid excessive evaporation and drying out of the medium matrix.Allow growing in standard conditions until colonies appear.Pick 20-50 colonies and transfer into a 250 ml flask with 50 ml of MA2 containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol.After it grows up to OD750 = 0.4, then inoculate into MA2 media with150, 200 and 250 μg/ml of chloramphenicol, respectively.Allow it to grow for ~2 weeks up to OD750 ~0.5.Inoculate new cultures from the successful, highest-concentration-of-chloramphenicol-grown surviving culture. Repeat as long as necessary to achieve and confirm homogeneity by appropriate genetic means (e.g.",
    ", by qPCR specific to WT and modified genomes, Southern Blott The time needed for the entire procedure may vary and typically takes about 6 months)."
