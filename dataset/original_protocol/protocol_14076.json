    "The experiments described herein were approved by the Ethical Research Committee of the University of Murcia, Spain, and were performed in accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Commission. The steps described were performed under standard operating protocols that were part of the plan of work and have not been performed solely for the purpose of filming the accompanying video to this paper.\n1. Preparation of the rabbit\nBefore proceeding, start by injecting a combination of ketamine (10 mg/kg) homogenized in the same syringe with medetomidine (200 µg/kg) to anaesthetize the animal, which will reduce the stress of the procedure for the rabbit.\n\tNOTE: The use of anesthesia also reduces the heart rate in a predictable manner, thus reducing inter-individual variability, and has the added benefit of improving overall imaging quality. As shown in the video, cover the head with a surgical blanket to help keep the animal calm during the injection of anesthesia.\n\t\nVerify that the animal is completely anesthetized within 10-20 min, by confirming the presence of muscle flaccidity, absence of palpebral reflex, mandibular movements and sniffing. The presence of the latter two signs (mandibular movements and sniffing), are in turn the earliest signs of reduced anesthetic depth. Even though it is rarely needed, re-dosing should be considered (e.g. half the initial anesthetic dose combination), if a long delay is anticipated in order to complete the procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: Whilst the animal will quickly fall asleep within the first ~5 minutes following the injection, it is recommended to allow a deeper plane of anesthesia before attempting to manipulate the animal. This delay will avoid distressing the rabbit, which will otherwise likely produce tachycardia and adversely affect the imaging accuracy and reproducibility of certain parameters during the echocardiographic examination (e.g. mitral valve inflow analyses).",
    "Once the animal is anaesthetized, use a hair clipper to remove the hair from the skin of the thorax. Start below the neck line and continue to the level of both right and left hypochondriac regions, as well as the sub-xiphoid region in the middle line (Figure 1B).\nShave 1-3 cm2 of the internal face of the right forelimb, as well as the mediotibial regions of both right and left hindlimbs (Figure 1B).\nAfter placing the rabbit on a thermal blanket or heating pad to avoid hypothermia during the procedure, apply a suitable conducting gel to the electrodes and position these in the shaved regions of the limbs. Fix the electrodes with surgical tape.\nVerify that a correct ECG signal is displayed on the screen of the system; usually a simultaneous 1-lead electrocardiographic tracing is enough to synchronously monitor the heart rhythm during the whole echocardiographic study (Figure 1A and Figure 1C).\n\t​NOTE: In addition to heart rate, monitor respiratory rate as well as temperature. Respiratory rate can be monitored visually or through the incidence of thoracic movements in the echocardiographic image, whilst temperature should be monitored via rectal probe. These parameters should be monitored at the beginning, then every 10 min and at the end of the procedure. Rabbits do not tend to vomit during anesthesia10,11; therefore, fasting of the rabbits is not routinely recommended before an echocardiographic examination.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59457/59457fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "To obtain a parsternal long axis (PSLAX) view of the heart, place the rabbit in the right lateral recumbent position, with the forelimbs outstretched away from the thorax, with surgical tape (Figure 1A and Figure 1C).\n\t\nTo achieve the best imaging quality possible, it is important to keep the skin of the thoracic region as flat as possible to increase the penetration and improve overall imaging quality whilst imaging the animal. For this, hold the forelimbs away from the thorax with one hand, whilst using the free hand to identify any skin folds and pockets, flatten these from top to bottom, and move any skin folding away from the chest towards the lateral side and back of the rabbit. This is particularly important for older and larger rabbits whose excessive skin and subcutaneous fat tissue could reduce image quality.\n\t\tNOTE: The cardiac area of the chest should be positioned over the cutout section in the table. However, keep in mind that, in this position, the abdomen has a natural tendency to move towards the notch, and creates a positive pressure that displaces the heart cranially, which then interferes with good echocardiographic imaging. To prevent this, it is important that the abdomen rests completely on the table and, to achieve this, it is useful to gently move the abdominal organs towards the caudal region of the animal through gentle massaging (Figure 1A and Figure 1C).\nFor echocardiographic imaging, hold the transducer with the right hand, whilst using the left hand to operate the controls of the echocardiography system as shown in Figure 1D.\n\t\nTo maintain good skin contact, apply undiluted ethanol to the skin and then enough ultrasound transmission gel to the head of the transducer.",
    "Next, position the transducer closely to the skin of the right hemithorax, at the level of the second to third intercostal space and about 1-3 cm away from the right parasternal line, with the transducer orientation mark pointing to the right shoulder of the animal and at an angle of approximately 30° relative to the midline (Figure 2A). This should produce an image of the right PSLAX of the heart (see Representative Results).\nOnce the 2D cardiac images are displayed on the screen, the next step is to adjust the ultrasound unit controls to obtain optimal images. The main ones are:\n\t\nDepth and zoom controls: Use these controls to optimize the area of interest. The depth of the image must be adequate so that the cardiac structures can be seen on each image. Use the zoom tool for better assessment of structures of interest, e.g., integrity of valves and leaflets.\nTotal gain and time-gain compensation (i.e., gain settings at different depths in real time): Control gray scales and gains manually to minimize background noise and to maximize the delineation of cardiac structures. These parameters are especially important in rabbits because of the poor echogenicity of the ventricular myocardium.\nDynamic range or compression: Use this control to adjust the number of shades of gray that are displayed by the image. Set the dynamic range so the blood pool is dark and the tissue is bright. This will result in better endocardial border definition, which is important to obtain left ventricular volumes.",
    "Sector width: Begin the examination with a wide sector (90°) and after an overview of the heart, reduce the sector width if specific areas need to be better imaged. Decreasing the sector size improves the temporal resolution by increasing the frame rate. This is especially important when 2D echocardiography is used to guide Doppler examination.\nTo maintain the position of the transducer whilst imaging the rabbit, and to reduce the fatigue of the operator, use the index finger to anchor the hand to the table or the chest of the animal, whilst the other fingers hold the transducer (Figure 2A).\nObtain two main imaging planes of the heart in the right PSLAX view.\n\t\nFind an imaging plane which sections the heart longitudinally and where all four chambers of the heart (two atria and two ventricles) can be identified; also, when a wide field of view is used, the apex of the heart should also come into view on the left side of the image (see Representative Results section).\nPerform subtle movements of the transducer, such as sweeping, rocking and rotation, relative to the intercostal space as well as the craniocaudal and dorsoventral angle of the ultrasound beam to obtain the other imaging plane of the parasternal long axis view (Figure 2A,B). In the other imaging plane, the left ventricular outflow track (LVOT) and the aorta can be identified (see Representative Results).\nImage orientation: Note that the base of the heart will be on the right side of the sector image.\nAfter obtaining the appropriate imaging planes, use B-mode to evaluate overall function of the heart, and use color Doppler to assess blood flow across all valves as well as the integrity of the interventricular septum (IVS).\n\t​NOTE: Always save images of the different views and planes for offline analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59457/59457fig2.jpg",

Parasternal short axis view of the heart\nWith the transducer at the same location in the chest while displaying a well-aligned PSLAX, perform a counter clockwise rotation of the transducer of approximately 90° (Figure 3A) to obtain a right parasternal short axis (PSSAX) view. This time, the transducer orientation mark should be pointing towards the left shoulder of the rabbit.\n\tNOTE: To help maintain the transducer in the same location of the chest whilst rotating the transducer, use the left hand to perform the rotation from the cord of the transducer as shown in Figure 3B.\nIn the parasternal short axis view, obtain three imaging planes by sweeping the transducer along the axis of the heart: the mid-ventricular, the mitral valve, and the high base with the pulmonary artery (PA) and the aortic valve (AoV) in view.\n\t\nIn the mid-ventricular imaging plane, which sections the heart at the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae level (Figures 3C), visualize the right ventricle (RV) at the top and the left ventricle (LV) at the bottom of the image (see Representative Results).\nUse B-mode to evaluate radial and circumferential contraction and relaxation of the LV, and check for regional wall motion abnormalities.",
    "Use M-mode and with the help of the track ball move the cursor in real time over the 2D image, and then place the cursor in the middle of the LV, between both papillary muscles, perpendicular to the IVS and left ventricular free wall (FW) (Figure 3C). Once the M-mode images are displayed on screen, store images for offline analysis. In rabbits with high heart rates, use higher sweep speeds to better separate cardiac events during the cardiac cycle (e.g., 150 mm/sec).\nBy sweeping the transducer towards the cephalic region (Figure 3D), obtain a mitral valve (MV) plane. Use B-mode and M-mode to evaluate the integrity and motility of the MV leaflets. Place the cursor along the middle of the LV, perpendicular to the IVS (Figure 3E), to obtain detailed information regarding excursion of the MV in relation to the IVS.\nSweep the transducer further cranially to result in an imaging plane at the level of the high base (also known as AoV plane; Figure 3F - H), where the AoV and its leaflets, the right ventricular outflow track (RVOT), the PA, and the right and left atria (LA) can be identified (see Representative Results).\nImage orientation: Note that the PA will be on the right side of the sector image.\nTo completely visualize the PA and its bifurcation, use a greater angulation and, sometimes, a cranial displacement of the transducer (an intercostal space).",
    "Use B-mode for evaluation of the size and shape of these structures (e.g., left atrial size is increased in congestive heart failure), and use color Doppler and PWD to record the velocity of blood flow (outflow) at the PV level, by placing the sample volume just below the opening of the PV leaflets (Figure 3G). Finally, use M-mode and place the cursor along the AoV and LA (Figure 3H).\nUse the following main controls and adjustments to obtain adequate color flow Doppler images:\n\t\nWith the color sector positioned in the area of interest, reduce the angle between the sector and the blood flow direction as much as possible.\nColor sector width: Adjust this to the valve area, in order to increase the frame rate and improve the color flow information.\nBaseline and pulse repetition frequency (PRF): Adjust the baseline on the color bar and the PRF, to allow higher velocities to be displayed. A number at the top and bottom of the color bar represents the maximum detectable velocity before color aliasing occurs.\n\t\tNOTE: Aliasing is more frequent in color flow processingthan spectral pulsed Doppler, because a portion of the pulses is assigned to obtain cross sectional images in detriment to the color flow Doppler information.\nColor gain: First, increase this to the point that it just begins to create background noise, and then decrease to a level that optimizes color flow imaging.\nUse the following main controls to obtain adequate spectral Doppler images:\n\t\nCursor position: Make this parallel to blood flow direction; at least, maintain at an angle < 30°.\nGate position: It is a marker in the cursor line corresponding to the sampling site. Place it after the aortic and pulmonary valves and at the leaflet tips of the atrioventricular valves.",
    "Gate size: Use the minimum setting except to obtain small regurgitant flows.\nBaseline: Select the baseline depending on the direction of the blood flow. Place it at the top when blood flows against the transducer (e.g. pulmonary and aortic flows), or at the bottom when the blood flows toward the transducer (e.g. atrioventricular valves flows).\nScale: Select this according to the velocity of the blood flow, usually, 25% higher than the obtained velocity.\nDoppler gain: Use this to intensify the Doppler signals. Increase gain until the color displays.\nColorization of the Doppler signal: Use magenta color when the Doppler spectrum is weak because it makes the velocity sharper.\nWall filter: Use this to decrease the amount of low-frequency noise that is produced by the cardiac walls.\nSweep speed: Use higher sweep speeds to facilitate time measurements.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59457/59457fig3.jpg",

Apical 4 chambers view of the heart\nTo obtain an Apical 4 chambers (AP4C) view, place the rabbit in the left lateral recumbent position with the forelimbs outstretched away from the thoracic region by means of surgical tape ( Figure 4A). Maintain the skin of the thorax flat in a similar way as described above (Step 2.1.1). The cardiac area of the chest should be positioned over the cutout section of the table. Similarly, the abdomen should be well-supported on the table after moving caudally the abdominal organs through gentle massaging.",
    "Apply ultrasound gel to the transducer, and then access the heart through the notch in the table and position it closely to the skin of the left hemithorax, at the level of the 4th-5th intercostal space with the midclavicular line, with the transducer orientation mark pointing towards the back of the rabbit (in the direction of the left scapula) (Figure 4B). In this way, the transducer is orthogonal with the apex of the heart and the ultrasound beam is directed towards the base of the heart.\n\t\nFrom this position, if necessary, move the transducer upward one intercostal space at a time until the ~4th intercostal space (a maneuver often called \"window shopping\").\nUpon reaching the appropriate intercostal space (which may vary according to size and/or age of the rabbit), observe an image of the heart from the apex to the base of the heart, the typical heart shape where all four chambers can be seen, with the left and right ventricles at the top and both atria at the bottom of the image (see Figure 4C,D and Representative Results).\nImage orientation: Note that the LV will be on the right side of the sector image.\nAvoid foreshortening the apex in this view, so that the typical AP4C view of the heart should give a bullet shape image of the LV with the IVS in the middle (Figure 4C,D). If the apex is rounded, the LV is likely foreshortened; therefore, move the transducer downwards one intercostal space and/or tilt of the transducer.",
    "Use B-mode to check for regional wall motion abnormalities and have a global view of the LV function. Use color Doppler to evaluate flow across the atrioventricular valves, and use PWD and position the sample volume at the level of the MV leaflet tips to obtain images of the MV inflow spectrum (Figure 4C).\nUse TDI mode and place the sample volume at the septal and lateral sides of the mitral valve annulus (Figure 4D).\nUse M-mode and place the cursor aligned with the lateral MV annulus to obtain the mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE). Store images in each of these modes for offline analysis of cardiac function.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59457/59457fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Use B-mode to evaluate the LVOT, the movement of the AoV leaflets, as well as the LV cavity size and function.\nUse color Doppler mode for evaluation of outflow across the AoV, and use PWD to assess flow velocity across this valve by positioning the sample volume just behind the AoV (Figure 4F).\nSubscription Required.
