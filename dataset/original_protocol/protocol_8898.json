    "NOTE: The following procedures are in accordance with guidelines approved by the Canadian Council of Animal Care. All efforts are made to minimize pain and distress of animals during procedures.\n1. Coating of Filters\nNOTE: When culture filter inserts are placed in wells of multi-well plates, two compartments are defined: the top compartment is the region above the insert and the bottom compartment is the one below the insert Figure 1A.a-b. Explants are seeded in the top compartment where they attach to the top side of the filter; many axons grow through the filter and extend on the bottom side of the filter, within the bottom compartment Figure 1A.c. The standard working volumes (i.e. for applying coating solution, washes, culture media, etc) are 2 ml for the bottom compartment and 1 ml for the top compartment and are going to be referred to in the protocol as “standard volumes”. Add solutions starting with the bottom compartment by placing the tip of the pipette in the gap between the insert and the side of the well. Also, tilt the insert to one side while dispensing the solution to prevent bubbles from being trapped on the bottom of the filter.\nStart coating the filters the day before plating. Under the sterile tissue culture hood, place 24 mm filter inserts in a 6-well receiving plate. Incubate inserts with poly-D-lysine in water (1 mg/ml) for 1 hr at RT using standard volumes: 2 ml in the bottom compartment and 1 ml in the top.\nAspirate poly-D-lysine and rinse once with water. Aspirate water, close the lid and leave plates to dry in the hood O/N. During aspiration of liquids, make sure to remove a remnant of liquid that becomes trapped directly under the filter.",
    "The next morning, dilute laminin in water (10 µg/ml), mix and warm at 37 °C. Incubate inserts with laminin 1 hr in cell incubator at 37 °C, using standard volumes.\nAspirate laminin and add collagen in water (0.1 mg/ml) and incubate for 1 hr at RT. In this case use 2 ml for the bottom compartment and 2 ml for the top compartment.\nAspirate collagen and wash once with sterile water. The filters are now ready to receive culture media and DRG explants, as described in STEP 3.\n2. Dissecting Embryonic Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) Explants\nAnesthetize a 13-day pregnant female mouse by an IP injection of Avertin (250 mg/kg). Wait 10-15 min and check for lack of corneal and pedal withdrawal reflexes. Once reflexes are absent, perform cervical dislocation.\nDisinfect all surgical instruments and female abdomen with 70% ethanol. Allow instruments to dry. Hold the skin of the abdomen and cut through the skin and muscle layers to expose the abdominal cavity.\nRemove the uterus by detaching from the cervix and ovaries. In a sterile hood, remove the embryos from the uterus with scissors and collect them in a Petri dish filled with ice-cold L15 media. Keep on ice.\n\tNOTE: Refer to previous technical reports for further details regarding how to obtain embryos of 13 days of gestation17,18.\nUnder the microscope, lay the embryo on a side and use small spring scissors to remove the head. Make an incision along the lateral sides to discard the chest, belly, limbs and tail. Keep the back containing the spine, lay ventral side up and remove all visceral organs.",
    "With small spring scissors, expose the entire spinal cord by cutting the spinal column from its ventral side along the midline. Hold the carcass down with one pair of forceps (#3) and use a second pair to hold the spinal cord by its most rostral aspect.\nSlowly and gently pull the cord away from the vertebral cavity and pinch off DRGs from the spinal cord using ultra-thin forceps (#5). Group the DRGs to be collected on the bottom of the dish.\nCollect grouped DRGs by aspirating with a 200 µl pipette tip that has been cut to enlarge its opening. Place the DRGs in a tube and leave on ice until the DRG collection is finished.\n\tNOTE: White/transparent tips are preferred because DRGs do not stick to the walls of this tip (as compared to standard yellow tips). Flushing tips with media before use further prevents DRGs from sticking to its walls.\n3. Seeding and Maintenance of Dorsal Root Ganglion Explants on Filters\nAdd complete DRG media at 37 °C to the coated inserts using standard volumes. Supplement the bottom compartment media with 15 ng/ml of NGF, while keeping the top compartment NGF-free.\n\tNOTE: Although NGF efficiently diffuses across the filter and its concentration equilibrates within hours, we have observed that applying NGF to the bottom compartment directly before seeding significantly increases axonal yield on the bottom surface of the filter.\nTransfer the DRGs from the tube to the filters using a 1,000 µl pipette with a tip trimmed to enlarge its opening.\nDraw media into the tip 2-3x before collecting the DRGs. This prevents them from sticking to the inner side of the tip. The same tip can be re-used for all wells. The use of uncolored tips (versus standard blue tips) reduces DRG sticking to the tip surface.",
    "To transfer DRGs, set the pipette at 800 µl. Aspirate approximately 200 µl of media from the top side of the filter, then go to the DRG-containing tube and pipette a small volume up and down – to resuspend DRGs that have sunk to the bottom. Aspirate the whole volume and pipette DRGs submerging the tip in the middle of the insert.\nOnce all inserts are loaded, close the plate lid and swirl the plate 10x, tapping it gently on the hood bench between each swirl. These movements increase axonal yield by helping DRG explants sink and attach to the filter. This also helps distribute explants evenly so that axons from different explants don’t overlap.\n\tNOTE: The explant seeding procedure described in the previous steps significantly increases the overall rate of explant attachment to the substrate (up to 75%). Most significantly, the pipetting procedure readily prevents explants from floating on the media surface instead of sinking to the bottom of the insert.\nFor biochemical analyses, seed DRGs from one embryo (around 30) per filter. For morphological analyses, use either half or a third of the DRGs from one embryo (10-15). This decision must be made before collecting the DRGs into tubes, so that all DRGs of a tube are seeded into a single well (whether it is 30, 15, or 10 DRGs).\nMaintain cultures in a cell incubator at 37 °C, changing media every 2-3 days. To change media, aspirate the top compartment first, followed by the bottom compartment. Add fresh media in standard volumes starting with the bottom compartment.",
    "NOTE: To prevent cells/axons from drying, do not change media in more than 3 inserts at the same time. DRGs grown on filters in the presence of NGF will extend long axons, reaching up to 2 mm after 2 days in culture.\n4. Trophic Factor Withdrawal Treatment\nNGF withdrawal induces axonal degeneration with axonal fragmentation (determined by phase contrast and β-III-tubulin IF) that first appears around 12 hr after withdrawal. Complete fragmentation is achieved by 36 hr. How long the degeneration is left to proceed for has to be chosen by the end user according to the experimental design.\nAfter the 2-day axonal extension phase, change media from top and bottom compartments to media that lacks NGF and contains anti-NGF antibodies (1 µg/ml) to sequester any remaining (or endogenously produced) NGF.\nReturn plates to cell incubator (37 °C) to allow NGF withdrawal-induced degeneration to proceed for the desired amount of time.\nProceed to protein extraction (step 6) for examination by western blot or directly examine the filters by IF (step 7).\n5. Axonal Transection to Induce Wallerian Degeneration\nThis procedure leaves the axons on the bottom side of the filter detached from their cell body, but otherwise intact. Thereafter, these axons rapidly initiate Wallerian degeneration. Axonal fragmentation (evidenced by phase contrast or β-III-tubulin IF) first appears by 3 hr after transection; by 9 hr, axons are completely fragmented and are detached from the filter. How long the degeneration is left to proceed for has to be chosen by the end user according to the experimental design.\nScrape the top side of the filter, containing grown DRG explants, with a cell-scraper. Ensure complete removal of top material by moving scraper in X-, Y- and circular directions.",
    "Discard the media from the top compartment containing the floating explants that have been scraped from the filter and replace with 1 ml of pre-warmed, complete DRG media containing NGF (10 ng/ml).\nReturn plate to cell incubator (37 °C) to allow Wallerian degeneration to proceed for the amount of time chosen by the end user.\nProceed to protein extraction (step 6) for examination by western blot or directly examine the filters by IF (step 7).\n6. Protein Extraction of Axonal Samples\nFill collection tubes (1.5 ml) with 75 µl of Laemmli sample buffer. Keep tubes on ice while harvesting axons from the entire set of filters.\nWash the filter with DRG explants in PBS and scrape the top side of the filter. Remove the insert from the plate, clean the top side of the filter with a cotton-tip applicator and aspirate any extra PBS from the top and bottom sides.\nPlace insert upside down on bench and cut the filter out of the insert using a sharp scalpel. Hold the filter with forceps, bottom up. Make a cut from the circumference to the center of the filter with scissors.\nPlace filter on top of the collection tube, and with forceps, press the center of the filter down the tube. While doing this, a funnel should form. Push the funnel-shaped filter to the bottom of the tube so that it is submerged in the Laemmli sample buffer.\nComplete protein extraction by boiling the tubes for 4 min. Remove the filter using forceps to place it upside-down into the top of the tube and performing a brief spin (2,000 x g for 15 sec). Discard the dried filters.\nResolve 10 µl of the axonal protein preparation in a SDS-PAGE followed by western blot to detect the proteins of interest.",
    "NOTE: As a reference, an axonal preparation from 20 explants grown for 2 days and lysed in 100 µl of RIPA lysis buffer will have a protein concentration of 4-6 µg/µl.\n7. Immunofluorescence Examination of Axons on Filters\nThe following steps outline the general manipulations to perform IF staining on filter inserts, exemplified by the detection of β-III-tubulin. Fixative, incubation times, concentrations and other particulars should be optimized for other antigen-antibody pairs.\nUtilize previously used 6-well plates, thoroughly cleaned, for the following washes and incubations of the inserts.\nBriefly wash inserts in PBS. Fix them in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at RT on shaker.\nAfter fixation, scrape and clean the top side of the insert to collect the axons that grew exclusively on the bottom surface of the filter. Proceed with standard incubations for IF.\nIncubate inserts in blocking solution (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% skim milk), using standard volumes, for 1 hr at RT with gentle shaking.\nTransfer inserts to primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (anti-β-III-tubulin, 1:5,000), using standard volumes. Incubate O/N (~18 hr) at 4 °C with gentle shaking.\nWash the first antibody twice in PBS (2 X 10 min at RT).\nTransfer inserts to fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (goat anti-mouse, 1:2,000), using standard volumes. Incubate covered from light for 2 hr at RT with gentle shaking.\nWash the secondary antibody 3x in PBS (3 x 10 min at RT).\nAfter IF is complete, take insert out, pour away PBS from the last wash and clean the top side of the filter with a cotton-tip applicator. Aspirate any liquid from the top and bottom sides.\nPlace insert upside-down on bench, and cut the filter out of the insert with a sharp scalpel.",
    "Hold the filter with forceps, downside up, and place on microscopy slide. Overlay with a coverslip and fluorescent-compatible mounting media. Let dry flat in cold room, covered from light. Examine and capture images using a fluorescent microscope.\n\tNOTE: When stored at 4 °C and protected from light, these preparations can be kept for weeks with minimal loss of fluorescence.\nOPTIONAL: Alternatively, IF can be performed on filters that have been removed from the insert. To do that, scrape and clean the top side of the filters directly after fixation.\n\t\nTake filters out of the inserts with a sharp scalpel and place filters axons-up on the bottom of a six-well plate.\nAfterwards, perform incubations for IF as indicated in 7.4-7.8 and 7.11. The advantage of this alternative is that it saves reagents, since, for example, incubation volumes can go down to 500 µl (compared to the 3 ml used when filters are directly stained on the inserts as shown in 7.1-7.11).\nSubscription Required.
