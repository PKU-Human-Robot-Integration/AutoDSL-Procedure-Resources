    "The animal protocols were approved by Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Animal Ethics Committee.\n1. Animals\nObtain male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (280–320 g, 8-10 weeks of age) from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center. House the animals in Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Laboratory Animal Center. Note that the breeding conditions should include 12 h/ 2h light/dark cycles and keep temperature constant at 24 °C. Provide water and food ad libitum. Note that a total of 48 rats are used in this study. One note, in this model, we need to observe the pain response during the whole process. If pain medication is applied, then we cannot successfully establish the pain model. After the experiments, the rats are sacrificed.\n2. CPIP model establishment\nAnesthetize all rats (including sham and CPIP model groups) with sodium phenobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection [i.p.]). Maintain anesthesia with up to 20 mg/kg/h phenobarbital [i.p.], if necessary. Check the reflexes of each animal by pinching its hind paw or tail tip using forceps. Make sure that the rats are not responsive before model establishment. Place vet ointment on eyes to avoid dryness during the procedure. Place the anesthetized rats on a heated pad maintained at 37 °C for the following procedure.\nIschemia and reperfusion of the hind paw\nLubricate the right hind paw and ankle with glycerol once the rat is anesthetized.\nSlide a Nitrile 70 Durometer O-ring with a 7/32\" (5.5 mm) internal diameter into the larger side of a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (with the snap-cap cut off before use). Carefully insert the hind paw into the hollow Eppendorf tube until reaching the bottom.",
    "Gradually slide the O-ring from the tube to the right hind limb near the ankle joint and place for 3 h. Apply the same treatment to a sham group of rats, except that a broken O-ring, which is cut off and should not induce ischemia, should be placed around the ankle.\nCut off the O-ring 3 h after the ischemia step. Carefully watch the rat until it recovers enough consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Note that the rat that received anesthesia should not be placed back to the company of other rats until it fully recovered.\n3. Nocifensive behavioral tests\nPlace the rat in a transparent Plexiglas chamber that is sitting on a mesh floor. Habituate the rat for 0.5 h before any behavioral testing.\nMechanical allodynia\nUse von Frey filaments (0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 15.0, and 26.0 g filaments) for the test. Begin the test from the middle filament (4.0 g). Vertically apply the filaments to the middle plantar surface of the hind paw. Slightly apply suitable force to bend the filament for up to 5 s. A sudden retraction of the hind paw in response to the stimuli is considered a nocifensive behavior. Conduct the mechanical allodynia test on days -3, -2, -1, and every other day until day 13.\nApply the up-down testing method to test the threshold. Apply the Dixon method for calculating 50% paw withdrawal threshold (PWT)13,14,15.\nThermal hyperalgesia\nUse Hargreaves' method to examine thermal hyperalgesia. Directly aim the light beam emitted from a bulb (50 W) to the hind paw to measure the paw withdrawal latency (PWL). Set 20 s as the cut-off threshold to avoid excessive injury from the heating.",
    "Repeat each test 3x in 5 min intervals for each hind paw. Take the average of these three tests as the PWL of each rat16. Conduct the thermal hyperalgesia test on days -3, -2, -1, and every other day until day 13.\nCapsaicin-induced acute nocifensive behavior\nPrepare capsaicin stock solution (200 mM) using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and further dilute to 1:1000 in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for hind paw injection. The final DMSO concentration in PBS is 0.1% (vehicle contains 0.1% DMSO in PBS only). Inject capsaicin or vehicle into the hind paw (intraplantar injection) at a volume of 50 μL using a 30 G needle attached to 1 mL syringe.\nRecord the nocifensive behavior (i.e., licking, biting, or flinching of the injected paw) using a video camera for 10 min right after the injection and quantified thereafter as previously described17,18,19.\nHind paw edema evaluation: Evaluate the hind paw edema by measuring the increase in paw diameter. Measure with a digital caliper and calculate the difference between the basal value and the test value observed at different time points. Assess the changes in paw thickness at 15 min, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after model establishment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
