Unless otherwise stated, cell pellets are suspended by pipetting.\nPBMC sample thawing\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step details how to thaw cryopreserved PBMCs before staining.\nPrepare 15 mL conical tubes with RPMI 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS).\nThaw each sample vial in a 37°C water bath until a small pellet of ice appears.\nTransfer the contents of PBMC vial to a 15 mL conical tube and rinse the vial.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nDiscard flow-through and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of RPMI 2% FCS.\nAdd 1 μL of Pierce Universal Nuclease 25 kU and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nFilter the cells with a 30 μm filter and proceed to cell count.\nMix 10 μL of cell suspension with 10 μL of trypan blue.\nLoad this mix onto KOVA slide and count cells.\nCentrifuge all samples: 400 × g, 5 min, 20°C–22°C.\nResuspend the pellet in CSM, and distribute 3.106 cells/well up to 250 μL in 96-well polypropylene plates.\nViability stain\nTiming: 10 min\nThis step details how to label dead cells.\nCentrifuge the plate: 1,017 × g, 3 min, 20°C–22°C.\nPrepare cisplatin working solution.\nAdd 100 μL / well of cisplatin diluted at final a concentration of 1 μM and incubate samples for 5 min at 37°C.\nNote: Viability stain can be performed using the same procedure replacing cisplatin by 103Rh. Use 103Rh at a dilution of 1:500 in RPMI and incubate 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd 100 μL of RPMI to stop the reaction and centrifuge the plate 1,017 × g, 3 min, 20°C–22°C.",
    "Aspirate the flow-through and wash the cells with 200 μL of CSM, centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 20°C–22°C.\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2082-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating strategy\nPBMCs from healthy volunteers were stained with metal-labeled antibodies and analyzed by mass cytometry (CyTOF Helios®). After removal of beads, cells were pre-gated as DNA+. Dead cells were excluded based on CisPt or Rh positivity. Monocytes were excluded based on CD33 expression. B cells and T cells were excluded based on CD19 and CD3 expression, respectively. Four subsets of NK cells were defined based on CD56 and CD16 expression: CD56bright NK cells, CD56dimCD16+ NK cells, CD56dimCD16- NK cells, and unconventional CD56-CD16+ NK cells.\nCritical: Since cisplatin is a DNA alkylating agent, steps 11–14 should be performed under a chemical hood.\nBlocking Fc receptors and extracellular staining\nTiming: 1 h 15 min\nThis step details how to perform FcR blocking, extracellular staining and cell fixation.\nPrepare FcR blocking reagent by diluting Fc Block 1:10 with CSM.\nNote: FcR blocking can be replaced by CSM supplemented with 10% FCS (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nAdd 100 μL of diluted FcR blocking reagent to each well, mix by pipetting and incubate for 10 min at 4°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2082-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Impact of the staining procedure on NK cell phenotyping\nThe labeling procedure including extracellular and intracellular staining was performed from a control sample either on day 0, or splitted into extracellular staining on day 0, and intracellular staining on day 3.\n(A) Displays the frequency of immune populations with each of the staining procedures.\n(B) Displays the frequency of NK cell markers with each of the staining procedures.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2082-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Intracellular and extracellular aspecific epitopes from a control sample were blocked using PBS 0.5 mg/mL Human Fc Block, or PBS 10% FCS.\n(A) Displays the frequency of immune populations with each of the blocking procedures.\n(B) Displays the frequency of NK cell markers with each of the blocking procedures.\nAdd 100 μL of CSM and centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nAdd 25 μL of extracellular master mix per sample and incubate for 1 h at 4°C.\nNote: Extracellular mix is stable at −80°C for one year (data not shown).\nAdd 175 μL of CSM and centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nAspirate the flow-through and wash the cells with 200 μL of CSM, centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nNote: A second incubation for secondary antibodies can be added before 2% formaldehyde fixation step.\nAspirate the flow-through and add 100 μL of formaldehyde 2% and incubate for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd 100 μL of CSM and centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nNote: This procedure can be stopped at this stage and cells stored in CSM for 72 h at 4°C. After 72 h, the intracellular labeling can be processed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nIntracellular staining\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step details how to perform the permeabilization in order to stain the intracellular and intranuclear markers.\nPermeabilize using 200 μL per well of Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set by diluting Fixation/Permeabilization concentrate in Perm Diluent (1/4 dilution).\nAdd 25 μL of intracellular master mix per sample and incubate for 30 min at 4°C.\nAdd 175 μL of Perm/Wash working solution and centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nAspirate the flow-through and wash the cells with 200 μL of 1× Perm/Wash, centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nFixation and DNA intercalator staining\nTiming: 10 min",
    "Finally, samples are fixed with DNA intercalator to identify cells after acquisition.\nPrepare extemporaneously 2% formaldehyde solution by diluting fresh 16% formaldehyde with PBS.\nAdd 100 μL of 2% PFA + DNA intercalator (Cell-IDTM Intercalator-Ir) diluted at 1:1,000 per sample and incubate 12–16 h.\nNote: At this stage, labeled samples can be frozen or directly acquired on the Helios system.\nSample freezing\nTiming: 30 min\nHere, we propose a freezing strategy that enables labeling stability for a maximum storage period of one week.\nWash the cells with 100 μL of CSM and centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nAspirate the flow-through and wash the cells with 200 μL of CSM and centrifuge 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nAdd 100 μL of freezing media per sample and store directly in microtubes at −80°C until the acquisition.\nNote: Labeled samples can be stored at −80°C freezer for one week without losing staining quality.\nInstrument tuning and sample acquisition\nTiming: 45 min for 1 M cells\nThe startup procedure follows the instrument manufacturer’s guidelines involving checking the instrument performance, monitoring background and tuning the system.\nThaw samples at 20°C–22°C, transfer the cells into a 96-well plate, and add 100 μL of PBS.\nCentrifuge samples for 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nAspirate flow-through by pipette.\nRepeat steps 32–34.\nAdd 200 μL of deionized water (DIW) and proceed to cell count.\nNote: Wash the samples in DIW only after instrument start-up and tuning validation because samples should not remain in DIW for more than 1 h. Thus, samples must be thawed gradually.\nCentrifuge samples for 1,017 × g, 3 min, 4°C and aspirate the flow-through.\nPrepare the stock solution of 1:10 EQ Bead/DIW.",
    "Note: Depending on the sample (cell line, tumor…) a higher dilution in EQ Beads/DIW is necessary to avoid fluidic line clogging.\nAspirate flow-through by pipette and resuspend one sample with EQ Bead/DIW by adjusting concentration to achieve an acquisition rate of 500 events/second i.e., 1 M/mL.\nNormalized and concatenated the files before analysis.\nSeveral algorithms can be used to for data analysis.\nNote: For analysis of immune populations that represent at least 1% of the total PBMC, a minimum of 50 000 cells should be acquired. However, when possible, we recommend the acquisition of a minimum of 500 000 cells in order to enable the analysis of rare immune subsets, or subsets that are under-represented in specific pathologic conditions such as hematologic malignancies, in which circulating tumor cells may represent up to 99% of the total PBMC."
