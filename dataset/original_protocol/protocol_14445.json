    "Ethics Statement: The Swiss Cantonal Ethical Committee of Zurich approved this protocol (KEK-ZH No. 2015-0113)\n1. Recruitment of Participants\nRecruit participants through social media and flyers.\nScreen and include participants who are university students between 18 and 30 years of age. Ensure that they can perform endurance sports a minimum of two times (minimum total time: 2 h) and a maximum of three times (maximum total time: 3 h) per week, that they are free of current pain symptoms, and that they have had no injuries in the torso or lower extremities in the previous 12 months.\nScreen and exclude participants if they are allergic to cold (including Raynaud's disease), suffer from cardiovascular diseases or any other disease, must take any medication, are pregnant, or have skeletal deviations.\n2. Familiarization with the Testing Protocol (Day 1)\nOne week prior to the experiment, instruct the participants to perform a maximum of 5 CMJs on a jump mat (see the Table of Materials), with a 1-min resting period between each jump12,27. Instruct them to start from an upright position and to place their hands on their hips to eliminate arm swing. Permit a self-determined range of motion and contraction time during the CMJs.\nInstruct the participants to return to the laboratory one week after the familiarization session in a pain-free state and without having performed exhaustive exercise 48 h prior to the experiment.\n\tNOTE: The pain-free and exhaustion-free state will be assessed as the baseline measurements.\n3. Baseline Measurements (Day 2)\nMeasure the standing body-height, body-weight, and estimated lower-body fat percentage of the participants three times in a row and calculate the mean values28.",
    "Have the participants assess their individual DOMS of both frontal thighs on a visual analog scale (VAS; 0-10 cm)5 during a 3-s lasting squat position29 (90° knee angle). Ask the participants: \"How sore are your frontal thighs?\" Record the number from the VAS in mm.\n\tNOTE: The far-left endpoint of the scale (0 cm) represents \"no soreness,\" and the far-right endpoint of the scale (10 cm) represents \"severe soreness.\"\nHave the participants rate their individual perceived exertion in an upright standing position using a 6-20 BORG scale30. Ask the participants: \"What is your actual level of perceived exertion?\" Record the verbally communicated number.\n\tNOTE: The participants rate this verbally by telling the researcher one number between 6 (no perceived exertion) and 20 (maximum perceived exertion).\nHave the participants perform a maximum of 3 CMJs12,27 (as practiced during the familiarization session), with a 30-s pause between the three jumps, on a jump mat.\n\tNOTE: The jump heights from the CMJs are indirectly recorded as the time in flight by the jump mat system.\nUse the highest jump and calculate the peak power output (PPO) according to the formula used in the study of Sayers et al.31:\n\tPPO = (60.7 x jump height [cm]) + (45.3 x body weight [kg]) – 2,055\n\tNOTE: The subjective ratings and the objective assessments will be repeated directly after the recovery application (0 h) and 24, 48, and 72 h after the exhaustive jump protocol (see below).\nRandomly assign the participants either to the cold group or to the thermoneutral group by drawing lots.\n4. Exhaustive Jump Protocol\nDirectly after the randomization, instruct the participants to get ready to perform the exhaustive jump protocol, without any warm-up exercises.",
    "Have two researchers visually inspect the quality of the jumps (maximum jump performance and touching the ground with the fingers after each jump), verbally correct, and encourage the participants during the jump protocol.\nHave the participants perform a maximum of 3 x 30 CMJs or until exhaustion at their own speeds, with a 30 s pause between the sets.\n\tNOTE: Allow the participants to sit down and drink water during the pause.\n5. Recovery Application\nAfter the exhaustive jump protocol, have a blinded researcher apply either a cold cuff or a thermoneutral cuff (see the Table of Materials) to a participant's thighs.\nPlace the participant in supine position and apply both cuffs directly onto the skin of each thigh to ensure full contact, but using minimum pressure to avoid any compression effects.\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, refill the tank of a continuous programmable cooling and heating device with a ready-to-use, non-toxic lubrication mixture consisting of propylene glycol and demineralized water to the maximum level.\nStart the device and apply either the cold modality (+ 8 °C) or the thermoneutral modality (+ 32 °C) for a duration of 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Instruct the participants not to report information about their temperature sensation.\nTake off the thigh cuffs after the application and shut down the device.\n6. Non-invasive Recovery Assessment After 0 h\nNOTE: The researcher performing all recovery assessments should not be informed if the participants received a cold- or a thermoneutral-cuff application.\nHave the participants rate their individual DOMS and RPE, as described in steps 3.2 and 3.3.\nHave the participants perform a maximum of 3 CMJs and calculate the PPO, as described in steps 3.4 and 3.5.",
    "Instruct the participants to maintain their daily habits but to refrain from alcohol, sport, and recreational training during the 72 h recovery period. Instruct the participants to return to the laboratory exactly 24, 48, and 72 h after the exhaustive jump protocol.\n7. Non-invasive Recovery Assessment After 24 h (Day 3), 48 h (Day 4), and 72 h (Day 5)\nHave the participants rate their individual DOMS and RPE, as described in steps 3.2 and 3.3.\nHave the participants perform a maximum of 3 CMJs and calculate the PPO, as described in steps 3.4 and 3.5.\n\tNOTE: The protocol ends after the 72 h follow-up period (Day 5)."
