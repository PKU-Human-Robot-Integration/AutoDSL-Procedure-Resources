    "Note: The procedure for muscle removal (Figure 1) is a modification of previously described methods for preparing larval fillets. The steps that precede and follow muscle removal are outlined briefly and the reader is referred to previous work 10, 11 for more detailed descriptions.\n1. Dissect Larva in Cold Saline\nPrepare a working dilution of cold HL3.1 saline15 or cold Ca2+-free HL3.1 saline11 (Table 1). Place the larva in a silicone elastomer dish with just enough cold saline to cover the bottom of the dish.\n\tNOTE: See Discussion regarding the choice of saline.\ntable:\n﻿0\n1x HL3.1 saline (pH 7.2)\n5 mM HEPES\n70 mM NaCl\n5 mM KCl\n1.5 mM CaCl2 (omit for Ca2+-free saline)\n4 mM MgCl2\n10 mM NaHCO3\n5 mM trehalose\n115 mM sucrose\nFilter sterilize and store at 4 °C\nNote: Composition mimics insect hemolymph\nTable 1. Composition of Cold Saline.\nPosition the larva with the ventral side up. The ventral surface of the larva can be identified by the abdominal dentical belts and the dorsal side by the primary larval tracheal tubes running from anterior to posterior. Stretch the larva in the anterior-posterior direction and pin the head and tail to a silicone elastomer dissecting dish using insect pins. Use fine dissecting scissors to cut along the ventral midline, beginning at one end and progressing toward the other.\n\tNOTE: This orientation preserves the commonly studied dorsal cluster of da neurons.\nAfter the larva is cut open, pin the four corners to the dissecting dish as though opening a book. Use forceps to grab and remove internal organs including the CNS, gut, and trachea. Adjust insect pins so that the fillet is taut but not maximally stretched.",
    "NOTE: Muscles are anchored to the body wall at segmental boundaries. Although muscles cover most of the body wall, they are absent in a narrow region near the dorsal midline.\n2. Muscle Removal\nLocate the dorsal midline of the larva, where muscle tissue is absent. Position a single forceps prong such that it can be inserted underneath the muscle tissue in the flattest possible orientation.\nStarting at the dorsal midline, near the anterior boundary of the segment, carefully slide the forceps prong between the muscle and epidermis, taking care to minimize contact between the forceps and epidermis.\nPull the forceps upwards to break the attachment of the muscle to the body wall at one anchor point. Repeat this process for the remaining hemi-segment(s) of interest.\n\tNOTE: This protocol optimizes preservation of the posterior of each da neuron dendrite field. To preserve the anterior part of the dendrite field, it is best to insert the forceps prong at the posterior end of each segment.\nRe-adjust insect pins such that the larval fillet is maximally stretched in all directions.\nFix the fillet while it is still pinned to the dissecting dish using cold, freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 25 min.\nRinse 5 times in PBS.\nUse forceps to carefully pull away muscle tissue from the remaining anchor points, taking care to minimize contact with the epidermis.\nUnpin and remove the fillet from the dissecting dish to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Perform all subsequent washing, blocking, and immunofluorescence staining steps, as previously described11.\n3. Mount the Larval Fillet\nFirst remove the head and tail using fine dissecting scissors in order to make the sample as flat as possible. Mount the fillet on a coverslip in antifade mountant with the inner surface of the fillet facing the coverslip.",
    "Place a microscope slide on the coverslip and press gently to disperse the mounting medium. Flip the microscope slide over and seal the coverslip on the slide using nail polish. Slides can be stored at -20 °C for at least one month.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
