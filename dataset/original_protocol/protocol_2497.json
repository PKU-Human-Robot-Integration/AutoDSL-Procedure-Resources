    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of the endothelial-epithelial two-cell-type model on filter inserts\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis section describes the sequential preparation of the two-cell-type model consisting of an epithelial and endothelial cell layer grown on the opposite of filter inserts.\nNote: We recommend the following steps. First, prepare inversely cultured HIBCPP cells. After 24 h, turn filter inserts to standard orientation. Start TEER measurement after 4 days and continue daily. Two-cell-type culture is prepared with transparent filter inserts with 0.4 μm pore size and 2 × 106 pore density (Greiner Bio-One 662641). For practical handling see also (Dinner et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCritical: As the background TEER value (insert without any cells) for different filter type varies, this value has to be determined for each individual filter type using separate filter inserts as described in the TEER measurement section, to calculate the corrected TEER values of cells mimicking the BCSFB in Ω cm2.\nPlace a 12-well plate into a sterile, stainless steel box for surgical instruments.\nNote: When using 0.4 μm pore inserts the cell suspension needs some time to soak because of the small pore diameter. Do not close the 12-well plate containing the filters with its own lid, since the lid might touch the cell suspension placed on the membrane of the inverted filter insert. Instead, place the 12-well plate into a sterile, stainless steel box for surgical instruments. Close this box with its corresponding lid, thereby keeping a sufficient distance of the lid to the cell suspension on the membrane of the filter insert (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2131-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(B) 12-well plate is placed in stainless steel box without lid.\n(C) Filter insert is placed into the 12-well plate using sterile forceps.\n(D and E) (D) Filter insert is filled with HIBCPP medium as well as the whole well (E).\n(F and G) Using the forceps, the filter insert is turned upside down within the HIBCPP medium to avoid air bubbles getting into the filter compartment.\n(H) Additional medium is aspirated until the well is filled halfway.\n(I) A drop of medium is placed on the filter membrane to pre-wet the membrane.\n(J) Stainless steel box is placed at 37°C, 5% CO2 until the HIBCPP cell suspension is added to the filter membrane (where the drop was placed). Following the seeding of the cells, the filters remain in stainless steel box until they are flipped into the 24-well plate in correct orientation after 24 h incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2 as the cell suspension would otherwise stick to the lid of the 12-well plate.\nStart the experiment in a 12-well plate with inversely flipped and medium filled filter inserts.\nNote: To fill the 0.4 μm pore filter inserts it is recommended to first place the insert in correct orientation in a 12-well plate using sterile forceps. First fill the insert with HIBCPP medium with a 10 mL serological pipet, and subsequently fill the whole well with HIBCPP medium. Flip the insert “under water” preventing air to enter the insert. Remove medium until the well is approximately half filled. Continue with next insert (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPipet 8 × 104 HIBCPP cells (80 μL of HIBCPP cell suspension adjusted to 1 × 106/mL) on top (bottom side of the filter) of the inverted and medium filled filter inserts.",
    "Note: With 0.4 μm pore inserts it is essential to first pre-wet the top (bottom side) of inverted filter insert with some extra HIBCPP medium before seeding the cells, otherwise the cells will not attach to the insert membrane due to remaining air in the pores preventing sufficient medium supply of HIBCPP cells. If filters with a pore size of 3 μm are used, the inserts can be filled as shown in (Dinner et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Incubate for 30 min at 37°C. Before seeding, remove remaining medium from the top of the insert before pipetting the cell suspension onto the filter membrane.\nCover the seeded filter inserts with the lid of the box and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 (v/v) for 24 h.\nAt day one, add 1 mL HIBCPP medium into the wells of a 24-well plate and turn the filter inserts with sterile forceps to the standard orientation into the 24-wells. For practical handling see (Dinner et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nAdd 500 μL HIBCPP medium into the upper compartment of the filter inserts.\nWhen TEER values reach ∼100–200 Ω cm2 (usually 4 days after seeding of HIBCPP cells), prepare iHCPEnC solution with 1 × 105/mL cells and add 4 × 104 iHCPEnC to the upper compartment of the filter insert containing the HIBCPP medium.\nMeasure TEER every day for the next 4–5 days. Usually, we observe a continuous increase of TEER values up to 600–1,000 Ω cm2.",
    "When TEER values start to increase continuously from ∼100–200 to 600–1,000 Ω cm2 the two-cell-type filter insert is considered to mimic the BCFSB in vitro and can be used for several analyses of the endothelial/epithelial interplay under healthy and pathologic conditions including adherence and migration of immune or cancer cells, infection with pathogens and stimulation with exosomes. Additionally, molecular transport or drug kinetic studies can be performed.\nImmunofluorescence of the two-cell-type model\nTiming: 2 days\nImmunofluorescence imaging allows analysis of the morphology of the endothelial and epithelial cells and to visualize protein distributions within the coculture.\nCritical: The handling of iHCPEnC on filter inserts is intricate, due to their flat morphology and weak adherence to synthetic membranes. This can be overcome with the following protocol.\nThe two-cell-type culture contains 500 μL iHCPEnC medium in the upper reservoir of the filter insert (basolateral side) and 1 mL HIBCPP medium in the 24-well of the plate.\nPre-warm 4% and 8% PFA in PBS to 37°C temperature.\nFor each insert to fix prepare a well with 1 mL 4% PFA in PBS in a 24-well plate.\nAlways start with the fixation of the endothelial cell layer.\nCarefully remove 250 μL of medium from the upper reservoir and very slowly add 250 μL of pre-warmed 8% PFA in PBS for a final concentration of 4% PFA.\nNote: This is done to not disturb the endothelial cell layer by removing the entire medium from the upper compartment.\nFix iHCPEnC for 20 min at room temperature.\nSubsequently, carefully transfer every insert to its 4% PFA well and fix HIBCPP cells for 20 min at room temperature.",
    "Stop the fixation step by gently washing twice with PBS at room temperature, i.e., let the PBS slowly run down the wall of the insert to avoid disturbance of the iHCPEnC layer.\nPause point: Membranes can be stored in PBS at 4°C for 1 week.\nPrepare a strip of ParafilmR with a consecutive row of 50 μL drops of the solutions required for the staining.\nCut out the membrane of the filter insert with a scalpel and place the membrane on a 50 μL drop PBS.\nLift the membrane with forceps from the PBS drop and place the membrane in a 50 μL drop of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Submerge the membrane for 5 min to permeabilize the cells.\nTo remove Triton X-100, wash the cells by placing the membrane in the next drop containing 50 μL PBS. Repeat this step.\nPipet a 50 μL drop of 2% BSA in PBS on the strip of ParafilmR and submerge the membrane to block the cells for 15 min at room temperature.\nPrepare a further 50 μL drop of 2% BSA in PBS containing the primary antibody at the desired dilution (usually 1:100 or 1:200).\nIncubate the membranes for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nTo wash the cells twice, place the membrane to the next 50 μL PBS drop and repeat.\nPrepare a 50 μL drop of 2% BSA in PBS containing the secondary antibody at the desired dilution (usually 1:500) and DAPI at a final concentration 1:10,000 for staining of nuclei. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nAgain, wash cells twice with PBS and once with ddH2O. Aspirate the remaining fluid and let the membranes air dry for 2–3 min.",
    "Mount the filter membrane within two microscope cover glasses (24 × 50 mm) with mounting medium ProLong antifade to allow imaging from both sides (iHCPEnC on the upper, HIBCPP on the lower membrane side).\nNote: Importantly, mounting medium has to be on both sides of the filter membranes. This can be achieved by placing a drop of mounting medium on the cover glass and placing the filter membrane onto the drop. Once all membranes are placed on the cover glass (up to eight membranes can fit), mounting medium is added to the other side of the membranes to ensure they are covered from both sides, followed by placing the second cover glass.\nNote: HIBCPP cells can clearly be identified on the filter membrane in contrast to iHCPEnC. It is recommended to mount all membranes in the same orientation.\nStore overnight (∼24 h) at room temperature in dark before analyzing the membranes using a fluorescent microscope."
