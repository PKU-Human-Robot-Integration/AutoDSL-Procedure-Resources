    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol provided below is described for one hiPSC-MN cell line plated on one full 6-well plate (for fewer number of wells per 6-well plate, see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]). A schematic representation of the protocol is provided in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2397-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Step-by-step scheme of the protocol\nThe labels for the 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes are shown in red font, whereas the notations of the different sub-cellular fractions and their respective instructions are shown in either blue or black font.\nNote: Take into consideration that the timing for the various steps will be delayed incrementally depending on the number of cell lines and/or plates simultaneously used (See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nCritical: All steps are to be performed on ice.\nIsolation of synaptosomes\nTiming: 30 min\nThe first part of the protocol involves the preparation of the total homogenate of the MNs by mechanical disruption. Then the total lysate is purified from the cell debris, nuclei and the extracellular matrix by centrifugation. Upon further centrifugation, the cytosol is obtained in the supernatant, and the crude synaptosomal fraction is extracted from the pellet.\nNote: Always start with one 6-well plate.\nWashing the cells.\nCompletely aspirate the cell culture medium from all wells.\nQuickly wash twice with 500 μL of DPBS per well.\nHomogenate (Ho) preparation.\nDistribute a total of 1 mL of Buffer A to all wells of the 6-well plate.\nUse a cell scraper to collect the cells from all the wells and transfer them to a glass douncer.\nHomogenize manually for 30 strokes and transfer the homogenate (Ho) to the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube labeled “P.”\nCollect 100 μL separately in the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube labeled “Ho.”\nLysate (S1) preparation.",
    "Centrifuge the remaining Ho in tube “P” at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the lysate (S1) to the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube labeled “P3.”\nCritical: Due to the softness of the pellet, please proceed cautiously without disturbing it when collecting the supernatant (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: The supernatant is transferred to the P3 tube because after each subsequent centrifugation the pellet remains in this same tube until the last step when the actual P3 fraction is obtained.\nCollect 100 μL separately in the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube labeled “S1.”\nNote: The pellet (P1) remaining in tube “P” (containing the cell debris, nuclei and extracellular matrix) can be discarded.\nSynaptosome (P2) isolation.\nCentrifuge the P3 tube containing the remaining lysate at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the cytosol (S2) to the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube labeled “S2.”\nResuspend the pellet completely in 200 μL of Buffer B to obtain the crude synaptosomal fraction (P2).\nTransfer 50 μL separately to the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube labeled “P2.”\nEnrichment of post-synaptic density (PSD)\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nThe second part of the protocol involves a further centrifugation step that separates the synaptic cytosol in the supernatant from the PSD fraction in the pellet.\nSeparation of synaptic cytosol fraction (S3).\nCentrifuge the remaining P2 at 20,000 × g for 80 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant containing the synaptic cytosol fraction (S3) to the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube labeled “S3.”\nEnrichment of PSD fraction (P3).\nCompletely resuspend the pellet (remaining in the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube labeled “P3”) in 70 μL of Buffer C to obtain the enriched PSD fraction (P3) (see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nEstimation of protein concentration and storage.",
    "Estimate the protein concentrations of the Ho, S1, S2, P2, S3 and P3 fractions (see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nSnap freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen and store them at –80°C up to 1 year.\nNote: The fractions can also be stored as smaller aliquots in order to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles."
