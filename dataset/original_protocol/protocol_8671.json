    "1. Cannula and Chamber Preparation\nInsert clean borosilicate glass capillaries (outer diameter: 1.2 mm; internal diameter: 0.69 mm; 10 mm in length) into the grooves of a pipette puller with a platinum filament (diameter: 100 µm).\nUsing appropriate settings, pull the capillary to generate a cannula with a long and thin tip (Figure 2) using a micropipette puller. The settings used are: Heat - 700, Pull - 100, Velocity - 50, Time - 10.\nInsert cannula into the holder of pressure myograph chamber. Align the cannulas appropriately.\nCarefully break the tips of the cannulas by using a forceps under the dissecting microscope to the desired diameter. Here we show a cannula with a 10 µm tip (Figure 2).\nFill both cannulas with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 1.8 mM Ca2+; fill the chamber with Ca2+-free aCSF supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) + 10 µM Diltiazem (all solutions should be prepared fresh before the start of the experiment). Depending on the size of the chamber, vary the volume of aCSF between 5 to 20 ml. Store the chamber at 4 ᵒC until ready to start cannulation.\n\tNOTE: Diltiazem is a reversible L-type voltage gated calcium inhibitor that will cause dilation of the arterioles, which facilitates cannulation\n2. Isolation of Parenchymal Arterioles\nEuthanize the animal immediately prior to dissection using standard protocols in the laboratory that are approved by the institution's animal care committee. The use of barbiturates or carbon dioxide is preferred, as other commonly used anesthetics may have vasodilatory effects in the cerebral circulation 15. All animal procedures shown here have been approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee from the University of Nevada School of Medicine, and are in agreement with the National Institutes of Health \"Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals\".",
    "Euthanize the animal using carbon dioxide. Before decapitation, ensure that the animal has stopped breathing and is unresponsive when pinching its paws.\nDecapitate the animal using a sharp scissor (mouse) or guillotine (rat). Remove the skin from the animal's head and cut along the midline cranial suture using a fine tip scissor. Using a blunt forceps (mouse) or a bone plier carefully remove the cranial bones and expose the cerebrum. Remove the brain slowly and carefully as to not damage surface pial arteries. Place the brain into a container filled with 20 ml of Ca2+-free aCSF supplemented with 1% BSA on ice.\nFill a dissection dish containing a pad with ice-cold Ca2+-free aCSF supplemented with 1% BSA and transfer the brain with the ventral surface facing upwards to this dish (Figure 2A). Place the dish under a dissecting microscope (Figure 3A). Pin the brain to the pad using 27-gauge needles. Be careful to avoid placing pins near the middle cerebral artery (MCA).\nLocalize the Circle of Willis and the MCA branching from it. Using sharp and aligned Vannas spring scissors, cut a small rectangle around the MCA. Ensure that rectangle is close to 5 mm across through the entire length of the MCA. The top part of the rectangle should be past the branching point from the Circle of Willis (proximal to the Circle of Willis, Figure 2B, arrow).\nUsing the Vannas spring scissors, perform an undercut into the depth of the tissue for approximately 2 - 3 mm.",
    "NOTE: This part is critical for good isolation of parenchymal arterioles, and it may take a few trials to get it right. If the cut is note made deep enough, the isolated parenchymal arterioles will be short; if the cut is too deep, the arterioles will break at their branching point when the dissected tissue is removed.\nPin down the most distal end of the brain slice into the dissecting dish with the MCA facing upwards (distal from the Circle of Willis) using insect pins. Make a shallow incision to cut the pia near the pin, being careful not to cut too deep into the underlying cerebral cortex (otherwise the pins will not hold).\nCarefully grab each side of the pia with small forceps and start peeling the pia from cortex. If necessary, hold on to the MCA, ensuring that the surrounding pial membrane is not damaged.\nKeep peeling until the pia containing the MCA is free from the cortex. Note that the resistance against peeling will increase close to the Circle the Willis. Be extra careful at this point, because the longer parenchymal arterioles will be in this region.\nOnce the pia is free, place it carefully on top of the pad on the dissecting dish with the surface opposite to parenchymal arterioles facing down (Figure 2B).\nUsing Vannas spring scissors, cut out the dissected arterioles free from the MCA, making sure the ends of the vessel are cut bluntly.\nCollected arterioles can be used for pressure myography, molecular analysis, or isolation of native smooth muscle or endothelial cells.\n3. Pressure Myography",
    "Prepare the suture ahead of time. Cut the dark green nylon thread into 5 mm pieces and place on the sticky side of a double-sided tape on a Petri dish. Under the dissecting microscope, separate each piece into its filaments using fine forceps, and loosely prepare a simple half-hitch knot by passing one end the filament into the other.\nUsing forceps, pick a knot off the double-sided tape, making sure not to grab it with too much pressure. Pull the suture into bath solution, slide knot onto cannula and tighten it at a distance from the tip of the cannula. Repeat this process to have 2 sutures on each cannula.\nCoat a glass micropipette with a 10% BSA solution and then rinse off the excess with Ca2+-free aCSF supplemented with 1% BSA.\nPull 50 µl of solution into the glass micropipette, pull up a parenchymal arteriole and transfer to the pressure myography chamber. Push plunger in one fluid motion to dispense the parenchymal arteriole into the chamber to prevent it from sticking to the internal chamber of the glass micropipette.\nUsing two super fine forceps, open the lumen of the PA, being careful to only touch the very end of the vessel.\nUsing the forceps to hold the edges of the parenchymal arteriole, carefully pull the vessel onto the cannula. Pull far enough on the cannula so that the vessel is not at the very tapered end of the cannula (Figure 3A).\nLoosen the 2 sutures on the cannula and tighten them on the vessel (Figure 3B). Space the sutures apart a little on the vessel, and pull toward the operator while tighten it. Make sure that any branches are tied off before closing the opposite end of the parenchymal arteriole.",
    "Turn chamber around and close the opposite end of the parenchymal arteriole as a blind-sac. To achieve that, open the ties on the opposite cannula and pass it onto the arteriole. Slowly close the knot in such a way that the parenchymal arteriole will be tied to the side of the cannula. Avoid longitudinal stretch of the arteriole. (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: If the goal of the study is to perfuse drugs through the lumen, cannulate the opposite end instead of tying the parenchymal arteriole to the side of the cannula. Make sure the cannulas do not have any salt crystals or internal build-ups that block intraluminal flow. Regulate flow rate appropriately in order to maintain shear stress within physiological levels. A study by Shih et al. shows flow rates inside penetrating arterioles in rats 8, and can serve as an initial guide for pilot studies.\nCarefully transfer the chamber to the stage of the microscope to be used for recording vessel diameter. Attach the chamber onto the microscope stage, connecting temperature probe and inlet and outlets for perfusion to the correct tubes. Pressurize the arteriole to 40 mmHg intraluminal pressure for mouse parenchymal arterioles or 50 mmHg for rat arterioles, using a pressure system available in the laboratory (water column, peristaltic pump coupled to a pressure transducer, etc.). Figure 4D shows an example of a peristaltic pump coupled to a pressure transducer to pressurize the cannulated arteriole.\nTurn on the system used to detect changes in diameter (Figure 3E). Adjust the settings on the microscope, such as illumination and contrast, in order to obtain the best detection possible. Ideally the walls of the arteriole should be dark and the lumen translucent. Once the detection is appropriate, start recording the experiment.",
    "Start the superfusion system. Wash the cannulated, pressurized parenchymal arteriole with warm (37 ᵒC) aCSF containing 1.8 mM Ca2+ for 15 to 20 min at a flow rate between 3 - 5 ml/min. This aCSF should not contain Diltiazem or BSA.\nReplace the regular aCSF with 60 mM KCl aCSF to evaluate the viability of the preparation. At this point PAs should exhibit 10 - 20% constriction to 60 mM KCl. If the arteriole does not constrict to that extent, remove and cannulate another arteriole.\nWash out the 60 mM KCl with regular aCSF. Wait until generation of spontaneous myogenic tone, which could take up to one hour. If arteriole does not have myogenic tone by then, replace it with another arteriole.\n\tNOTE: Myogenic tone is observed as a gradual, and sometimes slow, reduction in the lumen diameter of the vessel without stimulation by contractile agonists or high KCl solution. Myogenic tone is calculated by the following formula: (1 - (active lumen diameter/passive lumen diameter)) x 100 5. An appropriate amount of myogenic tone may vary according to treatments, strains, species, transgenics, etc. In general, physiological myogenic tone ranges from 15 - 30%5.\n4. Example Pressure Myography Experiments: Agonist-induced Constriction and Myogenic Reactivity\nPrepare a series of dilutions of an agonist of choice in aCSF using appropriate concentrations. For the current example the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 was used. A stock solution of 1 ml of U46619 at a concentration of 1 mM was prepared. Transfer 100 µl of the 1 mM solution to a new tube containing 900 µl of aCSF to make a 10-fold dilution of the drug, resulting in a solution containing 100 µM U46619. Repeat this process for 6 dilutions, ranging from 1 mM to 100 nM to prepare a concentration-response constrictor curve.",
    "Add the entire volume of the solution containing the agonist (1 ml for the first dose, followed by 900 µl of all subsequent doses) to 100 ml of superfusing aCSF. This will lead to an extra 100-fold dilution of the agonist. Thus, the final concentrations of agonist in the bath range from 10 pM to 10 µM. Allow arterioles to incubate for ~10 min in each concentration, until luminal diameter reaches a steady-state.\nWash out the agonist by superfusing PAs with aCSF without any drugs until the PA diameter is back to the original value. Incubate the parenchymal arteriole in Ca2+-free aCSF (without BSA) supplemented with 10 µM Diltiazem + 2 mM EGTA to induce maximum dilation and record passive diameter of the arteriole.\nRemove the parenchymal arteriole from the cannula by carefully pulling it out while holding into the end of the ties. Wash the vessel chamber with double deionized water to remove debris and excess of agonist. Fill the chamber with Ca2+-free aCSF + BSA and cannulate another arteriole. It is not recommended to perform more than one experiment per arteriole.\nTo perform a myogenic reactivity experiment, allow the parenchymal arteriole to equilibrate at 40 mmHg intraluminal pressure until spontaneous myogenic tone is generated (described above). Reduce the intraluminal pressure to 5 mmHg and allow PA to equilibrate for ~5 - 10 min, until luminal diameter reaches steady state. Increase the intraluminal pressure stepwise using the interval of choice (for example from 5 to 140 mmHg in 20 mmHg increments).\nDo not expose the arteriole to intraluminal pressure below 5 mmHg, as that could cause collapse and damage the endothelium, thus altering the outcomes of the experiment.",
    "At the end of the pressure curve, superfuse the parenchymal arteriole with Ca2+-free aCSF (without BSA) supplemented with 10 µM Diltiazem + 2 mM EGTA and repeat the pressure steps, starting at the lowest pressure.\n\tNOTE: This will give the passive diameters of the PA, which are necessary to calculate % myogenic tone, defined by the formula: % tone = (1 - (active diameter/passive diameter)) x 100.\nSubscription Required.
