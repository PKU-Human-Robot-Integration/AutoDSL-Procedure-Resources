    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSection A: LINE1 depletion in ESCs\nNucleofection of ESCs with ASOs\nTiming: 30–60 min for steps 1-12\nTiming: 5–30 min for step 13\nDue to the extremely high composition of LINE1 in the genome, it is not possible to delete it by a genome editing approach. Therefore, we applied an antisense oligo (ASO) knockdown approach, using lissamine-conjugated Morpholino ASOs.\nBefore starting, warm up all media and trypsin to 37°C. Warm up nucleofection solution to 20°C–23°C. Add 2 mL 0.1% gelatin to 2 wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate per ASO and plate in the incubator. Thaw ASOs on ice. All reagents should be sterile.\nTrypsinize ESCs: for ESCs grown in 6-well plates, wash each well of ESCs with 1–2 mL PBS before adding 0.5 mL TrypLE Express reagent to dissociate cells. Place in the incubator for 4–5 min to allow cells to detach. Scale all volumes accordingly for ESCs grown in larger dishes.\nPipette ESCs up and down 4–5 times with a P1000 pipette to achieve a single cell suspension. Transfer to a 15 mL conical tube and neutralize with >2× volume of fresh ESC medium.\nUse your preferred method of choice to count the total live number of ESCs in the tube. Transfer 5e6 cells per ASO (for example take 10e6 ESCs to perform nucleofection of ESCs with RC and LINE1 ASOs) to a new 15 mL conical tube, and centrifuge at 400 × g, 3 min to pellet cells.\nResuspend pellet in 10 mL PBS to wash, then pellet as before. In the meantime, get the Nucleofector device ready, and set it to the program, A023.\nNote: alternative nucleofection devices may be used, although these have not been tried in our hands and would require additional optimization steps.",
    "Critical: get all reagents out ready for plating ESCs immediately after nucleofection, to minimize the time that the cells remain in the nucleofection solution. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nRemove the gelatin from the 6-well plate and add 2 mL ESC medium to each well to be used, leave this plate in the hood ready for the cells to be added.\nAspirate PBS and resuspend the ESC pellet in 95 μL nucleofection solution per sample, pipetting up and down only 1–2 times (there will be a small excess from residual PBS) and transfer 95 μL to the bottom of each nucleofection cuvette.\nAdd 5 μL (5 nmol) of ASO to the cells and flick gently a few times to mix.\nInsert the cuvette into the nucleofector and press the button to nucleofect each sample, then take the cuvette(s) back to the tissue culture hood.\nPipette 0.5 mL ESC medium into each cuvette (a white precipitate may float to the top).\nUsing one of the supplied Pasteur pipettes, carefully obtain all the medium containing the nucleofected cells, avoiding any precipitate where possible. Add the cells dropwise to 2 wells of the 6-well plate, which already contains ESC media. Repeat for the other sample(s)\nGently shake the plate to evenly disperse the cells and return to the incubator to allow the ESCs to recover and adhere.\nNext day: change the medium on each sample; there may be a small amount of death/floating cells but not much.\n48 h post nucleofection, ESCs with RC ASOs should be 70%–90% confluent and 50%–70% confluent after LINE1 ASOs. Proceed to RNA FISH or other downstream applications.\nOptional: check for nucleofection efficiency 24 h after under a fluorescent microscope by observing the % red (lissamine-positive) cells. We routinely see 70%–95% positive cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/916-Fig1.jpg",

Adapted from Percharde et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]. (step 19) Rehydrating coverslips with WB: (B) Slides overnight will be firmly attached to the parafilm and should not be directly picked up.\n(C and D) (C) Use a P200 pipette tip placed just at the edge of the coverslip, pressing down into the parafilm to create a small gap to “flush” WB under the coverslip until (D) it floats upwards.\n(E) This enables the coverslip to be lifted up without disturbing the cells.\nESC RNA FISH\nTiming: 3 days\nPerform RNA FISH 48 h after nucleofection. Before beginning, coat glass coverslips with poly-L-Lysine solution, one coverslip placed in each well of a 12-well plate. Apply enough solution to cover wells for 10–20 min. Rinse with sterile H2O and then leave to air dry. Chill 70% RNAse-free Ethanol at −20°C for later permeabilization.\nPlating onto coverslips:\nTrypsinize ESCs and count as before. Resuspend in a volume of 150,000 ESCs/mL. ESCs must be single cell to allow effective FISH staining.\nTransfer 1 mL ESCs (150,000 per well) to each well of the 12-well plate containing a coated coverslip. Gently shake to disperse the cells evenly and place into the incubator.\nLeave the cells to adhere to the coverslips for at least 4 h.\nCritical: from now on, all reagents should be RNAse-free. Use clean gloves sprayed beforehand with anti-RNAse solution such as RNAse-ZAP, and dedicated RNAse-free filter tips.\nFixation and permeabilization:\nCheck ESCs are adhered to coverslips before fixation by gently agitating the dish and observing whether ESCs move. Leave ESCs in the incubator for an extra hour if not adherent.",
    "Wash once gently with 1–2 mL PBS before adding 1 mL 4% PFA solution per well to each well to fix cells without detaching them. Incubate 15 min at 20°C–23°C.\nDiscard the PFA and wash once with PBS\nWash once with 1–2 mL cold 70% ethanol\nRemove and add a fresh change of 70% ethanol. Store plates at 4°C for a minimum of overnight (minimum 15–18 h) before proceeding to hybridization.\nPause point: Plates may be stored for several days or up to 1–2 weeks at 4°C; make sure ethanol does not evaporate.\nHybridization:\nRehydrate coverslips by replacing the ethanol with FISH Wash Buffer (WB). Replace with a second change of WB and leave to rehydrate for at least 5 min.\nThaw an aliquot of hybridization buffer (HB), you will require 100 μL HB per coverslip, and thaw the LINE1 Orf2 RNA FISH probes. Add 0.5 μL probe (appox 6.25 pmol) per 100 μL HB together with 1 μL RNAse-OUT inhibitor.\nWrap foil around a 15 cm tissue culture dish to make it lightproof. Place a piece of parafilm large enough for the coverslips in the dish, and label an area for each condition (Eg RC versus LINE1 ASO). Pipette 100 μL of probe in HB onto the parafilm per coverslip.\nUse coverslip forceps to pick up each coverslip. Blot the edge of the coverslip on lint-free paper to remove excess liquid, before depositing face down onto the HB.\nIncubate in a hybridization oven at 37°C for 45–60 min, then at 30°C overnight (approx. 16–18 h).\nCritical: Do not humidify or seal the chamber, as some drying is meant to occur – evidenced by the coverslips needing to be rehydrated in situ before picking up for washes (step 19, Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1E)\nWashes, mounting and imaging:",
    "Prewarm WB to 30°C–37°C. Right before use, add RNAse-OUT to the correct volume needed for washes (1–2 mL per coverslip per wash).\nTake out the dish containing coverslips. Note that the coverslips will seem almost stuck to the parafilm. With a p200 tip containing some WB, gently pipette some WB between the coverslip (still face down) and the parafilm; the coverslip will ‘float’ a little. Now remove the coverslip face up into a 12-well or 6-well dish containing WB (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1E)\nCritical: Do not try to pick up the coverslip without having pipetted WB underneath; the cells will detach from the coverslip\nRemove this wash and replace with fresh WB. Incubate at 30°C (e.g., back in the hybridization oven), protected from light.\nAdd fresh WB plus DAPI solution (1:1000) and leave for 15–30 min\nMount the coverslips. With forceps, blot the edge of the coverslip to remove excess WB. Place face down on a drop of Vectashield on a microscope slide; we typically use 2 coverslips per slide – e.g., the two conditions to be compared (RC versus LINE1 ASO).\nPress down gently to remove excess Vectashield, blot away. Leave to dry protected from light for 15–30 min before sealing with nail varnish. Do not use hardening mounting medium, FISH signal will not be as strong.\nImaging:\nImage cells on a widefield microscope at 100× oil-immersion magnification (for best visualization of RNA FISH foci - See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). Make sure to collect data from the far-red channel (to visualize the RNA FISH foci) before other channels, e.g., DAPI, to prevent loss of signal from photobleaching.",
    "On our setup we typically found an exposure time of 4–5 s was required. Collect Z-stacks every 0.25 μm using the Z stack function of the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices), and create max projections in FIJI for subsequent quantification. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nQuantify RNA FISH foci numbers per cell in each condition using StarSearch free online software (Raj et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Import in individual images and manually draw around each nuclear outline, then click to quantify FISH foci per nucleus. We maintained the same threshold across images.\nRepresentative FISH results are shown in (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: We found Quasar 670-labeled probes to give the best signal-to-noise ratio for quantification of RNA FISH foci. However, for other probes – eg a control probe, Gapdh Quasar 570 also works well (Cat# SMF-3002-1). Alternative software for quantification includes Rajlabimagetools (https://github.com/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki[href=https://github.com/arjunrajlaboratory/rajlabimagetools/wiki]), or scripts in Cell Profiler - although these have not been tried by the authors and would require optimization.\nSection B: LINE1 depletion in embryos\nMicroinjection of Line1 ASO into zygotes and 2-cells\nTiming: 3 h\nSuccessful microinjection is the key to deliver ASO into zygotes and 2-cells.\nEmbryo collection\nFor zygote collection, sacrifice mice at ∼24 h post hCG administration. For 2-cell collection, sacrifice mice at ∼43 h post hCG administration. Use 20–30 zygotes per condition (8–10 C57Bl/6 mice, see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 8).\nZygotes are collected by either flushing M2 medium into infundibulum using a 30.5 gauge needle and syringe or tearing apart ampulla to release the embryos (Behringer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nUse 300 μL M2 medium with Hyaluronidase (300 μg/mL) to dissociate the remaining cumulus cells attached to the embryos.\nFlushed embryos are then short-term cultured (1 h) in KSOMaa in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 before setting up for microinjection.",
    "Note: For 8–10 superovulated mice, 50–60 fertilised zygotes are expected.\nSetting up microinjection\nPull injection pipettes using P-97 micropipette puller. Injection parameters are adjusted according to the Ramp test. For example, for Ramp test of value 457, apply the following parameter: Heat 496–506, Pull 90, velocity 70, and time 160. Pressure setting, 500.\nBend pulled injection pipettes by microforge. Use the heater setting at level ∼50. Adjust the platinum heater wire with glass bead to the correct position and bend the pipettes to an angle of 10–15 degrees (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/916-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Setting up embryo microinjection\n(A) Bending the injection pipette by microforge (step 22b).\n(B) Injection dish setup (step 22d). M2 medium drops (each of 5 ul; dome-shape drops are for washing and longer dome-shaped drops are for injection) are adding into a 50 mm dish and covered with mineral oil.\n(C) Injection pipette loaded with ASO solution (step 22e).

    "Note: Both Control (Ctl) ASOs or RC ASOs have been used successfully and interchangeably for embryo experiments (Percharde et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Choice of which control to use depends on individual experiments – eg if simultaneous knockdown of different RNAs is required, the generic control may be more appropriate.\nFitting the holding pipette to the pneumatic injector, lower the pipette into the injection drops, aspirate the medium, equilibrate the pressure using the pressure release valve.\nOperation of FemtoJet 4i. Before turning on the Femtojet 4i, disconnect the injection tube. Switch on and re-connect and wait for sufficient pressure to built up for injection. Apply Clean function to remove air bubbles and debris. Adjusting the injection parameters. Typical parameters are: automatic injection mode; pi (Injection pressure): 3–4, ti (Injection time): 1.5, pc (Compensation pressure): 2; pw (Compensation pressure, continuous flow): 1–2 if needed.\nCritical: To avoid flow problems, make sure there is positive hydrostatic pressure, avoid negative pressure, sucking medium for injection\nMicroinjection: the micromanipulator platform is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D. Microinjection is performed at room temp. Zygotes are microinjected with Standard Control, Reverse Complement (RC), or LINE1 ASOs. ASO solutions are injected into the cytoplasm from a stock concentration of 1.5 mM (1×) or 0.75 mM (0.5×), utilizing 2–5 pl of solution per injection (See details in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). For late 2-cell stage injection, embryos are microinjected into the cytoplasm of both blastomeres (see injection details in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: To avoid embryo lysis, leave injected embryos at room temperature for 20 min to recover before conducting embryo culture.

    "Apply negative pressure to aspirate the zygote using the holding pipette. Adjust the focus on the injection pipette, use the x-axis control knob to insert the injection pipette into the cytoplasm of the zygote (avoid the pronuclei), apply the injection pressure using the foot control pedal. Quickly withdraw the injection pipette and finish the microinjection by releasing the zygote by applying positive pressure on the holding pipette. Move the injected zygote using the injection pipette and continue by repeating the procedure until all zygotes have been injected.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. 2-cell embryo microinjection, related to step 22h\nApply negative pressure to aspirate the 2-cell embryo (preferably at the equatorial region) by using the holding pipette. Adjust the focus on the injection pipette, use the x-axis control knob to insert the injection pipette into the cytoplasm of one of the blastomeres (avoid the nuclei), apply the injection pressure by using the foot control pedal. Quickly withdraw the injection pipette and apply the same injection procedure to the other blastomere. Finish the microinjection by releasing the 2-cell embryo by applying positive pressure to the holding pipette. Move the injected 2-cell embryo using the injection pipette and repeat the procedure until all the 2-cell embryos have been injected.\nEmbryo culture: culture embryos in equilibrated KSOM (at least 2 h in the incubator) in KSOM drops (∼80 μL, covered with mineral oil).\nNote: Some or all embryos may be cultured in KSOM medium for 2–3 days to observe embryo progression and validate the effect of LINE1 depletion. Embryos microinjected with LINE1, but not Control/RC ASOs, will arrest at the 2-cell stage, instead of progressing to blastocyst stage (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/916-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Typical results following RC/LINE1 ASOs in ESCs and embryos",
    "(A and B) LINE1 RNA FISH foci are seen in the nucleus of ESCs (DAPI), and foci are significantly reduced upon knockdown with LINE1 ASOs, scale, 10 μm.\n(C and D) Typical LINE1 RNA FISH results in mouse blastocysts (C) and 2-cell embryos (D), Scale, 20 μm. (C) adapted with permission from Percharde et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\n(E and F) In vitro culture of embryos for 3 days after injection of 2-cell embryos with ASOs reveals 2–4 cell arrest upon LINE1 knockdown, scale 250 μm.\nEmbryo RNA FISH\nTiming: 2 days\nEmbryo RNA FISH is performed according to (Lin et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). For imaging 2-cell stage embryos, fix embryos injected at the zygote stage 24 h post microinjection; for blastocyst stage embryos, culture injected embryos for 4 days and select blastocysts for fixation.\nFixation: transfer embryos into pre-cooled 100% methanol (∼180 μL) in 96 well U bottom by pulled (∼150 μm in diameter), bended (∼70°–80°) Pasteur pipette connected to embryo-handling mouth pipette and leave at −20°C for 20 min.\nRehydration: quickly wash the embryos in ice cold 50% methanol and transfer into PBS/PVA for rehydration for 10 min\nCritical: During rehydration, embryos usually float to the surface of the medium. To facilitate sample collection, make microdrops (80 μL) in a 60 mm dish for washing.\nPermeabilisation: permeabilise embryos by incubating for 20 min in 70% ethanol (180 μL) at room temperature in a 96-well plate.\nEquilibration: transfer the embryos to the next row of the 96 well plate into 10% formamide wash buffer (eWB, 180 μL) for 10 min at room temperature.\nHybridization: embryos are cultured with probes diluted in hybridization buffer in microdrops (80 μL) in a 60 mm dish overlaid with mineral at 37°C overnight (8–12 h).",
    "Washes: embryos are washed in 10% formamide wash buffer with Tween-20 (eWB+T, ∼180 μL in 96-well U bottom plate) at 37°C for 30 min.\nCounterstaining: embryos are counterstained in 10% wash buffer with Tween-20 containing DAPI (eWB+T+DAPI) in 37°C for 30 min.\nMounting: embryos are placed into the middle of a slide, add four small droplets of the soft wax around the area to act as a buffer space, apply a coverslip and use a pencil to gently squeeze down to immobilize the embryos without them being squashed. Apply Vectashield medium to the edge of the coverslip and allow it to fill the space and mount the embryos. Absorb the surplus medium using a Kimwipe tissue. Use clear nail polish to seal the coverslip.\nImaging: Same as described above (step 20) except defining the scanning Z-axis values according to the nuclear regions."
