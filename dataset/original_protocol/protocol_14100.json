    "Experiments involving animals were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the relevant local authorities in Erlangen (Regierung von Unterfranken, Würzburg, Germany). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. The collection of human blood was approved by the local ethical committee and the institutional review board of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Each patient gave written informed consent.\n1. Induce Allergic Lung Inflammation in Mice\nNOTE: As described in earlier studies27, the following experimental procedure allows inducing allergic airway inflammation in mice and, accordingly, triggers the accumulation of innate and adaptive immune cells in the BAL. The described protocol has been established in C57BL/6J mice, but adoption to other standard inbred strains should be possible.\nSee Figure 1A for a summary of the in vivo experimental procedure.\nAnesthetize mice by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine.\n\tNOTE: Only use C57BL/6J mice older than 6 weeks and with a body weight of at least 16 g.\n\t\nPrepare ketamine/xylazine solution in PBS (12 mg/mL ketamine; 1.6 mg/mL xylazine) and determine the exact body weight of mice.\nInject the first mouse with 8 µL/g bodyweight of ketamine/xylazine solution intraperitoneally and confirm deep anesthesia via the absence of the paw pinch reflex before proceeding to step 1.3.\nFreshly prepare 5 mg/mL of papain in PBS. Slowly pipette 10 µL (50 µg) of the papain solution into the nostril. Carefully monitor the mouse until awakening.\nRepeat steps 1.1 and 1.2 for all mice included in the experiment. Perform steps 1.1–1.3 on three consecutive days.\n2. Purify and Fluorescently label Human Peripheral Blood CD4+ T Cells\nNOTE: Process cells under sterile conditions.\nCollect 18 mL of full human blood from a peripheral vein. Perform Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation in order to select the fraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).",
    "NOTE: Collection and analysis of primary human material need to be approved by the local ethical authorities. Only a person with an adequate medical qualification is allowed to collect blood from a peripheral vein.\n\t\nCollect blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing monovettes (1.6 mg EDTA/mL blood) in order to avoid coagulation.\nOPTIONAL: Use buffy coat blood, a by-product of blood donation enriched in leukocytes, instead of complete venous blood.\nTransfer blood into a conical 50 mL tube and dilute 1:2 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Carefully add 10 mL of Ficoll-medium (density 1.077 g/mL) as a bottom layer under the diluted blood. Centrifuge the sample (800 x g for 15 min at room temperature without brake).\nCarefully remove the tube from the centrifuge and transfer the PBMC-containing interphase into a new conical 50 mL tube. Discard the upper and bottom layer. Fill the PBMC-containing tube with PBS and centrifuge (300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Remove the supernatant.\nNOTE: Optionally, if necessary, perform lysis of remaining erythrocytes. Carefully add 3 mL of ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACP) lysis buffer (155 mM ammonium chloride; 19 mM potassium hydrogen carbonate and 0.68 mM EDTA; pH 7.27) to the resuspended cell pellet and vortex the sample. Shake the tubes for 3 min. To remove the ACP lysis buffer, add 40 mL of PBS and centrifuge (300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Discard supernatant.\nPurify CD4+ T cells via CD4 microbeads.",
    "NOTE: In general, there are several distributors of magnetic microbeads for purification of human CD4+ cells, which should result in comparable levels of cell purity. Product choice should be based on individual preferences. The following steps of the protocol (2.2.2–2.2.7) are adjusted to a defined CD4 microbead product and respective separation columns as further indicated in the Table of Materials. Some modifications of the protocol might be required in case that an alternative CD4 microbead product is selected.\n\t\nResuspend the PBMC pellet in a minimum of 80 µL PBS containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM EDTA (PBS/FBS/EDTA-buffer) per 107 PBMC. Use a starting population of about 30 x 106 PBMC in order to end-up with approximately 3 x 106 to 6 x 106 purified human CD4+ T cells.\nAdd 20 µL of CD4 microbeads per 107 PBMC, mix gently and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C. Fill the tube with PBS/FBS/EDTA-buffer (cooled down to 4 °C) and centrifuge (300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Remove supernatant.\nPlace a separation column into a magnetic field. Rinse the column with 3 mL of PBS/FBS/EDTA-buffer. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of PBS/FBS/EDTA-buffer (cooled down to 4 °C) and transfer the cell suspension onto the rinsed separation column placed within a magnetic field.\nRinse the separation column three times with 3 mL of PBS/FBS/EDTA-buffer (cooled down to 4 °C) and discard the effluent.\nRemove the separation column from the magnetic field and place it into a 15 mL tube. Elute the CD4+ cell fraction in 5 mL of PBS/FBS/EDTA-buffer by using the plunger.\nFill the tube with PBS and centrifuge (300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Remove supernatant. Repeat this washing step twice.",
    "Determine the number of yielded cells by a standard method of choice (e.g., Neubauer chamber).\nLabel CD4+ T cells with a fluorescent cell proliferation dye.\nResuspend CD4+ T cells in PBS (up to 107 cells/mL; do not use less than 500 µL of PBS).\nPrepare a 6 µM solution of a red light-excitable cell proliferation dye (see Table of Materials) in PBS (pre-warmed to room temperature). Mix this solution 1:2 with the before prepared cell suspension and vortex thoroughly (3 µM final concentration).\nIncubate for 10 min at 37 °C (protected from light). Afterwards, add five volumes of RPMI medium containing 10% FBS and incubate for 5 min on ice (protected from light).\nWash labeled cells three times in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS (centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Resuspend labeled cells in PBS, store on ice and protect from light until use.\nNOTE: Prolonged storage of cells (>60 min) might negatively impact on cell survival.\nOPTIONAL: Determine the purity of the CD4+ cell fraction and the efficacy of the labeling procedure by flow cytometry. Resuspend 0.5 x 106 to 1 x 106 CD4+ cells in 100 µL of buffer (1% FBS, 2 mM EDTA in PBS) and add an anti-human CD4 antibody coupled with a fluorescent dye of choice. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C. Add 1 mL buffer and centrifuge (300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C). Discard supernatant. Proceed with flow cytometric measurement of the sample (representative result is depicted in Figure 1B,C).\n3. Adoptively Transfer Human CD4+ T Cells into Papain-exposed Recipient Mmice\nNOTE: See Figure 1A for a summary of the in vivo performed experimental procedure. Perform cell transfer one day after the last intranasal administration of papain.",
    "Adjust the suspension of fluorescently labeled human CD4+ T cells (step 2.3.4) to a concentration of 1 x 107 cells/mL in PBS. Fill 100 µL of the cell suspension into a 1 mL/30 G-syringe.\nCarefully place the first papain-exposed C57BL/6J mouse (steps 1.1–1.3) into a restraint device for tail vein injection. Use the prepared syringe (step 3.1) to puncture the tail vein and slowly inject 100 µL of the cell suspension containing 1 x 106 labeled human CD4+ cells. Do not immediately pull out the needle after injection, but wait for additional 5 seconds in order to prevent discharge of the cell suspension.\nRelease the mouse from the restraint device and proceed with the next animal. Keep at least one papain-exposed animal, which does not undergo transfer with fluorescently labeled cells to serve as negative control for light-sheet fluorescence microscopy.\n4. Prepare Lung tissue for Light-sheet Fluorescence Microscopy\nNOTE: The following steps are performed 3 h after transfer of fluorescently labeled human cells (step 3.2). The described experimental procedures including harvesting of lung tissue, fixation and solvent-based tissue clearing were adapted from currently described protocols24,28.\nSacrifice the mouse by carbon dioxide (C02) inhalation.\nPerfuse the lung in situ with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA.\nOpen the thorax via cutting along the sternum to expose the heart. Punctate the right ventricle with a 21 G cannula connected to a catheter.\nOpen the left ventricle by cutting and thereby allow the blood and perfusion fluid to exit. Slowly perfuse the lung with 20 mL of ice-cold PBS containing 5 mM EDTA via the catheter.",
    "In order to perform in situ fixation of the lung, do not remove the catheter from the right ventricle. Slowly perfuse the lung with 2 mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solved in PBS. Remove the catheter and the cannula.\nNOTE: PFA-based in situ fixation of lung tissue represents a well-established technique in order to prepare murine lung tissue for subsequent microscopic analysis29,30.\nCAUTION: PFA is toxic and has to be handled under a hood with care.\nFill the lung with 0.75% agarose in situ.\nPrepare 0.75% agarose in PBS and keep it solid at 50 °C in a thermo-shaker until use. Remove the salivary glands of the mouse, cut the sternohyoid muscle and expose the trachea by sliding a forceps underneath.\nPunctuate the exposed trachea with a 30 G needle and replace it by a blunt 30 G catheter to prevent further damage of the trachea resulting in undesired leakage of agarose. Seal the junction between the inserted catheter and the trachea using a needle holder.\nOPTIONAL: Combine the here described procedure with BAL collection to analyze infiltrated human cells in BAL as recently described in detail31 (see Figure 2E for representative results).\nCarefully fill the airways with 0.75% agarose (cooled down to body temperature) via the catheter until complete unfolding of the lung; wait until complete solidification of the agarose. Remove the catheter and carefully harvest the lung in a darkened 2 mL tube filled with 4% PFA.\nFor additional fixation incubate the sample in 4% PFA solved in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C under continuous rotation (31 rpm).",
    "Dehydrate tissue by subsequently incubating the sample under continuous rotation (31 rpm) at 4 °C in 50% ethanol (pH 9), 70% ethanol (pH 9) and 100% ethanol; each step for at least 4 h. At the end, perform a second incubation in fresh 100% ethanol for 4 h.\nPerform solvent-based clearing of the tissue using ethyl cinnamate (ECi). Therefore, transfer the sample into ECi. Incubate overnight at room temperature (under constant rotation) until the tissue appears translucent (see Figure 1D for representative images).\nNOTE: Samples stored in ECi at room temperature (protected from light) are stable over several weeks to months.\n5. Perform Light-sheet Fluorescence Microscopy of Wwhole Murine Lung Lobes\nNOTE: Please see the Table of Materials for details on the light-sheet fluorescence microscope and the corresponding software, on which the following steps are based. Comparable systems by other manufacturers, however, can be used as well with developer-specific modifications of the following protocol. Before starting, get familiar with the microscope-specific operating manual and follow the technical instructions by the responsible person on site.\nSet up the light-sheet microscope.\nTurn on the light-sheet microscope and open the corresponding imaging software on the computer. Fill the sample chamber with filtered ECi (100 µm filter) and place it in its position between the laser beams.\nUse a small drop of organic solvent-stable glue to stick the lung to the sample holder. To keep the required penetration depth of the light-sheets as small as possible, set the lung lobe upright. Next, place the sample holder in its chamber.\nSet the refractive index of the objective to 3.5 when using ECi as clearing reagent.\nAdjust settings at the light-sheet microscope to detect human cells in the context of the whole organ.",
    "Select required lasers (filter for measurement > activate checkboxes of required lasers) and choose appropriate intensities in the control software (laser transmission control > use slider to set laser intensity > apply). Use an excitation wavelength of 488 nm (525/50 filter) to detect autofluorescent lung tissue and 640 nm (680/30 filter) to excite human cells labeled with a fluorophore emitting in the red spectrum.\nFocus on the sample excited at 488 nm and adapt the focus via the ‘chromatic correction’ tool at the excitation wavelength of 640 nm (use the slider to set chromatic correction > apply).\nChoose an appropriate zoom factor; use a low magnification overview (e.g., 6.3x) to determine the overall distribution of labeled cells within the lung tissue and magnified images (e.g., 32x) for detailed localization.\nSelect a sheet width uniformly elucidating the whole organ or a specific section of interest (optics > use slider to set sheet width; usually between 20–40%). Define the sheet numerical aperture (NA) with higher NA creating sharper images (optics > use slider to set the sheet NA; for a murine lung lobe expanded to its physiological size a NA of 0.025% can often be used).\nSelect the number of light-sheets to be used under ‘advanced measurement settings’. In case of bidirectional illumination, merge left and right light-sheets to create a homogenously illuminated image (advanced > merge lightsheets > select blend mode > use sliders to define overlap between both light-sheets).\nNOTE: It is recommended to take advantage of the bidirectional illumination of the sample with three light-sheets each.\nOPTIONAL: To further increase image quality, use the dynamic focus operation. This allows to move the focus in x-direction during image acquisition.",
    "Define start and end positions of the z-stack to be measured and set the step size to 5 µm (xyz-table Z > scan range).\nNOTE: Start and end positions of a z-stack depend on size and positioning of the lung lobe within the sample chamber. However, about 300 to 800 z-stacks are usually acquired for a single lung lobe (5 µm step size).\nSave files using ‘autosave settings’ and start measurement to capture images. After finishing data acquisition, clean the ECi-contaminated sample holder and chamber under running water.\nNOTE: Use the same settings to image several lung lobes that are supposed to be compared afterwards.\n6. Post-image Processing and Quantification of Lung-accumulated Human Cells\nNOTE: Please see Table of Materials for details on the post-imaging software for 3D analysis, on which the following steps are based. However, alternative post-imaging softwares can be used as well.\nLoad the first image of a z-stack (activate the surpass button, file > open > select image) in order to initiate opening of all other images of the chosen z-stack and their automatic 3D reconstruction.\nTo ensure correct display of x, y and z dimensions, check voxel sizes and adjust them if necessary (edit > image properties > enter voxel size manually). For the voxel size of z, enter the chosen step-size between two images (here 5 µm).\nDisplay each channel in a distinct color (edit > show display adjustment). Click on each channel one after the other to define a color of choice (in Figure 2A,B,C,D the autofluorescence signal is displayed in grey and labeled human CD4+ cells in red).",
    "Adjust intensity, black level and contrast for each channel (edit > show display adjustment) using the triangles in the channel bars or entering exact numbers in the channel settings. For intensity adjustment, use the right triangle. For black level adjustment, use the left triangle and for contrast adjustment, use the middle triangle.\nNOTE: Use the lung derived from the control mouse without cell transfer (step 3.3) to differentiate between specific human cell-derived signals and unspecific background.\nTo quantify labeled cells within the pulmonary tissue use ‘add new spots’ in the  toolbar and select ‘skip automatic creation, edit manually’  for manual cell counting.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, use the automatic cell counting tool under ‘spots’. However, manual counting  allows to differentiate between specific and unspecific signals more precisely.\n\t\nTo compare the accumulation of human cells across different samples, define a lung cube  with a specific volume using the 3D cutting tool (edit > crop 3D) (here 813 μm x 813 μm x 1,000 μm).\nTo count accumulated cells select the 640 nm channel and define a ‘radius scale’ of 10 µm. Then, click on ‘edit’,  check ‘select’ in the pointer menu and mark each cell with a dot via shift-click with the left mouse button. Find the overall number of counted cells displayed in the statistics.\nNOTE:  It is highly recommended to count several cubes per lung lobe (here five) to ensure  reliability of results and compensate for scientist-dependent selection of the counted lung volume (quantification strategy and representative results are depicted in Figure 2D).\nCapture an image using the ‘snapshot’ tool and/or take a video using the ‘animation’ tool. Save adjusted files as .ims files (file > export).",
    "NOTE: For representative purposes, show or hide the frame by checking or unchecking the frame in the toolbar. In addition, display images either as maximal intensity projection (MIP) (toolbar > volume > mode > check MIP) or use the ‘surface mode’ (toolbar > add new surfaces). The ‘surface mode’ has to be activated separately for each channel to highlight tissue architecture and/or cell bodies (representative images are shown in Figure 2C).\nSubscription Required.
