    "All methods described were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Drexel University. All cadaveric animals were acquired from a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-approved farm located in Pennsylvania, USA. A cadaver of a male Yorkshire pig (3 weeks old) was used for the present study.\n1. Tissue harvest\nAcquire a cadaver of a pig from an approved farm and perform the experiments within 2 h from euthanasia. Keep the cadaver on ice until tissue harvest is completed to ensure that the fresh tissue biomechanical properties are conserved.\n\tNOTE: In the published literature, fresh tissue testing in animals is commonly performed within 2 h post-euthanasia. For details, see references11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\nPlace the cadaver in the supine position, make a vertical midline incision along the neck, and expose the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, and trachea from the hyoid bone to the suprasternal notch.\nHarvest the larynx and the full-length trachea using a #10 blade (Figure 1A).\nSeparate the trachea sample from the larynx and then cut the tracheal tube longitudinally along the entire length on one side using the #10 blade (Figure 1B).\nMeasure the thickness of the trachea using the acquired cross-sectional image (obtained using ImageJ20, see Table of Materials) (Figure 1C). Use the measured tissue thickness to calculate the cross-sectional area during data analysis.\nCut the trachea into two circumferential strips approximately 5 mm wide (proximally) and two longitudinal strips approximately 5 mm wide (distally), with the minimum length of these strips being 25 mm (Figure 1D).\nObtain images of the four samples (i.e., cut trachea strips) alongside a ruler. Use these images to provide digitized measurements of the sample width using Image J (Figure 1E). Then, use this measured width to calculate the sample's cross-sectional area during data analysis.",
    "Ensure that all tissue samples are kept hydrated using sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution throughout the study. Keep the samples hydrated in PBS-soaked gauze until ready to test. Immerse the tissue in PBS just before testing for proper hydration.\n2. Biomechanical testing\nAttach each sample to a custom-designed clamp (see the previous reports11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19) so that the sample is held longitudinally between the clamps (Figure 1F).\nCarefully fix the clamps (without inducing any stretch) to a material testing machine (see Table of Materials), which has a 50 N load cell attached to the top actuator (Figure 1G).\nMeasure the grip-to-grip (i.e., clamp) distance using a ruler. Use this distance as the initial tissue length for strain calculations.\nPerform preconditioning by tensile loading each sample five times at a 1%/s strain rate to 1% strain.\nHold each sample at peak elongation of 0% or 10% for 300 s to investigate the viscoelastic stress-relaxation response of the tissue.\nPost the stress-relaxation test, stretch the tissue immediately at 1%/s until mechanical failure occurs.\nDocument the failure site and confirm that no slip has occurred by ensuring the presence of samples within the clamps post testing (Figure 1H).\n3. Data acquisition\nDo not acquire any data during preconditioning.\nRecord the stress-relaxation and failure testing videos using any digital camera at a minimum of 30 frames/s.\nAcquire time (s), load (N), and displacement (mm) data using a data acquisition software (see Table of Materials) at a sampling rate of 250 samples/s during both stress-relaxation and failure testing.\nSave the acquired data as a .csv file and use it for data analysis as detailed in step 4.\nAcquire still images of the clamped tissue before stress-relaxation, after stress-relaxation, and after failure (Figure 2).\n4. Data analysis\nData input",
    "Download and install MATLAB data analysis software (see Table of Materials), including the \"Optimization\" and \"Image Processing\" toolboxes.\nDownload the zipped folder (Supplementary Coding File 1), which includes the MATLAB codes and a sample dataset that will be used to explain the data analysis steps.\nNavigate to the downloaded zipped folder and extract its contents.\nOpen MATLAB and set the unzipped folder as the working directory. Ensure that the working directory has the following folders and files labeled as mentioned in the note below. Ensure that no additional folders or files are present in this working directory since they may interfere with the code and result in an error.\n\t\tNOTE: (1) Failure (Post-Relaxation), (2) Failure Only, (3) Relaxation, (4) calc_relax_failure.m, (5) main_relax_failure.m, (6) testingDates.xlsx.\nNavigate to the Failure Only folder.\n\t\tNOTE: Data contained within this folder are derived from the control group in this study, i.e., biomechanical data from tracheal samples that were subjected to mechanical failure following a 0% elongation.\nStore data from samples tested on a particular date in one Microsoft Excel file using the following file naming convention: mmddyy. For example, data from all control group tracheal samples tested on April 30th, 2022, must be stored in Failure Only | 043022.xlsx.\n\t\tNOTE: Please note that, in the current study, all biomechanical testing was conducted on a single day; however, if data were derived from multiple testing dates, then create a new Microsoft Excel file, named in the convention described, for each of those testing dates.\nOpen Failure Only | 043022.xlsx and recognize that there are multiple worksheet tabs, each containing the raw data from each sample subjected to mechanical failure on this particular date, i.e., April 30th, 2022.\nEnsure that the samples are labeled using the following convention: [sample type]_[sample number]_[insert pre-stretch strain level]%.",
    "NOTE: For example, in the current study, the control group tracheal samples were subjected to mechanical failure testing under axial or circumferential loading without any prior stress relaxation. Therefore, these samples are named in the following format: TA_1_0% and TC_1_0%, respectively. The 0% denotes no pre-stretch. Tracheal samples from our experimental group were first held at fixed elongation under axial or circumferential loading of 10% to evaluate the viscoelastic stress relaxation response and then subjected to mechanical failure. Therefore, these samples are named in the following format: TA_1_10% and TC_1_10% (please refer to step 4.1.16 and step 4.1.23, representing the axial and circumferential loading conditions, respectively).\nSelect the worksheet tab TA_1_0%.

    "Open Relaxation | 043022.xlsx and recognize that there are multiple worksheet tabs, each containing the raw load relaxation data from each sample in the experimental group that was tested on this particular date, i.e., April 30th, 2022.\nPause and note that each of the samples, as indicated by the worksheet tabs included in this Microsoft Excel file, was subsequently subjected to mechanical failure under tensile mechanical loading.\n\t\tNOTE: The corresponding failure data for each of the samples present must be stored in the Failure (Post-Relaxation) folder, further described in step 4.1.20.\nEnsure that the samples are labeled using the convention described in step 4.1.8.\nToggle through each worksheet tab found in the current Microsoft Excel file and refer to step 4.1.9 to ensure that raw load relaxation data for each sample, indicated by any given worksheet tab, are formatted correctly.\nSave and close the current Microsoft Excel file, Relaxation | 043022.xlsx.\nReturn to the working directory of the data analysis software.\nNavigate to the folder Failure (Post-Relaxation).\nEnsure that there is a Microsoft Excel file(s) with the same date(s) (refer to step 4.1.6 for details about naming the Microsoft Excel files corresponding to each testing date) as that present in the folder Relaxation.\n\t\tNOTE: Data contained within the current folder, Failure (Post-Relaxation), are the corresponding raw mechanical failure data from tracheal samples subjected to stress relaxation testing at a fixed elongation of 10% for 300 s.\nOpen Failure (Post-Relaxation) | 043022.xlsx and recognize multiple worksheet tabs, each of which contains raw mechanical failure data from the same samples present in Relaxation | 043022.xlsx.\nEnsure that the samples are labeled using the convention mentioned in step 4.1.8 and that the labels match those in Relaxation | 043022.xlsx.",
    "NOTE: For example, the data in the current Microsoft Excel file for TA_1_10% represent raw mechanical failure data for tracheal specimen #1 under axial loading that previously underwent stress relaxation testing at 10% fixed elongation for 300 s.\nToggle through each worksheet tab and refer to step 4.1.9 to ensure that the header column for the raw mechanical failure data for each sample is formatted correctly.\nClose the current Microsoft Excel file, Failure (Post Relaxation) | 043022.xlsx.\nReturn to the working directory of the data analysis software.\nRepeat steps 4.1.5-4.1.26 for additional testing dates, as applicable.\nOpen the Microsoft Excel file, testingDates.xlsx, which will direct the code to analyze user-specified testing dates.\nList testing dates in the first column in the following format: mm/dd/yy.\nIn the second column, indicate using a Y (for yes) or N (for no) whether any samples on this particular testing date were from the experimental (stress relaxation followed by mechanical failure) group.\nIn the third column, indicate using a Y (for yes) or N (for no) whether any samples on this particular testing date were from the control (direct mechanical failure) group.\nRepeat steps 4.1.29-4.1.31 for additional testing dates.\nSave and close the current Microsoft Excel file, testingDates.xlsx.\nReturn to the working directory of the data analysis software.\nOpen the main script file, main_relax_failure.m.\nSelect the large, green arrow on the software interface to run the code.

Do not include 0% for the control group. However, if data were derived from multiple elongations, for example 10% and 20%, then enter 10,20.",
    "Upon being prompted, input comma-separated stress-relaxation testing durations (in seconds) for the various experimental groups and press OK.\n\t\tNOTE: In the current study, tracheal samples were held at fixed elongation for 300 s and hence, input 300. However, if data were derived from multiple stress relaxation durations, for example 90 s and 300 s, then enter 90,300.\nViscoelastic stress relaxation response\n\t\nUsing the code (main_relax_failure.m), convert load-time data (Code Line 144) to nominal stress-time data using the following equation19: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq01.jpg, where σ represents stress (mega Pascals [MPa]), F represents circumferential or axial load (Newtons [N]), and A0 represents the initial cross-sectional area (millimeters squared [mm2]).\nUsing the code (main_relax_failure.m), determine the peak load and stress magnitudes (Code Lines 138 and 146) in response to the application of the 10% fixed elongation on the sample at the beginning of the 300 s relaxation test.\n\t\tNOTE: These values are hereafter termed initial peak load and initial peak stress, respectively.\nUsing the code (main_relax_failure.m), calculate the percentage reduction in stress (or load) at 300 s (Code Lines 141 and 149) using the following equation: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq02.jpg, where Rel% represents the relaxation percentage, σ(0+) represents the initial peak stress (or initial peak load), and σ(300) represents the recorded stress (or load) level after relaxation over 300 s.\nRefer to the code (main_relax_failure.m) for modeling the viscoelastic stress relaxation response (Code Lines 152-161) using a two-term Prony series exponential decay model. This model is commonly used to describe the viscoelastic behavior of various biological tissues, including various cartilaginous airway levels (trachea, large bronchi, and small bronchi)21,22.",
    "NOTE: Calculated stress values [σ(t)] are normalized to produce the following reduced relaxation function: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq03.jpg and G(0) = 1. To compare viscoelastic stress-relaxation responses, G(t) is curve-fitted using nonlinear least-squares regression as follows: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq04.jpg, where t is the time during stress relaxation hold, g is the relaxation coefficient, τ1 and τ2 and indicate the relaxation times (in seconds) that describe the short- (initial) and long-term (equilibrium) behavior of the tissue, respectively.\nMechanical failure response\n\t\nUse code (main_relax_failure.m) to convert the load-displacement data (Code Lines 143-144) recorded by the tensile testing machine to nominal stress-strain data using the equations mentioned in the note below.\n\t\tNOTE: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq01.jpg, where σ represents nominal stress (MPa), F represents circumferential or axial load (N), and A0 represents the initial cross-sectional area (mm2); imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq05.jpg, where imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq07.jpg represents resultant strain, ΔL represents displacement, and L0 represents the initial length of the sample. For samples subjected to failure tensile testing following stress relaxation hold, L0 represents the pre-stretched length of the tissue. For example, sample 3 (initial length of 8 mm) was pre-stretched to 10%, and therefore, L0 was considered 8.8 mm for computing the resultant strain values19.\nUse the function (calc_relax_failure.m) to identify the maximum load (i.e., failure load) and corresponding failure displacement, as well as the maximum stress (i.e., failure stress) and corresponding failure strain (Code Lines 33 and 61-63).\nUse the function (calc_relax_failure.m) to discard the load-displacement data following the failure load (Line 34).\nUse the function (calc_relax_failure.m) to plot the load-displacement curve and, when prompted, manually select two points in the linear region of the curve to approximate the tissue stiffness (N/mm) (Code Lines 37-58).",
    "NOTE: Since the load-displacement curve is normalized by the cross-sectional area and initial length of the sample to yield the stress-strain curve, the code utilizes the user-selected x- and y- coordinates from the load-displacement curve to compute the modulus of elasticity (MPa) using the following equation19: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq06.jpg, where E represents the modulus of elasticity, x and y represent the selected coordinates on the load-displacement curve, A0 represents the cross-sectional area, L0 represents the length of the sample at the beginning of mechanical failure, and Δσ and Δimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64245/64245eq07.jpg represent the change in stress and strain over the linear region of the failure response, respectively.\nRepeat step 4.3.4 for every sample.\nData output\n\t\nOnce the code is successfully run, ensure that the computed results are available in the working directory of the data analysis software as a Microsoft Excel file in the following naming convention: relax_failure_results_mmddyy.xlsx, where mmddyy will be replaced by the date on which the code was run.\nSubscription Required.
