    "1. Generate Samples for Imaging\nStably express tension sensor construct in desired cell type.\n\t\nClone tension sensor construct into pRRL vector or other viral expression plasmid.\n\t\tNOTE: Several different molecular cloning tools are available to achieve this step including the use of restriction enzymes, overlap extension, and Gibson Assembly35. The pRRL vector is used in lenti viral transduction and enables a substantial degree of protein production through the use of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Different vectors may be needed for a particular context. For instance, the CMV promoter is silenced in some cell types49. Additionally, only FRET-based sensors containing fluorescent protein that lack strong sequence homology, such as mTFP1 and Venus A206K, can be used to create stable cell lines. Sensors containing cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein will likely be subject to homologous recombination50.\nGenerate lentivirus in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T cells using psPax2 and pMD2.G packaging plasmids using standard virus production methods51.\n\t\tCAUTION: Lentivirus should only be handled by properly trained personnel in a biosafety level 2 laboratory environment.\n\t\tNOTE: This combination of cells and packaging plasmids is appropriate for use with pRRL. Other systems may be required with other vectors.\nTransduce desired cells with virus using standard transduction protocols52 and use flow cytometry to sort cells53 selecting a homogenous population expressing each construct at approximately endogenous levels37. After the cell selection, experiments can be conducted immediately, or cells can be cryogenically frozen for later use. Do not exceed 2 freeze-thaw cycles for a given stable cell line.",
    "NOTE: The use of cell lines deficient in the protein to be studied (e.g., vinculin -/- MEFs for the use with the vinculin tension sensor) will increase the signal to noise ratio in FRET experiments as well as limit over-expression artifacts. Such stable mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) lines can be used for approximately 15 passages before significant loss of expression or degradation of sensors is apparent. If viral based methods are not desired, a plethora of commercial reagents can be used according to the manufacturer’s protocol to transiently transfect a variety of cell types with tension sensors in an appropriate plasmid, such as pcDNA3.1. Optimal expression will be 24-48 h following transfection.\nPrepare substrates for cell seeding.\n\t\nAcquire 4, 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes.\nWorking in a cell culture hood, in a 15 mL canonical tube, make 4 mL of 10 µg/mL fibronectin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution using sterile PBS in the cell culture hood. Gently invert the tube once to mix and let the solution sit for 5 min in the cell culture hood.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration or type of ECM protein may have to be adjusted for other cell types. The conditions provided are suitable for MEFs.\nPipette 1 mL of fibronectin solution onto each glass-bottomed dish.\nLeave the fibronectin solution on the dishes for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nAspirate the fibronectin solution, rinse once with PBS, and add 1 mL of PBS.\nSeed the cells onto prepared substrates.\n\t\nStart with the cells of interest at a confluence percentage appropriate for subcultivation in a 6 cm culture dish.\n\t\tNOTE: Different cell types will require distinct cell culture conditions and subcultivation protocols. This section provides guidelines suitable for MEFs. Typically, MEFs are grown to 85% confluence before subcultivation.",
    "Working within a cell culture hood, rinse the cells once with 3 mL of PBS. Add 1 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 3 mL of complete media to the 6 cm dish, collect the cells, and place into a 15 mL conical tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Composition for complete media will depend on the cell type being used. For MEFs, complete media is often defined as high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (containing Amphotericin B, Penicillin, and Streptomycin), and a 1% non-essential amino acid (NEAA) solution.\nSpin the cells down at 1000 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the media and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of complete media.\nRemove PBS from fibronectin-coated glass dishes. Count the cells and seed 30,000 cells onto each fibronectin-coated glass dish with the appropriate complete media for a final volume of 1.5 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: This cell density is appropriate for MEFs and will lead to a population of cells that are not touching, but not exceedingly sparse. The exact cell number may need to be adjusted for other cell types or other imaging chamber.\nAllow the cells to spread for 4 h following seeding. At 2 h of spreading, aspirate the growth media, and rinse once with imaging media, leaving 1.5 mL of imaging media.",
    "NOTE: This spreading time is appropriate for MEFs but may need to be altered for other cells. However, incubation periods of longer than 6-8 h will lead to the significant deposition of ECM protein from serum in the complete media. Imaging media should contain the same additions as complete media but should be optically clear and not contain any compounds that fluoresce in imaging channels, such as flavins, or quench fluorescence, such as phenol red. A generally useful imaging media is DMEM-gfp Live Cell Visualization media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% NEAA solution. If background autofluorescence is unacceptably high, then the amount of serum can be reduced. If a media change is not possible after the initial plating, the cells can be directly resuspended in imaging media supplemented with a trypsin inhibitor.\n2. Set up Microscope for Imaging\nTurn on the microscope.\n\t\nTurn on the arc lamp first.\n\t\tNOTE: An arc lamp will release an electromagnetic pulse, which can damage other equipment that is already on.\nTurn on the filter wheel controller, automated stage controller, microscope-computer interface, and camera.\nTurn on the FRAP laser and laser position controllers.\n\t\tCAUTION: High-powered lasers can be damaging to eyes if directly viewed. It is recommended to configure the microscope system to block laser excitation from being directed to the eye pieces, which can be accomplished by moving a mirror into the FRAP beam path during bleaching to reflect the laser toward the sample and prevent transmission to the eyepiece.\nTurn on the computer and open microscope control software.\nAllow 15 min for the arc lamp and FRAP laser to warm up.\nCalibrate the FRAP laser.",
    "Open the laser configuration window. Set Illumination Setting (during pulse) to the appropriate FRAP illumination settings for laser exposure to the sample. Set Illumination Setting (during imaging) to the illumination settings appropriate for imaging only the acceptor fluorophore.\nSelect the objective to calibrate under Coordinate System Setting. Uncheck Manually Click Calibration Points and check Display images during calibration.\nSet the Dwell time to 10,000 µs and the number of pulses to 100.\nPlace the calibration slide, made of ethidium bromide sealed between a glass slide and a coverslip, into the stage adaptor with the coverslip side down.\n\t\tCAUTION: Ethidium bromide is a mutagen and should be handled using gloves. If the slide is compromised, dispose of according to the institution’s guidelines.\nUse the acceptor illumination settings to focus on the surface of the slide, identifiable as the focal plane with the brightest signal. Small defects in the coating will be visible to aid in focusing.\nMove the slide to an area with uniform fluorescence across the imaging plane.\nClick on Create Setting. The software will initialize the calibration process, automatically bleaching and detecting the position of the bleached point.\nEnsure successful calibration by assessing the final image, which will be a 3 x 3 grid of bleached points that should be evenly distributed and in focus. Save the calibration image for future reference.\nRemove the calibration slide and safely store. Calibration should be performed before beginning each experiment but does not need to be performed between samples.\n3. Choose Parameters for FRET Imaging\nFix one of the generated samples of the cells expressing the tension sensor with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Paraformaldehyde solution should be methanol free, often referred to as EM-grade, to prevent denaturing of fluorescent proteins. Place in PBS after fixation.",
    "CAUTION: Paraformaldehyde solutions are toxic. This step should be performed in a fume hood and the solution should be disposed of according to institutional policies.\n\tNOTE: This optimization does not depend on protein dynamics, and a fixed sample allows for maximum imaging time without worrying about cell health.\nRinse the sample three times with PBS and leave in PBS.\n\tNOTE: Use of most commercially-available mounting media will affect fluorophore properties, making the sample unsuitable for FRET imaging54. Ideally, the cells will be imaged immediately, but may be left overnight at 4 °C. Longer wait times will result in deterioration of the sample.\nPlace the sample into the microscope stage holder for imaging.\nOpen the Multi-Dimensional Acquisition (MDA) tool. Establish a sequential imaging of three channels: acceptor only excitation and emission (acceptor channel), donor excitation and acceptor emission (FRET channel), and donor only excitation and emission (donor channel).\n\tNOTE: There are a variety of ways to image FRET samples. The three-channel or “three-cube” method of imaging paired with means of calibrating the system to measure FRET efficiency is recommended for FRET-based tension sensors55,56. This approach is fast, simple, nondestructive, requires only a standard fluorescence imaging microscope, and enables the comparison of experiments across different days and imaging setups.\nScan the sample using an exposure time of 500 ms and a neutral density (ND) filter of 10%. Find a cell expressing the tension sensor with clear localization to a structure of interest.\nSelect an exposure time of 500 ms or the desired length for each imaging channel and an ND filter of 100% and acquire a FRET image sequence.",
    "Estimate the average intensity of the sensor at the subcellular structures of interest in each imaging channel. Low signals may lead to inaccurate results due to improper correction estimates, non-linearities in detectors, or significant contribution of background signals. An approximate guideline is to aim for intensities above 10% of the dynamic range of the camera (i.e., for a 16-bit camera, intensities should be above 6,000).\n\tNOTE: Identical optical settings (exposure times, filters, objectives, and other variables such as camera gain or binning) must be used for all FRET experiments that will be compared. Changing any of these settings will lead to an alteration in the amount FRET that is either generated and/or detected in the microscopy set-up. FRET efficiency measurements are independent of these setting, but the calibration factors used to determine FRET efficiency are not. In theory, various sets of calibration factors could be used to generate FRET efficiencies from different optical settings, but this is not recommended. Bleaching or phototoxicity can be different between the various settings, creating spurious results.\nAcquire a second FRET image sequence of the same field of view. Estimate photobleaching between frames by comparing average intensity of the sensor in each imaging channel. Photobleaching should be kept to a minimum, preferably less than 1-5% loss of signal.\nAdjust the imaging parameters to maximize the intensity while minimizing photobleaching. For coarse adjustments, change the ND filter being used during acquisition. For finer adjustments, change the exposure time in steps of 250 ms.\nRepeat Steps 3.5 – 3.8 until adequate signal can be obtained while minimizing photobleaching.",
    "NOTE: Typically, settings for the vinculin tension sensor in vinculin -/- MEFs are 1,500 ms, 1,500 ms, and 1,000 ms for the donor, FRET, and acceptor channels respectively. The optimal values will vary with the type of illumination system, objective, filter sets, and sensor expression level.\n4. Choose Parameters for FRAP Imaging\nOptimize the laser settings to ensure complete bleaching of the region of interest (ROI) without bleaching the surrounding area or causing photodamage.\n\t\nFix one of the generated samples of the cells expressing the tension sensor with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: This optimization does not depend on protein dynamics, and a fixed sample allows for maximum imaging time without worrying about cell health. This will also prevent the recovery of bleaching by mobile proteins, allowing for the isolation of the effect of bleaching, avoiding any effects from rapid, diffusion-mediated fluorescence recovery occurring between the incidence of bleaching and taking the first post-bleach image.\n\t\tCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde solutions are toxic. This step should be performed in a fume hood and the solution should be disposed of according to institutional policies.\nRinse the sample 3 times with PBS and leave in PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of most commercially-available mounting media will affect fluorophore properties, making the sample unsuitable for FRAP imaging54. Ideally, the cells will be imaged immediately, but may be left overnight at 4 °C. Longer wait times will result in deterioration of the sample.\nPlace the sample into the microscope stage holder for imaging.\nOpen the laser configuration window. Start with setting a laser dwell time of 1,000 µs and 10 pulses, meaning that each spot in the scan across the ROI will receive 10,000 µs of full-power laser",
    "NOTE: A 500 mW, 515 nm laser was used for bleaching. This was chosen to selectively bleach Venus A206K, the acceptor in vinculin tension sensor, with maximal efficiency. If FRET-based tension sensors with other fluorescent proteins are used, another type of laser may have to be employed.\nFind a cell expressing the tension sensor with clear localization to a structure of interest and acquire an image.\nDraw a rectangular ROI outlining the area to bleach and store the ROI location. Pulse the laser. Snap another image of the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The box size should be approximately the size of the entire FA. Care should be taken that the box size does not vary drastically across experiments. The bleached area must be carefully monitored in proteins whose dynamics are affected by diffusion. This is a potential concern in transmembrane proteins, such as cadherins47, or proteins that diffuse slowly27,57.\nCheck the quality of photobleaching by checking that the entire ROI is bleached such that the intensity is near background levels. Additionally, make sure there is no bleaching outside of the ROI.\nAdjust the laser settings as needed to achieve a significant amount of bleaching within the ROI without inducing significant bleaching outside the ROI. For coarse adjustments, raise and lower the dwell time in steps of 100 µs, and for fine adjustments, raise and lower the number of pulses in steps of 5 pulses.\nRepeat Steps 4.1.5 – 4.1.8 until reaching the minimum settings at which the ROI is fully bleached without off-target photobleaching.",
    "NOTE: Achieving a substantial initial bleaching value without inducing phototoxicity is a key aspect of FRAP analysis. Use the laser settings that result in a complete bleach in the fixed samples. In general, the minimal number of photons should be used to achieve the desired bleaching level. Also, the bleaching protocol should be kept relatively consistent during experiments, as alterations can affect measurements of protein dynamics58.\nOptimize time-lapse parameters to fully capture the dynamics of the protein of interest while minimizing photobleaching.\n\t\nPrepare the microscopy set-up for live cell imaging, preferably with a heated stage and objective as well as CO2 control. Allow to equilibrate for 20 min.\n\t\tNOTE: To maintain the health of the imaged cells, temperature and pH must be maintained in the imaging vessel. A variety of heated stages and objective heaters can readily maintain the cell temperature at 37 °C. The control of pH for many media types can be accomplished by the use of a peristaltic pump to pass humidified 5% CO2 over the sample at 15 mL/min. Alternatively, if CO2 control is unavailable, live imaging media containing HEPES should be used to prevent large pH changes.\nPlace one of the generated samples of the cells expressing the tension sensor into the microscope stage holder for imaging. Allow to equilibrate for 10 min.\nUsing the MDA tool, set up a time-lapse to acquire 3-5 images pre-bleach, bleach the ROI, and continue taking 10-60 images.\n\t\tNOTE: For vinculin at FAs, imaging every 5 s for 5 min post-bleach is sufficient to observe the dynamics without introducing excessive bleaching31. Useful starting points for imaging rate and duration for many other proteins can be found in the literature47,48,59,60.",
    "Use acceptor imaging settings that minimize the exposure of the sample to light, while maintaining a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, to image the structure of interest. A good starting point is half of the ND filter and exposure time necessary for imaging of the acceptor during FRET.\nFind a cell expressing the tension sensor with clear localization to a structure of interest and snap an image.\nDraw a rectangular ROI to highlight where to bleach and store the ROI location. Initiate the time-lapse.\nExamine the resulting set of images for potential issues.\n\t\t\nIf there are substantial jumps (greater than 10% of initial intensity) in fluorescence recovery between frames, reduce the time-step between frames.\nIf there is a significant global loss of fluorescence over time (greater than 5-10% of initial intensity), reduce the number of images taken post-bleach and/or change the imaging settings to reduce the exposure of the sample to light.\nIf fluorescence recovery has not plateaued by the end of the time-lapse, increase the total length of the time-lapse.\nAdjust the time-lapse parameters accordingly and repeat Steps 4.2.5 – 4.2.7 until the fluorescence recovery is adequately captured without global photo-damage to the sample.\n5. Acquire FRET-FRAP data\nPrepare the microscopy set-up for live cell imaging, preferably with a heated stage and objective as well as CO2 control. Allow to equilibrate for 20 min.\n\t\nTo ensure the health of the imaged cells, maintain the temperature at 37 °C in the imaging chamber. Use a peristaltic pump to pass humidified 5% CO2 over the sample at 15 mL/min to maintain the pH.\nAlternatively, if CO2 control is unavailable, use live imaging media containing HEPES to prevent from large pH changes.\nOpen the MDA tool and set up with FRET imaging parameters, including the different filter sets.",
    "Save this MDA to the experimental folder with the name of MDA_FRET_Date.\nSet up another MDA with FRAP imaging parameters, including the different filter sets, the time-lapse settings, and the journal to pulse the laser after pre-bleach acquisition.\nSave this MDA to the experimental folder with the name of MDA_FRAP_Date. Close the MDA window.\nIn the toolbar at the top of the screen, select Journal | Start Recording.\nOpen the MDA window, load the MDA_FRET_Date state and press Acquire. Then load the MDA_FRAP_Date state and press Acquire.\nAt the end of the acquisition, in the toolbar at the top of the screen, select Journal | Stop Recording.\nSave this journal to the experimental folder with the name of FRETFRAP_Date and add it to a toolbar for easy access. Close the MDA window.\nPlace one of the generated samples of the cells expressing the tension sensor into the microscope holder for imaging. Allow to equilibrate for 10 min.\nNavigate the sample using the image acquisition under Acquire | Acquire with minimal exposure time and ND filter to identify the cells of interest.\nSet continuous autofocus by navigating to Devices | Focus. Manually focus on the sample until reaching the correct imaging plane.\nClick Set Continuous Focus, wait for the system to adjust, and click Start Continuous Focusing.\n\tNOTE: This is not required, but significantly improves quality of FRAP recovery curves because it prevents the sample from drifting out-of-focus.\nFind a cell expressing the tension sensor with clear localization to a structure of interest and snap an image.\nDraw a rectangular ROI to highlight where to bleach. Store the ROI location.\nInitialize the FRETFRAP_Date journal, which will begin the acquisition of FRET images followed by the initialization of the FRAP time-lapse.\nRepeat Steps 5.14-5.16 until 10-15 image sets are acquired.",
    "NOTE: Measurement cannot be repeated in the same cell. Once photobleaching occurs, FRET data is unreliable.\n6. Analyze FRET-FRAP data\nAnalyze the FRET images using the software of choice.\n\tNOTE: There are several ways to image and quantitate FRET61, including ratiometric FRET62 and FRET index34,35. However, it is highly recommended to use the estimates of FRET efficiency55,63 for the interpretation of FRET-FRAP data. See the Discussion for further exploration of this topic. For sensitized emission and calculation of FRET efficiency, custom software is available from the Hoffman Lab at https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/HoffmanLab-Public.\nQuantify relevant parameters for each subcellular structure that was bleached. This should include average FRET index/efficiency and average initial acceptor intensity (proportional to concentration) but could also include physical parameters such as ROI size.\nAnalyze the FRAP images using the software of choice.\n\tNOTE: There are several ways to quantitate FRAP26,27,28,29. Key experimental concerns include accounting for bleaching during post-bleach imaging, changes in background intensity, and translocation of highly dynamic subcellular structures, such as focal adhesions. Bleaching corrections and variations in background illumination can be accomplished through the analysis of non-bleached and non-fluorescent regions of the images. Highly dynamic subcellular structures, particularly those showing excessive growth or disassembly dynamics are incompatible with standard FRAP analyses and should not be analyzed. Additionally, there are a variety of ways to normalize the data. The provided guidelines are for the simplest analysis.\nCorrect the recovery data for bleaching effects and then normalize to pre-bleach intensities. Quantify the half-time of recovery and the mobile fraction according to the following equation28,34:\nMF - (MF - Ro)e-kt\n\twhere MF is the mobile fraction, Ro is the initial recovery, and k is the recovery rate. The half-time of the recovery is determined by:\n\tτ1/2 = ln 2/k.",
    "NOTE: There are a variety of publicly-available software packages for completing these analyses64 as well as a variety of ImageJ plugins. Custom software is available from the Hoffman Lab at https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/HoffmanLab-Public. More analyses should be used for the situations where the diffusion affects the dynamics of the protein of interest, multiple time scales are apparent in the recovery, or non-standard bleaching geometries are used.\n7. Interpret FRET-FRAP data\nCompile relevant information for each ROI including: FRET index/efficiency, acceptor intensity, FRAP half-time, FRAP mobile fraction.\n\tNOTE: FRET index or efficiency is used to determine average load across the protein within the ROI. Acceptor intensity measures the local concentration of the protein. The half time of recovery is a measure of protein dynamics. A smaller half-time indicates more rapid turnover. FRAP mobile fraction measures the amount of protein within the ROI that is actively turning over. A larger mobile fraction indicates that a larger percentage of the protein within the ROI is turning over.\nTo probe the effect of local concentration on protein turnover rate and amount, plot FRAP half-time and mobile fraction against initial acceptor intensity.\nTo probe the effect of protein load on protein turnover rate and amount, plot FRAP half-time and mobile fraction against FRET index/efficiency.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the protein or structure, it may also be interesting to examine effects of physical parameters, such as structure size or eccentricity, on protein load or turnover.\nSubscription Required.
