    "Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital and the written informed consent of each patient were obtained in our study.\n1. Patients and Surgical Materials\nNotes: Patients diagnosed with BPH and need surgical treatment in accordance with the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines can be included10. This surgical procedure requires experience and a long learning curve. The experience of the surgeon is one of the most important factors to accomplish this technique, specifically for prostate with a volume exceeding 100 g. The micro explosion effect of holmium laser is suitable for enucleation.\nPre-surgical preparation\n\t\nAssess patients with BPH who require surgical treatment in accordance with the EAU guidelines10.\nExclude those with the following conditions: severe urinary infection, severe pulmonary or heart disease, impairment of renal function, severe bleeding disorder, poor blood pressure control, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, bladder cancer, previous prostate surgery, prostate cancer, urethral stricture, and other surgical contraindications mentioned in our previous reports11.\nPerform preoperative evaluations and conduct certain perioperative treatment according to the results.\nAdminister lumbar or general anesthesia to the patient and place the patient in the lithotomy position.\nPre-surgical evaluation\nNotes: For the preoperative evaluation, perform the followings analyses including the regular surgery check: urinary flow dynamics analysis, prostatic ultrasound analysis, analysis of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and the urethroscopy analysis.\n\t\nPerform HoLEP using a 550 µm end-firing laser fiber and a 100 W Versa Pulse holmium laser, with power settings of 80-100 Wat 1.6-2 J/s and 40-50 Hz. Perform transurethral morcellation with a 26 F nephroscope using a mechanical morcellator. Use about 1 L of normal saline (0.9%) as the irrigation ﬂuid.\n2. Enucleation Procedures",
    "Notes: Use plasma sterilization to sterilize the instruments and put the instruments in aseptic packages until used. Administer lumbar or general anesthesia to the patients and place the patient in the lithotomy position during surgery.\nObservation of the prostate and the urethra\n\t\nInsert continuous-flow cystoscope, ensuring minimal tissue damage and observing the prostate, the urethra, and the bladder carefully.\nLocate the ureteral orifices with the use of a visual obturator for a general assessment, including the median lobe volume and the amount of intravesical tissue.\nIdentify the verumontanum which is one of the most important landmarks for enucleation. Insert the handpieces with a laser fiber connected to the laser machine with the power of the laser machine set to 80-100 W at 1.6-2 J per second and 40-50 Hz.\nTunnel the incision around the 6 o'clock position of the prostate with the patients in the lithotomy position.\n\t\nUsing a holmium laser, make a short horizontal incision around the 6 o'clock position in front of the verumontanum (as shown in Figure 1A) to locate the surgical capsule of the prostate.\nExpose the prostate surgical capsule from the verumontanum to the bladder neck. On the layer of the surgical capsule, create a tunnel from the apex toward the back of the bladder neck, as shown in Figure 1A and 1D.\nWhen the operation is close to the bladder neck, ensure that the mucosa and the muscle are protected to facilitate efficient urinary control.\nLateral lobe removal",
    "Notes: The capsule is characterized by a smooth white tissue with sufficient blood vessels on the surface. Bleeding vessels can also be sealed off by using the laser with a bit further distance than that used in enucleated process (greater distance is suitable for hemostasis, while smaller distance is suitable for cutting). During the procedure, return to the prostatic apex without hesitation to ensure that the exact surgical capsule is located, which is helpful to avoid getting lost in the procedure, when the operator cannot find the clear view.\n\t\nFirst, enucleate the left lateral lobe from the 6 o'clock to the 12 o'clock position at the level of the surgical capsule and then enucleate the other lateral lobe similarly.\nDuring the procedure, use blur separation by using a scope sheath combined with laser cutting.\nHang the enlarged prostate in the 12 o'clock position of the bladder neck without cutting down.\nCut the tissue off from the bladder neck and push it into the bladder at the end of the enucleation procedure.\nRecheck the prostate capsule to ensure no active bleeding occurs. Remove all enlarged glands and stop the severe bleeding points (illustrated in Figure 1A-1F).\n3. Morcellation\nNotes: There are two gears in the morcellator, which can be shifted according to the foot pressure applied. The first gear uses light pressure to absorb tissue and water, whereas the second gear is used for morcellation. To prevent complications and improve the efficiency of the procedure, we have developed traditional morcellation skills and procedures. The approach to implement in this case is discussed in detail in our previous study12. The tissue taken out of the bladder is shown in Figure 2.\nMorcellation procedure",
    "Equip the morcellator and the match tube according to the morcellator instruction, regardless of the kind of morcellator used. Remove the prostate tissue from the bladder by using a morcellator efficiently.\nDuring the procedure, treat the bladder tissue with great caution13. Maintain sufficient irrigation water in the bladder to keep the bladder engorged, thus avoiding bladder injury and to keep the morcellator away from the bladder wall remaining within the bladder, for maximum protection the bladder wall.\nFinally, observe the general condition of the bladder and ensure that no reserved tissue is left in the bladder.\nMorcellation skills\n\t\nAs reported in our earlier study12, prior to morcellation, evaluate the texture of the gland tissue.\nDig holes by using laser to provide friction to the surface of the gland and thus obtain a smooth surface.\nUse the inverse technique to morcellate the large and firm tissues as well as fibrotic, spherical glands with smooth surfaces and firm tissues. During the process invert the morcellator for its opening to face downward in the bladder. Ensure that the circulating water is unobstructed, and constantly feel the bladder pressure during morcellation.\n4. Post-operative Treatment\nAfter surgery, insert the catheter and then irrigate normal saline into the bladder until the irrigation water is clear or only slightly reddish.\nRemove the catheter until the urine becomes clear without gross hematuria.\nIf no obvious retention is observed and the patient can urinate without assistance after catheter removal, discharge the patient from the hospital14,15.\n5. Follow-up Observation\nAfter hospital discharge, examine the follow-up data of the patient for 1, 6, and 12 months, which include the international prostate symptom score (IPSS), over-active bladder scoring system (OABSS), quality of life (QoL), and Qmax. If post-operative complications occur, apply further treatment14.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
