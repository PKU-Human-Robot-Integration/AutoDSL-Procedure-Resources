    "NOTE: The overview of the BEVS protocol steps is outlined in Figure 1.\n1. Generation of a recombinant bacmid DNA\nPreparation of LB agar selective plates for DH10Bac transformation\n\t\nPrepare LB agar plates containing: 50 µg/mL kanamycin, 7 µg/mL gentamicin, 10 µg/mL tetracycline, 200 µg/mL Bluo-gal, and 40 µg/mL IPTG to select for DH10Bac transformants.\nWeigh 25 g of premixed LB broth and 13 g of Bacto Agar and put into 2 L flask. Bring the volume to 1 L with distilled water and autoclave for 15-30 min at 121 °C.\nSet a water bath at 50 °C and cool the autoclaved agar solution in the water bath for 40- 60 min until it is cooled down to 50-55 °C.\nTo the cooled solution, add gentamicin to a final concentration of 7 µg/mL, kanamycin to a final concentration of 50 µg/mL, tetracycline to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL, Bluo-gal to a final concentration of 200 µg/mL, and IPTG to a final concentration of 40 µg/mL.\nMix the agar solution and aliquot 7-10 mL of the medium to each 60 mm plate using a 50 mL pipette. Let the plates sit at room temperature (2 h) to harden. Invert, wrap and store at 4 °C. Plates containing antibiotics are stable for up to 4 weeks.\nTransformation of the plasmid into DH10Bac E. coli competent cells\n\t\nCalculate the required volume of competent cells.\nThaw competent cells on ice, gently spin down and resuspend back by gentle tapping.\nUse a 12-channel pipette to dispense 4 µL of the cells into each well of the 96-well PCR plate.\nAdd ~ 0.3-0.5 µg of recombinant plasmid DNA to the competent cells and mix gently by tapping. Incubate the mixture on ice for 10-15 min.",
    "Heat-shock the mixture in a PCR machine at 42 °C for 45 s. Chill on ice for 2 min.\nDispense 0.5 mL of SOC medium to each well of the 96-well blocks (96-deep well 2.4 mL).\nUse a 12-channel pipette to transfer the transformed bacterial suspension into the corresponding well of the block and cover it with an airpore sheet.\nPlace the block in a shaking incubator at 37 °C with medium agitation (205 rpm) for 4-5 h.\nEvenly spread 30-50 µL of the culture over the surface of the LB agar plate using sterile glass beads. Store the rest of the culture at 4 °C.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C until the color of the blue/white colonies is discernible (40-48 h). Discard the culture when enough white, large colonies are obtained on the plate.\nTo ensure that white colonies contain only recombinant bacmid DNA, re-streak one isolated white colony onto fresh LB agar plates containing antibiotics, bluo-gal, and IPTG to verify the phenotype.\nIncubate for 48 h at 37 °C.\nPick one verified white colony from a re-streaked plate for the extraction of recombinant bacmid DNA.\nIsolating recombinant bacmid DNA\n\t\nInoculate a single, isolated white colony into 3 mL of LB medium supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin, 7 µg/mL gentamicin, and 10 µg/mL tetracycline in 24-well blocks (24-well blocks round bottom) and cover with an airpore sheet.\nGrow at 37 °C overnight with shaking at 250 rpm.\nCentrifuge the 24-well blocks at 2,100 x g for 10 min. Decant the supernatant, invert the block, and tap gently on an absorbent tissue paper. Add 250 µL of solution 1 (cell resuspension solution) to each well.",
    "Seal the blocks with tape pads or any other sealing films and place them onto a shaking platform at 75 rpm for 5-10 min. Check each well to ensure proper cell lysis, and resuspend if necessary, using a 1 mL tip.\nAdd 250 µL of solution 2 (cell lysis solution) to each well, seal the blocks, and place onto a shaking platform at 75 rpm for 30 s (to avoid cross-contamination of the samples, do not invert 24-well blocks) incubating at room temperature for 4 min.\nAdd 250 µL of solution 3 (neutralization solution), seal the blocks, and place onto the shaking platform at 75 rpm for 30 s. A thick white precipitate of protein and E. coli genomic DNA will form. Place the sample on ice for 10-15 min.\nCentrifuge for 60 min at 2,100 x g at 4 °C to tightly pellet the white precipitate material. During centrifugation, label a new microcentrifuge tube and add 0.8 mL of absolute isopropanol.\nGently transfer the supernatant to the tube containing isopropanol, avoiding any white precipitate material. Mix by gently inverting the tube a few times and then place on ice for 5 to 10 min. At this stage, the sample can be stored at -20 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge the sample for 15 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and add 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol to each tube. Invert the tube several times to wash the pellet. Centrifuge for 5 min at 14,000 x g at room temperature. (Optional: repeat wash)\nBring samples inside the laminar flow hood to ensure the plasmid preparation's sterility and remove as much of the supernatant as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: The pellet may become dislodged from the bottom of the tube, so carefully watch the pellet when discarding the supernatant.",
    "Air-dry the pellet inside the laminar flow hood for 15 - 20 min and dissolve the DNA in 50 µL of filtered elution buffer, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5 (make sure that pellets are not over-dried).\nSince recombinant bacmid DNA is greater than 135 kb in size, to avoid shearing of DNA, dissolve the pellet by gentle tapping.\nTo verify the presence of the gene of interest in bacmid DNA, set up the PCR reaction mix in a 96-well PCR plate.\nPrepare the PCR mix as follows: 1 µL of buffer, 0.2 µL (10 mM each) of dNTPs, 0.1 µL of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.1 µL (25 µM) of forward and reverse primers (BACV2FWD: tattccggattattcataccg; BACV2REV: ctctacaaatgtggtatggc), 1 µL of bacmid DNA and 8 µL of water.\nPerform amplification of the target genes with initial denaturation for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min/kb.\nTerminate the reaction after a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C.\nAnalyze 10 µL of the amplification product on 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing nucleic acid staining solution by electrophoresis.\nStore the verified bacmid DNAs at 4 °C.\n2. Generation of recombinant baculovirus stocks\nNOTE: Use exponentially growing Sf9 cells with a viability of 95% or greater for any step of the baculovirus expression protocol, including cell transfection for baculovirus generation, baculovirus volume amplification, protein expression screening, and protein production.\nTransfection of Sf9 cells with Bacmid DNA and transfection reagents (T.R.) such as JetPrime or X-tremeGENE 9.",
    "NOTE: Trypan Blue staining and a hemocytometer can be used to determine viable cell counts and % cell viability. Non-viable cells take up the stain and appear blue under the microscope while viable cells remain unstained. To calculate % cell viability, a total cell count is obtained (unstained and stained) and the viable cell count is divided by the total cell count and multiplied by 100.\n\t\nDilute the exponentially growing Sf9 cells to a final cell density of 4 x 105 cells/mL in serum free insect media and pour into the sterile reagent reservoir.\nUse a programmable multichannel pipette to seed 0.5 mL of the diluted Sf9 cells into each well of a 24-well plate.\nLabel one well of the plate as a control (untransfected) and use it as a control to compare the transfected and non-transfected cells to assess for potential signs of infections.\nAfter seeding the cells into the plates, gently rock the plates back and forth several times to ensure an even monolayer of cells. Do not swirl the plates because the cells will cluster into the center of the well.\nIncubate the plates at 27 °C for at least 1 h to allow for cell attachment to the culture plates.\nMix well the transfection reagent vial. For each transfection, add 2 µL of the transfection reagent to 100 µL of the transfection buffer. Any other unsupplemented insect medium can also be used. Deposit the diluted transfection reagent in a sterile reagent reservoir and gently mix for 10 s.\nUsing a 12-channel pipette, transfer 102 µL of the diluted transfection reagent into a sterile 96-microwell plate.",
    "Transfer 10 µL of a 0.2 µg/µL solution of recombinant bacmid DNA into the corresponding well of a 96-well microwell plate and mix by gently shaking (tapping) the plate from the sides.\nIncubate the transfection mixture for 15-20 min to enable complex formation.\nUsing an adjustable 6-channel pipette designed for transfer between 96- and 24-well plates, add the transfection mix onto the cells dropwise into corresponding wells of transfection plates and incubate for 4-5 h at 27 °C.\nGently rock the plates back and forth several times during the incubation time to ensure the even distribution of the transfection mixture over the cell monolayer.\n4-5 h after transfection, add 1.5 mL of insect serum-free medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) final of heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic to 1% (v/v) final volume (100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 µg/mL of streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/mL of amphotericin B).\nIncubate the cells in a 27 °C incubator for 72-96 h. Gently rock the transfection plates once a day when possible.\nLook for signs of infection (SOI), evident in transfected cells at 72-96 h post-transfection (Figure 2). Keep in mind that the transfected cells will start producing the virus and further infect the culture; thus, look for the signs of infection.\n\t\t​NOTE: Signs of infection are structural changes in the insect cells, such as a 25-50% increase in the cell diameter, enlarged cell nuclei, uniformly rounded shape, loss of proliferation and adherence to the culture dish surface, as well as a decrease in cell viability (Figure 2. Baculovirus Infected and uninfected Sf9 cells).\n3. Small - scale protein expression screening and virus amplification\nInfection of Sf9 cells with P1 baculovirus stocks.",
    "NOTE: 4-5 days after transfection, signs of infection should be evident in the transfected cells when compared to the control (untransfected) cells under an inverted microscope. The initial recombinant baculoviruses secreted into the cell culture medium should be ready to collect.\n\t\nSeed 2 x 105 exponentially growing Sf9 cells in serum-free insect media into each well of the 24-well plates in a total volume of 2 mL for infection with P1 viruses to amplify virus volume (resulting in the generation of the P2 viruses).\nAfter pipetting the cells into the plates, gently rock the plates, using back and forth motion to ensure an even monolayer. Do not swirl the plates because the cells will cluster into the center of the well.\nIncubate the plates at 27 °C for at least 1 h to allow for cellular adherence to the plate.\nDispense 4 mL of Sf9 cells at a density of 3.5-4 x 106 in insect serum-free medium into each well of 24-well blocks to infect with P1 viruses for the protein expression screening.\n\t\tNOTE: Label one well of the 24-well plates and 24-well blocks as control and use as an uninfected control for comparison of infected and non-infected cells when looking for SOI.\nUse a programmable electronic multichannel to allow the simultaneous collection of P1 viruses (step 2.1.13), infection of freshly seeded Sf9 cells (step 3.1.1) and infection of the suspension cells in the 24-well blocks (step 3.1.4) with 150 µL of P1 viruses.\nSpin down the rest of the collected P1 viral stocks for 15 min at 17,970 x g, transfer them into microcentrifuge tubes and store in the dark at 4 °C.",
    "Gently rock the 24-well plates (step 3.1.1) on a reciprocating shaker to ensure an even distribution of the added P1 viruses over the cell monolayer; repeat this a few times during the incubation time.\nCover the 24-well blocks with the suspension culture of infected Sf9 cells (step 3.1.4) with an airpore sheet.\nIncubate the 24-well blocks at 27 °C, shaking at 245 rpm for 72-96 h.\nLook for SOI within 72-96 h after infection time in the 24-well plates with P2 viruses (step 3.1.1) and in the 24-well blocks (step 3.1.4) with infected cells for the expression screening.\n\t\tNOTE: 4-5 days after infection of Sf9 cells with P1 viruses, SOI should be evident in the infected cells when compared to the non-infected control cells under an inverted microscope.\nCollect P2 viruses from 24-well plates, centrifuge for 15 min at 17,970 x g, transfer them into microcentrifuge tubes and store in the dark at 4 °C.\nAt 72-96 h post-infection, spray over the 24-well blocks with 70% ethanol, bring into the laminar flow hood, and check the cell density and viability in a few wells by Trypan Blue staining.\nProceed to protein purification if cells have signs of infection and viability is close to 70-75% as assessed by Trypan Blue staining.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging the 24-well blocks at 525 x g at 4 °C for 15 min. Discard the supernatant and thoroughly re-suspend the pellets in 1 mL of lysis buffer comprising 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.6 % NP-40, 2 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol (v/v) and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (100x protease inhibitor cocktail comprises aprotinin 0.25 mg/mL, leupeptin 0.25 mg/mL, pepstatin A 0.25 mg/mL; E-64 0.25 mg/mL).\nStore the cell suspension at -80 °C for the subsequent test purification (see 3.2.2).",
    "Protein purification from frozen cell suspension in 24-well test-expression blocks.\n\t\nAssembly of the binding block (Figure 3).\n\t\t\nPlace 3 overlapping layers of parafilm on the top of the 96-deep well block (96-deep well 2.4 mL).\nPlace a 96-well filter plate (filter microplate, 96-well, polypropylene with 25 µm ultra high molecular weight polyethylene membrane) on the top of the 96-deep well block.\nPush down the filter plate to secure the tips into the parafilm to seal off the filter plate from the 96-well deep block.\nTransfer 50 µL of pre-equilibrated 50% Ni-NTA resin slurry into each well of the filter plate.\nTest expression procedure\n\t\t\nPlace the frozen cell suspension (step 3.1.15) present in 24-well blocks in a water bath at RT for 5-10 min, then shake at 450 rpm for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the 24-well blocks at 3,275 x g for 15 min.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, transfer the cleared lysates into a filter plate containing 50 µL of pre-equilibrated 50% Ni-NTA resin slurry (step 3.2.1.4) and seal the filter plate with a 96-well cap mat (96-well cap mat, for use with square well, 2 mL).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use a few rubber bands to keep the binding block together during incubation and centrifugation steps.\nPlace the secured binding block for 45-60 min into a rotator in a cold room to incubate cleared lysates with Ni-NTA resin.\nAfter incubation, carefully lift the filter plate and remove the parafilm layer from the surface of the 96-deep well block (step 3.2.1.1).\nPlace back the filter plate on top of the 96-deep well block and spin down the secured binding block for 2 min at 235 x g.\nWash bond Ni-NTA resin 2x with 2 mL of washing buffer comprising 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 15 mM imidazole.",

Analyze the results of test expression to identify the best expressing constructs for large-scale production.\n4. Preparations of the baculovirus-infected insect cells (SCBIIC) for protein production\n4 days before the scheduled production time, split exponentially growing Sf9 cells to a final cell density of 2 x 106 cells/mL into 125 mL / 250 mL / 500 mL Erlenmeyer glass shake flasks with baffles in 50 mL / 100 mL / 200 mL of Insect Serum-Free medium containing 1% (v/v) final antibiotic-antimycotic.\nAdd 0.150 mL / 0.300 mL / 0.6 mL of appropriate P2 viruses, incubate infected cells at 165 rpm on an orbital shaker with a one-inch stroke and at a lower temperature of 25 °C to slow down the cell division.",
    "At 4 days post-infection, check cells under a microscope for SOI and proceed to production if the cell viability as verified with Trypan Blue stain is close to 70-75%.\n5. Sf9 cell preparations for large-scale protein production\n4 days before the scheduled production time, calculate the required volume of Sf9 cells for large-scale protein production.\nSeed 2 L of exponentially growing Sf9 cells in Insect Serum-Free Medium to a cell density of 1 x 106 cells /mL in 2.8 L Fernbach shake flasks.\nIncubate flasks at 27 °C with shaking set at 150 rpm.\n\t​NOTE: To prevent bacterial contamination in the Sf9 cell culture, use gentamicin to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL or penicillin/streptomycin to 50 U/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively.\n6. Infection of the Sf9 cells with SCBIIS for the large-scale protein production\nSplit 2 L or 4 L of exponentially growing Sf9 cells in Insect Serum-Free Medium to a final cell density of 4 x 106 cells/mL in 2.5 L Tunair shake flasks or 5 L reagent bottles.\nAdd 10-12 mL/L of the baculovirus-infected insect cell (SCBIIC) suspension culture.\nIncubate the infected culture of Sf9 cells on a shaker with 145 rpm at the lower temperature of 25 °C (to slow down cell division) for 72-96 h.\nAt 72 h post-infection, check cells under a microscope for SOI and assess cell viability.\nUsually, after about 72 h post-infection, the viability of Sf9 cells drops to 70%-75% (measured using Trypan Blue stain). Harvest infected Sf9 cells in a 1 L polypropylene bottle by centrifugation at 900 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the cell pellet collected from 1 L of the production cell culture with 20-25 mL of 1x PBS by gently swirling and transfer into 50 mL conical tubes.",
