    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of periodontium\nTiming: approx. 10 min\nFill one 35 mm Petri dish with 2 mL of sterile, cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Reinach, Switzerland). Keep it on ice.\nRinse the tooth in sterile, cold HBSS\nHold the tooth crown with a tooth holder.\nWith a surgical blade, scrape the periodontium into the Petri dish filled with sterile HBSS. Limit scraping to the apical two-thirds of the root, to minimize contamination from the gingival region. Troubleshootings 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nCollect with a P1000 pipette all the HBSS and the periodontium fragments in the Petri dish.\nTransfer the HBSS with the periodontium fragments in a clean 15 mL Falcon Tube.\nStore the periodontium suspension on ice until completion of dental pulp isolation (ideally, not longer than 1 h).\nIsolation of the dental pulp\nTiming: approx. 15 min\nIn this step, the tooth will be cracked, and the dental pulp extracted. An overview of the procedure for the dental pulp extraction is provided in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1184-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of dental pulp isolation and digestion to single-cell suspension\n(A) After removal of the periodontium by scratching the lower two-thirds of the tooth root, wipe the tooth with 70% ethanol.\n(B) Crack the tooth with a hammer or a press with a single, firm stroke.\n(C and D) (C) Isolate the dental pulp, (D) cut it into small pieces (approx. 2 mm of diameter) and transfer it into a 15 mL tube containing the digestion solution.\n(E) By the end of the digestion, the cell suspension should be devoid of clumps and tissue fragments.\nCarefully wipe with 70% ethanol the surface of the tooth crown and of the roots to remove eventual remnants of the periodontium and gingival tissues.",
    "Carefully remove the ethanol from the surface.\nDip the tooth in sterile HBSS.\nFill one 35 mm Petri dish with cold, sterile HBSS.\nCrack the tooth with a press or a hammer. Apply a single, powerful stroke to crack enamel and dentin, without generating small debris and applying excessive and prolonged pressure on the dental pulp. A single impulse generally does not cause smashing/squeezing of the pulp, but it rather cracks only the surrounding dentin and enamel.\nWith a first set of curved forceps, carefully separate the cracked fragments of the tooth. The dental pulp will be exposed.\nWith a second, sterile set of straight forceps, remove the dental pulp from the pulp chamber.\nPlace the dental pulp in the Petri dish, previously filled with HBSS.\nPlace the isolated dental pulp under a stereomicroscope, and with the second set of forceps remove any remnants of hard tissues.\nWith a scalpel or with fine dissection scissors, chop the dental pulp in small pieces.\nCollect with a P1000 pipette all the HBSS and the dental pulp fragments in the Petri dish and transfer them in a clean 15 mL Falcon Tube. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nStore the dental pulp suspension on ice for up to 30 min.\nNote: Longer times have not been tested.\nDissociation of dental pulp and periodontium to single-cell suspension\nTiming: approx. 90 min\nCritical: perform all the following steps on ice, whenever possible.\nCentrifuge the dental pulp and the periodontium, now each in approximately 5 mL HBSS in a 15 mL falcon tube, at 300×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully decant the supernatant. Resuspend the dental pulp and the periodontium each in 8 mL of prewarmed Collagenase-P 5 U/mL.\nClose the falcon tubes and seal them with parafilm.\nPlace the falcon tubes into a shaker.",
    "Incubate the tissues at 37°C, shaking horizontally (120–160 rpm), for 40 min.\nEvery 10 min, triturate the tissues by pipetting up and down with a p1000 with slightly cut tip, then place back to digest.\nAt the end of the incubation time, take out the falcon tubes and place them on ice.\nDisaggregate the remaining pieces of tissue by pipetting up and down with a p1000 first with cut tip, then with normal tip.\nNote: Some filaments might remain (e.g., nerve fibres). Moreover, in case of incomplete removal of mineral fragments in step 11, these will always be visible in the cell suspension. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nFill up the falcon tubes with cold HBSS + 2% FBS. Centrifuge at 300×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully decant the supernatant. Resuspend in 1 mL HBSS + 0.02% BSA. Pipette again thoroughly with p1000 with cut tip, then with a p1000 with normal tip, then with a p200 with normal tip.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70 μm filter, place filtered cells on ice.\nNote: filtering through a 40 μm filter induces additional stress to the cells; it is however safer for avoiding the loading of cell duplets during successive steps. Filtering through a 40 μm filter is suggested only if the cells are immediately (< 20 min) processed with 10x Genomics® Single Cell Protocols. In our experience, we kept cells for a maximum of 90 min before proceeding with 10X Genomics Single-Cell RNA sequencing.\nTake 10 μL of cell suspension and mix them with 10 μL of trypan blue 0.4%. Count the cells in a Burker or Neubauer chamber.\nThe concentration should be at least 1000 cells/μL for the 10x Genomics single cell RNA sequencing pipeline.",
    "If lower, centrifuge at 300×g for 10 min at 4°C, then resuspend in the appropriate volume.\nCells can be further processed for 10x Genomics Single-Cell RNA sequencing.\nOptional: In particular in the periodontium, red blood cells could represent a significant fraction of the samples. To minimize the fraction of erythrocytes further processed for 10X Genomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, after step 24 cell suspensions can be processed as described in the following protocol from 10X Genomics: https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-isolation-of-leukocytes-bone-marrow-and-peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-isolation-of-leukocytes-bone-marrow-and-peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing]"
