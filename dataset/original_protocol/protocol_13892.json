  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described in this protocol were conducted under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cheng Hsin General Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine. Eight- to ten-week-old male C57BL/6 wild type mice were used in this protocol.\n1. Anesthesia induction\nAnesthetize the mouse with ~4% isoflurane mixed with room air at ~0.2 L/min in an induction chamber connected to the isoflurane vaporizer.\nEnsure the respiratory pattern is smooth. Check the depth of anesthesia by confirming a lack of toe-pinch reflex in the animal.\n2. Pre-surgical preparation\nShave the mouse head with electrical clippers in a caudal to rostral direction. Do not trim the mouse whiskers.\n\tNOTE: Loss of whiskers may influence the accuracy of subsequent behavioral test results.\nPlace the mouse onto the stereotaxic frame. Carefully insert the ear bars into the ear canals. Ensure the mouse head is stabilized by both ear bars equally.\nBring in the nose cone and maintain anesthesia at 1% - 2% isoflurane for the duration of the surgery.\nApply petroleum jelly to both eyes to prevent drying out during the surgery. Keep the animal on a heating pad to maintain a body temperature of 37 ˚C.\nDisinfect the shaved head with betadine followed by 70% alcohol using sterile cotton swabs. Repeat three times.\n3. CCI surgery\nAdminister 100 µL of Bupivacaine (0.25%) subcutaneously using a 31 G insulin needle prior to the incision. Gently massage the injection site for better absorption.\n\tNOTE: This local anesthetic provides pain relief directly at the site of surgery.",
    "Make a longitudinal incision (~1.5 cm) along the midline on the scalp with a scalpel or scissors. Use a hemostat to hold the skin off to the right side and allow the exposed skull to dry for 1 min. Use a sterile cotton swab to clean away any residual blood and tissues on the skull.\nCheck that the mouse head is level in the horizontal plane.\n\t\nIdentify anatomical landmarks Bregma and Lambda and mark both locations with a pencil.\nEnsure that the head of the animal is level in the rostral-caudal direction. Do this by measuring the Z coordinates of both Bregma and Lambda using a 31 G insulin needle attached to the stereotaxic frame.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust the ear bar vertically if necessary.\nPerform for the horizontal positioning of the animal head by following the same procedure of checking the Z coordinates at the midline along with two corresponding locations on the left and right side of the midline and adjust the ear bars if needed.\n\t\tNOTE: A level and stable placement of the animal head is crucial for the reproducibility and reliability of the CCI model.\nUse the same 31 G insulin needle to identify the craniectomy site. Set the XY origin to Bregma and laterally move the needle 3 mm to the right. Mark this position as the site of craniectomy and draw a circle 4 mm in diameter on the skull with a pencil.\nUse a high-speed micro drill with a trephine (4 mm diameter) to cut along the pencil-outlined circle to create a 4 mm diameter open hole. Use a speed setting of 20,000 rpm. Avoid applying excess pressure.",
    "NOTE: Perform this step quickly (usually within 30 s to 1 min) to prevent any thermal damage to the brain. Applying excess pressure while drilling may lead to accidental penetration that could compress and injure the brain surface.\nCarefully remove the bone flap with tweezer and temporally store it in ice cold normal saline. Gently rinse the hole with normal saline before applying pressure on the brain surface with the cotton swab tip to stop bleeding.\nSet the 2.5 mm diameter rounded impactor tip on the CCI device to an angle of 22.5˚. Zero the impact tip to the dural surface. Set the impact parameters on the control box to a velocity of 4 m/s and a deformation depth of 2 mm. Retract the metal tip.\n\tNOTE: Zeroing the tip while it is statically and slightly pressed against the dural surface in the full stroke position improves the accuracy of the zero point and the reproducibility of the injury level.\nDischarge the piston to generate impaction on the brain. Place a sterile cotton swab onto the injured area to stop bleeding.\nPlace the bone flap back to the mouse brain and secure with dental cement. Close the scalp with tissue adhesive (e.g., 3M Vetbond).\n4. Postoperative recovery\nPlace the mouse in a clean recovery cage with bedding under the heat lamp until full recovery.\nProvide moistened chow food and subcutaneously administer ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) for two consecutive days after surgery.\nPerform the above procedures except steps 3.7 and 3.8 for sham control animals.\n5. Mouse euthanasia\nEuthanize mice on the day of study by isoflurane overdose and then decapitation.\n\tNOTE: Several strategies can be used to euthanize the experimental animals prior to the sample collection.\nCollect brain samples for histological analysis.\nSubscription Required.
