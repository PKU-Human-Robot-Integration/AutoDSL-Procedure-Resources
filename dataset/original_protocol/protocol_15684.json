    "All described procedures were authorized by the respective authorities. Animals are maintained following the recommendations in the \"Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" (National Research Council) and in accordance with Public Health Service policy and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Utah, animal protocol (number: 21-11009, Dept. of Pharmacology and Toxicology) and at Freie Universität Berlin (protocol: G0015/21, LAGeSo Berlin, Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology), respectively. The results shown in Figure 3 and Figure 5 were approved under 33.9-42502-04-11/0516 and 33.9-42502-04-15/1892 (LAVES Oldenburg, Dept. of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmacy, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover).\n1. Considerations and preparations for designing the study\nVirus\n\t\nThe Daniel's strain of TMEV was kindly provided by Robert Fujinami from the University of Utah. Originally, it was isolated from a mouse in the Harvard colony20. Look up the specific classification and regulations for biological agents in the respective countries before handling TMEV, and discuss with the institutional biosafety personnel to ensure compliance with regulations. Typically, TMEV is classified as BSL 2, depending on the strain and genetic modifications.The standard dose necessary to induce seizures in a majority of the animals is 3 x 105 plaque-forming units (PFU).\n\t\tNOTE: The dose might have to be adapted, for example, if transgenic mice are used. Overall, titers between 2 x 104 PFU and 2.44 x 107 PFU have been used to successfully induce seizures. Control animals receive sterile PBS and do not experience seizures. The virus does not infect humans; however, PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses) should be worn by experimenters at all times, and mouse carcasses and bedding should be autoclaved before disposal.\nAnimals",
    "For inducing and investigating seizures, use B6J mice, as other mouse strains do not necessarily display seizures, e.g., SJL/J, FVB/N, or Balb/c mice5. There is no difference between female and male mice in acute seizure frequency5. Perform the experiments on adolescent to adult mice (starting at 5-6 weeks of age).\nDiet\n\t\nDiet has been determined as one source of lab-to-lab variability in disease severity; hence, consider the diet as a potential factor for variation22.\nGroup size\n\t\nSince not all animals develop acute or chronic seizures in this model, use about 20 mice/group for compound testing.\nAnimal welfare\n\t\nIf any mouse demonstrates significant adverse effects from the infection or administration of the investigational compound (e.g., lethargy, poor grooming, excessive redness, and purulent discharge from the wound) after an observation time determined by the local IACUC guidelines (e.g., 48 h), euthanize the mouse humanely.\nEuthanize any mouse demonstrating extreme body weight loss (>20%) during the infection period humanely.\nIf animals do not eat properly, give them access to supplemental pellets moistened with pediatric electrolyte solution or similar.\n2. Virus inoculation\nSterilization of the injection syringe\n\t\nRemove the cap of the insulin syringe. Add polyethylene tubing as a collar around the needle to ensure an adequate injection depth of 2.5 mm. Submerge the syringe in ethanol for 30 min. Place the syringe under UV light for 30 min.\nPut the cap back onto the needle. Wrap the syringe in a sterilizing pouch and tape it closed. Label with the date of preparation.\nVirus injection\n\t\nGet aliquots of Daniel's strain of TMEV from the −80 °C freezer. Thaw the virus and keep it on ice. Avoid thawing and re-freezing the virus. Load the syringe with the virus suspension (3 x 105 PFU diluted in 20 µL of PBS or DMEM culture medium).",
    "CAUTION: The virus is infectious to mice but not to humans.\nClean the bench with disinfectant and work under a fume absorber. Virus inoculation is not sterile but is as clean as possible.\nTransfer the mouse into the anesthesia induction chamber, and use 2% isoflurane in oxygen to induce anesthesia. Reaching surgical tolerance takes a few minutes; adjust the concentration based on the animal's breathing and depth of anesthesia.\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse from the anesthesia box under the hood. Check surgical tolerance, e.g., by toe pinch. The whole procedure is performed in less than 30 s, so the animal does not need to be inhaling isoflurane during the injection. Add eye ointment to prevent drying of the cornea. \nClean the head of the animal with an alcohol pad. Tilt the mouse's head slightly to the left so that the injection site is pointing upwards.\nPull the skin a little backward, insert the needle into the head, and inject 20 µL intracortically to a depth of 2.5 mm in the temporal region of the right hemisphere (posterior and medial to the right eye).\nPerform the injection unilaterally in the same hemisphere in all animals. Use the eye and ear as landmarks for the location of the parietal cortex. The placement has been previously verified histologically; see Figure 1. Injection coordinates according to stereotaxic injection in relation to bregma are −2.0 (AP); +3.0 (ML); −1.5 (DV).\nLeave the syringe in place for 5-15 s. Write down if there is any leakage from injection or if air bubbles are seen - in that case, prepare a new syringe. When carefully pulling the syringe out, rotate it slightly. Apply eye ointment to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.",
    "OPTIONAL: Code the animal on the tail or the ear depending on local procedures (optional but easy as the animal is unconscious).\nTransfer the animal to a new cage, which is placed half-on/half-off a heating pad (35-40 °C) during recovery from the anesthesia. Do not leave the animals unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n\t\tNOTE: Animals can be group-housed again after recovery (infected animals are not mixed with mock-infected animals). Infected mice should not be housed in the same room as non-infected mice.\nKeep track of the weight of the mice for the first 7 days pi as they lose weight after infection and might require additional feeding.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63673/63673fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic of TMEV injection procedure.

Compound testing\nCompound preparation\n\t\nReview the formulation instructions. Prepare vehicle solution as per recommendations or provided instructions. As an example, the procedure for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) is presented. LEV reduces seizure burden to 30%-40% of vehicle levels at a dose of 350 mg/kg. The vehicle used in this study is 0.5% methylcellulose.\nCalculate doses depending on the compound. Weigh out the drug according to the calculation. For treating 1 kg of mice, weigh out 350 mg of LEV.",
    "Prepare a stock solution with the appropriate volume of vehicle solution, as directed by the formulation instructions (e.g., sonication, vehicle excipients, etc.). Considering an injection volume of 0.01 mL/g of mouse, the injection volume for 1 kg would be 10 mL with 350 mg of LEV, resulting in a solution of 35 mg/mL19. Report the calculation and the dose in mg/kg and the volume in mL.\n\t\tNOTE: An exemplary protocol can be found on page 2 of Supplementary Material 1.\nCompound administration\n\t\nRandomize cages to the vehicle or compound group. Use mock-infected mice for studies on the mechanisms of epilepsy development or for validation purposes but not for routine drug screening.\nReport environment conditions such as temperature, humidity, time of day, etc.\nVortex the solution with the compound as well as the vehicle solution. Aspirate the vehicle or compound in a syringe and color code the syringes to prevent mix-up.\nWeigh the animals. Ensure that B6J mice are >18 g on day 3 pi (not rounded). Report the weight.\nAdminister the compound (e.g., by intraperitoneal injection or other appropriate routes). Write the time and route of administration.\nMonitor the animals for any behavioral changes after compound administration, especially after the first injections. If seizures occur, report seizure intensity according to the Racine scale23; see step 3.2.\n\t\tNOTE: An exemplary protocol for compound administration can be found in Supplementary Material 1, page 3, while seizures observed during administration would be recorded on Supplementary Material 1, pages 4-5.\nSeizure monitoring of handling-induced seizures\n\t\nPerform this procedure by an experimenter blinded to the treatment. Bring all the cages to the bench. Observe the animals for seizures 2x daily during the light phase.",
    "Score the seizure activity by a modified Racine scale23: 0 = no change in behavior, 1 = mouth and facial movements, 2 = head nodding, 3 = unilateral forelimb clonus, 4 = bilateral forelimb clonus with rearing, 5 = generalized tonic-clonic activity with loss of postural tone, sometimes jumping, 6 = prolonged and excessive jumping and hyperactivity. Report the number and intensity of seizures.\nSlide a pen across the cage to make some noise.\nTransfer each animal to another box and back.\nGently shake the cage using a back-and-forth motion, taking care not to shake the cage so vigorously that animals will hit the sides or the top of the cage and are in danger of sustaining physical injury.\nMonitor all animals in the cage for seizures. At any time, if a mouse has a seizure, transfer it back to the home cage and write down the level of the seizure without further seizure stimulation by noise or handling.\nFor animals that have not seized spontaneously or after gentle cage shaking, trigger seizures by more intense handling: Carefully turn over the mouse by flipping it at its tail from left to right.\n\t\tNOTE: Animals with seizures are hyperexcitable, and can be jumpy.\nObserve each animal for seizure behavior again. Repeat the process for subsequent cages.\n\t\tNOTE: An exemplary protocol for seizure monitoring can be found in Supplementary Material 1, pages 6-7.\nData report on compound effects\n\t\nAnalyze the daily body weights using repeated measures (RM) ANOVA.",
    "Use the daily cumulative seizure burden values for a graphical representation of the data. Present the efficacy data (number of animals with no Racine stage 3-5 seizures) as the number protected/the number tested in each respective group (usually N = 20). Therefore, compare the data between the vehicle- and drug-treated groups for responses (seizing or non-seizing) using a Fisher's exact test.\n\t\tNOTE: An animal is considered \"protected\" from seizures if having a seizure of stage 2 or less and non-protected animals have seizures of stages 3-5.\nAnalyze the tolerability data similarly, as the number of animals with behavioral impairments or toxic effects/the number tested in each group. Note any adverse effects, including deaths.\nIf less than 50% of the mice injected with the vehicle seize acutely, do not consider the data."
