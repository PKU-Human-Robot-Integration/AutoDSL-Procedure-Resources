    "Wipe the working area with ethanol and alcohol/flame sterilize the spatula.   Wipe the laminar flow hood and alcohol/flame sterilize the forceps and the lancets. All steps must be carried out under laminar flow hood.   Fill about 25 mg of Serapias vomeracea seeds for each 2.0 ml centrifuge tube, being careful to bring down all the seeds to the bottom of the centrifuge tube. For this purpose, centrifuge all the tubes at maximum speed with their lids open for 1 min. Make sure not to leave any remains of seeds on the cap edge; these seeds will not be sterilized and may contaminate those sterilized.    Sterilize seeds adding 1 ml of sterilizing solution for each tube and start immediately the timer; mix well and place on vortex for 18 min.    After this, centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min and, quickly replace Sterilizing solution with 1 ml of sterile deionized water. Incubate for 5 min and repeat this washing step three times. To avoid collecting seeds in the tip while change washing water, briefly centrifuge to bring down all the seeds to the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Note: Steps 4 and 5 must be completed within 20 min.   Using sterile forceps, spread 4-10 squares of Whatman No.1 filter paper (10 x 10 mm) spaced equally on a petri dish filled with 25 ml of Solid oat medium as shown in the Figure 1. Gently place the seeds spread out on the filter paper squares using pipette and filter tips. Normally it is recommended to prepare from 10 to 20 petri dishes.  Note: each filter piece of paper will be a replicate and the number of squares indicated above is the minimum and the maximum to use in a single petri dish, as how many replicates you need.",
    "Inoculate each petri dish with Tulasnella calospora (AL13/D strain). Inoculum consist of a 3 x 3 mm portion of actively growing mycelium (from pure culture on MEA medium) cut with sterile lancets from the petri dish of the fungal pure culture, placed in the center of capsule using sterile lancets (Figure 1). Control plates were left uninoculated.   Seal petri dishes with Parafilm and aluminum sheet (to ensure darkness) and place in a climatic chamber at stable temperature of 20 °C (Figure 2).   Seeds are considerable to be germinated when protocorms developed from imbibed seeds after 15-30 days. After this time, well developed protocorms, start to grow in plantlets with leaves. Well-developed plantlets may be exposed at light with photoperiod of 16 h of light (20-25 °C) and 8 h of dark (18-20 °C) (Figure 3)."
