    "1. Plating Cells for the VCCC\nCulture large 225 cm2 flasks of EC and SMC under sterile conditions at 37 °C, until 70-90% confluent. Ensure that more EC than SMC are used; if using primary human EC and SMC, typically 3 large flasks of EC to 1 large flask of SMC.\nUse primary cells at lower passages and do not use past passage 10. Choose the culture media based upon cells to be co-cultured. For primary human coronary artery EC, use EBM-2 EC basal media with EGM2 MV growth factors. For primary human coronary SMC, use SmBM SMC basal media with SmGM-2 growth factors. Prior to use with cultured cells, add growth factors to the media.\nConstruction of the VCCC Day 1: Spray large (150 mm) Petri dishes and lids with disinfectant (e.g., Cavicide) and wipe away with a paper towel or lint-free wipes. Then spray the Petri dishes with 70% ethanol (EtOH) and place them in the hood to air dry.\nOpen the plate of filter inserts (see the Table of Materials) under sterile conditions, and coat the SMC side (bottom side of filter) of the insert with fibronectin solution. Keeping the insert in the provided 6-well plate, pipet the fibronectin solution through the side slits to the bottom of the plate, making sure that the bottom half of the filter is covered (no more than 1 mL).",
    "After 30 min of treatment with fibronectin solution at room temperature in the cell culture hood, take inserts out of the plate, vacuum any excess solution, and invert, placing into the bottom half of the clean Petri dish. Set aside. Be sure not to disturb the filter insert membrane when suctioning excess solution; this can be avoided by gently tilting the plate, and vacuuming the solution off the edge of the insert.\nTrypsinize a 225 cm2 flask of SMC with 3 mL of pre-warmed 2X Trypsin-EDTA solution, and once the cells have lifted off the plate, add 9 mL SMC media to neutralize the trypsin (3:1, media:trypsin). Transfer to a conical tube, mix well, and pipet 10 µL onto a hemocytometer to determine cell number.\nCount the number of cells in 5 x 5 boxes (i.e., 18), multiply this by 10,000 to get the number of cells in 1 mL (180,000). Then multiply by 12 mL (total volume of cell suspension, 2.16 million SMC). Ensure that there are enough SMC to plate the desired number of wells.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, 1 well should have 75,000 SMC and thus 18 wells would have 1.35 million total SMC. Divide 1.35 million cells needed by 180,000 cells per 1 mL and this results in 7.5 mL of the cell suspension that will be needed for plating. Then calculate the final volume needed (18 wells x 750 µL = 13.5 mL). Thus, take 7.5 mL of cell suspension, bring the volume up to 13.5 mL with pre-warmed SMC media, and mix well.",
    "Plate 750 µL of the cell suspension containing approximately 75,000 SMC onto the bottom side of each filter, being careful to not spill any of the media and cell solution. Place the lid on top and carefully transfer the Petri dish with the inserts into the incubator at 37 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: The optimum cell density for other cell types will need to be empirically determined.\nOn day 2, fill clean 6-well dishes with 2 mL of fresh, pre-warmed SMC media. Remove the plates from the incubator. Take the inserts out one at a time and remove the media by suction, then place into the 6-well dish with SMC media.\nCoat the opposite side of the filter (EC side) with 1 mL of a 0.5% bovine gelatin solution for at least 30 min at 37 °C.\nTrypsinize the 225 cm2 flask(s) of EC with 3 mL of pre-warmed 2X Trypsin-EDTA (10x diluted in sterile Dulbecco's PBS) solution, with gentle tapping of the flask in order to lift the cells off the plate.\n\tNOTE: It may be necessary to place the flask back into the incubator at 37 °C for 1-3 min.\n\t\nOnce the cells have lifted off the plate, add 9 mL EC media to neutralize the trypsin (3:1). Transfer to a conical tube, pool together, mix well, and pipet 10 µL onto a hemocytometer to determine cell number.\n\t\t\nCount the number of cells in 5 x 5 boxes (i.e., 60), multiply this by 10,000 to get the number of cells in 1 mL (600,000). Then multiply by 12 mL (total volume of cell suspension, 7.2 million EC). Ensure that there are enough EC to plate the desired number of wells.",
    "NOTE: Approximately 360,000 EC are required per well. For example, 18 wells require 6.48 million EC. Divide 6.48 million cells needed by 600,000 EC per 1 mL and this results in 10.8 mL of the cell suspension that will be needed for plating. Then calculate the final volume needed (18 wells x 1 mL = 18 mL). Thus, take 10.8 mL of cell suspension, bring the volume up to 18 mL with pre-warmed EC media, and gently resuspend.\nPlate 1 mL of 360,000 EC onto the top side of each insert filter. Let the cells incubate undisturbed at 37 °C for 24 h. Replace medium on Day 4. Harvest on Day 5.\n2. Harvesting Fractions from the VCCC\nPerform the isolation in a 4 °C room and keep all instruments on ice.\nKeep in mind the number of individual inserts being isolated and add lysis buffer to a 50 mL tube labeled MEJ (for the isolated filters). Then label two 10 mm dishes; one for EC and one for SMC.\nAdjust the volume of lysis buffer depending on how concentrated the lysate needs to be; for 15 inserts, 500 µL of lysis buffer for the MEJ tube and 250 µL per Petri dish is recommended.\nWork with one 6-well plate of inserts at a time. Suction off the medium in the cell culture hood and then transport to a cold room on ice.\n\tNOTE: The following instructions are for 1 insert isolation.\nPipet 10 µL of 1x PBS onto the SMC side of the insert.\nUse the cell lifter to scrape down the cells to one end of the insert, and transfer the cells from the lifter to the SMC Petri dish that has lysis buffer in it.",
    "Once the cell lifter has touched the lysis buffer in the dish, do not allow it to touch the insert filter until it has been completely wiped and dried off on paper towels. Repeat the scraping of the SMC filter at least one to two times to fully remove the remaining SMC cell debris.\nTurn the insert over and pipet 10 µL of 1x PBS into the upper/EC side of the insert filter. Repeat steps 2.6 and 2.7 with a cell scraper and the EC Petri dish.\nCollect the remaining cell and PBS slurry from the EC side of the filter with a pipette and transfer to the EC Petri dish with lysis buffer. Be very thorough in scraping the cells off both sides of the filter as to leave minimal EC/SMC contamination in the MEJ fraction.\nCarefully use the scalpel to cut out the filter from the plastic insert. Do this by cutting 70-80% of it away from the plastic and use forceps to pull the filter completely off the plastic insert structure. Put the filter in the 50 mL conical tube labeled MEJ with lysis buffer, and ensure it sits in the lysis buffer and remains wet.\nRepeat the isolation steps, in groups of 6, until all of the inserts have been processed.\nEnsure that different treatment groups are kept in separate tubes and dishes.\nVortex the 50 mL MEJ conical tube on full strength for 15 s or until mixed well. Remove the filters from the MEJ conical with forceps, dragging them along the side walls of the tube as to leave the maximum amount of proteins and liquid in the tube. After this point, discard the filters.",
    "Once all the filters have been removed from the MEJ conical tube, do a quick spin (10-15 s at max speed ~16,000 x g) in a centrifuge to pull all the liquid and proteins to the bottom of the tube. Transfer the contents of the MEJ tube and the EC and SMC Petri dishes into separate, smaller centrifuge tubes.\nOptional: Sonicate the contents of the MEJ/SMC/EC tubes on setting 4 for three 10 s pulses on ice or homogenize gently by hand.\nCentrifuge at max speed (~16,000 x g) 15 min at 4 °C. Pipet out the supernatant and assay the lysate for protein content using the bicinchoninic assay method.\n3. Harvesting the VCCC for  En Face Immunofluorescence\nOn Day 5 of VCCC incubation, remove the inserts from the incubator. Working in the cell culture hood, suction off the SMC media from each of the lower wells of the insert filter and rinse two times with 1x PBS. Repeat with the EC side.\nKeeping the inserts intact and in the plate, add 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10-20 min in a walk-in 4 °C room on a gentle shaker. Wash both sides of the insert filter with 1x PBS for 5 min and repeat two times.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic and must be handled carefully.\nPerform the blocking, primary and secondary antibody incubations in the plate, ensuring that both sides of the filter are kept in the antibody + blocking solution (9 mL PBS, 25 µL Triton X100, 50 mg bovine serum albumin, 500 µL normal serum)\nTo mount the filter on a slide, cut the filter out of the plastic insert with a scalpel mounted on a handle and place on a microscope slide with mounting medium.\n4. Harvesting the VCCC for Transverse Immunofluorescence",
    "On Day 5 of VCCC incubation, remove the inserts from the incubator. Suction off the media from both sides of the insert filter in the cell culture hood and rinse each side of the filter two times with 1x PBS.\nKeeping the inserts intact and in the 6-well plate, add 4% PFA and incubate overnight in a walk-in 4 °C room on a gentle shaker.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic and must be handled carefully.\n5. Embedding the VCCC for Transverse Immunofluorescence\nAfter filter inserts have been fixed approximately for 24 h in 4% PFA, transfer to 70% EtOH for at least 24 h, but up to several weeks.\nProcess the filters on a long (overnight) run on an automated tissue processor. Use the program as follows: 70% EtOH for 30 min, 85% EtOH 30 min, 95% EtOH 30 min, 100% EtOH 30 min, 100% EtOH 45 min, 100% EtOH 45 min, Xylene 30 min, Xylene 30 min, Xylene 45 min, 60 °C paraffin 30 min, 60 °C paraffin 30 min, 60 °C paraffin 45 min.\nAfter processing, transfer the harvested filters to the embedding station into liquid paraffin, keeping the filter in the cassette.\nRemove the filter from the cassette, carefully using forceps to hold it just at the edge. With scissors, cut the filter in half, forming two semi-circular shaped halves. Lay each of the 2 halves on the cold plate portion of the embedding station just long enough to fill the embedding mold with liquid paraffin.\nOnce filled with liquid paraffin, very briefly touch the embedding mold to the cold plate, then embed each half of the filter into embedding mold (cut side down); this ensures that during sectioning, one will be cutting from the center of the filter towards the edge.",
    "During embedding, use forceps to hold the filter in place to prevent the halves from falling into each other until the paraffin is cool enough for them to stand alone. Move the embedding mold to a cold plate until completely solidified.\n\tNOTE: Cooling blocks on ice trays helps to prevent wrinkled sections.\n6. Sectioning and Staining the VCCC for Transverse Immunofluorescence\nFor the paraffin blocks sectioning and slide mounting: cut 5 µm sections, place the sections into a 42 °C water bath, and pick up the sections using positively charged slides. Then keep slides overnight in a 42 °C oven to dry.\nBefore beginning the rehydration steps, bake the slides at 60 °C to melt the paraffin and help adhere the VCCC sections to the slide. Cool briefly, then rehydrate the slides through two changes of xylene, 100% EtOH, 95% EtOH, one change of 70% EtOH, and two changes of distilled water.\nAvoid antigen retrieval methods that involve microwaving or heating as sections may fall off the slide.\nPerform the standard blocking for 1 h at room temperature, then the overnight incubation with the primary antibody at 4 °C, followed by washing steps and secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Mount with the mounting media and coverslip.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
