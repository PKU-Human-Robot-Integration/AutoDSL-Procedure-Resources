    "Research with human participants was performed in compliance with institutional guidelines at the University of Texas Health Science Center and Stony Brook University, with informed consent obtained from participants for these studies and use of their data.\n1. Setup of MRI scanner and imaging protocols\nFor fMRI, use a 3T MRI scanner with multi-channel receiver head coils. Different field strengths can also be used but may present difficulties with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or distortion artifacts, so adjust accordingly. Use only the posterior half of the head coil for fMRI to allow for a larger viewing angle unobstructed by the anterior half of the coil.\nSet up a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 2.2 s, echo time (TE) of 2.8 ms, field of view (FOV) of 176 mm x 256 mm x 208 mm, spatial resolution of 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm, bandwidth of 190 Hz/pixel, flip angle of 13°, and a scan duration of 3.1 min3.\nSet up a gradient-echo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with a TR of 2 s, TE of 30 ms, FOV of 220 mm x 220 mm, in-plane resolution of 1.7 mm x 1.7 mm, 29 slices with a thickness of 3 mm, and a bandwidth of 1,500 Hz/pixel3.\nMeasure the dimensions of the head coil and scanner bore, and then construct a simple frame by cutting a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe into suitable lengths and connecting them with PVC elbows. Obtain a mirror that is at least 25 cm wide and 15 cm tall and attach it to a plastic rod with screws (small holes can be drilled into the mirror).",
    "Attach the ends of the plastic rod to the PVC frame with nylon screws (Figure 1A). Make sure that the nylon screws are slightly loose to allow the mirror to be rotated by hand to optimize the angle for each participant.\nMake a screen to go inside the MRI bore. Cut a segment of a rear-projection screen that is approximately the size of the MRI bore. Construct a frame that is the size of the bore and attach the screen to the frame with screws. Place the screen inside the scanner just behind the head coil to minimize the distance between the screen and mirror and maximize the FOV.\n\tNOTE: If the scanner bore is large enough, a single screen can be used for the participant to view directly instead of the mirror and rear projection screen setup. A projection screen attached to a thin sheet of wood for backing or a sheet of thin matte white plastic can be used as a screen and placed on the frame instead of a mirror. The projector should then be positioned and focused, such that it fills the screen and is in focus.\n2. Participant preparation\nInform the participant about the procedure, risks, and benefits of the fMRI scan. Obtain their informed consent.\nEnsure that the participant does not have any contraindications to MRI. This includes screening for pacemakers, metal implants, or claustrophobia. If you have any uncertainty, consult with a qualified radiologist or researcher, and exclude the participant from the study if any uncertainty remains.\nExplain the visual stimulation protocol and the need for the participants to fixate on the central cross during the fMRI scans. Show the participant a short demonstration of the visual stimulation for instructional purposes to familiarize them with the procedure.",
    "Carefully position the participant on the table of the MRI scanner to ensure that they are comfortable and relaxed. Provide earplugs and/or a sound-dampening headset to reduce the acoustic noise the participant will hear to protect their hearing.\nImmobilize the participant's head in the posterior half of the head coil array, using foam padding on the sides of the head to ensure that the head is properly immobilized to reduce motion artifacts. Use the scanner's positioning system and move the table into the scanner bore.\nPlace the wide-view screen or mirror 10 cm from the patient's eyes (Figure 1B). Place the bore-sized screen from the back of the scanner bore just behind the head coil. Adjust the position and angle of the mirror/screen for each participant to achieve a consistent viewing angle.\nEnsure that the participant is comfortable throughout the scan via communication through the intercom.\n3. fMRI scanning of participant\nRun a localizer scan with three orthogonal planes and scanner adjustments and calibrations for frequency adjustment and shimming.\nRun an MP-RAGE anatomical scan to help position the EPI slices.\nCreate visual stimuli, as described in the following steps, using a program for running behavioral or psychological experiments.\nAt the start of the fMRI protocol, instruct the participant to fixate on the white cross (3° x 3°), which should be on top of a gray background at the center of the stimuli for 10 s.\n\tNOTE: The white cross will be shown before and after each visual stimulation paradigm for 10 s. Thus, the total fMRI stimulation test for each paradigm is 200 s.",
    "Present the first visual stimulation paradigm (a series of rotating wedges) for a period of 30 s (giving an angular velocity of 6°/s) and cycle through six periods. The wedge stimuli should include 12 frames of rotating wedges (one scan with clockwise rotation and one with counterclockwise), extending to the edge of the screen/mirror (>100° visual field), with an 8 Hz contrast-reversing black and white (100% contrast) checkerboard pattern (Figure 2A).\nPresent the white cross once again for 10 s.\nRepeat steps 3.4-3.6 with the second visual stimulation paradigm (a series of expanding and contracting rings) for a period of 30 s (expanding or contracting at 1.8°/s of the visual field) and cycle through six periods. The ring stimuli should include eight frames of expanding or contracting rings (>100° visual field), with an 8 Hz contrast-reversing black and white (100% contrast) checkerboard pattern (Figure 2B).\nAfter completing the fMRI, move the table out of the scanner bore while instructing the participant to remain still. Remove the mirror/screen, place the anterior portion of the head coil in addition to the posterior, and move the table back into the center of the scanner.\nAcquire a quick localizer scan in case of any movement and acquire an MP-RAGE scan with the full head coil.\n\tNOTE: An anatomical image with the whole head coil is needed for accurate registration for group analyses and reconstruction purposes.\n4. Analysis of retinotopic fMRI data\nDownload and install the FreeSurfer application for MRI analysis (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu)20.\n\tNOTE: FreeSurfer version 5.3.0 was used herein.\nObtain images in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format from the MRI scanner. Convert the DICOM files to nifti format using the dcm2niix application (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl)21.",
    "Process the T1-weighted scan to provide a cortical surface reference, as described in the following two steps. Use FreeSurfer to convert structural data from nifti format to .mgz format (mri_convert command).\nUse the recon-all command in a shell environment to perform automated segmentation and cortical reconstruction of the structural data.\n\tNOTE: This step can take over 20 h to complete.\nUse the graphical user interface tksurfer to view the inflated hemisphere and virtually cut the visual cortex along the calcarine fissure, and select the occipital lobe. Use the mris_flatten command to flatten the visual cortex patch. Repeat this step for both hemispheres.\nFor the fMRI data, first remove the rest periods, with only the fixation cross presented, from the start and end of the data. Screen the fMRI data for artifacts or large movements.\nPreprocess the functional data for spatial smoothing and motion correction. Model the retinotopic stimulus paradigm and apply a canonical hemodynamic response function to construct the response function.\nPerform retinotopic phase-encoded analysis of the fMRI data using the FreeSurfer functional analysis stream (mkanalysis-sess, selxavg3-sess, and fieldsign-sess commands) to correlate the BOLD fMRI time series with a modeled response function and obtain phase-encoded retinotopic maps, with a significance level of p < 0.01 (Figure 3).\nVisualize the results of the retinotopic maps with color-coded activation maps overlaid on the virtually flattened visual cortex using the tksurfer-sess command, and display using the rtview command.\nUse the phase-encoded retinotopic maps from the wedge stimuli to help define the boundaries of the primary visual cortex (V1) and other extra striate areas (V2 and V3) by field sign maps (Figure 3A), along with anatomical landmarks and FreeSurfer atlases.",
    "To calculate the BOLD response at different eccentricities, first use FSL Feat (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) to calculate statistical maps using a general linear model for each size of ring stimuli with a z-score threshold of Z > 2.322,23. If group analysis is being performed, calculate the second level analysis for statistical maps of group differences with FSL Feat to help determine the BOLD response at different eccentricities.\nCo-register the fMRI images onto the reconstructed cortical surface using the FreeSurfer bbregister and tkregister2 commands to align the participant's fMRI data to the anatomical structural image of their brain and ensure accurate spatial alignment.\nGroup the ring stimuli by eccentricity for each of the eight frames. Manually draw regions of interest for different eccentricities based on the activated voxel regions for each frame. Take the BOLD percent changes and plot them as a function of eccentricity. Also, bin the eccentricity data into central (< ±12°) and peripheral (> ±12°) regions, where a ±12° visual stimulus is typical for retinotopic fMRI studies.\nSubscription Required.
