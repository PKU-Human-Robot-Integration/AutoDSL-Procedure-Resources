  "procedures": [
    "Procedures were carried out in accordance with the Local Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments in Olsztyn, Poland.\n1.Equipment Preparation\nUse a syringe and needle for injection of the gas into the fish body cavity.\nSet the gas pressure at 0.5 bar, and maintain this pressure to be below 1 bar throughout.\nControl the air flow. For the salmonid fish, 1.5 L/min is the most efficient speed of gas exhaustion. Maintain the optimum speed because higher speed might not obtain all the eggs while a slower speed might unnecessarily prolong the procedure.\nConnect the syringe with a screwed needle (0.8-1.2 mm diameter) to avoid needle detachment caused by the gas pressure.\n2. Air Spawning\nAnesthetize the fish with 0.2% Propiscin. Place the fish into a water bath with the 0.2% Propiscin and wait until the fish becomes unresponsive.\nCarefully dry out before spawning by wiping with a dry cotton cloth.\nPlace the fish on the slant bed about 35-40Â°, on her side tail side down. With a gentle push of fish abdomen, check the egg flow from the genital tract. If the eggs are not present, the fish should not be spawned.\nPlace a container covered with mesh below the fish papilla to collect the eggs.\nQuickly insert the needle below the abdominal fins.\nFreely remove the eggs by the gas until only singular eggs are removed from the fish body.\nGently massage the abdomen to remove excess gas from the fish body.\nAfter spawning, gently transfer the fish to a tank with water flow. Fish released to tank after air spawning might initially swim on the surface of the water. After several minutes the fish releases the remaining gas while swimming and starts swimming normally.",
