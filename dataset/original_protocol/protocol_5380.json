    "Notes: Perform Procedures A and B using aseptic technique in a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet.For Transwells, the upper chamber volume is 0.5 ml; the lower chamber volume is 1 ml.The volume of any solution added to membrane cut-out is 50 µl. Seed cellsStarting with a 10 cm dish of MDCK cells in culture, aspirate complete media (see Recipes) and add 10 ml of DPBS without calcium or magnesium. Aspirate DPBS and add 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, place in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 5 min occasionally tapping dish to dislodge cells.Add 9 ml of complete medium to dislodged cells in plate. Using a 10 ml serological pipette, pipette the cell suspension multiple times to detach the cells from each other.Use a hemocytometer to count the single-cell cell suspension.Dilute the cell suspension to a concentration of 50,000 cells/ml in complete media. Add 0.5 ml of cell dilution to the upper chamber of Transwell.Add 1 ml of complete media to the lower chamber of Transwell. Next day, change media to serum-free media (see Recipes) in the upper chamber. Keep complete media (serum-replete) in the lower chamber.After four days, add serum-free media containing doxycycline to the upper chamber and add complete media containing doxycycline to the lower chamber (dilute doxycycline stock solution [see Recipes] 1:20,000 to 50 ng/ml); incubate overnight.Antibody feedingReplace media on Transwells with ice-cold MEM ETC (see Recipes) and keep on ice.Add ice-cold MEM ETC containing anti-c-Myc antibody (see Recipes) to wells of a new 12-well plate and place on ice.Transfer each Transwell insert containing your cells to the new 12-well plate containing antibody on ice. Incubate on ice in the cold room for 20 min with gentle shaking.Remove plate from the cold room and aspirate antibody media from the lower chamber.",
    "Wash lower chambers with ice-cold MEM ETC three times for 5 min on ice in cold room with gentle shaking.Transfer each Transwell insert to a new 12-well plate containing pre-warmed MEM ETC in each well. Replace apical media with pre-warmed MEM ETC. Move to a 37 °C incubator.Incubate wells for the desired time, remove from the incubator, place in a new 12-well plate containing ice-cold MEM ETC, and store on ice until all time points are completed.Wash one time with ice-cold MEM ETC for 5 min on ice in cold room with gentle shaking. Remove media.Add 4% buffered formalin solution to upper and lower chambers; incubate at room temperature for 15 min with gentle shaking.Aspirate formalin and add quench solution (see Recipes) to both chambers and incubate at room temperature for 10 min with gentle shaking.Aspirate quench solution and wash both chambers with PBS three times.Add block and permeabilization buffer (see Recipes) to both chambers and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Primary antibody (M6PR antibody) incubationAspirate blocking buffer, remove Transwell inserts from the plate, and place upside-down (apical side facing downward) on bench top.Use a new razor blade to cut three sides of a rectangle in the Transwell membrane.Gently grab the square membrane with forceps and cut the rectangle from the Transwell support using surgical scissors. Clip a small piece from the upper right corner to be able to keep track of which side the cells are on. (Video 1)    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Demonstration of the procedure to cut out the Transwell membrane using a razor blade. The lid of the multiwall dish is covered with Parafilm and used as a support surface.                                                      Place the membrane cut-out, cell side up, onto a sheet of Parafilm placed in a lid of a 12-well plate with each well labeled.",
    "Gently add 50 µl of primary antibody solution (see Recipes) on top of membrane cut-out.Place samples in a plastic pencil box lined with damp paper towels to create a humid chamber and incubate overnight in the cold room.Secondary antibody incubationAspirate primary antibody solution, transfer membranes to a new 12-well plate, and wash four times each for 5 min with washing solution (see Recipes).Add secondary antibody solution (see Recipes) to membranes, incubate at 37 °C in the humid chamber for 1 h.Aspirate secondary antibody solution and wash three times 5 min with washing solution.Wash once with PBS.Aspirate PBS, and post-fix by adding 4% buffered formalin solution, and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.Aspirate formalin, wash one time with PBS quickly, and another time for 5 min.Aspirate PBS, use forceps to dip membrane in ddH2O for 1 sec. Remove from ddH2O, wick water away by gently touching membrane to a Kimwipe, and place on microscope slide cell-side up. Keep membrane flat the entire time preventing it from folding back on itself.Add a drop of mounting medium (Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent plus DAPI) to each membrane.Gently add rectangular coverslip to membranes avoiding air bubbles.Store slides in the dark at room temperature for 48 h to harden mounting media."
