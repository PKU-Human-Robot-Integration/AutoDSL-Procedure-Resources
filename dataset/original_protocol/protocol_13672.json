The script will identify and display all the valid crests and troughs for manual review.",
    "NOTE: A certain crest or trough can be reselected manually in the corresponding drop-down list if the script incorrectly identifies it. Based on these crests and troughs, the average values of amplitudes and velocities along three axes of each tracking point and the operating time of lifting, thrusting, twirling left, and twirling right actions can be calculated and displayed by the script. The calculation method of these parameters is shown in Figure 3.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
