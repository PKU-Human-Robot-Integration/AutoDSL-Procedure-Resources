    "**Cell Culture** \nUse standard culture protocols for maintenance of cells. For adherent cells, seed on sterile coverslips for 24-48 hours. For non-adherent cells, cells can be fixed in suspension and attached to poly-l-lysine coated coverslips before antibody staining.\nFor this protocol we used the adherent cell line PNT2 grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells / mL in 6 well plates and cultured for 48 hours. \n**Fixation** \nWe recommend fixing with paraformaldehyde. Cold methanol fixation can be used, however this may reduce ER staining intensity. \n1. Fix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 for 10 minutes at room temperature.\n  2. Wash cells three times with PBS for five minutes each at room temperature.\n  \n**Permeabilisation**\n1. Incubate the samples for 15-25 minutes with 0.5% w/v saponin in PBS at room temperature. \n  2. Wash cells three times with PBS for five minutes each at room temperature.\n  \n**Blocking** \n1. Incubate cells with 1% BSA, in PBST \\(PBS+ 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature to block non-specific binding of the antibodies \n  \n**Antibody staining**\n1. Prepare primary antibody to required concentration in 1% BSA in PBST. For this example we use rabbit anti-Cytochrome-C \\(Abcam ab90529 0.6m/mL) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml \\(for localisation to mitochondria). \n  2. Incubate cells in the diluted primary antibody for one hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. \n  3. Remove primary antibody and wash the cells three times in PBS for five minutes each.\n  4. Prepare secondary antibody to required concentration in 1% BSA in PBST. For this example we used goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 at a 1/1000 dilution.*\n  5. Incubate cells with the secondary antibody for one hour at room temperature in the dark.",
    "6. Aspirate the secondary antibody and wash cells three times with PBS for five minutes each.\n  * CAUTION for best results select a secondary antibody with a fluorophore which is compatible with ReZolve-ER \\(ex. UV or 400 nm, em. 570 nm). We recommend a far-red fluorophore such as Alexa Flour 647. Whichever fluorophore you select ensure that it is not excited at UV or 400 nm excitation. \n  \n**Endoplasmic Reticulum Staining**\n1. Prepare 10 mM stock solutions of ReZolve-ER by dissolving the powder in DMSO as instructed on the vial.\n  2. Prepare a staining solution by diluting the stock in PBS to 20 μM \\(1/500 dilution).\n  3. Incubate cells with staining solution for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark.\n  4. Remove coverslips from the staining solution and mount in aqueous mounting media. For best results ensure some of the staining solution is transferred into the mounting media.*\n  * CAUTION do not wash coverslips after ReZolve-ER staining. Washing will significantly reduce the fluorescence obtained from the staining.\n  \n**Mounting and Imaging**\n1. Once mounted adhere coverslips to the slide using quick-dry nail polish.\n  2. For best results, imaging by confocal microscopy is recommended. \n  3. For excitation of ReZolve-ER a UV, 385 nm or 400 nm light source can be utilized. For detection, a detector compatible with FITC is most appropriate, or if available a tuneable detector set to a detection range of 525 nm - 600 nm.\n  4. For antibody imaging use appropriate settings for the selected secondary antibody. For this example we have used a 647 nm excitation and a detector compatible with far-red fluorophores. \n  5. To avoid signal bleed through, sequential imaging is recommended."
