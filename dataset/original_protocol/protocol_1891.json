Outline of the overall procedure and the respective steps and options\nDepending on the final purpose and analysis goals, fetal/newborn and juvenile/adult samples can be processed for cryo- versus gelatin-embedding, and sectioned into thin slices versus thick specimens. See text for details on these options. Bottom right, confocal image examples, reprinted with permission from (Mesnieres et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Scale bars, 100 µm.\nDissection and processing of mouse limbs\nTiming: 2–16 days (2 days for dissection and fixation of all sample types; add an additional 2 days for decalcification of fetal/newborn samples, and 14 days for decalcification of adult bones).\nEmbryonic and newborn tissue sampling, fixation, and decalcification\nThe day or hours before the dissection, prepare fresh 2% PFA in PBS for tissue fixation and store the solution at 4°C (see ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section).\nDissection of embryonic and newborn mouse limbs\nFor embryo isolation, euthanize the pregnant dam at embryonic day E18.5 or the desired fetal age, determined from the day of conception, with E0.5 being the morning the copulation plug was observed, by CO2 inhalation in a glass desiccator designated for this purpose, filling the lower chamber with CO2 ice.",
    "Position the pregnant female mouse belly upwards and spray the surface of the abdomen region with 70% ethanol. Open the abdomen using scissors and tweezers to make an incision in the fur and skin initially, and next reach the peritoneal cavity by cutting the peritoneal membrane. Pull out the uterus using forceps, lifting the uterine horn at the ovarian side out of the abdominal cavity, and cutting at the level of the cervix. Place the uterus into a pre-filled petri dish with PBS solution and clean the uterus from the mesometrium membrane.\nIsolate the embryos by cutting the uterine horns and liberating the embryos from the embryonic sac using forceps, removing the extraembryonic tissues and organs. Cut the umbilical blood vessels to remove the placenta and euthanize the embryos according to the local guidelines, adhering to the legislation and ethical regulations provided by the relevant authorities at your institution.\nImmerse the isolated embryos in clean PBS in a second petri dish.\nFor newborn bone harvesting, sacrifice the pups by the appropriate prescribed method, rinse with PBS, and immerse in clean PBS in a second petri dish.\nNote: Useful resources and videos detailing these steps can be found on Jove.com[href=http://Jove.com] (e.g., see https://doi.org/10.3791/59509-v and https://doi.org/10.3791/54978[href=https://doi.org/10.3791/54978]) and on the internet / Youtube).\nDissect embryonic and newborn mouse limbs in a clean petri dish with PBS using a stereoscopic microscope, small scissors, and a pair of fine tweezers; delicately separate the limbs from the mouse embryo, avoiding putting pressure or damaging the sample. Remove the skin and excess soft tissue / muscles to facilitate optimal penetration of the fixating solution into the bones.\nFixation\nCollect limbs and fix for 12–16 h at 4°C in 2% PFA (prepared in PBS) solution.",
    "Note: Ensure the width of the tube and the volume of fixative is sufficient to fully immerse and expose the sample to the fixative. Always use freshly prepared PFA for this protocol.\nAfter fixation, take off the PFA solution and wash the sample with PBS 3 × 5 min.\nDecalcification\nDecalcify perinatal bones (E18.5 to P2 samples) in 0.5 M EDTA for 2 days at 4°C with mild agitation and daily renewed EDTA solution.\nNote: Decalcification is normally not necessary for fetal mouse bones before the stage of E18.5, given the limited mineralization of the developing skeleton by then.\nWash samples 3 × 5 min in PBS at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) with mild agitation.\nAdult mouse bone dissection, fixation, and decalcification\nEuthanize adult mice by CO2 inhalation in a glass desiccator designated for this purpose, filling the low chamber with CO2 ice.\nSpray limbs with 70% ethanol, cut and retract the skin from the legs, remove muscles using scissors and tweezers, and collect the bones of interest. For tibia and femur: remove the foot by cutting at the ankle using scissors, and separate the tibia and femur from each other by carefully cutting the soft tissues / ligaments in between the bones at the level of the knee.\nTissue fixation: Fix samples 12–16 h using freshly prepared 4% PFA in PBS at 4°C.\nNote: Ensure the width of the tube and the volume of fixative is sufficient to fully immerse and expose the sample. Always use freshly prepared PFA for this protocol.\nWash samples 3 × 20 min with PBS at 20°C–22°C with constant agitation.\nDecalcification: Decalcify juvenile and adult samples in 0.5 M EDTA for 2 weeks in constant agitation at 4°C, changing the EDTA solution weekly.",
    "Note: Shorter decalcification periods may be sufficient to obtain high-quality sections; our recommendation is to test and adjust it on a sample batch-specific basis.\nWash samples 3 × 20 min with PBS at 20°C–22°C with constant agitation and proceed with embedding protocol.\nPreparation of histological specimens: Tissue embedding\nTiming: 2 days\nWe describe two embedding protocols, gelatin-embedding and cryo-embedding, which are each optimal for specific final imaging purposes and analysis goals. Briefly, for 3D analysis it is better to use gelatin-embedding, because the section thickness limit is larger. To perform 2D analyses, cryo-embedding is better. More specifically: Gelatin-embedding, based on (Caire et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), allows for the bone samples to be sectioned (using a regular cryostat, see step 5 on ‘Preparation of histological specimens: tissue sectioning[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3]’ below) at a thickness of the resulting specimens ranging from 50 up to 300 μm. This choice of processing is ideal when the main aim is to perform deep tissue imaging for 3D analysis, requiring thick sections. Of note, thin sections, if desired, can also be generated from the gelatin blocks (for instance, generating some thick and some thin sections from the same block), but the quality may not be optimal and the lower limit for the sections’ thickness in our hands was around 10–12 μm.\nIf thinner sections of high quality are the priority (e.g., 5 μm), for instance, when high-resolution 2D image analysis is aimed for, we recommend performing cryo-embedding, because thin cryosections of bone can be generated with optimal preservation of the tissue integrity. Thick sectioning is also possible from cryo-embedded bone samples, but in our hands the maximum thickness achieved with this method, without jeopardizing tissue integrity, was 50 μm. This still allows for 2D analysis of confocal images.",
    "For the purpose of deep tissue imaging and 3D analysis, the final option is to cut half-trimmed bone specimens from cryo-embedded blocks.\nFor an overview of the various options and downstream analysis possibilities, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] provides information on the gelatin and cryo-embedding procedures.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1484-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Stir gently (to avoid air bubbles) at 65°C until the gelatin is dissolved completely (this can take ∼4 h or can be performed for 12–16 h overnight).\nOn the second day, embed the tissues in gelatin blocks as follows:\nLabel molds and fill them completely with warm (∼65°C) gelatin embedding medium. Pour the medium gently into the molds, avoiding bubbles (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nUsing tweezers, submerge the bone sample in the gelatin, positioned in the center of the mold and orientated in such a way that the growth plate is perpendicular to the vertical axis of the mold, and the bone shaft is leveled horizontally (to facilitate later trimming and sectioning). Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B shows the optimal orientation for an adult femur.\nLet the samples cool down on the bench at 20°C–22°C for 15–30 min until the gelatin solidifies, and store the blocks at −80°C.\nCryo-embedding",
    "Pre-condition samples in a solution of 30% sucrose in PBS (see ‘Recipes for general bone sample preparation solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]’ section under the ‘Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’ header) for 24 h at 4°C.\nTransfer the tissue samples to labeled plastic molds and cover them with Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound.\nNote: Submerge the bones gently to avoid bubble formation.\nPrepare the setup for freezing the tissues: place a borosilicate glass recipient (wide tube or beaker) containing 2-methylbutane at a volume that fills ± 8–10 cm of the tube, hanging inside a wide insulated container with liquid nitrogen (N2), as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C. Allow the 2-methylbutane solution to cool down adequately, i.e., until the bottom part (± 1 cm) of the 2-methylbutane solution solidifies and turns opaque white, while the upper part of the solution remains fluidic.\nNote: An equivalent set-up with other materials can be used to generate a solution of liquid N2-chilled 2-methylbutane.\nUsing long forceps, submerge the mold containing the tissue sample into the cold 2-methylbutane solution, until it quickly becomes completely frozen (takes around 10 s) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E). Allow the tissue matrix to solidify completely and remove block from 2-methylbutane.\nNote: Do not overcool the sample by submerging it longer than necessary in 2-methylbutane, as this may cause the block to crack.\nCollect samples on dry ice until finishing the set of samples; then store them at −80°C.\nPreparation of histological specimens: Tissue sectioning\nTiming: 1–2 h per bone, dependent on experience and number of sections per sample\nPrepare thin or thick sections, as desired according to the selected embedding procedure and output goals (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1484_8.csv\nRetrieve gelatin- or cryo-embedded blocks from −80°C and transfer them to the cryostat at −20°C for temperature conditioning.",
    "Trim the excess of gelatin or OCT compound, respectively, using a blade or a scalpel.\nMount the block into the cryostat chuck (specimen disk) using OCT compound and place it into the fast-freezing station inside the cryostat.\nPlace the chuck into the moving arm and trim the sample cutting ∼50 μm slices until the bone surface of the sample appears.\nCritical: Beware of the sample orientation, and delicately redirect the sample holder in X, Y and Z to obtain even, longitudinal sections across the bone.\nCut tissue sections at the desired thickness.\nCollect the bone sections on coated adhesion microscope slides (e.g., Superfrost Plus).\nFor gelatin sections: Let the sections condition at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) for ∼30 min to ensure adhesion to the slide.\nFor cryo-sections: It is important that the slides are at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) for the section to stick to the slide.\nNote: In case problems arise during sectioning, please refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nStore the slides with the bone sections at −20°C for short-term or at −80°C for long-term preservation.\nImmunostaining of bone sections\nTiming: 2–4 days (depending on the type of immunostaining and type of sections; see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2])\nBones are immunostained to detect blood vessels via antigens typical for endothelial cells, to identify skeletal stem/progenitor cells within the tissue stroma, and/or to visualize GFP-expressing cells or EdU-containing proliferating cells, with the selected options depending on the specific application.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1484_9.csv\n \nNote: For gelatin sections thicker than 200 μm, the primary antibody incubation time may be prolonged up to 48–72 h if required to obtain good penetration into the tissue.\n \nBlocking and permeabilization\nLet the slides come to 20°C–22°C and dry for 1 h to improve adherence of the section to the slide.",
    "Note: If the samples contain an endogenous fluorescence signal that needs to be preserved, e.g., fluorescent reporter expression, ensure to protect them from light for the entirety of the protocol.\nNote: If the sections fail to adhere well to the slide, please refer to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nIncubate with PBS-T for 10 min at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) to rehydrate the tissue.\nCritical: Apply every solution in the entire procedure gently, as the bone sections are very delicate; particularly the bone marrow is easily washed off the slide if not handled carefully.\nClean the excess cryo-embedding medium or gelatin remnants from the surroundings of the bone section using a wipe or blade, and draw a circle around the section using a hydrophobic pen.\nNote: The hydrophobic pen facilitates the creation of a delimited region of the slide containing the tissue section, reducing the volumes required to incubate the tissue with precious/costly reagents (e.g., antibodies).\nNote: Be careful not to spill any hydrophobic ink on the section.\nCritical: Throughout the entire staining procedure, ensure to keep the rehydrated tissue sections immersed in water-based solutions or at the minimum sufficiently moist to avoid that they would dry out. Perform the incubations in a humidified, closed chamber, and keep the sections protected from light when fluorescent signals are involved. Performing the blocking and antibody incubation steps on a very gently rocking platform can help ensure homogeneous staining of the tissues; a risk could be to lose sections if the movements result in detaching of the sections from the slides.",
    "Block and permeabilize samples by adding 100 μL of Blocking Solution (see ‘Recipes for general bone sample preparation solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]’) per section for 45 min at 20°C–22°C (sections) or 12–16 h at 4°C (very thick sections for 3D imaging and trimmed half bones) in a humid/moisture chamber as detailed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nNote: For thin sections, use Blocking Solution without Triton-X-100.\nPrimary and secondary antibody incubations\nIncubate samples with 100 μL of primary antibodies diluted in Blocking Solution for 12–16 h (thin or relatively thick sections) or for 24 h (very thick sections and trimmed half bones) at 4°C as listed in Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1484_10.csv\nRinse briefly once and then wash samples at least 3–4 times for 10 min each, using PBS-T at RT.\nPause point: Here, samples can be stored in the fridge for up to one day. They should always be kept humid.\nIncubate samples with 100 μL of secondary antibodies diluted at 1:200 in PBS-T for 75 min at 20°C–22°C (for 2D imaging) or 24 h at 4°C (for 3D imaging).

    "This step applies to thick sections and trimmed half bones aimed for 3D deep-tissue imaging. For samples that do not require clearing, skip this section and proceed to step 11.\nNote: 2-2′ thiodiethanol (TDE) may quench or change the excitation/emission properties of some dyes when used at high concentrations (>50%). If you are using a GFP reporter or a green fluorescent dye (e.g., Alexa Fluor 488) do not exceed 50% TDE.\nFor more information on clearing using TDE, see (Aoyagi et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Staudt et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nClearing the bone tissue\nClear samples using TDE series of 10%, then 25%, then 50% and finally 100% (or 95% if higher purity reagent was not possible to acquire) in PBS. Each incubation step should last > 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nRinse samples and incubate in 10% TDE in PBS for at least 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nRinse samples and incubate in 25% TDE in PBS for at least 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nRinse samples and incubate in 50% TDE in PBS for at least 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nRinse samples and incubate in 95%–100% TDE for at least 1 h at 20°C–22°C (∗).\nNote: (∗) do not perform this last step when using green fluorescent signals.\nNote: For problems related to Hoechst signal becoming diffuse following clearing, please refer to troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.15].\nMounting the samples\nTiming: 5 min per slide for sections and 15–20 min for half bone\nThis procedure differs between cleared thick sections (follow step 10), non-cleared sections (follow step 11), and half bone samples (follow step 12).\nMounting cleared thick sections.\nMount the slides in 200 μL of TDE at the final concentration used in the clearing steps.\nNote: If the samples are half-bones, omit this step and proceed to step 12 ‘Preparing half bones for image acquisition[href=https://www.wicell.org#o0400]’.",
    "Critical: Mounting slides in TDE is delicate as it does not harden like other mounting mediums. Take this into account when holding the coverslip on top of the slide. Avoid bubble formation by slowly placing the coverslip. If a bubble is generated, tilt the slide with its long edge orienting vertically until air fuses into a big bubble on top, and re-fill the area under the coverslip with TDE using a micropipette.\nRemove the excess TDE by slightly pressing with a finger on top of the coverslip.\nSeal the slides with nail polish and keep them at 4°C. Image in the next few days.\nPause point: Samples are stable in the fridge for a few weeks. Keep them protected from light.\nNote: When sections are maintained longer than a few days, there is an increasing risk of air infiltration between the slide and the coverslip, hampering subsequent imaging. This risk is higher for sections of increasing thickness.\nMounting immunostained, non-cleared sections on the slide\nApply 3–4 drops of Fluoroshield mounting medium on top of the section.\nPlace the edge of the coverslip on a corner of the slide and move it towards the section until touching the mounting medium with the cover slip.\nCarefully lower the coverslip into place and gently press using blunt-end tweezers to remove excess mounting medium.\nOptional: after drying, coverslips can be sealed on the slides with nail polish.\nKeep the slides at 4°C and protected from light. Image in the next few days.\nPreparing half bones for image acquisition",
    "Note: Imaging of half bones must be performed with the lens pointing at the flat, trimmed side. Therefore, the specimen must be stabilized at the side of the half bone that is not trimmed. The following steps describe how to make a mold that will hold the half bone in position for imaging.\nUse a steel spatula to place a small amount of Vaseline in a petri dish and mold it into a rectangle that is large and deep enough to hold the half bone.\nCut a square of parafilm as large as the Vaseline square and carefully stretch it until it becomes thin and malleable.\nCover the Vaseline with the stretched parafilm carefully to avoid tearing it.\nPlace the half bone on top of the parafilm/Vaseline mold and put a Menzel-Gläser coverslip on top of it.\nApply pressure on top of the coverslip delicately until the trimmed half bone side is horizontal and stable.\nProceed to image the half bone.\nNote: In case blurry spots appear during visualization, please refer to troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.17].\nImage acquisition\nTiming: Variable (The image acquisition time can range from e.g., 10 min to 2 h per image, depending on the microscope, the number of stacks per image, and the user’s experience)",
    "Images in the work to which this protocol applies (Mesnieres et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) were acquired using laser-scanning confocal microscopy and spinning disk confocal microscopy. Both are very useful imaging tools, each having its advantages and disadvantages. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy is very powerful at capturing details that demand high resolution and contrast, but it requires relatively long imaging times, and as a result, it can have relatively high photo-toxicity and long microscope usage time. Spinning disk confocal microscopy works at high speed and has increased sensitivity of fluorescence detection but reveals fewer details than laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Therefore, for applications as described in this work, the use of laser-scanning confocal microscopy is recommended for imaging structures that require high levels of detail and resolution (e.g., cell dendrites), and spinning disk confocal microscopy for organ-scale images.\nThe second choice to make relates to the objective lens to use. Objective lenses have the following main features to consider: numerical aperture (NA), working distance (WD), field of view (FoV), and refractive index (RI). The higher the NA, the better the resolution and sensitivity. The longer the WD, the deeper the imaging can go. The bigger the field of view, the more tissue area can be imaged per image taken. The closer the RI the lens is corrected for and the RI of the sample match, the fewer the optical aberrations, the higher the sensitivity and the deeper volume that can be imaged.\nFinally, the desired pixel resolution, thickness, and Z-step size to use for acquisition should be defined prior to imaging. To determine the fitting acquisition settings, Tables 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] provide common starting points.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1484_12.csv\naOnly necessary for 3D analysis. For 2D analysis, the Z-dimension is not used.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1484_13.csv\naOnly necessary for 3D analysis. For 2D analysis, the Z-dimension is not necessary.",
    "Imaging using laser-scanning confocal microscopy\nNote: The following steps apply when using a Nikon TiE inverted C2 confocal microscope equipped with NIS-Elements software. A detailed description of the microscope can be found in the ‘Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’ section.\nTurn on the microscope, the detection system, the computer, and the lasers.\nPlace the sample on the microscope slide holder with the coverslip facing down.\nNote: Always place the sample so that the coverslip is facing the lens.\nNote: In case of using an immersion lens, apply the proper immersion medium (e.g., oil) onto the lens prior to placing the slide on the holder.\nNote: If a multi-immersion lens with dynamic RI is used, ensure to adjust the RI ring position to the medium used for imaging.\nOptional: If a movable slide holder is available in the microscope stage, place the sample such that the long bone axis is parallel to either the X- or the Y-axis of the microscopic field of view. This will facilitate defining the region of interest for image analysis later in the procedure.\nVisualization:\nOpen the microscopy acquisition software and use a wide-field optical configuration that relies on LEDs or a mercury lamp to find and orient the sample.\nOpen the shutter and select the color of the fluorophore that will be used to locate the sample through the microscope’s eyepiece and bring it into focus.\nNote: You should have the option between three colors: red, green, and blue. If Hoechst was used to label cell nuclei blue, it is recommended to use this channel to localize your sample.\nAcquisition:",
    "Once the sample is in the right position and focused, the next steps involve determining the laser power, scanning speed, or exposure time (depending on the detection system), the pinhole size (if it is dynamic), and the dimensional parameters.\nNote: Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] provides a starting guide for defining fitting acquisition settings.\nChange to the confocal imaging optical configuration and start with a laser power between 5%–10%, a gain of 80–100, and a pinhole size as close as possible to 1 AU, to find the top layer of the sample by turning the coarse focus or the fine one.\nNote: The pinhole size is critical for the resolution in the Z-axis. The smaller it is, the higher the resolution, but the lower the amount of light that is captured.\nNote: For determining the settings, click the “fast scan icon” in NIS-Elements or select a 512 × 512 px resolution and a scanning speed of 0.5–1 frames per second (fps).\nOnce the sample is in focus, define the dimensions in X and Y (i.e., the size of the final tiled image) by determining the top left and bottom right borders and adding these locations to the system parameters.\nNote: For problems regarding signal heterogeneity in the XY axis, please refer to troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.19].\nOptional: Define the desired acquisition range in the Z direction (i.e., the depth of the tissue to be confocally imaged; this is especially relevant when working with a thick section or half bone). Add the locations of the Z-range's top and bottom layers to the software window's acquisition settings.",
    "Optional: If imaging in Z, define the separation between the individual optical sections. The ideal Z-spacing depends on the NA of the lens (the Z-resolution of the microscope) and the intended analyses. If the purpose is 3D visualization and 2D blood vessel analysis on middle single optical sections or maximum intensity projections (MIPs), the Z-spacing does not require to be extremely narrow (e.g., in our hands, up to 10 μm or even higher has worked well). For 3D nearest neighbor distance calculations though, a Z-step at least 2 times smaller than the smallest object to quantify (within the resolution power of the lens) is needed (e.g., a 4 μm cell nucleus requires a Z-step of maximally 2 μm between the optical sections). The Nyquist ratio can be used to avoid under- or over-sampling, especially if the image will follow a deconvolution step.\nWhen the XY tile-scan area and the Z range and separation have been defined, find the proper laser power, gain, and resolution for the desired image.\nNote: Too much laser power can bleach the sample. Too much gain will result in increased Poisson noise. Too much resolution will result in a longer imaging duration. Find the right balance to get the required resolution and best signal-to-noise ratio.\nNote: When the final aim is to compare samples from different experimental groups (e.g., quantitative or qualitative image analysis between conditions or genotypes), it is important to use the same imaging settings for all the samples.\nWhen the image is fully acquired, save it in the microscope’s original software format (e.g., “.nd2” for images generated using a Nikon microscope).\nNote: For problems with stitching, please refer to troubleshooting 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.21].\nImaging using spinning disk confocal microscopy",
    "Note: The following steps apply when using a Nikon NiE upright confocal microscope equipped with NIS-Elements software. The microscope’s full set-up is detailed in the ‘Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]’ section.\nNote: The upright configuration of this microscopy system offers advantages for imaging thick sections and half bones, as they can be held upward and immersed in TDE clearing medium during imaging.\nStart the microscopy system\nTurn on the microscope, the detection system, the computer, and the lasers.\nFor acquiring large-scale images using the spinning disk microscope, the use of a multi-immersion objective is recommended (e.g., Nikon CFI Plan Apo 10XC Glyc, NA 0.5, WD 5.5 mm).\nNote: after installing the objective, ensure to change the RI ring position to the one corresponding to the medium used for imaging (e.g., RI 1.51 for 95%–100% TDE or oil; RI 1.42 for 50% TDE).\nNote: It is also possible to use an air lens if multi-immersion objectives are not available. However, the resolution that can be reached will be lower.\nPosition the sample on the stage\nEither place the slide directly into the slide holder position of the stage or use a 100 mm petri dish holding the slide (thick section) or sample (half bone). The dish can be filled with TDE, such that the specimen can be imaged using an immersion lens even when the working distance (WD) is relatively large.\nNote: For positioning a slide with a section in a TDE-filled dish, gently place the slide on the bottom of the dish avoiding bubbles formation.

    "Set steps of 10 μm in Z if the aim is to perform 2D blood vessel analysis (this resolution is sufficient for blood vessel network visualization).\nNote: For 3D spatial quantifications, it is recommended to take the input image using a 20X lens, and the Z-spacing should be set to maximally 2 μm.\nNote: For problems with stitching, please refer to troubleshooting 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.21].\nQuantitative analysis of the bone vasculature architecture in 2D images\nTiming: 1–3 h per image, highly dependent on the user’s experience\nThe following section describes in detail how to segment and quantify different features of the blood vessel network morphometry and topology in 2D, starting from single optical sections generated through confocal imaging as described above.\nOptional image processing steps: deconvolving, denoising, and Z-intensity equalization Stacked tiles used for 3D visualization and/or quantification of different parameters always have reduced Z-axis resolution and quality compared to the XY-axis due to convolution of the underlying sample structure with the point spread function of the microscope. One way to increase the resolution and thus the quality of the image and subsequent analysis is to perform deconvolution on the image, followed by denoising and a Z-intensity equalization step to reduce the pixel intensity differences between Z-planes from different depths. These image pre-processing steps can be performed using NIS-Elements software (AR 5.30.01 64-bit or later versions), as described here, or using another software with comparable image processing tools (e.g., Huygens, Arivis).\nOpen the raw “.nd2” image in NIS-Elements.",

    "Tissue area segmentation (selecting the ROI) As a first step, the region of interest (ROI) for the analysis needs to be determined, in a consistent manner for all samples that are intended to be comparatively analyzed. Several of the blood vessel features to be quantified need to be normalized to the size of the ROI, i.e., the total tissue area under consideration, to express them as a fraction, frequency, or density relative to the tissue surface area comprising the ROI. To select the ROI, follow these steps, illustrated in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4C:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1484-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. 2D blood vessel segmentation and analysis pipeline for describing the architecture of the bone vasculature\n(A) Representative MIP of an E18.5 tibia stained against CD31 for blood vessels and Hoechst for cell nuclei.\n(B) Example single optical section used as a starting point for the pipeline.\n(C) ROI comprising the bone marrow area inside the bone shaft, shown as a binary mask.\n(D) Binary CD31 signal within the ROI.\n(E) Binary blood vessels, closed manually and filled to include both the vessel walls and lumens.\n(F) Filtered segmented blood vessel image used for analysis.\n(G–J) Process of skeletonization.

    "Blood vessel segmentation in 2D. Antibodies directed against blood vessel markers such as endomucin (Emcn) and CD31 label endothelial cell membrane proteins, thereby staining the linings of the blood vessels specifically, but not the lumens inside the blood vessel walls (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). To perform the analyses described in the following section, binary images must first be created that contain the vessel linings and lumens altogether. Therefore, using single optical sections (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) and within the selected ROI (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C), the segmented immunostained blood vessel outlines (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) have to be closed manually whenever the lining is incomplete and then filled using an image processing software (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4F). Here, we describe how to segment blood vessels using FIJI, but technically similar other software packages can be used alternatively (e.g., CellProfiler, Icy).\nNote: FIJI (Fiji is just ImageJ) is an image processing package distribution of the open-source software ImageJ. To process and analyze confocal images using the method described here, the following plugin should be installed in FIJI: IJPB-plugins, https://sites.imagej.net/IJPB-plugins/[href=https://sites.imagej.net/IJPB-plugins/]\nImport the processed or raw image into FIJI by dragging and dropping the file onto FIJI’s window.\nDuplicate the channel containing the blood vessel signal by clicking on “Image>Duplicate…”\nNote: If it is a stacked image, select the slice with the most complete blood vessel network and write the selected slice number in the “Range” box of the duplication window such that a single optical section is used from here on.\nNote: Be sure that the “Duplicate Hyperstack” box is unchecked and that the proper channel number is selected.\nPerform a “Default” or “Huang” global threshold.\nNote: The blood vessel marker signal should be relatively homogenous in the XY axes and sufficiently bright for these algorithms to work. If this is not the case, refer to the ‘troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]’ section.",
    "Optional: To ensure the ImageJ software uses white as the “Foreground” color and black as the “Background” color, use “Process>Binary>Convert to Mask” and check the box “Black background”.\nCritical: The same threshold algorithm should be used for all images analyzed within a batch of samples that are to be compared afterwards.\nSelect the binary image generated in the previous step and use the paintbrush tool to draw a line where needed to close every incompletely closed blood vessel outline within the image.\nNote: The drawing color should be white. If it is not, double-click on the paintbrush icon and select the white color before starting. If the problem persists, please refer to troubleshooting 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.27].\nOnce every vessel is properly closed, apply a manual threshold of 1–255 to convert the image into a binary image.\nUse the “Analyze particles…” tool and click on the “Add to Manager” option.\nVerify that all the blood vessels in the original image were detected and select them all. Use the “More>fill” tool within the ROI Manager window to fill all the detected blood vessels (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: This image will further be referred to as “filled blood vessels image”.\nNote: For problems related to incompletely filled blood vessels, please refer to troubleshooting 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.29].\nTo filter out contaminating signal particles and unspecific background signal, use the “Analyze>Analyze Particles…” tool; set the “size” parameter to an appropriate value (e.g., fill out 50 to eliminate particles smaller than 50 μm2) and select the “Show>Masks” option (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nNote: Depending on the image, this parameter can be increased to 100 μm2 to eliminate larger particles, but it is important to ensure that no meaningful signal is lost in the process.",
    "Selecting blood vessels specifically within the ROI To only quantify those blood vessels that localize within the ROI, external blood vessels are omitted from the analysis image prior to performing the quantitative analysis.\nUse the “Process>Image calculator…” tool from FIJI’s main window and apply an “AND” operation using tissue mask image as “Image 1” and the filled blood vessels image as “Image 2”.\nNote: This step should generate an image lacking any signal outside the borders of the selected ROI.\nNote: The resulting image should show the segmented blood vessels in white and the background in black.\nAligning the bone and blood vessel orientation To determine the blood vessel directionality, the image needs to be rotated so that all samples are aligned in the same manner with respect to a reference point or structure. We commonly employ a vertical orientation for the bone shaft, with the growth plate positioned horizontally (as in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRotate the image in steps of 90° until a smaller angle is required using the “Image>Transform>Rotate 90 degrees to the Right/Left” tools.\nRotate the image with respect to the growth plate or another reference within the tissue using “Image>Transform>Rotate…”. Find the proper angle; ensure to check the “Enlarge image” and “Preview” boxes and tick off the “Grid lines” box.\nNote: To better preserve the image’s original appearance while rotating, a bi-linear (for 2D) interpolation can be considered. Bear in mind that this may result in changes in pixel intensity, thus precluding measuring pixel intensity if that would be additionally desired (this does not apply to the quantifications presented here).\nNote: This image will be further referred to as “Processed blood vessels image”.\nNote: For problems related to loss of information following image rotation, please refer to troubleshooting 16[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.31].",
    "Determine the blood vessel area and perimeter fraction (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K)\nSelect the “Processed blood vessels image” and measure the segmented blood vessel area and perimeter using the “Plugins>MorphoLibJ>Analyze>Analyze Regions” tool.\nSelect the “tissue mask image” and measure the tissue area using the “Plugins>MorphoLibJ>Analyze>Analyze Regions” tool.\nStore all the generated values by transferring them to an excel table or save them as “.csv” files.\nDetermine the blood vessels width (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]L)\nSelect the “Processed blood vessels image” and measure local blood vessel width using Analyze>Local Thickness>Local Thickness (masked, calibrated, silent)”.\nNote: The generated image will be further referred to as “local thickness image”.\nMeasure the frequency distribution of blood vessel width using “Analyze>Histogram” on the generated image. Select the number of desired bins and the range of values to plot in microns (e.g., 0–200).\nNote: The number of bins can be calculated by dividing the maximum value of the range by the desired step number (e.g., maximum value of 200 μm in 10 μm steps will be equivalent to 20 bins).\nSelect the histogram window and click on the “list” icon. Save this list as “.csv” or copy the data into an excel table for future analysis.\nTo generate blood vessel pseudo-coloration according to vessel width intervals, duplicate the local thickness image using the “Image>Duplicate…” tool. The image should be duplicated once for every interval desired to become color-labeled. For 4 intervals, duplicate the image four times and binarize each one of them using “Image>Adjust>Threshold” by setting interval ranges manually.\nNote: Ranges should not overlap; they can be equal in size or variable, at the user’s discretion. For equal intervals, e.g., spanning 200 μm width, the 4 intervals would range 1–50, 51–100, 101–150, and 151–200.",
    "To generate the pseudo-colored combined image, use the “Image>Color>Merge Channels…” tool and assign the individual binary images (corresponding to the different width ranges) each to a channel in the order of size (e.g., Channel 1 containing the 0–50 μm width range, Channel 2 the 51–100 μm range, etc.).\nStore the image as “.tiff”, which will preserve the different channels.\nNote: Saving the image as “.jpg” flattened image may enable more easy handling later, but not all the information is retained.\nDetermine the blood vessel topology To calculate the topology of the vascular network, the blood vessels need to be skeletonized (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G–4J). This is a necessary step to obtain information on the number of blood vessel branches, their connectivity (total junctions), the number of triple and quadruple junctions, and the blood vessel directionality.\nBlood vessel centerline definition (skeletonization of the vasculature):\nUse the “Process>Filters>Gaussian Blur” filter with a sigma of 8 to smoothen the blood vessels outlines to facilitate accurate skeletonization.\nNote: Skeletonization (i.e., centerline generation) is very sensitive to rough outlines as it uses cycles of erosion until generating the centerline of one pixel in width (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I). When the outline of the structure that will be skeletonized is not smooth enough, artificial branches might appear (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H). If the structure is smoothened too much, real blood vessels might be left out of the analysis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J). In any of these cases, change the sigma accordingly.\nSelect the “Processed blood vessel image” and obtain its centerline using Plugins>Skeleton>Skeletonize (2D/3D).\nNote: This image will be referred to as “Skeletonized image”.\nAnalyze the skeleton using the “Analyze>Skeleton>Analyze Skeleton” tool. Check the “Elimination of End-points: Prune ends” and the “Results and Output: Show detailed info” boxes (example images are shown in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]M and 4N).",
    "Note: For problems arising during skeletonization, please refer to troubleshooting 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.33].\nSave the resulting two tables in an excel file or as “.csv” files. The “Results” table data can be used to calculate the total number of branches, and the total, triple and quadruple junctions. The “Branch information” table data is used as input to generate the frequency distribution graph of branch lengths.\nDetermine the blood vessel directionality Blood vessel directionality is a useful parameter to gain quantitative knowledge on the vascular organization in vivo in various conditions. For this calculation, the skeletonized image is used. Since the centerline also functions as a projection of the blood vessel direction at that given position, it is the proper input to use to obtain the frequency distribution of blood vessel angles.\nSelect the “Skeletonized image” and use the “Analyze>Directionality” tool applying the “Local gradient orientation” method and tick the “Build orientation map”, “Display color wheel”, “Display table”.\nNote: The color wheel contains the color map assigned to the different calculated angles.\nCopy the data of the table into an excel file or save it as a “.csv” file for later plotting and analysis.\nQuantitative analysis of endothelial cell proliferation This quantification requires an image containing nuclear, endothelial, and proliferation markers as an input. For this protocol, we used images containing Hoechst-labeled nuclei, Emcn-labeled endothelial cells, and PHH3-stained proliferating cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1484-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Open the processed “.nd2” image by dragging and dropping it into FIJI’s window.\nMake a composite image with the 3 channels clicking on “Image>Color>Make Composite” to facilitate the detection of the proliferating endothelial cells.\nNote: Endothelial cells can be distinguished based on Emcn-positive signal around a Hoechst-positive nucleus. If this nucleus co-localizes with a PHH3 signal, then the endothelial cell is considered a proliferating cell (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B–5D).\nTo use the same quantification surface area, draw a rectangle using the “Rectangle” selection tool and add it to FIJI’s ROI Manager using “Ctrl + T”. Once the rectangle is drawn, use “Image>Duplicate” to generate a new image containing only the selected ROI.\nNote: You can now use the same rectangle on other images, as long as the ROI Manager stays open.\nTo count and save the location of the proliferating and non-proliferating endothelial cells, use the “Multi-point” selection tool in FIJI.\nOptional: You can save multi-point selections within the ROI Manager window by selecting them all and saving them as “.roi” files.\nCritical: To avoid bias, always perform quantifications in a blinded fashion.\n3D quantitative analysis of the spatial relationship between osteoprogenitors and blood vessels\nTiming: 1–3 h per 3D image, highly dependent on the researcher’s experience",

    "Use the “Imaris Converter” software to transform either raw or processed images into “.ims” images to be able to visualize them in Imaris.\nImage quality inspection prior to 3D analysis This section requires image sets that include stacks of multiple slices that can be rendered in 3D. The following steps describe how to inspect the image for key quality markers and the potential presence of exclusion criteria.\nOpen the generated “.ims” image in Imaris. Explore the image using the “Slice” or “Section” views.\nIf the bone marrow presents holes, cracks or ruptures of considerable size (e.g., compromising >10% of the surface of a single optical section or observable in Z-axial views), exclude the sample from the analysis and refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section on how to avoid this problem.\nCheck that the different used stainings penetrated the tissue homogeneously by looking at multiple slices along the Z-axis using the “Section” view. If any of the markers shows scattered penetration lines instead of a uniform horizontal pattern, exclude the image from the analysis.\nNote: For problems concerning uneven staining or high background signal of the tissue sample, please refer to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nCheck the homogeneity of the stainings and signals in the XY fields of view, i.e., per section. If a marker shows considerable heterogeneity, i.e., large differences in signal intensity observed on similar structures/cells, exclude the image from the analysis.\nBlood vessel segmentation in 3D The following steps delineate how to model 3D blood vessels as a surface mesh using Imaris.\nSet the viewer in 3D view mode.\nClick on “3D view/Surfaces” to model blood vessel signals as a surface mesh.\nNote: If the image is too large to be handled smoothly (e.g., >20 GB), crop it into multiple smaller images using “Edit/Crop 3D…”",
    "Note: If using Imaris 9.6 or newer versions, tick the “Object-Object Statistics” box to open the software’s spatial statistics tool.\nSelect the channel with the blood vessel marker as “Source channel” and determine the ideal level of smoothing for the image.\nOptional: Imaris “Smooth” uses a 3D Gaussian filter that can help eliminate noise (e.g., coming from the detection system) and unwanted small particles.\nNote: It is important not to apply too much smoothing as this bears the risk of impacting the vascular signal. This risk applies especially to relatively moderate or low resolution; in such cases, the “Smooth” function is not recommended. If this is case, refer to troubleshooting 18[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.35].\nThreshold the vasculature using the “Absolute intensity” option.\nNote: If the threshold value proposed by Imaris does not succeed in including all blood vessels in the selection, adapt the value manually to obtain adequate segmentation of the vascular signal as judged by the original image.\nCritical: The same threshold should be applied to all conditions that are compared.\nFilter out the remaining particles or unwanted blobs using the “Number of voxels” filter.\nFinalize the surface creation by clicking the multiple arrows icon.\nOsteoprogenitor detection Osx-Cre:GFP-expressing osteoprogenitor cells (SSPCs and osteolineage cells) exhibit nuclear localization of GFP, allowing for them to be modeled as particles using algorithms embedded in Imaris that look for bright intensity centers (3D maxima) of a certain size. The software places a sphere for every detected GFP+ cell (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F). Similar pipelines can be used to other nuclear markers, either transgenic or immunostained.\nClick on “3D view/Spots” to start the particle detection process.\nSelect the channel with the nuclear signal of interest (e.g., Osx-GFP).",
    "To estimate the proper XY diameter of the spots (cell nuclei) to be detected, use the “Slice” view to draw the diameter of a few nuclei in 2D; this is done by left-clicking on two opposite borders within the longer axis of the selected cell nuclei. Use the average diameter as the “Estimated XY Diameter” in the spot modeling tool.\nOptional: If the nuclear signal is highly elongated in Z due to anisotropic resolution, tick the “Model PSF-elongation along Z-axis” box. Also see troubleshooting 19[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.37].\nSelect 3–5 different small ROIs within your image to evaluate the quality of the automatic spot detection.\nManually count the spots in each of these ROIs and deduct therefrom the true versus false positive and negative detections made by the software. Find the “Quality” value threshold for which the automatically detected spots most accurately represent the real signal.\nNote: Imaris “Spots” object creation tool window has a filtering step incorporated into the creation process that is automatically set in the “Quality” feature. This feature is the intensity at the center of the spot of the channel used for spot detection. Additional filters can be applied depending on the user’s needs (e.g., intensity mean in another channel).\nNND between detected osteoprogenitor cells and blood vessels The following steps only need to be applied if using an older version than Imaris 9.6. In newer versions of the software, the “spots” object creation tool automatically provides the spatial statistics data.\nSelect the generated blood vessel surface from the Imaris scene.\nClick on “Image Processing>Surfaces Functions>Distance Transformation”.\nNote: This will generate a new channel containing the distance to the nearest blood vessel surface as image intensity values per voxel.\nSelect the modeled spots from the Imaris scene.",
