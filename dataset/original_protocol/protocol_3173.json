The most challenging point\n      is to reduce the cost to obtain a full optically corrected spectral range\n      from 450 to 1470 nm, to combine both live imaging and IR irradiation.\n      There are two ways to implement focalized laser scanning for IR heat.\n      Firstly, we can have a passive optical path (the laser will be in a fixed\n      position at the center of the field of view) with a motorized stage. The\n      second is to use a scanning head (usually consisting of a galvanometric\n      mirror) to change the position of the focused laser.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2942-Fig1.jpg\n          Figure 1. IR-LEGO experimental setup combined with confocal spinning\n          disk for live imaging\n        \n          (A) IR-LEGO system schematic. The infrared photo-irradiation device\n          (IR-LEGO module in light red) is coupled to a spinning disk microscope\n          dedicated to fluorescence live imaging (spinning disk confocal module\n          in gray). IR-LEGO module consists in an infrared laser diode, a\n          galvanometric head mirror to align the laser in the center of the\n          field, a mirror, a dichroic mirror D1 and an IR compatible objective\n          lens, to focalize the laser on the sample. Spinning disk confocal\n          module contains an inverted microscope equipped with an imaging laser\n          combiner composed of 4 diode lasers, a Nipkow spinning head (Yokogawa\n          CSU X1), a fast SCMOS camera and a galvanometric stage for fast image\n          acquisition.\n        \n          (B) A schematic of the sample setup for IR-LEGO using a 40 X APO IR",
    "water objective. The magnification shows the laser target in the\n          middle of the zebrafish embryo telencephalon required here for the\n          experiments.\n        \n          (C) IR irradiation of \"upconverted phosphor particles\"\n          imaged in transmission. \"Upconverted phosphor particles\"\n          were irradiated with a power of 90% IR laser, inducing an emission\n          wavelength of 545 nm. The irradiation diameter on the calibration\n          sample is estimated to 34 μm (black outlined circle, grey line shows\n          the diameter).\n        \n          (D and E) Experimental system for synchronization of IR irradiation\n          (D) and live imaging (E) conditions. Synchronization timings of all\n          laser-induced heating components followed by (E) imaging chromatogram\n          for each component to reduce phototoxicity. These timings are driven\n          by Metamorph (\"synchronization card\").\n        \n      In both cases, the best way to connect any microscope is to use the\n      corrected optical input at the rear of the microscope without an\n      intermediate optical lens. These lenses are generally optimized for\n      visible light. In fact, it is possible to connect to the tubular lens at\n      the output of the microscope, but generally in the visible range.\n    \n        Use a spinning disk microscope dedicated to confocal fluorescence\n        imaging in the visible range, coupled to an infrared photo-irradiation\n        device (Rapp OptoElectronic GmbH) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\n      \nOptional: A widefield system can be\n      used for smaller samples (bacteria, cell culture, etc…).\n    \n        Couple the IR-LEGO module (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, light red\n        rectangle) to the infinity optical corrected input of the inverted\n        microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, gray rectangle).\n      \nNote: The near infrared laser diode (light\n      source DL-1470/2500/RSP2 Rapp OptoElectronic GmbH) with centered\n      wavelength at 1470 nm leads to a 17°C temperature increase as described in\n      step 3.\n    \nNote: Each element from optical fiber to\n      objective lenses, has dedicated optical chromatism correction: fibered\n      collimator, mirror M1, dichroic mirror D1, and dedicated objective lenses\n      (HC PL IR APO 40×/1.10 W CORR).\n    \nNote: A galvanometric head mirror (UGA-42",
    "Geo Rapp OptoElectronic GmbH) composed of silver mirror, is conjugated to\n      the back focal plane of the lens to align the laser in the center of the\n      field.\n    \nNote: Synchronization between the two\n      modules, IR-LEGO and microscope, during IR irradiation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) or real-time image acquisition (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) is\n      performed by the IR laser supplier according to the experimenters’ needs.\n    \nNote: IR-LEGO set up (IR laser of 1470 nm)\n      was added on a spinning device to avoid photodamage and photobleaching\n      during live imaging.\n    \nNote: Contact your IR laser supplier to\n      check that your microscope is compatible with the addition of a LEGO IR\n      device. They can also help you define what you need to order specifically\n      to add to your spinning disc confocal microscope in order to carry out\n      this protocol.\n    \n        Check in vivo (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) IR irradiation\n        condition using a dedicated tool (Calibration sample: Phosphor Micro\n        Upconverting Particles, Rapp OptoElectronic GmbH8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) at the end of the installation, to ensure that the IR-LEGO set up\n        hardware (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) is operational.\n      \nNote: In our configuration (step 19),\n      using a laser intensity of 90%, we estimate the IR irradiation radius to\n      be approximately 17 μm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). In our\n      experimental setup the laser power in the back pupil plane of the\n      microscope is around 100 mW. This corresponds to a surface irradiation\n      density of 5.5 kW/cm2. Hence, in 1 min, the sample receives 330\n      Kilojoule (KJ). Depending on your biological sample, these values will be\n      adapted. We advise to start with a test experiment depending on the laser\n      power and time of exposure.\n    \nNote: With conventional laser (between 100\n      mW and 200 mW and wavelength between 670 nm and 980 nm compatible in\n      conventional microscopy), the maximal temperature increase with a very",
    "high numerical aperture, is only about 5°C. This conclusion is based on\n      the laser-induced heating model developed by Peterman and co-workers.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\n      The only way to achieve an increase from 21 to 37 degrees, and to be able\n      to activate a heat-shock promoter without photodamage, is to increase the\n      wavelength to 1470 nm. Here, we refer to the analytical model introduces\n      by Peterman9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] to achieve an increase of 17\n      degrees for 10 cells.\n    \nNote: The heat power transferred across\n      two infinitesimally separated concentric cylindrical surfaces with radius,\n      r; is given by the first Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1]:\n    \n(Equation 1)\nq\n=\n−\nK\n2\nπ\nr\nL\nd\nT\nd\nr\n      where q is the heat power absorbed by water along the distance L of the\n      laser-light path inside the chamber, K is the thermal conductivity of\n      water, r and L respectively the radius and the length of the cylinder, and\n      dT is the temperature difference between the two cylindrical surfaces from\n      the focal point of the laser to the cover slide. By rearranging\n      Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1] and integrating dr, the temperature change\n      between two finitely separated cylindrical surfaces can be obtained in\n      Equation 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd2]:\n    \n(Equation 2)\nΔ\nT\n(\nr\n,\nr\n′\n)\n=\nT\n(\nr\n)\n−\nT\n(\nr\n′\n)\n=\nq\n2\nπ\nK\nL\nln\nr\n′\nr\n      Where r' is the radius of the outside cylinder at the surface of cover\n      slide. The absorbed power over the distance L is very small (Pout/Pin\n      close to 1, for L = e, where e is the distance between coverslip end the\n      focalized laser, 170 μm).\n    \nNote: Therefore, by using Lambert-Beer’s\n      law, the heat power, q, is given by:\n    \nq\n=\nP\ni\nn\n−\nP\no\nu\nt\n=\nP\ni\nn\n−\nP\ni\nn\nexp",
    "(\n−\nα\nw\na\nt\ne\nr\ne\n)\nq\n≈\nP\ni\nn\nα\nw\na\nt\ne\nr\ne\nα\nw a t e r\n      is the absorption coefficient of water.\n    \n      r' is equal to 17 μm based on the measurements (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\n    \n      r, for an over filling of the objective around 30%, is close to e =\n      170 μm.\n    \n      By using r equal to 17 μm, r' around 170 μm, Pin(100 mW)\n      \nα\nw a t e r\n  = 2.81 cm-1 (at λ = 1470 nm and K = 0.60 W.m-1.K-1). Thanks to\n      Equation 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd2], the difference is around 17°C between the\n      center of the focal plane and the temperature at 21°C on the coverslip.\n    \nAlternatives: A measurement using\n      a heat camera to characterize the system experimentally could be\n      envisaged.\n    \nPreparation of experimental zebrafish embryos\nTiming: 17 h\nDay 1\nPreparation of the desired fish lines for IR-LEGO and live imaging.\nEmbryo production using breeders.\nNote: Fishes are maintained at the\n      Centre de Biologie Intégrative zebrafish facility in accordance\n      with the rules and protocols in place. The cxcl12at30516 mutant line has previously been described.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nNote: Embryos were obtained through\n      natural crosses and staged according to.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nAlternatives: Different transgenic\n      lines with an appropriate genetic background (i.e., gene of interest fused\n      with a fluorescent protein DNA under the control of an hsp promoter) can\n      be used.\n    \nNote: Handling adult zebrafishes could\n      cause stress which may prevent them from mating. For this reason, breeders\n      are placed in the breeding tanks in the evening before starting the mating\n      process the next morning (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A for a timeline\n      overview).\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2942-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2.

We aim for a male: female ratio\n      between 1:2 and 1:3. By placing one male with several females, a higher\n      number of embryos can be harvested the next day. Adjust the number of\n      adults to obtain a sufficient number of embryos the next day, as you will\n      need at least 30 embryos per experiment (maximum number of embryos that\n      could be mounted per experiment which will be selected according to their\n      fluorescence intensity). A couple produces around 150 embryos. For\n      additional information on standard zebrafish husbandry practices, please\n      refer to.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]",
    "Day 2\nTiming: 7 h\n        Remove the divider between breeders after the light is switched on in\n        the morning to allow males and females to breed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\n        \nNote: Depending on the required stage\n          for embryo collection, this step can be delayed and adjusted according\n          to experimental needs. Manipulate the embryos staging by controlling\n          the start of the fish mating through removing the divider between\n          males and females around 10 am (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        \nNote: External fertilization occurs\n          approximately 30 min after removing the divider. The stage of an\n          embryo is referred to by using the acronym hpf (hours post\n          fertilization).\n        \nAlternatives: Crosses can be\n          performed at any time in the day. However, the next steps should\n          follow the indicated timeline.\n        \nCritical: Once you have removed\n          the divider and the adults have laid eggs, you cannot stop the\n          experiment, but you can slightly adjust the timeline (see step number\n          9 below).\n        \n        30 min after removing the divider, collect embryos using an egg\n        strainer.\n      \n        Transfer them into a Petri dish filled with fish water (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E). This ensures a homogeneous staging population of fertilized\n        embryos.\n      \n        Place embryos in a 28.5°C incubator and grow to 11 hpf for IR-LEGO and\n        time lapse imaging (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        \nNote: Dead embryos and unfertilized\n          eggs should be removed.\n        \nNote: Keep the fish water clean by\n          changing it regularly (at least twice a day) until the embryos have\n          been processed.\n        \nNote: The optimal density of embryos\n          is 50–100 per 90 mm diameter Petri dish. Use a stereoscopic microscope\n          equipped with a transmitted light source to check the embryos’ state.\n        \nCritical: Embryos used for imaging\n          must be handled with care and changed at least once a day with fresh\n          fish water.\n        \nNote: When the embryo reaches the",
    "shield stage i.e., 6 hpf, place the embryos in a 21°C incubator from 4\n          pm to 10 am to slow down their development and get the stage of\n          interest to perform IR-LEGO the next morning (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        \nNote: Following our timeline, the\n          embryos are at shield stage around 4 pm. At this time, we transfer\n          them into a 21°C incubator to reach the 12 hpf stage the next day at\n          10 am (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n        \nCritical: Embryos will not develop\n          properly if the temperature is below 21°C. Colder temperatures would\n          lead to high mortality. Do not slow down the embryos before they reach\n          the shield stage because gastrulation has not yet occurred.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\n      Preparation of agarose Petri dish and mounting zebrafish embryos\n    \nDay 3\nTiming: 1 h\n        Sort the proper staged embryos for fluorescent expression under a stereo\n        zoom microscope (SMZ18 Nikon).\n      \nNote: At the 4 somite stage (11.3 hpf),\n      selected transgenic claudin [Tg(cldnb:lyn-GFP)] embryos based on\n      their green fluorescence (GFP +) in the telencephalon (forebrain, yellow\n      dotted circle, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\n    \nNote: Transfer the selected embryos to a\n      Petri dish with fish water.\n    \n        At the desired stage (here 12 hpf) remove the chorion under a\n        stereoscopic microscope equipped with a transmitted light source.\n        \nUsing dissecting tweezers, gently make a tear in the chorion.\n            Turn it upside down so that the embryo falls out.\n            \nNote: Following the timeline the\n              embryos reach 12 hpf at 10 a.m., removing the chorion will result\n              in better imaging and allowing the embryos to favorably unwrap\n              itself and elongate during the time-lapse movie.\n            \nAlternatives: To\n              dechorionate the embryos, a Pronase solution can be used according\n              to “The Zebrafish book” recipes[href=https://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/cont.html].\n            \nCritical: Dechorionated\n              embryos will stick to plastic, therefore, use glass pipettes and\n              glass dishes.\n            \n        Prepare 0.7% low melting (LM) agarose mounting solution.

We use 120 μL of 0.7% LM agarose on a 35 mm bottom glass Petri dish\n      adapted for an inverted microscope. This system could be adapted to an\n      upright microscope.\n    \nNote: As required, place the 2 mL tube\n      containing the 0.7% LM agarose solution (stored at 4°C) in a dry bath",
    "(90°C for 15 min) to melt the agarose, then transfer the tube to a dry\n      bath at 32°C for a maximum of 45 min, otherwise the agarose will solidify.\n    \nCritical: Be careful to minimize\n      boiling over to reduce evaporation.\n    \nNote: When the 4°C aliquoted 0.7% LM\n      agarose is melted do not return it to 4°C but discard what remains if it\n      has not been completely used.\n    \nNote: 0.7% LM agarose should be melted at\n      least 45 min prior mounting embryos in order to allow it to melt and\n      adjust to the appropriate temperature in the 32°C dry bath. 0.7% LM\n      agarose in fish water is used to immobilize embryos for live imaging.\n    \nCritical: Use a traceable thermometer\n      to monitor agarose temperature. Be aware that temperatures above 35°C will\n      activate the heat shock promoter in the whole embryo during mounting. This\n      would cause activation of gene expression throughout the embryo\n      independently of exposure to the IR laser and therefore without spatial\n      control.\n    \n        Use a fine tip glass Pasteur pipet to transfer the embryos in the\n        agarose droplet (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\n        Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting],\n        problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\n      \n        Before the 0.7% LM agarose solidifies, position the embryos dorsally by\n        using dissecting forceps.\n      \nNote: Embryos should be mounted with the\n      somites and trunks at the top and the olfactory system (region of\n      interest, ROI) near the glass slide at the bottom for observation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) on the inverted spinning disk microscope.\n    \nCritical: There is a short time window\n      of less than 2 min to correctly position the embryos before agarose\n      solidifies.
