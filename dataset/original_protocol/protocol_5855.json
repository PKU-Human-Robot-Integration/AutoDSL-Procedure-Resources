    "Harvesting biomassHarvest 1 ml of cyanobacterial culture suspension of OD730 0.1-0.5 (Note 1).Centrifuge the cells at 15,000 x g, laboratory temperature for 5 min and thoroughly discard the supernatant (Figure 1.1).For long-term storage, keep the samples at -80 °C and thaw on ice before further analysis.Extracting chlorophyll and carotenoids from the cells (Note 2)Add 1 ml of methanol, precooled to 4 °C. Homogenize the sample by gentle pipetting up and down.In case of pigments quantification, cover the samples with aluminum foil. Extract pigments from the cells by allowing the samples to sit at 4 °C in the dark for 20 min.Centrifuge the samples at 15,000 x g, 4 °C for 5 min and visually check pellet; it should be bluish (or purple) with no green color. If the pellet is green, repeat Steps B3-B4.Thoroughly discard all methanol supernatant by pipette (Figure 1.2). Keep the pellets for further analysis of total saccharides or starch/glycogen.Optionally, measure the concentration of chlorophyll and carotenoids in the methanol supernatant using a spectrophotometer according to Zavřel et al. (2015a). For long-term storage, keep the pellets without chlorophyll and carotenoids at -80 °C and thaw on ice before further analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180730/20180730001600_9352.jpgFigure 1. Individual steps of total carbohydrates and glycogen determination in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The protocol begins with cells harvesting and centrifugation (1) and extraction of chlorophyll a and carotenoids to methanol (2). For total saccharides determination, the pellet is resuspended in 500 μl of distilled water and 500 μl of 5% phenol (3). For glycogen determination, the pellet is resuspended in 400 μl of 30% KOH (4), and the samples are incubated for 60 min at 95 °C to remove free glucose. After incubation, 1.2 ml of precooled ethanol is added (5) for overnight glycogen precipitation at -20 °C.",
    "After precipitation, samples are intensively centrifuged for 60 min, ethanol is discarded, pellet (6) is dried for 60 min under vacuum at 60 °C (7), and glycogen is hydrolyzed to glucose in 100 μl of 1 N HCl (8) at 95 °C. After hydrolysis, the samples are neutralized by addition of 100 μl of 1 N NaOH (9), diluted with 300 μl of distilled water (10) and mixed with 500 μl of 5% phenol (11). For quantification of free glucose, 8 x 60 μl of each sample is transferred to 96-well plate according to scheme in Figure 2 (12), and 150 μl of 96% sulfuric acid is added to each well for chromophores establishing (13). Cellular pellets after intensive centrifugation in ethanol (6) and drying (7) are marked by red arrows. The blue color of sample in step (3), originating in phycobiliproteins, does not influence the spectrophotometric quantification of total carbohydrates content. Preparing samples for determination of total cellular saccharidesSample the culture and extract chlorophyll and carotenoids from the cells as described in Procedure A and B.Add 500 μl of distilled water to each safe-lock tube with cellular pellet and mix well with a pipette.Move to the fume hood.Prepare 5% phenol (w/w) by dissolving 1 g of phenol in 19 ml of distilled water.Add 500 μl of 5% phenol to each safe-lock tube with cellular pellet and 500 μl of distilled water and mix well with a pipette (Figure 1.3).Keep the samples at laboratory temperature for 15 min (phenol will penetrate to the cells).Transfer 8 x 60 μl of each sample to the 96-well plate with a pipette according to the scheme in Figure 2 (positions A4-H12, each sample will have 8 technical replicates, Figure 1.12 and 1.13).",
    "In case of evaluating more than 9 samples, use an additional 96-well plate (Note 3).Continue with Procedure E.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180730/20180730001650_2123.jpgFigure 2. Schematic organization of the 96-well plate for measurement of total saccharides and starch/glycogen content. The first 24 wells (A1-H3) are designated for 6 points of glucose calibration (each calibration point will have 4 technical replicates), the remaining 72 wells (A4-H12) are designated for 9 samples (each sample will have 8 technical replicates).Preparing samples for starch/glycogen content determinationSample the culture and extract chlorophyll and carotenoids from the cells as described in the Procedure A and B.Prepare 30% KOH (w/w) by diluting 6 g of potassium hydroxide in 14 ml of distilled water.After thawing the cellular pellets on ice, add 400 μl of 30% KOH to each safe lock tube with cellular pellets and mix well with a pipette.Seal the safe-lock tubes with the sealing clips (Note 4).Incubate the samples at 95 °C for 90 min to remove free glucose and other alkali-sensitive saccharides (Evans, 1942; Whistler and BeMiller, 1958) (Figure 1.4).Cool down the samples at laboratory temperature for 10 min.Add 1.2 ml of ethanol precooled to 4 °C and mix well with a pipette (Figure 1.5).Store the samples overnight at -20 °C (Note 5).Centrifuge the samples at 4 °C, 20,000 x g for 60 min.Discard ethanol and keep the pellet for further analysis (Note 6, Figure 1.6).Dry the remaining ethanol under vacuum at 60 °C for 60 min (Figure 1.7).Add 100 μl of 1 N HCl to the dry pellet and mix well with a pipette (Figure 1.8).Seal the safe-lock tubes with the sealing clips (Note 4).Incubate the samples at 95 °C for 30 min to hydrolyze starch/glycogen.Cool down the samples at laboratory temperature for 10 min.",
