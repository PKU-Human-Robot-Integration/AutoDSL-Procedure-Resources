    "All the protocols and amendment(s) or procedures involving the care and use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Crown Bioscience Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) prior to conducting the studies. The care and use of animals was conducted in accordance with AAALAC (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) International guidelines as reported in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council (2011). All animal experimental procedures were under sterile conditions at SPF (specific pathogen-free) facilities and conducted in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from different government institutions (e.g., The National Institutes of Health). The protocols were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments at the facility institution (e.g., institutional IACUC Committee).\n1. Preparation for tumor transplantation\nAnimal housing\nHouse Balb/c nude mice (n=5) in individual ventilated cages, at 20-26 °C, 30-70% humidity, and a lighting cycle of 12-h light/12-h dark, with corn cob bedding changed weekly, and irradiation sterilized dry granule food plus sterile drinking water ad libitum.\nDonor tumor fragment preparation\nClosely monitor tumor-bearing donor mice for body weight (BW, via weighing balance), and tumor volume (TV, by caliper measurement).\nWhen TV reaches 800-1000 mm3, euthanize the tumor-bearing animals in a biohazard hood.\n\t\t\nPlace mice in a euthanasia chamber with a lid that delivers CO2 gas into the chamber. Discharge gas into the chamber at a flow rate that produces rapid unconsciousness with minimal distress to the animal. The optimum flow rate for CO2 is around 2-2.5 Lpm.\nEnsure euthanasia by observing that the animals do not regain consciousness.\nAfter apparent clinical death, maintain gas flow for >1 min to minimize the possibility that an animal may recover.",
    "Sterilize the skin around the tumor using iodophor swabs. Collect tumors by removing adjacent non-tumor tissues and placing in a Petri dish containing 20 mL of PBS, pre-chilled (4 °C) prior to euthanasia.\nWash the tumors with PBS in another Petri dish to remove blood components followed by cutting in half and removing any extra skin, blood vessels, calcification and/or necrosis.\nPlace only intact tumor pieces into a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube with 20 mL of PBS, prior to transporting to a separate animal room for transplantation.\n2. Subcutaneous tumor growth\nSubcutaneous inoculation of tumor piece into immunocompromised mice\nCut the PDX tumor into 2 mm pieces with a scalpel, and place each into trocars for subcutaneous (SC) implantation.\nAnesthetize the recipient animals with 5% isoflurane (maintained by a nose cone at 1%). The animals relax, losing their righting reflex and eventually becoming immobile and unresponsive to pain. Fix the anesthetized mice onto an experiment board in the right lateral position and sterilize with iodophor swabs, particularly the areas surrounding the site of tumor inoculation.\nOn left flank skin just cranial to the hip, make a 0.5 cm incision with a scalpel and create a tunnel under the skin towards the forelimb, 2-3 cm, using blunt forceps.\nAseptically transfer one cube of tumor fragment per inoculation site from the medium and place deep inside the subcutaneous tunnel. Visually confirm position of the fragment prior to closure of wound with wound clips.\nMonitor the tumor implanted mice (5) until they become conscious to maintain sternal recumbence, and then return them to their cage only after their full recovery from anesthesia.\nTumor-bearing mice health monitoring\nCheck water and food consumption daily and record body weight weekly.",
    "Check the mice during routine monitoring. Record any effects on mobility, breathing, grooming and general appearance, food and water consumption, BW gain/loss, ascites, etc.\nMeasure TV twice weekly using calipers and express in mm3 per: TV = 0.5 a × b2, where a and b are the length and width of the tumor, respectively.\nSacrifice animals to collect samples when any of the following signs appear: BW loss >20%; impaired mobility (not able to eat or drink); unable to move normally due to significant ascites or enlarged abdomen; effort in respiration; death.\n3. Necropsy and tumor harvest\nWhen tumor volume reaches 200-800 mm3, euthanize mice per approved protocols (see step 1.2.2).\nCollect tumor tissues by removing adjacent non-tumor tissues, followed by placing the tissue in a 50 mL plastic tube with AD+++ (on ice) before dissociation.\n4. Preparation for PDX-derived organoid culture\nNOTE: All the following steps were performed inside a biosafety cabinet per tissue culture standard guidelines. Keep pre-warmed stocks of 96-, 24-, and 6-well plates in a 37 °C incubator before use.\nReagent preparations\n\t\nPrepare basement membrane extract (BME) solution (growth factor reduced, Phenol Red-free). Keep 10 mL of BME in a 4 °C refrigerator overnight. Once thawed, swirl the BME bottle to ensure dispersion.\nPrepare base media/washing buffer AD+++. Add 5 mL of 200 mM L-glutamine, 1 M HEPES and Pen/Strep to Advanced DMEM/F12 media by pipetting with a 5 mL pipette.\nPrepare colon organoid medium as described by Sato et al.18 through supplementing base media with N-Ac (1 mM), A83-01 (500 nM), B27 (1x), EGF (50 ng/mL), Noggin (100 ng/mL), Nicotinamide (10 mM), SB202190 (10 nM), R-spondin (500 ng/mL), L-glutamine (2 mM), HEPES (10 µM), penicillin-streptomycin (1x) and Y-27623 (10 µM)19.",
    "Prepare AD+++Digestion medium: 10 mL of 1x organoid culture media with 500 µL of collagenase type II (20 mg/mL) and 10 µL of RhoKI Y-27632 (10 mM).\nTumor Dissociation20\nTransfer the tumor in a 50 mL plastic tube to a 10 cm Petri dish. Take a macroscopic photograph alongside a ruler and record a description of its conditions (i.e., size, fat tissues, vascularisation, necrosis, etc.).\nRemove excess AD+++ by aspiration, and cut the tumor tissue into small pieces by scissors followed by transferral of 1-2 pieces into a 2 mL microtube for snap freezing on dry ice. Store at -80 °C for genomic profiling. Mince the remaining pieces into finer pieces by scissors before transferral to a 50 mL plastic tube using AD+++.\nWash minced tissue 2-3 times by 35 mL of AD+++, followed by addition of 10 mL of digestion medium (see step 4.1.4) and placement on an orbital shaker at 4 x g for 1 h at 37 °C.\nHomogenize the digested tissue by pipetting up and down using a 5 mL sterile plastic pipette, followed by addition of 20 mL of AD+++ and filtration by 100 µm cell strainer.\nWash the pass-through twice with AD+++ (spin at 450 x g for 5 min), followed by resuspension in BME (add 4x volume of BME to the pellet for suspension) and keep on ice19.\nPreparation of organoid culture\n\t\nAdd the BME cell suspension into 6-well plate in multiple drops to a total of 200 µL per well.\nTransfer the plate to a 37 °C incubator. After 30 min, the gel drops solidify.\nAdd 2 mL of organoid media to each well, with the representative drops recorded by microscopic photography before transferring to an incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2).",
    "Maintain the organoid cultures with medium change every 3-4 days, and passage at a 1:2 ratio every 7 days or depending on their growth and density.\n5. Histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis\nHistopathology\n\t\nCollect organoids from the well with the existing medium using a P1000 pipette, followed by centrifugation (spin at 450 x g for 5 min), washing with PBS and fixation in 10% formalin for 1 h.\nPlace the fixed organoids in 100% gelatin at the bottom of 50 mL conical tube, followed by routine tissue processing and embedding.\nPerform haematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining using standard protocols on 4 mm paraffin sections.\nRNAseq and whole exome sequencing\n\t\nCollect organoids from the well with the existing culture medium using a P1000 pipette, followed by centrifugation using a microcentrifuge at maximum speed (12,000 x g) for 5 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the pellet by removing the medium supernatant to ensure no visible BME was present, followed by snap freezing in a microtube (dry ice) and then transfer to a -80 °C freezer.\nExtract RNA or DNA using standard procedure from manufacturers and perform NGS analysis for both RNAseq and whole exome sequencing (WES).\n6. IC50 assay20\nOrganoid seeding in 384-well plate for IC50 assay\n\t\nDissociate organoids in BME drops from each well (digesting BME) by adding 20 µL of 100x dispase solution to each well (6-well plate), which contained 2 mL of organoid medium, followed by 30 min of incubation at 37 °C.\nPipette digested organoids from all wells through a 70 µm filter into a 50 mL plastic tube to collect the organoids.\nCount the organoids under microscopy for the determination of organoid concentration. Suspend the organoids using culture medium, before adding BME to reach final concentration of 5% (v/v) on ice.",
    "Add 50 µL of the organoid suspension into each 384-well plate with the liquid dispenser, according to the plate map with a seeding density of 200 CR2110 PDXOs per well in corresponding organoid culture medium.\nCisplatin and irinotecan treatment\n\t\nUse cisplatin (with the highest concentration of 100 µM) and “irinotecan” (with the highest concentration of 10 µM). Add SN-38 (a metabolite of irinotecan, as opposed to irinotecan which is usually used for in vivo studies) to each well according to the drug dilution scheme for 9 doses, in serial dilution by digital dispener.\nCreate the platemap using the digital dispenser software tool. Include a negative control vehicle with 100% viability and postive control of 5 µM staurosporine, which showed 0% viability.\nPlace the drug-treated 384-well plates back into 37 °C incubator.\nDetermination of organoid cell viability after drug treatment\n\t\nAt the end of the 5 days of drug treatment, determine organoid cell viability using luminescent cell viability reagents as per the manufacturer’s recommended procedure. Add luminescent reagent into each well with the liquid dispener and mix for 5 min on a plate shaker, followed by a 30 min incubation at room temperature in dark.\nRecord the luminescent signal on a luminescence multi-well plate reader.\nCalculate the normalized viabilities of each well using the raw readings from the plate reader and create a dose-response curve and IC50 values by nonlinear curve fitting.\nSubscription Required.
