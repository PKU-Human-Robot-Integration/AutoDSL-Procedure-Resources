    "1. Calculate Mass of PDMS and Additives\nUse the following equation to find the mass of PDMS needed for specific heights in the following procedures,\n\tM = ϱ*V = ϱ * Height*Area          (1),\n\twhere 'Height' is the height of the layer, 'Area' is the area of a container that the PDMS will be cured in, 'ϱ' is the density of the mixture and 'V' is the volume.\n\tNOTE: Densities for height calculations are PDMS = 0.965 g/mL, Ni-PDMS = 1.639 g/mL, MB-PDMS = 0.648 g/mL.\nUse equation (1) to estimate the mass of PDMS needed, for a given container, to obtain a specific height (5 mm) for the base of the biological actuator. The resulting density of PDMS is 0.965 g/mL.\n\tNOTE: The ratio is 10:1 base to curing agent by weight.\n\tMbase = ϱ*V = ϱ*V*(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55642/55642eq1.jpg)          (2)\n\tMcuring agent = ϱ*V = ϱ*V*(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55642/55642eq2.jpg)\nUse equation (1) to find the mass of Ni-PDMS needed, for a given container, to obtain a specific height (1.5 mm) of the bottom base of the biorobot.\n\tNOTE: The ratios are 1:1.88 (Nickel Powder to PDMS by weight) and 1:1.71:0.171 (Nickel Powder to PDMS Base to PDMS curing agent by weight). The resulting density of Ni-PDMS will be 1.639 g/mL.\n\tMNickel = ϱ*V = ϱ*V*(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55642/55642eq3.jpg)          (3)\n\tMbase = ϱ*V = ϱ*V*(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55642/55642eq4.jpg)\n\tMcuring agent = ϱ*V = ϱ*V*(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55642/55642eq5.jpg)\nSimilarly, use equation (1) to find the mass of MB-PDMS needed, for a given container, to obtain a specific height (3.5 mm) of the top base of the biorobot.\n\tNOTE: The ratios are 1:5 (microballoons to PDMS by weight) and 1:4.54:0.454 (microballoons to PDMS base to PDMS curing agent by weight). The resulting density of MB-PDMS will be 0.648 g/mL.\n\tMMicroballoon = ϱ*V = ϱ*V*(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55642/55642eq6.jpg)          (4)\n\tMbase = ϱ*V = ϱ*V*(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55642/55642eq7.jpg)\n\tMcuring agent = ϱ*V = ϱ*V*(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55642/55642eq8.jpg)",
    "Check the dynamic stability of the biorobot with the desired dimension and geometry using the analysis scripts; see the supplementary information, 'Biorobot_dynamic_stability.m' and 'CG_CB_calculation.m'.\n2. Fabrication of Biological Actuators on a Stationary Base\nNOTE: See Figure 1a.\nSpin-coat a thin film of PDMS (see Figure 1a-1 and a2). The thickness of the resulting PDMS film will be 25 µm.\nPlace a silicon wafer on a photoresist spinner and flip the pump switch on to produce suction.\n\t\tNOTE: The silicon wafer has a 4-inch diameter and 500 µm thickness.\nPour positive photoresist (e.g. S1808) onto the silicon wafer until the wafer is completely covered. Program the spinner to spin at 2,000 rpm for 20 s. Then, engage the spinner by pressing on the foot pedal. Turn off the suction after spinning.\nHeat a hot plate up to 120 °C. Use wafer tweezers to pick up the silicon wafer from the spinner and place the silicon wafer directly on the hotplate. Cover the wafer with a shallow petri dish and bake for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: An oven can be used to bake the wafer using the same temperature and duration. Figure 1a-1 depicts this process.\nPlace a plastic container on a weighing scale and zero it out. Pour 6 g of PDMS base into the container and add 0.6 g of PDMS curing agent. Mix the PDMS thoroughly for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: After mixing, the mixture should be confluent with bubbles.\nPlace the container of mixed PDMS into a vacuum chamber. Reduce the pressure of the vacuum chamber to 100 mbar and leave the container in the chamber for 30 min. Break the vacuum, and remove the container. Keep the container covered until use.",
    "Place the silicon wafer with the baked photoresist layer on the spinner. Slowly pour the entire degassed PDMS mixture on the wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: Pour slowly so that no new bubbles are introduced into the mixture.\nSet the spinner to 1,200 rpm for 5 min. Turn on the spinner suction and engage the spinner. Turn off the suction after spinning.\n\t\tNOTE: These settings result in a 25 µm thick layer of PDMS.\nHeat an oven to 40 °C. Use wafer tweezers to pick up the silicon wafer from the spinner, then place it in the oven. Bake the wafer overnight and then cool the wafer at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Figure 1a-2 depicts this process.\nLaser engraving of the thin-film PDMS layer.\nTurn on the power switch of the laser engraver and its exhaust. Turn on the computer connected to the laser engraver. Open the laser engraver software.\nUnder the \"File\" option, open the biological actuator design file shown in Figure 2e.\n\t\t\nPress the \"Settings\" button. Click on \"Blue\" and change the power setting to 3% and speed to 4%. Click “Set”. Click on \"Black\" and change the \"Mode\" to skip. Then click “Set”. Do the same for \"Red\". Press the \"Apply\" button to finish the settings.”\nPush the \"Activate the Engraver\" button at the top right.\nPress the \"Relocate\" button to move the design into the center of the software's screen.\nPress the \"Focus View\" button in the program and click on the edge of the biorobot on the screen. This will move the guiding laser dot of the laser engraver to the corresponding point.\nMove the wafer manually with tweezers, so that the point on the wafer corresponding to the point clicked in 2.2.4 is directly under the guiding laser dot.",
    "Press the \"Start engraving the prior job\" button to start the engraving process. Remove the wafer after the engraving is completed. Turn off all equipment.\n\t\tNOTE: The \"Start engraving the prior job\" button is the large green triangle. Do not look directly at the engraving process as the laser can damage the eyes. Figure 1a-3 depicts this process.\nPreparation and fabrication of the biological actuator base.\nPour glass beads (3 mm diameter) into a 15 mL tube. Immerse the beads with 70% ethanol in DI water for 24 h. Remove the ethanol and fill the tube with DI water for 24 h. Pour out the DI water and place the tube on a hotplate at 50 °C to facilitate drying of the glass beads.\nAdd 3 g to the amount of PDMS found in equation (1) to account for the PDMS that will stick to container sides during pouring. Use equation (2) to find PDMS base and curing agent amounts.\nPlace a plastic container on a weighing scale and zero it out. Pour the amount of PDMS base found in step 2.3.2 into the container and zero it out. Then pour the amount of PDMS curing agent found in step 2.3.2 into the container.\nMix the PDMS thoroughly for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: PDMS is used at a ratio of 10:1 base to curing agent. The mixture should have many bubbles.\nPlace a container to be used for baking on a scale and zero out. Carefully pour out the correct amount of PDMS found in step 2.3.2 (and mixed in step 2.3.4) into the container. Drop cleaned glass beads throughout the PDMS mixture at regular intervals. Leave a minimum of 5 mm of space surrounding each bead for the biological actuator base.",
    "Place the container into a vacuum chamber. Reduce the vacuum pressure to 100 mbar and turn off the vacuum pump. After 30 min, break the vacuum and remove the container. Keep covered until use.\n\t\tNOTE: The pressure in the chamber may rise slowly over time as the mixture degasses and the vacuum chamber leaks. If the pressure increases substantially over 100 mbar, turn on the vacuum pump to restore the pressure to 100 mbar.\nHeat a hotplate to 40 °C. Carefully place the container of PDMS and the glass beads on the hot plate. Cover the container and bake overnight.\nBiological actuator assembly.\n\tNOTE: The following procedure can be done with the naked eye.\n\t\nCut cubes (5 mm x 5 mm x 5 mm) out of the bulk PDMS made in part 2.3 using a razor blade.\n\t\tNOTE: One bead should be in the center of each cube.\nClean all sides of each biological actuator base, to remove any contaminates on the base surfaces, by pressing the base into the tape and remove. Repeat for each side.\nRedo steps 2.3.2 to 2.3.6 to make a small amount of liquid PDMS. Dip the tip of a needle into the liquid PDMS. Place a drop of the liquid PDMS on the engraved base area of the wafer patterned in step 2.2. Smear the droplet of PDMS so that it completely covers the 5 mm x 5 mm base area.\n\t\tNOTE: The base area is the middle square section in Figure 2a.\nUse tweezers to place the cleaned cube from step 2.4.2 on the base area that is covered with liquid PDMS.\nRepeat step 2.4.3 from \"Place a drop of liquid PDMS\" to the end and step 2.4.4 for each device that will be made.",
    "Heat a hotplate to 40 °C. Carefully place the silicon wafer with the assemblies on the hot plate. Cover the wafer and bake overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the assemblies attached until use. Figure 1a-4 depicts the final device.\n3. Fabrication of Biorobots (Figure 1b)\nSpin-coating and laser-engraving a thin PDMS film\nRepeat all steps in 2.1 and 2.2 using a new silicon wafer. This will result in a silicon wafer with a thin film of PDMS and a thin film of the photoresist, which is engraved with a biorobot design.\n\t\tNOTE: While repeating step 2.2, use the biorobot design for laser engraving instead of the biological actuator design previously used. Figures 1b-1 and b-3 depicts these processes.\nPreparation and fabrication of PDMS composites.\n\tNOTE: The following procedure can be done with the naked eye.\n\t\nPour phenolic microballoons into a 50 mL tube until full. Fill the tube with 70% ethanol in DI-water and let it sit for 24 h. Pour out the ethanol, add DI water, and let it sit for 24 h. Pour out the DI water, and then place the tube on a hotplate at 50 °C to facilitate the drying of the microballoons before use.\nUse equation (1) with the MB-PDMS density and 3.5 mm height to find the volume of PDMS required. Add 3 g to the total amount, to account for the material that will remain in the container after pouring. Use equation (3) to find the PDMS base and curing agent amounts. Measure out the appropriate amount of PDMS base, curing agent, and microballoons using the scale.",
    "Use equation (1) with Ni-PDMS density and 1.5-mm height to find the volume of PDMS needed. Add 3 g to the total amount as in step 3.2.2. Use equation (2) to find the PDMS base and curing agent amounts. Measure out the appropriate amount of PDMS base, curing agent, and nickel powder using the scale.\nMix each mixture of MB-PDMS and Ni-PDMS for 5 min. Carefully pour the correct amount of MB-PDMS and Ni-PDMS calculated in 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 into separate containers using a scale.\n\t\tNOTE: The mixtures should be thoroughly mixed by a metal or glass rod without scratching the bottom surface of the mixing container. The mixture will be confluent with bubbles.\nPlace both containers into a vacuum chamber. Reduce its pressure to 100 mbar for 30 min. Break the vacuum and remove the containers. Keep covered until use.\nHeat a hotplate to 40 °C. Place containers with MB-PDMS and Ni-PDMS on the hot plate. Cover each container and bake overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: Store with a lid until use.\nBiorobot assembly.\nCut biorobot bases of dimensions respective to each biorobot size from Ni-PDMS and MB-PDMS using a razor blade. See Figure 2b-2d for base designs.\n\t\tNOTE: The thicknesses of Ni-PDMS is 1.5 mm and that of MB-PDMS is 3.5 mm.\nClean all sides of the biorobot bases to remove any contaminants on the surfaces, by pressing the base into the tape and removing. Repeat for each side.\nTurn on a corona discharger. Bring the tip of the corona discharger 1 cm above the Ni-PDMS base, which is placed on a metal plate with a cleanroom tissue in between. Move the tip around the base and continue for 15 s to treat the surface.",
    "NOTE: A discharge should occur between the corona discharger and the wafer. If it does not, bring the tip closer until a discharge occurs.\nRepeat step 3.3.3 to treat the surface of the base of a biorobot engraved in step 3.1 for the same duration. Use tweezers to place the Ni-PDMS treated side onto the treated side of the film. Let the device sit for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: This will strongly bond the two parts. See Figure 1b4.\nUse sharp tweezers to peel the biorobot cantilever from the wafer and place it on the bottom of the Ni-PDMS base. Use tweezers to remove the entire assembly from the wafer.\n\t\tNOTE: The cantilever will be attached to the Ni-PDMS base. Figure 1b-5 and b-6 depicts this.\nPlace a small drop of uncured PDMS (10:1 base to curing agent) on the top of the MB-PDMS base. Use tweezers to place the side of the Ni-PDMS with the thin film PDMS on the MB-PDMS with the uncured PDMS. Place the assembly in a plastic petri dish, and then place this on a hotplate at 40 °C to cure overnight.\nNOTE: Figure 1b-7 depicts the final device.\n4. Functionalization of the Devices\nNOTE: Below, we describe the process of preparing the devices for cell seeding.\nPrepare the required materials: Fibronectin solution (50 µg/mL), Phosphate Buffer Saline solution (PBS), Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin antibiotic (DMEM complete).\nPlace 100 µL of fibronectin solution into the center of a T-25 culture flask (bottom surface when the flask is sitting upright). Maintain separate flasks for each device.",
    "Place the biorobot or the biological actuator facing down over the droplet of fibronectin solution. Ensure that the cantilever is unfolded and immersed within the droplet. Incubate at 37 ℃ for 30 min.\nAfter the incubation, remove the fibronectin solution and wash with PBS twice.\nRemove the PBS and fill the flask with 10 mL of DMEM. Incubate at 37 ℃ for 1 h to facilitate degassing of the PDMS. To submerge the biorobots in 10 mL of media, use a magnet to hold the device at the bottom of the flask. Place the flask with the samples in an ultrasonication bath for 5 min to remove the bubbles.\n\tNOTE: During the incubation period, air bubbles form on the PDMS surface, which is referred to as degassing here. The Ni-PDMS used in the biorobot assembly is magnetic. The biological actuator does not need a magnet because it will remain at the bottom of the flask due to the weight of the glass bead. The biorobot or the biological actuator assembly is now ready for seeding, which is explained in detail in part 2.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
