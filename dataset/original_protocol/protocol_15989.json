    "To capture biologically relevant interactions, the AirID fusion protein must mimic the native bait protein. This protocol describes the generation of fusion constructs with your protein of interest (the bait) and the AirID enzyme. Fusion proteins must be validated with respect to biotin ligase function as well as the function of the bait protein (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0001]). Perturbations in localization and/or functionality of the bait due to fusion with the AirID enzyme may increase artifactual results, decreasing the relevance of identified PPIs. The protocol requires basic molecular cloning, DNA transfection, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining techniques along with any additional techniques specific to assaying for the function of your protein of interest.\nMaterials\nExpression plasmid for bait protein of interest\nAirID gene (Addgene plasmid #182210; also see Supplemental Files in Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0003])\nDNA plasmid purification kit of choice (e.g., PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System, Promega, cat. no.

Codon choice and other transcript features may be altered to ensure optimal expression in your system. See Supplemental Files in Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#support-information-section] for the DNA sequence encoding AirID codon-optimized for Homo sapiens.\n1. Use a molecular cloning technique of your choice to fuse AirID to the bait protein in an appropriate expression vector. For example, in our work, we chose to generate N-terminal and C-terminal fusions of AirID onto our bait protein and included V5 epitope tags for ease of protein detection (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0002]). An overview of molecular cloning strategies is available at https://www.addgene.org/mol-bio-reference/cloning/[href=https://www.addgene.org/mol-bio-reference/cloning/].\nDepending on your bait protein of interest, you may need to test multiple fusion protein variants to find a construct design that yields optimal protein function and stability.\nConsiderations when designing and cloning your AirID fusion construct(s) include:\n         \nBased on what is known about bait protein function, is it preferable to fuse AirID to the N- or the C-terminus of the bait protein? Have other fusion proteins been described in the literature to serve as models for the fusion protein design (e.g., protein of interest fused to a fluorescent protein)?\nEpitope tag(s) can be incorporated on the bait or AirID domains and may be useful for downstream detection of your fusion protein by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.\nThe length and flexibility of the linker between AirID and the bait protein will impact protein function and the labeling radius.",
    "Ensure that sequences encoding bait, AirID, and epitope tag(s) remain in the same reading frame.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0492e6a9-660d-4f3d-bc24-4a4f8311da21/cpz1702-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nExample data for Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0001] using human interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) as bait.

Biotinylated proteins (top), ectopically expressed proteins (middle), and a loading control (bottom) are separately detected. * = Endogenous biotinylated proteins of 72, 75 and 130 kDa visible in lysate containing unfused bait protein. (C) Immunofluorescence assay of HEK 293T cells expressing unfused bait, AirID subcellular localization control, or AirID fused to the N- or C-terminus of a bait protein. Scale bar = 10 μm.\n2. Generate an unfused AirID that localizes to the same subcellular compartment(s) as the bait to serve as a control for baseline AirID labeling. Create this subcellular localization control plasmid in the same vector backbone as your fusion construct. Determine the subcellular localization of the bait protein (via literature search or experimentally by immunofluorescence assays or subcellular cell fractionation), and add a corresponding subcellular localization signal to the AirID sequence (e.g., nuclear localization signal, nuclear export signal, mitochondrial targeting sequence, etc.).\nThis construct will be used to establish background biotinylation levels resulting from non-specific biotinylation by an unfused AirID enzyme in the same subcellular location as the bait.\n3. Sequence plasmids to confirm the accuracy of the cloning procedure.\nWe recommend full-plasmid sequencing if the plasmid backbone was amplified by PCR during cloning.",
    "4. Prepare transfection-quality plasmids using a DNA plasmid purification kit of your choice.\nAssess AirID biotin ligase function\nThe goal of this part of the protocol is to confirm that the AirID portion of your fusion protein retains biotin ligase enzymatic activity. To assess biotin ligase function, fusion proteins are expressed in cells for a sufficient duration to allow robust biotinylation to occur, then biotinylated proteins are detected in cell lysates by western blot. This is essentially a scaled-down version of the ultimate proximity biotinylation experiment.\n5. Seed a 6-well tissue culture plate (one well per condition) with 5 × 105 HEK 293T cells in 500 µl DMEM with 10% FBS per well. Allow cells to grow to ∼80% confluency. For example, to generate the data shown in Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0002], 4 wells were seeded to accommodate the subcellular localization control condition (V5-AirID-NES), a negative-control condition with unfused bait protein (IFIT2-V5), and two experimental conditions consisting of AirID-fused bait proteins (V5-AirID-IFIT2 and IFIT2-AirID-V5).\nUse cells at low passage (∼2-5 passages) for best results.\nSeeding density may need to be adjusted depending on your particular cells and tissue-culture reagents.\n6. Transfect each well with appropriate plasmids for each condition using jetPRIME per manufacturer's instructions. Include the subcellular localization control condition (AirID without bait) and a negative-control condition with unfused bait protein.\nIn a 6-well plate format, we use 2 μg total DNA with 4 μl of jetPRIME reagent. Ensure that each well receives the same total mass of DNA. Use empty expression-vector plasmid as filler DNA, as needed.\nAn alternative transfection reagent may be used; adjust the tissue culture and transfection conditions accordingly.\nOptional: Immediately prior to transfection, remove spent medium and replace with medium supplemented with biotin to 50 μM.",
    "Consider assessing different levels of biotin supplementation to optimize biotinylation. 50 μM is commonly used, but biotin concentrations ranging from 0 μM to 500 μM may be tested.\n7. At 24 hr post-transfection, carefully remove the media from each well and gently wash once with cold DPBS (∼500 µl per well) to remove excess biotin. Proceed directly to cell lysis or seal the plate with microplate sealing tape and store at −80°C until ready to lyse cells.\n24 hr is typically sufficient to detect robust biotinylation. Because AirID is generally well-tolerated by cells, the duration of this transient overexpression may be altered as needed to better suit the study of your biological process of interest.\nIf exogenous biotin supplementation was not used, the wash step may be omitted.\n8. Lyse cells in co-IP lysis buffer. Add 500 μl co-IP lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail to each well. Rock plates 20-30 min at 4°C, transfer lysates to microcentrifuge tubes, and clarify lysates by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, 4°C. Transfer supernatants to fresh tubes.\nCo-IP lysis buffer works well for accessing cytoplasmic proteins. Depending on the subcellular localization of your protein(s) of interest, harsher lysis buffer conditions may be required (e.g., a RIPA lysis buffer to access nuclear proteins).\nGenerally, clarified lysates may be stored at −20°C for medium-term storage (on the order of days-weeks) and −80°C for long-term storage. Biotinylation is typically stable over the course of multiple freeze-thaw cycles, but this should be avoided to preserve the integrity of any unknown prey proteins that may be prone to degradation.\n9. Perform western blotting according to Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0003] to detect biotinylated proteins in the lysates and to assess expression and stability of the AirID fusion proteins (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0002]).\nAssay for bait protein function",
    "In addition to confirming that the AirID portion of the fusion protein retains function, it is important to confirm that the bait protein also remains functional despite fusion to the AirID enzyme. Relevant assays will be specific to your protein of interest, but if an established functional assay for the bait protein is available, use this to assess activity of the fusion protein compared to unfused bait protein.\nAssess subcellular localization by immunofluorescence assays\nThe goal of this part of the protocol is to visualize the impact of fusion to AirID on the subcellular localization of the bait protein. Cells are seeded onto glass coverslips, transfected with plasmids to express AirID fusion or control proteins, then fixed and stained to assess protein subcellular localization and biotinylation by immunofluorescence microscopy. The general tissue culture conditions and transfection protocol are very similar to the protocol above for assessing biotin ligase activity (note similarities to steps 5 and 6 above), but here cells are seeded onto glass coverslips to facilitate downstream microscopy.\n10. Place a fibronectin-coated glass coverslip at the bottom of each well of a 6-well plate (one well per condition), then seed with 5 × 105 HEK 293T cells in 500 µl DMEM with 10% FBS per well. Allow cells to grow to ∼60% confluency. For example, to generate the data shown in Figure 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0002], 5 wells were seeded to accommodate an empty-vector control condition to establish background signal, the subcellular localization control condition (V5-AirID-NES), a negative-control condition with unfused bait protein (IFIT2-V5), and two experimental conditions consisting of AirID-fused bait proteins (V5-AirID-IFIT2 and IFIT2-AirID-V5).",
    "Note that the desired confluency here is lower than that for assaying biotin ligase function in step 5 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0001]. Cell density needs to be high enough to enable efficient transfection, but a lower cell density facilitates clear visualization of subcellular compartments by microscopy.\nUse cells at low passage (∼2-5 passages) for best results.\nSeeding density may need to be adjusted depending on your particular cell type and tissue-culture reagents.\nOther cell lines, such as HeLa cells, may be used as an alternative to HEK 293T cells, if desired, to provide better resolution of subcellular compartments.\n11. Transfect each well with appropriate DNA for each condition using jetPRIME per manufacturer's instructions. Include the following control conditions: empty vector control to establish background signal, unfused bait protein (bait without AirID), and the subcellular localization control (AirID without bait).\nIn a 6-well plate format, we use 2 μg total DNA with 4 μl of jetPRIME reagent. Ensure that each well receives the same total mass of DNA. Use empty expression-vector plasmid as filler DNA, as needed.\nAn alternative transfection reagent may be used; adjust the tissue culture and transfection conditions accordingly.\nOptional: Immediately prior to transfection, remove spent medium and replace with medium supplemented with biotin to 50 μM.\nConsider assessing different levels of biotin supplementation to optimize biotinylation. 50 μM is commonly used, but biotin concentrations ranging from 0 μM to 500 μM may be tested.\n12. At 24 hr post-transfection, carefully remove the medium from each well and wash gently with cold DPBS (∼500 µl per well) to remove excess media and free biotin.\nUsing cold DPBS helps end the biotin ligation reaction to avoid spurious labeling.",
    "24 hr is typically sufficient to see robust biotinylation. The duration of this transient overexpression may be altered as needed to better suit study of your biological process of interest.\n13. Carefully transfer coverslips to a fresh 6-well plate.\nTo aid in removing the coverslip from the dish, safely bend the tip of a needle (e.g., 18-20 gauge) to create a small “hook” that can be used to help lift the coverslip. Then, use forceps to gently grasp the coverslip for transfer.\nTransfer the coverslips such that the cell layer is facing upwards.\n14. Fix and permeabilize cells in a cold 1:1 solution of acetone and methanol for 15 min at −20°C.\nThis achieves cell fixation and permeabilization simultaneously.\nDepending on the particular target protein and antibodies being used for labeling, fixation and permeabilization solutions may need to be adjusted to preserve epitope integrity. If needed, consider fixing in a formaldehyde solution and permeabilizing in a Triton X-100 solution.\n15. Wash once briefly in cold DPBS. Add enough DPBS to each well to completely cover the coverslips. Then, perform two further washes, rocking at 4°C for ∼5 min per wash.\n16. Block in 1%-3% BSA in DPBS. Rock for at least 30 min at 4°C.\n17. Remove blocking solution and incubate with fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin and fluorophore-conjugated antibody against the AirID fusion protein(s), each diluted 1:1000 in fresh blocking solution. Rock overnight (∼16 hr) in the dark at 4°C.\nProtect fluorescent reagents from light.\nDepending on the particular antibodies being used for labeling, antibody dilutions and incubation times may require further optimization.\nStaining of the AirID fusion protein(s) may alternatively be achieved by incubating with an appropriate primary antibody followed by incubation with a corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody.\nEnsure that the fluorophores on each detection reagent have sufficiently distinct emission wavelengths.",
    "Do not use biotinylated antibodies as these may be bound by the streptavidin reagent.\n18. Wash once briefly in cold DPBS. Add enough DPBS to each well to completely cover the coverslips. Then perform two further washes, rocking at 4°C for ∼5 min per wash.\nWash times may be extended to reduce background.\n19. Mount coverslips cell-side down on glass microscope slides with a DAPI-containing mounting medium. Seal with nail polish if desired.\n20. Store slides at 4°C, protected from light, until ready to view by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0002]).",
    "SplitAirID allows selective detection of proteins that interact with a higher-order bait complex. This protocol describes the generation of fusion constructs of your protein(s) of interest and the splitAirID enzyme system. As in the case of full-length AirID, these fusion proteins must be validated with respect to biotin ligase function as well as bait protein function and localization. All techniques and experimental workflow for splitAirID are the same as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0001] for full-length AirID but with the inclusion of additional considerations and controls.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0001])\nGenes for AirN and AirC polypeptides (see Supplemental Files in Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#support-information-section])\nGenerate plasmid encoding splitAirID components fused to bait protein(s)\nAirN and AirC sequences, codon-optimized for Homo sapiens, can be found in Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#support-information-section].

Is it preferable to append AirN/AirC to the N- or C-terminus of each bait? Will AirN and AirC be able to interact when the bait proteins dimerize? Is it preferable to fuse the smaller AirN (∼11 kDa) or the larger AirC (∼27 kDa) to a particular bait? It may be necessary to test multiple combinations of N- and C-terminal positioning of AirN and AirC on each bait to find a combination with optimal biotin ligase activity and bait protein function.",
    "The length and flexibility of the linker between AirN/AirC and the bait protein(s) will impact the efficiency of complementation, the labeling radius, and bait protein function. Alter the linkers as necessary to optimize these characteristics (e.g., decrease linker length to increase labeling specificity, use glycine and serine residues to increase linker flexibility, etc.).\nAdding different epitope tags to AirN and AirC may be useful for differentiating the two when co-expressing AirN- and AirC-fused bait(s), but this is not mandatory.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/20f89ee4-f56c-4a76-b8a0-6949f7ce2839/cpz1702-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nExample data for Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0002] using human interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) as bait.

Dilution amounts may need to be optimized to identify the best blotting conditions.\nProbing for multiple targets may be accomplished simultaneously on the same membrane if using antibodies raised in different species.\n9. Wash the membrane 3 times with TBS-Tween (0.1%) for ∼5 min per wash.\n10. Dilute appropriate secondary antibodies in TBS-Tween (0.1%). Incubate the membrane with secondary antibodies for 1-4 hr, rocking, at room temperature.\nThe exact dilution will vary between antibodies, and even between suppliers for the same antibody. Dilution amounts may need to be optimized to identify the best blotting conditions.\nIf desired, the incubation period may be extended to overnight (∼16 hr) at 4°C.\nIf using IR fluorophore-conjugated reagents, protect the fluorophores from light and use clean, dedicated containers to reduce risk of background autofluorescence.\n11. Wash the membrane 3 times with TBS-Tween (0.1%) for ∼5 min per wash.\nIf HRP-conjugated reagents were used, prepare enhanced chemiluminescence substrate and develop the membrane per manufacturer's instructions.\n12. Use a LI-COR or other appropriate western blot imaging system to visualize signal on the blot.",
    "With validated AirID fusion constructs in-hand from Basic (or Alternate) Protocol 1, the full-scale proximity biotinylation experiment may be performed. AirID fusion proteins are transiently expressed and given time to label proteins in proximity with the bait. Biotinylated proteins are purified from cell lysates and identified and quantified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0001]). Ideally, the proximity biotinylation experiment is performed in biological triplicate. This protocol requires techniques in DNA transfection, western blotting, and affinity purification. The validation experiments from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0001] should have already resulted in optimization of conditions such as the proportion of each plasmid in the transfection, duration of incubation after transfection, and the level of exogenous biotin supplementation. If your experiment requires an exogenous stimulus such as interferon induction, infection, drug treatment, etc., optimization of the timing of AirID fusion construct transfection and cell stimulation will also be necessary. This protocol is the same for both the full-length AirID and splitAirID systems.\nMaterials\nExpression plasmids for AirID fusion protein(s) and subcellular localization control (user-generated from Basic/Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0002])\nCell line of choice and appropriate culture medium (HEK 293T, 1× DMEM with 10% FBS)\njetPRIME transfection reagent and buffer (PolyPlus cat.

Biotinylation and AirID fusion protein expression are confirmed by western blot before proceeding to enrichment. The protocol presented here reflects timings and cell numbers that may be used as a starting point but should be adjusted per your own optimizations to suit your biological process of interest.\n1. Seed 10 cm tissue culture dishes (2 dishes per condition) with 4 × 106 HEK 293T cells per dish in DMEM with 10% FBS. Allow cells to grow to ∼80% confluency. For example, to generate data like that shown in Figure 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0004], we set up a subcellular localization control condition (V5-AirID-NES) and a condition with our bait protein of interest fused to AirID (V5-AirID-IFIT2).\nUse cells at low passage number.\nSeeding density may need to be adjusted depending on your particular cells and tissue-culture reagents.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0bbc6d9b-d5ca-4770-b653-1d1c7926e2f1/cpz1702-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
    "Example results of biotin supplementation and silver staining of purified biotinylated protein using IFIT2 as bait. (A) Western blot of lysates from HEK 293T cells expressing a subcellular localization control (V5-AirID-NES), an unfused bait protein (IFIT2-V5), AirID fused to the N-terminus of the bait protein (V5-AirID-IFIT2), or AirID fused to the C-terminus of the bait protein (IFIT2-AirID-V5). Cell culture medium was supplemented with 50 μM biotin where indicated. Biotinylated proteins (top), ectopically expressed proteins (middle), and a loading control (bottom) are separately detected. * = Endogenous biotinylated proteins of 72, 75 and 130 kDa visible in lysate containing unfused bait protein. (B) An AirID-bait fusion protein or AirID subcellular localization control was expressed in HEK 293T cells. Biotinylated proteins were purified from cell lysates with streptavidin resin, eluted, and detected in a gel by silver staining.\n2. Transfect each well with appropriate DNA for each condition using jetPRIME per manufacturer's instructions.\nEnsure that each plate receives the same total mass of DNA. Use empty expression-vector plasmid as filler DNA, as needed.\nAn alternative transfection reagent may be used; adjust the tissue culture and transfection conditions accordingly.\n3. At 18 hr post-transfection, carefully remove the spent media and replace with media supplemented with biotin to 50 μM.\nIf treating cells with an exogenous agent, include this agent in the media along with the biotin.\n4. 24 hr later (at 42 hr post-transfection), carefully remove the media from each dish. Wash gently 5 times with cold DPBS to remove excess biotin and end the labeling reaction. Scrape cells into conical tubes (the duplicate dishes may be pooled at this point) and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and freeze the cell pellets at −80°C.",
    "To avoid excessive loss of cells during washing, the wash steps may be performed directly on the dishes and/or by scraping cells into conical tubes and washing by repeated centrifugation and resuspension in cold DPBS.\n5. Lyse cells in co-IP lysis buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitor cocktail by resuspending each cell pellet in 1200 μl co-IP lysis buffer. Transfer to microcentrifuge tubes and nutate for 20-30 min at 4°C, then clarify by centrifuging 15 min at 15,000 × g, 4°C. Transfer supernatants to fresh tubes. Reserve 800 μl of each clarified lysate for subsequent enrichment.\nIf the supernatant does not appear clear, spin again.\nCo-IP lysis buffer typically works well for accessing cytoplasmic proteins. Depending on the subcellular localization of your protein(s) of interest, harsher lysis buffer conditions may be required.\n6. Use a portion of the remaining lysate to perform western blotting according to Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0003] to detect biotinylated proteins in the lysates and to confirm expression of the AirID fusion proteins. Store the remaining lysate for additional analysis as needed.\nWe advise completing this western blot prior to proceeding since it is only worthwhile to perform the following enrichment protocol if there is clear evidence of successful bait protein expression and biotinylation. See Figures 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0002], 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0003] or 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0004] for examples of successful detection of protein expression and biotinylation for AirID and fusions.\nEnrich for biotinylated proteins\nNext, enrich the samples for biotinylated proteins using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads to pull down biotinylated proteins from each clarified lysate. This section of the protocol yields a concentrated solution of biotinylated proteins that may then be identified by mass spectrometry. The entire protocol should be performed carefully and with sufficient personal protective equipment to reduce keratin contamination from the user.",
    "7. Prepare 200 μl of bead slurry per 800 μl of clarified lysate. Pellet the beads on a magnetic rack and remove the supernatant. Wash the beads in 1.5 volumes of co-IP lysis buffer by nutation. Pellet the beads on a magnetic rack and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the beads in another 1.5 volumes of co-IP lysis buffer to perform a second wash. After the second wash, remove the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 200 μl co-IP lysis buffer per sample.\nThe buffer used here should match the cell lysis buffer used in step 5. Substitute for co-IP lysis buffer in this step as necessary.\nDepending on the particular brand and binding capacity of your beads, the bead:lysate volume ratio may need to be optimized. The original stock of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads used here is provided by the manufacturer at a concentration of 10 mg/ml.\nWe have found that magnetic beads allow for optimal washing and enable complete removal of residual wash buffer prior to elution, a crucial step for efficient recovery of biotinylated proteins. However, if desired, non-magnetic streptavidin-conjugated beads can be used. In this case, each wash step would be done by centrifugation instead of using the magnetic rack.\n8. Add 200 μl of the washed bead suspension to each of the 800 μl samples (the reserved clarified cell lysates from step 5). Nutate overnight (∼16 hr) at 4°C.\n9. Pellet the beads on a magnetic rack. Collect the supernatant and save this flow-through for downstream western blotting (keep samples on ice if performing the western blot same-day or freeze for later use).",
    "10. Perform the following series of washes (adapted from Cho et al., 2020b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-bib-0009]). For each wash, resuspend the beads in the wash solution by shaking vigorously by hand, then incubate at room temperature for the time indicated. Pellet the beads on a magnetic rack, remove the supernatant, and proceed to the next wash step. Care should be taken to closely follow the times indicated for each wash.\n         \nWash once in 1 ml lysis buffer (co-IP or other buffer used in steps 5 and 7).\nWash once in 500 μl lysis buffer + 500 μl RIPA buffer.\nIf RIPA was used as the cell lysis buffer, this step may be omitted.\nWash in 1 ml RIPA buffer. Incubate for 2 min. Repeat this step.\nWash once in 1 ml 1 M KCl. Incubate for 2 min.\nWash once, briefly, in 1 ml 0.1 M Na2CO3. Perform this step as quickly as possible.\nWash once, briefly, in 1 ml 2 M urea in 10 mM Tris·HCl (pH = 8). Perform this step as quickly as possible.\nWash in 1 ml RIPA buffer. Incubate for 2 min. Repeat this step. Remove the final wash completely.\n11. Elute the biotinylated proteins from the beads by adding 40 μl biotin elution buffer. Fully resuspend the beads. Boil at 95°C for 5 min.\nThe use of magnetic streptavidin resin permits complete removal of wash buffers. However, resins pelleted by centrifugation will contain residual wash buffers that will dilute the elution buffer and may affect elution efficiency, especially for the first elution.\n12. Centrifuge 60 s at 12,000 × g to collect sample at the bottom of the tube, then pellet the beads on a magnetic rack. Quickly collect the eluate into a fresh tube.",
    "As the eluate cools, biotinylated proteins may re-bind to the beads. Collect eluate as quickly as possible to maximize yield.\n13. Repeat steps 11-12 to perform a second elution. Combine the first and second eluates.\nVisualize proteins by silver staining\nVisualize proteins in the eluates by silver staining (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-fig-0004]). A commercial silver stain kit may be used as an alternative to the protocol below.\nCAUTION: This method is highly sensitive; use clean containers, use ultrapure water to make solutions, and wear sufficient personal protective equipment to reduce risk of contamination.\n14. Perform denaturing PAGE with 5 μl of each eluate. Mix 5 μl of eluate with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Heat at 95°C for 10 min. Load the entire 10 μl of each denatured sample on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Run PAGE at 200 V until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.\n15. Carefully transfer the gel to a clean container.\nThe stacking gel may be removed for ease of handling.\nTry to only manipulate the gel along the edges; avoid touching regions of the gel containing sample as this may result in unwanted background staining.\nCutting a corner of the gel can create a fiducial mark to help ensure correct orientation of the gel once the silver staining is complete.\n16. Soak the gel in 50% MeOH for 20 min, rocking, at room temperature.\n17. Decant. Soak in 5% MeOH for 20 min, rocking, at room temperature.\n18. Decant. Soak in 33 μM DTT for 20 min, rocking, at room temperature.\n19. Decant. Rinse once, quickly, in water.\n20. Rinse quickly with silver nitrate solution, then incubate in fresh silver nitrate solution for 20 min, rocking, at room temperature.",
    "Observe safe disposal practices for used silver nitrate solution here and in the next step. Silver can be precipitated with an excess of 4 M NaCl and disposed of following locally approved procedures.\n21. Remove the silver nitrate solution. Rinse 3 times, as quickly as possible, with water.\n22. Rinse with a minimal volume of developer (just enough to cover the gel) until the solution turns yellowish in color, then decant and add fresh developer solution. Protein bands will become visible and darken in color as the gel develops. Continue to develop the gel until as dark as desired.\nDeveloper must be freshly prepared. Make developer solution during one of the preceding 20 min incubation periods (steps 16-20).\nKeep a close eye on the gel during development! The gel may slightly destain once development is stopped, but be sure to avoid over-development.\n23. Add solid citric acid monohydrate to stop development. Approximately 5 g of citric acid monohydrate is needed for every 10 ml of developer used in step 22.\nFizzing/bubbling upon addition of solid citric acid monohydrate is normal.\n24. Store gel in water until ready to examine.\n25. Image the gel (use a scanner, photograph over a light source, etc.).\nTo monitor the efficiency of biotin capture, assess the depletion of biotinylated proteins from cell lysates by blotting input lysates (use a portion of the remaining lysate from step 6) and flow-through (from step 9) according to Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.702#cpz1702-prot-0003]. Blot input and flow-through on the same membrane or otherwise ensure that they are visualized under identical exposure conditions such that they can be directly compared with one another.\nIdentify protein interactors by mass spectrometry",
    "If the mass spectrometry will be done by a core facility or other collaborator, discuss the experiment and desired quantitative mass spectrometry method ahead of time in case any additions or modifications to the sample preparation protocol are required to fit into their workflows. A detailed discussion of mass spectrometry parameters is outside the scope of this protocol.\n26. Submit samples for quantitative mass spectrometry.\n27. Identify significant PPIs using a data analysis method appropriate for the type of mass spectrometry performed."
