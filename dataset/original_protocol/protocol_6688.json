    "Equipment setupGas chromatography (GC) set upChromatography: perform chromatography with a 30-m capillary HP-5MS column. Use helium as the carrier gas at a constant pressure of 14 psi. Set the injection port temperature to 240 °C and the transfer line temperature to 280 °C. Samples are run in splitless mode. Use the following temperature program for chromatography as shown in Table 1.Table 1. GC temperature used for profiling norvaline and pipecolic acid imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201201/20201201224521_4893.jpg Mass spectrometer (MS) set upAutomatically tune the instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Sample preparation and analysisFor pathogen assays, the largest three leaves of ~4 weeks old plant are infiltrated with either 10 mM MgCl2 or the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae avrRpt2 using a needleless syringe from the abaxial side of the leaves. After leaf infiltration, remove excess droplets of 10 mM MgCl2 or pathogen suspension with Kimwipes. Figure 2 shows a pot of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 plants just after pathogen infiltration (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201220/20201220185828_4346.jpgFigure 2. A picture of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 plants after infiltration with Pseudomonos syringae expressing avrRpt2. Infiltrated leaves were marked with a white marker.About 24 h later, collect ~100 mg infiltrated leaf tissue. The entire leaf was sampled using a pair of scissors.Weigh the tissue with a balance that is accurate to the 1 mg digit. Record the weight of each sample. ∆CRITICAL STEPPlace the tissue in a microfuge tube, cap the tube, and drop it into a bucket of liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely. •PAUSE POINTGrind the tissue with a plastic pestle.Continue to the next step before the tissue is thawed. CRITICAL STEPAdd 400 µl of extraction buffer.Add 20 µl of internal standard.Vigorously shake for 15 min on a vortexer at room temperature.Centrifuge for 5 min at 18,000 x g.",
    "Supernatant is transferred to a 13 x 100 mm glass test tube. Extract can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely. •PAUSE POINTDry the supernatant with a stream of nitrogen gas. Dried extract can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely. •PAUSE POINTAdd 200 µl of 1 M sodium hydroxide.Add 167 µl of methanol and 34 µl of pyridine.Vortex vigorously and break up any pellets with a Pasteur pipet.Add 20 µl of propyl chloroformate and vigorously vortex for 30 s. Use a glass micro capillary pipette instead of a plastic pipette tip to avoid contamination of plasticizers. CRITICAL STEPAdd another 20 µl of propyl chloroformate and vigorously vortex for 30 s.Add 400 µl of chloroform and vortex vigorously for 10 s.Add 400 µl of µl sodium bicarbonate (50 mM) and vortex vigorously for 10 s.Centrifuge for 2 min with a table-top swing-arm centrifuge at about 80% speed (approximately 1,250 x g).The lower layer is transferred to a new 13 x 100 mm glass test tube with a Pasteur pipet. The lower phase obtained after the transfer is approximately 0.375 ml.Dry the chloroform extract by adding approximately 40 µl of anhydrous sodium sulfate and vortex until clear.Centrifuge for 1 min with a table-top swing-arm centrifuge at about 80% speed (approximately 1,250 x g).Transfer chloroform extract to a GC vial with a Pasteur pipet.Inject 0.5-1 µl to GC/MS for analysis using selective ion monitoring mode (SIM) using quantifier ions 158 and 170 and qualifier ions 72 and 128.GC-MS data from standard compound analysisFigure 3 shows the total ion chromatogram (Figure 3A) and corresponding MS of norvaline (Figure 3B left panel) and Pip (Figure 3B right panel) standards run in scan mode.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3841/bioprotoc-10-23-3841-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "(A) GC-MS total ion chromatogram of equal weight (2 µg each) mixture of L-norvaline (NV) and L-pipecolic acid (Pip) derivatized with propyl chloroformate as described in B using scan mode. L-norvaline, N-propoxycarbonyl, propyl ester (at 8.2 min) and L-pipecolic acid, N-propoxycarbonyl, propyl ester (at 9.9 min) are the two major peaks. The bottom panel (B) shows mass spectra of NV- and Pip-N-propoxycarbonyl propyl esters. The loss of propoxycarbonyl group produces major ions 158 from NV and 170 from Pip derivatives.Figure 4 shows the GC-MS data from standard compound analysis using selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Based on the mass spectra shown in Figure 1, two major ions for each compound were used to monitor NV (158 and 72) and Pip (170, 128) in SIM mode.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3841/bioprotoc-10-23-3841-g004.jpgFigure 4.

NV- (at 8.2 min) and Pip-N-propoxycarbonyl propyl ester (at 9.9 min) are the two major peaks. The bottom panel (B) show mass spectra of NV- and Pip-N-propoxycarbonyl propyl esters in SIM mode selected for the major ions 158.2 and 72.2 (NV) and 172.2 and 128.0 (Pip). The dwell time for each ion was set at 25 ms. The SIM mode was set to monitor ions 158 and 72 in the time interval 7.4-9.1 min and ions 170 and 128 from 9.1-10.5 min. The relative abundance of major and qualifier ions monitored in SIM and scan modes was similar.Pip levels in Arabidopsis leaf tissueGC-MS data for pipecolic acid analysis from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf tissue samples using scan (Figure 5) and SIM (Figure 6) modes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3841/bioprotoc-10-23-3841-g005.jpgFigure 5.",
