    "Seed sterilization and germinationTo analyze the root media alkalinization, seedlings were grown on plates containing half-strength MS medium (see Recipes) for 9 days.Surface sterilize A. thaliana seeds in Eppendorf tubes using 1 ml sodium hypochlorite solution 50% (v/v) for 10 min followed by 5 washes using 1 ml sterile Milli-Q water each. Seeds are washed with the aid of a micropipette (1,000 µl) (Figures 1A).Stratify the sterilized seeds for 72 h at 4 °C in water and then drop in a line using a micropipette (10 µl) on a square plate dish containing half-strength MS medium (Figures 1B-1D).Seal the plates containing the seeds with clear plastic wrap.Incubate the plates vertically in a controlled environmental growth chamber at 22 ± 2 °C, 16 h light (150 μmol m-2 sec-1) and 8 h dark for 9 days (Figure 1E).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180329/20180329235740_8031.jpgFigure 1. Seed sterilization and seedling growth. A. A. thaliana seeds during the surface sterilization procedure with sodium hypochlorite solution 50% (v/v); B. Pipette tip (which has been cut and then autoclaved) containing stratified seeds; C. Stratified seeds being disposed in half-strength MS medium; D. Seeds aligned on a square Petri dish containing half-strength MS medium; F. Arabidopsis seedlings (9 days old) grown in the growth chamber.Gel containing the pH-sensitive indicator bromocresol purplePrepare gel containing the pH-sensitive indicator bromocresol purpleAdd 0.006% (w/v) of bromocresol purple free acid reagent grade (60 mg L-1); 1 mM of CaSO4 (172 mg L-1) in sterile distilled water. Adjust pH to 5.7 using KOH or HCl. Pour the solution into an Erlenmeyer.Add agarose (15 g L-1) into the Erlenmeyer and heat in the microwave until completely dissolved.Pour the melted gel into Petri dishes (150 x 20 mm), 50 ml per dish (approx. 0.4 cm thick), with the aid of a graduated cylinder (100 ml).",
    "The agarose gel is allowed to cool until solidified.

Gel containing bromocresol purple completely dissolved and ready to be poured. G. Gel being poured in a Petri dish. H. Plate containing the solidified gel and ready to receive the seedlings (top view). I. Lateral view of the plate shown in H. Gel should be about 0.4 cm thick and a dark yellow color is expected to allow detection of pH differences.Gently transfer groups of seedlings (6-8) at once onto each Petri dish containing the pH indicator bromocresol purple (pH 5.7) with tweezers (Figures 3A-3B; see Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Seedlings being transferred to Petri dish containing the pH indicator bromocresol purple Once placed in the gel pH-sensitive indicator bromocresol purple, only the roots of the seedling are treated with 10 µl AtRALF1 (10 μM solution) or water (10 µl as a control) (see Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.
