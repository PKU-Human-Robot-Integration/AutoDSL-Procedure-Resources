    "1. Preparations and Culture of Lung Epithelial Cells\nCulture A549 human lung epithelial cells (adherent cell line) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.\nRemove and discard the cell culture media from culture dish, and wash once with 5 - 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After washing, immediately aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 2 ml Trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.05%) and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 min.\nCollect the detached cells in centrifuge tubes containing cell culture medium, centrifuge the tubes at RT for 4 min at 150 × g.\nResuspend the cells pellet in 2 ml of cell culture medium and remove a sample for cell counting. Count the number of the cells using a hemocytometer with Trypan blue stain to check cell viability.\nSeed A549 cells on 10 cm polystyrene plates at a density of 0.5 - 1.0 × 106 cells/dish with 10 ml of medium for gel contraction assay. Seed the cells on 6 well polystyrene plates at a density of 0.5 - 1.0 × 105 cells/well with 2 ml of medium for EMT confirmation. Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 hr.\n2. EMT Procedure\nAdd 10 µl of TGF-β1 (5 µg/ml) and 10 µl of TNF-α (10 µg/ml) to the plate for gel contraction assay seeded in step 1.6. Add 2 µl of TGF-β1 (5 µg/ml) and 2 µl of TNF-α (10 µg/ml) to the plate for EMT confirmation seeded in step 1.6. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 hr.\n3. Confirmation of EMT Procedure by PCR and Western Blotting\nConfirm change in morphology (from cobble stone-like to spindle shape) of treated cells using phase contrast microscopy.",
    "Note: Normal A549 cells have cobble stone-like and triangular shaped appearance that is a characteristic of epithelial cells, but after stimulation with TGF-β1 and TNF-α, the cells appear long and spindle shaped that is similar to mesenchymal cells14,15.\nEvaluate the expression of an epithelial marker, such as E-cadherin, and mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin, vimentin, and α-smooth muscle actin using PCR or Western blotting.\n\t\nExtract total RNA from the cells using RNA extraction kit16 and synthesize cDNA using reverse transcriptase17 according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nMeasure expression of mRNA levels using real time PCR system18 and monomeric cyanine dye PCR kit according to the manufacturers' instructions. The specific primers for GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), ACTA2 (alpha-actin-2), CDH1 (cadherin-1; E-cadherin), and VIM (vimentin) are shown in Table 1.\nLyse the cells using a lysis buffer (Table 2) solution containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail. Measure all sample protein concentrations using a protein assay kit19,20, and apply the same amounts of protein to a polyacrylamide gel.\n\t\t\nPerform SDS gel-electrophoresis and semi-dry transfer of the proteins to PVDF membrane21. Incubate the membrane with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 - 2 hr. After incubation, wash twice the membrane with wash buffer and incubate the membrane 1 hr with second antibodies.\n\t\t\tNote: See the Materials/Equipment Table for antibodies and dilutions used in these studies. See Table 2 for the components of blocking buffer.\nWash the membrane with wash buffer twice. Take pictures of the membrane with the Western blotting detection kit22 using a cold CCD camera11,23.\n4. Gel Contraction Assay for Evaluating EMT\nAspirate the conditioned media from the cell culture vessel, and wash well with 5 - 10 ml of PBS to remove dead cells. After washing, immediately aspirate the PBS.",
    "Add 2 ml of 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 min.\nCollect the detached cells in centrifuge tubes containing DMEM supplemented with trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml), centrifuge the tubes at RT for 4 min at 150 ×g.\nMix type 1 collagen gel with distilled water, and 4× concentrated DMEM to adjust the volumes to achieve a collagen concentration of 1.75 mg/ml, and 1× DMEM concentration. Be sure to keep the gel medium on ice during this step.\n\tNote: To make 6 ml of gel medium, mix well 3.5 ml of type 1 collagen gel (3 mg/ml), 1.5 ml of 4× concentrated DMEM, and 1ml of distilled water.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 µl of PBS and remove a sample for cell counting. Count the number of the cells using a hemocytometer with trypan blue stain to check cell viability.\nAdd the gel medium to adjust the volumes to achieve a cell density of 3.0 × 105 cells/well (6.0 × 105 cells/ml) and gently but quickly mix it by pipetting without gelation.\nDispense 0.5 ml of the mixture into each well of a 24-well non-treated plate quickly and carefully to make neat cylindrical form. Be careful not to allow any air bubbles to contaminate the gels (Figure 1A).\n\tNote: The gel medium containing the cells is viscous and can easily gel and form crescent shape in the well.\nIncubate the plate for 15 min in a cell incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity to gel completely.",
    "Detach gels from the plate without breaking by moving a sterilized spatula in a manner to draw a circumference in one direction. Using a spatula, gently transfer the gels to 60 mm tissue culture dishes containing 5 ml of DMEM/1% FBS with or without TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) and TNF-α (10 ng/ml).\nGently shake the dishes to ensure gels are floating on the medium. Incubate in a cell incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\n5. Measurement of Gel Size\nMeasure the collagen gel size after 0, 24, 48, and 72 hr using an image analysis system.\n\t\nTurn on the gel documentation system (Figure 2A), and put dishes into the light shielding cabinet. Then take off the lid of dishes in the cabinet.\nOpen the related gel analyzing software. Click the \"image acquisition button\" in the menu-bar to show the image of the gels in the cabinet. Then, click \"acquire\" in the menu bar to take pictures of the gels (Figure 2B).\nClick the \"detection button\" in the menu bar (Figure 2C) and adjust the measurement region (yellow circle in Figure 2C) by dragging the mouse. Then, click the \"auto-detect button\" in the menu bar (see button in Figure 2D). The software automatically detects the gels showing a heatmap (Figure 2D).\nClick \"OK\" to extract the outline of the gels by image processing and to calculate areas surrounded by the outline (Figure 2E). After the area is calculated, the calculated area is displayed in separate pop-up window.\n\t\tNote: If the gels overlap each other during imaging, move gels gently using a sterile pipette tip.\nSubscription Required.
