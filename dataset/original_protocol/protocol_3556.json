    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection of peripheral blood samples\nTiming: approximately 10 min\nCollect 8 mL peripheral blood from each donor into sodium heparin blood collection tubes by venipuncture. Keep the blood samples at 25°C before use.\nNote: The peripheral blood does not need to be mobilized. The expandable MNCs can be isolated from peripheral blood up to 24 h after collection.\nCritical: The collection of human peripheral blood and subsequent use of PB MNCs must be approved by ethics committee and the donors must be informed and sign the consent forms.\nIsolation of MNCs from peripheral blood\nTiming: approximately 3 h\nThis step describes how to isolate MNCs from fresh peripheral blood samples.\nTransfer the peripheral blood from each donor into a 15 mL sterile conical tube, add equal volume of DPBS and dilute the peripheral blood gently.\nAdd 4 mL Ficoll-Paque Premium in a 15 mL sterile conical tube, carefully load half volume of the diluted blood samples onto the top of Ficoll layer by using a 10 mL pipette. Repeat this step, transfer the other half of the diluted blood samples into another 15 mL sterile conical tube.\nCritical: Set the power of the electric pipettor to a low pressure, tilt the tube at a 45° angle, and slowly layer the diluted blood so that the blood stays on top of Ficoll-Paque.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 400 × g for 30 min at 25°C in a swinging bucket rotor.\nNote: Each tube contains four layers after the centrifugation, the yellow plasma layer on the top, then the white MNC layer, the Ficoll layer, and red cell layer in the bottom.",
    "Remove the upper plasma layer by aspiration, leaving a small volume of plasma (< 1 mL) on top of the opaque interface containing the MNC layer. Carefully collect the MNCs with a 1 mL tip and transfer the MNCs from two 15 mL tubes into a 50 mL conical tube. Do not stir the Ficoll layer as it will interfere with the centrifugation step.\nAdd DPBS to a final volume of 50 mL and centrifuge at 450 × g for 15 min at 25°C. At this step and all the subsequent steps, set the centrifuge brake to “on.”\nCarefully discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets with 5 mL red cell lysis buffer. Let the cells incubate at 25°C for 10 min to remove the mixed red cells.\nAdd DPBS to a final volume of 50 mL and centrifuge at 450 × g for 10 min at 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets with 30 mL DPBS. Centrifuge at 450 × g for 10 min at 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 5 mL DPBS. Aliquot 10 μL of cell suspension, mix with 10 μL of 0.4% trypan blue solution and count the viable cells using a hemocytometer. Centrifuge the rest cell suspension at 450 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellets with appropriate volume of MNC medium to a density of ~3 × 106 cells/mL for the following expansion of MNCs.",
    "Pause Point: Alternatively, MNCs can be frozen at this step. After centrifugation at step 9, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in freezing medium (10% DMSO in MNC medium) to a concentration of >5 × 106 cell/mL/vial, and freeze the cells in a controlled-rate freezing container. Cells can be stored in liquid nitrogen for a prolonged time.\nExpansion of PB MNCs\nTiming: 8–10 days\nThis step describes how to expand MNCs, which is a modified version of a published protocol (Dowey et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The culture conditions used in this protocol selectively enrich the erythroblasts among collected MNCs rather than the lymphocytes which may contain V(D)J DNA rearrangements (Chou et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nSeed the MNCs at a density of 106 cells/cm2 in an appropriate tissue culture plate. Culture the cells in the cell culture incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2 days.\nCollect the cells and transfer into a 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: The cells are cultured in suspension, but some may loosely attach to the bottom of the tissue culture plates due to the gravity. Gently pipette the cells for several times to make cells float before collecting.\nCentrifuge the cells at 220 × g for 5 min at 25°C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in 1 mL MNC medium.\nCount the viable cell number using a hemocytometer and seed the cells back to the tissue culture plate at a density of approximately 106 cells/cm2. Culture the cells in fresh MNC medium in the cell culture incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2 days.",
    "Repeat steps 13 and 14 every 2 days until the cell number significantly increases twice in succession (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). After expansion, the cell bodies of MNCs become much larger than those of MNCs simply isolated (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The expanded MNCs are ready for the subsequent nucleofection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/478-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Typical changes in cell number and morphology during PB MNC expansion\n(A) The cells are ready for reprogramming when the cell number significantly increases twice in succession.\n(B) Cell body becomes larger during PB MNC expansion. Left, 2 days of culture; right, 8 days of culture. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nReprogramming PB MNCs into human iNPCs\nTiming: 3 weeks\nThis step describes the process of generating human iNPCs from expanded PB MNCs, which is schematically summarized in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/478-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of iNPC generation from PB MNCs\n(A) Timeline for the conversion of PB MNCs into iNPCs.\n(B) Representative images showing cell morphology changes during the process. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nOn Day 0, perform the nucleofection of PB MNCs as follows:\nTurn on Lonza 4D-Nucleofector System and select program “EO-100.” Bring the Nucleofector solution and Supplement in P3 primary cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit to 25°C.\nAliquot 2 × 106 cultured PB MNCs to a sterile 15 mL conical tube, add DPBS to a final volume of 5 mL, and centrifuge the cells at 220 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nAdd 82 μL Nucleofector Solution and 18 μL Supplement into a 0.6 mL microcentrifuge tube, mix thoroughly and keep at 25°C.\nAdd 4 μg EV SFFV-OS, 4 μg EV SFFV-MK and 2 μg EV SFFV-BCL-XL into another 0.6 mL tube, mix thoroughly.\nRemove the supernatant completely, and gently resuspend the MNC pellets in 100 μL transfection solution prepared in c.",
    "Mix the cell suspension with the plasmid DNA prepared in d, and immediately transfer it to a sterile cuvette provided with the kit. Place the cuvette with closed lid into the retainer of the 4D-Nucleofector X Unit and run the program.\nOnce nucleofection has been done, remove the cuvette, add 500 μL pre-warmed MNC medium, and incubate in a cell culture incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 10 min.\nCarefully aspirate the sample from the cuvette using a plastic pipette supplied with the kit, transfer, and seed the cells into one well of a 12-well-plate with 1.5 mL pre-warmed MNC medium in it. Culture in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2 days.\nCritical: Avoid repeated aspiration of nucleofected cells to protect them from mechanical damage.\nOptional: Lonza Nucleofector 2b device can also be used for MNC electroporation. Use the Amaxa Human CD34 cell Nucleofector kit and the cuvette provided with the kit. Select “T-016” program for electroporation.\nOn Day 2, transfer the recovered cells to a 15 mL sterile conical tube and centrifuge them at 220 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL MEF medium, aliquot 10 μL cell suspension with 10 μL trypan blue, and count the viable cells using a hemocytometer. The cell viability varies greatly among different MNC samples but is routinely higher than 30%.\nPlate the cells onto irradiated MEFs in Matrigel-coated 12-well-plate at a density of 2×105/well in MEF medium, and culture in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 days.",
    "On Day 3, collect the cells by aspiration and transfer to a sterile 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the tube at 220 × g for 5 min and resuspend the pellet with 3 mL KSR medium. Seed the cells back to the wells and culture in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 5 days. Half-refresh the KSR medium every other day.\nOn Day 8, change the KSR medium to reprogramming medium. Refresh the medium every 2 days.\nCheck the morphological changes of the cells under an inverted microscope daily. The small cell clusters or colonies that might be reprogrammed iNPCs can be observed as early as Day 11 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nOn days 16–20, typical neural rosettes can be observed in the NPC-like colonies, which are big enough for picking. Circle the location of NPC-like colonies with a marker pen on the bottom of the plate. Under an inverted microscope, dislodge an NPC-like colony and mechanically break it into small clusters using a 200 μL sterile pipette. Plate the cells on a Matrigel-coated well in a 24-well-plate and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for further expansion. For each iNPCs, pick up at least 6 colonies and culture for the subsequent establishment of iNPC lines.\nGeneration of human iNPC lines\nTiming: 2 weeks\nCulture and expand the human iNPCs in NPC medium#1 for the first two passages.\nTo passage the iNPCs, discard the medium and add Accutase to culture plate at 1 mL/10 cm2 surface area to detach the cells.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 4 min. Dilute the Accutase in N2B27 medium at a ratio of 1:5 and pipette the cells several times to obtain single cell suspension.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL sterile conical tube, and centrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in 1 mL of NPC medium#1. Split the cells at a ratio of 1:3 and seed them onto Matrigel-coated dishes or plates. Passage the iNPCs every 3 days.\nAt passage 3, change the medium to NPC medium#2 to acquire a homogeneous morphology. Follow the passaging protocol as described in step 24, except that the culture medium is changed to NPC medium#2.\nIn case that the cells fail to show homogeneous morphology, purify the iNPCs at passage 4 by formation of neurosphere since this assay is a robust way to identify and purify the NPCs (Ahmed, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nDiscard the medium, add Accutase at 1 mL per 10 cm2 surface area and incubate at 37°C for 4 min to detach the cells.\nDilute the Accutase in N2B27 medium at a ratio of 1:5 and pipette the cells several times into single cell suspension.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL sterile conical tube, and centrifuge the cells at 200 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in 1 mL of NPC medium#2. Seed all the cells onto an equal-sized petri-dish and culture in 2 mL NPC medium#2 per 10 cm2 surface area in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3 days to form neurospheres (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCollect the neurospheres and seed them directly onto Matrigel-coated tissue culture dishes at a ratio of 1:3. Incubate the cells in NPC medium#2 in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nMaintenance of human iNPCs\nTiming: 30 min for each passage",
    "After purification, maintain the established human iNPCs continuously in NPC medium#2. Passage the cells when they are 90% confluent following the standard passaging protocol as described in step 24 except that the culture medium is NPC medium#2. The human iNPC lines can be stably maintained for more than 20 passages.\nPause Point: The iNPCs can be expanded and cryopreserved from passage 5 to 15. After dissociation of cells with Accutase, dilute Accutase with N2B27 medium at a ratio of 1:5 and centrifuge at 200 × g for 2 min. Resuspend the cells with 10% DMSO-NPC medium#2 to a final concentration of 106 cells/mL and aliquot 1 mL to each cryovial. Freeze the iNPCs in a controlled-rate freezing container. Cells can be stored in liquid nitrogen for a prolonged time.\nDifferentiation of human iNPCs into neurons in vitro\nTiming: 4–5 weeks\nDissociate the iNPCs with Accutase at 1 mL per 10 cm2 surface area as described in step 24a-c. After the centrifugation, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in 1 mL of ND medium.\nSeed 2×105 cells on a PDL-Laminin coated 35 mm dish and culture in ND medium for neural differentiation.\nOn differentiation day 7, dissociate the cells using Accutase as described in step 28, and reseed 2×105 cells on a PDL-Laminin coated 35 mm dish and culture in ND medium supplemented with 0.2 μM Compound E up to differentiation day 19.\nNote: Compound E is a Notch inhibitor and inhibition of Notch signaling can accelerate the neuronal differentiation of human NPCs (Borghese et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Ogura et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nReplace 80% of the old medium with fresh medium every 2 days during the process of neural differentiation. At differentiation days 28–35, cells can be fixed for immunofluorescence staining."
