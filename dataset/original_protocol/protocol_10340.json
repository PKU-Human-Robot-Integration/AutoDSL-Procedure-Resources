    "Experiments with blood samples were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines. The samples were the residual blood samples that had been acquired and processed in clinical tests at the institution.\n1. PT-AS Optical Setup\nNOTE: One may use an empty micro-capillary tube for an initial PT-AS setup.\nMount an empty micro-capillary tube with inner and outer diameters of 200 and 330 μm, respectively, and a length of greater than ~5 cm on a capillary tube fixture. Commercially-available fiber fixtures can be used as the tube fixture.\nSecurely anchor a 650 nm laser pointer, i.e., probe light source, to illuminate the capillary tube. The probe beam should be larger than the capillary tube. Place a screen (e.g., white paper) behind the capillary tube to observe an angular periodic pattern.\nFor the detection part, remove any lenses in a webcam to directly capture the scattering pattern. Position the webcam behind the capillary tube at an angle of 25-35° relative to the probe beam direction. Ensure that the angular periodic pattern produced by the capillary tube can be measured with the detector (Figure 1). Observe the angular periodic pattern in the middle of the image sensor when the image sensor is properly positioned.\nPosition a 532-nm PT excitation light source to illuminate the capillary tube. Position the PT light source at any angle, as long as the PT excitation light overlaps with probe beam on the capillary tube and does not reach the detector directly. PT excitation of blood samples using high optical power typically improves the PT-AS sensitivity, as it leads to a larger change in the RI.",
    "Use the highest optical power of the employed PT excitation light source. In addition, ensure that the PT excitation light overlaps the probe light on the capillary tube. Use a beam size of the PT excitation light at least twice that of the probe light to heat the entire probe volume.\nPlace a long-pass filter in front of the detector to block the 532-nm light and measure only the 650-nm probe light.\nInstall an optical chopper in the path of the PT excitation light before illuminating the capillary tube. The optical chopper is employed to modulate the PT excitation light intensity.\n2. Blood Sample Preparation\nDraw 6 ml of fresh whole blood in anemic condition into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood sampling tubes, and mix the samples well. No other processing is required.\nMeasure the blood samples using the PT-AS sensor within 24 hr of extraction to prevent coagulation.\n3. PT-AS Measurement Protocols\nLoad a micro-capillary tube with a blood sample to measure. Fill the capillary tube with the blood through capillary action by placing the tube into the blood sample. The minimum sample volume required for measurement is determined by the inner diameter of the capillary tube and the probe beam size.\n\t\nEmploy a tube with an inner diameter of 200 μm. The probe beam size was 2 mm in the representative results, suggesting that the measurement can be performed with a sample volume of >63 nl.\nMount the capillary tube at the designated position in the fixture.\nTurn on the 650 nm probe laser to illuminate the blood-loaded micro-capillary tube. The angular periodic pattern should be observed with the webcam.\nTurn on the 532-nm PT excitation laser to illuminate the tube.\nRun the optical chopper to modulate the intensity of the PT excitation light at 2 Hz.",
    "​NOTE: The rationale for the selection of this operating condition is described in Discussion and Kim et al.12.\n\t\nMount a chopper wheel in the motor head assembly of the optical chopper system.\nTurn on the chopper control box, and use the control knob in the console to set the modulation frequency.\nRun the chopper using the control knob.\nRecord the fluctuating scattering pattern via the webcam for 5 sec in MPEG-4 (mp4) format.\n4. Signal Processing\nNOTE: PT-AS signal processing was performed using a lab-developed MATLAB code.\nLoad the video file to extract the images. For each image [see Figure 2(a) for a representative image], obtain the averaged scattering pattern by computing the mean of the pixel values along the vertical direction [Figure 2(b, c)].\nEvaluate the Fourier transform of the averaged scattering pattern, and compute the phase at the peak spatial frequency. Perform these operations for all the frames of all the recorded images.\nUsing the phase values obtained from all the images, plot the temporal phase fluctuation [Figure 2(d)]. Note that the phase fluctuates at the PT modulation frequency. Take the Fourier transform of the phase fluctuation in the time domain, and obtain the magnitude at the modulation frequency. This signal is referred to as the PT-AS signal [Figure 2(e)].\nMeasure the [Hb] of a blood sample by converting its PT-AS signal into the corresponding [Hb] using the calibration curve that is obtained in Protocol 5.\n5. PT-AS Calibration\nPrepare blood samples, having [Hb] values that are uniformly distributed in the detection range of the PT-AS sensor (e.g., 0 - 18 g/dl).\nBefore calibration, quantify the [Hb] values of the samples using a reference hematology analyzer. Measure the PT-AS signals of the samples.",
    "Derive a calibration curve relating [Hb] to the PT-AS signal by performing a linear least squares fit, [Hb] = A[PT-AS Signal] + B, of the experimental results. For the operating conditions specified in Table 1, the relationship between [Hb] and the PT-AS signal was found to be [Hb] = 5.13 [PT-AS signal] - 0.09. Use MATLAB code to perform the linear fit.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
