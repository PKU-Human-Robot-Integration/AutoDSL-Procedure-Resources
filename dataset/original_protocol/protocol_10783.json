    "This protocol has been previously approved and follows the guidelines of the Cleveland Clinic’s human research ethics committee.\n1. Hardware and Software of the NMI\nEstablish each individual participant’s NMI control and feedback so that when they attempt to perform a movement, they see and feel a virtual prosthesis complete that movement.\n\t\nGenerate a hand kinesthetic percept through the participant’s NMI and capture the kinematics of the perceived motion by having the participant demonstrate what they feel using their intact hand.\n\t\tNOTE: Techniques to characterize kinesthetic percept kinematics have been illustrated in other works8 and may be achieved using a data glove or an optical motion capture system.\nUse a virtual hand/prosthetic simulation to reproduce the kinematics of the movement percept.\nSet up hardware to capture the intentional hand movement control signals from the participant’s NMI.\nMap this control signal to the activity of the virtual prosthesis.\nCreate a master control program that coordinates the acquisition of the NMI control signal, the movement of the virtual prosthesis, and the generation of kinesthetic NMI feedback in real-time.\n2. Experimental Setup\nSeat the participant and position a monitor horizontally (i.e., on its back, facing upward) on a table in front of them.\nDisplay the virtual prosthesis on the monitor and adjust its size and location so that it is positioned congruently with the location of their missing limb.\nRender objects (e.g., floating balls) in the virtual environment to serve as stop points for the close and open positions of the hand (endpoints of movement).\nConfigure the master control program so that when the virtual digits make contact with the virtual stop points, an auditory tone is played after an adjustable time delay (300, 500, 700, or 1,000 ms).\n3. Experimental Conditions",
    "Build an input file for the master control program that specifies the settings for each trial, including the auditory tone delay, whether the NMI feedback is turned on/off, the speed and direction of the virtual hand movement, and the delay between the command and the virtual hand movement.\n\t\nCreate two control conditions, a baseline and a passive condition.\n\t\t\nFor the baseline condition, configure the kinematics and control of the virtual hand to match the NMI kinesthetic percept.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The baseline condition represents the ideal congruency of motor intent, movement kinematics, and kinesthetic feedback.\nProgram the passive condition to perform a virtual hand movement when triggered by the investigator (removing the control from the user) while still providing the participant with the NMI kinesthetic percept.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The passive condition captures the theoretical worst-case agency conditions (i.e., movement in the absence of control [without intent], similar to one’s body being passively moved).\nProgram additional conditions designed to parse out the contributions to agency of motor intent, kinesthetic sensation, and temporal mismatch with the displayed kinematics of the virtual prosthesis. Consider using the following five conditions.\n\t\t\nOpposite movement: the NMI kinesthetic feedback indicates that the hand closes while the hand visualization opens.\nToo fast: the hand visualization closes faster than indicated by the NMI kinesthetic feedback.\nToo slow: the hand visualization closes slower than indicated by the NMI kinesthetic feedback.\nOnset delay: the hand visualization closes 1 s later than indicated by the NMI kinesthetic feedback.\nNo feedback: the hand visualization closes without any NMI kinesthetic feedback.\n4. Performance of the Experiment\nInstruct participants to drive the hand from the open to the closed position without stopping and to report their estimation of the time delay from when the virtual digits contacted the virtual stop points to when they heard the auditory tone.",
    "NOTE: Participants may use any representation of time between 0 and 1 s that makes the most sense to them (e.g., milliseconds, fractions of seconds, a 0 - 10 scale).\nInitiate each trial by pressing a start button on the master control program, which moves the virtual hand to the start position, signaling the beginning of the trial. This cues the participant to drive the virtual hand to the virtual stop points, which causes an auditory tone to play after a randomized delay (300, 500, or 700 ms).\n\t\nRecord the participant’s verbally reported estimation of the time delay interval.\nOrganize trials into experimental blocks.\n\t\nBegin with two practice sessions and exclude them from the final analysis.\n\t\t\nIn the first practice session, have the participant drive the hand to the movement endpoint and play the auditory tone 1,000 ms after the virtual digits reach the virtual stop points for 10 trials.\n\t\t\t\nParticipants do not need to report the estimated intervals for this practice session.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: This step is necessary to orient the participants to how long a single second feels.\nIn the second practice session, again, have the participant drive the hand to the movement endpoint. Randomize the auditory tones so that the 300, 500, and 700 ms delay intervals are presented at least 5x each.\n\t\t\t\nAsk participants to report the estimated delay intervals.\nDo not inform the participant of how close their estimates of the delay intervals are to the actual delay during these practice trials or subsequent trials in the experimental block.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: This step is important as participants will likely be inexperienced in making time judgments on a scale of fractions of a second, and the testing procedure may not be intuitive to the unpracticed test participant.",
    "Move to experimental sets of 15 trials for each condition. Present the conditions in a randomized order and administer a questionnaire at the end of each condition.\n\t\t\nInstruct the participants to reflect upon the latest set of trials and complete the eight-statement agency questionnaire (includes four questions to quantify the explicit experience of agency and four control questions [example provided in the Supplementary File])8,26.\n\t\t\t\nRandomize the questionnaire statements to provide at least five unique question orders to be randomly presented to the participants.\nEnd the experimental block with a set of 15 trials for the passive condition and administer a questionnaire after completing these trials.\n\t\tNOTE: Administer the passive trials at the end of each experimental block to avoid interfering with an established sense of agency.\nComplete four experimental blocks with different randomized orders of experimental conditions.\nProvide multiple opportunities over the duration of testing for the participants to take a break. There is no minimum time or time limit for these breaks, but ensure the participant is not physically or mentally fatigued prior to continuing the testing.\nSubscription Required.
