    "Consult all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. Wear gloves to minimize sample contamination by skin-derived SM. The present protocol was applied to HeLa cells grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1,000 U/L penicillin, and 100 mg/L streptomycin.\n1. Preparation of Lipid Samples\nNOTE: It is important that all glassware including test tubes with Teflon-lined screw caps be detergent-free.\nExtraction of total lipid fraction from cell homogenate using the Bligh & Dyer method7\nRemove the culture (or conditioned) media from the 10-cm tissue culture dish and rinse twice with 6 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold PBS into the 10-cm tissue culture dish by P1000 pipette. Harvest the cells with cell scrapers and collect into 2.0-mL siliconized plastic tubes.\nAfter centrifugation (1,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), remove the supernatant by a P1000 pipette.\nAdd 1 mL of methanol. Vortex tubes briefly and sonicate at 200 W for 5 min in a bath-type sonicator.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust the water level in a bath-type sonicator so that the cell pellet is efficiently homogenized.\nTransfer the cell homogenate in methanol by pipette into test tubes (13 mm x 100 mm) with Teflon-lined screw caps.\nAdd 1 mL of methanol, 1 mL of chloroform, 0.8 mL of double distilled water, and 50 µL of 10 µmol/L of internal standard d18:1/(D31)-16:0 SM into each test tube.\nVortex test tubes vigorously for 5 min at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, a single phase (chloroform/methanol/water = 1/2/0.8 (v/v/v)) is formed.\nAdd 1 mL of chloroform and 1.0 mL of double distilled water.\nVortex tubes vigorously at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, the aqueous (upper) phase and organic (lower) phase are separated.",
    "After centrifugation (2,150 × g, 5 min, 25 °C), collect and transfer the lower phase into disposable glass tubes (initial lower phase).\n\t\t​NOTE: Collect the lower phase using a Pasteur pipette and a safety pipette filter. Insert the tip of the pipette into the lower phase, squeeze the small bulb next to the 'E' valve to deliver the upper phase and interfacial fluff inside the tip of the pipette, and then siphon the lower phase into the pipette.\nAdd 2 mL of chloroform into the test tubes, and vortex the tubes vigorously at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature to sufficiently mix with the upper phase and interfacial fluff.\nAfter centrifugation (2,150 × g, 5 min, 25 °C), collect and transfer the modified lower phase into the disposable glass tubes with the initial lower phase as described in step 1.1.10.\nPlace the glass tubes under a nitrogen stream and completely remove the organic solvents in the collected lower phase.\nReconstitute the samples with 500 µL of methanol or ethanol, filtrate with a 0.02-µm filter, and store in glass vials at -20 °C.\nSample preparation for constructing the calibration curve and validating the method\n\t\nAdd 50 µL of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, or 50 µmol/L of standard compound (d18:1/(D9)-18:1 SM) into test tubes with Teflon-lined screw caps.\nAdd cell homogenate into each test tube and add methanol to 1 mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of cell homogenate as a matrix varies according to each experiment. If the SM species in samples derived from cells in a 10-cm culture dish are routinely analyzed, the amount of cell homogenate in each test tube should be close to that of cells in a 10-cm culture dish.\nExtract the total lipid fraction as described in steps 1.1.6-1.1.14.",
