    "1. S. cerevisiae  Cultures and Protein Expression\nNote: Aβ variants exhibit different relative aggregation propensities due to a mutation in a single residue at position 19 (Phe19) of the Aβ42 peptide (Figure 1A). These peptide variants are tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), which acts as an aggregation reporter (Figure 1)29.\nTransform plasmids encoding for 20 Aβ42-GFP variants into yeast cells with a BY4741 parental background (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0)30. Each plasmid encodes for an Aβ42 mutant fused to GFP by a GSSGSSG linker. The plasmids are pESC(-URA) and include the selectable marker URA329.\n\t\nPrepare the synthetic complete medium without uracil (SC-URA) with the following components: 1.9 g/L yeast nitrogen base without uracil, 5 g/L ammonium sulfate, and 900 mL of ddH2O combined with 100 mL of 20% (w/v) glucose.\nPut one colony of the transformed yeast cells into 20 mL of the SC-URA medium containing 2% glucose and grow the cultures overnight at 30 °C under agitation at 210 rpm.\nThe next day, grow new yeast cells cultures by inoculating 100 µL of the overnight culture into 5 mL of fresh SC-URA medium.\nAt an OD590 of 0.5, centrifuge the cultures at 3,000 x g for 4 min, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in the same volume of fresh SC-URA medium containing 2% raffinose.\nIncubate at 30 °C under agitation at 210 rpm for 30 min. Then, centrifuge the cells at 3,000 x g for 4 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in fresh SC-URA medium containing 2% galactose to induce the recombinant protein expression.\nAfter 16 h of inducing protein expression in SC-URA medium containing 2% galactose, harvest 1 mL of the induced cells in sterile microcentrifuge tubes by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 4 min.",
    "NOTE: The most relevant differences occur after an induction period of 16 h. Induced yeast cells expressing Aβ42-GFP variants can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy to determine the recombinant protein distribution inside the cells (Figure 2B).\n2. Cell Staining\nNote: Fresh non-induced cells are required as a negative control to establish a fluorescent threshold during an FC analysis.\nTake the 16 h-induced yeast cells and determine their optical density at 590 nm (OD590). Dilute them in a sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to an OD590 of 0.1.\n\t\nPrepare 1x phosphate buffered saline as follows: add 8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44 g of Na2HPO4, and 0.24 g of KH2PO4 to 800 mL of ddH2O. Fill the solution up to 1 L of ddH2O after adjusting the pH to 7.4 with HCl. Filter the buffer through a 0.2 µm filter.\nTransfer the expressing cell suspensions to appropriately labeled tubes (12 × 75 mm round-bottom polystyrene) and protect them from light. Make sure they are ready to be loaded on the flow cytometer for analysis, together with non-induced and non-stained cells.\nAdd the oxidative stress probe (e.g., CellROX Deep Red) to each sample at a final concentration of 5 µM and incubate the cells at 30 °C for 30 min in the dark.\nAfter incubation, wash the cells 3 times with 1x PBS and resuspend them in the same volume of buffer before their analysis by FC.\n3. Flow Cytometry Analysis",
    "Note: Use an FC setup with appropriate lasers and filters to detect GFP and oxidative stress probe fluorescence signal. A flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm blue laser for the detection of GFP and a 635 nm red laser for the detection of oxidative stress probe fluorescence can be used. Acquisition of emission fluorescence of GFP and oxidative stress probe is performed with a 530/30 nm BP filter and a 660/20 BP filter, respectively (Table 1).\nClick on Open New Worksheet Panel and create the following acquisition dot plots.\n\t\nSelect the Scatter Plot Tool from the toolbar and create a plot with the variables Side Scatter-Area (SSC-A) on the y-axis vs. Forward Scatter-Area (FSC-A) in a linear scale on the x-axis.\nClick the Scatter Plot Tool from the toolbar and create a plot with the variables FL1-Area (FITC) on the x-axis vs. FL3-Area (APC) in a logarithmic scale on the y-axis.\nClick the Instruments Settings icon. Click the Compensation tab and set all compensation levels. Click on the Acquisition tab and select a total number of 20,000 events to be recorded.\nClick the Flow Rate icon to switch the flow rate to Low.\nClick the Acquire tab to start running the non-induced, unstained cells and adjust the voltage in the Instrument Settings of the forward and side scatter until the population is distributed in the middle-left quadrant.\n\t\nClick on the Polygon icon to set a region R1 around the cell population excluding cell debris, and use this gated population P1 = R1 for all fluorescent dot plots and histogram representations (Figure 3).\nTo adjust the PMT voltage of the fluorescence signal, run the unstained cells in the FL1-FL3 dot plot, tuning the gain in the Instrument Setting tab, until the cells are distributed in the lower left quadrant.",
    "Change the sample to the induced cells to measure GFP fluorescence. In the Instrument Setting tab, set the gain in the FSC-A vs. FL1 (FITC) when the population is distributed in the lower-right quadrant. Define the positive cell population with a gate (Gate P2).\nChange the sample to the non-induced stained cells to display oxidative stress by the fluorescence on an FSC-A vs. FL3 (APC) dot plot. Tune the gain until the cell population is distributed in the left-upper quadrant. Gate the positive cell population in P3.\nMake two histogram plots with the histogram icon to represent the cell fluorescence. To represent the fluorescence intensity, make sure FL1 (FITC) representing the GFP fluorescence is in the x-axis, and FL3 (APC) representing the fluorescence is in the y-axis, applying P2 and P3 populations on a logarithmic scale, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Histogram overlays are a good way to illustrate differences between the fluorescence profiles of cells expressing different Aβ variants.\n4. Recombinant Protein Immunodetection\nTo determine protein expression levels, harvest the yeast cultures induced for 16 h by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 6 min, and store the cell pellets at -80 °C.\n\t\nResuspend the collected cells expressing recombinant protein for 16 h in PBS. Prepare 200 µL cell suspensions of each Aβ42-GFP mutant to an OD590 of 20.\nFor total protein fraction analysis, harvest 100 µL of each mutant by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 20 min and resuspend the cell pellets in the same volume of yeast lysis buffer Y-PER (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% DMSO, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA containing 10 mg/mL SB3-14 (myristyl sulfobetaine) supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)).\n\t\nIncubate the samples for 20 min at room temperature under mild agitation.",
    "Determine the protein extract concentration by using the Bradford assay. Load up to 5 µg of protein extract of each sample on a 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE electrophoresis gel and blot onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 100 V for 60 min.\n\t\nPrepare a Bradford reagent with 100 mg of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dissolved in 50 mL of 95% ethanol and add 100 mL of 85% (w/v) phosphoric acid. Then, when the dye is completely dissolved, dilute the mixture with ddH2O to 1 L and filter it through cellulose filter paper just before use.\n\t\tNOTE: The Bradford reagent should be light brown.\nPrepare a standard of bovine serum albumin (BSA) ranging from 5 - 100 µg of protein in 1,000 µL of the Bradford reagent.\nAdd 1 - 10 µL of protein extract to 1 mL of the Bradford reagent and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 5 min.\nMeasure the absorbance of the standards and the protein extract samples at OD595.\nFor the analysis, make a plot with the absorbance values obtained for the standards vs. µg of protein. Based on the standard curve, determine the concentrations of the original samples from the amount of protein, considering the volume and dilution, if any.\nRinse the membrane with 1x Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS), and block it using 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 1x TTBS.\n\t\nTo prepare 1 L of 10x TBS, dissolve 24 g of Tris base and 88 g of NaCl in 900 mL of H2Odd and adjust the pH to 7.6. Add ddH2O to a final volume of 1 L. For a 1x solution, mix 1 part of 10x stock with 9 parts of ddH2O.",
    "Incubate the membrane for 1 h with a primary β-amyloid antibody 6E10 diluted 1:1,000 and for 1 h at room temperature with a secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate diluted 1:10,000.\nDevelop membranes using 1 mL of Luminata fluorescent reagent and quantify bands by densitometric analysis as described in step 5.2.\n5. Data Analysis\nTo analyze the data obtained by FC, create a table displaying the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) and median fluorescence with its corresponding standard error and/or the coefficient of variance (CV) for GFP fluorescence and oxidative stress levels.\n\t\nClick the Inspector tab and the Statistics icon to customize the statistical data that are required for each channel.\n\t\tNOTE: When comparing protein variants, convert fluorescence values data to a fold-over background or resolution metric (RD):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57470/57470eq1.jpg\n\t\tIn this metric, the mean sample is the mean fluorescence of problem samples, the mean control is the mean fluorescence of cells used as a control, and the SD is the standard deviation of the mean fluorescence. RD factor is a more accurate index than MFI value as it not only calculates the difference between samples but also accounts for the spreading of the data. This calculation is specifically relevant when comparing data coming from different experiments carried out over time. Once the RDs have been calculated, the use of a statistical test is advisable to confirm the significance of the observed differences between protein variants.\nFor protein immunodetection, quantify the recombinant protein levels by Western blot using ImageJ software.\n\t\nBefore the densitometry analysis, convert the original raw images of the developed membrane into JPEG file format and greyscale mode.\nAdjust the Set Measurements section of the Analyze menu to Mean Grey Value.",
    "Click on the Rectangle tool from ImageJ and define a region of interest (ROI) with a consistent size for the band densitometry analysis. Center each band on the membrane image inside the created rectangular frame and record the measurement one by one using Ctrl+M (the measurement command).\nMeasure the local background adjacent to each band, applying the same ROI area. After measurement, subtract the corresponding local background from each individual band.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
