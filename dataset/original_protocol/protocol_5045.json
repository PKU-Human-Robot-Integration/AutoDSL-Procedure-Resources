    "Infection model (direct instillation of bacteria into the bladder)The infection protocol of mice was originally described by Hagberg et al. (1983) and was further modified by Cirl et al. (2008), Yadav et al. (2010) and Waldhuber et al. (2016).To sample the urine the mouse will be placed to sit normally on the metal mesh of the cage. Upon lifting up the tale and hind legs, the mouse will hold on to the cage firmly with the front legs thus stretching the belly and exposing the underside. Mouse bladder is now emptied by gentle manual compression with index finger in the abdominal region (Figure 1) and urine is collected in sterile microcentrifuge tubes (kept on ice). Collected urine can be used to quantify colony-forming units (CFU) on TSA plates, for examination of inflammatory cells (e.g., neutrophils) or for cytokine analysis by ELISA. Alternatively, urine can be collected after anesthesia.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170203/20170203212644_9105.jpgFigure 1. Urine collection in mice. Place the mouse on a cage metal mesh and hold tail to lift hind legs. Most mice will urinate naturally and urine can be collected in a sterile microcentrifuge tube. Sometimes, using index finger, gentle pressure on abdominal area can be applied to encourage mice to urinate.The animals are anesthetized using either isoflurane in a drop glass jar or by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine cocktail (Xylazin: 6-8 mg/kg body weight, Ketamin: 90-120 mg/kg body weight (normal body weight of 8-16 week old mice: 19-23 g) in 0.9% NaCl; diluted to a final volume of 100-200 µl/mouse for i.p. administration)If not done before anesthesia the bladder is now emptied by gentle compression of the abdomen.",
    "A drop of urine is caught directly at the urethral orifice with a calibrated loop (taking up 10 µl of fluid) and spread on blood agar plate to ensure that the mice are uninfected.Immediately thereafter, a soft polyethylene catheter (0.61 mm outer diameter; Clay Adams) adapted to a 0.4 by 20-mm gauge needle on a 1 ml tuberculin syringe (supplier BD) is transurethrally inserted into the bladder.Note: By gently grabbing and pulling out the clitoral fold of the mouse, the urethra is straightened out and allows for fast and atraumatic catheterization. We use a forceps to pull the tissue prior to inserting the catheter with the mouse on the back (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170203/20170203212734_5498.jpgFigure 2. Murine urinary tract infection model. Image showing the position of the mouse during transurethral catheter insertion. We used the high dose model in most experiments and instilled 0.1 ml of the bacterial suspension containing 2 x 108 or 1 x 109 CFU/ml. In a few experiments we lowered the bacterial amount to 2 x 105/mouse (low dose model) to study the effects of IL-1β deficiency on bacterial burden.After injection, the catheter is immediately withdrawn and no further manipulations are performed. Control mice were injected with sterile PBS.The model can then be used to study bladder and/or kidney infections (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170203/20170203212947_1812.jpgFigure 3. Ascending urinary tract infection in mice. Mice were infected with E. coli CFT073 by intravesical inoculation and sacrificed after 7 days. A. Uninfected control mice show healthy kidney with smooth and round contours, whereas kidney from infected mice displays severe abscess (arrows) formation (B).Monitoring infectionThe establishment and persistence of bacteria in the mouse urinary tracts is monitored by sequential urine cultures until sacrifice.",
    "Urine is collected into sterile tubes through gentle pressure on the mouse’s abdomen (5 h, 24 h and up to 7 days) and neutrophils are quantified by light microscopy using a Burker chamber.The urine samples and serial dilutions (starting dilution 1:100, then 1:1,000, 1:10,000 in PBS) are quantitatively cultured (100 μl) on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates. LB or Columbia 5% blood agar plates are good alternatives. TSA plates do not contain antibiotics, since there is no antibiotic which would select between the experimental strain and any possible contamination. The experimental strain and possibly contaminating bacteria are differentiated by colony morphology. In addition, sham infected controls may also reveal possible contaminations, but these occur only rarely.After sacrifice by cervical dislocation, bladders and kidneys are removed under sterile conditions, placed into a plastic bag containing 5 ml PBS (pH 7.2) and homogenized in a Stomacher 80 homogenizer (100 rotations/min, 5 min; the instrument was cleaned with 70% alcohol between samples). Samples are placed on ice and analyzed in serial dilutions plated on TSA plates. The number of bacteria is expressed as the number of CFU per entire tissue.The number of intracellular bacteria is determined by killing extracellular bacteria with gentamicin (200 μg/ml) and subsequent washing and homogenization of the remaining organ (more information in Notes).Subsequently, blood agar and TSA plates are incubated at 37 °C overnight and visually scored for bacterial colonies.Post infection analysisHistologyKidneys and bladders are fixed in 1 ml of freshly prepared 4% PFA immediately after sacrifice and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the fixed tissues are incubated in 15% sucrose (4 °C/24 h) and washed in 25% ice-cold sucrose (4 °C/24 h). Tissues are then embedded in O.C.T. compound and frozen in isopentane at -40 °C and stored at -80 °C for further use.",
    "Cryostat sections (thickness 5 μm) are made with Microtome blade C-35, and mounted onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides and stained.The kidney sections from different groups of mice are double-stained for analysis by immunohistochemistry.ImmunohistochemistryBriefly, tissue sections are dried at 37 °C for 15 min, washed in PBS-0.2% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2) (2 x,10 min/RT) and incubated (30 min/RT) with PBS-0.2% Triton X-100 plus 5% goat normal decomplemented serum.Sections are subsequently incubated with a NIMP-R14 rat mAb (1:200) to detect neutrophils and a rabbit antiserum to the synthetic peptide CRPSAQSLEIKHGDL within the PapG adhesin (1:200) (produced in the lab) to detect UPECs for 2-3 h at RT. Negative controls consisted of only normal goat serum (1:200). Antibodies are diluted in PBS-0.2% Triton X-100 plus 5% goat normal serum.The kidney sections (thickness 5 μm) are washed in PBS (3 x, 5 min) by submersion in a washing chamber and incubated (1 h/RT) with secondary goat anti-rat immunoglobulins (1:200), conjugated with Alexa 488 (A488; 495ext/519em nm), and secondary goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (1:200), conjugated with Alexa 568 (A568; 578ext/603em nm) as fluorochrome.After washing in PBS (2 x, 5 min), specimens are counterstained (3 min/RT) with DAPI (0.05 µM, 1 ml) to stain cell nuclei. Sections are washed again in PBS (10 min) and mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium and kept in the dark (4 °C).Sections are analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss) with an AxioCam ERc 5s camera at 200x magnification. Alternative targets analyzed by immunohistochemistry included: E. coli, NLRP3, IL-1β, and ASC.Cytokine measurementsUrine samples are collected at 0.6 h, 24 h and up to 7 days and stored at -20 °C.MIP-2 in urine is quantified by ELISA using the Mouse MIP-2 quantification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Urine is diluted five-fold in sample buffer.",
