    "All procedures using mice were performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved animal protocol. For the present study, 9-12-week-old FVB/N or MMTV-tva female mice were used. The mice were obtained commercially or self-made (see Table of Materials). The Lenti-EGFP (FUCGW) and RCAS-Erbb2 (Neu) viruses were used. Virus preparation and titer determination were performed following the previously published reports10,12.\n1. Syringe preparation\nCut the 33 G metal hub needles (see Table of Materials) to approximately 1 cm in length. Store the needles and the 50 µL syringe in 70% alcohol after autoclaving.\nTake out syringes and needles from the alcohol. Propel the remaining alcohol out of the syringe and needle. Disassemble the syringe for air drying on an autoclaved absorbent bench pad.\nAssemble the syringe after drying.\n2. Virus preparation\nTake out one or several viral stock tubes as needed from the -80 ˚C freezer and thaw the virus on ice.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the number of cells to be infected, the virus may need to be diluted into intended titers using 1x PBS at this time.\nAdd bromophenol blue by dipping the pipette tip to a depth of 1 cm into the bromophenol blue powder (see Table of Materials). Then, bring the attached trace amount of bromophenol blue into the virus suspension.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, the viral stock is usually 200 µL per tube, so the final dye concentration is approximately 0.2% (0.2 µg/100 µL). Bromophenol blue should be sterilized with microwave radiation for 45 seconds at high power of 1250 W (see Table of Materials). Ensure to carry whole procedure in a sterile environment.\nMix the bromophenol blue with the virus solution by pipetting up and down 10 times.\nPlace the virus on ice and bring the ice bucket to the vivarium.",
    "3. Animal preparation\nAnesthetize a female mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 2 µL/g of anesthetic (37.6 mg/mL ketamine, 1.92 mg/mL xylazine, and 0.38 mg/mL acepromazine, see Table of Materials). Check the depth of anesthesia with a toe pinch. Apply ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: The mouse must be non-responsive to toe pinch under good anesthesia. Isoflurane may also be used to anesthetize the mice.\nPut the mouse in a supine position on a warm pad and attach all four limbs to the bench using adhesive tape.\nIdentify one nipple (or more) to be injected (number 4 is preferred for the present study). Expose it by trimming the surrounding hair using a pair of scissors.\nApply 70% alcohol and iodophor swabs to the nipple area in three rounds to clean and expose the nipple.\n4. Intraductal injection of virus\nNOTE: A magnifying lamp may be used to help visualize the nipple opening.\nTransect the distal tip of a nipple using a pair of sterile microdissection spring scissors, until a small central ductal opening can be seen under a magnifier lamp (see Table of Materials).\nLoad 10 µL of virus/bromophenol blue mixture into the syringe.\n\tNOTE: Lenti-EGFP (FUCGW) and RCAS-Erbb2 (Neu) are used in this demonstration.\nCarefully insert the needle into the nipple opening with the help of the magnifier lamp. The orientation of the needle is adjusted slightly from medial to lateral to align with the main duct.\nInject the entire 10 µL of the virus into the duct tree.\n\tNOTE: The ducts under the skin should turn blue, if the injection is successful. Any resistance or the appearance of a localized color change indicates the failure of the injection.",
    "Put the mouse on a slide warmer set at 45 °C until the mouse fully wakes up(~30-60 min).\n5. Detection of infected cells by a fluorescent stereomicroscope\nThree to five days after injection of the virus carrying GFP or other fluorescent genes, euthanize the mouse by over-dosing it with 4 uL/g of anesthetic (37.6 mg/mL ketamine, 1.92 mg/mL xylazine, and 0.38 mg/mL acepromazine).\nOpen the thoracic cavity. Cut the skin along the ventral middle line and along the upper and lower limbs using a pair of scissors. Lift the skin and expose the mammary glands.\nRemove the injected mammary gland from the skin using a pair of forceps and scissors. Also, remove an un-injected gland as a control.\nPlace the mammary glands on glass slides and spread the glands to their original shape.\nObserve and image the glands under a fluorescent stereomicroscope.\nSubscription Required.
