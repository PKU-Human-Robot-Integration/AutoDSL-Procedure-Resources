    "Procedure is in full compatibility with IACUC protocol number 13302 and has been approved by the division of animal resources.\n1. Instrument Preparation\nAutoclave all non-disposable instruments used prior to the surgical procedure to ensure sterility.\nSterilize instruments used multiple times in a session with a glass bead sterilizer between uses.\n2. Hydrogel Preparation\nThaw and plate stem cells at least 24 hr prior to creation of the hydrogel construct.\nPrepare patches one day prior to the surgical procedure using a stereolithography apparatus (or similar instrument) which has been described in full detail in previous publications8,18.\nTo create the hydrogel, first generate a computer aided design (CAD) model of the desired patch and export the design to stereolithographic format (STL).\nCreate a pre-gel solution by dissolving poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) in sterile 1x PBS to obtain a 20% w/v solution. Concurrently, dissolve the photoinitiator 1-[4-(2-hydroxy- ethoxy)-phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propane-1-one in DMSO. Add the photoinitiator to the PEGDMA solution at a final w/v of 0.5%. Directly before crosslinking, add 100 ml of the desired density of cells. Note: A cell density between 2.0 x 105-2.0 x 106 cells/ml is recommended.\nPipette the pre-gel solution into a dish at the center of the SLA platform and run the SLA software with the previously uploaded STL formatted design.\nRemove the patches from the apparatus and incubate the hydrogels O/N in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin to allow for cells to adjust to the environment within the patch.\n3. Animal Preparation and Oral intubation",
    "Evaluate each mouse prior to the procedure to ensure that the animal is in good health, as determined from their grooming habits and interactions with their cage mates. Note: Female 8-10 week old C57BL/6J mice were used for this procedure, however, any mouse age or type can be used.\nPlace animals into an anesthetic chamber and expose to 5% isofluorane with a 1 L/min O2 support. Monitor the level of anesthesia by toe pinch reflex.\nOnce the animal is properly anesthetized, weigh and place them on the intubation stand.\nDirect a light source towards the animal’s chest cavity and use forceps to retract the laryngeal surface and expose the vocal cords. Carefully guide a 20 G angiocath between the vocal cords, and smoothly insert into the trachea. Detect proper insertion by a mechanical movement of the chest cavity once the catheter is connected to the small animal ventilator.\nAdjust ventilation settings to the weight of the animal based on the manufacturer’s guidelines.\nOnce intubated, place the animal in the supine position on a heating pad to prevent hypothermia. Ensure that the heating pad does not exceed 40 °C. If necessary, place a barrier between the animal and the heating pad to minimize the chance of burns.\nRemove hair from the surgical site through the use of a depilatory cream. Sterilize the site by 3 alternating scrubs of betadine and 75% ethanol to ensure proper sterilization. Place a drape to expose just the surgical site, and place vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness during the procedure.\n4. Surgical Procedure\nThe thoracotomy is performed on the left side of the animal, therefore, make a skin incision approximately 1 cm to the left of the sternum, that runs the length of the sternum.",
    "Use forceps to separate the muscle layer from the underlying ribcage in two steps. Observe a delineating line that represents the pectoralis major muscles of the animal. Lift this muscle slightly, separate it from the underlying external oblique muscle and retract medially. Then, free the external oblique muscle from the underlying ribcage in the same manner, and retract laterally, providing an unobscured view of the second, third, and fourth ribs.\nPerform the thoracotomy between the third and fourth ribs. Gently lift the fourth rib and use a cauterizer to open the chest cavity between the third and fourth ribs. Place retractors to further open the cavity and expose the heart.\nUse forceps to rupture the thin pericardium of the heart.\nLigate the left coronary artery with an 8-0 monofilament nylon suture. Place the suture approximately 4 mm from the apex of the heart, directly below the bottom tip of the left atrium. Determine proper suture placement by a blanching of the ventricular myocardium and an increase in the size of the left atrium after the suture has been tied.\n5. Patch Placement and Glue\nKeep patches at 37 °C and 5% CO2 conditions until use.\nGently lift the patch using a flat ended spatula and gently place it on the surface of the heart, at the site of infarction.\n\tNote: To prevent slipping off the left ventricle, the patch can be held in place by lightly maintaining contact using either the spatula or the tip of a pair of forceps.\nPrepare the glue by mixing a 4:1 ratio of fibrinogen to thrombin. Mix the solution by repeated pipetting until it begins to thicken, usually within 1 min after the beginning of the preparation.",
    "Once the solution viscosity reaches the desired level, quickly transfer approximately 10 ml to the patch surface. Note: The clotting time of the fibrin glue is rapid, providing a small window of opportunity for efficient transfer of the glue.\n6. Suturing\nPerform all closing sutures using a 6-0 monofilament nylon suture.\nClose the rib layer with three to four individual interrupted sutures.\nBefore full closure of the intercostal layer, insert a PE-10 cannula into the incision to evacuate the chest cavity after closure is complete and reestablish proper intrapleural pressure.\nClose the pectoral muscles with three to four individual interrupted sutures.\nSeal the skin layer with a continuous suture.\nFollowing full closure, attach a 1.0 ml syringe to the end of the cannula and use it to evacuate the chest cavity.\nApply a tissue adhesive to the incision site to reinforce the suture site.\n7. Post-surgical Treatment\nGive mice an injection of buprenorphine (0.05-1.0 mg/kg) and carprofen (2.2 mg/kg) subcutaneously immediately following the coronary ligation and least 20 min prior to revival. Administer both drugs 6-8 hr after surgery, and then give twice daily for up to three days to control pain and distress.\nContinuously monitor the animals until conscious and every hour for the first 4 hr following surgery. Perform a second checkup the night of the surgery (2-4 hr later) to administer a second dose of analgesic.\nMonitor the animals daily after the second day following the procedure, until animals appear stable.\n8. Analysis of Heart Function and Histology\nPerform echocardiographs on the mice 4 weeks following the procedure to determine the extent of damage following the MI.\nAnesthetize mice with 4-5% isoflurane within an anesthesia chamber for induction of inhalation anesthesia, and then 2% isoflurane via face mask for maintenance anesthesia.",
    "Clear the imaging area with a depilatory cream and use a small animal ultrasound to obtain a 2D M-mode echocardiography scan of the beating heart and record the functional parameters associated with it.\nEuthanize the mice in a carbon dioxide chamber, then collect the hearts from the animals and place in a 10% formalin solution for 24 hr. After 24 hr, transfer the hearts to 70% ethanol and keep at 4 °C until tissue processing.\nProcess the hearts and embed them in paraffin blocks.\nCut 5 mm sections through the ventricular region of the heart, starting at the apex and ending at the atrium.\nStain sectioned slices with both Masson’s trichrome and hematoxylin and eosin stain using standard protocols.\nSubscription Required.
