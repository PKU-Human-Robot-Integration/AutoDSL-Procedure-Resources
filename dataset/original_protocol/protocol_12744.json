    "1. System Design and Virus Production\nPlasmid design and construction\nNOTE: The construction of an all-in-one LV-gRNA-dCas9-DNMT3A vector is performed by using a production-and expression-optimized expression cassette published by Ortinski et al.30. The vector cassette carries a repeat of the recognition site of transcription factor Sp1 and a state-of-the-art deletion within the untranslated (U3') region of a 3'-long terminal repeat (LTR) (Figure 2A)30,36. The vector backbone has been found to be effective in delivering and expressing CRISPR/Cas930,35.\n\t\nObtain the deactivate (dead) version of SpCas9 (dCas9) via site-directed mutagenesis (data not shown). Replace the clone harboring D10A and H840A mutations in HNH and RuvC catalytic domains of the enzyme, respectively, with the active Cas9 in pBK30129 by exchanging between AgeI-BamHI fragments (Figure 3).\nDerive the DNMT3A catalytic domain from pdCas9-DNMT3A-eGFP (see Table of Materials) by amplifying the DNMT3A portion BamHI-429/R 5'-GAGCGGATCCCCCTCCCG-3' BamHI-429/L 5'-CTCTCCACTGCCGGATCCGG-3' (Figure 3). To amplify the region containing DNMT3A, use the following conditions: (1) 95 °C for 60 s, (2) 95 °C for 10 s, (3) 60 °C for 20 s, (4) 68 °C for 60 s. Repeat conditions 2 to 4 30x. For the final extension, use 68 °C for 3 min and hold 4 °C.\nClone the DNMT3A fragment, digested by a BamHI restriction enzyme, into the BamHI site of the modified pBK301 vector carrying dCas9. Verify the cloning by direct Sanger sequencing. Note that the resulted plasmid harbors dCas9-DNMT3A-p2a-puromycin transgene. The plasmid expresses gRNA scaffold from human U6 promoter (Figure 3).\nReplace the puromycin reporter gene with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to create dCas9-DNMT3A-p2a-GFP. Digest dCas9-DNMT3A-p2a-Puro plasmid with FseI. Purify the vector fragment using a gel purification method. Prepare the insert by digesting pBK201a (pLenti-GFP) with FseI. Clone the FseI fragment into the vector. The resulted plasmid pBK539 harbors dCas9-DNMT3A-p2a-GFP transgene (Figure 3).",
    "Culturing HEK-293T cells and plating cells for transfection\nNOTE: Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells are cultured in complete high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; 10% bovine calf serum, 1x antibiotic-antimycotic, 1x sodium pyruvate, 1x nonessential amino acid, 2 mM L-glutamine) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For the reproducibility of the protocol, it is recommended to test the calf serum when switching to a different lot/batch. Up to six 15 cm plates are needed for lentiviral production.\n\t\nUse low-passage cells to start a new culture (lower than passage 20). Once the cells reach 90%–95% confluence, aspirate the media and gently wash it with sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) and incubate it at 37 °C for 3–5 min. To inactivate the dissociation reagent, add 8 mL of complete high-glucose DMEM, and pipette 10x–15x with a 10 mL serological pipette to create a single-cell suspension of 4 x 106 cells/mL.\nFor the transfections, coat 15 cm plates with 0.2% gelatin. Add 22.5 mL of high-glucose medium and seed the cells by adding 2.5 mL of cell suspension (total ~1 x 107 cells/plate). Incubate the plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until 70%–80% confluence is reached.\nTransfection of HEK-293T cells \nPrepare 2x BES-buffered solution BBS and 1 M CaCl2, according to Vijayraghavan and Kantor35. Filter the solutions by passing them through a 0.22 µm filter and store them at 4 °C. The transfection mix has to be clear prior to its addition to the cells. If the mix becomes cloudy during incubation, prepare fresh 2x BBS (pH = 6.95).",
    "To prepare the plasmid mix, use the four plasmids as listed (the following mix is sufficient for one 15 cm plate): 37.5 µg of the CRISPR/dCas9-transfer vector (pBK492 [DNMT3A-Puro-NO-gRNA] or pBK539 [DNMT3A-GFP-NO-gRNA]); 25 µg of pBK240 (psPAX2); 12.5 µg of pMD2.G; 6.25 µg of pRSV-rev (Figure 4A). Calculate the volume of the plasmids based on the concentrations and add the required quantities into a 15 mL conical tube. Add 312.5 µL of 1 M CaCl2 and bring the final volume to 1.25 mL, using sterile dd-H2O. Gently add 1.25 mL of 2x BBS solution while vortexing the mix. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. The cells are ready for transfection once they are 70%–80% confluent.\nAspirate the media and replace it with 22.5 mL of freshly prepared high-glucose DMEM without serum. Add 2.5 mL of the transfection mixture dropwise to each 15 cm plate. Swirl the plates and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2–3 h.\nAfter 3 h, add 2.5 mL (10%) of serum per plate and incubate overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nOn day 1 after the transfection, observe the cells to ensure that there is no or minimal cell death and that the cells formed a confluent culture (100%).\n\t\t\nChange the media by adding 25 mL of freshly prepared high-glucose DMEM and 10% serum to each plate.\nIncubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h.\nHarvest of the virus",
    "Collect the supernatant from all the transfected cells and pool them in 50 mL conical tubes. Centrifuge at 400–450 x g for 10 min. Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm vacuum filter unit. After filtration, the supernatant can be kept at 4 °C for short-term storage (up to 4 days). For long-term storage, prepare aliquots and store them at -80 °C.\nNOTE: The nonconcentrated viral preparations are expected to be ~2 x 107 to 3 x 107 vu/mL (refer to section 1.5 for titer determination). It is highly recommended to prepare single-use aliquots, since multiple freeze-thaw cycles will result in a 10%–20% loss in functional titers.\nConcentration of viral particles \nNOTE: For the purification, a two-step double-sucrose method involving a sucrose gradient step and a sucrose cushion step is performed (Figure 4B).\n\t\nTo create a sucrose gradient, prepare the conical ultracentrifugation tubes in the following order: 0.5 mL of 70% sucrose in 1x PBS, 0.5 mL of 60% sucrose in DMEM, 1 mL of 30% sucrose in DMEM, and 2 mL of 20% sucrose in 1x PBS.\nCarefully, add the supernatant, collected according to section 1.4, to the gradient. Since the total volume collected from four 15 cm plates is 100 mL, use six ultracentrifugation tubes to process the viral supernatant.\nEqually distribute the viral supernatant among each ultracentrifugation tube. To avoid tube breakage during centrifugation, fill the ultracentrifugation tubes to at least three-fourth of their total volume capacity. Balance the tubes with 1x PBS. Centrifuge the samples at 70,000 x g for 2 h at 17 °C.",
    "NOTE: To maintain the sucrose layer during the acceleration and deceleration steps, allow the ultracentrifuge to slowly accelerate and decelerate the rotor from 0 to 200 x g and from 200 to 0 x g during the first and last 3 min of the spin, respectively.\nGently collect 30%–60% sucrose fractions into clean tubes (Figure 4B). Add 1x PBS (cold) up to 100 mL of total volume. Mix by pipetting multiple times.\nCarefully, stratify the viral preparation on a sucrose cushion by adding 4 mL of 20% sucrose (in 1x PBS) to the tube. Continue by pipetting ~20–25 mL of the viral solution per each tube. Fill the tubes with 1x PBS if the volume of their contents is less than three-fourth per tube. Carefully balance the tubes. Centrifuge at 70,000 x g for 2 h at 17 °C. Empty the supernatant and invert the tubes on paper towels to allow the remaining liquid to drain.\nRemove all the liquid by cautiously aspirating the remaining liquid. Note that, at this step, pellets containing the virus are barely visible as small translucent spots. Add 70 µL of 1x PBS to the first tube to resuspend the pellet. Thoroughly pipette the suspension and transfer it to the next tube until all pellets are resuspended.\nWash the tubes with an additional 50 µL of 1x PBS and mix as before. Note that, at this step, the volume of the final suspension is ~120 µL and appears slightly milky. To obtain a clear suspension, proceed with a 60 s centrifugation at 10,000 x g. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube, make 5 µL aliquots, and store them at -80 °C.",
    "​NOTE: Lentiviral vector preparations are sensitive to the repeated cycles of freezing and thawing. In addition, it is suggested that the remaining steps are done in tissue culture containment or in designated areas qualified in terms of being at adequate levels of biosafety standards (Figure 4B).\nQuantification of viral titers\nNOTE: The estimation of viral titers is performed using the p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method (p24gag ELISA) and according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Vaccine Program protocol for the HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture Assay with slight modifications.\n\t\nUse 200 µL of 0.05% Tween 20 in cold 1x PBS (PBS-T) to wash the wells of a 96-well plate 3x.\nTo coat the plate, use 100 µL of monoclonal anti-p24 antibody diluted at 1:1,500 in 1x PBS. Incubate the plate overnight at 4 °C.\nPrepare blocking reagent (1% bovine serum albumin [BSA] in 1x PBS) and add 200 µL to each well to avoid nonspecific binding. Use 200 µL of PBS-T to wash the well 3x for at least 1 h at room temperature.\nProceed with the sample preparation. When working with concentrated vector preparations, dilute the vector at 1:100 by using 1 µL of the sample, 89 µL of dd-H20, and 10 µL of Triton X-100 (at a final concentration of 10%). For nonconcentrated preparations, dilute the samples at 1:10.\nObtain HIV-1 standards by using a twofold serial dilution (the starting concentration is 5 ng/mL).\nDilute the concentrated samples (prepared in step 1.6.4) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% BSA to obtain 1:10,000, 1:50,000, and 1:250,000 dilutions. Similarly, dilute the nonconcentrated samples (prepared in step 1.6.4) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% BSA to establish 1:500, 1:2,500, and 1:12,500 dilutions.",
    "Add the samples and standards on the plate in triplicates. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nThe next day, wash the wells 6x.\nAdd 100 µL of polyclonal rabbit anti-p24 antibody, diluted at 1:1,000 in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.25% BSA, and 2% normal mouse serum (NMS), and incubate at 37 °C for 4 h.\nWash the wells 6x. Add goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase IgG diluted at 1:10,000 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% normal goat serum, 2% NMS, 0.25% BSA, and 0.01% Tween 20. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nWash the wells 6x. Add TMB peroxidase substrate and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nTo stop the reaction, add 100 µL of 1 N HCl. In a microplate reader, measure the absorbance at 450 nm.\nMeasurement of fluorescent reporter intensity\nUse the viral suspension to obtain a 10-fold serial dilution (from 10-1 to 10-5) in 1x PBS.\nPlate 5 x 105 HEK-293T cells in each well of a 6-well plate. Apply 10 µL of each viral dilution to the cells and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h.\nProceed to the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis as follows: detach cells by adding 200 µL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min and resuspend them in 2 mL of DMEM medium (with serum). Collect the samples into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 400 x g at 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of cold 1x PBS.\nFix the cells by adding 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Centrifuge at 400 x g at 4 °C and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 1x PBS. Analyze the GFP expression using a FACS instrument, as described in Ortinski et al.30. To determine the virus functional titer, use the following formula.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59241/59241eq1.jpg\n\t\tHere,\n\t\tTg = number of GFP-positive cells;\n\t\tTn = total number of cells;\n\t\tN = total number of transduced cells;\n\t\tV = volume used for transduction (in microliters).\nCounting GFP-positive cells \nNOTE: Determine the multiplicity of infection (MOI) that is employed for transduction. Test a wide range of MOIs (from MOI = 1 to MOI = 10).\n\t\nSeed 3 x 105 to 4 x 105 HEK-293T cells per each well of a 6-well plate.\nWhen the cells reach >80% confluence, transduce them with the vector at the MOI of interest.\nIncubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2, and monitor the GFP signal in the cells for 1–7 days.\nCount the number of GFP-positive cells. Employ a fluorescent microscope (Plan 4x objective, 0.1 N.A., 40x magnification) using a GFP filter (excitation wavelength = 470 nm, emission wavelength = 525 nm). Use untransduced cells to set the control population of GFP-negative cells.\nEmploy the following formula to determine the functional titer of the virus.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59241/59241eq2.jpg\n\t\tHere,\n\t\tN = number of GFP-positive cells;\n\t\tD = dilution factor;\n\t\tM = magnification factor;\n\t\tV = volume of virus used for transduction.\n\t\tNOTE: Calculate the results following this example: for 10 GFP-positive cells (N) counted at a dilution (D) of 10-4 (1:10,000) at 20x magnification (M) in a 10 µL sample (V), the TU per milliliter will be (10 x 104) x (20) x (10) x (100) = 2 x 108 vu/mL.\n2. Differentiation of dopaminergic neural progenitor cells\nCulturing hiPSCs",
    "NOTE: hiPSCs from a patient with the triplication of the SNCA locus, ND34391, were obtained from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) catalog (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nCulture hiPSCs under feeder-independent conditions in feeder-free ESC-iPSC culture medium (see Table of Materials) onto hESC-qualified basic matrix membrane (BMM)-coated plates (see Table of Materials).

Perform a daily medium change and split the cells every 5–7 days.\nDifferentiation into dopaminergic neural progenitor cells\nNOTE: The differentiation of hiPSCs into dopaminergic neural progenitor cells (MD NPCs) is performed using a commercially available neural induction medium protocol per manufacturers’ instructions, with slight modifications31,32 (see Table of Materials). The first day of the differentiation is considered as day 0. High-quality hiPSCs are required for efficient neural differentiation. The induction of MD NPCs is performedusing an embryoid body (EB)-based protocol.\n\t\nPrior to starting the differentiation of hiPSCs, prepare a microwell culture plate (see Table of Materials) according to its manufacturer’s instructions.\nAfter preparing the microwell culture plate, add 1 mL of neural induction medium (NIM; see Table of Materials) supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632.\nSet the plate aside until ready to use.\nWash hiPSCs with DMEM/F12, add 1 mL of cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials), and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "Resuspend single cells in DMEM/F12 and centrifuge them at 300 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in NIM + 10 µM Y-27632 to obtain a final concentration of 3 x 106 cells/mL.\nAdd 1 mL of the single-cell suspension to a single well of the microwell culture plate and centrifuge the plate at 100 x g for 3 min.\nExamine the plate under the microscope to ensure an even distribution of the cells among the microwell, and incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nOn days 1–4, perform a daily partial medium change.\nUsing a 1 mL micropipette, remove 1.5 mL of the medium and discard.

Incubate the EBs at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nOn day 6, prepare 2 mL of NIM + 200 ng/mL SHH (see Table of Materials) and perform a daily medium change.\nOn day 8, examine the percentage of neuronal induction.",
    "Count all attached EBs and, specifically, determine the number of each individual EB that is filled with neural rosettes. Quantify the neural rosette induction using the following formula.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59241/59241eq3.jpg\nNOTE: If the neural induction is <75%, neural rosette selection may be inefficient.\nOn day 12, prepare 250 mL of N2B27 medium with 119 mL of neurobasal medium, 119 mL of DMEM/F12 medium, 2.5 mL of GlutaMAX, 2.5 mL of NEAA, 2.5 mL of N2 supplement, 5 mL of B27 without vitamin A, 250 μL of Gentamicin (50 mg/mL), and 19.66 μL of BSA (7 mg/mL).\nTo prepare 50 mL of complete N2B27 medium, add 3 μM CHIR99021, 2 μM SB431542, 20 ng/mL bFGF, 20 ng/mL EGF, and 200 ng/mL SHH.\nNOTE: It is important to prepare the completed medium right before use.\nAspirate medium from the wells containing the neural rosettes and wash with 1 mL of DMEM/F12.\nAd 1 mL of neural rosette selection reagent (see Table of Materials) and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nRemove the selection reagent and, using a 1 mL pipettor, aim directly at the rosette clusters.\nAdd the suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and repeat steps 2.2.25 and 2.2.26 until the majority of the neural rosette clusters have been collected.\nNOTE: To avoid contamination with nonneuronal cell types, do not overselect.\nCentrifuge the rosette suspension at 350 x g for 5 min.

SHH can be withdrawn from the N2B27 medium at P2.\nPassage the cells once they reach 80%–90% confluence.\nAt this stage, confirm that the cells express Nestin and FoxA2 markers by using immunocytochemistry and qPCR. This protocol leads to the generation of 85% double-positive cells for the Nestin and FoxA2 markers.\nFor passaging cells, repeat steps 2.2.31–2.2.36.\nFreeze the cells, starting from passage P2.
