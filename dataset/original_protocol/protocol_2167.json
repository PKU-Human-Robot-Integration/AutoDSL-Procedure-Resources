    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPerform SELEX (repeat these steps 2–6 times)\nTiming: 1.5 days (×2–6)\nDuring SELEX, a library of random oligonucleotides is mixed with a DNA-binding protein of interest fused with an affinity tag. Protein-DNA complexes are purified and bound sequences are amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This material is re-used for successive cycles of SELEX until most of the library contains high affinity binding sites. For transcription factors, 2–3 cycles are usually sufficient for successful HT-SELEX (Jolma et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). However, we performed up to 6× SELEX cycles to characterize SALL4 ZFC4 which promiscuously binds to multiple AT-rich sequences (Pantier et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nPrepare buffers.\nOn the day of the experiment, prepare a mastermix of “SELEX binding buffer” (SELEX buffer supplemented with 5 μg/mL poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 mM DTT) and “SELEX wash buffer” (SELEX buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM DTT).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_11.csv\nKeep on ice until use.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_12.csv\nKeep on ice until use.\nEquilibrate Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads in SELEX binding buffer.\nTake out the required amount of Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (55 μL × number of samples) and transfer into a in a 1.5 mL tube (e.g., for 6 samples, take out 330 μL of Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin).\nNote: The total amount of resin includes a 10% excess to account for small inaccuracies when pipetting multiple samples.\nNote: If a large volume of Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin is required, split into several 1.5 mL tubes (maximum 500 μL resin/tube) and prepare additional SELEX binding buffer accordingly.\nAdd 1 mL of SELEX binding buffer and resuspend beads thoroughly by inverting the tube multiple times.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 400 × g. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the beads pellet.",
    "Wash beads 2× more times (steps 2b-c).\nResuspend beads in SELEX binding buffer in the initial volume of resin pipetted in step a (e.g., for 6 samples, resuspend in a total volume of 330 μL). Keep on ice until use.\nIncubate DNA-binding proteins with SELEX libraries.\nSet up SELEX reactions in 1.5 mL tubes:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_13.csv\nNote: For the first SELEX cycle, use 1.5 μg of “cycle 0” random library (see generation of cycle 0 libraries). For subsequent cycles, use 200 ng of SELEX library from the previous cycle (e.g., To perform SELEX cycle 2, use library amplified at the end of cycle 1).\nNote: It is important to include a negative control SELEX reaction, without addition of proteins, to control for any sequence bias that could be associated with repeated PCR cycling. It is also advised to perform SELEX with independent libraries, which are used as technical replicates (see generation of cycle 0 libraries).\ne.g., Sample 1: SALL4 ZFC4 + library 1 (replicate 1).   Sample 2: SALL4 ZFC4 + library 2 (replicate 2).   Sample 3: SALL4 ZFC4 + library 3 (replicate 3).   Sample 4: Negative control (no protein) + library 1 (replicate 1).   Sample 5: Negative control (no protein) + library 2 (replicate 2).   Sample 6: Negative control (no protein) + library 3 (replicate 3).\nIncubate on a rotating wheel for 10 min at room temperature.\nPurify protein-DNA complexes.\nTo capture protein-DNA complexes, add 50 μL of equilibrated Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (from step 2) to each SELEX sample.\nIncubate for 20 min on a rotating wheel at room temperature.\nTo remove non-specifically bound DNA-protein complexes, add 1 mL of SELEX wash buffer and resuspend beads thoroughly by inverting the tube multiple times.",
    "Centrifuge for 1 min at 400 × g. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the beads pellet.\nWash beads 4× more times (steps 4c-d).\nResuspend the resin in 100 μL H2O.\nNote: Elution of DNA from the beads is not necessary, as this material can be directly used as a template for PCR amplification of SELEX libraries.\nPause point: The resin (protein-DNA complexes) can be stored at −20°C (long term). This material can be used at a later time for PCR amplification.\nPCR-amplify enriched DNA.\nCritical: The amount of DNA bound to the resin is unknown and usually varies between SELEX samples. Therefore, it is important to empirically determine the optimal number of PCR cycles to amplify each SELEX library (see the following steps).\nFor each SELEX sample, prepare a PCR mastermix (for 4× PCR reactions) in a 1.5 mL tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_14.csv\nNote: It is not recommended to increase the amount of resin (DNA template) in the mix, as an excess can inhibit the PCR reaction.\nDivide mastermix between 4 PCR tubes (50 μL/tube).\nNote: Before transferring the mix to PCR tubes, ensure that beads are homogeneously resuspended by pipetting up and down multiple times.\nRun each of the 4× PCR reactions with a different PCR programme (increasing numbers of PCR cycles):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_15.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_16.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_17.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_18.csv\nTo control the amplification of libraries, run a small amount of PCR reaction (5 μL) on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and stain with a 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide solution (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1750-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. 10% polyacrylamide gel showing the optimization of PCR conditions to amplify enriched DNA from Ni Sepharose beads following a cycle of SELEX",
    "For this sample, we purified the product following to 12× PCR cycles, as it showed a robust amplification of the library (83 bp) without detectable heteroduplexes (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nFor each SELEX sample, select the optimal PCR reaction and discard other tubes (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPurify DNA using the Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit and following manufacturer’s protocol. Elute with 20 μL of EB Buffer (included in the kit, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.5) or H2O.\nNote: A single PCR reaction will yield enough DNA to proceed with the protocol.\nEvaluate DNA concentration and integrity of purified SELEX libraries using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.\nPause point: Store purified SELEX libraries at −20°C (long term).\nUse DNA as an input to repeat an additional cycle of SELEX (N+1).\nCritical: Remember to save an aliquot of purified SELEX library (≈20 ng) for high-throughput sequencing (see generation of HT-SELEX libraries for Illumina sequencing).\nGenerate HT-SELEX libraries for Illumina sequencing\nTiming: 1.5 days\nAfter multiple SELEX cycles, DNA libraries contain a significant proportion of high affinity DNA binding sites for the target protein. This step describes the conversion of SELEX libraries into HT-SELEX libraries containing Illumina adapters and unique barcodes (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). These samples are subsequently pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing to reveal preferred DNA motifs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1750-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Strategy for generating HT-SELEX libraries for high-throughput sequencing\nFollowing PCR, each SELEX library contains Illumina sequencing adapters (P5/P7) and unique barcodes (i7 indexes).\nSelect SELEX samples to submit to high-throughput sequencing.",
    "Note: For most purposes, it is not necessary to sequence libraries for all SELEX cycles. However, it is important to sequence initial random libraries (cycle 0) in order to assess the initial frequency of all DNA motifs. While libraries at the last SELEX cycle will contain the highest proportion of DNA binding motifs, sequencing intermediate SELEX cycles will provide useful information regarding the kinetics of enrichment of preferred DNA motifs.\nCritical: For all selected SELEX cycles, include technical replicates (i.e., different libraries) as well as a negative control (i.e., without addition of DNA-binding proteins). These important controls will allow the measurement of technical bias during the SELEX protocol (e.g., base composition bias of DNA polymerase during PCR amplification).\nHere is an example of SELEX dataset for SALL4 ZFC4 (6× SELEX cycles, 3 replicates):\n  Sample 1: Cycle0 - Initial random SELEX library 1 (replicate 1).\n  Sample 2: Cycle0 - Initial random SELEX library 2 (replicate 2).\n  Sample 3: Cycle0 - Initial random SELEX library 3 (replicate 3).\n  Sample 4: Cycle 1 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 1).\n  Sample 5: Cycle 1 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 2).\n  Sample 6: Cycle 1 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 3).\n  Sample 7: Cycle 1 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 1).\n  Sample 8: Cycle 1 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 2).\n  Sample 9: Cycle 1 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 3).\n  Sample 10: Cycle 3 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 1).\n  Sample 11: Cycle 3 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 2).\n  Sample 12: Cycle 3 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 3).\n  Sample 13: Cycle 3 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 1).\n  Sample 14: Cycle 3 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 2).\n  Sample 15: Cycle 3 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 3).\n  Sample 16: Cycle 6 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 1).",
    "Sample 17: Cycle 6 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 2).\n  Sample 18: Cycle 6 - SALL4 ZFC4 (replicate 3).\n  Sample 19: Cycle 6 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 1).\n  Sample 20: Cycle 6 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 2).\n  Sample 21: Cycle 6 - Negative control (no protein) (replicate 3).\nPCR amplify HT-SELEX libraries.\nCritical: PCR conditions were optimized to amplify HT-SELEX libraries. However, the amount of DNA template and the number of PCR cycles might need to be adjusted in order to avoid the formation of heteroduplexes (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nFor each SELEX sample, set a PCR reaction in a PCR tube using a unique reverse primer (Seqlib RV):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_19.csv\nNote: Each “Seqlib RV” primer contains a distinct barcode which will allow the pooling of multiple samples for high-throughput sequencing (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nRun the following PCR programme:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1750_20.csv\nTo control the amplification of libraries, run a small amount of PCR reaction (5 μL) on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and stain with a 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide solution (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1750-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. 10% polyacrylamide gel showing the generation of 9× HT-SELEX libraries (144 bp) for high-throughput sequencing\nPurify HT-SELEX libraries using the Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit and following manufacturer’s protocol. Elute with 20 μL of EB Buffer (included in the kit, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.5) or H2O.\nNote: For each SELEX sample, a single PCR reaction will yield enough DNA to proceed with high-throughput sequencing.\nNote: Long PCR primers were used to generate HT-SELEX libraries, and these oligonucleotides are not completely eliminated following PCR purification with the Qiagen MinElute column.\nEvaluate DNA concentration and integrity of purified HT-SELEX libraries using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.",
    "Pause point: Store purified HT-SELEX libraries at −20°C (long term). These samples can be pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing at a later time.\nPrepare a sequencing library pool and submit to high-throughput sequencing.\nUse Nanodrop quantification to pool all HT-SELEX libraries in equimolar amounts in a 1.5 mL tube.\nCritical: Make sure that all libraries in the pool contain unique indexes, so that each library can be de-multiplexed following high-throughput sequencing.\nTo ensure complete removal of leftover PCR primers contaminating libraries, perform a clean-up with KAPA Pure beads following manufacturer’s protocol. Use a 3× bead-to-sample ratio (e.g., add 150 μL of beads to 50 μL of HT-SELEX pool) to eliminate oligonucleotides below 100 bp (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1750-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Bioanalyzer profile showing the successful elimination of PCR primers from HT-SELEX library pool following a 3× clean-up with KAPA Pure beads\nPause point: Store purified HT-SELEX library pool at −20°C (long term). This material can be submitted to high-throughput sequencing at a later time.\nPerform a final quality control on the library pool using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit and the 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument (following manufacturer’s protocol) (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nAlternatives: Run the library pool on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and stain with a 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide solution, as previously described.\nSubmit the HT-SELEX library pool to high-throughput sequencing using an Illumina instrument (e.g., Miseq/NextSeq/NovaSeq). Single-end sequencing is sufficient to cover the 20 bp insert containing putative DNA binding motifs (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). A sequencing depth of 10,000–50,000 reads per sample should be sufficient to obtain robust quantification of DNA motifs for HT-SELEX (see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3])."
