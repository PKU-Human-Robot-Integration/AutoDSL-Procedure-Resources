    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCoating wells—Day -1\nTiming: 16–24 h\nWells in a 96-well plate are dual coated with PDL and laminin. PDL is used to promote cell adhesion, while laminin promotes attachment and differentiation of neuronal cells.\nCritical: Perform all steps under sterile conditions in tissue culture hood.\nCritical: To avoid evaporation of medium throughout the experiment, do not use the outermost wells of the plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: For initial differentiation, we recommend plating at least 3 wells per PC12 cell clonal variant to allow for quantification of neurite density during differentiation.\nSterilize wells in a 96-well plate under UV light in tissue culture hood for 30 min, with lid removed from the plate.\nPrepare a 50 μg/mL working PDL solution by diluting PDL stock solution (0.1 mg/mL) in sterile DPBS without calcium or magnesium.\nAdd 50 μL working PDL solution to each well.\nIncubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C in tissue culture hood.\nWash each well 3 times with 100 μL cell culture grade water (sterile water for use in cell culture).\nCritical: Rinse wells thoroughly because excess PDL solution may be toxic to cells.\nRemove last wash and let wells air dry in tissue culture hood for 2 h, with lid removed from the plate.\nPrepare a 20 μg/mL working laminin solution by diluting laminin stock solution (concentration varies) in cell culture grade water.\nAdd 100 μL working laminin solution to each well.\nWrap the plate in parafilm and incubate for 16–24 h at 4°C.\nCritical: Thaw laminin aliquots on ice—laminin will inactivate if thawed at 20°C–25°C. Start thawing about 45 min prior to use. Prepare working laminin solution on ice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nPlating PC12 cells—Day 0\nTiming: 1.5 h\nPC12 cells are plated in a 96-well plate for NGF-induced differentiation.",
    "Critical: Perform all steps under sterile conditions in tissue culture hood.\nNote: Pre-warm all media to 37°C prior to use.\nRemove 96-well plate from 4°C and incubate at 20°C–25°C in tissue culture hood for 1 h. During this 1-h incubation, PC12 cells are prepared for plating (steps 7–17).\nAspirate PC12 cell culture medium from PC12 cells (cultured in a T25 flask) and wash cells in 1 mL DPBS without calcium or magnesium.\nAspirate DPBS and add 1 mL 0.05% Trypsin EDTA.\nIncubate flask in a 37°C cell culture incubator with 5% CO2 for 2 min.\nAdd 1 mL PC12 cell culture medium to inactivate trypsin.\nTriturate cells 5–10 times with a P1000 pipette tip to thoroughly separate cells, while avoiding the formation of bubbles.\nNote: For this protocol, PC12 cells were cultured in a T25 flask prior to plating for differentiation. The above volumes may need to be adjusted if a larger volume flask or different culture vessel is used.\nPass cells through a 40 μm sterile cell strainer into a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge cells for 3 min at 200 × g at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the liquid from the tube, leaving the cell pellet undisturbed.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL PC12 cell culture medium and transfer the PC12 cell suspension to a 1.5 mL sterile microcentrifuge tube.\nPass the PC12 cell suspension through a sterile 26-gauge syringe needle 15 times to create a single cell suspension (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nNote: Work slowly to avoid forming bubbles.\nCount cells on a hemocytometer.\nCreate a 1:10 dilution of PC12 cell suspension by combining 10 μL PC12 cell suspension and 90 μL PC12 cell culture medium, and add 20 μL to the hemocytometer.",
    "Calculate the volume of PC12 cells required per well to achieve a plating density of 1.0 × 104 cells/cm2. Use the following formula, where “x” is the volume of cell suspension per well (mL):\n  x =    (  D e s i r e d  p l a t i n g  d e n s i t y   (  c e l l s / c  m 2   )   )    (  G r o w t h  a r e a  p e r  w e l l   (  c  m 2    )   )     N u m b e r  o f  c e l l s  p e r  m L   (  c e l l s / m L  )     \nFor the 96-well plates used in this protocol, the growth area per well is 0.33 cm2.\nPrepare diluted PC12 cell suspension for plating.\nCalculate the total volume of PC12 cell culture medium needed to plate a final volume of 100 μL per well (+ 3 extra wells) and aliquot into a new sterile tube.\nMultiply the calculated volume of cells per well (step 16) by the total number of wells being plated (+ 3 extra wells) to determine the volume of PC12 cell suspension to add to the aliquoted PC12 cell culture medium.\nFrom the aliquot of PC12 cell culture medium, remove and discard the volume calculated in step 17b and add the calculated volume of PC12 cell suspension to make the diluted PC12 cell suspension for plating.\nPipette up and down a few times to mix.\nNote: Before preparing the diluted PC12 cell suspension, pipette the PC12 cell suspension up and down a few times to mix (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).",
    "Wash each well one at a time by aspirating the laminin and immediately adding 100 μL PC12 cell culture medium.\nNote: Working one well at a time ensures that the wells do not dry out, which is crucial to prevent laminin inactivation and cell detachment during culture.\nNote: If the 1-h 20°C–25°C incubation for the 96-well plate (step 6) is completed prior to completing steps 16 and 17, perform step 18 first.\nKeeping the 96-well plate flat on the tissue culture hood surface, aspirate the medium from the wells one well at a time and add 100 μL diluted PC12 cell suspension to each well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCritical: Do not let wells dry out while plating cells. Aspirate one well at a time and immediately add the diluted PC12 cell suspension.\nNote: Invert the diluted PC12 cell suspension after plating every 3–6 wells to prevent cells from settling to the bottom of the tube.\nNote: Pipette diluted PC12 cell suspension directly in the center of the well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nFill the unused surrounding wells in the 96-well plate with 200 μL DPBS.\nCritical: Do not tilt the cell culture plate while plating cells or adding DPBS to empty wells, as this will cause uneven distribution of cells throughout the well and may lead to cell clumping in one region (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nCarefully transfer the 96-well plate to a 37°C cell culture incubator with 5% CO2, avoiding tilting the plate to prevent uneven distribution of cells.\nInducing neuronal differentiation—Day 0\nTiming: 1 h\nPC12 cells are treated with 50 ng/mL NGF to induce neuronal differentiation.\nCritical: Perform all steps under sterile conditions in tissue culture hood.\nNote: Wait at least 2 h after plating cells before beginning NGF treatment.",
    "Prepare 25 mL stock Opti-MEM-based differentiation medium in a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube according to the recipe provided here (adapted from Hu et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nFilter medium through a 0.2 μm syringe filter into a new 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube.\nPrepare 50 ng/mL working NGF solution in stock differentiation medium.\nCalculate the total volume of stock differentiation medium needed for a final volume of 150 μL per well (+ 3 extra wells). Aliquot and pre-warm to 37°C.\nCalculate the volume of NGF stock (0.1 mg/mL) to add to the aliquoted stock differentiation medium for a final concentration of 50 ng/mL.\nFrom the pre-warmed aliquot of stock differentiation medium, remove and discard the volume calculated in step 23b and add the calculated volume of NGF stock.\nPipette up and down a few times to mix.\nOne well at a time, remove the PC12 cell culture medium gently by pipette and discard, and add 150 μL working NGF solution.\nCritical: Do not let wells dry out while changing media. Change media one well at a time and immediately add working NGF solution.\nNote: Gently tilt the plate and put the pipette tip at the edge of the well to remove media. Do not aspirate media to avoid cell detachment. Slowly dispense media down the wall of the well to add. Do not add media directly into the well to avoid disrupting the cells.\nStore cells in a 37°C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator for the duration of cell culture.\nLive-cell imaging of differentiating PC12 cells—Day 0 and daily until end of experiment\nTiming: 15 min per day\nDifferentiating PC12 cells undergo live-cell imaging daily to quantify neurite density over time.\nNote: The following steps describe live-cell imaging on an EVOS M7000 microscope. Set-up may vary with alternative microscopes.",
    "Note: If PC12 cells are imaged for longer than 20–30-min increments, use an onstage incubator set to 37°C, 5% CO2. If cells are imaged for longer than 1-h increments, also include humidity (80%).\nImmediately after NGF treatment, image a set region of each well to track differentiation in the same fields of view over time. We recommend the following parameters:\nUse a 20×, short working distance objective.\nUse a transmitted light filter cube with phase contrast.\nImage 10% of each well from the center.\nNote: A different imaging area can be used, as long as this area remains consistent across time points and cell strains.\nNote: There is potential for a slight shift in the population of cells being captured each day due to shifts in the alignment of the plate in the vessel holder and cell migration, although this is very minimal. Capturing a set area of cells as opposed to selecting random fields of view throughout the well greatly reduces this risk and ensures the population of cells being analyzed remains consistent, since the impact of changes in cell location is minimal in a large area compared to a single field of view.\nUse autofocus set to “small structure” for optimal focus on the cells and neurites (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nSave the data as a stitched tiled imaged to use for quantification of neurite density.\nRepeat step 26 every 24 h to acquire images of the same fields of view to quantify neurite density over time.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2320-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Different PC12 cell clonal variants vary in their differentiation rates",
    "Neurite densities of 4 different PC12 cell clonal variants each containing a different inducible mutant form of the androgen receptor (not expressed in these experiments), were quantified daily during differentiation until the culture reached a neurite density of ∼1,500 μm/mm2. The time it took for the 4 clonal variants to reach the target neurite density varied from 3–6 days of differentiation, and clonal variants also differed in their propensity to proliferate and clump during differentiation. Representative images of each clonal variant are shown on the day they reached the target neurite density. Three wells per clonal variant were analyzed and data represent mean ± SD with α < 0.05. Images are cropped for clarity.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2320-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. AraC treatment reduces proliferation and cell clumping in differentiated PC12 cells\nPC12 cells were differentiated to a neurite density of ∼1,500 μm/mm2 and treated with 1 μM AraC for 48 h.\nThree days after AraC treatment, neurite-bearing cells exist as single cells in culture while proliferating cells are greatly reduced. (right, + AraC). In contrast, at the same timepoint in the absence of AraC treatment, neurite-bearing cells exist in clumps (left, - AraC, top) or are overtaken by proliferating cells (left, - AraC, bottom). Images are cropped for clarity.\nNote: Once the total neurite density reaches ∼1,500 μm/mm2 in a 0.033 cm2 area (the total neurite length in 10% of one well), the cells are at a sufficient level of differentiation for secondary analyses (see quantifying neurite density over time[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]). For the clonal variants used in this protocol, the desired total neurite density was reached in 3–6 days (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), although this window may be shorter or longer for other PC12 cell strains or clonal variants.",
    "Note: Neurites can continue to grow longer, and undifferentiated cells can grow new neurites, after the total neurite density in the well reaches ∼1,500 μm/mm2. Cells can be differentiated past this neurite density and used for secondary analyses, but Cytosine-beta-D-arabinofuranose hydrochloride (AraC) treatment may be needed to inhibit proliferation of undifferentiated cells and limit cell clumping (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). AraC interferes with DNA synthesis and therefore results in cell death of dividing cells without affecting neuronal cell survival or neurite outgrowth.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nMaintaining differentiating PC12 cell culture—Day 2 and every 2 days until end of experiment\nTiming: 1 h every 2 days\nDifferentiating PC12 cells are supplemented with NGF, CultureOne, and GlutaMAX every 2 days through half-feed media changes until PC12 cells reach a total neurite density of ∼1,500 μm/mm2. CultureOne is added to the medium to inhibit proliferation of undifferentiated cells during the differentiation process. AraC can also be used if there is an abundance of proliferation and/or cell clumping (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCritical: Perform all steps under sterile conditions in tissue culture hood.\nCalculate the volumes of stock differentiation medium, NGF, CultureOne, and GlutaMAX needed for a half-feed media change. Assuming the reagents remaining in the media in the well are inactive/degraded, make up supplemented media with reagents at double the desired final concentration.\nCalculate the total volume of stock differentiation medium needed for a final volume of 75 μL per well (+ 3 extra wells). Aliquot and pre-warm to 37°C.\nCalculate the volume of NGF stock to add to the aliquoted stock differentiation medium for a working concentration of 100 ng/mL (final concentration in each well will be 50 ng/mL).",
    "Calculate the volume of CultureOne supplement to add to the aliquoted stock differentiation medium for a working dilution of 1:25 (final dilution in each well will be 1:50).\nCalculate the volume of GlutaMAX to add to the aliquoted stock differentiation medium for a working concentration of 4 mM (since there is already 4 mM GlutaMAX in the stock differentiation medium, the final concentration in each well will be 4 mM).\nFrom the pre-warmed aliquot of stock differentiation medium, remove and discard the volumes calculated in steps 28b–d and add the calculated volumes of NGF, CultureOne, and GlutaMAX.\nPipette up and down a few times to mix.\nRemove and discard 75 μL of media from each well and add 75 μL stock differentiation medium supplemented with NGF, CultureOne, and GlutaMAX.\nRepeat steps 28–30 every two days until the neurite density reaches ∼1,500 μm/mm2 (see quantifying neurite density over time[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]).\nValidating neuronal differentiation—Day 0 through end of validation\nTiming: 4–6 days, in addition to cell culture time\nDifferentiated PC12 cells should express the neuronal proteins β-III-Tubulin, Synapsin-I, and GAP43.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] To verify expression of these proteins, differentiating PC12 cells are lysed throughout the differentiation process and neuronal proteins are detected through western blot analysis. Once PC12 cells have differentiated to a total neurite density of ∼1,500 μm/mm2, cells are fixed and evaluated for expression of the neuronal markers through immunocytochemistry.\nWestern blot analysis\nTiming: 2–3 days, in addition to cell culture time\nPC12 cells are plated on PDL-coated 6-well plates for differentiation. Cell lysates are collected for western blot analysis of neuronal proteins on Day 0 and every subsequent 2 days until the total neurite density reaches ∼1,500 μm/mm2 (as determined through steps 26 and 27 and quantifying neurite density over time[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]).",
    "Note: Depending on the differentiation rate of the cells, lysates may need to be collected every day to observe the increase in neuronal proteins over time.\nCoating wells\nTiming: 1 h\nSterilize wells in 6-well plates under UV light in tissue culture hood for 30 min, with lids removed from the plates.\nCells will be plated in triplicate for each timepoint at which cell lysates are collected. For example, if collecting lysates on days 0, 2, 4, and 6, a total of 12 wells will be required for the experiment.\nCells to be lysed on different days need to be plated in separate 6-well plates. Therefore, the above example requires 4 plates.\nLabel each plate with the day that cells will be lysed (i.e., “Day 0”, “Day 2”, “Day 4”, or “Day 6”).\nPrepare a 20 μg/mL working laminin solution by diluting laminin stock solution in cell culture grade water.\nAdd 1 mL working laminin solution to each well.\nWrap plates in parafilm and incubate for 16–24 h at 4°C.\nNote: Although not tested in this protocol, alternative 6-well plates that are not pre-coated with PDL might be suitable for differentiation, but wells must be coated with PDL (1.5 mL 50 μg/mL PDL per well) prior to laminin coating.\nPlating cells\nTiming: 1.5 h\nFollow steps 6–21 to plate PC12 cells, with the following alterations:\nIn step 16, plate PC12 cells at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2. This will yield a high enough protein concentration in the cell lysates to detect neuronal proteins through western blot.\nIn step 17, a final volume of 2 mL will be added to each well of a 6-well plate.\nIn step 18, add 1 mL PC12 cell culture medium to each well.",

These steps do not need to be performed under sterile conditions.\nPrepare 3.5 mL working Triton DOC lysis buffer from Triton DOC lysis buffer stock solution by adding the following reagents:\n17.5 μL 1 M MgCl2.\n7 μL 0.5 M EDTA.\n½ Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet.\n8.75 μL saturated Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) solution in isopropanol.\nCritical: PMSF is toxic if swallowed and can cause skin corrosion. Wear proper PPE when handling.\nNote: Add PMSF to lysis buffer immediately before lysing cells.\nNote: Although not tested in this protocol, an alternative lysis buffer may be used for cell lysis.\nAspirate media from the wells and wash cells in 1 mL DPBS with calcium and magnesium.\nAspirate DPBS and add 30 μL working Triton DOC lysis buffer to each well.\nNote: Make sure all DPBS is aspirated from the well before adding lysis buffer to avoid diluting the cell lysates (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).",
    "Scrape the cells in the well thoroughly in multiple directions with a mini cell scraper and add the cell lysate to a tube for sonication.\nCentrifuge lysates for 2–5 s in a mini centrifuge.\nSonicate cell lysates using a sonicator. In this protocol, the Bioruptor® Pico sonication device was set to 4°C and sonication settings were 6 cycles, 30 s on, 30 s off.\nPause point: Lysates can be stored at −80°C.\nMeasure protein concentrations in cell lysates using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit II or other suitable alternative, according to standard protocol.\nStore lysates at −80°C until all cells are lysed on subsequent days before running western blot.\nOptional: Lysates can be aliquoted prior to storing at −80°C to avoid excess freeze/thaw cycles if multiple western blots need to be run. Make aliquots in triplicate of at least 15 μg protein for each sample.\nRepeat steps 36–39 every 2 days to lyse cells at multiple time points during the differentiation process.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2320-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Therefore, every subsequent 2 days of the protocol, one fewer plate of cells will undergo a half-feed media change. Recalculate the volumes of media, NGF, CultureOne, and GlutaMAX needed for cell culture every 2 days to avoid wasting reagents.\nObserve differentiating PC12 cells under an inverted light microscope every day to verify that the cells are differentiating as expected.\nSDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), protein transfer, and immunoblotting\nTiming: 2–3 days (beginning after all cells are lysed)\nPrepare lysates for SDS-PAGE.\nCritical: Keep lysates on ice until boiling (step 43e).\nRemove lysates from −80°C and thaw on ice.\nTo an aliquot of 2× sample buffer stock solution, add 10% 2-Mercaptoethanol.\nNote: 2× sample buffer + 2-Mercaptoethanol can be stored at −20°C for a maximum of 1 month.\nCritical: 2-Mercaptoethanol is toxic if swallowed or inhaled, causes skin irritation and corrosion, and may be fatal in contact with skin. It is also toxic to aquatic life. Use in fume hood and wear proper PPE while handling. Dispose in proper waste container in fume hood.\nPrepare 1× running buffer from 10× running buffer stock solution.

Alternatively, two gels can be run, and after protein transfer and immunoblotting, one membrane can be stripped of bound antibody and reprobed for the third protein.\nOptional: If desired, PC12 (NGF-differentiated) lysates (ECM Biosciences Cat#PL7141) can be loaded on the gel as a positive control.\nNote: This protocol uses stain-free gels (poured using TGX Stain-Free™ FastCast™ Acrylamide Kit, 10%) for SDS-PAGE to normalize neuronal proteins of interest to total protein in each well. We have not evaluated whether expression of housekeeping genes used for normalization change with differentiation and therefore cannot guarantee their accuracy as a measure of total protein.\nAfter the dye front has left the gels, image gels for total protein using a ChemiDoc or other compatible imaging system.\nTransfer proteins from the gels to 0.45 μm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes in 1× transfer buffer according to standard protocol.\nIncubate the membranes with the following blocking solutions for 1 h at 20°C–25°C:\nMembranes 1 and 2: 5% nonfat dry milk in 1 × 0.05% TBST (these membranes will be probed for Synapsin-1 and GAP43).\nMembrane 3: 5% BSA in 1 × 0.05% TBST (this membrane will be probed for β-III-Tubulin).\nIncubate the membranes with the following primary antibodies diluted in their respective blocking solutions for 16–24 h at 4°C.",
