    "1. Construction of a Conventional Diffuse Reflectance and Total Transmittance Spectroscopic System\nNote: Construct the measuring systems for the diffuse reflectance and total transmittance spectra using a broadband white light source, a light guide, an achromatic lens, an integrating sphere, a sample holder, an optical fiber, and a multi-channel spectrometer. The role of the light trap is to remove the specular reflection component from the reflectance spectrum. The sample holder of the integrating sphere consists of a mounting plate and a dovetail and spring-loaded clamp assembly that holds the sample against the port. The dovetail and spring-loaded clamp assembly are removed from the sample holder and a hand-made cubic pedestal of polystyrene foam is attached to the mounting plate instead. The layouts of the optical components, shown in Figure 1a and 1b, can be referred to for the construction procedure for the diffuse reflectance measurements and the total transmittance measurements, respectively.\nConnect the spectrometer and a personal computer using the universal serial bus (USB) cable provided.\nAttach the port adapter to a detector port of the integrating sphere. Connect the spectrometer and the port adapter of the integrating sphere using an optical fiber. Connect the 150 W halogen lamp light source and the light guide.\nAttach the sample holder to a sample port of the integrating sphere. Attach the light trap to an appropriate port of the integrating sphere when performing the diffuse reflectance measurements. Turn on the halogen lamp light source to illuminate a sample via the light guide and the achromatic lens.\nOpen the operating software of the spectrometer.\n2. Preparation of an Acrylic Mold",
    "Note: An acrylic mold that consists of two rectangular acrylic pieces and a U-shaped acrylic piece is constructed to create a monolayer gel phantom. Figure 2 can be referred to for this construction procedure.\nCut out the two rectangular acrylic pieces from a 2-mm-thick acrylic plate to an optional size.\nCut out an acrylic piece from a 1-mm-thick acrylic plate to an optional size. Cut the 1-mm-thick acrylic piece so that it becomes a U-shaped piece to be used for the mold to make 1-mm thick epidermal phantoms.\nCut out an acrylic piece from a 5-mm-thick acrylic plate to an optional size. Cut the 5-mm-thick acrylic piece so that it becomes a U-shaped piece to be used as a mold to make 5-mm thick dermal phantoms.\nRemove any burrs from each acrylic piece using a metal file.\nMake the epidermal phantom mold by holding the 1-mm-thick U-shaped piece with the two 2-mm-thick acrylic pieces and fixing them with five foldback clips.\nMake the dermal phantom mold by holding the 5-mm-thick U-shaped piece with the two 2-mm-thick acrylic pieces and fixing them with five foldback clips.\n3. Preparation of Base Material\nPut 500 mL of standard saline with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl in a pod. Slowly add 5 g of agarose powder while stirring the mixture to avoid clumping.\nHeat the mixture of agarose powder and saline by an electric cooking heater with a 1,000 W power setting for 5 min.\nOnce the mixture boils, keep the mixture on low heat for 3 min.\nCool the mixture to a temperature of about 70 °C. Then pour the mixture into a container and keep it in a constant temperature bath at 60 °C for 30 min before making a phantom.\n4. Preparation of Skin-mimicking Optical Phantoms",
    "Note: A coffee solution is used to mimic the absorption spectrum of melanin. The coffee solution contains a brown pigment called melanoidin. The absorption spectrum of melanoidin has been reported to be similar to that of melanin10.\nPrepare an epidermal phantom\nPour 100 mL of pure water into the coffee maker reservoir. Place a filter in the coffee maker basket. Add 24 g of ground coffee into the filter. Turn on the coffee maker and press the brew button to begin brewing.\nPut 4 mL of brewed coffee and 16 mL of saline in a glass bottle to make a coffee solution.\nPut 5 mL of lipid emulsion (e.g., intralipid 10%) and 10 mL of the coffee solution into a transparent plastic cup. Slowly add 35 mL of the base material to this mixture while stirring.\nAspirate the mixture into a syringe and inject it slowly into the epidermal phantom mold while avoiding any bubble formation. Cool the acrylic mold containing the mixture at 5 °C for 20 min.\nRemove the foldback clips from the mold. Slide one of the acrylic pieces outward and remove it from the mold. Take the 1-mm-thick solidified gel phantom out of the mold and cut it to the desired size using a surgical scalpel.\nPlace and hold the gel phantom between two slide glasses.\nPrepare a dermal phantom containing oxygenated blood\nTake 5.0 mL of lipid emulsion and 0.4 mL of whole equine blood with 45%-hematocrit and put into a transparent plastic cup. Slowly add 44.6 mL of the base material while stirring the mixture.\nAspirate the mixture into a syringe and inject it slowly into the dermal phantom mold while avoiding any bubble formation. Cool the acrylic mold containing the mixture at 5 °C for 20 min.",
    "Remove the foldback clips from the mold. Slide one of the acrylic pieces outward and remove it from the mold. Take the 5-mm-thick solidified gel phantom out of the mold and cut it to the desired size using a surgical scalpel.\nPlace and hold the gel phantom between two slide glasses.\nPrepare a dermal phantom containing deoxygenated blood\nPut a dermal gel phantom containing oxygenated blood (from step 4.2.3) on a glass dish.\nDissolve 1 g of sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) into 20 mL of saline in a glass bottle.\nAdd 0.05 g/mL of Na2S2O4 solution onto the phantom using a syringe to deoxygenate the blood in the phantom.\nPlace and hold the phantom between two slide glasses to prevent it drying out.\nPrepare a two-layered phantom\nDrop 0.1 mL of saline onto a dermal phantom to ensure optical coupling between the epidermal and dermal layers. Place the epidermal phantom on the dermal phantom.\nIf any air bubbles are present between the layers, push them out by stroking the surface of the two-layered phantom with a fingertip.\nHold the two-layered phantom between two slide glasses to prevent it drying out.\n5. Acquisition of the Diffuse Reflectance Spectra\nAcquisition of dark spectra\n\tNote: The charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor in the spectrometer can estimate light intensity based on an electrical signal generated in response to incident light. However, there is dark noise37 which is independent of the signals generated by photons but is dependent on the device temperature, even if the sensor does not detect the light. To accurately measure the spectral intensity of light, the dark current signal should be measured as a dark spectrum and then subtracted from the sample spectrum. The dark spectrum is a spectrum taken with the light path blocked.",
    "Position the integrating sphere at an optimal position for the diffuse reflectance measurements (Figure 1a).\nTurn off the halogen lamp light source. Block the light path to the spectrometer using a port plug or a shielding plate.\nSelect the Store dark command from the file menu to store a dark spectrum.\nSelect the Subtract dark spectrum command from the file menu to subtract the dark spectrum from the measured sample spectrum (see below).\nAcquisition of reference spectra\n\tNote: The optical properties of the components used in this experiment, such as the light source, light guide, achromatic lens, optical fiber, and spectrometer, have their own wavelength-dependences. Therefore, the spectral intensity of light passed through these optical components should be measured as a reference spectrum. For the measurement of a diffuse reflectance spectrum, the reference spectrum is a spectrum taken with a standard white diffuser illuminated with the light from the light source.\n\t\nTurn on the halogen lamp light source by pressing the power button. Warm up the lamp for at least 10 min before acquiring a reference spectrum.\nPlace a standard white diffuser (e.g., Spectralon) at the sample port of the integrating sphere.\nAdjust the integration time of the spectrometer by selecting the suitable value from the drop-down list in the spectrometer operating software so that the peak signal intensity is approximately 75% of the spectrometer intensity maximum.\nSelect the Store reference command from the file menu to store a reference spectrum.\nAcquisition of sample spectra\n\tNote: A spectrum of the diffuse reflectance of the sample is acquired and saved on the hard drive of a personal computer using the same acquisition conditions.",
    "Place the epidermal phantom sandwiched by the two slide glasses at the sample port. Select the Save command from the file menu to save a diffuse reflectance spectrum to a file.\nRepeat step 5.3.1 for the dermal and two-layered phantoms.\n6. Acquisition of the Total Transmittance Spectrum\nAcquisition of dark spectra\n\tNote: The sensor in the spectrometer can estimate light intensity based on an electrical signal generated in response to incident light. However, there is dark noise which is independent of the signals generated by photons but is dependent on the device temperature, even if the sensor does not detect the light. To accurately measure the spectral intensity of light, the dark current signal should be measured as a dark spectrum and then subtracted from the sample spectrum. The dark spectrum is a spectrum taken with the light path blocked.\n\t\nPosition the integrating sphere at an optimal position for the total transmittance measurements (Figure 1b).\nRemove the light trap from the port of the integrating sphere and attach a port plug to the port.\nTurn off the halogen lamp light source. Block the light path to the integrating sphere using a port plug or shielding plate.\nSelect the Store dark command from the file menu to store a dark spectrum.\nSelect the Subtract dark spectrum command from the file menu to subtract the dark spectrum from the measured sample spectrum (see below).\nAcquisition of reference spectra",
    "Note: The optical properties of the components used in this experiment, such as the light source, light guide, achromatic lens, optical fiber, and spectrometer, have their own wavelength-dependences. Therefore, the spectral intensity of the light passed through these components should be measured as a reference spectrum. For the measurement of the total transmittance spectrum, the reference spectrum is a spectrum taken when the light from the light source is directly entering the integrating sphere through the sample port.\n\t\nTurn on the halogen lamp light source by pressing the power button. Warm up the lamp for at least 10 min before acquiring a reference spectrum.\nRegulate the integration time of the spectrometer by selecting the suitable value from the drop-down list of integration times in the operating software of the spectrometer so that the greatest light intensity shows a signal that is approximately 75% of the maximum values.\nSelect the Store reference command from the file menu to store a reference spectrum.\nAcquisition of sample spectra\n\tNote: The spectrum of the total transmittance of the sample is acquired and saved on the hard drive of a personal computer using the same acquisition conditions.\n\t\nPlace the epidermal phantom sandwiched by the two slide glasses at the sample port.

Estimating the Absorption and Light-scattering Properties",
    "Note: A set of the diffuse reflectance spectrum and the total transmittance spectrum is saved to the hard drive of a personal computer and analyzed offline. An inverse Monte Carlo simulation8,38,39,40 is then performed to estimate the absorption coefficient spectrum µa(λ) and the reduced scattering coefficient spectrum µs’(λ). In this inverse Monte Carlo simulation, the estimated scattering coefficient µs, under the assumption that the anisotropy factor g is 0, is regarded as the reduced scattering coefficient µs’. Both the reflectance and the transmittance data are used for a single simulation run. The detailed algorithm used in this protocol has been reported in previous literature8,39. We estimated the absorption coefficient spectrum µa(λ) and the reduced scattering coefficient spectrum µs’(λ) of an epidermal layer from a set of the diffuse reflectance spectrum and the total transmittance spectrum obtained from the epidermal layer. In the same way, we estimated µa(λ) and µs’(λ) of a dermal layer from a set of the diffuse reflectance spectrum and the total transmittance spectrum obtained from the dermal layer.\nOpen an input file for the Monte Carlo simulation.\nFill in the values of the measured diffuse reflectance and the total transmittance at the specific wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm at 10 nm-intervals in the input data file. Fill in the value of the phantom thickness in the input data file.\nSet the refractive index n of a layer to be an appropriate value in the input data file (e.g., n = 1.33 at 550 nm). Set the value of the anisotropy factor g to be 0 in the input data file.\nSet the initial values of the absorption coefficient µa and the scattering coefficient µs to be the appropriate values in the input data file (e.g., µa = 0.01, µs = 0.1).",
    "Execute the inverse Monte Carlo simulation program.\nType the input file name and then run the simulation.\nOpen the output file and check the final values of µa and µs after the iterative simulation is terminated.\nRepeat steps 7.1 - 7.7 for other desired wavelengths.\nSubscription Required.
