    "All experiments were performed under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 (PPL 70/7652) following local ethical approval.\n1. Setting up the Behavioral Apparatus\nNOTE: The main component of the behavioral apparatus is a variant of the Barnes maze13 consisting of a white acrylic circular platform (92 cm in diameter) with 20 equidistant, 5 cm diameter, circular holes, located radially, 5 cm from the edge of the platform. 19 of these are to be closed with black plastic plug (5 mm deep), while the remaining hole leads to a black Perspex shelter (dimensions 15 x 5.8 x 4.7 cm) that mice can easily enter and exit. The central area of the arena consists of a fixed circular platform (22 cm in diameter) and the periphery is mounted on a frame that allows rotation over 360 degrees through a computer-controlled stepper motor. The platform is elevated 45 cm from the floor to prevent the mice from climbing down. See schematic drawing in Figure 1.\nAttach visual cues to the periphery of the platform (2D or 3D symbols with different shapes, colors and patterns), at least 2 cm away from the edge to prevent mice from reaching them.\n\tNOTE: Examples of visual cues are plain blue squares of 262 cm2, or circles (diameter of 15.5 cm) filled with diagonal purple stripes.\nAdd ~2 g of bedding from the mouse's home-cage to the inside of the shelter to serve as a local olfactory cue. Optionally, position a light emitting diode (LED) at the entrance of the shelter to provide a local visual landmark cue.",
    "To isolate the mouse from external, distal visual cues, assemble an octagonal or cylindrical wall, extending 40 cm above and 15 cm under the platform surface, around the arena, positioned 10 cm away from the edge of the platform.\nPosition an ultrasound speaker 50 cm above the center of the platform, to deliver aversive auditory stimuli.\nPlace a translucent screen 64 cm above the arena to back-project overhead aversive visual stimuli using a projector.\nThe light provided by the projector will illuminate the behavioral apparatus; calibrate it so that there is 5-10 lx at the center of the platform surface. Place infrared lights and an infrared camera above the platform, with a long-pass filter (>700 nm) to prevent projector flicker in the acquired video.\nTrack the position of the mouse online, using either commercially available software or a suitable algorithm. For tracking black mice on a white arena, a simple thresholding operation followed by calculation of the mask centroid is appropriate.\nIdeally, place the behavioral apparatus inside a sound- and light-proof box, to prevent external cues from affecting the experiment.\n2. Delivering Innately Aversive Stimuli\nNOTE: The stimuli described below can be generated with a wide range of different software packages, including LabVIEW and Matlab.\nVisual stimulus\n\t\nProject the stimuli on to the screen positioned 64 cm above the arena. The stimulus consists of a linearly expanding dark circle on a grey background22 (Weber contrast = -0.98, luminance = 7.95 cd/m2).\n\t\tNOTE: The standard circle should ideally be centered directly above the position of the mouse, subtending a visual angle of 2.6° at onset and expands linearly at 224°/s over 200 ms to 47.4°, at which it remains for 250 ms before offset.",
    "When delivering the visual stimulus, center it above the mouse. This can be achieved either by waiting until the mouse passes through a pre-defined region in the arena, or by tracking the mouse position online and using the tracking coordinates to define the center of the circle.\n\t\tNOTE: Although we suggest projecting the visual stimulus directly above the mouse, defensive behaviors can also be elicited if the same stimulus is projected ahead of the mouse (while still parallel to the floor). In our experience, this is the case at least until 30 cm ahead of the mouse's position.\nAuditory stimulus\n\t\nTrigger a stimulus consisting of a train of three frequency-modulated up-sweeps from 17 to 20 kHz23 over 3 s, lasting 9 s in total. The sound pressure level (SPL), measured at the platform level, should be in a range between 73 and 78 dB.\nConnect a soundcard and an amplifier to the ultrasound speaker positioned above the arena to deliver the auditory stimulus.\n3. Animals:\nUse male or female C57BL/6J mice, between 6 and 24 weeks old. Maintain the animals on a 12 h light cycle with free access to chow and water.\nEnsure that the mice are single housed at least 72 h before the behavioral assay and test them during the light-phase of the light cycle.\n\tNOTE: We find that the baseline exploratory behavior of single-housed mice is more comparable across animals than across group-housed mice. In addition, animals with surgical implants for neural activity recording or manipulation often need to be single housed, and it can thus be beneficial to have control datasets in the same housing conditions.\n4. Standard Behavioral Assay:",
    "Meticulously clean the surface of the platform with 70% ethanol or acetic acid to remove unwanted olfactory cues. Rinse the shelter with water and wash it with 70% ethanol, after which it should be rinsed with water again to lessen the ethanol odor.\nDry both the platform and the shelter thoroughly, as the mouse may avoid entering the shelter if it is wet.\nRandomize the location of the shelter in the platform for each trial by rotating the platform before the experiment. The shelter location will be anchored in the arena but will be rotated in relation to the behavioral apparatus enclosure.\nBring the mouse to the experiment room in its home-cage and place the cage on top of the testing platform for a 10 min acclimatization period.\nRemove the mouse from its home-cage and avoid retrieving by the tail: either cup it or let it climb onto an enrichment item that can be lifted. Picking mice by the tail has been show to increase anxiety levels and thus may affect behavioral responses to threat24.\nGently place the mouse in the center of the arena and start the video-acquisition.\nAllow for a 7 min habituation period, during which no aversive stimulus is presented. Ensure that the mouse has enough time to find and enter the shelter at least once. Consider it as an entry if all four limbs are inside the shelter. 7 min should be enough for the majority of the mice to find and enter the shelter, but in case this does not happen, extend the habituation period by additional periods of 5 min until at least one entrance has been verified.",
    "Trigger the delivery of the aversive stimulus (auditory or visual) either manually by observing the live video feed, or automatically by tracking the position of the animal online and pre-defining a region of interest in the arena for triggering stimulus-delivery once the animal reaches it. The visual stimulus is usually delivered directly above the animal using the online video tracking coordinates.\nTo elicit more than one escape response in the same session, let the mouse voluntarily leave the shelter. If the mouse did not successfully escape to the shelter upon the last aversive stimulus, wait at least 60 s before presenting another stimulus.\nAfter the assay is finished, return the animal to its home-cage. In case further testing of the same mouse is required, wait at least 48 h before retesting.\nClean the platform and the shelter as described in step 4.1 and 4.2 before testing the next animal.\nNOTE: Steps 5, 6 and 7 are independent variations of the standard behavioral assay and each can be performed individually.\n5. 'Navigation Strategy' Behavioral Assay:\nNOTE: The goal of this assay is to determine what cues mice use to guide escape behavior. In this assay, the movable outer portion of the platform is rotated while the mouse is on the fixed arena center, which radially displaces the shelter, the olfactory cues located inside the shelter and the proximal visual cues attached to the platform. If the mouse is following any of the cues that have been rotated in order to navigate to the shelter, it will correctly escape to the new location of the shelter, but if it uses any other cues that have remained in place, it will navigate to the previous shelter location.",
    "Perform steps 4.1 to 4.8 of the standard behavioral assay described above, eliciting at least one flight response to be used as baseline.\nLet the mouse actively leave the shelter and wait for it to navigate to the central part of the platform. Position a small dish with bedding in the center to encourage exploration and keep the animal in the central platform long enough to allow the rotation of the outer portion of the platform. Add the dish and bedding while the mouse is inside the shelter and after the successful escape that precedes the rotation of the platform. If the mouse fails to enter the shelter during the escape response, wait for it to voluntarily enter the shelter and then add the dish and bedding.\nUse the stepper motor to rotate the platform at least 36 degrees (2 holes) and then immediately use a sensory stimulus to elicit an escape response. It is possible that the rotation triggers a startle and even initiates an escape response.\n\tNOTE: From our experience, ~55% of the mice will run outside of the central (non-rotating) platform while the external portion is still rotating, and these trials should be excluded from the analysis.\nClean the platform and shelter, and return the mouse to its home-cage as described in step 4.10 and 4.11.\n6. 'Dynamic Environment' Behavioral Assay:",
    "NOTE: This assay is designed to evaluate how mice adapt their defensive behaviors to sudden changes in the environment. In these experiments, after eliciting at least one escape response, the location of the shelter is changed and the mouse is allowed to visit it once before a subsequent escape response is triggered. If the mouse perfectly updates the new location of the shelter and computes the absence of the shelter in its previous location, it should escape to the new location. Otherwise, either it has not memorized the new location of the shelter or it has memorized both locations but prefers to escape to the old one.\nPerform this assay after steps 4.1 to 4.8 described above, eliciting at least one flight response as a control.\nOnce the mouse voluntarily leaves the shelter, remove the shelter and re-position it in a new hole at the opposite end of the platform.\nAllow the mouse to explore the environment until it enters the shelter at its new location.\nWhen the mouse voluntarily comes out of the shelter, present it with an aversive stimulus and observe its response.\nUse the auditory stimulus for this experiment because of its longer duration, as under prolonged threat, animals may perform additional escape responses to other locations if they fail to find the shelter at first.\nClean the platform and shelter and return the mouse to its home-cage as described in steps 4.10 and 4.11.\n7. 'No Shelter' Behavioral Assay:\nNOTE: The aim of this assay is to understand how the absence of a shelter in the environment affects the expression of defensive behaviors.\nPlug all 20 holes. In this experiment, there is no shelter available in the arena.\nAfter cleaning and drying the platform (steps 4.1 and 4.2), carry out steps 4.4-4.6.",
    "Allow a 7 min habituation period.\nPresent the visual stimulus and observe the defensive response. The lack of a shelter promotes freezing behavior, usually lasting for the duration of the visual stimulus. Use a slowly expanding spot (e.g. a circle that subtends a visual angle of 2.6° at onset and expands linearly at 11.2°/s over 4 s to 47.4°, at which it remains for 1 s before offset) to facilitate the observation of freezing responses.\nIf more than one response per mouse is required, use an inter-stimulus interval of at least 60 s.\nAfter obtaining the required number of responses in the absence of the shelter, introduce the shelter under one of the holes and let the mouse explore the environment for at least 5 min. 5 min will be enough time for most mice to find and enter the newly introduced shelter, but in case this does not happen, extend this period by additional 5 min blocks until at least one entry is verified.\nRepeat steps 4.8 and 4.9, and observe escape responses performed in the presence of a shelter in the environment.\nClean the platform and shelter and return the mouse to its home-cage as described in steps 4.10 and 4.11.\n8. Data Analysis:\nNOTE: Each of the following data analysis steps can be performed independently.\nEscape responses can be easily identified as a sudden acceleration following the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Quantify the latency to escape as the time between stimulus presentation and either the beginning of a head rotation movement directed at the target of the escape or the beginning of the acceleration movement, whichever comes first.",
    "Freezing responses can be characterized by total immobility of the animal except for breathing movements25, lasting at least 0.5 s7. Measure the latency to freeze as the time between the presentation of the aversive stimulus and the beginning of the immobility period.\nFor each escape response, quantify the linearity of the flight path by calculating the ratio of the distance between the mouse and the shelter and the actual displacement during the flight.\nFor each escape response, calculate the accuracy by measuring the distance between the hole where the animal directed its flight to and the hole leading to the shelter. Since there are 20 holes, each hole off target represents a decrement of 10% in accuracy (e.g., 2 holes off target can be expressed as 80% accuracy)\nFor the 'navigation strategy' behavioral assay, quantify the accuracy of the response relative to the shelter location before the platform rotation. An average accuracy that is not significantly different from the pre-rotation accuracy indicates that the animal is not using any of the sensory cues that were rotated in order to navigate to the escape target.\nFor the 'dynamic environment' behavioral assay, classify each escape response elicited as being directed towards the new or the old shelter location, or to neither of them. Evaluate how the pattern evolves along the iterations of the elicited defensive behaviors.\nFor the 'no shelter' behavioral assay, compare the mouse's speed following the presentation of aversive visual stimulus in the presence and absence of a shelter and calculate the latency to the initiation of the defensive response. Additionally, calculate the probability of triggering a freezing response in response to the stimulus for each situation."
