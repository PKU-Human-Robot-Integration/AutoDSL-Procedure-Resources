    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWorm preparation and fixation\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThe goal of this section is to harvest the worms and fix them. In this protocol we use 60% isopropanol to fix worms. However, due to the effect of fixatives on antigenicity,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] the optimal fixation condition may differ from one antibody to another.\nHarvest ∼200–500 worms per immunostaining using S-buffer (or M9 buffer) in 1.5 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge for 90 s at 400 × g and then aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend in 1 mL of S-buffer (or M9 buffer).\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 for a total of 2 washes. These steps are important to remove residual bacteria.\nAfter the second wash, aspirate the supernatant and add 500 μL of 60% isopropanol.\nFix for a minimum of 10 min.\nPause point: Worms can be fixed and kept in 60% isopropanol at −20°C for at least a month.\nCentrifuge for 90 s at 400 × g, and then aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend in 500 μL 0.5% PBS-T.\nRepeat steps 7 and 8 for a total of three washes.\nAspirate the 0.5% PBS-T after the third wash, and then resuspend the worms in 1 mL 1× PBS for 10 min.\nCentrifuge for 90 s at 400 × g and aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 300 μL of freshly prepared monomer solution and incubate the samples on a rocker or rotator at 4°C for at least an hour.\nNote: Samples can be left in the monomer solution overnight (12–16 h).\nNote: After fixation, worms become more prone to breaking. Therefore, worms should be allowed to settle either by gravity or through gentle centrifugation (<400 × g).\nNote: To save time, slide preparation may be performed during the ≥1 h incubation period (step 12).",
    "Critical: The monomer solution contains acrylamide, which is toxic, and should therefore be disposed of following appropriate hazardous waste-disposal procedures.\nSlide preparation\nTiming: <1 h\nThe goal of this section is to prepare the slides used for the worm embedding. The polyacrylamide gel containing the embedded worms will be created by sandwiching the gel-worm mixture between two slides: (a) the Repel-Silane PTFE/Teflon slide, which will help sandwich the gel-worm mixture while avoiding gel and worms sticking to the glass; and (b) the Bind-Silane slide, where the gel, and therefore the worms, will stick to.\nRepel-Silane PTFE/Teflon slide preparation:\nWash the PTFE/Teflon slides with distilled water (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2463-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of Repel-Silane PTFE/TEFLON and Bind-Silane slides\n(A–L) Steps 13(a–g) and 14(a–g).\nWash the PTFE/Teflon slides with freshly made 70% ethanol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nUse compressed air to dry the slides by blowing the air directly on the slides for about a minute (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: In case compressed air is not available the slides can be allowed to air dry however this may take a bit of time. We do not use Kim wipes to dry the slides to avoid lint.\nNote: It is critical for the slides to be clean, lint free, and dry.\nIncubate the PTFE/Teflon slides in Sigmacote or Repel-Silane for 15 s at room temperature (20°C–25°C) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nAir dry the slides at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nWash the slides with 70% ethanol followed by distilled water (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nAir dry the slides at room temperature (20°C–25°C) and keep them in a closed box until needed.\nNote: Optional - for a more durable coating the slides can be oven dried for 1 h at 65°C.\nNote: Silanized slides can be stored at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for up to 1 month.",
    "Bind-Silane slide preparation:\nWash standard microscope slides with distilled water (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nWash the slides with freshly made 70% ethanol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nAdd 50 μL of Bind-Silane to 50 mL of previously prepared Bind-Silane pre-solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).\nIncubate the slides in the Bind-Silane working solution for 30 s at room temperature (20°C–25°C) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J).\nAir dry the slides at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nWash the slides with distilled water (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).\nUse compressed air to dry the slides or allow the slides to air dry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L).\nNote: Silanized slides can be stored at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for up to 1 month.\nGel embedding\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIn this section we describe how to embed the worms in the polyacrylamide gel. Additionally, we describe how to place the silicon gasket around the worms to ensure that the solutions used in the next steps do not leak out of the gel that contains the worms.\nCentrifuge the worms that were rocking at 4°C for 90 s at 400 × g and aspirate the monomer solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2463-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of gel-embedded worms\n(A–E) Steps 15–19.\n(F) A microscope image of the sandwiched worms.\nCritical: The monomer solution contains acrylamide, which is toxic and should therefore be disposed following appropriate hazardous waste-disposal procedures.\nIn a separate tube, activate the monomer solution by adding the appropriate amount of 10% APS and 10% TEMED (refer to Materials section) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAdd 50 μL of activated monomer solution to the worms and resuspend gently by pipetting up and down (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: The activated monomer solution will remain liquid for at least an hour before solidifying. Nonetheless, we suggest that the APS and TEMED be added right before use.",
    "Cast 25 μL of activated monomer solution on the Bind-Silane slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Make sure not to transfer too many worms to avoid imaging overlapping specimens.\nRecommended numbers: ∼50–100 adult worms or ∼100–200 L2 worms.\nSandwich the sample by placing the Repel-Silane (PTFE) slide on top of the Bind-Silane slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nIncubate the slides at 37°C for 1 h in a humidified vacuum chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) to polymerize the gel.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2463-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Setting-up vacuum chamber for gel polymerization\n(A) Place wet paper towels at the bottom of the vacuum chamber.\n(B) Place the platform in the chamber and your slide on top of the platform.\n(C) Place the dome on top to close the chamber. Note the direction of the valve with the arrows pointing towards the plug, the chamber, and the side opening.\n(D) Remove the plug.\n(E) Place the vacuum hose in the side opening and turn the vacuum on.\n(F) Turn the valve so that the arrows are pointing towards the opening where the hose was placed, the closed side, and the chamber. Put the plug back in and leave it in this position for around a minute.\n(G) Turn the valve so the arrows are now pointing to the plug, the chamber, and the closed side.\n(H) Turn off the vacuum and remove it from the side. Place the vacuum chamber in a 37°C incubator for 1 h.\nBlack arrows were added for visual clarity. The arrows in the vacuum desiccator (Zoro #: G4673182) are red.\nNote: The polymerization is done in a vacuum chamber because oxygen inhibits free radical polymerization. Incubation can also be done in an argon or nitrogen atmosphere.\nRemove the sandwich from the chamber and place it on a clean workspace.",
    "Carefully remove the Repel-Silane (PTFE) slide by lifting it using a razor blade (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2463-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Preparing the slides for permeabilization & immunostaining\n(A–H) Steps 21–27. Arrows point to gel embedded worms.\nUsing the razor blade, cut the gel with the embedded worms (hereinafter referred to as the “sample gel”) into a rectangular shape estimated to fit tightly within the CultureWell silicon gasket (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nBefore placing the sample gel in the CultureWell silicon gasket, smooth all edges using a sharp razor blade as described below in substeps a-b and as depicted in Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C.\nNote: This cleaning step is critical to avoid leakage of liquid throughout the rest of the protocol.\nNote: Make sure not to create cracks in the slide by being forceful or by cleaning with the razor blade at the wrong angle.\nUse a razor blade at a 45° angle to remove all the excess gel around the area of interest to create a piece of sample gel that tightly fits into the silicon gasket and contains most of the embedded worms (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nOnce the excess gel is scraped off, use a Kimwipe with ethanol (200 proof) to thoroughly clean the area around the sample gel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nPlace the CultureWell silicon gasket around the sample while ensuring no air bubbles are created (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nNote: If you do create bubbles while placing the gasket, either remove the gasket and try again or use the back of the razor to remove the bubble by pressing it across the surface of the gasket (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).",
    "Note: The CultureWell silicon gasket can be cleaned with ethanol after the procedure and re-used. Store the silicon gasket by placing it between two microscope slides to avoid dust accumulation on the gasket which would affect its ability to stick to the slide. However, we have noticed that after several uses, the gasket tends to lose some of its stickiness.\nPipette 250 μL of 1× PBS into the well of the gasket and incubate for 5 min (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F and 4G).\nβ-Mercaptoethanol and collagenase permeabilization\nTiming: 6 h\nIn this section, we describe how to permeabilize the cuticle of the worm using β-mercaptoethanol and collagenase.\nAspirate the 1× PBS by placing the tip of the vacuum in the corner of the gasket (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nNote: Do not touch the gel directly with the vacuum.\nAdd 250 μL of 5% BME solution and incubate for 2 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber.\nAspirate the BME solution and add 250 μL of 0.5% PBS-T.\nAspirate the PBS-T and add another 250 μL 0.5% PBS-T for a total of two washes.\nAspirate and add 250 μL of collagenase buffer and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate and add 250 μL of collagenase mix and incubate for 4 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nBlocking and antibody staining\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this section, we describe the incubation of the samples in the blocking solution which will prevent non-specific binding of the antibodies. Additionally, we describe the staining of the worms with a primary and secondary antibody.\nAspirate the collagenase and add 250 μL of blocking buffer for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate and repeat for a total of two 5 min incubations in the blocking buffer.",
    "Note: The length of the blocking step and the concentration of the blocking buffer may need to be optimized for the antibody and protein of interest. If the background signal observed at the imaging step is high, then the length of incubation in the blocking buffer and the percentage of BSA in the blocking buffer can be increased.\nAspirate the blocking buffer and incubate the samples in 250 μL of the primary antibody solution overnight (12–16 h) at 4°C.\nNote: For the custom-made anti-LGG-1 rabbit antibody depicted in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] we used a 1/250 dilution, which is equivalent to 4.2 μg of antibody/mL. The concentration of primary antibody may need to be optimized based on the signal-to-noise ratio observed at the imaging step. If the signal at the imaging step is faint, then the primary antibody concentration may be increased.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2463-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

As previously reported,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] the most prominent signal in the head corresponds to the nerve ring. Additionally, immunostaining reveals strong LGG-1 signal in the pharynx, as well as anterior intestinal cells and muscle and hypodermal cells of the head. Inset depicts the corresponding DIC overlaid with the red channel.\n(C) Mid-body region of the worm. As previously described,4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] intestinal cells show the most prominent autophagic signal in the C. elegans midbody.

The samples were incubated overnight (12–16 h) in rabbit anti-LGG-1 primary antibody (1:250) followed by a 2 h incubation in goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500) (Invitrogen, Cat. #A11012). The images were taken with a Leica confocal microscope with an exposure time of 500 ms. Scale bar = 50 μm.\nThe next day, aspirate the primary antibody solution and wash with 250 μL of the ‘primary antibody solution’ without the actual antibody.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate and repeat for a total of three washes in the ‘primary antibody solution’ (without the antibody).\nAdd 250 μL of the secondary antibody solution and incubate for 2 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in the dark.\nNote: After adding the secondary antibody, samples should be kept away from direct light as much as possible and all subsequent incubations should be performed in the dark.\nNote: For the LGG-1 staining depicted in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] we used as secondary a 1/500 dilution of the Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen, Cat. #A11012). The concentration of the secondary antibody may need to be optimized based on the signal-to-noise ratio observed at the imaging step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2463-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "Worms were harvested at day 1 of adulthood and processed as described above. The samples were incubated overnight (12–16 h) in the primary antibody solution but without the primary antibody, followed by a 2 h incubation in goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500). The images were taken with a Leica confocal microscope with an exposure time of 1 s (twice as long as the exposure time used for Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Unlike Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], discrete punctate structures cannot be observed with the secondary antibody alone, demonstrating the specificity of the anti-LGG-1 immunostaining.

Chloroquine-treated C. elegans show coalescent LGG-1 signal\nThe gel-embedded immunostaining approach enables visualization of the expected LGG-1 response to chloroquine: coalescence of signal. This result was expected from bulk biochemical studies in C. elegans7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] and ample literature in other systems9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] but the response of the endogenous LGG-1 has not been shown in situ for adult C. elegans. Wild-type 1-day adult worms were treated for 6 h in chloroquine 20 mM before being harvested in parallel with worms that were left untreated. Both chloroquine-treated (right panel) and untreated (left panel) worms were processed as described above and incubated overnight (12–16 h) in rabbit anti-LGG-1 primary antibody (1:250) followed by a 2 h incubation in goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500) (Invitrogen, Cat. #A11012). The images were taken with a Leica confocal microscope and the exposure time for treated and untreated worms was 1 s. Scale bar = 50 μm.\nAspirate and wash with 250 μL of the ‘secondary antibody solution’ (without the actual antibody).\nNote: Optional – for nuclear staining, add 100ng/mL DAPI or Hoechst to the ‘secondary antibody solution’.",
    "Note: Optional – additional washing may be necessary if the background signal is too high (refer to problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: Optional – if staining nuclei incubate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate the solution and then remove the CultureWell silicon gasket.\nClean the slide with a Kimwipe with ethanol (200 proof).\nAdd a drop of mounting media (e.g., Vectashield SKU:H-1000-10).\nPlace a coverslip on top and seal it with nail polish.\nProceed to fluorescent imaging."
