    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing C. elegans expressing PercevalHR for imaging\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nATP synthesis enzymes and levels of ATP in whole body assays are altered by starvation (Chin et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). To avoid starvation related changes in ATP levels, maintain animals expressing PercevalHR as follows:\nGrow animals on the standard OP50 bacteria feeding strain for 2–3 generations without starvation before imaging. Additional resources on C. elegans culture, handling, and maintenance can be found in Wormbook “Maintenance of C. elegans[href=http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strainmaintain/strainmaintain.html]” (Stiernagle, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nUse plate-level morphological characteristics to select animals at the appropriate stage of development for PercevalHR imaging from an asynchronous, well-fed population. To select animals to examine AC invasion, assess vulval morphology using a dissecting microscope to identify mid L3 larval staged worms.\nPick mid-L3 larval worms from the plate with a platinum wire and mount onto an agar pad on a microscope slide.\nUse differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and high magnification on a compound microscope to identify the AC and its stage of invasion (e.g., pre-, during, post-; see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and “imaging ACs expressing PercevalHR using point-scanning or spinning disk confocal microscopy[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]” below).\nNote: If synchronized populations worms are required for the experiment, we recommend using sequential egg-laying to achieve a developmentally synchronized population instead of bleach synchronization and subsequent starvation induced L1 arrest, as L1 arrest introduces metabolic adaptations that could persist into larval development (Jobson et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).",
    "Critical: When conducting RNAi experiments using strains expressing PercevalHR, animals should be grown on RNAi bacteria (HT115) expressing empty vector control for 2–3 generations without starvation before transferring onto RNAi conditions for synchronized egg-laying. This prevents OP50 contamination on RNAi plates. Animals can then be transferred to blank NGM plates with no bacteria for 45–60 min to clear HT115 empty vector bacteria, before transferring to experimental RNAi plates.\nMicroscopy settings\nTiming: 15–20 min\nPercevalHR can be imaged using confocal microscopy. This step describes how to use either a Zeiss LSM 880 and Zen Black 3.2 software as an example of a point scanning confocal or a Zeiss AxioImager microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-10 spinning disc confocal, VersaLase(4) laser system and an ImagEM EMCCD camera and Micromanager software as an example of a spinning disk confocal. These instructions can be modified for use with other acquisition software.\nPoint-scanning confocal setup using a Zeiss 63× Plan-Apochromat 1.4NA oil immersion objective: set up the following channels in Zen Black (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1680-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Microscopy settings for Zeiss LSM 880 (point-scanning confocal) in Zen Black, related to step 5\n(A and B) This figure displays the two acquisition channels for PercevalHR image acquisition. The excitation wavelength, laser power, gain and pinhole size settings for the ATP-bound state are highlighted in green-dashed boxes (488 LSM), and the excitation wavelength, laser power, gain and pinhole size settings for the ADP-bound state are highlighted in cyan-dashed boxes (405 LSM). The wavelengths for the emission range are highlighted in orange-dashed boxes.\nChannel 1: Excitation 488 nm.\nChannel 2: Excitation 405 nm.\nEmission: 490–553 nm.\nPinhole size: 2.8 Airy units.",
    "Note: The recommended setup will result in a 2 μm thick central slice of signal from the AC in both the ATP-bound (488 nm) and ADP-bound (405 nm) channels. We opted to forgo optical sectioning due to the homogeneity of the cytoplasmic ATP:ADP ratio in the Z-axis and the ability to control pinhole size on a point-scanning confocal microscope.\nSpinning disk confocal setup using a Zeiss 100× Plan-Apochromat 1.4NA oil immersion objective: set up the following acquisition settings in Micromanager (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1680-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Microscopy settings for Zeiss AxioImager A1 (spinning-disk confocal) in Micromanager, related to step 6\n(A and B) This figure displays the two acquisition channels for PercevalHR image acquisition. The excitation wavelength and laser power settings for the ATP-bound state are highlighted in green-dashed boxes (Channel Laser 488) and the excitation wavelength and laser powersettings for the ADP-bound state are highlighted in cyan-dashed boxes (Channel Laser 405 Perceval). The emission filter wheel wavelengths highlighted in orange-dashed boxes.\n(C) Optimal settings for z-stack acquisition of PercevalHR images. The black-dashed box highlights the start and end positions and z-step size of the intended z-stack (in μm). The green and cyan-dashed boxes highlight the exposure timing (in ms) of the ATP-bound (Channel: Laser 488) and ADP-bound (Channel: Laser 405 Perceval) respectively.\nChannel 1 (Channel 488): Excitation laser 488 nm, Emission filter 525 nm.\nChannel 2 (Channel 405 Perceval): Excitation laser 405 nm, Emission filter 525 nm.\nZ-step: 0.5 μm.\nNote: The recommended setup will result in ∼0.3 μm thick slices of signal from the AC in both the ATP-bound (488 nm laser) and ADP-bound (405 nm laser) channels. To collect sufficient signal from the central 2 μm of the AC, we imaged five central slices of the AC that were then summed into a projection for analysis.",
    "Note: Laser power settings will vary across image acquisition systems and laser power should be optimized for each channel. Image acquisition should result in at least ∼1.5–2 fold greater average cytoplasmic signal compared to average background signal in both acquisition channels for the most accurate ATP/ADP ratio determination. Care should be taken when choosing the laser power for the 405 nm laser to balance the best signal collection with the potential negative problem of photobleaching during acquisition (refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 4 for more details). We have found that if laser power is not optimized, there can be insufficient signal compared to background in the ADP bound channel. This can lead to aberrantly high ATP:ADP ratio values after image processing and it can limit the detection of a further reduction in ADP levels (refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 3 for more details).\nAnesthetizing and mounting C. elegans for imaging\nTiming: 30 min\nAnimals expressing PercevalHR must be immobilized for accurate alignment between the ATP and ADP channels to generate a ratiometric image during analysis. This section will provide detailed steps for anesthetizing and mounting L3 larvae immersed in anesthetic solution onto a 5% noble agar pad for subsequent imaging (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). For additional detailed instructions and videos on transferring and anesthetizing worms and making agar microscopy pads, see Nature Protocols article, “Live-cell confocal microscopy and quantitative 4D image analysis of anchor-cell invasion through the basement membrane in Caenorhabditis elegans” (Kelley et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1680-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Anesthetizing and mounting worms for image acquisition, related to steps 7 and 8\n(A) Collect animals from NGM feeding plates and place them in 100 μL of 5 mM levamisole anesthetic in a well of a glass spot plate by gently swirling the pick in liquid. Anesthetize for 15–20 min.",
    "(B) Prepare a noble agar pad that is smaller than a 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip by compressing a drop of warm 5% noble agar between two clean slides that are spaced with two guide-slides prepared with lab tape.\n(C) Transfer anesthetized worms to the agar pad using a mouth pipette. Remove excess buffer and carefully place a 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip at an angle to prevent creation of bubbles.\n(D) Seal the edges of the coverslip using warm VALAP solution applied with a fine paintbrush. Leave two small gaps in the VALAP seal to allow gas-exchange.\nAnesthetize C. elegans in levamisole.\nIn one well of a glass spot plate, dilute 200 mM levamisole stock to a 5 mM working stock in 100 μL of M9 buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nUsing a platinum wire pick, transfer 20–30 animals into the well of the glass spot plate. Limit the transfer of E. coli from the culture plate as bacteria will interfere with anesthetizing and later imaging. Swirling the pick gently and moving it in and out of the buffer slowly will help move the animals off the pick without introducing excess E. coli into the buffer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). If large chunks of E. coli are being introduced into the anesthetic, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1 for alternative transfer techniques.\nAllow animals to anesthetize at room temperature for 15–20 min. This is sufficient to immobilize animals for up to 1.5 h if maintained in the anesthetic solution on the agar pad while imaging, since AC invasion occurs between two developmental starvation-induced developmental arrest checkpoints (Schindler et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nMount C. elegans onto agar pad.",
    "Prepare a 5% (weight/volume) noble agar pad (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) that is sized so that it is slightly smaller than a 22 mm × 22 mm coverslip (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nTransfer 20–30 anesthetized animals onto the prepared agar pad using a mouth pipette. Remove excess M9 buffer using the edge of a Kimwipe or mouth pipette. Gently place the coverslip over the animals on the agar pad starting with one edge and then slowly lowering the coverslip until the opposite edge rests on top of the pad. Then, seal the edges of the coverslip using a fine paintbrush and VALAP, leaving two small gaps on opposing sides of the coverslip to allow for gas-exchange (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nNote: To image PercevalHR in the AC (or any other cell type), animals should not be anesthetized in sodium azide. Although sodium azide is a common anesthetic used to immobilize C. elegans for microscopy, it is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP metabolism and will impact cellular ATP levels and PercevalHR readout (Harvey et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Tsubaki and Yoshikawa, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). Instead, we use 5 mM levamisole with and without polystyrene beads. Refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 5 for more details.\nImaging ACs expressing PercevalHR using point-scanning or spinning disk confocal microscopy\nTiming: 2 h\nAfter mounting onto a slide, each animal expressing PercevalHR is imaged once at a single developmental time-point.\nPlace the slide from above with anesthetized L3 staged animals expressing PercevalHR onto the microscope stage and bring the AC into focus.\nFind L3 staged worms using a low magnification (10× or 20× air objective) and mark X-Y coordinates in Zen Black or Micromanager.",
    "Switch to higher magnification (63× or 100× oil-immersion objective) and using DIC microscopy, determine the precise developmental stage of the AC using the number of P6.p vulval precursor cell descendants as shown previously (Kelley et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) and schematic in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nUsing the 488 nm laser bring the central plane of the AC into focus. In this plane, the nucleus, which lacks PercevalHR signal, should appear at its largest (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D, asterisk).\nCritical: Low laser power should be used when selecting and bringing ACs into focus to prevent photobleaching. We also recommend using the 488 nm laser, which has a longer wavelength and results in less phototoxicity and photobleaching of PercevalHR signal compared to the 405 nm laser.\nAcquire PercevalHR images.\nPoint-scanning confocal microscope:\nSet both lasers to their required laser power. We found 22% for the 488 nm laser and 8% for the 405 nm laser to be optimal laser power settings on a Zeiss LSM 880.\nAcquire fluorescence signal from the ATP-bound and ADP-bound channels simultaneously through the emission filter stated in microscopy settings[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2].\nSpinning-disk confocal microscope.\nSet both channels to their required laser powers and exposure settings. We found 18% laser power and 250 ms exposure for the ATP-bound channel and 488 nm laser, and 35% laser power and 400 ms exposure for the ADP-bound channel and 405 nm laser to be optimal settings on a Zeiss AxioImager equipped with an ImagEM EMCCD camera and VersaLase(4) laser system.\nAcquire confocal z-stack in both channels.\nPercevalHR image processing\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "The ATP:ADP ratio within the cell or tissue is determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity of the pixels in the ATP-bound channel (488 nm channel) by the intensity of the pixels in the ADP-bound channel (405 nm channel). For a video tutorial on PercevalHR image processing and analysis, refer to Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nPreparing ratiometric PercevalHR image.\nOpen .tiff files directly in Fiji. When using proprietary (Zeiss, Nikon, Andor etc.) file formats such as .czi, import images using the Bio-Formats Importer plugin “Plugins > Bio-Formats > Bio-Formats Importer. The Bio-Formats plugin package can be downloaded from https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/[href=https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/].\nIf the two channel image files are combined, split the 488 nm and 405 nm channels apart using “Image > Color > Split Channels”. Ensure that the two images have different names or unique identifiers for future steps (e.g., C1 and C2 at the end of the file name).\nIf using data in the form of a single 2 μm thick slice from a point-scanning confocal as in step 1, proceed to part d. below. If the data were collected as z-stacks, it is important to create sum projections of each channel separately to include all the pixel values in the core of the cell. This can be done by “Image > Stacks > Z Project…” and choosing “Sum Slices” from the ”Projection type” dropdown menu.\nTo obtain the ATP:ADP ratio, the pixel values in the 488 nm channel must be divided by the pixel values in the 405 nm channel using the Image Calculator function “Process > Image Calculator”. Within the Image Calculator window, use the “Operation” dropdown menu to select “Divide”. Select the 488 nm image as Image 1 and the 405 nm image as Image 2. Check the boxes for “Create new window” and “32-bit (float) result”.",
    "This is the final ratiometric ATP:ADP image. Each pixel value in the image represents the ATP:ADP ratio of that pixel of the cell.\nOptional: When the range of pixel values in the ratiometric image does not extend through the full bit-depth of the detector, images should be contrast-stretched (the displayed minimum and maximum pixel value adjusted) to display only the range of pixel intensities within the cell being imaged. These pixel values can set using “Image > Adjust > Brightness and Contrast > Set”. For publication, the same displayed minimum and maximum pixel values should be set for all images within an experiment to facilitate accurate comparison. To better visualize and represent heterogeneities in cellular distribution of ATP:ADP ratio, this image can also be represented as a spectral heatmap using “Image > Lookup Tables > 16 color” (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Additional resources about displaying fluorescence images can be found in (Johnson, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nQuantifying PercevalHR images.\nTo quantify the total ATP:ADP ratio within the cell, draw a region of interest (ROI) using the freehand selection tool around the whole cell and measure the mean pixel values within the selection (“Analyze > Measure” or “m” key shortcut). Use the same ROI to measure the mean background pixel values (within the worm but away from the PercevalHR expressing cell). The final ATP:ADP ratio value for each cell can be represented as: [mean intracellular pixel intensity] – [mean background pixel intensity].",
    "To quantify local enrichment of ATP:ADP ratio within a cell, draw ROIs around the regions to be compared (e.g., basal vs. apical) and measure the mean pixel values. Compute the background corrected ATP:ADP values for each region using the background value as determined above. The relative enrichment of one region compared to the other can then be represented as a ratio of their final ATP:ADP ratio values.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1.
