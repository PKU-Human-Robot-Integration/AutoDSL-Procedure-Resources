    "Tissue FixationThe procedure described in this section is for preparing organoid tissue and is an adaptation of the one described in Lopes et al. (2019).If beginning with samples already embedded in paraffin: Skip directly to section B, step 10. The procedure below assumes organoids cultured in transwell inserts in 6-well plates (Bantounas et al., 2018). If a different size well and/or insert is used, change volumes proportionally in Steps A1-A7.Prepare “wash” and “fixation” 6-well plates, allowing one well per transwell insert of organoids:Wash plate(s): Add 1.2 ml PBS into each well.Fixation plate(s): Add 1.2 ml of 4% PFA into each well.Transfer the transwell inserts from the culture plate to the wash plate prepared above.Carefully add 1 ml of PBS into each transwell and swirl the plate gently to wash the organoids.Using a Gilson or a 3 ml Pasteur pipette, remove the PBS from inside the transwells.Transfer the transwells from the “wash” to the “fixation” plate (i.e., on top of the PFA that is already in each of the wells).Add 1 ml 4% PFA into each transwell making sure that the organoids are fully covered.Note: You may add more PFA, if necessary, to completely cover the organoids. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Remove the PFA from the transwells and transfer them to a new wash plate, prepared as in Step A1a, above.Wash the organoids twice with PBS by repeating Steps A2-A4 as above.Using a 3 ml plastic Pasteur pipette, take some of the PBS of the last wash in the transwell and expel it onto each organoid, with just enough force so as to dislodge it (but take care not to be too forceful, which can break up the organoid).Using the same 3 ml Pasteur, transfer each organoid into a separate fresh 1.",
    "5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 400 μl PBS. The fixed organoids can be stored at 4°C in PBS for up to one week before embedding.Embedding fixed tissue in paraffin and sectioningA visual guide to the embedding and sectioning of tissues, which is also applicable to our organoids in this section, can be found at this address: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-LIbAWPc-g[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-LIbAWPc-g] (accessed in 2021).Label a number of plastic tissue embedding cassettes (point 8, in Materials and Reagents; Figure 1, Left) equal to the number of organoids with a pencil or permanent marker pen to distinguish between samples.Place a tissue processing capsule (point 9, in Materials and Reagents; Figure 1, Right) into each plastic tissue cassette, both with lids off.Using a plastic Pasteur pipette, carefully transfer one organoid into the capsule base.Replace the lid on the tissue processing capsule, followed by the lid on the tissue cassette.Immerse the cassette into 70% ethanol.Repeat Steps B3-B5 for each organoid.Transfer the cassettes to the tissue processor (Leica ASP300S or equivalent) and run a program following the steps as listed in Table 1.Table 1.

    "The next day, take the cassettes out of the tissue processor and transfer them into paraffin wax, using a Heated Paraffin Embedding Station, as follows:Open the plastic cassette followed by the tissue processing capsule.With the aid of liquid wax from the embedding station, carefully push the organoid into a metal mold.Carefully position the organoid in the middle of the mold.Allow to set for a few seconds on a Cold Plate (see Equipment). Top up the mold with liquid wax, place the plastic cassette, without lid, on the top of the mold and leave it to solidify on the cold plate for about 2 h.Repeat Steps B8a-B8d for each organoid.Place the blocks in a container of melting ice/icy water for at least 15 min before sectioning and using a microtome, produce serial 5 µm sections of the paraffin block containing the organoid.Allow the tissue sections to extend (so that any creases are straightened out) on the surface of clean warm tap water and then transfer them to labelled microscope slides. Allow to dry out on a warm plate and transfer to a 37°C oven overnight for further drying.Deparaffinization of tissue sectionsCaution: All steps in this section should be performed in a chemical hood. Prior to starting the procedure, prepare a series of eleven jars containing the solvent solutions mentioned in each of the steps below.Place the slides in a slide rack and immerse into a jar of xylene for 5 min.Immerse in a 2nd jar of xylene for 5 min.Immerse in a 3rd jar of xylene for 5 min.Immerse 10 times (2-3 s each time) in a jar of 99.9% ethanol.Immerse 10 times (2-3 s each time) in a 2nd jar of 99.9% ethanol.Immerse in a 3rd jar of 99.9% ethanol for 5 min.",
    "Immerse 10 times (2-3 s each time) in a jar of 96% ethanol.Immerse in a 2nd jar of 96% ethanol for 5 min.Immerse 10 times (2-3 s each time) in a jar of 70% ethanol.Immerse in a 2nd jar of 70% ethanol for 5 min.Immerse in a jar of PBS for 5 min.Proteinase K treatmentThe Proteinase K concentration and length of treatment presented below were optimized for PFA-fixed, paraffin-embedded human embryonic kidney tissue and kidney organoids. For different fixation methods and/or tissue types, these parameters need to be re-optimized (see Note 2).Add 0.75 μl Proteinase K stock solution per ml of Proteinase K buffer (see Recipe 5) to obtain 1× Proteinase K reagent. For our fixation/tissue combination (Bantounas et al., 2021), we determined the optimum concentration to be 0.33×; therefore, further dilute the 1× Proteinase reagent 1 in 3, with Proteinase K buffer (see Note 2). Make enough working solution for approximately 300 μl of final reagent per section to be stained (although less may be enough in the case of the organoids).With the slides on a flat surface, apply 300 μl (or enough to cover the section) of Proteinase K reagent directly onto each section.Transfer the slides to a pre-heated hybridization oven and incubate at 37°C for 10 min (see Note 2).Place the slides onto a slide rack and wash twice by immersing into a jar of PBS.Probe hybridizationThe final probe concentrations and hybridizing temperature given below are specific for the miRNAs we studied in Bantounas et al. (2021) and are given as examples. These parameters should be optimized separately for each individual miRNA (see Note 3). We recommend that alongside the miRNA of interest, a negative control (scrambled) probe, as well as a positive (U6 snRNA) probe is used (see also Table 2).",
    "Dilute the 2× Formamide-free miRNA ISH buffer with an equal volume of RNase-free water to obtain 1× miRNA ISH buffer. Prepare enough for all probe/section combinations (see Step E2).In an RNase-free Eppendorf tube, dilute the probe stock in 1× miRNA ISH buffer appropriately to obtain the desired working/final concentration LNA® probe mix (see Note 3). Table 2 shows examples of probes optimized at different final concentrations as used in Bantounas et al. (2021). The final volume should be enough to add 50 μl per section (although you can scale up or down depending on the size of your section).Table 2.

Then, centrifuge briefly to collect all the liquid at the bottom of the tube.Prepare a slide holding staining tray by placing wet tissue at the bottom and place the slides on top, as shown in Figure 2A.Apply 50 μl of LNA® probe mix onto each section and replace the lid on the staining tray (Figure 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4150/bioprotoc-11-17-4150-g002.jpgFigure 2. Set up of slides on staining tray, with wet tissue underneath to prevent evaporation of the applied solution during hybridization Place the slide box in the oven at 55°C (see Note 3) for 1 h.Remove the slide box from the oven, place the slides in a slide rack and immerse in a jar containing 5× SSC buffer (Recipe 6).Prepare a series of six jars containing different concentrations of SSC buffer (see Recipe 6), as detailed below in Table 3, and wash the slides by serially immersing in each of them for 5 min. Keep the jars in a waterbath set at the hybridization temperature, except the last one (#6), which should be at room temperature.Table 3.

    "Transfer the slides into a jar containing PBS.Antibody-detection and visualization of bound probeCaution: In the blocking and immunostaining steps below, do not let the tissue sections dry out, as this can lead to a very high background signal and also risks compromising the integrity of the tissue. Using the KP marker (see Materials), apply a hydrophobic barrier around each section.Add 50 μl (or enough to cover the section) blocking solution (Recipe 8) per section and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.During blocking, dilute the anti-digoxigenin (anti-DIG-AP) antibody 1:400 (see Note 4) in antibody dilution buffer (Recipe 9), allowing 50 μl (or enough to cover the section) per section.Remove the blocking solution by tipping the slides, then apply the antibody to the sections and incubate with the antibody at room temperature for 1 h.Wash the slides three times by placing them in a slide rack and successively immersing in three jars containing fresh PBS-T 0.1% (Recipe 7) for 3 min each.To make the AP reaction substrate, dissolve an NBT-BCIP tablet in 10 ml distilled water. Then, add 20 μl Levamisol stock solution (see Recipes) (2 μl per ml of NBT-BCIP solution).Caution: The substrate solution must be used immediately and be protected from light.Apply 50 μl (or enough to cover the section) substrate per section and incubate in the dark for 2 h in a 30°C oven (see Note 5).To stop the reaction, place the slides in a slide rack and immerse in a jar containing KTBT buffer (Recipe 10) for 5 min.Repeat the above wash a second time.Wash the slides with distilled water twice, for 1 min each.Apply 50 μl (or enough to cover the section) Nuclear Fast Red counterstain for 1 min.Place the slides in a slide rack and into a jar containing tap water.",
    "Rinse under running tap water for 10 min.The slides can be examined and imaged using a brightfield microscope. MiRNA-positive cells will be stained blue. Optionally, to capture the entire section in detail, use a 3D-Histech Panoramic-250 microscope slide-scanner. Subsequently, images can be analysed and snapshots captured with the CaseViewer software and further processed using ImageJ. Representative results can be seen in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4150/bioprotoc-11-17-4150-g003.jpgFigure 3.
