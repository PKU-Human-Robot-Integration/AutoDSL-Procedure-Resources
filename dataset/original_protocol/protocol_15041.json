    "Procedures involving animal subjects follow animal care guidelines outlined by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of British Columbia.\nProcedures mentioned in this protocol will be described for both rats and mice, while the representative results will be presented from Sprague-Dawley rats.\n1. Preparation of DNBS and Intrarectal Administration\nFor rectal instillation of DNBS in rats, freshly prepare 15-30 mg of DNBS/250 µl of 50% ethanol. For mice, prepare 2-6 mg of DNBS/100 µl of 50% ethanol. Note: Optimize the exact DNBS concentration to be administered at each facility. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, and C57BL/6 mice are preferred for induction of DNBS colitis, however other mouse and rat strains can be used. Mice and rats treated only with 50% ethanol can be used as control groups however given the effects of ethanol are mild or absent, one can omit the inclusion of this group for a study12.\nAttach a 1 ml syringe to a 19 G needle that has a polyethylene catheter (PE-90 - rats or PE-50 - mice) fastened to its end.\nLightly anesthetize the rat or mouse resting on a heating pad (e.g. by administering 1.5% isoflurane via nose cone, animals should still have blink and swallowing reflexes and display regular respiration). Apply tear gel to its eyes to avoid the eyes drying out.\nGently apply pressure with fingertips to the posterior end of the animal to remove any stool that may be present in the distal colon.",
    "Gently insert the catheter intrarectally, with the catheter reaching approximately 8 cm proximal to the anus for rats, or 3-4 cm for mice. Inject a small amount of the solution while inserting the catheter to lubricate, allowing easier insertion. Note: If any resistance is felt while inserting the catheter, do not continue to insert as this may lead to perforation of the intestinal wall. Remove the catheter and attempt to gently reinsert, again lubricating the colon as proceeding.\nSlowly inject 250 (rats) or 100 (mice) µl of DNBS, or an equal volume or 50% ethanol for controls. After injecting the DNBS, position the animal head-down for 90 sec to avoid loss of the DNBS.\nAfter DNBS administration, feed the animals 8% sucrose water in 0.2% saline to prevent dehydration during the first week.\nCarefully observe the animals, with daily monitoring for weight loss and signs of dehydration or distress for the duration of the experiment. Note: Weight loss may rapidly approach the CCAC recommendations of maximum permissible weight loss. Since this mostly derived from dehydration, weight loss should be used as an indicator for administering lactated Ringer's solution to limit dehydration. Please be sure to consult with the facility veterinarian on health issues as appropriate.\n2. Collecting Tissues and Assessing Histological Damage in DNBS Challenged Mice\nAt the desired time point after challenge with DNBS, euthanize animals by overdosing with isoflurane in an anesthetic chamber supplemented with sufficient oxygen. Observe the animal until no rising or falling of the chest is seen and there is no palpable heartbeat. Confirm the animal has been correctly euthanized by absence of a response to toe pinch or touching of the cornea, followed by cervical dislocation.",
    "Open the abdominal cavity and remove the entire large intestine. Open the intestine longitudinally; macroscopic mucosal ulcers should be observed approximately 5-6 cm proximal from the distal end of the colon in rats (2-3 cm in mice). Note: After removing the large intestine, assess macroscopic damage scores if desired. Collect segments of colon from corresponding anatomical location from control animals. Note: The individuals scoring the tissue for macroscopic damage scores should be blinded to the identity of the treatment groups. Score tissue sections using the following or similar criteria: severity and extent of ulceration (0-10), summed with scores for absence or presence of diarrhea (0 or 1), adhesions (0, 1, or 2) and maximal colonic wall thickness in millimeters11.\nCollect 0.5 cm sections proximal to the site of maximal macroscopic damage. Snap freeze one 0.5 cm section in liquid nitrogen to later assess myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (a measure of neutrophil infiltration), and place the other section in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological analysis. Note: Snap frozen tissues for myeloperoxidase assay can be stored at -80 °C for up to 1 month.\nAllow the tissues collected for histological analysis in step 2.3 to fix in formalin overnight, and then wash with 70% ethanol. Embed tissues in paraffin and cut to desired thickness (3-5 µm), stain with hemotoxylin and eosin (HE) for histological scoring.",
    "Have two observers score at least three tissue sections from each animal under a light microscope to determine the histological damage scores for each group. Note: The individuals scoring the tissue for histological damage scores should be blinded to the identity of the treatment groups. Score tissue sections using the following or similar criteria: extent of inflammatory cell infiltrate (0 = absent, 3 = transmural), loss of mucosal architecture (0 = absent, 3 = severe), presence or absence of crypt abscesses (0-1), and goblet cell depletion (0-3). Determine histological damage score as the sum of these scores11.\n3. Performing Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Assay on DNBS Challenged Intestinal Tissue\nAssay MPO activity in the 0.5 cm colonic segments obtained in step 2.3. Homogenize tissues in MPO homogenization buffer (0.5% hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0)) to give a 50 mg colon segment/ml of homogenization buffer suspension.\nAliquot the homogenized solution into 1 ml portions and centrifuge at 4 °C for 2 min at 10,000 x g.\nMix 100 µl of each aliquot with 2.9 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.167 mg/ml of o-dianisidinedihydrochloride and 0.0005% hydrogen peroxide in a cuvette.\nMeasure the rate of absorbance using a spectrophotometer at 460 nm. Note: MPO activity is defined as the quantity of enzyme degrading 1 µmol/min of H2O2 to H2O at room temperature and is expressed in units per mg of tissue.\nSubscription Required.
