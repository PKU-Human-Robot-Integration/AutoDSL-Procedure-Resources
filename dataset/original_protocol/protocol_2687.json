    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnesthetize mice\nTiming: 3 min\nIn this step, users will anesthetize animals via isoflurane inhalation.\nPlace the mouse in an anesthesia chamber with 2% isoflurane delivered with 2% oxygen.\nMaintain body temperature by placing the anesthesia chamber on top of an electrical heat pad.\nMonitor the mouse closely and remove once consciousness is lost.\nNote: Sufficient anesthetization can be judged by the loss of withdrawal response to toe pinch.\nAdminister a small amount of eye ointment to avoid corneal drying and trauma.\nTransfer the mouse to the aseptic surgical area, and maintain anesthetization with 2% isoflurane with 2% oxygen delivered via nose-cone.\nCritical: Body temperature should be maintained throughout the surgical procedure using an electrical heat pad.\nNote: Users are required to monitor the breathing rate of animals and adjust the isoflurane flow-rate accordingly throughout surgery. The amount of isoflurane administered may need to be optimized for different mouse strains.\nIntrasplenic injection of tumor cells\nTiming: 10 min\nIn this step, users will inject cancer cells into the spleen and perform a splenectomy.\nPosition the mouse in a lateral position on its right side.\nShave fur along the torso of the mouse (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), and clean the skin with 80% ethanol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2342-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Subcostal incision\nNote: Users may wish to perform this step 1–2 days in advance to save time if numerous surgeries are planned.\nWipe the site of fur removal with gauze soaked in 2% Chlorhexidine, then with 80% ethanol.\nDry the skin with a clean piece of gauze.\nPalpate the region just below the ribs and make a single subcostal incision (approx. 1.5 cm) to access the peritoneal cavity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Gently expose the spleen and associated splenic ligaments using forceps, and place a dry square of gauze underneath the organ to hold it in place (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2342-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Expose spleen and place on gauze\nResuspend KPC pancreatic cancer cells by gently pipetting up and down.\nDraw up 50 μL of cancer cells in a Hamilton syringe, and attach a 27G needle tip. Ensure that air bubbles are absent.\nCritical: It is imperative that cancer cells are properly resuspended, as clumping of cells can block the splenic vessels and result in premature death during surgery.\nGently insert the tip of the needle (3 mm) into the spleen, and slowly inject cancer cells over a period of 40 s. Splenic distension/paling should be visible (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2342-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Intrasplenic injection of cancer cells\nSplenic distension/paling should be visible.\nNote: Avoid moving the needle during injections as this may result in back flow.\nPlace a piece of wet gauze over the injection site, and slowly retract the needle while holding the wet gauze in place (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2342-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Apply wet gauze while gently removing syringe to prevent back flow\nCritical: Wet gauze is required to soak up any cancer cells during removal of the needle.\nCompress the injection site for 1 min using either firm finger pressure or instruments (e.g., cauterizer, 1 mL pipette) as weights (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2342-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Apply firm pressure for 1 min\nNote: This step is critical to allow cancer cells to enter the portal system and prevent back flow.\nDiscard the wet gauze, and remove the spleen by cautery (splenectomy) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). To do this:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2342-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Perform splenectomy by cauterizing the spleen\nHold the spleen with forceps in your left hand and the cautery in your right hand.",
    "Cauterize the splenic ligaments to remove the spleen.\nOptional: Ask an assistant to gently retract the splenic ligaments while you hold the spleen to gain better access.\nCritical: If bleeding is observed following splenectomy, place a few pieces of gauze at the site and add pressure for 3 min. Once bleeding has stopped, remove the gauze.\nOnce the spleen has been removed and no bleeding is observed, gently return the connective tissue (i.e., splenic ligaments) into the peritoneal cavity.\nSuture the peritoneum, then staple the skin layer with wound clips (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2342-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Close the incision with sutures and wound clips\nTopically administer 50 μL of 0.12% bupivacaine along the incision site using a 1 mL syringe.\nAdminister 300 μL of sterile saline via intraperitoneal injection to reduce dehydration from blood loss.\nNote: If excessive bleeding is observed, users may consider injecting more saline to improve post-surgery recovery.\nPlace the mouse in a clean cage on top of an electrical heat pad and monitor until the animal has recovered from surgery (i.e., consciousness is regained).\nCritical: Ensure that surgical tools are disinfected between mice by thoroughly wiping with 80% ethanol and F10sc veterinary disinfectant.\nAnimal recovery, monitoring, and endpoint analysis\nTiming: 15 min\nIn this step, users will monitor animals following surgery and up until the experimental endpoint.\nAfter the surgical procedure, return mice to clean cages containing sterile bedding.\nCages should be placed on top of a heat pad for 24 h.\nOptional: Provide sunflower seeds, peanut butter, and Hydrogel to aid with recovery.\nOptional: Administer an additional dose of carprofen every 24 h, for up to 72 h.",
    "Perform daily welfare checks and detailed clinical monitoring (including weighing of mice) at least twice a week. Be alert for clinical signs that indicate progression of metastatic disease, which include but are not limited to:\nWeight loss.\nWeight loss is a key indicator of disease progression and correlates with an increased tumor burden.\nPerform daily clinical monitoring if ≥10% weight loss is observed.\nNote: Weight loss of 5%–10% can be expected a day after surgery. However, this should stabilize and recover within 2 days.\nNote: In our experiments, untreated C57BL/6 wild-type mice reproducibly demonstrate ≥15% weight loss within 3 weeks of tumor injection (experimental endpoint), at which point overt liver metastases are observed (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2342-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

Each symbol represents an individual mouse. Data represent mean ± SEM; ∗∗∗p < 0.001, with statistical significance determined by an unpaired Student’s t-test for comparison between two means. Data were re-analyzed from Poh et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nJaundice.\nUsers may wish to keep the surgical area and/or abdominal region of mice shaved to improve detection of jaundice.\nReduced activity / unresponsive to surroundings.\nAbdominal edema / swelling.\nIt may be possible to detect the presence of liver metastases by gently palpating the abdomen of mice. KPC tumors are highly fibrotic and can be felt as hard nodules.\nPale eyes, ears, and feet.\nHunched posture.\nNote: Users are encouraged to develop a monitoring plan for scoring clinical signs with guidance from their Animal Ethics Committee to ensure humane intervention and/or experimental endpoints are met according to Institutional guidelines and parameters.\nNote: In addition to clinical signs, users can also monitor tumor growth via live imaging if their cancer cells express a reporter (e.g., luciferase, mCherry, GFP). Alternatively, PET/MRI imaging may also be used.",
    "Optional: Users may wish to incorporate drug treatments to this protocol. We commence treatment on the 5th day following intrasplenic tumor cell injection to allow ample time for cancer cells to establish in the liver (refer to Expected Outcomes below). However, users are advised to optimize the timing of their treatment schedules depending on their selected cancer cell line and number of cells injected.\nAt the experimental endpoint, euthanize mice by CO2 inhalation (or alternative methods approved by the investigator’s Animal Ethics Committee).\nCarefully remove the liver and rinse 3× in 1× PBS.\nWeigh the liver as a surrogate measure of tumor burden.\nProcess the liver as appropriate for downstream analysis (e.g., formalin fix, snap frozen, digestion for flow-cytometry).\nNote: For this protocol, mice reached clinical endpoint by 3 weeks following cancer cell injection.\nNote: Endpoints will vary based on the study design, including the type of cancer cell line and number of cancer cells injected. Users are advised to optimize the protocol to suit their experimental needs.\nNote: Depending on the study design, overt liver metastases may or may not be apparent at necropsy. Instead, micro-metastases may be observed via histological analysis.\nCritical: The intrasplenic injection model results in tumor growth exclusively in the liver. If tumors are observed in other organs and/or the incision site, this indicates that cancer cell leakage occurred during injection. Do not use these mice for analysis."
