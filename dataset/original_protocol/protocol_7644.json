    "Cell growth Streak strains BHY845 and BHY848 (expressing β- and γ1-actin, respectively) from frozen glycerol stocks onto YPD plates (4% glucose) and incubate at 30 °C until colonies form (4–6 d; these strains are particularly slow growing, with doubling times ~4–6 times longer than wild-type laboratory strains).Inoculate flasks containing 50 mL of YPD (4% glucose) with several colonies for each strain; grow on a shaker overnight at 30 °C.Use 25–40 mL of the cultures from step A2 to inoculate 1 L of YPD cultures; incubate on a shaker at 30 °C.Grow strains to OD595 ~1.5–2, which may take ~1.5–2 days.Harvest yeast cells by centrifugation, e.g., in 250 mL bottles using a Beckman JA12 rotor at 7,000 rpm (7,900× g) for 7 min.Decant culture medium and resuspend cells (e.g., by vortexing) in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM CaCl2; transfer to 50 mL conical tubes. Pellets typically fill 6–7 mL of space in the tube.Spin at 3,500× g for 10 min at 4 °C, decant, and then freeze pellets at -80 °C.Coupling DNase I to Sepharose 4B (DNase I-resin preparation) Swell 3 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B in ice-cold 1 mM HCl in a 50 mL conical tube; place on a rocker or rotator to disperse persistent clumps.Collect activated beads via centrifugation at ~2,000× g for 2 min; wash twice with 1 mM HCl and bring volume to 50 mL with each wash.Resuspend 100 mg of DNase I in coupling buffer at 5 mg/mL final concentration; save a small aliquot (~100 μL) of DNase I suspension for later calculation of coupling efficiency and add the remainder to the resin. Incubate coupling reaction overnight at 4 °C on a rocker or rotator.",
    "Allow the resin to settle on ice or collect via centrifugation at ~2,000× g for 2 min; remove and save the supernatant for calculation of coupling efficiency.Add 25 mL of cold 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0 to block unreacted sites on beads. Rock at 4 °C for 2 h.Collect resin via centrifugation at ~2,000× g for 2 min. Wash resin, alternating between 25 mL of each of the following solutions thrice:Low pH wash buffer.High pH wash buffer.Wash resin twice with 25 mL of DNase I storage buffer; resuspend in DNase I storage buffer and store at 4 °C.Determine coupling efficiency by comparing DNase I concentration of the pre- (step B3) and post-coupling (step B7) solutions; this can be done with standard protein determination reagents [e.g., Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, Bradford reagent, Lowry reagent, or direct A280 measurement (A280 of 1 = 0.5 mg/mL DNase I)]. Coupling efficiency should be ~ 95%–98%.Column packing: 2 × 3 mL columns The DNase I-Sepharose resin will be packed into two Pierce polypropylene columns, assembled from two 5 mL polypropylene columns, two filter discs, two column end caps, and two column top funnels.Using an upside-down 1 mL pipette tip, push one filter disc to the bottom of each column and pass 5 mL of ddH2O through each.Attach the funnel/reservoir to the top of the column: use parafilm to seal potential leak points between the funnel neck and the column (Figure 1A and 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4894/bioprotoc-13-23-4894-g001.jpgFigure 1. Diagram of disposable column assembly. (A) Schematic and (B) photo depicting column apparatus. See Protocol section D for details.Cap the columns, add 3 mL of water, and note the top water level on the column using a marker. Uncap the column and remove the water via gravity flow.",
    "Gradually add the resin to the columns, allowing it to slowly settle via gravity as the column flows. Add enough resin to reach the 3 mL mark.Rinse columns and reservoirs with DNase I storage buffer to settle remaining resin via gravity flow.Wash the column with 3–5 column volumes (CV) of DNase I storage buffer; then, cap the column (e.g., by covering with parafilm) and store at 4 °C until use (Section D).Columns are generally reusable for several (3–5) purifications. Following each purification, the column should be washed with at least five CV of G-buffer, then washed (3–5 CV) and stored in DNase I storage buffer.Actin purification [modified from Goode (2002) and Aggeli et al. (2014)] Thaw cell pellet obtained from 1 L media in ~15 mL of lysis buffer.Lyse the cells by passing through French press 2× at press setting of 1,000 psi (16,000 actual psi in a pressure cell with 1-inch diameter piston).Spin lysate at ~17,000–20,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C (e.g., in a Beckman JA20 rotor at 12 krpm).Spin the supernatant of the previous step in a Beckman Ti70 rotor at 50,000 rpm (256,600× g) for 50 min at 4 °C.Wash each 3 mL of DNase I-Sepharose column with 15 mL (five CV) of G-buffer supplemented with 0.2 M NH4Cl followed by 15 mL of G-buffer supplemented with 0.1 mM PMSF.Filter the clarified supernatant through 0.45 μm syringe filters (Figure 2A, Lanes 1 and 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4894/bioprotoc-13-23-4894-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Relative amounts post 50% formamide elution, as follows: Lanes 7 and 8: 1/900 of total eluates; Lanes 9 and 10: 1/100 of post-dialysis concentrated samples; Lanes 11 and 12: 1/10 of G-actin pellets (after suspension in gel loading buffer); Lanes 13 and 14: 1/75 of KCl-treated F-actin supernatants; Lanes 17 and 18: 1/10 of G-actin pellets (after suspension in gel loading buffer); Lanes 19 and 20: 1/200 of final actin preparations. Abbreviations: MW, molecular weight markers; HSS, high speed supernatant; Sup, supernatant; F-actin, filamentous actin; G-actin, globular (monomeric) actin.Load supernatants on DNase I columns and allow to drip through (Figure 2A, Lanes 3 and 4).Note: The “depleted” flowthrough can be collected and analyzed by western blotting to determine the degree of binding and whether actin has saturated the DNase I resin. Wash each column with:15 mL (i.e., five CV) of actin wash buffer 1 (Figure 2A, Lanes 5 and 6).15 mL of actin wash buffer 2.15 mL of G-buffer.Elute actin from each column with actin elution buffer (formamide disrupts the actin–DNase I interaction, likely denaturing one or both proteins); for 3 mL of resin, add 2 mL (<1 CV) of actin elution buffer to the column and discard the resulting flowthrough, then add another 4 mL and collect the flowthrough, dripping into a tube containing 2 mL of G-buffer (this helps to immediately reduce the formamide concentration and overall actin denaturation) (Figure 2A, Lanes 7 and 8).Dialyze overnight against 2 L of G-buffer at 4 °C in Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (10,000 MWCO) or dialysis tubing (12,000–14,000 MWCO); this step reduces the formamide concentration to ~0.1% and introduces fresh G-buffer into the actin solution.Concentrate the dialyzed actin solution to ~ 0.5–1.",
    "5 mL using centrifugation-based protein concentrators (Figure 2A, Lanes 9 and 10); we have successfully used Vivaspin 5000 MWCO and Amicon Ultra 10,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrators for this step.Distribute to 1 mL ultracentrifuge tubes and clarify actin at 213,000× g (70,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C. This step removes aggregated actin (Figure 1B, Lanes 11 and 12).Note: Larger volumes can be accommodated here and at subsequent steps using the higher capacity TLA100.3 rotor and associated tubes. Distribute a maximum of 760 μL of the G-actin supernatant per tube to new 1 mL ultracentrifuge tubes.Add 20× F-buffer to 1× final concentration per 1 mL ultracentrifuge tube (i.e., 40 μL of F-buffer to the 760 μL of G-actin already in the tube from step D13). Incubate tubes at room temperature for 20 min to polymerize F-actin.Add KCl to 600 mM final (i.e., 200 μL of 3 M KCl stock to 800 μL mixture in step D14). Incubate at room temperature for 1 h. This step promotes the dissociation of potential host cofilin contaminants.Collect F-actin via centrifugation at 213,000× g for 30 min at 20 °C. Remove and discard the supernatant (Figure 2B, lanes 13 and 14).Rinse the F-actin pellets with ~200 μL of G-buffer (Figure 2B, Lanes 15 and16) and then resuspend in ~500 μL of G-buffer. Depolymerize actin filaments on ice overnight or for at least 3 h. Mechanically sheering actin filaments with a P200 pipette or by dounce homogenization will further expedite depolymerization.Remove depolymerization-incompetent actin and actin aggregates via centrifugation at 213,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C (Figure 2B, lanes 17 and 18).Transfer supernatants (G-actin) to new 1 mL ultracentrifuge tubes. Determine concentration and yield (e.g., using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and comparing to known quantities of BSA).",
    "Run 200–300 ng of actin on a 10%–15% polyacrylamide gel to assess purity (Figure 2B, Lanes 19 and 20).To further enhance the purity of actin, perform 2–3 additional polymerization/depolymerization “cycles” (concentration permitting). To cycle actin, add 20× F-buffer to 1× final concentration, incubate for 20 min at room temperature, then repeat steps D16–D19 as above. Running small aliquots of the supernatants and resuspended pellets on SDS-PAGE gels can be used to track the final purity and/or loss of actin with each polymerization cycle. The amount of G-buffer to add when repeating step D17 will depend on yield and desired final concentration (e.g., suspending 500 μg of actin in 500 μL of G-buffer results in a 24 μM actin solution).Store actin monomers in one of two ways:For long-term storage, distribute G-actin into small (20–50 μL) aliquots, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C.For short-term storage (1–2 weeks), add 20× F-buffer (i.e., 5 μL of 20× F-buffer per 95 μL of G-actin) and store polymerized F-actin at 4 °C.When ready to use:Thaw aliquot and clarify monomers via centrifugation at 213,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove aggregates.Spin F-actin at 213,000× g for 30 min at 20 °C, resuspend actin pellet in fresh G-buffer, and incubate on ice to depolymerize (see step D17)."
