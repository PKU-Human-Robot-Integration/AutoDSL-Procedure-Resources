    "Sample preparationPrepare sylgard plate per manufacturer’s instruction. Once the sylgard plate is made, it can be used indefinitely.Dissect E14.5-E18.5 embryos from the uterus and remove extra embryonic membranes in ice-cold 1× PBS with forceps.Open the abdomen of the embryos and fix them in 1% PFA in a 12-well (E14.5 to E16.5) or 6-well (E17.5 to E18.5) plate overnight at 4°C.Wash embryos three times with 1× PBS on ice, 30 min each time (Figure 1A).Make incisions with spring scissors from the ears to just under the forelimbs (Figure 1B).Remove the skin carefully with forceps and try to take as little underlying tissue as possible (Figure 1C).Pin the skin on the sylgard plate and remove the connective tissue (arrows) with forceps (Figures 1D-1G).Remove the skin from sylgard plate and place in a 24-well plate for whole-mount immunostaining.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4186/bioprotoc-11-20-4186-g001.jpgFigure 1. Dermal skin preparation. A. E16.5 embryo fixed in PFA and ready for dorsal skin dissection. B. Incisions on the dorsal skin outlining the region that will be dissected out. C. Embryo after the removal of the dorsal skin. Notice that the underlying tissue was not significantly damaged by dissection. Subsequent cleaning steps are minimized when the skin is dissected out with the least amount of attached tissues. D. The skin sample was pinned onto the sylgard plate with the inside facing up. The arrows point to the collagen fibers that are attached to the skin. E-G. The same skin sample from which the connective tissue (arrows) is removed by peeling without damaging the underlying skin. The arrow in G indicates the connective tissue that can be discarded.Whole-mount immunohistochemistryWash the samples twice with 1 ml PBST, 30 min each time.Incubate samples in 1 ml PBST with 20% DMSO for 4 h.Incubate samples in 1 ml PTTDND overnight.",
    "Wash samples twice with 1 ml PBST, 30 min each time.Incubate samples in 1 ml 1 PTDG for 4 h.Block in 300 µl blocking buffer overnight.Wash twice with 1 ml PTWH, 30 min each time.Incubate with primary antibodies in 300 µl PTWH with 5% DMSO and 3% donkey serum overnight.Wash four times with 1 ml PTWH, 30 min each time.Incubate with secondary antibodies in 300 µl PTWH with 3% donkey serum overnight.Wash four times with 1 ml PTWH, 30 min each time.Wash twice with 1 ml 1× PBS, 10 min each time.Draw squares on the microscope slides with wax pen (Figures 2A and 2B).Add sufficient mounting media to the middle of the square (Figure 2B) and place the skin in the mounting media (Figure 2C). Let the inner side of the skin face up and position the anterior end (ears) of the dorsal skin towards the anterior end of the slide.Remove ears from the skin with spring scissors (Figure 2D).Overlay the sample with cover glass and gently press the skin by using the back of a forceps to smoothen out the wrinkles (Figure 2E).Seal the edges of the slides with nail polish and image under a fluorescent microscope (Figures 2F and 2G).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4186/bioprotoc-11-20-4186-g002.jpgFigure 2. Imaging the dermal skin. A. The dashed line on the slide indicates the approximate location of the chambers that will be made by outlining with the wax pen. B. After the outline is made with the wax pen, a drop of mounting media is placed in the middle of the chamber. C. Immunostained dorsal skin immersed in the mounting media with the inside of the skin facing up. D. Sample with ears carefully removed. E. Sample overlaid with a cover slip and gently pressed to remove air bubbles and wrinkles. F-G.",
