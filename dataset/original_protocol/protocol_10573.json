    "The procedure for acquiring echocardiographic images and analyzing them to obtain the PDF parameters is detailed below. Although cardiac catheterization is mentioned in the subject selection portion below, the methodology described applies only to the echocardiographic portion. The description of the catheterization portion was included for independent validation of model based predictions and is unrelated to the analysis of E-waves via the PDF formalism. Prior to data acquisition, all subjects provide signed, informed consent for participation in the study in accordance with the Institutional Review Board (Human Research Protection Office) at Washington University School of Medicine.\nNOTE: All software programs (along with tutorials on how to use them) described in this section can be downloaded from http://cbl1.wustl.edu/SoftwareAgreement.htm[href=http://cbl1.wustl.edu/SoftwareAgreement.htm]\n1. Subject Selection\nNOTE: All subjects in the Cardiovascular Biophysics Laboratory Database had simultaneous echocardiography and cardiac catheterization performed and were referred by their physicians for diagnostic cardiac catheterization. The database inclusion criteria are: 1) absence of any significant valvular abnormalities, 2) absence of wall motion abnormalities or bundle branch block on ECG, 3) presence of a satisfactory echocardiographic window with clearly identifiable E- and A-waves.\n2. Echocardiographic Data Acquisition\nRecord a complete 2D/echo-Doppler study for all subjects in accordance with American Society of Echocardiography criteria16. NOTE: The screening echocardiograms were recorded on a standard clinical imager by a sonographer. If desired, additional transthoracic echocardiographic recording can be performed for verification purposes after a suitable, high fidelity catheter is advanced into the LV to measure LV hemodynamics simultaneously.",
    "Image subjects in the supine position. In a nonresearch setting, standard left lateral positioning can be used without loss of generality of the method. Obtain apical four-chamber views using a 2.5 MHz transducer, with the sample volume gated at 1.5-5 mm directed between the tips of the mitral valve leaflets and orthogonal to the MV plane (to minimize alignment effects as seen on color M-mode Doppler), the wall filter set at 1 (125 Hz) or 2 (250 Hz), the baseline adjusted to take advantage of the full height of the display and the velocity scale adjusted to exploit the dynamic range of the output without aliasing.\nPerform Doppler tissue imaging with the sample volume gated at 2.5 mm and positioned at the lateral and septal potions of the mitral annulus.\nSave Doppler examinations in DICOM format in the echo machine and record on DVD with simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (ECG).\n3. Doppler Image Processing and Conventional Analysis\nNOTE: This section describes two custom MATLAB programs. The first program is described in step 3.1 and the second program is described in steps 3.2-3.5. All software programs (along with tutorials on how to use them) can be downloaded from http://cbl1.wustl.edu/SoftwareAgreement.htm[href=http://cbl1.wustl.edu/SoftwareAgreement.htm]\nConvert images from the DICOM format and video to bitmap (.bmp) files (using a custom MATLAB program). NOTE: The procedure described below to fit Doppler E-waves and tissue Doppler E’-waves is shown in Figure 1.\nLoad the bitmap image files on another custom MATLAB program to measure conventional transmitral flow parameters such as Epeak, Apeak, Edur, E’peak, A’peak, etc. and crop the images for PDF analysis. Select images with discernible transmitral flow contour and complete cardiac cycle as indicated by ECG for analysis.",
    "Mark the time sampling rate (measured in pixels/s on the horizontal axis) and velocity sampling rate (measured in pixels/(m/sec) along the vertical axis) in the images. Identify the complete cardiac cycle by noting and marking consecutive R peaks (or any distinct feature of the ECG) on the image.\nMark the transmitral Doppler E- and A-wave or tissue Doppler E’- and A’- wave in the selected cardiac cycle.\n\t\nSelect the Doppler E-wave peak point i.e. Epeak, (or E’peak) and mark the start of the wave using the line connecting the peak to the start as a guide to match the acceleration slope of the E-wave (or E’-wave). The start of the wave is used to calculate the interval from start to peak flow denoted as the E-wave (or E’-wave) acceleration time (AT).\nMark the end of the E-wave (or E’-wave) using the line connecting the peak to the end as a guide to match the deceleration slope. This is used to calculate the interval from the peak to the baseline denoted as the deceleration time (DT). The interval from start to end of the wave is the duration of the E-wave (Edur = AT+DT). The program guides the user through the entire process with appropriate instructions.\nMark the A-wave using a similar procedure as the E-wave. With both the E- and A-waves marked the program calculates the Epeak/Apeak ratio.\n\tNOTE: The program saves the marked waves as cropped images containing the E- and A-waves only. The program also creates a data file with the cropping and measured parameters for each beat.\n4. Automated Fitting of Transmitral Flow Using the PDF Formalism\nThe automated fitting of Doppler E- and A-wave and tissue Doppler E’- and A’- wave contours is done using a custom LabView program18,19.",
    "Load the cropped image, and the program automatically calculates the maximum velocity envelope (MVE). Select the MVE by setting the threshold such that MVE approximates transmitral flow as shown in Figure 1. The onset and termination of the points that define the MVE can be selected along the time-axis by the operator such that only MVE points that provide good correspondence to the actual selected portion of the wave are used as input for the subsequent fitting.\nNOTE: The user-selected MVE points are the input to the computer program that automatically fits the PDF model solution for velocity as a function of time using a Levenberg- Marquardt (iterative) algorithm. The fitting is accomplished with the requirement that the mean square error between the clinical (input) data (MVE) and the PDF model predicted contour be minimized. Since the model is linear, a unique set of parameters is obtained for each Doppler E-wave derived MVE used as input. Thus numerically unique k, c, and xo values are generated for each E-wave and k’, c’, and xo’ for each E’-wave.\nIn the event the fit is obviously suboptimal when the fit is superimposed on the E-wave (or E’-wave) image (i.e. the algorithm attempted to fit noise included in the MVE for example) modify the MVE by using more/less points, thereby modifying the model predicted contour with consequent modification of PDF parameters to achieve a better fit.\nSave the data when the appropriate PDF fit has been generated. NOTE: The program is written to automatically save the data in image and text files containing the PDF parameters and the contour information.",
