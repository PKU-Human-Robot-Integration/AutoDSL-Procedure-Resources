    "Insert the genetic cassette into the chromosomal location for which recombination rates should be determinedNote: This step is specific for each location at which recombination rates will be measured. The details of the procedure will also vary depending on the Lambda-red recombination system that is used. For detailed instructions on Lambda-red recombineering see Yu et al., 2000. The following steps are a summary for pSIM6-based recombineering.Amplify the cat-sacB-yfp cassette by PCR and purify the product.Note: Primer design and amplification conditions are specific for the used selectable/counter-selectable cassette and insertion location and therefore not further described in this protocol. Start an overnight culture: Inoculate 2 ml sterile LB containing 100 mg/L ampicillin in a 15 ml test tube with cells from a single colony.Incubate in an incubator at 30 °C, shaking at 200 rpm for ~20 h.Mix 50 ml salt-free LB containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and 0.2% glucose with 500 µl o/n culture in a 250 ml E-flask.Incubate in an incubator at 30 °C, shaking at 200 rpm for ~2 h.To induce red expression, move the flask to a 43 °C shaking water bath for 15 min.Cool in an ice-water bath for at least 10 min. Swirl carefully to cool cells.Transfer the culture to a cold 50 ml plastic tube and pellet the cells (3,500 x g, 8 min, 4 °C).Remove as much as possible of the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 20 ml ice-cold sterile water. Do not vortex! Pellet the cells at 3,500 x g, 8 min, 4 °C.Resuspend the cells in 1 ml ice-cold water and transfer into a cold Eppendorf tube. Pellet the cells at 16,000 x g, 3 min, 4 °C and remove as much as possible of the supernatant.Resupend cells in 100 µl ice-cold water.",
    "Mix 50 µl cells with 5 µl purified PCR product, incubate on ice for 5 min and transfer into a cold electroporation cuvette. Electroporate (1.8 kV, 200 Ω, 25 µF). Immediately, resuspend the cells in 1 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) LB and transfer back into the Eppendorf tube.Let the cells recover for at least 3 h or overnight at 37 °C. Plate 100 µl recovered culture on an LA plate containing 25 mg/L chloramphenicol, incubate the plate o/n at 37 °C.Restreak colonies on LA plates containing 25 mg/L chloramphenicol, incubate the plates o/n at 37 °C.Confirm the correct insertion by PCR size verification and test the phenotype of the recombinant cells (YFP fluorescence and sensitivity to growth on salt-free LA plates containing 5% sucrose).Determine the number of colony-forming units per ml of overnight culturesStart three independent overnight cultures for each strain to be measured: Inoculate 2 ml sterile LB in a 15 ml test tube with cells from a single colony.Incubate in an incubator at 37 °C, shaking at 200 rpm for ~20 h.Make a 10-fold dilution series in a sterile 0.9% NaCl solution to a dilution factor of 10-7.Plate 100 µl of dilutions 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7 on LA plates. Note: Under these incubation conditions Salmonella cultures usually grow to density of approximately 4 x 109 cfu/ml. Change the plated dilution factors for strains or conditions that form cultures with a different density. Incubate the LA plates in an incubator at 37 °C for ~20 h.Count the colonies per plate. Choose a dilution with 30-500 colonies per plate to calculate the original culture density according to formula 1 (see Data analysis). Determine the volume of overnight culture to be plated for assayNote: Steps B1-B3 are identical to “Procedure A” and the same dilutions can be used for both parts.",
    "Start three independent overnight cultures for each strain to be measured: Inoculate 2 ml sterile LB in a 15 ml test tube with cells from a single colony.Incubate in an incubator at 37 °C, shaking at 200 rpm for ~20 h.Make a 10-fold dilution series in a sterile 0.9% NaCl solution to a dilution factor of 10-5.Plate 100 µl of each dilution (100 to 10-5) on salt-free LA plates containing 5% sucrose.Incubate in an incubator at 37 °C for ~20 h.Assess colonies under UV light for fluorescence. Re-streak non-fluorescent colonies onto salt-free LA plates containing 5% sucrose. Note: Use UV light with a wavelength that does not cause DNA damage (e.g., 365 nm), re-streak two colonies per colony morphology (different colony shapes or sizes) if more than 5 colonies are non-fluorescent. Incubate in an incubator at 37 °C for ~20 h.Confirm recombinational removal of the cat-sacB-yfp cassette by PCR size verification followed by sequencing of the insertion site.Estimate the dilution factor where approximately half of the cultures would yield a colony with recombinational removal of the cat-sacB-yfp cassette. Note: The estimated dilution does not need to be part of the 10-fold dilution series but can be any dilution. Measure recombination rateStart twenty independent overnight cultures for each strain to be measured: Inoculate 2 ml sterile LB in a 15 ml test tube with cells from a single colony.Incubate in an incubator at 37 °C, shaking at 200 rpm for ~20 h.Make appropriate dilutions, as determined in “Procedure B”, in a sterile 0.9% NaCl solution.Plate 100 µl of each dilution on salt-free LA plates containing 5% sucrose.Incubate in an incubator at 37 °C for ~20 h.Assess colonies under UV light for fluorescence. Re-streak non-fluorescent colonies onto salt-free LA plates containing 5% sucrose.",
