Biomarker Study Based on Microarrays\nDay 0 to day 5:\n\t\nEmbryoid body formation and transfer to 10 cm bacteriological plates — follow the steps mentioned in point 2 for embryoid body formation.\n\t\tNote: Use three biological replicates for each study. Divide each biological replicate in to two parts — Drug treatment at IC10 concentration and vehicle control. Prepare drug concentration 10,000 fold above the IC10 concentration in vehicle and from this add 10 µl to 100 ml RD medium with H9 cell clumps in 50 ml Eppendorf tube mix well and seed it on V bottom plates. Follow the same procedure for vehicle control group.\nFor drug exposure on Day 5 to 14, collect the EB´s and transfer them in 10 cm bacteriological plates on day 4 as per the steps mentioned in point 2. Transfer the plates on horizontal shaker (reciprocation motion 50/min) in cell culture incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) for 14 days. Give medium change every alternate day.",
    "For sample collection, on day 14, collect the EBs from 10 cm plates in to 15 ml falcon tube with sterile serological pipette. Allow EBs to settle for 2 min. Aspirate the supernatant and wash the EBs with 5 ml PBS. Allow EBs to settle for 2 min and aspirate the supernatant. Re-suspend EBs in 1 ml RNAlater solution or TRIzol reagent, vortex and store the sample at -80 °C till further processing.\n\tNote: Perform all procedure in biosafety cabinet as per good laboratory practices. Rotate the plates in circular motion around the center to bring all EBs in center, aspirate the medium from surrounding with the help of sterile glass pasture pipette, add 15 ml RD medium and then add 15 µl of drug / vehicle for respective group.\n5. RNA Isolation and Integrity Testing\nRNA Isolation:\n\tMost of the steps mentioned below are to be performed for RNA purification using RNeasy Mini Kit as per the instruction manual. Always use nuclease free tubes, pipette tips and water. While working with TRIzol carry out all procedure in chemical safety hood and wear protective glasses as well as chemical protective gloves.\n\t\nThaw the samples on ice. If samples are stored in RNAlater solution, centrifuge the tubes at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and add 1 ml TRIzol reagent.\nTriturate the samples using 24 G needle and 1 ml syringe. Approximately 15 times trituration is sufficient for disruption of EBs, cell wall and plasma membranes.\nAdd 200 µl of chloroform in each sample. Vortex to mix the contents uniformly. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove the RNeasy mini spin columns, 1.5 ml tubes and label them properly.",
    "Collect the supernatant in 1.5 ml tubes (While collecting supernatant do not disturb the middle or bottom layer). Add equal volume of chilled 70% ethanol. Mix the contents by gentle shaking.\nApply 700 µl from the tubes to respective mini spin columns and centrifuge them at 12,000 x g for 20 sec at RT. Perform all further steps at RT.\nDiscard the filtrate and apply remaining solution to the respective columns and centrifuge them at 12,000 x g for 20 sec. Discard the filtrate.\nApply 350 µl of RW1 buffer to the column and centrifuge them at 12,000 x g for 20 sec. Discard the filtrate and apply 10 µl of DNAse and 70 µl RDD buffer to the column.\nIncubate at RT for 15 min. Apply 350 µl of RW1 buffer to the column and centrifuge them at 12,000 x g for 20 sec.

Quantify RNA using automated electrophoresis system.\nRNA concentration, purity and integrity testing.\n\tFor RNA purity and integrity testing use automated electrophoresis system and respective kit33.\n6. Microarray Studies",
    "Perform transcriptional profiling using commercial available Human array chips. For RNA target preparation, fragmentation, hybridization34 and array chip staining, washing35 use commercial available kits.\nPerform array chip scanning and quality control check by using standard fluidics station, array scanners and standard operating softwares36. For gene expression analysis import the files generated from scanners to the standard commercial available software37, perform background correction, summarization and normalization with Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA).\nFor obtaining list of differentially expressed genes (DEG's) perform one way ANOVA analysis. From this list filter out the genes based on the fold change (± 2) and FDR-controlled p-value (< 0.05). Obtain the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Heat Map, etc. using this software.\nPart 2. UKN 1 Test System\n1. Maintenance of hESC\nSeeding of MEFs\n\t\nFor the differentiation use the NSCB#8534 (H9) cell line. Culture cells on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as feeder cells. Coat T25 flask with 4 ml of 0.1% gelatin and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nThaw MEFs in 37 °C water bath and transfer the cells into pre-warmed DMEM/10%FBS.\nSpin 3.5 min with 500 x g, remove supernatant and re-suspend cells to obtain 1 x 107 cells/ml. Plate MEFs 4 x 104/cm2 in T25 flasks on gelatin. Optionally, use the MEFs for the next two days. Quality of MEF batches are a very critical issue for hESC maintenance. Therefore it is advisable to elucidate the best company and preparation method for the H9 cells. We use PMEF P3.\nSplitting and maintenance of H9\n\t\nAdd 1 ml pre-warmed dispase per T25 flask H9 and incubate 9 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 2 ml wash medium to dispase treated cells and pipet 5 times up and down with 5 ml pipet and transfer cell solution to a falcon tube.",
    "Wash the flask with 9 ml wash medium and add cells to the others. Spin 3.5 min with 500 x g, remove supernatant and re-suspend cells in 10 ml hESC medium.\nSpin 3.5 min with 500 x g, remove supernatant and re-suspend cells in 4 ml hESC medium. Add 0.5 ml cell suspension and 4.5 ml hESC medium and plate in a new (PBS washed) T25 flask with MEFs. Change entire hESC medium (5 ml) of the flask every day.\n2. Differentiation of hESC towards Neuroectodermal Progenitor Cells (NEP)\nPrepare hESC medium and KCM medium. Coat one 10 cm dish with gelatine (0.1% in PBS) per T25 flask and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Remove medium from hESC and add enough accutase to cover the whole bottom of the flask (1 ml per T25 flask) and incubate 25 to 30 min at 37 °C.\nPrepare basement membrane matrix coated plates during accutase incubation. Add cold DMEM/F12 to frozen basement membrane matrix pellet and resolve it 1:20. Filter basement membrane matrix solution through a 40 µm cell strainer. Add filtered solution to plate, the whole bottom has to be covered (1 ml per 6-well is required) and incubate for 2 hr at RT.\nAfter incubation period remove the basement membrane matrix supernatant and seed cells on the coated wells. After accutase step (2.1) stop reaction by addition of 1.5 ml HES medium. Scrape cells from the flask, add 8 ml hESC medium and produce a single cell solution by pipetting with 10 ml pipet thoroughly. Filter cells through a 40 µm cell strainer.",
    "Spin cells 3 min with 500 x g, remove supernatant and re-suspend cells in 10 ml of hESC. Spin cells again 3 min with 500 x g, remove supernatant and re-suspend cells in hESC containing ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 at a final concentration of 10 µM.\nRemove supernatant of gelatin coated dish. Plate cell suspension on gelatin coated dish to remove the MEFs and leave in the incubator for exactly 1 hr.\n\tNOTE: During this step the MEFs will settle onto the gelatine coated plate, whereas the hESC cannot attach to gelatin. Therefore this is crucial to obtain a feeder-free differentiation. It is a critical step as too long incubation results in hESC clumps and too short incubation in inefficient removal of MEFs. After 45 min of incubation the plate should be investigated for already settled MEFs and hESC clumps.\nWhen the MEFs have attached, gently wash non-adherent cells (hESC) off after incubation with the medium already in the plate. If several T25 were used to get more cells, single cells now can be combined. Wash plate once with hESC medium.\nSpin cells 3 min with 500 x g, remove supernatant and re-suspend cells in approximately 4 ml KCM containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and 10 ng/ml FGF-2.\nCount cells in a hemocytometer using Trypan blue. Plate 18 x 103 cells/cm2 on basement membrane matrix coated plates in KCM containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (for 6 well use 1.5 ml per well). It is crucial to plate the cells in the right density to differentiate them successfully into NEPs.\nAfter 24 hr, change medium to fresh KCM containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and 10 ng/ml FGF-2. After further 24 hr, change medium to fresh KCM containing 10 ng/ml FGF2.",
    "72 hr after seeding the cells, differentiation starts by medium change towards KSR medium. This time point is referred to as day of differentiation 0 (DoD0). The addition of test substances is possible now.\nOn DoD1 and DoD2 the medium is changed exactly as on DoD0. Next medium change is at DoD4 containing 25% N2-S and 75% KSR. At DoD6 the differentiation is stopped and cells are harvested for analysis.\n3. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of hESC and NEP\nPreparation of nuclei\n\t\nAdd 500 µl accutase to each 6 well which should be analyzed and incubate for 25 to 30 min. Count cells in a Neubauer chamber using Trypan blue.\nResuspend cells in 1% formaldehyde in DMEM/F12 for crosslink. Add Tris pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 125 mM after 10 min to stop the crosslink.\nSpin cells 3 min with 500 x g at 4 °C, remove supernatant and re-suspend cells in cold PBS.\nSpin cells 3 min with 500 x g at 4 °C, remove supernatant and re-suspend cells in 1 ml L1- buffer / 1 x 106 cells.\nIncubate for 5 min on ice. Spin 5 min with 800 x g at 4 °C, remove supernatant and re-suspend nuclei in 1 ml L2- buffer / 2 x 106 cells.\nSonication and quality control\n\t\nSonicate so that DNA fragments of 300–700 bp length are generated. Spin 1 min with 10,000 x g at 4°C. Transfer supernatant to a new tube. The fragments need to have the correct size, otherwise the immunoprecipitation will be inefficient as well as the followed qPCR.\nRemove 50 µl and mix with 50 µl L2 buffer to check efficiency of sonication by running an agarose gel.",
    "Reverse crosslink by incubation at 65 °C for 4 hr and 500 rpm. Load samples 1:5 with Orange G loading dye on a 1.5% agarose gel and run 45 min at 110 V in 1x TBE buffer. Control fragment size (should be between 300–700 bp).\nChromatin Immunoprecipitation\n\t\nDilute samples 1:5 in dilution buffer and aliquot 1 ml per IP in siliconized tubes.\nRemove 5% (volume) from diluted chromatin sample (step 3.3.1) and store at 4 °C as “input”.\nIncubate samples with antibodies of your choice and with unspecific IgG O/N at 4 °C on a rotator.\nAdd 50 µl Protein-A/G Sepharose beads to each sample after immunoprecipitation. Incubate samples 3 hr at 4 °C on a rotator. Spin 1 min with 1,500 x g at 4 °C and remove supernatant.\nWash with 1 ml washing beads. Spin 1 min with 1,500 x g at 4 °C and remove supernatant. Repeat step g to h. Wash with 1 ml final washing buffer. During the washing steps you should not lose any of the beads, because this alters the amount of eluate directly.\nCentrifuge 1 min with 1,500 x g at 4 °C and remove supernatant. Add 125 µl elution buffer and incubate 15 min with 65 °C at 1,000 rpm on a shaker.\nSpin 1 min with 1,500 x g and transfer supernatant to a new tube Repeat step k and l. Add 200 µl elution buffer to input (3.3.2). Add Proteinase K and RNase to each sample and incubate 30 min with 37 °C at 500 rpm on a shaker and afterwards 4 hr with 65 °C at 500 rpm on a shaker.\n\t\tNOTE: For DNA extraction use commercial available ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit38.\nSubscription Required.
