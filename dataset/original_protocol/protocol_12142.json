    "8 to 12 week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Shanghai Experimental Animal Center (Shanghai, China) and raised in a specific pathogen-free and air-conditioned animal facility. Animal care and experimental procedures were in compliance with the guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals established by Shantou University.\n1. Assembly of the Apparatus\nTo ensure sterility, turn on the UV light of a tissue culture hood for 30 min before use.\nUnscrew a disposable 25 mm filter unit and submerge the cap and bottom of the unit into a 200 mL glass cup filled with 75% ethanol for 30 min. The unit is made of medical-grade polypropylene.\nPick up the cap and bottom of the unit using forceps, shake off the remaining ethanol by hand, and allow the parts to air dry for 10 min in the hood.\nWet a 19 mm polycarbonate membrane in PBS and place it carefully on top of the supporting matrix of the bottom of the unit. The polymer film has a smooth, flat surface and track-etched 3 µm pores.\nReassemble the unit by screwing the cap tightly against the bottom. Make sure that the membrane is not dislodged from the center.\nRemove the needle of a 1 mL insulin syringe and draw 1 mL of PBS. Attach the syringe to the filter unit and then push PBS through the unit to wet the assembly and to test if there is any leakage.\n2. Generation of Plasma Membrane Vesicles (PMVs)\nEstablish a BMSC culture, as reported by Nemeth et al.15, in DMEM culture medium containing 15% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cultivate the cells in a 6-well plate in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nTo propagate the cells, remove the culture medium and rinse the well with 0.5 mL of calcium-free PBS.",
    "Add 0.5 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 3 min. Tap the plate against the palm of the hand a couple times to facilitate cell detachment. Stop digestion by adding 1 mL of culture medium.\nCollect the cells in a 15 mL conical tube and spin at 200 x g for 2 min in a bench top centrifuge. Resuspend the cells in 4 mL of culture medium and aliquot the cells into two wells of a 6-well plate.\n\tNOTE: Cells usually reach confluence at around 24 h.\nTo generate PMVs, harvest the cells from one well (about 5 x 105 cells) of a 6-well plate by trypsin digestion and monodisperse the cells in 0.5 mL of culture medium.\nLoad the cells into the insulin syringe, attach it to the filter unit, and push the plunger quickly to squeeze the cells through the filter. Discard the extruded medium because there should only be a few PMVs inside it.\nLoad an additional 0.5 mL of medium into the syringe and quickly push it through the filter. Collected the medium of the second extrusion, which contains PMVs of various size.\nLoad 150 µL of the collected medium into a 35-mm glass-bottom dish and allow the PMVs to settle to the bottom for about 10 min. Examine the PMVs under an inverted phase contrast microscope equipped with a CCD camera using the 20X objective lens.\n3. Examination of the Content within the PMVs Using Confocal Microscopy\nTo perform transfection in the BMSCs, dilute 2 µg of supercoiled plasmid DNA and 6 µL of cationic transfection reagent (e.g., PolyJet) in 50 µL of serum-free DMEM. Vortex to mix well and spin briefly to collect all liquid from the sides of the tube.",
    "Add the diluted solution (from step 3.1) dropwise into diluted DNA solution, vortex strongly for 1 min, spin briefly, and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nReplace the old medium on the BMSCs, which have been seeded at about 30% confluence overnight, with 2 mL of fresh culture medium and add DNA transfection mixture dropwise.\nReplace with 2 mL of fresh medium after 12 h of transfection.\nTo trace cytoplasmically localized proteins, transfect the cells with the plasmid containing an EGFP expression cassette (pEGFP-N1), as described above. Harvest the cells by trypsin digestion 48 h after transfection for PMV generation, as described above.\nTo trace the mitochondria, stain the cells with mitochondrial dye (1 µM, MitoTracker) in fresh culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C.\nTo detect the membrane potential of the mitochondria, stain the cells with the cyanine dye JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimi-dazolylcarbocyanine iodide) (10 µg/mL) in fresh culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C.\nWash the cells with 0.5 mL of PBS three times and then harvest the cells by trypsin digestion for PMV generation, as described above.\nLoad 150 µL of the collected medium into a 35-mm glass-bottom dish and allow the PMVs to settle to the bottom for about 10 min. Examine the PMVs under a confocal microscope using the 100X oil objective lens.\nTo detect EGFP or the mitochondrial dye, turn on the 488-nm laser and collect signal at 505-530 nm. To detect JC-1, turn on the 488-nm and 543-nm lasers and collect signals at 505-530 nm and 560-615 nm. Set the pinhole value to around 1.4.\n4. Preparation of Concentrated PMVs by Centrifugation\nHarvest the cells by trypsin digestion and generate PMVs, as described above, in 0.5 mL of culture medium.",
    "Spin the PMVs at 1,200 x g in a benchtop centrifuge for 5 min at room temperature. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of culture medium with gentle swirling.\nLoad 50 µL of PMVs into a 35 mm glass-bottom dish and allow them to settle at room temperature for about 10 min. Examine the PMVs under a confocal microscope using the 40X oil objective lens.\nAdd the series of diluted polyethylenimine (PEI) solution to the BMSC culture for 1 h and check for signs of cytotoxicity.\n\tNOTE: Here, the PEI at 2 µg/mL was chosen since no sign of toxicity was detected in BMSCs.\nHarvest the cells by trypsin digestion and add PEI at 2 µg/mL for 1 h to charge the cell membrane as a means of preventing aggregation. Generate PMVs, as described above, in 0.5 mL of culture medium. Concentrate the PMVs and examine them under a confocal microscope, as described above.\n5. Injection of PMVs into the Gastrocnemius Muscle\nTo stain the membrane, add CM-DiI (chloromethyl dialkyl-indocarbocyanine) (10 μM) dye in 1 mL of fresh culture medium to the BMSCs for 30 min.\nHarvest the cells (about 5 x 105) by trypsin digestion and resuspend them in 0.5 mL of culture medium. Add PEI (2 µg/mL) for 1 h. Generate and concentrate the PMVs in 100 µL of culture medium, as described above.\nAnaesthetize a BALB/c mouse by injecting sodium barbital (10 mg/kg) after 12 h of fasting.\nClean the outside of the gastrocnemius muscle with 75% ethanol. Slowly inject the PMVs (100 µL) into the gastrocnemius muscle using a 30 G insulin syringe.",
    "After administering the anesthesia, place a wet gauze over the eyes for the duration of the experiment and warm the mouse with an incandescent light until it wakes up. House the mouse alone in an individual ventilation cage.\nTo harvest the gastrocnemius muscle 12 h post-operation, kill the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nSprinkle 75% ethanol over the gastrocnemius muscle, open the skin with scissors, and cut out the entire gastrocnemius muscle at both ends.\nRinse the muscle with PBS and examine it under a fluorescence microscope using the 20X objective lens.\nTrim the muscle with a sharp razor blade to remove of the parts with no fluorescence. Cut the parts with strong red fluorescence into about 9 mm3 cubes.\nEmbed each cube in optimal cutting temperature medium (OCT), submerge it in liquid nitrogen for 5 min, and store it in a -20 °C freezer until use.\nCut the frozen sections into pieces 20 µm thick using a cryostat and adhere each section to a glass slide. Rinse the section once with PBS.\nDraw a circle around the section with a stain circle pen and add 100 µL of DAPI (1 µg/mL). Aspirate the DAPI solution after 10 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark and wash three times with PBS.\nDrop mounting oil over the specimen, cover it with a glass slip, and seal the slide with nail polish. Examine the section under a confocal microscope using the 100X oil objective lens.\nTo detect CM-DiI, turn on the 543 nm laser and collect signal at 560-615 nm. To detect DAPI, turn on the 405 nm laser and collect signal at 420-480 nm. Set the pinhole value to about 1.4.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
