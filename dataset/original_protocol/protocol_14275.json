    "Taipei Medical University Joint Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study.\n1. SBRT Consultation\nAssess patient eligibility for SBRT for the treatment of liver metastases by consulting a multidisciplinary tumor board.\n\tNOTE: The need for local ablation as well as operation and other treatment options must be evaluated by the tumor board. Our selection criteria were as follows: 1) adult patients with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1), 2) controlled cancer status through anticancer medication and with only oligometastases in the liver, 3) number of hepatic lesions ≤3 and largest tumor ≤6 cm in diameter, 4) liver volume (liver excluding gross tumor) greater than 700 cm3, and 5) without acute hepatitis or chronic hepatitis B under stable antiviral control.\nDiscuss SBRT and its associated risks as well as the differences between SBRT and conventional radiotherapy with the patient9,19.\n2. CT Simulation\nPlace the patient in a supine position, head-first on the couch with arms over the head.\nUse a system (e.g., BodyFIX) to immobilize the patient. Position the patient in a personalized, evacuated vacuum bag and cover the patient with a cover sheet.\nApply an abdominal compressor (AC), and mark the depth of the AC.\n\t\tNOTE: The AC restricts the patient's breathing motion; therefore, some patients may develop dyspnea during this procedure. Oxygen supplementation through the nasal cannula should be provided to relieve their discomfort.\nPlace the breath-tracking sensor on the chest wall and monitor the respiratory waveform.\nAcquire CT images for radiotherapy treatment planning.\nChoose 4D-CT scan mode with a 3 mm slice thickness.\nConduct a surview scan (120 kV, 30 mA) to obtain both anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral view of the patient. Click on \"Go\" on both the screen and the control panel.",
    "Determine the CT scanning coverage under \"Helical scan\" pagination and decide the scanning field of 4D-CT under \"Pulmonary gating scan\" pagination.\n\t\tNOTE: The coverage of the helical scan should extend from the apex of both the lungs to a distance of at least 5 cm from the caudal border of the liver. The field of pulmonary gating scan, which is smaller than helical scan, should cover the liver with a 3-5 cm extend from both cranial and caudal borders of the liver.\nMonitor the respiratory waveform until it remains stable for 3 min.\nInject 100 mL of contrast agent (e.g., Omnipaque), at a rate of 4-5 mL/s, through an 18 G i.v. catheter into antecubital vein.\nConduct a contrasted contiguous helical CT scan (120 kV, 400 mAs/slice), 15 s after the contrast injection.\nSubsequently conduct a non-contrasted 4D-CT scan (120 kV, 2,000 mAs/slice) by clicking \"Next Series\".\n3. Radiotherapy Treatment Planning\nImport images from the CT simulation and diagnostic scans into the planning system.\n\tNOTE: Diagnostic images may include positron emission tomography (PET)/PET-CT, magnetic resonance image, or diagnostic helical CT scans.\nContour metastatic tumors into gross tumor volume and adjacent organs at risk (OARs).\nChoose an organ (here, the stomach) and use the brush, pencil, etc. to contour the organ in each slice of the CT image. Circle or define the organ of interest. Use \"Up\" and \"Down\" buttons to view each image slice.\n\t\tNOTE: The OARs include the lungs, stomach, duodenum, spinal cord, liver, small bowel, ribs, and kidneys.\nContour the internal target volume (ITV) of the tumors according to organ motion observed on dynamic tracking images. Add a 5-mm margin to the ITV to obtain the planning target volume (PTV).",
    "Choose an organ (here, the stomach) and use the brush, pencil, etc. to contour the organ in each slice of the CT image. Circle or define the organ of interest. Use \"Up\" and \"Down\" buttons to view each image slice.\nPrescribe radiation doses of 48 Gy in three fractions or 35 Gy in five fractions to the PTV for relatively large tumors.\n\tNOTE: A treatment plan must consider constraints due to the OARs; a relatively high prescription dose may be acceptable if the radiation dose to the OARs is within the constraints (Table 1).\n4. Treatment Delivery\nReconfirm the radiation beam data by using daily quality assurance and ensure that the data are within the normal range.\nIdentify the patient using the patient's name, birth date, and ID card. Position the patient in the vacuum bag, place the cover sheet, and fix the AC according to the procedure described in the CT simulation section.\nAcquire a 4D cone-beam CT (CBCT) image and adjust the couch to correlate the target location obtained on the 4D-CBCT image to that obtained on the simulation CT images.\nSelect 4D CBCT mode and confirm setup data. Click \"Go\" on the panel.\nAfter 4D CBCT, load the acquired 4D CBCT images into the IGRT system. The upper left and lower right images are from CT simulation as the contouring and treatment planning. The upper right and lower left images are from 4D CBCT, which is performed daily before each fraction.\nUse the software to adjust the set up. Then, manually adjust each parameter on the couch. The couch has only 3 linear motions in X, Y, and Z axes while the system could have adjustment in 6, including rotation, pitch and roll. Therefore, the technicians need to corroborate the adjustment.",
    "Record and print out the parameters for daily adjustment.\n\t\tNOTE: If the tumor position shifts beyond the tolerance limit of 5 mm on any one of six axes, the patient should be repositioned.\nDeliver radiation treatment. Confirm treatment plan and the system configuration. Click Go to start the treatment. Monitor the patient using real-time cameras during the entire treatment to ensure patient safety.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
