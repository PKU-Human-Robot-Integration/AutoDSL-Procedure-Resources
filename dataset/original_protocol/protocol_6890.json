    "RAW264.7 cell cultureMaintain mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in RPMI-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin in the incubator at 37°C under 5% CO2. Use cells for a maximum of 15 passages.For each passage, rinse cells with 2 ml Trypsin-EDTA and subsequently incubate for 5 min at 37°C. Suspend cells in 8 ml RPMI-glutamax medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS before centrifugation at 800 × g.Recover cell pellets in 500 µl tissue culture freezing media (see Recipes) and transfer to cryovials for storage in liquid nitrogen, or in 10 ml culture medium for dispatch on 10-cm plates for further culture or frustrated phagocytosis.Frustrated phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cellsPre-coat 10-cm dishes with BSA (3%) and either rabbit anti-BSA IgG (0.04 mg/ml) or sheep anti-BSA IgG (0.04 mg/ml).Collect RAW264.7 cells from confluent plates and determine the number of cells per ml with a hemocytometer. It should be near 2 × 107 per 10-cm cell culture dish. Suspend 2 × 107 cells in cold serum-free medium and incubate on the pre-coated surfaces at 4°C for 1 h.Warm to 37°C for 30 min to initiate cell spreading. As controls, plate macrophages on surfaces pre-coated with immune complexes and maintain at 4°C or plate on surfaces pre-coated with BSA alone. Under these conditions, the macrophages remain round and do not spread over the plate (see Kassas et al., 2017).Subcellular fractionationScrape RAW264.7 macrophages from ten different 10-cm dishes in 40 ml PBS for each condition (4°C or 37°C) (Figure 1).Pellet cells at 200 × g for 7 min and resuspend in 40 ml isolation medium (see Recipes).Repeat the operation once to remove salts.Suspend the pellet in 40 ml isolation medium containing 100 mM sucrose (slightly hypotonic medium) for effective homogenization, and pellet cells at 200 × g (Figure 1).",
    "Under hypotonic conditions, water flows into cells and causes them to swell, favoring plasma membrane rupture.Transfer the pellet to a glass Dounce homogenizer and add 10 ml last supernatant to suspend the pellet.Homogenize by 40 strokes with a tight-fitting pestle.Combine the resulting mixture with the remaining supernatant.Add 3.5 ml isolation medium containing 1.78 M sucrose (a hypertonic medium) to bring the homogenate back to an isotonic state, limiting further rupture of organelles.Supplement with 2 mM MgCl2 to preserve nuclei in subsequent steps.Centrifuge at 200 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei/unbroken cells (save pellet as crude nuclear pellet).Centrifuge the supernatant at 5,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria (save pellet as mitochondria).Centrifuge the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h to pellet ER, microsomes, and plasmalemma fragments (microsomal pellet).Centrifuge the post-nuclear supernatant at 300 × g for 10 min to remove residual nuclei (Figure 1).Centrifuge the post-mitochondrial supernatant at 5,000 × g for 10 min to remove residual mitochondria (Figure 1).Wash and re-pellet the crude nuclear pellet in MgCl2-containing media. Wash and re-pellet mitochondria in MgCl2-free media.Retain the supernatant from the 100,000 × g spin as the cytosolic fraction.Prepare gradient media for each fraction as described in Recipes.Centrifuge nuclei gradient media in an SW-41 rotor at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and mitochondrial and microsomal gradient media at 50,000 × g for 2 h (Figure 1).Recover nuclei at the 30/35% OptiPrep interface; mitochondria at the 17.5/25% interface; plasmalemma and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at the 10/17.5% and 17.5/25% interfaces, respectively; and microsomes at the dense 25/35% interface.Freeze each sample in liquid nitrogen and store at -80°C.Measure protein concentration in each sample by the Bradford assay (Table 1). Note: We noted no significant differences in protein concentration among the different fractions obtained from RAW264.",

    "Check the fraction purity by immunoblots using specific markers for the different fractions as described previously (Kassas et al., 2017;          Tanguy et al., 2020). Suitable markers are the nuclei: Histone H3, the endoplasmic reticulum: calnexin, the plasma membrane: Na+/K+ ATPase, the microsome: cytochrome p450, mitochondria: HSP-60, and the cytosol: GAPDH.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4066/bioprotoc-11-12-4066-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of the different steps from subcellular fractionation to lipidomics analysis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Mitochondria (Mito), Plasma membrane (PM).Phosphatidic acid extractionTransfer the subcellular membrane fraction samples containing 200 µg protein in glass centrifuge tubes containing 1 ml water.Add 2 ml chloroform/methanol 2/1 v/v and 100 µl 34:0_17:0 PA (17 µM) used as an internal standard, since it is not present in the samples due to the odd number of carbons.Sonicate for 30 s at room temperature and mix vigorously.Centrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g at room temperature to separate the organic and aqueous phases.Collect the lower organic phase and transfer to clean glass tubes.Add 2 ml chloroform to the upper aqueous phase.Sonicate for 30 s and mix vigorously.Centrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g at room temperature to separate the organic and aqueous phases.Collect the lower organic phase and combine with the organic phase collected in Step D5.Use the evaporator to dry the combined organic phases (Figure 1).Mass spectrometry analysis dedicated to phosphatidic acidResuspend samples in 50 µl eluant A (LC solvent, see Recipes).Transfer samples to glass vials suitable for injection.Place the vials in the autosampler at 4°C.Separate PA species on an LC 1,200 Infinity II system equipped with a Luna C8 150 × 1 mm column with the following gradient (Figure 1):0 min start at 70% eluent A, 30% eluent B (see Recipes).0 to 5 min ramp at 50% eluent A, 50% eluent B.",
    "5 to 30 min ramp to 20% eluent A, 80% eluent B.31 to 41 min hold at 5% eluent A, 95% eluent B.42 to 52 min hold to 70% eluent A, 30% eluent B.Note: Mass spectrometry analysis dedicated to phosphatidic acid is adapted from Buré et al. (2014). Subject the HPLC eluates to coupled electrospray ionization in the negative ionization mode and to subsequent tandem MS analysis on a QTrap 6,500 mass spectrometer with the following settings optimized for this equipment to have a better intensity during fragmentation:Dwell time 30 ms.Declustering potential (DP) – 172 V.Entrance potential (EP) – 10V.Collision energy (CE) – 46V.Collision cell exit potential (CXP) – 15V.Quantitate the different PA species using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions information found in Table 2 (see attached file[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210512/Table%202.xlsx]). An example of an MRM chromatogram is shown in Figure 2.Table 2. List of MRM transitions for PA. All MRM are made in negative mode. Q1 corresponds to the mass of the parent ions (PA is negatively charged) and Q3 to the mass of the fragment (ion daughter), ID corresponds to the specific transition: for example, PA28:0_14:0 corresponds to PA with 28 carbons and no unsaturation, losing the fatty acid containing 14 carbons and no unsaturation. IS indicates the internal standard.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4066/bioprotoc-11-12-4066-g002.jpgFigure 2. Example of MRM chromatograms of all search transitions for PA. Each color corresponds to a transition for a specific PA species, for example: green with a maximum at 14.5 min corresponds to PA36:1_18:1; maroon with a maximum at 15.2 min corresponds to PA38:2_18:1; purple with a maximum at 16.7 min corresponds to PA38:1_18:1; and blue with a maximum at 10.5 min corresponds to PA40:6_18:0. Intensities of the detected signals are expressed in counts per second (cps)."
