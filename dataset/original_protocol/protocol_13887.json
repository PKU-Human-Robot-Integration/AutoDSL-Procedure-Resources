    "1. HRCT scanning\nPerform volumetric HRCT acquisition scanning of the chest36. Contrast agents are not required36,37:\nObtain the following acquisitions with parameters shown in Table 136,37.\n\t\nAcquire a supine inspiratory scan (volumetric) from the lung apices to the lung base.\nAcquire a supine expiratory scan (sequential with 10–20 mm gaps) from 2 cm below the lung apices to the lung base.\nAcquire a prone inspiratory optional (sequential with 10–20 mm gaps) from the carina to the lung base.\nGive breathing instructions to the patient before each acquisition36,37. For an inspiratory scan, say “Take in a deep breath….and let it out. Take in another deep breath….and let it out. Take in another deep breath, and hold your breath in. Keep holding your breath”37.\nObtain inspiratory scans at full inspiration35,36.\nUse the thinnest collimation, shortest rotation time and highest pitch to ensure that motion-free images are obtained36. Suggested scanning parameters are detailed in Table 137.\nFor optimal quality of volumetric scans, obtain thin section (<2 mm) images with high-spatial resolution reconstruction35,36.\nReview scans immediately after acquisition and repeat if either motion artifact is present or inadequate inspiration has occurred37.\n2. Reporting\nPrepare an interpretive report.\nShare the report and HRCT images with the patient’s care team and add them to the patient’s medical records."
