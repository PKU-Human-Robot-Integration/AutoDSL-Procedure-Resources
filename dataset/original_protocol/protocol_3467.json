    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue dissection and embedding in LMA\nTiming: approximately 75 min\nThe subsequent procedure describes the embedding of the dissected brain tissues in low melting agarose in order to facilitate the generation of robust tissue sections.\nExpose pregnant mice to lethal overdose of isoflurane and euthanize by cervical dislocation.\nSection the abdomen to reveal the uterus. Remove the uterine horns and place them in cold PBS 1×.\nCarefully remove the embryos from their yolk sac and isolate their heads. For embryos at E10.5-E12.5 it is advised to dissect the heads while for embryos at E14.5 or later stages it is suggested to dissect out the brains.\nClean the isolated tissues by performing 3 PBS 1× washes.\nPut a 48-well plate on ice and add 500 μL of LMA 3% while still in liquid form (45°C). Wait 1 min until the temperature becomes tolerable.\nRemove the excess liquid from each tissue using a perforated spoon and a piece of absorbent paper(∼40°C).\nPlace the tissue in the well and gently swirl with a pipette tip until the tissue is totally covered with LMA.\nPlace the tissue at the appropriate orientation carefully and support with the pipette tip until LMA starts to solidify.\nLeave the 48-well plate on ice until LMA is completely solid and afterwards place it at 4°C for 30 min.\nCritical: It is important for the tissue to be totally covered with LMA in order not to touch the bottom of the well plate and not to be exposed on the top.\nNote: The orientation of the tissue inside the well depends on the desired sectioning plane (coronal, sagittal, or transverse). For generation of coronal sections place the brain cerebellum vertically pointing the bottom of the well and the olfactory bulbs facing upwards.",
    "Pause Point: Place the remaining quantity of LMA that does not contain any tissue residue in a tube and when solid store at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nGeneration of brain sections\nTiming: approximately 15 min, depending on the tissue size\nThe following steps describe the generation of thick sections from freshly isolated mouse brain by using a vibrating microtome and highlight the appropriate settings depending on the developmental stage that is examined.\nRemove the embedded tissue from the 48-well plate by gently slide a micro spatula toward the well circumference until the embedded tissue springs out.\nRemove the excess amount of LMA with a scalpel and create a shape of trapezoid so that its bigger base touches the vibratome plate and its smaller base faces toward the vibratome blade. To generate coronal sections at the level of the cortex, the rostral part of the brain should face toward the blade\nStabilize the embedded tissue on the vibratome platform with a thin layer of instant glue and ensure that the sample will not be displaced by the vibratome blade. Wait 2 min until the glue is dried.\nPlace the vibratome plate in the tank with the appropriate screwdrivers and fill with cold PBS 1× to fully cover the sample.\nCut serial sections of 250 μm thickness. Adjust the vibratome settings according to the developmental stage studied. For later embryonic stages (E14.5 to E18.5) adjust the speed at 0,225 mm/s and frequency at 50 Hz while for earlier developmental stages (E10.5 to E12.5) and smaller tissues it is preferable to modify the settings of the vibratome (speed: 0,125 mm/s and frequency 70 Hz) to avoid destroying the tissue. In general, the higher the speed and the lower the frequency, the more suitable it is for vulnerable tissues.",
    "Prepare a 24-well plate with cold PBS 1× and keep it on ice.\nCollect consecutive sections of the brain with thin paint brushes and place them in separate wells of the 24-well plate on ice.\nNote: Given that the tissue at this stage is unfixed, the sections are fragile. Thus, it is advised to gently handle the sections by using the appropriate brushes. In case it is not possible for the sections to be removed of the brush try to slowly move the brush inside the well containing PBS 1× or pour additional PBS 1× over the brush. If the section tangles within the brush hairs, it becomes difficult to come out completely intact.\nPre-extraction and fixation of brain sections\nTiming: 1 h\nThe pre-extraction procedure aims to remove the freely diffusing proteins while the DNA-bound proteins remain intact within the cells. The following steps are performed in floating sections. It is important that the sections remain moist during the entire protocol to maintain tissue integrity and in order to avoid auto-fluorescence effect during subsequent imaging.\nSelect the sections that include the dorsal cortex. To get representative results, it is preferable to select two sections per sample in order to cover frontal and caudal cortical regions. For earlier embryonic stages one section is sufficient.\nTo remove the cytoplasmic soluble proteins, incubate the sections in the freshly prepared CSK buffer for 20 min on ice. Avoid shaking of the sections at this stage since the tissue is very fragile before fixation (Troubleshooting 2).\nWash once with cold PBS 1× on ice.\nFix the sections with PFA 4% for 30 min at 20°C–23°C.\nWash once with cold PBS 1× on ice.",
    "Critical: Keep 1–2 sections as control samples by skipping the incubation with the CSK buffer. Control sections are immediately fixed with PFA 4%.\nPause Point: Sections can be stored in 1 mM NaN3 solution in PBS at 4°C for 1 day in case that it is not possible to perform the following procedure at the same day.\nImmunofluorescent staining and EdU detection (day 1)\nTiming: at least 23 h\nThis process elaborates on the details of immunofluorescence, detection of thymidine analog, and mounting to the previously generated sections. Perform the staining in multiwell plates by removing and filling with the appropriate solutions the wells that contain the sections. The use of 24-well plates is recommended. Avoid transferring the sections within wells to maintain their morphology.\nWash the floating sections with PBT (PBS-Triton 0.1%) - BSA 1% three times for at least 30 min each. The first two washes should be performed at 4°C while the last one at 20°C–23°C.\nIncubate the sections in PBS-Triton 0.5% for 20 min at 20°C–23°C.\nWash with PBT-BSA 1% three times at 4°C for at least 30 min each.\nBlock the sections in blocking solution (1% FBS in PBT) for at least 1 h at 20°C–23°C.\nWash with PBT-BSA 1% for at least 30 min at 4°C.\nPerform the step of EdU staining by incubating the sections with the EdU detection solution (reaction buffer 10×, catalyst solution, dye azide 10 mM, buffer additive 10×) at 20°C–23°C for 30 min. From this point the sections should be protected from light.\nWash with PBT three times at 4°C for at least 30 min each.\nIncubate the sections with the primary antibody against MCM2 (dilution 1:500 in blocking solution) for16 h at 4°C.\nImmunofluorescent staining and EdU detection (day 2)\nTiming: at least 22 h",
    "Remove the primary antibody solution.\nWash the sections with PBT at 4°C three times for at least 2 h each.\nIncubate with fluorescent secondary antibody (dilution 1:1,000 in blocking solution) for16 h at 4°C.\nImmunofluorescent staining and EdU detection (day 3)\nTiming: 3.5 h\nRemove the secondary antibody solution.\nWash the sections with PBT at 4°C three times for at least 30 min each.\nPerform nuclear DNA staining with DAPI (dilution 1:1,500 in PBS 1×) for 7 min at 20°C–23°C.\nWash the sections with PBT at 4°C three times for at least 30 min each.\nAdd a drop of PBS 1× on a microscope slide and transfer the sections by using thin paint brushes and sharp forceps.\nRemove the excess amount of PBS with a piece of absorbent paper.\nAdd Mowiol 4-88 solution on the top of the section until to fully covered (60–100 μL per section) and gently drop the coverslip.\nKeep the slides horizontally at 20°C–23°C until the Mowiol is polymerized. For long-term storage keep them at 4°C.\nImaging and analysis of DNA-bound MCM complexes\nFor the imaging of the mounted brain sections use a confocal system equipped with a fluorescent microscope. Use at least a 63× high NA oil immersion lens to focus on the dorsal cortex. To analyze the MCM complexes, acquire images with an electronic zoom of 3 or higher with at least a 1,024 × 1,024 pixels resolution.",
    "Before the analysis, it is important to confirm that the soluble proteins have been sufficiently removed while the DNA-bound proteins are intact on the tissue. In the section incubated with CSK the cells that are in S phase (distinguished as EdU+) exhibit distinct patterns of nuclear MCM2 staining, which represent the recruitment of MCM complexes in the origins of DNA replication. In contrast, the cells in the section incubated without CSK present a uniform nuclear staining for MCM2, corresponding to both bound and soluble fractions of MCM proteins. A representative image of confocal acquisition of brain sections incubated or not in CSK buffer is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/354-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. DNA-bound MCMs in the neural stem cells of the mouse dorsal cortex\nRepresentative images of mouse embryos cortexes at E14.5 with (+CSK) or without pre-extraction (-CSK) after immunofluorescent staining for MCM2 and EdU. DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 10 μm.\nTo analyze multiple cells at the same time, acquire serial z-stacks with a step size of 0.7 μm to a total z-volume 7.608 μm and pinhole set to 1 Airy unit. The nucleus volume of a mammalian cell is between 600–1,500 μm3, and therefore images of higher volume will include more than two layers of cells, making the analysis of single cells impossible.\nThe intensity of MCM staining in CSK treated sections is representative of the DNA-bound MCM complexes. Fluorescent intensity per nucleus is quantified with the open-source platform ImageJ.\nNote: Intensities measurements are performed in sum slices projection. If necessary, use the subtract background plugin of ImageJ with a rolling ball radius equal to the average size of the nuclei to remove the intensities of the background due to unspecific staining."
