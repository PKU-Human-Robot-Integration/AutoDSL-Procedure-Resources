    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAerosol challenge of mice\nTiming: 30 min\nUpon completion, the aerosol challenge of mice will accomplish the goal of instilling bacteria into their respiratory system. 10-week-old, female CD-1 mice were used in this challenge model and afterward housed in filtertop cages with 5 mice per cage and food and water ad libitum. Setup and usage of the chamber followed the manufacturer’s instructions in their application manual found here: Mass Dosing System Application Manual (011283-001).pdf.\nMove mouse cages into the biosafety hood and remove the lids of the cage and dosing chamber.\nMoving one mouse at a time, transfer mice from the cage into a compartment inside the mass dosing chamber.\nOnce an entire cage has been transferred, replace the lid, and move the cage from the biosafety hood.\nRepeat this process for all mice being challenged.\nOpen the silicon stoppers on top of the nebulizer heads and carefully pipette 5 mL of the challenge dose into the nebulizer basin.\nNote: 5 mL will be nebulized in each of the 4 nebulizers for a total of 20 mL of liquid challenge dose.\nNote: This dose is approximately 1011 CFU per aerosol chamber volume (36.6 L).\nSeal the silicon stoppers on top of the nebulizer heads.\nSet a 5-min timer to allow the animals to acclimate to the new environment.\nEnsure that all settings are correct on the DSI Buxco® FinePointe™ Mass Dosing Controller.\nDuty Cycle: 100%.\nAerosolization time: 10 min.\nAir Flow Rate: 2 LPM.\nPress the start button on the mass dosing controller.\nNote: A mist will start descending from the nebulizer heads once started.\nIncrease the fresh air flow rate to 5 LPM after the 10-min nebulizing time is complete.\nNote: This increases the clearance of the dose from the chamber.",
    "Set a 5-min timer to ensure the challenge dose has cleared the chamber or settled out of the air.\nRemove the chamber’s lid and use a grasping tool/ protective sleeve to remove the mice from their compartments and return them to their original cage.\nCritical: Be sure to replace the chamber lid in between mice so that no animals can escape by climbing the dividers in the chamber.\nSanitizing the chamber and nebulizers\nTiming: 20 min\nThis step ensures the chamber is sanitized from all BSL2 level agents before leaving the challenge location.\nSpray the inside of the chamber down with non-alcohol-based cleaner (e.g., peroxiguard) and wipe up debris with the solution.\nRemove waffle dividers and floorboard, spraying with a non-alcohol-based cleaner and allow to air dry.\nSpray the inside of the chamber down with a non-alcohol-based cleaner (peroxiguard) and wipe up any debris.\nNote: Be sure to spray and wipe down the underside of the chamber lid as well.\nGently remove the nebulizer heads from the chamber lid and place them in a container of warm soapy water.\nGently swish the nebulizer heads around and transfer them to a container with clean distilled water.\nSwish nebulizer heads to remove any remaining detergent and move to an autoclave sleeve.\nFollowing the manufacturer’s instructions, flash steam sterilize the nebulizer head.\nWe used the following settings: Max temp 121°C, time at temp 3 min, drying time 2 min.\nRemove nebulizer heads from autoclave sleeves and allow them to dry on their side before being stored.\nEuthanasia and data collection\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section is to provide humane euthanasia at the selected endpoint for the study (1 h post-challenge) and for prompt organ collection and bacterial enumeration.\nEuthanize mice by IP injection of pentobarbital (Euthasol®) following institutional guidelines.",
    "Note: We use a working concentration of 39 mg/mL and inject 10 μL/g of body weight.\nOnce mice are non-reactive to pinch point reflexes, perform a cardiac puncture and remove 1 mL of blood from the mice.\nDissect the mice and remove the trachea and lungs from the thoracic cavity.\nPlace a 1.5 mL Eppendorf on the nose of the mouse and insert an 18-gauge catheter from below the trachea.\nFlush the nasal cavity with 1 mL sterile 1× PBS.\nExcise and separate the lungs and trachea.\nPlace the lungs into a GentleMacs® C-tube with 1 mL of sterile 1 × PBS.\nHomogenize lung samples in C-tubes with a GentleMacs® Octo Dissociator with setting m_Lung_02_01.\nPipette 75 μL of homogenate from the C-tube into 75 μL of sterile 1× PBS to be used as a direct dilution.\nRemove the esophagus from the trachea samples and place in a 15 mL culture tube with 1 mL of sterile 1× PBS.\nHomogenize trachea samples for 5 s using a Polytron® homogenizer.\nSerially dilute lung and trachea samples 1:10.\nPlate samples by pipetting 10 μL of the serial dilutions with 4 technical replicates on BG agar with 15% defibrinated sheep’s blood and 100 μL/ mL of Streptomycin.\nDry plated samples at room temp (20°C–25°C).\nOnce dry, invert plates and incubate at 36°C for 72 h.\nAfter incubation, remove the plates and count CFUs in a dilution row with a countable range to enumerate bacterial burden.\nNote: We use a countable range of 5–60 CFU per dot.\nMultiply the number of CFUs by the dilution factor for each technical replicate.\nAverage all four technical replicates to obtain the CFU/ mL in the sample."
