    "All mice were maintained in pathogen-free animal facilities at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) or the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI). All experiments involving mice were performed according to regulations and protocols approved by the respective Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (ARC-2019-013; UCLA) or (MD-23-17184-3; HUJI). A general workflow of the experimental steps is shown in Figure 2A. See the Table of Materials for details related to all instruments, reagents, and materials used in this protocol.\n1. Preparation of solutions and gels\nDissection medium: Prepare fresh DMEM/F12 with 0.5% glucose and keep it warm at 37 °C until needed in step 2.4.\n\tNOTE: We use DMEM/F12 without phenol red to reduce autofluorescence during live imaging.\n1x Culture medium: Prepare fresh medium using 50% DMEM/F12, 50% rat serum, 1x glutamine substitute, 1x MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1% glucose, 0.1 mg/mL L-ascorbic acid, and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin. Keep it warm at 37 °C until needed in step 5.5. This medium is used for culturing incisor explants during live imaging.\n\tNOTE: The rat serum should be of high quality and specially prepared for whole tissue culturing by researchers or from a commercial source. In particular, the blood must be centrifuged (for 5 min at 1,200 × g at room temperature) before clotting begins to form. After centrifugation, the resulting fibrin clot should be squeezed and discarded33.\nCulture gel: The purpose of the gel is to immobilize samples during imaging and is prepared fresh.\n\t\nMake 2% gel in DMEM/F12 by dissolving 200 mg of low melting point agarose in 10 mL of DMEM/F12 using a microwave. Keep the 2% gel at 37 °C.",
    "Make 2x culture medium (without DMEM/F12) by mixing 50% rat serum, 1x glutamine substitute, 1x MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1% glucose, 0.1 mg/mL L-ascorbic acid, and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin. Warm the 2x culture medium (without DMEM/F12) to 37 °C.\nMake 1% culture gel by mixing equal volumes of 2% gel and 2x culture medium (without DMEM/F12). Keep the 1% culture gel at 37 °C until needed in step 5.1.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure all solutions are warm before mixing to avoid gelling. We found 1% gel to be suitable for culturing the adult mouse incisor. Gel percentage should be empirically determined if other tissues are to be cultured.\n2. Extraction of the adult mouse mandibles\nEuthanize mice at the desired age using standard procedures approved by the IACUC.\n\tNOTE: Here we use CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Regulations for animal euthanasia may vary in different regions. Researchers should obtain necessary institutional approval prior to performing experiments and ensure compliance with local animal care regulations.\nDisinfect the mouse using 70% ethanol.\nDecapitate the mouse and extract the left and right mandibles.\n\t\nLay the mouse on its belly, then use a #9 single-edge industrial razor blade to cut at the neck region and separate the mouse head from the rest of the body.\n\t\tNOTE: If tissues from the pharynx or the neck region are to be collected as well, decapitation should not be performed, and one can directly proceed to step 2.3.2.\nTurn the mouse over so its ventral side is facing up and the mandibles are easily accessible.\nSecure the animal's head by holding it gently between the thumb and the index finger.\nUse the razor blade to make a mid-sagittal incision that cuts over the skin of the lower jaw from the lower lip toward the neckline.",
    "NOTE: A #15 surgical blade can also be used to make the incision and subsequent dissections (steps 2.3.6-2.3.9).\nAs the incision is made, spread open the cut skin using the thumb and the index finger to expose the muscles and jawbone underneath.\nUse the razor blade to sever the masseter muscles on the buccal side of the lower jaw, such that the outside of the left and right hemimandibles are now free from muscle attachments.\nSever the mylohyoid muscles along the inner side of the mandible to remove muscle attachments there.\nMake another incision at the mandibular symphysis that connects the two hemimandibles. Once cut, the mandible will be separated into the left and right halves.\nWedge the razor blade between the mandibular condyle and the temporal mandibular joint and carefully dissect out the hemimandible from the rest of the head.\n\t\tNOTE: We found it helpful to simultaneously pull gently on the incisor while cutting. Care should be taken to avoid breaking the mandible and damaging the soft tissues within.\nImmediately transfer dissected mandibles to a Petri dish with the prewarmed dissection media (step 1.1) and remove the remaining muscle tissues using a #15 surgical blade.\n\tNOTE: Keeping samples in cold media slows down cell activities, resulting in delayed or even failed recoveries of certain cell activities, such as proliferation or cell movement, during live imaging.\n3. Isolation of the whole mouse incisors\nNOTE: Further isolation of the incisor is done under a bright field dissection microscope.\nVisually identify the oval region of the mandible that covers the incisor socket and houses the apical portion of the incisor.\nPosition the mandible so the inner (lingual) surface is facing upwards.",
    "While holding the mandible in place with a pair of serrated forceps, generate a window at the oval region by shaving off the overlying membrane bone using a #15 surgical blade, in a direction that is from the condyle towards the molars. This exposes the soft tissue of the apical incisor on the inner surface.\nTurn over the mandible so the outer (buccal) surface is facing upwards.\nGenerate a window at the oval region on the outer mandible as described in step 3.3 and use the tip of the scalpel to pick away any remaining bone fragments at the edge. Ensure that the apical end of the tooth is visible from both sides.\n\tNOTE: Avoid excessive pressure while shaving the bones to prevent damage to the underlying soft tissue.\nSystematically cut away the bones surrounding the incisor to isolate the entire tooth.\n\t\nMake a clean cut at a plane that is immediately adjacent to the apical incisor to first remove the condylar process.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to cut into the incisor.\nMake a second cut just posterior to the 3rd molar, but dorsal to the incisor without damaging the tooth. This removes the bone that includes the coronoid process.\nSerially cut from the tip of the angular process towards the incisor to gradually remove the ventral mandible in a stepwise manner.\n\t\tNOTE: The dental epithelium and associated periodontal tissues are often stuck to the bone and easily ripped off if a large portion of the ventral bone is cut at once. To separate the bone from the incisor soft tissue, one can insert the scalpel (or a pair of sharp non-serrated forceps) between the two tissues at the apical end of the incisor and delicately slide the instrument forward.",
    "Cut away the alveolar bone with molars and any remaining bones that are still attached to the incisor.\nThe entire incisor is now isolated. Transfer the fully dissected incisor to a dish with clean warm dissection media (step 1.1).\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.6 to isolate additional incisors as required.\n\tNOTE: The maxillary/upper incisors of the mouse also maintain adult stem cells and can be used to study tooth regeneration34. Dental researchers typically focus on the lower incisors because they are more accessible and can be more easily dissected than the upper incisors. Differences between mandibular and maxillary incisor progenitor cells remain to be determined.\n4. Removal of periodontal tissues to expose the incisor epithelial cervical loop\nWith the whole incisor lying down on its lingual side and while holding the tooth in place with a pair of serrated forceps, use a pair of #5 fine forceps to start tucking on the periodontal tissues covering the apical incisor and the cervical loop region.\nCarefully peel off the periodontal tissue from the apical bud, such that the lateral side of the cervical loop (or other regions of interest) becomes visible under the scope.\n\tNOTE: Care should be taken to avoid damaging the dental epithelium or detaching it from the mesenchyme. If the incisor has fluorescence signals in the region of interest, and a fluorescent dissection microscope is available, fluorescence signals can be used to help distinguish between tissue types and aid dissections. It is important to efficiently carry out sections 2-4 so samples can be quickly transferred into the culture media and adequately maintained through explant culturing (see below).\n5. Tissue embedding for explant culture",
    "Add 500 µL of warm, unsolidified culture gel to a well in a 24-well plate and quickly transfer the dissected whole incisors to the well. Swirl the plate a few times to rinse the incisors.\nAdd 400 µL of warm, unsolidified culture gel to a culture dish and transfer the rinsed incisors to the dish.\n\tNOTE: We use a commercially available culture dish that is compatible with the perfusion setup. See step 6.4 for alternative options.\nOrient the incisor to position the cervical loop region (or other regions of interest) at the center of the dish (Figure 2A,B) and adjust the tilt of the apical incisor for the desired imaging plane.\n\tNOTE: Tissue orientation should be done quickly before complete gelation.\nAfter the gel is set, use a pair of fine forceps to remove any gel on top of the region of interest so it is not covered by gel.\nAdd a sufficient volume of warm culture media by slowly pipetting it against the edge of the dish to just cover the sample (~150 µL).\nMove the explant culture to a 37 °C cell culture incubator to allow tissue settling and adjustment to the culture condition for 1 h.\n6. Timelapse microscopy of incisor explants\nNOTE: In this experiment, we used an upright microscope equipped with a 25x water-dipping objective that has a numerical aperture of 1. In general, a water dipping lens with a high numerical aperture is best suited for deep tissue imaging.\nTurn on the microscope and the two-photon laser.\nSecure the culture dish to the stage adapter and mount the perfusion adapter ring on top (Figure 2C).\nConnect the stage adapter to a temperature controller set to maintain the culture at 37 °C.",
    "Connect the inlet and the outlet of the adapter ring to a micro-perfusion pump and begin perfusion of the culture medium, with the perfusion speed set at 20 on the pump. This generates a slow flow (~5 mL/h) of the culture medium over the top of the samples (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: See the Table of Materials for details about the system to maintain the tissue in a stably controlled environment. Other systems can be used as well. A combination of a 37 °C heating plate and a homemade perfusion culture dish (Supplemental Figure S1) with an inlet and an outlet connected to syringe pumps can also be used.\nPlace an Atmospheric Control Barrier Ring (ACBR) on top of the adapter ring and lower the objective through the ACBR to just make contact with the culture medium (Figure 2D).\nTune the laser wavelength to 920 nm to visualize both GFP and red fluorescence (e.g., tdTomato) signals.\nLocate samples through eyepieces and then on the microscope's software.\nSet up Z-stacks, multi-position imaging, and time intervals using the software. To follow this protocol, use a z-step size of 4 μm and a time interval of 5 min for 14 h.\n\tNOTE: We found that a time interval of longer than 5 min is often insufficient to capture smooth cell movements and divisions.\nInitiate the timelapse imaging.\n\tNOTE: Sample position may shift during the first hour and further adjustments may be required.\nSave files for downstream data processing and analyses.\nSubscription Required.
