    "All animal experiments were performed in compliance with guidelines provided by the institutional animal care and use committee of South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.\n1. System Setup\nOptical path (Figure 1)\n\t\nUse a 532 nm pulse laser as the system laser source. Set the repetition rate of the laser to 10 kHz, the output energy to 100% and the trigger setting to external trigger using a user-defined program.\nCouple the laser beam to single-mode fiber (SMF) via an optical fiber coupler (FC1). Collimate the laser beam using an optical fiber collimator (FC2) on a two-dimensional motorized stage (Motor, maximum speed: 20 mm/s).\nDeflect the laser beam using a two-axis galvanometer scanner (Galva). Use a moveable mirror (M1) to reflect the beam. Focus the beam through a 4× objective lens (OL, Numerical aperture: 0.1).\nUse an XY translator mount (TM) to fix the self-made hollow ultrasonic transducer (UT, Central frequency: 25 MHz; Bandwidth: more than 90%; Center hole: 3 mm) on the bottom of the OL12. Pass the focused beam through the center hole of the ultrasonic transducer.\nScanning path\n\t\nLock the Galva using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA 2) during WIM. Set the appropriate scanning range and scanning speed by a user-defined program.\nLock the Motor using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA 1) during RIM. Set the scanning frequency and number of scanning points using FPGA 2. Use a user-defined program to control the start and stop scanning.\nData acquisition\n\t\nUse a 50-dB amplifier (AMP) to amplify the PA signal. Digitize the signal by the data acquisition card (DAQ). Obtain the trigger signal through FPGA 1 or FPGA 2.\nUse a graphics processing unit (GPU) to process data and display images in parallel13.\nCCD imaging system",
    "Use a ring-shaped white LED (Color temperature: 6500 K; Illuminance: 40000 lux; Diameter: 7.5 cm) as a lighting source. Remove M1, use a fixed mirror (M2) to reflect the light.\nRecord the images using a CCD camera (6.3 million pixels) on the PA imaging system. Display the images with a display software.\n2. System alignment\nSelect a water tank (10 cm × 10 cm × 4.4 cm; bottom window: 3 cm × 3 cm). Cover the entire water tank using a polyethylene membrane (membrane thick: 10 μm). Add sufficient ultrapure water.\nPlace the water tank on the working stage.\nTurn on the laser switch. Select the laser control program. Preheat for 5 min. Press the “ON” button on the pumping switch. Set the laser parameters as per step 1.1.1. Open the baffle of the laser.\nSelect the A-line collected program. Press the “Start” button to capture the single point signal and display amplitude and spectrum of the current A-line signal.\nPlace a blade at the bottom of the water tank. Immerse the bottom part of UT in the water tank for acoustic coupling. Avoid bubbles in the bottom part of UT.\nAdjust the position of Galva, adjust XY translator between UT and OL to avoid oscillation signal, and make sure this is confocal.\nAdjust the height of the working stage to maximize the amplitude of the signal, and determine the focus position.\n3. Animal experiment\nUse a 5‒6 weeks old BALB/c mouse with a bodyweight of 20‒30 g.\nAnesthetize the animal using urethane (1 g/kg) injected intraperitoneally before the experiment. \nConduct transition between WIM and RIM.",
    "Use a planar ultrasonic transducer. Shave the fur on the back of the mouse using a trimmer and depilatory cream. Place the mouse on the holder (8 cm × 2.8 cm × 2 cm) in prone position.\nAllow the imaging region to be in contact with the polyethylene membrane using ultrasound gel. Avoid bubbles in the contact part.\nPlace the holder on the working stage for acoustic coupling. Follow steps 2.3‒2.4 to start the laser and collect A-line signal. Follow steps 2.6‒2.7 to align. Press “Stop” to end the collection after alignment.\nSelect the WIM program. Name the newly created folder. Set the scanning parameter at to 20 mm/s in the “Scanning Speed” tab, “20 mm*20 mm” in the “Scanning Area” tab, and “20” in the “Step” tab. Click the Collect button to start scanning.\nClick the Stop button to end scanning after acquisition. Click Return to Zero to bring the Motor to zero. Close the laser baffle. Set the trigger setting to internal trigger. Press the OFF button for pumping switch.\nReplace WIM trigger as RIM trigger and connect it to the external laser trigger. Press the ON button for pumping switch. Set the trigger setting to the external trigger. Click the Exit button to exit the WIM program.\nUse step 2.4 to collect the A-line signal. Open the laser baffle. Follow steps 2.6‒2.7 to align. Press Stop to end collection after alignment.\nSelect the RIM program. Name the newly created folder. Click the Collect button to start scanning.\nClick the Stop button to end scanning after completing acquisition. Click the Exit button to exit the RIM program.\nEuthanize the animal using cervical dislocation at the conclusion of the imaging.\nConduct WIM of vascular visualization.",
    "Use a focused ultrasonic transducer (Central frequency: 25 MHz; Bandwidth: more than 90%; Focal length: 8 mm). Remove the hair of mice ear or scalp.\n\t\t\nUse a scalpel to make a small incision on the lateral side of the cranial temporal top of the mouse (depth to the skull). Use ophthalmic scissors to start from this incision. Cut the scalp around the outer side of the skull. Compress the bleeding point to stop bleeding. Wash the wound with normal saline. Place the mouse on the holder.\nAllow the imaging region to be in contact with the polyethylene membrane using ultrasound gel. Avoid bubbles in the contact region (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPlace the holder on the work stage for acoustic coupling. Use steps 2.3‒2.4 to open laser and collect A-line signal. Use step 2.6‒2.7 to align. Press Stop to end collection after alignment.\nSelect WIM program. Name the newly created folder. Set the scanning parameter to “10 mm/s” in the “Scanning Speed” tab, “10 mm*10 mm” under the “Scanning Area” tab, and “10” in the “Step” tab. Click the Collect button to start scanning.\nClick the Stop button to end scanning after completing acquisition. Click the Return to Zero to make the Motor return to zero. Click the Exit button to exit the WIM program.\nEuthanize the animal at the conclusion of the procedure while the animal is still under anesthesia.\nConduct RIM for dynamic monitoring of small animals.\n\t\nShave the hair of the mouse abdomen. Place the mouse on the holder in supine position.\nAllow the imaging region to be in contact with the polyethylene membrane using ultrasound gel. Avoid bubbles in the contact region.",
    "Place the holder on the work stage for acoustic coupling. Perform steps 2.3‒2.4 to start the laser and collect A-line signal. Perform step 2.6‒2.7 to align. Press Stop to end collection after alignment.\nSelect the RIM program. Name the newly created folder. Click the Collect button to start scanning.\nClick the Stop button to end scanning after completing acquisition. Click the Exit button to exit the RIM program.\nUse the RIM data for reconstruction of the maximum amplitude projection (MAP) along the depth direction by user-defined program. Observe the dynamic changes in the animal.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
