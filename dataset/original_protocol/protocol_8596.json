  "procedures": [
    "The experimental procedures described in this protocol involve exclusively work with Drosophila and are not subjected to animal welfare laws in Germany and Japan.\n1. Light Exposure Conditions\nPrepare flies that carry sensless-flippase (sens-flp) and bruchpilot-FRT-STOP-FRT-gfp (brp-FSF-gfp)15 for visualizing Brp-GFP in photoreceptor R8 neurons (R8s). The genomic locus encoding brp within a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) was modified to generate this brp-FSF-gfp construct. In the flies carrying this modified BAC the expression of Brp-GFP is under the control of the endogenous regulatory sequences, but limited to R8 photoreceptors after sensless-flippase-mediated removal of the FRT-STOP-FRT cassette15. Note that sens-flp rarely expresses flippase in R7s.\nKeep the flies in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (LD) at 25 °C from the larva stage until eclosion (Figure 1A).\nCollect the flies 0 - 6 h after eclosion and place them into a new vial containing fly food.\nSet the vials into a transparent rack made of acrylic resin with three steps (a height of 41 cm, a base of 21 cm, a thickness of 4 cm and a height of 13 cm for each step) (Figure 1B).\nAdjust the distance between the rack and a LED panel to provide the illumination with an average intensity of 1,000 lux using a digital light meter (Figure 1C).\nKeep the flies for 1 - 3 d under one of the following conditions: constant darkness (DD), 12 h light/12 h dark cycle (LD), or constant light (LL) at 25 °C in a small incubator (Figures 1A and 1C).\n2. Dissection, Immunohistochemistry and Imaging\nDissect fly brains with forceps, fix them with 4% formaldehyde and immunostain with the primary antibody against Chaoptin (1:50) and a second antibody for visualization of photoreceptors based on previous experimental procedures25. Briefly:",
    "Prepare 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (0.1% PBT). This solution is used to improve antibody tissue penetration.\nAnesthetize flies on a CO2 pad, sort out the correct genotype and transfer them to a petri dish filled with 0.1% PBT.\nStick the forceps underneath the proboscis and pull off the right and left eyes respectively with the other forceps.\nRemove the proboscis and the trachea attached to the brain.\nTransfer the brain with the forceps into a 1.5 mL tube containing 150 µL of 0.1% PBT at RT.\nWithin 10 min repeat from 2.1.3 - 2.1.5 to obtain as many brains as possible.\nAdd 50 µL of 16% formaldehyde into the tube and mix by pipetting.\nIncubate the brains in fixative at room temperature for 50 min.\nWash three times with 200 µL of 0.1% PBT with a micropipette, paying attention to leave the brains in the tube.\nAfter the last wash, remove the 0.1% PBT and add the primary antibody solution, prepared as follows: add to 196 µL of 0.3% PBT (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) 4 µL of anti-Chaoptin antibody (final dilution 1:50) for visualization of photoreceptors.\nIncubate the brains in the primary antibody solution at 4 °C O/N.\nWash 3x with 200 µL of 0.1% PBT with a micropipette.\nAfter the last wash, remove the 0.1% PBT and add 200 µL of the 0.3% PBT containing a secondary antibody.\nIncubate it in the dark at 4 °C O/N.\nWash three times with 200 µL of 0.1% PBT with a micropipette.\nFor mounting, put two small drops (2 µL each) of a mounting medium with a micropipette at the center of a microscope slide at approximately 2 cm distance from each other.",
    "Place two coverslips, one onto each drop and leave a narrow gap between the coverslips of approximately 0.2 mm.\nPlace 15 µL of a mounting medium on top of the coverslip and add the brains with a micropipette into the mounting medium.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, position the brains with the ventral side up into the narrow gap between the two coverslips (Figure 2).\nPlace a coverslip on top and seal the edges of the coverslip using clear nail polish to fix the specimen (Figure 2).\nObtain images of the brains with a confocal microscope. Use a 63X oil immersion objective lens (1.4 N. A.) and a 2.6X digital zoom. Generate more than 20 optical sections of the second optic ganglion medulla with a step size of 0.5 µm.\n3. Generation of the Spots, Surface Objects, Start-points and End-points\nTo quantify the number, the distribution and the delocalization level of Brp-GFP puncta, open the stack obtained by confocal microscopy in image analysis software and reconstitute 3D images (Figure 3A). Note that the step in this study was performed with Imaris.\nIdentify the Brp-GFP puncta by the spot detection module for each R8 axon terminal.\n\t\nSelect \"Add new Spots\".\nSelect \"Segment only a Region of Interest\" in the algorithm settings. Select an R8 axon terminal in the medulla manually.\nSelect the source channel of the Brp-GFP signal.\n\t\tNOTE: The R7 and R8 photoreceptor axons were immunolabeled with anti-Chaoptin (Figure 3A). Only R8, though, contains Brp-GFP puncta and could thus be easily distinguished (Figure 3A). Further, the endpoint of R8 could be identified by the thinning of the anti-Chaoptin-positive axons at the entry point into the M3 medulla layer.\nSet the estimated XY diameter to 0.35 µm and check off \"Background subtraction\" in the spot detection.",
    "Select \"Quality\" in filter type and filter automatically. Then click finish.\nRepeat from 3.2.1 t- 3.2.5 for other R axons (Figure 3B).\nTo measure the delocalization level of Brp-GFP in R8 axons, generate surface objects with the \"Surface\" function for each axon (Figure 3C).\n\t\nSelect \"Add new Surfaces\".\nSelect \"Segment only a Region of Interest\" in the algorithm settings. Then select an R8 axon terminals in the medulla manually.\nSelect the source channel of the photoreceptors.\nCheck off \"Smooth\".\nSelect \"Absolute Intensity\" in the threshold.\nCheck \"Enable\". \"Seed Points Diameter\" is 0.5 µm.\nSelect filter Type \"Quality\" and \"Number of voxels\", and then filter automatically.\nGo to \"Edit\" and delete the pieces of surfaces generated on other non-interesting axons.\nRepeat from 3.3.1 - 3.3.8 for other R axons (Figure 3C). Note some surface objects were interrupted because of the thinness and the weak signal in photoreceptors at M2 layer, but they were still considered as a single object from start to end points.\nTo identify the distribution of Brp-GFP puncta along each neuron in the medulla neuropil, define the start-point and end-point with the measurement point function (Figure 3D).\n\t\nSelect \"Add new Measurement Points\". Then select \"Edit\" and select \"Surface of Object\" to intersect with the top of the surface objects.\nPut measurement points on top of surface objects of R axons in M1 layer in order. These are now defined as start-points (Figure 3D).\nSelect \"Add new Measurement Points\". Then select \"Edit\" and select \"Surface of Object\" to intersect with the bottom of the surface objects.\nPut measurement points on the bottom of the surface objects of R axons in M3 layer in order. These are now defined as end-points (Figure 3D).",
    "To subtract the background signal from the GFP channel, generate surface objects, spots, start-points and end-points for two R axons in M6 layer (Figure 3E).\n\t\nSelect \"Add new Surfaces\".\nSelect \"Segment only a Region of Interest\" in the algorithm settings. Then select a R7 axon terminal between M5 and M6 layer manually.\nSelect the source channel of the photoreceptor.\nCheck off \"Smooth\".\nSelect \"Absolute Intensity\" in the threshold.\nSelect filter Type \"Quality\" and \"Number of voxels\", then filter automatically.\nSelect \"Add new Spots\".\nSelect \"Skip automatic creation, edit manually\".\nSelect \"Center of Object\" and add a spot in the inner area of the surface object generated from 3.5.1 - 3.5.6.\nRepeat from 3.5.1 - 3.5.9 for another R7 axon terminal.\nSelect \"Add new Measurement Points\". Then select \"Edit\" and put measurement points on top of the two surface objects of the tip of the R7 axon terminal in M6 layer. These are now defined as start-points.\nSelect \"Add new Measurement Points\". Then select \"Edit\" and put measurement points on the bottom of the two surface objects of the tip of the R7 axon terminal in M6 layer. These are now defined as end-points (Figure 3E).\n4. Calculation of the Number of Spots, Distribution of the Spot Frequency and Level of Enrichment of Brp-GFP with a Customized Image Data Analysis Software\nCopy the file \"XtquantifySynapseSNR.m\" and the \"functions\" folder into the Imaris XT matlab folder. Note that the calculation in this study was performed with a customized plugin implemented in Matlab. Download the plugin from the website (https://github.com/cmohl2013/synapse_trafo[href=https://github.com/cmohl2013/synapse_trafo]).",
    "Open a dataset with n spots, n surfaces and 2 measurement point objects, each containing n measurement points (prepared from 3.1 - 3.4). The first measurement point object defines the start positions for all axons. The second measurement point object defines the end position of all axons. Both measurement point objects need to have the same number of measurement points (that is the number of axons).\nExecute image processing>>CUSTOM>atsushis synapse detection Vs 6.\nCheck metadata and change pixel sizes in image analysis software in case it is not correct.\nSelect channel for the performance of the intensity analysis of spots regions and cytoplasmic regions (the channel with Brp-GFP).\nDefine the filename for exporting the results.\nDefine the number of bins and axon length in percent. Enter the number of bins as \"10\" and range of bins as \"100%\" (Figures 4A and 4B).\nDefine the regions of the spots and the other cytoplasmic regions for the Brp-GFP delocalization analysis. Enter spots radius as \"0.35 µm\" and width of surrounding area as \"50 µm\". The spots radius defines the region for the puncta GFP signal (0.35 µm diameter, centered on one punctum). The width of surrounding area defines the region for the GFP signal in the cytoplasmic area (50 µm diameter, centered on the punctum, but including only R8 and excluding all spot areas in the cytoplasm) (Figures 4A and 4C).\nWait until all neuron masks are processed and exported as PDF files (Figures 4B and 4C) and a csv table for further analysis in a spreadsheet. The csv table includes the number of the spots, the average signal intensity in the \"cytoplasmic area\" and the maximum signal intensity in the \"spot\" in each bin for all R8 axons.\nOpen a dataset prepared in 3.5 for subtraction of the background signal.",
    "Perform the image processing as described from 4.3 - 4.9.\nCalculate the average of the total number and the distribution of the Brp-GFP puncta in a spreadsheet (Figures 4D and 4E).\nCalculate the average of the delocalization of Brp-GFP signal in a spreadsheet by the ratio of the average intensity in the \"cytoplasmic area\" divided by the maximum intensity in the \"spot\" subtracted by the average intensity in the background signal (Figure 4F).\nSubscription Required.
