    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the human research ethics board at the University of Alberta and conforms to the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Graded Exercise Test (VO2peak)\nObtain written, informed consent from the subject. Have the subject read and answer the questions listed on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire+ (PAR-Q+) to determine their readiness for exercise24.\nAdjust the seat height of the cycle ergometer in accordance to subject preference. Place four electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes on the back of the patient according to standard 3-lead ECG placement, with modified limb leads to measure the heart rate (HR)25.\nInsert the mouthpiece into the subject's mouth to measure the exhaled gas and ventilation throughout the test using a metabolic measurement system25.\n\tNOTE: The metabolic system will measure real-time oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), ventilation (VE), heart rate (HR), and end tidal CO2 (PETCO2).\nFollowing 2 min of collection of baseline data, instruct the subject to start cycling with an initial workload of 50 watt, to maintain a consistent cadence of  ≥60 RPM. Increase the workload in 25 W steps every 2 min, until the subject reaches volitional exhaustion or requests to stop the test25.\n2. Multiple Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FIO2 ) Diffusing Capacity (DLCO ) Method7\nCalculate the workloads corresponding to 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% of the VO2peak using the peak VO2 obtained in the graded exercise test. At least 48 h after the graded exercise test, have the subject return to the laboratory for DLCO maneuvers.\nDo not exceed 12 DLco tests per day, as carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) build-up can occur with repeated testing5. Therefore, perform testing on multiple days based on the number of exercise workloads to be conducted and the quality of the DLCO data.",
    "Prepare pre-breathing gases by attaching a tank of 100% O2 gas and a tank of medical-grade air (21% O2 and 79% N2) to an air blender system. Fill two 60 L non-diffusing Douglas bags, one containing 40% O2, and one containing 60% O2, using the air blender system.\nSet up two large-bore, three-way stopcock valves that will allow for the modulation of inhaled gas mixtures. These will be referred to as the \"pre-breath valves.\"\nConnect the Douglas bags to the valve system using flexible, non-compressible tubing. Connect the valve system to a two-way, T-shaped non-rebreathing valve connected to the test gas intake assembly of the mass flow sensor of the metabolic measurement system.\nFor resting measurements, have the subject seated upright, with both feet flat on the floor. For exercise trials, ensure that the subject is in a steady state by monitoring HR using the ECG (HR ± 3 bpm for steady state).\n\tNOTE: Steady state may not be reached at 90% of the VO2peak; thus, begin the measurement once the subject has reached the HR equivalent to 90% of the VO2peak on the graded exercise test.\nCollect a single drop of capillary blood via a finger prick and analyze it for hemoglobin concentration. Then, adjust all subsequent DLCO for [Hb] using the following equation26:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54949/54949equation1.jpg\nSelect an FIO2 (21%, 40%, or 60%) at random by switching the pre-breathe valves to the desired orientation. Choose the corresponding FIO2-DLCO gas by turning the DLCO gas valve selector (see Figure 1C).\nInstruct the subject to affix the nose clips and to breathe normally into the mouthpiece for five breaths from the Douglas bag corresponding to the respective FIO2.",
    "Instruct the subject to expire to residual volume. When the lung volume plateaus at residual volume, have the subject inhale the DLCO gas mixture to total lung capacity and hold their breath for 6 s before exhaling to residual volume.\nMonitor the methane tracing during the exhalation to ensure that the slope is horizontal, as this indicates that the CO test gas is well equilibrated in the lung.\n\tNOTE: Alveolar volume (VA) and breath hold time are calculated automatically and reported by the metabolic measurement system.\nEnsure that the VA for each DLco maneuver is within 5% of previous trials. Similarly, breath hold time should be 6.0 ± 0.3 s. If not, repeat the maneuver.\nWait 4 min to allow residual carbon monoxide to wash out, and then repeat steps 2.8 - 2.11 for each remaining FIO2 at rest.\nAt least 48 h later, repeat steps 2.9 - 2.15 during steady state at each exercise intensity (30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% of the VO2peak) for each FIO2. Reduce the workload between the breath holds at 90% of the VO2peak workload to recover the subject.\nWait 2 min between DLco tests during exercise to clear alveolar CO during exercise. Do not exceed 12 DLco tests per day to avoid carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) build-up5.\n3. Calculating Pulmonary Capillary Blood Volume and Membrane Diffusing Capacity\nCalculate the alveolar partial pressure of O2 (PAO2) using the following equation\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54949/54949equation2.jpg\n\tNOTE: FIO2 is the fraction of inspired O2, PBAR is the atmospheric pressure, PH2O is the water vapor pressure, PaCO2 is the pressure of arterial CO2, and RER is the respiratory exchange ratio.\nEstimate the RER and PaCO2 using the measured 30-s average PETCO2 and RER for the respective exercise intensity from the data obtained in the previous graded exercise test.",
    "Calculate θCO using the following equation7. imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54949/54949equation3.jpg\nGraph the relationship between 1/DLcoadj and 1/θCO for each FIO2 and calculate the regression equation.\n\tNOTE: The minimum acceptable r2 value is 0.95, and DLCO maneuvers should be repeated when r2 values are outside of this range21.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54949/54949fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Representative Graph of 1/DLCO versus 1/θCO at Peak Exercise. The relationship between 1/DLCO and 1/θCO is plotted for three breath holds at the various FIO2 (21%, 40%, and 60%). The calculation of Vc and Dm are derived from the regression equation for the relationship above. The inverse of the slope (1/0.00796) of the line gives the value for Vc (125.5 mL), and the inverse of the y-intercept (1/0.00869) gives the value for Dm (115.0 mL·min-1·mmHg-1).

Calculate Dm by taking the inverse of the y-intercept of the equation.\n4. Intrapulmonary Arteriovenous Anastomosis Recruitment\nOn a separate day from the DLCO data collection, insert a 20-gauge intravenous (IV) catheter into an antecubital vein and attach it to a three-way stopcock via a 6-in IV extension tube for the injection of agitated saline for contrast echocardiography11,17.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54949/54949fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Agitated Saline Contrast Setup. An IV catheter is placed in the antecubital space and is connected to a three-way stopcock via a 6-in extension. Two 10 mL syringes are attached to the stopcock to create the contrast solution, which contains 10 mL of saline and 0.5 mL of room air.

    "Connect two 10 mL syringes to the three-way stopcock. Combine 10 mL of 0.9% sterile saline with 0.5 mL of air, and forcefully agitate it through the three-way stopcock, back and forth between the two syringes, to form fine, suspended bubbles until the sonographer is ready for contrast.\nHave an experienced sonographer or cardiologist obtain a standard apical four-chamber view of the heart. At rest, have the echocardiographer evaluate the intra-atrial septum and ventricular septum for an intra-cardiac shunt with standard echocardiographic and color Doppler imaging.\n\t\nIf no intra-cardiac shunt is detected, instruct the subject to perform a Valsalva maneuver during the contrast injection to evaluate for a patent foramen ovale (PFO)11,17. Repeat the measurement during non-Valsalva.\nInject the contrast while the sonographer maintains the four-chamber view. Record 15 cardiac cycles following the detection of contrast in the right ventricle.\nRepeat the contrast-enhanced imaging during steady-state exercise at 30%, 50%, and 70% of the VO2peak. As steady state cannot be reached at 90% of the VO2peak, begin the imaging once the target HR, identified by the HR at 90% of the VO2peak during the graded exercise test, is reached.\n\tNOTE: The time between exercise intensities depends on the clearance of contrast from both ventricles, ≥ 2 min.\nHave an echocardiographer who is blinded to experimental conditions interpret the agitated saline contrast echocardiograms according to a previously-described scoring system17,27.\n\tNOTE: Scoring is based on the maximum number of contrast bubbles visible within the left ventricle (LV) in a single echocardiographic frame, as follows: no contrast bubbles in the LV = 0, ≤3 bubbles = 1, 4 - 12 bubbles = 2, > 12 bubbles = 3.",
    "NOTE: The appearance of contrast in the left ventricle after five cardiac cycles suggests an IPAVA. An intracardiac shunt is graded by the appearance of contrast in less than five cardiac cycles27.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54949/54949fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Representative Images for IPAVA Scoring. The scale is 5 cm (solid white line). (A) Pre contrast injection. (B) IPAVA score = 0. (C) IPAVA score = 1. (D) IPAVA score = 3.
