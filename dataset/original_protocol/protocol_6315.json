    "L929 cell conditional media preparationGrow L929 fibroblasts to confluency in two T75 flasks using L cell media (Recipe 9). Incubate at 37 °C 5% CO2 for approximately 2 days.Detach cells by removing existing media and adding 4 ml of TrypLE to flask.Incubate at 37 °C 5% CO2 for 5 mins or until cells are completely detached.Collect detached cells by adding 10 ml of L cells media to flask and transfer to 50 ml conical tube.Centrifuge at room temperature at 250-300 x g for 5 min to remove TrypLE from media. Re-suspend cells in L cell media.Count cells by adding 10 μl of trypan blue to 10 μl of cells. Add 10 μl of mixture to hemocytometer and count under light microscope. Plate cells at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells in 75 ml L cell media in T225 flasks.Rock flasks back and forth to get equal coverage of the entire flask bottom.Incubate at 37 °C 5% CO2 for 10-12 days (watch for cobblestone appearance of cells).Remove media from all of the flasks and place into 50 ml conical tubes.Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.To ensure thorough mixing of all collected media, combine all of the supernatants into one 50 ml conical tube.Vacuum filter media through a 250 ml filter unit.Aliquot 45 ml into 50 ml conical tubes.Transfer tubes to -20 °C for long-term storage. Thaw media at 37 °C when needed for bone marrow macrophage differentiation.Bone marrow derived macrophages preparation Note: Protocol can be performed using J774A.1 macrophage (ATCC® TIB-67), if bone marrow derived macrophages are unavailable. If performing EEA-1 staining, do not allow cells to fix for more than 7 min or antibody will not stain well. Euthanize mouse by CO2 and cervical dislocation in accordance with IACUC protocol.",
    "Remove femurs from mouse in a biosafety cabinet.Note: Keep bones intact and clean bones of any excess tissue. For each femur, cut each end using sterile scissors. Cut approximately 1 mm off of each head of the bone or until you see an opening large enough for a 26G needle.With forceps, hold the femur over a 50 ml conical tube.Prepare a 10 ml syringe with needle. Fill syringe with 10 ml of DMEM.Insert needle into the opening of the bone.Flush femur with 5 ml of DMEM into the 50 ml conical tube.Note: Be sure to stick the needle into each opening of the femur. If needle cannot enter the femur, cut more off of the end. Repeat Steps B6 and B7 with second femur.Filter the solution with a 40 μm cell strainer into a fresh 50 ml conical tube to remove clumps of tissue.Centrifuge cells at room temperature at 250-300 x g for 5 min.Remove media and gently resuspend pellet in residual media (approximately 1 ml).Add 1 ml of ACK lysis buffer (Recipe 2) and incubate for 60 s.Add 9 ml of DMEM.Centrifuge cells at room temperature at 250-300 x g for 5 min.Remove media and resuspend cells in approximately 10 ml of L cell differentiation media (Recipe 1 and Procedure A).Seed approximately 5 ml in 20 ml final volume of media into non-tissue culture treated Petri dish.Allow cells to differentiate in 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 6 days.Note: Ensure proper differentiation by checking morphology periodically. See Figure 1 for reference of proper differentiation (cells appear with elongated shape).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191118/20191118002003_4835.jpgFigure 1. Morphology of Day 5 differentiated BMDMs. Appearance of elongated shape as indicated by arrowheads. On Day 6, remove media from cells and wash cells by pipetting 10 ml of 1x DPBS (with Mg and Ca).",
    "Repeat wash 2 more times.Following final wash, add 3-4 ml/plate of 10 mM EDTA in 1x DPBS (without Mg and Ca), pH 7.2-7.4.Incubate plates at 37 °C for approximately 5 min or until cells begin to lift off.Add 5-8 ml/plate of DMEM with 10% FBS DMEM (Recipe 5) and transfer to a 15 ml conical tube.Centrifuge cells at room temperature at 250-300 x g for 5 min.Remove media and resuspend cells in 10 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS.Count cells using a hemocytometer.Note: Expect a cell count of 6 to 8 million cells per plate. Seed a 12-well tissue culture treated plate at 2 x 105 cells per well in a total volume of 1 ml per well.Note: For each sample, seed 1 well with a coverslip (recipient sample) and 1 well without a coverslip (donor cells). Incubate overnight at 37 °C 5% CO2.Transfer of cell permeable dyeNote: Wells should be set up with CFSE and CTR cells only (i.e. cells that do not have contact). Stain donor cells with Cell Trace CFSE (CFSE) at a final concentration of 5 μM in dPBS with Mg and Ca (500 μl per well) in a 12-well plate.Stain recipient cells with Cell Trace Far Red (CTR) at a final concentration of 1 μM in dPBS with Mg and Ca (500 μl per well) in a 12-well plate.Incubate cells at 37 °C 5% CO2 for 20 min.Wash cells 3 times each with 1 ml of pre-warmed 10% FBS DMEM.Note: 10% FBS DMEM should be pre-warmed in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min. After the final wash, pick up the coverslip with recipient cells and invert it onto the well with donor cells so that the cells are in direct contact.Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C 5% CO2.",
    "Remove the coverslip and return it into the original well in its original orientation.At desired time point, add 4% PFA to coverslip (1 ml per well) and incubate at room temperature for 7 min (for EEA-1 staining) or 10 min for other antibodies.Wash coverslips 3 times with 1 ml of 1x DPBS (with Mg and Ca). Perform desired microscopy staining (e.g., LAMP-1 [Steele et al., 2019]).Wash coverslips 3 times with 1 ml of 1x DPBS.Mount coverslips onto slides using mounting media by adding approximately 10 μl of mounting media to slides and inverting coverslip onto slide. Bacterial infectionNote: Various bacteria can be used for this assay with modifications needed for growth and infection conditions. Control wells should be set up with CFSE and CTR cells only. Streak out Francisella tularensis freezer stock on chocolate agar.Incubate plate at 37 °C for 3 days.Pick 4-6 individual colonies from the plate and suspend colonies in 3 ml of CDM.Incubate culture overnight at 37 °C in a shaking water bath.Next day, spin down 2 ml of culture at room temperature at 20,000 x g for 2 min.Remove the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml of PBS.Blank OD spec with 1 ml of PBS.Measure OD600 of culture (desired OD should be 0.34-0.36, if not incubation should continue).Infect donor cells at MOI 100 in 250 μl total volume of 10% FBS.Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C 5% CO2. Add 10 μg/ml of gentamicin in a total volume of 500 μl per well.Twenty hours following inoculation of bacteria, replace media on all samples.Invert coverslip of recipient cells onto donor cells to allow for direct contact.Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Remove the coverslip and put it into the original well in its original orientation.",
    "At desired time point, add 4% PFA to coverslip (1 ml per well) and incubate at room temperature for 7 min (for EEA-1 staining) or 10 min for other antibodies.Wash coverslips 3 times with 1 ml of 1x DPBS (with Mg and Ca). Perform desired microscopy staining (e.g., LAMP-1 [Steele et al., 2019])Wash coverslips 3 times with 1 ml of 1x DPBS.Mount coverslips onto slides using mounting media by adding approximately 10 uμl of mounting media to slides and inverting coverslip onto slide."
