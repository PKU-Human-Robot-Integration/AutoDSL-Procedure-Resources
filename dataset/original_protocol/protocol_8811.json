    "NOTE: All animal procedures performed in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Iowa.\n1. Long-term Identification of Mice Using Tattooing the Paw Pads\nImmobilize a paw with the paw pad (plantar surface) facing the experimenter. Hold the paw with the thumb and the index finger. Be careful not to pinch the paw.\n\tNOTE: Stable immobilization is important to ensure that the tattoo pigment is placed into the dermis of the paw pad, and thus is permanent 7.\nSwab the paw pad with 70% ethanol on a gauze sponge or swab.\nApply skin oil to a cotton-tipped applicator, and gently press the tip against the surface of the paw pad several times. Use only a small amount of skin oil; when present in large amounts, it will prevent the tattoo pigment from reaching the skin.\nDip the tips of the tattoo needles into the tattooing ink just prior to tattooing. Use clean, aseptic and sharp tattooing needles, to decrease the pain and the possibility of infection, and also to increase the tattooing efficiency.\nWhile the paw pad surface is covered with the skin oil, press the tattoo needle tips vertically and lightly against the skin in the center of the paw pad, and inject the ink multiple times. See Table of Materials/Equipment for information about electric tattooing system.\nSpray 70% ethanol on a gauze sponge, gently press it against the paw to remove extra tattoo pigment on the skin surface, and inspect the quality of tattoo. Check that the middle of paw pad has a dark, round spot that differs from normal skin pigmentation. If the tattoo is not dark or large enough for easy viewing, repeat the prior tattooing steps.\n2. Genotyping Newborn Mice Using a Fast PCR Genotyping Kit",
    "Disinfect the distal end of a mouse tail with 70% ethanol, cut 5 mm or less of the tail tip and transfer it to a tube of an 8-tube strip of the type used for PCR. Use an un-used razor blade for each pup to avoid cross contamination between specimens. Alternatively, use a pair of scissors, but in this case, carefully and thoroughly remove the remaining tissue on the blades using 70% ethanol. Check for bleeding. If bleeding occurs, apply pressure to the cut portion of the tail with a gauze sponge until bleeding has stopped.\nAdd 200 µl of DNA Extraction Solution to each PCR tube containing a specimen. See Table of Materials/Equipment for its composition and information about the kit.\nPlace the tube strip into a PCR thermal cycler, and start the DNA extraction using the following program: 1 cycle at 55 °C for 10 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and holding at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: This is the same PCR thermal cycler that is later used for PCR.\nAfter the DNA extraction is finished, remove the tube strip from the thermal cycler and invert 5 times.\nTransfer 4 µl of the solution (DNA extract) of each specimen to an un-used tube of an 8-tube strip, and mix with: 10 µl of 2X PCR Ready Mix II, 2 µl of mixed forward & reverse primers (recommended at 0.5 µM; see Table of Materials/Equipment for sequences), and 4 µl of nuclease-free H2O, for each specimen. Spin briefly (e.g., 3 sec) using a table-top centrifuge. Keep the tubes on ice at all times except when handling.\nPerform thermal cycling. See Table of Materials/Equipment for the thermal program.",
    "Detect the amplified DNA products. Load the total reaction solution from the PCR (20 µl) directly into a well of an agarose gel. Load the molecular weight markers into a separate well. Apply an electric field.\nAcquire fluorescence images of the bands under ultraviolet light.\n3. Primary Culture of Mouse Brain Neurons on Glial Feeder Layer\nNOTE: The procedures for brain dissection and cell dissociation (3.1) are common to all the subsequent procedures. The procedures for mouse glial cultures (3.2), rat glial cultures (3.3), and mouse neuronal cultures (3.4) are described separately afterwards.\nBrain Dissection and Cellular Dissocaiation\n\t\nSacrifice one mouse or rat pup by decapitation, rapidly remove the brain, and place it into Hanks' solution (see Table 1 for composition) + 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 35 mm dish (kept on ice).\nCut the brain through the midline into two hemispheres. Remove the region of interest(e.g., cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus) from each hemisphere of the brain. Remove the meninges and major blood vessels from the surface. Cut the brain region into 4-10 thin slices using a surgical blade.\nRinse the brain slices in a 15 ml centrifugation tube, once with Hanks' solution + 20% FBS, then 3 times with the Hanks' solution (i.e., without serum) (all at 4 °C). To rinse, add 5-10 ml solution, let the brain slices settle at the bottom of the tube, aspirate the solution from the top, and add a fresh solution. Finish the rinsing procedure by aspirating the solution.\nFilter 2 ml of the trypsin-containing digestion solution (see Table 1 for composition) using a 3 ml syringe and a 0.2 µm syringe filter, and add the filtrate directly into the tube containing the brain slices. Let the trypsinization proceed for 13 min at RT.",
    "Neutralize the trypsin solution first by aspirating most of it and then by adding 7-10 ml of Hanks' solution + 20% FBS (4 °C).\nRinse the brain slices, twice with Hanks' solution + 20% FBS, and then three times with the Hanks' solution (i.e. without serum) (all at 4 °C). Finish the rinsing procedure by aspirating the solution.\nFilter 2 ml of the dissociation solution (see Table 1 for composition) using a 3 ml syringe and a 0.2 μm syringe filter, and add the filtrate directly to the tube with the brain slices.\nMechanically dissociate the cells by gently triturating 10-20 times, until visible tissue pieces disappear. Use a cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipette and avoid making bubbles during trituration.\nWait 3 min for small pieces to settle down.\nTransfer the majority of the solution (~1.5 ml, leaving some solution at the bottom) to a 15 ml centrifugation tube that contains 3 ml Hanks' solution + 20% FBS solution (4 °C), using the cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Do not transfer all the solution because the inclusion of any sediment at the bottom typically results in deterioration of the culture.\nCentrifuge for 13 min at ~185 g (~1,100 rpm) at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant gently, add 1 ml of pre-warmed plating medium (37 °C) to the pellet, and resuspend it by gently pipetting several times using the cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: Three different types of plating media are used for different culture purposes: plating medium-1 for mouse glial cells, plating medium-2 for mouse neurons, and plating medium-3 for rat neurons and glial cells (see Table 1 for compositions).",
    "Take out 10 μl of the cell suspension, mix it with 10 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution, and measure the density of live cells, using either a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\nMouse Glial Cultures\n\t\nWash the coverslips to help establish healthy cultures of mouse cells.\n\t\t\nImmerse glass coverslips (round, 12 mm diameter) in 70% nitric acid in a glass Petri dish. Protect from light using aluminum foil, and place it on an orbital shaker O/N.\nRinse the glass coverslips in the Petri dish at least three times with distilled water. Immerse them in distilled water. Place the dish on an orbital shaker O/N.\nDry the coverslips on a Whatman 150 mm filter paper in the biological safety cabinet.\nAutoclave the coverslips.\nPlace the coverslips into 24-well culture dish.\nLabel and genotype newborn mice according to steps 1 and 2.\nObtain the brain cells from the mouse pups, according to step 3.1.\n\t\tNOTE: Use of the cerebral cortex is typical for preparing the mouse glial feeder layer. However, other brain regions, such as hippocampus and striatum, will work after proper adjustment of cell density due to different numbers and yields of cells from different regions.\nAdd ~4 ml of pre-warmed plating medium-1 to the final cell suspension (~1 ml). For pre-warming culture media, place the solution in the culture incubator (5% CO2-95% O2, 37 °C) O/N, to allow the temperature and pH values to stabilize.\nTransfer the cell suspension to an uncoated T25 culture flask, using the cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Place the flask in the culture incubator.",
    "At 1 day in vitro (DIV), rinse the cultured cells in the T25 flask twice with plating medium-1 (4 °C). Place the flask back into the incubator. Perform rinsing by aspirating the medium inside the flask completely with a Pasteur pipette, adding ~5 ml of fresh medium and gently tilting the flask several times in a swirling motion.\nAt 6-9 DIV, (i.e., one day before trypsinization and plating on coverslips, in steps 3.2.8-3.2.13), place 100 µl of the coating material with extracellular matrix proteins (see Table of Materials/Equipment for comments about the coating material) on the glass coverslips in a culture dish, and place the culture dish in the culture incubator.\nAt 7-10 DIV, when the cells are 20-40% confluent (spatially continuous), trypsinize them.\n\t\t\nRinse the flask once, by aspirating all the solution within the flask and adding ~13 ml of Hanks' solution (4 °C), gently tilt the flask several times in a swirling motion, and aspirate the solution completely.\nAdd 40 µl of DNase solution (final concentration, 750 units/ml) to 4 ml Trypsin-EDTA solution, pass the solution through a 0.2 µm syringe filter, and add the filtrate directly to the cells in the flask.\nLet the trypsinization proceed for 13 min at 37 °C in the incubator.\nNeutralize the trypsin solution by adding 2 ml of 100% FBS (4 °C) to the flask.\nTransfer the trypsinized cells to a 15 ml centrifugation tube using a 5- to 10-ml pipette, add ~4 ml of Hanks' solution + 20% FBS (4 °C), centrifuge at ~185 g and 4 °C for 13 min, and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 ml of pre-warmed plating medium-1.\nMeasure the density of the cells according to step 3.1.13.",
    "Aspirate the coating material completely from the glass coverslips, and plate ~50 μl of the resuspended glial cells on coverslips.\n\t\tNOTE: These cells will establish the glial feeder layer.\nPlace the culture dish with coverslips in the incubator.\n20-60 min later, add 1 ml of pre-warmed plating medium-1 to each well, and place the dish back in the incubator. Note: While the plating medium is added, it will be helpful to use another pipette to press down the periphery of the coverslip (where there are no plated cells), so that the coverslip will not float in the medium.\nAt 1 DIV of the glial feeder layer (i.e., on the glass coverslip), replace the medium with 1 ml of pre-warmed plating medium-1, by aspirating all of the solution in a well and then filling it with fresh medium.\nAt 2-3 DIV of the glial feeder layer when the cells are 80-100% confluent, add mitotic inhibitor (10 µl of a mixture of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine + uridine; final concentrations of 81.2 and 204.8 µM, respectively) to each well, to inhibit DNA replication and therefore to suppress glial-cell proliferation.\nAt 7-9 DIV, when the cells are 90-100% confluent (1-2 hr before plating neurons on the glial feeder layer), replace the culture medium with pre-warmed plating medium-2 (37 °C).\n\t\tNOTE: Neurons will be plated on the same day, using step 3.4.\nRat Glial Cultures\n\t\nCoat a T25 culture flask with the same coating material.\n\t\tNOTE: This is necessary for later removal of non-adherent cells in step 3.3.5.\n\t\t\nAdd 2.0 ml of the coating material to the flask, and place the flask in the culture incubator.\nAfter 2-3 hr, aspirate the coating material completely, such that the floor of the flask becomes dry.\nObtain the cells from the rat pups, according to step 3.1.",
    "NOTE: The CA3-CA1 region of the hippocampus is used for preparing the rat glial feeder layer. However, other brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex and striatum, will work after adjusting for differences in cell density due to different numbers and yields of cells from different regions.\nAdd ~4 ml of pre-warmed plating medium-3 to the final cell suspension (~1 ml).\nTransfer the cell suspension into the coated T25 culture flask, using the cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Place the flask in the culture incubator (5% CO2-95% O2, 37°C).\nAt 2-3 DIV, when cells are 20-40% confluent, remove non-adherent or weakly adherent cells, by closing the lid tightly, shaking the flask vigorously ~10 times, aspirating the solution, and adding 4-5 ml of plating medium-3 (at 4 °C). Repeat this procedure once. Examine the cultured cells across the entire flask floor (e.g., using phase-contrast microscope) to confirm that those that appear neuronal (i.e., those for which the outer rim of the cell body appears phase-bright) are completely removed. Repeat the procedure as often as necessary to remove these cells, and then return the flask to the incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: The strength and the total number of 'shakes' required may differ among individual experimenters. The important thing is not to keep the total number of shakes to a set number, but to confirm that neuron-like cells are eliminated.\nAt 6-8 DIV, when cells are 90-100% confluent, passage the glial cells by trypsinizing them as in step 3.2.8.\nAfter centrifugation, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of plating medium-3 (4 °C), add 10 ml of plating medium-3 (4 °C), transfer the trypsinized cells to an un-coated T75 flask, and culture them in the incubator.",
    "NOTE: Rat glial cells will be passaged twice; in contrast the mouse glial cells are passaged only once because they become unhealthy after multiple passages. Rat glial cells will be passaged in T75 flasks that are not coated with any coating material. The coating allows rat glial cells to grow too quickly and yield many ciliated cells (putative ependymal cells), which will deteriorate the neuronal culture condition later.\nAt 17-19 DIV of glial culture in a flask (i.e., 11 days after passaging and one day before trypsinization and plating onto coverslips by steps 3.3.9-3.3.14), place 100 µl of the coating material on unwashed glass coverslips (round, 12 mm diameter) in a culture dish, and place the culture dish in the culture incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: For rat glial cultures, a difference was not noticed in the culture results with or without washing the coverslips.\nAt 18-20 DIV of glial culture in a flask (i.e., 12 days after passaging), prepare the glial feeder layer by trypsinizing the cultured cells, according to step 3.2.8.\nDuring centrifugation, aspirate the coating material completely from the glass coverslips.\nAfter centrifugation, resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of plating medium-3 (4 °C), and measure the cell density, according to step 3.1.13.\nAdjust the glial density to 104 live cells/ml, and plate 100 µl of the glial cell suspension on the coated glass coverslips.\n\t\tNOTE: These cells will establish the glial feeder layer.\nPlace the culture dish with coverslips into the incubator for 20-60 min.\nAdd 1 ml of plating medium-3 (4 °C) to each well, and place the dish back in the incubator.",
    "At 3-4 DIV of the glial feeder layer, when the cells on the coverslip are 40-80% confluent, add 1 ml of the pre-warmed growth medium (see Table 1 for composition) that contains cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, final concentration of 4 µM) to stop glial-cell proliferation. Plate neurons at 7-9 DIV of the glial feeder layer when the cells are 60-80% confluent, using step 3.4.\nMouse Neuronal Cultures\n\t\nLabel and genotype newborn mice according to steps 1 and 2.\nUse the mouse pups for step 3.1.\nAdjust the density of live-cell suspension to ~2.0 x 105 cells/ml using pre-warmed plating medium-2 for plating on mouse glial cells, or using plating medium-3 for plating on rat glial cells.\nPlate the cells on the glial feeder layer, by gently adding the cell suspension to the culture medium of each well. Note: The volume of the cell suspension to be added will be determined by the target number of cells in a culture well. For example, plate ~60 µl of cell suspension to achieve 12,000 cells/well.\nNote that no solution changes are necessary after the neurons are plated. Be careful to avoid evaporation of the solution from the wells over the course of culture, by humidifying the inside of the culture incubator.\nSubscription Required.
