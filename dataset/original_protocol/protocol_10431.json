    "All animal protocols were pre-approved by the Stockholm County Committee on Animals and all procedures conformed to the regulations for animal use, as well as relevant federal statutes.\n1. Animal Procedures\nPreparing the Animal for Surgery\n\t\nPrepare the surgical table with all the materials and instruments needed for the operation under sterile conditions. Perform the surgery exclusively under sterile conditions to reduce the risk of infection and optimize the conditions in survival surgery.\nFast the animal for 12 hr prior to surgery and measure its weight. Administer an intramuscular injection of azaperone (2 mg/kg) for premedication. Anesthetize the animal with intramuscular injections of tiletamine hypochloride (2.5 mg/kg), zolazepam hypochloride (2.5 mg/kg), medetomidine (25 µg/kg) and atropine (25 µg/kg).\nInject phenobarbiturate (15 mg/kg) prior to endotracheal intubation and continue general anesthesia with 0.8%–2% isoflurane. Insert a peripheral vein catheter in one ear and infuse glucose (25 mg/ml) intravenously during the procedure to maintain the well-being of the animal.\nPlace monitoring devices on the ear or tail to check temperature, blood pressure, saturation, and peripheral pulse. Control anesthesia by pain stimulation of the ears or hooves. Apply ointment to eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nExcision of Bladder Biopsy Specimen\n\t\nCatheterize the bladder using a 10-French silicone catheter by introducing a speculum to view the urethra and insert the catheter through the urethra and into the urinary bladder to empty the urine under semi-sterile conditions. Fill the bladder with sterile saline solution to a pressure of 20–25 cm H2O, about 100–300 ml, and then empty to 20 cm H2O (approx. 8 ml/kg of body weight).\nWith the pig carefully turned to a side position, perform a basic preoperative sterilization of the skin with application of chlorhexidine gluconate. Apply a diathermy plate to the shoulder after removing the pelage with shaving shears.",
    "Turn the pig carefully into a supine position and remove the abdominal pelage using shaving shears and do a basic preoperative sterilization of the abdominal skin with application of chlorhexidine gluconate.\n\t\t\nEmbed the extremities with soft clothing to minimize the risk of hyperextension damage to the joints in the extremities. Sterilize the abdominal skin of the animal with successive applications of chlorhexidine gluconate and place sterile draping around the surgical field.\nPrior to skin incision, apply an intravenous analgesic consisting of buprenorphine (45 µg/kg), carprofen (3 mg/kg) and local injection of lidocaine in the midline below the umbilicus. Check for pain reaction by grasping the skin with forceps. Make a lower midline incision through the fascia and peritoneum using diathermy for control of bleeding. Localize the bladder that has a fully intraperitoneal position in the pig and can be freely exposed by mobilizing it through the surgical wound.\nTake hold of the bladder with the forceps and measure it with a sterilized measuring tape and mark an elliptic-shaped biopsy specimen approximately 2 cm longitudinally and 1 cm transversally, or smaller, using a sterilized pen (the pig tolerates a quarter reduction of bladder size very well). Excise the marked area, using a scalpel, and place the bladder biopsy specimen in DMEM under sterile conditions.\nPerform autotransplantation with the biotransplant or close the bladder by suturing it with 5-0 Vicryl in two layers. Close the abdominal fascia carefully with 2-0 or 3-0 running Vicryl. Close the subcutis with 3-0 Vicryl and the skin with 3-0 Ethilon. Place a dressing on the wound and carefully attend to the animal until it has recovered sufficiently from the anesthesia and does not express pain.",
    "Move the animal to the animal care facility to secure conditions for postoperative care. Put the animal in a single cage with a heating lamp and attend to the animal until full recovery from the anesthesia and then let the animals be stalled in pairs.\nProvide an uneventful recovery regarding pain and well-being and administer buprenorphine (45 µg/kg) intramuscularly for postoperative analgesia and trimetoprim (4 mg/kg) and sulfonamide (20 mg/kg) twice daily for three days and once daily for five days to reduce the risk of postoperative infections.\nExcision of Skin Biopsy Specimen\n\t\nPrepare the surgical table with all the necessary materials. Anesthetize the animal as previously described in 1.1. Remove the pelage using wax, wash and sterilize the incision area with betadine and 70% alcohol and then place sterile draping around the incision area.\nUse a dermatome to harvest a 0.3 mm partial thickness skin biopsy specimen. Place the skin specimen in DMEM before mincing, as described in 2.2. Cover the wound area with fatty ointment and a dressing.\n2. Minced Tissue Preparation\nBladder Mucosa\n\t\nWash the bladder biopsy twice in DMEM. Place the bladder biopsy specimen onto a sterilized dissecting plate with the mucosa facing upwards and fix one of the sides to the plate using dissection pins.\nSeparate the mucosal tissue from the detrusor muscle using fine scissors and forceps (Figure 3) and keep the mucosa moist by dripping saline or DMEM over it.\nUse the mincing device by placing it on the mucosa and then pass the device from one end to the other vertically and horizontally, applying manual pressure to obtain pieces of minced tissue of 0.8 mm x 0.8 mm (0.8 mm is the distance between the rotating cutting blades).\nSkin",
    "If the skin biopsis are thick: place the skin onto a sterile dissecting plate and use surgical scissors to separate the epidermis from subcutaneous fat and dermis. The epidermis is thin and translucent (approx. 0.3 mm) when it is ready for mincing.\nUse the mincing device by placing it on the epidermis. With pressure, pass the device from one end to the other vertically and horizontally to obtain pieces of minced tissue of 0.8 mm x 0.8 mm.\n3. Preparation of Plastic Compressed PCL/Collagen Autografts\nPlace all ingredients on ice to keep cold. Utensils needed: Falcon tube, 10x DMEM, 1x DMEM, 1 N NaOH and rat tail collagen type 1.\n\t\nMix 2 ml of 10x DMEM (carefully to avoid bubbles) with 12 ml of collagen type 1. Add 1 N NaOH, drop by drop, to bring pH up to 7.4–8 (color in the medium should indicate the pH by changing from intense yellow to pink). In addition, use a pH strip.\nCarefully add 2 ml of 1x DMEM and mix the solution. Plate approximately 2 ml of collagen in each well of the steel rectangular mold (20x30x10 mm) and incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of collagen should be 2.06 mg/ml in 0.6% acetic acid and the amount of collagen 1 ml/cm2.\nOnce the collagen sets into the mold, place the biomaterial (PCL) on top of the collagen gel (20 mm x 30 mm) and pour the remaining collagen (about 6 ml) on top of it. Incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 20 min.\nPlace the minced tissue (for 1:6 expansion) on the top of collagen gel. Press the water out of the construct by mechanical force using plastic compression as follows (Figures 3 and 4).",
    "Place a thick layer of gauze pads on a sterile surface. Place one stainless steel mesh (400 µm thick) on top of the gauze pads and then a sheet of nylon mesh (110 µm thick). Carefully transfer the collagen gel/minced tissue onto the nylon mesh and carefully remove the rectangular steel mold.\nPlace a new layer of nylon mesh on top of the collagen gel/minced tissue. Place a second steel mesh on top of the nylon mesh. Place in position the pressure or loading plate weighing a minimum of 120 g (i.e., a glass plate) for 5 min.\nRemove the weight, nylon, and steel meshes. The autografts are now ready to be sutured to the pig bladder in the full-thickness skin wounds or cultured in vitro.\nFor in vitro culturing, cut the thin construct into small pieces fitting 12-well plates. Add 1 ml of keratinocyte medium. Place the plates in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and culture up to 6 weeks and change the medium 3 times per week.\n4. Suture of Autografts\nSuture of autograft with minced bladder mucosa to the pig bladder\n\t\nKeep the autograft moist in DMEM during the waiting time. Suture the autograft with fine running monofilament sutures. Use non-absorbable 5-0 Ethilon for research purposes.\nCheck if watertight by filling the bladder with saline through the indwelling urinary catheter. If possible, cover the autograft with a layer of greater omentum. Close the abdominal wall, subcutaneous tissue, and skin as described in 1.2.6. Apply a wound dressing.\nSuture of the Autograft with Minced Skin Epidermis to a Full-thickness Wound\n\t\nKeep the autograft moist in DMEM during the waiting time.",
    "Suture the autograft to the bottom of the skin full-thickness wound by interrupted sutures in the corners and in the middle of the autograft to keep the autograft closely attached to the underlying surface.\nCover the wound with a plastic dressing that keeps the wound moist.\n5. Termination\nSedate the animal with intramuscular injection of zolazepam hypochloride (2.5 mg/kg) and medetomidine (25 µg/kg) prior to termination and apply monitoring devices to the ear or tail to check for pulse and blood pressure.\nEuthanize the animal by administering a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium (60-140 mg/kg) intravenously. Check pulse and blood pressure until death has occurred.\n6.  In Vitro Culture\nNOTE: To evaluate histologically the progression of the minced tissue in the PCL/collagen constructs in vitro, the collagen/PCL/minced patches are cultured in 12-well plates using keratinocyte medium.\nPreparation of keratinocyte medium:\n\t\nSterilize a 500 ml glass bottle.\nMix 400 ml of DMEM with 100 ml of Ham’s F12 (4:1 mixture). Supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 µg/ml insulin, 0.4 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 21 µg/ml adenine, 10-10 mol/L cholera toxin, 2 x 10-9 mol/L triiodothyronine, 5 µg/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin.\nSterilize by filtrating through a 0.2 μm filter and collect the filtrate in the sterile 500 ml bottle.\n7. Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: The immunohistochemistry protocol is generally divided into the following steps: (1) fixation and paraffin embedding, (2) micro-sectioning to 5 µm slices, placement on slides, deparaffination, and rehydration, (3) antigen unmasking, staining and mounting. Before starting the last steps in the immunohistochemistry procedure, prepare the washing buffers and the antigen unmasking solution (see separate material details). Prepare the ABC complex solution at least 30 min before use.\nFixation\n\tNOTE: At the end of the in vitro culture, fix the patches as follows:",
    "Prepare Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of 4% buffered formaldehyde (PFA) (Caution: formaldehyde is toxic. Please read material safety data sheets before working with this chemical. Wear gloves and safety glasses and prepare the solution inside a fume hood).\nTransfer each of the collagen patches to an Eppendorf tube containing 4% PFA. Fix over night at room temperature.\nPlace samples in 70% ethanol for long-term storage at 4 °C. Samples are now ready for dehydration and embedding in paraffin blocks before sectioning.\nRehydration\n\t\nPlace the slides in a staining jar with X-tra solv for 15 min. Repeat by using a new staining jar with X-tra solv. Place the slides in a staining jar with absolute ethanol for 10 min. Repeat by using a new staining jar with absolute ethanol. Place the slides in a staining jar with 95% ethanol for 10 min and thereafter into a staining jar with 70% ethanol for 10 min. Finally wash the slides twice for 5 min with distilled water.\nAntigen Unmasking\n\t\nPut slides in a Coplin jar with TE-solution and put the jar in a water bath to boil for 20 min. Take the jar out of the water bath carefully. Cool the slides to room temperature for 30 min and wash twice for 5 min in Tris buffer. Place the slides in a staining jar with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Wash the slides twice for 5 min in Tris buffer. Draw a circle around the samples using a water repellent marking pen.\nBlock nonspecific binding of the antibody using 100–300 µl of blocking solution. Remove the blocking solution and add 100–300 µl of primary antibody dissolved at the recommended concentration in Tris buffer. Incubate overnight. Remove the antibody solution and wash sections in Tris buffer twice for 5 min.",
    "Incubate with the secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. Wash twice for 5 min in Tris buffer. Incubate 30 min using the ABC Elite Kit (follow the manufacturer’s instructions). Wash twice in Tris buffer.\nDevelop antibody reaction by using the Vector VIP Kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (1–7 min incubation generally produces a clear violet intensity). Put the slides in distilled water. Counterstain with Mayer’s hematoxylin for 30 sec.\nWash in running water for 5 min. Place the slides in a staining jar with 70% ethanol for 1 min. Repeat by using a new staining jar with 70% ethanol. Place the slides in a staining jar with 95% ethanol for 1 min. Repeat by using a new staining jar with 95% ethanol.\nPlace the slides in a staining jar with X-tra solv for 5 min. Remove, one at a time to keep moist. Place a drop of mounting medium on top of each slide and put a cover glass on top (do so carefully to avoid air bubbles). Let the slides dry overnight and view slides under a microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
