    "Streptozotocin (STZ) is a highly selective pancreatic islet β-cell-cytotoxic agent that is often administered at a single high dose to cause, within 48 hr, complete β-cell necrosis and diabetes (Kolb, 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0025]; also see Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-prot-0002]). However, after administering multiple, low doses of STZ to mice for 5 days, Like and Rossini (1976[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0030]) noted a delayed onset of hyperglycemia which, for kinetic reasons, could not be due to a direct, rapid, toxic action of the drug. This multiple, low-dose STZ approach only partially damages pancreatic islets, triggering an inflammatory process that causes the further loss of β-cell activity that ultimately results in insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. This response more closely resembles T1DM in pathogenesis and morphologic changes than the single, high-dose STZ protocol (Kolb, 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0025]; Kolb-Bachofen, Epstein, Kiesel, & Kolb, 1988[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0026]; Like & Rossini, 1976[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0030]; Weide & Lacy, 1991[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0048]). The multiple, low-dose STZ approach is now widely used to produce an animal model of T1DM (Wu & Huan, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0050]).\nUsing this protocol, diabetes is induced by the administration of multiple, low doses of STZ (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) to mice on 5 consecutive days. The model is used for testing the effectiveness of potential antidiabetic agents. Screening assays can entail administration of the test agent prior to and/or following induction of diabetes, depending on study objectives.\nMaterials\nC57BL/6 or CD-1 male mice: ∼25 g, 8 to 12 weeks old (Jackson Laboratory or Taconic); 12 to 20 animals per treatment group are recommended; Balb/cJ mice are resistant to the induction of diabetes using this treatment regimen (see Zunino, Simons, Sambrook, & Gething, 1994[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0054]).\nStandard rodent chow diet (Harlan)\n50 mM sodium citrate buffer (enzyme-grade; Fisher), pH 4.5: prepared immediately before use\nStreptozotocin (STZ; Sigma)\n10% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma): prepared just before use\nTest compound(s)\nRodent cages\nTemperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled housing",

At least 5 days prior to initiating the experiment, house two to five male mice per cage at 24°C ± 1°C and 55% ± 5% humidity, with a 12-hr light-dark cycle (light on at 8:00 and off at 20:00). Allow the mice free access to food and water.\nBecause female mice are less sensitive to this islet-cell toxin, most STZ-induced diabetic mouse studies are conducted on male animals (Kolb, 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0025]).\nWhile the protocol detailed below is designed to minimize variability, group sizes of 12 to 20 are recommended given the morbidity associated with the STZ treatment.\n2. Weigh all mice accurately to 1 g and randomly divide them into control and experimental groups.\nThe number of mice should be equal for each group.\n3. On experimental day 1, 4 hr prior to STZ treatment, remove all food from cages for all groups. Provide water as normal.\nTreat animals with STZ\n4. Weigh 4 mg of STZ into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and cover the tubes with aluminum foil; use one tube for three mice. Prepare the citrate buffer.\n5. Immediately prior to injection, dissolve the STZ in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml.\nBecause STZ degrades within 15 to 20 min after dissolving in the citrate buffer, the STZ solution should be prepared immediately before use and injected within 5 min of dissolution.",
    "6. Using 1-ml syringes and 25-G needles, inject the STZ solution i.p. (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0012]) at 40 mg/kg (1.0 ml/100 g) in the experimental group animals. Inject an equal volume of citrate buffer (pH 4.5) i.p. into the control group mice.\nThe responses to intravenous (i.v.) and i.p. injections of STZ are equivalent (Like & Rossini, 1976[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0030]).\n7. Return the mice to their home cages. Provide free access to normal food and 10% sucrose water.\n8. Repeat steps 3 to 7 on days 2 to 5 (the next four consecutive days).\n9. On experimental day 6, replace the 10% sucrose water with regular water.\n10a. For studies involving early-stage T1DM: On experimental day 14 (9 days after the last STZ injection), fast all mice for 6 hr (e.g., from 7:00-13:00). Analyze blood glucose from a tail-vein blood sample (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013]) using a One Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system to ensure hyperglycemia in the STZ-treated subjects.\nIf the diabetic animals are for studying early-stage mechanisms of T1DM or for screening compounds for early treatment of diabetes, the animals are considered suitable for study when the blood glucose concentrations of the STZ-injected mice is >150 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/L) and/or statistically higher than in the control mice. Step 10b can be omitted if STZ-injected mice meet these criteria prior to experimental day 28.\nIf <40% of mice in the STZ-injected group attain a diabetic state by day 14, re-test blood glucose concentrations as in step 10b.\nAs blood glucose concentrations are considered an accurate diagnostic tool for diabetes, there is generally no need to measure blood insulin concentrations.",
    "10b. For re-test of animals failing the first test for diabetes and for studies involving later-stage T1DM: On experimental day 28, fast all mice for 6 hr (e.g., from 7:00-13:00). Quantify blood glucose from a tail-vein blood sample (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013]) using a One Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system to confirm STZ injection-induced hyperglycemia.\nFasting glucose concentrations for mild hyperglycemia should be >150 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/L) and/or be significantly higher in the STZ-injected mice as compared to the control mice.\nSevere diabetes usually develops in ∼50% of mice ∼3 weeks after STZ injection, with blood glucose concentrations typically in the >300 to 600 mg/dl (16.7 to 33.3 mmol/L) range.\nIf >60% of STZ-injected mice still fail to exhibit mild hyperglycemia by week 4, a second round of STZ injection should be initiated at week 7 by repeating steps 3 to 8, plus step 10a. For the second round of STZ, there is no need to provide the animals with 10% sucrose water, as the incidence of fatal hypoglycemia is much lower than with the first exposure.\nA blood glucose concentrations of 18 mg/dl = 1 mM (Hartnell, Storrie, & Mooradian, 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0021]).\n11a. To examine a test agent for its ability to correct diabetes or affect hyperglycemia: Begin treatment with a test hypoglycemic agent once the diabetic state is established as defined in step 10. Include groups that receive appropriate vehicle injections as a control. Maintain the duration of treatment with test substance according to the experimental design.\n11b. To study a chronic condition or diabetic complications: Repeat, at week 7, steps 3 to 8, omitting the 10% sucrose water, to maintain hyperglycemia in the STZ-treatment group (Kunjathoor, Wilson, & LeBoeuf, 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0027]).",

Mice were treated with STZ (40 mg/kg) or without STZ (vehicle control) for 5 consecutive days. Typical changes in insulin secretion and blood glucose concentrations are illustrated.",
    "A single, high dose of STZ (200 mg/kg) is directly toxic to pancreatic β-cells, rapidly causing diabetes, with blood glucose concentrations of >500 mg/dl within 48 hr (Like & Rossini, 1976[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0030]). Although multiple, low doses of STZ are associated with fewer toxic effects than a single, high dose of STZ, many investigators still prefer the single high-dose STZ approach for generating diabetic animals.\nFor materials, see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-prot-0001].\nPrepare animals\n1. At least 5 days prior to the initiating the experiment, house two to five male mice per cage at 24°C ± 1°C and 55% ± 5% humidity, with a 12-hr light-dark cycle (light on at 8:00 and off at 20:00) with free access to food and water.\nBecause female mice are less sensitive to this islet-cell toxin, most STZ-induced diabetic mouse studies are conducted on male animals (Kolb, 1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0025]).\nWhile the protocol detailed below is designed to minimize variability, group sizes of 12 to 20 are recommended given the morbidity associated with the STZ treatment.\n2. Weigh all mice accurately to 1 g and randomly divide them into control and experimental groups.\nThe number of mice should be equal for each group.\n3. On experimental day 1, 4 hr prior to STZ treatment, remove food from all animal cages. Provide water as normal.\nTreat animals with STZ\n4. Immediately prior to injection, dissolve the STZ in sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml.\nThe STZ solution should be prepared fresh immediately before injection and injected within 5 min of being dissolved. Note the higher dose used for this method as compared to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-prot-0001].",
    "5. Inject STZ i.p. (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0012]) into the experimental animals at 200 mg/kg (1.0 ml/100 g). Inject an equal volume of citrate buffer (pH 4.5) i.p. into the control group mice.\n6. Return the mice to their cages. Provide normal food and 10% sucrose water and closely monitor the mice every 2 hr for 12 hr for marked hypoactivity, unresponsiveness, or convulsions.\nSome mice will die soon after (within 24 hr) receiving a high dose of STZ due to the rapid and massive β-cell necrosis that results in the release of large quantities of insulin, causing fatal hypoglycemia. If the number of early deaths is >20%, inject the remaining mice i.p. within 6 hr of the STZ treatment with 1 ml of 5% glucose solution instead of providing 10% sucrose water for drinking, to prevent fatal hypoglycemia (Huang & Wu, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0022]).\n7. On experimental day 3, replace the 10% sucrose water with regular water.\n8a. For studies involving early-stage T1DM: On experimental day 10, fast all mice for 6 hr (e.g., from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.), then measure blood glucose via a tail-vein blood sample (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013]) using a One Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system to ensure hyperglycemia.\nIf the diabetic animals are to be used for assessing early-stage mechanisms of T1DM or for screening drug candidates for treating diabetes, the animals can be employed once hyperglycemia is established or the blood glucose concentrations are statistically higher in the STZ-treated subjects than in controls. In this case, skip step 8b. Skip step 8a if the diabetic animals are not for early-stage assessment of T1DM mechanisms or for screening drug candidates as early treatments for this condition.",
    "If <40% of the STZ-injected mice become diabetic, retest blood glucose concentrations as described in step 8b.\nAs blood glucose concentrations are considered an accurate diagnostic tool for diabetes, there is generally no need to measure blood insulin concentrations.\n8b. For re-test of groups failing the first test for diabetes or for studies involving later-stage T1DM: On experimental day 21, fast all mice for 6 hr (e.g., from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.). Test the blood glucose concentration in a tail-vein blood sample (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013]) using a One Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system to confirm that the STZ treatment induced hyperglycemia.\nFasting glucose concentrations for mild hyperglycemia should be >150 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/L) and/or be significantly higher in the STZ-injected mice than in the control subjects.\nUsually at week 3, most STZ-injected mice develop severe diabetes with blood glucose concentrations in the range of >300 to 600 mg/dl (16.7 to 33.3 mmol/L).\nIf >60% of the STZ-injected mice still fail to exhibit mild hyperglycemia, determine whether there are problems with the experimental procedure (see Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting), or use the multiple low-dose STZ approach (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-prot-0001]).\nA blood glucose concentrations of 18 mg/dl = 1 mM (Hartnell et al., 1990[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0021]).\n9a. To examine a test agent for its ability to correct diabetes or affect hyperglycemia: Once the diabetic state is confirmed as specified in step 8, treat the animals with a test anti-hyperglycemic agent. Include as controls animals that receive appropriate vehicle injections.",
    "The duration of the injection and screening period for any given test agents will depend on the question being examined and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the test agent being evaluated. At a minimum, preliminary (PK) data should be determined, including the half-life and bioavailability, to ensure that a quantifiable amount of the test agent is present in the plasma over the period of evaluation. An absence of PK information leaves open questions about the availability of the compound in vivo and its relationship to the measured biological response, and can limit the value of the experimental protocol.\n9b. To study a chronic condition or diabetic complications: Extend the protocol longer, depending on the experimental needs.\nThe length of the experiment depends on the aims of the investigation, e.g., from several days for acute studies to several weeks for studies on diabetic complications.\nShown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-fig-0002] are some characteristics of a typical mouse diabetic state 3 weeks after injection of a single, high dose of STZ.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5b2e8adc-e182-4c2a-9c2a-a79f8e4c431d/cpz178-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nA single, high dose of STZ causes diabetes in mice (n = 20).

    "The rat is commonly used as an STZ-induced diabetic model. As in the mouse, the production of a diabetic state in rats is dependent on the dose of STZ (Arison, Ciaccio, Glitzer, Cassaro, & Pruss, 1967[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0001]; Ganda, Rossini, & Like, 1976[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0016]; Junod et al., 1969[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0023]). The most frequently used procedure is to administer one dose of STZ (40 to 70 mg/kg) to rats aged 8 to 10 weeks (Brondum, Nilsson, & Aalkjaer, 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0005]). Many investigators use a single dose of approximately 65 mg/kg to establish diabetes using the procedure described in this protocol.\nThis protocol describes administration of a single dose of STZ (65 mg/kg, i.p.) to rats to generate a T1DM state. The diabetic rats can be used to study the pathogenesis of T1DM, as well as to evaluate antidiabetic agents (Bond, Failla, & Unger, 1983[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0002]).\nMaterials\nSprague-Dawley or Wistar male rats: 150 to 200 g, 8 to 10 weeks old (Charles River Breeding Laboratories); 10 to 16 per treatment group recommended\nStandard rodent chow diet (Harlan)\n50 mM sodium citrate buffer (enzyme grade; Fisher), pH 4.5: prepared just before use\nStreptozotocin (STZ; Sigma)\n10% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma): prepared just before use\nTest compound(s)\nRodent cages\nTemperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled housing\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nAluminum foil\n1-ml syringes\n23-G needles\nOne Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system (Lifescan)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for injection of rats (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0012]), blood collection from rats (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013]), and anesthesia of rats (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0011])\nPrepare animals",

These high numbers per group will allow for the anticipated morbidity and variance. Usually >80% of STZ-injected rats develop diabetes in an experiment.\n2.

The dorsal vein of the penis or saphenous vein can be used. Intravenous injection increases the success rate for the induction of diabetes. Anesthesia is not required for intraperitoneal injection.\n7. Return the rats to their cages. Provide normal food and 10% sucrose water.\n8.

This regimen produces a model of insulin-deficient, but not insulin-resistant, T2D, characterized by stable, moderate hyperglycemia, associated with 60% loss of β-cell function (Ghasemi et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0018]; Masiello et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0036]).\nMaterials\nSprague-Dawley or Wistar male rats: 150 to 200 g, 8 to 10 weeks old (Charles River Breeding Laboratories); 10 to 16 per treatment group, recommended\nStandard rodent chow diet (Harlan)\nNicotinamide (Sigma)\n0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride\n50 mM sodium citrate buffer (enzyme-grade; Fisher), pH 4.5: prepared immediately before use\nStreptozotocin (STZ; Sigma)\nTest compound(s)\nRodent cages\nTemperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled housing\n1-ml syringes\n23- and 25-G needles\nOne Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system (Lifescan)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for injection of rats (Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0012]), blood collection from rats (Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013]), and anesthesia of rats (Donovan & Brown, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0011])\nPrepare animals\n1. At least 5 days prior to the start of the experiment, house two to five male rats per cage at 24°C ± 1°C and 55% ± 5% humidity, with a 12-hr light-dark cycle (light on at 8:00 and off at 20:00). Allow the rats to have free access to food and water.\nMales are generally preferred for these studies, as female rats are less sensitive to STZ.\nWhile the protocol is designed to minimize variability, it is recommended that group sizes number 10 to 16 animals each. This allows for the morbidity and variance generally associated with these studies. Usually >80% of STZ-injected rats develop diabetes under this protocol.",
    "2. Weigh all rats accurately to 1 g, and randomly divide them into control and experimental groups.\nThe number of rats should be the same in each group.\n3. On experimental day 1, fast all rats for 6 to 8 hr (from 7:00 to 13:00-15:00) prior to STZ treatment. Provide water as normal.\nInduce diabetes with STZ and nicotinamide\n4. Dissolve nicotinamide in 0.9% sodium chloride solution to a concentration of 230 mg/ml.\n5. Weigh 32.5 mg STZ into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and cover the tube with aluminum foil; use one tube for each rat. Prepare the citrate buffer.\n6. Using a 1-ml syringe and a 23-G needle, inject nicotinamide i.p. (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0012]) at a dose of 230 mg/kg (1.0 ml/kg).\nThe nicotinamide injection must be made 15 min before the i.v. administration of streptozotocin.\n7. Immediately prior to injection, dissolve STZ in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, (pH 4.5 (see step 5), to a final concentration of 32.5 mg/ml.\nThe STZ solution should be prepared fresh for each injection and administered within 5 min of dissolution.\n8. Using a 1-ml syringe and 25-G needle, inject the STZ solution i.v. (Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0012]) at 65 mg/kg (2.0 ml/kg) for the experimental group. The control animals receive an i.v. injection of an equal volume of citrate buffer (pH 4.5) only.\nIntravenous injections should be performed while the animal is anesthetized with a short-acting agent such as isoflurane or some other inhalation anesthetic (Donovan & Brown, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0011]). The dorsal vein of the penis or saphenous vein can be used.\n9. Return the rats to their cages. Provide normal food and drinking water.",
    "10. At around 8:00 a.m. on experimental day 10, test the blood glucose concentrations from a tail vein blood sample (Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013]) using a One Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system.\nWhile the blood glucose concentrations should be >150 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/L), large inter-laboratory variation has been reported (Ghasemi et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0018]). For this reason, every laboratory must set its own criterion, although animals with a blood glucose concentration of less than 150 mg/dl would be excluded. Masiello (2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0035]) reports that, using this procedure, 75% to 80% of animals develop moderate non-fasting hyperglycemia, with the remaining animals either becoming severely hyperglycemic at 2 to 3 weeks or remaining normoglycemic but with impaired glucose tolerance. The same protocol can be used for mice. The dose of STZ and the time between administration of nicotinamide and STZ are critical. Insulin deficiency will be greater if the dose of STZ is too high or the time delay between the administration of nicotinamide and STZ is too long.\nTreat animals with test agent(s)\n11. If a test agent is being assessed for its ability to correct hyperglycemia, the diabetic animals can usually be maintained for several weeks. For testing of drug candidates, treat animals as described in steps 3 to 11 to establish the diabetic state and with the candidate drug, with vehicle injections in control subjects.",
    "While the nicotinamide-STZ rat or mouse provides a model for insulin-deficient T2D, most patients with T2D display insulin resistance in addition to impaired insulin secretion. A model with these characteristics is created by administering moderate doses of STZ to animals rendered insulin resistant by prior consumption of a high-fat diet. This produces hyperglycemia, associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (Reed et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0040]).\nMaterials\nSprague-Dawley or Wistar male rats: 150 to 200 g, 8 to 10 weeks old (Charles River Breeding Laboratories); 10 to 16 per treatment group\nA high-fat diet: 60% fat by caloric content (D12492 diet; Research Diets, http://www.researchdiets.com/opensource-diets/diet-induced-disease-models/obesity[href=http://www.researchdiets.com/opensource-diets/diet-induced-disease-models/obesity])\nA low-fat diet from the same supplier for control animals (with the only difference between the diets being the % of the caloric intake provided by fat)\n50 mM sodium citrate buffer (enzyme grade; Fisher), pH 4.5: prepared immediately before use\nStreptozotocin (STZ; Sigma)\nTest compound(s)\nRodent cages\nTemperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled housing\n1-ml syringes\n23-G needles\nOne Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system (Lifescan)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for injection of rats (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0012]) and blood collection from rats (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013])\nPrepare animals\n1. At least 5 days prior to initiating the experiment, house two to four male rats per cage at 24°C ± 1°C and 55% ± 5% humidity, with a 12-hr light-dark cycle (light on at 8:00 a.m. and off at 8:00 p.m.). Allow free access to food and water.\nWhile the protocol is designed to minimize variability, it is recommended that groups number 10 to 16 animals each. This allows for the morbidity and variance generally associated with these studies. Usually >80% of STZ-injected rats develop diabetes under this protocol.",
    "2. Weigh all rats accurately to 1 g and randomly divide them into control and experimental groups.\nThe number of rats must be the same for each group.\n3. Place rats on the high-fat diet for 3 weeks.\nThe recommended diet provides 60% of its calorific value as fat; a commercial balanced diet should be used (for example, diet D12492, Research Diets, New Jersey, USA), rather than adding fat to a standard diet (Gheibi, Kashfi, & Ghasemi, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0019]). If one aim of the study is to compare the effects of STZ plus the HFD with STZ alone, include a group of controls that receive a low-fat laboratory chow diet from the same vendor.\n4. On day 22, fast all rats for 6 to 8 hr (from 7:00 a.m. until 1:00-3:00 p.m.) prior to STZ treatment. Provide water as normal. Treat animals with STZ.\n5. Weigh 40 mg STZ into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and cover the tube with aluminum foil. Prepare the citrate buffer.\n6. Immediately prior to injection, dissolve STZ in the 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) to a final concentration of 40 mg/ml.\nThe STZ solution should be prepared immediately before injection and administered within 5 min of dissolution.\n7. Using a 1-ml syringe and 23-G needle, inject STZ i.p. (see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0012]) into the experimental group at 40 mg/kg (1.0 ml/kg). Inject an equal volume of citrate buffer (pH 4.5) intraperitoneally into the control animals.",
    "This dose of STZ should produce a stable hyperglycemia in the high-fat diet rat for at least 130 days. The dose of STZ is critical. If it is too large, it yields a model that more closely resembles T1 and mortality increases. Zhang, Lv, Li, Xu, and Chen (2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0053]) advocate the use of two lower doses of STZ (30 mg/kg, i.p.) administered at weekly intervals. Under this treatment regimen, 85% of the animals develop diabetes with a mean fasting blood glucose of ∼14 mmol/L (∼252 mg/dl). Yorek (2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0052]) recommended 30 mg/kg STZ i.p. as the optimal dose in 12-week old Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks.\n8. Return the rats to their cages. Provide the high-fat or control diet food as before, and normal drinking water.\n9. At around 8:00 a.m., 10 days after STZ administration, measure the blood glucose concentrations in a tail-vein blood sample (Donovan & Brown, 2006b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-bib-0013]) using a One Touch Basic blood glucose monitoring system.\nThe STZ animals should have a blood glucose >15 mmol/L (270 mg/dl).\n10. The animals can generally be maintained as hyperglycemic for several weeks for the testing of antihyperglycemic drug candidates. Treat groups of animals as described in steps 3 to 10 to establish the diabetic state, after which initiate the administration of test compounds to measure the hypoglycemic response in comparison to diabetic animals treated with vehicle only.\nDisplayed in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.78#cpz178-fig-0004] are data from rats made diabetic using this protocol, demonstrating the stability of hyperglycemia across 134 days, and the profound impairment of glucose-induced increases in plasma insulin concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test conducted after 120 days.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6cbbad5a-293d-4218-871a-409bd357c9c4/cpz178-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

Time course of the effects of HFD/STZ (n = 12 rats) on (A) fasting plasma glucose and (B) fasting plasma insulin, in comparison with HFD/Veh treatment (n = 6 rats). At day 120, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and plasma glucose (C) and plasma insulin (D) were quantified in the two groups of rats. Data are mean ± SEM. Comparisons between HFD/STZ and HFD/Veh rats were performed with a Mann-Whitney test: *, p < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; and ***, P < 0.001. For further analysis of the OGTT, comparisons to baseline values in each group were made using a Friedman test with Dunn's post hoc test: HFD/Veh &P < 0.05; &&P < 0.01; and &&&P < 0.001; HFD/STZ #P < 0.05; ##P < 0.01; and ###P < 0.001.
