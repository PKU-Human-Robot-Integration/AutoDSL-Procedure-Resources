    "Study Participants\nThe protocol in this manuscript was developed for five representative high-resolution images collected from healthy volunteers (3F, 2M; age 29-57, avg. 37) who were free of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and cases of severe head trauma. All subjects were recruited at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). The study was approved by the CAMH Research Ethics Board and was conducted in keeping with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided written, informed consent for data acquisition and sharing. For details about the acquisition sequence used to collect these images, please refer to Winterburn et al., 2013 and Park et al., 2014.26,34 Images for all five subjects were checked for quality and retained. The hippocampus spanned an average of 118 coronal slices in these images.\n1. Software Set-up\nOpen Display: From the terminal using the following command: Display image_name.mnc -label label_name.mnc. The program will open 3 windows: 3D visualization window, 3-orientation image viewing window, and a navigation window. The terminal will also be used to run the program. Enlarge the coronal view, as the segmentations will be performed coronally. Zoom in on the hippocampus. Select F (Segmenting) in the navigation window. Select F (XY Radius:0.1). The terminal window will prompt for the user to “Enter xy brush size: ”. Set to 0.1. This will set the size of your paintbrush. The user can now begin drawing the hippocampus onto the MR image.\n2. Whole Hippocampus Manual Segmentation\nSet-up: Using a T1-weighted image, scroll to the anterior-most coronal slice of the hippocampus. To advance slices in the anterior direction, use the '+' key; use the '-' key to move in the posterior direction.",
    "Slice A: Anterior-Most Slice: Using the right-click on the mouse, draw the outer-most border of the hippocampal grey matter where it meets the surrounding temporal lobe white matter and use the high-intensity white matter of the alveus to assist with the superior border, where the hippocampus meets the amygdala12,22. Use the E (Label Fill) key in the segmentation menu of the navigation window to fill in the label inside the border. Continue to apply these borders throughout the anterior hippocampal head.\nSlice B: Hippocampal Head 1 (Figure 1B):\n\t\nSuperior, inferior, lateral, medial borders: Continue to draw the borders as described in step 2.2, using the white matter of the temporal lobe and alveus as a guide.\nSupero-medial border: For this, using the axial view, draw a horizontal line from the anterior edge of the lateral hippocampus29, and include anything below this line as hippocampus. NOTE: The supero-medial border becomes more ambiguous in these slices, where the grey matter of the hippocampus blends with the grey matter of the amygdala.\nSlice C: Hippocampal Head 2 with Dentations: Depending on the subject, the dentations of the hippocampus may be visible for 3-4 slices (typically, they are more visible on T2-weighted versus T1-weighted images). In these slices, continue to use the white matter of the alveus and temporal lobe to guide border segmentation12,22. For further details, follow steps 2.5.1-2.5.2.\nSlice D: Hippocampal Head 3:\nSuperior, inferior, lateral, medial borders: Draw the inferior border of the hippocampus at the white matter of the temporal lobe, the lateral border at the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, the superior border, following the curve of the dentations, at the white matter of the alveus/fimbria, and the medial border at the hypointense region of the ambient cistern12,22.",
    "Supero-medial and infero-medial borders: Continue to define the supero-medial border as described in step 2.3.2. Draw the inferior portion of the medial border where the hippocampus thins slightly and extends into the mildly hyperintense grey matter of the entorhinal cortex12,22.\nSlice E: Hippocampal Head 4 with Uncus: Continue to draw the inferior, lateral, and superior borders described in steps 2.5.1-2.5.2. Include the uncus (which is located medal to the main body of the hippocampus and is surrounded by low-intensity CSF) in the hippocampal segmentation12,22.\nSlice F: Hippocampal Body: Continue to draw the inferior, lateral, medial, and superior borders described in steps 2.5.1-2.5.2. Draw the infero-medial border at the point where the hippocampus thins as it transitions to entorhinal cortex/para-hippocampal gyrus12,22. Do not include the low-intensity CSF of the vestigial hippocampal sulcus in the segmentation.\nSlice G: Hippocampal Tail 1: Begin segmenting hippocampal tail-type slices when the crus of the fornix is first visible. Exclude the fascicular gyrus (a grey matter structure which blends with the hippocampus in parts of the hippocampal tail) from the segmentation by extrapolating the shape of the fascicular gyrus into the hippocampal tail from more anterior slices12,22. This extrapolation is only possible for 2-3 slices, after which the two structures cannot be accurately distinguished; at this point, treat all visible grey matter in this area as hippocampus .\nSlice H: Hippocampal Tail 2: Segment the low-intensity grey matter of the posterior hippocampal tail from the surrounding high-intensity white matter.\nSlice I: Posterior-Most Slice: Segment the small remaining area of hippocampal grey matter from the surrounding white matter of the temporal lobe.\n3. Hippocampal Subfield Manual Segmentation",
    "Set-up: Using a T2-weighted image, scroll to the anterior-most coronal slice of the hippocampus (as in step 2.1). To change the color of the paintbrush, select D (Set Paint Lbl:) on the segmenting menu in the navigation window. The command terminal will prompt: “Enter current paint label:”. Enter a number between 1 and 255. Each number corresponds to a different label color.\nSlice A: Anterior-Most Slice: Since subfield divisions are not yet visible in the anterior-most slice, draw a line dividing the visible hippocampal grey matter along its longest visible axis (which is not necessarily parallel to any of the cardinal axes) into two equal sections to approximate the true anatomy12,22. Label the superior of these two sections as CA1 and the inferior section as subiculum by choosing a different colored label for each subfield23,35.\nSlice B: Hippocampal Head 1: Label the low-intensity area in the middle of the hippocampal formation as SR/SL/SM13,37. When the bend along the inferior edge of the hippocampus becomes clear, use this landmark as the lateral border separating the subiculum from the CA112,22. Continue to follow the longest axis of the hippocampus to draw the CA1-subiculum border on the supero-medial tip37.\nSlice C: Hippocampal Head 2 with Dentations:\nSR/SL/SM, CA4/DG, and subiculum: Label the SR/SL/SM, CA4/DG, and subiculum as described for slice D (step 3.5.1).\nCA2/CA3 and CA1: Define the border between CA1 and CA2/CA3 as a 45º angle line extending in the supero-lateral direction from the most supero-lateral edge of the SR/SL/SM12,22. Extend the CA2/CA3 medially along the superior edge to the trough between the dentations12,22. Label the rest of the superior edge as CA112,22.\nSlice D: Hippocampal Head 3",
    "SR/SL/SM, CA4/DG, and subiculum: Label the dark SR/SL/SM band first, which will follow the curve of the CA137. Label any high-intensity grey matter inside of the SR/SL/SM as CA4/DG12,22,23,35,37. This may not be a continuous region, as in Figure 2C. Continue to define the subiculum-CA1 border using the bend in the inferior hippocampus12,22.\nCA2/CA3 and CA1: Continue to define the CA1 and CA2/CA3 border as in step 3.4.2. Extend the CA2/CA3 medially halfway along the superior edge of the hippocampus12,22 and label the other half of the superior edge as CA112,22.\nSupero-medial hippocampal head: In this slice, divide the supero-medial hippocampal head vertically in half. Label the medial half as SR/SL/SM12. Divide the lateral half in half again, this time horizontally. Label the superior portion as CA4/DG and the inferior portion as CA2/CA312.\nSlice E: Hippocampal Head 4 with Uncus\nLateral hippocampal head (subiculum): In the lateral portion of these slices, define the subiculum-CA1 border as a vertical line extending in the inferior direction from the most medial edge of the CA4/DG12,22.\nLateral hippocampal head (CA1, CA2/CA3, CA4/DG, SR/SL/SM.): Define the CA1-CA2/CA3 border in the same way as in step 3.4.2. Continue to label the SR/SL/SM as the low intensity region following the curve of the CA regions. Label the CA4/DG as the center cavity inside the SR/SL/SM, as in step 3.5.1.\nUncal hippocampal head (SR/SL/SM): Label the uncus of the hippocampus for approximately 10 slices as the hippocampal head transitions into the hippocampal body. In the uncus, label the low intensity region in the center as SR/SL/SM (when this is difficult to see, approximate the anatomy by segmenting a line 2-3 voxels wide up the center of the uncus)12.",
    "Uncal hippocampal head (CA2/CA3, CA4/DG): Draw a line at the superior edge of the SR/SL/SM section along infero-lateral/supero-medial axis of the uncus. Label all grey matter above this line as CA2/CA312. Label any unlabeled grey matter below this line (on either side of the SR/SL/SM) as CA4/DG12.\nSlice F: Hippocampal Body: Continue to apply the borders described in step 3.6.1-3.6.2.\nSlice G: Hippocampal Tail 1: Continue to apply the rules described in step 3.6.1-3.6.2. The subiculum-CA1 border becomes a 45º angle line extending in the infero-medial direction from the medial edge of the CA4/DG12,22.\nSlice H: Hippocampal Tail 2: Once the fascicular gyrus can no longer be distinguished from the hippocampal formation, label the entire outer layer as CA1, the low-intensity area inside of this as SR/SL/SM (as in previous slices), and any remaining grey matter in the middle as CA4/DG12,22.\nSlice I: Posterior-Most Slice: Once the dark SR/SL/SM is no longer visible in the center of the hippocampal formation, label the entire structure as CA112,22.\n4. Protocol Reliability\nResegment either the right or left hippocampus of each subject after waiting approximately one month from performing the original segmentation. Segment all of the subfields along the entire anterior-posterior length of the hippocampus, trying to follow the protocol rules as consistently as is possible.\nCalculate the Dice’s kappa between the original and resegmented volumes:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51861/51861eq1.jpg\n\twhere k=Dice’s kappa and A and B are label volumes.\nSubscription Required.
