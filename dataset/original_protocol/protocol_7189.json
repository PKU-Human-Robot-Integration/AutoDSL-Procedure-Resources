    "Grow Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 in an Erlenmeyer flask, until they reach the logarithmic growth phaseOpen the original vial and rehydrate the entire pellet in 1 mL of LB-medium.Mix well by pipetting up and down.Pipette 10 µL in 10 mL of LB-medium as pre-culture.Note: Centrifuge the remaining 950 µL at 1920 × g at room temperature (RT) for 5 min, resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of LB-medium containing 30% Glycerol, aliquot as 10 × 100 µL in cryovials, and freeze the aliquots at -80°C. This will be the stock for the pre-culture in further experiments. Incubate the pre-culture in a rotating incubator at 200 rpm at 37°C overnight.Next day, pipette 50 µL of this overnight pre-culture in 10 mL of LB-medium in an Erlenmeyer flask.Incubate in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm at 37°C for 1–2 h, until an OD600 of 0.5 (measured in a photometer using LB-medium as blank).Counting of viable Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium using for example a CASY TT counting systemUse the 45 µm capillary.Measure the background, by placing a new Casy cup with fresh Casy ton buffer under the measuring unit.Select program for background measurement (Table 1).Measure background. This should be below 30 counts and 1 µm size. Otherwise, wash the system.Prepare a new Casy cup with 10 mL of Casy ton buffer, and add 5 µL of S. typhimurium solution.Shake gently.Place sample under the measuring unit.Select program for measuring between 1–3 µm (Table 1).Measure.Click next to get the number of viable counts per milliliter = viable S.tm/mL.After the measurement is completed, remove the sample cup, and add a fresh Casy cup with 10 mL Casy ton buffer.Perform Casy Clean up to five times.Select Program for Washing (Table 1).After washing is completed, check the background.",
    "If the background is below 30, the Casy counting system can be turned off; otherwise, continue washing.Table 1. Programs CASY TT Counting system table:",

    "Intraperitoneal injection of miceUsing Omnican F syringes (30G × ½’’ (0.3 mm × 12 mm), intraperitoneally (i.p.) inject mice with 1000 bacteria in 200 µL of PBS, according to the measurement in the Casy counting system.Negative control mice are injected with 200 µL of PBS.A video demonstrating the procedure can be found at: Intraperitonelal Injection in the Mouse: https://researchanimaltraining.com/articles/intraperitoneal-injection-in-the-mouse/[href=https://researchanimaltraining.com/articles/intraperitoneal-injection-in-the-mouse/].Notes:  The injection of mice is performed in a bio-safety level 2 animal facility, where mice are housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC). After infection, all cages, litter, and used material must be autoclaved. Weight and body surface temperature are important markers for monitoring the mice during the infection. Therefore, mice should be familiarized to daily weighing and temperature measurements 3–5 days prior to the experiment. This will avoid stress-induced weight loss and changes in body temperature. All substances used should be warmed to RT. The injection of cold substances influences the wellbeing of the mice, and can lead to a sudden drop in body temperature. Monitoring of mice during the infectionNote: Mice on a C57BL/6 background express a non-functional NRAMP1 (natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1) protein. NRAMP is a phagolysosomal membrane transporter for iron, protons, and divalent cations, and is associated with host resistance to various intracellular pathogens. Non-functional NRAMP leads to intracellular persistence of S. typhimurium within macrophages, and early death after 5 days at the latest. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the mice in the most careful way. Body weight:The body weight should be measured at the same time each day, to avoid behavioral changes due to food intake. It is important to use a lockable box and a precision scale, which can be disinfected.Body temperature:The body temperature is measured with an infrared thermometer at the same time each day.",
    "Pick the mouse up by the middle of the tail and expose its abdomen. Allow the mouse to hold on to the grid of a cage with its forepaws, which allows the mouse to stretch its upper body and expose the abdomen. Hold the trigger to measure the temperature, taking care to aways measure at the same location of the abdomen.General appearance of the mice:The general appearance of the mice should be documented twice a day, for example according to the M-CASS scoring sheet inLilley et al. (2015), and your experimental animal license. Severe pain, suffering, and distress must be prevented.Isolation of splenocytesAfter 72 h of infection, isolate the spleens, and press the organs through a 100 µm cell strainer with the plunger of a 5 mL syringe, onto a Petri dish with 5 mL of cold PBS.Centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 5 min, and wash once with 5 mL of PBS (300 × g at 4°C for 5 min), discard the supernatant.Subject the cell pellet to erythrocyte lysis, by resuspending in 2 mL of ACK lysis buffer.Incubate at RT for 2 min.Wash once with 5 mL of FACS buffer (300 × g at 4°C for 5 min).Flow Cytometry stain of innate immune cellsAll procedures are performed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.Extracellular stain (Table 2)Prepare an appropriate mix of antibodies (1:200) in 100 µL of FACS buffer per sample (Table 2).Table 2.
