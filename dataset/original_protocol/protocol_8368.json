    "All experimental protocols involving animal subjects were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Southern Medical University.\n1. Prepare Solutions for Experiments\nPrepare the anesthetic (see Table of Materials): 1.5% pentobarbital sodium dissolved in ddH2O.\nPrepare the dissection solution (see Table of Materials): Dissolve one bag of Leiboviz's L-15 powder in 1 L of ddH2O. Adjust pH to 7.3 with 1 M NaOH. Adjust osmolarity to 300-330 mOsm by using an osmometer and 10 mM HEPES before use.\nDissolve 2 mg/mL collagenase IV (see Table of Materials) in dissection solution prepared in step 1.2.\nPrepare the immunostaining solutions (see Table of Materials): Dissolve the 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\tCaution: Paraformaldehyde is toxic; wear appropriate protection.\nDilute the 0.3% permeability agent in PBS. Dilute the 10% normal goat serum in PBS as the blocking buffer. Dilute the prestin antibody 1:200 in blocking buffer. Dilute the Alexa488-conjugated antibody 1:600 in blocking buffer. Dilute the Phalloidin-Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate 1:200 in PBS.\nPrepare the extracellular solution (see Table of Materials): Prepare the Leiboviz's L-15 medium as described above (step 1.2).\nPrepare the intracellular solution (see Table of Materials).\n2. ABR Recording\nNOTE: ABR recording has been previously described in detail in our previous study9.\nAnesthetize Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (1-14 day old pups and 2-month old adults, both sexes) with a single injection of 1.5% sodium pentobarbital (22 mg/kg for pups and 30 mg/kg for adults, intraperitoneal (i.p.)).\nPlace the anesthetized animal in a polyethylene-foam mold to immobilize the animal's body. Place the animal on an anti-vibration table in a sound-attenuating room. Keep the animal's body temperature at 37.5 °C with a heating pad.",
    "Wipe the head area with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol. By using a fine scissors, make a 1-2 mm incision ventrolateral to the external pinna to place the reference electrode or ground. A subdermal needle electrode (recording electrode) is located over the skull vertex (Figure 1A).\nUsing the function generator, generate calibrated tone bursts (1 ms rise/fall, 3 ms plateau) of various frequencies (2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 kHz) and intensities (decreased from 85 to 10 dB SPL in 5 dB step). Vary the frequency and amplitude manually or using a computer. Deliver sound stimuli through an electrostatic speaker located 10 cm away toward the head of animal.\nFilter (100-1,000 Hz), amplify and average (256 times) the sound elicited potential using a multi-function processor to get the ABRs. The ABR traces is monitored online and stored for offline analysis. It takes about 40 min to complete the ABR recording from one animal.\n\tNOTE: Usually, three to seven peaks (wave I to wave VII) with latencies less than 15 ms can be identified (Figure 1B). The ABR threshold is defined as the minimum sound level at which wave I and II could be detected.\nEuthanize before the animals awake from anesthesia (with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 mL 1.5% sodium pentobarbital).\n3. The Organ of Corti (OC) Dissection\nAnesthetize rat pups. For rats less than 6 days old (<P6), keep the animal in a 100 mm culture dish, and cover the dish with ice for 10 min. For rats >P6, anesthetize the animal with a single injection of 1.5% sodium pentobarbital (22 mg/kg, i.p.). Decapitate the rat pups after anesthesia.\nSterilize the head by spraying with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol.\nOpen the skull along the sagittal midline with scissors; remove the brain to expose the inner ear.",
    "Transfer the inner ear into a 35-mm Petri dish filled with 3 mL of ice-cold L-15 (Figure 2A).\nUnder the dissection microscope, use fine forceps to remove the bony capsule of the cochlea (Figure 2B).\nUnwrap the OC and associated stria vascularis (SV) from the modiolus.\nBy holding the basal portion of the SV with forceps, separate the OC from the SV completely by unwinding slowly from base-to-apex (Figure 2C).\nCut the OC evenly into three pieces by using fine scissors (Figure 2D).\n4. Immunofluorescence Staining\nBy using a 200 µL pipette tip, transfer the segments of OC (step 3.8) onto a glass slide, and fix with 100 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 4 h at 4 °C.\n\tCaution: Paraformaldehyde is toxic; wear appropriate protection.\nWash the tissue by displacing the paraformaldehyde with 100 µL of fresh PBS. Wash the tissue three times for 10 min.\nIncubate the tissue with 0.3% permeability agent in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the permeability agent in PBS and wash the tissue three times with PBS.\nBlock with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate with anti-prestin-C-terminus antibody (1:200) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight.\nWash three times with PBS for 5 min.\nIncubate with Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:600) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nWash three times with PBS for 5 min in the dark.\nIncubate with rhodamine-phalloidin (1:200) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark.\nWash three times with PBS for 5 min in the dark.",
    "Mount on a glass slide with mounting medium (containing DAPI). Image with confocal microscopy by using 405 nm, 488 nm, and 594 nm lasers. Set the laser power at 0.1-0.5 mW and the scan speed at 0.5 frame/s.\n5. Patch clamp Recording of Isolated OHCs\nUse the pipette puller and micro-forger to make patch pipettes with a tip diameter 2-3 µm. Back-fill the pipettes with intracellular solution. Usually, the initial resistance of patch pipette was 2.5-3.5 MΩ in bath solution.\nBy using a 200 µL pipette tip, transfer a piece of the OC (from step 3.8) into a 35 mm Petri dish. Digest the tissue with 100 µL of enzymatic digestion medium (collagenase IV, see Table of Materials) for 5 min at room temperature.\nDisplace the enzymatic digestion medium with 100 µL of L-15. Cut the tissue into small pieces using a micro scalpel to isolate the hair cells.\nAfter gentle pipetting, transfer the cells into a homemade small plastic chamber (diameter ~ 1.5 cm) filled with enzyme-free bath solution (~ 1.5 mL, see Table of Materials).\nPlace the chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope. Find the healthy-appearing solitary OHCs.\nLoad the patch pipette into the head stage of a 700B amplifier. Move the patch pipette carefully by a micromanipulator and position it around the bottom of the outer hair cell (Figure 3A).\nWhole-cell patch clamp the OHC by sealing the lateral wall of the cell body. Apply light suction until the cell membrane is ruptured. Set the holding potential at -70 mV. Cells with access resistance ranged from 10 to 17 MΩ and membrane resistance ranged from 100 to 500 MΩ, and are considered a successful whole-cell configuration.",
    "Using computer control, apply hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage (250 ms duration and ranging from −140 to +94 mV in 13 mV steps) to the cell to elicit whole-cell currents.\nAmplify the whole-cell currents, filter (corner frequency of 5 kHz) by a 700B amplifier. Convert the data by a 1440A converter and store for offline analysis.\nMeasure the membrane capacitance of OHCs using a two sine-wave voltage stimulus protocol controlled by a patch clamp software. Set the stimulate voltage range from -140 to 110 mV. Store the data for offline analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
