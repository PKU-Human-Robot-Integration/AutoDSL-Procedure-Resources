    "All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Carolina (federal assurance number: D16-00028). Six adult male F344/N rat was pair housed in a controlled environment under a 12/12 light: dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All animals were cared for using guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Virus packaging in 293 FT cells\nCulture the 293 FT cells (5×105/mL) in gelatin coated 75 cm2 flasks with DMEM plus 10% FBS11. Grow cells at 37 °C to be 50% confluent at transfection.\nDilute 22.5 µL of transfection reagent (e.g., Lipofectamine 3000) in 750 µL of medium (e.g., Opti-MEM) in a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube and vortex for 3 s.\nDilute 20 µg of EcoHIV plasmid DNA in 750 µL of medium in a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube and mix well.\nAdd diluted DNA into the tube of diluted transfection reagent and mix gently. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nAdd the mixture to 10 mL of prewarmed DMEM medium in 75 cm2 flask. Incubate cells for 2 days at 37 °C.\nHarvest and combine 24 mL of conditional medium from the two flasks that include the packaged lentivirus.\nCentrifuge all 24 mL of conditional medium at 500 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Transfer the clarified supernatant to a sterile 50 mL tube.\nCombine 8 mL of Lenti-x concentrator with 24 mL of clarified supernatant (1:3 ratio). Mix by gentle inversion. Incubate mixture at 4 °C for two days.\nCentrifuge mixture at 1,500 x g for 45 minutes at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nGently re-suspend the pellet with 100 µL of 100 mM PBS.",
    "Titer virus concentration with a p24 ELISA kit.\n2. EcoHIV-EGFP virus stereotaxic surgeries\nAnesthetize rats using 3% sevoflurane. Proceed to step 2.2 when the rats are not responsive to noxious stimuli and reflexes are absent.\nShave the hairs from the brain region and sterilize the skin twice with 70% ethanol and a chlorhexidine-based scrub. Secure the rat in a prone position in the stereotaxic apparatus.\nMake an incision (5-6 cm) through the skin along the scalp midline.\nMark two drilling positions at 0.8 mm lateral, 1.2 mm rostral to bregma. Drill a hole (diameter 0.4 mm) in each skull position.\nFill titered EcoHIV lentivirus solution (1.04 × 106 TU/mL) in a 10 µL injection syringe. Secure the syringe to the stereotaxic apparatus.\nMove down the needle close to the surface of drilling hole. Measure and move 2.5 mm in depth.\nInfuse 1 µL of virus solution at a rate of 0.2 µL/min. Keep the needle inside of the injection area for 5 min. Slowly move the needle up until it is outside of the rat skull.\nSuture the skin with a 4-0 silk thread.\nSterilize the incision with 70% ethanol once. Subcutaneously inject butorphenol (Dorolex, 0.1 mg/kg body weight).\nTransfer the rat to a recovery chamber with a heating pad until it wakes up.\n3. Visualization of brain sections\nNOTE: Wait one to eight weeks after EcoHIV viral infusion.\nAnesthetize the rat with 5% sevoflurane. Continue to step 3.2 when the rats are not responsive to noxious stimuli and reflexes are absent.\nFix the rat in a supine position inside a fume hood.\nIncise the skin along the thoracic midline. Cut the diaphragm and open the thoracic cavity.\nInsert a 20 G × 25 mm needle into the left ventricle.\nImmediately open the right atrium with scissors.",
    "Perfuse 50 mL of prechilled 100 mM PBS at a rate of 5 mL/min.\nPerfuse 100 mL of cold 4% paraformaldehyde at a rate of 5 mL/min.\nDecapitate the rat, open the scalp and remove the brain.\nPostfix overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde.\nTransfer the brain to 40 mL of 30% sucrose in 100 mM PBS in 50 mL tube until the brain floats down to the bottom (about 3 days).\nSnap freeze the brain in methylbutanol for 2 min at - 80 °C.\nSecure the brain tissue on a metal platform inside a -20 °C cryostat.\nCut 50 µm thick coronal sections using the cryostat.\nTransfer the brain slices onto glass slides with a fine brush.\nMount sections in 0.3 mL of antifade medium and cover with 22 mm 50 mm coverslips.\nKeep the glass slides in the dark at room temperature till dry.\nImage the targeted neurons with a confocal microscope using Z-stack based on brain region boundaries and morphological characteristics of neurons.\n\tNOTE: The confocal microscope settings used were: magnification of 60 X (A/1.4, oil), and a Z-plane interval of 0.15 µm (pinhole size 30 µm; back-projected pinhole radius 167 nm) using a wavelength of 488 nm.\nSubscription Required.
