    "PBMC separation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are extracted from whole-blood samples of the subjects, using density-gradient centrifugation with Lymphoprep solution (22°C).Add Lymphoprep solution to 15 mL tube.Dilute blood with an equal volume of PBS.Layer blood on top of Lymphoprep, being careful to minimize mixing of blood with Lymphoprep.Centrifuge at 800 × g for 20 min at room temperature, using a swing rotor.Transfer mononuclear cell layer under plasma layer using a Pasteur pipette, without disturbing tha plasma-Lymphoprep interface to new tube.After washing with 10 mL of ice-cold PBS twice, the cells are resuspended at a concentration of 1.25 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium (37°C) supplemented with horse serum (5%), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL).Chemotactic cells The granulocyte-rich cell layer (chemotactic cells) from the blood samples of the volunteer without allergic symptoms are separated using Lymphocyte-poly cell separation media (22°C).Carefully layer 5 mL of whole blood on top of an equal volume of Lypmpholyte-poly in a 15 mL tube.Centrifuge at 500 × g for 30 min in a swing rotor at room temperature.Harvest the polymorphonuclear cell (chemotactic cell) band (lower band) and transfer new tube using a Pasteur pipette.Wash the cells with PBS by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min at room temperature.Suspend the chemotactic cells in DMEM medium (22°C) at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/mL.Serum separation Separate the subject's serum from whole-blood samples using a Venoject II tube.After blood sampling, leave tubes for over 1 h at room temperature, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 350 × g at room temperature.Transfer the serum on the top into the falcon tube and, if necessary, store at -20°C until further use.",
    "Drug solution The drug solutions contain the test drug (Mosapride, Sulpiride or Rabeprazole) at a final concentration of one-half of the Cmax (15, 75, or 200 ng/mL, respectively) in PBS, except for Sulpiride (in DMSO).PHA solution Prepare the PHA solution by dissolving PHA in PBS at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL.Preparation of antigen solution Prepare the sntigen solutions by mixing the drug solution (50 µL) and the subject's serum (50 µL).Control solutions Instead of the drug solution, 50 µL of PBS or PHA solution are used as the negative and positive controls, respectively.Preparation of test sample (culture supernatant) In 24-well plates, stimulate the 1.9 mL (2.4 × 106 cells) of PBMC by addition of 100 µL of antigen solution or control solution.Culture PBMC for 48-72 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.Transfer the culture supernatants to 15 mL tubes and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature, collect them in new tubes as test samples, and store them at -20°C until further use.Real-time monitoring of cell migration Record cell migration against serum or culture supernatants over time using EZ-TAXScan (Kanegasaki et al., 2003).Mount the glass plate on the bottom base of the holder, and fill the house with 4 mL of RPMI medium (37°C).Mount the silicon substrate and wafer clamp in the house on the glass plate and press them down with the mechanical clamp.Make the contacts between the lower surface of the etched substrate to the glass plate and the upper surface to the highly polished stainless steel clamp water-tight with mechanical pressing, due to the optical flatness of the surfaces.Remove the air bubbles trapped in the observation area or the compartment of each channel when assembled, if any, by pushing and pulling the medium with a 1 mL syringe.",
    "After assembling and setting the observation unit in the appropriate position on EZ-TAXIScan, load the chemotactic cells into the lower (front) wells at 5-10 µL (5-10 × 104 cells)/well (Figure 1A).Shift the chemotactic cells near the observation area by aspiration with a 1 mL syringe.Subsequently, add the serum or culture supernatant (1.5 µL/well), depending on the purpose, to the upper (back) wells with a 10 µL-microsyringe, thereby producing the gradient (gradient length, 260 µm).The observation stage is 4 µm in-depth for human granulocyte-rich cells.Record the images of chemotactic cells in the observation area at 2-min intervals over the 240-min experimental period using a computer connected to the microscope.The chemotactic cells migrate toward the upper (back) well from the lower (front) well depending on the reactivity of humoral chemotactic factors (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4309/bioprotoc-12-03-4309-g002.jpgFigure 2. Typical images of cell migration in HiSAT. The chemotactic cells separated from the non-allergic volunteer are aligned at the edge of the observation stage by aspiration with a syringe (A). By reacting the subject's lymphocytes with the drug solution, the cells migrate according to the concentration gradient of the culture supernatant containing the chemotactic factors (A-D). Similar images can be obtained by using serum instead of culture supernatant."
