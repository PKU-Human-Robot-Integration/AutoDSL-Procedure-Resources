Further, you will also be able to generate cerebral organoids from the previously derived iPSCs. The major aim of this section is to consistently generate cerebral organoids.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1209-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Passages should be performed every 4–5 days using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA.\nFibroblast passage\nCoat 100 mm plates with 5 mL of 0.1% gelatin (Sigma™ G1890-500G), and incubate them for at least 2 h at 37°C.\nWash cells with 5 mL of 1X PBS. Remove the PBS and add 1 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, incubate for 5 min at 37°C.\nDuring the incubation, add 9 mL of MEF medium in a 15 mL plastic tube once the incubation is completed.",
    "Using a 5 mL serological pipette take 3 mL from the previous tube and resuspend the cells.\nTransfer the cells back to the 15 mL tube and mix with the remaining 6 mL of medium.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL tube at 200 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of MEF medium. Tap the bottom of the tube to detach the cells and add 9 mL to reach a total volume of 10 mL.\nRemove the gelatin solution from the 100 mm plate previously prepared.\nAdd 9 mL of MEF medium and 1 mL of the resuspended cells.\nShake the plate softly drawing an “8” shape at the incubator to homogeneously distribute the cells.\nIncubate at 37°C until the next passage.\nPause point: Culture until 90% confluence before continuing, this may take 4–5 days.\nFibroblast reprogramming strategy with SeV Cocktail. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nPrepare the cells for the CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai virus (SeV) Reprogramming Kit (Thermo Fisher, A16517).\nCritical: Before starting, coat a 6 well plate with 2 mL of 0.01% gelatin in MEF medium and allow it to polymerize for at least 2 h at 37°C.\nCritical: Fibroblast culture is required to reach 90% of confluence before starting the reprogramming protocol.\nWash the cells with 5 mL of 1X PBS, remove the PBS and add 1 mL of Accutase® and incubate for 4 min at 37°C.\nNote: Use of Accutase® instead of Trypsin is recommended at this stage by the reprogramming kit provider. TrypLE Express Enzyme can be used as well, although the investigator needs to optimize the incubation time.\nPrepare a 15 mL tube with 9 mL of MEF medium.",
    "Take 3 mL of MEF medium from the 15 mL tube to resuspend the cells. Use a 5 mL serological pipette.\nTransfer the cells back to the 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 200 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of MEF medium.\nAdd 9 mL more to reach a total of 10 mL.\nCount the cells and calculate the proper volume to take 1, 1.5, and 2 × 105 cells/well. Prepare 2 wells for each quantity of cells.\nNote: Different numbers of cells will give you three options to choose the best plate that is 30%–60% confluent the next day.\nTransfer each number of cells to an individual well in the previously coated 6-well plate.\nResuspend the cells in a final volume of 2 mL per well.\nDistribute the cells homogeneously by shaking the plate softly in an “8” shape at the incubator.\nCritical: It is necessary to generate a homogeneous distribution of the cells.\nCulture the cells for 18 h at 37°C.\nCritical: The cells should be at 30%–60% confluency.\nCells’ transduction with CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai virus (SeV) Reprogramming Kit (Thermo Fisher, A16517).\nNote: This kit is composed of three reprogramming viral vectors that express the four Yamanaka factors (Oct, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc). Prepare the cocktail in MEF medium following manufacturer instructions.\nNote: To compare the efficiency of Sendai virus-based reprogramming with other integration-free reprogramming methods (please see Schlaeger et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nAdd the proper amount of the cocktail to 2 mL of MEF medium to reach a ratio of hKOS, hc-cMyc, and hKlf4 of 5:5:3 MOI in respect to fibroblast cells number in each well.\nIncubate at 37°C for 24 h.",
    "Note: To estimate the cell number in each well detach the cells in one well of each concentration plated the day before, resuspend the cells in MEF medium and count them. Use the other well seeded at the same concentration of cells to perform the transduction.\nNote: The titer of the vectors is lot dependent. To make a proper calculation visit thermofisher.com/cytotune and search for the certificate of analysis by product lot number to have the correct titer for each vector.\nNote: This formula is provided by the manufacturer to do the calculations. MOI or multiplicity of infection, and CIU or cell infectious units:\nVolume of virus (uL): MOI (CIU/cell) × number of cells\nTiter of virus (CIU/mL) × 10−3 (mL/μL)\nCalculation example: 7.5 uL of viral stock is required to infect 1.5 × 105 cells with MOI of 5 if the viral titer is 108 CIU/mL.\nCritical: From this step until the iPSC colony passage, pre-treat all the used material with 10% bleach before discarding it.\nNote: Soon after transfection, iPSC colonies could be visible in a mixed population with fibroblast cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). It is important to pipette softly during the passages, to not detach fibroblasts from the wells. This will allow keeping iPSC cultures free of fibroblasts.\nReplace with 2 mL of fresh MEF medium daily for 5 days.\nOn day 4, coat two 100 mm plates with hESC qualified Matrigel® according to manufacturer instructions and incubate 18 h at 37°C.",
    "Critical: Matrigel® should be utilized in cold conditions, it will turn into a gel once over 10°C. Pre-cold 200 μL tips at −20°C for at least 2 h before using them. Defrost an aliquot of Matrigel® in ice for 1–2 h or at 4°C for 18 h; keep it on ice during the whole procedure. Use cold DMEM-F12 medium to dilute Matrigel®. Dilution factor (DF) is lot dependent. Find DF in the quality certificate. Half the amount of DF is enough to prepare 25 mL of the coating solution. Twelve mL of this solution is sufficient for one 100 mm plate. This Matrigel® dilution preparation will be required later on step 23.\nOn day 5, remove the medium and perform a passage using steps 8–10.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of medium.\nCount the cells and take 150,000 and 200,000 cells and seed them in each Matrigel-coated plate.\nCulture seeded plates at 37°C for 18 h in a final volume of 2 mL MEF medium.\nOn day 6, remove MEF medium and add 2 mL per well of ReproTeSR medium (StemCell technologies 05920) and perform daily medium changes until day 13.\nFrom day 14 and onward, replace medium with 2 mL per well of mTeSR1 medium (StemCell Technologies 85850).\nNote: By day 21–28 after reprogramming small iPSC colonies start to be visible over the fibroblast cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) which become more stable with time (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nIsolation and culture of iPSC colonies\nPrepare 12 well plates coated with Matrigel previously diluted in DMEM/F12 using 500 μL per well and incubate for 18 h at 37°C before reprogrammed cells transfer.\nNote: To perform the iPSC colonies transference, a microscope inside the biosafety cabinet is required.",
    "Using a 27G needle make squares over the selected colony to break it into pieces (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nTo transfer the cells, use a 200 μL tip and set the micropipette to 50 μL.\nTransfer each colony to a different well.\nIncubate at 37°C for 18 h.\nCritical: Select isolated colonies to ensure they are clones from one cell.\nNote: Keep culturing the cells in Matrigel-coated plates using mTeSR1 medium and perform passages at 60%–80% confluence.\niPSC Passage\nNote: To perform iPSC passage, use ReLeSR reagent (StemCell technologies 05872).\nFirst, remove mTeSR1 medium and wash the cells with 1 mL 1× PBS.\nAdd 200 μL of ReLeSR to each well and incubate the plate for 1 min at 20°C to 25°C\nRemove ReLeSR and incubate for 2 min at 37°C.\nNote: Once the cells are placed into the new well, resuspend the cells softly 3 times to break the cells into smaller colonies (50–100 μm).\nCritical: To avoid the transfer of fibroblast during the first set of passage, incubation with ReLeSR is recommended to be performed at 20°C–25°C, since iPSC will be released faster than fibroblast at this temperature. Also, in the following passages, you can see differentiated cells, and apply the same strategy to exclude them. Examples of differentiated cells in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G.\nDetach the cells using 500 μL of mTeSR1 medium.\nResuspend softly, no more than 2 times.\nIn parallel, add 1 mL of mTeSR1 medium into a Matrigel-coated well plate after removing the coating medium and transfer the appropriate number of cells.",
    "Critical: The number of iPSCs transferred into the new well will depend on the cellular confluence at the source well. With 65%–80% or higher confluence, 1:10 of the 500 μL (50 μL) can be transferred to the new well loaded with 1 mL of fresh mTeSR1. In a lower confluence (50%–65%) 1:5 (100 μL) is recommended.\nNote: Once all the fibroblasts have been eliminated, you can start culturing them in a bigger amount (e.g., 6 well plates). Keep using mTeSR1 medium.\nNote: Perform at least 10 passages before iPSC characterization and frozen stocks.\nFreezing iPSC stock\nPrepare cryopreservation medium for iPSCs\nIf you are starting from a well in a 6-well plate, remove the medium and add 1 mL of PBS to wash the cells.\nRemove PBS and add 500 μL of ReLeSR solution. Incubate for 1 min at 20°C–25°C and 2 min at 37°C.\nRemove ReLeSR and add 2 mL of mTeSR1 medium.\nResuspend the cells 3 to 5 times to detach them from the well.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL tube and add 5 mL of fresh mTeSR medium.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200 g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend carefully the cells in 1 mL of mTeSR1 medium.\nNote: If the confluence of the cells is less than 70% add 500 μL instead of 1 mL of mTeSR and cryopreservation medium and transfer the mixture to only one cryovial as explained in the next steps.\nAdd 1 mL or 500 μL of cryopreservation medium and resuspend 3 times or until the medium looks completely homogeneous.\nTransfer 1 mL or 500 μL of the mixture to 1 cryovial previously labeled with the name of the cell line, passage number, and date.",
    "Freeze the cells using a Nalgene® Mr. Frosty isopropanol freezing container (Sigma Aldrich C1562) that allows the temperature to decrease by 1°C/min.\nKeep the cells at −80°C for 18 h.\nStore the cells in a liquid nitrogen tank.\nNote: In parallel to the generation of frozen stocks, keep culturing the cells to perform iPSCs characterization.\nFixation of iPSC in the culture plate for characterization.\nBefore passage, coat 18 mm glass coverslips in a 12 well plate and incubate for 18 h at 37°C.\nPerform a passage (as listed in steps 26–27) using the plate with Matrigel-coated coverslips, and culture for 1 or 2 days, or until individual and compact colonies can be identified.\nRemove the mTeSR medium and wash quickly with 1 mL of 1× PBS. Remove PBS and add 1 mL of 4% PFA in PBS previously warmed at 20°C–25°C, and incubate for 15 min at 37°C.\nRemove the fixative solution and wash with 1 mL PBS. Incubate for 5 min at 20°C–25°C and replace with fresh 1 mL PBS.\nPause point: At this point, cells can be stored at 4°C until performing the immunofluorescence assay.\nImmunofluorescence assay on iPSC cells\nNote: The immunofluorescence assay will be performed in the culture plate.\nWash the cells once, with 1 mL PBS for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nFor blocking/permeabilization incubate each well with 500 μL of 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich A7888) in PBS 0.05 Triton™ X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich T8787) for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove the blocking/permeabilization solution.\nIncubate with 400 μL of the different antibodies diluted in blocking/permeabilization solution for 18 h at 4°C.\nWash each well with 500 μL of PBS for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRepeat the previous step 2 times.",
    "Incubate with 400 μL of fluorescent secondary antibodies, diluted in PBS 0.05% Triton X-100. Incubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash each well with 500 μL of PBS for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nIncubate with 500 μL of DAPI solution (300 μM, in PBS).\nWash each well with 500 μL of PBS for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: Prepare slides correctly labeled with the name of the cell line, colony number, passage, and antibodies used.\nAdd 1 drop of FluorSave mounting medium (Millipore 345789) over each slide.\nCarefully, remove each coverslip from the well using the bent tip of a needle to release the coverslip and a tweezer to take it out of the well.\nFlip it over the slide and put it on top of the mounting medium drop.\nPress softly with a paper towel to eliminate the excess of medium and let the mounting medium dry for 1–2 h at 20°C–25°C, or for 18 h at 4°C.\nSeal the coverslips with transparent nail polish and keep the slides at 4°C. Protect from light until imaging. Do not store the slides in a vertical position until the nail polish is completely dry.\nNote: Examples of the results are shown in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H and 1I.\nAlkaline phosphatase (AP) staining\nBefore starting the alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, culture cells onto Matrigel-coated coverslips as previously explained in step f.\nNote: AP is an enzyme highly expressed in iPSC. Expression of AP is related to undifferentiated state and self-renewal potential. In this protocol, we have performed the AP assay using the StemAb Alkaline Phosphatase Staining Kit II 00-0055, following the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Wash the cells in the well with 1 mL PBS and fix for 2–5 min using the fixative solution provided by the kit. Do not exceed this time, over fixation can diminish AP activity.\nIncubate the cells 5–15 min at 20°C–25°C with the AP substrate away from light.\nCheck the purple-red color formation and stop the reaction aspirating the solution and perform two washes with 1 mL PBS each.\nNote: Do not incubate the cells for extended periods to avoid non-specific staining. Cells that do not have AP expression will remain colorless.\nTake the coverslips out of the plate and mount them in a slide using a hydrophilic mounting medium (not provided in the kit).\nEvaluate the results using brightfield microscopy.\nExamples of the results are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H.\nNote: After the initial screening based on pluripotency markers, the chromosomal integrity, and pluripotency of the cells should be tested in detail using karyotyping trilineage differentiation potency, and expression of pluripotency gene array. These techniques are outside the scope of this manuscript. For further reading on the detailed characterization of iPSCs please see Baghbaderani et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nPause point: iPSCs stocks from characterized colonies are frozen, ready to proceed with the generation of cerebral organoids.\nAlternative starting point. iPSCs are commercially available, if this is your case, proceed with the generation of cerebral organoids.\nGeneration of cerebral organoids\nTiming: 50 days\nEmbryoid body (EB) formation. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nNote: Start with an iPSC culture with no more than 70%–80% confluence. If required, perform a starting passage as described in step 26.\nCritical: Check pluripotency (compact colonies with well-defined edges, high nuclei to cytoplasm ratio) by morphology. Carefully remove differentiated cells by scraping them with a pipette tip, trying to leave iPSCs colonies intact.",
    "Note: Before starting cerebral organoid generation, prepare the EB formation medium, EB seeding medium and Resuspension medium.\nPrepare the iPSC for the generation of EB\nAspirate iPSCs culture medium and wash the cells with PBS (1 mL for a 6 well plate).\nAdd 1 mL of TrypLE™ (per 6 well plate) and incubate for approximately 3–5 min at 37°C.\nGently dissociate the cells (3–5 times) in TrypLE using a 1 mL pipette and transfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL conical tube containing resuspension medium (9 mL).\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 g for 5 min.\nNote: At this step, the ROCK inhibitor in the resuspension medium will reach a final concentration of 10 μM.\nCritical: Avoid over-pipetting the cells as it can induce damage.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of EB seeding medium.\nCritical: Pipette up and down several times until single-cell suspension is obtained.\nCount the cells and calculate the appropriate volume of EB Seeding Medium needed to obtain 90,000 cells/mL.\nPlate 100 μL of single-cell suspension (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) into each well of an ultra-low attachment 96-well round-bottom plate using a multichannel pipette.\nPlace the plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nCritical: Mix well before seeding. Resuspend cells every so often to avoid cell settling and to ensure an equal number of cells are seeded. Do not disturb the plate for 24 h.\nNote: Observe EBs under the microscope after 24 h, they should be round in shape with defined clear borders. Some dead cells can be seen surrounding the EBs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nOn day 2, gently agitate the medium by pipetting up and down once, to detach dead cells around EBs.",
    "Add 100 μL of EB Formation medium to the existing medium to each well using a multichannel pipette.\nOn day 4, repeat the procedure as in day 2.\nEB induction\nPrepare the EB Induction medium\nAdd 500 μL of EB Induction medium to each well of an ultra-low attachment 24-well.\nCarefully transfer one EB to each well of an ultra-low attachment 24-well using a 200 μL wide-bore pipette tip.\nCritical: To avoid transferring any formation medium, collect the EBs by pipetting up and let them fall by gravity until they settle at the opening of the tip. Gently, insert the tip into the well-containing Induction medium and without ejecting, let the EBs fall.\nCritical: Avoid using tips with a small diameter as they can damage the EBs.\nPlace the plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Observe EB under the microscope after 24 h, they should be round with defined and translucent edges (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nEB embedding\nCritical: 1 day before starting the EB embedding procedure, thaw Matrigel® in ice at 4°C for 18 h or until completely melted (15 μL/EB, total of 1.44 mL for 96 COs). To prevent unwanted polymerization, keep Matrigel® on ice.\nPrepare the EB Expansion medium and embedding surface\nNote: Prepare the embedding surface by cutting a piece of Parafilm® (approximately 4x4 cm), place it on a 96-well plate and apply digital pressure to create 16 small indentations (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) To sterilize, immerse each Parafilm® piece in 70% ethanol, transfer to a 60 mm sterile cell culture plate and expose to UV radiation for 18 h. Alternatively, purchase an embedding surface from StemCell technologies (08579).\nUsing a 200 μL wide-bore pipette tip, carefully transfer one EB to each indentation in the Parafilm®.\nGently remove the excess medium, without disturbing EBs",
    "Add 15 μL of Matrigel® onto each EB.\nVerify that EBs are in the center of the Matrigel®. If not in the center, gently move Matrigel® around EBs using a tip to move them.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nCritical: Embed one plate at a time to prevent EBs from drying.\nAdd 3 mL/well of Expansion medium to an ultra-low attachment 6-well plate.\nUsing sterile forceps hold Parafilm® surface above one well and carefully wash off Matrigel® containing EBs using a 1 mL pipette with Expansion medium.\nDistribute EBs evenly among wells by incubating up to 12–16 EBs per well.\nPlace the plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Observe EB under the microscope 24 h after embedding, neuroepithelial buds should appear as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and will continue expanding as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E. Low-quality EBs will show poor or no evidence of epithelial formation.\nOrganoid Maturation\nNote: The extension of the maturation stage can rank from 30 days to over 300 days, where they can achieve several millimeters in size (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F). For practical purposes, we will complete the maturation stage at 30 div. However, for the TBI model 80 div to 220 div are recommended.\nOptional: Maturation of organoids can be done in presence of antibiotics.\nPrepare the EB Maturation medium\nCarefully, aspirate the medium using a sterile serological pipette from wells containing organoids. Do not disturb Matrigel® embedded organoids.\nNote: Medium change can also be performed with a glass vacuum pipette; however, we recommend this with bigger organoids as they can be accidentally aspirated.\nReplace the medium with 3 mL/well of maturation medium and place the plate with organoids on an orbital shaker (see below for rpm calculation) in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "Note: Calculate the rpm using the equation below.\n  r p m =     R C F   t h r o w  ×  1.118     ×  1000  \nWhere: Rpm = shaker speed (revolutions per minute) RCF = relative centrifugal force (g) Throw = shaking diameter (mm), as specified by the manufacturer For 6-well plates use the following data:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1209_12.csv\nChange the maturation medium every 3–4 days.\nNote: Cerebral organoids will continue to grow and reach a size of approximately 3–4 mm in diameter after 30 days in Maturation Medium.\nOrganoid Fixation\nTransfer the number of organoids required, using a sterile metal surgical spoon to a 5 mL conical tube.\nCarefully, remove the remaining medium and wash once with 1 mL of PBS.\nCritical: Make sure organoids are not damaged during the transfer. Alternatively, cut the tip of a 1000 μL pipette tip with sterile scissors to obtain a bigger tip opening.\nAspirate PBS and gently resuspend in 1 mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin v/v (Fisher-brand, 032059).\nRemove formalin and add 4 mL of fresh formalin.\nIncubate horizontally (to prevent organoid attachment) at 20°C–25°C for 24 h.\nNote: After fixation, organoids can be stored at 4oC in PBS, if required.\nAfter fixation, remove formalin, wash organoids carefully with 1 mL of 70% ethanol (Fisher scientific, A405P-4) and incubate for 24 h with 4 mL of 70% ethanol.\nRemove 70% ethanol and add incubate for 1.5 h with 4 mL of 80% ethanol, followed by 90% ethanol and 95% ethanol.\nAspirate ethanol and incubate with 4 mL 95% ethanol for 18 h.\nRemove 95% ethanol and incubate two times with 4 mL of 100% ethanol for 1.5 h, discard the ethanol and perform two incubations with xylene (Fisher Scientific X3S-4) for 2 h.",

    "Note: Cerebral organoids are cultured in absence of any antimicrobial compound. Thus, sterility is key to the successful growth of organoids, and to perform the CCI procedure. Cleared bones with the previously explained method will help to provide a sample free of bacteria, although it is highly recommended to perform a sterilization method to secure the sterility of our sample. High-temperature strategies are not recommended to sterilize bones, thus gas-based methods are suitable for this purpose. Here we have successfully used hydrogen peroxide steamed gas, to perform the sterilization of skull and stereotactic equipment simultaneously.\nDisassemble the stereotaxic frame and place all the parts inside a plastic box without the lid. Put the lid on a side with the inner surface facing up.\nUncap the tube where the skull previously sealed and drilled was stored.\nLocate the tube with the skull in the plastic box with the stereotaxic frame.\nApply the steamed gas sterilization procedure.\nOnce completed, seal the plastic box with the lid and sterilize the outer surface.\nCritical: This procedure needs to be performed by trained personnel. Protection equipment is required. Hydrogen peroxide gas is a chemical hazard. The following equipment and sterilization protocol is recommended: SteraMist, (TOMI Environmental Solutions) using 7.8% hydrogen peroxide solution (“BIT Solution” – EPA registration 90150-2) sprayed through a cold plasma arc to form an aerosol of ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP). The iHP is sprayed from 18-24” away from the surface. 5–10 s of contact time per 1 square foot of surface is required to be disinfected.\nTransfer the equipment and skull into a biosafety cabinet.\nCritical: To perform this properly, place the container in front of a biosafety cabinet and transfer the frame pieces and the skull. UV light treatment can be performed for 18 h.",
    "Proceed with the assembly of the stereotactic frame.\nOpen sterile PBS inside the biosafety cabinet and wash the skull for 10 min. Let it dry for 15 min inside the biosafety cabinet.\nPhantom brain preparation.\nGelatin and agarose mixture preparation.\nCritical: Prepare the mixture in a biosafety cabinet.\nAdd the agarose LE (Thomas Scientific™C748D75) and gelatin from porcine skin (Sigma™ G1890-500G) together into a 50 mL tube with sterile PBS to reach a final concentration of 0.3% agarose and 0,8% gelatin in a total volume of 30 mL.\nBoil the mixture on a hot plate until complete melting.\nNote: As an alternative, a microwave can be used to melt the mixtures. Extra precautions are required to avoid contamination.\nCritical: Leave the tube lid partially open during the boiling procedure.\nSkull filling with the phantom brain. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nTransfer the phantom brain mixture in the liquid phase into the skull, using approximately 1 mL.\nLeave it to solidify for 15–20 min.\nNote: Use a 5 mL sterile syringe loaded with a needle no smaller than 20G. Secure the skull filled with the phantom brain in the stereotactic frame, using the ear and tooth bars. Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B.\nNote: At this stage, the stereotactic frame and skull preparation is ready to receive the cerebral organoids for the CCI procedure.

The red star identifies the contact sensor, which is clamped to the ear bar.\nControlled cortical impact.\nCritical: CCI equipment calibration must be previously performed based on the researcher's aim.\nCritical: Autoclave the impactor tip together with the stainless spoon previously mentioned, these tools will make direct contact with the organoids.\nPositioning the cerebral organoids into the skull. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nTransfer the COs from the incubator to the biosafety cabinet. Proceed carefully.\nIn the biosafety cabinet, carefully remove and replace the old media with fresh media.\nUsing a sterilized stainless spoon, pick up a single organoid and place it on top of the phantom brain through the skull window to perform the CCI as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C.\nCalibration of CCI equipment and impact procedure. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]\nProceed with the impact and transfer the organoids back to a petri dish with 3 mL of fresh maturation media until the CCI procedure is completed.\nNote: The impact parameters must be carried as desired by the researcher, considering the impact speed, dwelling time, and depth. i.e., to induce a moderate to severe TBI, use the following parameters on the CCI equipment: (4 m/s), dwell time (200 ms), and depth (1mm).",
    "Note: Calibrate the impact depth using the vernier scale on the stereotactic frame in the Z-axis. Perform this depth adjustment after setting the zero with the contact sensor in the CCI equipment (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nCerebral organoid recovery and analysis.\nAfter the CCI procedure, remove the media and replace it with 3 mL of fresh maturation media.\nTransfer the organoids back to the incubator.\nKeep the organoids in the incubator for the desired recovery time.\nNote: The extent of recovery time before analysis depends on the experimental design. However, 7 days were sufficient to evaluate the events associated with cellular response to primary injury after CCI. Long-term recovery times (100–180 days post-impact) can be also performed. In our experience, organoids impacted at early developmental stages (40–50 days in vitro) released cells to the media, however, we were able to culture them for up to 180–200 days after CCI."
