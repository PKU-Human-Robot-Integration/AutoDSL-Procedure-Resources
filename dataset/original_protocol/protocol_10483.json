    "1. Preparation of Solutions and Media\nPrepare M9 buffer by dissolving KH2PO4 3.0 g (22.05 mM), Na2HPO4 6.0 g (42.2 mM), and NaCl 5.0 g (85.5 mM) in 1 L of autoclaved deionized water. Add 1.0 mL of 1 M MgSO4 (12 g in a final volume of 100 mL autoclaved deionized water) after autoclaving. Mix 100 mL of the resulting 10x M9 with 900 mL of autoclaved deionized water to make a 1x solution.\nTo make egg buffer, dissolve 6.896 g of NaCl (118 mM), 3.578 g of KCl (48 mM), 0.294 g of CaCl2-2H2O (2 mM), 0.406 g of MgCl2-6H2O (2 mM) and 5.958 g (25 mM) of HEPES in 1 L of autoclaved deionized water. Adjust pH to 7.3 using NaOH.\nPrepare fresh sodium hypochlorite/NaOH solution by adding 1 mL of 5-6% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and 180 µL of 10 N NaOH to 3.8 mL of deionized water.\nWeigh 60 g sucrose and dissolve in autoclaved deionized water to a final volume of 100 mL to make 60% sucrose solution.\nDissolve 0.684 g of sucrose in 10 mL of autoclaved deionized water to make 200 mM sucrose. Check and adjust to the same an osmolarity using osmometer. Make 1 mL aliquots in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and freeze at -20 °C.\nWeigh 0.184 g of AMPH (molecular weight 184.75 g/mol) and dissolve in 10 mL of deionized water to make a 100 mM stock solution. Mix 2 µL of the stock solution in 400 µL of water to make 0.5 mM working solution.\nPrepare Nutrient growth media (NGM) plates",
    "Mix 3 g of NaCl (52.65 mM), 20 g of peptone, 25 g of bacto-agar and 975 mL of deionized water in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. Include a magnetic stir bar and autoclave (121 °C, 15 PSI) for 1 hour using liquid cycle.\nCool to and maintain the temperature at about 50 °C by placing the flask on a heater while stirring. Add 0.5 mL of cholesterol (5 mg/mL in ethanol), 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4, 1 mL of 1 M CaCl2 and 25 mL of 1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (108.3 g of KH2PO4, 35.6 g of K2HPO4, deionized water to 1 L).\nPipette 25 mL each into 100 mm x 15 mm Petri plates and allow the media to solidify. Store the plates upside down at 4 °C in a box for up to 4 weeks.\nPreparation of Lysogeny broth (LB) broth\nDissolve 5 g of LB powder mix in 200 mL of deionized water in an Erlenmeyer flask. Autoclave for 30 minutes utilizing the liquid sterilization cycle. Allow the broth to cool down. Store at room temperature for 1-2 weeks.\nPreparation of NA22 bacterial plates\nUse a sterile pipette tip or a sterile bacterial loop to streak an LB plate with a small volume of NA22 E. coli bacteria from glycerol stock and incubate the plate upside down in a 37 °C incubator overnight to grow isolated colonies. Pick and introduce a single colony into 200 mL of LB broth prepared in step 1.8 and let grow overnight at 37 °C on a shaking platform.",
    "To seed the plates, dispense 200 µL of bacterial culture onto the NGM plates prepared earlier in step 1.7 and spread with a sterile glass hockey stick. Let the plates dry overnight or longer under a hood and store upside down in an airtight box at 4 °C.\nTo make the eyelash/platinum tool to pick worms, glue a thick eyelash or a platinum filament into a glass Pasteur pipette using super glue. Cut the tip of the eyelash at an angle using a razor blade. Alternatively, a Bunsen burner can be used to melt the tip of the glass pipette around the platinum filament.\n2. C. elegans Husbandry\nNOTE: Culture wild-type N2C. elegans strain on Escherichia coli NA22 plates. The detailed culture methods are described below.\nPreparation of worm culture\nTo make a starter culture of worms, cut a small piece of agar from a plate containing well-fed animals and transfer it onto a NA22 E. coli bacteria plate prepared in step 1.9 using a sterile spatula. Incubate plates at 20 °C for 3-4 days. Under a stereo microscope, visually confirm the presence of gravid adults.\nPreparation of synchronized population of worms\nCollect gravid adults from at least 2 plates by dispensing autoclaved deionized water all around the plate using a squirt bottle. Gently swirl the plate to dislodge the worms and collect the worms into a 15 mL polystyrene conical tube using a disposable plastic pipette.\nSpin down the tube in a centrifuge at 140 x g for 2 min to pellet the worms, then aspirate off supernatant using a vacuum pump or with built in laboratory vacuum.",
    "Resuspend and wash the worms by filling the tube with autoclaved deionized water and mix and centrifuge at 140 x g for 2 min. Aspirate the supernatant and repeat this last step two more times or until worms are clear from bacteria (water appears clear when mixed with the worms).\nAdd 5 mL of freshly made sodium hypochlorite/NaOH solution (step 1.3) to the worm pellet and rapidly mix using a vortex. Incubate the tube on a rocker for about 4-8 min. The time of incubation with sodium hypochlorite/NaOH solution fluctuates between 4-8 minutes based on the quality of the stock sodium hypochlorite solution (bleach).\nPut a drop (2-50 µL) of solution containing worms on a glass microscope slide and check every 2 min under the microscope for worm lysis. When about 70% of the worms are lysed and eggs are released, fill the tube with egg buffer prepared in step 1.2 and immediately centrifuge for 1 min at 140 x g to pellet the embryos and worm carcasses.\nAspirate the supernatant and wash the pellet 3 more times by filling the tube each time with egg buffer. Spin down at 140 x g for 1 min and remove the supernatant each time. The pellet turns white at the end of washes.\nAfter the final wash, separate the embryos from the dead carcasses in 30% sucrose solution. Add 5 mL of autoclaved deionized water to the pellet, resuspend and add 5 mL of 60% sucrose prepared in step 1.4. Mix thoroughly and centrifuge at 160 x g for 6 min.",
    "Use a glass Pasteur pipette to transfer the embryos floating at the upper meniscus into a fresh 15 mL conical tube. Do not take more than 3-4 mL. To remove any remaining sucrose, wash the embryos 3 times with autoclaved water by centrifuging at 140 x g for 3 min, removing the supernatant and resuspending the pellet (and filling the tube) each time.\nRepeat the washes with 1x M9 buffer. After the final wash, resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of M9. Leave the tubes on a shaker overnight (no more than 14 h) for the eggs to hatch into L1 larvae. Worms will remain in L1 larval stage due to lack of food.\nWash the L1 larvae 3 times with autoclaved water to remove any pheromones released by the larvae by centrifuging at 140 x g for 2 min. Resuspend the larvae in 1 mL of water. Make a 1:10 dilution of the worms in water, pipette a 10 µL drop on a glass slide, put a coverslip on and count the number of worms under a stereoscope. Repeat this twice and average the results.\nPipette the volume of worms that corresponds to about 1,000 worms onto an NA22 plate (that was previously brought to room temperature) by placing small drops on the plate. Leave the plate half-open until the drop dries out. Then cover the plate and incubate upside down in 20 °C incubator for about 44-48 h or until the worms reach late L4 stage, as confirmed visually under a stereomicroscope. Now the worms are ready to be tested for SWIP.\n3. SWIP",
    "NOTE: We describe the manual method of assessing SWIP in wild-type worms treated with AMPH. We also briefly discuss the tracking of worms and further analysis of worm kinetics using an automated worm tracker and a tracking software which were previously described by Hardaway et al.10.\nManual method to test for SWIP\nAliquot 40 µL of 200 mOsm/L sucrose solution either with or without 0.5 mM AMPH into a glass spot plate. Under the stereoscope, pick 8-10 late-L4 stage worms with an eyelash or platinum pick and submerge the pick in the plate containing the solution until worms move off the pick and swim into the solution. Note the number of worms picked into the well, start the timer, observe and record the number of worms exhibiting SWIP at each minute mark.\nCopy the raw data into a spreadsheet and calculate the percent of worms paralyzed by dividing the number of worms paralyzed at each minute by total number of worms tested throughout the assay and multiply by 100. Copy the percent values into any graphing and statistical software and plot the data with percent values on the Y axis and time on X axis using the XY graph format.\nPerform two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc analysis (e.g., Bonferroni post-test) to test for statistical significance among control, AMPH groups and time of treatment.\nAutomated analysis of SWIP\nPerform automated analysis on a single worm at a time. The protocol to set up camera, the worm tracker software and script to run the tracking software analysis are described in detail in Hardaway et al.16.",
    "Briefly, place a single late L4 stage hermaphrodite into a glass spot plate utilizing an eyelash pick, as described in the manual method in section 3.1.2. Record swimming videos of one worm at the time and use the worm tracker software to calculate the frequency of body bends.\nFollow the script provided with the tracking software to obtain worm thrashing frequency and to generate heat maps from the worm thrashing data.\nSubscription Required.
