    "Maintenance of asexual P. falciparum Maintain asexual P. falciparum transgenic parasites (3D7-gABCG2-GFP) in complete culture medium at 4% hematocrit and less than 5% parasitemia in cell culture flasks. This transgenic strain is maintained in the presence of 2 nM WR99210. Monitor parasitemia every second day by Giemsa-stained thick smear (Maier and Rug, 2013) (Note 1). Count at least 300 cells (ideally using a blood cell counter or tally counter) to determine the culture parasitemia.Replace culture medium with complete culture medium (CCM) and split cultures to 0.2% parasitemia every second day. Flush the culture flask with malaria gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 for 30 s, close the lid tightly, and incubate at 37 °C (standard culture conditions) (Maier and Rug, 2013).To generate large populations of highly purified male and female gametocytes, expand the cell culture to at least 60 ml and proceed with gametocyte production (Note 2).Production of male and female gametocytes (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4045/bioprotoc-11-11-4045-g001.jpgFigure 1. Flow-diagram outlining the timeline of the procedure Day -6. Start with 60 ml of culture at 3-5% predominantly ring parasitemia and 4% hematocrit. Perform a sorbitol synchronization as follows (Lambros and Vanderberg, 1979). Split the culture in half and transfer to two 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 800 × g for 7 min at room temperature (RT). Discard the supernatant and resuspend each cell pellet in 10 ml of 5% D-sorbitol. Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C. Centrifuge at 800 × g for 7 min at RT, discard the supernatant, and resuspend each cell pellet in 30 ml of CCM. Combine the suspensions from both tubes and incubate the culture under standard conditions.Day -5. Determine the parasitemia early in the day (12-18 h after synchronization) from a Giemsa-stained thick smear (Note 3).",
    "Expand the culture to 200 ml at 1% trophozoite parasitemia and 4% hematocrit in large 175 cm2 cell culture flasks. Flush the culture flask with malaria gas mixture and incubate under standard conditions.Day -4. Determine the parasitemia from a Giemsa-stained thick smear. The culture should be at 3-5% ring parasitemia. If parasitemia is lower, culture parasites for another replication cycle without allowing parasitemia to exceed 5% trophozoites. Perform sorbitol synchronization as follows (Lambros and Vanderberg, 1979). Aspirate medium carefully from the flask without disturbing the RBC layer and resuspend the cells in 30 ml of 5% D-sorbitol. Transfer the suspension into a centrifuge tube. Wash the flask with 10 ml of 5% D-sorbitol and add it to the centrifuge tube to prevent loss of cells. Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C. Centrifuge the culture at 800 × g for 7 min at RT, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 30 ml of CCM. Return the suspension to the 175 cm2 cell culture flask rinsed with 30 ml of 5% D-sorbitol, top up to 200 ml with CCM, flush with malaria gas mixture, and incubate under standard conditions overnight.Day -3. Determine parasitemia from a Giemsa-stained thick smear. Expand culture to 400 ml at exactly 2% trophozoite parasitemia and 4% hematocrit in two 175 cm2 cell culture flasks (each flask containing 200 ml of culture), flush with malaria gas mixture, and incubate under standard conditions overnight.Day -2. Determine parasitemia from a Giemsa-stained thick smear. Ideally, the culture should be at 10-12% ring stage parasitemia (Note 4). Carefully remove 50 ml of medium from each cell culture flask without disturbing the cells and add 50 ml of fresh CCM (only replace 25% of the medium volume to continue to stress the culture).",
    "Flush the flasks with malaria gas mixture and incubate the cultures under standard conditions overnight.Day -1. Determine parasitemia from a Giemsa-stained thick smear. Resuspend the culture and divide equal volumes into six 175 cm2 cell culture flasks. Top up each flask to 200 ml with fresh CCM and adjust hematocrit to 4% with fresh red blood cells (this results in 1,200 ml of cell culture in 6 flasks). Flush the flasks with malaria gas mixture and incubate the cultures under standard conditions.Day 0.Perform a sorbitol synchronization (Lambros and Vanderberg, 1979) as follows. Aspirate medium carefully from each flask and resuspend the cells of each flask in 30 ml of 5% D-sorbitol. Transfer the suspension into a centrifuge tube, wash each flask with 10 ml of 5% sorbitol, and add it to the centrifuge tube to prevent loss of cells. Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C. Centrifuge the culture at 800 × g for 7 min at RT, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 30 ml of CCM (resulting in a cell suspension of about 25% hematocrit).Remove asynchronous parasites at trophozoite or schizont stages and spontaneously committed gametocytes using a SuperMACS separator and CS column (Note 5).Assemble the CS column and magnetic separator according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the biological safety cabinet (Figure 2). To avoid accidental needle pricks, use a blunt end needle (22G drawing up needle, Note 6) and clip the end of the needle sheath with pliers instead of removing the sheath.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4045/bioprotoc-11-11-4045-g002.jpgFigure 2. Assembly of the CS column for use in the SuperMACSTM magnetic separator Sterilize the column with 25 ml of 80% ethanol (if it has previously been used) (Note 7), rinse with 25 ml of 1× PBS (pH 7.",
    "4, warmed to 37 °C), then prime with 25 ml of ICM (warmed to 37 °C) by filling the reservoir and drawing liquid through the column with the syringe. To remove air bubbles, load the syringe with ICM, reattach it to the stopcock, and flush ICM upward through the column. Draw ICM back into the syringe until the ICM level is just above the filter. Repeat flushing the column until all air bubbles are removed, then drain excess ICM through the needle until the ICM level is just above the filter. Ensure the column never runs dry from here onward (the liquid surface must always stay above the filter) as air bubbles reduce the binding surface of the column.Place column between the magnets and position a collection tube below the needle (flow resistor). Load the 25% hematocrit RBC suspension of one flask onto the column (Figure 3). Drain through the column drop-wise (adjust the flow rate to approximately 3 ml/min with the stopcock), collecting the effluent that contains uninfected red blood cells and rings committed to gametocytogenesis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4045/bioprotoc-11-11-4045-g003.jpgFigure 3. CS column loaded with 25% hematocrit RBC suspension placed in the magnetic field. Stopcock is blocking downward flow through the needle. Gradually turn it clockwise to drain culture slowly.Load the column with 50 ml of CCM (warmed to 37 °C) and drain through the flow resistor into the collection tube until the effluent is no longer red.Transfer all effluent to a 175 cm2 cell culture flask and top up to 200 ml with CCM. Flush the flask with malaria gas mixture and incubate under standard conditions.Remove the column from between the magnets and rinse by loading 25 ml of ICM onto the column, drawing the liquid into the syringe, and then discarding. Repeat until the rinse is no longer brown.",
    "Fill the reservoir with 6 ml of ICM and allow it to flow through the column and needle.Repeat Steps B7b (iii-vi) until all culture flasks have been purified.Rinse the column with 25 ml of 1× PBS, 50 ml of autoclaved Milli-Q water, and 25 ml of 100% ethanol by drawing the liquid into the syringe and discarding it. Fill the reservoir with 6 ml of 100% ethanol and allow it to flow freely through the column and needle. Air-dry the column in the biological safety cabinet. Disassemble the column and stopcock and store in a sealed sterile plastic bag for reuse. Discard the used needle and syringe.Day 1. Perform a sorbitol synchronization as described on day 0 (Step B7a) but resuspend the RBC pellet of each flask (approximately 8 ml packed cell volume) in 30 ml of CCM containing 50 mM N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Transfer the suspension to a 175 cm2 cell culture flask, top up to 200 ml with CCM containing 50 mM GlcNAc, flush the flask with malaria gas mixture, and incubate under standard conditions [Note 8; Fivelman et al. (2007)].Days 2-6. Replace the medium in the cultures daily with fresh CCM supplemented with 50 mM GlcNAc, flush the flask with malaria gas mixture, and incubate under standard conditions.Day 7. Perform a sorbitol synchronization as described on day 1 (Step B8).Day 8 (Note 9).Perform a sorbitol synchronization as described on day 0 (Step B7a), creating a cell suspension of about 25% hematocrit in ICM.Purify mature gametocytes using a SuperMACS separator and CS column. Purify and elute the gametocytes from each flask separately.Follow the same procedure as in Step B7b (i-iii). To maximize yield, reload the effluent onto the column and drain drop-wise into a waste bottle. Mature gametocytes (mostly stage IV) are retained in the column (Note 10).",
    "Load the column with 50 ml of ICM warmed to 37 °C and drain through the needle into the waste bottle until the effluent is no longer red.Remove the column from between the magnets and elute the retained gametocytes by loading the column with 25 ml of CCM and draining through the needle drop-wise into a collection tube. Transfer the effluent into a 175 cm2 cell culture flask, flush the flask with malaria gas mixture, and incubate under standard conditions.Repeat Steps B11b (i-iii) until all cultures have been purified, adding the effluent from all cultures into the same 175 cm2 cell culture flask (resulting in approximately 150 ml of gametocyte suspension).Set a small aliquot of magnet-purified culture (~1 ml) in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 1 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 µl of CCM. Use this to prepare a Giemsa-stained smear to confirm the presence of gametocytes and determine their stage visually.Rinse, dry, and store the column as in Step B7b (viii).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of male and female gametocytes (Table 1)Prepare gametocyte samples for FACS.Resuspend magnet-enriched gametocytes. Set aside a small aliquot (~1 ml) in a microcentrifuge tube (GFP single color control). Transfer the rest of the cells to 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 800 × g for 10 min at RT.Discard the supernatant and resuspend all cells in 3 ml of 1× PBS with 10 mM glucose and 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342.Incubate the sample at 37 °C for 15 min in the dark and wash twice in 1 ml of 1× PBS, with 1 min spins at 2,000 × g. After the last wash, resuspend the sample for sorting in 3 ml of 1× PBS containing 10 mM glucose.",
    "Prepare single color controls for FACSResuspend a culture of asexual 3D7-gABCG2-GFP parasites and transfer 2× 0.5 ml of 4% hematocrit cell suspension to two microcentrifuge tubes.Set aside a small aliquot (~1 ml) of the resuspended magnet-enriched gametocyte culture.Centrifuge the above three tubes for 1 min at 2,000 × g. Discard the supernatant from the microcentrifuge tubes.To prepare the Hoechst single color control, resuspend one aliquot of asexual 3D7-gABCG2-GFP parasites in 1 ml of 1× PBS containing 10 mM glucose and 10 µg/ml Hoechst 33342. Incubate the sample at 37 °C for 15 min in the dark and wash twice in 1 ml 1× PBS with 1 min spins at 2,000 × g. After the last wash, resuspend the control in 1 ml of 1× PBS containing 10 mM glucose.Resuspend the gametocyte aliquot and the other asexual parasite aliquot in 1 ml of 1× PBS containing 10 mM glucose to prepare the GFP single color control and unstained control, respectively.Table 1.

    "Gating strategy and FACSCreate a new experiment in FACS Diva. In the cytometer window, select the following channels: FSC A, H, and W; SSC A, H, and W; Pacific Blue A (or a corresponding channel to record Hoechst 33342) and Alexa Fluor 488 A (or a corresponding channel to record GFP). Create a worksheet with the dot plots (Figure 4), noting that the plots only show the events included in the parent gate.Load and run the unstained, Hoechst 33342 only, and GFP only controls. Adjust the voltages to bring the events into range (Figure 4). Adjust the single cell gates to your experimental conditions. The Hoechst only control should contain uninfected red blood cells with no staining, ring-stage infected red blood cells with low staining, and highly stained trophozoite- and schizont-infected red blood cells. Set the Hoechst intensity of the gametocyte gates to the middle population in the Hoechst single color control. The GFP single color control will contain cells with two levels of GFP intensity. Set the GFP intensity of the female gametocyte gate to match the high GFP intensity cells. The male gametocyte gate should match the GFP intensity of the unstained control.Load and run the gametocyte sample. Adjust the gating strategy if required. Prepare collection tubes filled with 2 ml of CCM at 37 °C, then start sorting cells in male and female gates into the respective collection tubes (Note 11). If multiple collection tubes are required (>10 ml), store full collection tubes at 37 °C.Check the purity of the sorted samples by analyzing a subset of each using the identical gating strategy.Since gametocytes are collected at a very low cell density, most applications of this protocol will require a final centrifugation of 1,800 × g for 10 min to pellet collected gametocytes.",
