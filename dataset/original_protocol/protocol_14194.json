  "procedures": [
    "All procedures with live animal use were authorized by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Université de Montréal (CÉUA, 'Comité d'éthique de l'utilisation des Animaux').\n1. Considerations Before Surgery\nSelect 10 weeks old specific pathogen free (SPF) leghorn chickens for the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Their weight must be between 1.0 and 1.2 kg.\nWithdraw the feed 12 h prior to the procedures to empty the intestinal tract.\nPrior to surgery, place the chickens under general anesthesia following a protocol verified by an anesthesiologist. Premedicate each chicken 15 min prior to the surgery with an intramuscular (IM) injection of midazolam 1 mg/kg and butorphanol 4 mg/kg. Repeat, every 4 h, the injection of butorphanol 4 mg/kg IM or when the breathing pattern changes and frequency increases during anesthesia. For the general anesthesia, during all procedures, administer isoflurane at a concentration between 1.5 and 2.5% with an intratracheal tube.\n\tNOTE: The use of premedication for sedation and analgesia is recommended as they will significantly improve the depth of anesthesia, reduce the quantity of anesthetics necessary during all procedures, as well as enable researchers to control pain levels.\nMonitor the anesthesia by recording body temperature, heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory rate and rhythm, oxygen saturation, expired carbon dioxide (CO2) and neurologic reflexes.\n\tNOTE: A person must be assigned to monitor these parameters throughout all the procedures.\nFollow sterility principles throughout the surgical procedures. Ensure that the surgeon and the assistant surgeon dress with sterile gowns, gloves, a mask and protective goggles according to institutional preoperative protocols. Ensure that the surgeon scrubs the hands with a chlorhexidine gluconate impregnated sterile brush up to the elbow with emphasis on fingernails and each finger surface.\nSterilize the surgical instruments with a sterilizer.\n2. Surgical Site Preparation",
    "Firstly, manually remove the feathers from the abdomen with a gentle traction.\nScrub the surgical site with a chlorhexidine gluconate detergent impregnated sterile brush. Gently scrub the skin from the center to the outside for a total contact time of 5 min without coming back to the center.\nPerform 3 alternative passages on the surgical site with a chlorhexidine gluconate solution and isopropyl alcohol using sterile gauzes.\n\tNOTE: The passage must start from the middle of the surgical site to the borders to avoid contamination from the non-disinfected areas to the surgical site.\nPlace the sterile surgical drape on the chicken.\n3. Extraction of the Small Intestines from the Abdominal Cavity\nIncise the surgical drape with scissors to expose only the skin of the surgical site.\nIncise the skin by performing an ''L'' shape low-midline incision with a scalpel blade #3.\n\t\nStart the first incision 1 cm caudal to the sternum and end it at 1 cm cranial to the cloaca.\nPerform the second incision perpendicular to the first incision. Start from the caudal end of the first incision and continue 5 cm to the left side of the abdomen by following the pelvis line.\n\t\tNOTE: This opening will create a flap that will allow an easier extraction of the intestines.\nWith surgery scissors, cut the peritoneum and abdominal muscles with the same ''L'' shape pattern to open the abdominal cavity.\n\tNOTE: This will expose the air sacs. Intestines are located underneath these structures. Air sacs must be humidified with gauzes saturated with sterile saline 0.85 % to avoid desiccation and possible rupture throughout the procedure.\nInsert a Snook spay hook in the abdominal cavity by following the left abdominal wall and work the way around the abdominal air sacs.",
    "Gently exteriorize the intestines and spread these out on the surgical field.\n\tNOTE: Keep intestines humidified by frequently spraying sterile saline 0.9% throughout the procedure. Also, gauzes humidified with sterile saline can be placed on the intestines to avoid desiccation.\nGrab the intestines using a dry sterile gauze and gently pull out the small intestines by manual traction to expose the jejunum.\n\tNOTE: Mesenteric vessels are fragile and excessive tension may rupture them which may lead to intestinal ischemic lesions and greatly compromise the outcome of the procedure.\n4. Fabrication of Intestinal Loops\nCreation of loop no. 1.\n\t\nPlace a simple ligature with a polyglactin multifilament synthetic absorbable material in the proximal jejunum by avoiding the ligature of major mesenteric vessels.\nPlace a distal ligature 2 cm away from the proximal ligature.\n\t\tNOTE: Simple ligatures made with multifilament suture material are placed along the intestinal tract to create hermetic segments. A schema (Figure 1) describes the location of all ligatures. The loops consist of a proximal and distal ligature separated by 2 cm.\nCreation of interloop no. 1.\n\t\nPlace a simple ligature 0.5 cm aborally to the distal ligature of loop no.1.\n\t\tNOTE: Between successive loops, there are interloops of 1 cm, i.e. segments making a physical separation between the loops. To likely decrease the possible risk of cross-contamination from one loop to another, a simple ligature is placed in the middle of the interloop (0.5 cm from the distal and proximal ligature of 2 adjacent loops). This reduces the risk of a possible leaked contaminant from a loop to reach the ligature of an adjacent loop. These segments are not mandatory but will decrease the risk of cross-contamination.\nCreation of subsequent loops and interloops.\n\t\nRepeat steps 4.1 and 4.2 to obtain the number of desired loops.",
    "NOTE: In this experiment, 9 loops and 8 interloops were created. Total length amounted to 26 cm. The number of loops can be adjusted depending on the study.\n5. Injection of Clostridium perfringens Strains Into the Loops\nInject with a sterile syringe and needle 26 G the pathogen in loop no.1. Gently insert the needle on the antimesenteric side of the intestine at a 45° angle.\n\tNOTE: In this experiment, 0.2 mL of brain heart infusion (BHI) containing 1 x 106 CFU (colony forming units) of C. perfringens in the mid-log growth phase was injected in each loop. 5 different strains were injected in 5 different loops and the 4 remaining loops were injected with a negative control containing no bacteria (sterile BHI), alternating pathogens and sterile BHI loops.\nRepeat step 5.1 to inject all loops.\nGently replace the intestinal tract in the dorsal area of the abdominal cavity, underneath the air sacs.\n6. Closure of the Abdominal Cavity\nThe suture of the peritoneum and abdominal muscles.\n\t\nSuture the peritoneum and abdominal muscles along the pelvis (made in step 3.3) with a simple continuous suture pattern using a polyglactin multifilament synthetic absorbable material.\nSuture the peritoneum and abdominal muscles from the sternum to the cloaca (made in step 3.3. with a simple continuous suture pattern using a polyglactin multifilament synthetic absorbable material.\nThe suture of the skin.\n\t\nUsing a polyglactin multifilament synthetic material and a simple continuous suture pattern, close the incision of the skin along the pelvis made in step 3.2.\nUsing the same multifilament ligature material and a simple continuous suture pattern, close the incision of the skin from the sternum to the cloaca made in step 3.2.\n7. Conclusion",
    "After the surgical procedures, keep the chicken under general anesthesia with proper use of analgesics to minimize animal pain during the infection time. Continue anesthetic monitoring to ensure an adequate anesthesia level.\nAfter the desired infection time, humanely euthanize the chicken by cervical dislocation under general anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: For these procedures, the required time to induce microscopic lesions with C. perfringens pathogenic strains was 7 h.\nWith a scalpel blade #3, cut a 0.5 cm to 1 cm long loop section and place it in 10% formalin for fixation overnight and further histopathological analysis.\nWith the same scalpel blade, cut the remaining loop section and place it in a sterile microcentrifuge tube for the isolation of the C. perfringens strains in each loop further bacteriologic analysis for their genetic characterization.\nRepeat steps 7.2 and 7.3 for all loops by changing the scalpel blade between every loop.\nSubscription Required.
