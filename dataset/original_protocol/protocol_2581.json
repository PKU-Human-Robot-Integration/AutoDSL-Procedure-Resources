    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGenerate triple transgenic Cre+;Flp+;Ai65 mice\nTiming: 20 weeks\nTiming: at least 6 weeks (for step 2c)\nThe aim of this step is to generate triple transgenic mice by crossing together Cre lines, Flp lines and reporter lines. It takes at least two generations to obtain triple transgenic mice that can be used for experiments (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Therefore, a minimum of 5–6 month of time is required to prepare animals. Subsequent steps, including fixation, brain sectioning, IHC and imaging, take relatively shorter times.\nObtain mouse lines from Jackson laboratory.\nThe following are the mouse strains we imported from Jackson laboratory:\nVGLUT1-Cre (B6;129S-Slc17a7tm1.1(cre)Hze/J): JAX 023527.\nVGLUT2-Cre (Slc17a6tm2(cre)Lowl/J): JAX 016963.\nVGLUT3-Cre (B6;129S-Slc17a8tm1.1(cre)Hze/J): JAX 028534.\nVGAT-FlpO (B6.Cg-Slc32a1tm1.1(flpo)Hze/J): JAX 029591.\nAi65 (B6;129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm65.1(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J): JAX 021875.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2241_12.csv\nNote: Three vesicular transporters, VGLUT1, VGLUT2 and VGLUT3, are responsible for loading glutamate into synaptic vesicles. They are encoded by Slc17a7, Slc17a6 and Slc17a8 respectively, with almost mutually exclusive distributions in the brain. Meanwhile, VGAT, which is encoded by Slc32a1, is responsible for loading GABA into synaptic vesicles. In this project, we created three sets of Cre-FlpO intersections: VGLUT1-Cre/VGAT-FlpO, VGLUT2-Cre/VGAT-FlpO, and VGLUT3-Cre/VGAT-FlpO.\nNote: VGLUT1-Cre,14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] VGLUT2-Cre,15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] and VGLUT3-Cre (Hongkui Zeng - Allen Institute for Brain Science) are all knock-in strains that have an IRES2 sequence and a Cre recombinase sequence inserted immediately downstream of the translational STOP codon of the VGLUT1, 2 and 3. VGAT-FlpO (Hongkui Zeng - Allen Institute for Brain Science) is also a knock-in mouse. It has a T2A sequence and an optimized FLP recombinase (FlpO) inserted into the translational STOP codon of the VGAT gene.",
    "Note: Ai65 is a knock-in line harboring the Rosa-CAG-Frt-STOP-Frt-Lox-STOP-Lox-tdTomato in the Rosa locus.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Unless both Cre and Flp recombinase are expressed, the two STOP cassettes prevent transcription of the tdTomato, making the Ai65 line a Cre and Flp dual dependent reporter line (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Before designing an intersectional crossing strategy, it is important to check which chromosome the transgene is located. For knock-in strains, this can be done by searching NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene]). Here we list the chromosome number of the transgenes studied in this protocol in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. There are 20 chromosomes in mice, thus it is more likely that transgenes from different mouse lines reside on different chromosomes. If this is indeed the case, one should be able to cross lines without much difficulty. However, if transgenes of two mouse lines happen to locate in the same chromosome, then due to the diploid nature of mouse genome, it is not possible to produce progeny that are homozygous for both transgenes. In this scenario, the best outcome for any descendant is to carry one copy of each transgene. Please also note that if transgenic lines are made by conventional pronuclear injection method, either with small, linearized plasmid DNA or with large Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA, the integration events are random and as a result the identity of the chromosome containing the transgene are often unknown.",
    "Critical: Before setting up mice breeding, one needs to find out if there is germline expression of Cre or Flp recombinases. Information about germline expression, if available, are often provided in the Jackson laboratory lab’s mouse line database. For the Cre and FlpO drivers listed above, there is no specific note by Jackson lab regarding germline expression. As such, one may choose either male or female to carry the Cre or FlpO recombinase. Should it be known that a certain Cre or FlpO driver can be active in either male or female germlines, researchers may consider using the opposite gender for breeding to avoid transmitting of Cre or Flp mediated genetic alterations throughout all tissue in the progeny.\nCross FlpO line and Cre line with Ai65.\nCross VGLUT-Cre mice with Ai65 mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCross VGAT-FlpO with Ai65 mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Step 2b can be done in parallel with step 2a.\nNote: Ai65 can be maintained as homozygous (hom). Although Ai65het and Ai65hom can both be used for breeding in step 2a and 2b, one should preferably use Ai65hom if available to conserve time and animals.\nWait for pups to be born and to reach weaning age.\nPerform mice tail biopsy procedure at weaning and then prepare genomic DNA for PCR.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nCutting less than 0.5 cm of mouse tail into an Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 0.2 mL of tail lysis buffer, leave Eppendorf tube overnight in an 85°C oven (shaking is not required). If time is of essence, heat tail samples at 95°C for about 30 min with shaking then move to the next step.\nAdd 0.2 mL of tail neutralization buffer. The samples are now ready for PCR.\nPerform PCR genotyping.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2241_13.csv",
    "Note: We use standard PCR conditions and agarose gel-based detection method. The following is an example of reaction set-up based on Qiagen’s Taq polymerase and 10× buffer (#210203) (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). We also use Taq polymerase from Genscript (Cat. No. E00007) and it performs equally well on our tail DNA samples.\nNote: Qiagen’s 10× PCR buffer contains 15 mM MgCl2, making the final concentration of MgCl2 to be 1.5 mM in the PCR reaction above. For some primers, however, it might be necessary to increase final MgCl2 concentration to 2–2.5 mM. Qiagen’s Q solutions can improve suboptimal PCR caused by high degree of secondary structure or high GC-contents in the DNA template. Although Q solution is not required for many PCR reactions, we nevertheless include Q solution in all our PCR reactions.\nCreate triple transgenic Cre+;Flp+;Ai65 mice.\nCross VGAT-FlpO+;Ai65het mice with VGLUT-Cre+;Ai65het mice generated from step 2.\nWait for mouse pups to be born and to reach weaning age.\nPerform tail biopsy.\nPerform genotyping.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2241-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. PCR genotyping for Cre, FlpO, and Ai65\n(A) Primer locations for Cre (top) and PCR products detected by agarose gel (bottom). The internal control primers recognize mouse Gabra1 gene.\n(B) FlpO primers (top) and PCR gel image (bottom). The internal control primers recognize mouse IL2 gene.\n(C) Ai65 primers (top) and PCR gel image (bottom).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2241_14.csv",
    "Note: We have used both male and female FlpO and Cre drivers of above lines and we rarely observed germline transmission of stop cassette removal from the Ai65 allele, suggesting that transgene expression (Cre or FlpO) is not active, or very low, in either male or female germlines. With that said, it did occur several times during our study when leaky expression was suspected. Though the molecular mechanism is not known, DNA modifications at the Ai65’s stop cassettes, either recombinase dependent or independent, may have caused the leakiness. More discussions are offered in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nNote: As expected based on Mendelian inheritance, the ratio for the occurrence of Ai65het mice from pups obtained from this step (step 3) is 2 out of 4. The chance that they are both FlpO positive and Cre positive is ¼ (½ × ½). So overall, the ratio of Cre+;FlpO+;Ai65het mice is only1/8. Similarly, the probability of obtaining Cre+;FlpO+;Ai65hom is 1/16 according to Mendelian inheritance. Note that Cre+;FlpO+;Ai65het and Cre+;FlpO+;Ai65hom can both be used for experiments, although native signals in the later is stronger due to presence of two copies of the Ai65 transgene.",
    "Note: The most critical parameter for a successful PCR genotyping is the design of primers. For Cre genotyping, we have compared several PCR primer pairs designed by us and by others and we found that a Cre PCR condition established in a previous report17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] was most reliable (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). In addition to Cre primers, a pair of internal control primers that recognize mouse Gabra1 gene were also included (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). For FlpO genotyping, a multiplex PCR designed by us produced robust results. In this reaction, the internal control primers recognize mouse Il2 gene (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Finally, for Ai65 genotyping, we re-designed a PCR strategy by using a 3-primer set instead of a 4-primer set used by the Jackson laboratory. In our design a 5′ reverse primer is employed to amplify 5′ transgene insertion at the rosa locus when it is paired with a 5′ wild type forward primer (AI-9020) to produce a 430 bp band. Since the wild type allele does not contain target DNA for the 5′ reverse primer, only the AI9020 and AI9021 primer pair can produce an amplification which is 300 bp (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Primer sequences are listed in Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\nUsing cre-dependent and Flp-dependent AAV to map multi-transmitter neurons in Cre/Flp intersectional mice\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nTiming: 1–2 h (for step 4)\nThis section describes the method using AAV to map glutamate and GABA co-expression neurons. It can be readily extended to other types of multi-transmitter neurons.\nCritical: Before the experiments, animal procedures for stereotaxic injection of AAV must be approved by the relevant institutions for animal care and use.\nInject AAV to the brains of 6–12 weeks old Cre+FlpO+ mice.\nMix equal amount of two viruses, AAV-Ef1a-DIO-EGFP and AAV-Ef1a-fDIO-tdTomato to the concentration of 1–3 × 1012 gc/mL of each.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2241-Fig4.jpg",

Cre+FlpO+ double positive cells are identified by expressing both GFP and tdTomato. In application 1, AAVs packaged with AAV9 capsids label cells in the injection sites. In application 2, AAVs packaged with AAV2-retro capsids label cells projecting to the injection sites.\n(D) Example of an experiment using AAV2-retro. Two viruses, AAV2-retro-DIO-EGFP and AAV2-retro-fDIO-tdtomato were co-injected into the dentate gyrus (red circles) of a VGLUT2-Cre+;VGAT-FlpO+ mouse. Labeled neurons were found in the lateral entorhinal cortex (ENTI), with a fraction of them expressing both GFP and tdTomato. Scale bars, 100 μm.\nNote: We constructed two AAV plasmids (Addgene #187112 and Addgene #187103, Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B) for making AAV-Ef1a-DIO-EGFP and AAV-Ef1a-fDIO-tdTomato.\nPerform stereotaxic AAV injection.\nNote: There are excellent protocols that give detailed instructions on how to perform mouse brain stereotaxic AAV injections18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] thus we will not repeat their procedures here but instead just give a short outline. Briefly, the whole surgery and injection process includes several steps and usually takes about 1–2 h to complete, depending on experimenter’s experience and the number of injections to make in each mouse.\nAnesthetize mouse (6 weeks–12 weeks) with ∼2% vaporized isoflurane with O2.\nMount the mouse on the stereotaxic frame, providing constant flow of ∼1% vaporized isoflurane with O2 through nose cone.\nMake scalp incision to expose the skull.\nLocate bregma and Lambda points and used these landmarks to set up coordination of the stereotaxic frame.",
    "Using software to choose the target sites. Make small holes on the skull above the target sites by using the drill attached to the stereotaxic frame (See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2241-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Stereotaxic apparatus\nComponents of stereotaxic apparatus: ML-Axis, AP-Axis, DV-Axis, drill, syringe, mouth and nose adaptor, mouse heating pad, Isoflurane intake tube and scavenging tube. On the back is the Neurostar controller box connected to a computer.\nLower the Hamilton syringe or glass injector (Nanojet III) slowly (5 mm/min or 1 mm/min) to reach the target sites by using the “go to target” function.\nNote: Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company) and Nanojet III injector (Drummond company) are often used for injecting AAV into mouse brain, with the Hamilton syringe been preferred for larger volume (0.1–1.0 μL) per injection site and the Nanojet injector been preferred for smaller volume (30 nl–100 nl) per injection site.\nInject AAV. For injection with Hamilton syringe, we use injection speed of 0.1 μL/mL, controlled by Neurostar system. For injection with Nanojet III injector, we use injecting rate of 3–5 nl/s, for total volume of 30–100 nl.\nWait 5 min then lift Hamilton syringe or Nanojet injector.\nClose scalp incision to finish the mouse surgery. Return the mouse to home cage. Provide post-operative care and pain management according to one’s approved animal protocol. In accordance with our protocol, we administer carprofen (2–4 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) to the mouse immediately after surgery and then again after 24 h. We monitor the mouse daily for at least two more days to ensure that the animal is fully recovered.\nAllow the mouse to recover from surgery and wait for 2–3 weeks for viral mediated gene expression.",
    "Note: Animals used in this study for AAV injections were 6–12 weeks old. The earliest time we checked for viral-mediated expression is 14 days after injection. We could detect expression of fluorescent markers without much difficulty for both AAV9 and AAV2-retro serotypes. However, we generally waited until 3 weeks after AAV injection, in an effort to maintain the consistency in data collection.\nNote: As an alternative to using Ai65 reporter mice for whole brain mapping, Cre dependent and Flp dependent AAV vectors can also be used to label co-releasing neurons in localized brain regions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). We and others have used Cre and Flp double-dependent AAV (AAV-Con/Fon-EYFP) developed by Fenno and colleagues for intersectional labeling.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] Details for using this virus can be found in other papers.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20],21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]",
    "Note: This protocol describes another strategy that uses co-injection of two viruses, a Cre-dependent AAV expressing EGFP virus and a Flp/FlpO dependent AAV expressing tdTomato, for intersectional mapping (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). We constructed two AAV plasmids (Addgene #187112 and Addgene #187103, Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B) for this purpose and demonstrated two applications.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] The first application is to directly label Cre and FlpO expressing cells in the viral injection sites. For this we packaged AAV-Ef1a-DIO-EGFP and AAV-Ef1a-fDIO-tdTomato with AAV9 capsids and co-injected 1:1 mixture of the two AAVs (∼ 1.0–3.0 × 1012 gc/ml of each AAV) to the Cre/FlpO intersectional mice (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, application 1). The second application is to label Cre and FlpO expressing cells that project to certain brain targets. For this application we packaged AAVs with AAV2-retro capsids11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] and co-injected two retro-AAVs to the target sites. As retro-AAVs are transported retrogradely from axon terminal and pre-synapses back to neuronal bodies, Cre and FlpO expressing neurons projecting to the target sites can be tracked (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, application 2). For both applications, we showed that co-injection of two viruses worked efficiently,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] because a single injection can label three cell populations simultaneously, the Cre positive, the Flp positive and the Cre and Flp double positive neurons (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). An example is provided in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D. Here we co-injected AAV2-retro-DIO-EGFP and AAV2-retro-fDIO-tdtomato into the dentate gyrus of a VGLUT2-Cre+;VGAT-FlpO+ mouse. We found GFP labeled neurons and tdTomato labeled neurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex (ENTI) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D, image panels). A fraction of neurons expressed both GFP and tdTomato (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D, rightmost panel), suggesting that they could be glutamate and GABA co-releasing neurons sending terminals to dentate gyrus.",
    "Note: Stereotaxic AAV injection has become a standard technique in neuroscience. We used Neurostar stereotaxic system which is a computer controlled motorized stereotaxic device (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). It is easier to make movements of the injectors and the drills by using Neurostar system compared with manual stereotaxic devices. Also, the Neurostar system uses algorithms to offset the errors caused by imperfect head mounting, making the injections more precise and more consistent than conventional stereotaxic devices.\nBrain fixation, sectioning, and IHC\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nTiming: about 2 days (for step 5)\nTiming: 2 h (for step 6)\nTiming: ∼1 week (for step 7)\nTiming: 1 day (for step 7a)\nTiming: 1 day (for step 7b)\nTiming: 1 day (for step 7c)\nTiming: 1 day (for step 7d)\nTiming: 1 day (for step 7e)\nTiming: 1–2 h (for step 7f)\nIn this step, brains are fixed, sectioned and immunohistochemistry is performed to fluorescently label the targeted cells.\nPerform PFA Fixation.\nPerform euthanasia.\nPFA fixation. Quickly open the skull, remove the whole brain and place it into a 50 mL Falcon tube. Wash brain once with DPBS and then add 5–10 mL of 4% PFA for fixation (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2241-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Brain fixation and sectioning\n(A) The brain is stored in 4% PFA immediately after dissection.\n(B) The brain is ready for sectioning two days after PFA fixation.\n(C) After making a cut at the inferior colliculi with a razor blade, glue down the brain to the sample plate.\n(D) Place sample plate in the cutting chamber and section brain at 80 μm thickness.\n(E) Collect brain slices into 24 well plates.\nFix brain with 4% PFA for 2 days in 4°C with slow shaking. After two days, the brain is ready for vibratome sectioning (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).",
    "Note: Fixation methods. We have tested two different fixation methods. This first method is to perform whole body transcardiac perfusion of 4% PFA. Following perfusion, brain was removed and allowed to stay in 4% PFA overnight for post fixation and before sectioning with vibratome. In the second method, we euthanized animal then quickly removed the brain and soaked it 4% PFA at 4 degree for 2 days and then performed sectioning with vibratome. We were surprised that two fixation methods yielded similar imaging qualities for us. Since transcardiac perfusion method takes much longer time, produces more PFA waste and post more safety hazard concerns to lab workers, we normally don’t use this method.\nNote: Fixation time. Two days after 4% PFA fixation for at 4°C, brains will get hard and become quite easy for vibratome sectioning (50–100 μm). We also tried 24-hr FPA fixation. At this time, the brains were a bit softer, and they were slightly more difficult to cut thin sections, compared with the brains fixed for two days. The longest fixation we tested was 7 days. Though we found that staining and imaging results were still fine, it is advisable not to wait for this long as over fixation can cause poor antibody staining and jeopardize tissue integrity.\nPerform brain sectioning with vibratome.\nWash brain with DPBS (10 min each time for 3 times) after 4% PFA fixation.\nPlace the brain on its ventral side and use razor blade to make a perpendicular cut at the inferior colliculi and then glue the brain down to the sample platform with superglue (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nPlace the sample platform into the vibratome cutting chamber, add enough DPBS buffer to submerge the whole brain (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).",
    "Section brain with vibratome at frequency of 60 Hz and 0.4 mm. s−1, with 80 μm thickness.\nCollect brain sections into 24 well plate with each well containing one brain slice (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E). For one whole brain, we typically collect 70–80 slices, in 3–4 24-well plates.\nPerform IHC in the 24 well plates. This ensures that serially sectioned slices always remain in the correct order.\nNote: It is not always required to perform IHC because native fluorescent protein signals from the Ai65 reporter or from AAV reporters can be bright enough for direct visualization of the labeled cells. However, we found that it is beneficial to perform IHC as fluorescent dyes such as Alexa dyes, Cy3 and Cy5 offer higher photostability and brightness compared to endogenous fluorescent proteins, making the imaging process easier and allowing samples to be stored for longer time.\nBlocking. Add ∼ 1 mL of blocking buffer (DPBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% donkey serum) to each well. Place the 24 well plate on a low-speed orbital shaker and incubate at 4°C for overnight.\nStain with primary antibody.\nRemove blocking buffer.\nAdd ∼ 1 mL of primary antibody solution (DPBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100).\nIncubate at 4°C overnight.\nNote: For this study, we used two primary antibodies: Goat anti-GFP (1:500; Abcam AB5450) and rabbit anti-RFP (1:500; Rockland 600-401-379).\nWashing. Wash once with washing buffer (DPBS) for 1 h at 20°C–30°C. Wash second time at 4°C overnight.\nStain with secondary antibody.\nRemove washing solution.\nAdd ∼ 1 mL of secondary antibody solution (DPBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubate at 4°C overnight.\nNote: In this study, we used two secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat (1:200; Jackson 705-545-003) and Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Jackson 11-165-152).",
    "Washing. Wash once with washing buffer (DPBS) for 1 h at 20°C–30°C. Wash second time at 4°C for overnight.\nMounting. Brains sections were mounted on glass slides (25 × 50 mm) with fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (EMS 17989). About 8 brain slices can be mounted on one glass slide (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2241-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Sample slide showing dual glutamate-GABA neurons in a mouse brain\n(A) Distribution of glutamate GABA co-releasing neuron in a VGLUT2-Cre+;VGAT-FlpO+Ai65het mouse is presented. Strong labeling was found in primary somatosensory area and piriform area. The original image was taken with 4× objective. The dimension of stitched file is 30,000 × 10,000 pixels. Scale bar: 1.5 mm.\n(B) Image taken with 10× objective showing layer 5 neurons at piriform area. Scale bar: 50 μm.\nNote: Antibody can be re-used many times. To prevent microbial proliferation in the antibody solutions, we add sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.02%–0.03% in our antibody cocktail.\nNote: The protocol we used here was modified from a protocol we previously developed for staining retina tissues, in which we used relatively longer blocking, antibody staining, and washing times. For brain tissues, it is possible to shorten the whole staining process to within 2–3 days although we haven’t tested it ourselves.\nVisualizing and acquiring images\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step is to acquire brain images. We used a Keyence microscope (BZ-X700) to acquire fluorescence images (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). This is an all-in-one fluorescence imaging microscope with ability to capture, at once, high resolution images of an entire brain slice, or even multiple brain slices. The computer-controlled automatic scanning process obviates the need to constantly change imaging areas manually, making the scanning of whole brain much easier. The steps for image acquisition are summarized below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2241-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Keyence microscope (BZ-X700) system",

Start with 4× objective for the whole brain scanning. 10× objective can be used later for higher magnification imaging.\nChoose appropriate fluorescence channels. If more than one channel is needed select “multi-color” button on the upper left of the screen.\nFocus sample and define scanning range.\nFocus the brain samples by click the Auto-Focus button. Fine manual focus function is also available if required.\nDefine scanning range by marking one by one the 4 outside corners of the area to be scanned with software using the “set edge points” functions that can be found at bottom sections of the control panel.\nImage acquisition and data saving.\nStart the imaging acquisition by clicking the “Start capture” button. With the 4× objective, it usually takes about 20–30 min to scan one slide (75 mm × 25 mm).\nWhen finished, execute image stitching function and export final images as Tiff format for further analysis.\nCritical: Make sure that Auto-Focus capture function is on as this allows the microscope to automatically adjust focus during acquisition."
