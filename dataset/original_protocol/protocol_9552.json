    "1. Proteolysis and Analysis of Reference Myoglobins\nProteolysis of reference myoglobins\n\t\nPrepare solutions of the purified reference myoglobins (range 0.2 - 0.5 mg/ml in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate)3.\nTransfer 1 ml aliquots of each sample to 2 ml centrifuge tubes.\nThermally denature the extracted proteins by heating the sample in a hot block at 95 °C for 30 min. Cool the sample for approximately 15 min until it reaches room temperature. Add 30 mg of urea (final concentration 0.5 M) to enhance the digestion, then mix.\nTryptic proteolysis\n\t\nPrepare a 1 mg/ml solution of trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and store on ice as required. Add a sufficient volume of trypsin such that the final enzyme activity is 420 BAEE (N-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester hydrochloride) units/mg of extracted protein, then mix by gentle vortexing and allow to proteolyze overnight at 37 °C.\nCarry out sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)17 to demonstrate the completeness of the proteolysis.\nDesalting of the post-proteolysis sample\n\t\nDilute the sample 1:2 v:v with water.\nActivate a polymeric reversed-phase (RP) cartridge filled with 30 mg RP material by adding 1 ml of methanol, then equilibrate the cartridge by adding 1 ml of 1% formic acid.\nLoad the sample onto the cartridge under gravity.\nWash with 1 ml of 5% methanol/1% formic acid under gravity.\nElute the peptides with 1 ml of acetonitrile/water (90:10 v:v; 0.1% formic acid) under gravity into 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes prefilled with 5 µl dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO).\nRemove the solvent under vacuum at 50 °C using a centrifugal evaporator for 120 min, then redissolve the residue in 250 µl acetonitrile/water (3:97 v:v; 0.1% formic acid).\nTransfer the solution to a low volume auto sampler vial.\n\t\tNote: Samples can be stored at 4 °C until ready for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis.",
    "Generation of transition lists for MRM\n\t\nLocate the myoglobin sequences for the different meats from the UniProt database.\nEnter the myoglobin sequences into the 'Target' box of the peptide and transition prediction software (e.g., Skyline). If required, hover over a peptide to reveal its fragment list.\nClick on 'Settings' and select 'Peptide Settings'. Input the preferences for the digestion (i.e., trypsin) and the number of missed cleavages (0). Enter the required selection for additional parameters, in particular, the peptide length (6 - 25), N-terminal exclusions (0) and assumed amino acid modifications (none).\nClick on 'Settings' and select 'Transition Settings'. Select the preferences for the instrument type used for the LC/MS analysis.\nClick on 'Export' and select 'Transition List' to create a spreadsheet containing the generated MRM transitions and parameters.\nAnalysis by LC/MS\n\t\nSet up a system of binary gradient (water (A) and acetonitrile (B), each with 0.1% formic acid v:v) high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with auto sampler, C18 core shell HPLC column (10 cm x 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm particle size) connected to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive electrospray mode with MRM detection.\nIn the data collection software (e.g., Analyst), select 'File' and 'New' and click on 'Acquisition Method' in the pop-up box then click on 'OK'.\n\t\tNote: This opens the instrument method editor, which contains a list of the connected devices that will enable the setup of a new LC/MS method.\nClick on 'Binary Pump' and input the flow rate value (300 µl/min) and the gradient times in the table, setting a binary gradient profile of 3% B to 30% B over 22 min, increasing to 100% B at 23 min for a 5 min wash out before returning to initial conditions and re-equilibration for a further 6 min.",
    "Click on 'Autosampler' and insert the injection volume (5 µl). Enable the 'Needle Wash Cycle' and enter the 'Wash Time' (30 sec) and select 'Flush Port'.\nClick on 'Thermostatted Column Controller' and in 'Column Oven Properties' set the 'Left Temperature' and 'Right Temperature' (40 °C).\nClick on 'Mass Spectrometer' and then click on 'Edit Parameters' to enter the source gas conditions. Select the 'Scan Type' as 'MRM(MRM)' and the 'Polarity' as 'Positive'. Go to 'Period Summary' and enter the 'Duration Time', the total time for the LC analysis and equilibration (35 min).\nIn the table right click and select 'Declustering Potential (DP)' and 'Collision Energy (CP)' to add these columns to the table. Enter the Q1, Q3, Time (msec), ID, DP and CE values for all of the transitions, for a single meat species, created in the transition list (see step 1.4.5).\n\t\tNote: Time (msec) refers to the dwell time, the time the mass spectrometer spends scanning each transition, the summation of which should not exceed 3 sec.\nSave the Acquisition Method file (file extension .dam).\n\t\tNote: Steps 1.5.2 - 1.5.8 need to be repeated for each meat species. This will create a single method file for each meat species in screen mode in preparation for analysis below.\nIn the data collection software, click on 'Acquire' and select 'Equilibrate'. In the box that opens, select the required Acquisition Method to begin the instrument equilibration.\nPut the sample vials in a rack in the auto sampler.\nClick on 'File' and select 'New' then 'Acquisition Batch'. In the 'Sample' tab select 'Add Set' then 'Add Samples'. Insert the number of samples to be analyzed and click on 'OK'. In the 'Acquisition' box select the method file that will be used for the analysis from the drop down menu.",
    "In the table, select 'Plate Code' and select the appropriate tray configuration from the drop down menu. Left click in the 'Plate Code' column header then right click and select 'Fill Down'. In 'Vial Position' enter the position of each sample in the auto sampler in the rows.\nIn 'Data File' enter the file name for the acquisition, then left click in the column header followed by right click and select 'Fill Down'. In 'Sample Name' insert the identity of each of the samples to be analyzed. Save as an acquisition batch file (file extension .dab).\nClick on the 'Submit' tab then highlight the samples that need to be analyzed on the LC/MS. Click on 'Submit'. Click on 'Acquire' and 'Start Sample' to begin the analysis.\n\t\tNote: Each acquisition method will scan for the MRM transitions across the entire length of the chromatograph for a single meat species. Mass spectrometer settings for an MRM acquisition vary according to instrument type and peptide.\nView the generated data files using data viewing software. Click on XIC (extracted ions) and in the drop down list highlight all the fragments (Q3 values) for a single precursor (Q1). A new pane will open that shows only the selected transitions.\nRecord the retention time (Rt) for groups of concurrent transitions since these correspond to a single peptide.\nRepeat the previous two steps for each set of transitions in order to assign the peaks to their respective peptides for each of the meat species.\nRecord the marker peptides which are suitable for providing species identification (e.g., peptide HPGDFGADAQGAMTK, precursor m/z = 752, Rt = 12.0 min, for horse), together with their retention times, and note which form corresponding pairs suitable for relative quantitation.",
    "Note: For example, the horse marker peptide (precursor m/z = 752) has a corresponding beef peptide, HPSDFGADAQAAMSK (precursor m/z = 767, Rt = 13.2 min).\nIn order to create a single dynamic method embracing all of the meat species, in the data viewing software, for each meat species in turn, open the XIC transition data for each precursor (assigned to a particular peptide in 1.5.8).\nZoom in on the peak cluster at the selected retention time by left-clicking and dragging the cursor underneath the cluster. Identify the most intense transitions (by right-clicking on the peak label).\nManually record the transitions and retention times in a spreadsheet.\nTo enter the parameters as a new dynamic method on the LC/MS software, click on 'Mass Spectrometer' and then click on 'Edit Parameters' to enter the source gas conditions. Select the 'Scan Type' as 'MRM(MRM)' and the 'Polarity' as 'Positive'.\nGo to 'Period Summary' and enter the duration time (set as the total time for the LC analysis and equilibration). In the table right click and select 'Declustering Potential (DP)' and 'Collision Energy (CP)' to add these columns to the table.\n\t\tNote: The 'Time' column now refers to the expected retention time (min) for each transition.\nIn the 'Edit Parameters' section of the LC/MS data collection software, check the 'Scheduled MRM' box. Input the Q1, Q3, Time (min), ID, DP and CE values for the transitions created in the spreadsheet (1.5.21) and save the Acquisition Method (file extension .dam).\n\t\tNote: This method typically reduces the number of MRM transitions to the 4 most intense for each peptide and scans only across the retention time window for each peptide peak, giving improved sensitivity and quality of the data. A 'dynamic' method is a 'guided retention time windowing' method, sometimes called scheduling.",
    "2. Preparation and Analysis of Calibration Samples\nExtraction of meat mixtures\n\t\nUsing meat previously frozen then ground into a powder, prepare a range of meat mixtures by weighing respective amounts of meat (total mass of about 300 mg) into 15 ml plastic centrifuge tubes.\nAdd 4 ml of extraction buffer (0.15 M potassium chloride + 0.15 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.5). Vortex for 30 sec. Extract on a lab shaker at room temperature for 2 hr at 250 cycles/min.\n\t\tNote: Cycles/min refers to an oscillatory motion.\nTransfer 2 ml of the extract into a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C at 17,000 x g.\nTransfer 200 µl aliquots of the supernatant (reserving a small amount for protein assay, see 2.2) into 2 ml centrifuge tubes and dry using a centrifugal evaporator (pre-set program: 50 °C, with no venting and 120 min duration).\nProtein assay\n\t\nTransfer 7 µl aliquots of the reserved supernatant (see 2.1.4) in triplicate into the wells of a 96 well plate.\nTransfer 7 µl aliquots of a series of protein standards in triplicate, range 0 - 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), to the same 96 well plate.\nAdd 200 µl of Coomassie plus protein assay reagent to each well.\nVisually compare the color of the sample wells with the protein standards to check the samples are in the range of the calibration standards. If necessary, repeat with diluted sample so it becomes in range.\nLeave the plate to stand for 3 min.\nBurst any bubbles that have formed with a hypodermic needle.\nAnalyze the plate on the plate reader using a standard endpoint protocol at a wavelength of 595 nm.\nDetermine the protein concentration of the samples using calibration data from the protein standards.",
    "Note: This is required for calculation of the amount of trypsin used in the tryptic digest.\nProteolysis of meat mixtures\n\t\nRedissolve the dried residue from step 2.1.4 in 1 ml of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution. Mix well on a rotamixer.\nFollow the protocol from step 1.1.3 to 1.3.7.\nAnalysis by LC/MS\n\t\nSet up the LC/MS as previously (step 1.5.1).\nCreate a new acquisition batch as outlined previously (steps 1.5.9 - 1.5.14), selecting the acquisition method created at step at 1.5.24 that uses a dynamic LC/MS method combining all of the meat species, and acquire the data for the digested meat samples.\nDisplay the full chromatogram in the data viewing software. Display the XIC for each transition set in turn. Visually confirm each cluster contains the requisite number of bell-shaped peaks at the expected retention time, thereby confirming the existence of the selected peptide.\nPerform quantitation using the data viewing software to integrate peak areas for each of the transitions of interest by double-clicking on 'Build Quantitation Method' in the Navigation bar.\nIn the 'Select Sample' pane select the 'Data File' and the 'Sample' to be analyzed to generate an 'Analytes' table.\nClick on the 'Integration' tab to display the first of the transitions (Analytes) to be integrated.\nClick on 'Analyte' box to display the drop down list of transitions. Select each transition in turn to display it and visually confirm the correct peak is selected for integration. To modify or force the integration, left click and drag the cursor over the target peak (this will be highlighted in green). Click on the 'Select Peak' button and click 'Apply'.\nSave the workspace as a method file (.qmf).\n\t\tNote: This creates a Quantitation Method file for subsequent calculation of sample peak areas.",
    "Double click 'Quantitation Wizard' in the Navigation bar. In the 'Select Samples' window create 'Quantitation Set' by selecting a single 'Data File', then one or more 'Available Samples'. Select 'Next' to display 'Select Settings and Query' box. Leave with defaults, select 'Next' to display 'Select Method'. From the drop down 'Method' box select the 'Integration Method' file created in step 2.4.8, then select 'Finish'.\n\t\tNote: This creates a 'Results Table', including transition peak areas arising from meat mixtures.\nSave the 'Results Table' (file extension .rdb), export as a text file (.txt) and open it in spreadsheet to review the data.\nPlot graphs of the percentage (by transition peak area) of one meat in another versus the measured percentage (w/w) of the two meats for the selected MRM for selected transitions from corresponding peptides, focusing on those cases where the two fragments contain the same number of amino acids as counted from the C-terminal end.\n\t\tNote: Identical fragments with identical fragmentation sites give optimal results.\nExamine the plots from 2.4.11 above. Either visually, or using a trend line tool in the plotting package, identify a group of plots which are both linear and of similar gradient. Use any one or more of these CPCP plus fragment combinations for calibration in real meat samples.\n\t\tNote: A plot showing an unusual gradient may indicate either peptide or fragment suppression with a consequent reduction in signal strength. Non-linear plots may indicate poor peak detection or other problems.\n3. Meat Samples\nExtraction of proteins from target meat samples\n\t\nWhere applicable, excise extraneous non-meat material from the sample using a spatula. For example, scrape away sauce and pasta from a chilled lasagna.\nWeigh 20 g of the meat into a metal beaker.",
    "Add 100 ml of 0.15 M potassium chloride/0.15 M potassium monophosphate buffer at pH 6.5.\nExtract the proteins by blending the meat in a high speed homogenizer for 1 min.\nFollow the protocol from step 2.1.4 - 2.3.2.\nAnalysis of samples by LC/MS\n\t\nRepeat step 2.4.2 to acquire data using the dynamic LC/MS method.\nIdentify the peptides from each meat myoglobin as performed in step 2.4.3.\nFor quantitation, use quantitation software to integrate the peak areas for each transition of interest, as outlined in step 2.4.9.\nFor identification of species in a mixture, record those marker peptides satisfying agreed criteria for numbers of transitions and signal to noise for those transitions.\nFor quantitation, use integrated transition peak areas as agreed from step 2.4.12 and, using percentage by transition peak area, calculate the percentage of myoglobin from the two species in the mixture.\nUse prior knowledge from the literature18 of likely myoglobin levels in the meats to estimate the relative w/w amounts of two meats present in the sample."
