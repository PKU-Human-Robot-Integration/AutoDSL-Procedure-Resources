Time may vary depending on the number of embryos obtained\nThis step describes the method for isolating fetal male germ cells.\nIsolation of embryonic testis.\nSacrifice pregnant female mice on appropriate embryonic day.\nNote: Although GFP in the Oct4-GFP transgenic embryos is specifically detectable in primordial germ cells from embryonic day (E) 7.5 onwards (Yoshimizu et al., 19992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), this protocol is designed for germ cell isolation from later fetuses (E15.5-E19.5).\nRemove embryos from pregnant females using 8.5-cm dissecting scissors and place in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 10-cm dish placed on ice.\nAfter confirming that the fetuses have stopped moving, transfer them to a new 10-cm dish.\nRemove the testes using forceps under a stereomicroscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2245-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Isolation of fetal germ cells at the stage of E19.5\n(A) Isolated fetal mouse testis. Bar = 1 mm.\n(B) Removal of the epididymis from a testis. Bars = 1 mm.\n(C) Collected testes after removal of liquid.\n(D) Cell suspension of testes before and after pipetting.\n(E) Cell filtering set-up using 40-μm cell-strainer and 50-mL tube.\n(F) Gating the main population of fetal testicular cells (R1) at the stage of E19.5.\n(G) Separation of germ cells (R3) and testicular somatic cells (R2) with GFP fluorescence intensity.\nTransfer the testes into a 6-cm dish with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin using a 1-mL micropipette.\nNote: Cut the end of the micropipette tip using scissors to allow the testes to pass through.\nNote: It can be kept for 20–30 min on ice, but further storage is not recommended at this stage.\nRemove the epididymis using a curved surgical needle attached to a shaft (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPreparation of single-cell suspension.",
    "Transfer the testes to a 15-mL centrifuge tube using a 1-mL micropipette.\nNote: Up to 20 testes from the same exposure group can be placed in a 15-mL tube.\nRemove as much of the medium as possible.\nAdd 1 mL of 1× Trypsin/EDTA and mix by repeated pipetting.\nRemove the 1× Trypsin/EDTA as much liquid as possible using an aspirator after the testes have settled to the bottom of the tube.\nCritical: Remove as much of the liquid as possible, because residual FBS in the medium will interfere with the trypsin reaction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAdd 1 mL of 1× Trypsin/EDTA and leave in a water bath at 37°C for 15 min with tapping in every 5 min.\nNote: During this time, set a centrifuge to cool to 4°C. Also, fill a 1.5-mL tube with 1.5 mL of FBS and place the tube on ice to coat the tube with FBS. This 1.5-mL tube is used to collect cells using a cell sorter.\nPipet 20–30 times using a 1-mL micropipette until no cell aggregates are visible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: The presence of cell aggregates will result in decreased recovery of purified germ cells. If cell aggregates remain, repeat pipetting until aggregates disappear. Fragments of the membrane surrounding the testis may remain, but it is not a problem.\nAdd 4 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS and mix by pipetting.\nSet a 40-μm cell strainer upon a 50-mL tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E) and filter the cell suspension.\nCount the cells once using a cell counting tool such as hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge the 50-mL tube at 190 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and suspend the pellet in DMEM containing 2% FBS at 1× 106–107/mL of all the tissue cells.\nPurification of germ cells.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension into 5-mL tube and place the tube on ice.\nRemove the FBS from the 1.5-mL tube prepared in step 2 and add 0.5 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS. Use this tube for collecting sorted cells.\nTo purify germ cells using a cell sorter, the main cell population is gated on a scatter plot by forward scatter (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A) to eliminate contaminated small materials including cell debris (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F, R1 gate) (https://www.bio-rad-antibodies.com/flow-cytometry-gates-regions.html?JSESSIONID_STERLING=3919B18883BCAC4B3C9CA7316CD6A8BC.ecommerce1&evCntryLang=JP-ja&cntry=JP&thirdPartyCookieEnabled=truehttps://expert.cheekyscientist.com/gating-strategies-get-your-flow-cytometry-data-published/[href=https://www.bio-rad-antibodies.com/flow-cytometry-gates-regions.html?JSESSIONID_STERLING=3919B18883BCAC4B3C9CA7316CD6A8BC.ecommerce1&evCntryLang=JP-ja&cntry=JP&thirdPartyCookieEnabled=true]).\nGFP-positive germ cells are then gated on a histogram of GFP fluorescence of the cells in the R1 gate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G). The less-intense peak at the higher GFP fluorescence (R3) and more-intense peak at the lower GFP fluorescence (R2) represent GFP-positive germ cells and GFP-negative testicular somatic cells, respectively.\nAlternatives: We used a Bio-Rad S3e Cell Sorter system. Other cytometers are likely suitable for this application once the proper filter/laser settings for detecting GFP have been implemented.\nNote: The number of sorted testicular germ cells varies depending on the embryonic day of the fetus. In our experiments, 1,000–3,000 cells per embryo at E19.5 can be recovered.\nAfter cell sorting, centrifuge the sorted cells in the 1.5-mL tube at 190 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and store the pellet at −80°C until DNA isolation.\nIsolation of germ cells from adult testis\nTiming: 6–7 h\nThis step describes the method for isolating adult male germ cells in specific stages. This protocol refers to the previous papers.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nIsolation of testes from adult mice.\nSacrifice adult male mice and remove the testes using 8.5-cm dissecting scissors (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and place in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 10-cm dish.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2245-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Incubate the tube in a water bath at 32°C for 25 min and keep mixed by gently turning the tube upside down every 5 min.\nNote: This step allows for loosening of the seminiferous tubules. Thread-like loosened seminiferous tubules become visible (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). During this time, pre-warm the tube containing Collagenase/DNase/Trypsin in the same water bath. Also, fill a 1.5-mL tube with 1.5 mL of FBS to coat the tube with FBS and place the tube on ice. This 1.5-mL tube will be used to collect cells purified using the cell sorter.\nFilter the testicular tubule suspension through a 40-μm cell strainer into a tube containing Collagenase/DNase/Trypsin (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) and transfer the remaining testicular tubules on the strainer using a small medicine spoon.\nIncubate the tube containing the testicular tubule suspension in a water bath at 32°C for 25 min. In the middle of the incubation, pipet 10 times using a 10-mL pipettor.\nAfter incubation is complete, pipet the cell suspension 10 times using a 10-mL pipettor and filter through a 40-μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 190 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and suspend in 5 mL of ice-cold GBSS.",
    "Centrifuge at 190 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and suspend in 5 mL of ice-cold GBSS containing 1% FBS.\nCount the cells once using a cell counting tool such as hemocytometer.\nAdd GBSS containing 1% FBS to adjust to 5×106 cells/mL, and transfer 2 mL of the cell suspension into a 15-mL tube.\nAdd 5 μL of Hoechst33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, H3570) and mix by tapping the tube. Incubate in a water bath at 32°C for 1 h with shading from light. Invert the tubes by upside down to mix cell suspension in the middle of incubation.\nPurification of germ cells.\nTransfer the stained cell suspension into a 5-mL tube and place the tube on ice.\nRemove FBS from the 1.5-mL tube prepared in step 5 and add 0.5 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS. Use this tube for collecting sorted cells.\nAdd 10 μL of propidium iodide (PI, BD, 51-66211E) and mix by tapping the tube just before sorting.\nPurify the germ cells using a cell sorter according to the previous reports.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nCells strongly positive for PI staining are first eliminated as dead cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D, P1 gate).\nThe main cell population in the P1 gate is further gated in a scatter plot by FSC-A and SSC-A as the P2 gate to eliminate cell debris (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E, P2 gate).\nA histogram of Hoechst Blue-H fluorescence for the P2 gate reflects cellular DNA content, and the most-intense peak (arrow in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F) reflects spermatids (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F, haploid), which should have the same fluorescence intensity by adjusting the voltage of Hoechst blue in each experiment.\nNote: Under our experimental conditions, the most-intense peak is always positioned at around 65. Additional peaks at around 100 and 150–190 should represent diploid spermatogonia and tetraploid spermatocytes.",
    "In a scatter plot of Hoechst Blue-H and Hoechst Red-H for the P2 gate, the population at the intersection of fluorescence intensity 65 of Hoechst Blue-H and Hoechst Red-H represents spermatids (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G, P3).\nDiploid spermatogonia which include both differentiated and undifferentiated subtypes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G, P4) and tetraploid meiotic cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G, P5) are assigned by the fluorescent intensity of Hoechst blue.\nCritical: To optimize horizontal widths of P3, P4 and P5 gates especially just getting started of experiment, the expression of typical marker genes is examined as described below for collected cells by different gating.\nAlternatives: Here, we used a Becton Dickinson BD FACS Aria II system, in which 488 nm blue laser and 616/23 band-pass filter for PI, UV laser and 450/20 band-pass filter or 670LP filter for Hoechst blue and Hoechst red, respectively, are equipped. Other cytometers are likely suitable for this application once the proper filter/laser settings for detecting Hoechst33342 have been implemented.\nNote: The spermatogonia fraction will have the lowest number of cells among the recovered cell fractions. We usually use mice at the age of P100-P200 and collect 1–5× 104 spermatogonia, 2–3× 105 spermatocyte, and over 1× 106 spermatid per animal.\nAfter cell sorting, centrifuge the 1.5-mL tube with sorted cells at 190 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and store the pellet at −80°C for DNA isolation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2245-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

This figure is modified form Tando et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Values were plotted as mean ± SEM of each cell sample from six F1 mice from two mothers. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test.\nNote: The purity of the cells should be confirmed by the expression of marker genes specific for each cell type in the recovered cell populations. We always aliquot and store one-fourth of the recovered cells for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis for Gfra1, Scp3, and Acrv1, which are the marker genes of spermatogonia, spermatocyte, and spermatid (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Primer sequences are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nRRBS library construction\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step describes a method for detecting DNA methylation in isolated germ cells by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), with particular attention to promoter regions.\nIn our study, for E19.5 germ cells, the sorted cells were pooled until they reached more than 10,000 cells, which is a sufficient number of cells for DNA extraction, and two tools were used as two biological replicates. For spermatogonia, two biological replicates are composed of the cells from one F1 individual from different mother.\nGenomic DNA isolation.\nAlternatives: In Tando et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] DNA was purified by Phenol/Chloroform method described here to remove proteins and lipids.

    "Collect the elution in a new 1.5-mL low-binding tube, being careful not to aspirate the beads.\nPause point: Eluted samples can be stored at −80°C for up to 1 year.\nQuality check.\nCheck the size distribution of the library using D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent, 5067-5582) and D1000 Reagents (Agilent, 5067-5583) by using the TapeStation according to manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/ScreenTape_D1000_QG.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/ScreenTape_D1000_QG.pdf]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2245-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Bioanalyzer electropherogram of the RRBS library\nUpper and lower peaks indicate the internal control.\nAlternatives: A bioanalyzer may be used instead of a TapeStation. If using a bioanalyzer, a high-sensitivity DNA kit should be used.\nNote: A main peak length of prepared RRBS library should be 150- to 350-bp (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). When the quality of the library is poor, the main peak is lower or invisible. If the main peak is detected over 400 bp (a problem of size selection by cutting the gel) or under 150 bp (adaptor contamination), the quality of the library is also poor.\nQuantify with KAPA Library Quantification Kit (NIPPON Genetics, KK4824) by manufacturer’s instruction (https://rochesequencingstore.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KAPA-Library-Quantification-Kit-Technical-Data-Sheet.pdf[href=https://rochesequencingstore.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/KAPA-Library-Quantification-Kit-Technical-Data-Sheet.pdf]). In this step, the library is quantified by PCR using primers specific to the library. NGS can be performed after this step. Store the library at −80°C until use.\nNote: From 20 ng of genomic DNA, which corresponds to about 4,300 cells, approximately 70 nM (approximately 1,400 nmol) of RRBS library is expected. Final library concentration should be confirmed to be sufficient for your sequencing platform. In our experiment, libraries were sequenced on an HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) with 100 bp single-end reads using a TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina GD-401-3001) and TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS (Illumina FC-401-3001). However, paired-end leads are also acceptable.\nThe Illumina platform provides 270–300 Gb/ flow cell, and approximately one million mapped reads /sample are needed.\nBisulfite sequencing\nTiming: 1 week",
    "This step describes a method for confirming accuracy of DNA methylation levels of candidate individual genes detected by RRBS in isolated germ cells. The data were obtained from four F1 mice from different mothers in each treatment group.\nGenomic DNA isolation.\nIsolate genomic DNA using the same protocol in step 7. If the purified genomic DNA for RRBS in step 7 remains, it is suitable for the following steps.\nMeasure the amount of DNA with Qubit dsDNA HS kit by manufacturer’s instruction as in step 7 and store at −20°C until use.\nBisulfite conversion.\nNote: This step can be performed using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, D5005) (https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/data/datasheet/ZYR/D5005.pdf[href=https://fnkprddata.blob.core.windows.net/domestic/data/datasheet/ZYR/D5005.pdf]). The protocol is mostly same as that in step 13, but there are some modifications such as incubation temperature, carrier RNA and elution volume.\nAdd 900 μL of sterilized ddH2O, 300 μL of M-Dilution Buffer, and 50 μL of M-Dissolving Buffer to the tube of CT Conversion Reagent in the Kit and mix with a vortex mixer for 10 min. If the mixture does not dissolve, heat it in a heat block at 64°C to dissolve it completely.\nThe following reaction solutions are added in an PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2245_31.csv\nPerform the following reactions in a thermal cycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2245_32.csv\nApply 600 μL of M-Binding Buffer and the entire Bisulfite reaction solution (150 μL) to the Zymo-Spin IC column, and mix by inversion.\nCentrifuge (20,000 × g, 1 min at 25°C), and discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 100 μL of M-Wash Buffer to the column.\nCentrifuge (20,000 × g, 1 min at 25°C), and discard the flowthrough.\nAdd 200 μL of M-Desulfonation Buffer to the column and incubate at 15°C–25°C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 × g for 1 min and discard the flowthrough.",
    "Add 200 μL of M-Wash Buffer to the column, centrifuge at 20,000 × g for 1 min, and discard the flowthrough.\nAgain add 200 μL of M-Wash Buffer to the column, centrifuge at 20,000 × g for 1 min, and discard the flowthrough.\nTransfer the column to a new 1.5-mL low-binding tube, add 11 μL of M-Elution Buffer.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 × g for 1 min for elution.\nNote: Store DNA after bisulfite modification at −20°C for short-term storage and at −80°C for long-term storage.\nPCR amplification (1st round).\nNote: We always design the primer sets for Bisulfite sequencing by using MethPrimer12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] (http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/[href=http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/]). In Steps 18 and 19, the optimal annealing temperature in PCR depends on the primers.\nPrepare the following reaction solution in an PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2245_33.csv\nPerform the following PCR reactions in a thermal cycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2245_34.csv\nConfirm a portion of PCR product by electrophoresis using 1.5% agarose gel.

Typically, 20–30 ng/μL of DNA concentration, and 1.7–1.9 of A260/280 ratio is acceptable.\nA (deoxyadenosine)-addition to gel extraction products.\nNote: Although an A is added to the 3′ end of the PCR product amplified by EpiTaq, the A may be occasionally removed during the gel extraction process. To ensure 3′ overhung by A before ligation to the vector, we perform A-addition before TA-cloning of gel-extracted PCR products.\nPrepare the following reaction solution in an PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2245_37.csv",
    "Add 10 μL of gel-extracted DNA prepared in step 20 and mix by pipetting.\nIncubate at 72°C for 30 min and place on ice after incubation.\nAlternatives: Other Taq DNA polymerase which allow the addition of a single base of deoxyadenosine at the 3ʼ end of PCR product may also be used for the A-addition.\nTA cloning.\nNote: TA cloning is a simple technique for cloning PCR products. A PCR product has an A overhung at its 3′ end, which is easily ligated to the vector with an T overhung at its 3′ end such as pGEM-T easy vector. This step is done to obtain single clones of the PCR product for sequencing.\nPrepare the following pre-mixture in an PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2245_38.csv\nMix the Pre-mixture and the A-added gel extraction products.\nNote: Calculate the amount of PCR product so that the molar ratio of vector-to-insert ratio is 1:3.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2245_39.csv\nLeave at 15°C–25°C for at least 1 h or 8–16 h at 4°C.\nThaw 100 μL of E. coli XL-1 Blue competent cells in a 1.5-mL tube and add 5 μL of ligation product.\nIncubate on ice for 20 min.\nIncubate at 42°C for 30 s, then place on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 900 μL of S.O.C. medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15544034) and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nSpread 40 μL of IPTG and 40 μL of X-gal on an LB agar plate.\nCentrifuge the E. coli solution after incubation at 1,000 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard 800 μL of supernatant, suspend the pellet by pipetting, and spread on LB agar plate.\nIncubate at 37°C for 18 h.\nPause point: LB agar plate with bacterial colonies can be stored at 4°C after sealing by film or tape up to 1 week.\nPlasmid purification (Nucleospin Plasmid EasyPure (Macherey-Nagel, U0727Q)).",
    "Pick a single colony from the LB agar plate with a toothpick and place them in a 15-mL tube containing 2 mL of LB medium and incubate at 37°C with shaking for 12–18 h. Sixteen colonies are usually picked. Background colonies can be checked by ligation and transformation with the vector alone.\nPurify plasmid DNA using Nucleospin Plasmid EasyPure according to manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.mn-net.com/media/pdf/0c/20/aa/Instruction-NucleoSpin-Plasmid-Easypure.pdf[href=https://www.mn-net.com/media/pdf/0c/20/aa/Instruction-NucleoSpin-Plasmid-Easypure.pdf]).\nAlternatives: Other plasmid purification kits or systems can be used to prepare plasmids.\nSequence the TA cloned product.\nPrepare the following pre-mixture in an PCR tube.
