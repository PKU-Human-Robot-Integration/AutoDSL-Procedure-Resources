For reference, we use cell cultures for the extraction of DLOs, POSs, and nucleotide sugars only when the number of trypan blue-positive necrotic cells is less than 10% of the total cell numbers.\nPreparation of cell homogenates for extraction of DLOs and POSs\nTiming: 4 h\nThis protocol allows for the separation of adherent mammalian cells into ethanol-insoluble fraction, which contains DLOs, and ethanol-soluble fraction, which contains POSs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Handling time should be minimized (as short as possible), because of the relatively labile nature of DLOs and POSs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/451-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
