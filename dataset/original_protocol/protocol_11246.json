Peripheral blood specimens were harvested from healthy volunteers with their informed consent.\n1. Preparation of materials\nStore reagents, antibodies, and chemicals as shown in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Dissolve the drugs or cytokines in solvents as stock solutions and then aliquot for storage at -20 °C or -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Detailed information for material preparation is noted in the Table of Materials.\n2. PBMC isolation\nWarm the density gradient solution (Table of Materials) to 18–20 °C before use.
