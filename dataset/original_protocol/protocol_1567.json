(2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and performed in Vora et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nPreparing target cells (GBM cells)\nPrepare luciferase-expressing target cells at a concentration of 3 × 105 live cells/mL of warmed basal XSFM with 75 μg/mL D-firefly luciferin potassium salt.\nAdd 100 μL of cell mixture per well in a tissue culture-treated, flat-bottom 96-well plate for a total of 3 × 104 live cells per well, plating 6 wells per effector: target (E:T) ratio.\nNote: Cells must also be plated for a lysis control and media-only control. Each sample and control should be run in triplicates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The media-only control adjusts luminescence readings for background signal and provides a reference of spontaneous death occurring in the target cells in the absence of effector cells, while the lysis control provides a reference of maximal target cell killing through the addition of a lysis buffer.\nNote: For all E:T ratios, target cell count remains constant while CAR-T cell count is adjusted. E:T ratios typically range from 1:1 to 10:1.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1134-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Layout for cytotoxicity assay with E:T ratios from 1:1 to 4:1",
    "Red and green represent wells in which CAR-T cells and control CAR-T cells are added, respectively. Yellow represents wells in which target cells are added without effector cells.\nRead the plate with a luminometer (measured as relative luminescence units or RLU) to ensure equal distribution of target cells. Luminometer (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech) settings should be as follows: bottom optic read, gain: 3600, time: 10 s.\nNote: Luminescence values should be within a small range of variability (<10%).\nPreparing CAR-T cells\nAdjust the CAR-T cell concentrations to 3×105 CAR-T cells/mL basal XSFM with 75 μg/mL D-firefly luciferin potassium salt. Plate 100 μL of cell mixture per well for a 1:1 E:T ratio, or adjust to a higher cell concentration for other E:T ratios to obtain a final volume of 200 μL per well.\nNote: CAR-T cells consist of live, CAR-transduced T cells. This can be determined by measuring transduction efficiency, calculated when producing CAR-T cells using flow cytometry (Tatari et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). For instance, if the CAR-T cell transduction efficiency is 80%, a concentration of 3.75×105 live cells/mL will yield 3×105 CAR-T cells/mL.\nFor lysis controls, add 100 μL of XSFM with 75 μg/mL D-firefly luciferin potassium salt and 1% nonidet P-40 lysis buffer.\nAdd 100 μL of basal XSFM with 75 μg/mL D-firefly luciferin potassium salt to media-only wells.\nPlate readout\nIncubate plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 4–8 h. After incubation, measure bioluminescence with luminometer using same settings previously described (step 8).\nNote: You may take multiple readings over 24 hours, however, increased cytotoxicity in control wells may occur as a result of non-specific effects. See troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for further details.\nTo analyze data, use the following equation:\n  %  specific lysis  =  100  ∗    spontaneous lysis RLU − test RLU   spontaneous lysis RLU − lysis control RLU",
    "Test: RLU of individual well for which percent specific lysis is being determined.\nSpontaneous lysis: average RLU of media-only wells.\nLysis control: average RLU of lysis control wells.\nCAR-T cell proliferation assay\nTiming: 4.5 days\nThis assay quantifies the proliferation of CAR-T cells upon co-culturing with tumor cells.\nCo-culture\nPrepare target cells at a concentration of 4×106 live cells/mL of basal XSFM and plate 250 μL per well in a tissue culture-treated, flat-bottom 24-well plate. One well is needed for each CAR-T cell being used.\nIn the same plate, add 250 μL per well of basal XSFM without target cells as media-only controls.\nAdjust the CAR-T cell concentration to 4×106 CAR-T cells/mL of basal XSFM and plate 250 μL per well.\nNote: CAR-T cells consist of live, CAR-transduced T cells. This can be determined by measuring transduction efficiency, calculated when producing CAR-T cells using flow cytometry (Tatari et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: This results in a 1:1 E:T ratio in co-culture wells.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24–48 h.\nPrepare cells for flow cytometry\nCollect cell solution from each well.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C and resuspend pellet gently in 1 mL of PBS.\nFilter cell suspension into a 12 × 75 mm tube through 35μm cell strainer cap.\nDetermine live cell concentration of each cell solution using Trypan Blue solution and aliquot between 500,000 and 1,000,000 live cells per well into 12 × 75 mm tubes, collecting three tubes per well.\nNote: Three samples are needed per experimental condition: CD3 antibody, isotype control antibody or unstained control, and a viability stain control. The number of cells used per sample can vary depending on cell availability but must be consistent throughout all samples.\nCell staining",
    "Centrifuge tubes at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells being stained in 100 μL of PBS with 2 mM EDTA (PBS-EDTA). Stain cells with the respective antibody as per manufacturer’s recommendations (i.e., antibody concentration, duration, temperature). Skip to step 24 for viability stain control.\nNote: Viability stain samples should be resuspended promptly after centrifuging, as leaving cells pelleted will reduce cell viability.\nAdd 1mL of PBS-EDTA to the tubes and mix gently to wash cells. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nResuspend all pellets in 150 μL of 1× 7-AAD viability stain (100-fold dilution of 7-AAD from stock in PBS-EDTA).\nIsolate T cells\nPrepare a 96 well plate with 200 μL basal XSFM per well (n = 3 replicates per sample). Sort CD3+ cells into the plate at a cell density of 1000 cells/well.\nNote: Cells should be gated by selecting live cells (7-AAD-negative population), then from this population the CD3-positive cells.\nAdd 200 μL basal XSFM as a blank in the same plate (n = 3).\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3 days.\nPlate readout\nAdd 1× presto blue reagent into all wells (20 μL into 200 μL well; 10-fold dilution). Incubate plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 4 h.\nRead plate for relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) at an Excitation and Emission wavelength of 544nm and 590nm respectively.\nNote: The presto blue assay is a measure of viable cells, but reflects differences in proliferation when same number of cells are seeded and culture conditions are constant as is the case with this assay.",
    "Proliferation is calculated for each well by subtracting the average RFI of all blank wells from the RFI of that well. Mean RFI can be plotted for each CAR-T cell being tested as a side-by-side comparison of proliferation in the presence and absence of target cells.\nCAR-T cell activation assay\nTiming: 30 h\nThis assay detects markers of activation on the CAR-T cell surface to assess activation upon co-culturing with target cells.\nCo-culture\nPrepare target cells at a concentration of 4×106 live cells/mL of basal XSFM and plate 250 μL per well in a tissue culture-treated, flat-bottom 24-well plate. Three wells are needed for each CAR-T cell being used.\nAdd 250 μL of basal XSFM per well in the same plate as media-only controls.\nAdjust the CAR-T cell concentration to 4×106 cells/mL of basal XSFM and plate 250 μL of the cell solution per well.\nNote: This results in a 1:1 E:T ratio in co-culture wells.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nPrepare cells for flow cytometry\nRefer to steps 18–24 for preparing and staining cells for flow cytometry analysis.\nNote: Three samples are needed per well: CD25/CD69/CD3 co-stained, isotype co-stained or unstained control, and a viability stain control. Subsequent co-staining can be done by repeating steps 22 and 23 for each antibody. Fluorescence minus one controls can also be used to improve gating accuracy, whereby cells are stained with all fluorophores except one. Doing this for each fluorophore reveals the spread of all other fluorophores into the missing channel and gates can be set accordingly.\nData analysis\nAnalyze the CD3+ population for CD25 and CD69 markers of activation.",
    "Note: Flow gating strategy: Forward scatter (FSC)-height vs. side scatter (SSC)-height is used as the initial gate to exclude debris. Doublet cells are excluded using an FSC-height vs FSC-width gate. Viability gate is set using 7-AAD to exclude non-viable cells. Isotype control or an unstained control is used to set the gate for expression of CD3, CD25, and CD69 where the gate is drawn to exclude baseline expression of fluorophores. Expression of CD25/CD69 is analyzed on gated CD3 population.\nThe percentage of T cells positive for each marker, in addition to MFI (median fluorescence intensity) per cell reflects the degree of activation occurring in the cells, which can be compared between CAR-T and control CAR-T cells to determine specificity of the CAR and any off-target effects that may be taking place.\nCytokine release assay\nTiming: 30 h\nThis assay measures cytokine levels secreted by CAR-T cells upon co-culturing with cancer cells.\nCo-culture target cells and CAR-T cells or CAR-T cells only at a 1:1 ratio in basal XSFM (repeat activation assay co-culture, steps 31–34).\nFor each well, transfer cells to sterile tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCollect supernatant and store at −80°C for cytokine analysis or proceed directly to step 40\nPerform flow cytometry quantification of TNF-α and IFN-γ cytokines using Cytometric Bead Array Kit (BD Biosciences). For a detailed protocol, please refer to the BD™ Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Human Th1/Th2 Cytokine Kit Instruction Manual (BD Biosciences, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Briefly, supernatant or provided cytokine standard solutions are serially diluted and cytokine bead suspensions are added. Beads are then washed and used in flow cytometry to quantify presence of TNF-α and IFN-γ cytokines."
