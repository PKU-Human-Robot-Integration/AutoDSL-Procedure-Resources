  "procedures": [
    "All methods described here were approved by the University of Washington Office of Animal Welfare and associated Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and were completed in accordance and compliance with all relevant regulatory and institutional guidelines.\nNote: Gene transfer to rabbit common carotid arteries is performed on rabbits by a surgeon with the aid of an anesthesiologist or assistant.\n1. Gene transfer to rabbit common carotid arteries: Pre-operation\nAnesthetize the rabbit. Weigh the rabbit. Combine 30 mg/kg ketamine and 2 mg/kg xylazine into a syringe. Inject ketamine/xylazine intramuscular (IM) in the paraspinous muscles to induce anesthesia.\nWhile waiting for rabbit to become anesthetized, prepare the preparation room and operating room (OR) tables.\n\t\nIn the OR preparation room: place the ophthalmic ointment and the fentanyl patch within reach of the preparation table; set up hair clippers and a vacuum for shaving the rabbit's neck and ear; set aside an alcohol prep pad, a 24G x ¾\" catheter, an injection port, and surgical tape to secure the intravenous line (IV) in the rabbit's ear vein.\nIn the OR: set up the monitoring equipment and position the probes [electrocardiogram (EKG), oxygen saturation (SpO2), temperature] on the OR table; prepare oxygen and isoflurane; tie gauze strip to the face mask to secure it to the rabbit and place the mask on the head end of table.\n\t\tNOTE: The gauze strips tied on the face mask should have 2 tails of about 45 cm each.\nTurn on the warming water blanket on the OR table. On top of water blanket, position a rolled towel for neck support and a dispersive electrode plate (later placed under rabbit's back).",
    "Set up the OR IV pump with 100 mL of a saline IV bag with an 18-19G needle attached and set the flow rate to 10 mL/h per kg.\nCombine 1 mL of lidocaine HCl (2% stock solution) and 1 mL of bupivicaine HCl (0.5% stock solution) in a syringe, to be used as a local analgesic.\nWhen rabbit is fully anesthetized, prepare the rabbit for surgery.\n\t​NOTE: Check for the lack of a pedal reflex (pinch a toe; look for limb withdrawal) to ensure anesthetic depth, and continue to monitor the pedal reflex throughout the surgery.\n\t\nApply ophthalmic ointment to eyes. Remove stool from the rabbit's rectum by pressing with gloved fingers on the lower anterior abdomen (above rectum) and moving fingers towards the anus. This will allow for later placement of a rectal temperature probe.\nShave the anterior neck from the sternal notch to the edge of the mandible while using a vacuum to keep the area clean. Also shave both ears for the IV placement and the fentanyl patch attachment, and shave a left rear middle toe for the pulse-oximetry probe.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol assumes that the surgeon is on the rabbit's right side for the entire procedure. If the OR setup places the surgeon on the opposite side, reverse sides in this step to keep the wires and IV opposite of the surgeon. The sides of future steps should also be switched as needed.\nWipe the left ear with an alcohol prep pad, place an 24G IV catheter into the left ear vein, cap with the injection port, and tape the catheter/port to the rabbit's ear to secure it. Apply a fentanyl patch (25 µg/h) to the rabbit's right ear.",
    "Transport the rabbit into the OR and place supine on the operating table with a rolled neck support towel under the rabbit's neck just below the head. Gently extend the rabbit's neck until it is straight and approximately horizontal.\nHook the rabbit up to the face mask with O2 on at 1 L/min, and start isoflurane administration. Secure the mask by wrapping the ends of the gauze strip tied to the mask around the neck support towel under the rabbit. Adjust isoflurane (typically 1 - 2%) as needed (based on heart rate, respiratory rate, and pedal reflex) to maintain proper anesthesia for the remainder of the procedure.\nEnsure that the dispersive electrode plate is centered under the rabbit's back. Place the temperature and pulse-oximeter probes and apply the EKG leads to the rabbit.\nHook up IV saline to the catheter port in the rabbit's ear, starting the saline pump at 10 mL/h per kg.\n\t\tNOTE: After 1 h, the saline pump can be reduced to 5 mL/h per kg.\nRestrain the rabbit's front legs by loosely tying them to the table. Optionally, place a small plastic table over the rabbit to protect the rabbit from being subjected to chest/abdominal pressure from the surgeon leaning on rabbit's chest/abdomen.\n\t\tNOTE: The small table may help prevent forced regurgitation of abdominal contents.\nInject 2 mL of previously prepared lidocaine (2% stock)/bupivacaine (0.5% stock) (50/50 mix) subcutaneously along the planned neck incision line for local anesthesia.\nLet the assistant prepare the surgical site with 3 alternating scrubs of chlorhexidine and isopropanol, and then a spray with betadine. Scrub, gown, and glove, following proper aseptic technique.",
    "NOTE: The surgeon should be wearing 2x surgical loupes to aid with the first half of the surgery. During the survival surgery it is vital to maintain sterility of the surgeon and the surgical field. Only the assistant should handle any non-sterile items, and sterilized materials must be aseptically passed to the surgeon or placed on the draped instrument table. Sterile towels can be used by the surgeon to maintain sterility while manipulating non-sterile equipment such as the microscope.\n2. Survival Surgery (Gene Transfer)\nPrepare instruments and sterile field.\n\t\nLet the assistant open the sterile drape pack containing a table drape, one paper drape for the rabbit, and several towels. Aseptically transfer the items to the surgeon.\nDrape the instrument table. Place the 6 sterile towels and the paper drape onto the draped table.\nWith 4 towels, drape the rabbit's neck, leaving only the surgical site exposed (approximately 4 cm x 10 cm). Lay the paper drape over the rabbit.\nLet the assistant open the sterilized instrument pack and place aseptically onto the instrument table.\nLet the assistant open the following equipment and aseptically place onto the instrument table or hand to the surgeon: three 1-mL syringes (and one needle if the syringes are not already loaded with needles), one 20 mL syringe, one 21G needle, one 19G needle, 3-0 polyglycolic acid (PGA) suture, 5-0 PGA suture, 7-0 polypropylene suture, and two 24G IV-catheters.\nSecure the electrocautery cable to the rabbit drape using the 7.25\" Kantrowitz Forceps and then drop the plug end off of the table. Let the assistant connect the cable to the electrosurgery unit and turn the power on.",
    "Fill a 20 mL syringe with sterile saline, drawn from an IV bag or vial held by the assistant. Use this saline as needed to keep exposed tissue moist during the procedure.\nPrepare one 1 mL syringe with 1 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, for washing the artery). For each carotid artery that will be transduced, 0.35 mL of diluted virus are needed. If the same virus is used for both sides, prepare one 1 mL syringe with virus diluted in DMEM to a volume of 0.7 mL. If different sides are receiving different viruses [for example a \"Null\" virus control on one side], prepare two 1 mL syringes, each with 0.35 mL of virus solution. For helper-dependent adenovirus, the virus concentration is 2 x 1011 viral particles (vp)/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Let the assistant prepare the virus. The surgeon draws up DMEM and virus suspension into sterile syringes.\nCut a hole in the drape. The size of the hole should be the same size as the surgical site on the rabbit's neck that is framed by the towels in step 2.1.3. Clamp the corners of the hole in the paper drape to the underlying towels that are draped over the rabbit's neck with the towel clamps.\nIsolate the common carotid arteries.\n\t​NOTE: 2x surgical loupes should be used for this part.\n\t\nCut the skin with an electrocautery along the midline extending approximately 7 - 9 cm cranially toward the mandible and clamp the skin open with towel clamps.\nMake a short lateral cut through the fascia with the electrocautery at the caudal end. Then insert the large scissors into the cut and bluntly dissect the fascia along entire midline. Cut the dissected fascia down the midline with electrocautery.",
    "With small dissecting scissors, dissect between the V-shaped muscles (sternocephalic muscle) and the sternohyoid muscle over the trachea, to expose the common carotid arteries, starting on the right side.\nDissect the right common carotid artery free from surrounding tissues, dividing all branches, from base of neck caudally to the crossing of the pharyngeal nerve cranially. Use surgical silicon loops to aid in retracting the artery during dissection.\n\t\tNOTE: Care should be taken to not disturb either the vagus nerve that runs parallel to the common carotid, or the smaller nerves that cross over the common carotid.\nLigate any large branches coming off the common carotid artery (1 - 2 per side) with 5-0 silk sutures prior to cutting the branch distally to free a 4 - 5 cm segment of the carotid. Cut ligated branches 1 - 2 mm away from the tie so that the tie does not slip off.\nRepeat dissection on the left side (steps 2.2.3 - 2.2.5).\nInfuse vectors into common carotid arteries.\n\t​NOTE: A surgical microscope (16X) is used as needed for performing arteriotomy, infusing vector/control solution, and arteriotomy repair.\n\t\nLet the assistant remove the surgical loupes from the surgeon and move the surgical microscope into position. Drape a sterile towel over the microscope to allow manipulation of the microscope without contaminating the sterile field.\nInject heparin [150 international units (IU)/kg] in the IV catheter and flush with 10 mL of saline.\nReturning to the isolated right common carotid, put two silk ties around the mid-portion of the mobilized carotid segment and tie a single overhand knot on each - without tightening them.\nBend the 19G needle just above the bevel to approximately 80° using the large needle driver (do not bend the bevel; Figure 1).",
    "Clamp the artery at each end of the isolated segment with vascular clips, placing the cranial clip first to allow for artery filling, and then placing the caudal clip.\nPuncture the common carotid artery with the bent 19G needle just cranial to the caudal vascular clip, taking great care to not puncture the back or side walls. Advance the needle tip into the lumen and withdraw it twice to make sure arteriotomy completely traverses the artery wall. Then carefully withdraw the needle.\n\t\tNotes: It is important to create an arteriotomy that penetrates all layers of the artery wall cleanly and does not dissect the artery wall (by passing axially through the adventitia and media). To accomplish this, the carotid should be punctured with the needle tip positioned as close as possible to a 90° angle against the artery wall (Figure 1). Carotid puncture at a 90° angle is aided by grabbing the artery by the adventitia with fine forceps and gently lifting the artery surface while pressing the tip of needle just caudal to the lift point. This maneuver also reduces the risk of hitting the back wall (Figure 1).\nUnfold and bunch-up several gauze pads into a nest on which to lay the syringe used for the infusions. Place the nest on the rabbit's chest caudal to the incision.\nPut an IV-catheter on the syringe that contains DMEM-only (not too tight) and bend the catheter ~4 mm from the tip so that the bend holds at about 75° after it is released.",
    "Insert the IV-catheter in the artery up to the bend point and wash out all blood from the artery with DMEM (~ 0.25 mL x 2). For each wash, fill the artery with DMEM, and then remove residual DMEM from the vessel lumen by gently pressing on the artery with a gloved finger, beginning just caudal to the cranial vascular clip. While maintaining gentle pressure, slide the finger from cranial to caudal. The luminal contents will wash out via the arteriotomy.\nKeep the catheter in the artery and exchange the DMEM syringe for the syringe containing virus solution. Make sure that no air enters the catheter.\nSlide the silk ties down the artery so that they surround the artery at the location of the catheter tip, but do not tighten them.\nInfuse 0.03 mL of the virus solution to push the remaining DMEM out of the catheter and then empty the artery. Collapse it by again removing all fluid from the lumen with a finger, cranial to caudal (as in step 2.3.9).\nTighten the two ties around catheter tip to seal the lumen. Infuse the virus solution (~ 0.25 mL; 2 x 1011 vp/mL for adenovirus) by pressing the syringe plunger gently until the artery is distended to physiological caliber.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that the artery expands to physiological caliber and remains distended during virus infusion. If not, the degree of gene transfer will drop significantly.\nGently lay the syringe down on the nest of the gauze.\nPlace a 7-0 polypropylene suture in the common carotid adventitia just caudal of the cranial vascular clip to mark the cranial boundary of gene transduction",
    "After the virus-containing solution has been in the artery lumen for 20 min, remove the virus-containing syringe and replace it with an empty syringe. Aspirate the virus-containing solution gently until the vessel collapses and remove the syringe. Cut or undo the silk ties and gently remove the catheter.\n\t\tNOTE: Cutting the ties very short aids in removing them. Remove the catheter carefully to avoid causing damage to the carotid endothelium.\nUsing the surgical microscope, close the arteriotomy with 7-0 polypropylene using an X-pattern (Figure 2).\n\t\t\nMake a first pass entering at the bottom-right of the arteriotomy and exiting the vessel at the bottom-left. Then cross the opening and make a second pass from top-right to top-left.\nBefore tying down the suture, flush out the artery by very briefly releasing the cranial vascular clip. Blood will flow out of the arteriotomy when the clip is released, removing air and residual virus from the lumen.\nPull the suture to gently close the arteriotomy and tie a suture with 2 square knots.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Pulling the suture too tight will cause bunching of the tissue that will disturb flow, increasing the thrombosis risk and altering flow which can be an important uncontrolled variable in disease models.\nRelease the cranial vascular clip, and then the caudal vascular clip using light pressure with gauze to stop any bleeding. If bleeding persists, continue pressure for 1 - 2 min. If the arteriotomy was properly closed, the bleeding always stops within this time frame.\nLet the assistant inject buprenorphine [0.02 mg/kg; subcutaneous (SQ)] at about this time to provide postoperative analgesia until fentanyl plasma levels become therapeutic.\n\t\t​NOTE: A second buprenorphine injection (0.02 mg/kg; SQ) may be needed 6 h after the first injection to maintain analgesia until fentanyl plasma levels become therapeutic.",
    "Repeat virus infusion protocol on left side following steps 2.3.2 - 2.3.19.\nWound closure\n\t\nUse a 5-0 PGA suture to close the midline fascia with a continuous suture.\nWith a 3-0 PGA suture, close the skin with an intradermal pattern using a buried knot at both ends.\nPost-operative recovery and cleanup.\n\t​NOTE: The rabbit must be monitored continuously for proper oxygenation and body temperature while recovering from anesthesia. Recovery should take place in a calm, quiet environment.\n\t\nTurn off isoflurane and oxygen flow and remove the face mask from rabbit.\nUnhook IV fluids but leave the IV port in place for emergency IV access.\nTake the rabbit to the recovery area and lay on its side in a cage with a warming water blanket turned on (or optionally a Bair Hugger heater).\nGive O2 by mask until the SpO2 is stable.\nLet the rabbit recover in a cage, flipping it to the other side every 15 min, until the rabbit can sit up on its hind legs and move around.\nWhen the rabbit is mobile, remove the IV from its ear before returning to the cage.\n\t\tNote: Do not return the rabbit to the company of other animals until it is fully recovered from anesthesia.\nDispose of anything that had contact with the vector or was in the operative field, following appropriate biohazard and sharps waste protocols.\n3. Gene transfer to rabbit common carotid arteries: Post-operative Care\nAssess the rabbit's overall condition daily after surgery, checking for wound healing, evidence of infection, appetite, respiration, and signs of pain.",
    "Check the rabbit's ear position (ears down can be a sign of pain or distress, especially when coupled with an untidy appearance). Check that the rabbit remains mobile and active. Check the rabbit for normal respiration without stridor. Check that the wound is clean, dry and intact. Check the rabbit for a normal body temperature. Consult veterinary services if the rabbit is not mobile and active, with normal body temperature, a tidy appearance, a clean wound, and normal respiration.\nCheck for normal food intake and evidence of fresh stool and urine.\n\t\tNOTE: Food intake may be decreased following surgery, but should return to normal within 2 days; provide supplemental food as needed.\nRemove the fentanyl patch on post-operative day 3.\n\tNOTE: Buprenorphine can be administered as needed for post-operative pain that is not managed by the fentanyl patch, or in case the fentanyl patch is removed early.\n4. Terminal Harvest Surgery: Pre-operation\nAnesthetize the rabbit. See sections 1.3 and 1.3.5 regarding achievement and maintenance of anesthesia.\n\t\nWeigh the rabbit. Combine 30 mg/kg ketamine and 2 mg/kg xylazine into a syringe. Inject ketamine/xylazine IM in the paraspinous muscles to induce anesthesia.\nPrepare the preparation room and OR tables while waiting for the rabbit to become anesthetized.\n\t\nIn the OR preparation room: setup hair clippers and a vacuum for shaving the rabbit's neck and ear.\nIn the operating room: setup monitoring equipment and position the probes (SpO2, temperature) on the OR table; prepare oxygen and isoflurane; tie a gauze strip to the face mask to secure it to the rabbit and place the mask on the head end of table.\n\t\t​NOTE: The gauze strips tied on the facemask should have 2 tails of about 45 cm each.",
    "Turn on warming water blanket on the OR table. On top of the water blanket, position a rolled towel for neck support and a dispersive electrode plate (later placed under rabbit's back).\nCombine 1 mL of lidocaine HCl (2% stock) and 1 mL of bupivicaine HCl (0.5% stock) (50/50 mix) in a syringe as a local analgesic.\nWhen the rabbit is fully anesthetized, prepare the rabbit for surgery.\n\t\nRemove stool from the rectum, as described in 1.3.1, to allow for later placement of a temperature probe.\nShave the rabbit from the sternal notch to the angle of the mandible while using a vacuum to keep the area clean. Also shave the left rear middle toe for the pulse-oximetry probe.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol assumes that the surgeon will be on the rabbit's right side. If the OR setup will place surgeon on the opposite side, reverse sides in this step to keep the wires opposite of the surgeon. The sides of future steps should also be switched as needed.\nTransport the rabbit into the OR and place supine on the operating table with a rolled neck support towel under the rabbit's neck just below the head. Gently extend the rabbit's neck until it is straight and approximately horizontal.\nHook the rabbit up to face mask with O2 on at 1 L/min, and start isoflurane administration. Secure the mask by wrapping the ends of the gauze strip tied to the mask around the neck support towel under the rabbit. Adjust isoflurane (typically 1 - 2%) as needed to maintain proper anesthesia for the remainder of the procedure.\nEnsure the dispersive electrode plate is centered under rabbit's back. Place temperature and pulse-oximeter probes.\nRestrain the rabbit's front legs by loosely tying them to the table.",
    "NOTE: Optionally, place a small plastic table over rabbit to protect the rabbit from being subjected to chest/abdominal pressure from the surgeon leaning on rabbit's chest/abdomen. The goal here is to prevent forced regurgitation of abdominal contents.\nInject 2 mL of lidocaine (2% stock solution)/bupivacaine (0.5% stock solution) (50/50 mix; from step 2.4) subcutaneously along the planned neck incision line for local anesthesia.\nSpray the surgical site with betadine. Put on clean gloves for surgical procedure.\n5. Terminal Surgery (Vessel Harvest)\nPrepare instruments and surgical field.\n\t\nOpen a clean drape pack containing a table drape and one paper drape for the rabbit. Drape the instrument table.\nOpen the instrument pack, place onto the instrument table, and arrange instruments. Place the following equipment onto the instrument table: one 20 mL syringe, and one 21G needle.\nSecure the electrocautery cable to the rabbit drape using the 7.25\" Kantrowitz Forceps. Connect the plug to the electrosurgery unit and turn it on.\nFill a 20 mL syringe with sterile saline. Use this saline as needed to keep the exposed tissue moist during the procedure.\nPlace the paper drape over the rabbit and cut a hole in the drape over the surgical site on rabbit's neck. Clamp the corners of hole in place to the rabbit's skin with the towel clamps.\nIsolate common carotid arteries.\n\t​NOTE: 2x surgical loupes should be used for this part.\n\t\nCut the skin with an electrocautery along the midline extending approximately 7 - 9 cm cranially toward the mandible and clamp skin open with towel clamps.\n\t\tNOTE: If harvest is only a few days after previous surgery, electrocautery is not needed. Just cut the sutures and gently pull open the incision from the previous surgery.",
    "Make a short lateral cut through the fascia with an electrocautery at the caudal end. Then insert large scissors into the cut and bluntly dissect the fascia along the entire midline. Cut the dissected fascia down the midline with the electrocautery.\nWith small dissecting scissors, dissect between the V-shaped muscles (sternocephalic muscle) and the sternohyoid muscle over the trachea, to isolate the common carotid arteries, starting on the right side.\nDissect the right artery free from surrounding tissues from base of neck caudally to the crossing of the pharyngeal nerve cranially. Use surgical silicon loops to aid in retracting the artery during dissection.\nRepeat dissection on the left side (steps 5.2.3 - 5.2.4).\nWith a 3-0 silk suture, ligate the common carotid artery cranial to the segment that was infused with the vector (use adventitial suture placed at first surgery to locate the cranial extent of vector infusion. Then ligate the carotid caudal to the repaired arteriotomy.\nExcise the carotid segment between the ligations, and flush the lumen with saline. Trim away excess adventitial tissue from the vessel and cut the carotid segment into smaller pieces for the different endpoint analyses (histology, DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein, explant culture, etc.).\nInject 1 mL of Beuthanasia IV to euthanize, and confirm euthanasia of the rabbit.\nDispose of anything that had contact with vector or was in the operative field, following appropriate biohazard and sharps waste protocols.\nSubscription Required.
