    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissection of embryonic mouse teeth from the lower jaw\nTiming: 3–4 h\nIn this step, developing tooth germs will be dissected from E13.5 mouse embryos.\nSacrifice the pregnant mouse at embryonic day (E) 13.5.\nDissect out the uterus; place it in a plastic Petri dish with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2776-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of tooth germs from the lower jaw of E13.5 embryos\n(A-G) See description in dissection of embryonic mouse teeth from the lower jaw. m, molars (in H and I); t, tongue (in H).\nNote: We strongly suggest to store the PBS solution that will be used in this step at 4°C (for up to one month) to slow down the degradation of the dissected tissues.\nNote: Petri dish with the embryos should be kept on ice.\nSeparate the embryos by cutting the uterus between the implantation sites with scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTransfer one embryo into a Petri dish with cold PBS and remove the uterus and the decidua by using forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUsing needles separate the head from the body (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nTransfer the isolated head to a glass Petri dish with cold PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nSeparate the upper and lower jaws (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G).\nRemove the tongue from the lower jaw in order to visualize tooth germs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nDissect developing tooth germs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I; as described in Pagella et al.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) and place them in another glass Petri dish with cold PBS.\nIn vitro culture of embryonic tooth germs",
    "Once dissected, embryonic teeth can be in vitro treated with the aim of studying the effect of the chemical disruption of a given molecule and/or signaling pathway on tooth development.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] In our study, we aimed to study the effect of Adam10 chemical inhibition upon tooth development.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] In order to do that, we placed dissected tooth germs on top of semisolid medium containing either the chemical inhibitor GI254023X (5μM) or vehicle (DMSO). At early developmental stages, at least 6 tooth germs can be placed in each Petri dish (plastic, 35 mm) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2776-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of the transplantation of embryonic teeth under the kidney capsule\nSchematic representation of embryonic tooth germs growing on top of semisolid plates (A) and their subsequent transplantation under the murine kidney capsule (B).\nTransfer the embryonic teeth from the cold PBS in the glass Petri dish to the surface of the semisolid medium in the plastic Petri dish.\nWith the help of a pipette (yellow tip) take one tooth at a time and place them on top of the semisolid medium.\nOnce all the teeth are placed in the Petri dish, remove the remaining liquid around each of them.\nIncubate them at 37°C until they reach the desired developmental stage (7 days in our experiment).\nNote: Developing teeth should be transferred to a fresh semisolid medium every 2–3 days.\nTransplantation of embryonic teeth under the murine kidney capsule\nTiming: 3–4 h\nIn this step, the in vitro cultured tooth germs will be transplanted under the kidney capsule of the immunocompromised host mice.\nInject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg bodyweight) subcutaneously to the recipient mouse 1 h before the surgery.\nAnesthetize the mice with the inhalation anesthesia (isoflurane) (see Note).\nApply vitamin A ointment to the eyes to prevent them from drying.",
    "Put the mouse on one side, and make an incision that exposes one kidney.\nMake a small incision to the kidney capsule by using forceps.\nThe capsule will be then lifted, and the embryonic tooth will be placed under the capsule in a way that the capsule keeps the graft in place.\nThe animals will be first sutured with absorbable polyglycolic acid suture, and the skin incision will be closed with a metal clip.\nPut the mouse onto a warming pad and keep it under observation until it reaches consciousness.\nBuprenorphine treatment should be applied the day of the surgery and until the third day after the surgery. Posture, stiches, and wound healing should be controlled during the days that follow the surgery. If signs of distress become apparent (poor appearance, inflammation at site of graft), the animal should be sacrificed before reaching the experimental endpoint.\nNote: Isoflurane will be used at 4%–5% for induction and 1%–3% for maintenance.\nNote: A piece of parafilm can be used to stabilize the kidney (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). With the help of laboratory scissors, a linear cut should be made in the middle of a rectangular-shaped piece of parafilm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Then, the parafilm should be placed in a way that the kidney stays trapped in order to prevent that it moves back into the abdominal cavity during the transplantation.\nNote: It is recommended to avoid drying of the surface of the kidney by adding sterile PBS."
