  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were performed following the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, 8th edition 2011) and approved by the local governmental animal care and use committee of the German State Office for Health and Social Affairs (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales (LaGeSO), Berlin; protocol no. G0030/18). First, congestive heart failure was surgically induced in juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats ~100 g body weight (bw) (see Table of Materials) by placing a titanium clip with a 0.8 mm inner diameter on the ascending aorta (aortic banding, AoB) as described previously29,30. At week 3 after AoB (Figure 1), debanding (Deb) surgery was performed to remove the clip from the aorta. The surgical procedures and validation of PH reversal in AoB rats performed are schematically depicted in Figure 1.\n1. Surgical preparations\nSterilize the required surgical instruments (Figure 2) by autoclaving.\nInject rat with carprofen (5 mg/kg bw) (see Table of Materials) intraperitoneally (i.p.) for analgesia 30 min prior to surgery.\nAnesthetize rat by i.p. injection of ketamine (87 mg/kg bw) and xylazine (13 mg/kg bw).\nRemove the hair from the animal's neckline and chest using an electric shaver.\nApply a drop of eye ointment to protect the eyes during surgery.\nPlace the rat in a supine position on a sterilized surgical table. Carefully fix the animal's abdomen and limbs with adhesive tape.\n\tNOTE: To maintain body temperature, place a 37 °C heating mat under the surgical table. Avoid heating of the head region to prevent drying of eyes.\nDisinfect animal skin with povidone-iodine/iodophor solution. Note scars and sutures from the primary AoB surgery and drape the surgical field.\nEnsure adequate depth of anesthesia by toe pinching.\n\t​NOTE: Depth of anesthesia needs to be controlled regularly during surgery.\n2. Tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation",
    "NOTE: Throughout the surgery, change gloves after handling non-sterile equipment.\nWith fine scissors (Figure 2A), make a 7-10 mm long cervical midline incision (Figure 3A).\nWith the help of a pair of blunt forceps (Figure 2B'), dissect the cervical soft tissue to expose the infrahyoid muscles. Split muscles in the midline to visualize the trachea. Cut and remove the suture from the primary AoB surgery.\nMake ~2 mm trachea incision between two cartilaginous rings using angled Noyes spring scissors (Figure 2C,3B). Insert the tracheal cannula of outer diameter 2 mm (Figure 2D) into the trachea and secure it with a 4-0 silk suture (Figure 2E,3C).\nConnect the tracheal cannula to a mechanical ventilator (see Table of Materials) while keeping dead space to a minimum (Figure 3D-E). Keep perioperative lung ventilation at a respiratory rate of 90 breaths/min at a tidal volume (Vt) of 8.5 mL/kg bw.\n3. Aortic debanding\nMake an ~20 mm long skin incision between the second and third ribs using fine scissors (Figure 3F).\nWith the help of smaller surgical scissors (Figure 2F), carefully spread muscles and cut them layer by layer (Figure 3G). Make a 10 mm lateral incision along the intercostal space between the second and third rib.\n\tNOTE: The midsternal line needs to be carefully approached to avoid bleeding.\nUse a rib spreader (Figure 2G) to expand the intercostal space between the second and third rib to create a surgical window (Figure 3H).\nWith the help of blunt forceps (Figure 2B,B'), carefully separate the thymus from the heart and conduit arteries to visualize the aorta with the clip (Figure 4A).\nHold the clip with the help of the forceps and carefully remove the connective tissue around the clip to expose it.",
    "NOTE: Avoid holding or lifting the aorta with the forceps, as it may injure the aorta resulting in bleeding and a lethal outcome.\nWith the help of a needle holder (Figure 2H), open the clip (Figure 4B) and remove it from the thoracic cavity.\nBefore closing the chest, open up lung atelectasis, ensure adequate lung recruitment without overdistension, continue mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 9.5 mL/kg bw for another 10 min, and return to a Vt of 8.5 mL/kg bw to recruit the lungs and resolve a possible pneumothorax.\nClose the deep muscles by a simple interrupted suture using 4-0 silk. Then connect the upper muscles and the skin with a simple continuous suture (Figure 5A,B).\n4. Tracheal extubation\nDisconnect the tracheal cannula from the ventilation machine. Attentively observe the rat until spontaneous breathing is re-established. If the animal fails to breathe spontaneously upon disconnection, reconnect the ventilator and continue ventilating for an additional 5 min. Then repeat the procedure.\nAfter spontaneous breathing is re-established, remove the cannula from the trachea and clean the liquid around the trachea with sponge points (Figure 2I) (see Table of Materials).\nClose the trachea with a simple suture using 6-0 prolene (Figure 2E' and Figure 5C). Then close infrahyoid muscles in a simple interrupted suture using 4-0 silk (Figure 5D), and connect the skin in a simple continuous suture (Figure 5E). Clean and disinfect the muscles and the skin during the process with povidone-iodine/iodophor solution.\n5. Post-operative care\nAfter completing the surgical procedure, carefully move the animal to a recovery cage with supplemental oxygen and an infra-red lamp to keep animals warm and sufficiently oxygenated during the recovery phase. Place the oxygen mask close to the rat's snout. Only keep one animal per recovery cage at any time.",
    "After the animal wakes up, carefully move it to a regular cage supplied with water and food. For the next 12 h, control the health status of the operated animal in 2 h intervals.\nAfter completing the surgical procedure, apply analgesia daily by i.p. injection of carprofen (5 mg/kg bw) for one week.\nTo avoid bacterial infection, administer amoxicillin (500 mg/L) in the drinking water for one week postoperatively.\nSubscription Required.
