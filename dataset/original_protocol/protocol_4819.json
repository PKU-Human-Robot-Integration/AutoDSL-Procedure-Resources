    "Prepare CE sample. Collect the dsDNA/dsRNA analytes into a micro-centrifuge tube, for example, a 200 μl volume micro-centrifuge tube. Dissolve or dilute the dsDNA/dsRNA analytes with 0.5x TBE (see Note 3).Prepare 0.5% HEC polymer solution (see Note 4). Take one micro-centrifuge tube, pipet into 100 μl storage 1% HEC polymer solution, then add into 96 μl 0.5x TBE solution and 4 μl 100x SYBR Green II. Mix the buffer solution by pipetting for several times. Split the 0.5% HEC polymer solution in another micro-centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the micro-centrifuge tubes for 5-20 sec so that the bubbles are removed from the buffer solution. In this case, we take the 0.5% HCE for an example. The concentration of polymer solution affects the separation performance of CPE greatly (Liu et al., 2015). Users are suggested to adjust the concentration of polymer solution according to the sample to be analyzed.Clean the inner wall of the capillary (Figure 2). Flush the capillary by ultra-pure water for ~30 sec using the vacuum pump. The sample will be injected at the cathode end of the capillary. In order to avoid inappropriate sample injections, we suggest placing the vacuum pump at the anode end of the capillary.Fill the 0.5% HEC polymer solution into capillary (Figure 2) as the same way of step 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160728/20160728191428_8093.jpgFigure 2. Schematic plot of filling the 0.5% HEC polymer solution into capillary and cleaning the inner wall of the capillary Set up CE parameters on the Labview interface: sample loading voltage, sample loading time, electric field intensity. When different samples are to be analyzed, those parameters are supposed to be optimized to achieve preferable separation.Inject sample. As shown in Figure 3, immerse the cathode of power supplier and the corresponding end of the capillary into the sample solution in a micro-centrifuge tube.",
    "Immerse the anode of power supplier and the corresponding end of the capillary into a micro-centrifuge tube which contained 0.5% HEC polymer solution. Make sure the capillary is well connected with the power supplier. Through the LabVIEW control software installed on the computer, set on the high voltage power supplier. So that the high voltage is applied on the capillary and the sample is injected electrokinetically.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160728/20160728191530_1954.jpgFigure 3. Schematic plot of injecting sampleStart CE separation. Remove the sample micro-centrifuge tube and place a micro-centrifuge tube which contained 0.5% HEC polymer solution in the same way. Make sure the capillary is well connected with the power supplier.The fluorescent signal can be monitored by the LabVIEW software during the CE separation process. In the first CE run, when the last signal is observed which is supposed from the last analyte, keep the CE process on for another same duration time in order to ensure no other signals appear. Save CE data. Proceed data analysis.Clean the inner wall of capillary following step 3. The clean-up prevents the next CPE run from contamination. If no more CPE run needed, it helps to maintain the capillary for long-term storage."
