    "1. Preparation for the single-cell shear assay\nCell culture\n\t\nSeed approximately 50,000 suspended single cells in a 35 mm x 10 mm Petri dish containing 2 mL of culture media.\n\t\tNOTE: Vortex the suspended cells prior to seeding to break apart cell aggregates.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C and allow between 10 to 48 h for cell attachment and complete cytoskeletal protein formation.\n\t\t​NOTE: Consider the duration of cellular attachment, as well as proliferation and growth rates, to ensure adequate cellular growth and attachment while avoiding cell aggregation. These parameters vary with cell type.\n2. Shear assay experiment\nPreparation of shear assay viscous flow media\n\t\nTo ensure a slightly viscous flow media (0.015-0.02 Pa·s), measure and add 0.05 wt% of non-toxic and non-allergenic methylcellulose (4  Pa·s) to the culture media.\nTo ensure a homogeneous mix, preheat the base culture media for ~10-20 min at a temperature of ~60-70 °C with a magnetic stirrer/hot plate. While continually stirring the media, gently add the methylcellulose such that it quickly disperses, to avoid coagulation of the methylcellulose particles. Allow this process to continue for ~15-24 h to ensure a clear solution of media + cellulose.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid excessive heating of the solution.\nTo measure the viscosity of the flow media, test ~0.5-1 mL of the representative flow media using a rheometer. From the readout, determine the fluid viscosity and utilize this value to represent the viscosity of the shear fluid medium (μ) to compute shear stress using equation (2).\nShear apparatus setup\n\t\nSet up the shear assay system of dual syringes (60 mL or 100 mL) connected to a programmable syringe pump for infusion and withdrawal of the viscous culture media (Figure 1).\nAttach both syringes to the flow chamber via 1/16 inch tubing and tubing connectors.",
    "Fasten a rubber gasket to provide a controlled, uniform flow on single cells along the flow path (Figure 1). The rubber gasket comes in different sizes depending on the flow profile to be attained (laminar or turbulent) and the desired area of observation (e.g., length of 22.5 mm, width of 2.5 mm, and height of 0.254 mm) (Figure 1).\nProgram the pump to infuse and withdraw a certain volume of fluid (e.g., 60 mL) at a designated rate (e.g., 1 mL/min) and select the corresponding syringes (e.g., 60 mL).\n\t\tNOTE: Account for the maximum infusion and withdrawal volume presets to avoid jamming or malfunction. Use equation (2) for the calculation of the required pump shear rate (assuming the required stress and viscosity are known).\nPre-shear setup\n\t\nFill the syringe with the prepared viscous flow media.\nAttach the syringe, filled with 60 or 100 mL (or as needed) of viscous flow media, and an empty 60 mL syringe to their respective locations on the programmable syringe pump. Via tubing and tubing connectors, connect both syringes to the flow chamber.\nTo ensure easy identification of single cells and a fastened connection between the flow chamber and the Petri dish, attach the rubber gasket to the flow chamber.\nAspirate the cell culture media from the Petri dish containing the cells of interest.\nWash off dead cells and loosely attached cells using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAspirate the PBS.\nInsert and fix the flow chamber and rubber gasket (~34 mm x 9 mm) onto the Petri dish (35 mm x 10 mm) containing the attached cells.",
    "Place the fitted microfluidic flow chamber + cells on a cultured dish onto an inverted microscope, with a microscope objective high enough to obtain high-quality images with high pixel values (usually between 40x and 63x magnification) and a display monitor.\nSelect the live image (time-lapse on some software) option from the microscope software on the display monitor. Ensure the microscope software on the PC has either a t (time-lapse) functionality or can take video recordings.\nFocus the microscope objective, ensuring adequate contrast and distinct cell edges. This is necessary for the image analysis post-shear. Move the microscope stage to ensure the cells are clearly visible on the display monitor and are live images.\nSelect a cell or multiple distinct cells within the imaging/flow path of the fitted flow chamber + Petri dish (the area/path created by the fitting of the gasket to the flow chamber).\nShear and imaging\n\t\nTo maintain a continuous uniform flow, select similar infusion and withdrawal rates and ensure laminar flow of the fluid, usually between 1 mL/min and 5 mL/min. For low laminar flow regimes, ensure a Reynold's number of Re < 100.\nClick on Run on the shear pump to inject and withdraw the shear fluid (prepared viscous media) at a continuous rate. Ensure that there are no bubbles during fluid infusion, as this might introduce external unaccounted stress on the cells.\nBegin recording a video by clicking record on the microscope software before the infused shear fluid makes contact with the cell(s) of interest under the microscope.\nContinue to record for 7 min, or for the desired duration of stress exposure, or until the cell(s) of interest shears off the bottom of the dish. Click stop recording on the microscope software when the run is completed as desired.",
    "Save the recording and extract as .tiff files. Preferably, extract images at 1 frame per second for facile analysis.\n3. Data processing\nDigital image correlation procedure (image analysis)\n\t\nIf the recording from the microscope was extracted as a video file, convert it to image frames (preferably .tiff file format).\nImport the images derived from the shear assay recording to Davis 10.1.2 software (DIC software) to track the movement of the naturally patterned structures of the cell by locating each block of pixel (subset) of the reference image in the respective new images (deformed images) (Figure 2).\nFor an optimized correlation, utilize a subset size of 31 x 31 pixels, a step size (deformation distance of each subset) of 20 pixels, and the sum of the differential track option, which tracks the deformation of a new image with respect to the last image. The result of this correlation is a strain-time plot (Figure 3) that can be exported as a .csv file for further analysis in MATLAB.\nMap out the region of interest for a chosen single cell. Select arbitrary points within the mapped cell to track deformation. For an irregular shape, such as the cell, use a polygon mask to map out the cell's geometry.\nAfter mapping, choose specific points on the cell (nucleus or cytoplasm) to be analyzed by clicking add strain gauge and drawing out individual strain gauges at points within the defined cellular boundary.\nClick on Run to begin the strain processing and obtain strain versus time data.\nDouble-click (or right-click) on the generated strain-time plot and select export data as a spreadsheet.\n4. Mechanical property characterization\nViscoelastic property characterization\n\t\nSave the .csv file containing the strain-time data from the DIC software in a separate folder for easy readability by MATLAB.",
    "Run MATLAB and click on the editor tab to open an editor page to write a code that reads the spreadsheet, cell by cell.\nChange the MATLAB path (the folder path that accesses the file of interest) to access the folder containing the data to be analyzed, for example, Users/Username/Desktop/data.\nOn the MATLAB editor page, access the spreadsheet data using the customized code. For example: a1= xlsread('data','run1','A4:A183'), where a1 represents the identifier, xlsread is the MATLAB function that reads the .csv file (in this case, as a spreadsheet), data is the file name, run1 is the sheet name, and A4:A183 is the range of data of interest in cell A of the spreadsheet data to be analyzed. For a complete fit, analyze x and y (time and strain, respectively). For example:\n\t\ta1=xlsread('data','run1','A4:A183');\n\t\tb1=xlsread('data','run1','B4:B183');\n\t\ta1 = x (time), and b1 = y (strain).\nIn MATLAB, click Apps | Curve Fitter | Custom Equation. Clear the representative custom equation and input the viscoelastic model equation [equation (1)], where ε represents the x variable and t represents the y variable.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65333/65333eq01.jpg     (1)\n\t\tHere, ε represents the strain, σ represents the shear stress, η1 represents the viscosity, E represents the elasticity, t represents the time, and τ represents the relaxation time, which characterizes the maximum time required for the cell to return to its original shape after primary deformation. It is expressed as τ = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65333/65333eq02.jpg, where η2 is the secondary viscosity term for the second dashpot (Figure 4).\nReassign new variables to the viscoelastic parameters within the custom equation interface. (ε, η1, E, σ, t, and τ = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65333/65333eq02.jpg) will represent (x, a, b, K, y, and c), respectively. Here, x and y are the independent and dependent variables, respectively. Shear stress (σ) can be determined using equation (2):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65333/65333eq03.jpg     (2)",
    "​Here, μ represents the viscosity of the shear fluid medium, Q is the pump flow rate, and w and h are the width and height of the flow channel shown in Figure 1C, respectively.\nClick on Select Data to select the Time (a1) and Strain (b1) for each set of data.\nEnsure the Auto Fit box option is checked. This runs the fit automatically when data (x and y) are selected.\nSelect the fitting methods to tighten the boundary conditions. Click on Advanced Options under the Methods category and select Nonlinear Least Squares. Under Robust, select Off, and under Algorithm, select Trust-Region. Leave every other parameter as it is.\nThe new variables post-fitting (a, b, and c) represent the viscoelastic properties, viscosity, elasticity, and relaxation time (η1, E, EQUAT), of the cell, respectively (Figure 5).\nLook for a high R-square value of the fit (R2 > 80%) to ensure that the data output can be considered a true fit of the viscoelastic model (Figure 3)\nSubscription Required.
