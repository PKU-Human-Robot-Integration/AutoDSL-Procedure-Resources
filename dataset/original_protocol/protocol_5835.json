  "procedures": [
    "The liquid chromatographic separation of NADH and NAD+ is accomplished using an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 pre-column (2.1 x 5 mm, 2.7 μm, Chrom Tech, Apple Valley, MN) attached to an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 analytical column (2.1 x 100 mm, 2.7 μm, Chrom Tech, Apple Valley, MN) at 40 °C.Elute the column with a gradient mobile phase composed of water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (ACN) with 0.1% formic acid (B) with a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and a total run time of 10 min. The elution is initiated at 100% A and held for 2 min, then B is linearly increased from 0% to 60% B for 4 min, 60% B is held for 1 min, and returning to initial conditions in 2 min, finishing with 2.8 min at 100% A.Auto-sampler temperature is 4 °C and sample injection volume is 10 μl. NAD+ and NADH should be eluted for 1.6 and 3.5 min, respectively. None of the other NAD+ related metabolites (including NADP, NADPH, ATP, NAADP, NAAD, ADP, cADPR, ADPR, nicotinamide and nicotinic acid) are co-eluted with either NAD+ or NADH.Tissue samples are prepared as the same manner as described in “sample preparation” for the cycling assay. Samples should be thawed on ice and they are diluted in water containing 500 ng/ml of internal standard.Samples for NAD+ measurement diluted 1:1,000 and 1:10,000, whereas the ones for NADH samples are diluted 1:1,000 in slick microfuge tubes. After dilution, the samples should be vortexed and transferred to 2 ml auto-sampler vials for immediate analysis."
