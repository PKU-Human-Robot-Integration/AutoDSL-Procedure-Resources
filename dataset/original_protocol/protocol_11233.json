    "All protocols herein described were performed in accordance with, and were approved by, the Queen's University Animal Care Committee. The frequency of behavioral testing can be weekly or monthly, or a combination of the two (i.e., weekly when one expects to see the biggest difference, and monthly elsewhere).\nNOTE: Murine behavioral studies are largely sex/age/strain- dependent, and therefore it is essential to collect the proper time points and to remain consistent across experimental groups. Environmental factors (e.g., scents, noise, temperature, humidity lighting, etc.) greatly affect behavior and anxiety in mice. Try to reduce these environmental factors as much as possible.\n1. Open Field Test\nNOTE: Prior to behavioral testing, the animals should be habituated to the room where the testing is to take place for 10 - 15 min prior to the beginning of testing. Ensure that proper personal protective equipment and all local facility guidelines are followed for the behavioral testing protocols.\nNOTE: No training prior to the test.\nEnsure that the computer and OFT program are on, running, and properly connected to the camera or open field box. Click on the smartware program, the open field icon, and \"OK.\" Chose the \"digital analog converter\" source from the camera options. Click on \"detection\" and make sure that the whole open field space is visualized and that the dimensions are 30 cm x 30 cm.\n\tNOTE: Equipment layout may vary depending on space constraints, but ensure that the computer and open field apparatus are near to each other in a well-lit room for proper video capture.\nClick \"calibration,\" \"snapshot,\" and then \"OK\" to make sure that the mouse is being detected within the confines of the open field. Click \"time\" to pre-set an amount of time to test the mice; in this case, set 5 min.",
    "Enter the subjects by clicking the \"subjects\" icon. Click \"scheduler\" and highlight all test subjects and then click the double green arrows and \"phase one, session one;\" this will bring in all of the subjects in order to begin collecting data.\nPlace a mouse in the center of the open field and click the \"start\" icon to prompt the program to begin recording. Test only one mouse at a time.\nOnce 5 min is complete, the program will automatically move to the next subject. In this case, remove the mouse that has completed the test and place the next subject into the open field. Click \"start.\"\nWipe down the equipment. Repeat steps 1.3 - 1.4 for the remaining test subjects.\nIn order to analyze the data once all the subjects have gone through testing, click on the \"analyze\" icon at the top right of the screen. Click \"analyze\" again and then \"summary report.\" Optionally, export the data onto a USB.\n2. Mesh Test\nNOTE: The surface area and size of the mesh on the MT may influence performance. On the MT, if a mouse falls off within the first 10 s during the first 2 collection time points, they will be put back on the mesh immediately for a second attempt. The mesh used herein was a wire mesh, with the mesh holes approximately 1.5 mm in diameter.\nNOTE: Running these tests at the same time of day is recommended, since physiological and biochemical parameters fluctuate throughout the day. Bodyweight may influence performance in this test and therefore must be taken into consideration.\nPlace a mouse in the center of a mesh and invert the mesh at least 20 cm above a clear container. Once inverted, start the timer.",
    "Time and record the time of latency to fall. If the mouse does not fall within 60 s, give it a score of 60 s and conduct no further trials. Allow the mouse to rest for at least 5 min. This is the end of trial 1.\nWipe down the equipment and during the 5-min inter-trial interval, test a second mouse, if required. Repeat steps 2.1 - 2.2 for trials 2 and 3, if necessary (as long as the mouse does not score 60 s, it should undergo three trials).\n3. Rotarod Test\nNOTE: The surface and diameter of the rod on the RT may influence performance. On the RT, if a mouse falls off within the first 10 s during the first 2 collection time points, put it back on the rod immediately for a second attempt.\nNOTE: Running these tests at the same time of day is recommended, since physiological and biochemical parameters fluctuate throughout the day. Bodyweight may influence performance in this test and therefore must be taken into consideration.\nTurn on the IITC rotarod and computer. Ensure that they are properly connected for data recording.\nMake sure that the program is running the accelerated protocol. Set the desired length of the rotarod test to xxx (the valid range is 000 through 999); in this case, press 300*. Set the number of lanes to be used to xxx (the valid range is 001 through 005); in this case, press 005*. Set the starting speed to xxx rpms (enter 3005 for 5 rpms; the valid range is 001 through 045); in this case, press 004*.",
    "Set the top speed to xxx rpms (enter 4,030 for 30 rpms; the valid range is 001 through 045); in this case, press 040*. Set the ramp speed to xxx in s (enter 5,030 for a 30-s ramp to top speed; the valid range is 000 through 999); in this case press 300*. Set the unit to mouse mode (enter 6001 for mouse forward and 6002 for mouse reverse); in this case, press 6001*.\nEnsure that all magnetized lanes are balanced before beginning the trial. Place one mouse in each lane of the rotarod.\nPress start to initiate the program. As the mice fall, remove them from their lanes promptly to ensure that they do not \"trip\" the other lanes.\nAllow the mice to rest for a 10-min inter-trial interval. This is the end of trial 1. During the inter-trial interval, wipe down the equipment and begin the trial for the next set of mice.\nRepeat steps 4 - 6 as necessary. If a mouse remains on the rotarod for the full 5-min trial, no further trials are required for that mouse.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
