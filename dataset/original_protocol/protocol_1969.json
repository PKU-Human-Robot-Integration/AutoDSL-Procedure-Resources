    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInstant fixation and preparation of single-cell suspensions\nTiming: 15 min/mouse + 30 min\nThe first part of the protocol describes how cells are fixed immediately after organ removal to deactivate kinases and phosphatases while preparing the single cell suspension.\nOrgan extraction and instant cell fixation.\nEuthanize mouse by an approved method (e.g., cervical dislocation).\nUse surgical scissors and forceps to extract spleen.\nImmediately squash the spleen and press through a 100-μm strainer into a Petri dish (ø 50 mm) containing 5 mL of fixative solution, using the plunger of a 2-mL syringe.\nIncubate cell suspension for 15 min at room temperature in fixative solution.\nCritical: Euthanasia, removal and processing of tissue should be performed without interruption one mouse at a time. The time between euthanasia and cell fixation should not exceed 5 min.\nCritical: The fixative solution has to be prepared within 30 min before use.\nCell filtration and red blood cell lysis.\nPipet cell suspension up and down a few times and filter through a 70 μm nitex mesh into a 15 mL conical tube on ice.\nAdd 10 mL of RPMI with 5% FBS into each tube.\nCentrifuge tubes at 450 × g for 5 min at 8°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspended cell pellet with 2 mL ddH2O and incubate for 2 min to lyse residual red blood cells.\nAlternatives: ACK (Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium) buffer can be used instead of ddH20 to lyse red blood cells.\nStop lysis by adding 10 mL of RPMI with 5% FBS to each tube.\nCentrifuge tubes at 450 × g for 5 min at 8°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 2 mL RPMI with 5% FBS.\nObtain cell count.\nNote: After fixation, all cells are dead. Therefore, all cells must be counted, not live cells.",
    "Adjust the cell concentration to 5 × 107 cells/mL using RPMI with 5% FBS.\nTransfer 5 × 106 cells per sample and well to a 96-well u-bottom plate. Use leftover cells for the single-color controls and unstained control.\nNote: If the cell population of interest is expected to have a very low frequency more than 5 × 106 cells may need to be stained. If so, antibody dilutions may need to be adjusted to ensure sufficient staining.\nStaining procedure and dephosphorylation\nTiming: 2-4 h followed by 8-12 h incubation\nThis section explains how to first stain epitopes of antigens that are methanol-sensitive and afterwards perform methanol permeabilization.\nStaining of methanol-sensitive surface antigens and methanol permeabilization.\nCentrifuge the 96-well plate at 450 × g for 3 min at 8°C. Dump supernatants and place the plate on ice.\nCritical: Dump supernatants in a 96-well plate by quickly inverting the plate upside down in a single smooth motion. Tap the plate once on a dry paper towel.\nResuspend each well in 50 μL Antibody mix 1 and incubate for 20 min at 4°C protected from light.\nAdd 100 μL TBS (always pH 7.5 in this protocol) to each well and centrifuge the 96-well plate at 450 × g for 3 min at 8°C. Dump supernatants and place the plate on ice.\nWash cells by resuspending each well with 150 μL TBS, centrifuging the plate at 450 × g for 3 min at 8°C and discarding the supernatants.\nNote: TBS is used instead of PBS to avoid providing phosphate ions.\nResuspend cells in 90 μL of ice-cold methanol (pre-cooled to −20°C) per well and permeabilize for 30 min on ice. Cover the plate to protect from light.",
    "Note: Permeabilization with methanol yields better signal than permeabilization with ethanol, acetone, saponin, or Triton after paraformaldehyde fixation in phosphoflow (Krutzik and Nolan, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCentrifuge the plate at 800 × g for 3 min at 8°C. Dump supernatants.\nCritical: From this point on all centrifugation steps must be performed at 800 × g to reduce cell loss during washing procedures.\nNote: After methanol permeabilization cell pellets are difficult to see in the wells.\nWash cells twice by resuspending each well with 150 μL TBS, centrifuging the plate at 800 × g for 3 min at 8°C and discarding the supernatants.\nResuspend cells in 200 μL TBS.\nIn this section of the protocol each sample is divided into 2 aliquots, one of which is dephosphorylated. The dephosphorylated sample is later used to quantify the non-specific staining background for phosphoproteins. All samples are stained with the same antibody cocktail that includes antibodies against methanol-stable antigens and phosphoproteins.\nDephosphorylation.\nSplit each sample into 2 samples by transferring 100 μL of each well to a new 96-well u-bottom plate.\nLabel one plate as “native” and the other plate as “dephosphorylated”.\nPrepare Dephosphorylation mix with λ phosphatase and Control mix without λ phosphatase.\nNote: We use λ protein phosphatase because it eliminates both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation. We have also tested calf intestinal phosphatase. However, in our experimental setting, it was less effective than λ-protein phosphatase in removing phosphate residues. Calf intestinal phosphatase also has a higher reactivity toward phosphotyrosine residues than phosphoserine/-threonine residues, which makes it less suitable for measuring, for example, phospho-IRF-3 (Ser396).\nCentrifuge plates at 800 × g for 3 min at 8°C and discard supernatants.",
    "Resuspend each well of the “dephosphorylated” plate with 30 μL of the Dephosphorylation mix with λ phosphatase and each well of the “native” plate with 30 μL of the Control mix without λ phosphatase.\nCover plates with an adhesive plate seal to avoid evaporation. Place the plates in an incubator at 37°C for 30 min.\nAdd 150 μL staining buffer to each well. Centrifuge plates at 800 × g for 3 min at 8°C and discard supernatants.\nStaining of methanol-stable antigens and phosphoproteins.\nResuspend cells in 25 μL blocking buffer. Block for 10 min at 4°C protected from light.\nCritical: The serum used for blocking has to match the host species of the respective anti-phosphoprotein antibodies if these are directly fluorescently labeled.\nAdd 25 μL of Antibody mix 2 to each sample.\nIncubate plates overnight at 4°C protected from light.\nPause point: 8–12 h incubation.\nAdd 100 μL TBS to each well, centrifuge the plate at 800 × g for 3 min at 8°C and dump the supernatants.\nWash cells twice by resuspending each well with 150 μL TBS, centrifuging the plate at 800 × g for 3 min at 8°C and discarding the supernatants.\nResuspend each well in a 100 μL staining buffer. The samples are ready to be run on a flow cytometer.\nNote: It is advisable to analyze samples on the same day.\nData acquisition and analysis\nTiming: 1–3 h\nThis part of the protocol shows how the data is acquired, corrected for background staining, and finally normalized.\nStartup flow cytometer and set PMT voltages using single color control and unstained control samples.\nAcquire 5 × 105 events for each sample.\nNote: In case of very rare cell subsets it can be necessary to acquire more events.\nAnalyze data in FlowJo.",
    "After compensation, gate on the cell population of interest and obtain the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for the phosphoproteins.\nSubtract the MFI of the dephosphorylated sample from the MFI of the corresponding native sample to obtain the ΔMFI. The ΔMFI corresponds to the true signal after background subtraction.\nCalculate individual fold change values as ΔMFIi = (MFIi, native – MFIi, dephosphorylated) divided by the average of ΔMFIi values obtained from the reference group in the experiment.\nPlot fold-change values in an analysis tool of your choice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1567-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
