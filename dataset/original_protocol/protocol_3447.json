    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn this protocol we describe all steps of the ATUM-FIB technique from tissue preparation to FIB-SEM imaging (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/334-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of sample preparation for ATUM-FIB\nCoronal sections (0.5–1.5 mm thickness) are subjected to en bloc rOTO contrasting and embedded in LX112 epoxy resin. Heated ultramicrotomy facilitates (serial) semi-thick sections that are conveyed onto conductive CNT tape (green). Short tape strips bearing serial sections are mounted onto glass slides (blue) for transmitted light microscopy using a slice scanner. Remounting onto a silicon wafer with adhesive carbon tape and attachment of conductive tape strips for grounding enables subsequent surface imaging by SEM. Target sections are selected and remounted onto a stub for FIB-SEM investigation.\nTissue embedding\nTiming: 4 days; 10 h curing\nThis step describes the en bloc staining and embedding into resin that can be partitioned into semi-thick sections (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). It is a variation of the standard rOTO (reduced osmium thiocarbohydrazide osmium) protocol (Tapia et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], Hua et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) omitting the final lead aspartate step (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_334_3.csv\nTwo alternative protocols for the Tapia rOTO contrasting without lead aspartate treatment (Tapia et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) are listed and can be chosen according to the availability of a laboratory microwave.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/334-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Scheme of the en bloc embedding procedure\nThe sequence of handling steps including tissue fixation, contrasting, dehydration, infiltration, embedding, and curing is sketched. Microtomy and FIB-SEM have conflicting requirements regarding heavy metal staining intensity and resin formulation that need to be balanced for ATUM-FIB.\nNote: We recommend the laboratory microwave protocol both for time and quality reasons. If no microwave is available the bench protocol works as well.\nTransfer tissue samples into a glass vials filled with 2–3 mL 0.1 M cacodylate buffer.",
    "Note: Reagent exchanges are performed without drying the sample at any point.\nNote: Carry out incubation steps on an orbital shaker unless otherwise noted.\nWash the tissue at least three times with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer.\nNote: If PBS was used for the perfusion, it is especially important to do thorough washing.\nThe buffer is replaced by reduced 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4\nWithout any additional washing step, replace osmium by filtered 2.5% potassium hexacyanoferrate in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer.\nThe tissue is washed at least three times with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer.\nIncubate in filtered 1% aqueous TCH.\nNote: The TCH solution should be slightly brown but not opaque.\nWash at least three times with water.\nIncubate in 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide.\nWash at least three times with water.\nTransfer tissue into a fresh glass vial with 1% uranyl acetate and incubate at 4°C 15 h and 2 h at 50°C.\nNote: Protect samples from light. Uranyl acetate is light sensitive and forms precipitates if exposed to UV light.\nDehydrate tissue in increasing ethanol concentrations (15%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 100%, 100% ethanol) by exchanges every 10–15 min.\nNote: Slow dehydration is crucial for good ultrastructural quality.\nPause Point: Store samples at max. 60% ethanol 24 h if absolutely required. However, we recommend preceding immediately.\nIncubate tissue in 100% acetone for 15 min. Repeat three times.\nPrepare LX112 resin (Ladd Research Industries):\nMix 10 g of LX112 with 6.45 g of DDSA and 4.35 g of NMA and stir for 10 min.\nAdd 0.3 mL of DMP-30 and stir for 20 min.",
    "Infiltrate tissue in LX112 resin: at least 2 h at different resin in acetone concentrations (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%) and 15 h and for another 4 h in freshly prepared 100% LX112.\nNote: Resin has to be prepared freshly every day. We do not recommend freezing and thawing resins.\nTransfer tissue onto parafilm-coated glass slides. Fill a plastic capsule with resin and invert it onto the tissue piece.\nCure resin blocks at 60°C for 10 h. The blocks are solid and should not be sticky anymore.\nPause Point: infinite\nGeneration of semi-thick sections\nTiming: 2–8 h\nThis step describes the heated ultramicrotomy procedure that is applied to generate semi-thick sections (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/334-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Higher magnification pictures are shown as views from the left side (middle) and as a top view onto the tape collector nose capturing serial sections on CNT tape (right). Figure reprinted with permission from Kislinger et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nFix the cured resin block in a sample holder for trimming.\nUse a Trim 90 knife to trim 400–800 μm at all 4 sides at a 90°C angle.\nNote: Trim at full speed but at a maximum thickness of 300 nm as this ensures smooth edges and good sectioning behavior. Remove resin chips immediately using a deduster.\nIncubate the sample holder in the oven at 40°C.\nInstall the infrared lights left and right of the diamond knife. Measure the temperature there and adjust it by varying the distance to the knife boat.\nFix the sample holder in the ultramicrotome.\nAlign the heated diamond knife to the sample block face.",
    "Start sectioning 100–300 nm sections until the full block face appears.\nHeat the knife to 40°C.\nNote: Be careful not to touch the heater as it can get hot if it is not completely inserted into the knife boat.\nInstall the CNT (carbon nanotube) tape into the Powertome. The tension target value is 2.7–2.8. Adjust the tension by running jog forward and backward.\nOptional: The CNT tape is glow-discharged by the vendor (e.g., Science Services or EMS) and can be stored several month. Hydrophilicity will gradually decrease and you can simply test it by adding a drop of water onto the surface. The better it spreads the more hydrophilic the tape surface. We recommend to freshly plasma treat the tape for better adherence of the sections especially after long-term storage over months.\nInsert the tape nose into the water bath and approach it to a distance of approximately 1–1.5 section lengths away from the diamond edge.\nAdjust the cutting thickness to 0.5–10 μm.\nNote: Thicker sections contain more information for subsequent FIB-SEM analysis but the sectioning characteristics are more complicated to control. Uneven thicknesses, cracks, and surface heterogeneities are more often observed in sections thicker than 5 μm.\nStart sectioning at 0.1–0.3 mm/s. Adjust the tape speed to 0.2–0.4 mm/s during cutting and to 0 during retraction. If needed guide the section onto the tape with a brush.\nCollect serial sections and control the proper section uptake by the tape.\nNote: It is recommended to stop cutting at any time and let the section flatten in the heated water bath for some seconds. Increase the cutting window if more time is needed for section uptake onto the tape.\nPause Point: months\nSerial light microscopy (optional)\nTiming: 1–2 days",
    "Light microscopy of serial sections described in this paragraph (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]; Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) is optional. This depends on the dimensions of the biological object of interest or corresponding landmarks and their visibility (e.g., blood vessels, cell bodies) in transmitted light microscopy. Semi-thick sections are heavily contrasted by the rOTO protocol itself and do not require histological poststaining methods in contrast to semithin (200–500 nm) sections. If no light microscopy is intended, CNT tape can be replaced by coated (conductive) Kapton tape.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/334-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Do not touch the sections.\nNote: For the autofocus function of the slide scanner, it is crucial to get all sections into a similar plane, which is ensured by the water attachment method.\nNote: If necessary, the tape strips can be additionally fixed by standard Sellotape.\nTransmitted light microscopy (Pannoramic Midi II)",
    "Load the series of glass slides into a slide scanner rack.\nIn the Pannoramic Midi II software load the first slide and manually or automatically label areas covering the tissue sections. Select sections by thresholding and image using the autofocusing and the extended focus level functions (9 focus levels, focus step size 0.2 μm × 5) using the 20× objectives. Set the autofocus range by testing it for several sections on different slide locations.\nSave the protocol for the respective slide and repeat step b. for all slides.\nStart the automated acquisition of all slides.\nNote: Depending on the structures of interest either the 20× or the 40× objective can be used.\nGenerate jpeg files of the individual sections manually from the original data using the Pannoramic software CaseViewer2.2 (3D Histech).\nNote: Steps 35 and 36 are exemplified for the given slide scanner but are highly dependent on the type of scanner available.\nPause Point: months\nSerial scanning electron microscopy\nTiming: 1–3 days\nIn this section, we list the relevant steps for serial scanning electron microscopy of serial semi-thick sections (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]; Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/334-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "(B) Mounting sections requires (max. three 2.5 mm wide) carbon adhesive tape strips that are glued onto a 4 inch silicon wafer (left). The covering transparent foil is removed. Using two forceps the CNT tape strips are detached from the glass slide (middle) and positioned onto the carbon tape. Once all (max. three) strips are attached to the carbon adhesive (right top) the foil is positioned on top and the sections are flattened using a roller (right bottom). For grounding narrow carbon adhesive strips are attached to connect CNT- and carbon tape with the silicon support. The schematic is shown at the bottom.\nPostcure sections on glass slides in an oven for 30–48 h at 60°C.\nPrepare a 4-inch silicon wafer by attaching up to three conductive carbon adhesive strips (25 mm width, Science Services) onto it.\nRemove the plastic covering the adhesive tapes and keep it.\nDetach CNT strips with tissue sections from the glass slide using forceps.\nAssemble CNT strips onto the adhesive tape. Be cautious not to introduce folds.\nCover the sections with the plastic foil kept from step 39 and smooth down the sections by hand or using a roller.\nCritical: The sections have to be in the same plane for the SEM autofocusing. Avoid pushing sections down too heavily to reduce the risk of introducing artifacts, especially for sections thicker than 5 μm.\nAvoid charging of the sections by attaching 1–2 mm carbon adhesive strips along the sides of the CNT tape, connecting it to the carbon conductive tape and the silicon.\nCritical: As semi-thick sections are more prone to charging compared to ultrathin sections, proper grounding is critical.\nStore the wafer under vacuum or in a dry container until imaging.\nPause Point: months\nLoad the wafer into a SEM (Crossbeam Gemini 340, Zeiss)",
    "Acquire serial section images using a backscatter detector (BSD) at 4 keV (high gain) at 7–8 mm WD and 30 or 60 μm aperture, 300 μA (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/334-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "Depending on the scientific question, target recognition requires either the 3D morphology of an object or specific ultrastructural features on any of the sections. Vasculature, cell somata or other structures in the range of 2–10 μm can be segmented and reconstructed using VAST (Berger et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nThe section(s) with the selected structure of interest have to be identified in order to subject it to FIB-SEM analysis.\nTransfer the section of interest onto a FIB stub (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/334-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.
