Preparation of cell culture and treatments for flow cytometry\nNOTE: Ensure aseptic technique is followed when handling cell cultures.\nGrow cell cultures in a humidified CO2 environment at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Ensure that cell culture is approximately 70% confluent in the parent flask before passaging cells for experiments.\nRemove the medium from the flask, wash cells with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and add 500 µL of trypsin to detach the cells. After the cells begin to round and detach from the flask, sharply knock the base of the flask on the bench to detach the cells. Then neutralize the trypsin by adding approximately 5 mL of fresh culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum before counting the cells. \nSeed cells at 15,000 cells/mL in 3 mL of cell culture medium in a 6-well cell culture plate. Incubate the culture plates overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to allow the attachment of the cells to the bottom of the well.",
    "Treat the experimental cultures with 100 ng/mL actinomycin D and the medium and solvent controls with fresh culture medium and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively, for 24 h. Collect the spent medium in a 15 mL tube and wash cells with 1x PBS. Thereafter, add the 1x PBS wash to the tube, and then add 500 µL of trypsin to the well. Next, neutralize the trypsin by adding 5 mL of fresh culture medium.\n\t​NOTE: (1) Prolonged trypsin incubation or incomplete neutralization may digest the cells and compromise their cell membrane, which may skew the results. In addition, it may also change cell membrane asymmetry and, thus, the accessibility to phosphatidylserine. (2) Cells that have detached and floated to the surface can be included in the subsequent analysis by centrifuging the removed medium at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspending the cells in fresh culture medium.\n2. Enumerating cells using the viability assay\nPipette 450 µL of propidium iodide in a microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 µL of the cell suspension to the microcentrifuge tube. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 5 min. Enumerate the cells by flow cytometry (refer to section 4).\nDilute all samples to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL with cell culture medium before proceeding to the apoptosis assays.\n3. Staining cells for flow cytometry\nNOTE: Sterile conditions are not required for this part of the protocol.\nDetection of phosphatidylserine externalization using Annexin V\n\t\nAdd 100 µL of cell suspension into a microcentrifuge tube. Add 100 µL of a 1:1 mixture of fluorescent conjugated Annexin V and 7-AAD reagent. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min, protected from light.\nAnalysis of mitochondrial membrane depolarization\n\t\nCentrifuge 100 µL of the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of 1x PBS, add 100 µL of TMRE staining solution to each sample, and mix the suspension by gentle back-pipetting.\nIncubate the cells for 20 min in a humidified CO2 environment at 37 °C. Wrap the samples in clean aluminum foil to protect from light.\n\t\tNOTE: Mitochondrial membrane potential is a functional marker that is sensitive to minor changes to the cell environment. Therefore, samples should be incubated and measured under identical conditions (temperature, pH, and time elapsed between the onset of incubation and fluorescent measurement) to maintain reproducibility). Also, note that inadequate protection of samples from light causes photobleaching of fluorophores resulting in falsely low emitted fluorescence. \nAfter incubation, add 5 μL of the 7-AAD staining solution to each sample and mix. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature, protected from light.\nDetection of activated terminal caspase-3 and -7 using caspase substrate DEVD\n\tNOTE: The following solutions are prepared before performing this assay.\n\t\nDilute the DEVD-bound DNA-binding peptide in DMSO to a ratio of 1:8 with sterile 1x PBS to make the caspase-detection working solution. Store the solution on ice or at 2-8 °C, protected from light.\n\t\tNOTE: Each sample will require 5 µL of this solution.\nAdd 2 µL of a 7-AAD stock solution to 148 µL of 1x PBS to make the 7-AAD working solution. Store the solution on ice or at 2-8 °C, protected from light.\n\t\tNOTE: Each sample will require 150 µL of this solution.\nCentrifuge 50 µL of the cell suspension for 5 min at 300 × g. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 50 µL of 1x PBS, followed by 5 µL of the caspase-detection working solution. Mix thoroughly.",
    "Loosen the cap of the tubes and incubate for 30 min in a humidified CO2 environment at 37 °C, protected from light. Add 150 µL of the 7-AAD working solution to each sample and mix. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature, protected from light.\nDetection of double-strand DNA breaks and total DNA damage\n\t\nCentrifuge 50 µL of the cell suspension for 5 min at 300 × g. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 500 µL of 1x PBS. Add 500 µL of a formaldehyde-based fixation buffer and mix. Incubate the samples on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 90 µL of 1x PBS in a microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 µL of the antibody solution to the microcentrifuge tube. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.\nAdd 100 µL of 1x PBS and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in 200 µL of 1x PBS.\n4. Run samples on the flow cytometer.\nVerify the analytical performance of the flow cytometer by running the instrument's system check kit. Do not proceed with running samples until all checks are completed and passed.\nLocate the desired assay by browsing through the catalog of pre-programmed assays on the instrument and select Run Assay.\n\t\nMix the sample by gently back-pipetting before loading the sample onto the flow cytometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Adequate mixing ensures cells remain in suspension and prevents low cell counts.\nFirst, load a negative control sample onto the flow cytometer, and select Run (Adjust Settings) so that the instrument begins aspirating the sample and provides a real-time preview of detected events. Refer to the Table of Materials for instrument name and details.",
    "Using the live preview, adjust the thresholds for fluorescence and cell size and draw a rectangular gate around the cell population. Drag the threshold marker to exclude cellular debris. Select Next (Set Health Profile) to proceed.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to know the size of the cells. Drag the sliders and observe changes in how detected events are plotted on the real-time preview, as this will inform an accurate selection of the thresholds. If cellular debris is not excluded at this stage, it cannot be removed in post-acquisition analyses.\nTap and drag the quadrant markers to separate the cell populations and so that the instrument plots detected events in real-time. Use these plots to guide the end-user on the appropriate placement of the quadrant markers. Select Next (Verify Samples) to proceed so that the instrument displays a summary of the settings. After reviewing the settings, select Next (Verify Settings) to apply these settings for all samples within the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: The instrument provides a 2-min live preview of cells used to adjust the instrument's settings. If this time limit expires, the instrument will release the sample, and steps 4.2.2-4.2.4 will have to be repeated. Remove the sample and mix well before reloading and continuing.\nGate a population of cells by drawing a region around the cell population. Adjust thresholds for fluorescence and cell size using the sliders located on the x- and y-axis of the live preview. Apply these settings for all samples within the experiment.\nMix the first sample by gently back-pipetting and load the first sample onto the flow cytometer and select Next. Name the sample and select Run so that the system begins running the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The instrument can only run one sample at a time.",
    "Once all samples have been run, save the experiment by giving it an appropriate title. Save the settings of the current experiment for retrieval in future runs (optional).\n5. Post-acquisition analysis\nIf required, perform fine-tuning of gates or quadrant markers post-acquisition.\nLocate the experiment that needs adjustment by navigating the system's file browser and open the experiment.\nTap on the thumbnail preview of the plot to enlarge it. Tap on the top-left or bottom-right corners of the cell gate to adjust the dimensions of the gate. To adjust the quadrant markers, tap on the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines to move the markers as they are. To adjust the angle of either line, tap on the line and drag the handle.\nAdjust the markers (as previously described in steps 4.1.3-4.1.4) as desired and apply these settings to all samples in the experiment by selecting the check-mark icon, marking all the samples, and selecting Accept.\n6. Statistical analysis\nRun tests in triplicate and run an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Bonferroni test to assess significant differences between the treated samples and controls.\n\tNOTE: The statistical test of choice is dependent on the investigator and the variables being analyzed."
