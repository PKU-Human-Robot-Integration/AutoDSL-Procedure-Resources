    "**Cell reprogramming with NF-κB pharmacological inhibitors** \n1) Retroviral vectors expressing human OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC were transfected in HEK-293T cells \\(5x10<sup>6</sup> cells per 10 cm plate each) along with packaging plasmids to produce retrovirus. \n2) Human primary fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 1x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 6-well plates. \n3) Twenty four h after plating, cells were infected with retroviral supernatants and the same procedure was repeated every 12 h for 2 days \\(a total of four additions) \\(Figure 1). \n4) The day after last infection \\(day 3), medium was replaced with fibroblasts medium, and kept for three more days. NF-κB inhibitors were added at this point and maintained along the reprogramming process \\(IKK-VII, 0.5 µM and sodium salicylate, 0.2 mM) \\(Note 1).\n5) At day 7, cells were trypsinized and reseeded on feeder plates \\(Note 2). \n6) On day 8, medium was changed to human iPSC medium. \n7) Cultures were maintained with daily medium changes for 4 weeks. At that point, colonies were isolated and expanded on a feeder layer or Tra-1-60 stained for evaluating reprogramming efficiency.\n**Cell reprogramming with NF-κB genetic inhibitors** \n1) Retroviral vectors expressing human OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, IκBα-SR or IKK2-KI were transfected in HEK-293T cells \\(5x10<sup>6</sup> cells per 10 cm plate each) along with packaging plasmids to produce retrovirus. \n2) Human primary fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 1x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 6-well plates. \n3) Twenty four h after plating, cells were infected with retroviral supernatants and the same procedure was repeated every 12 h for 2 days \\(a total of four additions). \n4) Cells were trypsinized at day 7 and reseeded on feeder plates.
