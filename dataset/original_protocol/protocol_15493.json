    "All experiments were approved by the National Animal Experiment Board.\n1. Preparations\nPrepare an anesthetic solution of ketamine-xylazine for anesthesia. Inject ketamine at 80 mg/kg and xylazine at 10 mg/kg by diluting 200 µL of ketamine (100 mg/mL) and 125 µL of xylazine (20 mg/mL) in 2,175 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl.\nPrepare an antalgic solution by adding 100 µL of Buprenorphine (0.3 mg/mL) in 4,750 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl to inject a solution at 0.1 mg/kg.\nPrepare the fluorescent staining solution.\n\t\nUse a fine scale to weigh 10 mg of fluorescein salt and dilute it in 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to obtain a 0.1% fluorescein solution.\nProtect the solution from the light and shake it for 5 min. Use a 10 mL syringe and a syringe filter of 0.2 µm to filter the solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The fluorescent solution has to be protected from the light and can be stored at +4 °C for 5 days.\nPreparation of the mouse\n\t\nWeight the mouse and induce anesthesia by performing an intraperitoneal injection of 10 µL/g of mouse weight (MW) of the anesthetic solution. When the mouse stops moving, place it on a heated plate (37 °C) and verify that it is completely anesthetized by pinching its toes.\nApply a drop of artificial tear on the eye undergoing the surgery and a drop of ocular gel on the contralateral eye.\nOnce the mouse is unresponsive to pinch, inject the analgesia at 5 µL/g of MW subcutaneously in the neck.\n2. Abrasion of the cornea\nFollow step 1.3 to prepare the fluorescent staining solution.\nFollow step 1.4 to prepare the mouse.\nBefore doing the abrasion, dip the ocular burr in 70% EtOH and then in PBS to clean it.",
    "Place the mouse on a heated plate (37 °C) on the side to easily access the eye undergoing the surgery.\n\t\nUse a cotton swab to absorb the artificial tear and brush the eyelashes away without touching the eye.\nTurn on the ocular burr, open the eyelid of the mouse with two fingers, and simultaneously block the vibrissae to avoid them getting stuck into the burr.\nLocalize the pupil or the center of the eye and apply the ocular burr on the surface of the eye, and do circular movements. By looking closely, the surface of the removed epithelium can be observed. Otherwise, do approximately 20 circular movements on the cornea.\nPut the mouse back on its belly and check if the ocular gel is still present in the contralateral eye.\nApply a drop of fluorescent staining solution on the abraded eye and wait for 20 s. Absorb the drop with a tissue without touching the eye and rinse it with a drop of artificial tear. Absorb the drop of the artificial tear with a tissue and illuminate the eye with the blue cobalt lamp.\n\tNOTE: The abrasion has to have a circular shape. It requires some training to obtain it.\nApply a drop of ocular gel on the abraded eye and let the mouse wake up on the heated pad. When the mouse is moving on its own, put it back in its cage.\nCheck the well-being of the animal during the following 2 days.\nAfter the use of the ocular burr, use a soft tissue to remove epithelial cells stuck into the head of the burr and dip it in 70% EtOH and then PBS.",
    "​NOTE: Once the epithelial cells are removed with the soft tissue, make sure that no pieces of tissue are stuck in the head of the burr.\n3. Axotomy of the corneal nerves\nFollow step 1.4 to prepare the mouse.\nPlace the mouse under a binocular loupe on the side to access the eye undergoing the surgery. Put the bottom of a Petri dish under the head of the mouse for the eye to be horizontal.\n\tNOTE: The following steps will be performed by looking through the binocular loupe.\nRemove the artificial tear with a cotton swab and remove the eyelashes without touching the eye.\nPlace smooth curved pliers under the eye of the animal in order to pop it out from the orbit. Make sure to close the pliers enough for the eye not to be able to go back in the orbit once pressure is applied, but not excessively to prevent optic nerve damage.\nApply the biopsy punch of 2.5 mm vertically on the eye without pressure to ensure total contact of the punch with the surface of the cornea.\n\tNOTE: Once the punch is applied against the cornea, the experimenter is blind.\nThen, start applying pressure and twist the punch several times.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the pressure, the number of twists may vary, but generally it is around 5. It requires training to feel the right pressure and movement. If too much pressure is applied, the eye ruptures. In this case, liquid can be observed exiting the lesion and the eye get soften. The animal has to be sacrificed.\nRemove the biopsy punch. A circle must be visible on the cornea where the biopsy punch was applied.\n\tNOTE: The next steps do not require the binocular loupe.",
    "Check if the contralateral eye still has ocular gel and apply some on the axotomized eye.\nLet the mouse wake up on a heated pad (37 °C) and put it back in its cage when it is moving on its own.\nCheck the well-being of the animal during the following 2 days.\n4. Cornea whole-mount processing\nSample collection and fixation.\n\t\nWeigh the mouse and induce anesthesia by performing an intraperitoneal injection of 10 µL/g of mouse weight (MW) of the anesthetic solution.\nWhen the mouse stops moving and does not have reflexes by toe pinching, perform a cervical dislocation.\nPop the eye out of the orbit using two fingers and enucleate the eye by cutting the optic nerve using curved scissors.\nPlace the eye in a 2 mL plastic tube containing PBS.\nFix the eye by replacing the PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde and placing it on a shaker (30 rpm) at room temperature (RT) for 20 min.\nRinse 3 times for 10 min with PBS at RT on a shaker (30 rpm).\nDissection of the cornea\n\t\nPlace a drop of PBS on a piece of parafilm inside a Petri dish.\nPlace the eye in this drop of PBS.\nPlace the Petri dish under the binocular loupe.\nDissect the cornea using microdissection scissors and forceps. Cut above the ciliary body to keep the limbus.\nRemove the lens, the ciliary body, and the iris with fine forceps.\nPlace the cornea back into a 2 mL plastic tube.\nImmunofluorescence protocol\n\t\nIncubate the cornea in 2 mL of 2.5% fish skin gelatine, 5% goat serum, and 0.5% detergent in PBS for 1 h at RT on a shaker (30 rpm).",
    "Incubate the cornea in 150 µL of a solution of 2.5% fish skin gelatine, 5% goat serum, and 0.1% detergent in PBS containing the primary antibody diluted at 1/1000 (anti βIII tubulin antibody) overnight at 4 °C on a shaker (30 rpm).\nRinse 3 times for 1 h with 0.1% detergent in PBS at RT on a shaker (30 rpm).\nIncubate the cornea in the same solution as for step 4.3.2, containing the secondary antibody diluted at 1/500 overnight at 4 °C on a shaker (30 rpm).\nRinse 3 times for 1 h with PBS at RT on a shaker (30 rpm).\nIncubate the cornea for 10 min with 150 µL of DNA intercalator diluted at 1/5000 at RT on a shaker (30 rpm).\nRinse 2 times for 5 min with PBS.\nMounting of the cornea\n\t\nPlace the cornea on a slide, epithelium facing the slide, and use a scalpel to create four sections without reaching the center.\n\t\tNOTE: Do the sections opposite to each other to form a flower shape.\nPlace the cornea endothelium facing the slide and remove the PBS around the cornea using a tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not remove the PBS under the cornea; otherwise, air bubbles may appear. If so, add PBS to the cornea and remove the air bubble. Then restart from step 4.3.2.\nAdd model paste on the four corners of a rectangular coverslip.\n\t\tNOTE: The model paste elevates the coverslip as the cornea is a thick tissue.\nDrop 50 µL of a mounting medium on the cornea and lay carefully the coverslip above to avoid bubble formation.\nSeal the coverslip with nail polish.\nImaging\n\t\nPlace the slide under an epifluorescent microscope.\nDefine the size of the mosaic and the depth of the image and start the acquisition.",
    "Apply a deblurring and deconvolution program on the acquired image.\n\t\t​NOTE: Step 4.6.3 is an option selected on the acquisition software (Large Volume Computational Clearing [LVCC])\n5. Localized laser ablation of corneal nerves\nTurn on the upright multiphoton microscope and the laser combined with an optical parametric oscillator. Activate the heated stage of the microscope (37 °C) and set the lasers at 850 nm and 1100 nm, corresponding to the required wavelengths for the mouse model.\nUse a power meter to set the power of the lasers simultaneously at around 20 mW.\nFollow step 1.4 to prepare the mouse and apply ocular gel on both eyes.\n\tNOTE: The animal used for this protocol has to be from a transgenic mouse line (MAGIC-Marker transgenic mouse21) that expresses an endogenous fluorophore in the corneal nerve fibers.\nInstall the animal in a head holder. Turn the animal 90° for the eye of interest to face the ceiling.\nStrap the vibrissae of the animal to clear the eye area. Strap the animal's body to lessen the head movement induced by breathing.\nPosition a circular coverslip on the eye above the ocular gel. The coverslip has to be horizontal. Do not hesitate to move the head of the animal for the coverslip to be positioned correctly.\nAdd a drop of PBS above the coverslip. Place the animal on the microscope stage carefully and set the objective turret at the right distance.\nUse the aqueous 20x objective and epifluorescence to localize the eye and the innervation through the eyepiece.\nActivate the lasers and define the depth that needs to be illuminated.\nAcquire 1024 x 1024 (pixels) image at an acquisition speed of 70%-85% of the maximum scan speed.",
    "Once the image is acquired, take the animal off the microscope and remove the coverslip and the straps. Remove the animal from the head holder, add more ocular gel if needed, and let it wake up in a cage on a heated plate.\n\tNOTE: Destruction of the innervation can be observed 1 week after the imaging. This protocol can be repeated once a week for several weeks to increase the damage caused by the lasers.\nWhen the animal is moving on its own, put the cage back in the stable and check its well-being for the following 2 days.\nSubscription Required.
