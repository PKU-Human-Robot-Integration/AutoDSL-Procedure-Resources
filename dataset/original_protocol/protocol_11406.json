    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine.\n1. Tumor Harvest and Digestion\nNOTE: The time required for harvest is ~3 - 5 min/tumor, and the time required for processing is ~1 h + 2 - 3 min/tumor.\nEuthanize mice by carbon dioxide inhalation and spray each mouse down with 70% ethanol before harvesting to prevent hair contamination. Surgically remove subcutaneous tumors from the mice and ensure that the tumors are free of any contaminating tissue (i.e., hair, skin, peritoneum, etc.). Place each tumor in 1.8 mL of base RPMI-1640 media without fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 24-well plate. For larger harvests, keep plates cold on ice to preserve cellular viability.\n\tNOTE: If sterility is required, all tumor dissections will need to be performed in a biosafety cabinet with sterile surgical tools (i.e., scissors, forceps, etc.), as well as any further steps. Tumors with the longest diameter between 0.5 - 1 cm are optimal, and larger or smaller tumors will require scaling of reagents.\nUse scissors to cut the tumors into less than 1 mm3 pieces within each well.\nPrepare a 10x digestion cocktail by dissolving collagenase I at 10 mg/mL, collagenase IV at 2,500 U/mL, and DNase I at 200 U/mL in base RPMI-1640 media (without FBS).\n\tNOTE: The digestion cocktail can be prepared a day in advance and stored at -20 °C; however, prolonged storage is not recommended as enzymes will lose activity over time once dissolved.\nAdd 200 µL of 10x dissociation cocktail containing collagenase I, collagenase IV, and DNase I to each well with the 1 mm3 pieces.\nAllow the samples to digest for 1 h at 37 °C while lightly shaking at 60 - 100 rpm using an orbital plate shaker.",
    "NOTE: The elevation of temperature to 37 °C during the enzymatic digestion may cause immune cell activation.\nAfter 1 h, neutralize the reaction by adding 1 mL of RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA to each well.\nPipette the tumor digestion and the remaining tumor pieces into a 40 µm cell strainer seated on top of a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: Cut the tip off of a 1 mL pipette tip for easier transfer of the tumor digestion to the strainer.\nUse a 10 mL syringe plunger to mechanically disaggregate the tumor pieces through the strainer. Periodically rinse the strainer with 2 mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 media (containing 5% FBS) and repeat until the cell strainer is clear of tumor.\n\tNOTE: Approximately 4 - 10 mL of total media should be sufficient to adequately rinse the strainer of tumor.\n\tNOTE: Place samples on ice until this step is completed for all samples to preserve cellular viability.\nAdjust each 50 mL centrifuge tube to the same volume using the supplemented RPMI-1640 media.\n\tNOTE: The adjustment of volume is critical for centrifuge balancing. Skipping this step could result in centrifuge damage or personal injury.\nCentrifuge the cell suspensions (5 min, 805 x g, 4 °C), discard the supernatants, and re-suspend in 2 mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 media.\n\tNOTE: A cell aggregate may form following the centrifugation that is difficult to resuspend. Use a 5 mL serological pipette and mix rapidly to break it up before proceeding.\n2. Separation of Immune and Tumor Cellular Fractions\nNOTE: The time required for this step is approximately 1 h.\nAdd 3 mL of density gradient medium to the bottom of a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Prepare and label enough tubes for each tumor.",
    "Layer the 2 mL of tumor cell suspension on top of the density gradient medium by pipetting slowly down the side of the tube to prevent mixing of the two layers.\nCarefully place the layered tubes in the centrifuge and spin for 20 min at 805 x g, 20 °C, with no brake.\n\tNOTE: It is extremely important to verify proper balancing and ensure that no brake is used during centrifugation. Any disruption of this process will result in layer mixing and the full sample recovery will be difficult.\nCarefully transfer the tumor infiltrating leukocyte (TIL) layer and the top media layer to a new 15 mL tube using a transfer pipette. Discard all remaining density gradient medium and resuspend the tumor pellet at the bottom of the tube in 2 mL of supplemented RPMI-1640.\n\tNOTE: After centrifugation there will be four visible layers from the top to bottom which respectively correspond to: media, TILs, density gradient medium, and tumor cell pellet. See Figure 2A for an example of the various layers.\nCentrifuge both the TIL and tumor samples in separate tubes (5 min, 805 x g, 4 °C) and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the TIL sample in 200 µL and the tumor pellet in 2 mL of supplemented RPMI-1640 media. Keep on ice to preserve viability.\n3. Plating and Staining\nNote: The time required for plating is 30 s/tumor; the time required for surface staining is 1 h; the time required for intracellular staining is 40 min; the time required for flow cytometry analysis is 1 - 4 min/tumor.\nPrepare and label a 96-well U-bottom plate for each immune staining panel and an additional plate for cell counts.\n\tNOTE: Typically, three plates are prepared in total: a lymphocyte-focused panel plate, a myeloid-focused panel plate, and a cell count plate.",
    "Aliquot the single-cell suspensions into each of the staining panel plates and a set volume into the count plate.\n\tNOTE: The count plate is used to calculate the total number of cells added to each staining panel, thereby allowing accurate cell population counts. A flow cytometer with 96-well plate sampling and volumetric analysis capabilities can provide the number of cells per µL in each sample, and therefore, calculate the number of cells added to each staining panel. Count plates can be acquired the following day after fixation overnight at 4 °C, rinsing with FACs buffer (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 2% FBS), and resuspending in a set volume of FACs buffer.\nWash the cells twice with 200 µL of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) per sample by centrifuging (5 min, 805 x g, 4 °C) and discarding the supernatant between each rinse to remove any free FBS.\nAdd 50 µL of Fc block, mix the samples using a multi-channel pipette, and incubate for 20 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 50 µL of 2x concentrated extracellular targeting antibody and fixable viability stain mixture, mix using a multi-channel pipette, and incubate for 30 min in the dark at RT or 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The exact staining conditions for the antibody depend on the manufacturer's instructions. All staining dilutions must be in DPBS, with no added FBS to prevent saturation of the fixable viability dye. Please see the Table of Materials/Equipment for the optimal dilutions of the staining panel used in this manuscript. Antibody and fixable viability staining solution is prepared at a 2x concentration to provide a final 1x staining concentration in 100 µL of total staining volume when added to the Fc block.",
    "Wash the samples twice with FACs buffer by centrifuging (5 min, 805 x g, 4 °C) and discarding the supernatants between each rinse.\nResuspend in 200 µL of 1x fixation/permeabilization solution and incubate overnight at 4 °C protected from light.\n\tNOTE: The experiment can be paused overnight at this point: keep samples at 4 °C protected from light.\nThe following day, centrifuge the plates (5 min, 805 x g, 4 °C) and discard the supernatant.\nRinse once with 200 µL of 1x permeabilization buffer, centrifuge (5 min, 805 x g, 4 °C), and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 100 µL of 1x concentrated intracellular antibody staining panel prepared in 1x permeabilization buffer and incubate for 30 min in the dark at RT or 4 °C (this depends on staining recommendations from the manufacturer).\nRinse once with 1x permeabilization buffer (5 min, 805 x g, 4 °C), discard the supernatant, and rinse a second time with FACs buffer (PBS with 2% FBS).\nResuspend the samples in 300 µL of FACs buffer (PBS with 2% FBS), transfer the samples to flow cytometry tubes, and perform flow cytometry analysis.\nSubscription Required.
