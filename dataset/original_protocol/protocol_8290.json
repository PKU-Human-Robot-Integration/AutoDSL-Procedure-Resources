    "All animal work was approved by the Animal Use Committee at the National Institutes of Health under animal study protocol #1362-13.\nNOTE: This protocol takes approximately 0.5 to 1 h to complete with no interruptions if the solutions and equipment are prepared and set up in advance. This protocol is optimized for Tg(myo6b:GCaMP6s-caax)5,29 zebrafish larvae at 3–7 days post-fertilization (dpf). This transgenic line expresses a membrane-localized GCaMP6s (zebrafish codon-optimized) specifically in all zebrafish hair cells. Prior to imaging, larvae are raised in the embryo buffer (E3) under standard conditions. Refer to the Table of Materials for catalog numbers of all equipment and drugs required to execute this protocol.\n1. Preparation of Solutions\nPrepare 1 mL of α-bungarotoxin (125 µM), which is used to paralyze zebrafish larvae during functional imaging.\nAdd 968.6 µL of ultrapure sterile water and 33.4 µL of phenol red to 1 mg of α-bungarotoxin (entire bottle). Make 100 µL aliquots and store them at -20 °C.\n​CAUTION: Wear gloves and make preparations in the hood when handling α-bungarotoxin powder. Gloves are also recommended when handling the α-bungarotoxin solution.\nPrepare 1 L of 60x embryo buffer (E3).\nAdd 17.2 g of NaCl and 0.76 g of KCl powder to 954.4 mL of ultrapure water.\nAdd 19.8 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 19.8 mL of 1 M MgSO4, and 6 mL of 1 M HEPES buffer to the solution. Store the 60x E3 stock solution at 4 °C for up to 6 months.\nPrepare 10 L of 1x E3 (5 mM NaCl; 0.17 mM KCl; 0.33 mM CaCl2; 0.33 mM MgSO4, pH 7.2), which is a solution that larvae are propagated in prior to functional imaging.",
    "Add 167 mL of 60x E3 stock solution to 10 L of ultrapure water to make a 1x E3 solution. Store the 1x E3 solution at room temperature (RT) for up to 6 months.\nPrepare neuronal buffer (NB) (140 mM NaCl; 2 mM KCl; 2 mM CaCl2; 1 mM MgCl2; 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.3), which is used to immerse larvae during functional imaging.\n​NOTE: 1x E3 can also be used for functional imaging, but responses are more robust and reliable in NB.\n\t\nCombine 28 mL of 5 M NaCl, 2 mL of 1 M KCl, 2 mL of 1 M CaCl2, 1 mL of 1 M MgCl2, and 10 mL of 1 M HEPES buffer with 957 mL of ultrapure water. Bring the pH to 7.3 with 1 M NaOH.\nFilter sterilize. Store at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\n\t\tNOTE: Bring to RT before using solution.\nPrepare MS-222 stock (tricaine, 0.4%), which is used to anesthetize larvae.\nDissolve 400 mg of ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt and 800 mg of Na2HPO4 in 100 mL of distilled water. Adjust the pH to 7. Store at 4 °C.\nUse 0.04% MS-222 to anesthetize larvae during immobilization and α-bungarotoxin injection.\n2. Preparation of Imaging Chamber and Pins\nPrepare the imaging chamber (Figure 2A). Apply a thin layer of high vacuum silicone grease to the bottom of the perfusion chamber along the edges of the square to which the coverslip will adhere. Do not leave gaps in the grease. Firmly press down around the edges of the coverslip to seal it to the imaging chamber. Wipe away excess grease.\n​NOTE: A 5 mL syringe with a 200 µL micropipette tip is recommended for grease application.",
    "Prepare the silicone encapsulant to fill the chamber. Mix a 10:1 ratio (by weight) of base to curing agent. Mix thoroughly but gently, using a micropipette tip to create minimal bubbles.\nPour the silicone encapsulant onto the affixed coverslip so that it is level with the surface of the chamber. Approximately 3 g of encapsulant will fill the chamber.\nCarefully tap the chamber against a flat surface while keeping it horizontal, or use a micropipette tip (under a stereomicroscope) to remove or pull bubbles to the edge of the chamber.\nPlace the chamber in a laboratory oven overnight at 60–70 °C. Place the chamber inside of a ventilated box to ensure that hot air is not directly blowing on the encapsulant to avoid creating ripples.\nUse fine forceps and tungsten wire to fashion the pins used to immobilize larvae through the head and tail (Figure 2B1) on the hardened encapsulant.\nTo make head pins, hold a piece of 0.035 mm tungsten wire in one hand under a stereomicroscope. Using fine forceps in the other hand, bend the wire 1 mm up from the end at 90°. Exchange the forceps for fine scissors and cut 1 mm after the bend to create the pin.\nRepeat step 2.3.1 using a 0.025 mm wire to make tail pins, but leave 0.5 mm of wire on either side of the bend. Use forceps to insert the pins into the hardened encapsulant on the chamber (for storage).\n3. Preparation of Needles for Paralysis and Stimulation\nPrepare heart injection needles using glass capillaries with a filament. Pull needles to an inner tip diameter of 1–3 µm (Figure 2C).\nPrepare fluid-jet needles using glass capillaries without a filament. Pull needles with a thin, long tip that can be broken to the correct tip diameter.",
    "Break off the thin, long tip of the fluid-jet needle by rubbing it perpendicularly against another fluid-jet needle or a ceramic tile just above where the needle tip can be bent to create an inner tip diameter of 30–50 µm [Figure 2C (middle image) and Figure 3A2]. Ensure that the break is even across the tip (Figure 2C, middle image) and not jagged or too large (Figure 2C, right image) to guarantee even and accurate fluid flow during hair-cell stimulation.\nNOTE: A needle polisher can be used to fix jagged breaks.\n4. Pinning and Immobilizing Larva to Imaging Chamber\nBathe a Tg(myo6b:GCaMP6s-caax) larva in approximately 1 mL of E3 buffer containing 0.04% MS-222 for 1–2 min on the silicone encapsulant surface of the imaging chamber until the larva becomes immobile or unresponsive to touch.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, position the larva at the center of the perfusion chamber so it lies flat on its side against the silicone encapsulant.\nNOTE: For consistency, always mount larvae on the same side (e.g., right side down, left side up) (Figure 2B1).\nUsing fine forceps, bring a 0.035 mm head pin down perpendicular to the larva and chamber. Insert the head pin between the eye and otic vesicle and down into the encapsulant (Figures 2B1 and 2B2). Use a second set of forceps to stabilize the larva along its dorsal or ventral side while pinning. Ensure that the horizontal part of the pin contacts the larva and does not press all the way into the encapsulant. Angle the pin ventrally (Figure 2B1) or pointing slightly toward the anterior of the fish to avoid interfering with subsequent heart injection and hair-cell imaging.\nUsing the forceps, insert a 0.025 mm tail pin into the notochord as close as possible to the end of the tail (Figure 2B1).",
    "NOTE: Be careful to avoid stretching the larva. Pin the larva flat. Eyes should be superimposed (Figure 2B1). This is very important for ease of heart injection (Figure 2B2-B2', step 5), facilitating a desirable imaging plane (Figure 1B1-B2'', steps 8 and 9), and quantifying the intensity of the fluid-jet stimulus (Figure 3A3, step 7).\n5. Injection of α-Bungarotoxin into the Heart Cavity to Paralyze Larva\nNOTE: Wear gloves when handling α-bungarotoxin.\nCentrifuge the α-bungarotoxin aliquot briefly prior to use to prevent clogging of the heart injection needle.\nBackfill 3 µL of α-bungarotoxin solution into a heart injection needle using a gel loading pipette tip. Load the solution evenly to the tip with no bubbles.\nInsert the heart injection needle into a pipette holder attached to a manual micromanipulator. Under a stereomicroscope, position the needle so it is aligned perpendicular to the A-P axis of the pinned and anesthetized larvae, pointing down at an angle of ~30°.\nConnect the pipette holder to the pressure injector. Apply the following suggested settings: Pinjection = 100 hPa, tinjection = 0.5 s, and Pcompensation = 5 hPa. Inject a bolus into the solution to test whether the needle tip is patent.\nLook for a small puff of the red solution (from phenol red) to leave the tip of the needle. If no red color is seen, very gently scrape the needle tip against the edge of a pin and try again until the needle is patent. Alternatively, pull a needle with a larger tip opening.",
    "Advance the needle toward the heart until it touches the skin outside of the heart (Figure 2B2). Press the needle into the larva and look for indentation of the pigment cell on the skin in front of the heart to ensure that needle is positioned in the correct plane relative to the larva (Figure 2B2').\nAdvance the needle further until it pierces the skin and enters the heart cavity. Pull the needle back slightly. Inject a bolus of α-bungarotoxin into the heart cavity. Look for inflation of the heart cavity or for red dye entering the cavity.\nGently rinse the larva 3 times with 1 mL of NB to remove residual MS-222. Never remove all of the fluid. Maintain larva in approximately 1 mL of NB on the perfusion chamber.\nNOTE: Ensure that larval heart beat and blood flow remain robust after pinning and heart injection and throughout the entire imaging experiment.\n6. Preparation of Microscope and Fluid-jet Setup\nAssemble an upright confocal microscope using the components described in the Table of Materials: a confocal microscope with a 488 nm laser and appropriate filters, microscope software to control and coordinate imaging and stimulation, 10x air objective, 60x water objective, piezo-Z objective scanner (for z-stacks), high-speed camera, circular chamber adaptor, motorized stage, and stage insert adaptor. Refer to Zhang et al.29 for additional options and guidance on microscope setups.\nAssemble the fluid jet made up of 3 main components: a vacuum and pressure pump, high-speed pressure clamp, and head stage (also described in the Table of Materials). Use the high-speed pressure clamp to control the timing and duration of pressure or vacuum discharge out of the heads stage and into the fluid-jet pipette.\nConnect the output of the head stage to the fluid-jet pipette holder via thick-walled silicone tubing.",
    "7. Alignment of Larva and Fluid-jet\nNOTE: There are 3 planes of interest within each neuromast: (1) the tips of the hair bundles (Figure 3A3: the kinocilia, used to measure stimulus intensity); (2) the hair-bundle MET plane (Figure 1B1-B1': the base of the apical hair bundles where MET-channel-dependent calcium signals are detected); and (3) the synaptic plane (Figure 1B2-B2': where presynaptic calcium signals are detected at the base of the hair cell). These planes are outlined in Figure 1A.\nBackfill 10 µL of NB into a properly broken fluid-jet needle (from step 3.2) using a gel loading tip. Load the solution evenly to the tip with no bubbles. Insert the needle into the pipette holder attached to the motorized micromanipulator.\nPlace the perfusion chamber into a circular chamber adapter on the microscope stage.\nNOTE: For consistency, always position the larva in the same orientation (e.g., the chamber containing the larva with its posterior toward fluid jet and ventral side facing toward the experimenter).\n\t\nMove the motorized stage so that the larva is in the center of the field of view. Turn the circular chamber adaptor so that the A-P axis of the larva is roughly aligned with the trajectory of the fluid-jet needle.\nUsing transmitted light and differential interference contrast (DIC), bring the larva into focus and center it under the 10x objective. Raise the 10x objective.\nUsing the motorized micromanipulator, bring the fluid-jet needle down into the center of the field of view so it is illuminated by the transmitted light and barely touching the NB solution.",
    "Lower the 10x objective. Focus on the larva to confirm its location. Focus up to find the fluid-jet needle. Move the fluid-jet needle with the micromanipulator in the x- and y-axes until it is in a position parallel to the dorsal side of the fish.\nFocus back on the larva. Bring the needle down in the z-axis. Position the needle along the dorsal side of the fish and ~1 mm away from the body (Figure 3A1).\nCarefully move the circular chamber adaptor (if necessary) to ensure that the fluid-jet needle is aligned along the A-P midline of the larva (Figure 3A1).\nMove the motorized stage to place the neuromast of interest in the center of the field of view. Keep the fluid-jet needle tip along the dorsal side of the fish. Do not touch the tip of the fluid-jet needle to the larva or the chamber surface.\nSwitch to the 60x water objective. Ensure that the objective is immersed in the NB solution. Use the fine focus to locate a neuromast using transmitted light and DIC optics.\nNOTE: This setup is designed to stimulate neuromasts along the primary posterior lateral line. Hair cells within these neuromasts respond to either anterior or posterior directed fluid flow. See Chou et al.31 for an accurate map of neuromast fluid sensitivity within the lateral-line system.\n\t\nPosition the fluid-jet needle with the micromanipulator so that it is 100 µm from the outer edge of the neuromast (Figure 3A2).\nNOTE: Choose neuromasts that offer clear top-down views (Figures 1B1'-B2' and Figure 3A3) rather than side-angled views (Figure 1C1-C2). A clear top-down view allows for simultaneous imaging of all apical hair bundles in a single optical plane or imaging of synaptic areas in fewer optical planes (Figure 3A3).",
    "Focus up to the tips of the apical hair-bundles (kinocilia) (Figure 1A, Figures 3A2 and 3A3). The bottom of the fluid-jet needle should be in focus in this plane.\nSet the high-speed pressure clamp from the manual to external mode to receive input from the imaging software.\nZero the high-speed pressure clamp by pressing the \"zero\" button. Use the set-point knob to set the resting pressure slightly positive (~2 mmHg). Confirm the resting output of the high-speed pressure clamp using a PSI manometer attached to the head stage output.\nNOTE: Set a slightly positive pressure at rest to avoid the gradual uptake of fluid into the fluid-jet needle over time. If fluid enters the tubing connected to the fluid-jet and reaches the head stage, it can damage the equipment.\nDetermine the pressure needed to stimulate the hair bundles. Use a 0.125 and 0.25 V input (6.25 and 12.5 mmHg) for 200–500 ms to apply a test stimulus (Figure 3A3-A3'').\nNOTE: The high-speed pressure clamp converts a voltage input (from software or other devices that connect to the BNC port on the high-speed pressure clamp command port) into pressure that is discharged from the head stage, and ultimately, the fluid-jet needle (1.0 V = 50 mmHg, while -1.0 V = -50 mmHg). In this configuration (see step 7.2) positive pressure (push) deflects hair bundles towards the anterior, and negative pressure (pull) deflects hair bundles towards the posterior.",
    "Using transmitted light and DIC optics along with a scale bar, measure the distance of deflection by the 6.25 and 12.5 mmHg stimuli of the tips of the hair bundles, the kinocilia (Figure 1A and Figures 3A3-3''). Choose a pressure that moves the bundles (as 1 cohesive unit) a distance of approximately 5 µm (Figure 3A3''). Ensure that the tips of the kinocilia remain in focus the entire time.\nMove the fluid-jet ± 25 µm along the A-P axis of the larva to find a distance and pressure that deflects the tips of kinocilia 5 µm.\nNOTE: Using GCaMP6s in larvae 3–7 dpf, a 5 µm deflection should achieve near saturating GCaMP6s calcium signals and should not damage apical hair-bundle structures (Figure 3A3''). Smaller displacement distances can be used to deliver non-saturating stimuli (Figure 3A3'). Displacement distances >10 µm are hard to estimate ( Figure 3A3''') and can be damaging over time. Signal saturation is dependent on age of the neuromast (and kinocilial height) as well as the indicator used. Check the patency of the fluid-jet needle in each direction (pressure/push and vacuum/pull) periodically during imaging. Fluid-jet needles clog easily and lose vacuum patency, but they maintain residual pressure patency. Use DIC optics and a short test stimulus in each direction to check for fluid-jet patency.\nFocus the sample into the plane of interest (e.g., the base of the apical hair bundles or the base of the hair cell in the synaptic plane; Figure 1B1-B2').\n8. Imaging Acquisition Procedure Option 1: Single-plane Acquisition\nNOTE: All imaging outlined in this protocol is performed at RT.\nSet imaging software to acquire a streaming or continuous 80-frame acquisition with a capture every 100 ms to achieve a frame rate of 10 Hz.",
    "Set gain, aperture, and laser power to optimize signal detection, but avoid saturation, photobleaching, and noise. Example settings for an Opterra/SFC are as follows: 488 nm laser power: 50 (hair-bundle MET plane), 75 (synaptic plane); 35 µm slit; gain = 2.7; EM gain = 3900.\nNOTE: Apply 2 X binning if signals are too weak or noisy or have excessive photobleaching. 2 X binning will enhance signal detection at the cost of spatial resolution.\nSelect a stimulus to deliver during the 80-frame (8 s) acquisition after frame 30, at 3 s.\nNOTE: Some example stimuli are as follows: 200 ms (+ or - 0.25 V) up to 2 s (+ or - 0.25 V) step in the anterior or posterior direction to identify the directional sensitivity of each hair cell; 2 s, 5 Hz square wave (0.25 V for 200 ms, -0.25 V for 200 ms, repeated 5 times) to stimulate all hair cells simultaneously. A positive pressure (anterior stimulus) will activate half of the hair cells. A negative pressure (posterior stimulus) will activate the other half of the hair cells. Be sure the stimulus software or device returns the pressure clamp back to 0 V after the stimulus is finished.\nMeasure mechanosensitive calcium responses. Focus on the base of the apical hair bundles (Figures 1A and 1B1-B1') and start image acquisition.\nNOTE: If the neuromast is viewed clearly from the top down (Figure 1B1-B1'), all apical hair bundles can be imaged simultaneously in a single plane.\nMeasure presynaptic calcium responses. Focus to the base of the hair cells (Figures 1A and 1B2-B2') and start image acquisition.",
    "NOTE: If the neuromast is viewed clearly from the top down (Figure 1B2-B2'), the presynaptic imaging planes of all hair cells can be acquired in 2–3 planes set 2 µm apart. Tg[myo6b:ribeye-mcherry] transgenic fish can be used to identify and locate presynaptic ribbons and sites of calcium entry29.\n9. Imaging Acquisition Procedure Option 2: Multi-plane Acquisition\nTune the piezo-Z attached to the 60x objective for fast acquisitions (12–18 ms). Ensure that max-speed settings are selected.\nCreate a Z-stack acquisition using a piezo-Z. Acquire the hair-bundle MET activity in 5 planes with step size of 0.5 µm. Acquire the presynaptic signals in 5 planes with step size of 1 µm.\nSet the frame rate to 10 Hz. Each frame will be captured every 20 ms and each Z-stack every 100 ms.\nSet up the acquisition for 400 frames or 80 Z-stacks at 10 Hz for an 8 s streaming acquisition.\nSet laser power, aperture, and gain to optimize signal detection, but avoid saturation, photobleaching, and noise. Example settings for an Opterra/SFC system are as follows: 488 nm laser power: 75 (hair-bundle MET plane), 125 (synaptic plane); 35 µm slit; gain = 2.7; EM gain = 3900.\nNOTE: Apply 2 X binning if signals are too weak,noisy, or have excessive photobleaching. 2 X binning will enhance signal detection at the cost of spatial resolution.\nSelect a stimulus to deliver during the acquisition starting at frame 150, after 3 s.\nContinue the protocol as described above for single plane acquisition, but center the Z-stack in the apical or basal planes (steps 8.4 and 8.5).\n10. Control: Pharmacological Block of All Evoked Calcium Signals\nNOTE: BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) treatment is a critical control when first establishing this protocol.",
    "After completing steps 8 or 9, replace the NB with 1 mL of NB containing 5 mM BAPTA to cleave the tip links required to gate apical MET channels located in hair bundles.\nIncubate for 10–20 min at RT.\nWash off BAPTA 3 times with 1 mL of NB.\nRepeat step 8 or 9. After BAPTA treatment, there should be no change in GCaMP6s fluorescence in response to fluid-jet stimulation in either the apical hair bundles or synaptic plane. If changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence persist, these are not true calcium signals and may be motion artifacts.\n11. Control: Pharmacological Block of Presynaptic Calcium Signals (Optional)\nAfter completing steps 8 or 9, replace the NB with NB containing 10 µM isradipine with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to block the L-type calcium channels at the hair-cell presynapse.\nIncubate for 10 min at RT.\nWithout performing a wash, repeat step 8 or 9. After treatment, there should still be GCaMP6s fluorescence changes in response to fluid-jet stimulation in apical hair-bundles but not the synaptic plane. If changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence persist in the synaptic plane, these are not true calcium signals and may be motion artifacts.\n12. Image Processing and Graphical Representation of Data\nNOTE: Use Fiji (steps 12.1–12.1.5) and a graphing program (steps 12.2–12.2.3) for step 12. StackReg, TurboReg (step 12.1.3), Time Series Analyzer V3 (steps 12.1.4–12.1.6), and Fiji plugins are also required (see Table of Materials).\nOpen an image sequence in Fiji, either a single-plane time series (80-frame single plane) or Z-stack time series (400-frame multi plane). Click on \"File,\" select \"Import\" from the drop-down menu, and click on \"Image Sequence.\"",

Click on \"Plugins,\" select \"StackReg\", and select \"Translation\" as the method of registration for the 70-frame time series.\nNOTE: This registered substack will be referred to as stk2.\nUse the Times Series Analyzer V3 plugin to extract the GCaMP6 intensity (F) measurements. Place a region of interest (ROI) on apical hair bundles or presynaptic sites in stk2. Refer to the ImageJ website (see Table of Materials for the link) for instructions on how to use Time Series Analyzer V3.\nNOTE: Use a circular 1–2 µm ROI for apical hair bundles and a circular 3–5 µm ROI for the synaptic plane (Figures 4A1 and 4A2).\nSelect the measurement parameters. Click on \"Analyze,\" select \"Set Measurement,\" and ensure that only \"Mean gray value\" is selected.\nIn the ROI manager, select all ROIs and use the multi-measure function to generate (F) intensity values for each ROI in the time series. Within ROI Manager, click \"More >> ,\" and select \"Multi Measure\" from the drop-down menu.",
    "Plot (F) values. Paste the values (F) from the \"Multi Measure\" Results into a graphing program to create an X-Y graph (Figures 4A1' and 4A2').\nNOTE: Create (X) values manually or use the time stamp from the metadata.\n\t\nQuantify the baseline (Fo) for each ROI by averaging the (F) values in the graphing program from the pre-stimulus frames 1–20.\nFor each ROI, subtract the (Fo) from the (F) values at each timepoint to create ΔF (F-Fo) values. Replot, if desired.\nCalculate and plot ΔF/Fo. For each ROI, divide the ΔF measurement by (Fo) and replot (Figures 4A1'' and 4A2'').\n13. Image Processing and Heat Map Representation of Spatio-temporal Calcium Signals\nNOTE: Previous work to create spatial heat map representation of calcium signals in zebrafish lateral-line hair cells have used custom software written in in Matlab5,28. This analysis has been adapted for the open source analysis software Fiji33. Use Fiji for all steps outlined below. StackReg and TurboReg Fiji plugins are also required (see Table of Materials).\nPerform steps 12.1–12.1.3 for each Z-stack or single plane time series to create the registered substack referred to as stk2.\nUse stk2 to create a baseline image.

Image Processing and Spatio-temporal Heat Map Representation Using a Fiji Macro\nNOTE: The following section refers to a Fiji macro called LUToverlay based on step 13 that will automatically create spatial heat map representation of GCaMP6s signals. This analysis requires the open source analysis software Fiji33 and the StackReg and TurboReg Fiji plugins (see Table of Materials).\nDownload the Fiji LUT overlay macro (LUToverlay.ijm) accompanying this protocol (see Supplemental Coding File).\nOpen either a multi-plane time series or single-plane time series (see step 12.1).\nClick on \"Plugins,\" select \"Macros,\" click on \"Run,\" and select the LUToverlay macro. A dialog box will appear with the text, \"Tell me about your image acquisition\".\nNOTE: For the dialog box, the numbers present are suggested values and can be changed according to the setup used by the experimenter. The values listed in the box and below are set for a multi-plane time series with 400 images and 5 planes per timepoint (step 9).\nAfter \"Number of planes per timepoint\", enter the number of planes per timepoint (e.g., for step 12.1.1 using a multi-plane 400 time series with 5 planes per timepoint, enter \"5\").
