    "A. thaliana seeds sterilization  Place approximately 80 seeds of A. thaliana Col-0 into a 1.5 mL tube.In a laminar flow hood, add 1 mL of 70% ethanol to the tubes and mix by inversion for 2 min.Remove ethanol using a micropipette, add 1 mL of Arabidopsis seeds sterilization solution (see Recipes) to the tube, and mix by inversion for 12 min.Remove the sterilization solution using a micropipette and perform five washing cycles with autoclaved distilled water.Leave the seeds in water until use (see Note 2).A. thaliana seed sowing  Prepare a plastic seed tray with autoclaved peat moss: vermiculite (2:1) for 20 alveolus of 6 × 6 × 8 cm.Place five sterilized seeds per alveolus avoiding corners.Cover the planted seed tray with a plastic film and leave it at 4 °C for five days to synchronize seed germination.Place the seed tray (that has been stratified at 4 °C for five days) into the growth chamber at 23 ± 1 °C, > 70% relative humidity, and a 16:8 h day/night photoperiod.Grow plants for 2–3 weeks (see Note 3).A. thaliana plants infestation  Infestation assay protocol with spider mite T. urticae was previously reported by Cazaux et al. (2014).Divide plants into two groups: one for control plants and the other one for infestation with T. urticae. Perform the infestation. Place 20 adult female mites per plant and cover the rosette with a ventilated plastic cup to avoid mite scape. Leave in the chamber for 24 h at 25 ± 1 °C, > 70% relative humidity, and a 16:8 h day/night photoperiod.Remove the plastic cup carefully, cut the rosette, and quickly freeze it in liquid nitrogen.Store plant material at -80 °C until use.Mandelonitrile extraction The mandelonitrile isolation protocol was adapted from Madala et al. (2014) as follows.",
    "Crush plant material until it reaches a fine powder using a mortar and pestle (use liquid nitrogen to prevent thawing of the material).Weigh the plant material using a precision balance (plant material ≥ 100 mg; see Note 4).In a small mortar, add 3 mL of methanol and the frozen plant material. Homogenate with a pestle and transfer the homogenate to a 15 mL Falcon tube (see Note 5).Sonicate for 20 min at room temperature (see Note 6).Incubate at 60 °C for 10 min using a heating oven.Centrifuge at 11,500× g for 5 min at room temperature.Collect the supernatants in a 10 mL flask (see Note 7) and remove the methanol on the rotary evaporator at 50 °C. Make sure that samples are completely dry (see Note 8).GC/MS analyses Derivatization by silylation with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA):Weigh 50 μL of mandelonitrile in a 10 mL flask to prepare the standard curve (see Note 7).Add 100 μL of MSTFA to the mandelonitrile sample and to the Col-0 samples.Mix well to achieve a homogeneous solution.Incubate at 60 °C in an oil bath for 30 min protected from light (see Note 9).Cool down the samples and the standard at room temperature.Samples and standard curve preparation for GC analyses:Prepare standard solutions of mandelonitrile (derivatized with MSTFA) in acetonitrile solvent at 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng/μL concentrations using 5 mL vials.Prepare samples by adding 900 μL of acetonitrile to the derivatized Col-0 samples.Filter the samples and the standards through a 0.2 μm syringe filter and place the sample and the standards in crimp neck vials for GC analyses.GC analyses:Inject 1 μL of the standard solution or the sample in a DB-5MS UI column of 60 m × 0.25 mm with 0.25 μm film thickness with a pressure of 17.",
    "7 psi, septum purge flow of 3 mL/min, and spitless time of 1.5 min (see Note 10).Set the injector temperature to 250 °C.Set the oven temperature to 60 °C, hold for 3 min, and then raise 10 °C/min up to 300 °C and maintain at 300 °C for 6 min.Set the transfer line temperature to 280 °C.Set the collision gas (nitrogen) and the quench gas (helium) with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and 2.25 mL/min, respectively.Set the operation mode as electron ionization mode at 280 °C and 70 eV with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) to monitor ion transitions (see Notes 11 and 12).The total ion and the retention time zoom chromatograms between minutes 15 and 18 are shown in Figure 2A and 2B, respectively.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4700/bioprotoc-13-12-4700-g002.jpgFigure 2.
