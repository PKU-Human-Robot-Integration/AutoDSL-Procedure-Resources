    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of the inner ear and in situ fixation of the organ of Corti\nTiming: 10 min for isolation of the inner ear per animal and between 30 min and 4 h for subsequent fixation.\nThis procedure describes isolation of the inner ear from the anesthetized animal for fixation.\nNote: This protocol has been successfully used to isolate organs of Corti from mice of both sexes, aged 2 weeks to 2 years.\nAnesthetize the animal according to the requirements of the institution’s ethical approval. After verifying sufficient depth of anesthesia (by absence of withdrawal reflexes), decapitate the mouse using surgical scissors.\nTaking care not to damage the temporal bone, bisect the skull and then the palate sagittally using surgical scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/674-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation and preparation of the inner ear for fixation\n(A) The lines of cut (dashed lines) and region of the temporal bone (red box) containing the inner ear are indicated.\n(B) The inner ear, comprising the cochlea and vestibule, is attached to the temporal bone (TB) adjacent to the tentorium cerebelli (TC). The auditory and vestibular nerves exit the cochlea and vestibule, respectively, and fuse to form the vestibulocochlear nerve (CNVIII).\n(C) The cochlea of the isolated inner (now rotated 180°around the vertical axis in the orientation shown in A) shows several anatomical features, including the round window (RW) and oval window (OW). The apex of the cochlea (containing the portion of the organ of Corti, or auditory sensory epithelium, responsive to the lowest frequencies of sound) is marked. The mouse cochlea contains an apical, middle, and basal turn, distinguished by the two dashed lines.",
    "(D) A small hole in the bone overlaying the apex has been made to allow better access to fixative and is outlined with a dashed oval. The dissection is shown from a mouse aged 6 weeks old.\nRemove the brain with surgical scissors or spatula to expose the inner ear embedded in each (left and right) temporal bone.\nUsing the surgical scissors, remove the sections of temporal bone containing the inner ear (easily identified by the semicircular canals) and transfer to ice-cold PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAlternatives: Temporal bones can be dissected into ice-cold 4% PFA instead of ice-cold PBS to begin fixation more quickly. Temporal bones can also be dissected instead into 0.4% PFA at 20°C–22°C for RNAscope. When dissecting in PFA, be sure to work in a fume hood with adequate ventilation. For electrophysiology or bulk RNA sequencing, dissection of organs of Corti should be performed, respectively, in the appropriate external solution (see methodology in Goutman and Pyott, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) or preferred RNA preservation solution (see methodology in Reijntjes et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nNote: We use 5-cm plastic petri dishes for dissections.\nWorking under a dissecting microscope, position one pair of forceps around the inner ear (at the junction between the cochlea and semicircular canals) to gently but firmly hold the temporal bone against the bottom of the dissecting dish. The forceps should be pressed down against the temporal bone and dish, rather than squeezed against the inner ear, to secure and prevent damage to the inner ear.\nUse blunt forceps to remove the inner ear from the temporal bone and auditory bulla.\nTransfer the isolated inner ear to a new 5-cm dissecting dish containing fresh ice-cold PBS, ice-cold or room temperature 4% or 0.4% PFA, external solution or RNA preservation solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Repeat steps 5 and 6 so that both isolated inner ears are in the same dissecting dish.\nPosition one pair of forceps around the inner ear (at the junction between the cochlea and semicircular canals) to gently but firmly hold the inner ear against the bottom of the dissecting dish. The oval and round windows and cochlear turns should be visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUsing one blade of the forceps, gently scrape and then chip a small hole in the bone covering the apical turn of the cochlea. This hole should be large enough to expose the apical turn. Be careful not to damage the underlying lateral wall or organ of Corti, which should remain covered by the intact lateral wall (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nRepeat steps 8 and 9 for the other inner ear.\nTransfer both inner ears to ice-cold 4% PFA. Fix inner ears for 30 min to 3 h depending on the primary antibodies to be used.\nNote: We use 5- or 15-mL plastic centrifuge tubes for fixation.\nNote: This methodology can be adapted for fixation of the vestibular sensory epithelia, including the utricle (the utricular macula) and the horizontal and anterior canals (the semicircular canal cristae) instead of or in addition to the organ of Corti. In this case, use blunt forceps to carefully remove the bone covering the roof of the utricle. Use fine forceps to gently open the membranous labyrinth covering the utricular macula and then remove the overlying otoconia. The vestibular epithelia are then isolated after fixation.",
    "Critical: In our experience, the duration of fixation (both over- and under-fixation) critically impacts immunoreactivity. We routinely begin with 1 h fixation times but will adjust (up or down) during optimization for a particular antibody. In our experience, fixation for 1 h at room temperature followed by 15 min on ice is best for RNAscope. For electrophysiology (see methodology in Goutman and Pyott, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) or bulk RNA sequencing (see methodology in Reijntjes et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]), fixation should not be performed and dissection should proceed immediately to isolation of the (unfixed) organ of Corti.\nIsolation of the organ of Corti\nTiming: 10 min for isolation of the organ of Corti per inner ear\nThis procedure describes isolation of the organ of Corti from the inner ear.\nAfter fixation (unless an alternative procedure is utilized), transfer the inner ears into a dissecting dish with fresh, ice-cold PBS (or appropriate solution).\nAgain, position one pair of forceps around the inner ear (at the junction between the cochlea and semicircular canals) to gently but firmly hold the inner ear against the bottom of the dissecting dish.\nUse another pair of forceps to continue removing the bone covering the organ of Corti, beginning with the hole made in the apex and gradually expanding it so that all turns and the most basal hook of the organ of Corti are exposed.\nUse a pair of fine forceps to “peel” the lateral wall away from organ of Corti. Begin by pinching the lateral wall at the apical turns (where it is more loosely associated with the organ of Corti) and gradually remove it from the organ of Corti using an unwinding motion.",
    "Critical: Take care not to damage the organ of Corti by carefully positioning the forceps between the lateral wall and the bone. Removing the bone without damaging the underlying organ of Corti and removing the lateral wall without disrupting the organ of Corti becomes more difficult in basal compared to apical turns and in older (> 6 weeks) compared to younger animals. Nevertheless, in our experience, dissections from animals older than 6 weeks (and up to two years of age) are comparable and quite doable with fine forceps and some practice. (See also problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] below).\nOnce the entire organ of Corti has been exposed, insert one blade of the fine forceps underneath the basal hook and gently push up to detach the basal turn (with some underlying bone) from the modiolus. Work slowly.\nOnce the most basal turn is loose, insert one blade of the fine forceps between the apical turn of the organ of Corti and the modiolus and gently push up from the underside of the organ of Corti to detach it from the modiolus. Again, work slowly.\nContinue in this way to work around the turns of the organ of Corti to release the entire organ of Corti from the modiolus.\nNote: In some cases, it may be necessary to use a small dissecting knife or microscissors to cut the central projections of the spiral ganglion cells to release the organ of Corti from the modiolus.",
    "Note: In some cases, the organ of Corti may need to be removed in two (or more) pieces rather than one piece. Since the immunostained organ of Corti will later need to be cut for mounting on slides, isolation in multiple pieces is not necessarily a problem although it does make the solution exchanges required for immunostaining more difficult. (See also problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] below.)\nNote: If desired, the vestibular sensory epithelia can now be isolated (see methodology in Sadeghi et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17], Schuth et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18], Greguske et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nOnce the organ of Corti has been isolated, use a pair of fine forceps to “peel” the tectorial membrane away from the organ of Corti. Use one pair of fine forceps to gently hold the organ of Corti. Take a second pair of fine forceps to pinch the tectorial membrane at the apical turn (where it is more loosely associated with the organ of Corti) and gradually remove it from the organ of Corti using an unwinding motion.\nRemove any excess bone left attached to the organ of Corti and transfer the organ(s) of Corti to a 24-well (cell culture) plate for either RNAscope or immunostaining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/674-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Fixed and isolated organs of Corti for RNAscope and immunostaining\nIsolated organs of Corti are processed in 24-well plates filed with solution (A) or on slides in solution contained within a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier (B).\n(C) The organ of Corti spirals from the apex to base. Even at low magnification, the orderly arrangement of the inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) in rows spiraling the length of the organ of Corti is visible. The arrow marks a section of the organ of Corti that has been damaged during dissection.",
    "Note: We use 24-well (cell culture) plates for RNAscope and immunostaining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Each well is filled with 300 to 400 μL of solution. As required for the specific experiment, we put one to four organs of Corti into a single well. Solutions are exchanged using a (1000 μL) micropipettor while samples remain in the same well. Care needs to be taken so as not to pipette the samples together with the solution. Fewer organs of Corti per well makes the solution exchanges required for immunostaining easier and may be required when keeping track of individuals and/or specific genotypes. On the other hand, more organs of Corti per well reduces the amount of solution necessary (which is advantageous when working with expensive reagents). Alternatively, wells can be pre-filled with the required solution and samples can be moved between wells. Samples should be transferred gently between wells using fine forceps. For RNAscope assays we also use microscope slides (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Organs of Corti are placed in solution within a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier (see step 28 “Fluorescence in situ hybridization in the organ of Corti with RNAscope” below).\nNote: For electrophysiology (see methodology in Goutman and Pyott, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) or bulk RNA sequencing (see methodology in Reijntjes et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]), the isolated organs of Corti should be processed immediately.\nFluorescence in situ hybridization in the organ of Corti with RNAscope\nTiming: 2 h on the first day and 6–7 h on the second day\nThis procedure describes single molecule in situ hybridization with RNAscope in the isolated and fixed organ of Corti. The described protocol is adapted from Kersigo et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 User Manual (https://acdbio.com/system/files_force/USM-323100%20Multiplex%20Fluorescent%20v2%20User%20Manual_10282019_0.pdf?download=1[href=https://acdbio.com/system/files_force/USM-323100%20Multiplex%20Fluorescent%20v2%20User%20Manual_10282019_0.pdf?download=1]). Steps 22–33 are completed on day 1 and steps 34–51 are completed on day 2.",
    "Turn on HybEZTM hybridization oven. The hybridization oven will automatically load the RNAscope protocol and adjust the temperature to 40°C in about 10 min.\nPrepare target probe in hybridization solution. Target probes come in different stock concentrations depending on the channel assigned to them. C1 probes can be directly aliquoted and warmed. C2 and C3 probes need to be diluted in probe diluent that has been pre-warmed to 40°C in the hybridization oven for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature. The C2 or C3 probes should be briefly centrifuged before being mixed with probe diluent.\nNote: We typically dilute 2 μL of either C2 or C3 probe in 100 μL of probe diluent in either 0.5- or 1.5-mL centrifuge tubes. Here we describe detection of transcripts with a single probe because we often combine RNAscope with subsequent immunofluorescence. However, the protocol is similar for the simultaneous detection of multiple transcripts using C1, C2, and C3 probes.\nAfter fixation in 4% PFA (step 21 from “Isolation of the organ of Corti” above), wash samples (organs of Corti) in PBT20 in a 24-well plate (see Note in step 21 and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) for 3 times 10 min each at room temperature.\nDehydrate samples in a 24-well plate through increasing MeOH/PBT20 solution gradients: 50%, 75%, and 100% MeOH; each step should last 5 min and be performed at room temperature.\nRehydrate samples in a 24-well plate through decreasing MeOH/PBT20 solution gradients: 75%, 50%, 0% MeOH; again, each step should last 5 min and be performed at room temperature.\nNote: Samples can be stored in 100% MeOH (after step 25) at −20°C for at least 3 weeks. In our experience, dehydration followed by rehydration improves probe permeabilization and is, therefore, desirable even if samples are not stored at −20°C before further processing.",
    "Wash samples in PBT20 in a 24-well plate 3 times 5 min each at room temperature.\nDuring the last PBT20 wash, prepare slides for proteinase incubation by drawing a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier with a PAP-pen (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Place approximately 3 drops (50–75 μL) of Proteinase III inside the hydrophobic circle on the slide.\nTransfer samples from the 24-well plate (step 26) to the Proteinase III solution (step 28) and incubate for 8 min on the slide at room temperature.\nStop protein digestion by moving samples back to a 24-well plate containing PBT20 and wash samples in PBT20 3 times 5 min each at room temperature.\nWhile samples are being washed in PBT20, line the bottom of humidity control tray of the hybridization oven with paper towels moistened with distilled water.\nPrepare slides for hybridization: make a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier on slides using a PAP-pen; place the slides on the oven’s slide rack; position the slides on the rack in the humidity control tray; and pipette approximately 50–75 μL of the target probe hybridization solution (from step 23) into the center of each hydrophobic circle.\nNote: During incubation in the hybridization oven (15–18 h), the hybridization solution will flatten and expand considerably. Leave space between solution and hydrophobic barrier to avoid leakage across the barrier. (See also problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] below.) To avoid cross contamination, we typically use one slide per hydrophobic barrier. In our experience, the type of slides used for hybridization is not critical.\nCarefully transfer samples from the 24-well plate with PBT20 (step 30) onto slides with hybridization solution (step 32). Place the humidity control tray with slide rack into hybridization oven and incubate samples at 40°C for 15–18 h.",
    "Carefully remove the tray with slide rack from the hybridization oven and transfer samples to a 24-well plate with 0.2× SSC. Wash in 0.2× SSC 3 times 15 min each.\nWhile samples are being washed in 0.2× SSC, aliquot preamplifier hybridization solution (Amp1), signal enhancement solution (Amp2), amplifier hybridization solution (Amp3), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and HRP-blocker and equilibrate to room temperature before using.\nNote: We typically warm these solutions in 1.5-mL centrifuge tubes. These solutions are provided in dropper bottles, with 3 drops being approximately 75 μL, the amount needed per sample for subsequent hybridization reactions.\nRefix samples briefly: pipette 75 μL of 4% PFA into a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier on a slide; transfer samples (from step 34) into the PFA; and fix for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash samples in 0.2× SSC in a 24-well plate 3 times 5 min each at room temperature.\nIncubate samples in preamplifier hybridization solution (Amp1) in a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier on a slide for 35 min at 40°C in the hybridization oven.\nWash samples in 0.2× SSC in a 24-well plate 3 times 15 min each at room temperature.\nIncubate samples in signal enhancement solution (Amp2) in a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier on a slide for 20 min at 40°C in the hybridization oven.\nWash samples in 0.2× SSC in a 24-well plate 3 times 15 min each at room temperature.\nIncubate samples in amplifier hybridization solution (Amp3) in a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier on a slide for 35 min at 40°C in hybridization oven.\nWash samples in 0.2× SSC in a 24-well plate 3 times 15 min each at room temperature.",
    "Incubate tissue in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier on a slide for 15 min at 40°C in hybridization oven. Choose the appropriate HRP corresponding to the channel on which the target probe is detected.\nWhile samples are incubating in HRP, prepare fluorescein: dilute 1 μL TSA® Plus fluorescein in 1500 μL TSA buffer.\nNote: Approximately 75 μL diluted fluorescein is needed per sample. In our experience, extra diluted fluorescein can be stored light shielded at 4°C for at least one month.\nAlternatives: Instead of fluorescein, TSA® Plus cyanine 3 (Cy3), cyanine 5 (Cy5), or Opal™ dyes from Akoya Biosciences can be used (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). If choosing an alternative fluorophore, dilution may need to be adjusted based on signal intensity. Be careful to choose fluorophores that are mutually compatible between targets and subsequent immunofluorescence.\nWash samples in 0.2× SSC in a 24-well plate 2 times 2 min each at room temperature.\nIncubate tissue in TSA Plus® fluorescein for 30 min at 40°C in the hybridization oven.\nWash samples in 0.2× SSC in a 24-well plate 2 times 2 min each at room temperature.\nStop horseradish peroxidase reaction by incubating samples in HRP blocker in a circle-shaped hydrophobic barrier on a slide for 15 min at 40°C in the hybridization oven.\nWash samples in 0.2× SSC in a 24-well plate 2 times 2 min each at room temperature.\nWash samples in 1× PBS in a 24-well plate 2 times 2 min each at room temperature.",
    "Note: Samples can proceed directly to immunofluorescent staining (see “immunofluorescent staining of fixed organs of Corti[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]” below) or be immediately mounted (see “mounting of prepared organs of Corti[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]” further below). Alternatively, samples can be stored in 1× PBS before subsequent processing. If pausing before continuing immunofluorescent staining, we recommend storing samples in blocking buffer (see Note in step 55 below).\nImmunofluorescent staining of fixed organs of Corti\nTiming: 8 h to 2 days (with approximately 2 h of active time)\nThis procedure describes immunofluorescent staining of the isolated and fixed organs of Corti.\nBlock (and permeabilize) samples in the blocking buffer for at least 1 h at room temperature.\nPause Point: Once the isolated organs of Corti are placed in blocking buffer, the protocol can be paused. Reasons for pausing may include waiting for the outcome of genotyping results so that a subset of samples can be identified for immunostaining or to collect organs of Corti for a single round of immunostaining. Isolated organs of Corti (as well as isolated vestibular epithelia) will store without loss of immunoreactivity for days to weeks (and perhaps longer) in blocking buffer at 4°C. When storing, it is important to make sure that the organs of Corti remain submerged in blocking buffer. We often use an excess of blocking buffer (500 to 1000 μL per well in a 24-well plate) and then seal with parafilm.\nUse a (1000 μL) micropipettor to remove the blocking buffer (see Note in step 21 above).\nAdd the primary antibody solution diluted to the appropriate concentration in blocking buffer.\nIncubate organs of Corti in the primary antibody solution at least 4 h or up to 48 h at room temperature. See also problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9] below.",
    "Note: Many laboratories routinely perform incubations at 4° C. In our experience immunoreactivity is improved when incubating at room temperature (even for 48 h incubations).\nNote: We have compiled an inventory of primary antibodies (iEAR: Inner Ear Antibody Resource) for immunostaining the isolated organ of Corti (and vestibular sensory epithelia) from the inner ear. The link to this inventory is provided in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] above. (See also problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] below.)\nRinse the samples with PBT 3 times for 10 min each at room temperature.\nPause Point: Samples can be rinsed longer or even stored in PBT at 4° C (in the refrigerator) if necessary or convenient.\nRemove PBT solution and add the secondary antibody solution diluted to the appropriate concentration in blocking buffer.\nIncubate organs of Corti in the secondary antibody solution at least 4 h or up to 24 h at room temperature.\nNote: Vestibular sensory epithelia are immunostained using the same protocol (see methodology in Sadeghi et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17], Schuth et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18], Greguske et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nAfter incubating in the secondary antibody, rinse the samples with PBT 3 times 10 min each and once with PBS at room temperature.\nMounting of prepared organs of Corti\nTiming: 5 min per organ of Corti\nThis procedure describes mounting of immunofluorescent stained organs of Corti on glass microscope slides.\nPlace a drop of Vectashield (or similar mounting medium) for each organ of Corti to be mounted on a clean microscope slide.",
    "Use fine forceps to transfer the piece(s) of organ of Corti into the drop of mounting medium. To minimize damage to the organs of Corti, use a lifting rather than pinching motion to transfer the samples. Under a dissecting microscope, use the forceps to gently position the pieces so that the basilar membrane is facing the slide and the organ of Corti is facing the coverslip. Segments of organ of Corti are ideally positioned close to each other to make subsequent imaging more convenient (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/674-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Mounting organs of Corti for microscopy\n(A) Organs of Corti are placed into individual drops of mounting medium.\n(B) To prevent turns of the organ of Corti from overlapping, the organ of Corti is cut into two or three pieces before mounting with a glass coverslip (as shown here). The apex and base are indicated. The arrow marks an air bubble caught inadvertently under the coverslip.\nCritical: Various features indicate the proper orientation of the organs of Corti when mounting. Most notably, when the organ of Corti is intact, the apical end spirals upward and away from the slide when the basilar membrane side is appropriately facing the slide. The organs of Corti will flatten once mounted. Less notable, there is a ridge of tissue where the tectorial membrane attaches. The presence of this ridge identifies the organ of Corti side.\nCarefully overlay a glass coverslip and use nail polish to adhere the coverslip to the slide (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nLabel slides appropriately.\nCritical: In our experience, organs of Corti are easier to mount (and less likely to become folded) when they are cold. Therefore, if organs of Corti are at room temperature, we recommend allowing the organs of Corti to first cool to 4° C. (See also problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9] below.)",
    "Note: We typically mount four organs of Corti on a single microscope slide.\nCritical: Careful mounting of the samples will better preserve their 3D structure and improve subsequent quantitative image analyses. (See also problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9] below.)\nNote: Vestibular sensory epithelia are mounted using the same protocol (see methodology in Sadeghi et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17], Schuth et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18], Greguske et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nPause Point: In our experience, mounted slides can be stored in the dark at 4°C for at least one year.\nOverlaying cochlear frequency maps\nTiming: 15 min per organ of Corti\nThis procedure describes overlaying of tonotopic maps on mounted organs of Corti. If identification of precise tonotopic regions is not necessary, this procedure can be omitted.\nObtain low magnification (5× epifluoresecent) micrographs of the entire organ of Corti (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Often multiple images will need to be taken to capture the entire organ of Corti.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/674-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Epifluorescent imaging of the immunostained and mounted organ of Corti\n(A) Three lower magnification epifluorescent micrographs of the apical, middle, and basal turns of the immunostained and mounted organ of Corti have been combined into a single digital image to overlay a tonotopic map (yellow).\n(B) A higher magnification epifluorescent micrograph reveals the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs, circled) and rows of inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). In both A and B, the organ of Corti is immunostained with rabbit anti-calretinin and goat anti-Rabbit (488).\nNote: If multiple images are taken, it may be necessary to montage images of a single segment and/or combine separate images of different segments into a single image file (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nTo montage images in Adobe Photoshop:\nIn Photoshop, open images to montage by going to File → Script → Load files into stack and then selecting the images to montage.",

Scanning parameters will vary between the specimens examined, the microscopes used, and the image analysis required. We, therefore, point out a few general guidelines. Excellent resources are available elsewhere (e.g., Murray, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). A summary of these instructions is included here for completeness.\nSelect the appropriate lasers, filters, detection windows and scanning configuration depending on the fluorophores (secondary antibodies) used. (If necessary, verify the appropriate pinhole diameter, generally “1 airy”.)\nUse the low magnification images with superimposed maps (saved in step 67i from the preceding procedure) to identify the appropriate tonotopic region under high magnification.\nNote: We use a 63× oil objective (N.A. 1.2) to obtain high magnification images for quantitative image analyses.",
    "Once the appropriate region of interest has been identified, set the laser intensity, gain, and offset so that the brightest parts of the image are just saturated (generally appearing “blue” when viewing under the “glow over glow under” color map or LUT).\nRepeat this step for the other fluorophores, and, if necessary, adjust so that there is no “cross talk” between channels.\nWhen obtaining a stack of images, identify the relative top and bottom of the region of interest (for example, all afferent synapses at the bases of the inner hair cells).\nCollect the required number of stacks at the optimal required resolution. After scanning, viewing projections through the entire stack is useful to verify that the correct region has been scanned (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/674-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Z-projection through a stack of confocal micrographs of an organ of Corti\nWith identification of the appropriate markers, a variety of structures can be identified in precisely defined tonotopic regions of the immunostained organ of Corti.\n(A) Organ of Corti isolated from Thy1-YFP-16 transgenic mice (Feng et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) express yellow fluorescent protein (green) in the myelinated neurons contacting the inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). IHCs and OHCs are immunostained with rabbit anti-MYO6 (red). A video of a 3D rotation is available as a supplemental video (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n(B) Organ of Corti showing abundant expression of Lrrc52 transcript (green) detected by RNAscope in the inner hair cells (IHCs). IHCs are immunostained with rabbit anti-calretinin (red).",
    "Note: Scanning protocols will vary depending on the subsequent image analysis. The optimal z-step size can often be calculated by the acquisition software. Generally, our stacks consist of about 90 scans (z step size = 0.3 μm) collected frame by frame (for sequential scanning) with a scan speed of 100 Hz (lines per second) and resolution of 1024 X 1024. These parameters are suitable for the quantitative image analyses described below.\nNote: Deconvolution of confocal images can be used to “deblur” images, which can be helpful with subsequent image analysis. The details for performing deconvolution will vary with the software and algorithms used and should be considered carefully before applying. Excellent resources are available elsewhere (e.g., Swedlow, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19])."
