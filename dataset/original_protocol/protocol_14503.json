    "All experimentation using human tissues described herein was approved by the ethical committee at University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU; TcBio #14-008). Informed consent for tissue collection, generation, storage, and use of the organoids was obtained from the patients at Wilhelmina Children's Hospital (WKZ)-UMCU.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nEquipment,Consumable,Tools\nLaminar flow hood,15 and 50 ml conical tubes,Zeiss LSM 800 – Zen 2 (Blue edition) software for measuring images\nCO2 incubator,Microfuge tubes,Microsoft Excel program\nCell culture Microscope (light/optical microscope),0.22 µm filters,\nCentrifuge,Serological pipettes,\nRolling Shaker,Micropipette filter tips,\n4 °C room or 4 °C fridge for incubator,Cryovials,\nCoolCell Cell Freezing Container,,\nSerological Pipettor,,\n\"Micropippette (1,000, 200 and 20 µl)\",,\nViaflo Repeat pipette,,\n(Live cell) Confocal Microscope,,\nComputer,,\nLiquid nitrogen tank,,\nMultichannel (200 µl),,\n1. Preparing Reagents for Culture\nNOTE: All steps are performed inside a biosafety cabinet and following standard guidelines for working with cell cultures. In order to facilitate the formation of nice drops of basement membrane matrix, maintain a pre-warmed stock of 96-, 24-, and 6-well plates in the incubator at 37 °C.\nBasal Medium Preparation\n\tNOTE: Basal medium (BM) refers to Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with Ham's Nutrient Mixture F-12 (Ad-DF) supplemented with 4-(2-hydroxyethil)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep).\n\t\nIn a 500 ml Ad-DF medium bottle, add 5 ml of 200 mM glutamine, 5 ml of 1 M HEPES, and 5 ml of pen/strep solutions (10,000 U/ml, 10,000 µg/ml).\nStore BM in the refrigerator at 4 °C for at least 4 weeks.\nWnt-3A-conditioned Medium Preparation\n\tNOTE: Wnt-3A-conditioned medium is made in-house using the cell line L-Wnt-3A according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nFor harvesting the Wnt-3A-conditioned medium, collect the medium exposed to the cells for one week and spin it down for 5 min at 450 x g to remove floating cells.",
    "Filter the Wnt-3A-conditioned medium through a 0.22 µm filter and divide it into 40 ml aliquots in 50 ml conical tubes. Store them at 4 °C for at least 4 months without a loss in activity.\nTest the activity of the Wnt-3A-conditioned medium in a TOP/FOP assay using human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells transfected with TOP- and FOP-luciferase and TK-Renilla and measured with a Renilla-luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: TOP-luciferase is a reporter plasmid that contains wild-type TCF binding regions. If the Wnt-3A-conditioned medium is active, the canonical Wnt signaling is activated. Beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus to associate with TCF/LEF transcription factors and activates transcription of the luciferase reporter, inducing an increase in relative luciferase activity when the substrate is added. The FOP-luciferase is used as a negative control because the TCF binding regions upstream of the luciferase gene are mutated.\nColon Medium Preparation\n\tNOTE: Prepare and dilute all growth factors and reagents according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Use small-size aliquots an avoid freeze-thaw cycles. Functional growth factors are essential for the results.\n\t\nPrepare colon medium (CM) by supplementing BM with 1x B27, 1.25 mM N-Acetylcysteine, 50 ng/ml hEGF, 5 nM gastrin, 10 mM nicotinamide, 300 ng/ml hRspo3, 100 ng/ml hNoggin, 500 µM A83-01, 10 µM SB202190, and 100 µg/ml of an antimicrobial for primary cells.\nDivide the CM into aliquots and freeze them at -20 °C for up to 4 months. Thaw the aliquots to prepare full colon medium (FCM) by adding 50% Wnt-3A-conditoned medium to the CM. Store FCM up to 7 days at 4 °C without a loss in activity.",
    "For the establishment of an organoid culture from rectal biopsies, supplement FCM with 50 µg/ml vancomycin, 50 µg/ml gentamycin, and 10 µM rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor (RhoKi). Use this medium, called isolation medium (IM), only for the first two to three days in culture.\nEDTA Stock Solution Preparation\nPrepare 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8, in ultrapure H2O, sterilized with a 0.22 µm filter.\nManipulation of the Basement Membrane Matrix\nPrepare the basement membrane matrix (BMM) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.\nThaw BMM overnight on ice.\nWhen transferring the BMM from the bottle to a 15 ml conical tube, use a 5 ml pipette and a 15 ml conical tube pre-cooled at -20 °C.\nOnce thawed, store the BMM in a refrigerator at 4 °C and incubate on ice for at least 30-60 min before use.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to obtain the best results, the BMM must be cold and properly mixed before embedding crypts or organoids.\n2. Establishing Colon Organoids from a CF Patient Biopsy\nNOTE: After tissue collection, it is important to maintain the sample on ice in saline, Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS), or BM. Rapid processing of the biopsies is recommended, but it has proven possible to establish organoid cultures from biopsies stored on ice for up to 7 days.\nLet the biopsies settle at the bottom of a 15 ml conical tube and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 10 ml of DPBS to the biopsies and pipette up and down 10-20 times using a 10 ml pipette.\n\tNOTE: The pipette needs to be pre-wetted with BM before pipetting the biopsy.\nLet the biopsies settle at the bottom and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 2.2 and 2.3 4-5 times until the supernatant is clear.",
    "Add 10 ml of DBPS and 200 µl EDTA (0.5 M) to the biopsies and place the tube on a rocking tube platform for 60-120 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Incubation time may differ per patient. If crypts are released, DPBS becomes cloudy. EDTA incubation can be finalized when crypts can be observed under a microscope.\nAllow the crypts to settle. Discard the supernatant.\nTake up 2 ml of BM and add it to a new 15 ml conical tube. Shake this new tube manually in such a way that the inside is covered with BM.\nUsing a pipette pre-wetted with BM, add 2 ml of DPBS to the tube containing the biopsies and pipette up and down 10-20 times.\nAllow the biopsies to settle and transfer the DPBS with the crypts to the new tube containing the 2 ml of BM that was prepared in step 2.7.\nRepeat steps 2.8 and 2.9 until no more crypts are released.\nSpin the crypts down at 130 x g for 5 min at 8 °C.\nIn the meantime, transfer IM to the safety cabinet at room temperature (RT).\nDiscard the supernatant and add 10 ml of BM to the crypt pellet and repeat step 2.11.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 ml of BM. Take 5-10 µl and count the number of crypts by eye under a microscope.\nSpin the crypts down at 130 x g for 5 min at 8 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 55% BMM (v BMM to v IM).\n\tNOTE: The crypts are resuspended in the corresponding volume of 55% BMM at 1 crypt per µl. If there are not enough crypts, the minimum volume of BMM is 40 µl.",
    "For seeding, pipette 35 µl per well (in a 24-well plate). Divide the 35 µl of BMM into 3-5 drops separately in order to improve the diffusion of growth factors into the BMM. Do not create bubbles.\nPlace and leave the plate upside down in the incubator at 37 °C for at least 20 min for the BMM to solidify.\nAdd 500 µl of IM per well and keep it in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRefresh the medium every 2-3 days. Remove the old medium by pipetting out with a P1000 pipette, leaving the BMM drops intact. Carefully add FCM by pipetting it in the side of the well, not directly on the BMM drops.\n\tNOTE: If no crypts are released in the isolation protocol, centrifuge the supernatant, wash the pellet 2-3 times with BM, and resuspend it in BMM. Take the leftover tissue and cut it into little pieces with a razor. Collect these into a 15 ml conical tube, centrifuge them, and resuspend them in the same BMM. If any epithelial stem cells are present, these will also generate organoids.\n3. Passaging of Colon Organoids for Maintenance, Freezing, and Forskolin-induced Swelling Assay (FIS)\nNOTE: Every organoid culture has its own doubling time. Normally, colorectal CF organoids can be expanded 1:3-1:5 times every 7-10 days. It is a good sign if budding structures are observed. Colorectal CF organoids are less cystic (Figure 2A-2C) than colorectal normal organoids (Figure 2D). For establishment and maintenance, organoids are cultured in 24-well plates; for freezing, in 6-well plates; and for the FIS assay, in 96-well pates.\nPassaging of Organoids\nKeep the BMM on ice for at least 30-60 min before using it.\nKeep the FCM at RT for at least 1 hr before using it.",
    "Label one 15 ml conical tube with the sample name and another tube as \"washed.\"\nCarefully aspirate the medium from the wells using a P1000 pipette without disturbing the BMM drops.\nAdd 1 ml of BM to 1 well and break up the BMM drops by using a P1000 pipette. Transfer this 1 ml into the 15 ml conical tube with the sample name.\nWash the well with another 1 ml of BM and transfer it to the same 15 ml tube.\nRepeat steps 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 with 5 more wells (up to 6 wells of a 24-well plate will be washed in one 15 ml conical tube).\nFill the tube up to 12 ml with BM. Pipette up and down using a pre-wetted 5 ml pipette.\nSpin at 85 x g for 5 min at 8 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 1 ml of BM to the pellet. With the same P1000 pipette tip, take up a P10 tip without a filter, and pipette up and down 20 times. Discard both P1000 and P10 tips.\nAdd 4 ml of BM with a 5 ml pipette and hold the tube tilted at about 70° from the vertical to one side. Pre-wet a new P1000 tip and mix vigorously 2-3 times with the P1000 (1 ml volume).\nCount to 10 while remaining in the tilted position, collect the uppermost layer carefully with the P1000 pipette, and transfer 4 x 1 ml into the tube labelled as \"washed.\"\nObserve the organoids settling to the bottom in the tilted tube; undisrupted organoids and bigger chunks will sink to the bottom. Centrifuge the 15 ml \"washed\" tube for 5 min at 85 x g and 8 °C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and add the required amount of medium and BMM to the organoid pellet to a final concentration of 55% BMM. Mix by pipetting up and down without creating bubbles (Figure 3B).\n\t\tNOTE: A good density is achieved by seeding 25-30 organoids in 10 µl of BMM.\nFollow steps 2.17-2.19.\nPassaging for Freezing\nKeep the BM in ice for at least 30-60 min before use. Keep the FCM at RT for at least 1 hr before use.\nPrepare FCM supplemented with RhoKi (Step 1.3.3).\nTake trypsin from the refrigerator and leave it at RT for at least 30 min before use.\nFollow steps 3.1.5-3.1.10.\nRemove as much supernatant as possible, add 4 ml of trypsin, and vortex for 30 sec.\nPut the tube in a warm water bath at 37 °C for 1 min and vortex vigorously for 30 sec.\nInspect the solution in the tube. If intact organoids are still visible under the microscope, repeat step 3.2.7.\nWhen the organoids are disrupted, add 8 ml of BM to neutralize the trypsin and pipette 10 times.\nSpin for 3 min at 450 x g at 8 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add the required amount of medium and BMM to the organoids to reach a 55% BMM solution. Mix by pipetting up and down without creating bubbles.\n\t\tNOTE: For freezing, organoids must be seeded in a 1:1 ratio after trypsinization.\nSeed 250 µl in a single well of a pre-warmed 6-well tissue culture plate, producing tiny, separated droplets of ~10 µl. Place the plate upside down in the incubator at 37 °C and leave the BMM to solidify for 20-30 min.\nAdd 2.5 ml of fresh FCM + RhoKi in each 6-well plate well and transfer the plate to the incubator (Figure 3C).",
    "Passaging Organoids for the FIS Assay\n\tNOTE: Depending on the number and size of the organoids, between 4 and 6 wells of a 24-well plate are enough for seeding 27 wells of a 96-well plate.\n\t\nProcess the organoids as described from steps 3.1-3.1.13.\nResuspend the pellet in 120 µl of 50% BMM.\nConfirm the number of organoids (30-50) in a 3 µl BMM drop under the microscope.\nPlate the organoids using a single drop of 3 µl placed in the middle of each well of a 96-well pate.\nPlace the plate in the 37 °C incubator for 15 min for the BMM to solidify; further steps are described in step 6.1.1.\n4. Freezing Colon CF Organoids\nNOTE: Organoids are ready to be frozen down 1-2 days after trypsinization and culturing, so organoids will still be small, which increases the efficiency of survival after thawing.\nAdd 1 ml of BM and break up the BMM drops using a P1000 pipette. Transfer to a 15 ml conical tube.\nWash the well with another 1 ml of BM and transfer to the same 15 ml tube.\nRepeat steps 4.1 and 4.2 with all wells.\n\tNOTE: To avoid excess BMM, 3 wells of a 6-well plate are pooled in one 15 ml tube.\nFill up the 15 ml tube containing the organoids with 12 ml of cold BM and pipette up and down with a 5 ml pipette. Leave the tube on ice for 5 min.\nSpin for 3 min at 450 x g and 8 °C and remove the supernatant.\nDissolve the pellet of organoids with freezing medium and pipette up and down to properly resuspend the organoids.\n\tNOTE: 500 µl of freezing medium is used for each 100 µl of BMM.",
    "Using a 5 ml pipet, transfer 0.5 ml of organoids resuspended in freezing medium to sterile cryogenic vials.\nTransfer the vials to a cell freezing container and put it at -80 °C.\nAfter 24 hr, transfer the vials for storage in liquid nitrogen.\n5. Establishing Cultures from Frozen Organoids\nNOTE: Thaw the BMM on ice and keep it on ice. Let the BM reach RT, and warm a 10 ml aliquot to 37 °C before starting the procedure of thawing one cryovial.\nThaw the vial rapidly by agitation in a 37 °C water bath until there is still a little frozen material.\nTransfer the thawed organoids to a 15 ml conical tube using a P1000 pipette.\nImmediately after, add 1 ml of warm BM drop by drop while shaking the bottom of the tube. Once the 1 ml of medium is added, mix carefully by pipetting up and down a few times to dilute the freezing medium.\nSlowly (drop by drop) add 9 ml of warm BM to the conical tube containing the organoids. Invert a few times.\nSpin the cell suspension for 3 min at 85 x g and 8 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Resuspend the organoid in 90 µl of FCM supplemented with RhoKi (step 1.3.3). Then, add 110 µl of BMM.\nAdd 35 µl to each well of a pre-warmed 24-well plate, making tiny, separated droplets.\nTransfer the plate to the 37 °C incubator, leaving the plate upside down for 20-30 min.\nAdd 500 µl of FCM with RhoKi to each well and transfer the plate back to the incubator (Figure 4A-4C).",
    "Once organoids have recovered properly from thawing, dilute in more BMM so each 10 µl of BMM contains 25-30 organoids. This procedure can be done 2-3 days after thawing (Figure 4D-4G) and ensures the proper growth of the organoid.\n6. Forskolin-induced Swelling Assay (FIS)\nNOTE: Fsk titration allows for the measurement of CFTR residual function. For CFTR modulation, organoids are exposed to a given corrector (e.g., VX-809) and/or potentiator (e.g., VX-770), depending on genotype. Usually, VX-809 is added 18-24 h before the measurement, while VX-770 and Fsk are added right before starting the measurements. Be aware that some modulators (correctors/potentiators) can bind to the plastic surface of the assay plate.\nPlating for the Assay\n\tNOTE: VX-809 stocks are aliquoted at 20 mM and stored at -80 °C. When thawing, leave at RT and protect from light.\n\t\nProcess the organoids as described in section 3.3.\nIf testing the VX-809 corrector, prepare a dose-response curve in triplicates with the following concentrations: 0.0003, 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3.0, and 30 µM. Prepare the dilutions in FCM.\nTo the 96-well plate, add either 100 µl of FCM with the respective VX-809 concentration or 100 µl of FCM only and incubate the plate.\nMeasuring the Assay\n\tNOTE: VX-770 stocks are aliquoted at 20 mM, while Fsk is at 10 mM; both are stored at -80 °C. When thawing, leave at room temperature and protect from light.\n\t\nTake a vial of calcein and DMSO and leave at RT for 15 min.\nAdd 5.1 µl of DMSO to the vial where the calcein is provided as a powder, if unopened. Otherwise, use an already resuspended calcein vial containing 2.5 µl of calcein.\nAdd 2.5 µl of calcein to 580 µl of BM in a 1.5 ml tube and label it.",
    "Add 10 µl of this dye solution (BM + calcein) to each well using a repeat pipette.\nResuspend once with a multichannel to ensure that the dye is mixed well.\nIncubate the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min.\nDuring the calcein incubation, start preparing the Fsk and VX-770 solutions, if needed.\nIf using a VX-770 potentiator, prepare a dose-response curve in triplicate with the following concentrations: 0.0003, 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3.0, and 30 µM. In case of an Fsk titration, the concentrations are: 0, 0.008, 0.02, 0.05, 0.12, 0.32, 0.8, 2.0, and 5.0 µM. Prepare the dilutions in BM.\n\t\tNOTE: For Fsk, VX-770, or any other drug added on the second day, the dilutions must be prepared at 2x final concentration, since 100 µl of Fsk/drug titration solution will be added to each well, which already contain 100 µl of FCM.\nTransfer the Fsk and VX-770 solutions, a p200 pipette, and tips to the microscope room.\nFor imaging the FIS assay, use a live cell imaging confocal microscope equipped with an automated stage, a heated chamber, and CO2 flow.\n\t\tNOTE: The following steps refer to a specific microscope. Different setups should apply to other microscopes following manufacturer's instructions.\nPut the 96-well plate in the plate holder.\nEnter the confocal settings for imaging.\n\t\t\nPreset the live imaging tool to 37 °C and 5% CO2 and let the chamber pre-incubate for a minimum of 30 min prior to measurement.\nUse the \"Smart setup\" option to select the Alexa fluor-488 track.\nSet the 5X lens and scan area to 0.6X to zoom out and capture the entire well.",
    "Adapt the laser power and detector sensitivity to enable the optimal detection of calcein-green labeled organoids over the background. The pinhole can be increased to 130 µm and the image averaging can be set at 2.\nSet the bit depth at 8 and the frame size to 512 x 512.\nUse the time series option to set the measurement time, frequency, and intervals.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Suggested for regular measurements: 1 hr with 10 min interval: cycles = 7 (Cycle 1 is T = 0). For measurements of reduced swelling, organoids can be imaged for up to 3 hr.\nUse the tile option to manually determine the individual well positions.\nAdd 100 µl of the Fsk and/or VX-770 solutions to the corresponding wells, following the same order as the measurement. Start adding the solutions in the first imaged well and continue with the imaging order.\nStart the measurement.\nAfter the experiment is finished, save the file.\nAnalysis of FIS Assay Data\nCreate an \"organoid analysis\" macro for the data analysis of the FIS assay using the analysis tool in an image analysis software that recognizes all structures imaged through the Alexa-488 track and fills the identified structures to calculate the increase of total organoid area over the different time points.\nOpen the data file with the acquired images in the image analysis program.\nSelect the macro for organoid analysis.\nSet the threshold to balance the signal-to-noise ratio in one well at time point 1 and ensure that all organoid structures are recognized and filled.\n\t\t\nCheck in 4-6 wells to see if all structures are also recognized at time point 7. Slightly modify the threshold to ensure that the background signals at time point 7 are not recognized as structures (the specific threshold may change somewhat between experiments).",
    "Set the criteria of minimal area size of recognized objects to 1,000 µm2.\nPress \"analyze\" to start. The analysis takes approximately 3 min, depending on the software used.\nWhen the software is finished, go to \"create table\" and select the following data: well numbers (table should increase in this order), time points, and total area per well.\nSave file as an .xlm to export to a spreadsheet program.\nIn this program, calculate the relative increase in area per well by setting the area of time point 1 at 100%. Calculate the area under the curve (AUC) from time points 1-7 per condition; the lower limit of the area (Y-value) is set at 100%. Fsk or drug titrations (X-axis) are plotted against the AUC (Y-axis).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
