    "Prepare working areaDisinfect equipment using 80% ethanol (see Recipe 1), and place into a biosafety cabinet: dissection tools, 35 mm and 10 cm culture plates, media bottles, serological pipettes (5 ml) and pipette-boy, ice tray and ice, barrier pipette tips and relevant pipettes, and dissection microscope.Label all required dishes and tubes appropriately.Brain dissectionDecapitate postnatal 1-2 day old C57Bl/6 mouse pups using dissecting scissors (along green dotted line) (Figure 1A). Dispose of body into biohazard bag.Using iris scissors, cut the skin on the scalp mid-sagittally (purple arrow) and peel laterally to expose the skull. Using dressing forceps and iris scissors, cut away the excess skin (Figure 1B).Using iris scissors, make the same cut through the skull, and two perpendicular cuts (blue arrows; Figure 1B). Using Dumont forceps #3 peel back the skull between these cuts to expose the underlying brain.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170501/20170501190852_0910.jpgFigure 1. Step-by-step dissection procedure depicted in schematic and microscopic images. A-C. Removal of the brain from 1-2 day old mouse pups; D-F. Sectioning the rostral brain, dissection of RMS, and cutting RMS into many small pieces approximately 200-300 µm in diameter; G. Culturing up to 4 explants far apart in Matrigel with test compound(s) that are maintained in complete Neurobasal media. Bar represents 2 mm.Using the flat part of the spatula, starting at the caudal end of the brain, gently lift the brain out of the skull (Figure 1C). Place the brain into a 10 cm culture dish containing 5 ml HBSS media. Dispose of mouse head into biohazard bag.Using two pairs of Dumont forceps #3, gently pull the meninges off the brain, starting with the olfactory bulbs.",
    "Rostral migratory stream (RMS) dissection and explant productionUsing Dumont forceps #3 to hold the brain steady, use a scalpel blade at the rostral end of the brain to cut 3-4 coronal slices throughout the brain (Figure 1D). When using the scalpel blade, use a gentle back-and-forth sawing motion to preserve the morphology of the tissue.Using Dumont forceps #5, transfer rostral slices from both brain hemispheres containing RMS (which also contain migrating anterior subventricular zone [aSVZ] neuroblasts), into 35 mm dishes containing ice-cold HBSS (Figure 1E). To identify the RMS within these slices, angle the light source onto the center of the section so that the central RMS can be distinguished from the surrounding tissue. In the early postnatal mouse, the RMS will appear more translucent, dark and shiny than the surrounding tissue. The RMS should be located centrally, and at its widest point be about one third of the width of each coronal slice.Using two insulin syringe needles, dissect out the RMS by making cuts on the inside of its border (Figure 1E).Using the same syringe needles, cut the RMS into many small pieces approximately 200-300 µm wide, and set aside (Figure 1F).Notes: The authors did not use a tissue/brain slicer to cut the brain into 3 or 4 coronal slices, although this equipment could assist others to cut more straight and even slices throughout the brain.To better visualize the RMS within a coronal slice, it may be important to re-arrange the light source so that the RMS appears darker from the surrounding tissue and thus can be distinguished more easily.For better experimental analysis, use the needles to cut the RMS into pieces that are approximately the same size and shape.One RMS may produce up to 50 explants.",
    "Explant experimentationUsing ice-cold pipette tips and on top of ice tray, prepare complete Matrigel (see Recipe 3) by diluting Matrigel in complete neurobasal medium (see Recipe 2). To create different treatment conditions, add a maximum of 2 µl of the compound(s) to be tested into the diluted Matrigel (Figure 1G). Store on ice. Place a 4-well dish inside a 10 cm dish filled with ice to enable longer manipulation time of explants before the Matrigel polymerizes.Preparing one well at a time, using Dumont forceps #5, carefully pick up an explant and place into one well of the 4-well dish. Plate four RMS explants per well, and remove excess HBSS using a 10 µl pipette.Turn down the light source brightness to reduce any heat output (or use a cold light source illuminator). Using a scalpel blade, trim the tip of an ice-cold pipette tip to make a wider opening, and transfer 100 µl of diluted Matrigel onto explants in one well. Using the same tip, gently mix the Matrigel with the explants (without making any air bubbles), ensuring explants are entirely surrounded by the gel. Work quickly during this step otherwise the gel will begin to polymerize as it warms up under the heat of the microscope lamp. Using Dumont forceps #3, arrange the explants in the Matrigel so that they are far apart from each other, and far apart from the walls of the well.Repeat for other wells.Place two 35 mm 4-well dishes (containing explants and Matrigel) in a 10 cm dish and incubate (5% CO2, 37 °C) for 15 min in order for the Matrigel to polymerize.After polymerization, gently add 2 ml of complete neurobasal media to cover Matrigel and explants.Maintain cultures in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) for 72 h.",
    "Notes: To prevent Matrigel from prematurely polymerizing, ensure manipulation is performed in ice-cold conditions using cell culture dishes and pipette tips pre-chilled at -20 °C.Mix the explants well in the Matrigel without making any bubbles, and position the explants in the wells far apart from each other, and away from the walls of the well to allow migration in all directions.Once the Matrigel and explants have been placed in the well it may become difficult to move the explants within the Matrigel. To assist with this process, prepare one well at a time. Between wells it may be necessary to turn off the light source (i.e., eliminate any heat sources) for 2-3 min and place a 10 cm Petri dish filled with ice on top of the dissecting microscope stage to cool it down quickly.Using a marker pen, keep track of the 4 explants in each well by labelling the bottom of the well 1, 2, 3 and 4.Explant immunohistochemistryWarm 4% PFA (see Recipe 5) to 37 °C Use a disposable transfer pipette to gently transfer solutions on and off the explants as follows. Remove media and add 2 ml warm PFA. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Remove PFA, and wash explants with PBS containing DAPI (see Recipe 6). Incubate explants in 2 ml blocking buffer (see Recipe 7) for 30 min at room temperature. Remove blocking buffer and incubate in 2 ml primary antibody solution (see Recipe 8) overnight at 4 °C. The next day gently wash the explants three times with PBS. Incubate explants in 2 ml fluorescent secondary antibody (see Recipe 9) for 48 h at 4 °C. Gently wash explants again three times with PBS.Gently remove blocking buffer from wells."
