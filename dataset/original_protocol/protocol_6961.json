    "Part I: PLA LRRK2 in fixed cells Cell culture and seedingSeed 100,000 HEK293 cells in 1 ml of DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS onto a 12 mm coverslip coated with poly-D-lysine in a 24-well plate. Place the plate in 37°C + 5% CO2 cell culture incubator overnight.Note: At the time of fixation, cells should be around 70-80% confluent for best results. The assay can also be done in chamber slides (Tek Chamber Slide w/ Cover glass slide sterile, Thermo Fisher, catalog number: 178599). The volumes need to be adjusted accordingly as they are smaller than the coverslips (e.g., 100 µl of solution per well and 25 µl of PLA solution per reaction). Cell Fixation, Permeabilization, and Primary Antibody IncubationAfter 24 h, remove the media and fix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.Note: Use 325 µl of solution per well. Wash the fixed cells 3 × 10 min in 1× PBS (approximately 1 ml/well).Permeabilize the cells with blocking solution for cells (0.02% Triton X-100 + 10% NDS made in 1× PBS) incubate for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation.Note: Use 325 µl of solution per well. Wash the fixed and permeabilized cells 3 × 10 min in 1× PBS (approximately 1 ml/well).Dilute primary antibodies in 10% NDS in 1× PBS and incubate overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation.Note: Use 325 µl of solution per well. 1:1,000 Rabbit anti-LRRK2 phospho-S1292.1:1,000 Mouse anti-LRRK2/Dardin Clone N241A/34.PLANote: Allow PLA Wash Buffer A and B to reach room temperature prior to use as cold wash buffers lead to diffuse nonspecific background signal. Each coverslip represents one reaction, and 45 µl of solution is used per reaction. Enough solution is needed to completely cover the coverslip as the sample must not dry out.",
    "Adjust the volume if needed. The calculations below are only for one reaction.Wash cells 3 × 10 min in 1× PBS with gentle agitation (approximately 1 ml/well).Step 1: Probes Note: Make probe solution and let sit at room temperature for 20 min prior to adding to cells. Mix 9 µl PLA MINUS Probe (1:5 dilution), 9 µl PLA PLUS Probe (1:5 dilution), and 27 µl antibody diluent and add 45 µl of solution directly on top of the coverslip.Add 1 drop of PLA Blocking Solution to the coverslip.Incubate for 1 h in a 37°C humidified incubator.Wash 2 × 5 min in Wash Buffer A (approximately 1 ml/well) with gentle agitation.Step 2: Ligation Note: Thaw 5× Ligation Buffer on ice; leave 40× Ligase in freezer block at -20°C and only remove when adding it to the 1× Ligation Solution. Vortex 5× Ligation Buffer thoroughly.Make 1× Ligation Solution by mixing 9 µl 5× Ligation Buffer (1:5 dilution) and 34.9 μl Milli-Q water.After the second wash in Wash Buffer A, add 1.1 µl Ligase (1:40 dilution) to 1× Ligation Solution. Add 45 µl of ligation solution directly on top of the coverslip.Incubate for 45 min in a 37°C humidified incubator.Wash 2 × 2 min in Wash Buffer A (approximately 1 ml/well) with gentle agitation.Step 3: Amplification Note: Thaw 5× Amplification Buffer on ice; leave 80× Polymerase in freezer block at -20°C and only remove when adding it to the 1× Amplification Solution. The plate must be protected from light from this point forward. Vortex 5× Amplification Buffer thoroughly.Make 1× Amplification Solution by mixing 9 µl of 5× Amplification Orange Buffer (1:5 dilution) and 35.4 µl Milli-Q water.After the second wash in Wash Buffer A, add 0.6 µl Polymerase (1:80 dilution) to 1× Amplification Solution.",
    "Add 45 µl of amplification solution directly on top of the coverslip.Incubate for 100 min in a 37°C humidified incubator.Wash 2 × 10 min in Wash Buffer B (approximately 1 ml/well) with gentle agitation.Preparation for ImagingIncubate cells in DAPI (1:5,000 dilution in 1× PBS) for 1 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.Wash 3 × 10 min in 1× PBS.Mount coverslips on Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides using 15 µl of gelvatol mounting medium per coverslip.Note: See “Recipes” for how to make Gelvatol Mounting Medium. Once coverslips are mounted, place in slide book, refrigerate, and let gelvatol mounting medium dry for 24-48 h.Image within a few days after completing the assay.Note: PLA fluorescent signal fades with time. Imaging and Analysis (Figures 2A-2E)Acquire images on 60× or 100× magnification using an Olympus BX61 confocal microscope or any confocal and/or fluorescence microscope available.To ensure the signal detected is above background fluorescence, set up imaging parameters (laser power, exposure, and pinhole) on negative control (i.e., LRRK2 knockout cell line, cells treated with LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, LRRK2 knockdown cells, or primary delete). For quantitative comparisons, keep all imaging parameters constant across all groups.Take multiple images per coverslip.Analyze images by taking fluorescence measurements in regions of interest of each individual cell in a single field.Note: Depending on the signal pattern, either fluorescence intensity, number of dots per cell, or nucleus may be appropriate for quantitation. For each independent biological experiment, there are two technical replicates per experimental group. This helps control for assay reliability and variability. Use at least three to four independent biological replicates.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4140/bioprotoc-11-17-4140-g002.jpgFigure 2.
