    "All procedures involving animals were approved by the local authorities of the State of Hamburg, the University of Hamburg Animal Care and Use Committees.\n1. Preparation of the Langendorff Apparatus\nNOTE: A commercially available Langendorff perfusion system is used.\nPrepare a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (119 mM of sodium chloride, 25 mM of sodium bicarbonate, 4.6 mM of potassium chloride, 1.2 mM of potassium phosphate monobasic, 1.1 mM of magnesium sulfate, 2.5 mM of calcium chloride, 8.3 mM of glucose, and 2 mM of sodium pyruvate). Add a mixture of 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide to the perfusion solution to prevent calcium precipitation. Filter the buffer with a pore size of 0.22 µm.\nAdd a pharmacological agent to the buffer to investigate its effect on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis as needed.\nStart the water bath and place the perfusion solution including a mixture of 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide in it. Adjust the temperature of the water bath, so that the perfusion solution temperature directly before the cannula is ~37 ˚C.\nStart the roller pump and fill the apparatus with the perfusion solution as soon as the correct temperature is reached.\nAdjust the pump rate before attaching the heart, so that no air bubbles are left in the cannula when mounting it to the apparatus.\n2. Hard- and Software Preparation\nConnect a digital data acquisition system and its corresponding software to the Langendorff apparatus for a continuous recording of the perfusion pressure, flow rate, and heart rate.\n\t\nSet the targeted perfusion pressure in the general settings to 80 mmHg.\nStart recording.\nUse an electrophysiology catheter (Table of Materials) with platinum electrodes, an electrode surface of 0.5 x 0.5 mm, and an electrode spacing of 0.5 mm for the data recording and stimulation with a designated digital stimulus generator.",
    "Place the catheter close to the area where the heart will be positioned after the attachment to the apparatus.\nPrepare the stimulation by selecting 2 electrodes from the catheter and use a cycle length of 100 ms.\n3. Preparation of the Heart\nAdd the cold (~2 - 4 ˚C) perfusion buffer (10 - 20 mL and 40 - 50 mL, so that the whole dish is covered) to the 2 Petri dishes (diameter of 6 cm and 10 cm) and the dish with the cannula and place them on ice directly next and under the microscope. Prepare a double knot around the cannula.\nRapidly excise the heart after cervical dislocation by opening the thorax using Mayo scissors and narrow pattern forceps. Then grip the aorta and vena cava above the diaphragm using the London forceps and excise the heart-lung block by cutting all vessels and connective tissue close to the spine with the Strabismus scissors.\nTransfer the heart-lung block into the first dish (6 cm diameter) filled with the ice-cold buffer and carefully remove the lungs without damaging the heart by using Strabismus scissors and London forceps. Then place the heart under the microscope and carefully remove the thymus, the esophagus and trachea by using Spring scissors and Dumont SS forceps.\nUse the Spring scissors to cut a hole of 1.5 - 2 mm in the upper part of the right atrium for the insertion of the catheter. Cut a hole in the pulmonary artery. Then cut the aorta directly under the supraaortic branches and remove the tissue from the aorta, so that the knot can be attached easily.\nKeep the atrial fat pads, including the major atrially located ganglionated plexi, around the left atrium intact or completely remove them by careful dissection.",
    "Transfer the heart to the dish with the cannula and place it under the microscope. Pull the aorta over the cannula with the Dumont SS forceps and tie the prepared knot tightly around the aorta. Make sure that the cannula is not placed too deep in the aorta so that the aortic valve and the coronary vessels are left free.\nAttach the cannula quickly to the Langendorff apparatus. Make sure that there are no bubbles left in the cannula.\nSwitch the perfusion pressure to 80 mmHg, allowing a constant pressure perfusion.\nInsert the catheter carefully into the right atrium and right ventricle without touching or damaging the heart and attach the catheter to the cannula with tape.\nStart the stimulation with the prepared cycle length of 100 ms for an initial 20 min equilibration period.\nClose the chamber to allow a stable temperature.\n4. Electrophysiological Parameters and Arrhythmogenesis\nApply a programmed stimulation via the distal or proximal electrodes of the catheter at twice the atrial or ventricular pacing threshold to evaluate the electrophysiological parameters as described in the following steps.\n\t\nDetermine the sinus node recovery time as the maximum return cycle length after 10 s of fixed-rate pacing at an S1S1 cycle length of 120 ms, 100 ms, and 80 ms.\nDetermine the Wenckebach point as the longest S1S1 cycle length (8 stimuli; S1S1: 100 ms; 2 ms stepwise reduction) with a loss of 11 AV nodal conduction. Determine the atrioventricular nodal refractory periods as the longest S1S2 (12 stimuli; S1S1: 120 ms, 110 ms, and 100ms; one short coupled extrastimulus with a 2 ms stepwise S1S2 reduction) with a loss of AV nodal conduction.",
    "Determine the atrial and ventricular refractory periods as the longest S1S2 (12 stimuli; S1S1: 120 ms, 110 ms, and 100ms; one short coupled extrastimulus with a 2 ms stepwise S1S2 reduction) with an absent atrial or ventricular response10,11.\nPerform a programmed extrastimulation (S1S1: 120 ms, 100 ms, and 80 ms, followed by up to 3 extra beats; 60 - 20 ms with a 2 ms stepwise reduction) or burst pacing protocols (5 s at S1S1: 50 - 10 ms with a 10 ms stepwise reduction) in line with the Lambeth Conventions to evaluate the ventricular arrhythmogenesis10,11,12.\n5. Epicardial Conduction Measurements\nNOTE: Record unipolar epicardial electrograms by using a 128-channel, computer-assisted recording system with a sampling rate of 25 kHz for high-resolution mapping. Use a 32 multi-electrode array (MEA; inter-electrode distance: 300 µm; 1.8 x 1.8 mm). Note that the data were bandpass filtered (50 Hz) and digitized with 12 bit and a signal range of 20 mV.\nPlace the MEA in the designated area of the heart and add the grounding to another part of the heart13,14,15.\nPlace an epicardial stimulation catheter close to the MEA and start a constant stimulation.\nStart recording after the confirmation of good contact of the electrodes by checking the signal quality and amplitude.\nUse an offline analysis for the determination of wave propagation velocity and dispersion in the conduction direction.\n6. Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) Imaging\nNOTE: For FRET-based measurements, harvest hearts from CAG-Epac1-camps transgenic mice16.\nUse a self-built imaging system around a stereomicroscope15,17.\nPlace the stereomicroscope in front of the heart and adjust it for acuity.",
    "Excite the cAMP sensor with a light source [e.g., use a single-wavelength light emitting diode (440 nm)]. Split the emission light into donor and acceptor channels using a beam-splitter (for a cyan fluorescent protein/yellow fluorescent protein pair, use a 565dcxr dichroic mirror and D480/30 and D535/40 emission filters).\nEnsure a stable temperature by putting a plastic wrap around the chamber.\nTake images by using a scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) camera. Coordinate the light source and camera image capturing with an open source imaging software such as Micro-Manager.\nTo start the image acquisition, push the Multi-D Acq. button and set up a time-lapse, which acquires an image every 10 s, with the appropriate exposure time, which depends on the strength of the fluorescent signal (around 100 ms).\nUse the previously described and available FRET online and FRET online 2 plugins17 to split the image into two channels, select the regions of interest, and monitor the ratio tracing.\nDuring the acquisition, perfuse the heart with the modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing different substances, depending on the nature of the experiment.\nAt the end of the experiment, switch off the acquisition by pushing the Stop button and save the stack of images.\nAnalyze the FRET data offline using a dedicated analysis software that can split images into two identical sections for the donor and acceptor channels and can perform FRET analysis in multiple regions-of-interest.\n\tNOTE: A dedicated plug-in (FRET offline) is needed, which is provided in Sprenger et al.17.\n\t\nStart the software. Open the analysis by going to the Plugins menu, then click on MicroManager, and then on Open Micro-Manager File.\nRun the FRET offline plugin in order to split the time-lapse into two identical images for the CFP and YFP channels.",
    "Use the Freehand Selections tool to mark the region of interest in the YFP image. Press the Add button to add the selection to the Multi Measure window.\nChoose the region of interest in the Multi Measure window and press Multi to obtain a table with mean grey values for each frame and region. Copy and paste all the data into an Excel sheet.\nClick on the CFP Image Stack. Perform the same actions as in step 6.10.4 for the CFP stack and paste the mean grey values into the same Excel sheet.\nCorrect the raw data offline for the bleed-through factor of the donor into the acceptor channel17.\n\t\nUse the following formula, where B is the bleed-through factor:\n\t\tRatio = (YFP - B x CFP) / CFP\nDetermine the bleed-through factor B by imaging a heart expressing CFP only and measure the percentage of the donor fluorescence in the YFP channel (B = YFP / CFP).\n7. Neuromorphology\nNOTE: Analyze the intracardiac autonomic nervous system by using whole-mount immunostainings of intact murine hearts. Note that the majority of intracardiac ganglia are localized in the epicardial adipose tissue close to the pulmonary veins.\nUse different stainings for the depiction of neurofilament (general neuronal structures; chicken anti-NF-H, 1:3,000), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, sympathetic neuronal structures; rabbit α TH, 1:1,000), and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, parasympathetic neuronal structures; goat α ChAT, 1:50).\nAfter the perfusion in the Langendorff apparatus, fix the mouse hearts in 10 mL of formalin for 24 h and store them in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 ˚C.",
    "Bleach the hearts in Dent's bleach (4:1:1 methanol: hydrogen peroxide solution 30% (w/w) in H2O: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) for 1 week at 4 ˚C and rehydrate them subsequently to PBS in a series of descending methanol in PBS (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%; 1 h each)18.\nPerform the following incubations in a 24-well-plate format with a gentle agitation at 4 ˚C:\n\t\nPermeabilize the hearts in 1% Triton-X-100/PBS (PBS-T) for 3x 1 h at room temperature before blocking them overnight in a blocking buffer [5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) / PBS-T + 0.2% sodium azide].\nDilute the antibodies as follows: goat α ChAT (1:50), rabbit α TH (1:1,000), chicken α neurofilament (1:3,000); secondary antibodies for fluorescent labelling (1:500; or according to the manufacturer's instructions); biotinylated secondary antibodies for chromogenic labelling (1:200; or according to the manufacturer's instructions).\nIncubate the specimens in primary antibodies diluted in a blocking buffer for 1 week at 4 ˚C.\nWash the hearts for 3 x 15 min in PBS-T before the secondary antibody incubation in a blocking buffer for 4 days.\nWash the hearts for 3 x 15 min in PBS-T and store them in a mounting medium for fluorescent staining for 3 h at room temperature or use an avidin-biotin complex detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nPre-incubate the hearts for 1 h in a commercial buffer for 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), before developing them under a visual control in a DAB-containing buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nStore the specimens in double distilled water.\nFor paraffin sections, dehydrate and embed the hearts in paraffin.\n\t\nCut 4-µm thick sections and deparaffinize them according to the laboratory's routine procedures. Whether and how antigen retrieval needs to be performed needs to be established for every individual setup since it depends on the antibody combination.",
    "Permeabilize the sections for 10 min in 0.2% Triton-X-100/Tris-buffered saline (TBS), followed by 3 x 5 min washes in TBS.\nBlock them with 3% BSA/TBS for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate them overnight at 4 ˚C [primary antibodies: goat α ChAT (1:50), rabbit α TH (1:500), chicken α neurofilament (1:1,000)] or 2 h at room temperature (fluorescence-labelled secondary antibodies, 1:500) in 1% BSA/TBS with 3 x 5 min washes TBS in between.\nAdd 1 µg/mL of bisbenzimide H33342 trihydrochloride to the secondary antibody solution or use a different nuclear staining method.\nMount the slides in a mounting medium for fluorescent staining.\nSubscription Required.
