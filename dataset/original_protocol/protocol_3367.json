Organoid size and growth rate varies greatly between different patient derived cultures. Therefore, the size and the organoid density prior to processing is dependent on the growth dynamics of the individual PDO model and should be evaluated carefully. PDOs ready for experiments at approximately 90% confluency are seen in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nHarvesting of HGSC PDOs\nAspirate culture media from BME-2 organoid cultures.\nWash each well once with 1 mL PBS at 15°C–25°C. Discard PBS.\nAdd 2 mL TrypLE Express in each well at 15°C–25°C.\nIncubate for 1–2 min in the tissue culture hood.\nDetach the BME-2 organoids droplets from the plate bottom with a cell scraper.\nUse a sterile single-use cell scraper for each sample.\nDissociate the BME-2 organoids droplets by vigorous pipetting 7–8 times until you have a homogenous solution. While pipetting, rinse the whole well with the TrypLE Express solution.\nCritical: Pre-coat the pipette tip with TrypLE Express for this step. Otherwise, organoids might stick to the plastic rims of the pipette tip, and you may lose material.\nIncubate the dissociated BME-2 organoid droplets in the plate with TrypLE Express for 15 min at 37°C for the BME-2 gel structure be dissolved.",
    "Note: Seeding densities should be tested and adjusted based on the individual PDO. As a starting point, we suggest that 1 well from a 6-well plate with 10 BME droplets of 20 μL each grown to 90% confluency is suitable for seeding 20 wells of 20 μL each in a 96-well plate and 50 wells of 10 μL each in a 384-well plate.\nSwirl the plate with the organoids to collect the sample in the middle of the well and transfer the organoid suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.\nFirst, aspirate some microliters of liquid and then collect the organoid-suspension.\nCritical: Pre-coat the pipette tip with TrypLE Express for this step. Otherwise, organoids might stick to the plastic rims of the pipette tip, and you may lose material.\nSpin the organoids down by centrifuging them at 240 × g for 5 min at 15°C–25°C.\nSeeding of HGSC PDOs in imaging plates\nGently aspirate the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the organoid pellet into cold BME-2 dilution by carefully pipetting up and down without creating any air bubbles and until reaching a homogenous solution.\nDilute the BME-2 with PBS in a 50:50 ratio to seed in the 384-well plates.\nDilute the BME-2 with PBS in a 70:30 ratio to seed in the 96-well plates.\nNote: We suggest that for the 96-well plates, the assay is performed in triplicates and in the 384-well plates, the assay is performed in quadruplicate. This should be considered when seeding.\nSeed PDOs in imaging plates.\nSeeding in 384-well plates:\nUse a multichannel pipette and seed 8 μL of the diluted BME-2 suspension to each well.\nWhen depositing the suspension, ensure that the pipette tip touches the bottom of the well.",
    "Complete the seeding and tap the plate to even the spreading of the BME-2- organoid suspension spreads evenly into the wells.\nNote: Use the multichannel pipette with a maximum of 10 μL for precise small volumes. Multichannel pipettes with larger volumes also create more bubbles when seeding.\nSeeding in 96-well plates:\nSeed 20 μL of the diluted BME-2 suspension to the middle of each well.\nAdd the pipette tip to the middle at the bottom of the well and create a drop of 20 μL.\nIf the matrix does not cover the whole well, gently tap the side of the plate to distribute the matrix.\nIncubate the plate for 45 min at 37°C to allow complete BME-2 solidification.\nAdd pre-warmed experimental media on top of the wells by avoiding touching the bottom of the plate.\nAdd 50 μL of PDO experimental media (human plasma mimicking medium such as HPLM or Plasmax with indicated supplements) in the 384-well plates.\nAdd 100 μL of experimental media (HPLM or Plasmax with indicated supplements) in the 96-well plates.\nNote: Pre-heat the appropriate volume of experimental media while incubating at step 12.\nNote: To minimize evaporation from the wells, add PBS in the same amount as experimental media in all wells in the rim of the plate.\nCritical: Deposit the experimental media with slow speed; otherwise, the BME-2 structure might be disrupted by mechanical force.\nIncubate organoids for 3–4 days at 37°C until the PDOs reach a suitable size and density. Example of growth over 3 days in 96-well plates is seen in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3131-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Critical: To avoid the BME-2 to solidify to early, fast working and having both BME-2 and PBS cooled on ice are necessary. Always pre-cool the pipette tip in cold PBS before aspirating BME-2 solution.\nDrug treatment of PDOs\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes how to perform a desired drug treatment in PDOs seeded in imaging plates.\nPrepare the 2x drug dilutions in experimental media.\nAdd the 2x drug dilution on top of the PDOs in the same volume of media that was added per well in step 13.\nInclude DMSO as a negative control treatment to indicate the amount of spontaneous, drug-independent cell death. The percentage of DMSO dilution should be equivalent to the highest concentration of the drug dilution that has been used in the experiment.\nInclude 10 μM Bortezomib in the cytotoxicity assay as a positive control treatment to indicate maximum cell death.\nIncubate treated PDOs at 37°C for desired time. In our experiments with PI3K-inhibitors we used:\n48 h for Ki67 antibody staining.\n72 h for cytotoxicity assay.\nNote: To ensure an accurate 2x drug volume to be added in step 16, include three control wells with experimental media when seeding in step 13. Before applying the drug treatment, measure the average amount of evaporation from the control wells. Then, add the measured evaporated volume of experimental medium to the wells with PDOs to regain the initial volume. Then add the 2x drug solution to the PDOs.\nNote: Bortezomib is often used as a positive cell death control since it can induce cell death in various solid tumors including ovarian, colon, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] However, its efficacy as a positive control should be tested in case the protocol is used in PDOs deriving from a different type of cancer.",
    "Note: To measure cytotoxicity of PDOs continue with Staining 1 (step 22). To detect and quantify proliferation proceed with Staining 2 (step 33).\nStaining 1: Cytotoxicity assay\nTiming: 2.5 h in total\nThis major step describes how to stain for live and dead cells in PDOs seeded in imaging plates and how to measure cytotoxicity via high-throughput confocal screening.\nNote: The assay described below refers to PDOs seeded in 384-well plates. The same steps could be used to assay PDOs seeded in 96-well plates by adjusting the volumes of the added compounds.\nLabel total amount of cells and dead cells\nTiming: ∼ 1 h\nDilute 4 μL Hoechst 33342 Trihydrochloride Trihydrate (Hoechst 33342) and 4 μL propidium iodide (PI) per 1 mL experimental media to stain and evaluate the total number of cells and the total number of dead cells, respectively.\nAdd 10 μL of the staining solution on top of the PDOs.\nIncubate for 45 min at 37°C.\nImage acquisition\nTiming: ∼ 1 h\nNote: Our imaging protocols presented below have been set up for ImageXpress HT.ai (Molecular Devices). Other high-throughput microscopes can be used when setting the conditions suitable for them.\nImage with ImageXpress HT.ai at 10X magnification.\nUse DAPI channel to identify Hoechst 33342 and Texas Red channel to identify the PI.\nUse transmitted light to control PDO vitality.\nChoose a desired number of areas or sites (e.g., 3–4) to be imaged per well.\nUse the DAPI channel to adjust the focus and set the optimal exposure for Texas Red to avoid image saturation.\nPerform scanning of each well with z-stack acquisition of 5–10 μm step size. Choose the number of z-stacks to ensure scanning of the whole PDO volume. Save both z- stack images and the 2D projection image.",
    "Use the same settings throughout the scanning of the whole plate.\nImage-based analysis pipeline\nTiming: ∼ 30 min\nIn the custom module workflow at the MetaXpress analysis software, select the ‘Find Round Objects’ function and based on the DAPI image, find all the Hoechst 33342–positive nuclei as individual round objects.

Continue from step 21.\nNote: The assay described below refers to PDOs seeded in 96-well plates. The same steps could be used to assay PDOs seeded in 384-well plates by adjusting the volumes of the added compounds.\nImmunofluorescent staining day 1\nTiming: ∼ 3 h\nNote: All incubations and washes are done with gentle shaking of the plate at 15°C–25°C unless otherwise specified.\nRemove 100 μL media from the wells to only have 100 μL left covering the organoids.",

    "Critical: Do not remove the liquid completely while staining. Leave 10–15 μL covering the BME-2- embedded PDOs. Never let the pipette tip touch the bottom of the well, this will damage and remove the BME-2.\nNote: At least 200 μL liquid per well is needed for imaging to avoid disturbing the laser auto focus.\nPause point: This step might be used as a pause point.
