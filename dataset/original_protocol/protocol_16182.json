    "This protocol describes the methodology for handling the HepaRG cells and performing a 3-day dosing regimen (to mimic the dosing schedule of in vivo genotoxicity assays, including the comet assay and the micronucleus assay) in the absence or presence of repair inhibitors. In brief, NoSpin HepaRG™ cells are obtained from the commercial source (Lonza, Research Triangle Park, NC) as fully differentiated hepatocytes in co-culture with biliary cells. The frozen cells are thawed and plated in William's E medium with Thawing and Plating supplement for 24 hr. On day 0, users will plate cells at 80,000 cells per well in collagen-coated 96-well culture plates (note that cell loading is effective above 10,000 cells per well). Cells are then incubated for 7 days after seeding, allowing the cells to regain peak metabolic function. On day 7, the cells are switched to a medium containing Pre-induction/Tox supplement containing either the test chemicals or the vehicle controls. Chemically treated media are refreshed on days 8 and 9, and 3 hr after the final treatment, cells are harvested for assessment of DNA damage by CometChip (with the option of using half the cells for cytotoxicity assays such as CellTiterGlo, which can be useful for dose selection; see below). See Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.563#cpz1563-fig-0001] for an overview of the protocol.\nTest chemicals should be formulated as concentrated stock solutions in DMSO or water. Treatment media containing chemicals should be prepared fresh each day of dosing. However, the concentrated stocks can be prepared once and frozen at −20οC until use unless stability data from the literature indicates that fresh daily preparation is needed.\nRange finding experiments can be done using a cell viability assay such as CellTiterGlo, following the manufacturer's protocol. Generally, viability should not go below 50% since dying cells can elicit responses that damage DNA.\nMaterials",

Pre-warm the HepaRG Thawing and Plating Medium in a 37°C water bath for ∼10-15 min.\n2. In a biosafety hood, twist the cryovial cap a quarter turn to release the internal pressure and close it again.",
    "3. Transfer the cryovial to the 37°C water bath. Hold the tip of the cryovial cap and gently agitate the vial for under 1 min until the frozen cells are almost thawed. Hold the tube to avoid letting the water in the water bath touch the rim of the cap.\n4. Wipe the outside of the cryovial with 70% v/v ethanol using absorbent paper and place it in the hood.\n5. Add 8.5 ml of pre-warmed HepaRG Thawing and Plating Medium into a conical tube and then transfer the cell suspension into the conical tube (for a total volume of 9 ml).\n6. Rinse out the cryovial once with 1 ml of the Thawing and Plating Medium and add it to the conical tube (creates a total of 10 ml of cells).\nPlating HepaRG Cells (Day 0)\n7. Using a cell counter, determine the number of cells per ml.\n8. Adjust cell density to 400,000 cells/ml using Thawing and Plating Medium, and plate ∼80,000 cells/well by transferring a volume of 200 μl of the cell stock solution into each well of a collagen-coated 96-well plate.\nOptional: If measuring bulky adducts, prepare an extra plate for supplementation with HU and AraC, as described in steps 15-19.\nNote that with the numbers given above, there are enough cells to create a single 96-well plate with 80,000 cells/well. It is possible to get two plates by loading the cells at 40,000 cells/well. Alternatively, wells with 80,000 cells can ultimately be harvested to yield 40,000 cells for the CometChip and 40,000 cells for viability assays such as CellTiterGlo. Note that only 10,000 cells are needed for loading into CometChip microwells effectively, though loading is more reliable with 40,000 cells/well.\n9. Place plates in a mammalian cell incubator (37°C at 5% CO2).",
    "Renew HepaRG Thawing and Plating Medium (Day 1)\n10. Approximately 24 hr post-plating, pre-warm the HepaRG Thawing and Plating Medium in a 37°C water bath for ∼10-15 min before beginning the media renewal step.\n11. Take out the plates containing the HepaRG cells and inspect the cells under a bright field microscope to confirm adherence and morphology. Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.563#cpz1563-fig-0003] shows the expected morphology.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/14211c36-28f3-4726-874a-9042a71a8004/cpz1563-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nRepresentative image of HepaRG cells. Image of HepaRG cells at D14 of differentiation (i.e., 28 days after seeding of undifferentiated cells). Two distinctive cell populations are observed: the well-differentiated hepatocyte-like cells (raised) that express a full array of human hepatocyte functions and the primitive biliary cells (flat). Scale bar: 100 μm.\n12. Gently aspirate the HepaRG Thawing and Plating Medium from the plate(s) with a pipette and 200-μl tip or with a multi-channel aspirator, being careful not to touch the bottom of the well in order not to disturb the cells. Alternatively, invert the plate to dump culture media into an appropriate container, shaking gently once, to clear spent media from wells.\n13. Add 200 μl of HepaRG Thawing and Plating Medium to each well. Place plate(s) back into the incubator for 3 days.\nBe sure to replace media quickly so that wells do not become dry. It is best to use a multichannel pipetman for this step.\nRenew HepaRG Thawing and Plating Medium (Day 4)\n14. Repeat steps 10-13.\nExposure to Test Chemicals (Day 7)\n15. Gently aspirate or pour off the medium from the plate(s), as described in step 12.\n16. Add 200 μl HepaRG Tox Working Medium containing negative controls (such as DMSO or Media only), positive controls (such as ethyl methane sulfonate), and doses of chemicals of interest to generate dose-response curves at the end of the experiment.",
    "Optional: If measuring bulky adducts, supplement the test media with 1 mM HU and 10 μM AraC.\nIt is important always to include a positive control (expected to induce damage) and negative control (not expected to induce damage) in all experiments.\n17. Place plate(s) back into the incubator, recording the time.\nExposure with Test Chemicals (Day 8)\n18. At 24 ± 1 hr post prior treatment, repeat the procedures described in steps 15-17. Record the time. Dispose of the chemical(s) according to your institution's chemical disposal policy.\nExposure with Test Chemicals (Day 9)\n19. At 24 ± 1 hr post prior treatment, repeat the procedures described in step 18.\nRemoving Test Chemicals and Harvesting Cells (Day 9)\n20. Pre-warm PBS and TrypLE for 15 min in a 37°C water bath before beginning step 21.\n21. At 3 ± 1 hr after the final treatment, gently aspirate/pour off the medium from the plate. Dispose of the chemical(s) according to your institution's chemical disposal policy.\n22. Rinse wells twice with 100 to 200 μl of pre-warmed PBS.\n23. Remove PBS and detach cells by adding 100 μl/well prewarmed TrypLE and placing the plate in the incubator for 10 min. Following incubation, add 100 μl of pre-warmed HepaRG Pre-Induction and Tox Working Medium to each well to terminate trypsinization. Use a multichannel pipet to pipet up and down several times to create a single-cell suspension. Press the tips against the bottom of the plate to generate a shear force that will help to disaggregate the cells.\nCells are now ready to transfer to the CometChip (or for use in other cytotoxicity assays or molecular biology assays, such as Cell Titer Glow, following the manufacturer's protocol).",
    "This protocol describes the CometChip assay, which follows the dosing of cells with chemicals of interest (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.563#cpz1563-prot-0001]). HepaRG cells treated with chemicals and trypsinized with TrypLE to generate single cell suspensions are loaded into the CometChip, excess cells are washed away, and the Chip is capped using low melting point agarose. The cells are then lysed overnight in alkaline buffer. Following cell lysis, the DNA is unwound at high pH and electrophoresis is performed. The ‘comets’ are stained and imaged using a fluorescence microscope, and DNA damage is quantified as % tail in DNA. The methodology described here highlights all of these steps in detail. See Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.563#cpz1563-fig-0002] for an overview of the CometChip protocol.\nMaterials\nTriton X-100\nCrystalline NaCl (VWR, cat. no. 7581)\nTris base (Sigma, cat. no.

To assemble the CometChip, gently remove the Chip (the glass plate coated with agarose harboring thousands of microwells) from the manufacturer's packaging. Pry open the CometChip apparatus using the CometChip key. Gently place the glass plate within the base of the CometChip apparatus. Gently replace the 96-well bottomless plate using the CometChip key to lower it onto the base.",
    "2. Load 100 μl of treated cells (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.563#cpz1563-prot-0001]) into each well of a CometChip apparatus containing the CometChip (gel on glass).\n3. Cover the CometChip apparatus using the lid provided and place it in a 37°C incubator for 15 min total to allow cells to settle into the microwells of the Chip. After 15 min, remove the Chip and gently rock back and forth to aid cell loading. Incubate for an additional 15 min in the 37°C incubator.\n4. While the cells are loading, prepare ∼10 ml of 1% (v/w) low melting agarose and keep it at 37° to 42°C until ready for use. Alternatively, low-melting agarose can be prepared a day in advance and kept at 37° to 42°C.\n5. Remove the Chip (gel on glass) from the CometChip apparatus by prying off the bottomless 96-well plate using the CometChip key provided.\n6. Hold the Chip at a 45° angle over a dish (such as an empty p100 pipette box lid). Gently expel 5 ml warm PBS from a 5-ml pipet as you move the tip of the pipet from the top left to the top right corner perpendicular to the glass plate for a total of 5 s, as shown in Video 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.563#cpz1563-fig-0006]. Remove the excess using a vacuum.\nIt is strongly recommended that this step is practiced prior to the actual experiment. This can be done by practicing loading other cells or just by practicing the movement of the pipet across the plate such that all 5 ml are evenly expelled when going from one corner to the other.",
    "Rinsing too vigorously will lead to cells washing out of the microwells, while rinsing without enough force will lead to comets outside the microwells. It is recommended that the Chip be placed under a bright field microscope to ensure there are cells in the microwells and that there is no excess of cells outside the microwells before proceeding to the next step. It is not necessary for all the wells to be loaded, as ∼30% loading is sufficient for accurate analysis. No more than 10% of the cells should be outside the wells.\n7. Visualize cell loading under a light field microscope to ensure the cells are sufficiently loaded.\n8. Lay the Chip flat on a lab bench and add 7 ml of the molten 1.0% low melting point agarose (at 37° to 42°C) from step 4 onto the Chip to create an agarose overlay, using a 10-ml pipette. Gently release the agarose with a zig-zag pattern over the Chip from left to right, expelling the agarose between the wells. An alternative approach is to drip one drop of molten agarose onto the middle of each of the 96 wells. The end result should be an even layer across the surface. Allow the Chip to gelate at room temperature (3 min), followed by incubation at 4°C for ∼12 min.\n9. While the low melting point agarose is solidifying, complete the process of preparing the cold lysis buffer by adding 1 ml Triton X-100 (complete lysis buffer is 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Keep the lysis buffer at 4°C until use.\n10. Submerge the entire glass Chip in cold lysis buffer and incubate overnight at 1° to 10°C (for example, place Chip in 100 ml lysis buffer in a p1000 pipette tip box lid or glass dish).",
    "11. Place the Chip on the platform of a dry electrophoresis chamber (for example, using the Trevigen CometChip electrophoresis apparatus). Equilibrate the Chip by submerging it in an alkaline electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis chamber for 60 min at 1° to 10°C.\n12. Using the same buffer, electrophorese the Chip in alkaline electrophoresis buffer for 50 min at 1° to 10°C with constant voltage (1 V/cm) and approximately 300 mA amperage.\n13. Neutralize the Chip by submerging it in a neutralization buffer for 15 min at 1° to 10°C. Change the neutralization buffer and incubate for an additional 15 min.\nThis can be performed on a large pipet tip box cover or equivalent with enough buffer to cover the Chip (100-200 ml, depending on the container).\n14. Stain the Chip by submerging it in ∼30 to 50 ml 0.005× SYBR Gold diluted in 1× PBS for 60 min at 1° to 10°C in a pipette tip box lid protected from light.\n15. Image immediately or return to neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris, pH 7.4) until ready for imaging (ideally within 2 hr after staining).\n16. Image using a fluorescent microscope at 4× (ideal) or 10×. At 4×, take one .tiff image for each 96-well to capture at least ∼100 comets per condition (two images may be necessary). To ensure the comet images are not saturated or overexposed, first image one well with multiple exposure times and choose the setting without image saturation. Then, use that setting to image all the remaining wells.\nImages from multiple 96-wells can be combined to attain 100 comets.",
    "17. Analyze comets for percent tail DNA using a comet analysis software such as Trevigen Comet Analysis Software, following the manufacturers’ instructions. To analyze using the Trevigen software, open the analysis software to a 96-well plate format. Drag and drop the .tiff images into the respective plate wells and follow the wizard to analyze the images and export the results containing parameters such as % tail in DNA, tail length, and tail moment into an Excel file.\nResults are usually reported as % tail in DNA."
