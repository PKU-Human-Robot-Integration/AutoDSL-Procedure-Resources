Handle with extreme care and wear appropriate personal protective equipment when using viruses. Wear a double layer of gloves and wear a lab coat or appropriate personal protective equipment. Any used equipment in contact with the viruses (serological pipettes or tips) must be handled in accordance with institutional viral waste handling procedures.\nCritical: It is critical to passage hiPSC at least once post thaw before preparing them for infection and differentiation, since this may affect their infection and differentiation capacity.\nDay -7\nTiming: 2 h\nTo start the transduction procedure (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), plate hiPSC as single cells following the procedure described in supplement protocol “passaging hiPSC as single cells”.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2888-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Detailed protocol of the viral transduction of hiPSC and patterning into iNeurons",
    "(A) The viral transduction of hiPSC starts from Day -7 where the cells are passaged as single cells in a 12-well plate. The following day (Day -6), hiPSC are transduced with NGN2 and Ubi rtTA lentiviral particles. After 2 days of incubation with the viral particles (Day -4), transduced hiPSC are passaged as colonies and cultured over three days. One day prior to neuronal induction (Day -1), transduced cells are plated as single cells in mTeSR Plus media. To start the neuronal induction of hiPSC (Day 0 and Day 1), cells are exposed to D0/1 media containing doxycycline and puromycin. Finally, on Day 2, patterned cells are passaged as single cells in D2 media in the presence of doxycycline and Ara-C to continue with the dopaminergic differentiation steps.\n(B) Representative bright-field microscope images illustrating the morphological changes occurring during the neuronal induction, between Day -1 and Day 2. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nCount cells using a Trypan Blue cell counting method using an automated cell counter or hematocytometer to determine the concentration of the cells in suspension. Only counting live cells when determining the final cell density.\nPlate 3.8 × 105 or (0.95 × 105 cells/cm2) of hiPSC per well of a 12-well plate previously coated with Matrigel in mTeSR Plus medium containing Y-27632 at 10 μM.\nUse healthy hiPSC with minimal spontaneously differentiated cells. Working with high quality hiPSC is very important for the successful generation of iDA neurons. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCulture the cells for 16 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nDay -6\nTiming: 2 h\nThaw lentivirus stocks from −80°C, by placing the tubes on ice.\nBased on the viral titer, use a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for pTetO-NGN2-puro and a MOI of 5 for Ubi rtTA. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].",
    "Note: For the viral titration, a titration kit provided by ABM (ABM; cat. no. LV900) has been used. The protocol[href=https://www.abmgood.com/uploads/document/LV900%20datasheet%20v22%20R21N09A,%20R22Y11A,%20R22E28Bqr.pdf] is based on extracting RNA from viral particles, which is then followed by an RT-qPCR to evaluate the titer. This kit is highly sensitive, and allows for a precise titration of the viral particles against a provided standard. The Ct values are plotted against virus titer, then a logarithmic regression using the standard control DNA dilutions is generated to determine the unknown virus sample titer using y = m ln(x) + b where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. We always ensure that the R2 coefficient, which allows the determination of the statistical measure, is above 0.95. The final equation follows:\nV\ni\nr\nu\ns\nt\ni\nt\ne\nr\n(\nI\nU\n/\nm\nL\n)\n=\ne\n(\nC\nt\n–\nb\n)\n/\nm\n×\n(\nd\ni\nl\nu\nt\ni\no\nn\nf\na\nc\nt\no\nr\n)\nOnce the IU/mL is calculated, several MOI are tested based on the number of cells to be infected. Therefore, the cells used to determine the MOI are the single cell plated hiPSCs.\nPrepare a master mix of the lentiviral particles in 1 mL of mTeSR Plus medium following Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2888_3.csv\nCritical: Make sure to adjust the viral particles volumes based on the viral titer.\nInfect the cells by adding the viral mix dropwise to the cells and incubate the hiPSC for 2 days at 37°C in 5% CO2, until they reach confluency.\nCells can take up to 3 days to reach confluency, depending on the toxicity of the viral particles added.\nEventually, cells will form colonies since they are maintained in mTeSR Plus medium.\nDay -4",
    "Timing: 1 h\nWhen the hiPSC are confluent, split each well of the 12-well plate following steps 47–49 from supplement protocol “routine maintenance and passaging of hiPSC”.\nPlate the cells as colonies in mTeSR Plus medium into a 10-cm plate previously coated with Matrigel.\nDay -3 to day -2\nTiming: 30 min\nStarting from day -3 feed cells with 7 mL of mTeSR Plus (every other day).\nWhen cells are confluent in the 10 cm plates (usually around day -1). Check the cells under a light microscope, you should observe tight colonies with tight edges (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPassage the cells for use in both maintenance and expansion for neuronal differentiation as described in supplement protocol “routine maintenance and passaging of hiPSC” following steps 47–51.\nPause point: At this stage and after transducing hiPSC with the virus, cells can be expanded for maintenance as described in supplement protocol “routine maintenance and passaging of hiPSC” and cryopreserved using the protocol described in supplement protocol “cryopreservation of hiPSC”. Keeping a stock of already transduced cells will save time and avoid the cost of repeated transductions. It is advisable to cryopreserve cells that exhibit the best response to puromycin selection and doxycycline induction. Cryopreserved and transduced cells can be maintained and used up to 10 passages (the use of cells beyond passage 10 has not been attempted).\nPreparing NGN2 expressing hiPSC for neuronal induction\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section describes the treatment of hiPSC with doxycycline to express NGN2 to trigger the neuronal induction of hiPSC to generate iNeurons.\nDay -1\nTiming: 1 h\nTo start the neuronal induction protocol following NGN2 transduction (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), on day -1, once hiPSC become confluent, passage the cells, and plate them as single cells following the procedure described in supplement protocol “passaging hiPSC as single cells”.",
    "Count cells using a Trypan Blue cell counting method using an automated cell counter or hematocytometer to determine the concentration of the cells in suspension. Only take in consideration live cells when determining the final cell density.\nDilute the cells in the desired volume of mTeSR Plus containing 10 μM of Y-27632, and plate 8.5 × 105 or (1 × 105 cells/cm2) cells per 10-cm plate.\nDay 0\nTiming: 1 h\nPrepare the desired volume of D0/1 medium (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) containing puromycin.\nCritical: Puromycin concentration needs to be optimized depending on the hiPSC line used. We have tested puromycin concentrations ranging between 1 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL. Adding puromycin on day 0 will kill off cells not expressing the NGN2/puromycin resistance gene.\nAspirate media from the plate and add 7 mL of D0/1 medium (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) containing puromycin.\nCulture cells for 16 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nDay 1\nTiming: 30 min\nReplace the media on the plates with a fresh 7 mL of D0/1 medium (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) containing puromycin.\nOn day 1, cells may be surrounded by debris after the puromycin selection. The debris observed at this point will not affect the subsequent steps of the protocol.\nOn day 1, cells should start to change morphology (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nDay 2\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nPrepare D2 media (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]), and allow the prepared plates or coverslips coated with PLO/laminin (coating acid-washed glass coverslips with Poly-L-ornithine followed by laminin) to reach 20°C–22°C.\nAspirate the media from the 10-cm plates and wash the cells with DPBS.\nAspirate the DPBS and add 3–4 mL of accutase per 10-cm plate.\nIncubate the plate at 20°C–22°C for 2–3 min.",
    "Check under an inverted microscope for cell detachment, once cells are detached, tap the plate to aid in detaching the cells.\nCritical: It is highly recommended that plates or coverslips are coated with PLO/laminin on day 0 and day 1 of the protocol respectively. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nWithout aspirating the accutase, add 5–6 mL of DMEM/F12 medium containing antibiotic-antimycotic (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nUsing a 5-mL pipette, pipette up and down to ensure the collection of all the cells.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15- or 50-mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the suspended cells at 300 × g for 3 min.\nAspirate media and carefully resuspend cells in 2–5 mL (depending on the size of the cell pellet) of D2 medium (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nUsing a 1-mL filter pipette tip gently triturate the cells, gently pipette again using a filtered 200-μL pipette tip.\nCritical: Do not over-pipette, cells are more fragile at this stage, over-pipetting can reduce cell viability.\nCount cells using a Trypan Blue cell counting method using an automated cell counter or hematocytometer to determine the concentration of the cells in suspension. Only consider live cells when determining the final cell density.\nDilute the cells in the desired volume of D2 medium containing 10 μM of Y-27632 and 2 μM of Ara-C and plate 300 μL of 10–12 × 105 cells (2.4–3 × 105 cells/cm2) per well of a 48-well plate.\nCritical: The recommended medium volume is 0.2–0.5 mL/cm2 , a volume range suggested to allow for adequate gas exchange in the culture plate. In this protocol we use 300 μL media volumes for cells grown in 48 well plates, and this volume is in the right range recommended for adequate cell growth.",
    "Critical: The plating number here is suggested for a 48-well plate, cell numbers should be adjusted based on the plate type used (scale the number of plated cells to the surface area used).\nCritical: Ara-C is recommended as an anti-mitotic agent to eliminate proliferating non-neuronal cells.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCAUTION: Ara-C is a hazardous substance, and it must be handled with caution.\nCulture the cells for 16 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nDifferentiation of NGN2 expressing hiPSC to iDA cells\nTiming: 6 days\nThis section describes the forced differentiation of iNeurons towards the DA phenotype and generation of iDA neurons.\nDay 3\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nDopaminergic neuronal differentiation starts on day 3 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2888-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Detailed protocol of the iDA differentiation and maturation steps\n(A)The dopaminergic differentiation protocol (Day 3 to Day 8) is based on daily media changes with STEMdiff differentiation media supplemented with doxycycline and Shh. On Day 3, culture media is supplemented with Ara-C (1 μM) to further eliminate any remaining proliferating cells. To ensure good quality of the cells, cellular debris are thoroughly washed off using DPBS Ca+ Mg+ prior to media change on Day 4 and Day 5. Between Day 6 and Day 8, daily media changes are performed using STEMdiff differentiation media supplemented with doxycycline and Shh. Starting from Day 9, the maturation protocol starts by replacing full media with STEMdiff Maturation media. Following Day 9, half of the culture media is replaced every 3–4 days.\n(B) Representative bright-field microscope images illustrating the morphological changes occurring during the iDA differentiation and maturation, between Day 3 and Day 26. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nStart by gently taping the plate and carefully wash the cells with DPBS Ca+ Mg+ to wash off any dead cells.",
    "Gently tap the plate again and replace media with 150 μL of warm (37°C) STEMdiff Midbrain Neuron Differentiation medium containing 1 μM of Ara-C + 2 μg/mL of doxycycline per well of a 48-well plate.\nNote: Day 3 is the last day when neuronal media contains Ara-C. Cells start to exhibit neuronal morphology (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nDay 4\nTiming: 1 h\nGently tap the plate and carefully wash the cells with DPBS Ca+ Mg+ to wash off any dead cells.\nGently tap the plate again and replace media with warmed 150 μL (37°C) STEMdiff Midbrain Neuron Differentiation Medium containing 2 μg/mL of doxycycline per well of a 48-well plate.\nIncubate the cells for 16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nDay 5–8\nTiming: 20 min\nPerform daily media changes (300 μL) with warm (37°C) STEMdiff Midbrain Neuron Differentiation Medium containing 2 μg/mL of doxycycline.\nNote: Day 8 will be the last day when neuronal media contains doxycycline.\nEstablishment of mature iDA cells\nTiming: 15 days\nDay 9\nTiming: 30 min\nDopaminergic neuronal maturation starts on day 9 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nReplace STEMdiff Midbrain Neuron Differentiation Medium with 300 μL of STEMdiff Midbrain Neuron Maturation medium per well of a 48-well plate.\nCulture the cells for 16 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nDay 10–25\nTiming: 30 min\nStarting from this step onwards, perform half-medium changes (150 μL) with warm (37°C) STEMdiff Midbrain Neuron Maturation medium every 3–4 days.\nNote: The cells will start to exhibit a mature neuronal morphology (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: Avoid daily monitoring of cells, since this may affect their viability.\nNote: This protocol highlights the rapidity of the approach we have developed1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; however, cells can be cultured for longer periods of time (50–60 days) with medium changes every 4 days. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nDay 26 onwards",
    "On day 26, or later, iDA cells can be characterized; proceed to “characterization of mature iDA cells” and follow the appropriate option. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nCritical: This protocol was established using hiPSC that have been used in different studies in the laboratory,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] which have also been routinely karyotyped, characterized and checked for mycoplasma contamination. In our published paper,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we used multiple hiPSC lines, and we show highly similar levels of successful DA neuronal phenotype.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Nonetheless, we cannot eliminate the possibility of differences in the differentiation kinetics of hiPSC from different donors. Therefore, optimization of MOI requirements for viral transduction, response to puromycin selection and starting cell number plating may be required. Moreover, programming with the NGN2 system, induces a rapid and efficient differentiation of hiPSC into iNeurons, if no neuronal induction is observed at the early time points as presented in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] on day 1, refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] for possible solutions.\nCharacterization of mature iDA cells\nImmunofluorescence analysis to confirm the identity of iDA neurons\nNote: To confirm successful DA neural induction, perform immunofluorescence analysis using a list of mature neuronal markers such as Microtubule Associated Protein 2 (MAP2), and the DA neuronal marker, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as we previously reported1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The neuronal marker (MAP2) is visible as early as day 4 after neuronal induction and the DA marker (TH) is visible as early as day 10 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Note: The present protocol is an optimized version of the protocol we previously published.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This optimization is based on improvements in Ara-C treatment time, and in the maintenance of cells through rigorous washing to eliminate any debris which may affect neuronal health. Most importantly, avoiding cell clumps from accumulating on the plates and/or coverslips has shown to improve the efficiency of the differentiation and maturation protocol allowing for higher TH+ positive cells, and users can expect to achieve a yield of almost 80% of TH + cells as early as day 18 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nCritical: As we previously reported,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we recommend including negative controls during the programming protocol, these controls can include (non-expressing NGN2 hiPSC or NPCs, and NGN2 expressing hiPSC not exposed to the dopaminergic differentiation/maturation protocols). Including such controls will allow for a clear comparison for the phenotypic characteristics associated with DA midbrain neurons, including morphological phenotypes, as well as an expression of midbrain-specific genes and proteins throughout the protocol timeline.\nNote: For the growth and maintenance of NGN2 expressing hiPSC not exposed to the dopaminergic differentiation/maturation protocols follow this: Starting from day 2 onwards, NGN2 expressing hiPSC can be grown in D2 media for the duration of the protocol. Performing half media changes on the cells every 2–3 days.\nFix cells in culture with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 3% (wt/vol) sucrose for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2888-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Prepare a 15-mL tube containing 5 mL of mTeSR Plus medium. Add the hiPSC mixture dropwise into the 5 mL medium containing tube.\nCritical: Do not pipette since it can risk breaking-up the hiPSC colonies.",
    "Centrifuge for 3 min at 300 × g at 20°C–22°C.\nResuspend the pelleted cells in 2 mL of mTeSR Plus medium containing 10 μM of Y-27632.\nAdd the 2 mL of medium containing cells to a 60 mm Matrigel-coated plate.\nRock the plate forward and backward and from side to side to ensure an even plating of the hiPSC on the plate.\nCritical: Do not expose cells to Y-27632 for more than 24 h since long-term exposure to Y-27632 negatively affects the proliferation and survival of hiPSC.\nCulture cells for 16 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nOn the following day, remove the mTeSR Plus medium and replace with fresh mTeSR Plus medium lacking Y-27632.\nNote: From this point, continue to incubate the cells, changing the medium every second day until hiPSC form colonies with diameters ranging from 1 mm-2 mm, reaching around 70% confluency. Depending on the cell line, this can take between 5 to 7 days.\nCritical: Do not overgrow the hiPSC colonies; otherwise, spontaneous differentiation is observed.\nRegularly monitor hiPSC under a light microscope to assess the morphology and health of the colonies.\nNote: If spontaneous differentiation is observed, manually remove these areas using the tip of a pipet tip. Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15].\nWhen cells reach more than 50% confluency, change media every day since it will oxidize quickly.\nNote: From this step onwards, floating cells may be observed in the media, this is due to normal cell death induced by the cells growing as 3D colonies. Troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.17].\nOnce visible colonies are at 70% confluency, passage the hiPSC colonies with EDTA dissociation buffer (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nFirst remove the mTeSR Plus medium, rinse the plate with 2 mL of DPBS.\nAdd 2 mL of EDTA dissociation buffer per 60-mm plate.",
    "Keep the plate at 20°C–22°C for 5–6 min, checking for the detachment of the colonies every 2 min on an inverted microscope.\nOnce the edges of the colonies start to detach, the cells are ready for harvesting.\nAspirate the EDTA dissociation buffer by gently aspirating the buffer.\nCritical: Do not over-incubate the cells with the EDTA dissociation buffer since over-incubation may favor the dissociation of hiPSC as single-cells, which will reduce their viability and promote spontaneous differentiation.\nCritical: Using EDTA as part of the dissociation protocol does not require the need to add Y-27632. Therefore, for routine maintenance of hiPSC, the addition of Y-27632 treatment is optional. Troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.19].\nAdd 2 mL of mTeSR Plus medium and tap the dish to slightly detach the colonies.\nGently pipetting up and down 2 to 3 times with a 5-mL pipette.\nDetach and collect the colonies from the plate.\nCritical: Do not over pipette; if the colonies fragment excessively, the yield of hiPSC will be affected. If the colonies are too small, or too big, the colonies will spontaneously differentiate.\nCritical: Make sure to use a 5-mL pipette, smaller pipettes or micropipettes will excessively fragment the colonies.\nPlate the hiPSC colonies at a ratio of 1:20 (relative to the volume of starting media suspension; it’s usually one to two drops of the media containing cells) into fresh Matrigel-coated pre-filled with 2.5 mL of mTeSR Plus medium.\nRock the plate forward and backward and from side to side to ensure an even plating of the hiPSC colonies on the plate.\nIncubate the cells for 5–7 days and change the medium every second day with mTeSR Plus medium until hiPSC form colonies with diameters ranging from 1 mm-2 mm.\nRegularly monitor hiPSC under a light microscope to assess the morphology and health of the colonies.",
    "Note: If spontaneous differentiation is observed, manually remove these areas using the tip of a pipet tip by scratching.\nAlternatives: Here we use mTeSR Plus medium, other media such as mTeSR™1, StemFlex, Essential 8 Medium can be used for the maintenance and culture of hiPSC. It is highly recommended to use one kind of media, and not change the type of mTeSR the hiPSC cells were first exposed to.\nPause point: Expanded hiPSC need to be passaged at least one before starting the NGN2 reprogramming protocol. Likewise, hiPSC colonies cells can be cryopreserved following the procedure described in supplement protocol “cryopreservation of hiPSC” after at least 1 passage post thawing.\nCryopreservation of hiPSC\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nFor the cryopreservation of hiPSC, collect the cells following steps 47-49 from supplement protocol “routine maintenance and passaging of hiPSC”.\nThaw a mFreSR aliquot at 4°C or on ice.\nNote: After thawing aliquots, use immediately.
