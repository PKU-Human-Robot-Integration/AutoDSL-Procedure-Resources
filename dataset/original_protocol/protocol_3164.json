The weight of dried cell material\n      will depend on the cell culture efficiency but should be on the order of\n      1–10 mg.\n    \nAdd 4 mL 0.01% BHT solution to all samples in the 15 mL tube.\n        Tear the sample using the Tissue-Tearor.\n        \n            Place 15 mL tube with sample and BHT reagent in a larger tube (50 mL\n            or similar) filled with ice. This is to keep the sample cold while\n            tissue tearing.\n          \n            Insert the Tearor probe into the liquid in the 15 mL tube until the\n            metal reaches near the bottom.\n            \n                Slowly turn on the Tissue-Tearor on until the speed of 6000–8000\n                RPM (6–8 on the motor switch) is reached.\n              \n                Tear the sample for 2 × 20 s pulses, pausing in between each\n                pulse for 10 s to allow the sample to cool.\n              \n        Rinse the Tissue-Tearor.\n        \n            Have three separate beakers (RO water, EtOH, and RO water), filled\n            with enough liquid to cover the tearing probe.\n          \n            Pulse the probe for 20 s in each of the three breakers, RO, EtOH,\n            and RO to clean the probe between each sample.\n          \n            Replace the first RO water rinse after every new sample. The EtOH\n            and second RO wash can be replaced at will when they appear dirty.\n          \n        Repeat steps 2–3 for all samples.\n        \n            Store prepared samples, capped, on ice while preparing the\n            remaining.\n          \n        Lipid extract the samples.\n        \n            Pour 5 mL of cold Folch solution into the 15 mL tube which already\n            contains the sample and BHT solution. Pour another 5 mL of Folch",
    "solution into a separate, clean 15 mL tube – this will be used for\n            lipid recovery.\n          \n            Place 15 mL tube with sample and BHT reagent in a larger tube (50 mL\n            or similar) filled with ice. This is to keep the sample cold while\n            tissue tearing.\n          \n            Insert the Tearor probe into the sample tube until the metal reaches\n            near the bottom.\n            \n                Slowly turn on the Tissue-Tearor until the speed of 6000–8000\n                RPM (6–8 on the motor) is reached.\n              \n                Tear the sample for 2 × 20 s pulses, pausing in between each\n                pulse to allow the sample to cool. Set aside on ice.\n              \n            Using the additional 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of Folch solution,\n            insert the Tearor probe into the liquid until the metal reaches near\n            the bottom.\n            \n                Slowly turn on the Tissue-Tearor until the speed of 6000–8000\n                RPM (6–8 on the motor) is reached.\n              \n                Tear the liquid for 1 × 20 s.

This is to prevent lipid oxidation\n      during the extraction.\n    \nCritical: Do not cross contaminate\n      12C and 13C treatments. New reagents for rinsing and\n      new lab materials shall be used for each treatment group. The Tissue\n      Tearor should be thoroughly cleaned between each groups processing.\n      12C treatment controls should be processed alongside samples\n      and analyzed to ensure no 13C contamination throughout the\n      laboratory processesing.\n    \nNote: For the Pasteur pipetting, any\n      pipette bulb or an autopipette can be used to preference.\n    \nPause point: If pausing for several\n      hours, add 250 μL of DCM to the glass culture tubes and store in a −20°C\n      freezer.\n    \nLipid hydrolysis and isolation",

However, as this does not allow for molecular\n      identification through the additional MS function as the GC-C-MS-IRMS",
    "does, an internal standard containing the additional fatty-acids must be\n      analyzed as well.\n    \n      Compound-specific isotope analysis of sterols and fatty acids on\n      GC-C-MS-IRMS\n    \nTiming: 70 min per replicate injection\n    \n      This section describes analysis of the derivative (previous section) via\n      Isotope ratio gas chromatography. This protocol uses Thermo GC IsoLink II\n      with ConFlo IV interface coupled to a Thermo DeltaV Advantage isotope\n      ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) and a Thermo triple quadrupole mass\n      spectrometer (TSQ-MS). This system allows for simultaneous identification\n      of a sample’s constituents (MS) and their stable isotope ratio (IRMS).\n    \n        After warming up the instrument, checking the backgrounds for the day\n        and conditioning of the analytical column for the day, it is possible to\n        start the analysis.\n      \n        Analyze 1–2 blanks before analysis (inject DCM or Ethyl-Acetate), to\n        ensure the instrument is working properly.\n      \n        The cholesterol standard should be analyzed in duplicate at the\n        beginning. Each unknown should be analyzed at least in duplicate,\n        although triplicate is best to constrain variation.\n      \n        A typical analytical analysis would be set up like:\n        \n            Blank, Blank, Cholesterol Standard, Cholesterol Standard, Unknown\n            1_a, Unknown 1_b, Unknown 1_c, Blank, Cholesterol Standard, Unknown\n            2_a, Unknown 2_b, Unknown 2_c, ... ..., Blank, Cholesterol Standard.\n          \nNote: The GC was fitted with a\n      60 m × 0.32 mm x 1 μm ID non-polar fused silica DB-5MS column and run in\n      spitless mode. Helium was used as the carrier gas with flow rate of 2.0 mL\n      min−1. The GC oven programme was 60°C for 1 min, 60°C–140°C at\n      15°C/min, 140°C–300°C at 4°C/min and then held isothermally at 300°C for\n      23 min.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] The backflush was left on for the\n      first 20 min to flush any solvent. The combustion furnace was set to\n      1000°C. 1 μL of each sample was injected using a autosampler. Samples were",
    "analysed in duplicate for the original publication. Future studies could\n      modify the oven method to increase the initial oven temperature ramp until\n      the first peak elution, during the solvent backflush, to decrease overall\n      analysis time. However, for full peak separation of analytes, it is\n      important to keep the oven temperature ramping slow after the solvent is\n      burnt off.\n    \nNote: Lipid peaks were identified using\n      the National Institute of Standards and Technology library. Additionally,\n      cholesterol peaks were identified by comparing structure and peak\n      retention times with the in-house cholesterol standard. Derivatisation\n      induced carbon offsets were corrected for each sample based on the known\n      isotope value of the cholesterol standard, which was measured in powder\n      form by a Eurovector Euro EA 3000 coupled to an IRMS (Nu perspective\n      IRMS). Blanks followed by a cholesterol standard were run after every\n      three unknowns in the sequence to eliminate carry-over effects.\n    \nNote: This protocol can also be applied to\n      a standard GC-C-IRMS if proper standards are run along with the sample, to\n      allow for chromatography peak identification and consistent analyte\n      retention times (see previous Notes).\n    \nNote: These analytes come through in\n      derivative form, with additional carbon atoms from the derivatization\n      process."
