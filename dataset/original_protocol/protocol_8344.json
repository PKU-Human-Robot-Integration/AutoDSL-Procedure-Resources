  "procedures": [
    "PV-Cre knock-in male mice59, 10-25 weeks old, were used. Mice were housed under standard conditions in the animal facility and kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle. All procedures were performed in accordance with national and international guidelines, and were approved by the local health authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, Nordrhein-Westfalen).\n1. Viral Injection\nDuring the whole procedure, follow biological safety guidelines60. Wear a lab coat, a surgical mask, a hairnet, and two pairs of gloves.\nCut tubing with a sterile scalpel or scissors to approximately 1 m length, insert it in the syringe holder block of the pump, and fix it.\n\t\nFill the tubing entirely with silicon oil by using the syringe.\nCheck whether air bubbles appear in the tubing. If air bubbles are observed, refill the tubing again with oil.\nFix the plunger to the pusher block.\nSlowly advance the pusher towards the syringe holder block until the tip of the plunger touches the tubing.\nInsert the tip of the plunger into the tubing and automatically move the pusher block forward at a slow speed by selecting \"Infuse\" in the command window and a low infusion rate (e.g., 500 nL/min) until it reaches the syringe holder block.\nPrepare the injection needle (34G).\n\t\nRemove the needle hub with a clear cut using a precision drill/grinder connected to a cutting disk. If necessary, use a needle to remove metal residues from the freshly cut surface.\nThread capillary tubing (3-4 cm length) through the needle.\nGlue the needle to the tubing with super glue.\nConnect the injection needle to the end of the tubing, which connects to the microsyringe pump.\nAttach the needle to the stereotaxic holder.\nWithdraw air until an air bubble in the transparent tube above the needle is visible.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with 1.5-3% isoflurane in oxygen. Wait approximately 2-3 min, then confirm that the mouse is fully anesthetized by assessing its response to a toe pinch. Throughout the surgery monitor the animal's breathing and adjust isoflurane concentration if required.\nPlace the mouse in the stereotactic frame using non-traumatic ear holders.\nProtect the eyes of the mouse with a lipid gel.\nInject 0.1 mL lidocaine intradermally under the head skin using a 0.01-1 mL syringe and a 26G injection cannula.\nShave and disinfect the mouse's head using ethanol solution. Then alternate three times 2 % chlorhexidine with ethanol to  disinfect the surgical site.\nPerform a midline incision using fine and sharp scissors going from between the back of the ears to the level of the eyes so that the bregma and lambda are visible.\nClean the skull by applying approximately 50 µL of NaCl using a syringe and dry with a paper tissue and an air puff.\nPosition the mouse head by adjusting the dorso-ventral level of the nose clamp so that the bregma and lambda are on the same dorso-ventral level (± 0.3 mm).\nDrill a hole above the MS (AP 0.98 and L 0.5 mm in reference to the bregma).\nAt this point, defrost an aliquot of the virus (should contain at least 2 µL of AAV2/1.CAGGS.flex.ChR2.tdTomato.WPRESV40) for approximately 5 min at room temperature (RT).\nCentrifuge the aliquot at approximately 4,000 x g at RT for 1 min.\nPipette the 2 µL of the virus onto a piece of Parafilm; use the previously protected side.",
    "Submerge the tip of the injection needle in the liquid and carefully withdraw at about 500 nL/min while observing the level of the liquid. To prevent air suctioning, stop withdrawal before the virus is entirely taken up. Adjust the withdraw rate according to the solution viscosity; a faster rate can facilitate withdrawal of a virus with higher viscosity.\nClean the needle with a paper tissue.\nCheck that the virus is contained in the tube and the virus and oil are separated by an air bubble. Mark the level of the virus on the tube in order to control whether virus is successfully infused during the injection.\nPosition the needle above the craniotomy and slowly insert it into the brain at the first injection point (AP 0.98, L 0.5, V -5.2, 5.5° lateral).\nInject 450 nL of the virus at a rate of 100-150 nL/min. Wait for 10 min. Carefully move the needle up 0.1 mm and wait another 5 min.\n\t\nMove the needle to the second injection point (AP 0.98, L 0.5, V -4.6) and inject another 450 nL at 100-150 nL/min.\nWait again for 10 min before moving the needle up 0.1 mm. Wait another 5 min before removing the needle.\nSuture the incision with Silk Black Braided suture using square knots. Warm the animal with a red lamp to speed up the recovery. Administer antibiotics (0.3 mL Erycinum (1:4 in sterile NaCl)) and carprofen i.p. daily 2-3 days after surgery.\nCut the tube above the mark that indicated the level of the virus. The tube can be used for further injections. Prepare a fresh injection needle before each injection.",
    "NOTE: This surgery takes about 1-1.5 h. The animal wakes up typically within 5 min after surgery. Wait a minimum time of 6 weeks for sufficient axonal expression but not longer than 5 months before performing stereotactic implantations, as expression levels begin to decrease approximately 6 months after the virus injection.\n2. Preparation of Optic Fibers (Figure 1A)\nUse multimode optic fiber (105 µm core, glass clad with silica core, 0.22 NA). Strip 125 µm cladding of the fiber core using a micro-stripper while the fiber is still attached to the fiber spool.\nCut the fiber to a length of approximately 2-3 cm using a diamond knife.\nInsert the fiber in a zirconia ceramic stick ferrule (ID: 126 µm). Approximately 0.5-1 mm of the optic fiber should protrude from the convex side of the ferrule.\nUsing a needle, apply one drop of epoxy glue to both ends of the ferrule but not onto the sides of the ferrule. Alternatively, use super glue.\nAllow the glue to dry for at least 30 min.\nPolish the convex side of the ferrule using diamond lapping fiber polishing film (3 µm grits).\nTest the fidelity of light transfer using an optical power meter.\n\t\nSet the wavelength on the power meter to the same wavelength as the laser being used.\nPosition the patch cord with the tip facing the center of the sensor. Power on the laser and read the light output from the power meter. Record the value.\nConnect the optic fiber to the patch cord via a mating sleeve and position it with the tip of the fiber facing the center of the sensor. Power on the laser and read the light output from the power meter. Record the value.",
    "Calculate the transmission rate: divide the second value by the first value. If the transmission rate is below 0.5, discard the fiber, otherwise use it for implantation.\nTest the transmission rate for each fiber before implantation.\nFor later experiments, adjust the light intensity output of the laser to the transmission rate of the optic fiber: set the light output from the patch cord tip to 5-15 divided by the transmission rate to achieve a final light output from the fiber tip of 5-15 mW.\n\t\tNOTE: See also ref. 61 for the preparation of optic fibers.\n3. Preparation of Tungsten Wire Arrays for LFP Recordings (Figure 1B)\nGlue several (for example 6) 100 µm silica tube guides in parallel to the sticky side of a piece of tape. Cut one piece, approximately 4-6 mm, for one wire array assembly.\nThread formvar-insulated 45 µm tungsten wires through the guide tubes using forceps.\nStrip six enamel-insulated fine copper bonding wires (approximately 5 mm long) and a grounding wire (approximately 2-3 cm long) by using a scalpel to scrape away the insulation on both ends. Solder them to the nanoconnector pins.\nConnect each bonding wire to one tungsten wire using one drop of silver conductive paint, respectively. Let dry for at least 30 min.\nApply a minimum amount of cement to cover the wires. Do not apply cement on the tungsten wires, which will be inserted in the brain tissue or on the upper part of the nanoconnector. Let the cement dry for at least 30 min.\nPerform an angular cut (5-20°) of the tungsten wires using blunt stainless-steel scissors to enable reliable implantation of wires below or above the zone ventrally adjacent to the stratum pyramidale, where theta amplitude is too low for the estimation of the entrainment fidelity.",
    "Deinsulate the tip (approximately 2 mm) of the ground wire by using a scalpel to scrape away the insulation. Treat it with flux and presolder.\nCheck potential cross-talks between electrodes using a digital multimeter. To do so, connect the connector pins to the multimeter, which must be set to the resistance measurement mode. Check pairwise combinations of channels; a reading on the multimeter below 5 MΩ indicates significant cross-talk.\nCheck the impedance of each wire electrode in saline using an impedance meter. Typical impedance values are below 100 kΩ.\nTo facilitate implantation, glue one optic fiber to the wire array so that the tip of the fiber is at the level of the shortest wire and the fiber tip is in close proximity, but not touching the tungsten wires. Keep the angle of the fiber as small as possible in order to prevent tissue damage during implantation.\n\tNOTE: See also ref. 62 for fabrication of tungsten wire arrays.\n4. Stereotaxic Implantations\nPerform preparations as described in steps 1.6-1.13.\nRemove the connective tissue from the top of the skull and push down neck muscles thoroughly by approximately 2 mm to prevent muscle artifacts during the recording.\nClean the skull using a cotton-tip applicator and saline, and drill 4 holes (2 in the front and 2 above the cerebellum, 0.8 mm diameter) to place bone stainless-steel screws (00-96x1/16) for ground and stabilization of the implant (Figure 1D). Position the ground screw, connected to one copper wire (approximately 2-3 cm length) above the cerebellum.\nCover the ground-screw completely with cement to prevent muscle artifacts during the electrophysiological recordings. Build a cement ring connecting all screws (Figure 1E).",
    "Perform a craniotomy above the implantation side (Hippocampus, AP -1.94, L 1.4, V 1.4 in reference to the bregma). Apply approximately 5 µL of sterile NaCl on the surface of the brain tissue.\nSlowly lower the wire array using stereotaxis in the craniotomy. For unitary recordings, implant a silicone probe instead of a wire array63; in order to prevent optoelectric light artifacts, implant the optic fiber separately in the hippocampus with the fiber tip not directly facing the probe (Figure 1C - I). For investigation of the coordination of the entrainment between hemispheres, implant an additional optic fiber in the contralateral hippocampal CA1 area.\nApply approximately 5 µL of warm liquid wax/paraffin oil, preheated at 70 °C, with a syringe above the implantation site to protect brain tissue.\nApply cement around the wire array and cover the skull with cement.\nApply one drop of flux to the presoldered ground/reference wire and the presoldered wire connected to the ground screw using for instance a needle, and fuse the wires using a soldering machine.\nCover the entire ground wire with cement.\nAdminister 0.3 mL Erycinum (1:4 in sterile NaCl) and carprofen (5mg/mL) i.p. after surgery and for at least the two days following. The mouse typically wakes up within 15 min following surgery. Warm the animal with a red lamp to speed up recovery.\nMonitor the weight of the mouse daily for the first week following the surgery or until the weight is stable. Weight loss should not exceed 10% of the mouse weight recorded before surgery. To accelerate stabilization of weight, supply the mouse with wet food and condensed milk during the first days following the surgery.",
    "To record hippocampal cellular activity during entrainment, implant a silicone probe in the hippocampus (AP -1.94, L 1.4, V 1, with subsequent lowering) as described in ref. 62 (Figure 1C - I). Implant the optic fiber in the hippocampus at AP -3, L 1.4, V 1.6, 39° caudal-rostral. Implant an additional optic fiber in the MS (AP +0.98, L 1, V 3.9, 15° lateral) if stimulation of cell somata is desired.\n5. Optogenetic Stimulation and Electrophysiological Data Acquisition\nHabituate the mouse to the recording setup (e.g., 15 min sessions, 1-2 sessions per day for 3 days). Examine the animal's behavior before starting with the first experiments. If the mouse is moving in the chamber, exploring the environment, sniffing, performing rearings, etc., start the first experimental session.\nPlace the mouse in a familiar chamber in the absence of other animals in the same room.\nAttach an LED to the head-stage using adhesive tape to track the animal's position. Make sure that the LED light is captured by the camera throughout the period that the animal is exploring the recording chamber before starting the experiments. Record in the dark in order to track the LED light. Position a camera above the recording chamber.\nCheck the light output from the patch cord. Estimate the light output from the fiber tip after connection depending on transmission rate of the fiber implanted. Ensure that the light output from the tip of the fiber is between 5-15 mW, to enable reliable entrainment.\nConnect the headstage preamplifier to the chronically implanted connector. Connect the fiberoptic patch cord to the chronically implanted hippocampal fiber for optogenetic stimulation experiments. In control light stimulation experiments, connect the optic fiber to a dummy ferrule connected to the headset.\nPlace the mouse in the recording chamber.",
    "Open the software to control the stimulus generator to generate the stimulation protocol.\nSelect the channel that controls the 473 nm DPSS laser. In the first row enter 3,000 mV (1st column), time 30 ms (2nd column), value 0 mV (3rd column), time 112 ms (4th column), row repeat 840, and group repeat 1, to generate a protocol for 2 min of 7 Hz stimulation with 30 ms long pulses. Adjust the time duration in the 4th column and number of row repetitions if the stimulation at another frequency or a different duration is required. In the second row select 0 mW (1st column), time 500 h (2nd column), row repeat 1, and group repeat 1, to ensure that the laser is being switched off after the stimulation protocol is terminated.\nClick \"File > Save as\" and save the file with a desired name.\nAssure that the stimulator TTL output triggering the laser is connected to the Digital Lynx analog input board to synchronize the acquisition of electrophysiological and optogenetic data.\nAlternatively, to parametrically regulate the variability of theta oscillation frequency, apply trains of light pulses at varying inter-pulse intervals, with periods following a Gaussian distribution. Modify the dispersion of inter-pulse intervals for different protocols, e.g., from step 3.2 to 15.1 ms2. Apply these protocols to generate theta epochs with different variability of the theta frequency (Figure 6).\nOpen the software of the recording system. Click on \"ACQ\" to acquire and \"REC\" to record. Wait before initiation of the light stimulation to record the baseline behavior (e.g., 2 min to retrieve baseline speed or 30 min to extract the baseline place fields).\nOpen the software to control the stimulus generator. Click \"File > Open\" and select the protocol file of choice. Click \"Download and Start\" to initiate the light stimulation.",
    "NOTE: The experiment can be surveyed, and the stimulation started via remote control; this excludes the influence of the presence of the experimenter on the animal's behavior. Depending on the goal of the study, stimulation can be initiated and terminated during specific behaviors.\n6. A Combined Approach for Optogenetic Entrainment and Projection-specific Inhibition of the Hippocampal Output\nExpress ChR2 in MS GABAergic cells of PV-Cre mice, as described in section 1.\nIn addition, inject a total of 2.4 µL of CamKIIα dependent halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0, AAV2/1.CamKIIa.eNpHR3.0-EYFP.WPRE.hGH) in both dorsal hippocampal hemispheres (AP -1.7; L ± 1.05; V -2.05 and -1.4 mm; AP -1.7; L ± 1.7; V -2.05 and -1.55 mm; AP -2.3; L ± 1.5; V -2.2 and -1.3 mm; AP -2.3; L ± 2.2; V -1.65 and -2.45 mm).\nAllow 6 weeks of expression time.\nImplant a tungsten wire array with optic fiber in the hippocampal CA1 region, as described in section 4. Additionally, implant bilaterally optic fibers in the lateral septum (LS, AP 0.1, L 0.25, V -2.25 mm, and AP 0.5, L -0.3, V -2.7 mm).\nPerform optogenetic theta entrainment experiments as described in steps 5.4-5.5.\n\t\nFor simultaneous inhibition of the hippocampal output to the LS, generate a protocol stimulus generation: e.g., trigger the onset of the output channel connected to the 593 nm DPSS laser 15 s with a continuous pulse lasting in total 45 s, before triggering the pulses output to the 473 nm DPSS laser.\nConnect both fibers in the LS via patch cords using a multimode fiber optic coupler to a 593 nm DPSS laser.\nStart the recording and download and trigger the protocol to control the stimulus generation.\n7. Data Processing\nConvert the electrophysiological signals and position the tracking data with Neurophysiological Data (ND) Manager to .dat and .pos formats, respectively64.",
    "Obtain the LFP by low-pass filtering and down-sampling of the wide-band signal to 1,250 Hz using ND Manager66.\nIn each recording, select the channel with the maximal amplitude of theta oscillations (using Neuroscope)19.\nDetect the timestamps of the laser pulses and of the stimulation epochs with a threshold detecting algorithm (using MATLAB function findpeaks.m or similar)11.\nTo import the .dat file in a multi-channel data analysis software, click \"File > Import\", select \"binary files\" as the data type, and select the .dat file. In the configuration dialog, enter the correct number of channels and a sampling rate of 1,250 Hz, click \"ok\", and save as .smr file. Plot power spectra by selecting \"Analysis > New Result View > PowerSpectrum\". In the settings, select the channel with the highest theta amplitude and 16,384 FFT size, click \"New\", define as \"Start time\" the beginning of the stimulation epoch and as \"End time\" the end of the stimulation epoch, and click \"Process\".\nCalculate the entrainment fidelity as the ratio of the cumulative power spectral density (PSD) within the optogenetic stimulation frequency range (stimulation frequency ± 0.5 Hz), to the cumulative PSD in the theta (5-12 Hz) band with the multitaper method (NW = 3, window size 8,192) for 10 s epochs (e.g., toolkit <http://chronux.org/>).\nExclude recording epochs where the dominant PSD peak is ≤ 5 Hz from analysis (non- theta epochs, using MATLAB function find.m).\nPlot the raster of the LFP power spectra for all recorded epochs according to the computed entrainment fidelity (using MATLAB functions sortrows.m and pcolor.m). Load the power spectra and entrainment fidelity by clicking \"File > Open\", stored variable In. Type Power = sortrows(In,1); pcolor(Power(:,2:end)).\nSubscription Required.
