    "Identification of Syntenic Genes among Closely Related SpeciesRetrieve gene sequence For given plant genomes of which the genome annotation is available, download the coding sequences (CDS) and protein sequences of all the protein-encoding genes from corresponding databases. Some species have their respective websites, such as Arabidopsis TAIR (https://www.arabidopsis.org/[href=https://www.arabidopsis.org/]), soybean SoyBase (https://soybase.org/[href=https://soybase.org/]), and maize MaizeGDB (https://www.maizegdb.org/[href=https://www.maizegdb.org/]), etc. The sequences of many of other species were deposited at NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/]), CoGe (https://genomevolution.org/coge/[href=https://genomevolution.org/coge/]), Phytozome (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html[href=https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html]) or other relevant databases. We downloaded all the genome sequences and gene annotation of soybean (v1.1, Schmutz et al., 2010) and common bean (Schmutz et al., 2014) from Phytozome.Removal of transposon-related and hypothetical proteinsIn order to detect highly confident syntelogs among closely related species, transposon-related and hypothetical proteins were first removed using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997). Taking soybean (v1.1) as an example, in total 53,927 annotated genes from the 20 soybean chromosomes were BLASTN queried against the soybean transposon database SoyTEdb (Du et al., 2010, https://www.soybase.org/soytedb/[href=https://www.soybase.org/soytedb/]). Any genes over the 80% of the total length matching the transposon-related sequences with the sequence similarities of greater than 80% were removed. Genes annotated as hypothetical proteins were excluded as well (Figure 1). Here is a typical setting for doing local blast.formatdb -i SoyBase_TE_Fasta.txt -p F -o Tblastall -p blastn -i Soybean_gene_cds.fa -d SoyBase_TE_Fasta.txt -m 8 -a 8 -o Soybean_gene_cds_blast_TEsNote: Hypothetical proteins were identified based on the gene annotation file. The genes annotated as hypothetical proteins were not included in the analysis. Here formatdb is to format the nucleotide source database “SoyBase_TE_Fasta.txt” before it can be searched using blastall. blastall is used to compare the gene sequences in the file “Soybean_gene_cds.fa” with the database “SoyBase_TE_Fasta.txt”. A detailed description of each parameter can be found in the software manual.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181130/20181130013024_1757.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Bioinformatics pipeline for identification and comparison of the syntenic homologous genes in soybean and common bean. The solid and the dotted circles indicate the presence and absence of the genes in the corresponding genomes, respectively. GmA and GmB represent either of the duplicated genes in soybean. Gm, Glycine max, soybean; Pv, Phaseolus vulgaris, common bean. This figure was modified from Zhao et al., 2017.Detection of candidate syntelogsThe remaining protein-encoding genes in soybean and common bean were used to do an all-against-all BLASTP search using default parameters, with the E-value cutoff 10-10 (Altschul et al., 1997). For each pair of genes, BLAST hits were loaded to the software MCScanX (Wang et al., 2012) to scan the syntelog homologous gene pairs.blastall -p blastp -i Soybean_gene_pep.fa -d Commonbean_gene_pep.fa -m 8 -a 8 -F F -o Soybean _blast_CommonbeanMCScanX Soybean_CommonBeanNote: The setting of E-value is based on the rough divergence time. You can leave it as default setting if the divergence time is unknown. Please prepare the required gff file for all gene locations to MCScanX. Syntenic gene pairs between soybean and common bean were identified with MCScanX’s default settings (Match Score = 50, Match Size = 5, Gap Penalty = -1, Overlap Window = 5, Max Gaps = 25 and an E-value cutoff 10-10). Post process the candidate syntelogous genesSince soybean has undergone a whole genome duplication after its split with common bean, the genes in the common bean genomes were corresponding to one or two copies in the soybean genome, depending on the duplication status of the genes retained in soybean. MCScanX provided all the homologous gene pairs in addition to syntelogous gene pairs. In order to remove the false positive syntelogous genes, the duplicated block information from the reference genome was incorporated (Schmutz et al.",
    ", 2014) to keep the homologous gene pairs detected in the duplicated regions and showing syntenic relationship between soybean and common bean.   Example of the final list of candidate syntelogous genes was shown in Table 1. Genes involved in tandem duplication have an ambiguous retention status and thus were put aside for separate analysis.Table 1.

The nucleotide sequences of the syntenic genes were aligned using the MUSCLE program (Edgar, 2004) or ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994) using default parameters. The alignment can be viewed by Jalview (Figure 2A). muscle -in input -out output or clustalw inputNote: The primary transcripts of the genes were determined based on the gene annotation file which shows the primary transcripts of the genes. MUSCLE or ClustalW can only run one group of syntelogs at a time. For whole genome level analysis, we recommend that the authors write a Perl or Python script to automatically load each pair of sequences to MUSCLE or ClustalW to do the alignment. At this step, we used MUSCLE to run the alignment first, and then performed ClustalW for the remained gene pairs of which the nucleotide alignments were not integer multiples of three after MUSCLE alignment.  Manual inspection The output alignment was manually inspected to modify incorrectly aligned nucleotides. This step is very important although it may not be practical if there is a very large amount of data to verify (Figure 2B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181130/20181130013100_4312.jpgFigure 2.",

Blue boxes indicate modified regions.Sequence divergenceAll pairwise alignments of the syntenic genes were prepared into the required format by the PAML software using Perl or Python programming in order to calculate non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution using the yn00 and baseml modules with the default parameters except model was set to 1 instead of 0 (Yang, 2007). Please refer to the manual for more information about running programs in the PAML package.Phylogenetic analysisPhylogenetic trees are used to tell the phylogenetic relationship among homologous genes.
