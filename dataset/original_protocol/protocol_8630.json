    "NOTE: This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendation of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. The animal protocol was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Primary Astrocyte Culture protocol that is presented here is adopted from the protocols presented by Zhang Y19 et al. and Cengiz P20 et al. with some modifications.\n1. Hippocampal Dissection and Astrocyte Culture\nPrepare all necessary reagents and materials including surgical scissors, smooth fine forceps, flat tip forceps, paper towels, waste bag, 70% ethanol and 2 dissecting dishes (3.5 cm diameter) on ice filled with 2 mL Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) each. Make sure the surgical equipment's are sterile (autoclave) prior to procedure and use all other materials (Astrocyte plating medium: DMEM + 5% horse serum + 1% penicillin-streptomycin, horse serum, HBSS, 0.25% trypsin, glass coverslips, Petri dishes, 15/50 mL tubes, T25 flasks, etc.) as pre-sterile.\nGently hold and spray the head and neck of mouse pup with 70% ethanol and decapitate using sharp sterile scissors [Figure 1 (1)].\nPerform a midline incision from posterior to anterior skull with small scissors along the scalp to expose the brain [Figure 1 (2-3)].\nCut the cranium carefully from the neck to the nose with small scissors. Then cut cranium anterior to the olfactory bulbs and inferior to the cerebellum to disconnect the cranium from the skull base.\nMake a small incision at the base of the skull and cut along the midline. Use sterile flat-tip forceps to peel away the skull. Remove the brain stem with the help of a curved forceps. Remove brain from the cranium and place into the first dissecting dish [Figure 1 (4-9)]21.",
    "Using a curved forceps, flip the brain so that the ventral surface of the brain is facing up and then separate both hemispheres with a sharp sterile surgical blade [Figure 1 (10,11)]\nPeel back the cerebral hemispheres and carefully remove the bulging midbrain and thalamic tissue with a sterile flat curved forceps to reveal the hippocampus, a small, seahorse-shaped structure in the medial temporal lobe [Figure 1 (12-14)].\nRemove both the hippocampal lobes [Figure 1 (15,16)] and carefully dissect the meninges from the lobes by pulling with the fine forceps. This step avoids contamination of the final astrocyte culture by meningeal cells and fibroblasts.\nTransfer the prepared hippocampal lobes into the second dish filled with HBSS and return it onto ice [Figure 1 (17,18)]. Pool both hippocampal lobes from a single mouse (P0 - P2) for preparation of hippocampal astrocyte cultures. This gives the astrocyte proper density. Mince hippocampal lobes using a sharp sterile surgical blade (approximately 4 times).\nAspirate HBSS from dish using a sterile tip attached to a 1 mL pipette and add 3 mL of 0.25% trypsin, mix, transfer to a 15 mL sterile conical tube and incubate the tissue at 37 °C for 20 min with gentle shaking.\nCentrifuge tube at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant carefully using a sterile glass pipette attached to a vacuum line. Add 10 mL astrocyte plating medium and triturate (20 - 30 times) using a fire polished glass pipette until tissue pieces homogenize.\nCentrifuge tube at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant and add 2 mL of fresh prewarmed astrocyte plating media. Pass cells through a 70 μm mesh filter (cell strainer) into a new 50 mL conical tube.",
    "Plate entire cell suspension on a Poly-D-Lysine/Laminin coated sterile T25 culture flask containing 3 mL of astrocyte plating media, then incubate the flask at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nAspirate entire media at day-in-vitro (DIV) 1, DIV 3 and DIV 7, and replace with 2 mL of fresh astrocyte plating media. Observe the progression and astrocytic confluence under light microscope each time while replacing the astrocyte plating media.\n\tNOTE: At DIV 1, all the viable astrocytes are attached to the surface of the culture flask and the dead or dying cells that include neurons are floating in the supernatant. At DIV 3, the attached cells start to divide to form astrocytic cell layer. In the absence of the supportive conditions, culture is almost devoid of any neuronal growth. At DIV 7, astrocyte layer is about 80 - 90% confluent and a few microglia as well as oligodendrocyte precursor cells are present on top of the astrocytic layer.\nAspirate the plating medium from the flask, add 2 mL of fresh prewarmed astrocyte plating medium, rinse and remove again at DIV 11, when astrocytes are confluent and ready for sub culturing.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin, gently rotate the flask a few times and aspirate trypsin using a sterile glass pipet.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin and let the flask sit in the tissue culture hood for 4 - 5 min at RT.\nRemove the trypsin and keep the flask at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 min. Add 5 mL prewarmed astrocyte plating medium and detach the astrocytic layer by tapping the flask against the palm of your hand (3 - 4 times) followed by gentle trituration to achieve complete detachment and collect the astrocytes in a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Centrifuge tube at 300 x g for 5 min, aspirate the supernatant, and add 1 mL fresh astrocyte plating medium.\nAdd 10 μL of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the cells in the large central gridded area (1 mm2) using an inverted phase contrast microscope (10X objective). Multiply by 104 to estimate the number of cells per mL. One T25 flask will yield ~1 x 106 total dissociated cells. Seed ~1 x 105 cells in 2 mL astrocyte plating medium on a 12 mm diameter Poly-D-Lysine precoated glass coverslip in the well of a 24-well culture dish.\nIncubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Perform OGD/REOX at DIV 12 - 14 (section 2).\nTreat the astrocyte cultures at DIV 3 with 5 mM L-leucine Methyl Ester (LME) hydrochloride until DIV 11 if hippocampal cultures devoid of microglia are desired. After LME incubation, subject cultures to shaking (300 rpm for 1 h) to remove contaminating microglia.\n\tNOTE: LME is a microglial cytotoxic agent that has been used extensively as a method to eliminate proliferating microglia22.\n2. OGD/REOX Treatment\nAspirate media from coverslip containing adherent astrocyte culture (DIV 12 - 14) and rinse 3 times by gently rotating the 24-well culture dish holding the coverslip a couple times with 1 mL isotonic OGD solution (pH 7.4) containing (in mM): 0 glucose, 21 NaHCO3, 120 NaCl, 5.36 KCl, 0.33 Na2HPO4, 0.44 KH2PO4, 1.27 CaCl2, and 0.81 MgSO4.\nAdd 0.2 mL OGD solution to well to cover the coverslip and incubate for 2 h in a hypoxic incubator containing 94% N2, 1% O2, and 5% CO2. Gently mix with an orbital shaker (50 rpm) for the first 30 min of hypoxia to facilitate gas exchange.",
    "Incubate normoxic control cells for 2 h in 5% CO2 and atmospheric air in a buffer identical to the OGD solution except for the addition of 5.5 mM glucose.\nFor REOX, aspirate OGD solution and add 2 mL of astrocyte plating medium. Incubate in 5% CO2 and atmospheric air at 37°C for 5 h.\n3. Immunocytochemical Staining\nAspirate the culture media using a sterile glass pipette attached to a vacuum line and quickly rinse coverslip once by adding 1mL of 0.1 M Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) (154 mM NaCl, 16 mM Trizma Base, 84 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) to the well. Aspirate and add 2 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Incubate for 15 min at RT.\nAspirate and add 1 mL of 0.1 M TBS, then place on a rocking shaker for 2 min. Repeat 3 times. Add 1 mL blocking solution (10% goat serum, 10 mg/mL BSA, 0.025% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M TBS) and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C on a rocking shaker.\nAspirate blocking solution and add primary mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (0.2 mL of a 1:500 dilution in blocking solution) and rabbit polyclonal anti-S100B (1:500) or rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF1α (1:200) for 60 min at 37 °C on a rocking shaker.\nAlternately, some astrocytes are incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-IBA1 (1:200) and mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2 to access culture purity.\nAspirate primary antibody and rinse coverslip by adding 1 mL of 0.1 M TBS and placing on a rocking shaker for 2 min and then aspirate. Repeat twice.\nAdd 0.2 mL of a 1:200 dilution of the secondary goat anti-rabbit 488-conjugated and anti-mouse 568-conjugated antibodies in blocking solution for 60 min at 37 °C on a rocking shaker.",
    "Aspirate secondary antibody and rinse coverslip by adding 1 mL of 0.1 M TBS and place on a rocking shaker for 2 min and then aspirate. Repeat twice.\nRemove coverslip from well and dry by placing on a slide positioned on a slide-drier. Mount coverslip on a new slide by inverting on a single drop of VECTASHIELD hardset mounting medium with DAPI (1.5 ng/μL).\nImage coverslips on a confocal microscope using either 20X dry or 60X oil objective. Acquire images (512 x 512) for DAPI (405 nm ex / 450 nm em) and fluorochrome 488 tagged GFAP antibody (488 nm ex / 515 nm em). Keep acquisition parameters constant within the 20X and 60X groups.\n4. Sex Determination Using PCR\nHeat pup toe or finger clippings at 95 °C for 45 min in 50 mM NaOH and neutralize with equal volume of 1 M Tris, pH 6.8.\nAdd 1 μL of the extracted DNA solution to 19 μL of the following mixture: 5 pmoles of primers for the Myog and Sry genes, 1x reaction buffer, 0.2 mM each deoxynucleotide and 8 U Taq polymerase.\nUse primers sequences; Sry 5'TCATGAGACTGCCAACCACAG3', 5'CATGACCACCACCACCACCAA3' and Myog 5'TTACGTCCATCGTGGACAGC3', 5'TGGGCTGGGTGTTAGTCTTA3'23.\nPerform the following PCR protocol: 95 °C for 3 min then 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 58 °C for 15 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. Following this 30 cycles, the reaction concludes with a final 72 °C elongation for 1 min.\nSeparate PCR products electrophoretically on an ethidium bromide-containing 2% agarose gel and visualize under UV illumination. (Figure 2A.) CAUTION! Ethidium bromide is a potential carcinogen and must be handled carefully and disposed of properly as per institution's regulations.\nSubscription Required.
