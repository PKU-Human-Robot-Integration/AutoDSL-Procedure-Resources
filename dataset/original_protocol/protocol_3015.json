Each mouse will be assigned to one specific\n      chamber and will be trained in that chamber for the entire experiment\n      period. To track and record locomotor activity in the open field arena, we\n      utilize the Activity Monitor 7 software (Med Associates), which is\n      connected to an infrared beam detector on the floor. The default\n      ambulatory detection is set to 7.62 cm of movement, while the default zone\n      detection encompasses the entire arena without sub-regions.\n    \n        Habituate the mice to the open field chamber and measure the baseline\n        activity (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\n        \n            Prepare the testing room.\n            \n                Before bringing the mice to the room, turn the room light to the\n                dimmest level (or use the red light).\n              \n                Ensure the room is quiet and thoroughly cleaned.\n                \nCritical: Exposure to\n                  bright room light has been demonstrated to induce anxiety-like\n                  behaviors in rodents, potentially affecting learning and\n                  memory.53[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib53],54[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib54] To mitigate the impact of\n                  environmental stimuli on neuronal activation and behavior, it\n                  is highly recommended to use dim or red light during entire\n                  experimental procedures.\n                \n            Use clean, new cages to transfer the mice from the housing room to\n            the testing room.\n          \n            Leave the mice undisturbed for at least 30 min before the behavioral\n            testing.\n            \nNote: Mice are placed with their\n              original cage mates in the new cages to reduce unnecessary stress.\n            \n            Load the protocol in the Activity Monitor 7 software.\n            \nNote: Default detection and zone\n              settings are adequate. Set the session time to 30 min. The\n              protocol will wait until the animal is detected in the box to\n              start the recording.",

    "Critical: On the third day of\n      fentanyl/saline injections (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, Day 5 of the\n      procedure), which is also the tagging day, it is crucial to avoid\n      introducing any salient events before or during testing (e.g., loud noise,\n      sudden light, etc.). This is because the tagging window lasts\n      approximately 6 hours and any events that trigger neuronal activity during\n      this period will be labeled.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nTagging of fentanyl-activated neurons in open field\nTiming: 1.5 h\nTiming: 1 h (for step 3)\n    \nTiming: 0.5 h (depends on the group\n      size) (for step 4)\n    \n      This step is to tag fentanyl (or saline)-activated neurons after the last\n      fentanyl (or saline) injection.\n    \n        Prepare 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2764-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. 4-OHT preparation\n              (A) Prepare the oil mix. In a 15-mL tube (1), add 2 mL castor oil\n              (2) and 8 mL sunflower oil (3). Mix thoroughly.\n            \n              (B) The pipette (1000 μL) that will be used to add oil mix to the\n              4-OHT needs to be trimmed for ∼1/8″ to better withdraw oil.\n            \n              (C) Setup the scale (1). A thin spatula (2) will be used to\n              transfer 4-OHT powder (3). We will make two 1.5-mL microcentrifuge\n              tubes (4) of 0.5 mL 4-OHT (10 mg/mL in 200-proof ethanol [5]).\n            \n              (D) Zero the scale for the 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.

Add 0.5 mL oil mix to each tube. Now each tube will\n              have 0.5 mL oil and 0.5 mL 4-OHT/ethanol.",
    "(H) The 4-OHT/ethanol solution and the oil mix will separate at\n              the beginning.\n            \n(I) Vortex the mixture.\n(J) The mixture may appear cloudy after vortexing.\n              (K) After sitting for a couple of seconds, the mixture will appear\n              clear.

Set the\n              temperature at 37°C and centrifuge for 45 min. If the volume is\n              greater than 0.5 mL after 45 min, re-centrifuge for 15 min.

We suggest preparing 4-OHT in the morning\n          of the tagging day.\n        \n            Make 1:4 mixture of castor oil: sunflower oil (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\n            \nNote: We suggest making 10 mL\n              mixture (2 mL castor oil with 8 mL sunflower oil) and store in the\n              vial wrapped with tin foil.\n            \nNote: This mixture can be stored\n              under the room temperature (20°C–25°C or /68–77°F) in a cool, dark\n              place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources for at least\n              3 months.\n            \nCaution: Wear appropriate PPE\n              and face mask accordingly to institutional guidelines when\n              handling 4-OHT.\n            \n            Weigh and dissolve 4-OHT powder in 200-proof ethanol to make a\n            10 mg/mL solution (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4E).\n            \nNote: We suggest using a 1.5 mL\n              microcentrifuge tube to make a small amount of 4-OHT each time.\n              The volume of ethanol should not exceed 0.5 mL for each tube since\n              we will add the same volume of oil mix in the next step.\n              Therefore, the maximum amount of 4-OHT for each tube will be 5 mg\n              (5 mg 4-OHT/0.5 mL ethanol = 10 mg/mL). Vortex until 4-OHT is",
    "fully dissolved (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F). This may take\n              several minutes.\n            \nNote: A heated water bath can be\n              used to facilitate the dissolving process.\n            \nCaution: 200-proof ethanol is\n              flammable and may cause irritation if inhaled, handle it with\n              caution.\n            \nNote: If the scale does not\n              support weighing amount less than 10 mg, we suggest making stock\n              solutions in 20 mg/mL in 200-proof ethanol then aliquot to the\n              desired working solution. Stock solution in 20 mg/mL can be stored\n              at −20°C for up to 3 weeks.\n            \nCritical: Ensure no visible\n              white 4-OHT solids are present in the ethanol. Double-check before\n              proceeding to the next step.\n            \n            In the same vial, add the oil mix to combine with the 4-OHT/ethanol\n            solution at 1:1 ratio.\n            \nNote: For 0.5 mL 4-OHT/ethanol, it\n              needs 0.5 mL of the oil mix (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]G and\n              4H).\n            \n            Vortex again to ensure 4-OHT/ethanol solution is fully mixed with\n            the oil (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I).\n            \nNote: The solution may appear\n              cloudy and then become clear (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J and\n              4K).\n            \nCritical: The next step will\n              evaporate the ethanol to “transfer” the 4-OHT from the ethanol to\n              the oil. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that the\n              4-OHT/ethanol is fully mixed with the oil. Otherwise, the 4-OHT\n              itself will not easily dissolve in the oil and the final\n              concentration will be lower than desired.\n            \n            Using the vacuum centrifuge, concentrate the 4-OHT/ethanol/oil\n            mixture. Set the temperature at 37°C and time for 45 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]L).\n            \nNote: If using the same centrifuge\n              and rotor as ours, the speed is around 40 g.\n            \nCritical: Check the volume\n              after 45 min. If the volume is greater than the volume of the oil\n              mix, the ethanol is not completely evaporated. Re-concentrate for\n              another 15 min. Repeat this step until all the ethanol is\n              evaporated (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]M).\n            \nNote: If a vacuum centrifuge is",
    "not readily available, an alternative method is to directly mix\n              4-OHT into the oil mixture by shaking it overnight at 37°C.52[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib52]\n              However, this process may result in undissolved particles even\n              after overnight shaking. Users should carefully consider the\n              timing between 4-OHT preparation and the tagging experiment.\n            \nNote: The final 4-OHT/oil mix\n              (10 mg/mL) can be stored under 4°C for a maximum of 12 h before\n              use.\n            \n        Tag fentanyl-activated neurons.\n        \nCritical: We will inject 4-OHT\n          when the mouse is under anesthesia. This is due to the fact that 4-OHT\n          injection is very painful, and this experience will activate pain- or\n          stress-related areas. By using anesthesia, we can minimize these\n          confounding factors, especially for the control group that will not\n          receive drug exposure. This approach will help ensure that our results\n          accurately reflect the effects of the drug on the experimental group,\n          while controlling for other variables that could affect neuronal\n          activation.\n        \n            Prepare a 1-mL regular syringe for 4-OHT/oil.\n            \nNote: The dose for 4-OHT is\n              50 mg/kg. Calculate the required volume based on the dose and the\n              body weight.\n            \n                Use a 18-gauge needle to withdraw the 4-OHT, then switch to a\n                26-gauge needle for injection.\n                \nNote: Each mouse should have\n                  its own syringe and needle.\n                \n                Place syringes next to the anesthesia chamber.\n                \nCritical: Do not use a\n                  1-mL insulin syringe in this step. Since the needle size is\n                  small and is fixed on the syringe, it will be difficult to\n                  withdraw the oil. Using needles with a size larger than\n                  20-gauge (e.g., 18G as we used) is optimal to withdraw\n                  4-OHT/oil mix.\n                \n            After the locomotor measurements are completed for the third\n            fentanyl-injection day, gently place the mice back in the cage.\n          \n            Immediately transfer the mice to the anesthesia chamber table.\n          \n            Turn on the oxygen flow and place the mice into the anesthesia",

Do not exert too much\n              pressure on the syringe plunger, otherwise the needle may be\n              pushed out by excessive pressure and harm the animal.\n            \n            Immediately place the mice back in the cage after injection.\n            \nCritical: Leave undisturbed\n              for the next 3 h before returning to the home cage.\n            \nNote: If the anesthesia chamber is\n              far away from the behavioral testing room, consider the timing of\n              transferring the animals to the anesthesia chamber.
