    "NOTE: Red-eared slider turtles, both male and female, were purchased from a vendor. Turtles were housed in a warm animal suite containing two 60-gallon tubs equipped with brick islands for sunning under 250-W infrared lights. The environment was maintained on a 14/10-h light/dark cycle with the water temperature at 22 °C. Lights were turned on at 6:00 am and turned off at 8:00 pm. The tanks equipped with filtering systems were cleaned weekly, and turtles were fed ad libitum every other day. The care of red-eared slider turtles and all of the following experimental procedures described here32,33 were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Lafayette College.\n1. Equipment Setup\nPrepare turtle Ringer's solution. Add the following to distilled water in this order: sodium chloride 96.5 mM (58.44 g/mol), potassium chloride 2.6 mM (74.56 g/mol), magnesium chloride 2.0 mM (203.31 g/mol), sodium bicarbonate 31.5 mM (84.01 g/mol), dextrose 20.0 mM (180.16 g/mol), concentrated hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH to 7.51, and calcium chloride 4.0 mM (110.98 g/mol) (see Table of Materials). Mix the solution while adding each salt.\n\tCAUTION: Concentrated HCl is hazardous (skin, eyes, inhalation, and ingestion hazards).\nMake tips for the suction electrodes from 5-cm-long capillary glass (see Table of Materials), by fire-polishing to different sizes of inner diameters in order to accommodate cranial nerves of varying thickness.\n\t\nUse a small file to etch a line across a piece of capillary glass. Place in tissue paper and break in half.\nSlowly roll one of the ends of the capillary glass into the flame of a Bunsen burner. Periodically examine the tip for size, smoothness, and symmetry using a dissection scope and a fiber optic light source (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: For turtles with head widths between 20 and 30 mm, optimal fitting inner diameter sizes typically range from 0.4 to 0.8 mm for the oculomotor nerve (nIII), 0.3 to 0.6 mm for the trochlear nerve (nIV), and 0.2 to 0.4 mm for the abducens nerve (nVI).\nClean and organize Rongeurs, a blunt dissection probe, microscissors, fine forceps, curved forceps, and a scalpel handle with blades (see Table of Materials) for the dissection.\n\tNOTE: Sterilization of instruments is optional.\n2. Anesthesia and Euthanasia\nPlace the turtle in an ice bucket for 60 min to cryoanesthetize it.\nEuthanize the turtle by decapitation using a small animal guillotine (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nGently pry the jaws of the animal open with a small weighing spatula so that a hook can be inserted and turned to fit under the tip of the upper jaw.\nPull with steady pressure to extend the animal's head through the guillotine. Swiftly decapitate the animal.\nPlace turtle head in a dissection dish. Have enough turtle Ringer’s solution on hand to irrigate the tissue. Oxygenize the solution with 95/5% O2/CO2 (see Table of Materials).\nMaintain the tissue at 4 °C by placing ice around the outside of the dish.\n3. Dissection\nUse the dissection scope with a fiber optic light source to carry out the dissection.\nRemove the lower jaw. Place a blunt dissection probe through the mouth to provide easier handling of the head. Cut the joint connecting the dentary bone to the cranium with a scalpel. Use rongeurs to pull the lower jaw away from the cranium. Use rongeurs to pull off the skin and muscles from their attachments at the dorsal and lateral regions of the cranium.\nRemove the vertebral column.",
    "Identify the vertebral column at the caudal end of the cranium. Bend the vertebral column ventrally to expose the spinal cord. Use microscissors to snip the spinal cord. Use rongeurs to remove the vertebral column and other tissue from the cranium by pulling caudally.\nRemove the brain from the cranium after cutting the cranial nerves.\n\t\nStarting at the foramen magnum, use rongeurs to cut two incisions on the dorsal cranium. Make cuts superficial to avoid damaging the brain beneath.\nUse rongeurs to carefully pull off the dorsal cranium. Use microscissors to remove the meninx to expose the rest of the brain. Remove enough meninx until the olfactory bulbs, in the anterior cranial cavity, can be identified (see Figure 1A). Continue to irrigate the brain with turtle Ringer's solution, as necessary.\nUse curved forceps to gently pull the cerebrum caudally and produce slight tension on the cranial nerves. Carefully cut away and remove the olfactory bulbs and cerebrum with curved forceps.\nUse microscissors to gently push the midbrain toward the midline to expose the cranial nerves; nIII, about 0.6 mm, can be seen in front of nIV, and the diameter of nIV will be slightly less than nIII. Cut nIII and nIV where they attach to the midbrain (see Figure 1B). Repeat this on the other side.\nCut the left and right optic nerve (nII) with microscissors. Then tilt the brainstem to one side. Observe nVI emerging from the ventral surface near the junction of the pons and the medulla (see Figure 1C); the diameter of nVI is small and approximately 0.3 mm. Cut both the left and right nVI.\nRemove the remaining parts of the brainstem from the turtle with fine forceps and microscissors. Once the cranium is empty, examine the cranial cavity floor. Identify nIII, nIV, and nVI.",
    "Remove the upper and lower eye-lids with fine forceps and microscissors.\n4. Calibration of Eye Movements\nUse a rigid table (see Table of Materials) to support the placement of the gimbal and other instruments. Place the turtle head into the gimbal chuck so that the dorsal surface of the head is parallel to the horizon using a small bubble-level resting across the skull. Roughly position one of the eyes at the center of the gimbal's horizontal and vertical rotations.\nPlace the infrared camera, fitted with an infrared light emitting diode (LED), which is part of the video-based eye tracking system (see Table of Materials), at a viewing distance of approximately 12 cm from the turtle's eye.\n\t\nAngle the camera 45 degrees above the line of sight of the eye. The LED should be at the 11 o’clock position when looking at the camera lens. Center the LED along the optical axis of the eye. The camera will be slightly off axis (as viewed from above the eye).\nAdjust the distance of the camera from the eye so that the camera view is maximally filled by the eyeball. Ensure that the corners of the eyes (canthi) are at the edges of the horizontal view.\nConnect the camera to the video-based eye tracking system to process the data. Split the signal to a DVD-recorder to capture the raw video. Focus the camera to obtain a clear image of the eye. Take care to fine-position the eye at the center of the camera view using the three degrees of linear adjustment (x, y, z) provided with the gimbal.\nDetect the dark pupil by setting the threshold and contrast appropriately using the program provided with the video-based eye tracking system.",
    "Using the mouse, click on the \"Video\" menu and under \"Mode\" select \"High Precision\" to capture images at a sampling rate of 30 Hz (resolution of 640 pixels x 480 lines). Also under \"Video\", select \"Dark Pupil\" for \"Pupil Type\" and \"Ellipse (rotated ellipse)\" for \"Pupil Segmentation Method\".\nIn the \"EyeCamera\" window, click on the \"Pupil Search Area Adjustment\" icon (small vertical rectangle with a dot in the center). Use the mouse to drag out a rectangle that limits an area around the pupil. Avoid dark areas that could be confused with the pupil.\nIn the \"Controls\" window, confirm that boxes for \"Auto Image\" and \"Positive-Lock Threshold-Tracking\" are checked. Click on \"Auto-Threshold\" to optimize the density of scanning, which will show as green dots over the dark pupil.\nCalibrate the video-display of the video-based eye tracking program to the rotations of the gimbal 12.5 ° (+/-) around its horizontal axis and 10 ° (+/-) around its vertical axis.\n\t\nIn the \"Controls\" window, click on \"Display\". Check the boxes under both \"Gaze\" and \"Stim\" for \"Gaze Point\", \"Calib Region\", and \"Geometry Grid\". After checking the boxes under \"Geometry Grid\", a window will pop up and say, \"The stimulus display geometry must be measured before the geometry grid can be displayed. Do you wish to do this now?\" Select \"Y\" for yes.\nUsing the mouse, click on the \"Windows\" menu and select \"Stimulus\". The \"Stimulus\" window will open showing a vertical and horizontal line crossing at the center of the display. Measure the lengths of the lines to the nearest mm. Press \"Esc\" on the keyboard to exit the \"Stimulus\" window.",
    "Using the mouse, click on the \"Stimulus\" menu and select \"Geometry Setup\". Input the lengths of the lines that were just measured. Adjust the viewing distance so that the degrees/line equal 25 ° for the horizontal line and 20 ° for the vertical line. Click on the \"Store\" button and close the window.\nIn the \"EyeSpace\" window, select the number of calibration \"Data Point\" to be \"9\". With the turtle's eye positioned at the center, click on the center data point and click the \"Re-present\" button.\n\t\tNOTE: The \"Stimulus\" window will open, and \"Get Ready\" will appear at the center of the screen. A box will appear at the center location and then disappear. On its disappearance, the \"Stimulus\" window will close. The center position should now be calibrated.\nRepeat the procedure by rotating the gimbal right/left, +12.5 °/-12.5 °, and up/down +10 °/-10 ° to calibrate the remaining data points.\nTo calibrate torsional rotation, use the template fitting algorithm provided with the video-based eye tracking program. The algorithm sets a zero position based on markings of the iris and computes an angle of rotation when the markings become offset from the centroid of the pupil.\n\t\nUsing the mouse pointer, click on the \"Windows\" menu and select \"Torsion\". Click the \"START\" button in the \"Torsion\" window. In the \"EyeCamera\" window, an arc will appear over the image of the eye.\nAdjust the radius, the angle, and the length of the arc using the sliders at a location where irregular markings are present in the iris. Check the boxes for \"Real-time graphics\" and \"Auto-Set after adjust\". If necessary, adjust the brightness and contrast in the Controls window and re-threshold the dark pupil (see step 4). Click the \"Set Template\" button.",
    "Place a ruler in the same focal plane as the pupil and record the width of the full camera view. The value will be used later to determine the actual width of the pupil.\n5. Positioning of Suction Electrode on Cranial Nerve to Evoke Eye Movements\nCarefully place a pin reference electrode into the connective or muscle tissue remaining on the head.\nPlace the suction electrode (see Table of Materials) on the cranial nerve using a micromanipulator and dissection scope mounted on a boom. Use a fiber optic light source to view and guide the placement.\n\t\nMatch the size of a nerve to a capillary glass tip. Trial and error is necessary to obtain a best fit around the diameter of a nerve (see step 1.2 for size recommendations). Place the glass tip onto the suction electrode. Fill the suction electrode with Ringer's solution and adjust the volume within the syringe to about half of its capacity.\nCarefully move the glass tip of the electrode using the micromanipulator to a position above the cut-end of the selected nerve. Ensure that Ringer's solution fills the cranium and the tip is below its surface. If necessary, use modeling clay to dam up locations where the Ringer's solution is leaking out of the cranium.\nPull back on the plunger of the syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: The vacuum will draw the nerve into the end of the capillary tip. A good fit is indicated by the nerve remaining within the tip with little or no additional vacuum applied.\n6. Stimulation of Cranial Nerve and Analysis of Eye Movements\nUse a general purpose nerve/muscle stimulator with a current isolation device (see Table of Materials) to stimulate the cranial nerve via the suction electrode.",
    "Connect the suction electrode to the current isolation device using a cable. Connect the lead from the pin reference electrode to the ground connection of the isolation device.\nSelect parameters of the currents using the dials and switches on the stimulator and isolation device. Use a range of currents from 1 to 100 µA, with frequency of 10 to 400 Hz. Use 1- or 2-ms pulses in trains lasting 100, 500, or 1,000 ms.\nRecord the timing of stimulations.\n\tNOTE: Transistor-transistor-logic (TTL) pulses are synchronized with the deliveries of the currents from the stimulator and communicate in real-time via a cable to input channels of the video-based eye tracking system. A software module provided with the video-based eye tracking program controls the communication.\n\t\nTo visualize the timing of the current applications and their influence on eye movements, click on the \"PenPlots\" menu. Select \"X Gaze Position\", \"Y Gaze Position\", \"Torsion\", and \"Pupil Width\" to show real time raw data plots for X and Y eye positions, torsion, and pupil width. Also select the \"Seconds & Markers\" from the \"PenPlots\" menu to show a timing plot with tick marks, which appear at 1 s intervals.\n\t\tNOTE: A capital letter \"T\" will appear marking the onset of the TTL pulse, occurring simultaneously with the current application.\nTo store the data of eye movements evoked by currents, click on the \"File\" menu and select \"New Data File\" under \"Data\". Input a file name and press \"Enter\". Saving data can be paused and then restarted using the combination of key commands, \"Ctrl\" + \"p\". When an experimental session is completed, select \"Close Data File\" off \"File\" menu under \"Data\".",
    "To help keep track of the type of currents applied, click on the \"Windows\" menu and select \"Data Pad\". The \"KeyPad/DataMarker\" window will appear. Click on a letter or a number to identify parameters of the current stimulations being delivered to the nerve.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, \"X\" could stand for 10 µA. Clicking on \"X\" stores its entry into the data file in real time for post hoc analysis. It also appears on the \"PenPlot\" for \"Seconds & Markers\" for ongoing observation.\nAnalyze data from the eye tracker system.\n\t\nOpen the saved data file, which is in a text delimited format, into a spread sheet program of choice to organize the data and carry out statistical analysis.\n\t\t\nConvert the pupil width values stored in the file to real sizes in mm.\nConvert the values of X and Y eye positions and torsions to units of degree and use conventions for describing eye movements; therefore, positive directions of rotations: intorsion, elevation, and adduction; and negative directions of rotations: extorsion, depression, and abduction.\nCopy the header information onto a new worksheet. This will include values for the screen size (width and height) and the viewing distance. Eight columns of data collected at a rate of 30 Hz will follow below the header information.\nGo back to the worksheet containing the raw data. Do a \"Find\" for \"X\" in the last column titled \"Marker\" to locate where stimulation was applied with 10 µA. Find incidence of \"T\", marking the beginning of the current stimulation. Copy 15 rows (0.5 s) of data occurring before \"T\" and 90 frames after \"T\" (3.0 s); i.e., 3.5 s total. Paste the data in the new worksheet below the header information.\nInsert a blank column after \"PupilWidth\". In the blank column, convert to the calibrated dimension in mm:",
    "Horizontal pupil diameter = \"PupilWidth\" × the dimension of camera view width\nInsert 2 blank columns after both \"X_Gaze\" and \"Y_Gaze\". Normalize positions to the dimensions of the viewing screen: coordinates (0, 0) at the top left of the screen extending to (1, 1) at the bottom right. In the first blank column, translate positions to a coordinate system having (0, 0) at the center of the screen. Include the conversion to the dimensions of the screen in mm:\nX = (0.5 × width)  – (\"X_Gaze\" × width); Y = (0.5 × height) – (\"Y_Gaze\" × height)\n\t\tNOTE: The sequence of operation is for the left eye. The sequence will need to be reversed for the right eye in order to follow convention of negativity for abduction and positivity for adduction.\nIn the second columns, use trigonometry functions to convert to angles (°) of rotation:\n\t\thorizontal rotation = arctan (X/viewing distance);vertical rotation = arctan (Y/viewing distance)\nTorsion is already shown in units of degrees, but to conform to convention of positivity for intorsion, if measuring is done on the left eye, multiply by -1. For the right eye, no multiplication is necessary. The program codes clockwise rotation as positive.\nPlot the pupil diameter and rotations as a function of time.\nSubscription Required.
