    "1. SU-8 Master Fabrication\nPrepare both master molds for the channels (fluidic and control, for schematics and dimensions see Figure 2) with the following protocol but with different mask patterns. The process is shown in Figure 3a.\nStart by heating a 4 inch silicon wafer for 10 min at 180 °C. Load the dehydrated wafer on a spin-coater and use the following protocol for spin-coating SU-8 2015:\n\t\nSpin wafer at 100 rpm for 20 sec (open lid of spin-coater, dispense SU-8 during this step, close lid after dispensing).\nSpin wafer at 500 rpm for 10 sec (this will spread the resist over the whole wafer).\nSpin wafer at 1,750 rpm for 30 sec (defines the height of the resist to 20 µm).\nRemove resist from the edge of the wafer with acetone (use a swab) as this will otherwise stick to the hotplate in the next step. Transfer the wafer to a hotplate at 95 °C and heat for 4 min. After the softbake, expose the resist through a photomask taped to sodalime glass in a mask aligner with UV light (150 mJ/cm2, measured at 365 nm).\nAfter the exposure, heat the wafer again at 95 °C for 5 min on a hotplate. Cool down the wafer to RT and then immerse it into a bath of SU-8 developer for 4 min. Shake gently to remove unexposed SU-8. Wash the wafer with clean-room grade isopropanol and blow dry with nitrogen. Check under a microscope if the development was successful (especially the cell traps). If the cell traps are completely developed, the reflection of the silicon wafer should be visible. If necessary, develop the wafer again for a few minutes.",
    "Bake the wafer in an oven for 2 hr at 180 °C to remove all residual solvent. Check the height of the channels with a step profiler. If the height differs from the desired height, repeat this protocol starting at step 1.1 with a new wafer and change the spin-speed (step 1.1.3). Finalize the fabrication of the master mold by silanizing the wafer with 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyl-dimethylchloro-silane in a desiccator overnight.\n2. Master Fabrication for Microcontact Printing\nIn order to prepare master molds for microcontact printing, dehydrate a silicon wafer for 10 min at 180 °C. Spin-coat 1 ml HDMS onto this wafer at 7,500 rpm for 30 sec (the resist adheres better to a silanized surface). Spin-coat 2 ml of AZ1518 positive resist with this protocol:\n\t\nStatic dispense of the resist on to the wafer.\nSpin wafer for 5 sec at 500 rpm.\nSpin wafer for 60 sec at 4000 rpm.\nAfter a 50 sec softbake at 100 °C on a hotplate, expose the resist to UV-light (21 mJ/cm2 at 365 nm) through a photomask and on a mask aligner. Develop the resist in a bath of AZ 726 for 75 sec. Rinse the developed wafer with DI-water and blow dry with nitrogen. Remove residual solvent by heating the wafer at 115 °C for 50 sec. Silanize the wafer under vacuum overnight.\n3. Fabrication of the Microfluidic Chip\nA two-layer device design is used for these experiments. The two layers are prepared separately and are bonded together, before the chip is finally bonded onto a glass slide (Figure 3b). This step describes the production of the PDMS layers and the PDMS stamp for microcontact printing.",
    "Prepare a 10:1 mixture of PDMS and curing agent. Prepare approximately 80 g PDMS in total (using our designs, this will result in 10 chips). Mix both parts vigorously and degas the PDMS until the mixture is bubble free (~30 min).\nPlace the wafer with the control layer inside a Petri dish and tape it onto the bottom. Next, pour  ~50 g of PDMS on top and put the wafer for at least 2 hr in an oven at 80 °C to assure complete curing of the PDMS. Repeat the same procedure for the microcontact printing wafer, for this ~20 g PDMS is needed.\nSpin-coat PDMS on the wafer with the fluidic layer at a rotational speed of 2,000 rpm to form an approximately 40 µm high PDMS layer. Cure the PDMS in an oven for at least 1 hr at 80 °C.\nWhen both parts are cured, remove the control layer from the wafer and cut into pieces with a razor blade. Punch pressure connection holes by using a 1 mm biopsy puncher. For storage, it is advisable to put a piece of tape over the channels.\nTo bond the two layers, take the spin-coated wafer and the top part and place them in a plasma cleaner23. After plasma treatment, quickly align both parts under a microscope with large working distance. Add some spare PDMS around the placed top parts. This step is not mandatory, however it facilitates the removal of the PDMS from the wafer. Place the wafer in an oven at 80 °C for at least 1 hr.\nUse a scalpel to carefully remove the PDMS from the wafer and to cut the microchips. Punch access holes for the fluidic connections with a 1.5 mm biopsy puncher.",
    "The PDMS chip is now finished and can be stored for months. Optional: If the chip is used with a reservoir, cut the upper part of a 200 µl pipette tip and use some spare, semi-cured PDMS to glue it on top. Put the chip in the oven again at 80 °C for at least 1 hr.\n4. Bonding to Glass Slide\nTo use the device for direct enzymatic assays, the only step required after bonding is the blocking of surfaces. For this protocol, proceed to A. However, to use the microfluidic chip for immunoassays or ELISAs, please refer to protocol B to restrict the binding sites only to the glass slide (i.e. for TIRF microscopy or SPR). If this restriction is not important, refer to A, but use biotinylated conjugates in step 4.3 and continue with step 4.8 in protocol B to create a fully functional surface.\nPrior to performing protocol A and B: It is advisable to filter all of the used protein solutions prior to introducing them into the chip. Debris and protein aggregates may otherwise block cell traps, thereby reducing the number of chambers that can be used for analysis. For this purpose, use a nonprotein adsorbing filter unit to filter all solutions before introducing them into the channels.\nProtocol A (enzymatic assays)\nTo finalize the microfluidic device, bond the PDMS parts onto a glass slide. To do this, first clean a glass slide with soap, distilled water and ethanol. Dry the slide using a nitrogen stream. Clean the PDMS part with scotch tape.\nPut the PDMS part and the cleaned glass slide into the plasma cleaner for 45 sec at 18 W. To assure a tight bonding, put the chip on a hot plate (100 °C) for 5 min.",
    "After bonding, fill the chip with fluids. An easy way to achieve this is to use centrifugal force. Cut the lower part of 200 µl pipette tip. For the fluidic channels, fill them with the blocking solution (bovine serum albumin (4% w/v) or poly-L-lysine) grafted polyethylene glycol (0.05% w/v) and place the tips into the inlets. Fill the control layer inlets with either water or with an isosmotic solution, e.g. PBS. Place the chip into the centrifuge (800 x g) for 5 min. The channels should be now filled with fluid completely. If not, repeat this step.\nIncubate the blocking solution for at least 30 min at room temperature. Wash the solution out of the fluid layer with PBS at a flow rate of 10 µl/min using a syringe pump. The device is now ready for cell experiments.\nProtocol B (immunoassays)\nFor a complete overview of the surface modification from step 4.7 onwards, please refer to Table 1.\nIncubate PDMS stamps for microcontact printing with a bBSA/BSA solution (e.g. 1-100). After 30 min, clean the stamps thoroughly with distilled water and dry the stamp under a stream of nitrogen. Quickly place the stamps on a cleaned glass slide (Figure 4).\nExpose the glass slide with the stamp together with the top part of the microfluidic chip to oxygen plasma for 45 sec at maximum power (18 W) in a plasma cleaner. After plasma treatment, remove the stamp and align the printed surface underneath the microchambers of the device. Place the chip for 30 min on a hot plate at 50 °C.",
    "To block the remaining surface, introduce sterile-filtered BSA solution (4% (w/v) in PBS) into the chip with a centrifuge (see step 4.2). Incubate for 1 hr and wash the solution out of the fluid layer with PBS (see step 4.3). The chip can then be used directly or stored for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C in a humid box.\nFor a fully functional binding surface, introduce avidin (0.025% (w/v) in PBS) into the reservoir. Use a flow rate of 5 µl/min for 30 min to withdraw the avidin solution through the fluid channels. Afterwards, flush PBS for 10 min. Rinse the reservoir thoroughly.\nAfterwards, add Protein G (0.0025% (w/v) in PBS) and flush for another 30 min. Wash with PBS for another 10 min afterwards. Next, add the antibody of interest (0.0001% (w/v) in PBS) for 10 min. After 10 min, stop the flow for 15 min to allow binding. Next, wash with PBS for 10 min.\n5. Cell Experiments",
    "The protocol is written in general terms because of the variety of possible assays. As an example the reagents needed for the G6PDH toxicity assay are given. The initial cell trapping efficiency of the device is around 2.5%, i.e. 5 out of 200 cells will be trapped. The final occupancy of the cell traps strongly depends on the used cell line, the protocol to suspend the cell line and the time the cells are flushed through the channel. For cells naturally growing in suspension (such as U937), single cells can be found in about 75% of the chambers after a few minutes. The other chambers are either not filled, or occupied by two or more cells. In general, the single-cell occupancy is smaller for adherent cell lines. When using the rather mild suspending protocol presented here, the percentage decreases to about 30% (HEK, MLT cells). The single-cell occupancy can be improved by trypsin treatment of the cells, but this may also alter the results of the experiments.\nDepending on the target molecule, adsorption or absorption to PDMS can influence the results. Adsorption can be reduced by blocking the surfaces with BSA or PLL-g-PEG. Absorption is unlikely for most hydrophilic biomolecules, but it should be checked for (small) lipophilic cell components.\nPrepare the cells according to the specific protocol (e.g. drug addition). For suspension cells, add cells directly to the chip. For adhesive cell lines, use enzyme-free dissociation buffer to produce a cell suspension. Filter the cells before introducing them to the chip to reduce the amount of cell clusters.",
    "Load the cells onto the chip using a syringe pump and forward flow, rather than to withdraw the cell suspension. Use a flow rate of 5 µl/min for suspension cell lines and higher flow rates of 10-20 µl/min for adhesive cells since to reduce nonspecific attachment of the cells onto the channel walls.\nWhen the traps are filled, close the chambers. If many cells adhere nonspecifically to the surface, try to wash them away with cell dissociation buffer at a flow rate of 10-30 µl/min.\nProtocol A (enzymatic assays)\nWithdraw lysis buffer through the chip. For this example, this buffer is a hypoosmolar buffer with added Tween 20 (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Tween 20). For lysis, quickly open and close chambers (i.e. 500 msec for flow rates of 10-50 µl/min 7,21). For the G6PDH assay, add 2 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 0.5 mM NADP, 0.5 U/ml diaphorase and 0.3 mM resazurin to the lysis buffer. Start monitoring the kinetic reaction immediately after lysis.\nNote: Choose any buffer which is suitable for the assay, however bare in mind that strong detergents (like Triton, SDS) lyse cells immediately and will lead to a loss of analyte during chamber opening.\nProtocol B (immunoassays)\nFor a short description of the ELISA cell experiments (flow rates, chamber status, etc.), please refer to Table 1.\nFor ELISA, add the required detection reagent (e.g. secondary antibody, labeled antigen) directly to the lysis buffer. The herein added Tween 20 reduces the nonspecific adsorption. Lyse the cells according to step 5.4. Incubate the mixture for 10-15 minutes to allow binding (incubation time depending on the used antigen and antibody).",
    "Antibody enzyme conjugates that adsorbed nonspecifically to the channel walls can lead to a conversion of the detection reagent already inside the reservoir and channels. To reduce issues from this adsorption, flush a permanent inhibitor of the used detection enzyme through the chip during the incubation time (chambers closed, before adding the detection reagent). For HRP, use 20 mM HCl in water to permanently inactivate the nonspecifically adsorbed enzymes.\nAfter incubation time, introduce the detection reagent (e.g. Amplex Red and hydrogen peroxide for HRP) to the chip. Open the chambers shortly again to wash the nonbound secondary antibody away and to add the detection reagent. Start monitoring the kinetic reaction immediately.\nCalibration: Immobilize the antibody against the target of interest. Close chambers. Prepare different concentrations of analyte in buffer or in cell lysate off-chip. Apply a concentration to the chip and quickly exchange the volume inside the chambers (500 msec opening time). This opening time is sufficiently short to ensure that no additional accumulation occurs from analyte flushing, and only a specific number of molecules from the volume of the microchamber are detected. From the known concentration of the antigen inside the solution and the volume of the chamber (625 pl), calculate the amount inside the chamber. Afterwards, continue with step 5.5 and introduce the detection moiety.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
