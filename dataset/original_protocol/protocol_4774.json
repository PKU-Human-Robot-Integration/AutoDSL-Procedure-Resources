    "DNA extraction and polymerase chain reactionTotal DNA was extracted using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Doyle, 1991). Ten pairs of SSR markers were developed by Duan and Zhang (2014) (AC30, CT12, CT59, CT113, CT17, CT60, CT48, CT135, CT142, CT91) from M. pubescens were selected for testing the gene flow between M. pubescens var. alba and M. kwangtungensis. The forward of each primer pair was labeled with fluorochrome (FAM, HEX, ROX, TAMRA). The information of the primers is shown in Table 1.Table 1. Characteristics of the 10 pairs of SSR primers employed in this study. Presented for each locus are the forward (F) and reverse (R) primer sequences, repeat motif, size of the original fragment (bp), annealing temperature (Ta), and GenBank accession number.

The amplified SSR fragment data were collected using GeneMarker version 2.4.0 software.Data analysisThe software FSTAT 2.9.3 (Goudet, 2001) and GenAlEx 6.2 (Peakall and Smouse, 2006) were used for calculating the alleles and private alleles, respectively. We used the program STRUCTURE 2.2 (Pritchard et al., 2000; Falush et al.",
    ", 2003 and 2007) for population genetic structure analysis and hybrid detection. This method implements a Bayesian model-based clustering approach. We supposed all the loci were independent, following the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium. The program was run 10 times for each K-value, ranging 1-5, with 100,000 replicates for burn-in and 40,000 iterations. Out of the five runs for k = 2, the run with the highest likelihood value was selected to assign the posterior membership coefficients (Evanno et al., 2005).The entire data set is arranged as a matrix in a single file, in which the data for individuals are in rows, and the loci are in columns. For a diploid organism, data for each individual can be stored either as 2 consecutive rows, where each locus is in one column, or in one row, where each locus is in two consecutive columns. Missing data should be indicated by a number that doesn’t occur elsewhere in the data.The software NewHybrids version 1.1 beta (Anderson and Thompson, 2002) was used to identify hybrids in the individuals sampled. The program calculates the posterior probability that fall into each of the six genotype categories, Parent 1, Parent 2, F1 hybrids, F2 hybrids, back-cross generation to Parent 1, and back-cross generation to Parent 2.For FSTAT, GenAlex and NewHybrids, we used the default value in each software. For STRUCTURE, we chose admixture model, and set the parameters as we mentioned in the original article (Luo et al., 2015), other parameters we used the default values."
