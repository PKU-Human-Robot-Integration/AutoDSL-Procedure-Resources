    "Preparation of cells for viral titrationOn the day prior to the neutralization experiment, 12 well plates should be set up with U2OS cells seeded at 2.5 x 105 cells/well. The U2OS cell line is a human osteosarcoma line that is highly infectable with Vaccinia virus and forms a very consistent monolayer, making it ideal for Vaccinia virus plaque assays. U2OS cells are cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and should also be set up in the 12 well plates in the same media. The number of plates should correspond to the number of samples in which virus neutralization is to be assessed and account for duplicate or triplicate titrations. Collection of bloodClean the top of the vacutainer collection tube with an alcohol wipe. Venous blood should be collected by a trained phlebotomist into the vacutainer tube using a butterfly needle with connected vacutainer holder.Immediately after blood collection, using the insulin syringe, inject Refludan (70 μl of a 100x stock of Refludan to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml) through the rubber top of the tube. Invert several times (4-5 times) at room temperature to ensure proper mixing.Neutralization assayPrepare a 250 μl aliquot of whole blood per blood donor in an Eppendorf tube.Transfer remaining blood to a 15 ml falcon tube and spin at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain plasma. Collect the plasma and prepare two 250 μl aliquots of plasma in Eppendorf tubes per blood donor. Heat inactivates one plasma sample (30 min at 56 °C) per blood donor to inactivate complement using either a heat block or a water bath. As a control to verify the amount of input virus under non-neutralizing conditions, prepare an additional tube with 250 μl of serum free media or PBS.",
    "Add 10 μl of prepared virus dilution (5 x 106 pfu/ml) to each sample and vortex very gently (final concentration is 2 x 105 pfu/ml). The total volume of each sample should be 260 μl.Incubate samples at 37 °C for one hour.Titration of infectious virusimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151204/20151204021427_2222.jpgFigure 1. Titration procedure schematicPrepare 6 Eppendorf tubes with 900 μl of SFM per sample.Add 100 μl of sample to 900 μl of SFM. Make 1/10 serial dilutions with the remaining five tubes. (Dilution series will be 10-1 to 10-6.)Transfer 250 μl of diluted sample into the wells of the 12 well plate.Incubate for one hour at 37 °C. Every 15-20 min, plates should be rocked to ensure that no part of the well dries out during the minimal volume infection. Completely remove the inoculum by aspiration and add 1 ml of prepared titration overlay media per well.Two days after the virus neutralization experiment, visualize the plaque assay using a 0.1% crystal violet solution. Remove overlay by aspiration and wash wells with 1x PBS. Add 0.25 ml of 0.1% crystal violet solution to wells and incubate at room temperature for 5-10 min. Remove crystal violet and collect in a container for appropriate disposal. Wash the wells with tap water and dispose of this waste with crystal violet waste. Allow wells to air dry.Plaques are visible by the naked eye. Enumerate the number of plaques per well and multiply by the dilution factor. Data can be represented as Titer (pfu/ml) or as relative recovery to the control sample. Relative recovery can be calculated by dividing the titer of the test sample by the titer of the control non-neutralized sample (where virus was spiked into PBS or DMEM)."
