    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnesthetizing the mouse\nTiming: 10–30 min\nBefore performing the palate wound it is essential to ensure the mouse is fully anesthetized. The hard palate is well innervated and can cause the mouse pain if anesthesia is not adequate. The following intraperitoneal injection regimen will produce a surgical level of anesthesia for 15–30 min and sedation for 1–2 h.\nPrepare the anesthetic syringe.\nTake a new sterile 1cc syringe, slowly draw in approximately 200–250 μL of anesthetic solution into the syringe trying not to draw in any excess air.\nPoint the syringe upward to bring any air bubbles to the top of the needle.\nPlunge the syringe gently to expel any air until no air can be seen in the syringe chamber and only liquid expels from the syringe, and double check volume.\nSet syringe on a clean surface and do not let the needle touch anything.\nAdminister the anesthetic.\nCarefully remove the lid of the cage housing the mice.\nGrasp the tail of a mouse with your thumb and index finger to restrain it.\nPlace the mouse on a surface such as the metal cage bars and pull back gently to allow them to grip the bars.\nWith your free hand, use your thumb and index finger to scruff the mouse on the dorsal surface of the neck/shoulder area, grabbing and pulling back a large amount of skin until their head is properly restrained to prevent movement.\nThen, lift the mouse and turn it over, keeping the mouse restrained against the palm of your hand.\nUse your pinky finger from your hand, scruffing the mouse and placing it against the tail of the mouse so that it is against the pinky and your palm.",
    "The mouse should be fully restrained, unable to freely move the head.\nWhile restraining the mouse, grab the syringe with your free hand so that you can clearly see and read the numbers on the syringe.\nInsert the needle into the lower right quadrant of the abdomen at an angle that allows it to penetrate the skin, approximately 15–30 degrees from the surface.\nInject the anesthetic slowly, and then withdraw the needle.\nPlace the mouse into the anesthetization cage and wait.\nWhen the heartrate has visibly slowed and the mouse has stopped moving, place the mouse on the heating pad.\nPerform a toe pinch to test the anesthetic depth.\nIf the mouse does not respond to the toe pinch, you can proceed to the next step. If the mouse reflex occurs, wait a few minutes and try again.\nCritical: Do not begin the mouse surgery until the mouse is properly anesthetized and does not respond to the toe pinch test.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent corneal drying.\nCritical: It is important to make sure they ophthalmic ointment is applied to prevent any dryness that may otherwise occur during the surgical procedure.\nPalate wound placement\nTiming: 10–20 min\nThis step will successfully place a circular 1 mm diameter excisional wound on the palate of the mouse. If done properly, there will be minimal bleeding and the entire epithelium will be removed.\nPlacement of an oral spacer.\nCarefully place a pair of closed forceps between the upper and lower incisors, and release to open (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2039-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(D) A properly placed oral spacer.\n(E) 1 mm biopsy punch placement, with thumb and index finger of other hand supporting mouse head.\n(F) A properly placed 1 mm wound along the medial line and below first rugae.\n(G) Use forceps to physically remove excised tissue.\n(H) Appearance of palate after wound tissue is removed.\n(I) Use of cotton tipped applicator to apply pressure to the wound to achieve hemostasis.\nWith your other hand, use a pair of forceps to grab an oral spacer.\nPush the spacer between forceps holding the mouth open. Brace spacer against one side of the buccal pouch to wedge into place (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nUse forceps to adjust the spacer placement (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nThe palate should be clearly visible if spacer is placed appropriately (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nPlacement of the palate wound.\nRemove a new sterile 1 mm biopsy punch from its bag and place in the hand you are most comfortable using to place the wound.\nWith your other hand, use your thumb and index finger to support the nasal bridge of the mouse (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nPlace the biopsy punch below the first rugae and center it medially on the palate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nEnsuring contact of the punch against the palate, rotate the punch in a circular motion to make the excision until you feel friction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nRemove the punch and inspect the wound, being sure to remove any excess blood with a cotton tipped applicator or gauze (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nUse forceps to grab the outer edge of the tissue and remove (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nInspect the wound and forceps to ensure removal of tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nHold pressure against the wound with a cotton tipped applicator until hemostasis has been achieved (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).",
    "Place the mouse in the recovery cage directly under a warming lamp and monitor until the mouse has recovered from anesthesia.\nCheck for any signs of bleeding, then return the mouse to its original cage.\nIf the experimental duration before subsequent wound collection is greater than 24 h, observe the mice on a daily basis to ensure no unusual behavior, paying special attention to eating and drinking behavior.\nHarvesting wound tissue for analysis\nTiming: 20–30 min\nThis step will lead to the removal of the palate and underlying bone tissue at the time point of interest followed by an overnight fixation using paraformaldehyde. An optional step is included for those who wish to use the tissue for genomic analyses. For our studies, we routinely collected samples at six hours, one day, three days, and seven days after the initial wound placement. It takes approximately five to seven days for re-epithelialization to occur, and by day seven a majority of the tissue is replaced.\nEuthanize the mouse.\nEuthanize the mouse through the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation followed by cervical dislocation or according to the protocol approved by your institution.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position, and use curved scissors to make two cuts, one along each side of the buccal tissues (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2039-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Palate removal\n(A) Curved scissor placement to separate upper and lower mandible.\n(B) Initial incision inferior to palate with dissector scissors.\n(C) Lateral incision parallel and lateral to teeth.\n(D) Final incision using dissector scissors as this cuts through the incisors.\n(E) Removal of palate using forceps.\n(F) Fully removed palate after 1× PBS rinse.\nRetract the upper and lower mandibles using two pairs of forceps, taking care not to damage the wound area.",
    "Optional: If the samples are going to be used for genomic analyses, a 2 mm punch biopsy and a pair of forceps can be used to collect the soft tissue at the wound site. For RNA, it is recommended to place these samples immediately into 400 μL of RNAlater in a 1.5 mL nuclease free Eppendorf tube and placed at 4°C for 24 h, then processed or frozen at −20°C or −80°C. For DNA, samples can be snap frozen in a 1.5 mL nuclease free Eppendorf tube using dry ice. Then proceed to isolate the respective nucleic acid based on user preferences. For immunohistochemical studies, continue to the next step.\nFor histologic analysis, remove the palate with underlying bone and soft tissue intact.\nWhile holding the mouse in place with forceps in one hand, use dissector scissors to make a horizontal incision inferior to the palate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nThen with either dissector scissors or short fine blade straight scissors (user preference), cut along the outer edge of the each side of the palate, lateral from the molar teeth (with respect to the midline). Again, forceps are helpful to keep the mouse positioned properly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nUsing forceps in one hand and dissector scissors in the other, carefully cut along the anterior most region of the palate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNow the palate should be freed from the surrounding structures. Use forceps to remove the palate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). If you experience any resistance, use scissors to cut palate from any remaining structures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nCritical: Be careful to not damage the wound tissue when cutting the anterior region of the palate. This area cuts through the incisors and requires a significant amount of force.",
    "Rinse the palate briefly in 1× PBS, dry with gauze, place in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution in a glass scintillation vial under a fume hood, and keep at room temperature for 24 h.\nBone decalcification\nTiming: 30 days\nThis step will produce a decalcified tissue structure that is suitable for downstream immunohistochemistry procedures such as paraffin embedding and tissue sectioning. This process is necessary as the underlying palatal bone is removed with the tissue to maintain tissue integrity of the wound site. In order to section the tissue samples, bone must be completely decalcified before beginning the embedding process.\nDecalcify the bone.\nAfter the palate sample has been in 4% paraformaldehyde under a fume hood for 24 h, remove the tissue using forceps and wash in 1× PBS for one minute.\nThen, place the tissue in a glass scintillation vial containing the EDTA decalcification solution, cap the vial, and leave at room temperature for 5–7 days.\nEvery 5–7 days, move the palate sample to a new glass scintillation vial containing fresh (unused) EDTA decalcification solution.\nUse forceps to monitor the strength of calcified structures (such as the teeth) each week.\nCritical: If the calcified structures are not pliable upon manipulation with metal forceps, the tissue sample needs to remain in the EDTA decalcification solution. Failure to do so will lead to inability to acquire tissue sections using the microtome.\nThe tissue is ready for histologic processing (e.g., paraffin embedding) when the bone is pliable when grabbed with forceps or can be cut with a blade. This takes approximately 30 days."
