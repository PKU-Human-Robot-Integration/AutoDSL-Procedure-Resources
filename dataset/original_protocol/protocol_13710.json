    "All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol # 2020-0035) at the Case Western Reserve University. All animals were treated in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n1. Animals\nCommercially obtain pregnant Sprague Dawley rats.\nMaintain animals at an approved veterinary facility with 14 h/10 h light-dark cycle and 45-60% relative humidity.\n2. Preparation of test compound\nUse Evans blue dye as the test compound to assess the efficacy of the intratracheal instillation procedure.\nPrepare a 0.25% (w/v) solution of the dye in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and filter sterilize using a 0.45 µm syringe filter.\n3. Administration of anesthesia\nAnesthetize rat pups using gas anesthesia (3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen), using a modified delivery system adapted for small rat neonates.\nCheck for the loss of tail and pedal reflexes and shallow breathing to ensure the proper depth of anesthesia for carrying out the procedure.\n4. Intratracheal instillation (ITI)\nUse rat pups at post-natal day 5 (PN 5) for the ITI. Average weight of a PN 5 rat pup is 12 grams.\nRestrain the anesthetized rat pup on an inclined flat platform using laboratory labelling tape. The pup is restrained at an angle of about 45° in the supine position.\nOpen the mouth of the neonate, and gently pull the tongue out to one side using a blunt forceps.\nUse a small otoscope speculum of 2 mm diameter connected to the otoscope to hold the tongue gently and for proper visualization of the larynx.\nUse the throat illuminator system i.e., the operating otoscope, and the magnifying lens for proper visualization of vocal cords (Figure 1).\nPosition the animals at an angle of 45° in an inclined plane. The wired bar lids of mouse cages are used (Figure 2).",
    "NOTE: Positioning the animal at an angle of 45° provides better visualization of tracheal opening without the interference of the epiglottis.\nTake a long-angled pipette tip which is used for loading western blot gels. Cut the base of the pipette tip using a surgical blade so that it fits well into the tip of 1 cc syringe.\nUse the sterile 1 mL syringe fitted into a long-angled pipette tip to deliver 30-50 µL of the substance into the lung. Invert the syringe and aspirate nearly 0.9 cc air into the 1 mL syringe connected to the pipette tip followed by the dye or the substance to be delivered. This allows the air behind the dye to be pushed into the trachea after the dye is administered as shown in Figure 3. The intratracheal administration is achieved by visualizing the laryngeal lumen (vocal cords) and inserting the pipette tip fitted to a syringe into the tracheal lumen.\nUse the speculum of the otoscope to hold the tongue and expose the vocal cords. Speculum serves the role of the blade of a laryngoscope. Bend the pipette tip to an angle of 30° to facilitate easy introduction of the agent through the cone-shaped speculum into the tracheal opening.\nIntroduce the pipette tip into the tracheal opening to the point of about 2 mm beyond the vocal cords. Push the piston of the syringe to administer the dye or the drug through the speculum of the operating otoscope as shown in Figure 3. The introduction of air into the lung soon after the administration of the agent prevents the substance from coming back to the laryngeal cavity.",
    "After administering the pup with the dye or normal saline, place the pups on an integrated circulating fluid heating pad (38°C) until their respiratory movements are regular. After complete recovery from anesthesia, reunite the pups with the dam.\n5. Characterization of ITI delivery\nAfter ITI, euthanize the rat pups by giving excessive anesthesia (Ketamine 100 mg/kg and Xylazine 10 mg/kg) / thiopentone followed by exsanguination at an appropriate time post-administration. Euthanasia was performed as part of the experiment to collect lung tissue to demonstrate the efficacy.\nSecure the euthanized rat pup on a dissection board and wipe the chest and abdomen with 70% ethyl alcohol.\nFor evaluating the distribution of the dye throughout the lung, remove the lungs from the animal using sterile technique and display the lungs as appropriate for imaging (Figure 4A,B).\nSubscription Required.
