    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nfMRS experiment: Consent forms, instructions and preparations for fMRS measurement (Day 1)\nTiming: 45 min\nThis section describes all necessary steps for the experimenter and the participant prior to scanning.\nMRI safety screening and consent forms.\nNote: The following description is for the procedure with children in elementary school age and young adults in the original study. A similar procedure can be used for other age groups. The specific guidelines for participants of different age groups as required by the relevant institutional review board and the institutional MRI safety procedures should be followed.\nScreen participants for MRI safety, read and sign consent forms. For the group of children, consent forms are signed by the accompanying legal guardian.\nProvide the child with a separate consent form written in child-friendly language.\nIf the child agrees to participate, ask them to sign the consent form.\nBriefly explain the procedure of the experiment to participants and remind them that the experiment also includes another session outside the scanner on a separate day.\nNote: See Psychophysics experiment: Posttest outside the scanner (Day 2) below.\nNote: Some studies report modulations of GABA levels over the course of the natural menstrual cycle in adult female participants.56[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib56],57[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib57],58[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib58],59[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib59] Future studies might consider recording the phase of the menstrual cycle and conducting fMRS only during selected phases of this cycle or only run adult female participants using hormonal contraception.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20],59[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib59]\nCheck visual acuity using a Snellen chart.55[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib55]\nProvide MRI-safe correcting glasses mounted inside goggles if necessary.\nFamiliarization with MRI scanner and tasks.\nCheck that the child and the legal guardian are metal-free and safe to enter the scanner room. Give them a brief scanner tour to familiarize them with the MRI environment.",
    "Place a phantom inside the MRI head coil, plug the coil in and move the table into the scanner to demonstrate the setup for the fMRS experiment.\nExplain the function of the mirror mounted above the MRI head coil and show how the position of the mirror can be manually adjusted to optimize the view of the screen.\nExplain the functions of the buttons on the MRI button box.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2915-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Task design in the original study\n(A) Example trial of the orientation detection task for visual training. Two images are presented successively at the center of the screen separated by a blank interval. One image consists only of visual noise. The other image contains an orientation pattern overlaid by visual noise. At trial end participants are asked to indicate by pressing one of two buttons whether the first or the second image contains the orientation pattern.\n(B) Example trial of the fixation task. A disk presented at screen center changes color from white to pink occasionally in an unpredictable fashion. Participants are asked to press a button when they detect a color change.\nNote: In the original study an orientation detection task is used for visual training during fMRS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Before and after visual training participants perform a fixation task during fMRS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The fMRS measurements with the visual training task are referred to in the following as training fMRS. fMRS measurements with the fixation task are referred to as pretraining and posttraining fMRS. See Frank et al.60[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib60] for a detailed description of important design considerations for visual training tasks.",
    "Note: It could be argued that performing the fixation task modulates neurotransmitter concentrations and that it might be better not to have a task during pretraining and posttraining fMRS (i.e., just asking participants to maintain central fixation or to keep their eyes closed). However, we believe that an omission of the fixation task has the disadvantage that there is no behavioral control of participants’ fixation quality and vigilance.39[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39] Differences in fixation quality and/or vigilance between pretraining and posttraining fMRS (for example, due to effects of fatigue during posttraining fMRS after being in the scanner for some time) might modulate neurotransmitter concentrations.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] In addition, GABA concentrations in the occipital lobe differ between eyes open and closed.61[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib61] This could confound training-related changes in neurotransmitter concentrations between pretraining and posttraining fMRS.\nAlternatives: Future studies might avoid using a fixation task during pretraining and posttraining fMRS by employing MRI-safe eye-tracking. By means of eye-tracking fixation quality and vigilance (as indicated by pupil diameter) can be measured while participants do not have to perform a task requiring a behavioral response.\nOutside the scanner, familiarize the participant with the fMRS tasks using practice trials.\nFixation task: Instruct the participant to press the button under their right index finger on the button box quickly when they detect a change of color of the fixation spot.\nOrientation detection task: Instruct the participant to press the button under their right index finger when the first image contains the orientation and the button under their right middle finger when the second image contains the orientation. Instruct them to quickly press the button only after the second image is presented and release it after the response.",
    "For both tasks instruct participants that no feedback about response accuracy will be provided after their response but that they will notice when they perform well because the task will become more difficult. Explain to them that “difficult” means that the pink color change of the fixation spot in the fixation task and the orientation pattern in the orientation detection task will become weaker.\nComfort children that they do not need to worry about their performance and that they will not be criticized by the experimenter or the legal guardian with respect to their performance.\nCheck carefully whether the participant understands the task by monitoring their performance during the practice trials. If they perform well, task difficulty should increase as shown by more subtle color changes in the fixation task and more noise overlaid on the orientation pattern in the orientation detection task.\nCritical: A different orientation than the trained orientation should be used for practice in the orientation detection task in order to minimize the possibility of learning prior to the fMRS experiment. Visual training is often specific for the trained visual feature.60[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib60],62[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib62],63[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib63],64[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib64],65[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib65],66[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib66] Therefore, even if a little practice already leads to learning, that learning would be for a different orientation than the trained orientation in the experiment. Moreover, the number of practice trials should be limited to avoid training effects (for example, it should be limited to ten practice trials for each task). Only offer additional practice trials if the participant reports difficulty understanding the task(s).\nParticipant setup for scanning.\nSet up the participant for the fMRS measurement. This setup includes participant registration and preparation of MRI scans (three anatomical scans for VOI placement, thirteen successive MEGA-PRESS scans and a water reference scan).",
    "Offer the participant the opportunity to visit the bathroom before the setup commences and notify them that drinking or eating (for example, chewing gum) is not allowed inside the scanner.\nNotify the participant that they will not be able to talk to the experimenter during scanning.\nShow them the panic ball and inform them that they can and should squeeze the panic ball at any time during the experiment in case they do not feel well or want to communicate with the experimenter for whatever reason.\nSqueezing the panic ball will set off an auditory alarm to alert the experimenter outside the scanner.\nUpon hearing the alarm, the experimenter will immediately interrupt the scan and check on the participant inside the scanner.\nRemind the participant to be careful not to accidentally squeeze the panic ball.\nFinally, invite them to squeeze the panic ball once to hear the alarm.\nOffer to the child and the legal guardian that the legal guardian or another experimenter can stay with the child in the scanner room.\nScreen this person for MRI-safety.\nProvide this person (after checking for MRI-safety) with earplugs and headphones.\nProvide an MRI-safe plastic chair for this person to sit in the scanner room.\nProvide ear plugs to the participant and ask them to plug them in as deep as possible into their ear canals while remaining comfortable.\nPosition the participant on the MRI table. Ask them to lay down in supine position.\nProvide padding under the legs and to the left and right of the head inside the head coil. Give them armrests. Offer a blanket if the participant feels cold.",
    "Give the button box to the participant’s right hand and explain the functions of the buttons one more time. Ask the participant to press each button once. Check that the button presses are being recorded by the stimulus computer.\nPlug the head coil in, move the MRI-table up and ask the participant to close their eyes while the position of the head inside the coil is recorded by using a laser.\nAsk the participant to open their eyes again and to indicate if they are fine. Also, ask them to indicate immediately if anything is wrong or if they feel any discomfort while the MRI-table is moved slowly into the scanner.\nCritical: You should check that the head of the participant is in the right position. If a part of the coil is right in front of their eyes, they cannot fully see the mirror. If this is the case, you or the participant must adjust the position of the mirror.\nOnce inside the scanner, ask the participant one more time if they are fine.\nIf they confirm, place paddings next to the participant’s left and right arms in order to avoid any contact between the participant’s skin and the scanner bore that could lead to burns or peripheral nerve stimulation.\nRemind the participant not to cross their legs during the experiment to avoid large loops creating induction circuits that could lead to burns.\nAsk the participant and the legal guardian/experimenter in the MRI room (if they stay) if they are ready for the experiment.\nIf they confirm, the scanning procedure can commence.\nTurn the lights in the scanner room off.",
    "Critical: Once the MRI-table has reached its final position inside the scanner, you should ask the participant again if they can see the whole screen. If they cannot see the whole screen, you can ask the participant to reach for the mirror above the head coil with their hand to adjust its position by moving it back or forth until they can see the screen fine. Ask the participant if they have a firm grip on the panic ball and if they have positioned their fingers over the response buttons on the button box. Ask the participant to press the response buttons inside the scanner while you or another experimenter checks on the stimulus computer that the correct buttons are pressed. Remind the participant that it is possible (although unlikely) that the ear plugs inside the ear canal become loose during the experiment and that if this occurs, they should immediately squeeze the panic ball to alert the experimenter outside the scanner.\nAlternatives: Future studies might consider including a familiarization session in a mock MRI scanner (if available) prior to the experiment. This might be helpful especially for very young and very old participants to adapt them to the scanner environment. During the session in the mock scanner participants can also perform practice trials in the fMRS task(s).\nfMRS experiment: fMRS measurement (Day 1)\nTiming: 50 min\nThis section describes all necessary steps for scanning. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for an overview of tasks and scans.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2915-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experiment design in the original study",
    "The experiment consists of two sessions on separate days. The first session is conducted inside an MRI scanner while high-resolution anatomical and fMRS scans are collected. fMRS is conducted in successive scans with a duration of 3:18 min each. Shimming is performed prior to each fMRS scan. Three successive fMRS scans are collected for pretraining fMRS. Four successive fMRS scans are collected for training fMRS. Six successive fMRS scans are collected for posttraining fMRS. After the final posttraining fMRS scan a water reference scan is collected. During training fMRS participants perform the orientation detection task (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). During pretraining fMRS, posttraining fMRS and during the collection of the water reference scan participants perform the fixation task (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). In the second session on a separate day trained participants perform the orientation detection task in a posttest outside the scanner.\nNote: In the original study fMRS is conducted in a time-resolved fashion using successive MEGA-PRESS scans with a duration of 3:18 min each before, during and after visual training (for similar designs see Tamaki et al.39[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39]; Floyer-Lea et al.67[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib67]; Frangou et al.68[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib68]; Kolasinski et al.69[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib69]). Three successive fMRS scans are collected during pretraining fMRS (∼ 10 min in total). Four successive fMRS scans are collected during training fMRS (∼ 15 min in total). Six successive fMRS scans are collected during posttraining fMRS (∼ 20 min in total). After the final fMRS scan a water reference scan is collected (∼ 1 min).",
    "Alternatives: A single fMRS scan with a total duration of 45 min, or three fMRS scans for pretraining, training and posttraining fMRS (10 min, 15 min and 20 min long, respectively) could be acquired and analyzed over the appropriate time frames. Our approach of conducting fMRS in multiple short scans has the advantage that scanning can be interrupted for a break after the acquisition of each scan and that shimming can be performed prior to each scan.\nAnatomical scans.\nSuccessively collect three high-resolution anatomical scans for sagittal, coronal and transverse planes with the following imaging parameters:\nSagittal plane: time-to-repeat (TR) = 0.19 s, time-to-echo (TE) = 2.46 ms, flip angle (FA) = 70°, in-plane acquisition matrix (AM) = 288 × 288, 25 slices, voxel size = 0.8 × 0.8 × 4.0 mm, inter-slice gap = 1.20 mm.\nCoronal plane: TR = 0.25 s, TE = 2.46 ms, FA = 70°, AM = 288 × 288, 35 slices, voxel size = 0.8 × 0.8 × 4.0 mm, inter-slice gap = 1.20 mm.\nTransverse plane: TR = 0.19 s, TE = 2.46 ms, FA = 70°, AM = 288 × 288, 27 slices, voxel size = 0.8 × 0.8 × 4.0 mm, inter-slice gap = 1.20 mm.\nParticipants can keep their eyes open or closed during the acquisition of the anatomical scans.\nAfter collecting the last anatomical scan check on the participant and ask if they are willing to proceed with the experiment.\nIf the participant confirms, ask them to keep their eyes open for the remainder of the experiment.\nVOI placement.\nUse the high-resolution anatomical scans for VOI placement (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] for examples).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2915-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example VOI locations",
    "(A) Location of the VOI in the occipital lobe in a representative child participant. The VOI (size: 2 × 2 × 2 cm) is shown as gray rectangle overlaid over the participant’s high-resolution anatomical scans (sagittal scan in the left column, coronal scan in the middle column and transverse scan in the right column) using the software Osprey (Oeltzschner et al., 2020).52[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib52] The bright spot under the VOI in the transverse scan corresponds to the superior sagittal sinus.\n(B) Same as (A) but for a representative adult participant.\nPlace the VOI (2 × 2 × 2 cm) for single-voxel proton (1H) fMRS in the occipital lobe.\nUse the calcarine sulcus as an anatomical landmark and place the VOI manually perpendicular to the sulcus and centered between the hemispheres.\nAvoid including the skull bone in the VOI to minimize contaminations by lipid and fat signals.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nAvoid the superior sagittal sinus (shown as a bright white spot adjacent to the back of the occipital lobes).\nThe VOI might need to be rotated (resembling a diamond, see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nTake a photo or screenshot of the location of the VOI overlaid on the high-resolution anatomical scans.\nNote: In the original study the VOI is placed in the occipital lobe because it is known from previous research that VPL involves plasticity in early visual cortical areas.62[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib62],63[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib63],64[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib64] We recommend using results from previous studies or meta-analyses to support the placement of the VOI. However, this approach has limitations when there are differences in the location of the brain region(s) of interest between participants, particularly when the size of the VOI is small. For example, there are small visual motion-sensitive brain regions that tend to vary substantially in location between participants.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20],21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22],23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]",
    "Alternatives: Conduct a functional localizer scan using fMRI in each participant and use the individual location of BOLD-activation for VOI placement.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]\nNote: A VOI can be placed in one hemisphere if it is fair to assume that a brain region in this hemisphere is critical to performing or learning of a given task.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] This approach has the advantage that partial volume effects resulting from including midline structures in a VOI centered between the hemispheres can be avoided. Alternatively, if homologous brain regions in the left and right hemispheres can be assumed to be similarly critical to performing or learning of a given task one might place the VOI in one hemisphere and counterbalance the hemisphere across participants. Another possibility is to center the VOI between the hemispheres. Especially with the relatively small occipital lobe, it might be difficult to place the VOI exclusively in one hemisphere.\nAlternatives: Depending on the study design, one might consider conducting additional fMRS measurements in a separate fMRS run in a control VOI located in a brain region where no neurotransmitter modulations during the performance of the fMRS task are expected. In this way, it can be measured whether modulations of neurotransmitter concentrations during the task are specific to a particular brain region, which is desirable for tasks known to involve specific brain regions. A downside of this approach is that the fMRS measurement time will increase substantially, which might be undesirable for the investigation of sensitive participant groups such as children or patients who can only spend a limited amount of time inside the scanner.",
    "Critical: For multi-session fMRS experiments (i.e., experiments in which participants leave the scanner after one session and return on the same day or on a different day for another session in the scanner) it is important to place the VOI(s) at approximately similar locations in each session. Major anatomical landmarks (e.g., the calcarine sulcus, the central sulcus or the lateral sulcus) or the anterior commissure – posterior commissure line may be used as a reference for VOI placement in different sessions. Post-hoc analyses should be conducted to check the degree of overlap in the location of the VOI across different sessions. Note that on Siemens systems it is also possible to save the position of the VOI at the scanner and use it again during subsequent scanning sessions.\nPretraining fMRS.\nEach MEGA-PRESS scan has the following parameters: TR = 1.5 s; TE = 68 ms; FA = 90°; number of spectral averages = 64; scan time = 3:18 min. WET water suppression is used.42[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib42]\nInitiate the first MEGA-PRESS scan for pretraining fMRS.\nAutomatic shimming is performed before the scan is acquired.\nThe system will show the shimming results. If the results are acceptable (for example, below 20 Hz for a VOI in the occipital lobe), proceed and start the fixation task simultaneously with the acquisition of the first MEGA-PRESS scan. Otherwise, see solution suggested in troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCollect three successive MEGA-PRESS scans for pretraining fMRS while the participant performs the fixation task.\nClosely monitor the participant’s performance in the fixation task and the collected MEGA-PRESS difference spectra using the Siemens inline display.\nThe scanner will pause prior to each MEGA-PRESS scan and show shimming results. Write down the shimming results for each scan for your records and proceed.\nAfter collecting the final MEGA-PRESS scan, terminate the fixation task.",
    "Critical: If you notice that the performance in the fixation task looks suspicious (indicated by a clearly visible color change of the fixation spot on each task trial), perform the solution suggested in troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nTraining fMRS.\nAfter pretraining fMRS check on the participant.\nIf they agree to continue, start the orientation detection task for visual training. Start the task simultaneously with the collection of the first MEGA-PRESS scan for training fMRS.\nCritical: If time permits, repeat the high-resolution anatomical scans prior to training fMRS to verify that the VOI location is still acceptable. If the location differs from the original location, repeat the placement of the VOI.\nClosely monitor the performance in the orientation detection task. If you notice that the performance looks suspicious (indicated by a clearly visible orientation pattern on each task trial), perform the procedure described in troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nThe participant performs the orientation detection task successively (one block for pretest and eight blocks for training).\nCollect four successive MEGA-PRESS scans for training fMRS while the participant performs the orientation detection task.\nOtherwise, follow the procedure described in pretraining fMRS.\nAfter collecting the final MEGA-PRESS scan, terminate the orientation detection task.\nPosttraining fMRS.\nAfter training fMRS check on the participant.\nIf they are ok to continue, start the fixation task for posttraining fMRS. Start the task simultaneously with the collection of the first MEGA-PRESS scan for posttraining fMRS.\nCritical: If time permits, repeat the high-resolution anatomical scans prior to posttraining fMRS to verify that the VOI location is still acceptable. If the location differs from the original location, repeat the placement of the VOI.\nCollect six successive MEGA-PRESS scans for posttraining fMRS while the participant performs the fixation task.\nOtherwise, follow the procedure described in pretraining fMRS.",
    "After collecting the final MEGA-PRESS scan for posttraining fMRS, collect a water reference scan for the same VOI without water suppression using a PRESS scan with the following parameters: TR = 3 s; TE = 30 ms; FA = 90°; number of spectral averages = 16; scan time = 1:03 min.\nParticipants continue to perform the fixation task while the water reference scan is acquired.\nAfter collecting the water reference scan, terminate the fixation task.\nCritical: In addition to water suppression techniques, we recommend collecting a separate water reference scan without water suppression for the same VOI used for PRESS and MEGA-PRESS. This scan can be collected as a single scan prior to or after the fMRS experiment, or it can be collected in an interleaved fashion with the PRESS and MEGA-PRESS scans.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] The acquisition of this water reference scan takes in most cases a minute or less (16 spectral averages are common) and it improves the quality of post-hoc analyses, because the fMRS spectrum can be corrected for residual tissue water signals. The unsuppressed water spectrum is also used for correcting B0 fluctuations due to rapid gradient switching (eddy current effects). The tissue water signal can be used as an internal reference to normalize the absolute metabolite concentrations of glutamate and GABA (see Quantification and Statistical Analysis).\nThereafter, notify the participant that the experiment is finished and that they will be moved out of the scanner.\nSlowly move the MRI table out of the scanner.\nRemove the head coil and instruct the participant to sit up slowly.\nRecommend them to rest on the table for a moment, because they could feel dizzy after being in supine position for a long time.",
    "After this rest period, the participant and the accompanying person in the scanner room are free to leave the room.\nSave the following data files for each scan:\nrda file (text file with measured fMRS spectrum; for MEGA-PRESS there are separate rda files for ON, OFF and difference spectra, each of which should be saved)\ntwix file (time-domain raw data in Siemens twix format; good to check for frequency drift).\nSiemens dicom file(s) (good to save for backup; can be loaded into the Siemens scanner computer at a later time-point for data inspection and for conversion from dicom to rda)\nDouble-check that shimming results are recorded for each fMRS scan and that there is a photo or screenshot of the VOI location.\nSave all other MRI files (anatomical scans, etc.) in the file format provided by the scanner (for example, Siemens dicom).\nPsychophysics experiment: Posttest outside the scanner (Day 2)\nTiming: 15 min\nThis section describes all necessary steps for the psychophysical test on a separate day after scanning.\nPosttest outside the scanner.\nOn a separate day after scanning invite the participant for a posttest in a psychophysics room equipped with a computer, screen, keyboard and chin rest.\nAsk the participant to perform the same orientation detection task as during scanning for one block.\nRemind them that they should press one of two response keys with their right index and middle fingers, respectively, on the keyboard at the end of each trial to indicate whether the orientation is shown in the first or second image.\nRemind them to press the response key after the second image and release it after the response.",
    "After this instruction ask the participant to place their fingers over the two response keys on the keyboard because the room lights will be turned off shortly and it will be difficult to see the keys without the room light.\nAsk the participant if they are ready to start. If they confirm, turn the room lights off and give them time to adapt. If the participant confirms that they are ready to start, commence the experiment."
