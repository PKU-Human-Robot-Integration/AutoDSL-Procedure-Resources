    "Single-cell qPCR protocol can be mainly divided into 4 fractions: The first one comprises cell culture and cell suspension preparation. The second and third are mainly done by the C1 integrated fluidic circuits, which allows single cell separation, cell lysis and pre-amplification. The final fraction is the single real time qPCR, which is done by the BioMarkHD system. Those steps are represented in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316200722_7286.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of single-cell qPCR protocol Sample preparationThis protocol commences with cell culture already ongoing.When the cells reach 70% of confluence are ready to collect.Remove the medium and wash the dish with PBS once.Add 1 ml of TrypLE Express.Place the dishes in the 37 °C incubator, and incubate for 3-5 min until the cells detach.Add 4 ml of pre-warmed complete medium at 37 °C to stop the reaction.Pipette delicately to ensure the complete detach of all the cells but without damaging the cells.Transfer the cells into 15 ml tube.Centrifuge at 300 x g 4 °C for 5 min.Aspirate the medium and add 5 ml of PBS.Take apart 100 μl to count the cells.Centrifuge the 15 ml tube at 300 x g 4 °C for 5 min.While centrifuging, mix the separated cells at a proportion of 1:1 with Trypan blue solution.Insert 10 μl of the mixt into Neubauer chamber.Count the total cell number with the microscope (including dead cells).Remove PBS.Re-suspend the cells at 300 cells/μl (3 x 105 cells/ml) in Initial cell suspension buffer (Recipe 1) and keep on ice.Note: An amount of at least 10,000 cells are recommended to obtain a complete capture, we observed that less than that amount leaves multiple channels with cells unattached in the IFC plate.Single-cell separationTake all the necessary reagents from -20 °C, where are stocked, and let them thaw on ice for 30 min before starting the experiment.",
    "Just before starting, take the reagents kept at 4 °C and put them on ice during its use.Caution: The plate must not be placed on ice. Remove the black plastic situated at the button of the integrated fluidic circuits (IFC) plate.Before starting, turn on the C1 machine since it takes some time to start up (about 3 min).Pipette several reagents following this scheme:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316200756_8735.jpgFigure 2. Representation of IFC plate indicating the wells to add the different reagents and solutions. Same number indicates same solution and volume. The wells covered in grey, represent the section of the chip that is covered by a film of paper, which at the end of the experiment will contain, each single-cell sample pre-amplified ready to use in sc-qPCR.①.Add 200 μl of Harvest reagent. This well is like a button with a plastic lid on an iron spindle. To apply the reagent, press slightly with the tip, and once slips down, put the tip on the space. Then add slowly the reagent. As can be seen in Figure 3.②.Add 20 μl of Harvest reagent.③.Pipette 15 μl of Blocking reagent.④.Add 20 μl of Preloading reagent.⑤.Add 20 μl of Wash Buffer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316200833_7492.jpgFigure 3. Scheme of Harvest reagent (200 μl) application in the IFC plateInsert the plate in the IFC machine with the barcode facing outside.Note: If the bottom of the plate is dirty, the machine will not detect it and will give an error. If so, wipe the bottom with ethanol 70% and place it again. Run the mode STA:Prime (1782x/1783x/1784x) – according to the selected size of channels of the chip. This procedure takes 10-12 min.While priming, prepare the cell mixture.Prepare the cell mixture: 30 μl of cell suspension and 20 μl of suspension reagent.",
    "Note: Less amount of cell mix can be prepared as long as the ratio is maintained. For instance, 6 μl and 4 μl. After priming is finished, click eject and take out the plate.Remove the leftovers of C1 blocking reagent with a P200 pipette (wells are indicated in Figure 2-③).Insert the cells and Live/Dead staining solutions, as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316200909_7941.jpgFigure 4. Representation of IFC plate indicating the wells to add the different reagents and solutions①.Add 6 μl of cell mixture.Note: Do not vortex the cells. Pipette them before the addition.②.Add 20 μl of Live/Dead staining solution (Recipe 2).Place the IFC plate into the C1 system.Select STA: Cell Load&Stain (1782x/1783x/1784x)–according to the selected size of channels of the chip. It takes 30-65 min, depending on the cell size of the plate.Meanwhile, prepare the Lysis Mix, RT Mix and PreAmp Mix (Recipes 3, 4 and 5).When Loading is complete, withdraw the plate from the C1 and take pictures of the cells with Keyence microscope. Using the Phase contrast at 10x, channels and fluorescence-stained cells can be easily observed on the central part of the plate, colored in grey color in Figure 4. Also each well number can also be observed.Write down the channels with dead cells, empty channels and channels with more than one cell to be discarded a posteriori (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316200943_2598.jpgFigure 5. Example of Live/Dead staining. Green cells are living cells while read are dead, or highly damaged cells. Moreover, right chamber shows a doublet, and left one shows a clear single cell.Cell lysis, reverse transcription and pre-amplification.Add the reagents following the scheme in Figure 6:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316201115_8747.jpgFigure 6. Representation of IFC plate indicating the wells to add the different reagents and solutions①.Add 180 μl of Harvest reagent. Carefully move the plate from side-to-side to ensure that the reagent covers all the surface.②.",
    "Add 7 μl of Lysis Final Fix.③.Add 7 μl of RT Final mix.④.Add 24 μl of Pre-amplification Mix (Recipe 6).Place the plate into the C1 system.Select STA: PreAmp (1782x/1783x/1784x)–according to the selected size of channels of the chip- and choose the finish hour. We usually leave it overnight and collect it next morning to proceed with the experiments. The process itself takes 5-6 h approximately.When STA: Preamp process has finished, select EJECT and remove the IFC plate.Using a new PCR 96-well plate, add 25 μl of C1 dilution reagent in each well.Remove the papers than protect the output wells on IFC plate (those covers are represented in grey color in Figures 2, 4 and 6).Using an eight-channel micropipette (Rainin), transfer the samples onto the 96-well plate.Note: The amount of sample should be close to 3 μl, but to ensure, please set the micropipette at 4 μl. Transfer the samples using this specific order, described in Figure 7.Note: Using 8-channel micropipette, and taking in consideration that IFC plate has 16 well per lane, it has the specific size to pic up every-other well.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316201150_4750.jpgFigure 7. Scheme to illustrate the order of well transfer from IFC plate to PCR 96-well plateVortex the 96-well plate and spin down. At this point, the samples can be frozen at -20 °C and be kept for few weeks before use, in that case, seal the plate with a PCR-plate film.Single-cell qPCRTake all the necessary reagents from -20 °C, where are stocked, and let them thaw on ice for 30 min before starting the experiment. Just before starting, take the reagents kept at 4 °C and put them on ice during its use.Caution: The plate must not be placed on ice. Turn on the Standard 96-well Thermal Cycler, because it takes some time to start up.",
    "Remove the blue protective film from the bottom of the 96.96 chip.Using the syringe from the kit, inject the control line fluid in the two big central wells, pressing between the cross (The cross can be seen, marked with an arrow in Figure 8).Note: The oil leaks easily, so be careful when managing the syringe.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316201718_5466.jpgFigure 8. Schematic representation of the 96.96 quantitative PCR Dynamic Array microfluidic chip. The arrow shows the space in where the line fluid should be applied.Insert the plate (with the barcode facing the outside).Select the option Prime(136x). This process takes approximately 20 min.Meanwhile, prepare the Pre-mix sample (Recipe 8).In a new PCR 96-well plate, add 3.3 μl of sample pre-mix in each well.Add 2.7 μl of cDNA sample with a multichannel micropipette (Sample obtained at Step C9) making a total volume of 6 μl in each inlet.Seal with PCR-plate film.Prepare the Taqman assays Mix (Recipe 7) and seal the plate with PCR-plate film.Vortex both plates for 10 sec and spin down.When priming is complete, collect the chip.Transfer the samples and the Taqman assays. In the following order (Figures 9 and 10):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316202038_5921.jpgFigure 9. Scheme of 96.96 chip showing in yellow color the inlets to insert Taqman assays and, in green, the inlets to insert sample premix①.Add 5 μl of Taqman assays in the yellow inlets, using the following order (Figure 10A) to transfer from qPCR 96-well plate to IFC chip.②.Add 5 μl of Sample Premix, using the same order (Figure 10A) in the green inlets.Notes:The inlet wall is not horizontal, but has a diagonal angle. To ensure better application; the best option is insert the tip inclined, as is illustrated in Figure 10B. Avoid bubbles when pipetting.",
    "However, if there are bubbles but they move, means that they are on the surface, and then they will not interfere in the analysis. If bubbles do not move, with a micropipette tip remove the bubble. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200316/20200316202121_3134.jpgFigure 10.
