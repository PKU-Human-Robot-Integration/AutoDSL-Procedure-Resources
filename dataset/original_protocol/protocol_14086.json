    "All animals were treated in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research for animal experiments, following the Guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures and the regulations set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Boston Children’s Hospital. Lrp5-/- mice (stock no. 005823; Jackson Laboratory) and its wild-type (WT) control C57BL/6J mice (stock no. 000664; Jackson Laboratory) were used for this study.\n1. Part I: In vivo imaging of hyaloid vessels using a rodent retinal imaging system\nPreparation of the mice anesthesia and pupil dilation\nSelect the mice.\n\t\t\nUse mice that are older than P12 (after they have opened their eyes) for retinal imaging; both sexes are suitable.\nAs desired, image mutant mice with delayed hyaloid regression (and their WT controls) throughout adulthood. WT mice older than 3 weeks may not exhibit much detectable remaining hyaloid vessels, hence P12–P21 is ideal for imaging remaining visible WT hyaloid.\nPrepare a ketamine/xylazine mixture for anesthesia.\n\t\t\nTake 2.3 mL of ketamine stock solution (100 mg/mL) and 0.7 mL of xylazine stock solution (20 mg/mL) and add 20 mL of sterile saline (0.9% sodium chloride) to make a working solution of a ketamine/xylazine mixture (10 mg/mL ketamine and 0.6 mg/mL xylazine).\nAnesthetize the mice by intraperitoneally injecting ketamine/xylazine mixture in a volume of 8x the mouse’s body weight (e.g., a 20 g mouse needs 160 μL of ketamine/xylazine working solution mixture to achieve a working dose of ketamine [80 mg/kg body weight] and xylazine [4.8 mg/kg body weight] mixture).\nApply one drop of pupil-dilating drug solution (see Table of Materials) to each eye to dilate the mouse’s pupils immediately following anesthesia.",
    "Assess the level of anesthesia by pedal reflex (firm hindlimb toe pinch). Wait until the mouse is sufficiently anesthetized (no pedal reflex) and its pupils are widely dilated.\nOptical coherence tomography imaging of hyaloid vessels\nMoisturize the mouse’s corneas with artificial tears, and then, place the mouse on the positioning stage.\nGently contact the mouse’s cornea with the lens of the OCT probe. Adjust the mouse and probe so that the optic nerve head is in the center of the visual field in the fundus image, to guide the OCT imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: For more details on the general setup of a rodent retinal imaging system (see Table of Materials) and adjusting the mouse’s position, please refer to Gong et al.28.\nAdjust the focus to achieve the optimal images of OCT.\nAdjust the angle of the indicated line in the OCT imaging software (see Table of Materials) to reveal persistent hyaloid vessels and, then, take images.\nFundus fluorescein angiography imaging of hyaloid vessels\nPrepare a fluorescein solution: add 9 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to 1 mL of fluorescein solution (stock concentration: 100 mg/mL). The concentration of the final working solution is 10 mg/mL.\nIntraperitoneally inject the fluorescein working solution (5 μL/g body weight).\nMoisturize the mouse’s cornea with artificial tears, and then, place the mouse on the positioning stage.\nPosition the lens of the Micron IV retinal imaging microscope to make direct gentle contact with the mouse cornea. Adjust the alignment slightly to position the optic nerve head in the center of the view field.\nChange the microscope filter to a green fluorescent channel.\nFocus on persistent hyaloid vessels to take images.",
    "Take multiple images after 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, and 10 min (no more than 10 min) post-injection to determine the best time point (signal-to-background ratio) for observing hyaloid vessels. Complete the FFA procedure within 10 min, after which the fluorescein may become too diffused and make vessels invisible.\nRecovery of the mice from anesthesia\nAfter the procedures, keep the mice on a warm heating pad.\nWait until the mice are mobile again to return them to the mouse cage.\n2. Part II: Ex vivo visualization of hyaloid vessels\nPreparation of fixed mouse eyes\nSelect mice of the right age.\n\t\tNOTE: Neonatal mice are typically sacrificed at P8 for hyaloid dissection. Both sexes are suitable. Mutant mice with a delayed hyaloid regression (and their respective WT controls) may be dissected and analyzed throughout adulthood.\nEuthanize the mice by exposure to CO2.\nEnucleate the mouse’s eyes by blunt dissection.\nOpen the eyelids wide with microsurgery forceps to allow access to the eyeball. Place curved microsurgery forceps under the globe in the orbit to grasp the optic nerve without squeezing the eyeball. Gently pull and remove the eyeball with the forceps.\nAlternatively, dissect the eyeball by using microsurgery scissors to carefully cut parallel to the globe from the four sides toward the back of orbit and separating the globe from surrounding connective tissues.\nImmerse the eyes in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer for 30 min at room temperature for fixation.\nTransfer the fixed eyeballs to ice-cold PBS buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: The eyeballs may be stored in PBS at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\nEmbedding of hyaloid vessels with gelatin injection\nPrepare a 5% (w/v) gelatin solution.\n\t\t\nWeigh out 50 mg of gelatin.\nDissolve the gelatin in 1 mL of distilled water.",
    "Incubate the gelatin solution in a 37 °C water bath until fully dissolved. Keep the solution in 37 °C water until use.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A larger batch of solution may be prepared and stored at 4 °C as aliquots. Every time before use, the solution needs to be warmed in 37 °C water bath to achieve a clear consistency.\nUnder a dissection microscope, inject 50 μL of gelatin solution into the vitreous body at the limbus; repeat the injection 3x at different sites to make a total of four injections, evenly spaced around the limbus (Figure 2A).\nIncubate the eyeballs in a 4 °C refrigerator or on ice for 30 min to solidify the injected gelatin in the vitreous space.\nDissection and isolation of hyaloid vessels \n\tNOTE: See Figure 2B-E.\n\t\nPlace the eyeballs in a Petri dish containing PBS to keep the tissue from drying. Make an incision with microsurgery scissors at the limbus and remove the cornea.\nSnip and remove the optic nerve.\nUnder a dissection microscope, use two pairs of forceps to peel off and discard the sclera, choroid, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layers and remove the iris.\nWith the optic-nerve side of the retina facing up and the lens side down, inject 50 μL of PBS just beneath the retina cup to allow accumulation of the PBS buffer between the gelatinized vitreous body and the retina.\nGently peel off and remove the retina cup and ciliary body from the vitreous body with microsurgery forceps.\nUsing a transfer pipette, transfer the gelatin cup containing the hyaloid tissue immersed in PBS to a microscope slide\nTurn the rest of the tissue (lens/hyaloid) over, so the lens side is facing up.",
    "Lift the lens and gently loosen the connection between the lens/TVL and VHP, and then, cut the HA with microsurgery scissors to remove the lens-TVL. Keep the VHP-part of the hyaloid cup for the flat mount.\nFlat mounting and staining of hyaloid vessels \nGently rinse the hyaloid cup with PBS on the slide to remove all dissection debris.\nMake sure the hyaloid cup is floating on the slide in adequate PBS solution.\nGently arrange and adjust the position of the gelatinized hyaloid cup with microsurgery forceps, with the rim of the cup facing down on the slide, to achieve optimal appearance after melting.\nPlace the slide with the hyaloid cup immersed in PBS onto a slide warmer at 37 °C, wait until the gelatin melts and the hyaloid flattens, and remove the slide when it is barely dry (do not over-dry).\n(Optional) Immunostain the hyaloid vessels\n\t\t\nMake blocking and penetrating buffer (e.g., 5% bovine serum albumin [BSA] and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS buffer). Add 50 μL of blocking buffer onto a flat-mounted hyaloid isolation and incubate it at room temperature for 30 min.\nApply 50 μL of primary antibody (e.g., CD31) (1:100 dilution in blocking buffer) onto a flat mount of hyaloid isolation, and then, incubate it in a wet box at 4 °C overnight.\nGently rinse 3x, for 5 min each time, with PBS.\nApply 50 μL of secondary antibody (e.g., goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody-Alexa 488, 1:100 dilution) onto the hyaloid flat mount and incubate it at room temperature for 1 h.\nGently rinse 3x, for 5 min each time, with PBS.\nAdd a drop of anti-fade mounting medium with DAPI (4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to stain the nuclei in the hyaloid vessels.\nGently place a coverslip on the hyaloid to complete the flat mount.",
    "Imaging and quantification of flat-mounted hyaloid vessels\nImage the DAPI staining of hyaloid vessels with a fluorescent microscope and make sure the central HA is visible (exclude the samples without the HA).\nIdentify vessel branches directly derived from the HA and manually count the number of vessel branches for quantification.\nVisualization of hyaloid vessels in the cross section of eyes \nEmbed fixed eyeballs into optimal cutting temperature compound in a suitable tissue mold, and then, freeze the embedded eyes on dry ice or store them in a -20 °C freezer.\nUse a cryostat microtome to make a cross section of the embedded eyes into sections of 12 μm thickness at -20 °C.\nCollect the eye cross sections onto a microscope slide room temperature by gently touching the tissue sections, which will adhere to the slide.\nAir-dry to dehydrate the tissue sections for ~30 min, which can then be stored in a -20 °C freezer until ready for staining.\nRinse the slide 1x with PBS to remove the remaining optimal cutting temperature compound on the slide.\n(Optional) Immerse the slide into an appropriate fixative buffer (e.g., 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature for additional fixation, if needed.\nPermeabilize the tissue with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.\nPrepare isolectin-IB4 staining buffer for blood vessel staining.\nDissolve and reconstitute isolectin-IB4 (500 μg) powder with 50 mL of PBS in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nSlowly add 50 μL of 1 M CaCl2 solution, drop by drop, into the 50 mL of PBS/isolectin-IB4 mixture. This step needs to be performed slowly to avoid precipitation. The final concentration of CaCl2 is 1 μM. The presence of Ca2+ is required for isolectin-IB4 staining.",
    "Apply 30 μL of isolectin-IB4 staining buffer onto the eye cross sections on the slide and incubate it in a wet box at 4 °C overnight.\nRinse 3x, for 5 min each time, with PBS.\nAdd a drop of anti-fade mounting medium with DAPI to stain the nuclei in the sections.\nGently place a coverslip on the tissue sections to complete the flat mount.\nCheck the tissue under a microscope to visualize the presence of hyaloid vessels within the eyecup.\nSubscription Required.
