    "The study was approved by the local ethics committee for animal experiments (ECD 18/21). Anesthesia monitoring is performed by acquiring the respiratory rate of the animals using a sensor.\n1. F98 GB rat cell model\nCulture the F98 GB cells in a monolayer using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, supplemented with 10% calf serum, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine, and place them in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2 and 37 °C).\nInoculate the glioma cells into the brain of female Fischer F344 rats (body weight 170 g).\n\tNOTE: Use sterile instruments and wear sterile gloves at all times.\n\t\nAnesthetize the rats through the inhalation of isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance) mixed with oxygen (0.3 mL/min) through a nose cone. Confirm the anesthetization by the absence of withdrawal reflex of the limb, and immobilize the rats in a stereotactic device using fixation points for the nose and ears. Apply a carbomer eye gel to prevent dry eyes under anesthesia. Maintain the body temperature by a thermoregulated heating pad and rectal probe at 37 °C.\nShave the rat from the eye level to the back of the skull, and disinfect the skin with isobetadine. Inject xylocaine (with adrenaline 1:200000, 0.1 mL) subcutaneously for local anesthesia.\nExpose the skull through a midline scalp incision and make a small hole with a drill tool 3 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to the bregma in the right hemisphere.\nInsert a stereotactically guided insulin needle (29 G) and inject 5 µL of cell suspension (20,000 F98 GB cells) 3 mm deep using a microsyringe pump controller. Leave the needle in place for 5 min, giving the cell suspension time to diffuse into the tissue.",
    "Withdraw the syringe slowly and close the hole in the skull with bone wax. Suture the skin (polyamide 6, thickness 4-0) and inject meloxicam subcutaneously (1 mg/kg, 2 mg/mL). Apply xylocaine gel.\nStabilize the body temperature of the animal post-surgery using a red lamp. Monitor the awakening of the rat until it has regained sufficient consciousness. Do not return the animal to the company of other animals until fully recovered. House all animals under environmentally controlled conditions (12 h light/dark cycle, 20-24 °C, and 40-70% relative humidity) with food and water ad libitum.\nBe sure to monitor the animals daily and maintain a daily health status log by checking their body weight, food, water intake, and their activity and behavior. Use a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium to euthanize the animals (160 mg/kg) if a decline of 20% body weight is observed or when the normal behavior severely deteriorates (e.g., lack of grooming).\n2. Confirmation of tumor growth\nEvaluate tumor growth 8 days post-inoculation. Anesthetize the rats through the inhalation of isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance) mixed with oxygen (0.3 mL/min) through a nose cone. Confirm the anesthetization by the absence of withdrawal reflex of the limb.\nInject a gadolinium-containing contrast agent (0.4 mL/kg) through an intravenously placed tubing in the lateral tail vein. Cover the animal with a warm water circulating heating blanket and place them in the MRI bed. Apply a carbomer eye gel to prevent dry eyes under anesthesia. Place the MRI bed in the holder with a Tx/Rx Rat brain volume coil.",
    "Perform a localizer scan followed by a T2-weighted spin-echo scan to assess tumor growth. Use these T2-MRI sequence settings: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) 3661/37.1 ms, 109 µm isotropic in-plane resolution, slice thickness 600 µm, 4 averages, 30 slices, total acquisition time (TA) 9 min 45 s.\nIf a tumor is confirmed on the T2-weighted acquisition, perform a T1-weighted contrast-enhanced spin echo scan. Use these T1-MRI sequence settings: TR/TE 1539/9.7 ms, 0.117 mm isotropic in-plane resolution, slice thickness 600 µm, 3 averages, 30 slices, TA 4 min 15 s.\nAfter the MRI, continuously supervise the animal until it regains full consciousness.\nWhen the tumor reaches a diameter of 7 to 8 mm, usually observed 12 days after inoculation, select the animal for therapy.\n3. Multimodality imaging of target volume selection\nNOTE: PET/MRI-guided irradiation requires the sequential acquisition of a multimodal dataset. After intravenous administration of the radiotracer, PET imaging is started, followed by contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI and finally a treatment-planning CT.\nAnesthetize the animal with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance) mixed with oxygen (0.3 L/min) using a nose cone. Confirm anesthetization when the rats do not exhibit any withdrawal reflex of the limb. Apply carbomer eye gel to prevent dry eyes under anesthesia.\nInsert the tubing intravenously in the lateral tail vein, enabling the injection of 10-12 MBq of PET radioactive tracer dissolved in 200 µL of saline. Inject [18F]-FET, 1 h before PET acquisition. Let the animal regain consciousness while the tracer is distributed through the body.",
    "Anesthetize the animal again, as described in step 3.1. Place the animal on a multimodality bed (here, made in-house) and secure it using hook-and-loop fasteners, maintaining a fixed position during the imaging and micro-irradiation. Fix a capillary filled with the MRI/PET agent (see the Table of Materials) for easier co-registration. Wrap the animal in bubble wrap to preserve its body temperature during the multimodality imaging and therapy.\nPerform a PET scan 1 h after the injection of the PET tracer. Reconstruct the PET scan into a 3D volume (192 x 192 x 384 matrix) with 0.4 mm voxel size by applying a Maximum-Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (MLEM)-algorithm using 30 iterations.\n\tNOTE: A dedicated PET scanner for laboratory animal imaging was used with an axial field of view of 130 mm and a bore diameter of 72 mm. This system provides sub-mm (0.85 mm) spatial resolution.\nInject an MRI contrast agent (0.4 mL/kg) intravenously into the tail vein. Place the rat, still fixed on the multimodality bed, in the animal holder of the MRI scanner (Table of Materials). Perform a localizer scan followed by a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo sequence, analogous to step 2.4.\nPlace the animal, still fixed on the multimodality bed, on a plastic holder secured onto the four-axis robotic positioning table on the micro-irradiator. Perform a high-resolution treatment-planning cone-beam CT using a tube voltage of 70 kV, a tube current of 0.4 mA, a 1 mm aluminum filter, and a 20 x 20 cm (1024 x 1024 pixel) amorphous Si flat panel detector. Acquire a total of 360 projections over 360°. Reconstruct the CT images with an isotropic voxel size of 0.275 mm (411 x 411 x 251 matrix).\n4. Image co-registration",
    "NOTE: The co-registration is performed with a semi-automatic MATLAB code developed in-house. The code can be found on Github at https://github.com/sdonche/DosePainting. The different steps are described below.\nPlace the three image modalities ([18F]FET PET, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, and cone-beam CT) into one folder. Convert DICOM images to the NIfTI format using the dcm2niix function from the mricron image viewer24.\nImport the converted images into MATLAB and filter the PET image with a Gaussian filter using a Full-Width Half-Max (FWHM) of 1 mm.\nReorient the images so that the cartesian axes from all imaging modalities correspond with each other.\n\tNOTE: For this setup, the CT image was flipped around the Y-axis; the MRI was flipped around the X-axis, and the PET was flipped around the Y-axis.\nCrop the PET image to simplify automatic co-registration.\n\tNOTE: For this setup, 40 pixels were set to zero from both sides of the X-axis (left and right of the animal); on the dorsal and ventral side of the animal (Y-axis), 60 and 40 pixels were set to zero, respectively; along the longitudinal axis (or Z-axis), 170 and 30 pixels are set to zero for inferior and superior side, respectively.\nMove the image centers close to each other to simplify automatic co-registration.\nPerform the actual rigid-body co-registration using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) in MATLAB26. Use the following registration parameters (others on default): objective function: mutual information; separation: [4 1 0.2]; tolerances: [0.02 0.02 0.02 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.001 0.001 0.001]; histogram smoothing: [1 1]; interpolation: trilinear.\n5. Radiation treatment planning\nNOTE: A MATLAB app and multiple MATLAB scripts were written for the radiation treatment planning. The code can be found on Github at https://github.com/sdonche/DosePainting. The different steps are explained below.\nMethod 1",
    "Load the three different imaging modalities into the MATLAB app. Place a generous bounding box around the contrast enhancement on the T1-weighted MRI scan (Figure 1). Determine the contrast-enhanced volume using a threshold (Figure 2). If multiple regions have been selected, select only the largest volume, the center of which is considered as the first isocenter to deliver a prescribed dose for RT (Figure 3).\nExpand the previously determined MRI contrast enhancement by 10 pixels in each direction. If multiple regions are detected, retain only the largest PET volume, the center of which is considered the second isocenter to deliver a prescribed dose for RT.\n\t\tNOTE: In this PET volume, the PET boost volume is defined by the pixels with a higher signal intensity than 0.90 × maximal signal intensity (in the bounding box) in this volume.\nUse the following irradiation settings for the calculated isocenters (Figure 4 and Table 1).\n\t\t\nFor the first isocenter (MRI), give a prescribed dose of 2000 cGy using 3 non-coplanar arcs at couch positions 0°, -45°, and -90° with a gantry rotation of 120°, 120°, and 60°, respectively. Use a fixed collimator size of 10 x 10 mm, but use an appropriate collimator (e.g., a 5 x 5 mm collimator) when smaller tumor sizes need to be irradiated. Be careful in considering the animal's welfare when the tumor volumes are larger than 10 mm.\nFor the second isocenter (PET), give a prescribed dose of 800 cGy using 3 non-coplanar arcs at couch positions 0°, -45°, and -90° with a gantry rotation of 120°, 120°, and 60°, respectively. Use a fixed collimator size of 3 x 3 mm.\nCalculate the dose distribution within the animal and the beam delivery parameters.\nMethod 2",
    "Load the three different imaging modalities into the MATLAB app. Place a generous bounding box around the contrast-enhancement on the [18F]FET PET image, analogous to step 5.1.1.\nDetermine the volumes defined by the pixels with a signal intensity higher than A × maximal signal intensity (in the aforementioned bounding box), with A equal to 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. Name these volumes V50, V60, V70, V80, and V90, respectively.\nDetermine the isocenters and the jaw dimensions for each beam required to guide the motorized variable collimator using the MATLAB script (see Figure 5).\nUse the following settings for the calculated isocenters and jaw dimensions:\n\t\t\nFor V50, give a prescribed dose of 2000 cGy distributed over 16 beams (each 125 cGy; couch and gantry positions in Table 2). Use the calculated jaw dimensions for the MVC.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Here, an additional margin of 1 mm has been included to account for microscopic tumor infiltration.\nFor V60-V90, give a prescribed dose of 800 cGy distributed over 40 beams (each 20 cGy; couch and gantry positions in Table 2). Use the calculated jaw dimensions for the MVC.\nCalculate the dose distribution within the animal and the beam delivery parameters.\n6. Plan evaluation\nNOTE: To compare the two methods, calculate the dose-volume histograms (DVH) and Q-volume histogram (QVH) in the V50 PET volume. Here, a MATLAB script, developed in-house, was used. The code can be found on Github at https://github.com/sdonche/DosePainting.\nDose-volume histogram\n\t\nGenerate DVH from the dose distribution that was obtained from the SARRP.\nDetermine the maximum, mean, and minimum doses from the DVH by calculating the D10, D50, and D90, where Dx stands for the dose received by x% of the volume.\nQ-volume histogram",
    "Calculate an ideal dose for every pixel using Eq. 1, which is a linear interpolation between the minimum and maximum doses, proportionally varying between the minimum PET intensity and maximum PET intensity within the target volume to give an ideal dose map.\nCalculate the Q-value Qp for every pixel using the following equation (Eq. 2):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62560/62560eq02.jpg Eq. 2\n\t\tWith Dp being the dose obtained by planning and Di, the dose objective for planning.\nGenerate QVH from the obtained Q-values.\nCalculate the quality factor (Q-factor, QF) to evaluate the difference between the planned and intended doses using Eq. 3:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62560/62560eq03.jpg Eq. 3\nSubscription Required.
