    "This protocol is used for isolating mitochondria from animal tissue, such as liver, brain, heart, or muscle. Liver from an adult mouse is specifically employed below. The key steps include tissue extraction, homogenization, and differential centrifugation.\nMaterials\nAdult C57/BL6J wildtype mouse (aged 3 to 6 months)\nIsolation buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-rec-0002]) with or without 1 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; 0.1 M stock in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich, 93482-50ML-F), 4°C\nDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Gibco, 14190094), 4°C\nDissecting scissors (World Precision Instruments, 14393)\nTweezers (e.g., Style 5, Dumont, 0103-5-PO)\n50-ml Falcon tube (Fisher Scientific, 10788561)\n100-ml glass beaker\nScale (with ≥100 g capacity and ≥0.1 g readability error)\nTissue homogenizer (Potter-Elvehjem Tissue Grinder with PTFE Pestle and Glass Tube, Kemble Chase, 886000-0023)\nElectric hammer drill (Black+Decker, BCD700S1K)\n50-ml Oak Ridge ultracentrifuge tubes (Thermo Scientific, 3118-0050))\nUltracentrifuge with temperature control (Beckman Coulter J2-MC High Speed Centrifuge) and JA-20 fixed-angle rotor (Beckman Coulter, 334831), 4°C\nPierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, 23225)\nFalcon 96-well clear plastic plate (VWR, 734-0023)\nMicroplate reader (e.g., Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtech)\nNOTE: The entire procedure should be conducted on ice, using refrigerated equipment maintained at 4°C, or in a cold room.\nNOTE: Please ensure that you follow the appropriate guidelines set by your institution, in line with national regulations, when handling animals.\n1. Sacrifice an adult C57/BL6J wildtype mouse using an institutionally approved procedure.\nIn our procedure, we sacrifice the animal using manual cervical dislocation in compliance with the guidelines set in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, followed by decapitation using scissors, as this minimizes damage to the mitochondria. For most experiments, if testing ≤25 different conditions, the liver from one adult mouse (3 to 6 months of age) is sufficient.",
    "Alternatively, cells could be used. The number of cells needed for mitochondrial isolation will vary based on cell type. For example, the yield of mitochondria from 10 million HeLa cells or a fully confluent 10-cm culture dish is ∼500 µg, which is enough for 10 technical replicates. We suggest isolating a sufficient amount of mitochondria for 12 replicates for a basic experiment, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0002]A, as well as additional mitochondria for functional validation of the isolation technique.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c8421371-ff68-4e06-9d7c-8d58cd3ff336/cpph59-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSchematic and graphical representation of Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0002] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0003].

(B) Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements using isolated mitochondria and an Oroboros instrument. The blue line and left y-axis depict the oxygen concentration in nmol/ml. The red line and the right y-axis report the slope of the blue line, that is, the OCR per milligram of protein, in pmol/s/mg. Drug additions are specified in the order that they should be performed.\n2. Place animal on its dorsal side. Cut through abdomen using dissecting scissors and tweezers. Locate liver, between the ribcage and the gut. Dissect out entire liver, ensuring that all lobes are removed (Lampl, Crum, Davis, Milligan, & Del Gaizo Moore, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-bib-0036]).\n3. Place liver in 20 ml ice-cold isolation buffer in a 50-ml Falcon tube on ice as quickly as possible (<10 min).\n4. Transfer liver from the tube to a 100-ml glass beaker. Rinse liver in ice-cold DPBS by pouring the DPBS on the liver and then carefully decanting it. Submerge washed tissue in DPBS and mince it with scissors into rice grain–sized pieces.\n5. Repeat rinses with DPBS five times, until the blood is removed from the liver.",
    "6. Weigh liver tissue and add isolation buffer with 1 mM PMSF, with the volume in milliliters equaling twice the tissue's weight in grams.\nFor example, use 10 ml isolation buffer for 5 g tissue.\n7. Transfer tissue with the isolation buffer into the glass tube of a tissue homogenizer. Macerate tissue using an electric hammer drill for 10 to 20 plunges to obtain a uniform homogenate that contains no visible pieces of tissue.\nThe capacity of the glass tube as well as the corresponding pestle should be determined based on the volume of the mixture obtained in step 6.\nIt is important to ensure that the strokes of the drill are slow and even.\n8. Transfer homogenate to a 50-ml Oak Ridge ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuge 10 min at 800 × g, 4°C, to generate a nuclear pellet.\n9. Carefully transfer supernatant to another 50-ml ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuge 10 min at 10,300 × g, 4°C, to isolate crude mitochondrial pellet.\nThe nuclear pellet can be discarded.\n10. Pipet off supernatant, carefully resuspend mitochondrial pellet in 1 ml isolation buffer with 1 mM PMSF, and place on ice.\n11. Quantify protein content of the suspension using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, a Falcon 96-well clear plastic plate, and a microplate reader.\nThis step can take between 20 and 45 min.",
    "The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit allows quantification of protein content using colorimetric detection. It relies on copper-ion reduction by proteins, with the reduced copper ions in turn reacting with bicinchoninic acid to produce the color change; this can be measured as a change in absorbance at a wavelength of 562 nm in a microplate reader. The color change follows a linear relationship with the protein concentration under the conditions described within the kit. The kit provides materials and instructions for setting up a standard curve to determine the protein concentration of your mitochondrial sample.\nUsually, a single liver can produce 4 to 10 mg/ml protein in the mitochondrial suspension from step 10. It is possible to combine the mitochondria obtained from livers from multiple animals if from the same genotype and/or treatment condition. When performing the isolation for the first time, that is, for a new source of mitochondria or a new experimental condition, functional validation of the mitochondria using Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0002] to 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0004] is essential before proceeding to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0006] or the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0007]. The mitochondrial suspension can be stored at 4°C for ≤8 hr after isolation. If mitochondria need to be preserved for longer, please refer to Support Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0005], which describes an alternative isolation technique for cryopreservation of functional mitochondria. A workflow for the experimental design is shown in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0001].",
    "Healthy mitochondria maintain a negative ΔΨm across the IMM by pumping protons into the intermembrane space. This requires energy from sequential reduction of components of the electron transport chain, with oxygen as the final acceptor. This electrochemical proton gradient is essential for ATP production by ATP synthase. It is also crucial for electrogenic uptake of Ca2+. Therefore, this mitochondrial property can be assessed using cationic fluorescent dyes such as TMRM or rhodamine-123. Rhodamine-123 is used in the protocol detailed below. This protocol can be carried out immediately after Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001], before proceeding to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0006] or the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0007].\nMaterials\nMSK buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-rec-0004]) with 10 mM succinate (1 M stock; Sigma-Aldrich, S3674) and 1 µM rotenone [1 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Sigma-Aldrich, R8875]\n10 mg/ml rhodamine-123 (Sigma-Aldrich, R8004) in ethanol\nMitochondria (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001])\n1 mM carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; Sigma-Aldrich, C2920) in ethanol\n190-proof ethanol\nDeionized water\nFluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtech), including injector and two pumps\n96-well black opaque plate (VWR, 734-1663)\n37°C incubator\n15-ml Falcon tubes (Fisher Scientific, 10263041)\nExcel or equivalent software\n1. Set temperature of the fluorescence plate reader to 30°C.\n2. Prepare 20 ml MSK buffer with 10 mM succinate and 1 µM rotenone (MSK+; see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0006], step 2).\n3. Add 10 mg/ml rhodamine-123 (fluorescent dye) in ethanol to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml.\nRhodamine-123 is used in ‘dequench’ mode. In short, the cationic dye is loaded into the mitochondria at a high concentration, causing quenching of the fluorescence, which reduces the fluorescence intensity. Upon depolarization and loss of ΔΨm, the dye moves out of the mitochondria and into the buffer, where it is no longer quenched. Thus, the fluorescence signal increases in response to a loss of ΔΨm (Duchen, Surin, & Jacobson, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-bib-0020]).",
    "4. Resuspend mitochondria in the MSK+ containing rhodamine-123 to a final concentration of 500 µg/ml. Add 45 µl mitochondrial suspension to each well of a 96-well black opaque plate in triplicate for each condition (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0002]A for an example plate design) and incubate for 30 min in a 37°C incubator.\n5. Prepare two 15-ml Falcon tubes with MSK+ buffer, with one containing 10 µM FCCP (from 1 mM stock in ethanol) and the other without FCCP (as a vehicle control).\nFive microliters of 10 µM FCCP (final concentration: 1 µM) or the vehicle control is injected at cycle 5 to depolarize the mitochondria.\n6. Clean plate-reader injector with 190-proof ethanol and deionized water before priming the two pumps with 1 ml of the respective solutions from step 5.\n7. Obtain results from samples using the plate reader once every minute until cycle 5. Continue to measure for five more cycles after addition of FCCP/vehicle control.\nThe light source is a high-energy xenon lamp. The emission from the excited sample is collected using a combination optic containing two liquid-filled light guides for measuring fluorescence intensity. An excitation filter of 485 nm (bandpass: 12) is used, and the emitted light is detected with a side-window photomultiplier tube after passing through a 520-nm emission filter. Integrated injectors are used for the compound additions.\n8. Collect data after completion of the five cycles and plot fluorescence intensities against time using Excel or equivalent software.\nAddition of FCCP should cause an increase in fluorescence intensity measurements due to depolarization, indicating an intact ΔΨm at the start. This increase should be absent from the wells with no mitochondria and those with the vehicle (negative) control added.",
    "Healthy coupled mitochondria utilize oxygen at complex IV of the electron transport chain to enable ATP production. Therefore, in the presence of appropriate substrates, an oxygen electrode can be employed to measure the OCR to gauge the health of mitochondria. An Oroboros Power O2k-Respirometer is used in the protocol below; this instrument contains two chambers where dissolved oxygen is measured by a Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrode as an amperometric signal that is in turn converted into a voltage. The data obtained from this protocol provide an estimate of the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation within the isolated mitochondria (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001]), a parameter that should remain consistent across different isolations. This protocol can be used in conjunction with Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0002] to ascertain the viability of the mitochondria obtained from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001].\nMaterials\nMiro5 buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-rec-0003])\nMitochondria (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001])\n2 M glutamate (Sigma, G1251)\n800 mM malate (Sigma-Aldrich, M1000)\n1 M succinate (Sigma-Aldrich, S3674)\n1 mM rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875) in DMSO\n500 mM adenosine diphosphate (ADP; Sigma, 01905)\n5 mM cytochrome c (Sigma-Aldrich, C3131)\n5 mM oligomycin complex (Sigma-Aldrich, O4876) in DMSO\n1 mM FCCP (Sigma-Aldrich, C2920) in ethanol\n5 mM antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A8674) in ethanol\nPower O2k-Respirometer (for high-resolution respirometry; Oroboros Instruments, 10023-02), including sensors, Clark-type electrode chambers with stoppers, and DatLab software\nHamilton syringes (10 µl and 25 µl)\n1. Turn on Power O2k-Respirometer. Calibrate sensors in the Clarke-type electrode chambers using 2 ml Miro5 buffer (respiration medium) to determine the oxygen saturation at 37°C (see manufacturer's instructions), with stirring at 750 rpm.\nThe temperature and stirring can be set using the DatLab software controlling the respirometer.\n2. Add 100 to 300 µg mitochondria to each chamber and close stoppers to create a closed O2 system.",
    "The amount of mitochondria used for respirometry measurements must be optimized. In general, ensure that the basal OCR is >20 pmol per second per milliliter per milligram of protein. Furthermore, the OCR should not be so high as to cause anoxia during the course of the experiment. Please refer to Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0002]B for an example trace to complement the following steps.\n3. Once the OCR stabilizes (see red line in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0002]B; this should take 5 to 10 min), using Hamilton syringes, add 2 M glutamate (final concentration, 10 mM) and 800 mM malate (final concentration, 2 mM).\nThis will achieve State 2, or complex I–linked respiration, which is the OCR due to the flow of electrons from complex I as glutamate and malate provide electrons to complex I.\nUse Hamilton syringes for compound additions in all steps.\n4. Add 1 M succinate (final concentration, 10 mM) and 1 mM rotenone in DMSO (final concentration, 1 µM) to chambers.\nThis will result in complex II–linked respiration, as rotenone inhibits complex I and succinate bypasses this inhibition and provides electrons to complex II.\n5. After the OCR stabilizes, add 500 mM ADP (final concentration, 5 mM) to chambers.\nThe stable OCR after the addition of ADP provides a measure of State 4. This is the maximal OCR in the presence of a saturating ADP concentration; that is, State 4 is the maximum OCR when ADP phosphorylation is coupled with oxygen consumption.\n6. Add 5 mM cytochrome c (final concentration, 10 µM) to the respiring mitochondria.",
    "The integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is tested by observing the effect of cytochrome c addition on the OCR and comparing this OCR to State 4 respiration. An increase of <10% indicates an intact OMM. This is an important step in the functional validation of the mitochondrial isolation technique.\n7. Add 5 mM oligomycin complex in DMSO (final concentration, 5 µM).\nThis step inhibits ATP synthase, thereby identifying the OCR required for ATP production. A substantial decrease in the OCR indicates an intact IMM, with minimal leakage of protons across this barrier, and identifies the rate of oxygen consumption required to sustain ATP turnover.\n8. Titrate FCCP (sequential additions of 0.5 µM from a stock of 1 mM FCCP in ethanol) until maximal uncoupled respiration is attained. Add 5 mM antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, in ethanol to a final concentration of 2.5 µM to determine the non-mitochondrial OCR.\n9. Analyze data using the DatLab software after acquisition.\nIn brief, the average value of the OCR (see red line in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0002]B) after stabilization following drug addition can be extracted, and thus, the effect of the drugs can be compared across different isolations.\nThese assay procedures should be conducted routinely to ensure consistent and accurate mitochondrial isolation, such as every 3 to 5 isolations. A representative trace with expected values is shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0002]B. In particular, ΔΨm and the State 4 OCR should be reproducible across the preparations from the same mitochondrial source on different days, that is, within a 10% error margin.",
    "This protocol summarizes a procedure to quantify mitochondrial proteins using immunoblotting, thus validating the mitochondrial isolation (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001]) by probing for mitochondrially enriched proteins. As loss of cytochrome c from the mitochondria indicates a ruptured OMM, it is possible to diagnose problems with isolation by quantifying the levels of cytochrome c retained in the mitochondrial pellet. Other proteins that can be investigated by immunoblotting include TOM20, VDAC (OMM), subunits of the components of the electron transport chain, and subunits of ATP synthase. Shown below are a few key steps for western blotting; this procedure can be adapted for different equipment and reagents.\nMaterials\nMitochondria (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001])\nNuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (4×; Invitrogen, NP0008) with 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, M6250)\nProtein standards (Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope Prestained Protein Standards, Bio-Rad, 1610375)\nNuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel (Invitrogen, NP0321BOX)\nNuPAGE MOPS SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen, NP0001)\nImmobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore, IPVH00010)\nMethanol\nNuPAGE Transfer Buffer (Invitrogen, NP0006) with 20% (v/v) methanol\n5% (w/v) skim milk (Millipore, 1153630500) in TBS-T (see below)\nPrimary antibody (recommended: anti–cytochrome c, Abcam, ab13575; anti-VDAC1, Abcam, ab15895; anti-TOM20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-136211; Total OXPHOS Rodent WB Antibody Cocktail, Abcam, ab110413; ensure that species origin of antibody is compatible with experimental setup)\nTris-buffered saline (TBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-rec-0005]) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (Sigma, P9416) (TBS-T)\nHorseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated IgG secondary antibody (Sigma, A9044 or A0545)\nChemiluminescent reagent (e.g., Luminata Forte Western HRP substrate, Merck Millipore, WBLUF0100)\n1.5-ml Eppendorf tube\n50°C heating block\nProtein gel electrophoresis chamber system (XCell SureLock Mini-Cell, Thermo Fisher, EI0001)\nPower supply (e.g., PowerPac HC High-Current Power Supply, Bio-Rad, 1645052)\nSemi-dry blot transfer system (Novex Semi-Dry Blotter, Invitrogen, SD1000)\nBlot imaging system (ChemiDoc XRS+ System with Image Lab Software, Bio-Rad, 1708265)\nImageJ2 software (National Institutes of Health)",
    "1. For each sample, heat 50 μg mitochondria in NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube for 5 min in a 50°C heating block for each sample.\nThe sample buffer is supplied as a 4× stock, and the volume needed will be determined by the volume of mitochondrial suspension used.\nCritically, a lower temperature is used to preserve the structure of target epitopes of the mitochondrial proteins.\n2. Load samples and protein standards into the wells of a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel immersed in NuPAGE MOPS SDS Running Buffer and separate proteins using a protein gel electrophoresis chamber system and a power supply according to the manufacturers’ instructions.\nIdeally, the gel is run at 150 V for 45 min (the dye front should have run 80% down the gel) before moving on to step 3. The same mitochondrial sample can be run in multiple wells so that multiple primary antibodies can be used to probe for different proteins. The user should probe for cytochrome c at a minimum as a measure of an intact OMM in the mitochondria in the suspension.\n3. Activate an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane with methanol for 1 min. Transfer proteins from the gel to the PVDF membrane in NuPAGE Transfer Buffer with 20% methanol using a semi-dry blot transfer system at 20 V for 1 hr.\n4. Incubate membrane in 5% skim milk in TBS-T for 1 hr to block the membrane.\n5. Incubate membrane with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4°C.\n6. Wash blots three times with TBS-T for 5 min each before incubating them with the corresponding HRP-conjugated IgG secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature.",
    "7. Wash blots with TBS-T as in step 6 and visualize protein bands using a chemiluminescent reagent and a blot imaging system.\n8. Use densitometry analysis via ImageJ2 software to determine the relative expression levels of the protein across samples.\nExpression levels of the mitochondrial proteins listed above can be instrumental in functional validation of the isolation technique. In particular, one should expect sufficient detection of cytochrome c and little fluctuation between expression levels of other proteins across different isolations. It is advisable to store some protein samples from isolations for which the results from Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0002] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0003] and the main assay in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0006] were satisfactory as a positive control in comparison of protein levels. Immunoblotting can also provide a parallel investigation to identify underlying causes of differences in ΔΨm, the OCR, or Ca2+ retention capacity. Together, Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0002] to 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0004] provide both quality-control checks and additional assessment of mitochondrial physiology.",
    "Because of the time needed and batch-to-batch variability, the mitochondria isolation procedure (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001]) can be the rate-limiting step in high-throughput assessment of mitochondrial permeability transition. Long-term storage of isolated mitochondria is advisable to improve assay efficiency and consistency. Because freeze-thaw cycles can disrupt both the OMM integrity of mitochondria and bioenergetic function, cryopreservation of mitochondria with intact OMM integrity and biological functions is accomplished using trehalose, a naturally occurring osmolyte (Yamaguchi et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-bib-0049]).

Wash tissue with wash buffer three times to remove blood.\n3. Drain wash buffer and replace it with ice-cold homogenization buffer with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor. Homogenize using a tissue homogenizer as described in step 7 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001], once again using a volume in milliliters equaling twice the tissue's weight in grams.\n4. Transfer homogenate to a 50-ml Oak Ridge ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuge 10 min at 800 × g, 4°C, to remove the nuclear pellet.\n5. Centrifuge supernatant 10 min at 10,300 × g, 4°C, to obtain the crude mitochondrial pellet.\n6. Wash mitochondrial pellet by adding the same volume of homogenization buffer as in step 3 and repeating step 5.\n7. Resuspend pellet in 1 ml homogenization buffer and determine protein concentration using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001], step 11).",
    "8. Using liquid nitrogen, snap freeze mitochondrial suspension at a concentration of 50 mg protein/ml in homogenization buffer and store frozen samples at −80°C for ≤7 months (Briston et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-bib-0010]).\nFor subsequent use, thaw the mitochondria at 37°C in a water bath and maintain them on ice until functional analysis.",
    "This protocol is designed to determine the capacity of the isolated mitochondria (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001]) to accumulate Ca2+ until the mPTP opens. Temporal fluorescence measurements of Ca2+-sensing dyes in the extra-mitochondrial buffer provide a simple and robust readout. An increase in fluorescence intensity in response to Ca2+ addition is closely followed by a decrease in fluorescence intensity as a result of an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Sequential additions of Ca2+ ultimately reach a threshold that results in opening of the mPTP, failure of the mitochondria to accumulate additional Ca2+, and Ca2+ release from the mitochondria. This results in a rapid increase in fluorescence intensity. This protocol uses a fluorescence plate reader with an integrated injector system for adding sequential Ca2+ pulses. For the purposes of drug or phenotypic screening, we recommend using CsA as a positive control for pore inhibition.\nMaterials\nMSK buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-rec-0004])\n1 M succinate (Sigma-Aldrich, S3674)\n1 mM rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich, R8875) in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D8418)\n1 mM Fluo-5N (Invitrogen, 14203) in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D8418)\nCalcium chloride (CaCl2)\n190-proof ethanol\nDeionized water\nMitochondria (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0001])\nFluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtech), including integrated injector and pump\n15-ml Falcon tube (Fisher Scientific, 10263041)\n96-well clear plastic plate (VWR, 734-0023)\nExcel or equivalent software\n1. Set temperature of the fluorescence plate reader to 30°C.\n2. Prepare MSK buffer supplemented with 10 mM succinate (stock concentration, 1 M) and 1 µM rotenone (stock concentration, 1 mM in DMSO) (MSK+) to energize the mitochondria and allow electrogenic mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.\nWe recommend using 20 ml MSK+ for a basic experiment, as described in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0003], and scaling up as needed for additional conditions.",
    "Succinate acts as a substrate for complex II, and rotenone inhibits complex I, thereby preventing reverse electron transfer through complex I and blocking accumulation of oxaloacetate, a known inhibitor of complex II activity.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f88df6c3-c5c8-40ec-ac0f-ed30141d75c3/cpph59-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nAssessment of the minimum conditions needed to determine the Ca2+ retention capacity of the isolated mitochondria, performed in triplicate. The mitochondria-free condition provides a measure of the total Ca2+ added, and the Ca2+-free addition helps define background fluctuations. Cyclosporin A is a cyclophilin D–dependent inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is the vehicle control for the cyclosporin A. A positive control for pore inhibition, such as cyclosporin A, is needed when using the assay for identifying drug candidates.\n3. Add 1 mM Fluo-5N (fluorescent dye) in DMSO to the MSK+ to a final concentration of 1 µM.\n4. In a 15-ml Falcon tube, prepare a 100 µM CaCl2 solution in the Fluo-5N-containing MSK+.\nA single 10-µl sample of 100 µM CaCl2 is added beginning at cycle 5, and this is repeated every 10 cycles thereafter for a total of 12 additions (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0004]). This results in incremental accumulation of ∼10 µM Ca2+. Please note that the capacity of mitochondria to accumulate Ca2+ can vary based on the source of the mitochondria, that is, different tissues or cell lines, and the concentrations of the Ca2+ additions should be titrated accordingly to allow resolution of pore opening between controls and treatments that delay pore opening. This step can be performed in a pilot experiment, where ideally a concentration that causes pore opening between the third and ninth Ca2+ additions should be used.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/faf5998b-f83b-43e1-aea5-03028000a267/cpph59-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

Resuspend mitochondria in the MSK+ containing Fluo-5N from step 3 to a final protein concentration of 500 µg/ml. Add 100 µl mitochondrial suspension to each well of a 96-well clear plastic plate in triplicate for each condition (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0003]).\nA basic plate map for running the assay requires four conditions: wells without mitochondria, to which Ca2+ pulses are added, to represent the total Ca2+ added; wells with mitochondria but with no Ca2+ additions for background measurements; wells with mitochondria and Ca2+ additions to determine mPTP opening under control conditions; and finally, wells with mitochondria that have been pretreated with the positive control, CsA (10 mM in DMSO; Tocris, 1101), to isolate the effect of pore inhibition on Ca2+ retention capacity.\n7. Analyze samples with the plate reader, adjusting the gain settings using a well containing only the CaCl2 solution as a maximum reading.\nThe light source is a high-energy xenon lamp. The emission from the excited sample is collected using a combination optic containing two liquid-filled light guides for measuring fluorescence intensity. An excitation filter of 485 nm (bandpass: 12) is used, and the emitted light is detected with a side-window photomultiplier tube after passing through a 520-nm emission filter. Integrated injectors are used to perform the Ca2+ additions.",

    "Mitochondrial permeability transition is accompanied by mitochondrial swelling due to loss of IMM integrity. This can be measured as a decrease in light scattering. Historically, this technique was used to identify inhibitors of permeability transition. However, inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can also prevent mitochondrial swelling, resulting in false positives. Nevertheless, simultaneously measuring absorbance and Ca2+ retention capacity can help distinguish between inhibitors of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and inhibitors of pore opening.\nThe experimental setup is the same as that described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0006] and does not require additional material. The additional measurement of absorbance is conducted simultaneously at 540 nm, and the samples would need to be set up in the plate as depicted in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-prot-0006]. A decreased sensitivity to permeability transition is indicated by a reduced loss of absorbance compared to the control (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpph.59#cpph59-fig-0005]). Pore opening in the Ca2+ retention capacity assay is mirrored by a steep negative gradient in the absorbance curve. This assay makes possible the measurement of two aspects of permeability transition: that is, mitochondrial swelling due to influx of water and unregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ release. These data provide the user with additional confidence in the results with little extra effort in setting up the experiment.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3d671484-ad2a-4b88-a466-62f75d1498f4/cpph59-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nTypical absorbance curves for mitochondria isolated from mouse liver. In this example, a single bolus of Ca2+ is added (arrow) to trigger Ca2+-induced pore opening. A loss of absorbance is observed compared to the condition with no Ca2+ addition. Cyclosporin A (CsA) can rescue this phenotype. Because the swelling assay lacks sensitivity compared to the Ca2+ retention capacity assay, a subtle difference in pore desensitization might be missed if using this assay alone."
