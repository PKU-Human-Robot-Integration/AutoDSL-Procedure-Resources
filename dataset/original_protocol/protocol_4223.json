    "Enzyme assays for the purified GlpX proteins in vitro The FBA activity in the direction of SBP synthesis was done by using a discontinuous, coupled enzyme assay containing TKT (from S. cerevisiae), recombinant GlpXC and GlpXP, as well as FBAC and FBAP from B. methanolicus as described below. Because E4-P is not acquired by purchase, E4-P was generated in a pre-reaction by the TKT (5 U/mg) from F6-P and GAP.Protein production and purification was done as follows: The enzymes were cloned into pET16b, which allows IPTG-inducible expression with an N-terminal decahistidyl tag and a factor Xa cleavage site in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3). The induction with 0.5 mM IPTG was started at an OD600 of 0.5 to 0.6 in LB. The cells (500 ml) were harvested 4 h after induction and washed in 20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazol, and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol. Pelleted cells were stored at 20 °C until protein purification.Prior to lysis by French press, cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazol, and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol, and protease activity was inhibited by addition of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mM diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP).The extract was cleared by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 140,000 x g.Peak fractions of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose affinity chromatography eluted with 20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 100, 200, or 400 mM imidazol, and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol were pooled, and the pooled fractions were desalted using Sephadex G25 gel filtration and buffered in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5).After purification, the His tag was cleaved by factor Xa according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.The purified protein was buffered in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.",
    "5), 20 mM F6-P, 20 mM GAP, 20 mM DHAP, 10 µM thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), 2 mM MnCl2 and 3 U/mg of each purified enzyme (FBAC or FBAP and GlpXC or GlpXP). The reaction was started by addition of TKT (5 U/mg). The detection of the generated products was performed via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) as described below. The assay was performed at 50 °C for 45 min in volume of 1 ml. The reaction was stopped by purification of the containing enzymes using Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter. Therefore, the reaction mixture was sampled to the Amicon® Ultra filter device and cap it and the device was centrifuged at 14,000 x g for approximately 30 min. Thereby the proteins were filtered out of the mixture but the remaining incredients passed. The supernatant was then free of protein and the incredients were analyzed by LCMS. The expectations and results and described in a separate section below.LC-MS analysis of the products after enzyme assayLC-MS data were obtained using a LaChromUltra HPLC system coupled to a microTOF-Q hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer. For Ionization the mass spectrometer is equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Separation of the samples via HPLC was carried out by a SeQuant ZIC-pHILLIC column using the solvents 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution (pH 9.3) as eluent A and acetonitrile as eluent B. The injection volume was 2 µl, flow rate was set to 150 µl min-1, and gradient elution was performed as follows: t = 0 min, 80% B; t = 30 min, 10% B; t = 35 min, 10% B; t = 40 min 80% B; t = 60 min 80% B. MS detection was performed via ESI source in negative ionization mode. Nitrogen was applied as sheath, dry and collision gas.",
    "For internal mass calibration a solution of formate (0.1 M) in 50 % (v/v) isopropanol was injected within each MS analysis. MSMS analyses were performed by the auto MSMS mode of the microTOF-Q. Table 1. Parameters for microTOFcontrol in full scan MS modetable:",
