    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nObtain a cell suspension enriched in cardiac exophers from primary cardiac tissue\nTiming: 1 h\nThe primary method described here was adapted from other methods developed to isolate non-cardiomyocyte cell populations with the use of standard laboratory equipment and reagents for downstream cellular and molecular analyses (Aronoff et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Pinto et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). The protocol is based on collagenase-mediated digestion of the extracellular matrix to release cells and, in this case, its subcellular particles. An explanatory video with steps 1–18 is provided (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPrepare the procedure space (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). You will need\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/411-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Perfusion and heart isolation for exopher preparation\n(A) Material needed: (1) cold PBS, (2) forceps, (3) surgery scissors, (4) dissection table, (5) 10 mL syringe with 21G needle loaded with cold PBS and (6) 70% ethanol.\n(B) Immobilization of the mouse.\n(C) First incision.\n(D) Skin removal.\n(E) Access to peritoneal cavity.\n(F) Access to thoracic cavity.

    "Cold PBS for harvesting the heart and perfusion.\nSurgery scissors and forceps for the dissection\nDissection surface.\n10 mL syringe with a 21G needle loaded with fresh PBS.\n70% ethanol.\nEuthanize mouse using CO2 asphyxiation or by any other institutionally accepted euthanasia procedure following your animal facility guidelines.\nPlace mouse in a supine position on the dissection stage and immobilize it by pinning its paws and feet to the stage, e.g., by using syringe needles (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nSpray the mouse torso with 70% ethanol to minimize fur dispersal and make an incision of superficial abdominal tissue below the lower costal bone and diaphragm by using forceps and scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Then, cut upwards toward the head removing skin to reveal the peritoneal cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nAccess the peritoneal cavity by removing the peritoneum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nAccess the thoracic cavity and the heart by gently cutting the diaphragm laterally while holding the sternum with forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nCut the two lateral margins of the anterior thorax toward the head and flip it upwards. Be careful to avoid puncturing the lungs and heart (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F–1G).\nYou can now immobilize the anterior thorax by pinning it with a syringe needle to the dissection surface (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nPerfuse the heart (and the entire mouse), by nicking the right atrium using surgical scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I) and hold the heart with the apex pointing upwards using forceps. Carefully insert the syringe needle in the apex of the heart into the left ventricle and inject 10 mL of cold PBS at a flow rate of approximately 5 mL/min for 2 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J).\nNote: Here you can follow different options:\nUse a syringe with a 21G needle manually. This requires more skill and experience (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J).\nUse a pump.",
    "Note: Place needle gently in the left ventricle and be careful not to puncture the interventricular septum, pulmonary valves, or atrial valves. Effective perfusion is indicated by gradual change of liver color from a deep red-brown to light yellow-brown, and of the lungs from pink to white (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J versus Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K). Perfusion should be performed within less than 5 min after euthanasia in order to avoid blood coagulation, which would difficult the process and contaminate the organs of interest with circulating cells.\nRemove the heart and trim away left the atria to ensure only the intact myocardium is isolated.\nNote: This step is easier if you first remove the whole heart by cutting the major vessels below atria (aorta and major pulmonary arteries and veins; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K). Then you can carefully remove the vessels and the atria in a petri dish with cold PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L).\nPlace the heart in a 15 mL Falcon tube filled with 3–5 mL of ice-cold PBS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]M).\nPlace the tube on ice, isolate any other desired tissues if needed and repeat steps 1–11 for any additional mice.\nNote: Ideally, the time elapsed between harvesting of the tissues and processing should not be more than 1 h.\nOnce in the bench, prepare a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of digestion buffer, one tube for each heart.\nPut the isolated hearts in the tubes with digestion buffer and mince them with surgical scissors into small pieces (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]N).\nNote: Hold the Eppendorf tube with one hand and mince using surgical scissors on the other hand. Clean your scissors between samples with PBS in a petri dish and paper. It is not necessary to pre-warm the Digestion buffer before this step.",
    "Place the tubes in a 37°C heat block for 45 min with 100 rpm agitation.\nAfter incubation, mix by pipetting up and down gently using a 1 mL pipette and a tip with the end trimmed (2 mm diameter). This is important to reduce the applied shear force and avoid rupture of non-disaggregated pieces of tissue.\nPre-wet a 40 μm strainer placed in a 50 mL Falcon tube with 1 mL sorting buffer. Then, transfer the digestion mixture to the strainer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]O).\nAdd 4–5 mL of cold sorting buffer through the strainer gently in order to stop the enzymatic reaction and help cells go through.\nRemove the filter and discard the non-disaggregated pieces of tissue that had not gone through.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge samples at 50 × g for 5 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant into a new 15 mL Falcon tube. Discard the pellet that contains mostly cardiomyocytes and cell aggregates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]P).\nCentrifuge samples at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant into a new 15 mL Falcon tube. Discard the pellet that contains mostly small cells such as fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells.\nCentrifuge samples 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, discard supernatant, and keep the pellet, which is enriched in cardiac exophers (Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: this serial centrifugation strategy is an adaptation from other protocols used to enrich the fraction containing apoptotic bodies (Atkin-Smith et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), similar in size (1–5 μm in diameter) to cardiac exophers (Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nRe-suspend the pellet in 100 μL of sorting buffer containing antibodies at the desired concentration and incubate for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.",
    "Note: in our case, we used CD31 (1:200 dilution) for the exclusion of endothelial cell derived particles, which are major components of the heart (Pinto et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), thereby cleaning our gating strategy. If assessment of other surface proteins in cardiac exophers, you should add the relevant probes/antibodies in this step.\nAdd 1–2 mL of sorting buffer to wash off the excess of antibody.\nCentrifuge 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, discard supernatant, and keep the pellet.\nRe-suspend the pellet with 1 mL of sorting buffer containing Draq5 (1:5,000 dilution), a DNA probe that allows discrimination of nucleated versus non-nucleated structures. Keep samples at 4°C in the dark.\nSamples are now ready to perform flow cytometry analysis. This analysis should be performed within the next 4 h.\nIf the goal is to sort exophers, prepare 1.5 mL Falcon tubes with 100 μL of collection buffer.\nCritical: Except for the enzymatic digestion, use always ice-cold solutions. In order to minimize the generation of cardiomyocyte-derived debris, avoid mechanically forced dissociation of the tissue by smashing or pipetting. Use only the cells/cardiac exophers disaggregated by enzymatic dissociation. The volumes indicated here are calculated for processing a whole heart. However, in order to obtain enough cardiac exophers for flow cytometry/FACS, 1/4 of the organ is sufficient so that the rest can be used for other purposes. If this is the case, you can modify the volumes accordingly.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods video S1. Procurement of a cell suspension from primary cardiac tissue, related to steps 1–18\nThis video includes the major steps for the first part of the protocol, including: mouse dissection, perfusion, heart collection, cardiac tissue digestion and procurement of a single cell suspension.\nCardiac exopher identification by flow cytometry\nTiming: 1–4 h",
    "The purpose of this part of the protocol is to identify cardiac exophers in a flow cytometer, in combination with FACS or not, in order to perform downstream analysis on the exophers. The reduced size of these particles demands to increase laser potency and work at slower flow velocities than usual. For FACS it is likely that samples need to be diluted 1:10 or more to increase efficiency.\nGating strategy is provided in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/411-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Identification of cardiac exophers by flow cytometry\n(A and B) Gating strategy used to identify cardiac exophers based on (A) size, markers and (B) fluorescence in a cardiomyocyte-reporter mouse model (αMHCCRE Rosa26TdTom, referred as CardRED) (Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\n(C) Back-gating of cardiac exophers, as identified in (A) and (B).\n(D) Bright-field images of sorted exophers.\nCardiac exophers will be among the particles with highest FSC-A and SSC-A signal in the 1,000 × g pellet obtained in the previous part of the protocol (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: a logarithmic view for FSC-A and SSC-A instead of Linear will be useful to discriminate cardiac exophers in this plot. Also, you can use clean sorting buffer to identify the “noise” threshold and avoid contamination from buffer. However, exophers are much larger than any particle coming from sorting buffer (Not shown).\nDiscard doublets by using FSC-H and FSC-W (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nDiscard particles containing DNA (Draq5+) or endothelial markers (CD31+). This will help “cleaning” the final gate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "Use the fluorescence signal from cardiomyocytes in your fluorescent reporter model to identify cardiac derived exophers from the rest of particles of similar size. Use wild-type or Cre-negative mice as a control to establish the gate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). In our case, we induced Tdtomato fluorescent protein expression specifically in cardiomyocytes by crossing mice with a Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse Myh6 promoter (myosin, heavy polypeptide 6, alpha isoform; αMHCCRE; Oka et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) with Rosa26Tdtom (Madisen et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). These mice were referred as CardRED in our original publication (Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), although similar results can be obtained with other reporter fluorescent proteins, such as GFP (Not shown). We have used animals from 1 to 50 weeks of age and from both sexes with similar results.\nAfter detection of the cardiac exophers by flow cytometry, you can back-gate those to better define your gates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C)."
