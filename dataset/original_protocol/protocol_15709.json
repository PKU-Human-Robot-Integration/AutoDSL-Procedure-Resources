    "1. Cortical brain organoids generation\nNOTE: All the steps in this section of the protocol will occur in a Class 2 biosafety hood, unless stated otherwise.\nInduction of 2D neuroectodermal colonies from hPSC 2D culture (Days -1 to 3)\n\t\nBefore induction, plate the hPSC colonies on a hESC qualified basement membrane matrix in a 6-well plate at 20%-30% density. Achieve this density by passaging hPSC colonies from one well of a 6-well plate at 60% confluency into three wells of a 6-well plate.\nFor basement membrane matrix coating, dilute the basement membrane matrix at a ratio of 1:50 in a plain basal medium. Evenly deposit 1 mL/well of a 6-well plate, incubate for 1 h at room temperature (RT), and then aspirate.\nMaintain hPSC colonies for 1 day in 2 mL of a serum-free cell culture medium prior to differentiation.\nOn the day of hPSC differentiation, inspect the hPSC colonies using brightfield microscopy at 4x to 10x magnification to ensure healthy colonies with no detectable differentiation.\n\t\tNOTE: Healthy hPSCs will form tight edge colonies with cells that have a large nucleus, very small cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli. Differentiated iPSC colonies will exhibit clear morphological differences to that of the described hPSC colonies above, particularly around the outer edges of the colonies or at the center.\nAdd reagents listed in Table 1 to make up the N2 medium required for differentiation. Bring this medium to RT before use.\nOnce at RT, aspirate the serum-free cell culture medium from each well of the 6-well plate and replace with 2 mL of N2 medium gently added with a 5 mL serological pipette.\nAdd the dual SMAD inhibitors, SB-431542 (10 µM) and LDN 193189 (100 nM).",
    "NOTE: The SMAD inhibitors can be added to the N2 medium after the medium has been placed in each well, or to the required amount of N2 medium prior to replacing the serum-free cell culture medium. Inhibitors can be evenly incorporated into the medium by gently swirling the plate or inverting the tube containing the medium and inhibitors 3-4 times.\nAdd fresh N2 media supplemented with SB-431542 (10 µM) and LDN 193189 (100 nM) daily to each well for the next 2 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Fresh N2 medium is added to reduce the prolonged exposure of cells to the DMSO that is used to dissolve SB-431542 and LDN 193189 compounds and prevent cytotoxicity.\nGeneration of 3D neuroectodermal spheroids from induced 2D neuroectodermal colonies (Days 3 to 7)\n\t\nLift the induced neuroectodermal colonies using dispase following steps 1.2.2-1.2.8.\nFirst, remove 2 mL of N2 medium from the 6-well plate, and wash 1x with HBSS to ensure that all of the N2 medium is removed.\n\t\tNOTE: N2 medium can interfere with the enzyme activity of dispase, preventing adequate detachment of neuroectodermal colonies from the well.\nAdd 1 mL of 2.4 unit/mL dispase to each colony-containing well.\nIncubate the well for 20-25 min (maximum 30 min) at 37 °C. Check for colony detachment regularly.\n\t\tNOTE: Small colonies may detach within 20 min. Any colonies that remain stuck down after 30 min should be ignored.\nAfter incubation, add 1 mL of N2 medium to the well to stop the activity of the dispase enzyme and transfer the colonies into a 15 mL tube using a wide-bore P1000 pipette tip or a modified P1000 pipette tip cut with sterile scissors (making it a wide-bore P1000 tip).\nAllow the colony clumps to sink to the bottom of the tube with gravity.",
    "NOTE: This process will take approximately 1 min.\nOnce the clumps have sunk, carefully remove the supernatant with a standard P1000 pipette tip and replace it with 1 mL of fresh N2 medium. Repeat this washing step three times to ensure complete removal of dispase.\n\t\tNOTE: Any remaining dispase will prevent a uniform formation of neuroectodermal spheroids and induce cell death.\nAfter washing, resuspend the cell clumps in 3 mL of N2 medium and transfer to one well of a 6-well plate and add 40 ng/mL of bFGF.\n\t\tNOTE: If a high number of neuroectodermal colonies were detached, these colonies could be plated across two or more wells of a 6-well plate to prevent spheroids fusion. 24 h after dispase detachment of the colonies, check whether the spheroids have formed.\nMaintain the spheroids in the same media for the next 3-4 days but add fresh bFGF (40 ng/mL) to each well daily to promote neuroectodermal cell proliferation, self-organizing, and induce and expand neuroepithelia.\n\t\tNOTE: If spheroids have been plated at a higher density, the media is likely to turn yellow and require replacing every 2 days with fresh bFGF (40 ng/mL). However, this is not recommended, and instead, a lower number of spheroids should be maintained in each well to avoid this issue. Spheroids can be embedded in the basement membrane matrix after 3 days if neuroepithelia are evident. If neuroepithelia are not evident or do not look strong, then maintain the spheroids for another day and check again.\nCortical brain organoid differentiation and maintenance (Day 8)\n\t\nPrepare the terminal differentiation media (DM) using the reagents listed in Table 2. Bring this media to RT.\nThaw 100% hESC-qualified basement membrane matrix on ice.",
    "Prepare a sheet of parafilm with dimples sterilized with 70% ethanol in a 10 cm Petri dish and place it on a stereomicroscope under a hood.\n\t\tNOTE: An empty tray of 200 µL pipette tips can be used to generate a grid of dimples.\nCut the end off a 100 µL pipette tip (to make it wide-bore). This will be used for embedding neural spheroids in the basement matrix without breaking them.\nUsing a stereomicroscope, select similar-sized neural spheroids (500 µm) from the 6-well plate and transfer them to the parafilm-dimples using the wide-bore 100 µL pipette tip, placing a single neural spheroid per dimple.\nGently remove any excess media, leaving just enough to cover the spheroids.\n\t\tNOTE: This is to maintain the quality of the spheroids before adding the basement matrix and to ensure they do not dry out.\nGently add 18 µL of basement matrix over the spheroid, positioning the spheroid within the center of the matrix drop. Use the end of a 10 µL pipette tip to center the spheroids in the matrix.\n\t\tNOTE: Try to add the basement matrix as quickly as possible to avoid the excess media around the spheroids from drying out.\nCover the 10 cm Petri dish and transfer into the incubator and incubate the parafilm dish with basement matrix embedded spheroids at 37 °C for 25 min.\nAfter incubation, rinse off the embedded spheroids into a low attachment 24-well plate using a P1000 tip with 0.5 mL of the DM media, making sure individual embedded spheroids are placed in one well each.\n\t\tNOTE: If more than one embedded spheroid falls into one well, use a wide-bore P1000 tip to transfer the other spheroid into a new well.",
    "Maintain the differentiated cortical brain organoids in the DM media for prolonged periods of time, with media changes occurring every 2 days when the organoids become larger and older.\n\t\t​NOTE: During the first week of differentiation, the medium can be changed every 3 days.\n2. Characterization of neuronal aging in Cortical organoids\nProcess cortical organoids for cryosections:\n\tNOTE: The steps were performed in a Class 2 biosafety hood.\n\t\nPrepare 2 mL tubes, each filled with 1.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nCut the end of a P1000 pipette tip (to make it a wide-bore) and gently transfer each organoid to one of the 2 mL tubes prepared above (one organoid per tube).\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent excess DM media mixing with the PFA, allow the organoid to sink toward the opening of the P1000 pipette tip and rest the tip just above the top of the PFA in the tube before pipetting the organoid out. This will enable the researcher to transfer just the organoid and very minimal media.\nAllow the fixation process to take place at 4°C for 1 h.\nUsing an uncut P1000 pipette tip, carefully aspirate excess PFA and add 1.5 mL of cold 1x PBS.\nTransfer the tubes to an orbital shaker set at 70 rpm for 10 min at RT.\nRepeat the washing process with cold 1x PBS three times to ensure all PFA has been thoroughly removed.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not dispose of PFA in regular waste containers; instead, prepare a specific chemical waste disposal container for this, as PFA is a hazard.\nImmerse the organoids in 1x PBS containing 30% sucrose and incubate at 4 °C until all organoids have sunk to the bottom of the tube.",
    "NOTE: The time required to allow the organoids to sink depends on the size/age of the organoids. 3-month-old organoids may take up to 5 h.\nUsing a cut, wide-bore P1000 pipette tip, gently transfer three to five organoids into a mounting mold containing a mounting solution made of 30% sucrose and 100% optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium, at a ratio of 3:2.\nUse a 10 µL pipette tip with the aid of a stereomicroscope to orientate and position organoids in a grid-like pattern.\nPlace the mold on dry ice to solidify the sucrose OCT solution before proceeding with cryo-sectioning (16-20 µm) using a cryostat.\n\t\tNOTE: For senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, all tissues must be processed for sectioning once they have sunk. For immunofluorescence, tissues can be processed for sectioning the next day. All the slides containing sections must be stored at -20 °C before subsequent immunofluorescence or beta-galactosidase, if not stained immediately.\nProcess for analysis of senescence in the cortical brain organoids:\n\tNOTE: The following steps can be performed on a regular lab bench.\n\t\nTransfer the slides into a microscope slide staining container with a lid and wash the sectioned organoid tissue three times with 1x PBS for 10 min at RT to remove any excess mounting solution.\nFollowing this, incubate the washed tissue with freshly made beta-galactosidase staining solution overnight at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The beta-galactosidase staining solution is made of phosphate buffer (for 10 mL of phosphate buffer: 8.15 mL of 1 M NaH2PO4, 1.85 mL of 1M Na2HPO4) adjusted pH = 6, 100 mM of potassium hexacyanoferrate (III), 100 mM of potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) trihydrate, 5 M of NaCl, 1 M of MgCl2, 20 mg/mL of X-Gal. Avoid using a standard cell culture incubator containing CO2 as the CO2 will alter the pH of the beta-galactosidase staining solution.",
    "Wash the stained tissues with 1x PBS three times for 10 min each at RT to remove the beta-galactosidase solution.\nMount the washed tissues with a glass antifade mountant and allow the mounting solution to solidify for 30 min at RT before viewing under the microscope."
