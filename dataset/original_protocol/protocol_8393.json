Inside the newly created directory, create six subdirectories with the following names: raw.files, fastqc.output, bowtie.output, homer.output, macs2.output, motif.analysis, and reports.\nPrepare data and perform quality control analysis of raw sequence data.\nMove to the \"raw.files\" directory and download the ChIP-seq data files.\nVerify the filenames. If the sequencing was paired-end, there will be 4 files (two for treatment and two for input) with similar base names: PDGFRα_Olig2.read1.fastq, PDGFRα_Olig2.read2.fastq, PDGFRα_input.read1.fastq, and PDGFRα_input.read2.fastq. If the filenames are different, rename them using the \"mv\" command.\nMove to the \"fastqc.output\" directory.\nObtain quality control metrics from the raw reads using a fastq file quality control software10.

Use the command in Figure S1B for trimming both the treatment and the input separately. Parameter 'CROP' indicates the remaining read length after trimming bases from the end and 'HEADCROP' specifies the number of bases to be eliminated from the start of the read.\nThe trimming command also includes the minimum read length to be accepted after filtering in the parameter 'MINLEN'. If reads are at least 50 bp, use 35 bp as the read length threshold.\nMove to the \"fastqc.output\" directory.\nPerform the fastq file quality control analysis after trimming the reads.

To decide adequate filtering thresholds, make a histogram plot to determine the density of each metric. Filter out values below a selected threshold to obtain significant peaks.\nDownload the mm10 blacklist (regions are known to have artificially high signal) and filter out the ChIP-seq peaks which are inside any of those artifact regions.\nCreate a bed file with the filtered peaks containing the following columns: chromosome, start, end, peakID, mock, and strand. Fill the mock column with a dot \".\" since it is not used. In the strand column, set all values to \"+\". Save the bed file as \"filtered.peakData2.bed\".\nCopy the \"filtered.peakData2.bed\" file in the \"reports\" directory.\nMove to the \"reports\" directory.",
