    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn case the participants are pediatric patients, as in the case of BECTS, they should be accompanied by at least one parent. There may be situations during the experimental night, in which the child gets impatient, reluctant, or maybe even a bit scared. It is therefore helpful to quickly establish a trusting relationship with child and parent. Allowing the patient to bring their favorite stuffed animal or toy can make the laboratory bed feel less unknown. If the child nevertheless decides not to participate further, this is naturally to be respected. If possible, the parents should sleep in a room right next to the laboratory or on a second bed inside the laboratory.\nPre-sleep procedures\nTiming: 1.5 h\nBefore the sleep recordings begin, follow these steps to prepare the patient and ensure a safe and successful experiment.\nParticipants arrive at the laboratory in the evening, around two hours before their normal bedtime, providing sufficient time for preparations. Take particular care to ensure the child has understood the upcoming procedures and is content with the experiment.\nIn addition to adapting the auditory stimulation volume to the patient’s individual hearing threshold (see step 4 below), the experimenter may choose to screen for previously undiagnosed hearing impairments. To this end, pure-tone audiograms (PTA) may be recorded by assessing the minimal required volume to perceive pure tones of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Participants with a PTA above 30 dB should be excluded.\nApply EEG electrodes and in-ear headphones. Depending on the number of EEG channels, this may take some time and an audio play or active conversation can make this procedure more tolerable for the patient. Make sure the headphones are well secured. Medical tape over the ears and along the cable may be necessary.",
    "Assess the individual hearing threshold:\nTo this end, present a tone to the patient via the headphones. The tone should be the same that will later be used for stimulation (e.g., a burst of pink noise with 50 ms duration and 5 ms falling/rising flank).\nIn a typical hearing threshold test, the tone is inaudible at first and is stepwise increased in volume until the child signals its perception.\nRepeat the procedure to verify the hearing threshold.\nNote: For later stimulation, increase the volume by an additional +12 dB to ensure stimulus perception despite increased hearing thresholds during sleep.\nCritical: Hearing thresholds as measured during wakefulness should not exceed 60 dB SPL, which corresponds to levels during a typical verbal conversation. Higher levels would be indicative of a hearing impairment and could lead to potentially disturbing or even harmful volume settings during sleep.\nSend patient and, if applicable, parent to bed.\nSleep recordings and auditory stimulation\nTiming: 3–9 h\nOnce the patient reaches stable non-rapid eye movement sleep (NonREM stages N2-N3), when interictal spiking in BECTS typically is at its maximum, present tones to the patient using an automatic or semi-automatic procedure (see script below).\nEnsure the signal from the currently used detection electrode shows clear spiking with high amplitudes. In case that, even at the optimal location, spikes do not sufficiently stand out from other activity, see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]. In case spikes are more prominent at another location, see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nOnce the subject has reached stable NonREM sleep (i.e., uninterrupted N2 or N3 for a few minutes), start the auditory stimulation at a volume 12 dB above the previously determined hearing threshold. If stimulation causes arousals in the participants, see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].",
    "A possible stimulation setup comprises an analog D360 patient amplifier (Digitimer Ltd.) and a Power1401 data acquisition unit (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], see also key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nSpecifically, the EEG signal at the detection site is recorded and bandpass filtered between 4 and 25 Hz by the D360 amplifier.\nThis filtered signal is then relayed to the Power1401 unit (Cambridge Electronic Design), which digitizes the signal at 200 Hz and control the auditory stimulation via an in-built sequencer.\nA key component of the stimulation algorithm is the detection threshold. Stimulation is triggered whenever the recorded signal downward-crosses this amplitude threshold. No fixed value can be provided for the threshold since it is recording-specific and dependent on a variety of physiological, technical, and signal processing factors. These factors include:\nThe distance of the detection electrode to the epileptic focus,\nseverity of the discharges,\nquality of the recording,\nnoise levels,\nfilter settings etc.\nNote: Based on our experience, we propose a starting value around -300 μV.\nThe online spike-detection and stimulation algorithm may look as follows:\nPhase 1 (Inactive phase): Wait in this phase until the filtered signal reaches a value above the detection threshold (e.g., when returning from a previous spike), then proceed to Phase 2.\nPhase 2 (Spike detection and stimulation): Wait while the signal remains above the detection threshold. Once a downward crossing of the detection threshold is detected, deliver an auditory stimulus immediately or after a pre-defined delay. After a stimulus has been presented, the algorithm is briefly paused before it returns to Phase 1. A pause of around 2.5 s is recommended to allow brain responses to unfold and underlying neural refractory processes to expire.\nPause detection upon transition into REM sleep, in which spikes tend to disappear in BECTS, or signs of arousals (see below).",
    "Optional: If neural responses to stimulation are intended to be compared with time windows without stimulation, consider adding a period in which spikes are detected and marked in the data, but no tones are presented.\nPseudo-code for a simple stimulation algorithm:\n% This algorithm runs in a loop throughout the recording night.\n% Parameters:\n% s = most recent sample of the EEG signal recorded and filtered\n    by the via D360 amplifier\n% t = threshold to identify neg. deflections of spikes, default = -300\n    μV. Note: threshold requires downward crossing to activate\n    stimulation\n% d = optional random delay between spike detection and stimulus\n    presentation, e.g., 1.5–3.5 s\n% r = refractory period following each stimulus presentation\n% p = flag coding the current phase of algorithm ([1 2] = phase 1 and 2)\n% a = flag representing state of detection with 0 = inactive and 1 =\n    active. This flag could be toggled e.g., by an experimenter who is visually assessing the current sleep stage based on the ongoing EEG recording or an online sleep scoring algorithm.\n% The algorithm is initialized with a = 1 and p = 1.\nif a == 1 {\n    % Phase 1: Ensure signal has not yet crossed the downward threshold\n    if p == 1 {\n        if (s > t) {\n          p = 2        % proceed to algorithm phase 2\n        }\n    }\n    % Phase 2: Spike detection and stimulation\n    elseif p == 2 {\n        if (s < t) {\n          wait(d)      % optional random delay\n          play sound    % auditory stimulation\n          wait(r)      % refractory period\n          p = 1        % back to algorithm phase 1\n        }\n    }\n}\nOnce activated, monitor the stimulation algorithm for the following cases:",
    "If the stimulation does not induce a visible evoked response in the EEG, e.g., a negative deflection with a trough amplitude of a least -40 μV within 1 s, increase volume by 3 dB SPL.\nNote: As a safeguard, volume levels should not exceed 80 dB SPL.\nIf stimulation disturbs the sleeping pattern of the subject, i.e., induces an arousal indicated by an increased EMG amplitude and/or an increase in high frequent activity in the EEG, decrease volume by 3 dB SPL and wait for stable NonREM sleep before stimulation commences again.\nIf the participant drops out of NonREM sleep, stop the stimulation, and continue only after stable NonREM sleep has re-established.\nContinue until the planned stimulation duration is reached. Turn off the stimulation equipment. The participants can now continue sleeping without further stimulation. Make sure the child remains able to call for their parent if needed.\nAt a previously agreed upon time, wake up the parent and let them wake the child.\nPost-sleep procedures\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nIn the morning, retrieve all equipment and debrief patient and parent.\nAfter the patient is awake, remove the electrodes.\nPerform a debriefing: Fill out debriefing questionnaire. It is often preferable for either experimenter or parent to go through the questionnaire together with the child in the form of a conversation, rather than in a strict question-answer manner. Make sure the child can say and ask anything it likes. The patients should feel that their contribution is valued by the experimenters and leave with a positive memory of the experiment."
