    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAgarose pad preparation\nTiming: 10–20 min\nThis step describes how to make agarose pads, which are used to mount worms. Additional resources about the techniques described here also can be found in WORMATLAS, \"Mounting Animals for Observation with Nomarski DIC Optics\" by Monica Driscoll (https://www.wormatlas.org/agarpad.htm[href=https://www.wormatlas.org/agarpad.htm])\nDissolve 2% (w/v) agarose in M9 buffer in a microwave oven. Heat until it is fully dissolved. Put on a hot plate or a metal bath (65°C) to keep it melted during agarose pad preparation.\nOptional: It is recommended to aliquot 5 mL of agarose solution into a 15 mL Corning centrifuge tube, which can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 months. When needed, take 1 tube into a metal bath (80°C) and heat it to dissolve completely.\nPlace three clear microscope slides in parallel. Adhesive tapes are pasted on the two side slides, which provides approximately 200 μm thicker space than the middle slide (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/457-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Agarose pad preparation\n(A) Three microscope slides are placed in parallel, with laboratory tape on the two side slides.\n(B) An Agarose pad is made by sandwiching a small drop of molten agarose between two glass slides spaced by the laboratory tape.\n(C) The agarose pads are stored in a humidity chamber (a pipette tip box with wet paper inside).\nAdd one drop (approximately 100 μL) of 2% molten agarose onto the center of the middle slide and quickly, but gently, lay down another slide orthogonally on the drop. Make sure the top slide across the three parallel bottom slides to create a flat agarose surface (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). The thickness of the pad is determined by the tape on the two adjacent slides.",
    "Note: Avoid bubbles when putting the glass slide onto the agarose drop. The bubbles will turn into sunken holes for worms.\nOptional: To strictly prevent the animals from turning and moving, levamisole can be added into the 2% molted agarose (5 mM work solution) before making the pads.\nAfter the agarose pad is solidified (about 1 min), separate the slides with the agarose pad so that the pad remains attached to one slide (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Then, store the slide in a humidity chamber at room temperature (15°C–25°C; a pipette tip box with wet paper towels on its bottom) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/457-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Shrink and dehydrated agarose pads after long time storage\nA freshly made agarose pad with smooth surface (A), a shrinking agarose pad after a short period (B), and a severe dehydrated agarose pad for a long period (C).\nOptional: We also recommend 10% agarose pads with 0.1 micron polystyrene beads, especially for long-term or time-lapse imaging (Fang-Yen et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The preparation of 10% agarose pads is the same as described above in this section steps 1–4.\nNote: If not used immediately, agarose pads should be transferred to a humidity chamber before mounting the worms.\nPause Point: The agarose pads can be kept in a humidity chamber for 1 h although the fresh agarose pad is always recommended. If some agarose pads shrink or appear dehydrated (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C), they cannot be further used.\nMounting worms\nTiming: 5–15 min\nThis step describes how to mount worms on agarose pads, which are used for imaging.\nAdd 5 μL of 5 mM levamisole onto an agarose pad.",
    "Pick 10–20 worms at late L4 stage into the levamisole solution on the pad and gently swing the pick to spread the worms sparsely (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). The worms are allowed to be anesthetized for 1–2 min in 5 mM Levamisole.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/457-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Worms on the agarose pad\nThe mounted worms are spread out sparely (A) versus stacked together (B). Scale bar, 500 μm.\nNote: Too much levamisole solution can cause worms to float off the agarose pad. You should not exceed to add more than 5 μL of liquid to the agarose pad. This is especially important for long-term imaging. If necessary, you can limit the volume of levamisole as low as 1 μL to restrict further movement of worms. In this case, place the coverslip as fast as possible to avoid worms from dehydrating.\nNote: If not imaging PVD neurons at different developmental stages on purpose, late L4 stage worms are recommended. The high order dendrites of PVD neurons are just fully developed at late L4 stage (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A), yet without exuberant branches in aged worms (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). The typical vulva morphology at late L4 stage is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/457-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

The PVD dendrites grow excessively with exuberant branches as indicated by the red arrows.",
    "(C) Fluorescent image of a PVD neuron at late L4 larval stage visualized by the wyIs592 reporter after being mounted for about 3 h. The degenerating dendrites are indicated by the red arrows. Scale bars in (A)–(C), 50 μm.\nCritical: When picking worms, the residual OP50 E. coli on the pad should be reduced to the least. The presence of OP50 will enhance fluorescence background, and may induce worms to move during imaging.\nCritical: The mounted worms should be spread out sparsely and not stacked together (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). In this way, a single worm can be found in a field of microscope when taking pictures.\nCritical: Worms must be picked gently. PVD neurons are very vulnerable to stresses. PVD dendrites in wounded worms usually appear weaker fluorescence or degenerating (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nCover the worms with a coverslip. Store the slide in a humidity chamber and wait for another 5–10 min before imaging.\nCritical: Cover the worms immediately after 1–2 min anesthesia. The complete morphology of highly ordered dendrites of a PVD neuron can be well visualized only in the lateral view (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C). However, longer waiting time before putting on the coverslip will cause high percentage of the mounted worms to lie in the dorsal or ventral view (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D–1F).\nCritical: It is critical that the worms remain strictly still throughout the imaging period. The total anesthetized procedure needs at least 5–10 min after mounting.\nNote: When covering with a coverslip, avoid bubbles in the process, which will interfere with the refractive projection of fluorescence. If the slide has bubbles, avoid collecting images near the bubbles for analysis.",
    "Optional: If you choose 10% agarose pads, after step 5 and before step 6, add 1 μL of 0.1 micron polystyrene beads in water (total liquid volume less than 5 μL) onto the pad. Vaseline can be used to seal the coverslip to prevent evaporation of the sample for long-term or time-lapse imaging.\nImaging\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nPlace the well-prepared slide on the microscope stage and properly focus to find the PVD neuron under the microscope.\nFirst, find the worms using bright field illumination under low magnification (5 or 10× objective). Choose separated worms with a perfect lateral view.\nThen, switch to 20× magnification and turn on the 488 nm laser to select worms with whole branches (1°, 2°, 3°, and 4°) of a PVD neuron for imaging.\nFinally, switch to high magnification (40×/1.3 N.A oil immersion objective) and focus on the PVD neuron.\nNote: When previewed in the fluorescence field, the worm should be observed by low fluorescence intensity and low exposure to avoid fluorescence quenching.\nCritical: It is best to choose a field without worms sticking to each other. Otherwise, the fluorescence intensity of the imaging worm may be disturbed by the fluorescence of the neighboring worms, or this may cause problems in later image processing.\nAcquire microscopy images.\nAdjust the major parameters (Channel, laser intensity, exposure times, pinhole and bit depth) for imaging appropriately. The goal is to see the PVD soma and all its branches (1°, 2°, 3°, and 4°) clearly in the image.\nNote: When imaging, enhance the excitation intensity to clearly show the 4° branches, while the cell body may be a little over-exposed.",
    "Note: For wyIs592, the exposure value is generally 100–200 ms and the laser intensity is 5%–10% using Nikon Spinning Disk confocal microscope. Of course detail imaging parameter settings can be modified according to your microscope and sample preparation. Exposure time and excitation light level will depend on the baseline signal and expression level of the fluorescence.\nWe typically image 15–30 Z steps (0.5 μm/step) until all branches can be photographed clearly. The whole image of a PVD neuron is performed using 3–4 visual fields under 40× magnification.\nCritical: Based on our experience, the imaging process is better to be accomplished within 1 h. Longer time sometimes leads to weaker fluorescence intensity or degenerations of PVD dendrites.\nImage processing\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe ∗.nd format images are opened with ImageJ (NIH) software (Schneider et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Convert the image type to 8 bit and the color to gray. Then Maximum-intensity Z projection is generated.\nAdjust “Brightness/Contrast” for optimal fluorescent intensity and weak background signal. Capture screen and calculate scale bar. Then save pictures. Assemble images from 3–4 visual fields to get a complete dendrite structure of a single PVD neuron. The final representative worm images are showed with the anterior to the left, the posterior to the right, and vulva facing downward (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: In some cases, it is possible to use lower magnification (20× or 40× objective) depending on what feature of PVD you are interested in. 20× objective can only show the overall dendrite organization, while 40× objective can clearly show the structure of the neuron at all levels. If you want to see more details on dendrites, such as organelles and subcellular localization of certain proteins, you can go for a higher magnification (60× objective)."
