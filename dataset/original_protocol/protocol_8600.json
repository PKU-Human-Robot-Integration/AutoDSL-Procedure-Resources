  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for animal experiments issued by the Federal Republic of Germany.\nNOTE: Because the retinal tissue will be devoid of oxygen during prolonged parts of this procedure, all steps should be carried out as fast as possible. Mice should be dark-adapted at least 3 hr before dissection. To avoid light adaptation of the retina, preparation and slicing should be carried out under dim red light.\n1. Preparation of Media and Other Chemicals\nPrepare Ames' Medium6. After dissection, immerse retinal tissue in Ames' Medium at all times.\nDissolve 2.2 g of Ames' Medium and 298 mg HEPES in 250 ml distilled water. The concentration of HEPES will be 5 mM. Stir gently until all particles are dissolved.\nBubble Ames' Medium at room temperature with carbogen (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide) for at least 5 min. Supply carbogen with a glass Pasteur pipette to the solution. Connect the Pasteur pipette via appropriate tubing to the outlet of the gas regulator.\nAdd 475 mg sodium-bicarbonate to the solution. The addition of bicarbonate after bubbling prevents precipitation of calcium carbonate.\nPrepare low gelling temperature agarose. Agarose is required for embedding of retinal tissue during vibratome sectioning.\nDissolve 180 mg agarose in 9 ml Ames' Medium and 1 ml distilled water. Use a microwave to slowly heat the agarose solution until all solids are dissolved. Heat in 5 - 10 sec increments to avoid overflow. Solution should be clear and transparent.\nStore dissolved agarose in water bath at 37 °C for duration of the procedure.\n2. Setting up the Vibratome",
    "NOTE: All sectioning has been carried out with the vibratome listed in the Materials Table. The given settings refer to this type of vibratome only. For further details on vibratome sectioning of neural tissue please refer to reference7.\nPlace vibratome injector blade into blade holder.\nMeasure vertical deflection of the blade with the \"vibrocheck\" device. Use the adjustment screw on the blade holder to tilt the blade until it is parallel to the cutting plane. The exact positioning of the blade is necessary to prevent venetian blind effects on the section surface and to produce a flat section that contains living cells on its surface.\nSet vibratome to the following settings: amplitude, 1.00; speed, 0.20; thickness, 180 - 200 µm.\n3. Dissection of Mouse Retina\nAnaesthetize adult C57BL/6 mouse by vaporization of about 1 ml isoflurane in an air-tight container. When anesthesia is complete, euthanize animal by cervical dislocation. The mouse should not be older than 3 months, otherwise the quality of the slices will deteriorate.\nRemove eye ball by placing a curved forceps under the eye. Gently lifting up the eye ball will expose the optic nerve. Cut the optic nerve with a spring scissor and transfer the eye ball to a 35 mm petri dish containing 2 ml Ames' Medium.\nCarry out all subsequent steps on the stage of a stereo microscope. Adjust the magnification to a value that allows optimal visual control of the following procedures (steps 3.4 - 3.9).\nPuncture the cornea at the transition to the sclera with pointed forceps or a 20 G needle. During this step, steady the eye ball with another forceps. Be careful not to damage the retina with the puncturing device.",
    "Insert the spring scissors into the small hole made in step 3.3 and cut a circle around the cornea. Again, steady the eye ball with forceps while cutting. Keep the incision very close to the surface in order not to cut into the retina.\nCarefully remove cornea, lens, and vitreous body with forceps. The vitreous body comprises only a thin transparent layer in the back of the eye. However, it is essential for vibratome sectioning that the vitreous body is fully removed.\nIn the petri dish, position the eyecup in a way that one looks through the hole down onto the retina. The rim of the opening should consist of scleral tissue only. If the circular cut (step 3.4) has been carried out too close to the equator of the eyecup, retinal tissue will also be present close to the incision. Be careful then not to damage the retina in step 3.8.\nGrab the sclera with forceps and carefully tear the tissue apart. It is essential not to rupture the retina during this step. If necessary, detach the retina from the ora serrata by steadying the scleral part of the tissue with the forceps and carefully peeling off the retina with the other forceps. Keep the forceps closed; never handle the retina with forceps since the tissue is very soft and will give way immediately.\n\tNOTE: At this step, the retina and the rest of the eyecup will be connected only at the optic nerve head.\nCut the attachment site at the optic nerve head with the spring scissors. The retina should now be freely floating as a single piece of tissue in Ames' Medium.",
    "Cut the retina into 4 - 6 small rectangles of approximately 23 mm using a curved scalpel blade by holding the retina along the edges with the forceps, to manipulate it into position. Avoid pinching the retinal tissue within the rectangles. Take pieces from the central parts of the retina, not the far periphery.\nTransfer retinal pieces with a large-diameter plastic Pasteur pipette to a 35 mm plastic petri dish, the bottom of which has been replaced by a mesh with grid size less than 1 mm. Fix the Petri dish within the upper third of a beaker or conical flask and submerge retinal pieces in Ames' Medium bubbled with carbogen.\n4. Embedding of Retinal Pieces in Agarose\nCarefully transfer 2 - 3 retinal pieces into a 35 mm plastic Petri dish together with some of the Ames' Medium. It is most convenient to use a large-diameter plastic Pasteur pipette for transfer. In this step, the exact orientation of the retinal pieces does not matter.\nRemove as much as possible of the remaining Ames' Medium with a glass Pasteur pipette. As soon as the fluid has been removed proceed with step 4.3. Do not let the retinal tissue dry.\nImmediately cover retinal pieces with 2 ml of dissolved agarose (37 °C). Given the size mentioned in step 3.10, the pieces will not curl up within the agarose.\nWithin the liquid agarose, gently push retinal pieces to the bottom of the petri dish. The ganglion cell layer should be facing down. Use a stereo microscope for judgement of exact position. For positioning, handle retinal pieces with a small spatula. Position the retina as fast and precise as possible since the agarose will solidify quickly.",
    "Arrange retinal pieces parallel to the bottom of the glass dish; otherwise sections will be tangential or oblique. Individual pieces should not touch each other, but also should not be too far apart. Try to place retinal pieces more or less on the same horizontal level.\nPut glass petri dish with embedded retinal pieces into the refrigerator (4 - 6 °C) for at least 2 min. This will quickly harden the agarose for further processing. As soon as the agarose has polymerized proceed with the next step.\n5. Mounting of Retinal Pieces\nCarefully remove the agarose block containing retinal pieces from the petri dish. Use a spatula or a similar device to lift the agarose block from the glass. Due to adhesive forces, this can turn out to be quite difficult. However, avoid breaking the agarose block. Carry out this and all subsequent steps at room temperature.\nPlace the agarose block on a glass coverslip and adjust its size with a scalpel blade. Leave 1 - 2 mm of agarose on each side of the retinal pieces. The final size of the block should be around 1,066 mm (10 mm refers to the height of the block, 6 mm to its edge length).\nGlue the agarose block to the specimen holder of the vibratome using an instant adhesive. Retinal pieces should be located at the top of the 10 mm high block and oriented parallel to its surface, while the bottom is affixed to the holder.\nCover the block immediately by pouring the previously bubbled Ames' Medium into the buffer tray of the vibratome.\n6. Preparation of Horizontal Vibratome Sections",
    "Start sectioning. At first, set the thickness of slicing manually until fragments of retinal tissue appear in the slice. Then change to the settings in step 2.3. Since the mouse retina is only about 200 µm thick, there will be no more than 2 - 3 slices per agarose block.\nRemove sections from the buffer tray with a glass rod and transfer them to 2 ml Ames' Medium in a 35 mm Petri dish.\nStore sections immediately in an incubator at 37 °C (5% CO2/55% O2). The agarose surrounding the sections will stay solid in the incubator and can be used to handle the sections without damaging the retina. Better slice quality is obtained when storing at 37 °C within the respective atmosphere compared to oxygenated Ames' Medium at RT. Sections can be used immediately or can be stored up to 4 hr in the incubator with good physiological results.\nEmbed next retinal pieces in agarose and repeat Sections 4 - 6.\nSubscription Required.
