    "NOTE: The protocol illustrated uses a program that allows one to select images and then adapt them using options selected by different drop-down menus.\n1. Select the Image to Adapt\nClick on the image and browse for the filename of the image to work with. Observe the original image in the upper left pane.\n2. Specify the Stimulus and the Observer\nClick the \"format\" menu to choose how to represent the image and the observer.\nClick on the \"standard observer\" option to model a standard or average observer adapting to a specific color distribution. In this case, use standard equations to convert the RGB values of the image to the cone sensitivities32.\nClick on \"individual observer\" option to model the spectral sensitivities of a specific observer. Because these sensitivities are wavelength-dependent, the program converts the RGB values of the image into gun spectra by using the standard or measured emission spectra for the display.\nClick on \"natural spectra\" option to approximate actual spectra in the world. This option converts the RGB values to spectra, for example by using standard basis functions33 or Gaussian spectra34 to approximate the corresponding spectrum for the image color.\n3. Select the Adaptation Condition\nAdapt either the same observer to different environments (e.g., to the colors of a forest vs. urban landscape), or different observers to the same environment (e.g., a normal vs. color deficient observer).\n\t\nIn the former case, use the menus to select the environments. In the latter, use the menus to define the sensitivity of the observer.\nTo set the environments, select the \"reference\" and \"test\" environments from the dropdown menus. These control the two different states of adaptation by loading the mechanism responses for different environments.",
    "Choose the \"reference\" menu to control the starting environment. This is the environment the subject is adapted to while viewing the original image.\n\t\tNOTE: The choices shown have been precalculated for different environments. These were derived from measurements of the color gamuts for different collections of images. For example, one application examined how color perception might vary with changes in the seasons, by using calibrated images taken from the same location at different times27. Another study, exploring how adaptation might affect color percepts across different locations, represented the locations by sampling images of different scene categories29.\nSelect the \"user defined\" environment to load the values for a custom environment. Observe a window to browse and select a particular file. To create these files for independent images, display each image to be included (as in step 1) and then click the \"save image responses\" button.\n\t\tNOTE: This will display a window where one can create or append to an excel file storing the responses to each image. To create a new file, enter the filename, or browse for an existing file. For existing files, the responses to the current image are added and the responses to all images automatically averaged. These averages are input for the reference environment when the file with the \"user defined\" option is selected.\nSelect the \"test\" menu to access a list of environments for the image to be adjusted for. Select the \"current image\" option to use the mechanism responses for the displayed image.\n\t\tNOTE: This option assumes the subjects are adapting to the colors in the image that is currently being viewed. Otherwise select one of the precalculated environments or the \"user defined\" option to load the test environment.\n4. Select the Spectral Sensitivity of the Observer",
    "NOTE: For the adaptation effects of different environments, the observer will usually remain constant, and is set to the default \"standard observer\" with average spectral sensitivity. There are 3 menus for setting an individual spectral sensitivity, which control the amount of screening pigment or the spectral sensitivities of the observer.\nClick on the \"lens\" menu to select the density of the lens pigment. The different options allow one to choose the density characteristic of different ages.\nClick on the \"macular\" menu to similarly select the density of the macular pigment. Observe these options in terms of the peak density of the pigment.\nClick on the \"cones\" menu to choose between observers with normal trichromacy or different types of anomalous trichromacy.\n\tNOTE: Based on the choices the program defines the cone spectral sensitivities of the observer and a set of 26 postreceptoral channels that linearly combine the cone signals to roughly uniformly sample different color and luminance combinations.\n5. Adapt the Image\nClick the \"adapt\" button.\n\tNOTE: This executes the code for calculating the responses of the cones and post-receptoral mechanisms to each pixel in the image. The response is scaled so that the mean response to the adapting color distribution equals the mean responses to the reference distribution, or so that the average response is the same for an individual or reference observer. The scaling is multiplicative to simulate von Kries adaptation35. The new image is then rendered by summing the mechanism responses and converting back to RGB values for display. Details of the algorithm are given in 26,27,28,29.",
    "Observe three new images on the screen. These are labeled as 1) \"unadapted\" — how the test image should appear to someone fully adapted to the reference environment; 2) \"cone adaptation\"- this shows the image adjusted only for adaptation in the receptors; and 3) \"full adaptation\"- this shows the image predicted by complete adaptation to the change in the environment or the observer.\nClick the \"save images\" button to save the three calculated-images. Observe a new window on the screen to browse for the folder and select the filename.\n6. Evaluate the Consequences of the Adaptation\nNOTE: The original reference and adapted images simulate how the same image should appear under the two states of modeled adaptation, and importantly, differ only because of the adaptation state. The differences in the images thus provide insight into consequences of the adaptation.\nVisually look at the differences between the images.\n\tNOTE: Simple inspection of the images can help show how much color vision might vary when living in different color environments, or how much adaptation might compensate for a sensitivity change in the observer.\nQuantify these adaptation effects by using analyses or behavioral measurements with the images to empirically evaluate the consequences of the adaptation29.\n\t\nMeasure how color appearance changes. For example, compare the colors in the two images to measure how color categories or perceptual salience shift across different environments or observers. For example, use analyses of the changes in color with adaptation to calculate how much the unique hues (e.g., pure yellow or blue) could theoretically vary because of variations in the observer's color environment29.",
    "Ask how the adaptation affects visual sensitivity or performance. For example, use the adapted images to compare whether visual search for a novel color is faster when observers are first adapted to the colors of the background. Conduct the experiment by superimposing on the images an array of targets and differently-colored distractors that were adapted along with the images, with the reaction times measured for locating the odd target29.\nSubscription Required.
