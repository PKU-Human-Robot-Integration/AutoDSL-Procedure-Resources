For example, in 3 mL of PBS on a 6-cm dish, the spleen is disrupted between two microscope slides (S9215, Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan).\nSplenocytes are filtered through 40-μm filters (Falcon; Corning, NY, USA).\nCount the cells after washing twice with PBS.\nPreparation of target cells to induce effector cells. B16-F1 cells treated with IFN-γ for 48 h are washed with PBS, dispersed in 0.25% trypsin at 37°C for 3 min, and resuspended in fresh culture medium. After centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, the cell pellet is resuspended in PBS and washed twice.\nB16-F1 cells are resuspended in fresh culture media and counted.\nApproximately 4 × 107 splenocytes and 2 × 106 IFN-γ-treated B16-F1 cells are cocultured in 20 mL of fresh culture media in a 15-cm dish and incubated for 5 days.\nNote: The proliferation of B16-F1 cells requires high glucose concentrations. Therefore, the same medium (D-MEM [high glucose] containing 10% FBS and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic) is used in this protocol. The medium may be changed to one suitable for splenocytes at this step; however, we did not reproduce the results using another medium.\nIFN-γ treatment of target cells—Day 2\nTiming: 1 h",
    "B16-F1 cells are treated with IFN-γ (100 U/mL).\nWhen the culture reaches 30%–50% confluence, the medium is replaced with 100 U/mL IFN-γ in D-MEM.\nCells are incubated for 48 h.\nConfiguration of the xCELLigence system and seeding target cells—Day 4\nTiming: 3 h\nWarm the medium in a 37°C water bath 30 min before starting the experiment.\nOpen the RTCA Software Light (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) application and set the schedule of the xCELLigence S16 as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1385_1.csv\nAlternatives: There are several xCELLigence models depending on the required throughput. For example, the maximum throughput of S16 is 16 wells; however, those of DP, SP, and MP are 48, 96, and 576 wells, respectively. The cytotoxicity assay can be performed using these models.\nPreparing the E-Plate 16 utilized for the xCELLigence S16. Conducting background measurements (step 1).\nTransfer 50 μL of warm medium to all wells.\nPlace the E-Plate 16 into the xCELLigence S16 station.\nStart step 1 (1 min and 1 sweep) to measure background.\nRemove the E-Plate 16 from the station.\nAlternatives: While the xCELLigence S16 model employs RTCA Software Light, the DP, SP, and MP models employ RTCA Software, which calculates %Cytolysis. Furthermore, depending on the model, the type of E-plate can be changed (16 or 96 wells).\nAdd target cells to the E-Plate 16 plate.\nB16-F1 cells treated with IFN-γ for 48 h are washed with PBS, dispersed in 0.25% trypsin at 37°C for 3 min, and resuspended in fresh culture medium. After centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, the cell pellet is resuspended in PBS and washed twice.\nCells are resuspended in fresh culture media and counted.",
    "Add the cell suspension (0.5–2 × 104 in 100 μL of culture medium) to each well of the E-Plate 16 (150 μL of total media; cell numbers can be modified depending on the experiment).\nNote: We found that this protocol requires 2.5 × 103–4 × 104 target cells/well.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1385_2.csv\nEquilibrate the E-Plate at 15°C–25°C for 30 min to allow the cells to settle to the bottom of the well.\nIncubate the E-Plate at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for approximately 18–36 h.\nPlace the E-Plate 16 in the station in a 37°C incubator.\nStart Step 2 of RTCA Software Light and incubate to allow cell attachment and proliferation, monitor impedance for 25 h (15 min × 100 sweeps), and take readings every 15 min.\nNote: Set the read time to exceed the expected experimental time.\nCell growth is dynamically monitored until cells reach the exponential growth phase and form a monolayer (approximately 18–36 h).\nCritical: When the target cells approach 100% confluence, the cell index value plateaus, which can cause cell death. Therefore, the effector cells should be added before this occurs.\nOptional: To assess the effects of reagents on effector cells, one may consider the timing of such treatment at this stage. For example, we treat effector cells with 20 mM lactate for 24 h before performing the next step to assess the effect of lactate on the effector cells (Kanemaru et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). As shown step 12a, after collecting floating effector cells in the cocultures, effector cells are incubated in medium with or without 20 mM lactate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a 15-cm dish. After 24 h, collect and count effector cells and proceed to step 12b.\nAddition of effector cells—Day 5\nTiming: 2 h",
    "Add effector cells to individual wells containing the target cells at different ratios (Effector:Target ratios = 12.5:1, 25:1, and 50:1).\nGently collect floating effector cells in the cocultures. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min and then count the cells.\nCritical: Please do not use trypsin or collect attached cells, which mainly represent target cells. Use a pipet to gently collect the floating cells (effectors).\nUse 2.5 × 105, 5 × 105, and 1 × 106 effector cells in 100 μL of medium to prepare suspensions with Effector:Target ratios = 12.5:1, 25:1, and 50:1, respectively.\nAlternatives: The Effector:Target ratios can be modified, e.g. 6.25:1 or 100:1.\nClick the “abort current step” button of the RTCA Software Light to stop step 2 (monitoring target cells).\nRemove the E-Plate 16 from the station. Using a multichannel pipet, remove 100 μL of medium from each well.\nNote: Please ensure that the tip does not touch the bottom of the well and avoid detaching target cells.\nAdd 100 μL (final volume, 150 μL/well) of effector cells prepared in (b) directly to the wells. For background controls that contain only target cells, add 100 μL of fresh medium to each well (final volume, 150 μL/well) (see “example E-plate layout”). For example, in this layout, lanes A and B serve as background controls that contain only target cells.\nFor background controls that only contain effector cells, effector cells are added to wells that do not contain target cells (see “example E-plate layout”). For example, in this layout, lanes C–E are used as such background controls that contain only effector cells.\nEquilibrate the E-Plate at 15°C–25°C for 30 min to allow the cells to settle to the bottom.\nReturn the E-Plate 16 to the station and click the “Start/Continue” button in the software.",
    "The system will automatically continue to take measurements every 15 min (500 sweeps, 125 h). Cell index values are recorded by RTCA Software Light at 15-min intervals.\nNote: If you use ≥2 reagents to assess their effect, more controls with or without respective reagents should be considered."
