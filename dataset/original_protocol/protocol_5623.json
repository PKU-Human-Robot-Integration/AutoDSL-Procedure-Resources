    "Choosing the appropriate combination of type II and type IIS restriction endonucleasesChoose the gene of interest (GOI). For example, we recently focused on adding different tags to THSD1, a single-span transmembrane protein.Determine the tags to be inserted. We applied 11 different tags to THSD1 (Table 1). Table 1. Information of 11 tags used for THSD1. Information on the amino acids of the tags smaller than 150 bp is shown here, and the addgene number for each tag larger than 150 bp is referenced. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131191554_4364.jpgFind type II restriction enzymes that are absent for the GOI and the tags to be inserted. For simplicity, we term them as ‘non-cutters’ hereafter. For human THSD1 (accession number: NM_018676), some non-cutters are available such as BamHI, ClaI, EcoRI, EcoRV, NheI, SalI, XbaI, XhoI, etc. Since the sequences of the tags are custom designed, alternative codon usage can be potentially used to remove the restriction site. Design the appropriate combination of the identified non-cutters based on pBS-KSII-4B and your destination vector. pBS-KSII-4B is a modified vector for precision tagging (Xu et al., 2017) and it shares the identical multiple cloning site with the widely-used cloning vector pBS-KSII (accession number: X52327). To express tagged THSD1 in mammalian cells, we chose two different destination vectors including pCMV5 and pBabe-puro for transient or stable protein expression, respectively. Accordingly, BamHI, SalI and EcoRI were selected since BamHI/SalI can transfer the insert into pCMV5 while BamHI/EcoRI does the same for pBabe-puro.Subclone the GOI into pBS-KSII-4B vector using selected non-cutters (Figures 1A to 1B). We termed this new construct as ‘entry clone’ and labeled it as pBS-KSII-4B-GOI. Using regular PCR, we added a BamHI site at the N-terminus, and a sequential SalI-EcoRI site at the C-terminus of THSD1 in pBS-KSII-4B. Therefore, tagged THSD1 in pBS-KSII-4B can work for both pCMV5 and pBabe-puro.",
    "If more destination vectors are needed, we may consider readjusting their sequence order of multiple cloning sites to be compatible with pBS-KSII-4B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131191810_5556.jpgFigure 1. Overview of the workflow for precision tagging by combinational use of type II and type IIS restriction endonucleases. A-E. GOI in different stages is specified in the precision tagging workflow. Type IIS DNA cassette in the GOI is highlighted in the red box. Type IIS restriction endonucleases are used between (C) and (D) and emphasized in blue frame. GOI is the abbreviation of ‘Gene of Interest’.Determine the position of the tag of interest. In our case, we inserted the tag right after the signal peptide of THSD1 (Figure 2A). In general, tags can be placed before the N-terminal or after the C-terminal of a full-length protein. For a transmembrane protein, tags have to be inserted after the signal peptide if the N-terminal tagging is needed, since they will be cleaved upon entering the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. In particular, THSD1 is a type I transmembrane protein, and its N-terminal region will be located outside the cytoplasmic membrane. To avoid any potential interference with THSD1 intracellular signaling transduction, we decided to tag its extracellular domain corresponding to its N-terminal region. Find a single-cut type II restriction endonuclease that is close to the position of the tag of interest. Henceforth, we will refer to this as a ‘unique cutter’. Check whether the unique cutter is absent for both the tags and pBS-KSII-4B. For THSD1, we chose Bsu36I that is 455 bp away from the tag position (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131191856_6915.jpgFigure 2. Schematic of making a template clone from an entry clone of THSD1. A-B.",
    "The signal peptide of THSD1 is highlighted in the light blue box while the rest in the orange box containing a green box with the labeled transmembrane domain (TM). BamHI and Bsu36I were selected to replace the original fragment in (A) with the template fragment containing BsaI DNA cassette (highlighted in red box) in (B).Note that four type IIS restriction endonucleases, including BsaI, BbsI, BsmBI, and BfuAI, are absent for pBS-KSII-4B. All of them cleave DNA outside its non-palindromic recognition sequences, and more product information is available on the New England Biolabs’ website.Check which type IIS restriction endonuclease is absent for the GOI or the tag. For example, BsaI is absent for THSD1, and different type IIS enzymes may be selected for different tags. In our case, we applied 11 tags (Table 1) and used BsaI, BbsI, and BsmBI, accordingly. Choose a type IIS DNA cassette. Four type IIS restriction endonuclease-mediated DNA cassettes containing detailed nucleotide information are shown in Figure 3. For THSD1, we chose a BsaI DNA cassette.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131192025_8673.jpgFigure 3. Four kinds of type IIS DNA cassettes for pBS-KSII-4B. (A) BsaI (B) BsmB1 (C) BbsI (D) BfuA1 recognized sequences are indicated in the braces. The cutting positions for them are indicated at both ends of the DNA cassette or the bottom panel.Record the DNA sequence after inserting the selected type IIS DNA cassette into the tag position of the GOI. Word, Vector NTI, DNAstar, or other DNA sequence analysis software is helpful. We named the sequence that contains the type IIS DNA cassette from one end to the site of unique cutter in the GOI as ‘template fragment’.Construction of a template clone by type II restriction endonucleasesPerform overlapping PCR to make a template fragment.",
    "For THSD1, we performed the following experiment as indicated in Figure 4 and Recipe 1 using Thermo Cycler.Order two oligos (BamHI-THSD1-F and Bsu36I-THSD1-R) that match both ends of the template fragment, with additional type II restriction enzymes such as BamHI or Bsu36I.Two internal overlapping oligos contain 18-24 nt of the left (light blue box) and right side (orange box) of the type IIS DNA cassette (red box), which is in total around 54-68 nt (BsaI-OL-F and BsaI-OL-R). The sequence information for above oligos is listed in Table 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131192343_0312.jpgFigure 4. Schematic of making a template fragment of THSD1 from overlapping PCR. Detailed information for the oligos is provided in Table 2. BamHI was added to the forward primer for NT-fragment PCR. Overlapping PCR contains part of a signal peptide (highlighted in the light blue box), BsaI DNA cassette (selected from Figure 2, highlighted in the red box), and part of THSD1 coding sequence (highlighted in the orange box). Bsu36I is in the middle of the reserve primer for CT fragment PCR. The detailed information of the final PCR product is indicated in the region of the template clone between two black lines.Table 2. Information of overlapping PCR. BsaI DNA cassette is highlighted in red letters. BamHI and Bsu36I cutting sites are italicized. Nucleotides are colored according to Figure. OL is short for ‘over-lapping’.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131192454_4211.jpgRun the PCR product on a gel using the Mupid-exU DNA electrophoresis system, and check the size of amplified NT and CT fragment followed by gel purification (QIAquick gel extraction kit). Purify the DNA band of interest using QIAquick gel extraction kit (melt the gel in a 55 °C heat block). Next, perform overlapping PCR by mixing NT and CT fragment as indicated in Recipe 1 and gel purify the template fragment of correct size in the same way.",
    "Alternatively, order the template fragment from Integrated DNA Technology (IDT) or other companies that provide similar services involving large DNA fragment synthesis. We ordered it with additional BamHI at the N-terminus, Bsu36I at the C-terminus, and BsaI DNA cassette right after the signal peptide of THSD1. Use the type II restriction endonucleases to digest the template fragment obtained either from overlapping PCR or the commercial gene synthesis. For THSD1, digest both fragments with BamHI and Bsu36I for 2 h at 37 °C using a water bath (Recipe 2 for enzymatic digestion). Linearize pBS-KSII-4B-GOI with the same restriction endonucleases that are used for the template fragment, followed by calf intestinal phosphatase treatment (Recipe 3 for vector linearization). For example, we linearized pBS-KSII-4B-THSD1 with BamHI and Bsu36I.Ligate the digested template fragment with linearized pBS-KSII-4B-GOI (Recipe 4 for DNA ligation). Accordingly, we joined the template fragment with the above linearized pBS-KSII-4B-THSD1 (Figure 2).Transform DH5α competent cells with the ligation product and spread them on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin (Recipe 5 for DNA transformation). Incubate the plates at 37 °C air incubator overnight. Pick up several colonies on each plate and inoculate them separately into a clean tube containing 2-5 ml LB medium with 100 µg/ml ampicillin.Grow the bacteria in an orbital shaker with a shaking speed of 220 rpm at 37 °C overnight.Extract the plasmids from the overnight cultures using QIAprep spin miniprep kit.Confirm the correct clones by restriction analysis and Sanger sequencing.Construction of a tag clone by type IIS restriction endonucleasesDefine the tag sequence using DNA analysis software, such as Word or DNAstar.For the tags that are smaller than 150 bp, such as HA, Myc or FLAG, order two annealing oligos as indicated in Figure 5A.",
    "So far, a 200 bp long oligo is the maximum length that can be provided commercially, and that is why 150 bp was chosen as an arbitrary cutoff. It still leaves extra spaces for adding gene-specific DNA sequences at both ends. For the tags that are larger than 150 bp, such as GFP, miniSOG, or SNAPf, order two amplifying oligos with type IIS restriction endonuclease sequences at both ends as indicated in Figure 5B. To amplify these tags, perform PCRs under the same condition for each tag by following a standard protocol: table:",

    "Initial denaturation: 98 °C 30 sec; 28 cycles: 98 °C 10 sec, 60 °C 15 sec, 72 °C 1 min; final extension: 72 °C 5 min. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131193158_4215.jpgFigure 5. Generation of the tag fragment with custom sticky ends. A. The sense annealing oligo (annealing oligo-S) is composed of 5’-AGCT (letters in red) and tag-specific sequence (letters in blue); the anti-sense annealing oligo (annealing oligo-AS) is composed of 5’-ATTC (letters in green) and tag-specific sequence (letters in blue), as shown in the right table. B. Both amplifying oligos contain a BsaI recognition site (letters in black), THSD1-specific sticky end (letters in red or green), and tag-specific sequences (letters in blue), as detailed on the right table.Following Step C2, oligos are annealed and phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Following Step C3, amplified PCR products are digested by type IIS enzymes for 2 h at 37 °C (Recipe 2).Linearize the template clone of pBS-KSII-4B-GOI containing type IIS DNA cassette by the predesigned type IIS restriction endonucleases. For example, pBS-KSII-4B-THSD1 containing BsaI cassette is digested by BsaI for 2 h at 37 °C, and dephosphorylated by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Recipe 2 and Figures 6A-6B).Ligate the tag fragments with two sticky ends that are generated at Step C4 or Step C5, into the linearized template clone from Step C6 (Figures 6B-6C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131193306_2126.jpgFigure 6. Schematic of making a tag clone from a template clone of THSD1. A-B. The template clone contains two THSD1-specific sticky ends (letters in red or green). C. All above tags containing a THSD1-specific sticky end and 5’-phosphorylation are joined with the linearized template clone by T4 DNA ligase, thus generating a seamless tag clone.Transform DH5α competent cells with the ligation product and spread them on LB agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin (Recipe 5 for DNA transformation).",

Construction of a destination clone by type II restriction endonucleasesLinearize your destination vector with the preselected type II restriction enzymes from Procedure A. For instance, we linearized pCMV5 with BamHI and SalI, or pBabe-puro with BamHI and EcoRI (Recipe 3).Cut your tagged GOI from previous tag clones in Procedure C with the same enzymes, followed by running agarose gel electrophoresis and extracting DNA band of correct size from the gel. For pBS-KSII-4B-THSD1 with different tags, we cut tagged THSD1 by either BamH/SalI or BamHI/EcoRI, and recovered the DNA band of correct size by gel purification (QIAquick gel extraction kit).Ligate the tagged GOI with the linearized destination vector by compatible sticky ends. In Figure 6, how tagged THSD1 are transferred from the tag clone into the destination clone like pCMV5 are shown (Figure 7). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180131/20180131193446_8944.jpgFigure 7.
