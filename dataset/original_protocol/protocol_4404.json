    "Euthanize the mice by injecting 0.5 ml of avertin intraperitoneally with a 25 Gauge needle. The mice become unresponsive after 1-2 min.  Note: Verify the institution approved ethical regulations on animal welfare if other euthanization methods are in place.   Check the absence of cerebrospinal reflexes by pinching the paw of the posterior limbs with a forceps.   After spraying the animal with 70% ethanol, open the right flank and remove the spleen. Remove any fatty tissue that is connected with the spleen and place the organ in 15 ml tube with 5 ml of ice-cold HBSS.   Bring the spleen to a 35 mm Petri dish and mince the organ into pieces by using the scissors. To obtain a good dissociation of the tissue, proceed until no pieces are visible with the bare eyes.   Add 1 ml of ice-cold RPMI, bring the cell suspension to a 15 ml Falcon tube and put on ice. Complete all other organs before adding the digestion medium.   Add 1 ml of 37 °C preheated 2x digestion medium to the cell suspension and bring all organs to the 37 °C warm water bath. Make sure the shaker is put to its maximum setting.  Note: Shaking the sample will allow more efficient digestion of the tissue by decreasing its precipitation.   Incubate the cell suspension for 15 min and dissociate the cell suspension by pipetting the solution up and down through a Pasteur pipette.   Repeat step 7 once more.   Add 10 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down cell suspension at 400 x g 7 min 4 °C.   Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 ml of ice-cold osmotic lysis buffer. Incubate for 4’ at room temperature and subsequently add 10 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer.",
    "Spin down cell suspension at 400 x g 7 min 4 °C.   Resuspend cells in 10 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and filter through a 100 μm cell strainer. One can reuse the 15 ml tube to collect the filtered cells. Take a 20 μl counting sample and spin down rest of cell suspension at 400 x g 7 min 4 °C.   Add 180 μl of trypan blue to the 20 μl of counting sample and mix well. Count cells. After digestion, 1 spleen will normally contain up to 60-100 x106 cells.    Remove supernatant from cell pellet and resuspend in antibody mix I at a concentration of 50 x 106 cells per 1 ml of mix (see table 1). Stain 20 min on ice in the dark. Add 10 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400 x g 4 °C.  Table 1. Antibody mix I in MACS buffer table:",

Add 5-10 μl/10 x 106 cells of anti-FITC microbeads. Resuspend and incubate 15 min on ice. Add 10 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400 x g 4 °C. Discard supernatant.   Prepare LD columns according to manufacturer’s protocol.   After preparation, place a 15 ml tube on ice under the LD column.   Resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and filter through a 100 μm cell strainer on the LD column.  Note: This minimizes the probability of cell clots obstructing the LD column. After the 1 ml of cell suspension has run through, wash 2 times with 2 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer. Make sure that cell suspension runs through each time. Discard the column and spin down the effluent (7 min 400 x g 4 °C). Aspirate the supernatant.   Stain cell pellet in 500 μl of antibody mix II. Stain 20 min on ice in the dark. Add 10 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer and spin down 7 min 400 x g 4 °C. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml of ice-cold MACS buffer. Bring the cell suspension to a 5 ml polystyrene tube with a cell strainer cap to remove possible clots.  Table 2.

    "Note: Use of PBS is necessary for optimal staining of dead cells with the Fixable viability dye eFluor 506.    Single stains are prepared by diluting 1 drop of Ultra comp eBeads in 2 ml of PBS. Make sure to shake the beads thoroughly before use as precipitation occurs. Bring 200 μl of this bead suspension to seven 5 ml reaction tubes (6 fluorochromes + 1 unstained sample). Antibodies conjugated to bright fluorochomes (PE-eFluor610, Pe-Cy5, AF-647) are diluted 1/2,000, other antibodies are diluted 1/400. Stain 15 min on ice in the dark. Add 1 ml of PBS and spin down 7 min 400 x g 4 °C. Remove supernatant and resuspend beads in 200 μl of PBS. Proceed to the cell sorter.  Note: Viability dyes do not bind to the Ultra comp eBeads. Since we exclude dead cells (defined by a positive staining for eFluor 506) there is no need to compensate this fluorochrome. If compensation is preferred, cells can be stained with a 1 in 200 dilution of the eFluor 506 viability dye in PBS. Stain 20 min on ice in the dark. Wash cells with 1ml of PBS and spin down 7 min 400 x g 4 °C. Resuspend the cells in 200 μl of PBS.   An example of a gating setup is shown below.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150302/20150302184743_1188.jpg Figure 1. Gating strategy of splenic DCs. A strict gating strategy in the FSC-H/FSC-A plot allows the exclusion of doublets. The CD11b+ DCs (Lin- CD11c+ MHCII+ CD11b+ cells) contain a fraction of monocyte derived cells (specific infections with pathogens or inflammation can drastically increase this cell population, contaminating the CD11b+ DC gate). The conventional CD11b+ DCs can be identified by exclusion of the CD64+ cells."
