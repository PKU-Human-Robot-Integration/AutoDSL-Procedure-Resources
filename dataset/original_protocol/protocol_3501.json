An alternative to substitute CMF-BSS buffer is to use 1× PBS (phosphate saline buffer) composed by 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mM KH2PO4.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_421_4.csv\nCell labeling\nTiming: 2 days\nAt this step, melanoma cells will be subcultured in glass dishes for Fura-2 AM labeling and Ca2+ measurement by fluorescence microscopy. After routine cell subculture including cell counting described above (item 9), cells were plated in special glass dishes for microscopy (CELLview cell culture dish, 35/10 mm, 0.17 mm thin cover glass bottom, 1 compartment, TC, sterile, Greiner Bio-One, Germany).\nPreparation of glass bottom dishes\nConsidering that each glass dish has a diameter of 35 mm (radius r = 17.5 mm, area 96.21 cm2), then each dish should contain 6 × 106 cells.\nPlate the cells in the dishes with 3.0 mL of supplemented DMEM high glucose medium.\nReturn the dishes to the cell incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and allow them to adhere for 24 h.\nCell labeling\nAfter cell adhesion, transfer the dishes from the CO2 incubator to the laminar flow cabinet.\nBefore starting, check cell morphology (adherent, polygonal), confluence (70%–80%), and possible microbiological contaminants by optical microscopy.\nWash the cells twice with 1.0 mL HBBS and after add 1.0 mL HBBS.\nFor dye loading, pipette 2.0 μL of the stock solution of Fura 2-AM (item 7a) to reach 2.0 μM of final concentration and incubate in the dark for 30 min at 25°C (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).",
    "After this, wash the cells twice again to remove unloaded dye with 1.0 mL HBSS and add 1.0 mL HBBS.\nGo to the microscopy room with the glass dishes protected from light by aluminum foil.\nCritical: Usually, fluorescent dyes are photosensitive and can be degraded and have their ability to emit fluorescence lost when exposed to light. Thus, always keep the microtubes containing the dyes and the glass bottom dishes with labeled cells protected with aluminum foil. Also, considering it is a “live” experiment, it is recommended to stain one dish at a time and keep the others in the CO2 incubator to be stained gradually as needed.\nRatiometric fluorescent Ca2+ measurement\nTiming: 30 min per assay/dish",
    "Ratiometric dyes are fluorochromes that shift their fluorescence emission or excitation spectra due to the analyte binding. The main advantages of using ratiometric methods are the artifact corrections during the measurement due to variations of the lamp intensity, focus alterations, and dye bleaching. However, the first difficulty to doing these types of experiments lies in the availability of the apparatus able to excite or to capture the emission in two wavelengths at the same time. Specifically regarding Ca2+ measurements, Fura 2-AM is a cell permeant dye that presents dual excitation, i.e., it needs to be excited at 340 and 380 nm simultaneously and the fluorescence emission acquired at 502–538 nm range. The conjugation of the dye to acetoxymethyl ester (AM) increases its cell permeant properties and improves the cell loading (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]). Thus, once cells are plated and stained as described, a Leica AF6000 Fluorescence Image System (Leica Microsystems, Germany), which was set up to conduct the ratiometric Ca2+ measurements in live cells, was used. As presented in the Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], this system comprises a microscope Leica DMI6000B coupled to an ultrafast high sensitive 1.4 MP monochromatic digital DCF 365 FX camera, with a pixel resolution of 6.45 × 6.45 μm, automatically controlled by the Leica Application Suite (LAS v3.0) software. Although this camera reaches a maximum rate of 21 frames per second, for the experiment presented here it was set to capture one frame at each 5 s. An acrylic environmental chamber was used to maintain the temperature at 37°C during the experiment through the heat unit Tempcontrol 37-2 digital (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Additionally, the internal filter cubes covering the entire spectra from blue to red emission, this apparatus is equipped with an external filter wheel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.",
    "org#fig2]A) to allow the excitation at 340 and 387 nm. The light source used was a Hg lamp HXP R120W/45C VIS (Osram, Brazil) and the images were acquired using an HCX PL Fluotar L 20×/0.40 dry objective (Leica Microsystems, Germany). All functions are controlled by the LAS software, whose commands for set up are very intuitive as observed in the Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.",

Also, the emission filter cube for Fura 2 must be selected with a dichroic mirror at 409 nm and emission band pass of 502–538 nm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nIn the “Quantify” tab in LAS software (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) the calculator “Calcium Imaging” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) must be selected and a ratio formula will appear.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/421-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "The ratiometric calculation should be channel 1 (340 nm)/channel 2 (387 nm) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nThe fluorescence background can be corrected in this window and also the relative ratio 340/387 nm can be turned into absolute Ca2+ concentrations by using the Grynkiewicz equation (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), which is a pre-existing feature in the software, but minimum and maximal fluorescence must be achieved. However, an alternative to quantification of relative ratios under different stimuli, the area under the curve (AUC) can be calculated using this tool in the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA).\nPosition the glass bottom dish containing the labeled cells and find the focus in the bright field.\nAdjust the fluorescence emission by controlling the exposure and gain using the saturation indicator.\nSet the time course and read interval. We commonly use a reading of 20 min every each 5 s for melanoma cells under thapsigargin challenge (Esteves et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). However, the time course of a given experiment depends on the stimuli used (drugs, inhibitors, activators, protein silencing, comparison among different cell lines, etc.) and it must be established during the experimental standardization. An example of an experimental set showing the individual fluorescence in each channel (panel A) and the fluorescence emission intensity graphs (panel B) is presented in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/421-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "The drugs/challenges are pipetted directly into the dishes during the measurements and the changes are recorded at real time.\nCritical: The fluorescence excitation of red pseudo color (channel 1, 340 nm) must be adjusted by changing the exposure and gain to the lowest possible value, since the Ca2+ binding will result in fluorescence increase. The fluorescence excitation of green pseudo color (channel 2, 387 nm) must be adjusted by changing the exposure and gain to the highest possible value without saturation, since the Ca2+ binding will result in fluorescence decrease. For the addition of drugs or modulators during the recording, the stock solution must be diluted in HBSS medium to a given concentration that results in a drop right on top of the excitation light (minimum 25 μL)"
