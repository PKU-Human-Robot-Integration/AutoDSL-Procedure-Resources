    "All the procedures involving human primacy cells and retroviral vectors were performed in compliance with North Carolina State University's Biological Safety guidelines and approved by the Environmental Health and Safety Office. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purchased as buffy coats from commercial sources. Primary human cells must be isolated from human buffy coat fractions and require Biosafety Level 2 clearance and detailed standard operating procedures and approval from the institution where the work is to take place. Viral vectors, including the retroviral vector supernatants used for the transduction prepared as previously described19, can be classified either as Biosafety Level 1 or Biosafety Level 2 depending on the encoded protein and require approval from the relevant institutional biosafety committee.\n1. Making the macroporous alginate scaffolds\nPrepare a stock solution of 0.4% (weight per volume) calcium D gluconate by adding sterile-filtered deionized water to calcium D gluconate in a beaker. Stir on medium speed until the calcium gluconate has dissolved (~1.5 h), sterile-filter, and store at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: It is not necessary to check the pH of the solution.\nPrepare a solution of 2% (weight per volume) alginate in a screw cap vial or beaker. Carefully add the ultrapure alginate to the vessel and add sterile-filtered deionized water to the alginate. Choose the largest stir bar possible that will not impede mixing and add it to the vessel.\n\tNOTE: Information on the type of ultrapure alginate used for this protocol can be found in the Table of Materials and on the Novamatrix website20. Different alginates were not explored for these scaffolds, as they can lead to undesired changes in porosity and biocompatibility of the scaffolds9,10,11.",
    "Stir the solution on high speed until the alginate dissolves (~1 h). If there are large clumps on the sides of the vessel, tilt the vessel to dislodge them. Small amounts of alginate on the sides will dissolve while stirring and are not cause for concern.\n\tNOTE: It is not necessary to check the pH of the solution.\nWhen the alginate dissolves, reduce the stirring speed, slowly add an equal volume of 0.4% calcium D gluconate to the alginate solution to prevent crosslinking clumps from forming, and stir vigorously for 15 min.\nTilt the beaker or vial sideways to remove any clumps that may have formed.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to use a homogenizer. The final solution should be optically clear.\nPipette the desired volume of the solution into each well of a 48-well plate or 24-well plate. Use 300 µL/well for a 48-well plate and 1 mL/well for a 24-well plate. Cast slowly and change tips frequently, as the solution will be viscous and will stick to the tip.\nCover the plates with lids and freeze overnight at -20 ˚C.\nPrepare the plate for the lyophilizer by removing the lid and securing the top with wipes and rubber bands. Place the plates in 750 mL to 2,000 mL lyophilizer flasks, and place on the lyophilizer for 72 h.\nAfter 72 h, remove the plate from the lyophilizer and replace the lid. Seal the plate and store at 4 ˚C. For long term storage, vacuum-seal the plate before storing at 4 ˚C. Keep dry until needed.",
    "​NOTE: Make extra calcium-alginate solution due to volume error (some sticks to the walls of the vial, pipette tips). For example, to make four scaffolds in a 24-well plate, 4 mL of combined solution (2 mL alginate + 2 mL calcium D gluconate) is required, but it is recommended to prepare 2.5 mL of 2% alginate solution and 2.5 mL of 0.4% calcium D gluconate solution.\n2. Transduction\nConcentration of viral supernatant using 100 kDa filters\n\t\nHydrate the centrifugal filter for 2 min with 1 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Discard the PBS.\nConcentrate the viral suspension by adding 2 mL of viral suspension (1 × 106 TU/mL) and centrifuging it through the centrifugal filter at 1,500 × g for 10 min in a swinging bucket rotor.\n\t\tNOTE: One to two hundred microliters of concentrated virus is needed per scaffold.\nSpin for a few additional minutes if the concentrated virus suspension volume is greater than 200 µL.\nRepeat steps 2.1.1-2.1.3 for each scaffold.\n\t\tNOTE: It is also acceptable to concentrate a large stock of virus and take 100-200 µL aliquots from the concentrated stock.\nSeed activated cells and virus together.\n\t\nFor each scaffold, prepare an aliquot by suspending 1 × 106 activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 50 µL of complete cell culture media (250 mL Click's media + 250 mL RPMI 1640 media + 50 mL fetal bovine serum + 5 mL glutamine substitute + 5 mL penicillin/streptomycin).\n\t\tNOTE: See Supplemental File 1 for a protocol on how to activate PBMCs.\nAdd the concentrated viral supernatant (~2 × 106 TU, MOI 2) to the cell suspension. The total volume of the cell-virus suspension should not exceed 200 µL for a 48-well scaffold or 350 µL for a 24-well scaffold.",
    "Add the cell-virus mixture dropwise to the top of the dry scaffold. For negative control experiments, use complete cell culture media in place of the concentrated virus. Add the cell suspension to the top of the dry scaffold.\nRepeat steps 2.2.1-2.2.3 for each scaffold.\nIncubate the scaffolds in a cell culture incubator at 37 ˚C for 45-60 min. Remove the scaffolds from the incubator; the scaffolds will fully absorb the solution during this time.\nTo induce proliferation, add complete cell culture media supplemented with IL-15 (5 ng/mL) and IL-7 (10 ng/mL) to each well; IL-2 can also be used. Add 500 µL to each 48-well scaffold or 1 mL to each 24-well scaffold.\nIncubate the scaffolds at 37 ˚C for 72 h. As the cells proliferate, the media will turn orange.\nIsolate cells from the scaffolds for analysis.\n\t\nDilute 0.5 M EDTA to 0.25 M EDTA in 1x PBS.\nRemove excess medium from each well and collect into separate 15 mL centrifuge tubes.\nTo isolate cells from the scaffold, add 0.25 M EDTA to each scaffold. Add 300 µL to 48-well scaffolds or 1 mL to 24-well scaffolds. Let the plate sit or gently agitate for 3-4 min.\nOnce the scaffold is mostly dissolved, pipette in and out gently inside the well. A few in-and-out pipetting steps might be necessary to fully dissolve the scaffold. If it does not dissolve in 10 min, add another 200 µL of 0.25 M EDTA.\nOnce the scaffold dissolves completely, transfer the solution to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nRepeat steps 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 for each scaffold.",
    "Wash the cells twice by adding 12 mL PBS to each centrifuge tube and centrifuging at 400 × g for 5 min. A cell pellet will form at the bottom of each tube. Aspirate the supernatant and repeat the wash. Be careful to fully aspirate the supernatant with every wash as it is crucial to remove all the EDTA.\nAfter the second wash with PBS, the cell pellet is now ready for analysis. Follow the appropriate protocol required for the analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
