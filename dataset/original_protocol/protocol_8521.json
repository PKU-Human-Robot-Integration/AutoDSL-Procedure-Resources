    "All the animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of Sapienza University of Rome-Unit of Histology and Medical Embryology and were performed in accordance with the current version of the Italian Law on the Protection of Animals.\n1. Experimental set-up\nSet-up the experimental system composed of 1 actuator/transducer, 2 stimulators, 1 in-vitro muscle apparatus, 1 preparatory tissue bath, 1 suction electrode, 1 digital oscilloscope, 1 stereomicroscope, 1 cold light illuminator, 1 acquisition board, 1 connector block and a personal computer.\n\tNOTE: Here the command software was programmed in LabView and was designed to guarantee high flexibility, accuracy, and repeatability of the stimulations. For each stimulation, the user can select the pulse width, frequency, duration, and decide whether it is delivered to the membrane or through the nerve. The user can also select the length of the rest period before each stimulation.\n2. Evaluations of the NMJ contractile properties of soleus and diaphragm muscles\nSystem warm-up\nPrepare the Krebs Ringer buffer14 and place it in a bath of the mounting apparatus and the preparatory tissue bath. Place a 60 mm dish prepared with 4 ml of silicon in the preparatory tissue bath.\nTurn on the circulating water bath and set the temperature to 30 °C for the soleus muscle and to 27 °C for the diaphragm muscle.\nAllow 95% O2 - 5% CO2 mixture to flow into both the baths.\nTurn on the actuator/transducer and the two pulse stimulators and set the current values to 300 mA for membrane stimulation and to 5 mA for nerve stimulation.",
    "NOTE: The 300 mA current value has previously been shown not to induce any significant contraction on the nerve branches when D-tubocurarine is added to the solution15. The 5 mA current value corresponds to the amount of current required to stimulate the muscle through the nerve without creating an overlap with the membrane stimulation induced by means of the solution. Since the distance between the suction electrode and the muscle is dependent on the nerve length, this current value must be carefully adjusted before each experiment, as described below.\nSoleus and diaphragm dissection\nSacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation to minimize suffering, and immediately excise the muscles for testing as follows.\nSoleus-sciatic preparation, dissection, and set-up\nSpray 70% ethanol on the mouse leg and remove the skin covering the leg. Make an incision in the upper part of the leg with a pair of scissors and then pull the skin firmly. Isolate the Achilles' tendon from the tibia and then cut the Achilles' tendon with a pair of scissors.\nTightly clamp the tendon with a pair of forceps and gently pull the gastrocnemius muscle together with the soleus. Once the proximal tendon of the soleus is exposed, cut the entire calf with a pair of scissors while still holding the Achilles' tendon. Immediately place the tissue sample in the preparatory tissue bath.\nPlace the preparatory bath under the stereomicroscope and fix the calf to the silicon dish using 0.20 mm diameter stainless steel pins. Using a pair of forceps clamp the proximal tendon of the soleus and gently pull it to expose the sciatic innervation.",
    "Once the innervation is exposed (Figure 1), carefully remove the surrounding tissue to expose about 5 mm of the nerve. Use a fine pair of scissors to cut the nerve. While tightly clamping the soleus on the proximal tendon with a pair of forceps, pull it again and excise it by cutting the Achilles' tendon with a pair of scissors.\nPass a nylon wire through the hole of the lever arm of the actuator/transducer. Create a noose at the end of the wire and grasp the Achilles' tendon before pulling the wire back until the muscle reaches the bath of the mounting apparatus. Clamp the proximal tendon within the fixed clamp and tie the nylon wire around the lever arm. Allow the muscle to equilibrate in the solution.\nDetermine the initial optimal length (L0).\n\t\t\t\nFirst, stretch the muscle to preload it at 10 mN (this value guarantees the maximum twitch force (based on experience)). Then, gently stretch the muscle to change the preload and stimulate it with a series of single pulses. The optimal length is achieved when the maximum twitch force is measured.\nDiaphragm-phrenic preparation, dissection, and set-up\nSpray 70% ethanol on the mouse skin. Remove the skin covering the diaphragm muscle by making an incision over the sternum with a pair of scissors and by pulling the skin firmly.\nWith a pair of scissors, cut the abdomen horizontally below the sternum and gently remove the intestine and the organs with a pair of forceps. Use a pair of thick scissors to cut the spine.\nCut the ribs about 1 cm over the sternum and proceed horizontally. Gently remove the outer organs with a pair of forceps and cut the spine to obtain a circular ring of ribs containing the diaphragm.",
    "Wash the preparation in a dish containing the Krebs Ringer buffer and then place it in the silicon dish inside the preparatory tissue bath, with the upper side facing up and the sternum facing forward.\nUsing the stereomicroscope, carefully remove the lungs and the remaining organs; the phrenic nerve will be visible on the right side (Figure 2A).\nTrim the ribs to leave a ring of about 2 mm all along the diaphragm.\nUsing forceps, fix one 0.20 mm diameter stainless steel pin on the diaphragm central tendon at the point corresponding to the phrenic nerve innervation, and another pin on the ribs on the same axis to identify the diaphragm strip of interest.\nFix two additional pins on the central tendon and another two pins on the ribs on either side of the selected strip to lay out the diaphragm. If necessary, clean the phrenic nerve from the surrounding connective tissue using forceps.\nUsing a curved blade, cut the diaphragm on either sides of the innervation to identify a tendon-muscle-rib strip as shown in Figure 2B.\nPass a nylon wire through the hole of the lever arm of the actuator/transducer. Create a noose at the end of the wire and grasp the tendon before pulling the wire back until the muscle reaches the bath of the mounting apparatus.\nClamp the ribs within the fixed clamp and tie the nylon wire around the lever arm.\nAllow the muscle to equilibrate in the solution and determine the initial optimal length (L0).\n\t\t\t\nStretch the muscle to preload it at 5 mN. Gently stretch the muscle to change the preload and stimulate it with a series of single pulses. The optimal length is achieved when the maximum twitch force is measured.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55227/55227fig1.jpg",

While gently increasing the current intensity (starting from 5 mA), stimulate the muscle with a series of single pulses. The optimal current value is determined when the twitch force is maximum.\nPush the nerve out of the electrode and deliver a few single pulses. Ensure that the muscle does not contract due to overlap with the membrane stimulation by means of the solution. Pull the nerve in again.\nLaunch the program and select the input file to run the desired testing protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: The input file includes all the stimulation parameters needed to run the entire protocol. Although the same protocol structure is used for the two muscles the stimulation parameters differ depending on the protocol refers to the soleus or diaphragm muscles.\n\t\t\nSoleus-sciatic nerve stimulation (see Table 1)\n\t\t\t\nUse the following pulse widths for all the electrical stimulations: 1.4 ms for sciatic nerve stimulation and 0.1 ms for direct soleus stimulation. The full protocol lasts approximately 65 min.\nDiaphragm-phrenic nerve stimulation (see Table 2)",
    "Use the following pulse widths for all the electrical stimulations: 1.8 ms for phrenic nerve stimulation and 0.2 ms for direct diaphragm stimulation. The full protocol lasts approximately 55 min.\nAt the end of the experimental protocol, measure the length and the wet weight of the muscle using an analog caliper with an 0.05 mm accuracy and a precision scale with an 0.1 mg accuracy, respectively.\n\t\t\t\nCompute the cross sectional area (CSA) by dividing the muscle mass by the product of optimal fiber length (Lf) and the density of mammalian skeletal muscle (1.06 mg/mm3)16.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Lf is obtained by multiplying L0 by the fiber length/muscle length ratio (0.71 for soleus muscle16 and 1 for the diaphragm muscle17).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5\nType of experiment,Frequency,Duration,Repetitions,Muscle or Nerve stimulation,Purpose\n,(Hz),(s),,,\nTwitch,Single pulse,,1,Muscle,Twitch force and kinetics\nRest,,30,,,Twitch force and kinetics\nTwitch,Single pulse,,1,Nerve,Twitch force and kinetics\nRest,,30,,,Twitch force and kinetics\nTwitch,Single pulse,,1,Muscle,Twitch force and kinetics\nRest,,30,,,Twitch force and kinetics\nTwitch,Single pulse,,1,Nerve,Twitch force and kinetics\nRest,,120,,,\nUnfused tetanus,40,0.8,1,Nerve,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nRest,,180,,,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nUnfused tetanus,60,0.8,1,Muscle,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nRest,,180,,,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nFused tetanus,80,0.8,1,Nerve,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nRest,,180,,,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nUnfused tetanus,20,0.8,1,Muscle,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nRest,,180,,,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nUnfused tetanus,60,0.8,1,Nerve,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nRest,,180,,,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nFused tetanus,80,0.8,1,Muscle,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nRest,,180,,,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nUnfused tetanus,20,0.8,1,Nerve,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nRest,,180,,,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nUnfused tetanus,40,0.8,1,Muscle,Force/frequency curves for nerve and muscle stimulations\nRest,,300,,,",

Data analysis\nNOTE: At the end of the protocol compute all the desired parameters as follow.\nFrom single pulse stimulation\n\t\nCompute twitch force (mN; maximum active force generated during twitch) and specific twitch force (mN/mm2). Compute it by subtracting the initial preload value to the maximum force generated by the muscle. Compute the specific twitch force as twitch force divided by the muscle CSA.\nCompute time to peak tension (TTP) (ms) as the time from pulse release to twitch force.\nCompute half relaxation time (1/2RT) (ms) as the time from twitch force to 50% of twitch force.\nCompute dF/dt (mN/ms) as the maximum value of force derivative during the contractile phase.\nCompute -dF/dt (mN/ms) as the maximum value of force derivative during the relaxing phase.\nFrom pulse train stimulations\n\t\nCompute unfused force (mN) and specific unfused force (mN/mm2). Compute it by subtracting the initial preload value to the maximum force generated by the muscle. Compute the specific unfused force as the unfused force divided by the muscle CSA.\n\t\tNOTE: The unfused force is the maximum active force generated during a pulse train with a frequency lower than the tetanic frequency.",
    "Compute tetanic force (mN) and specific tetanic force (mN/mm2); the maximum force is the maximum active force generated during a pulse train delivered at tetanic frequency. Compute it by subtracting the initial preload value to the maximum force generated by the muscle. Compute the specific tetanic force as the tetanic force divided by the muscle CSA.\nCompute force-frequency curve. Plot the value of force (or specific force) obtained for each stimulation versus the increasing frequency of stimulation. Typically, it begins with the single pulse stimulation and ends up with the tetanic frequency.\nFrom fatigue paradigms\n\t\nCalculate neurotransmission failure (NF) as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55227/55227eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere MF is the force decrease following muscle stimulation and F is the force decrease following nerve stimulation, measured on the first pulse train after muscle stimulation.\nCalculate intratetanic fatigue (IF) as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55227/55227eq2.jpg\n\t\twhere Flp is the force generated by the muscle at the last pulse of stimulation, and Fm is the maximum force generated by the muscle during the same pulse train. Regarding to the nerve stimulation, compute the intratetanic fatigue on the first pulse train immediately after the direct stimulation.\n4. Statistical analysis\nNOTE: The statistical analysis models must be chosen according to whether muscle response to both nerve and membrane stimulations is compared within the same animal model or between 2 different animal models18,19.\nUse the Student's t test for TTP, 1/2RT, dF/dt, -dF/dt if comparing only muscle responses to direct and indirect stimulations. If comparing muscle preparations obtained from 2 different mouse strains, use 2-way ANOVA with stimulation type and mouse strain as fixed factors. When the 2-way ANOVA returns a significant outcome, use multiple comparison tests to search for statistical differences.",
    "For force-frequency curve (if comparing only muscle responses to direct and indirect stimulations), use 2-way ANOVA with stimulation type and frequency of stimulation as fixed factors. Use multiple comparison tests if required.\n\t\nIf comparing muscle preparations obtained from 2 different mouse strains, use 3-way ANOVA with stimulation type, frequency of stimulation and mouse strain as fixed factors.\n\t\t\nWhen the 3-way ANOVA yields a significant effect of the factors animal strain and stimulation type, use 2-way ANOVA to identify significant differences between 2 groups at a time. For example, differences between the muscle response of the 2 groups to membrane stimulation, or between muscle response to direct and indirect stimulations within one group can be assessed.\nIntratetanic fatigue\n\tNOTE: Since the protocol was designed to induce fatigue in response to nerve stimulation even in control mice, this parameter can only be used to investigate differences between 2 mouse strains, and a statistical analysis within a single group would always yield significant differences.\n\t\nTo compare two groups, use 3-way ANOVA with stimulation type, time, and mouse strain as fixed factors. When the 3-way ANOVA yields a significant effect of the factors animal strain and stimulation type, use 2-way ANOVA to identify significant differences between 2 groups at a time, as for the force-frequency curve.\nFor neurotransmission failure, use 2-way ANOVA with animal strain and time as fixed factors. If it returns significant outcomes, use multiple comparison tests to search for statistical differences.\n\tNOTE: Since this parameter only returns one value for each mouse strain, it allows different mouse models to be compared.\nFor muscle weight, length, and CSA, use Student's t test to investigate differences when comparing muscle-nerve preparations from different animal models.\nSubscription Required.
