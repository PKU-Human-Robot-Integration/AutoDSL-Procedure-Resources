    "1. Preparation of Solutions\nPrepare fixative solution: 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x PBS. For 10 mL, take 2.5 mL of 16% PFA and add 7.5 mL of 1x PBS.\nHazards: PFA is carcinogenic at low doses. Fumes and skin contact are hazardous. Store at -20 °C.\nPrepare permeabilization solution: 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS. For 100 mL of solution, add 100 µL of Triton X-100 into 100 mL of 1x PBS. Store at room temperature (RT).\nPrepare Wash Buffer: 1x TBST. For 1 L, take 100 mL of 10x TBS, 890 mL of dH2O, and 10 mL of Tween 20 (10%).\nPrepare blocking solution as supplied by kit. Alternatively, use 1x PBS solution containing 2% BSA.\nPrepare the antibody diluent as supplied by kit. Alternatively, use 1x PBS solution containing 1% BSA.\n2. Plating of Cells\nNOTE: In this study, we used immortalized Human Schwann Cells (iHSC) and Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK 293); however, this method can be used for many types of adherent cells.\nCulture HEK 293 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.2% Glucose, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin G and 100 µg/mL streptomycin on tissue culture-treated plates at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Maintain iHSC in 10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with Pen/Strep and 2 µM forskolin. Routinely test cells for mycoplasma. No cell line authentication was performed.\nCoat a 16-well chamber slide with 50 µL of 10 µg/mL natural mouse laminin or 0.01% poly-L-lysine solution and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Split cells using 0.04% trypsin-EDTA.\nPlate iHSC and HEK-293 in 100 µL of medium at 80% confluence (15,000-25,000 cells/well).\nIncubate the cells for 12 -24 hours at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator.\n3. Fixation and Permeabilization",
    "Remove the medium from the wells and wash with 100 µL of 1x PBS. Aspirate with a micropipette to minimize the risk of removing the sample.\nFix cells by adding 50 µL of 4% PFA per well and incubate for 10 min at RT, without agitation. Cells are sensitive to detachment, so avoid pipetting the solutions directly onto the cells.\nWash the cells with 0.05% TBST three times for 5 min each. Aspirate with a micropipette to minimize the risk of removing the sample.\nTreat the cells with permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton x-100 in 1x PBS) for 10 min without agitation at RT.\nWash cells with TBST three times for 5 min each with agitation.\n4. Blocking\nTap off the TBST (very gently with a micropipette). Visualize the slide in a microscope to see if cells remain attached.\nAdd one drop (50-60 µL) of 1x Blocking Solution to each sample.\nPre-heat a humidity chamber (empty tip box with water) at 37 °C and incubate the slides in it for 1 h at 37 °C.\n5. Primary Antibodies\nDilute the primary antibodies (1:100) in the Antibody Diluent (see Table of Materials). Prepare 40 µL antibody solution per well.\nRemove blocking solution from the slides by tapping off the liquid. Do not allow cells to dry.\nVortex and add 40 µL of the antibody solutions to each well.\nIncubate 1 h at 37 °C in a preheated humidity chamber.\n6. Proximity Ligation Assay Probes\nNOTE: PLA probes are provided as part of a kit (see Table of Materials). The choice of probes will depend on the species of primary antibodies used to detect the proteins of interest.",
    "Dilute the two PLA probes (anti-Mouse MINUS and anti-Rabbit PLUS) 1:5 in the Antibody Diluent. For each sample, prepare 40 µL of PLA probe. Incubate the mixture for 20 min at RT.\nTap off the primary antibody solution from the slides. Wash the slides twice for 5 min each with Wash Buffer at RT.\nGently tap of the Wash Buffer from the slides and add the diluent PLA probe solution to wells (40 µL/well).\nIncubate the slides in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 1 h at 37 °C.\n7. Ligation\nNOTE: The in situ Detection Reagents Red, Ligase, and Ligation Solution are provided as part of a kit (see Table of Materials).\nUse the in situ Detection Reagents Red.\nImmediately before use, vortex and dilute the required volumes of the 5x ligation stock 1:5 in high purity water.\n\tNOTE: Do not store diluted reagents.\nTap off the PLA probe solution from the slides. Wash the slides in 1x Wash Buffer twice for 5 min each at RT.\nImmediately before addition to the samples, vortex and add Ligase to the Ligation solution at 1:40 dilution and vortex again.\nTap off the Wash Buffer from the slides and add the Ligation/Ligase solution to each well (40 µL/well).\nIncubate the slides in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 30 min at 37 °C.\n8. Amplification\nNOTE: The amplification stock is provided as part of a kit (see Table of Materials). Reagents are light sensitive; thus avoid exposing the slides to light.\nVortex and dilute the required volumes of the 5x Amplification stock 1:5 in high purity water and mix.\nTap off the Ligation/Ligase solution from the slides. Wash the slides in 1x Wash Buffer twice for 2 min each at RT.",
    "Vortex and add the polymerase to the Amplification solution at 1:80 dilution and vortex again.\nTap off Wash Buffer from the slides and add the Amplification/Polymerase solution to each well (40 µL/well). Incubate the slides in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 100 min at 37 °C.\n9. Preparation for Imaging\nNOTE: These are light sensitive reagents. Keep the slides protected from light.\nTap off the Amplification-Polymerase solution from the slides and wash twice for 10 min each in 1x Wash Buffer at RT.\nRemove the chambers and silicone around the wells from the slide completely. Scrape off the remaining bits of silicone with a razor. Draw a grid on the slide separating each well.\nAdd ~40 µL of the mounting medium with DAPI. Be careful to avoid trapping air bubbles under the cover slip. The edges of the cover slip can be sealed with nail polish.\nWait for at least 20 min before performing image analysis using a confocal microscope.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nAfter imaging, store the slides at -20 °C in the dark.\nSubscription Required.
