Although there is a wide array of such fluorophores (Haugland, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]; Molecular Probes Handbook), small, non-perturbing fluorophores such as NBD and bimane serve as excellent tools for spectroscopic and structural mapping of proteins (Raghuraman et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib55]). A schematic representation of labeling a single-Cys mutant of protein with thiol-reactive fluorophores is given in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1462-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Site-specific labeling of single-Cys residue by a thiol-reactive fluorophore\nSchematic representation of fluorophore labeling (top) along with the chemical structures of widely used thiol-reactive fluorophores (NBD and Bimane) for protein structural dynamics studies. The fluorophore that is attached to single-Cys is depicted as a green circle.\nAdd 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to 1–2 mg of the purified single-Cys mutant of the protein (∼0.5–1 mL) and incubate at 4°C for 1 h.\nCritical: DTT is a thiol-containing reagent (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), which might compete with the Cys in the protein for conjugation with the thiol-reactive probe. Therefore, DTT should be completely removed before proceeding with fluorophore labeling.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1462-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Chemical structures of commonly used reducing agents during fluorophore labeling\nOptional: Tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) can also be used to reduce the disulfide bonds between Cys residues.\nNote: For the thiol-reactive fluorophore to efficiently react with the free thiol group of the purified single-Cys mutant protein, the disulfide bonds formed (if any) must be chemically reduced before adding the fluorophore.",
    "Unlike DTT, TCEP does not have any thiol and therefore downstream thiol labeling reactions do not generally require prior removal of TCEP (Getz et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). However, TCEP is highly reactive towards haloalkyl derivatives such as Bimane, IANBD, etc., and therefore must be removed before conjugation with these fluorescent dyes.\nRemove excess DTT before protein labeling with a fluorophore.\nEquilibrate PD10 desalting column with 4 column volumes (∼20 mL) of respective protein buffer without DTT.\nAdd 500–1,000 μL of DTT-treated protein through a pre-equilibrated PD10 desalting column and make sure the entire protein solution has gone into the column. Add 2 mL of desired protein buffer and let it pass through the column completely.\nAdd 3 mL of desired protein buffer and collect the flow through, and this eluent should contain the protein without DTT.\nOptional: Dialysis or SEC can also be used to remove the excess reducing agent if a desalting column is not available.\nNote: PD10 desalting column is generally preferred since it is less time-consuming than doing SEC or dialysis. Further, dialysis might cause the protein to aggregate leading to a significant loss.\nWash the PD10 column with plenty of Milli-Q water to completely remove the free DTT trapped in column.\nNote: This column is now ready for reuse, if needed (follow steps 2 and 3).\nConcentrate the protein using Amicon centrifugal concentrators (with a desired MW cut-off) in a table-top centrifuge at 2000×g at 4°C. Check the concentration using microvolume spectrophotometer.\nPrepare a stock concentration of the fluorophore in DMSO (∼30–40 mM).\nCritical: Since the fluorophores are light-sensitive, the stock solutions should be protected from light as much as possible. Use amber glass vial covered with aluminum foil for storing the fluorophore stock solution.",
    "Optional: Instead of amber glass vial, normal glass vials wrapped in an aluminum foil can also be used.\nPause point: The stock solutions of the fluorophores can be aliquoted and stored at −20°C for months.\nFrom the stock solution, add 10-fold molar excess of the fluorophore with respect to the single-Cys mutant of the protein in a 1.5 mL amber Eppendorf tube. Wrap the vial in aluminum foil to protect from light, and keep it on a rotator for ∼12 h at 4°C.\nOptional: Labeling can also be performed at ∼25°C. For that, the reaction mixture (light protected) should be kept for only 2 h on a rotator. Further, if amber Eppendorf tubes are not available, normal 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes wrapped in an aluminum foil can also be used.\nRemove the excess unbound/free fluorescent dye.\nEquilibrate PD10 desalting column with 4 column volumes (∼20 mL) of respective protein buffer.\nAdd the fluorophore-containing protein solution through a pre-equilibrated PD10 desalting column and make sure the entire protein solution has gone into the column. Add 2 mL of desired protein buffer and let it pass through the column completely.\nAdd 3 mL of desired protein buffer and collect the flow through, and this eluent should be devoid of unbound/free fluorophore and contain the protein labeled with the fluorophore at the desired single-Cys residue.\nOptional: Dialysis or SEC can also be used to remove the excess unbound/free fluorescent dye if a PD10 desalting column is not available. See ‘Note’ in step 2.\nConcentrate the protein using Amicon centrifugal concentrators (with a desired MW cut-off) in a table-top centrifuge at 2000×g at 4°C. Check the concentration using microvolume spectrophotometer.\nCheck the labeling efficiency.\nUse the following formula to calculate the labeling efficiency:",
    "Equation 1     A x  ε  ×   M W  o f  p r o t e i n   m g  p r o t e i n / m l   =    m o l e s  o f  d y e   m o l e s  o f  p r o t e i n       \nwhere Ax is the absorbance value of the dye at the absorption maximum wavelength. ε is molar extinction coefficient of the dye at the absorption maximum wavelength. Use ε478 = 25,000 M-1cm-1 for NBD. Ensure that the labeling efficiency of the protein with the fluorophore is at least 50% before performing fluorescence measurements.\nNote: A few points that should be taken care of during site-directed fluorescence labeling with extrinsic probes:\nThe size and structure of the fluorophore should be non-perturbing, and small enough for efficient insertion even in relatively hydrophobic regions. NBD and Bimane probes are small and good for this purpose, whereas Alexa, BODIPY and cyanine dyes (Cy3 and Cy5) can only be used for labeling at the exposed sites.\nThe fluorophore should be sensitive to changes in environmental polarity. This is an important criterion for monitoring the protein folding, membrane binding events and topology of the protein (whether solvent or lipid exposed) etc.\nExcitation and corresponding emission wavelengths should ideally be in the visible range so as to avoid fluorescence contributions from intrinsic Trp and Tyr residues.\nSince a single fluorophore per molecule is expected, the fluorophore should have a high quantum yield to get a good signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio.\nAfter labeling the protein, ensure the labeled protein retains the proper structural integrity by checking the homogeneity of the protein with FPLC and the secondary structure of the labeled protein with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1462-Fig3.jpg",

Figure modified from Das et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16].\nFluorescence approaches to study labeled and Trp-containing proteins\nTiming: 1–2 days/sample\nGeneral tips for measuring fluorescence (intrinsic and extrinsic) in proteins.\nQuartz cuvette should be thoroughly cleaned. See the following link for cleaning suggestions: https://www.starnacells.com/d_tech/tech01.html[href=https://www.starnacells.com/d_tech/tech01.html]\nThe slits of the excitation and emission monochromators can be adjusted to let more light through. The signal should be high to obtain a good S/N ratio, but it should be below the detector saturation limit, which otherwise can alter the detector behavior and distort the data.\nSlit-width of the fluorometer should be set depending upon the protein concentration as well as labeling efficiency of protein with an external probe. Typically, excitation and emission slits with a nominal bandpass of 5 nm would suffice.\nAnother common problem in fluorescence spectroscopy affecting spectral measurements is the inner filter effect, which can be avoided by reducing the concentration of the sample. Typically, micromolar concentration of the native (for intrinsic fluorescence) or labeled protein can be used.\nBuffers and protein samples should be filtered using a 0.22 μm syringe filter.\nOnce the conditions have been optimized, the measurement parameters can be set in the spectrometer software as per the need.\nWe use Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorometer which allows setting the wavelength range, step size, integration time etc. All fluorescence parameters mentioned below are done at ∼25°C using a sample volume of 1 mL.\nNote: Any other Fluorescence spectrometer can be used for taking measurements.\nTaking the fluorescence emission scans.\nTake the emission scan of the Blank.",
    "For soluble proteins, take the emission scan of only the buffer (same buffer in which the protein is present). This will be the Blank.\nIn case of membrane proteins, the Blank contains buffer components along with micelles or liposomes. So, basically Blank should have everything except the protein.\nNow, take the emission scan of the protein sample (∼3–6 μM).\nNote: To measure the intrinsic fluorescence of a protein, which has only Trp and no Tyr residues, use excitation wavelength of 280 nm, whereas for proteins that contain both Trp and Tyr residues, use excitation wavelength of 295 nm to predominantly excite Trp residues and remove the contributions from Tyr. Then take the emission scan from 305 to 400 nm. Use ‘corrected spectra’ option.\nIf the single-Cys mutant is labeled with an extrinsic fluorophore like NBD, use excitation wavelength of 465 nm and take the emission scan from 475 to 600 nm.\nCritical: Rayleigh scattering is an elastic scattering and appears at the same wavelength as that of the excitation wavelength. Rayleigh scattering is very intense, and hence start the emission scan range at least 10 nm red shifted from the respective excitation wavelength.\nSubtract the buffer Blank spectrum from the emission spectrum of the protein sample using the in-built software of the respective fluorometer.\nCritical: Blank subtraction from the protein emission spectrum is extremely important to avoid potential artifacts caused by the Raman scattering, which is an inelastic scattering and appears after the excitation wavelength. Raman scattering is a big problem in measuring Trp fluorescence especially at excitation wavelengths of 295–310 nm (see REES experiments below) since the Raman peak overlaps with the spectral contribution from Trp residues (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1462-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Blank-subtracted fluorescence emission spectrum",
    "(A) Shown are the Raman peak (red trace) of Blank, and the emission spectrum of the unsubtracted protein (blue trace) sample.\n(B) shows the Blank-subtracted protein spectrum (Trp fluorescence). Excitation wavelength used was 295 nm.\nNote: For measuring the emission spectrum of NBD-labeled protein, Raman scattering is generally not an issue. However, it is always advisable to do the Blank subtraction.\nTake the emission scans of the other labeled single-Cys mutants as described above.\nNote: Use the same Blank spectrum for obtaining the Blank-subtracted emission spectra for all the mutants.\nCritical: It is possible that the labeled protein might have weak or reduced fluorescence. Possible reasons could either be aggregation due to prolonged storage or high working concentration.\nFrom the Blank-subtracted spectra, note down the fluorescence emission maximum (λem) as well as the intensity values at λem from the respective sample.\nSteady-state fluorescence anisotropy/polarization measurements\nPlace the excitation and emission polarizers in the respective slot. Rotate both polarizers to 90°(Horizontal, H) orientation in the spectrofluorometer. Excite at 280 nm or 295 nm for Trp residues depending on the protein composition for intrinsic fluorescence (see ‘Note 12b’). For NBD-labeled protein, use 465 nm for excitation. Measure the fluorescence intensity at respective emission maximum. This is the value for IHH.\nNow, rotate only the emission polarizer to 0° (Vertical, V) orientation and measure the fluorescence intensity to get the value for IHV.\nThen, rotate only the excitation polarizer to 0° (V orientation) and measure the fluorescence intensity to get the value for IVV.\nFinally, rotate only the emission polarizer back to 90° (H orientation) and measure the fluorescence intensity to get the value for IVH.\nNote: Perform the above steps (13a-d) for the Blank before triggering measurements for samples.\nCalculate the fluorescence anisotropy (r) values using the equation (Lakowicz, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]):",
    "Equation 2   r =    I  V V   − G  I  V H      I  V V   + 2 G  I  V H         \nwhere IVV and IVH are the measured fluorescence intensities (after appropriate Blank subtraction) with the excitation polarizer vertically oriented and emission polarizer vertically and horizontally oriented, respectively. G is the grating correction factor and is the ratio of the efficiencies of the detection system for vertically and horizontally polarized light.\n   Equation 3   G =  I HV  /  I HH      \nNote: Fluorescence anisotropy (r) values can be interchanged to fluorescence polarization (P) values using the equation P = 3r/(2+r).\nCalculate the apparent rotational correlation times (τc) from the Perrin’s equation (Lakowicz, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]):\n   Equation 4    τ c  =  < τ > r /  (  r o  − r )      \nwhere ro is the limiting anisotropy of the fluorophore, r is the steady-state anisotropy, and <τ> is the mean fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore. Please see Step 16 for how to measure lifetimes.\nNote: The ro for Trp is 0.16 (Eftink et al., 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), and for NBD is 0.354 (Mukherjee et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib43]).\nRed Edge Excitation Shift (REES).\nExcite the sample at its respective excitation maximum and take the emission scan.\nFor intrinsic Trp fluorescence, excite the protein sample at 280 nm or 295 nm depending on the protein composition (see ‘Note 12b’).\nFor NBD-labeled protein, use 465 nm for excitation.\nNow, excite the sample going towards the red edge of the absorption band, and take the respective emission scans.\nFor Trp, use 295, 298, 301, 303, 305, 307 and 310 nm excitation wavelengths.\nIn case of NBD (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), emission scans as a function of increasing excitation wavelengths 465, 475, 490, 495, 500, 503, 505, 507, 510, 513 and 515 nm can be measured.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1462-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. REES measurement",
    "The effect of changing excitation wavelength on the wavelength of maximum emission for a mutant (134-NBD) of a potassium channel KvAP in membrane (unpublished data). Red line is merely a visual guide.\nCritical: REES experiments require a polar fluorophore. Therefore, bimane is not a suitable probe for REES due to its nonpolar nature.\nNote: Perform the above steps (14a, b) for the Blank before triggering measurements for samples.\nMake sure to subtract the corresponding Blank spectrum associated with a particular excitation wavelength from the respective protein emission spectra.\nFrom the Blank-subtracted spectra, note down the respective fluorescence emission maximum (λem) at different excitation wavelengths.\nNote: The S/N ratio will dramatically decrease as a function of increasing excitation wavelengths due to reduction in both molar absorption coefficient and the quantum yield. Due to this, sometimes it will be difficult to get the emission maximum from the Blank-subtracted spectrum for 310 nm excitation (for Trp) and 515 nm excitation (for NBD) especially for membrane proteins.\nThe magnitude of REES is calculated by taking the difference between the λem obtained upon exciting at the most red-edged excitation (i.e., low energy excitation) and at the excitation maximum (i.e., high-energy excitation). See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for a representative example, in which the magnitude of REES is 5.5 nm (538.5–533).\nFluorescence quenching measurements.\nTake 1 mL of native protein or labeled mutant protein (1–2 μM) in a clean cuvette and measure the fluorescence intensity at the desired emission wavelength upon exciting at the wavelength of excitation maximum. This is fluorescence intensity in the absence of the quencher (i.e., Fo).",
    "Add a small aliquot of a quencher (Acrylamide for Trp fluorescence; Iodide (KI) for NBD) from a freshly prepared stock solution (8 M and 2.5 M for Acrylamide and KI, respectively) to the protein sample while stirring and incubate for 2 min in the dark sample compartment (shutters closed) in the fluorometer.\nCritical: Acrylamide is known to cause neurotoxic effects in humans. Care must be taken while handling acrylamide.\nCritical: Always prepare fresh stock solution of quencher for the quenching measurements. When iodide (I-) is used as a fluorescence quencher, the I- gets oxidized to I2. This is prevented by the addition of 1 mM sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3). Also, keeping the solution on ice helps to inhibit I2 formation for some time.\nMeasure the fluorescence emission intensity.\nUsing a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, measure the absorbance of the protein-quencher mixture at the respective excitation and emission wavelengths for inner filter effect correction.\nNote: As a rule of thumb, absorbance should be < 0.1. In case the absorbance is more, reduce the sample concentration.\nRepeat b-d for subsequent addition of quencher until the Fo reduces by ∼50%.\nSubtract the corresponding fluorescence intensities obtained from Blank in the absence and presence of quencher from the sample’s fluorescence intensities.\nGet the dilution-corrected fluorescence intensities.\nCorrect for inner filter effect, if any, by using the following equation (Lakowicz, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]):\n   Equation 5   F   =    F obs   antilog  [  (  A ex    +    A em    )   /  2 ]      \nwhere F is the corrected fluorescence intensity and Fobs is the background subtracted fluorescence intensity of the sample. Aex and Aem are the measured absorbance at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively.\nGet the Fo/F ratio for each quencher concentration. This value is 1.0 for samples that do not contain the quencher (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1462-Fig6.jpg",
    "Figure 6. Schematic representation of a quenching experiment\nLeft: The fluorescence emission spectrum in the absence (broken line) and the presence (solid lines) of quencher (+Q), and increasing concentrations of quencher is denoted by an arrow. Right: The trend of Fo/F as a function of increasing quencher concentration is shown. Fitting this with a line equation yields the slope, that is the KSV value.\nAnalyze the quenching data by fitting to the following Stern-Volmer equation (Lakowicz, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]) as schematically shown above:\n   Equation 6   F o   /  F   =  1  +    K SV   Q    =  1 +  k q   τ o     Q     \nwhere Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively, KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (unit is M-1), and [Q] is the molar quencher concentration. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KSV) is equal to kqτo, where kq is the bimolecular quenching constant (unit is M-1s-1) and τo is the lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of quencher (see step 16 for the lifetime measurements).\nCalculate the kq values using KSV and τo\n   Equation 7    k q  =   K  S V   /  τ o      \nMeasuring fluorescence lifetimes.\nTurn on the NanoLED. Measure the instrument response function (IRF, also called Prompt) at the excitation wavelength of the desired NanoLED attached. The emission wavelength should also be the same. This is generally done by using 1 mL of very diluted solution of colloidal silica (1% Ludox) as the scatterer in a quartz cuvette. This will take ∼5 min.\nNote: There is no Blank measurement in lifetime. Instead, the IRF is required for deconvolution analysis that considers the distortion caused by the instrumental response on the decay. Basically, IRF reflects the distribution of photons from the excitation pulse in a non-fluorescent scattering medium.",
    "Critical: Do not use ‘non-dairy café creamer’ or glycogen as the scatterer as mentioned in older literature since they might contain fluorescent impurities.\nCritical: We use Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) decay measurements using HORIBA Fluoromax steady-state and time-resolved table-top spectrofluorometer. Make sure to use the nominal emission bandpass (typically 3 nm) so that the α value (which is the stop-to-start ratio) is not more than 2%. This is to reduce the likelihood that more than one photon will be detected in response to any one excitation event.\nNote: The scattering solution must be really weak, so if the signal from Ludox is too strong, dilute it further.\nTo optimize the S/N ratio, at least 10,000 photon counts are collected in the peak channel.\nSet up a new decay, and put the protein (native or labeled sample) inside.\nDepending on the concentration of the protein (native or labeled), the emission bandpass is generally kept between 5-8 nm. Change the emission wavelength to the respective wavelength required for the sample. Start acquiring the fluorescence decay.\nAfter the acquisition is complete, save the decay file along with the IRF.\nThe analysis is generally done in a Decay Analysis software provided by the manufacturer.\nThe fitted data can be exported as text files, which can be read by graphing software for plotting the decay profile, and calculation of mean lifetime.\nDiscrete analysis of lifetime decay:\nIt is a model-dependent analysis of fluorescence lifetime decay.\nFluorescence intensity decay curves so obtained were deconvoluted with the instrument response function and analyzed as a sum of exponential terms:\n   Equation 8    F  ( t )  =   ∑ i    α i   exp  ( − t /  τ i  )",

Since the MEM data is obtained in log scale, it biases the contribution of longer rates. This is corrected by dividing the calculated pre-exponential factors by the rates (or lifetime). The area under each peak and full width at half maximum (FWHM) are calculated from the corrected plots."
