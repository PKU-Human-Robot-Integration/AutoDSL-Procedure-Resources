    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSevoflurane administration in live animals\nTiming: 2–2.5 h\nMice are anesthetized with sevoflurane, which is delivered in a gas mixture that contains supplemental oxygen for 2 h while being maintained in a warm environment. Control mice receive only supplemental oxygen and medical air for 20 min. Previous studies have shown that the procedure described below maintains pH, O2, and CO2 saturation with minimal cardiorespiratory disruption.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nTurn on the heating pad underneath the induction chamber to ensure that mice are kept warm during anesthesia (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2C).\nAdjust the airflow on the anesthetic delivery machine to deliver 2.3% sevoflurane, in 30% O2 and 70% medical air mixture, at a rate of approximately 1 L/min.\nCritical: Use a gas analyzer to monitor expired gases (effluent from the chamber or from a sampling catheter placed in close proximity to the animal's nose) and ensure that O2 is delivered at the appropriate concentration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAllow the air in the induction chamber to be replaced with the delivered gas and monitor the concentration of anesthetic drug with the gas analyzer.\nOnce saturated, quickly open the chamber and place the mouse inside. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nWait for the mouse to lose consciousness, which can take several minutes, depending on the concentration of anesthetic drug.\nThe loss of righting reflex (LORR) can be used to confirm the loss of consciousness. To assess LORR, gently tilt the induction chamber until the mouse is supine.\nWhen the mouse turns supine, with all four paws not touching the floor, LORR is considered to be achieved. If the mouse rights itself, wait an additional 30 s and assess the LORR again.\nContinuously deliver sevoflurane, medical air and oxygen for 2 h, taking care to visually monitor the animal for cyanosis and hypoventilation.",
    "Note: Under optimal anesthetic conditions, the breathing rate should be approximately 55–65 breaths per minute. Cyanosis, characterized by a bluish-purple hue, can be observed in the extremities of the mouse. Cyanosis can be difficult to detect and physiological monitors including pulse oximetry, heart rate and blood pressure monitors are strongly recommended.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nCritical: Ensure that the mouse is positioned supine throughout the anesthetic treatment, as this position helps to keep the airway patent that is unobstructed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nAfter 2 h have elapsed, turn off the sevoflurane vaporizer.\nIncrease the air flow rate to 3 L/min to rapidly flush the remaining sevoflurane from the induction chamber.\nAllow the mouse to recover in the warmed chamber for at least 10 min or until it regains consciousness before returning it to the home cage.\nPreparation of hippocampal slices\nTiming: 1–2 h\nTwenty-four hours after anesthetic drug treatment, prepare coronal hippocampal slices from a mouse 8–9 weeks old according to standard procedures.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nSacrifice mice using decapitation. Quickly extract the brain and keep it in ice-cold carbonated aCSF (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2870-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Dissection of mouse hippocampal slices\n(A) Schematic representation of the suggested cuts in sequential order to expose the brain.\n(B) Isolated mouse brain showing the removal of rostral and caudal brain sections.\n(C) Zoomed-in image of the mouse brain attached to the metal plate.\n(D) Photograph of the vibratome chamber containing ice-cold aCSF.\n(E) Coronal slices and isolation of hippocampal slices.\n(F) Transfer of hippocampal slices into an Eppendorf tube.\nMake two coronal cuts in the mouse brain as denoted by the dotted lines using a razor blade, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nUse super glue to adhere the rostral end of the brain onto the metal vibratome plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Attach the metal plate to the vibratome such that the brain is submerged in the vibratome reservoir containing ice-cold aCSF, and surrounded by ice (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nCritical: Ensure that while collecting the brain slices, the vibratome reservoir chamber is constantly bubbled with carbogen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCut coronal slices with a thickness of 300–350 μm.\nNote: A setting of 300 μm of thickness will allow the collection of at least 3 complete coronal slices that include the hippocampi (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nNote: Using regular dissecting scalpels, carefully remove the hippocampal slices from the coronal slices.\nUsing a Pasteur pipette, transfer four hippocampal slices into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Two hippocampal slices can be obtained from a single coronal slice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nPause point: Allow the slices to recover on ice with 1 mL of cold aCSF for 5–10 minutes before starting the biotinylation procedure.\nCell-surface biotinylation of hippocampal slices\nTiming: 3 h - overnight\nIsolation of surface proteins from mouse hippocampal slices using Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. It is recommended to prepare the biotinylation solution, quenching and lysis buffers before starting the Preparation of hippocampal slices.\nAfter the recovery, keep the four hippocampal slices in the same Eppendorf tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nWash the slices with 500 μL of ice-cold aCSF. Repeat twice.\nNote: Handle the hippocampal slices with minimal agitation; allow the slices to settle to the bottom of the tube without moving it before proceeding.\nCritical: When removing aCSF from the tubes during the washes, exercise caution to ensure that none of the slices are aspirated into the pipette. First, use P1000 tips to remove aCSF from the top, then use P200 tips to remove the remaining aCSF near the slices at the bottom. Pipette the solution slowly to prevent tearing the slices.",
    "Aspirate the remaining aCSF in the tube and add 1 mL of biotinylation solution (aCSF containing 0.5 mg/mL of Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin). Incubate on ice for 1 h, swirling gently every 15 min.\nCarefully remove the biotinylation solution and wash the slices with 500 μL of ice-cold aCSF. Repeat twice.\nCarefully aspirate the remaining aCSF and add 1 mL of quenching buffer to each tube to remove any unbound Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. Incubate for 5 min.\nAspirate the quenching buffer and carefully wash the slices with 1 mL of ice-cold aCSF twice.\nCritical: This washing step is of utmost importance as it helps to remove all residual biotin from the solution. Failure to adequately wash can result in an increase in the number of cytoplasmic proteins in the biotinylated protein fraction.\nRemove aCSF from the tubes and add 500 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer to each tube.\nSonicate the samples twice, each time for 5 s, with a 5-s rest in between. Use a probe sonicator (sonicator setting: 5 ms pulse, 70% amplitude) while keeping the tubes on ice.\nRotate the tubes (using an end-over-end mixer) containing the lysate at 4°C for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the tubes containing the lysate for 30 min (microcentrifuge setting: 12,500 RPM, 4°C).\nTransfer the supernatant to new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and discard the pellet. Keep the tubes on ice. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nTransfer 50 μL of supernatant to new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and add 50 μL of 2× Laemmli buffer to each tube. Store the tubes in a freezer at −30°C until further analysis.\nNote: These tubes contain the total protein fraction (cytoplasmic and surface proteins).\nAdd 100 μL of NeutraAvidin beads (no prior washing required) to the Eppendorf tubes containing the remaining supernatant. Rotate tubes at 4°C for 2 h or overnight.",
    "Note: Make sure that an equal volume of beads is added to each tube. Agitate the bottle containing beads vigorously for 30 s. After adding the beads to the tubes, wait until they are precipitated and visually confirm that the quantity of beads is equal in all tubes. Failing to achieve an equal quantity of beads may affect the level of surface proteins being pulled down.\nNote: Better results can be achieved with overnight incubation.\nWashing NeutraAvidin beads\nTiming: 1 h\nWashing of NeutraAvidin beads with lysis buffer to remove unbound proteins.\nCentrifuge the tubes containing the NeutraAvidin beads for 3 min (centrifuge setting: 2,500 RPM, 4°C).\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nAdd 500 μL of lysis buffer. Rotate for 5 min at 4°C. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nRepeat steps 28 through to 30 three times.\nCritical: Be careful when removing lysis buffer from the tubes to ensure the beads at the bottom of the tube are not disturbed. These beads are bound to surface proteins and any disturbance could potentially affect the quantification of proteins in later steps.\nRemove the lysis buffer, being as careful as possible to avoid disturbing the beads.\nAdd 50 μL of 2× Laemmli sample buffer to each tube.\nStore in a freezer at −30°C until use.\nPause point: These tubes contain the biotinylated protein fraction (isolated surface proteins). Store in a freezer at −30°C until use.\nWestern blotting\nTiming: 2 days\nFor subsequent Western blot analysis, prepare a 10% Polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gel. We use a standard Western blotting protocol3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] with a few modifications for biotinylated proteins.\nHeat both the biotinylation and total protein fraction on a heating block at 70°C for 7 min.",
    "Note: We recommend using 70°C for α5-GABAA receptors, as boiling membrane proteins in the loading buffer may lead to aggregation. It is important to note that other membrane proteins may require heating at different temperatures.\nCritical: Avoid loading beads into the wells. Spin down the samples briefly to ensure the beads are settled at the bottom of the tube. Carefully collect the sample without touching the beads inside the tube.\nLoad 10 μL of each protein fraction in the same gel for comparison by Western blotting.\nPreferably run the total and biotinylated protein fraction in the same gel. This will help to easily compare both fractions and ensure the performance of the procedure using internal control proteins (β-actin) in later steps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2870-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Comparison of two experiments showing different results after biotinylation\n(A) Representative Western blot from a successful biotinylation procedure. An internal control protein, β-actin, is shown in the total protein fraction and only minimally detected in the surface protein fraction. Na/K-ATPase expression, a non-GABA receptor expressed in the surface membrane, is also shown in the total and surface protein fractions.\n(B) An example of an unsuccessful biotinylation procedure is shown as excessive levels of β-actin in the surface protein fraction are detected.\nNote: Proteins are separated via SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes are blocked with 5% skim milk in T-TBS.\nOptimize and select primary antibodies whose molecular weights do not overlap. We use antibodies against Na/K-ATPase (Cell Signaling Technology, 3010) as a control for cell-surface proteins and an antibody for GABAA receptor α5 subunits (Thermos Fisher Scientific, MA5-27700) for quantification. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].",
    "Note: Primary antibodies for the α5 subunit of GABAA receptors, Na/K-ATPase and β-actin are used at dilutions of 1:1000 and incubated overnight. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies are used at dilutions of 1:5000 and incubated for one hour."
