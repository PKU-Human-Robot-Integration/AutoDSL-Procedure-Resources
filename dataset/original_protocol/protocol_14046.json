    "The investigations were conducted according to the guidelines outlined in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (US National Institutes of Health Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant institutional approvals (state government Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz [LANUV] reference number 84-02.04.2012.A397).\n1. Preparation of instruments, solutions, and equipment\nReconstitute FITC-polysucrose 70 with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride (NaCl) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL (i.e., 100 mg in 10 mL of NaCl).\nDialyze FITC-polysucrose 70 solution to remove free FITC molecules overnight at 4 °C (molecular weight cut-off [MWCO] at 10,000). Use 1 L of 0.9% sterile NaCl per 10 mL of FITC-polysucrose 70 under constant stirring. Protect from light. Aliquot the dialyzed FITC-polysucrose 70 and store it at -20 °C.\nFor the FITC-polysucrose 70 bolus, add 4 µL of 10 mg/mL FITC-polysucrose 70 solution to 996 µL of 0.9% NaCl (the final concentration of FITC-polysucrose 70: 40 µg/mL).\nFor the equilibration infusion solution, add 20 µL of a 10 mg/mL FITC-polysucrose 70 solution to 9.98 mL of 0.9% sterile NaCl yielding to a final concentration of 20 µg/mL.\nFor the experimental solution, add drugs or substances to the infusion solution (e.g., for angiotensin II [Ang II] [100 ng/kg/min] for a 25 g mouse, add 3 µL of Ang II of a 1 mM solution).\nFor the surgery, prepare one shaver, two surgical clamps, one pair of surgical scissors, two tweezers, two fine tweezers, one pair of fine scissors, and swabs. Prepare two 10 cm silk threads (4-0 to 6-0) for ligation procedures.",
    "For the placement of a central venous catheter, prepare a 10 mL syringe with a 21 G needle. Place the tip of the needle in a 30 cm-long catheter (with an inner diameter [ID] of 0.58 mm). Connect the 0.58 mm catheter to a 10 cm catheter (with an ID of 0.28 mm). Cut the tip of the smaller catheter oblique to create a sharp tip that is introduced into the jugular vein.\nPrepare the anesthesia (i.e., intraperitoneal anesthesia ketamine, 100 mg/kg of body weight, and xylazine, 5 mg/kg of body weight).\nPrepare a 22 G angiocatheter by discarding the needle and marking the catheter 1 cm from the tip. Preheat the heating pad to 37 °C.\nPrepare a blood pressure device and change the blood-pressure-measuring membrane if necessary.\n2. Preparation phase\nUrinary catheter\n\tNOTE: Section 2.1 follows the protocol as described by Reis et al.7. Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1 show the placement of a urinary catheter in female mice.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse with ketamine/xylazine (see step 1.8). Use the toe-pinch test to confirm proper anesthesia. To maintain anesthesia, repeat the anesthesia (e.g., with half the dosage) after 60 min. Proper anesthesia is confirmed if toe pinch test does not result in reflex withdrawl.\n\t\tNOTE: Female FVB mice are used in this protocol.\nPosition the mouse in dorsal recumbency on a 37 °C heating pad. Tighten the lower abdomen and find the urethral ostium (e.g., under a microscope).\nUse the plastic part of the catheter of a 22 G angiocatheter and lubricate it with xylocaine gel. Introduce it carefully 3 mm into the urethral ostium while paralleling the distal urethral axis (Figure 1A).\nTurn the top of the angiocatheter 180° by keeping the tip within the urethral ostium and maintaining the axis of the urethra (Figure 1B).",
    "Introduce the catheter 7 mm further into the mouse so that it is placed within the bladder (Figure 1C). Do not force the catheter beyond resistance. Correct the position of the catheter from the beginning if resistance is felt. Take note that if the position of the urinary catheter is correct, urine might already appear within the catheter.\nPlace a 1.5 mL brown tube over the top of the angiocatheter to collect the urine. Apply 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl subcutaneously to enhance urine production.\nCentral venous catheter \nShave the neck of the mouse and place it in recumbency with the head toward the surgeon. Hyperextend the head of the mouse with a tape.\nDisinfect the neck with 70% isopropanol. Make a small skin incision (5 mm) below the jawline, using a tweezer and a pair of scissors. Cut the skin approximately 1 cm in the direction of the sternum until the middle of the sternum is reached.\nCarefully dissect the skin on the right side of the neck, using a pair of scissors. Make a rectangular incision of the skin to the right side of the mouse to expose the soft tissue of the neck. Use a pair of scissors and a tweezer. Fix the skin flaps with two clamps.\n\t\tNOTE: The jugular vein runs along the left side of the thyroid gland or is slightly covered by the right lobe of the thyroid gland. After this step, use a microscope for surgery.\nCarefully expose the jugular vein by blunt preparation, using the tip of the fine tweezer. Avoid injury to vein branches.\n\t\tNOTE: It might be necessary to remove tissue with fine scissors. Be careful when using scissors to remove tissue as it increases the risk of bleeding.",
    "Place and close a ligature with a silk thread (4-0 to 6-0) at the distal part of the visible jugular vein (toward the head of the mouse). Put tension on the ligature by fixing the silk thread with a tape to ensure slight tension on the jugular vein. Prepare a ligature around the proximal part of the jugular vein.\nFill the catheter with the equilibration infusion solution (see step 1.4) and fix the catheter with a tape so that the catheter is aligning the jugular vein. Control for bubbles to avoid air embolism.\nLift the jugular vein with fine tweezers at the site of insertion (the insertion site is 1–2 mm proximal of the ligature). Align the tubing parallel to the jugular vein. Puncture the jugular vein, aiming for the lumen, and insert for approximately 2–4 mm, paralleling the axis of the jugular vein. Avoid any brisk movements.\nClose the ligature to fix the catheter. Control for tightness of the ligature by carefully viewing through the microscope. Put a damp swab over the site of surgery.\nBlood pressure measurement\nPlace the tail-cuff at the bottom of the mouse tail while the mouse lays in dorsal recumbency. Start the measurements and repeat them 10x per time point. Build a mean from the measurements.\nAdjust the position of the tail-cuff if blood pressure measurements do not seem correct and false data are produced.\n3. Equilibration phase\nChange the urinary collection tube before the equilibration phase starts and place it on ice.\nIntroduce a 10 mL syringe filled with FITC equilibration phase solution (see step 1.4) with a 21 G needle and the larger catheter (with an ID of 0.58 mm) and place it into the syringe pump.",
    "Fold a swab and put it around the small-vessel catheter (with an ID of 0.28 mm) that is introduced into the jugular vein. Lay the catheter inside the swab. Place a clamp over the swab to abolish retrograde blood flow or air embolism. Connect a 27 G needle with a 1 mL syringe filled with the FITC bolus to the end of the small-vessel catheter.\nOpen the clamp and apply the FITC bolus (100 µL). Close the clamp again and connect the larger catheter with the smaller catheter. Start the syringe pump with 0.008 mL/min (0.480 mL/h). Continue the infusion for 60 min.\n4. Experimental phase\nNOTE: In this phase, the effect of drugs on glomerular permselectivity can be investigated.\nChange the urinary tube (time point 0 min) to another 1.5 mL brown tube. Put a swab around the small-vessel catheter and close a clamp as indicated in step 3.3.\nDisconnect the large catheter from the small-vessel catheter. Change the syringes to the experimental phase solutions (see step 1.5). Let the infusion pump run so that the large catheter is filled with the equilibration solution.\nReconnect the catheters while avoiding air embolism and reopen the clamp. Start the syringe pump at 0.008 mL/min.\nContinue running the syringe pump for 60 min and collect the urine within the urinary tube thereafter (urine 60 min). Place the urine tube on ice.\nSacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation during anesthesia. Prior to disposal the mouse is observed for 5 minutes to ensure it is dead.\n5. Urine analysis\nFluorescence measurement\nThaw the urinary pool and dilute it 1:10 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\tNOTE: The urinary pool is a pool of urine that has been collected from healthy mice in a 12–24 h urine collection in a metabolic cage.",
    "Prepare standards for the fluorescence measurement. Take 10 brown 1.5 mL tubes and label them for blank (1:10 diluted urine pool) and the following FITC-polysucrose 70 concentrations (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 µg/mL).\nPipet 246 µL of diluted urine pool into a 1.5 mL brown tube and add 4 µL of the FITC-polysucrose 70 stock concentration (see step 1.1) to get a final concentration of 160 µg/mL FITC-polysucrose 70. Pipet 100 µL of the diluted urine pool into all other tubes.\nDilute 1:2 by pipetting 100 µL of the 160 µg/mL FITC-polysucrose 70 tube into the 80 µg/mL tube and continue with the other concentrations. Assure proper mixture of the diluted concentrations (e.g., by vortexing the tube before continuing).\nDilute the mouse urine samples (0 min, 60 min) 1:10 with diluted urinary pool.\nPipette 5 µL of each standard FITC-polysucrose 70 concentration and of the mouse urine samples as triplicates in a black 384-well plate. Centrifuge the plate at 1,000 x g for 15 s to avoid bubbles.\nAnalyze the 384-well plate in a plate reader. Perform excitation at 496 nm and measure the fluorescence at 525 nm.\nCreatinine measurement\nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, prepare creatinine standards by diluting 10 µL of the 100 mM creatinine standard solution with 990 µL of creatinine assay buffer to prepare a 1 mM standard solution.\nAdd 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 µL of the 1 mM creatinine standard solution into a 96-well plate to generate 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 nmol/well standards, respectively. Add creatinine assay buffer to each well to bring the volume to 50 µL.",
    "Prepare the reaction mixes by adding 42–44 µL of creatinine assay buffer, 2 µL of creatinase, 2 µL of creatininase, 2 µL of creatinine enzyme mix, and 2 µL of creatinine probe. For the blank, use 44 µL of creatinine assay buffer, 2 µL of creatinase, 2 µL of creatinine enzyme mix, and 1–2 µL of creatinine probe.\nAdd 50 µL of the appropriate reaction mix to each well in the 96-well plate and incubate it for 60 min on a horizontal shaker at 37 °C. Protect the plate from light during the incubation. Measure the absorbance at 570 nm on a plate reader.\nCalculate the creatinine concentrations by subtracting the blank value from all readings. The result will have the unit nanomoles/microliter. Multiply the concentration of creatinine by the molecular weight of creatinine (113.12 ng/nmol) to receive the unit nanograms/microliter.\n6. Data analysis\nCalculate the FITC-polysucrose 70 urine concentration from the standard curve.\nReference the FITC-polysucrose 70 urine concentrations to creatinine concentrations in the representative urine sample.\nReference the urine 60 min samples to urine 0 min samples of controls and treated mice.\nSubscription Required.
