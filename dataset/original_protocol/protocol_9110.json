    "1. Creating Naturalistic Virtual 3-D Objects using VM\nTo create digital embryos, use the Digital Embryo Workshop (DEW; see Table 1). Each run generates a single embryo14, the shape of which is unique to a given set of settings (or 'genotype') used for the given run (Figure 1). The 'cells' of the embryo are represented as triangles14.\n \nRun the program as many times as needed to generate the desired number of embryos.\nIf more complex shapes are desired, increase the number of growth cycles, i.e. the number of times the cells of the embryo will divide. Note that this will also slow down the program. If it is necessary to create virtual objects other than digital embryos, use commercially available 3-D modeling tools or obtain virtual objects from commercial vendors (Table 1).\nIt is generally advisable to save the virtual objects in a commonly used file format, such as OBJ, so that the objects can be readily imported into a commercial 3-D modeling toolkit. To this end, the DEW writes objects in OBJ format by default.\nVisual stimuli can be generated using one or more digital embryos using a 3-D modeling and rendering environment (Table 1). Use standard graphical operations such as varying the orientation, size, lighting, surface texture and background to create the desired stimuli (see Figure 2).\n2. Creating Naturalistic Object Categories using VP\nTo generate object categories, generate descendants (or 'children') of the given ancestor (or 'parent') object using a desired combination of the processes in Step 1.1 above (Figure 3)9,10,12,13.",
    "Some methods described below for creating smooth shape variations, such as morphing or principal components (see Steps 3 and 4 below), work better if all the input objects have the same number of cells and if there is one-to-one correspondence among the vertices of the objects. For creating such objects, use only those VM processes that will not change the number of cells and will preserve the one-to-one correspondence of vertices among the objects (see, e.g., generations G2 to G3 in Figure 3). For instance, cell division and programmed cell death alter the number of cells, and make it much harder (although not impossible17,18) to determine one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of a given pair of objects.\n  Note that the processes that alter the number of cells in a given object also alter its shape complexity. In general, the greater the number of cells, the greater the shape complexity of the object and smoother its surface.\nIf necessary, virtual objects other than digital embryos can be used as inputs to VP (Figure 4).\nThe objects within a given category can be further selected so as to achieve a given distribution of features19. For instance, one can selectively eliminate mid-sized objects from a given category in order to generate a bimodal distribution of object size.\nThere is no single method that is universally optimal for measuring the available shape information for all categories, nor is there a single method that is optimal for categorizing all objects20-22. Thus, the experimentor must choose these methods based on the categories and computational goals at hand20-22. Step 4 describes a commonly used method for manipulating various aspects of available shape information.",
    "The similarity between a given pair of categories can be objectively measured using available phylogenetic methods23,24. For instance, the vertical (or 'evolutionary') distance between a given pair of categories, as measured by hierarchical clustering methods in the R statistical toolkit, is an objective measure of category similarity25,26.\n3. Additional Methods of Creating Shape Variation: Digital Morphing\nGiven any pair of objects so that each vertex of one object corresponds to exactly one vertex of the other object (i.e., objects with one-to-one correspondence between vertices), morphing is straightforward17,18,27-29: In this case, smooth variations (or 'morphs') between the two objects are produced by smoothly interpolating between the corresponding vertices and normals (Figure 5). Depending on the pair of objects chosen, morphing will result in new categories or additional children within a category.\n \nThe objects shown in Figure 5 were created using linear morphing27-29. The objects can be morphed (or warped) by a vast array of other available deformation techniques17,18.\nTo create a desired distribution of morphed shapes, choose the interpolation points accordingly.\n4. Additional Methods of Creating Shape Variation: Principal Components\nIn order to use principal components to generate shape variations, one needs to first determine the principal components15. Principal components are specific to the given set of objects used for determining them26. For good results, use at least 30 objects with one-to-one correspondence between vertices26.\nGenerate an average object   from a desired set of n input objects, by separately averaging the coordinates and the normal of each vertex across all objects. Thus, the x coordinate of a given vertex k of   should be the average of the x coordinates of vertex k of all n objects, and so forth.",
    "Use the Matlab function princomp to determine principal components of the n objects. This will generate n-1 non-zero eigenvectors, along with the corresponding n-1 eigenvalues26.\nTo generate a new object Aj from a given principal component Pi , multiply Pi by the corresponding eigenvalue λi and a desired weight wj and add to the average object:\nAj=    +wjλiPi\nEach unique wj will generate a unique object. By smoothly varying w, one can create smooth shape variations along a given principal component.\nTo create shape variations along an independent shape dimension, repeat step 4.4 using a different principal component.\nTo create a desired distribution of shapes along a given principal component, use the desired distribution of w.\nTo create a multi-dimensional grid of shapes, use a set of weights for each of several principal components:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3358/3358eq2.jpg\n5. Creating Haptic Versions of 3-D Objects\n'Print-out' 3-D objects using a 3-D prototyper (or 3-D 'printer'). If necessary, adjust the object's size and smooth the object's surface prior to printing.\n6. An Exemplar Application: Bayesian Inference of Image Category\nAn important task in visual processing is inferring the category to which a given observed object belongs. Although the exact mechanism of this inference is unknown, there is both computational and physiological evidence 9,12,13,30-32 that it involves using the information about known features of the object in the given image to infer the category of the object. Here, we will illustrate how this inferential process may work in a Bayesian framework, and how digital embryos may be useful for research in this area.",
    "For simplicity, we will assume that the categorization task is binary and involves distinguishing category K from category L (Figure 3). Let C be the category variable. We will infer that C = K or C = L according to whether the observed image I belongs to category K or L. A typical approach to categorization involves:\n \nComputing the probability that the category is K given the information in the image, denoted p(C = K |I);\nComputing the probability that the category is L given the information in the image, denoted p(C = L | I); and\nPicking the category with the higher probability.\nNext, we will assume for simplicity that there is exactly one binary feature F. This feature may be either present in the image (denoted F = 1) or absent from the image (denoted F = 0). This example will use the 'informative fragment' feature shown in Figure 8. Informative fragments were first described by Ullman and colleagues33. In the present case, we will use the image template shown in Figure 8 as the feature, and a threshold value of 0.69. To determine whether this feature is present in a given image (say, the rightmost image in row G3 in Figure 3), we will use the following steps:\n \nSlide this template over all possible locations in the image and compute, at each location, the absolute value of normalized cross-correlation between the template and the underlying sub-image.\nSelect the image location with the highest value (0.60 in the present case).\nIf this value is above the threshold, conclude that the feature is present; otherwise, conclude that it is absent. In our case, since the highest correlation 0.60 is below the threshold of 0.69, we conclude that the feature is absent in this image.",
    "The rationale of using such features, and the mechanisms of selecting features and determining their thresholds are beyond the scope of this report, but are described in detail in refs. 33, 30.\nWithin the framework of feature-based inference, we assume that all the information the observer extracts from the image is contained in the value of this feature, i. e., that p(C | I) = p(C | F).\n Therefore, the task becomes that of determining the value of F in the given image (present or absent), computing p(C = K | F) and p(C = L | F) for that value F, and selecting the category with the higher probability.\nIn the Bayesian framework,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3358/3358eq3.jpg\nTherefore,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3358/3358eq4.jpg\nand\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3358/3358eq5.jpg\nNote that the denominator in the two equations is the same. Therefore, to compare p(C = K | F) and p(C = L | F), it is not necessary to compute the denominator; rather, it is sufficient to compute the quantities\np(C=K|F) ∝ p(C=K)p(F|C=K)\nand\np(C=L|F) ∝ p(C=L)p(F|C=L)\nThese are sometimes called 'unnormalized probabilities'. The term p(C) is called 'prior', and the term p(F | C) is called 'likelihood'.\nFor simplicity, we will assume a 'flat' prior: p(C = K) = p(C = L) = 0.5.\nThe task is now to compute p(F|C), the probability of a given feature value in an image of a given category C.\n \nWe will use the six images of category L (Figure 3) as an example to compute p(F = 1|C = L), the probability that the feature is present in an image of category L.\nTo compute p(F = 1|C = L), first take all the training images that belong to L. Again, these are shown in Figure 3.",
    "For each image, determine whether the feature value is 1 (present) or 0 (absent), as described in (6.3.1)-(6.3.3). In our case, for the six images in Figure 3, the values are: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\nCompute the fraction of images in which the feature value is 1. In our case, it is 2/6 = 0.33.\nTherefore, p(F = 1|C = L) = 0.33. Note that to obtain accurate estimates, one should use at least 30 images per class.\nIn a similar manner, we can compute that p(F = 0|C = L) = 0.67, p(F = 1|C = K) = 0.83, p(F = 0|C = K) = 0.17.\nGiven these values, inference can be performed. Assume that we are given a new image (Figure 9), and the task is to determine its category label. This is performed as follows:\n \nWe determine whether the feature F is present in the image, as described in (6.3.1)-(6.3.3). In our case, the feature is present, so F = 1.\nUsing equations (1) and (2), and the values computed in (6.7.5)-(6.7.6), we can calculate that p(C = K | F = 1) = 0.42 and p(C = L | F = 1) = 0.17.\nGiven this information, it is rational to conclude that the image is from category K, with relatively low confidence.",
    "It could be interesting and useful to test such an approach in a biological system (say, psychophysically). In this case, behavioral predictions could be made and compared against the computational results such as those obtained in (6.8.2). To make accurate predictions, good estimates of p(F |C) are necessary. Such estimates, however, may be difficult to obtain for familiar objects. The reason is that a subject's estimate of p(F |C) is not observable directly, and it is extremely difficult to compute it since the subject's prior exposure to natural images is uncontrollable and unknown. In contrast, if digital embryos are used for the experiments, then it is possible to precisely control which embryos and embryo categories the subject is exposed to. This makes it easy to compute the quantities of interest from exactly the same data the subject was exposed to. The fact that embryos' appearance is naturalistic is helpful, since it makes it likely that the subject is using the same categorization strategy as with natural categories."
