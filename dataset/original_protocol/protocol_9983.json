    "All methods described here have been approved by the ACUC (Animal Care and Use Committee) of the Johns Hopkins University.\n1. Preparing mouse cages for use\nCreate a slotted opening with dimensions of 0.8 cm width and 7 cm height from the base at the front end of each cage, as illustrated in Figure 1. This slot serves as the opening through which the animal will reach.\n\tNOTE: The auto-trainer was designed for the use with the standard mouse cage dimensions (as shown in Figure 1) supplied by most animal research supply vendors. Further, the auto-trainer will easily support other cage-types.\nInside each individual cage, add a platform adjacent to the slot to allow the mice to stand and reach the presented pellets. Ensure that the platform is located above the cage litter floor, approximately 3 cm in height. Use Petri dishes affixed with superglue and capped by a metal sheet approximately 10 cm x 15 cm, however, any flat surface large enough for a mouse to stand on to reach from will suffice.\nCreate a vertical notch through the middle of the front of the cage measuring 0.8 cm across and 7 cm high that will allow a mouse to reach his paw out of the cage.\nFrom a thin sheet of metal, (approximately 2 mm thick) cut a cage gate into rectangles measuring 5 cm x 10 cm to serve as a uniform opening through which the animal is to reach.\n\tNOTE: Mice may chew on plastic cages which would change the size of the opening. The mouse will reach through this 0.8 cm slot when the metallic cage gate is placed over the cage's slotted opening during testing using tape, maintaining the effective width of the slot between cages.",
    "Cover each cage's slot with tape when its mouse is not being tested to prevent litter from being expelled from the cage.\n2. Introducing mice to the reaching motion\nRecord each mouse's starting weight and calculate 85% of that value to find their goal weight, rounding up to 20 g if the result is less. Give them a feeding regime to bring them to and then maintain this goal weight.\n\t\nGive each mouse 2.5 g of pellets the first day and note any change in their weight 24 h later.\n\t\tNOTE: Weigh the mice once per day and expect a weight drop of 0.25-1 g per day.\nChange each mouse's daily feed as required, based on this initial change and ongoing changes in each mouse's weight, in order to induce gradual weight loss (less than 0.8 g lost per day) and then maintain the resulting goal weight. Vary between three to six 500 mg pellets (1.5 to 3.0 g) per day to be effective.\n\t\tNOTE: Mice remain on this diet to maintain their goal weight throughout the protocol.\nWhen a mouse has reached its goal weight, introduce each mouse to the concept of coming up to the gated slot for a supplementary food pellet. Start a training session by placing a 45 mg pellet on the pellet surface, directly in front of the slot, and allow each mouse to retrieve it. Most mice will take to this feeding arrangement within 1-2 days.\nOnce the mouse associates an open slot with being fed, encourage them to reach with a paw, rather than the mouth.\n\tNOTE: This is the most complex step, taking 1-2 days, and instilling counterproductive behavior in mice by mistake is very easy; please refer to the discussion section for further information and advice.",
    "Using a pair of tweezers, hold a pellet in the same position the mouse has retrieved pellets previously. As the mouse begins to bite for the pellet, pull it away approximately half a centimeter such that the pellet is out of reach of its mouth.\n\t\tNOTE: A mouse at its goal weight will attempt to retrieve the out-of-reach pellet. Whenever the mouse extends a paw through the slot, reinforce that behavior by allowing it to eat the pellet. Some mice may exhibit a preference for one paw over the other when extending for food.\nWhile not instrumental to experimentation, record whether the left or right paw is preferred. This may potentially allow for higher overall success rates in the behavioral assay; alternatively, eliminate a variable by forcing each mouse to reach with the same paw.\n\t\tNOTE: Better results are obtained if mice use their preferred paw.\nAs each mouse associates extending a paw with eating a pellet, further reinforce that behavior by withholding the pellet in response to attempts to retrieve the pellet with the mouth and tongue. Mice will start to comply with this arrangement over 2 to 3 days.\nFinalize the introduction of the desired paw reaching behavior by placing the 45 mg pellet just under 1 cm from the outer edge of the cage gate, such that the leftmost or rightmost point of the pellet (whether it is to the right or left of the cage slot from the investigator's perspective, respectively) is tangent to a line extending straight out from the edge of the cage gate's slot. Allow the mouse to attempt to retrieve the pellet, being vigilant to remove the pellet and prevent its consumption if the mouse should attempt by some other method than paw extension.",
    "NOTE: When a mouse consistently extends a paw to grab at and is able to touch the provided pellet, it is ready for testing using the auto-trainer described below and associated behavioral assay. The time from na√Øve introductions to being prepared will vary between mice; if there are stragglers that take more than two weeks to understand, they should be excluded from the data set.\n3. Using the auto-trainer\nNOTE: Please see Figure 1-3 and the discussion section for a full description of the hardware, software, and the physical actions of the auto-trainer.\nPrepare for the training session.\n\t\nCalibrate the bait pellet sensor. Click the Run arrow in the LabVIEW interface and note the bait pellet sensor reading both with and without a pellet in place. Click the Stop button to stop this test run and change the bait pellet sensor target to a value between those two readings (Figure 3 and Table 2). Most lighting conditions provide a reading between 1 and 4.\nPlace the modified mouse cage on the auto-trainer (Figure 2). Affix the cage gate ( Figure 1) and align the pellet to the edge of the slot as in the manual procedure.\nRun the mouse's training session using the LabVIEW interface.\n\t\nInput information as required to record data about the training session (Figure 3 and Table 2).\n\t\t\nClick the Mouse ID field and type the filename of each training session using the computer's keyboard.\nClick the Total Pellets to Dispense During Routine field to control how many pellets are dispensed for a single experiment (usually 20 - 30). To do so, click the up and down arrows or input the number using the computer's keyboard.",
    "Click the Pause After Pellet Number field to set a 5 s pause after the indicated pellet is removed from the diving board. To do so, click the up and down arrows or input the number using the computer's keyboard.\nClick the Pause Length field to set a pause in between the time a pellet is removed from the diving board and the time a new pellet is dispensed. To do so, click the up and down arrows or input the number using the computer's keyboard\n\t\t\tNOTE: Usually 1 s is an appropriate pause time. If the mice are anxious after each pellet is dispensed, it is advisable to increase the pause length using the Pause Length field to 5 s.\nManually record the distance at which the pellet is placed in the Reach Distance field. To do so, click the up and down arrows or input the number using the computer's keyboard\n\t\t\tNOTE: The Size of the Acceleration and Time Arrays is exposed for debugging purposes and may be ignored.\nClick the Folder to Contain Logs field to select the file location to save the collected data.\nOnce the information fields have been filled out, click the Run button to begin the training session. The auto-trainer will dispense individual pellets and track whether they fall through the funnel until the total number of pellets has been dispensed, and the last pellet has either been retrieved or dropped by the mouse. The program will stop automatically at this point. If necessary, it can also be stopped prematurely by clicking on the Stop button.",
    "Once the software is set up, place the home-cage of the mouse to be tested on the pedestal and observe the mouse so that you might gauge whether the mouse has indeed learned to attempt the required novel reaching behavior. After clicking the Run button, allow the mouse to investigate the slot and its new, unfamiliar surroundings.\n\t\tNOTE: Similar to when introducing mice to the concept of reaching, expect some mice to be more compliant than others. Mice that have grasped the concept should try to reach within 5-10 min and will associate the movement of the auto-trainer with the presented pellet, as when they associate an uncovered slot with food in the initial stages of this protocol.\nSubscription Required.
