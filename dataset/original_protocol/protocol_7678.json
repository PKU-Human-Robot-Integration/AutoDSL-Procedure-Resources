    "I.  Protein extraction protocol (Keep all steps at 4 °C)    Harvest approximately 300 mg of Arabidopsis tissue in liquid nitrogen.   Homogenize with mortar and pestle to a fine powder.   Resuspend the powder in 500 μl of extraction buffer (you can use manual homogeneizer).   Centrifuge 15 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C and discard the pellet.   Measure protein concentration in the supernatant as described (Bradford, 1976).    II.  GTP binding assay (reaction: final volume 200 μl)    Mix 100 μg of proteins in 100 μl extraction buffer with 80 μl of reaction buffer.   Add 20 μl of Initiation Buffer.   Expose to the corresponding stimuli (Light, agonist etc). (You should adjust the specific stimuli, time of exposition, concentration, intensity etc where you can detect optimum binding).   Incubate the reaction 10 min at room temperature.   Add 2 ml of ice-cold stop buffer to finish the reaction.   Filter the reaction through 0.45 μm nitrocellulose filters using vacuum. We use 3 cm diameter disks.   Wash the disk filters 5 times with 2 ml of cold Stop Buffer using vacuum. This step is important to wash away unbound GTP γ35S.   Dry disk filters containing the membranes for 15 min at 75 °C.   Put the disks in plastic vials containing 2 ml of scintillation solution.    Record the cpm in the 35S energy range with a liquid scintillation counter.     Important: Unspecific binding must be estimated using blank reactions. We recommend three replicates of two possible blanks: reactions without proteins (reaction buffer plus initiation buffer) or 100 μg of protein samples preheated to 95 °C for 10 min. We did not find differences in GTP binding between both blanks.   Subtract the average cpm obtained with the blank samples from the cpm obtained for each measured sample to obtain the correct value."
