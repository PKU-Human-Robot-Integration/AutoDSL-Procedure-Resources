    "Preparation of seedling growth mediaPrepare Milli-Q water for the desired amount of plant growth media and dispense it into a large beaker with a stir bar: 35 mL of media will be required per plate.Place beaker with water on a stir plate, and add packets of LS while stirring, to generate a 0.5× solution of LS media. Allow LS to completely dissolve.Prepare 1 L-screwcap bottles filled with 500 mL of LS liquid media.Weigh 7.5 g of agar and place into each bottle, to make a 1.5% agar-based media.Place a stir bar into each bottle, and mix the agar with the LS solution.Loosely tighten the caps, and autoclave on a liquid cycle for 30 min.Following sterilization, place media bottles in a 65°C oven until the media has cooled sufficiently to handle.If desired, add cadaverine at a concentration ranging from 2 µM to 2 mM, from a 1 M cadaverine stock solution prepared in water (see Notes). Biotin may also be added up to 1 µM, from a 1 mM stock in water (see Notes).Pour 35 mL of media into 100 mm square Petri plates in a laminar flow hood. After the plates have cooled, cover with a lid, and wrap in plastic. Store plates in the cold room for up to one month.Plating Arabidopsis seedsUse 95% ethanol to sterilize the lab bench or laminar flow hood.Aliquot the desired amount of seeds into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube, add 1 mL of 95% ethanol, and vortex the seeds in ethanol for 1 min.Pipette the seeds and ethanol onto a piece of filter paper, and allow them to dry completely.",
    "After the seeds and filter paper have dried, using a sterile toothpick or a pipette tip, plate 12 seeds on the surface of the agar, in a straight line, and 1 cm from the top of the plate.Wrap the plates in micropore tape.Place the plates in a blackout bin, or cover them with aluminum foil, to block all light.Place the plates at 4°C for 3 days.Growing Arabidopsis seedsAfter the 3-day cold treatment program: place the plates in a growth chamber, at a temperature of 22°C, and relative humidity of 65%, subjected to an illumination of 60 μmol/m2/s cool white light, 16 h-day/8 h-night cycles.Remove the plates from the cold, unwrap and place them in the plant growth chamber, either vertically or tilted backward at a 30° angle from the vertical, to stimulate root waving (Rutherford and Masson, 1996).To analyze root growth following cadaverine and/or biotin treatment, scan plates daily with a document scanner at a resolution of 300 dpi or greater.Measure root growth using the segmented line function in ImageJ.Preparation of Arabidopsis tissue for protein biotinylation quantificationPlate seedlings as described above.Following the desired growth period (we used 8 days after placing stratified seeds into the growth chamber), dissect seedlings, or harvest whole seedlings, and place the samples into a 2 mL-microfuge tube with one 4.5 mm steel bead. Immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen. Approximately 200 mg of tissue is required.Grind the tissue to a powder. Quickly place frozen tubes into the Mixmill and homogenize at 25 beats per second for 45 s. Place back into liquid nitrogen, then reload sample into the Mixmill, to repeat once more.Take tubes out of liquid nitrogen and place onto ice, to allow the tubes to gently thaw.",
    "Add protein extraction buffer (a volume in microliter equal to four times the amount of tissue in microgram, e.g., for 200 mg of tissue, add 800 µL of protein extraction buffer). Mix gently.Gently agitate (by rotation, for instance) the tubes of homogenate at 4°C for 30 min.Centrifuge the homogenate at top speed and 4°C for 30 min.Remove the supernatant and place the tubes on ice.Using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, determine the amount of protein in each sample, following the manufacturer’s instructions.Normalize the protein such that each protein sample is the same concentration, using the protein extraction buffer to dilute samples as needed.Prepare the protein homogenate for SDS Page, by adding 4× LSD Sample Buffer.Heat the samples at 65–70°C for 15 min, to linearize the protein. At this point, samples can be frozen at -20°C if needed.Detection of biotinylated proteins with StreptavidinPrepare the protein gel. We use the Invitrogen X-cell lock system. Prepare 500 mL of MOPS-SDS running buffer by diluting from stock. Separate 200 mL into a flask and add antioxidant.Set up the gel running box and add a stir bar. If running only one gel, use the filler plate.Open the wrapping from the gel and remove the white tape on the bottom.Add the protein gel to the box and clamp it in place. Add 200 mL of running buffer with the antioxidant to the inner well, and the remaining 300 mL to the outside.Carefully remove the gel comb.Using a pipette, gently rinse out wells with running buffer.Load gel, making sure to include 4 µL of protein standard in one of the wells.Place the lid on and run the gel at 50 V, on ice. Once the dye front has passed the stacking phase, the voltage can be increased to 100 V.",
    "While the gel is running, prepare the transfer buffer. In a 225 mL-flask, add 12.5 mL of NuPAGE transfer buffer. Fill up to 225 mL with ddH2O. Add 20–25 mL of methanol and antioxidant, and mix.Fill a flask with 500–600 mL of cold water, which will be used for the exterior chamber. Cover the flask and place it at 4°C until the gel is finished.Prepare the membrane and blocking paper, by cutting one piece of membrane paper and two pieces of 3M paper in rectangles of 8.9 x 5.7 cm. Using a pencil, the membrane can be labeled on a corner.At least 30 min before the gel has finished running (when the gel front has reached 75% of the way down to the bottom), cover the membrane in methanol to activate the PVDF membrane.After the gel has finished, using a spatula, crack the plastic cassette of the gel. With a scalpel, carefully cut away the dye front and combs from the gel.Place the gel in transfer buffer solution.Wash out the gel box.Prepare sponges. Do not overpack the sponges, as it will damage the transfer apparatus. Using a large dish, pour transfer buffer over to wet the sponges, making sure they are soaked in transfer buffer. Squeeze any excess air out of sponges.Wet a piece of 3M paper and place on 2–3 of the sponges. Place the gel on top of the 3M blocking paper, with the protein marker on the right side.Place the membrane on top of the gel with the label face down, and remove any air bubbles.Add another piece of soaked 3M blocking paper, and the remaining wet sponges.Close the transfer cassette and place in the gel box. Add the remaining transfer buffer, until the chamber is filled to the top.Fill the outer chamber with cold water.",
    "Run the transfer at 15 V, 160 mA, 3 W, on ice, overnight (16 h).Block the membrane with blocking buffer, at 4°C for 1 h.Wash the membranes with TBST buffer three times for 5 min.Incubate the membrane to streptavidin dye solution (see Recipes) for 1 h.Wash the membrane with TBST three times for 7 min.Dry the membrane in the dark (such as covering with aluminum foil), and image it using Image Studio software in a LI-COR Odyssey imaging system. Biotinylated proteins and their molecular weights are listed in Table 1.Table 1. Biotinylated proteins detected by streptavidin.  table:",

Experimental scheme for detection of biotinylated proteins in Arabidopsis.  To analyze the biotinylation of Arabidopsis proteins, seedlings are homogenized in protein extraction buffer and separated by SDS Page. Following transfer to a membrane, the membrane is probed with a streptavidin dye, which allows for visualization of the biotinylated proteins on the membrane. The signal intensity of each band on the membrane can be quantified, to determine the level of biotinylated protein in the corresponding sample."
