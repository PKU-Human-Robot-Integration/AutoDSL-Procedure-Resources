  "procedures": [
    "1. Collect fresh cord blood \\(typically 60–80 ml samples) from the umbilical cords of the placentas of normal, full-term, non-stressed newborns of consenting mothers.\n  2. Cord blood samples were diluted 1:2 in PBS. Cord blood mononuclear cells \\(CBMC) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation at 400 g for 30 minutes using standard procedures and washed extensively in PBS.\n  ▲ CRITICAL STEP Ensure that the cells were processed within 4 h of collection.\n3. Isolate CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from CBMCs with the Miltenyi human CD34 Microbead Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions \\(Miltenyi Biotec). \n  ▲ CRITICAL STEP Cell purity analysis by FACS, purity should be routinely higher than 90%.\n4. Determine the number of the CD34<sup>+</sup> cells by gently mixing 10 μl of the above isolated cells with 80 μl of PBS and 10 μl of Trypan Blue. Use a Neubauer chamber to count the number of viable \\(not stained) CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.\n  5. The isolated CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were cultured in warm SCGM supplemented with 100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin and 10% FBS in the presence of recombinant human SCF \\(30 ng/ml), Flt3-L \\(50 ng/ml), IL-15 \\(50 ng/ml) and IGF-1 \\(100 ng/ml).\n  ▲ CRITICAL STEP Depending on the cell number of the starting population \\(5×10<sup>4</sup> cells or 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells per culture), cultures were grown in 0.1 or 1.0 ml medium in 96- or 24-well culture plates, respectively. \n6. The cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 4 weeks. \n  ▲ CRITICAL STEP Every 3–4 days, half of the medium volume was replaced with fresh medium containing the same concentration of freshly added cytokines. Cell density was thereby adjusted to 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ ml in 6-well culture plates. \n7．Total number of viable cells differentiated from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells by various cytokine combinations, as counted for up to 4 weeks.",
    "8. At day 28, collect cells, the percentage of CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup> cells was measured by FACS analysis.\n  9. NK cell function was evaluated through flow cytometry monitoring of perforin and CD107a expression. \n  \\(1) For perforin assay: Intracellular staining for perforin was performed following\nsurface staining for CD56<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>neg</sup> cells \\(to identify NK cells). Stained cells were fixed and permeabilized with the Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit \\(BD Pharmingen), as detailed in manufacturers’ instructions: \na. Thoroughly resuspend cells with 250 μl of BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution in the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and incubate for 20 min. at 4°C.\nb. Wash cells two times in 1 ml BD Perm/Wash buffer.\nc. Thoroughly resuspend fixed/permeabilized cells in 50 μl of BD Perm/Wash buffer containing a predetermined optimal concentration of a PE-conjugated anti-perforin Ab or appropriate negative control. Incubate at 4°C for 30 minutes in the dark.\nd. Wash cells 2 times with BD Perm/Wash buffer and resuspend in staining buffer and then analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\\(2) For CD107a assay, the cytokine-differentiated NK cells were isolated, then 2×10<sup>5</sup>  NK cells and 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells of the erythroleukemia cell line K562 \\(American Type Culture Collection) were mixed by gentle pipetting, spun down for 1 min at 200 g, and incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 200 µl of SCGM media. NK cells were then stained with an Alexa-647-labeled anti-CD56-Ab, PE-Cy5-labeled anti-CD3-Ab, and degranulation was detected with a PE-labeled anti-CD107a-Ab \\(all Abs from BD Biosciences)."
