    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeeding cells for transfection\nTiming: 1 day\nSeeding the cells on a 24-well plate 24 h prior to transfection to achieve a confluency of 50%–60%.\nCheck cultured cells for possible contamination.\nDetach the cells by trypsinization and quantify the cell numbers by using a hemocytometer or a counting chamber.\nSeed 50,000 cells in 500 μL culture medium on a 24-well plate.\nIncubate for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: The distinct cell number may differ in other cell types, depending on the doubling time.\nPreparation of gRNA\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this step the crRNA and tracrRNA are annealed to obtain the sgRNA.\nPrepare 100 μM solution of Alt-R® CRISPR/Cas9 crRNA (IDT™) and Alt-R® CRISPR/Cas9 tracrRNA (IDT™) in Nuclease Free Duplex Buffer (IDT™).\nPreparation of 1 μM gRNA solution in nuclease free water in a sterile tube.\n1:1 mixture of 100 μM crRNA and tracrRNA.\nDilute 1:100 in nuclease free water.\nPlace the tube in preheated thermoblock at 95°C for 5 min.\nCool down to room temperature on benchtop.\nCritical: If the annealed sgRNA needs to be stored for repeated use, aliquots should be made to reduce freeze-thaw cycles. Storage at −80°C will prolong the lifetime for up to 18 months.\nLipofection of RNPs in HN cells\nTiming: 2 days\nLipofection of RNPs is achieved by using Lipofectamine™ CRISPRMAX™ (Invitrogen™) and RNP assembly with TrueCut™ Cas9 Protein v2 (Invitrogen™).\nPrepare cells for transfection.\nCheck each well for optimal confluency and possible contamination\nRemove culture medium and wash cells with 500 μL/well warm PBS\nAdd 500 μL fresh warmed up culture medium\nNote: The cells should be 50%–60% confluent at the time of transfection. Transfection efficiency could be affected by either lower or higher confluency.\nPrepare two separate tubes with the following reagents.",
    "Tube preparation\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2812_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2812_2.csv\nCritical: Diluted CRISPERMAX™ Reagent should not sit for > 3 min for optimal transfection efficiency.\nAdd tube 1 to tube 2 and mix well.\nIncubate for 5–10 min at room temperature.\nNote: RNP-complexes are forming within this step.\nCritical: Do not incubate for > 30 min.\nAdd 70 μL/well of the prepared solution to the wells.\nIncubate for 48 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: In HN cells editing efficiency was highly dependent on the used RNP concentration. No changes in cell expansion or the number of single cell clones per 96-well plate later on were observed with different RNP concentrations.\nSingle cell cloning with limiting dilution\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nSingle cells are seeded in 96-well plates and screened for single cell colonies for about 2–3 weeks.\nNote: Depending on the cell type, the required time for cell expansion and single clone screening may differ.\nDetach transfected cells by trypsinization and transfer in a 1,5 mL sterile tube.\nCount the cells by using a hemocytometer or a counting chamber.\nCritical: We highly recommend to first determine the editing efficiency of your different guide sequences at this step, before proceeding with the complete protocol.\nPerform PCR, sanger sequencing and analysis as described in step 26 and following. Pick the most efficient guide sequence to perform the knock-out.\nDilute the suspension to 0,5 cells/100 μL in culture medium.\nNote: You can use 0.2–0.8 cells/100 μL depending on your cell type.\nAdd 100 μL/well of your diluted suspension to a 96-well plate.\nCritical: Seed 1000 cells in your A1 well for easy adjustment of the microscope later on.\nNote: For increased likelihood of knock-out clones, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is suitable surface proteins.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for about 4–7 days. Do not move the plate.",
    "When the colonies can easily be identified under the microscope (100×), proceed with selecting the wells with just one colony. Discard the wells with two or more colonies. Change of culture medium can be done every 3–4 days.\nNote: Colonies are often forming at the edges of the wells and can easily be overlooked.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for about two more weeks or until the confluency of the wells reaches about 50%.\nDetach the identified single cell colonies (well by well) by trypsinization and transfer to a 24- well plate containing 500 μL/well culture medium.\nNote: If desired, you can transfer the colonies to a 48-well plate at first and to a 24-well plate in the next step. This depends on your cell type.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 until a confluency of about 50–70% is reached.\nDetach the cells by trypsinization (well by well) and count the cells by using a hemocytometer or a counting chamber.\nKeep 10,000 cells for further analysis in a sterile 1,5 mL tube (proceed with the next step) and seed the rest on a 6-well plate containing 1 mL/well culture medium. After analysis, keep your desired clones and culture them to your specifications.\nPCR and DNA purification\nTiming: 5 h\nYou proceed with the kept 10.000 cells. DNA extraction, PCR and DNA purification is done.\nWe used Phire Tissue PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) for DNA extraction and PCR. The DNA purification was done with the qiaQuick DNA purification Kit (Qiagen).\nSpin down your solution with your kept 10,000 cells at 1300 rpm for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 20 μL Dilution Buffer and add 0.5 μL DNARelease Additive.\nMix briefly by vortexing.\nIncubate the tube 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Place the tube in a preheated thermoblock at 98°C for 2 min.\nSpin down the solution at 1300 rpm for 3 min.\nTransfer the supernatant in a new sterile tube.\nPause point: The supernatant can be stored at −20°C if not used immediately.\nFor each 20 μL PCR reaction, add 10 μL Phire Tissue MasterMix, 1 μL forward primer, 1 μL reverse primer, 7 μL nuclease free water and 1 μL of your sample in a new sterile PCR tube. See the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2812_3.csv\nPCR can be performed with the following cycling conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2812_4.csv\nCritical: The perfect annealing temperature may vary according to your primers.\nNote: Optimal annealing temperature for your specific primers can be obtained by checking the Thermo Fisher Tm Calculator, available on the manufacturer’s web page. If needed, a temperature gradient can be used to further optimize the annealing temperature.\nFor DNA purification mix 20 μL of the PCR product with 100 μL PB-Buffer.\nAdd 10 μL 3M sodium acetate pH 5.0.\nTransfer mixture to a spin-column and spin down at 13,000 rpm for 60 s.\nDiscard flow-through.\nAdd 750 μL PE-Buffer to spin-column and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 60 s.\nDiscard flow-through.\nSpin down the spin-column for additional 60 s at 13,000 rpm.\nPlace the spin-column in a new sterile 1,5 mL tube.\nFor DNA elution add 25 μL nuclease free water to the center of the spin-column.\nLet it stand for 60 s.\nSpin down at 13,000 rpm for 60 s.\nPause point: The purified DNA solution can be stored at −20°C, if not used immediately.\nAnalysis of potential knock-out clones\nTiming: 2 h",
    "For detailed analysis, our clones were sent for sanger sequencing, done by Eurofins (Ebersberg) Mix2Seq-Kit. With the chromatograms possible knockouts can be identified by using online tools such as ICE (Synthego) or TIDE.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nFor further analysis on protein level, methods like Western Blot or FACS are suitable.\nPrepare your samples according to the manufacturers guide for sanger sequencing. We used the forward primers as sequencing primers.\nCritical: Please note, that one sequence of your wild type is also needed for analysis\nUpload your data to given online tools and identify potential knockouts.\nConfirm the knockout on protein level."
