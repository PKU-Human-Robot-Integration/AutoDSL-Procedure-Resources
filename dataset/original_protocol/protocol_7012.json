    "Figure 2 briefly demonstrates the whole procedure described in this protocol. In addition, Figure 3 shows a workflow describing detailed steps for analyzing different ascorbate turnover enzyme activities.Grow rice plants in the climate-controlled glasshousePlace 15-20 seeds on the filter paper soaked with deionized water in one Petri dish; seal the Petri dish with parafilm and germinate in the dark at 30°C for three days.Fill the 2 L pots with rice growth soil and soak the soil thoroughly with tap water.Carefully transplant the 3-day-old rice seedlings into 2 L pots, each pot with one seedling.Note: Be gentle not to damage the seedlings and cover the roots with 1-2 cm soil. Set up the rice growth conditions as following: day/night temperature, 28/22°C; relative humidity, 60-70%; light intensity, 500-600 µmol m-2 s-1; and day/night period, 8/16 h (short-day).Check the growth pots regularly to ensure sufficient standing water; apply 20 ml of 15 g/L Peter Excel fertilizer solution weekly to each tray from when the seedlings are 2 weeks old.Harvest and flash-freeze the aboveground shoots of 3-week-old plants with liquid nitrogen.Grind around 1-2 g of harvested samples to a fine powder using pre-chilled pestle and mortar; store them in the sterile 15 ml Falcon tubes and place them in the -80°C freezer upon extraction.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4190/bioprotoc-11-20-4190-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative photos summarizing the working procedure described in this protocol. (A) Germinate 15-20 seeds on soaked filter paper at 30°C in the dark for 3 days. (B) Transplant 3-day-old seedlings into pots filled with rice growth soil. (C) Grow the plants for 3 weeks and harvest the shoots with liquid nitrogen. (D) Grind the plant sample in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar. (E) Weigh 80-100 mg of sample into centrifuge tubes and add extraction buffer. (F) Transfer the supernatant into a new tube after centrifugation at 4°C.",
    "(G) Set up the enzymatic reaction by mixing assay buffer, plant extracts, and reaction substrate; monitor the substrate/product change through absorbance kinetics measurement.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4190/bioprotoc-11-20-4190-g003.jpgFigure 3. Summary of the assay steps for ascorbate-turnover enzyme activities described in this protocol. Grind plant material into a fine powder with liquid nitrogen for further assays. Apply extraction buffer to prepare plant extracts for target enzymatic assay. The gray background highlights the steps for both AO-SF and AO-IBF activities. APX (highlighted with green background) and MDHAR (highlighted with blue background) assays share the same extraction steps, while the assay steps are different. The yellow background highlights the steps for DHAR assay. Further details of assays and enzymatic calculations are described in the following sections (see Procedures B-D, Data analysis, and Recipes).AO-SF, ascorbate oxidase soluble fraction; AO-IBF, ascorbate oxidase ionically bound fraction; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; MDHAR, monodehydroascorbate reductase; DHAR, dehydroascorbate reductase.AO activity assay for the soluble and ionically bound fractionWeigh 80 mg of ground samples in pre-chilled 2 ml centrifuge tubes; add 1 ml of AO extraction buffer for soluble fraction (AO-SF).Vortex the mixture vigorously for 30 s and place the tubes on ice.Centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.Transfer the supernatant into new 1.5 ml tubes for AO soluble fraction activity assay; centrifuge the supernatant again for 1 min to clear the extracts.Note: We recommend analyzing the samples immediately after extraction. However, extracted samples can be stored in -20°C freezer for up to one week or in -80°C freezer for up to one month before analysis. Steps B5-B6 are for AO ionically bound fraction extraction; assay steps are identical for both soluble and ionically bound fractions of AO. Resuspend the pellets with 1 ml of AO extraction buffer for ionically bound fraction (AO-IBF); vortex vigorously for 20 s.",
    "Centrifuge the extracts at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant into new 1.5 ml tubes placed on ice.Mix 80 µl of AO assay buffer and 10 µl of plant extract in the UV-transparent 96-well microplate; prepare two analytical replicates for each sample.Start the reaction by adding 10 µl of 2 mM AsA using a multichannel pipette; mix well by pipetting up and down 6-8 times.Monitor the kinetics of absorbance at 265 nm for 5 min at 25°C.Prepare a series of BSA standard solutions using AO extraction buffer: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/ml.Note: To determine protein concentration in AO soluble fraction extracts, use AO-SF extraction buffer (without 1 M NaCl, see Recipes) to dissolve BSA; for AO ionically bound fraction extracts, use AO-IBF extraction buffer (with 1 M NaCl, see Recipes) to dissolve BSA. Mix 25 µl of BSA standards or plant extracts with 475 µl Bradford reagent solutions; vortex for 15 s and incubate the mixture for 10 min at RT.Load 100 µl of the reaction mixture into a 96-well microplate (non-UV transparent) and measure the absorbance at 595 nm wavelength; prepare two analytical replicates for both standards and plant extracts.APX and MDHAR activity assayNote: Use the same extraction buffer to prepare plant extracts for both APX and MDHAR assay. Weigh 100 mg of sample into pre-chilled 2.0 ml tube; add 1 ml of APX/MDHAR extraction buffer.Vortex vigorously for 30 s and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.Transfer the supernatants into 1.5 ml tubes placed on ice; centrifuge for an additional 1 min to clear the extracts.Note: We recommend analyzing the samples immediately after extraction.",
    "For APX and MDHAR activities assay, plant extracts are not suitable for a long period of storage in freezing conditions, which will decrease the enzymatic activities. For the APX assay, thoroughly mix 80 µl of APX assay buffer and 10 µl of plant extracts in the UV-transparent microplate by pipetting up and down 6-8 times; prepare two analytical replicates for each sample.Start the reaction by adding 10 µl of 0.03% (V/V) H2O2 solution; monitor the absorbance kinetics at 290 nm for 1 min at 25°C.Note: The reaction is very rapid. Place the microplate in the reader, ready for immediate absorbance detection. For the MDHAR assay, mix 80 µl of MDHAR assay buffer and 10 µl of plant extracts in the UV-transparent plate by pipetting up and down 6-8 times.Start the reaction by adding 10 µl of 1 mM NADH; monitor the absorbance kinetics at 340 nm for 2 min at 25°C.Note: The total protein concentration in the extracts for both APX and MDHAR assay are the same. Prepare a series of BSA standard solutions with APX/MDHAR extraction buffer: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml.Mix 25 µl of BSA standard solution or plant extract with 475 µl of Bradford reagent in a 1.5 ml tube; vortex for 15 s and incubate at RT for 10 min.Load 100 µl of the protein assay mixture into a 96-well microplate (non-UV transparent) and measure the absorbance at 595 nm; prepare two analytical replicates for each standard or sample.DHAR activity assayWeigh 100 mg of sample in pre-chilled 2 ml tubes; add 1 ml of DHAR extraction buffer.Vortex vigorously for 30 s and centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.Transfer the supernatants into new 1.5 ml tubes placed on ice; re-centrifuge for 1 min to clear the extracts.",
    "Note: We recommend analyzing the samples immediately after extraction. However, plant extracts can be stored in -20°C freezer for up to one week or -80°C freezer for up to one month before analysis. Mix 70 µl of DHAR assay buffer, 10 µl of plant extracts, and 10 µl of 5 mM DHA solution into UV-transparent microplate by pipetting up and down 6-8 times; use DHAR extraction buffer for blanks; prepare two analytical replicates for each sample.Note: It is essential to include the blanks in the DHAR assay since GSH can reduce DHA in the absence of DHAR. Start the reaction by adding 10 µl of 50 mM GSH solution to the mixture; monitor the absorbance kinetics at 265 nm for 5 min at 25°C.Prepare a series of BSA standards using DHAR extraction buffer: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/ml.Mix 25 µl of BSA standards or plant extracts with 475 µl Bradford reagent by vortexing for 15 s; incubate the mixture at RT for 10 min.Load 100 µl of the mixture into the microplate (non-UV transparent) and measure the absorbance at 595 nm; prepare two analytical replicates for each standard and sample."
