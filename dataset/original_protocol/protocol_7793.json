    "Extraction  This protocol applies to extraction of intracellular (vacuolar) APases from plant tissues and suspension cell cultures (e.g., Tran et al., 2010a; Veljanovski et al., 2006). Refer to Tran et al. (2010b) and Robinson et al. (2012) for information on the isolation and analysis of plant cell wall localized and secreted APase isoforms.     Weigh tissue and freeze in liquid N2. Store at -80 °C until use.    Place a small spatula of sea sand into the mortar, add small amount of liquid N2, followed by frozen tissue, and grind to a powder. Carefully add more liquid N2 if needed to keep frozen.   Invert tube with extraction buffer (EB) to mix and add to sample at a ratio of 1:2, w/v (e.g. 0.5 g powdered tissue + 1.0 ml EB) although this may need to be increased to 1:3 for leaf tissue and 1:4 for roots. Grind for several minutes and place in 1.5 ml microfuge tubes.   Centrifuge 5 min at 4 °C and 11,000 x g. Remove supernatant (clarified extract) to a fresh microfuge tube and keep it on ice. Measure APase activity immediately at room temperature (24 °C). Aliquots of clarified extracts can be snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C for future use.       APase activity assay 1   Conveniently measure APase activity by coupling the hydrolysis of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate to the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction at 24 °C and using a spectrophotometer to continuously monitor NADH oxidation at 340 nm. PEP seems to be an excellent APase substrate for since it occupies the highest position on the thermodynamic scale of phosphorylated intermediates (and thus its P atom is an excellent leaving group). For every PEP molecule hydrolyzed to pyruvate, one NADH molecule is oxidized to NAD+ by LDH as shown in Figure 1.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130828/20130828203123_6020.",
    "jpg Figure 1. APase activity can be conveniently deterdmined by coupling the hydrolysis of PEP to pyruvate to the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction and using a spectrophotometer to continuously monitor NADH oxidation to NAD+ at 340 nm     Accurately pipette 1-10 μl of clarified extract into a microplate well. We prefer to use a 10 or 25 μl Hamilton syringe as opposed to automated pipetors for accurate pipetting of enzyme protein extracts into wells of the microtitre plate.   Use repeat pipetor to add 200 μl APase assay mix #1 to each well and immediately place in microplate spectrophotometer. Continuously monitor NADH oxidation to NAD+ as a decline in absorbance at 340 nm (A340), taking readings every 5-10 sec for up to 5 min.    Correct for background NADH oxidation by omitting PEP from the reaction mixture. Ensure that the decline in A340 (amount of NADH being oxidized; ε340 = 6,220/M/cm) is proportional to assay time and concentration of enzyme assayed. Dilution of clarified extract in extraction buffer (lacking PVPP) may be necessary for samples containing abundant APase activity. Note: One international unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme resulting in the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate (e.g. one μmol of NADH oxidized to NAD+) per min at 24 °C. APase activity in (U/ml clarified extract) = (ΔA340/min x clarified extract dilution factor)/6.22. Thus, if 2.0 μl of clarified extract mixed with 200 μl of APase reaction mixture yields a ΔA340/min of 0.1 at 340 nm, then the APase activity = (0.1 x 100)/6.22 U/ml = 1.6 U/ml.       APase activity assay 2  This is a ‘stopped-time’ APase assay based upon the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate, para-nitrophenyl-phosphate (pNPP), to para-nitrophenol (pNP) and Pi (Figure 2).",
    "The pNP product forms a yellow color at alkaline pH (λmax = 410 nm; extinction coefficient = ε410 = 18.2/mM/cm; meaning a 1 mM solution of pNP should have an A410 of 18.2). The amount of yellow color formed is thus directly proportional to the amount of pNP produced and is therefore an indicator of the APase activity. This assay tends to be more popular in the APase literature. However, care needs to be taken to ensure that the amount of pNP being formed is proportional to the assay time and volume of clarified extract being assayed.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130904/20130904194920_1454.jpg Figure 2. APase activity is often assayed spectrophotometrically at 410 nm by determining the amount of pNP produced following the hydrolysis of Pi from pNPP. Addition of NaOH after a specified assay time (e.g., 10 min) serves to stop the APase reaction while simultaneously converting the product p-nitrophenol into the yellow colored p-nitrophenolate (λmax = 410 nm).       Accurately pipette 1-10 μl of clarified enzyme extract into a well of the microtitre plate. Add 200 μl of APase assay mix #2 to each well containing enzyme extract and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (24 °C).    At t = 10 min, add 50 μl of 3 M NaOH to each well containing APase reactions. This stops the reaction (denatures APase) while simultaneously converting pNP product into the yellow colored p-nitrophenolate.    Determine ΔA410/min for each well to determine the amount (μmol) of pNP formed per min.      Bradford Assay of Soluble Protein Concentration   Prepare standard curve using the template below: table:",

Dilute sample if necessary to remain in linear range of standard curve. A 25 μl Hamilton syringe is more accurate than automated pipetors for pipetting of BGG standard and clarified extract into wells of the microtitre plate.   Add 250 μl of Bradford working solution to each well using a repeat pipetor and read A595 of protein standards and unknowns. Ensure that A595 values of clarified extract samples aliquot falls within range of A595 values of the BGG standards. The absorbance maximum for an acidic solution of Coomassie Brilliant blue G-250 shifts from 465 nm to 595 when protein binding occurs. Determine amount of protein in clarified extract aliquot from the standard curve (if 2 μl aliquot of clarified extract yields an A595 value equivalent to 5 μg of protein, then the extract would have a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml)."
