    "This study did not need approval to perform or any sort of consent from the patients to use and publish their data, because all the data and information in this study and video were anonymized.\n1. Collection of image data\nScan the patient's thyroid by enhanced computerized tomography (CT) to obtain the image data in DICOM format. Ensure that this process is done within 1 week before the operation and control the slice thickness so that it is ≤1 mm.\n2. Processing of DICOM data\nImport the scanned patient image data into the software (see Table of Materials) and set the appropriate threshold according to the difference in gray value between the thyroid gland and surrounding tissues or organs. As different gray values are reflections of differences in the density of different areas of the human body, set the grayscale threshold (unit: hu; on the software) to 226-1,500 to present the bone image; set the threshold to -200-226 to show the thyroid gland image. Let the software automatically identify the boxed area, or manually outline the boundary of the target area if the recognition is not satisfactory.\n\tNOTE: Mimics automatically select the thyroid region and use the 3D region growth technology to segment the image and calculate the 3D reconstruction. At the same time, the 3D image is optimized to reduce the roughness and the sense of steps to obtain a natural, smooth, and authentic 3D digital visualization model, which enables a more straightforward observation of the 3D model for surgeons.\nGenerate STL files from the reconstructed data model. Choose the reconstructed model in the software, click Export in the file dock, and choose STL as the exporting file format. Finally, generate the STL files successfully.\n3. Medical-engineering interaction",
    "Send the reconstructed 3D model preview to the doctors, who will confirm the applied requirements and anatomical structure of the 3D model and give feedback to the modeling engineer if a modification is needed. After receiving confirmations from the doctors, proceed to the production preparation stage.\n4. 3D printing (Supplemental File 1)\nTransfer the STL file data to the colorful material 3D printer and complete the parameter presets (such as printing mode, slice stroke thickness, support method, and model coloring) through the supporting 3D printing slicing software.\n\t\nSelect the printing model according to the type of finished products (color printing models usually use White Jet Process technology, while photosensitive resin usually uses Digital Light Procession).\nSelect slice stroke thickness parameter according to the thickness of the products (here, from 24 µm to 36 µm).\nChoose the support method according to the fineness of the printing model: Overall support (better protection and less damage to fine details) or Partial support (which saves materials).\nSelect model coloring using the color palette function on the printer. Unify the arteries with red color 255 and the veins with blue color 255.\n\t\tNOTE: As other parts such as the tumor lesion are not strictly standard, surgeons can select a color according to their needs or preference.\nFill in hard light curing resin in the 3D printer (see Supplemental Table S1), debug the printing platform, and print using White Jet Process technology. After printing, take out the preliminary printed thyroid model.",
    "​NOTE: The White Jet Process technology is based on the principle of inkjet printing, where a thin layer of photosensitive resin is printed out in one jet and then irradiated with a specific wavelength of UV light, causing a rapid polymerization reaction and curing of the photosensitive resin. This process is completed layer by layer until the print is complete.\n5. Post-treatment\nSubtract the support structure of the preliminary printed thyroid model. Grind, varnish, and cure the semi-manufactured product to obtain an individualized 1:1 isometric 3D-printed thyroid model.\n\t\nSubtracting support structure\n\t\t\nWearing gloves, break apart the wrapping supports around the preliminary model and remove most of the main body of the supporting structure.\nPut the model into an ultrasonic cleaner with Ca(OH)2 alkaline solution for a 15 min cleaning.\nPut the model into a wet sandblaster and rinse it until the rest of the support structure on the surface is washed away.\nGrinding\n\t\t\nGrind the model with an electric grinder, file, or grinding wheel.\nVarnishing\n\t\tNOTE: This process consists of spraying and manually painting.\n\t\t\nSpray the varnish into large-area color blocks on half of the surface of the model. Manually paint the small-area color blocks with varnish.\nCuring\n\t\t\nPut the model into a UV curing machine for 30 s of curing.\nTake out the model and clean it with 95% alcohol.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After the alcohol volatilizes completely, the production is finished.\n6. Delivery\nPackage the thyroid model and complete the delivery to the surgeons before surgery.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
