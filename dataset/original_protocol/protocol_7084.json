    "Growing Arabidopsis plants in soilSterilize Arabidopsis seeds with 5% sodium hypochlorite for 7-10 min, and then wash the seeds with sterilized water 5 times; place the sterilized seeds in the dark at 4°C for two days.Note: The cold treatment will synchronize germination. Place the mixed soil in an ultra-low temperature freezer (below -20°C) overnight.Note: Autoclaving soil is usually harmful for seed germination and plant growth in our hands. We therefore used a freezing treatment to kill insect eggs and larvae in the soil to prevent insect infestation during plant growth, without causing any visible effect on seed germination. Place the soil into small plastic pots, cover the pots with mesh, and fix the mesh with a rubber band (Figure 1A).Use a pipette to sow sterilized seeds (from A1, about 200-300 seeds/ml) in the soil (about 20-30 seeds per pot, 4-8 seeds at each corner).Grow plants in environmentally-controlled growth chambers, with relative humidity set at 60%, temperature at 22°C, light intensity at 100 μE⋅m-2⋅s-1 with a 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod.Remove excess seedlings after one week, and keep 4 seedlings per pot.Water the plants with tap water every 2-3 days. Four- to five-week-old plants (Figure 1B) were used for our experiments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4268/bioprotoc-11-24-4268-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Photographs of tissue collapse phenotype for HR assay. Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2) bacteria were infiltrated at OD600 of 0.2 and images were taken about 7 h post infiltration (hpi).Preparing Pst strains for inoculationStreak out the Pst strains from -75°C freezer onto Luria-Marine (LM) solid medium containing antibiotics, and allow to grow in a 30°C incubator for 2 days.Culture the bacterial strains in 4-6 ml LM liquid medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics [50 mg/L rifampicin for Pst DC3000; 50 mg/L spectinomycin and 50 mg/L rifampicin for Pst DC3000(avrRpt2), which contains the pDSK600-avrRpt2 construct with spectinomycin resistance], shaking at 200 rpm and 30°C for 12-16 h. Note: The bacterial culture should reach mid-log growth phase (OD600 = 0.6-1.0).  Transfer 1.5 ml bacterial culture to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube, and collect by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 2 ml sterilized water to wash.Centrifuge the bacterial solution at 2,500 × g for 5 min, and remove the supernatant, and then resuspend the pellet with 1 ml sterilized water.Adjust the bacterial solution to a cell density of OD600 = 0.2 (~1 × 108 cfu/ml) with sterilized water, measured with a spectrophotometer. For bacterial disease assay  Inoculation of Arabidopsis with Pst strainsDilute the bacterial solution from B6 with sterilized water to a cell density from OD600 = 0.001 (~5 × 105 cfu/ml) to 0.002 (~1 × 106 cfu/ml).",
    "Inoculate 3 marked leaves (from the abaxial side of the leaves) per plant with adjusted bacterial solution using a 1 ml needleless syringe (Figure 1C and Video 1). We estimate that approximately 100-200 μl are necessary to fully infiltrate one adult leaf. We usually inoculate 4 plants for each strain, and inoculate different plants with different strains in each pot.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Syringe infiltration demonstration. Wipe off the solution on the surface of the infiltrated leaves with a paper towel.Keep inoculated plants under ambient humidity for about 1 h to allow evaporation of excess water from the leaf.Cover the tray with a transparent plastic dome to keep high humidity until sampling, and place plants back in the growth chamber for the disease to develop (Figure 1D).Recording the disease symptoms and counting the number of bacteriaHarvest samples after 2-4 days (varies among experiments, due to different plant genotypes/bacterial strains), remove all inoculated leaves from the plants, and take a photo to record the chlorosis and necrosis symptoms (Figure 1E).Select 6-8 leaves that are representative of the symptoms (e.g., the middle level; Figure 1F), and place them in a 75% ethanol solution for ~30 s to kill the bacteria on the leaf surface.Place the leaves on the paper towel to quickly remove excess ethanol, and then rinse the leaves with sterilized water twice (Figure 1G).Dry the leaves with the paper towel, take two leaf discs from each leaf using a cork borer (7.5 mm in diameter) and four discs from two different leaves as one biological repeat, place the leaf discs into a 2 ml Eppendorf tube containing 200 μl of sterilized water and one or two steel balls (5 mm in diameter); collect three to four repeats from each treatment (Figure 1H).",
    "Grind the leaf discs by TissueLyser at 30 Hz, for 1 min.Quickly spin the extracted solutions (5,000 × g, 10 s) to move the solution from the tube caps to the inside of the tube; open the tube and add 800 μl of sterilized water to the tube, briefly vortex, and mix well by Vortex Oscillator (Figure 1I).Serially dilute the bacterial solutions with sterilized water (i.e., by 10×, 100×, 1,000×, etc.), and then take 10 μl from each dilution and place on LM agar plates supplemented with rifampicin (at 50 mg/L). Perform two technical replicates for each sample (Figure 1J), and air dry the plates at room temperature. Note: As 10 μl from 1 ml of the extracted solution were placed on a LM agar plate, this is the equivalent of a 100-fold dilution of the bacteria from 4 leaf discs. If we take 10 μl from 1 ml of the extracted solution to 90 μl of sterilized water and then take 10 μl to place on the LM agar plate, this is equivalent to another 10-fold dilution. Serial 10-fold dilutions are done for each sample by repeating this process. We usually dilute the extracted solution to 10-4, 10-5 and 10-6 for Pst DC3000, and dilute to 10-2, 10-3 and 10-4 for Pst DC3000 (avrRpt2).  Place the air-dried LM agar plates in an incubator at 30°C for colonies to grow.Count the colonies with a stereoscope 24 h after incubation (Figure 1K). It can also be counted by eye if the colonies are well separated and grow to large sizes (e.g., after more than 24 h incubation).",
    "For the hypersensitive response assay  Inoculation of Arabidopsis plants with Pst strainsInoculate 3-4 marked leaves (from the abaxial side of the leaves) per plant with Pst DC3000(avrRpt2) strain at a cell density of OD600 = 0.2 (~108 cfu/ml) using a 1 ml needleless syringe (Figure 1C). Inoculate 4-6 plants for each genotype.Wipe off the solution on the surface of the leaves with a paper towel, let the leaves dry, and place the plants back in growth conditions without cover and under ambient humidity. Check tissue collapse starting from 4-5 h after infiltration.Note: Different effector proteins lead to different ETI response intensities and different rates of HR, so different strains may require distinct observation time for HR. Harvest leaves, count the number of leaves showing cell death, and take a photo (Figure 1L). Note: When cell death occurs, ions will leak out from the cell, and the electrolyte leakage can be measured using a Electrolytic conductivity meter over a time course after infiltration, providing a more quantitative way of assessing HR (protocols described in Hatsugai and Katagiri, 2018)."
