    "Seed target cellsTZM-bl cells: Seed 10,000 TZM-bl cells per well in 96-well flat-bottom plates containing 100 µl complete medium.PBMCs: Seed 200,000 stimulated PBMCs (1 µg/ml PHA + 10 ng/ml IL-2 for 3 days) per well in 96-well flat-bottom plates containing 100 µl complete medium.Note: Fill the outer wells with 200 µl PBS to avoid evaporation of the inner wells containing the cells (Figure 1: wells in grey).Culture 18-24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.The next day, without removing the medium, add 180 µl fresh complete medium containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin (and 10 ng/ml IL-2 for PBMCs).Note: Gentamicin prevents the outgrowth of bacteria that may have contaminated the semen collection container.Dilute HIV-1 stock in the complete medium to achieve a MOI < 1 (e.g., 0.1, 0.01, 0.001).Note: The HIV-1 enhancing activity of semen cannot be observed at high MOIs as all target cells have been already infected in the absence of semen.Thaw semen samples quickly in a 37 °C water bath and immediately dilute in PBS to achieve semen concentrations of 0, 0.8, 4, 20, and 100% (v/v) in a 96-well round-bottom plate.Note: Semen’s enhancing activity is lost over time. Avoid long room temperature exposure.Add 40 µl of respective HIV-1 dilutions to 40 µl semen dilutions (1:1) in a 96-well round-bottom plate to achieve semen concentrations of 0, 0.4, 2, 10, and 50% (v/v).Resuspend HIV-1/semen mixture; add 20 µl to 280 µl (1 to 15) cells in triplicates; the final cell culture concentrations of semen are 0, 0.027, 0.134, 0.67, 3.33% (v/v) (Figure 1).Note: The low semen concentrations on the cells reduce its cytotoxic effect.Incubate for 2-3 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Thereafter, remove the medium and add 200 µl fresh complete medium containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin.",
    "TZM-bl cells: Simple medium change is sufficient.PBMCs: Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g at room temperature, discard 100 µl (of 300 µl) supernatant (without cells), resuspend cells and transfer the entire sample (200 µl) into a 96-well V-bottom plate. Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g at room temperature, discard supernatant, resuspend cells in 200 µl of fresh complete medium with 100 µg/ml gentamicin and 10 ng/ml IL-2 and transfer into 96-well F-bottom plates.Note: Medium change prevents the toxic effects of semen.Incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.After 2 and 3 days, analyze all samples by light microscopy to detect the cytopathic effects (CPE) caused by HIV-1 infection, and the possible cytotoxic effects of semen.Notes: For TZM-bl cells: In this cell line, massive HIV-1 infection results in the formation of syncytia (see Figure 2 or supplementary Figure 1 in Kim et al., 2010). If syncytia are detectable at Day 2, determine the cellular β-galactosidase activities in all samples. Continued incubation of cultures that already show CPE for another 24 h may lead to over-infection and cell loss and should be avoided. If no CPE is detectable at Day 2, incubate cells for another 24 h, and determine reporter gene activities at Day 3 post infection. Final cell culture concentrations of semen of 3.33% are sometimes cytotoxic. Therefore, we greatly recommend running cytotoxicity assay in the absence of virus in parallel. For PBMC: In PBMC, the HIV-1 induced CPE is less pronounced. If syncytia are detectable, determine the luciferase activities in all samples at Day 2. If no CPE is detectable at Day 2, incubate cells for another 24 h, and determine the reporter gene activities at Day 3 post infection.",
    "Note that PBMC are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of semen (Supplementary Figure 17 in Münch et al., 2007). Therefore, we greatly recommend running cytotoxicity assay in the absence of virus in parallel. Determine reporter gene activities:For TZM-bl cells (Figures 3 and 4) using the Gal-ScreenTM β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Assay SystemRemove supernatant.Add 40 µl of lysis buffer together with substrate (mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions).Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Transfer 35 µl of the lysed cells into a white 96-well luminometer plate.Read luminescence as relative light units/s in a luminometer.For PBMCs infected with an HIV-1 reporter virus encoding firefly luciferase using the Luciferase Assay SystemResuspend PBMCs and transfer into a 96-well V-bottom plate.Centrifuge for 5 min, 550 x g at room temperature.Discard supernatant.Add 40 µl of 1x lysis buffer.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Resuspend and transfer 30 µl of the lysed sample into a white 96-well luminometer plate.Add 100 µl substrate.Immediately, read luminescence as relative light units/s in a luminometer.Evaluate raw data (Figures 3 and 4).Calculate average values obtained from non-infected cells (background) (Figure 3B).Subtract average background values from each sample (Figure 3B).Calculate average values and standard deviations of each triplicate measurement (Figures 3C and 4A).Calculate n-fold enhancement values by setting reporter gene activities observed in the absence of semen = 1 (Figures 3D and 4B)."
