    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1: Cell transfection\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step is designed to deliver each plasmid DNA into HEK293 cells to generate individual cell populations expressing selected kinase/DNA fusion proteins.\nPassage HEK-293 cells with DMEM + 10% FBS (growth medium) one day prior to the transfection (2 days prior to assay). Avoid use of cells that have exceeded 50 passages.\nEnsure that cells are 70–90% confluent on the day of transfection\nTrypsinize the cells and inactivate the trypsin using complete growth medium. Centrifuge the cells at 200 × g / 4°C to generate a cell pellet.\nResuspend HEK293 cells for transfection and adjust the cell density to 2 × 105/mL in Opti-MEM + 1% FBS.\nAdd 100 μL/well of HEK293 cells to each well of a TC-treated, 96-well plate.\nPrepare Transfection complexes.\nEstimate the required volume of transfection complex, determine the number of data points needed for each kinase. The following controls or conditions are recommended:\nCritical: Zero BRET Control: NanoLuc® control vector (lacking a kinase fusion) must be used for each experiment to define 100% Fractional Occupancy.\nNote: NanoLuc® control vector must be diluted in Transfection Carrier DNA prior to use. Dilute 1 part NanoLuc® control vector to 9 parts Transfection Carrier DNA. This DNA solution should then be diluted with TE Buffer to the same final working concentration (20μg/mL) as the kinase plasmids prior to creating transfection complexes.\nNote: Include this control on each assay plate. If desired, Tracer can be added to these wells to prove that there is no nonspecific BRET observed from the tracer.\nCritical: 100% BRET Control: This is Tracer + DMSO but without test compound. Use this control for each kinase to define 0% Fractional Occupancy.",
    "Technical replicates (recommended) can be used for each control and test compound sample\nTransfection Control (recommended): Use this control to determine if the transfection was successful prior to executing the complete NanoBRET assay. Process this sample prior to the assay setup on day 2. Prepare this transfection on a separate plate. Transfect at least 4 wells for this purpose. The MET-NanoLuc plasmid is an ideal DNA for this purpose. Dilute the MET-NanoLuc control plasmid into Carrier DNA to match the conditions used for the experimental sample.\nAssemble 2× Kinase DNA solutions and transfer to a sterile 96-well polypropylene plate:\nNote: For each well of analysis, you will require 3 μL of each 2× Kinase DNA solution at 20μg/mL.\nNote: If frozen, we recommend thawing the DNA quickly at 37°C and centrifuging the plate or strip briefly to ensure the solution is at the bottom of the vessel.\nPrepare 2× Fugene HD solution:\nDilute Fugene HD to a final concentration of 60μL/mL in room temperature (22°C–26°C) OptiMEM in a sterile conical tube, directly into the liquid.\nNote: For each well of analysis, prepare 3 μL of 2× Fugene HD solution.\nAdd equal parts of the 2× Fugene HD solution to the 2× Kinase DNA solutions.\nMix on an orbital shaker for 15 s at 400 rpm.\nAllow complexes to form for 30 min at room temperature.\nNote: For experienced users, the cells can be prepared during this step.\nTransfer 5 μL per well of the Transfection Complex into 100 μL/well of the 96-well plate with the HEK293 cells.\nIncubate 16–24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nNote: Allow a minimum of 16 h for transfection to occur, ideally between 20–24 h.\nDay 2: Verify transfection efficiency with the transfection control samples\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Prepare 3× Complete NanoBRETTM Nano-Glo® Substrate (included in the NanoBRET(TM) K10 Complete Kit) in OptiMEM without serum or phenol red. This solution consists of a 1:166 dilution of NanoBRETTM Nano-Glo® Substrate plus a 1:500 dilution of Extracellular NanoLuc Inhibitor in OptiMEM without serum or phenol red. Mix gently by inverting 5–10 times in a conical tube. (The final concentration of Extracellular NanoLuc inhibitor in the 3× solution is 60 μM, for a working concentration of 20 μM.)\nNote: 3× solutions should be used within 1.5 h of preparation.\nTo wells with transfected cells: Add 50μL per well of 3× Complete NanoBRETTM Nano-Glo® Substrate with NanoBRETTM Extracellular Inhibitor for a 96-well plate. Incubate 2–3 min at room temperature (RT).\nTo the empty wells that are on the opposite side of the plate: Add 50μL per well of 3× Complete NanoBRETTM Nano-Glo® Substrate with NanoBRETTM Extracellular Inhibitor for a 96-well plate. Incubate 2–3 min at RT. Note that measuring background wells adjacent to sample wells may result in signal bleed through. Therefore, to accurately quantify background luminescence, use wells of the plate that are not adjacent to wells that contain NanoLuc expression..\nFollowing addition of NanoBRETTM Nano-Glo® Substrate, measure donor emission (e.g., 450 nm) and acceptor emission (e.g., 610 nm or 630 nm) using a NanoBRET™-compatible luminometer.\nDetermine the signal-to-background (S/B) in the 450 nM channel.\nCalculate S/B.\n450 nm relative light units (RLUs) (transfected cells + NanoGlo reagents) / RLUs (NanoGlo reagents alone)\nThe S/B should be >1000 to support proceeding with a large scale assay. Ideally, S/B is 1 × 104–1 × 105.\nCellular treatment of compounds and NanoBRET(TM) tracer\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "This step is required for the cellular system to achieve equilibrium. This involves introduction of NanoBRET(TM) Tracer K10 at concentrations appropriate to quantify occupancy of each kinase. NanoBRET(TM) tracers generally equilibrate after short incubation times, however 2 h is recommended as a general incubation time for most kinase inhibitors. Longer incubations may be required for slow-binding inhibitors.\nAddition of NanoBRET tracers\nBased on the plate layout, calculate the number of data points needed for each concentration bin.\nRefer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for a list of the four tracer conditions recommended (25 nM, 100 nM, 250 nM, 1000 nM). These concentrations are recommended based on kinase affinity measurements.\nCritical: For quantitative target engagement analysis, use NanoBRET(TM) tracers at or below their apparent affinity for each kinase. Therefore, tracer concentration should not exceed the values provided in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Although increasing tracer concentration will often produce a stronger BRET signal, the occupancy results may deviate due to over-saturation of the kinase target with tracer.\nPrepare Complete 20× NanoBRET(TM) Tracer Reagent.\nFirst, prepare the 100× solution of the NanoBRET(TM) Tracer in DMSO.\n1 μM concentration bin: Prepare 100 μM tracer (1:4 dilution of master stock)\n250 nM concentration bin: Prepare 25 μM tracer (1:16 dilution of master stock) into DMSO)\n100 nM concentration bin: Prepare 10 μM tracer (1:40 dilution of master stock into DMSO)\n25 nM concentration bin: Prepare 2.5 μM tracer (1:160 dilution of master stock into DMSO)\nFrom the 100× Tracer solutions, add tracer dilution buffer to generate 20× Complete Tracer Dilution Buffer\nDilute 1 part 100× tracer with 4 parts tracer dilution buffer",
    "Note: To prepare the Complete 20× NanoBRETTM Tracer Reagent, add the concentrated tracer stock and DMSO into a conical tube first, then mix. Then, to the resultant solution, add the Tracer Dilution Buffer and mix. For dispensing, add 20× tracer into a polypropylene (not polystyrene) trough.\nAdd 5μL of Complete 20× NanoBRET(TM) Tracer Reagent (+ tracer) per well to transfected cells, directly into the liquid.\nMix on an orbital shaker for 15 s at 900 RPM at room temperature.\nAddition of test compounds\nPrepare 10× test compounds in OptiMEM\nDilute the test compound to 1000× in DMSO (or the test compound solvent). Example fractional occupancy profiling data is shown below for crizotinib (1 uM final concentration) or CC1 (300 nM concentration).\nDilute the 1000× test compound to 10× in Opti-MEM.\nNote: For the DMSO control (100% BRET Control), dilute 10μL DMSO to 1mL with OptiMEM\nAdd 10μL per well of 10× test compound or 10μL of the DMSO control to the 96-well plates containing cells with 1× tracer. Mix on orbital shaker for 15 s at 900 rpm.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C + 5% CO2 incubator for 2hr. Allow plate to cool to RT for ∼15 min, then proceed to NanoBRETTM Assay section below.\nImmediately before the BRET measurements, prepare 3× Complete NanoBRETTM Nano-Glo® Substrate in OptiMEM without serum or phenol red. This solution consists of a 1:166 dilution of NanoBRETTM Nano-Glo® Substrate plus a 1:500 dilution of Extracellular NanoLuc Inhibitor in OptiMEM without serum or phenol red. Mix gently by inverting 5–10 times in a conical tube. (The final concentration of Extracellular NanoLuc inhibitor in the 3× solution is 60 μM, for a working concentration of 20 μM.)\nNote: 3× solutions should be used within 1.5 h after preparation.",
