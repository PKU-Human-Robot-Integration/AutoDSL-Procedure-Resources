    "1. Fluorescent protein labeling\nMaterial preparation\n\t\nPrepare 1 M Sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0, store it at 4 °C, and use it within one week.\nPrepare 1.5 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride buffer, pH 8.5, immediately before use.\nPrepare a 10 mg/mL solution of fluorescent dye (see the Table of Materials) in dimethylsulfoxide.\n\t\tNOTE: This solution can be stored for a month at -20 °C in the dark.\nPrepare solutions of purified antibodies or other proteins at 1-10 mg/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid buffers containing ammonium ions or primary amines. Replace the buffers containing Tris or glycerol with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by dialysis. Neither sodium azide (≤3 mM) nor thimerosal (≤1 mM) will significantly affect the conjugation reaction.\nIncubate the gel filtration medium (see the Table of Materials) for protein purification in PBS overnight at room temperature or for 2 h at 60 °C. Apply the gel filtration medium onto spin columns with 0.2 µm membranes.\nCalculate the amount of reactive dye to be used for each reaction according to the concentration of protein to be labeled by using Eq (1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63459/63459eq1v4.jpg\n\tWhere Vdye is the volume of the dye stock solution; Cpr, Vpr and MWpr is the concentration, volume and molar weight of the protein; MWdye is the dye molar weight; 100 is a unit conversion factor; MR is the molar ratio of dye to protein in the reaction mixture.\n\tNOTE: The following MRs are recommended for IgG labeling reactions: MR = 40 if the antibody is at 1-3 mg/mL or MR = 30 if the antibody is at 4-10 mg/mL. For coagulation factors, MR = 5 is usually used.\nConjugation reaction\n\t\nIn a reaction tube, mix the protein solution with a 10x lower volume of 1 M bicarbonate solution.\nAdd the required amount of fluorescent dye (see step 1.2) with continuous stirring.",

Transfer the lipid mixture to a round bottom flask. Spread the mixture thinly over the sides of the flask by rotating it. Dry the lipid mix for 30 min under an argon stream.\nHydration of the lipid mixture\n\t\nAdd a suitably warm (~55 °C) aqueous buffer (HEPES 20 mM, NaCl 140 mM, pH 7.4) in a volume corresponding to the expected lipid concentration to the flask with the lipid film. Incubate the mixture with vortexing at 55 °С for 30 min for complete hydration.\nPlacing the sample tube in a freezer or warm thermostat to make the lipid suspension undergo 3-5 freeze-thaw cycles.\nFormation of lipid vesicles by extrusion\n\t\nPrepare the extruder according to the manufacturer's instructions. Warm up all the extruder components to the phase transition temperature of the lipid mixture.\nFill one of the extruder syringes with the hydrated lipid mixture. Wait for 5-10 min for the temperature of the lipid suspension to equilibrate with the temperature of the extruder.",
    "Extrude the lipid mixture through the membrane at least 10 times. For the final extrusion, place the lipid suspension in the alternate syringe and look for a change in appearance from a slightly nebulous to a clear solution.\nStore the resulting mixture of lipid vesicles at 4 °C, preferably in an inert atmosphere of argon or nitrogen, for 3-4 days. Do not freeze.\n3. Isolation of platelets from whole blood\nCollect whole blood from healthy donors in tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate.\nAdd prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (1 µM) and apyrase (0.1 U/mL) to the blood, followed by centrifugation at room temperature at 100 × g for 8 min.\nAfter centrifugation, take the platelet-rich plasma and add sodium citrate solution (106 mM, pH 5.5) to a plasma/citrate ratio of 3:1.

Use a low flow rate and ensure that the threshold for channel FL2 (exсitation 488 nm, emission filter 585/42 nm) is as value 200. Measure the mean fluorescence in channel FL4 (exсitation 633 nm, emission filter 660/20) for the fluorescence dye from the Table of Materials.\n\t\tNOTE: Choose a cytometer without an autosampler. This will speed up the process of injection of the sample into the measuring cell.\nWhen saturation of binding is achieved (no significant increase in fluorescence within 5 min), rapidly dilute the sample 20-fold with Tyrode's buffer, and monitor the dissociation until baseline fluorescence is reached (complete dissociation) or until a plateau is reached (no significant decrease in fluorescence within 5 min).\n\t\tNOTE: As a control, add 10 µM EDTA and monitor complete dissociation for 5 min.\nEquilibrium binding experiments\n\tNOTE: Use the kinetic curve of binding to determine the time to reach saturation; the time for saturation for fX-fd and artificial vesicles is 20 min. \n\t\nIncubate artificial phospholipid vesicles (5 µM) for the binding assay with different concentrations of fX-fd (from 0 to 1,000 nM) in Tyrode's buffer for 20 min.\nDilute each sample from step 4.2.1 by 20x to a final volume of 200 µL with Tyrode's buffer.
