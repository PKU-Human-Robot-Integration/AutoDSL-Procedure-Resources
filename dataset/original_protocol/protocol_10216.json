    "This research was conducted in accordance with current American Psychological Association (APA) professional ethical standards and was approved by the Tufts University Social, Behavioral & Educational Research Institutional Review Board. \nNOTE: The experiment reported in the present manuscript was previously published elsewhere13.\n1. Participant Recruitment, Screening, and Scheduling\nConduct a power analysis to determine the sample size needed to achieve the desired power and detect the expected effect size. The free software package G*Power14 is useful for this step.\nAfter opening G*Power, select F tests from the Test Family dropdown menu.\nSelect ANOVA: Repeated measures, within-between interaction from the Statistical test dropdown menu.\nSelect the A priori option from the Type of power analysis dropdown menu.\nEnter the predicted effect size in the Effect size f box.\nEnter the desired alpha value in the α err prob box.\nEnter the desired power value in the Power (1-β err prob) box.\nEnter 2 in the Number of groups box.\nEnter 2 in the Number of measurements box.\nEnter 0.7 in the Corr among rep measures box13.\nClick Calculate on the bottom right of the window. The total sample size needed for the experiment will be displayed in the Total sample size box.\nRecruit 10-20 participants beyond the recommended sample size to account for participant error or dropout.\nRecruit participants in the desired age range (e.g., 18-24 years old) who are native English speakers, are not color-blind, and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. If interested in a representative sample, recruit both male and female participants.\nNOTE: Women sometimes demonstrate a blunted cortisol response to psychological stress, particularly when in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle or when taking oral contraceptives15. Consider measuring/controlling for female use of contraceptives and menstrual cycle phase (this was not done in the present study).",
    "When scheduling, ensure that participants can attend both testing sessions, which are approximately 1 h each and occur one week apart.\nSchedule participants in groups of two to facilitate peer evaluation during stress induction.\nTo ensure that cortisol samples are not biased by the use of stimulants, ask participants to refrain from stimulant use (e.g., caffeine, nicotine) for 6 h prior to each experimental session. To avoid contamination of saliva samples. Also ask participants to refrain from eating or drinking (besides water) for 1 h prior to each session.\nRandomly assign participants to either learning group: study-practice or retrieval-practice.\nSchedule all participants during roughly the same time of day (e.g., all morning testing or all evening testing) to control for diurnal variability in cortisol16. Schedule each participant’s two experimental sessions for the same time (one week apart).\n2. Construction of Stimuli and Memory Tests\nEncoding stimuli\nIn the interest of creating two dissociable learning events, create two distinct sets of materials for participants to encode.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol involved two 60-item wordlists, one of which was labelled \"The Red List\" and was visually presented in red font, the other of which was labelled \"The Blue List\" and was visually presented in blue font. The wordlists used in the present protocol are available in Supplementary File 1.",
    "For the purposes of stimulus neutrality, ensure that each word meets the following criteria: (1) non-proper noun, (2) not a homograph, (3) four to eight letters long, and (4) concreteness rating of at least 4 on a scale from 1-7 (7 = most concrete). Compare the words to valence and arousal norms17 to ensure that that they have valence ratings between 4.00 and 5.99 on a 1-9 scale (i.e., neutral valence) and arousal ratings lower than 4.00 on a 1-9 scale (i.e., not negatively arousing). Equate word frequencies across the lists by comparing them to an established word database18.\nUse stimulus-presentation software to program each of the wordlists such that words are individually and randomly presented at a rate of 2 s per word.\nNOTE: This protocol used E-Prime version 2.119 for stimulus presentation, but common software can be used to this effect. The E-Prime scripts used for stimulus presentation in the present experiment are available in Supplementary File 2.\nRetrieval stimuli\nTo create plausible foil items for the recognition memory test, create a third 60-item wordlist. Adhere to the criteria outlined in step 2.1.2. The list of foil words used in the present protocol is available in Supplementary File 1.\nMemory tests\nFor the purposes of assessing memory performance both pre- and post-stress, create two functionally-identical memory tests. Construct two 90-item tests.\nNOTE: The present study used recognition tests, in which participants are presented with studied items and foil items and must indicate whether each item occurred on the lists they studied.\nTests consist of 30 items from the red list, 30 items from the blue list, and 30 items from the foil list. Counterbalance or randomize which list items are presented on the two recognition tests. Also randomize the order in which the items are presented.",
    "NOTE: Each item is accompanied by a list-discrimination question and an assessment of confidence. The list-discrimination question asks participants to indicate whether the item came from the red list, the blue list, or neither list. The confidence question asks participants whether they experienced high or low confidence in their list-discrimination judgment.\n3. Stress-induction Protocol\nUse the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G)20 to induce mild, acute psychological stress.\nNOTE: The present protocol adapted the TSST-G to test participants in groups of two instead of four. Psychosocial stress induction of this nature, which involves giving a speech and solving math problems while being evaluated, is preferable to other methods of stress induction because of its ecological validity and ability to elicit a physiological stress response21,22.\nTo induce stress, do the following in this order:\nSpeech preparation\n\t\t\nHave participants sit at separate desks. Give both participants a sheet of blank paper and a pen or pencil. Read them the following instructions:\n\"You will now have two minutes to prepare a speech in which you are applying for a job as a Teaching Assistant* in any course of your choice. Please be prepared to discuss what skills and experiences you have that make you a qualified candidate for the job\"\nNOTE: *If working with non-student populations, change \"Teaching Assistant\" to a population-relevant position.\nUse a stopwatch or clock to time the 2 min period. Set up a video camera on a tripod while participants are preparing their speeches. Take participants' notes away when two minutes have passed.\nSpeech delivery\n\t\t\nRead participants the following instructions:",
    "\"You have each been assigned a number on your desk. I will now call on you by number to stand and give your speech. When I call on you, please stand in the center of the room where you can be seen by the camera. You will be video recorded for the purpose of coding your non-verbal behavior at a later time.\"\nCall on participants one at a time to stand up and deliver their speeches. Use a stopwatch or clock to ensure that each speech lasts for 2 min. If a participant finishes the speech early, tell them that they still have time left and they must continue.\nOral subtraction\n\t\t\nRead participants the following instructions:\n\"I will now call on you at random to solve simple math subtraction problems. When I call on you, please stand and solve the problem aloud. If you get the problem wrong, I will ask you to try again until you get it correct. As a reminder, you will be videotaped during this part of the experiment. Person X, please stand and subtract...\"\n\t\t\tNOTE: Math problems involve subtracting a number in the teens (e.g., 13, 14, 15) from a 4-digit number (e.g., 4,563).\nCall on participants randomly and unpredictably (e.g., sometimes 2-3 times in a row) to solve math problems for 6 min. That is, participants solve math problems multiple times each for a period of 6 min. When participants give an incorrect answer, tell them they are incorrect and ask them to try again. Repeat the question if necessary.\n4. Saliva Sample Collection and Supplies\nNOTE: Saliva collection is only necessary during experimental session 2, in which stress is induced",
    "Ensure that participants have adhered to the instructions outlined in step 1.5. If any of these criteria have been violated, make note of this and examine the participant's data as a potential outlier before conducting any statistical analyses.\nWhen participants first arrive for this session, have them rinse their mouth with water to clear it of any sample contaminants.\nFor the collection of saliva samples, use the passive drool method in which participants pass saliva through a straw into a collection tube. For sample collection, use smoothie-sized straws, cut into 2 inch pieces, and 2 mL cryovials. Ensure that all cryovials are labelled with necessary identifying information (e.g., participant number, sample number, date).\nFor each sample, have the participant place the 2 inch straw in the cryovial and drool into the straw until they have provided 2 mL of saliva. When they have finished providing a sample, have them discard the straw in a wastebasket and screw the cap on the cryovial. Offer participants gloves and sanitizing wipes before they provide each saliva sample.\nCollect three saliva samples: (1) a baseline sample after participants arrive for session 2, (2) a sample immediately after stress induction is complete (~12 min after the onset of stress), and (3) a sample 25-30 min after the onset of stress induction, when cortisol reaches its peak post-stress levels in saliva12.\nStore the saliva samples in a freezer (0 °F) until analyzed.\n5. Subjective Stress Measure\nChoose a measurement of self-reported state anxiety/stress to administer at various times during the experiment.",
    "NOTE: The present protocol used the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA)23. The STICSA is a state measure of the cognitive and somatic sensations associated with anxiety. Statements are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale, and responses are added for a total score that ranges from 0-80 (higher scores are indicative of greater anxiety).\nBefore administering each iteration of the STICSA, inform participants that it is a measure of anxiety and they should respond based on how they are feeling in the moment.\n6. Encoding Procedure (Experimental Session 1)\nInstruct participants to read the informed consent form and, if they choose to participate, sign and return it to the experimenter.\nInstruct participants that that they will be presented with a series of words that they must try to remember for a later test.\nPresent participants with either the Red List or the Blue List using the stimulus-presentation software and rate of presentation outlined in section 2.1.\nThe next step depends on group assignment.\nFor participants in the study-practice group, present the same list two more times at the same rate of presentation. To clear working memory between each study event, have participants complete simple math problems for 30 s (e.g., 12 x 4). Either have participants complete this task with pencil and paper or embed the task into the computer program used for stimulus presentation.\nNOTE: The scripts included in Supplementary File 2 have all encoding tasks embedded within them.",
    "For participants in the retrieval-practice group, give them two time-matched (i.e., 2 min) free-recall tests. Prior to the two tests, instruct participants that they should recall as many words as possible from the preceding list, in any order. During free recall, either have participants type their responses using the stimulus-presentation software program or have them write their responses on a sheet of paper. To clear working memory, have participants complete simple math problems between initial presentation of the wordlist and the first test, as well as between the two free-recall tests (see step 6.4.1).\nPresent participants with a 30 min clip from an emotionally-neutral movie or television show.\nNOTE: The present protocol used the BBC television series Planet Earth. This 30 min delay helps establish a temporal distinction between learning the Red List and learning the Blue List.\nRepeat steps 6.3 and 6.4 for the list that was not presented prior to the 30 min break.\nNOTE: Steps 6.3 through 6.6 are depicted in Figure 1.\nHave participants complete a first iteration of the STICSA to determine whether study practice and retrieval practice differentially influenced anxiety levels.\n7. Retrieval Procedure (Experimental Session 2)\nFollow steps 1.5 and 4.2 to ensure proper saliva sample collection.\nInstruct participants to fill out a second STICSA as a pre-stress measure of subjective anxiety.\nInstruct participants to provide the first saliva sample.\nAdminister one of the two tests constructed in section 2.3.\nNOTE: The tests are depicted in Figure 2.\nComplete the stress-induction procedure as specified in section 3.2.\nInstruct participants to complete the third STICSA as a post-stress measure of subjective anxiety.\nInstruct participants to provide the second saliva sample.\nGive participants a 10 min break. In the present protocol, participants watched part of an episode of The Office during this break.",
    "Instruct participants to provide the third saliva sample.\nAdminister the second test constructed in section 2.3 (depicted in Figure 2).\nDebrief participants about the purpose of the experiment and excuse them.\n8. Computing Dependent Measures\nAfter the conclusion of data collection, compute the dependent measures as follows:\nCalculate hit proportions. For each participant, divide the number of studied items that participants correctly recognized by the total number of studied items that were presented on the recognition test.\nCalculate false-alarm proportions. For each participant, divide the number of non-presented foil words that participants falsely recognized by the total number of foils that were presented on the recognition test.\nCalculate source-memory scores. For each participant, divide the total number of hits that participants attributed to the correct source by their total number of hits.\nFor average confidence, code the high- and low-confidence judgments as binary, with 1 representing high confidence and 0 representing low confidence. For each participant, calculate their proportion of high-confidence judgments.\nCalculate gamma correlations. For each participant, correlate their accuracy on each list-discrimination question with each accompanying confidence rating.\nCalculate delta cortisol. For each participant, subtract their baseline cortisol concentration from the cortisol concentration of the sample taken 25 min post-stress."
