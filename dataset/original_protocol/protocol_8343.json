    "All methods involving living animals have been approved by the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act.\n1. Preparations\nDesign and build an appropriate insertion tool transiently carrying the silicon probe and the electrode connector during the process of implantation. See Figure 1 for an example custom built insertion tool.\nCarefully release the silicon probe and electrode connector from its packaging using ceramic-tipped forceps.\nLift the connector board and securely fix it with a crocodile clamp attached to a stand.\nUsing a stereoscope, align the probe with the insertion tool with ceramic-tipped forceps. Apply a ~2 mm layer of paraffin wax melted with a cauterizer to glue the probe to the insertion tool. Take care not to touch the probe shanks during this procedure.\nFix the electrode connector to the shaft of the insertion tool using standard adhesive tape. Note that depending on the manufacturer, ground wires might need to be soldered to the electrode connector board prior to implantation. Remove the insulation from two short pieces of varnish-insulated copper wire using tin-solder applied with a soldering iron (400 °C). Solder the ground wires to the appropriate slots in the electrode connector board.\nRemove the insulation of two additional pieces of copper wire. Wrap each bare copper wire three times around a stainless steel screw (1 mm diameter, 2 mm length). Apply flux suitable for soldering steel and solder the copper wire to the bottom of the screw cap. Make sure that the bottom half of the screw thread remains free of tin-solder.\nUse a standard multimeter to check for electrical contact between wire and screw.\nDisinfect the shanks of the silicon probe and the ground screws by immersion in 70% ethanol (10 s).",
    "Prepare a protective cover for the probe implant by cutting the head of a plastic Pasteur pipette in half.\n2. Implantation Surgery\nSterilize surgical instruments (scissors, fine-tipped forceps, surgical clamps) with a hot bead sterilizer. Wipe all surfaces with 70% ethanol.\nInduce anesthesia with 3% isoflurane in oxygen delivered at ~1 L/min.\n\t\nFor maintenance, use 1 - 1.5% isoflurane. Note that the isoflurane concentration required to achieve surgical tolerance can vary from animal to animal.\nStable surgical tolerance is achieved when the animal fails to respond to toe-pinching. Monitor the breathing rate of the mouse and adjust the concentration of isoflurane if necessary.\nApply ointment to the animal's eyes to prevent drying out.\nMount the mouse in a stereotaxic frame by gently inserting ear bars into the ear canal. Once the head of the mouse is stabilized by the ear bars, place a mouth piece over the snout for continuous isoflurane delivery. Place the mouse on towel or pad over a heating pad and inject buprenorphine subcutaneously (0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg body weight) to ensure postoperative analgesia.\nShave the head with a standard shaver and disinfect the skin with 70% ethanol. Using surgical scissors, make an incision into the skin along the midline of the skull and open the skin using surgical clamps.\nAlign the head of the animal with the aid of a stereotaxic alignment tool to level bregma and lambda. There should be less than 50 µm of height offset between bregma and lambda. Furthermore, level the head along the mediolateral axis by measuring the depth from bregma at the skull surface at defined distances left and right (e.g., 1 mm left and right of bregma). Adjust the tilt of the head if necessary.\nClean the head with 3% hydrogen peroxide and wipe dry with sterile cotton wipes.",
    "Determine the location of the craniotomy relative to bregma using an appropriate stereotaxic atlas12.\nUsing a 0.9 mm drill head, drill two screw holes in the bone over the cerebellum to place ground and reference screws. Additionally, 1 - 3 holes for anchoring screws are desirable to stabilize the implant. The location of anchor screws will depend on the location of the craniotomy. For implantation into the hippocampus, place anchor screws over the contralateral parietal and ipsilateral frontal cortex. Insert the screws in the bone using a suitable screwdriver. Take care not to penetrate into the brain.\nPerform the craniotomy by slowly thinning the skull with the drill in a rectangular area around the implantation side. Frequently moisten the bone with sterilized phosphate buffer (PB). The remaining thinned skull can be gently pierced and removed with the aid of a fine (27G) injection needle and a pair of tweezers.\nCarefully pierce the dura mater with a thin (27G) injection needle. Form a small hook by bending the tip of the needle with a pair of tweezers and pull the dura for removal. Apply PB to prevent the brain surface from drying out.\nMount the electrode insertion tool on a stereotaxic holder, zero the probe on bregma, and move the probe to the stereotaxic coordinates over the craniotomy. Slowly penetrate the brain surface. Make sure the probe shafts do not bend. Avoid implanting through blood vessels.\nSlowly lower the probe until ~200 µm above the desired depth. Cover the craniotomy and shanks of the silicon probe with sterilized Vaseline for protection. Apply dental cement to fix the base of the probe to the anchoring screw in the skull.",
    "Right after cement application, slowly move the probe to the target depth. Advancing the last ~200 µm after application of the cement reduces lateral movement of the probe and ensures minimal tissue damage in the target area. Note that the curing time of the cement used can affect this step of the protocol. With quickly curing cement, omit this step and directly implant the probe to the target depth in order to avoid damage to the silicon probe.\nAfter the cement has cured, release the probe from the insertion tool by melting the wax with a cauterizer.\nRelease the connector board from the insertion device and position it at a suitable place on the skull using a crocodile clamp attached to the insertion handle. In case of probe implantation into the hippocampus, place the connector board on the contralateral parietal bone. Fix the connector board to the skull using dental cement.\nSolder the ground and reference wires of the connector board to the wires attached to the two screws over the cerebellum.\nTrim the protective cover to the correct height and place it over the silicon probe. Fix the cover to the connector board and skull using dental cement, avoiding the skin around the exposed skull. Suturing the skin around the implantation site is usually not required.\n3. Recovery After Surgery\nApply appropriate analgesic treatment for at least 2 days (e.g. subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine every 6 h during daytime and in the drinking water overnight combined with carprofen (4 - 5 mg/kg body weight) subcutaneously every 24 h). Single-housing is recommended to prevent damage to the implant.\nAllow at least one week for recovery. Consult with local animal welfare guidelines.\n4. Data Acquisition",
    "Record LFPs from freely moving mice using a suitable data acquisition system connected through a commutator. To acquire LFPs, use a sampling frequency of 1 - 5 kHz. Higher sampling rates (20 - 30 kHz) are required if single-unit discharges are to be recorded along with the LFP.\nStore raw recording files of the individual channels for offline analysis.\n5. Histology\nAfter completion of the recording, deeply anesthetize the animal (e.g. 2 g/kg body weight urethane injected intraperitoneally). Confirm the anesthetic state by lack of response to toe pinching.\nPerfuse the mouse transcardially with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (~1 min) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (~10 min) using standard intracardial perfusion methods13. Before perfusion, electrolytic lesioning of the recording sites might by performed (e.g. by applying 10 - 20 V of constant voltage for up to 1 s). Alternatively, fluorescent dyes applied to the shank tips before implantation can be used to track identification. Testing the various methods for the identification of electrode positions to obtain optimal results with different types of silicon probes is recommended.\nCut brain sections (~100 µm) and stain the slices with 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 µg/mL) followed by three washing steps in PB (each 10 min at room temperature).\nPlace the sections on a microscope slide, apply a drop of embedding medium and cover the section with a cover slip. Let the embedding medium dry overnight at room temperature.\nUsing an epifluorescence or confocal laser-scanning microscope, identify the location of the recording sites.\nTo attempt recovery of the silicon probe for further use, hold the probe with a crocodile clamp and release the probe from the scull by carefully melting the dental cement with a soldering iron (400 °C). Take care not to touch the probe shanks during this procedure!",
    "Wash the probe in hot distilled water (~80 °C, 15 min) followed by enzymatic solution (1% Tergazyme in distilled water, 30 min at room temperature) and another washing step in distilled water (15 min). Note that the success rate of probe recovery is low.\n6. CSD Analysis\nUsing a suitable analysis environment (e.g. Python), convert LFP data of an individual shank to CSD by approximating the second spatial derivative along the shank as\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57714/57714eq1.jpg\n\twhere LFPn,t is the LFP signal on the nth electrode at time t and Δz is the inter-electrode spacing. Note that due to the n-1 and n+1 operations, the CSD of the first and last electrodes of the shank cannot be estimated, which has to be taken under consideration during probe placement. Implement the approximation formula using a short segment of code that computes the CSD signal for each electrode while iterating over time (see Supplemental Code File).\nUse the obtained CSD signal for further analysis (e.g., studying specific frequency bands of brain oscillations by applying band-pass filters).\nSubscription Required.
