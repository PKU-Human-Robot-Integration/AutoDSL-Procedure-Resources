    "1. TRPV1 Mutagenesis\nNote: A minimal TRPV1 construct for spectroscopic analysis26 was built from the full-length cysteine-less channel TRPV127 using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (Figure 1). This cysteine-less minimal TRPV1 construct (referred to as eTRPV1 hereafter) consists of residues 110 - 603 and 627 - 764. eTRPV1 was cloned in pMO (a pcDNA3.1-based vector) for functional analysis and in a recombinant donor vector28 containing 8x histidine-maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tobacco etch virus (TEV) for expression and purification (Figure 2A). eTRPV1 single-cysteine mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. Vector and channel sequences are specified in the Supplementary File 1: Supplementary Methods.\nDesign mutagenesis primers with online tools29.\nMix in a 0.2-mL tube: 5 μL of 10x reaction buffer, 1 μL of dNTP mix (100 mM), 1 μL each of 10 μM forward and reverse oligonucleotides, 1 μL of 100 ng/μL eTRPV1 template DNA26, 1.5 μL of DMSO, 1 μL of mutagenesis enzyme, and 38.5 μL of deionized water.
