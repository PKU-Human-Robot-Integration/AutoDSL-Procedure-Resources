    "1. Participant Screening and Preparation for the Experiment\nRecruit participants who are native English speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They should be free of neurological, psychiatric, and sleep disorders, and may not be taking any medications affecting the central nervous system or sleep architecture. Be sure to recruit a similar balance of male and female participants within the desired age range of interest (e.g., 18 to 35 years old), keeping in mind that changes in sleep architecture can occur as early as the mid-30s 16.\nTo most accurately assess the effects of sleep on cognition, have participants maintain a regular sleep schedule and restrict their alcohol consumption leading up to the study. Ask participants to sleep for at least 7 hr a night and be in bed by 2:00 am for the five nights preceding the study. Also ensure that they restrict their alcohol consumption to a maximum of 2 drinks during the 5 days preceding the study, with absolutely no alcohol consumption the day before or day of the study.\nDuring scheduling, ensure that participants will comply with the guidelines related to the salivary cortisol sample (see also Section 4): They must refrain from physical activity, eating, drinking (anything besides water), smoking, and brushing their teeth for the 2 hr prior to encoding. They must also refrain from drinking water for at least 15 min prior to encoding.\nScheduling participants. If full random assignment is not possible, ensure that participants do not differ in age, scores on the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire17 (MEQ), Beck Depression Inventory18 (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory19 (BAI), and the amount of sleep obtained on the night before retrieval.\n2. Conditions and Experimental Design",
    "Schedule Sleep participants such that the encoding session occurs in the evening (7:00-10:00 pm) and the retrieval session occurs 12 hr later, following a full night of sleep in the laboratory. Schedule Wake participants such that the encoding session occurs in the morning (7:00-10:00 am) and the retrieval session occurs 12 hr later following a full day of wakefulness; ensure that they do not nap between sessions.\nInclude Morning and Evening Short Delay conditions (those that have only a 20-min delay between encoding and retrieval, as compared to a 12-hr delay for the Sleep and Wake groups) in the experimental design to minimize the concern that any differences found between the Sleep and Wake groups are due to the time of testing (morning vs. evening) rather than due to the sleep occurring during the consolidation delay. These Short Delay conditions can also be thought of as “circadian control” conditions.\n\t\nArrange for participants in the Morning Short Delay condition to encode the stimuli between 7:00-10:00 am, and for participants in the Evening Short Delay condition to encode the stimuli between 7:00-10:00 pm. Test the participants 20 min after encoding.\n3. Stimuli Construction\nStimuli construction for encoding. Select stimuli based on the specific experimental question. This protocol focuses on the effects of sleep and cortisol on emotional memory, and as such, the visual stimuli during encoding are scenes composed of either a negative object or a neutral object placed on a neutral background.",
    "Ensure that all emotional stimuli have either been previously rated for valence and arousal20,21, or that they are rated by participants upon completing the study using a Likert scale from 1 to 7. Negative objects should be rated as highly arousing and low in valence (e.g., arousal: 5-7; valence < 3 on 7-point scales with high values indicating high arousal and high positivity, respectively), and neutral objects should be rated as non-arousing and neutral in valence (e.g., arousal < 4; valence: 3-5).\nRandomization and design. Randomly intermix the negative and neutral scenes between blocks (if applicable). The present study employs 2 blocks lasting approximately 10 min each, allowing participants to have a short break to rest their eyes from the eye tracker in between. Breaks may be helpful every 10-15 min for most young adult participants, but if testing a different population (e.g., children), more frequent breaks may be required.\nStimuli construction for retrieval. Select stimuli based on the specific experimental question. Here, memory for the objects is the focus, and as such, participants are presented with objects and backgrounds (half of which were presented during encoding, and half new) separately during retrieval.\n4. Cortisol Procedure\nEnsure that participants have followed all requirements in 1.3: No physical activity, eating, drinking (anything besides water), smoking, and brushing their teeth for the 2 hr prior to encoding, as well as no water for at least 15 min prior to encoding.\nImmediately prior to encoding, instruct participants to rinse their mouths with approximately 1 ounce of water. Remind them not to swallow the water, as to avoid sample dilution.\nHave participants salivate on an oral swab (see Materials) for 2 min.",
    "Upon having participants place the oral swab in the swab storage tube, store the swabs at the approximate temperature of 0 ºF until analyzed.\n5. Eye Tracking/Encoding Procedure\nEye tracking procedure. The eye tracker used here tracks participants’ left eye gaze patterns at 500 Hz (see Materials). Alternative trackers can be used; in order to most accurately assess attention during encoding, follow the instructions of the specific eye tracker used.\n\t\nFirst, ask participants to sit with their chin on the chinrest and forehead up against a bar. Make adjustments to the chair height and chinrest as needed, ensuring that the center of the screen aligns with participants’ eyes.\nEnsure that the eye tracker is accurately tracking participants’ gaze within 1° of accuracy by having each participant complete a calibration task. Ideally, a 9- or 17-point calibration would be used, depending on the system, but a 3- or 5-point calibration may also be sufficient.\nFirst, ask participants to follow a black dot with their eyes as it moves to different points on the screen and to fixate on it when it stops.\nOnce the eye tracker is calibrated accurately, ask participants if they are ready to begin the task, and then press the “record” button.\nEncoding procedure. Ask participants to perform a task that is likely to lead to deep encoding, such as having them indicate via mouse click whether they would approach or back away from the scene (e.g., left = approach; right = back away) if they were to encounter it in real life10. See Figure 2 for a visual depiction of the encoding procedure.",
    "Allow participants to have a short self-determined break (e.g., ~10-60 sec) between blocks so that they may sit back from the eye tracker and rest their eyes prior to continuing. Ask them to indicate when they are ready to continue.\nAnalysis of eye gaze data. To measure participants’ attention to certain parts of the scene, use software to draw Areas of Interest22 (AOIs) around those parts.\n\t\nAfter drawing the AOIs, calculate the proportion of time participants look at the AOI relative to the rest of the scene. Alternatively, count the number of saccades that participants make to that AOI within a certain time frame.\n6. Study-test Delay\nEnsure that the delay length between encoding and retrieval for the Sleep and Wake conditions is equal (e.g., 12 hr), as well as the delay length for the 2 control conditions (e.g., 20 min).\n\t\nFor the Sleep participants, ensure that the 12 hr delay includes approximately 8 hr of sleep. Conversely, ensure that the Wake participants do not sleep or nap during this interval.\nAsk the Morning and Evening Short Delay participants to remain in the laboratory during their 20 min delay. Tell them that they may do whatever they please during this time, provided that they do not nap.\n7. Recognition Procedure\nFollowing the delay period, give participants a memory test.\n\t\nAsk participants to indicate whether the displayed stimulus is “old” (included in a previously studied scene), or “new” (not previously studied) by pressing corresponding keys on a keyboard (e.g., “1” = old; “2” = new)."
