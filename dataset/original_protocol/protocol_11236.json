    "1. Culturing Melanoma Cells and Skin Fibroblasts\nCulturing human melanoma cells\n\t\nCulture human melanoma cells, C816131 under conventional adherent cell culture conditions in complete W489 medium (see step 1.2) in a 37 °C incubator supplied with 5% CO2 as described previously32. Split the cells at a 1:5 ratio when they reach ~90% confluency.\nMelanoma cell culture medium (W489)\n\t\nFor complete W489 medium, use 80% MCDB153 medium, 20% L-15 medium (see Table of Materials), 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 μg/mL insulin, 1.68 mM CaCl2, and 0.11% sodium bicarbonate. For coculture, do not add FBS, insulin, and CaCl2.\nMouse skin fibroblast isolation\n\t\nCut a 1 cm x 1 cm skin fragment from a mouse in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of the institution's Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nDigest the skin by dispase (see Table of Materials) at 4 °C overnight. Strip the dermis from the epidermis and further digest with collagenase (1 mg/mL in DMEM, see Table of Materials) at room temperature (RT) overnight.\nMouse skin fibroblast culturing\n\t\nWash the tissue pellets with PBS and culture them in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in 37 °C/5% CO2. Split the cells at a 1:2 ratio when they reach ~90% confluency.\nTransduce the skin fibroblasts with GFP/lentivirus using standard methods before coculture.\nCharacterization of mouse skin fibroblasts by immunostaining\n\t\nCell preparation for staining\n\t\t\nSeed the skin fibroblasts in 24 well plate at a density of 2 x 104 cells/well. On day 2, wash the cells with PBS 2x and fix them in 2% neutral buffered formalin for 10 min. Remove the formalin and wash the fixed cells with PBS twice.\nImmunostaining",
    "Add 200 μL of blocking solution to each well and incubate the plate for 30 min at RT, then add mouse anti-α-SMA diluted at 1:200 and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Wash with PBS 3x, 5 min each.\nAdd Alex Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:400 dilution and incubate at RT for 1 h. Wash out the antibodies 3x with PBS, 5 min each.\nAdd 1 μg/mL DAPI and incubate at RT for 2 min. Remove DAPI solution and add 500 μL of PBS into each well.\nObserve the cells and take images using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\nPrelabelling fibroblasts and melanoma cells\n\t\nSeed fibroblasts into a 100 mm dish on day 1 so that the cell confluency reaches ~60% the next day. On day 2, remove the culture medium and add GFP/lentivirus (~1:3–1:5 diluted from stock) into regular culture medium with 4 μg/mL of polybrene. Incubate cells in a 37 °C incubator for 6 h, remove the medium and replace with fresh regular culture medium. After 2 days, observe the GFP signal from the cells using a fluorescence microscope. Transduce C8161 cells with DsRed/lentivirus under similar conditions. Protocols for the preparation of GFP/lentivirus and DsRed/lentivirus have been described previously14,34.\n2. Cell Coculture\nSeed the C8161-fibroblast coculture.\n\t\nOn day 0 of the spheroid formation assay, detach both the C8161 and the skin fibroblasts using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Spin down the cells at 250 g for 5 min at RT and wash once with PBS.\nResuspend the cells in cell coculture medium (serum free, insulin free, and calcium free W489 medium mixed with serum free DMEM at a 1:1 ratio). Adjust the cell concentration to 2 x 104 cells/mL.",
    "Mix the C8161 cells with the fibroblasts at a 1:1 ratio and add 2 mL of the cell mixtures to each well of a 24 well plate. Each well should contain 2 x 104 of each type of cells. Each condition should be done in triplicate.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to use a non-tissue culture treated plate (see Table of Materials). Otherwise, the cells will strongly attach to a plate and be unable to from suspending spheroids.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C for 4 h until the cells attach to the plate, and then perform time-lapse imaging or confocal scanning at the indicated time points for each assay.\n3. Live Cell Time-lapse Imaging\nBefore coculture, turn on the time-lapse imaging system (see Table of Materials) following the manufacturer's instructions and let the incubator reach 37 °C and 5% CO2. It usually takes 1 h for the system to reach equilibrium. Carefully place the culture plate on the stage of the microscope inside the incubator and securely lock the door.\nOpen the software of time-lapse imaging system (see Table of Materials) and choose the plate type and manufacturer so the microscope can locate the scanning area accurately. Choose the wells of interest and a 10x objective lens. Choose the settings for the scanning area, the interval time between the scans, and a starting as well as an ending time. In this protocol, the maximum format number for the scanning area for 1 well is 36 and the interval time is 1 h.\nRecord time-lapse imaging from 4–52 h.\n\tNOTE: The starting time, ending time, and duration should be optimized by cell type and the purpose of the experiment.\nWhen completing the image recording, use the time-lapse imaging system software to retrieve the data and export videos or image sets.",
    "4. Confocal Microscopy and 3D Movies\nPlace the cell coculture plate on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (see Table of Materials) and use red and green laser beams. Observe the cells under a 5x or 10x objective lens and choose a spheroid to start scanning.\nUse a 1 µm z-step to scan from the bottom to top of the spheroid. Process the data using image processing software (see Table of Materials) to reconstruct a 3D image that can be further rotated and saved as a 3D movie.\n5. Solo Culture of Melanoma Cells and Formation of 2D Clusters/Aggregates\nSeed 2 x 104 C8161 melanoma cells into each well of a 24 well plate as described in section 2.1. Culture the cells for 7–10 days and photograph them using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\n6. Checking if 3D Spheroids and 2D Cell Clusters/Aggregates are Suspended in the Medium or Attached to the Plates\nFor cell coculture, check the 3D spheroids formed on day 7. For single cell culture, check the 2D clusters/aggregates formed on day 10.\nSet cell culture plates on the platform of an inverted fluorescence microscope. Put a bent needle with a syringe into a well and gently aspirate the culture medium in and out to disturb the culture medium in the wells. Record this process using the movie mode of the movie software (see Table of Materials). The 3D spheroids will be mobile, but the 2D cell clusters/aggregates will remain steadfast.\n7. Confocal Image of 3D Spheroids",
    "NOTE: Cocultured cells start to form spheroids from 48–72 h depending on the type of fibroblasts used. Generally, spheroids enlarge gradually with time. Small spheroids can fuse to form larger spheroids until day 7. After spheroids are stabilized in size, they can last more than 10 days. After that, the spheroids often detach from the bottom of the culture plate and congregate in the center of the wells. During the enlargement of the spheroids, the cells in the center usually die due to insufficient nutrition and/or a toxic microenvironment. Hence, the peak of 3D spheroid formation and timing to image the matured spheroids should be optimized using pilot experiments. For this protocol, confocal microscopy was performed around day 7 when the spheroids were mature and the cells in the center of spheroids were still alive according to the fluorescence and morphology of the cells in the center.\nTo do confocal microscopy, use a green and red laser to scan the spheroids. Determine the scanning area under a 10x objective and move from the bottom to top of the spheroid with a 1 µm z-step.\nGenerate the 3D spheroid formation and rotation videos using the 3D-projection function of the image processing software (e.g., ImageJ).\n8. Intracellular Notch1 Signaling Pathway Activity in Determining Stromal Regulation of Cancer Stem/Initiating Cells\nIsolation and characterization of skin fibroblasts from gain- and loss-of-function Notch1 mice\n\t\nIsolate skin fibroblasts from two pairs of genetically modified mice: Gain-Of-Function Notch1 (GOFNotch1: Fsp1.Cre+/-;ROSALSL-N1IC+/+) mice versus their counterpart control (GOFctrl : FSP1.Cre-/-;ROSALSL-N1IC+/+) mice and Loss-Of-Function Notch1 (LOFNotch1: Fsp1.Cre+/-;Notch1LoxP/LoxP+/+) mice versus their counterpart control (LOFctrl : FSP1.Cre-/-; Notch1LoxP/LoxP+/+) mice31, respectively. Isolate and characterize skin fibroblasts using the protocol described in sections 1.3-1.5.\nTransduce the mouse skin fibroblasts with GFP/lentivirus.",
    "See section 1 for the method to transduce the cells with the lentiviral vector.\nCoculture of fibroblasts and melanoma cells\n\t\nConduct the cell coculture experiment as described in section 2.\nAssessing the effect of intracellular Notch1 pathway activity in the fibroblasts on determining stromal regulation of cancer stem/initiating cells by measuring the sizes of the 3D spheroids\n\t\nCarry out the quantification of spheroid formation under each condition by photographing the spheroids at the time when spheroids are mature (indicated by the stop of growth around day 5–7 depending upon the types of fibroblasts). Measure the sizes of the 3D spheroids using the image processing software.\n9. Testing the Drug Response of Cancer Stem/Initiating Cells Using the 3D Spheroid Assay\nNOTE: CAF can regulate cancer heterogenicity and induce phenotype of cancer stem/initiating cells. CAF also support cancer stem/initiating cells to endure clinical treatments. Cancer stem cells have been shown to be responsible for drug resistance. Therefore, we used this 3D spheroid model to evaluate the drug response of cancer stem/initiating cells. The outcome can assess potential clinical efficacy of anti-cancer medication well.\nDrug administration\n\t\nRight after coculturing the cells in a 24 well plate, prepare the drugs in a serial dilution in culture medium to reach 5x of a desired range of concentrations based on pilot experiments (i.e., 1 nM, 2.5 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM, and 25 nM).\n\t\tAdd 0.5 mL of corresponding drug solutions to each well of the cocultured cells. Treat the control group with regular coculture media as mentioned above.",
    "NOTE: MEK inhibitor is soluble in cell culture media. Therefore, blank controls are 2.5 mL of cell culture medium. However, if the drug is not soluble in aqueous solution and requires solvents such as DMSO, then cell culture media with the same concentration of DMSO should be applied to the control group.\nQuantification of drug response by counting spheroids\n\t\nObserve the treated cells and untreated cells using a fluorescence microscope and photograph the cells every day. Quantify the spheroid formation in the different experimental groups and compare the spheroid-forming ability of the cell cultures under different drug concentrations.\n\t\tNOTE: The spheroids tend to appear ~5−7 days after the coculture. The drug effects will become noticeable at that time point.\nUse fluorescence microscope to image/photograph the spheroids and cells in the wells and then use the image software to calculate the average size of the spheroids and the numbers of spheroids formed per low power field (LPF x 4) in each treatment group over time.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells that receive effective drug treatment should form fewer or no spheroids compared to the control group. This is an indication of the tested drug's effectiveness on suppressing cancer stem cells."
