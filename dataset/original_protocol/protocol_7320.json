    "Cell culturePlate cells in 10 cm dishes at ≥50% confluence in appropriate media. For 293T cells, plating 1.5 × 106 cells in a 10 cm dish and harvesting within 48 h should yield approximately 2 mg of protein, which should suffice for the endpoint(s) of interest.Note: One 10 cm dish yields 500 µL of lysate, or the equivalent of two samples for RIP (200 µL of lysate are needed per RIP reaction). If cells express high endogenous levels of RBP of interest, one 10 cm dish should provide sufficient material for RIP; if cells express low endogenous levels of RBP of interest, plan on combining two 10 cm dishes into 500 µL of lysate; if endogenous expression levels of RBP are unknown, we recommend starting with the more concentrated lysate (i.e., two 10 cm dishes combined into 500 µL of lysate). Take into account the need for 2× 200 µL of lysates for each RIP: one lysate to be used for purification with an antibody targeting the RBP of interest and one lysate to be used for purification with an anti-IgG control antibody. The purified eluate from each RIP reaction should provide sufficient material for both protein and RNA analyses. Incubate cells at 37 °C.Proceed to the next step 24–48 h post plating.Cell lysis for RNP lysate preparationNote: Perform all these steps on ice. Remove media from dish by aspiration.Rinse cells with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS twice.Add 5 mL of fresh ice-cold PBS.Scrape cells from dish using scraper.Transfer scraped material to 50 mL conical tubes.Pellet cells by centrifugation at 3,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min.Aspirate and discard the supernatant.",
    "Add polysome lysis buffer (PLB) to pellet (500 µL of PLB per 10 cm dish or 500 µL of PLB per two 10 cm dishes for more concentrated lysate) and pipette up and down to resuspend the pellet completely.Transfer lysate to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.Store lysate in PLB at -80 °C or proceed directly to step 11.Sonicate lysates (10 pulses at 4–5 W) in a cold room.Spin lysates at approximately 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C.Transfer supernatant into new Eppendorf tubes and spin two more times using the same conditions (three total centrifugation cycles with identical conditions).Aliquot approximately 200 µL of lysate per Eppendorf tube and store at -80 °C until ready to perform RIP procedure or proceed immediately to the next step.RNP immunoprecipitation (RIP)/EXTRACTMANThaw lysates on ice (if frozen).Add approximately 1.2 µg of primary antibody to 200 µL of RIP lysate (containing approximately 0.8 mg of protein) and add matched IgG control to another 200 µL of RIP lysate.Note: The quantity of antibody will vary depending on the antibody affinity or endogenous cellular RBP levels and will need to be optimized (1–10 µg of antibody is a typical range). Add 5 µL of washed protein G–bound paramagnetic Dynabeads to the same tube(s) containing RIP lysate + primary antibody.Note: Dynabead washing procedure is described in manufacturer’s specification sheet. Incubate mixture on rotator at low speed (approximately 30 rotations per minute) and 4 °C for preferred amount of time.Note: Approximately 25% of protein was pulled through with 30 min incubation; however, pull-through efficiency will vary depending on the antibody affinity or RBP levels and will need to be optimized (30 min–16 h should be a reasonable range for incubation times). Prepare EXTRACTMAN device.Note: EXTRACTMAN device setup is presented in video form at the following link: https://www.gilson.com/extractman-starter-kit.html[href=https://www.gilson.com/extractman-starter-kit.html].",
    "Set up new disposable microplate and bead collection strip on the device.Note: Each plate contains four “columns” labeled A–D, with each column accommodating one RIP reaction. Thus, each plate can be used to run up to four RIP reactions simultaneously. Place the magnet locator at the correct starting position as specified in the EXTRACTMAN manual.For each RIP reaction that will be run, add 100 µL of wash/elution buffer to each of the five small wells per column in the microplate (this will include the wash wells as well as the bound elution well).Note: Add less volume to the elution well if a more concentrated lysate is required. Add 200 µL of the RIP mixture (lysate + primary antibody + paramagnetic Dynabeads) to the large well(s) in the microplate.Proceed with device operation as described in the EXTRACTMAN manual. Briefly, alternatively proceed with shifting the handle and then the magnet locator to each successive stop on the device sequentially with a brief (< 5 s) pause at each stop.Collect the remaining volume in each input well following the procedure and put in tube(s) (approximately 200 µL volume; this is what is labeled as the “unbound” fraction).Collect the volume in the last well per column in the microplate and put in tube(s) (approximately 100 µL volume; this is what is labeled as the “bound” fraction).Collect the volumes in the middle wash wells and put in tubes (approximately 100 µL per well).Note: This step is not required, but the collected volume can be used to check for any losses associated with the washing procedure if deemed necessary. Store the unbound, bound, and wash fractions (if applicable) at -20 °C for downstream analyses or proceed directly to steps D or F for RNA and/or protein analysis, respectively.",
    "RNA isolationNote: Prior to beginning work, all benchtops, pipettes, handlers’ gloves, etc. should be wiped down carefully with RNase Away or an equivalent solution containing RNase inhibitor(s). Additionally, all tubes, tips, and other consumables should be certified RNase/nuclease-free. Cell culture media, PBS, and other solutions (e.g., lysis buffer components) should be dedicated for RIP and kept separately from the same solutions used for other experimental purposes. This is to avoid compromising the RNA analysis endpoints by preventing degradation of the RNAs within the RNP complexes being purified. Add 350 µL of lysis buffer provided in the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit directly into the unbound/bound/wash fraction volumes.Follow manufacturer’s instructions for remainder of processing steps.Note: The Qiagen RNeasy mini kit was used for the work described here, but other RNA extraction kits/methods will likely yield similar results if procedures for RNA isolation from cells are followed as per manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCRDetermine RNA concentration and quality using approach of choice [e.g., load approximately 1–2 µL of unbound/bound fractions onto NanoDrop device and record RNA concentration and 260/280 (ideal range: 1.7–2.0) and 260/230 ratios (ideal range: 1.8–2.2)].Set up RT-PCR using kit of choice (e.g., QuantiTect reverse transcription kit) and appropriate thermal cycler settings.Note: Run each reaction at least in duplicates. Run qPCR using cDNA generated in previous step and primers of choice with appropriate temperature and time settings for each cycle.Note: Other endpoints such as Northern blot, microarray, or RNA-Seq analysis can also be applied here. Western blottingDetermine protein concentration in each of the unbound, bound, and wash fractions (if applicable) using approach of choice (e.g., addition of Bradford reagent followed by colorimetric reading)Load equal quantities of protein lysate from each of the unbound fractions onto polyacrylamide gel to enable quantitative visualization of the protein of interest.",
    "Load appropriate quantities of bound fractions assuming 20%–100% recovery of the RBP of interest (depending on antibody affinity). This loaded fraction should be recorded and then used to calculate the pull-through efficiency.Perform Western blotting using apparatus, run/transfer settings, and primary and secondary antibodies of choice."
