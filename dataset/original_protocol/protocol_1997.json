    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExcisional punch injury\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes how to induce a tissue repair response in mice by performing full-thickness punch injury in the skin.\nNote: This protocol describes a model of skin wound healing in which the wounds are left open after injury. No wound dressing is used.\nNote: The same protocol can be used for male and female wound cell isolation.\nAnesthetize a mouse (8–12 weeks old, male or female) by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg body weight Ketavet and 10 mg/kg bodyweight Xylazin in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution.\nCover the eyes of the mouse with eye ointment to avoid drying-out.\nShave the back skin of the mouse with an electric shaver for animals.\nDisinfect the back skin with a paper towel soaked in 70% ethanol.\nPerform 4 full thickness punch injuries in the back skin left and right of the spine using a biopsy puncher (4 mm in diameter).\nKeep the mouse on a heating plate at 37°C in a laminar flow hood until it wakes up.\nAfter the mouse wakes up, place it into a clean autoclaved cage which should contain autoclaved tissue instead of beddings.\nNote: Cage embeddings should not be used up to day 3 after injury as they may contaminate the wound. After this, cages may contain embeddings as a dry scab will cover the wound tissue and protect it from dirt.\nExchange the autoclaved tissues daily up to day 3 after injury.\nKeep the wounded mouse separated from other mice until the wound tissue is excised.\nTo alleviate pain after injury, add 1 mg/mL tramadol to the drinking water up to day 3 after injury.",
    "Note: We recommend tramadol as painkiller because, in our experience, it does not interfere with inflammation and other wound healing mechanisms. To ensure sufficient oral uptake of tramadol we recommend measuring the daily water uptake per mouse (4–7 mL is sufficient).\nGenerating single-cell suspensions of wound tissue\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes how to digest wound tissue in order to generate a single-cell suspension for FACS staining.\nNote: The day of wound excision after skin injury depends on the scientific question. To compare gene expression in inflammatory macrophages in the early phase of healing with the resolution phenotype of macrophages in the late phase of healing, we recommend isolating macrophages at day 2–4 after injury (inflammatory phase) and day 12–14 after injury (resolution phase).\nSacrifice the mice according to institutional guidelines.\nCritical: Mice should not be sacrificed by cervical dislocation but by another method since cervical dislocation would tear the wound tissue.\nExcise the wound tissues with forceps and scissor. Place the wound tissue onto a wooden spatula (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1595-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Generating single-cell suspensions of wound tissue\n(A) Representative photographs of wound tissue excised at 4 days after injury.\n(B) Removal of skin surrounding the wound tissue with a scalpel.\n(C) Mincing the wound tissue with a scalpel for enzymatic digestion.\n(D and E) (D) Transfer of wound tissue after enzymatic digestion into a Medicon and (E) homogenization for 5 min.\n(F) Aspiration of single-cell suspension with a 1 mL syringe.\nRemove the skin surrounding the wound tissue. Leave 0.5–1.0 mm of normal skin around the wound tissue because the wound edge region contains a high number of inflammatory cells (can be seen histologically) that may be lost if the normal skin is completely removed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Cut the wound tissue with a scalpel into small pieces (∼ 1 mm edge length) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTransfer the cut wound tissue into a 1.5 mL tube filled with 1.2 mL of DMEM medium.\nAdd 30 μg/mL Liberase TM Research Grade into the DMEM medium to digest the wound tissue enzymatically.\nIncubate the wound tissue in the digestion medium for 1 h at 37°C in a ThermoMixer (shaking at 400/min).\nPause point: The incubation time can be used for a break. However, it is critical to mix the wound tissue manually every 15 min by taking the tube out of the ThermoMixer and shaking it.\nCritical: Efficient digestion of the wound tissue requires constant shaking at 400/min in a ThermoMixer and manual shaking every 15 min.\nOpen the lid of a Medicon.\nAspirate the digested wound tissue together with the digestion medium and transfer it into a Medicon using a 1 mL pipette tip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: Truncating the pipette tip with a scissor in order to widen the opening makes it easier to aspirate the pieces of digested wound tissue.\nClose the lid of the Medicon and homogenize the tissue mechanically for 5 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nAspirate wound cell suspension with a 1 mL syringe and pour it through a 70 μM cell strainer into a 50 mL tube placed on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nCritical: Unless otherwise noted, all steps from here should be performed on ice. Buffers should be kept at 4°C.\nRinse the Medicon with 2 mL DMEM and pour it through the 70 μM cell strainer into the 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant carefully and discard it.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of FB1.",
    "Aspirate wound cell suspension and pour it through a 40 μM cell strainer into a 50 mL tube.\nRinse the 40 μM cell strainer with 3 mL of FB1.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant carefully and discard it.\nAdd 1 mL of Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution and incubate at 18°C–25°C for 2 min.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 8 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant carefully and discard it. Resuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of FB1.\nTransfer cell suspension into a 96 well conical (V) bottom plate for FACS staining.\nFACS sorting of wound macrophages\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes how to stain wound macrophage populations and how to index FACS-sort single macrophages into 384-well plates.\nCentrifuge 96-well plate at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and discard it. Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of FB2 with anti-CD16/CD32 and incubate for 10 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge 96-well plate at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and discard it. Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL of antibody mix (see table below) and incubate for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1595_16.csv\nCentrifuge 96-well plate at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and discard it.

    "Prior to FACS-sorting add 50 ng/mL DAPI and pour the cell suspension through a 40 μM cell strainer into a FACS tube. Keep the sample tubes on ice and in the dark.\nNote: To excite DAPI fluorescence a flow cytometer equipped with a violet (405 nm)/UV (355 nm) laser is required. In case the flow cytometer has only a 405 nm laser line, either eFluor450/Brilliant Violet 421/Pacific Blue coupled antibodies or DAPI can be used. Alternatively, propidium iodide (1 μg/mL final concentration) can be used.\nNote: The following procedure is established for the use of a BD FACS ARIA II/III cell sorter equipped with automated cell deposition unit (ACDU) and BD FACS Diva software version 7 or higher.\nSetup your flow cytometer: activate appropriate laser lines, make sure that filters and mirrors match your fluorochromes, activate desired parameters, setup PMT voltages and perform compensation with single stain controls. Fluorochrome spill-over should be minimized to avoid high compensation. Appropriate compensation as well as autofluorescence for each fluorescence parameter can be determined with a set of FMO (fluorescence minus one) controls (i.e., prepare a set of control stainings with leaving out each antibody once) (Herzenberg et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Roederer 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nInstall a 100 μm nozzle and the splash shield.\nBring the ACDU to the front.\nOptimize drop delay (see BD FACS Diva reference manual).\nInstall collection plate (384-well plate preloaded with 0.5 μL of Lysis Buffer per well, leave the plate sealed/covered during setup) and choose the appropriate device layout.\nSwitch on plate voltage and activate “test sort”.\nOptimize far left side stream to pass through splash shield with minimal deflection.\nBring ACDU to home position, deposit drop by shortly activating “test sort” button and inspect deposition of the drop. Adjust home position to hit the center of well A1.",
    "To validate accurate set up of the sorting device and cell sorter, sort single polystyrene beads (e.g., BD CaliBRITE™ beads) premixed in PBS with horse radish peroxidase solution (100 μg/mL) into individual wells of plates containing 1 μL of 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (BioLegend, see Rodrigues and Monard, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Wells that were correctly sorted with a single bead will turn blue within minutes.\nSet sort precision “single cell” and target event = 1.\nChoose as target cell population gate DAPI- single CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages.\nNote: To account for the heterogeneity of wound macrophages, our protocol is designed to broadly identify wound macrophages based on expression of CD45, CD11b, F4/80. However, additional markers such as MHC II, Trem2, CD301b, Ly6C, CCR2, and CD64 (which has been used to identify dermal macrophages), can be added for sorting and/or as an index marker (Joshi et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Kolter et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Tamoutounour et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Willenborg et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Furthermore, lineage markers, e.g., CD3ε, NK1.1, B220, Siglec F and Ly6G can be used to further help exclusion of non-macrophage cell populations.\nNote: Signal intensities of FSC, SSC and fluorescence parameters are relative and depend on the individual settings of the flow cytometer (e.g., PMT voltages, filters and mirrors). Before starting the sorting, we recommend backgating CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ cells to ensure no macrophage subpopulation is missed and gates are appropriately placed. Typically, we recover about 35%–40% (4 days post injury) and 80%–90% (day 14 post injury) of CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ cells among total CD45+ cells. In addition, FMO controls can help in determining appropriate gating thresholds for populations with dim separation.\nCheck “Index Sorting” option.\nBegin with index sorting of single macrophages.",
    "Record for each sort run a data file that will contain all recorded events. In addition, record an index sort file, containing the well ID and the corresponding optical parameters (i.e., FSC, SSC and fluorescence intensity) of the sorted event. This data can be merged with gene expression data.\nCritical: Minimize sorting/processing time to max 30 min–1 h. We strongly recommend doing a pre-adjustment (trial run) to establish the instrument settings on the FACS sorter. Further, it is advisable to optimize the sorting stream as suggested in the colorimetric assay (step 53) before the cells are sorted.\nSince a high abundance of debris and red blood cells can massively increase the sorting time, we strongly recommend to use cell strainers to remove aggregates (steps 21 and 26) and to perform lysis of red blood cells (step 30). Adjust the cell suspension to a cell density of approximately 5 × 106/mL. A higher dilution of the cell suspension increases the sorting time; at lower dilutions, target cell events are more likely to be missed. Leave the sorting plate sealed as long as possible to prevent evaporation of the Lysis Buffer and uncover the plate immediately before sorting.\nSeal plates with adhesive foil and centrifuge plates at minimum 100 × g for 1 min at 4°C to collect all liquid at the bottom. Freeze the plates at −80°C for at least 1 h or not longer than 4 months.\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing following the Smart-seq2 workflow\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes cDNA synthesis, cDNA amplification, cDNA purification, and library preparation after wound macrophages were FACS-sorted and lysed in 384-well plates.",
    "Note: The workflow described below is a modified version of the original Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Adaptations include miniaturization of reaction volumes (thus changing enzyme ratios) and implementing automation in certain steps of the protocol for increased speed and accuracy, and to minimize costs. Additionally, we use blocked poly-dT and amplification primers to reduce background coming from, e.g., primer dimers, and added control samples (positive control of isolated RNA and bulk RNA) for troubleshooting. Importantly, here we describe two methods for library preparation. Although both are based on tagmentation, they differ from what was presented in the original method.\nThaw the plates on ice.\nAdd 0.5 μL of dT-Buffer (as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) to each well of the 384-well plate with a nanodispenser. Heat-seal the plate (1 s at 166°C), mix well and spin it down.\nNote: The ERCC in the dT-Buffer mix is optional. It supports the detection of low-quality cells (which will show a significant ERCC proportion) or differences in overall RNA content (inactive cells with low RNA content will show higher ERCC proportions than active cells) during the subsequent analysis. Further, the ERCC can be used to estimate the detection sensitivity on levels of expressed genes, as the mix contains 92 different constructs with varying length, GC content and concentration.\nNote: We prefer heat-sealing over adhesive foils as we often observed evaporation at the wells located in the corners of the plate.\nNote: The optimal sealing temperature and time can vary for different plate types, foils and/or heat-sealing systems. Please ensure that the plate is properly sealed by (carefully) lifting the foil at the corners.\nDenature RNA by incubating the plate for 3 min at 72°C.\nPrepare the Reverse Transcription Buffer on ice as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.",
    "Add 1.5 μL to each well of the 384-well plate using a nanodispenser, heat-seal the plate (1 s at 166°C) and spin it down. Vortex thoroughly and spin it down once more.\nPerform Reverse Transcription as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1595_17.csv\nNote: Plates can be kept at 4°C for 8–16 h in the thermocycler or frozen at −80°C for 8–16 h (preferred).\nPrepare cDNA Amplification Master Mix as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nAdd 3 μL of the cDNA Amplification Master Mix to each well with a nanodispenser, heat-seal the plate (1 s at 166°C), vortex the plate and spin it down.\nAmplify cDNA with the following cycling conditions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1595_18.csv\nNote: Amplified cDNA can be kept at 4°C for 8–16 h or at −20°C for a few days. The purification of the reaction should take place within 72 h after cDNA amplification. The purified cDNA can then be stored for longer.\nPurify the amplified cDNA on a liquid handling robot with magnetic bead purification as follows:\nAdd 9 μL of magnetic beads to each well, mix well, and incubate for 5 min at 18°C–25°C followed by 3 min incubation on the magnet.\nWash the beads twice with 30 μL of 80% ethanol.\nIf necessary, dry bead pellet by vacuum centrifuge for 8 min at 30°C to remove any remaining ethanol.\nElute beads in 12 μL nuclease-free water.\nLet beads and cDNA rehydrate at 18°C–25°C for approximately 1 h.\nNote: Samples can be stored at 4°C for 8–16 h or at −20°C for a maximum of 6 months.",
    "Analyze fragment size distribution and measure concentration of the cDNA of few randomly picked samples using a fragment analyzer. Measure the concentration of all samples in a microplate reader by loading 20 μL of the AccuBlue BR dsDNA Quantitation Mix into each well of a 384-well black LV plate and adding 1.5 μL of the purified cDNA. In parallel, always prepare a standard row (in triplicates) covering the concentration range of the samples. We recommend at least eight measure points: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0 ng/μL of standard. Make sure to use appropriate excitation and emission parameters for the measurements.\nNote: Below, we describe two protocols for library preparation. The first protocol, described in step 71, uses a library preparation kit that is currently not manufactured, but we opt for detailing this workflow because it was used in the study by Willenborg et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]. Since then, we optimized the library preparation to use the currently available library prep chemistry from Illumina, using the bead linked transposome (BLT). This second protocol is described in step 72.\nLibrary preparation using the Vazyme TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2:\nNote: This kit is currently not available.\nFor library preparation, scale all samples to a concentration of 350 pg/μL (for lower concentrated samples, use 2 μL).\nNote: Some samples will likely have concentrations below the detection limit because they are low in RNA content and/or the sort failed.\nTransfer 2 μL (700 pg) of the amplified cDNA in an empty 384-well plate.\nDesiccate the liquid completely by vacuum centrifuge for 15 min at 30°C.\nIn the meantime, thaw all reagents from the Tagmentation Master Mix A on ice and, once thawed, prepare the mix as described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.",
    "Add 1 μL of Tagmentation Master Mix A with a nanodispenser to each well, heat-seal the plate for 1 s at 166°C, vortex vigorously and spin it down.\nIncubate the plate in a pre-heated thermal cycler using the following program.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1595_19.csv\nTo amplify the tagmented DNA, add 3 μL of the KAPA High-Fidelity Hot Start ReadyMix (2×) and 2 μL of P5 and P7 barcoded Nextera amplification primers (1 μM of each) to a total reaction volume of 6 μL.\nNote: Barcode sets can be prepared in advance by combining P5 and P7 primers to generate a dual-indexing primer set, for example by distributing each P7 barcode row-wise and each P5 column-wise. The barcode plate can be stored at −20°C and thawed shortly before use.\nHeat-seal the plate, vortex and spin it down.\nAmplify tagmented DNA with the following cycling conditions (pre-heat lid to 105°C).

Users should refer to step 72 for library preparation.\nFor library preparation, transfer a volume of 3 µL of the cDNA to an empty 384-well plate.\nDesiccate the liquid completely by vacuum centrifuge for 15 - 20 min at 30°C.\nIn the meantime, bring all reagents from the Tagmentation Master Mix B to 18-25°C and prepare the mix as described in the Materials and equipment section.",
    "Add 1 µL of Tagmentation Master Mix B with a nanodispenser to each well and heat-seal the plate for 1 sec at 166°C. Vortex the plate vigorously and spin it down for a total of 3 times, but stop last spin at 45 x g to prevent the BLT beads from settling to the bottom of the wells.\nIncubate the plate in a thermal cycler for 15 min at 55°C (without pre-heated lid).\nAdd 1 µL of 0.1% SDS to each sample to stop the reaction. Heat-seal the lid again, mix well and incubate for 15 min at 37°C.\nQuickly spin the plate down and place it on a 384-well magnetic rack to separate the beads from the supernatant. Fully remove the supernatant e.g., by using an automated plate washer [(e.g. the Bluewasher system (BlueCatBio)].\nNote: Supernatants can also be removed by liquid handling systems, provided removal is efficient enough.\nTo amplify the tagmented DNA, add 2.5 µL of the KAPA High-Fidelity Hot Start Ready Mix and 2.5 µL of nuclease-free water to each sample.\nAdd 100 nL of P5 and 100 nL of P7 Nextera index primers (primer stock of 10 µM) using a nanodispenser (e.g. the Echo 525 nanodispenser).\nHeat-seal the plate, vortex and spin it down.\nAmplify tagmented DNA with the following cycling conditions (pre-heat lid to 105°C).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1595_21.csv\nNote: Samples can be kept at 2-8°C for up to two days.\nAdd 8 µL of nuclease-free water to each sample to reach a total volume of 13 µL.\nIf necessary, transfer 12 µL to a new plate suitable for a liquid handling automated system.

    "Measure the concentration of the unpurified libraries in a microplate reader by loading 20 μL of the AccuBlue BR dsDNA Quantitation Mix into each well of a 384-well black LV plate and adding 1.5 μL of the unpurified library. In parallel, always prepare a standard row (in triplicates) covering the concentration range of the libraries. We recommend 12 measure points: 80, 60, 40, 20, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 0.5 of standard and a blank value.\nSeal the plate with a foil, vortex, spin it down and incubate for at least 10 min at 18°C–25°C in the dark.\nBefore measurement, remove foil and quickly spin down the plate. Measure with a plate reader using appropriate excitation and emission parameters.\nEvaluate library concentration according to the values measured in the standard row.\nPool libraries equimolarly according to reader measurements and desired sequencing output. It is advisable to pool libraries with similar concentrations.\nLibrary purification and size selection.\nFor purification of library pools, add 0.9× of Agencourt XP beads (or comparable) and pipette up and down to mix well. Quickly spin down the tubes and incubate at 18°C–25°C for 5 min.\nPlace tubes on a magnetic rack and discard supernatant after beads attach to the magnet.\nKeep tubes on magnetic rack and wash library pools twice with 200 μL of freshly-prepared 80% EtOH. For each wash, wait for 30 s before removing the EtOH. Pulse-spin the tubes, place them back in the magnetic rack and remove any residual EtOH.\nAir-dry the beads at 18°C–25°C for approximately 5 min.\nFor size selection, first hydrate the beads with nuclease-free water and add 0.6× volume of magnetic beads to each library pool. Incubate at 18°C–25°C for 5 min.",

Pulse-spin the tubes, place them back in the magnetic rack and remove any residual EtOH.\nAir-dry the beads at 18°C–25°C for approximately 2 min. Beads should have a rusty color when dry.\nNote: Avoid excessive drying of the beads (cracks will form) to minimize the loss of DNA.\nDissolve the beads with appropriate volume of nuclease-free water.\nNote: Expected concentrations will be ∼50% lower than those determined by the microplate reader measurements for each library pool. This is mainly due to loss of material during size selection and depletion of primer dimers.\nPlace the tubes back on the magnetic rack. When solution has cleared, transfer all supernatant to a clean PCR tube.\nAnalyze library size distribution and concentration using a fragment analyzer.\nOptional: If necessary, an additional 0.9× purification may follow to avoid fragments smaller than 200 bp.\nRNA sequencing can be performed as desired, choosing read sizes and sequencing depths that better address the research question. We find that 0.5 mio to 1.5 mio reads per cell (paired-end 50–100 bp) is a good setting for most experiments."
