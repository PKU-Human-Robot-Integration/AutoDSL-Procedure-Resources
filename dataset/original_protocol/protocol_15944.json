    "In this protocol, the production, purification, and analysis of the adapter protein PhyB-DARPinEGFR is described. This adapter protein targets the OptoAAV (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.440#cpz1440-prot-0002]) to cell lines overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a light-dependent manner. The protocol is identical for adapter proteins comprising other designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) specific for EpCAM, Her2, or CD4 as described in the original publication (Hörner et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.440#cpz1440-bib-0009]). PhyB-DARPinEGFR is produced in Escherichia coli together with the biosynthesis enzymes HO1 and PcyA for the chromophore phycocyanobilin (PCB) which are encoded on the same plasmid (Hörner et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.440#cpz1440-bib-0008]). Afterward, PhyB-DARPinEGFR is purified via its hexahistidine tag by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Finally, the concentration of PhyB-DARPinEGFR is determined by Bradford assay and the protein purity and identity is analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Zn2+ staining of the chromophore PCB and Coomassie staining of proteins.\nMaterials\nBL21 Star (DE3) One Shot chemically competent E. coli (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "NOTE: Prepare all solutions with ultrapure water obtained by reverse osmosis.\nProduction of PhyB-DARPinEGFR in E. coli\nDay 1: Transformation\n1. Transform E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) with the PhyB-DARPinEGFR production plasmid pHJW156:\n         \nThaw 1 aliquot of chemically competent BL21 Star (DE3) cells on ice and add 1 µl plasmid pHJW156 (10-500 ng/µl) to 50 µl cells.\nMix by gently tapping the tube and incubate on ice 20 min.\nIncubate tube at 42°C in a heat block for 45 s and incubate tube immediately afterwards on ice for 2 min.\nAdd 500 µl LB medium and incubate tube in a thermoshaker at 37°C with agitation at 750 rpm for 1 hr.\nInoculate 10 ml LB medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml streptomycin in a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube with the transformed cells and incubate overnight at 37°C with agitation at 150 rpm.\nDay 2: Inoculation of expression culture and induction of protein production\n2. Inoculate 100 ml LB medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml streptomycin in a 500-ml baffled flask with the overnight culture and grow at 37°C with agitation at 150 rpm for 4 hr (pre-culture).\n3. Inoculate each of four 2-L baffled flasks containing 1 L LB medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml streptomycin with 20 ml pre-culture and grow at 30°C with agitation at 150 rpm until an OD600 of 0.6 to 0.8 is reached (expression culture). Measure OD600 regularly using cuvettes and a photometer.\n4. Induce protein production by the addition of 1 ml 1 M IPTG stock solution to each expression culture (final concentration: 1 mM) and incubate at 18°C with agitation at 150 rpm in the dark for 20 hr.",
    "Protect all bacteria/samples containing PhyB-DARPinEGFR from bright light such as direct sun light. Whenever possible, shade the lab and only work under artificial room light. During incubation steps, always protect samples from light with aluminum foil. PhyB-DARPinEGFR is stable at ambient room light for multiple hours.\nDay 3: Harvesting of expression culture\n5. Harvest bacteria by centrifugation at 6,500 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nThe bacterial pellets should have a green color due to the produced holo-PhyB-DARPinEGFR and the chromophore PCB.\n6. Discard supernatants and resuspend bacterial pellets in lysis buffer (30 ml lysis buffer per 1 L expression culture). Aliquot resuspended bacteria in 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes (40 ml per tube), snap freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80°C.\nDo not store the resuspended bacteria at −20°C as PhyB-DARPinEGFR is not stable at this temperature.\nPurification of PhyB-DARPinEGFR by IMAC\n7. Thaw resuspended bacteria in a water bath at 37°C and transfer tubes after thawing immediately on ice.\n8. Add TCEP to a final concentration of 0.5 mM from 100 mM TCEP stock solution.\n9. Lyse bacteria by passing three times through a high-pressure homogenizer or French press at 1,000 to 1,500 bar. Cool lysate after each cycle on ice below 5°C.\nAlternatively, cells can be lysed by sonication. Usually, lysis by sonication is less efficient resulting in a reduced yield.\n10. Centrifuge lysate at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and transfer clarified supernatant into a new bottle.\n11. Connect a Ni-NTA Superflow column [column volume (CV): 5 ml] to a FPLC system. For the purification process, use a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Detect absorbance at 280 nm. The purification should be performed at 4°C.",
    "In case no FPLC system is available in a cold room or fridge, cool the clarified lysate and all buffers throughout the purification on ice. Alternatively, the purification process can be performed with gravity flow columns in the fridge.\n12. Equilibrate column with 25 ml (5 CV) of lysis buffer.\n13. Load clarified supernatant on the column.\n14. Wash column with 100 ml (20 CV) of wash buffer.\n15. Elute protein with 25 ml (5 CV) of elution buffer and collect 2-ml fractions. Merge all turquoise-colored fractions containing PhyB-DARPinEGFR.\nTo increase the yield, repeat the purification by loading the flow-through and the wash again on the column. In case the elution peak area is substantially smaller (<20%) than in the first run, discard the eluate as the purity is usually low. For storage, wash the column with 25 ml (5 CV) of water followed by 25 ml (5 CV) of 25% ethanol. Afterward, the column can be stored at 4°C for multiple years.\n16. Concentrate eluted protein to ∼1 ml using an ultrafiltration centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa MWCO, PES membrane, 20 ml) at 6,000 × g and 20°C.\nDo not centrifuge at 4°C as this will reduce the solubility of the protein and may result in precipitation of the highly concentrated protein close to the membrane. Interrupt centrifugation every 15 min to homogenize the concentration gradient by carefully inverting the concentrator multiple times.\n17. Equilibrate the 10-ml desalting column with 100 ml protein buffer.\n18. Apply concentrated protein (∼1 ml) on the desalting column.\n19. Add 1 ml protein buffer on the desalting column and discard flow-through.\n20. Add 500 µl protein buffer and collect flow-through in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Repeat this step until the colored protein is eluted from the column (usually within 5 ml).",
    "21. Merge the six most intense turquoise-colored fractions (total volume: 3 ml) containing PhyB-DARPinEGFR.\nThese fractions will contain 80%-90% of the protein. Do not include the weak-colored fractions after the main peak as they can include imidazole and salts from the elution buffer. After protein elution, wash the desalting column with 100 ml protein buffer followed by 100 ml water supplemented with 0.04% (w/v) sodium azide. The column can be stored afterward at 4°C for several years.\n22. Concentrate merged fractions to ∼1 ml using an ultrafiltration centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa MWCO, PES membrane, 6 ml) at 8,000 × g and 20°C.\n23. Sterilize protein sample by passing through a 0.22-µm syringe filter.\n24. Prepare 20-µl aliquots of the protein in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, snap freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80°C.\nPhyB-DARPinEGFR can be stored at −80°C for multiple years. Do not store the purified PhyB-DARPinEGFR at −20°C as the protein is not stable at this temperature. The whole purification process should be performed within 1 day to maintain maximal functionality of PhyB-DARPinEGFR.\nAnalysis of PhyB-DARPinEGFR\n25. Thaw one aliquot of PhyB-DARPinEGFR in a heat block at 37°C and immediately transfer to ice upon thawing.\n26. Determine protein concentration by Bradford assay in the 96-well plate format according to the manufacturer's instructions using BSA as a standard.\nThe expected concentration is ∼12 mg/ml. The typical yield is ∼3 mg of purified PhyB-DARPinEGFR per liter of expression culture.\n27. Analyze protein identity and purity by SDS-PAGE:\n         \nMix 5 µl protein with 35 µl protein buffer and 10 µl 5× SDS loading buffer and incubate at 95°C for 5 min.\nSeparate 10 µl of sample and 5 µl of protein ladder on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel.",
    "Incubate SDS-PAGE gel in a 1 mM zinc acetate solution for 15 min and visualize fluorescence of the PhyB-DARPinEGFR-bound chromophore PCB under UV light (312 nm) using a standard documentation system for ethidium-bromide-stained agarose gels.\nIncubate the same agarose gel in Coomassie solution for 1 hr followed by incubation in destaining solution overnight.\nRepresentative results of the SDS-PAGE analysis are depicted in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.440#cpz1440-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fadfb5d1-6ca8-44b4-88b0-25562d6e16d1/cpz1440-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nAnalysis of purified PhyB-DARPinEGFR by SDS-PAGE followed by Zn2+ staining of the chromophore PCB and Coomassie-staining of proteins.

    "In this protocol, the production, purification, and analysis of OptoAAV is described. OptoAAV is an AAV vector of serotype 2 with a knockout of its natural tropism toward heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) that can transduce target cells in the presence of an adapter protein (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.440#cpz1440-prot-0001]) in response to the illumination with red light. OptoAAV is produced using the helper-free packaging system (Xiao, Li, & Samulski, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.440#cpz1440-bib-0020]) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells upon transfection of the required plasmids with polyethylenimine (PEI). Afterward, assembled OptoAAV capsids are purified by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation (Zolotukhin et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.440#cpz1440-bib-0022]). Finally, the genomic titer of the purified OptoAAV is determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and the composition of the viral capsids are analyzed by Western blotting against the viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3.\nMaterials\nHEK-293T cells (DSMZ, cat. no.

Seed each of twenty 15-cm tissue culture plates with 8 × 106 HEK-293T cells in 20 ml complete DMEM (DMEM supplemented with 10%, v/v, FBS and 1%, v/v, penicillin/streptomycin solution). Incubate cells 24 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.\nDay 2: Transfection with PEI\n2.

Vortex and distribute solution equally in two 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes.\nPer 15-cm plate, 60 µg DNA in 1.5 ml Opti-MEM is mixed with 200 µl PEI solution in 1.5 ml Opti-MEM. The four plasmids are mixed in an equimolar ratio. The sizes of the plasmids are: pHelper, 11.6 kbp; pRCVP2koA, 7.3 kbp; pMH303, 6.2 kbp; pCMVgfp, 4.6 kbp.\n3. Dilute 4 ml PEI solution in 30 ml Opti-MEM in a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube. Vortex.\n4. Add 17 ml PEI-Opti-MEM solution to each DNA-Opti-MEM solution and vortex immediately for 15 s.\n5. Incubate both DNA-PEI-Opti-MEM mixes for 15 min at room temperature.\n6. Add 4 ml of DNA-PEI-Opti-MEM mix dropwise (distributed over the whole plate) to each of the twenty, 15-cm tissue culture plates with HEK-293T cells. Gently move plate left and right and forward and backward to homogeneously distribute the transfection mix.\nAs HEK-293T cells detach easily, it is important to carefully add the DNA-PEI-Opti-MEM mix dropwise to the cells.\n7. Incubate cells 6 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.",
    "8. Aspirate medium of the plates and replace each with 20 ml complete DMEM.\nAs HEK-293T cells detach easily, it is important to carefully aspirate the medium. Pipet the new medium slowly to the border of the plate.\n9. Incubate cells for 72 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.\nDay 5: Harvesting of OptoAAV\nAs OptoAAVs produced on ten plates will be purified by one iodixanol gradient (see below), the following harvesting protocol is described for ten plates. For harvesting of the twenty plates, perform the protocol twice.\n10. Scrape cells from ten plates using a cell lifter without removing medium.\nBefore harvesting of the cells, transfection efficiency can be checked by analyzing green fluorescent protein (GFP) production from the transfer plasmid by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry.\n11. Resuspend cells and transfer them into 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes. Rinse plates with PBS (40 ml PBS for ten plates) and transfer resuspended cells into 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes.\n12. Centrifuge cells at 400 × g for 10 min (swing-out rotor).\n13. Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml PBS per tube. Merge resuspended cells in one 50-ml conical centrifuge tube.\n14. Centrifuge cells at 400 × g for 10 min (swing-out rotor).\n15. Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 ml AAV lysis buffer.\n16. Lyse cells by five freeze-thaw cycles:\n         \nFreeze sample in liquid nitrogen for 5 min;\nThaw sample in a water bath at 37°C;\nOnce the sample is thawed, continue with step a. Repeat this procedure four times.\nOnce the cell suspension is frozen in liquid nitrogen, it can be stored at −80°C.\nPurification of OptoAAV by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation",
    "NOTE: The following section of the protocol describes the preparation of one iodixanol gradient that allows purification of OptoAAVs produced on ten plates. For the purification from twenty plates, prepare two iodixanol gradients. Dependent on the number of parallel purifications, an additional iodixanol gradient loaded with AAV lysis buffer instead of the AAV suspension may have to be prepared for balancing purposes.\n17. Sonicate sample containing the lysed cells of ten plates for 80 s in an ultrasonic water bath.\n18. Add 10 µl benzonase (final concentration: 50 U/ml) and incubate at 37°C in a water bath for 1 hr. Briefly vortex sample every 10 min.\n19. Centrifuge sample at 4,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\n20. Transfer supernatant into a new 15-ml conical centrifuge tube.

This solution will displace all other phases upward and will be the lowest phase.\nPipet 1.5 ml of the 40% iodixanol solution into the Pasteur pipet. This solution will displace all other phases upward and will be the lowest phase.",
    "Pipet 1.5 ml of the 60% iodixanol solution into the Pasteur pipet. This solution will displace all other phases upward and will be the lowest phase. The AAV suspension should now touch the upper border of the ultracentrifugation tube.\nClose the upper opening of the Pasteur pipet with a finger and carefully remove the pipet.\nFill up the ultracentrifugation tube with AAV lysis buffer using a thin gel loading tip until the solution reaches the middle of the tube stem. Make sure to remove all air bubbles with the gel loading tip.\nIf the liquid flow in the Pasteur pipet stops, gently rotate the pipet. The ultracentrifugation tube should not contain any air bubbles. If air bubbles are trapped within the tube, gently tap the tube to move the air bubbles upward. Carefully move the tube only vertically to avoid destruction of the step gradient.\n22. Seal the ultracentrifugation tube according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, place a seal former on the tube stem. Pre-heat the Tube Topper for 5 s and apply the tip of the Tube Topper vertically to the seal former. Within a few seconds, the seal former will move down the tube stem until it reaches the tube shoulder. Immediately remove the Tube Topper and place the heat sink on the seal former for 15 s. Remove the seal former from the sealed tube.\nInstead of the Tube Topper, a cheap soldering iron can be used. Instead of the heat sink supplied with the Tube Topper, a metal object can be used (e.g., spatula). However, the seal former is still required.\n23. Place two ultracentrifugation tubes into the type 70.1 Ti rotor and place the Quick-Seal tube spacers on top.",

Face the bevel of the needle upward at the interface between the 60% and 40% iodixanol phase and collect ∼1.2 ml of the 40% iodixanol phase.
