    "1. Preparation of Photoactive Substrates\nPrepare a P3HT:PCBM solution (1:1 w/w) in chlorobenzene at a P3HT concentration of 20 g/L. Mix the solution with a magnetic stirrer for at least 4 hr at 60 °C. Consider a volume of 150 µl of solution for each substrate to be prepared.\nClean ITO-coated glass slides (Rs = 10 Ω/sq, 18x18 mm2, thickness 170 µm) with consecutive baths of deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in a sonicator (10 min for each step). Dry the coverslips with a nitrogen gun. Put the samples in a plasma cleaner at 100 W power for 10 min.\nDeposit a thin film of the active layer on the cleaned substrates via spin-coating.\n\t\nWith a diamond tip, cut a microscope glass slide, (thickness ≈ 1 mm) to the same lateral dimensions of the ITO-coated substrates. Remove the P3HT:PCBM solution from the hotplate and let it cool to ambient temperature.\nSet a two-steps spin-coater program: i) 30 sec at 800 rpm; ii) 30 sec at 1,600 rpm. Place the slide on the chuck of the spin-coater and start the vacuum to fix it. Put a drop of acetone on the slide and then the cleaned substrate, with the ITO-coated side facing upwards. Start the spin-coater rotation to get rid of the excess acetone.\nPut 150 µl of P3HT:PCBM solution on the substrates and start again the spin-coater (use the same protocol described in 1.3.2).\nAfter the spin-coater has finished, remove the sample and carefully detach the coated substrate from the glass slide. Clean the back of the substrate with a cleanroom swab dipped in acetone.\n\t\tNote: The photoactive substrates can be stored for few days in a dark box until used. For longer periods, keep them in a glovebox with inert gas.",
    "2. Preparation of Cell Culture Medium and Electrophysiology Solutions\nPrepare the complete growth medium (CGM) for HEK-293 cells: Dulbecco Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) not heat-inactivated, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Sterilize the medium with a 0.2 µm filtration system and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare the extracellular solution in ultrapure water (concentrations in mM): 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 5 HEPES, 10 Glucose, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2. Adjust pH to 7.4 with NaOH. Sterilize the solution with a 0.2 µm filtration system and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare the intracellular solution in ultrapure water (concentrations in mM): 12 KCl, 125 K-Gluconate, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 10 ATP-Na2. Note that ATP-Na2 is heat-sensitive and add it last. Adjust pH to 7.4 with NaOH. Sterilize the solution with a 0.2 µm filtration system, aliquot in 1 ml tubes and store at -20 °C.\n3. Plating HEK-293 Cells on the Active Substrates\nPlace the photoactive substrate in a glass beaker covered with aluminum or a closed Petri dish and put in an oven at 120 °C for 2 hr for sterilization. From this moment onwards, perform all operations in sterile conditions. Put the samples in a sterile hood and let them cool down.\nCoat the photoactive substrate with an adhesion layer to reduce the surface hydrophobicity and to promote cell adhesion.\n\t\nPlace the active substrates in a P35 Petri dish or a 6 multiwell plate. Given the hydrophobicity of the conjugated polymer layer, make a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well to fix the sample and confine the solutions.\n\t\t\nMix PDMS and catalyst in a 10:1 proportion with a glass rod to obtain a viscous slurry.\nPour the slurry in a 6 multiwell plate, dispensing an amount sufficient to cover half of each well.",
    "Wait for PDMS polymerization at RT.\nCut the cured PDMS in the middle for obtaining a square shape of the same dimension of the polymer sample.\nSterilize the PDMS wells by immersion in a 70% ethanol-water mixture for at least 30 min.\nIf using the PDMS well, scratch the photoactive layer along the entire border of the well with pointed tweezers, in order to avoid detachment of the entire layer when removing the PDMS well after cell culturing.\nCover the entire surface of each sample with a fibronectin solution (2 mg/L in PBS). A volume between 500-750 µl per sample is usually sufficient if a PDMS well is used (clear surface of the well: 15x15 mm2). Without the PDMS well, about 2 ml of fibronectin solution are necessary to completely immerse the sample; pay attention that the substrate does not float while adding the solution. Incubate the samples at 37 °C for at least 1 hr.\nRemove the fibronectin solution with a glass pipette and wash once with 2 ml of PBS.\nPlate HEK-293 cells on the fibronectin-treated samples at a density of 15,000 cells/cm2 in complete growth medium. Use a volume of 750-1,000 µl of CGM for each sample if a PDMS well is used, otherwise 2-3 ml of CGM are necessary. Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24-48 hr.\n4. Optical Stimulation Protocol and Electrophysiological Measurements\nPut the extracellular solution in a water bath at 37 °C to thermalize; thaw the intracellular solution, put it in a 1 ml syringe with a 34 gauge needle and keep it in contact with ice to avoid degradation of the ATP.",
    "Take a cell-coated substrate from the incubator, carefully removing the PDMS well if present. Remove the growth medium with a glass pipette and rinse the sample with extracellular solution. Proceed slowly to avoid cell detachment.\nPut the device into the sample-holder of the electrophysiology station with extracellular solution and the reference electrode. Prepare fresh glass micropipettes for patch-clamp with a puller (ideal resistance is in the range 2-4 MΩ). Fill half of the pipette with intracellular solution and mount it on the micromanipulator.\nLook for a healthy cell to patch on the device. To avoid unwanted excitation of the photoactive substrate, use IR illumination for imaging, placing a long-wavelength pass filter (for example, a cut wavelength λ = 750 nm can be used for polymers absorbing in the visible) in front of the microscope illuminator.\nPatch the selected cell and apply the desired protocol for optical stimulation by delivering light to the sample via the fluorescence excitation path of the microscope (Figure 1). A detailed description of the patch-clamp protocol can be found in reference 20.\n\t\nPosition the patch pipette in close proximity to the cell membrane with a micrometric manipulator. During the positioning, apply overpressure to the pipette in order to avoid dirt sticking on the tip. The pipette should be few microns above the cell.\nStart lowering the pipette towards the cell membrane while controlling the pipette resistance on the patch control software. When the pipette resistance has increased about 1 MΩ, remove the overpressure from the pipette while applying a gentle suction, in order to form the gigaseal between the pipette and the cell membrane (i.e., the measured resistance should increase at values greater than 1 GΩ).",
    "Apply a negative potential to the pipette close to the expected cell resting potential (for HEK293 cell a potential of -40 mV can be used) to help stabilize the seal. Compensate the capacitive transients due to the pipette capacitance with the relative commands on the patch amplifier and/or the patch control software.\nBreak the membrane to allow electrical access to the cell cytoplasm by applying a brief and intense suction pulse to the pipette. Set the patch amplifier to current clamp mode (I = 0, i.e., with no current injected into the cell) to track the cell membrane potential. Wait few minutes to see if the cell potential is stable.\nApply the desired illumination protocol to the cell and record the effect on the membrane potential.\n\t\tNote: The illumination can be delivered to the sample either from the bottom or from the top, depending on the microscope architecture.\n\t\t\nSelect an excitation wavelength that is well absorbed by the active material; for the P3HT:PCBM blend, a wavelength in the 450-600 nm range can be used. Suitable photoexcitation densities are in the range 10-100 mW/mm2.\n\t\t\tNote: Short pulses of light (below 10-20 msec) result in a transient depolarization of the cell, while with prolonged illumination (hundreds of milliseconds or longer pulses) a sustained hyperpolarization is observed until the light is switched off.\nSubscription Required.
