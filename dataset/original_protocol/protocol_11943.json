    "The use of human samples for this study was approved by the ethical committee of Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine (approval no. 1370 and 1694) and conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines.\n1. Isolation and Culture of UC-MSCs\nNOTE: UC-MSCs have been successfully isolated, cultured, and expanded (more than passage number 4) from more than 200 UCs subjected to this protocol. Among more than 200 UCs, 100% have shown successful UC-MSC isolation, less than 5% have shown accidental contamination, less than 15% have shown growth arrest, and more than 80% have shown successful UC-MSC expansion.\nCollect UC.\nPrepare a 50 mL plastic tube, an aseptic scissor, and a 500 mL bottle of alpha modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (alpha MEM) at 4 °C.\nAseptically cut out UC with a surgical scissor at approximately 5-10 cm in length and collect it soon after newborn birth by cesarean section.\nImmediately place the UC in a 50 mL plastic tube and add 20-30 mL of alpha MEM into the tube.\nStore the UC at room temperature (RT) until it is transported to the laboratory.\nNOTE: Aseptic UC can be stored in serum-free medium at RT for up to 2 days. Therefore, UC obtained from neighboring hospitals can be collected if it is delivered to the lab within 2 days.\nDissect UC.\nPrepare a plastic tray, sterilized scissors and forceps, 10 mL pipettes, 25 mL pipettes, two 60 mm tissue culture dishes, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), purified enzyme blends (see Table of Materials, reconstituted with sterile PBS in a concentration of 13 Wünsch units/mL and stored at -80 °C), and a 500 mL bottle of reduced serum medium (see Table of Materials).",
    "Warm up the PBS, purified enzyme blends, reduced serum medium, and culture medium [alpha MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (AA) stored at 4 °C] to RT.\nTake out the UC from the tube and place it in a plastic tray.\nWeigh and dissect 5 g of UC with a sterilized scissor.\nPour 10 mL of 70% ethanol over the UC for sterilization using a 10 mL pipette.\nWash the UC with 10 mL of PBS twice using a 10 mL pipette.\nPlace the UC in a sterilized 60 mm tissue culture dish (see Figure 1, step 1).\nAdd 10 mL of reduced serum medium into the dish.\nAdd 0.5 mL of purified enzyme blends to reach a final concentration of approximately 0.62 Wünsch units/mL.\nNOTE: The use of purified enzyme blends instead of traditional collagenase has been shown to improve the yield and viability of UC-MSCs isolated from UC.\nCut the UC into 2-3 mm pieces with sterilized scissors and forceps (see Figure 1, step 2).\nNOTE: This process takes about 30 min.\nIncubate the UC pieces at 37 °C for 30 min in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nCut the partially-digested UC pieces into smaller pieces that easily flow through a 25 mL pipette.\nNOTE: This process takes about 30 min.\nIncubate the smaller UC pieces at 37 °C for 15-45 min in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nNOTE: Incubation needs to continue until the homogenates become viscous. The total digestion time is approximately 120 min. In the case of using UCs from preterm infants, however, the digestion time can be shortened because those are easily cut and digested.\nIsolate UC-MSCs.\nPrepare four 50 mL plastic tubes and a 500 mL bottle of culture medium.",
    "Divide the UC homogenate into two 50 mL plastic tubes using a 25 mL pipette, with approximately 7.5 mL in each tube.\nAdd 20 mL of culture medium into each tube and mix well.\nFilter each UC homogenate through a 100 µm cell strainer placed on top of a new 50 mL collection tube, using a 25 mL pipette to collect UC-derived cells.\nNOTE: This process takes about 15 min each, as the digested UC solution is sticky.\nCentrifuge two tubes at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and discard it.\nResuspend the cell pellets in two tubes with 5 mL of culture medium.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a new 60 mm plate and culture at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator (see Figure 1, step 3).\nCulture UC-MSCs.\nWarm up the PBS, trypsin-EDTA (0.25 w/v%), and culture medium (alpha MEM containing 10% FBS and 1% AA) to RT.\nWhen cells are attached to a 60 mm plate, remove the culture medium and wash with 5 mL of PBS twice to remove debris and red blood cells.\nNOTE: Attached cells usually appear at 3-5 days after initial plating (see Figure 1, step 4).\nReplace the culture medium twice per week and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator until 90-100% confluency.\nNOTE: This usually takes 7-14 days after initial plating.\nWash cells with 5 mL of PBS twice, add 0.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA, and incubate at 37 °C for 5-10 min.\nWhen cells become rounded and detached, add 9 mL of culture medium and mix well to inactivate trypsin.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a new 100 mm plate and culture at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator (see Figure 1, step 5).",
    "Replace the culture medium twice per week and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator until 90-100% confluency.\nNOTE: This usually takes 4-8 days after initial plating.\nWash cells with 10 mL of PBS twice, add 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA, and incubate at 37 °C for 5-10 min.\nWhen cells become rounded and detached, add 9 mL of culture medium and mix well to inactivate trypsin.\nTransfer the cell suspension into two new 100 mm plates and culture at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator (see Figure 1, step 5).\nRepeat subculture (1:2 splits) until tenth passage (see Figure 1, step 5).\nNOTE: Because cells cultured under less confluent conditions tend to reach earlier proliferation arrest, it is important to passage cells with a split ratio of 1:2.\nUse cells at fifth to eighth passage for cell surface marker analysis, cell differentiation assay, and other experiments.\nNOTE: To keep the vigorous proliferation for as long as possible, cells are generally cultured under more than 70-80% confluent conditions.\n2. Surface Marker Expression of UC-MSCs\nPrepare cells in a 100 mm plate and dissociate them with 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5-10 min.\nAdd 9 mL of culture medium and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and discard it.\nResuspend the cell pellets with 10 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min. Repeat this washing step twice.\nResuspend cells with flow cytometry (FCM) buffer (PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 10% blocking reagent) at ~1 × 106 cells/mL.\nTransfer 50-100 µL of cell suspension into a 1.5 mL tube; add phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies against CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105, or HLA-DR; and incubate on ice for 45 min.",
    "Wash cells with FCM buffer twice and add 50-100 µL of 0.2% viability dye solution (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate at RT for 15 min, wash cells with FCM buffer twice, and filter cells through a 70 µm cell strainer.\nRun cells through the FCM and analyze the obtained results using FCM software according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n3. Trilineage Differentiation of UC-MSCs\nPerform adipogenesis.\nPrepare a cell suspension in culture medium at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/mL.\nPlate 1 mL of cell suspension in a 12-well plate and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for ~24 h.\nReplace the culture medium with adipogenic differentiation medium (see Table of Materials) and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2-3 weeks. Change adipogenic differentiation medium twice a week.\nWash cells with PBS three times.\nIncubate cells in 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 min at RT.\nWash cells with PBS three times and with 60% isopropanol three times.\nPrepare 0.5% oil red O solution by dissolving 84 mg of oil red O in 10 mL of 100% isopropanol and adding 6.7 mL of distilled water. Stain cells with 1 mL of 0.5% oil red O solution at RT for 20 min.\nWash cells with 60% isopropanol three times and visualize under a microscope.\nPerform osteogenesis.\nPrepare a cell suspension in culture medium at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells/mL.\nPlate 1 mL of cell suspension in a 12-well plate and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for ~24 h.\nReplace the culture medium with osteogeneic differentiation medium (see Table of Materials) and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1-2 weeks. Change osteogenic differentiation medium twice a week.\nWash cells with PBS three times.",
