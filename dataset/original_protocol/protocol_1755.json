We use MRT organoids as example, but in principle the same steps can be applied to any type of organoid model.\nCollect the organoids embedded in a BME droplet with a p1000 pipette using the culture medium in the well and transfer to a 15 mL tube.\nPipette up and down to disrupt the BME droplets.\nFill up the tube with ice-cold adDMEM/F12 +++.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant.\nAdd pre-warmed (37°C) TrypLE with addition of 10 μM Y-27632 to the pellet. Use 1 mL solution per 200 μL of harvested BME.\nIncubate for 3–4 min at 37°C.\nTo mechanically dissociate the organoids, pipette up and down for 10–15 times using a fire polished glass pipette.\nVisually inspect the organoid mixture under a brightfield microscope. At this point, most of the suspension should composed out of single cells.\nOptional: if this is not the case, repeat steps 7–9 once more. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nFill up the tube with ice-cold adDMEM/F12 +++.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant.\nMeasure the pellet size using a p100/p1000 pipette set to a known volume, or make use of falcon tubes filled with standard volumes to infer the volume of the pellet. Add 70% volume of ice-cold BME to the pellet.\nOptional: if organoids tend to stick to the plastic surface of the tip when pipetting, precoat the tip by pipetting up and down with adDMEM/F12 +++.",
    "Carefully resuspend the pellet in the leftover supernatant without creating air bubbles and plate the mixture with droplets of 15–20 μL volume into prewarmed 12 well or 6 well plates.\nPlace the plate in the 37°C incubator upside down for 20–25 min, to prevent adherence of the cells to the plate bottom.\nAdd pre-warmed (37°C) organoid culture medium to the wells and inspect the culture under a brightfield microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1344-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "This section describes the harvesting, counting and preparation of the organoid solutions for dispensing into multi-well drug screening plates. We use MRT organoids as example, but the basic principles can be generally applied to any type of organoid model.\nVisually inspect the organoid cultures using a brightfield microscope to assess their viability and size. As example, MRT organoids should be at the 3–6 cells stage. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCollect the organoids embedded in a BME droplet with a p1000 pipette using the culture medium in the well and transfer to a 15 mL tube.\nFill up the tube with ice-cold adDMEM/F12 +++.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant.\nRepeat washing step by adding 10 mL of ice-cold adDMEM/F12 +++ and resuspend the pellet. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant; add 5 mL of adDMEM/F12 +++ and resuspend the pellet.\nFilter the organoid solution through a 70 μm strainer placed on top of a 50 mL tube. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nTransfer the filtered solution to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend pellet in a total volume of 1 mL, making use of ice-cold adDMEM/F12 +++ to achieve the correct volume.\nCritical: The organoid suspension must be thoroughly mixed to obtain a homogeneous solution that is devoid of cell clumps. This step is critical for an as accurate as possible estimation of the number of organoids in solution.\nTake 1–5 μL of the organoid mix and count the number of organoids using a hemocytometer.\nNote: each organoid is count as a single unit.",
    "Calculate how many organoids are present in 1 mL. If the number of organoids is sufficient, transfer the required volume to a new tube and proceed with protocol. Otherwise, re-plate the organoids as described in steps 10–16 to further expand the culture.\nNote: The total number of organoids needed depends on the number of wells required for the experiment. In the case of a 384-well plate set-up, plate 500 organoids per well (in total ∼160,000 organoids per 384-well plate).\nPrepare the organoid solution by mixing organoids, organoid culture medium and 5% vol/vol BME matrix in a 50 mL tube or a sterile flask. Mix by inversion - preventing air bubbles - and put on ice.\nNote: The total volume required depends on the number of wells that are used for the experiment. In a 384-well plate set-up, dispense a total volume of 40 μL per well, for a total of ∼ 13 mL volume per screening plate. Calculate extra volume to compensate for plating inaccuracy/dead volume needed for dispensing. We recommend calculating at least 10% extra volume/organoids per screen.\nDispensing organoid mixture into 384-well drug screening plates\nDay 4\nTiming: 30 min (per organoid line)\nThe following steps describe the plating of the organoid solution into 384-well screening plates. In order to plate the organoids in the most accurate manner make use of a reagent dispenser machine (e.g., Multidrop Combi Reagent dispenser (ThermoFisher)). The reagent dispenser should be placed on a cleaned bench or in a flow hood to ensure a sterile environment. Note that all solutions should be ice-cold to prevent polymerization and solidification of the BME in the tubing.",
    "Clean, disinfect and cool down the tubing of the reagent dispenser by flushing with 100 mL (2× 50 mL tube) of Milli Q water, followed by flushing with 100 mL of 70% vol/vol Ethanol, and finally once more with 100 mL of Milli Q water.\nWash the tubing with 25 mL PBS. To avoid medium evaporation during the experiment, dispense 40 μL of PBS solution to the wells of the 1st and 24th column (outer wells of the multi-well plate).\nPrepare the tubing for organoid solution dispensation by flushing with 25 mL of ice-cold adDMEM/F12 +++. Subsequently, plate 40 μL of adDMEM/F12 +++ solution to the wells of the 2nd and 23rd column, as well as to the top and bottom rows on the multi-well plate.\nBefore dispensing, gently invert the organoid-containing solution to ensure that the mixture is as homogenous as possible.\nEmpty the tubing and prime the organoid mixture until the solution has filled every capillary of the tubing.\nCritical: Make sure that the tubing is ice-cold before priming the organoid mixture. Proceed promptly to avoid the tubing from reaching 15°C–18°C and the BME to solidify.\nProceed with the plating of the organoid mixture to the drug screening plate by dispensing 40 μL of organoid mixture to the selected columns/wells.\nCritical: To ensure a homogeneous distribution of the organoids during dispensing, gently swirl the solution while plating. Make sure not to generate air bubbles by swirling too vigorously.\nIn a separate screening plate, dispense the organoid mixture in several (at least 3) wells to measure cell viability at timepoint 0 (T0). (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) This is described in more detail in steps 47–53.\nDirectly after finishing with dispensing the organoid mixture, empty the tubing and prime Milli Q water to start the cleaning procedure.",
    "Critical: do not leave the tubing primed with organoid mixture to avoid clogging due to BME polymerization and/or precipitation of reagents.\nContinue with the cleaning procedure by flushing the tubing with 100 mL (2× 50 mL tubes) Milli Q water, followed by 100 mL of 70% vol/vol Ethanol and again 100 mL of Milli Q water.\nVisually inspect all plates to confirm that the organoids are plated homogeneously throughout the different wells and plates.\nPlace the screening plates in an incubator at 37°C. Wait at least 4 h before proceeding with the addition of the drugs.\nOptional: Use leftover organoids for genomic DNA extraction and subsequent genotyping applications.\nCompound addition—Low throughput\nDay 4\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the addition of the compounds to the screening plates. Based on the number of compounds and concentrations to test, different automated systems for drug dispensing can be used. Here, we describe the addition of compounds for a low throughput screening using the Tecan D300e Digital Dispenser (HP). The machine should be used in a clean bench set up, preferably positioned in a chemical fume hood.\nThaw the drug aliquots. Prepare intermediate drug dilutions, if required.\nIn the Tecan D300e software, open the plating layout previously prepared (see section “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”, step 2).\nAdd the compounds and vehicle fluids to the wells following the Tecan D300e software instructions.\nPlace plates back into the incubator at 37°C.\nReadout cell viability with Cell Titer Glo 3D\nDay 9\nTiming: 45 min (per multi-well plate)\nHere, we describe the procedure for cell viability measurements using Cell Titer Glo 3D (Promega). In this protocol, the readout is performed at 2 timepoints, T0 (day of plating) and T120h (5 days, endpoint experiment).",
    "Make sure the Cell Titer Glo 3D (Promega) and the multi-well screening plates are at 21°C before starting.\nVisually inspect plates to ensure that the organoids in the wells containing the vehicle control have grown as expected. (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C) Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPrepare and clean the tubing of the multidrop Combi as illustrated in step 32.\nCritical: Use solutions stored at 16°C–24°C since temperature fluctuations can interfere with Cell Titer Glo 3D luminescence readout.\nUse the multidrop combi system to dispense 40 μL of Cell Titer Glo 3D (1:1) in each well.\nCritical: During dispensing, protect the tubing from light exposure by covering with aluminum foil.\nUse a horizontal shaker to agitate the multi-well plate(s) for 5 min at 600 rpm.\nCritical: Prior to shaking, wipe the lid of the plate from any condensed water, as this may cause bubble formation and interference with the accuracy of the readout.\nIncubate the multi-well plate(s) covered with aluminum foil for 25 min at 16°C–24°C.\nMeasure the luminescence signal per well using a suitable reader (e.g., FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech)."
