    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBiotinylation of live cells\nTiming: 45–90 min\nThis section covers APEX2-mediated proximity biotinylation, radical quenching and cell harvest exemplified for 1× 15 cm dish as start material per replicate. Dependent on the APEX2 chimera and the biotinylation levels, 1× 10 cm dish might be sufficient. Buffer volumes should be adjusted accordingly.\nCool the centrifuge (4°C), get a bucket of ice, prepare the quenching solution and thaw a biotin-phenol aliquot on ice\nGrow APEX2-expressing cells in DMEM with 10% FBS until they reach confluency of ~90%\nFor enrichment of autophagosomes, treatment with Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) at a final concentration of 200 nM for 2 h, which is a vATPase inhibitor that blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, is advisable\nDepending on the biological question, cells can be treated as required\nAdapt the medium volume to 15 mL\nPre-dilute biotin-phenol in 100 μL DMSO to avoid its precipitation in DMEM\nAdd 500 μM final concentration (500 mM stock) biotin-phenol to the medium, gently stir the dish and place the cells back in the incubator for 30 min\nTransfer the cells to a workbench for further steps\nAdd 1 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at room temperature (20°C–24°C) for exactly one minute\nImmediately pour off the medium in a waste flask and overlay cells with quenching solution, discard the medium and wash 2× more in quenching solution\nWash the cells 3× with PBS, discard the supernatant and add 2 mL of PBS\nCollect the cells using a cell scraper\nCentrifuge the cells at 1,000 × g for 3 min and discard the supernatant\nWash once more with 1 mL PBS, repeat centrifugation and discard the supernatant",
    "Note: APEX2 labeling is possible over a broad range of passage numbers but this strongly depends on the cell type that is being used.\nNote: It is advisable to intentionally vary the time of biotin-phenol incubation (step 5) and H2O2 pulsing (step 7) to probe the biotinylation capacity of a given APEX2 chimera. Guidelines for this can be found in (Hung et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Once optimal labeling conditions are determined make sure to stick to them for every dish when labeling multiple dishes at once to minimize variations between samples. This is in particular important for the stimulation with H2O2.\nNote: When working with loosely adherent cells (e.g., HEK293T), these might easily get flushed away when rinsed too many times (step 8). Here, it can make sense to rinse once with the quenching solution and then collect cells in this solution and use centrifugation to get rid of the quencher. Then wash the pellets in PBS.\nNote: Use of trypsin for harvesting cells has a negative impact on the outcome of probing proteinase K digestion by immunoblotting, so we cannot recommend this (step 10). An example is provided in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nOptional: When working with SILAC-labeling, a 1:1 protein concentration ratio between different labeling conditions (e.g., heavy/light) should be adjusted before continuation or freezing.\nNote: Suggested controls are testing the proteinase K efficiency (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) and checking for indigestible proteins by performing proteinase K digests in the presence of a membrane lysing detergent (e.g., RAPIGest) as described in the “Expected Outcome” / “Statistical Analysis” sections.\nNote: If no biotinylation can be detected, please refer to remarks on troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nPause Point: Dried cell pellets can be stored a few weeks at −80°C until further use.\nProteinase K protection\nTiming: 2–3 h",
    "This section covers homogenization of cells by douncing and proteinase K digestion to obtain only membrane-protected proteins.\nCool the centrifuge (4°C) and pre-heat an appropriate device for incubation of 1.5 mL tubes to 37°C\nThaw cell pellets on ice or continue directly with cells from step 12\nSuspend cell pellets in 1.5 mL of homogenization buffer I and transfer suspension (if necessary) to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant\nSuspend cells in 1 mL of homogenization buffer I\nApply gentle agitation on an overhead shaker at 4°C for 20 min\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C to collect the whole sample\nSuspend the cell pellet in the supernatant and transfer it to a glass 1 mL dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/621-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Dounce homogenization step\nThe cells are transferred to a glass dounce homogenizer and subjected to 70 manual strokes with a tight-fitting pestle. The picture also shows the scale of the movement in between the dounces.\nApply 70 manual strokes in order to achieve efficient rupture of cells which should be verified by light microscopy (fewer strokes might not be sufficient to achieve complete cell rupture)\nCollect the sample in a fresh 1.5 mL centrifuge tube\nBefore douncing the next sample, rinse the douncer and the pestle with ddH2O and remove all liquid\nAdd 200 μL of homogenization buffer II, mix by inverting the tube 3×\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 10 min at 4°C\nTransfer supernatant to a fresh 1.5 mL centrifuge tube\nAdd 100 μg/mL (6 μL of 20 mg/mL stock) proteinase K and 1 mM CaCl2 (12 μL of 100 mM stock)\nIncubate for 1 h at 37°C",
    "Stop proteinase K digestion by adding of 10 mM (61 μL of 200 mM stock) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF)\nMix by inverting the tube 3×\nCentrifuge at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant carefully which contains cleaved cytosolic material\nNote: To profile the protein neighborhood of an APEX2 bait, the proteinase K digestion can be left out (steps 13–21). Instead, the thawed pellet can directly be lysed in qRIPA and subjected to streptavidin pulldown and on-bead digest as described from step 22 onwards. For this purpose, 1× 10 cm dish can be enough as start material per replicate.\nNote: To control for cytosolic copurifying proteins that are insensitive to proteinase K digestion, an extra set of proteinase K treated samples can be incubated with 0.1% RAPIGestTM (1% stock in 50 mM ABC) (step 20). Proteins in this set might represent potential background proteins and could potentially be excluded from your data.\nNote: The pellet can be quite fluffy after addition of PMSF and is easily removed (step 21c). Try taking up as much supernatant as possible with a pipette rather than a vacuum pump. However, if there is some residual liquid left covering the pellet, this is not problematic as it is dissolved in excess qRIPA and will be centrifuged again later.\nNote: Glass dounce homogenizers from different companies can be used but the volume is of importance. It should not be too large, otherwise the samples will not be dounced properly. If the starting material is decreased to 1× 10 cm dish, the volumes of buffers can be decreased and also using a smaller douncer might be helpful.\nNote: To resolve potential failures in homogenization or proteinase K digestion, please refer to notes on troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].",
    "Lysis of protective endomembranes and pulldown of biotinylated proteins\nTiming: 30–80 min → 16 h incubation\nThis section describes the lysis of endomembranes and the enrichment of biotinylated proteins with a streptavidin pulldown.\nSuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL cold qRIPA buffer.\nBriefly sonify each sample for 2× 1 s or alternatively incubate the sample for 40 min on ice\nCentrifuge at minimum 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C\nIn the meantime, prepare the streptavidin-agarose beads\nAdd 75 μL of slurry beads per sample to a fresh centrifuge tube and wash 3× in 500 μL of qRIPA buffer\nIn between spin samples down at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant of each wash\nAfter the last wash remove the supernatant completely with the help of capillary tips that do not allow beads passing through\nApply the supernatant from step 22b to the pre-equilibrated beads and incubate 16 h at 4°C with overhead rotation\nNote: In order to wash the beads, it is helpful to leave a small liquid layer on top of the beads for intermediate washes; after the last wash use capillary tips to get rid of all liquid without taking up the beads (step 23d).\nNote: The incubation time with Streptavidin-agarose beads can be decreased from 16 h to only a few hours if non-specific binding of proteins to the resign is problematic. However, the pulldown efficiency at shorter incubation times should be monitored with appropriate controls before continuation (step 24).\nNote: Alternative beads like Streptavidin-sepharose or magnetic Streptavidin-agarose beads can also be used.\nOn-bead tryptic digest\nTiming: 2–3 h → 16 h incubation\nThis section covers in-solution tryptic digestion of biotinylated proteins.\nCool the centrifuge (4°C) and pre-heat a shaker to 55°C",
    "Prepare qRIPA, 3 M (in 50 mM ABC) and 2 M Urea (in 50 mM ABC) solutions and store them at 4°C until use\nTake the tubes from the overhead shaker and place them on ice\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, discard supernatant. Wash the beads 3× in 500 μL of qRIPA buffer with repeated centrifugation in between the washes, discard the supernatant each time\nWash the beads 3× in 3 M Urea with repeated centrifugation in between the washes, discard the supernatant each time\nAfter the last wash remove all liquid using capillary tips and add 500 μL of 3 M Urea buffer\nAdd TCEP to a final concentration of 5 mM (2.5 μL of 1 M stock) and incubate for 30 min at 55°C with orbital shaking at around 400 rpm\nTake the samples of the shaker and let them cool down for 10 min\nFurther steps are carried out at room temperature (20°C–24°C)\nAdd IAA to alkylate the sample to a final concentration of 10 mM (9.5 μL of 550 mM stock) and incubate for 20 min with orbital shaking at around 400 rpm\nQuench the reaction by addition of DTT to a final concentration of 20 mM (10.7 μL of 1 M stock), invert the tube 3×\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 × g, discard the supernatant\nWash 2× with 2 M Urea buffer and repeat the centrifugations\nAfter the 2nd wash carefully remove all supernatant using capillary tips and add 200 μL of 2 M Urea buffer\nMeasure the pH of each sample. It should have a pH of 8. If necessary adjust the pH",
    "Add 8 μL (1 μg/ 20 μL bead volume) Trypsin (0.5 mg/mL stock), vortex the samples briefly and incubate them at 37°C for 16 h\nNote: For adjusting the pH in step 32 addition of a few (3–10) μL of 3M Tris-HCl has proven useful but similar reagents will most likely work as well.\nElution and desalting of peptides\nTiming: 3–6 h\nThis section covers the elution of peptides from streptavidin beads following tryptic on-bead digest and the purification of eluted peptides using reversed-phase extraction disks.\nPrepare a fresh 2 M Urea solution (in 50 mM ABC)\nCentrifuge the samples at 1,000 × g and collect the supernatant which now contains digested peptides in a fresh microcentrifuge tube\nWash the beads 2× in 100 μL of 2 M Urea solution, collect the supernatant and pool it with the first supernatant\nAfter the 2nd wash be careful to take up all the liquid on the beads by using capillary tips. Make sure no beads stick to the outer wall of the tips in order to avoid transferring them to your sample\nAcidify the samples with TFA at a final concentration of 1% (e.g., from a 10% stock) and invert the tube 3×\nDry down collected supernatants (~ 440 μL) by vacuum centrifugation at 30°C to a volume of around 80–100 μL\nMix the samples 1:1 with stage tipping buffer C\nPause Point: Acidified samples (after step 36) can be stored at −80°C. However, it is advisable to decrease sample volume first.\nNote: Stage-tips can already be equilibrated (steps 39–43) during vacuum centrifugation (step 37). Leave the 2nd round of Buffer A on the stage-tips and centrifuge it immediately before addition of the samples.",
    "The next steps describe the pre-equilibration of the custom-made stage-tips (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). All centrifugations are performed at 400 × g for 1 min or less with visual inspection after each spinning step. After addition of each buffer make sure to get rid of potential bubbles by snapping the collection tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/621-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Preparation and handling of custom-made stage-tips\nIn order to generate custom-made stage-tips, a hole was inserted into a collection tube using a scalpel. Two layers of C18 disks were stacked in a 200 μL pipette tip. A syringe wrapped with parafilm is a helpful tool to manually push the buffer through the C18 disks. It is important that a small liquid layer is left over the C18 disks so that they don’t dry out.\nWash the stage tips by addition of 30 μL Methanol\nCentrifuge until only a small liquid layer is left on the C18 disk\nEmpty the collection tube\nWash the stage tips by addition of 30 μL stage-tipping buffer B\nCentrifuge until only a small liquid layer is left on the C18 disk\nEmpty the collection tube\nWash the stage tips by addition of 30 μL stage-tipping buffer A\nCentrifuge until only a small liquid layer is left on the C18 disk\nEmpty the collection tube\nRepeat step 42\nLabel the stage-tips with your sample ID and load your sample on it\nCentrifuge for 3,500 × g for 6 min\nMake sure all sample went through, if not repeat centrifugation\nCollect the flow-through and store it at −20°C. In case something went wrong you can add this to new stage-tips.\nWash the stage-tips by addition of 30 μL stage-tipping buffer A\nCentrifuge at 3,500 × g for 2 min\nDiscard the flow-through and dry the stage-tips with a syringe (push all residual liquid through)",
    "Critical: Make sure there is always some liquid left over the C18 disks until sample loading so that they do not dry out. Inspect every stage-tip after every centrifugation round and decrease centrifugation time if necessary. In case a stage-tip has dried, restart the whole washing / pre-equilibration beginning with addition of Methanol.\nNote: A syringe wrapped with parafilm can be helpful to push the buffer through in order to only obtain a small liquid layer over the C18 disks.\nPause Point: Dried stage-tips can be stored at 4°C up to half a year.\nFor elution of the sample from the stage-tip, place the latter in a new collection tube\nAdd 30 μL Buffer B to the stage-tip\nUse a syringe to push a bit of the buffer through until the C18 material is wet\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–24°C)\nPush all liquid through and discard the stage-tip\nDry down the liquid by vacuum centrifugation at 30°C to a volume of 2–3 μL\nRe-substitute the liquid with stage-tipping buffer A to a total volume of 10 μL\nTransfer the sample to a MS-compatible tube in order to store it at −20°C (short-term) or −80°C (long-term) or directly proceed with injecting the MS sample.\nPause Point: Eluted samples can be stored at −80°C for a year.\nLoad 5 μL of your sample into a 96-well plate for injecting it on your LC-MS system. Make sure not to make any bubbles. The rest of the sample can be stored as a backup."
