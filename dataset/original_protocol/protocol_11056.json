    "NOTE: Prior to starting the experiment, wear personal protective equipment, including a lab coat, gloves, and goggles. See the Table of Materials for details about materials, reagents, equipment, and software used in this protocol.\n1. Buffers required for the assay\nPrepare the buffers required for this experiment-the SELEX buffer required for aptamer folding, Blocking Buffer (BB), Wash Buffer (WB), and Binding Buffer (BiB) (Table 1)-freshly on the day of the experiment and keep them on ice or at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Each aptamer requires a unique folding condition. This includes the SELEX buffer and folding temperature conditions. Care should be taken to fully replicate the methods from the original paper describing the aptamer10. In this experiment, all buffers are prepared in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). The buffer volume required in each experiment depends on the number of cell lines, number of replicates, and number of aptamer concentrations that are tested.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\n,Ingredients,Ingredients,Volume required\n,Item,Concentration,Volume required\nSELEX buffer,MgCl2,5 mM,50 µL per sample + 10% pipetting error\nBlocking Buffer,MgCl2,5 mM,500 µL per cell line\nBlocking Buffer,BSA a,1 mg/mL,500 µL per cell line\nBlocking Buffer,tRNA b,0.1 mg/mL,500 µL per cell line\nBlocking Buffer,FBS c,10% (v/v),500 µL per cell line\nWash Buffer,MgCl2,5 mM,1 mL for the first wash + 100 µL per test sample + 10% pipetting error\nBinding Buffer,MgCl2,5 mM,50 µL per sample + 10% pipetting error\nBinding Buffer,BSA,2 mg/mL,50 µL per sample + 10% pipetting error\nBinding Buffer,tRNA,0.2 mg/mL,50 µL per sample + 10% pipetting error\nBinding Buffer,FBS,20% (v/v),50 µL per sample + 10% pipetting error\nTable 1: Buffers required for the binding assay. aBovine Serum Albumin, bTransfer Ribonucleic Acid, cFetal Bovine Serum.\n2. Preparation of aptamers",
    "NOTE: The aptamers used in the assay are tagged with a fluorescence reporter molecule, and therefore care should be taken to protect them from light.\nPrior to the experiment, prepare a 100 µM stock (stock A) of test and control aptamers using pyrogen- and RNase-free ultrapure water (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: For long-term preservation, stock A should be kept in a freezer at -20 °C.\nPrepare stock B as the working concentration of aptamers by diluting stock A using SELEX buffer (Table 1). To follow this protocol, dilute stock A to a 1,000 nM stock to prepare stock B (Figure 1).\nTo make the aptamer ready for the formation of the 3-dimensional (3D) structure, in a 250 µL tube, dilute stock B with SELEX buffer to prepare the required volume and concentration of the aptamer for folding.\n\tNOTE: The folded aptamers will be exposed to an equal volume of cells. Therefore, the concentration of the aptamer that is set for folding should be 2x more concentrated than the desired final concentration. Use equation (1) to calculate the required volumes and concentrations. Remember to consider an extra 10% volume for the pipetting error.\n\tConcentrationstock A × Volumestock A = Concentrationstock B × Volumestock B  (1)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64304/64304fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: A diagram showing the steps in the preparation of aptamers. 1Stock 1 is stored at -20 °C for long-term preservation. 2Working concentrations are prepared in SELEX buffer and are not stored.

    "NOTE: Prior to commencement of the study, make sure that the cells are at their early passage numbers, show their typical morphological features, and are mycoplasma free. To test the selectivity and specificity of the aptamer, cell lines that are high, moderate, and low/negative expressors of the protein of interest are ideally required.\nSeed the cells in a T75 culture flask, using appropriate culture conditions. Grow them in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator, at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: In this study, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium) was used.\nWhen the cells reach ~80% confluency, passage them to a new flask containing fresh complete medium.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the protein of interest and the cell line, 80% confluency could provide a suitable cell population for the binding assay. For the cell lines in this experiment, MDA-MB-231 and HEK 293T, 80% confluency is suitable. At this stage, proceed to section 4, the binding assay. Always check the expression of the protein of interest, using mAbs specific for that protein.\n4. Binding assay\nNOTE: Figure 2 summarizes the steps required in the binding assay in adherent cells.\nIn a class II biosafety cabinet, collect the cells of each flask in tubes as follows:\n\t\nCollect and discard the media in the flask, add 2 mL of PBS, spread it over the cells, and then, collect and discard the PBS. Repeat this step twice more to remove all traces of media that may inactivate trypsin. Add 1 mL of 0.25% of trypsin/EDTA to each flask and incubate for 5-10 min at 37 oC. Visualize the detachment of cells under a microscope.",
    "Add 1 mL of complete medium to the cells, and pipette the cells up and down to make a single-cell suspension. Pipette the cells into an appropriate tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: For non-adherent cells, collect the cells in a tube, centrifuge (200 × g, 5 min), and proceed to step 4.1.3.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of fresh medium. Count the cells using trypan blue staining, by diluting a certain volume of cell suspension with trypan blue. Distribute ~15 µL of the mixture between a hemocytometer and a cover glass. Count the cells as previously described18, using equation (2):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64304/64304eq01.jpg (2)\n\t\tNOTE: Use the minimum possible volume of cell suspension and take a note of the dilution factor. For example, mixing equal volumes of cell suspension and 0.04% trypan blue gives a dilution factor of 2. Ensure high viability (live cells/total cells × 100) of ~90% for most adherent cell lines before proceeding. Dead cells non-specifically take up aptamers and alter the results19. It is possible to use other cell counting techniques, such as using a cell counter.\nCollect the required number of cells, making sure to have 10 × 104 cells per test sample. Consider an extra 10% volume for pipetting error.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to always keep the same cell count between experiments and replicates.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C for 2 h to allow for the stabilization of the protein of interest on the cell membrane following enzymatic detachment.\n\t\tNOTE: This incubation period might differ according to the protein of interest.\nDuring this 2 h incubation:",
    "Set the temperature of the centrifuge to 4 °C. Leave tRNA and stocks of aptamer at room temperature or on ice to thaw. To protect the fluorescence reporter molecule, protect the aptamer tubes from light.\n\t\tNOTE: The role of tRNA is to block the nucleic acid binding sites.\nPrepare the SELEX buffer, BB, WB, and BiB (see section 1), keeping them all on ice or at 4 °C. Set the thermocycler machine on an empty cycle. Place a 96-well black plate and flow cytometry tubes on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Setting the thermocycler on an empty cycle prepares the cooling and heating system and helps generate more reproducible results.\nFollowing the 2 h incubation, centrifuge the cells at 500 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 500 µL of BB. Incubate the cells at 4 °C for 30 min with intermittent mixing.\nDuring this 30 min incubation, perform aptamer folding as follows:\n\t\nMake up the 2x concentrations of aptamers (see section 2), and then mix and incubate the aptamers in the thermocycler machine, according to the required folding conditions. For this EpCAM aptamer, use the following folding conditions of 95 °C, 5 min, followed by 22 °C, 10 min, and 37 °C, 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Always include a negative control (i.e., SELEX buffer without aptamers).\nFollowing the 30 min incubation, centrifuge the cells (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), remove the supernatant, add 1 mL of WB, and centrifuge the cells again (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in a suitable volume of the BiB.\nPipette 50 µL of the resuspended cells into each well of an ice-cold, 96-well black plate. Keep the cells on ice to inhibit internalization of the protein of interest.",
    "Pipette 50 µL of the aptamers onto a 50 µL volume of cells, mix, and incubate in darkness at 4 °C for 30 min. Centrifuge the plate at 500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C, and carefully remove the supernatant.\nCarefully resuspend the pellet in WB and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min. Repeat the wash step (4.7) 2x and resuspend in 100 µL of WB for flow cytometric analysis.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 3 for a diagram of interactions between aptamers and cells.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64304/64304fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: A diagram depicting the steps in performing an aptamer-protein-binding assay.

Flow cytometry and data analysis\nNOTE: Before turning on the flow cytometer, make sure that there are no \"bubbles\" in the membrane filter units for the shut-down solution, cleaning solution, and sheath fluid (0.9% NaCl). \"Bleed out\" bubbles if there are bubbles in the capsules. Make sure that the waste container is empty, and containers of sheath fluid, water, and 1% bleach in ultrapure water are full.\nTurn on the flow cytometer and then the computer.\n\tNOTE: The details of running the flow cytometer explained here are specific to the machine and software demonstrated in the video (see Table of Materials). Other software would require appropriate training to use.",
    "Open the flow cytometry analysis software, log in to the program, and under the Cytometer tab, run Fluidics Start up.\nTo create a new experiment, under the experiment tab, click New Folder and name the folder/experiment appropriately.\nClick on new folder to highlight, then under the experiment tab again, click New Experiment and name the experiment appropriately.\nTo add the first sample/specimen, under the experiment tab, click New Specimen and name this specimen appropriately (name of cell line/control sample/ experiment sample).\nTo add a tube sample, highlight the specimen (group) and under the experiment tab, click New Tube. Add the appropriate number of tubes and name.\nTo prepare the required graphs, under the worksheet tab, open a new worksheet. Once the new worksheet window pops up, open the following using the worksheet screen (hover the mouse across the logo/pictures to find the names):\n\t\nPrepare a dot blot graph of forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SCC) to select the population of interest. Define the first gate by identifying and selecting the population of interest (P1) in a forward and side scatter density plot. Exclude the debris, which constitutes the population with the lowest forward scatter signal.\n\t\tNOTE: The FSC parameter detects cells or events based on their size and the SCC discriminates them based on their granularity20.\nPrepare a dot blot graph of FSC-area (FSC-A) versus FSC-height (FSC-H) to select the single-cell population. Define the second gate by excluding doublet cell populations, as doublet cells considerably affect the results and conclusions. Exclude doublets by using FSC-H versus FSC-A density plots, where cells of the same size show a similar area and height. Hence, the singlets get clustered diagonally and separated from doublets.",
    "NOTE: FSC is roughly proportional to the cell size. The voltage pulses are defined as FSC-H, the intensity of the signal, FSC-width that reflects cell size and the duration of the signal, and FSC-A, which is H × W. Doublets have a double width and area value; therefore, gating for singlets is based on detecting disproportions between H, W, and A caused by doublets.\nPrepare a histogram of the number of events against the fluorophore of interest.\nBefore starting flow cytometry, ensure that the acquisition dashboard for controlling the sample acquisition, inspector, and cytometer to adjust voltage parameters, as well as the worksheet with all the graphs are open.\n\tNOTE: At least 100 µL of a 10 × 104 cell suspension in a flow cytometry tube is needed to perform the analysis. Especially in case of lower viabilities, propidium iodide staining can be performed to select the viable cell population21,22.\nTo run the first sample, on the left-hand side of the screen make sure the arrow pointing to the tube is green. If this arrow is not green, click on the arrow to make it green.\nUsing a pipette, transfer each sample from the 96-well black plate to a flow cytometry tube. Run the untreated, unstained control sample on a low speed.\nOn the acquisition dashboard, choose an appropriate number of events to record (30,000), change the flow rate to low, and click Acquire Data.\nAdjust the voltage for the FSC and SCC parameters. Ensure the cell population is centralized within the dot plot and that no cells are touching either axis of the graph to avoid losing the cells of interest.\nIncrease the acquisition speed to medium or high to analyze the samples faster but do not exceed more than 200 events/s. Then, click Record Data.",
    "Perform the gating for P1 (Figure 4A) and the single-cell population (Figure 4B). Construct the histogram of events against the used fluorochrome and select P1 based on the data (allophycocyanin (APC) in this case) (Figure 4C).\nAfter adjusting the voltage, gating and recording the data, take out the sample and click Next Tube.\nInsert the next sample, and repeat recording data for all control and test samples (Figure 3).\nOnce all the data are collected, wash the flow cytometer by running three tubes of 50% bleach, FACS rinse, and ultrapure water, each for 5 min at a high flow rate.\nThen, from the Cytometer dropdown menu, click Fluidics Shut Down.\nPrior to closing the software and turning off the machine and the computer, export the results as .fcs files to a USB drive to transfer and analyze them, as follows:\n\t\nIn the analysis software, press the NEW button to create a new document and window to handle the analysis. Drag the sample files into the new window.\nDouble-click to open the unstained sample. Choose the P1 population, double-click on the P1 population to create a FSC-H versus FSC-A graph, and gate the single-cell population.\nDouble-click on the gated single cells to create a histogram of events against the used fluorochrome.\nIn the original window, select P1 and single cells and drag them to All Samples so that all samples now contain the same gating.\nClick on the Layout Editor button to open the Layouts window. Drag two samples (control and test) over one another to create an overlay histogram.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
