    "1. Algisyl-LVR Implant Procedure (Refer to video)\nAlgisyl-LVR (LoneStar Heart, Inc. Laguna Hills, CA) is a Calcium-Alginate hydrogel consisting of two components. The Na+-Alginate component is a sterile aqueous solution with 4.6% mannitol and the Ca2+-Alginate component consists of water insoluble particles suspended in a sterile 4.6% mannitol solution (00:27).\nThe procedure for implant placement can be performed using either a standard sternotomy or a small limited anterior thoracotomy on the beating heart. Cardiopulmonary bypass is not needed for the procedure.\nRight before use, mix the Na+-Alginate component and the Ca+-Alginate component by combining these two components into one syringe for intramyocardial injections (00:33).\nAfter 2 minutes, the two different alginate types will cross-link and form a gel that is ready for implant and placement in the myocardium via an injection.\nIdentify the free wall of the LV at the mid-ventricular level halfway between the LV apex and base (00:44)\nStarting from the antero-septal groove at the mid-ventricular level, insert the needle at an approximately 45-degree angle and inject 0.3cc of Algisyl-LVR slowly (0.1 ml per second) in one uninterrupted motion (01:15).\nRepeat the injection (step 6) at 10 to 19 sites in a single line (circumferentially) along the mid-ventricular level, starting from the antero-septal groove and ending at the postero-septal groove. The number of implants is dictated by the size of the ventricle, spacing the implants approximately 1 cm apart.\n2. Quantification of Left Ventricular Stress Using Mathematical Modeling\nBefore using mathematical modeling to quantify LV wall stress, one must have already obtained the short axis and long axis view of the magnetic resonance images (MRI) containing the LV of the patient. Acquisition of these images can be performed using standard MRI protocol (e.g. Zhang et al.20).",
    "Digitize the endocardial surface and epicardial surface of the LV from the MR images containing the short-axis (SA) view of the LV. This can be done using the Contour Segmentation Object (CSO) library found in the freely-available software MevisLab.\n\t\nIn our laboratory, we have created a program based on the modules found in the CSO library of MevisLab so that one simply \"contours\" the endocardial and epicardial boundary found in the SA view of the MR images containing the LV. Points of the epicardium and the endocardium in real three-dimensional (3D) space are then automatically generated from these contours.\nImport the 3D points from step 2 into a commercial software, Rapidform (INUS Technology, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA), to create surfaces of the LV epicardium and the endocardium in the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) format. The steps used in creating these IGES surfaces in Rapidform are:\n\t\nInsert/Import.\nCreate polygon mesh.\nOutput IGES surfaces.\nImport the IGES surfaces into the commercial software TrueGrid to create an FE mesh of the LV.\n\t\nFill the space between the endocardial and epicardial surface with the eight-node trilinear brick element. In general, a mesh containing about 3,000 elements with 3 elements through the wall thickness is sufficient to model the LV21.\nOnce this is completed, export the mesh as an input deck for the FE solver LS-DYNA (LSTC, Livermore, CA). More details of this process can be found in Guccione et al.23.",
    "Assign the myofiber directions using our in-house software \"Closer\" that modifies the input deck exported from TrueGrid. Closer assigns the myofiber direction in each element as a vector that is parallel to the local epicardial tangent plane. This vector is oriented at an angle measured with respect to the local circumferential direction. In human LV, this angle is set to vary linearly across the wall thickness from -60 ° at the epicardium to 60 ° at the endocardium23.\nWrite the boundary conditions and assign the myocardial material model to the elements in the input deck from step 5.\n\t\nImpose nodal displacements at the LV base with the keyword \"SPC\" in LS-DYNA. The nodes in the epicardial-basal ring are fixed and the rest of the nodes at the LV base are constrained to move only on the basal plane.\nAssign a constitutive law or stress-strain relationship described earlier (see \"Introduction\") to all the elements using the keyword \"MAT\" with material identity 128 in LS-DYNA.\nDefine the elemental surfaces making up the endocardium and impose pressure boundary conditions with the keyword \"LOAD_SEGMENTS\".\nDefine a pressure-time load curve using the keyword \"DEFINE_CURVE\".\n\t\t\nTo simulate end of diastole, prescribe a pressure that increases rapidly with time to a prescribed end-diastolic pressure (EDP) of 20mmHg. The pressure is kept constant at EDP and sufficient time is then allowed for the LV to reach steady-state.\nTo simulate end of systole, prescribe a pressure that increases rapidly with time from the end-diastolic state until a prescribed end-systolic pressure (ESP) of 125mmHg is achieved. The pressure is kept constant at ESP and sufficient time is then allowed for the LV to reach steady-state.",
    "Import the completed input deck into the commercial FE solver LS-DYNA to compute the ventricular wall stresses and the LV cavity volume at end of diastole and at end of systole.\nAdjust the material parameters reflecting the passive stiffness and the contractility of the myocardium until the computed LV cavity volume matches the MRI-measured volume at end of diastole and end of systole."
