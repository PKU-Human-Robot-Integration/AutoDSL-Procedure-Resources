    "Note: Fresh cell pellets are recommended\n      for immediate purification procedure due to likely higher protein yield\n      and maintenance of protein activity.\n    \nLtCas12a protein purification\nTiming: 3 days\n      Purification of LtCas12a could be carried out through affinity\n      chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration\n      chromatography. To obtain active LtCas12a, the following steps should be\n      paid attention to.\n    \n        Cell lysis.\n        \n            Add 0.35 mL PMSF (100 mM) and 4.90 μL β-Mercaptoethanol (14.3 M)\n            into the cell suspension (total suspension volume is approximately\n            35 mL, including cell pellets and 30 mL resuspension buffer) to\n            reach the final concentration of 1 mM PMSF and 2 mM\n            β-Mercaptoethanol.\n          \n            Transfer the cell suspension to a high-pressure homogenizer (JNBIO,\n            JN-2.5, Beijing, China) for cell disruption under the pressure of\n            1000 bar at 4°C.\n          \n            Perform cell crushing (2 s ultrasonication and 4 s pause in each\n            cycle for 15 min with a power setting of 300 W) on ice using a probe\n            sonicator (Scientz, JY92-IIN, Ningbo, China).\n          \n            Centrifuge the sample at 39,190 × g at 4°C for 1.5 h and\n            collect the lysate supernatant.\n          \n            Filter the supernatant through 0.45 μm filter paper (PALL\n            Corporation, USA) or 0.45 μm MILLEX-HV syringe filter (Merck\n            Millipore).\n          \nNote: For maintenance of LtCas12a nuclease\n      activity, all the protein purification procedures are performed on the ice\n      or at 4°C after the cell lysis.\n    \nCritical: PMSF (protease inhibitor)\n      must be added to lysis buffer before cell lysis to minimize damage to the\n      target protein. Moreover, the reducing agent β-Mercaptoethanol is needed\n      to prevent proteins from forming intermolecular or intramolecular\n      disulfide bonds.\n    \n        Nickel affinity chromatography.\n        \n            Equilibrate gravity flow column packed with 2 mL\n            Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Cytiva, Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow) with\n            10 column volumes equilibration buffer (40 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mM\n            NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, 5% Glycerol, and 2 mM β-Mercaptoethanol) at\n            4°C.",

In addition, this step may avoid\n      complete protein loss due to operational mistakes.\n    \n        Dialysis and digestion.\n        \n            For dialysis, place the eluted product into a dialysis bag (Asegene,\n            Guangdong, China) having an appropriate molecular-weight cut-off\n            membrane (such as 20kDa).\n          \n            Prior to dialysis, add 1 mg TEV protease (produced by our lab) into\n            the mixture contained in the dialysis bag5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\n            to remove the 6xHis-MBP tag.\n          \n            Seal the dialysis apparatus at both ends and incubate the assembly\n            in a 2 L beaker filled with dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5),\n            250 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, and 2 mM β-Mercaptoethanol) with a stir\n            bar to complete digestion and dialysis for 24 h at 4°C.\n          \n            Analyze all the products generated by each step through sodium\n            dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\n          \n        A second run of Nickel affinity chromatography.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\n            Load the dialysis solution onto the Ni2+-NTA resin column\n            and collect the flow-through fraction (targeted protein without His\n            tag).\n          \n            Wash the column with washing buffer 2 (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM\n            NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, 5% Glycerol, and 2 mM β-Mercaptoethanol).\n          \n            Elute the column with elution buffer 2 (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM\n            NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole, 5% Glycerol, and 2 mM β-Mercaptoethanol).",
    "Conduct the SDS-PAGE analysis for all the step products.\nNote: When loading solution onto\n      Ni2+-NTA resin column, gentle dripping is recommended to avoid\n      protein combination dysfunction caused by the uneven force of the resin.\n    \n        Ion exchange chromatography (IEC).\n        \n            Equilibrate SP Sepharose HP cation exchange column (Cytiva,\n            Marlborough, MA, USA) with 5–10 column volumes buffer A (20 mM Tris\n            (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, and 5% Glycerol).\n          \n            Pump the protein solution into the column for purification with the\n            flow rate of 2.5 mL/min using a pure protein purification system\n            (Inscinstech, Unique AutoPure100).\n          \n            Perform additional purification by column elution with a continuous\n            linear NaCl gradient from 0.25 to 1 M concentrations (buffer A:\n            20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, and 5% Glycerol; buffer B: 20 mM\n            Tris (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, and 5% Glycerol) at 2.5 mL/min flow rate\n            for 50 min.\n          \n            Collect the eluents using an automatic fraction collector, 1.8 mL\n            per EP tube named from A1 to A15, B1 to B15, C1 to C15, etc.\n          \nAnalyze the peak fractions by SDS-PAGE.\n        Gel filtration chromatography.\n        \n            Pooled the peak fractions from the ion exchange chromatography\n            together.\n          \n            Concentrate protein product to 2 mL via 100 kDa ultrafiltration tube\n            and centrifugation (3000g, 4°C).\n          \n            Equilibrate Superdex200 pg 16/200 gel filtration column (Cytiva,\n            Marlborough, MA, USA) with 1.5 column volumes size exclusion\n            chromatography (SEC) buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, and\n            2 mM β-Mercaptoethanol).\n          \n            Use the protein purifier (Inscinstech, Unique AutoPure100) for\n            further protein purification and inject the concentrated protein\n            product into the gel filtration column.\n          \n            Wash the column with SEC buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl,\n            and 2mM β-Mercaptoethanol).\n          \n            Collect the eluents using an automatic fraction collector, 1.8 mL\n            per EP tube named from A1 to A15, B1 to B15, C1 to C15, etc.",
