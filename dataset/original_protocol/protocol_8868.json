    "1. The two fully automated systems (initial screening)\nSystem 1: preparation of 72 96-well crystallization plates filled with screening kits (LMB plates)\nPrior to performing the procedure, ensure that the system's robots are initialized and their controlling software is open. Turn on the chiller of the tube-cooling carrier about 30 minutes before the main program will be started.\nPlace a test plate on the motorized SBS carrier of the plate sealer. Run the plate sealer and check that the film is properly applied. Repeat this test twice more to verify that the plate sealer is ready.\nThen, add 20 L of deionized water to the main container of the liquid handler. Disconnect the coupling inserts from the small container (20% ethanol rinsing solution) and connect the inserts to the main container.\nEnter the appropriate screen name (Table 1) on the inkjet printer touchscreen. Then, open and close the carousel door to trigger the carousel rotation. Open the door when the first stack presents itself.\nFully load the first stack with 22 crystallization plates, each with column 1 facing out. Fully load the next two stacks in the same way.\nLoad the remaining 6 plates in the highest positions of the fourth stack. Then, close the carousel door.\nVerify that the chiller display indicates 14 °C. Gently and repeatedly invert the selected screening kits for 1 minute. Then, open the front panel of the liquid handler.\nOpen the tubes and place them in the cooling carrier according to the standard 96-well layout (A1, A2, etc.). Upon placing each tube in the carrier, place its lid on a tray in the same 96-well layout.\nCross-check the tube positions and ensure that all tubes are level and settled in the carrier. Then, close the front panel.",
    "In the 'Startup' window of the liquid handler software, select 'Run maintenance' and open the flushing program. Run the program to flush the 20% ethanol from the system and to wash the outsides of the liquid-dispensing tips.\nWhen flushing is complete, click 'Cancel' to return to 'Startup'. Select 'Run an existing process' and click 'Start your selection'. Open the 'MRC kit dispensing' program. Fill in '18' for 'Instances' in the configuration screen and run the program.\nMonitor the system as the first four plates are labeled, filled, and sealed.\nOnce all 72 plates have been prepared and placed back in the carousel, switch the coupling inserts from the main container to the small container. Run the 'Start up flush' program (see step 1.1.10).\nTurn off the chiller and discard the empty screening kit tubes. Carefully remove the 72 prepared plates from the carousel. Discard incorrectly-filled or poorly-sealed plates. Store the ready-to-use plates at 10 °C.\nSystem 2: setting up crystallization droplets (100 nL protein + 100 nL condition) from a single sample in 20 LMB plates\nFirst, ensure that the system's robots are on, the nanoliter dispenser is initialized with its software open, and the liquid handler's method manager is open. Turn on the microtube-cooling carrier about 15 minutes before the main program will be started.\nPlace a test plate on the motorized SBS carrier of the plate sealer. Run the plate sealer and verify that the plate is properly sealed. Test the plate sealer three times.\nThen, run the nanoliter dispenser to set 100-nL droplets of test solution in a test plate. Check under a microscope that the droplets are set correctly. Close the nanoliter dispenser software and remove the strip-holder block from the deck.",
    "Next, insert in the custom-designed plate holder (see Representative Results: Crystallization Devices Developed at the LMB) the LMB plate with the highest relative quantity of volatile reagents in its conditions (Table 1). Remove the adhesive film from the plate.\nOpen the liquid handler front panel and place the unsealed plate on the deck, at the back of the first sliding carrier (Sliding carriers may be pulled out for ease of access).\nCover the plate with an SBS aluminum lid. Settle the lid towards the rear left corner of the carrier by applying gentle pressure to the opposite corner of the lid.\nUnseal, load into the sliding carriers, and cover the remaining 19 plates in the same way, working from most to least volatile conditions. Once the microtube-cooling carrier is at 4 °C, as indicated by a green light, remove its cover.\nCut off the lid of a microtube containing (at least) 440 µL of protein sample (Table 2). Ensure that the sample has no foam above the meniscus, as this will interfere with the liquid detection system. Place the tube in Position 1 of the microtube-cooling carrier.\nPlace a PCR plate on the liquid handler deck in front of the plate-moving adapter carrier. Then, close the front panel.\nAfter loading the deck, ensure that the nanoliter dispenser deck is clear of the strip-holder block and that the carriers at the back of the 50-µL tip stacks are clear of the aluminum SBS lids.\nIn the liquid handler 'Method Management' interface, select 'Setup plates'. Monitor the initialization of both systems and fill in the run parameters. Follow the guidelines of the Method Management interface (prompts, figures and a tip-management system help with preparation).\nDouble-check that all required components are ready, and then start the process.",
    "Monitor the system as the nanoliter dispenser sets the drops in the first plate and the plate sealer subsequently seals the plate.\nOnce all 20 plates have been prepared with crystallization droplets and automatically returned to the sliding carriers, open the front panel and gently remove the plates. Check that the plates are correctly sealed before storing them for crystallization.\nClean the SBS lids with a 20% ethanol solution before stacking them on the left-hand side of the liquid handler for storage. Discard the PCR plate and the microtube.\nTurn off the microtube-cooling carrier and wipe away the condensation. Leave a paper towel on top of the cooler surface to absorb further condensation. Then, replace the carrier cover and close the front panel.\n2. Optimization of the conditions\nSyringe-based liquid handler: producing two linear gradients of concentrations into the reservoirs of a crystallization plate (the 4-corner method).\nFirst, ensure that the liquid handler is on and initialized with its software open.\nOn the 'GRADIENT' tab: Open the required program, select the crystallization plate type and the final volume in the reservoirs (Table 3). The advanced setting for 'max shot vol' should be lowered from 6,000 to 3,000 when using solutions containing [isopropanol] > 10% v/v and [MPD] > 20% v/v.\nPrepare the syringes. Place a piston in each syringe (pointed ends down) and insert the back of the syringes into the designated grooves underneath the robot head. Twist a syringe clockwise to lock it in position (The program will start only with all the required syringes attached correctly).",
    "Prepare the troughs. Remove the stainless-steel frame and insert the troughs. The 4 positions on the left correspond to the 4 corners A, B, C, D. Switch to 'SET UP' tab which displays the volumes of solutions required in each syringe (on Table 3, 0.5 mL dead volume was added to the volumes displayed). Pour the corner solutions into their respective troughs and place the frame back on the deck (the frame holds in position with 2 small magnets located at the front of the deck). An alternative way to proceed with this step is to pour the solutions into the troughs when they are already placed on the deck.\nPlace the crystallization plate on the motorized SBS carrier.\nClick 'ASPIRATE' and wait for this step to be completed (when pistons stopped on their way up).\nSwitch to the 'RUN' tab and run program.\nUpon completion of the program, go back to the SET UP tab and click 'REMOVE': the system purges the syringes from leftover solutions, and then lifts the pistons all the way up. 'PURGE' may be requested instead of 'REMOVE'; this will leave the pistons at the bottom position, ready to aspirate more solutions with the same syringes.\nRemove the syringes by twisting them anticlockwise.\nDiscard syringes and troughs in the appropriate bin (or rinse them with deionized water and then 20% v/v ethanol solution for reuse).\nSeal the plate and place it onto the microplate mixer for 3 min at 1,000 rpm, or 10 min when highly viscous solutions are being mixed. The plate is ready for setting up crystallization droplets on the nanoliter dispenser.\nAdditive screening protocol 1 (setting up crystallization droplets in a 96-well crystallization plate pre-filled with additive screen)",
    "First, prepare the condition with initial concentrations of reagents increased by 10% (min. vol. 15 mL when transferring the condition from a container onto the additive screen with the liquid handler).\nEnsure that the liquid handler is ready to operate. Open the program 'Add screen to additives' for a single plate (enter volume in reservoirs: '72 µL'). Prompts, figures and a tip-management system (12 x 1,000 µL tips required) help with making sure the robot is ready to operate according to the selections.\nRetrieve the additive screen from the -20 °C incubator and remove its aluminum seal immediately (use the plate holder), then place the plate on the deck of the liquid handler. The program operates according to a portrait layout (the plate is placed with the A1-corner located in the front-left of the carrier). Also place also the container filled with the condition. Run the program.\nOnce the reservoirs of the plate have been filled, place it onto the microplate shaker and run the program. Rinse the container of condition with deionized water and 20 % ethanol for reuse.\nSet up the droplets on the nanoliter dispenser. First, unseal the crystallization plate (use the plate holder). Then, place the plate and the 8-well protein strip in the first position of the strip-holder block. The 'Setup' tab on the controlling software displays the actual positions of each component on the deck. Load each well of the strip with protein sample according to the drop size required (Table 4). Run the program to prepare droplets.\nUpon completion of the program, remove the plate from the deck and seal it immediately (use the plate sealer, 3-inch wide adhesive tape). Discard the strip in the appropriate bin.\nAssess the size, shape, and centering of the droplets under the microscope before storage.",
    "Additive screening protocol 2 (setting up crystallization droplets in a 96-well crystallization plate with a re-usable additive screen)\nFirst, prepare the additive screen: leave the corresponding frozen 96-well cell culture plate to thaw at room temperature for 40 min. Then, centrifuge the additive screen at 1,000 x g for 2 min.\nPrepare the condition (min. vol. 15 mL when transferring the condition from a container onto the additive screen with the liquid handler).\nFill the reservoirs of a 96-well crystallization plate with the condition. On the liquid-handler, proceed the same way as protocol 1, step 2.2.2, but enter '80 µL' for the volume in reservoirs.\nSet up the droplets on the nanoliter dispenser with 3 components on the deck (the plate containing the additive screen, along with the crystallization plate and the 8-well protein strip in the first position of the strip-holder block, Table 4).\nSeal the cell culture plate containing the screen with an aluminum sheet and place it back in the -20 °C incubator.\nAssess the size, shape, and centering of the droplets under the microscope before storage."
