    "Animals were housed in the University of Vermont Animal Care Facility according to institutional guidelines. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n1. Intravesical Tube Implantation\nPreparation of tubing and instruments for the surgical procedure\nCut a 7-cm piece of PE10 tubing to make the catheter for implantation.\nCreate a flare at one end of the PE10 tube by slowly advancing the end towards an open flame.\n\t\tNOTE: Quickly withdraw the tube as soon as the flare develops.\nApply three drops of all-purpose hot glue, using the low heat setting on a glue gun, at 4.5, 5, and 5.5 cm from the flared end on the outside of the PE10 tube. These will help secure the tube at the animal's back. (Figure 1)\nSterilize the tubing by soaking it in 70% ethanol and then flush it with sterile 0.9% NaCl prior to use. Leave the tube filled to avoid introducing air bubbles into the system.\nCreate a 30-gauge plug to seal the end of the PE10 catheter by separating a 30-gauge needle from the hub by manually manipulating the proximal end side-to-side. Apply a drop of hot glue to the end. Ensure that the seal is watertight. (Figure 2)\nUse the following microsurgical instruments: Two pairs of Dumont #7 curved microforceps, two pairs of Dumont #5 curved microforceps, a 21 G needle, ultrafine straight hemostat, micro scissors, small dissecting scissors, and a micro needle holder.\nSterilize all instruments before starting the procedure.\nPreparation of the animal",
    "After anesthetizing the animal, shave the lower half of the abdomen first, then turn the animal prone and shave and clean the area on the upper back with 70% alcohol followed by betadine. Apply vet ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness. Next, use a pair of straight, blunt scissors and pair of Dumont #7 curved microforceps to make a 1.5 cm long skin incision between the scapulae and place the animal supine on top of a heating pad (37 Â°C) covered with sterile drapes.\nFinally, clean the abdomen with alcohol and betadine.\nSurgical procedure\n\tNOTE: Perform all surgical procedures under an operating microscope with magnification ranging from 3.15X to 20X. After placing the animal onto the sterile drapes, put on sterile gloves. Continue using sterile procedures throughout the entire surgery.\n\t\nPlace the animal in an induction box and anesthetize using 2% inhaled isoflurane with an oxygen carrier (1 L/min). Maintain anesthesia throughout the procedure by placing the animal's head in a nose cone and using 2% inhaled isoflurane with an oxygen carrier (1 L/min). Begin the surgery after receiving a negative response from the toe-pinch test.\nUse a pair of straight, blunt scissors and pair of Dumont #7 curved microforceps to make a 1.5 cm lower, midline abdominal incision through the skin. Subsequently, create a matching incision through the fascia along the linea alba and muscle to expose the dome and upper half of the urinary bladder. Avoid injuring the bladder by applying upward traction to each tissue layer using a pair of Dumont #7 curved microforceps. Keep the abdominal viscera from desiccation by adding drops of warm physiological saline.",
    "Rotate the animal onto its side to access the incision on the nape of the neck. Push a narrow hemostat subcutaneously though the incision. The subcutaneous channel should start on the back, and continue along the side.\nOnce the tip of the instrument reaches the bottom of the rib cage, turn the tip towards the midline and inside of the abdomen (there will be a slight pop when piercing the abdominal wall muscles). Continue advancing the hemostat until the tip is exposed at the abdominal incision under the muscular layer. (Figure 3)\nGrasp the \"non-flared\" end of the tubing with the hemostat and slowly retract the tool, pulling the end of the tube out via the incision at the back of the neck. Adjust the flared end of the tubing so that it lies directly above the dome of the bladder.\nMake a loose tie of 6-0 monofilament suture (non-absorbable) and place it on top of the bladder dome. This tie will be used later to secure the tube in the bladder.\nPlace a small roll of lint-free tissue in the abdomen and behind the bladder to help stabilize and elevate it.\nPrepare to insert the flared end of the PE10 catheter into the bladder.\n\t\t\nIn the non-dominant hand, hold the dome of the bladder with Dumont #7 curved microforceps and maintain this grip until the catheter is placed in the bladder.\nUse a 21-gauge needle to make a cystotomy in the apex of the dome. Gently probe the cystotomy with a closed pair of #5 curved microforceps to make sure the catheter can easily pass through the hole.",
    "While still holding the bladder dome in the non-dominant hand, place the flared end of the PE10 catheter into the bladder (push the flare down to the bladder neck so that it does not slip out while securing it).\nTie the 6-0 monofilament suture around the dome of the bladder and tubing with the tie placed anterior to the tubing. Be sure to tie the suture as high up on the bladder as possible to avoid artificially reducing bladder capacity. (Figure 4)\nAlternatively, secure the catheter using a purse string suture as follows. Make a loose purse string suture on the dome of the bladder using 6-0 monofilament. Follow steps 1.3.8.1 - 1.3.8.3 to perform the cystotomy and insert the catheter. Secure the tube by tying the purse string suture. (Figure 5)\nTest the patency and seal of the tube in the bladder by attaching a 0.5 mL insulin syringe with a 30-gauge needle to the distal end of the tube. Slowly fill the bladder with 0.1 - 0.2 mL of 0.9% NaCl until a drop appears at the urethral orifice, then empty the bladder by aspiration. It is important that the bladder can be both filled and emptied.\nIf no leaks occur at the dome, brace the bladder with a pair of curved microforceps and gently pull on the tubing until the flare is resting against the inside of the bladder dome.\nBefore closing, remove the small roll of tissue, and make sure that the bladder is in its normal position.\nClose the abdominal wall in two layers (muscle and skin) with 6-0 running suture. It is preferable to approximate the rectus abdominis muscle by suturing only the edges of the anterior abdominal fascia (anterior wall of the rectus sheath).",
    "To secure the tubing at the animals back, gently rotate the animal onto its abdomen. Insert the subcutaneous portion of the metal anchor into the interscapular incision. (Figure 12) Use a 6-0 suture to secure the tube and anchor by encircling them with a vertical mattress suture.\nMake sure a glue bubble remains above and below the skin to prevent the tube from pulling out. Cut the tube approximately 2 cm above the skin.\nGently insert the 30-gauge plug (step 1.1.5) into the end of the tube to prevent urine from leaking out.\nInject 0.5 mL 0.9% NaCl subcutaneously for hydration. Give post-operative analgesia immediately following surgery and maintain for 48 h.\nPlace the animal back into its cage located under an infrared lamp. Maintain constant observation until the animal moves around the cage freely.\nMonitor the animal daily and allow it to recover for 5 days before recording.\n2. Awake Cystometry Recording\nPreparation of the recording program, pressure transducer, and infusion pump.\nBefore anesthetizing the animal, connect the infusion pump, pressure transducer, and 22 G swivel using PE50 tubing. (Figure 6)\nOpen the recording program (see table of materials for an example), on a computer to calibrate the system pressure and prepare for recording. Make sure to use the same settings during calibration and recording.\n\t\t\nFill a 20 mL syringe with 10 - 15 mL of room temperature 0.9% NaCl and load into the infusion pump. Program the pump to infuse at a rate of 0.6 mL/h.\nSecure the pressure transducer at the same height as the animal's bladder or the bottom of the recording cage.\nAttach the 22-gauge swivel to the end of the pressure transducer (PE50 - tubing - pressure transducer to swivel)",
    "NOTE: The swivel is used to prevent the tube from twisting or kinking as the animal moves.\nAdvance the syringe pump to flush 0.9% NaCl through the system. Make sure to remove all air bubbles before calibrating.\nWith the recording program running, use a ruler to calibrate the pressure (cm/H2O). Slowly move the end of the PE50 tether from 0 to 30 cm. Adjust the zero if needed.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The 0-cm mark should be at the same height as the floor of the recording cage and pressure transducer.\nSuspend the 22-gauge swivel above the center of the recording cage. Ensure that the cage bottom allows urine to fall onto the collecting device of the balance positioned below the cage. Adjust the height of the tether so the mouse can freely move around the cage without straining or stretching the tubing. (Figure 7)\nWhen finished, check to make sure the system and external PE50 tubing are full of 0.9% NaCl and all air bubbles have been removed.\nPreparation of the animal for recording\nAnesthetize the animal with 2% inhaled isoflurane and place it on its abdomen. Remove the 30-gauge plug and slide the PE10 tubing (bladder catheter) into the end of the PE50 tether. Use hot glue to form a watertight seal.\nTurn off the anesthesia and place the animal in the recording cagewith a parallel-wire floor, which will allow urine to fall directly onto a collecting device placed on top of an analytical balance. (Figure 7)\nStart the recording once the animal is in the cage, but do not start infusing. Monitor the animal until it fully recovers from the anesthesia. Once the bladder pressure stabilizes, begin infusing 0.9% NaCl at a rate of 0.6 mL/h.",
    "NOTE: Make a note in the recording program when any changes are made. It is important to have a record of when infusion starts, stops, or irregularities occur.\nCheck the system for leaks and make sure the animal has easy access to food and water.\nContinue recording in a quiet room until three reproducible micturition cycles are obtained.\n\t\tNOTE: The animal should be completely undisturbed throughout the recording. Preferably, use remote video monitoring to observe behavior.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
