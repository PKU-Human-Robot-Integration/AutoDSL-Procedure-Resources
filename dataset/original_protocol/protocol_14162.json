    "All procedures described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Southern California Health Sciences Campus.\n1. Experimental Setup and Assembly\nAcquire all of the following supplies and chemicals before the start of the study: mice, cages/metal cage tops, bedding, food, water, ethanol, pipets, sipper tops, shrink wrap, utility knife, zip ties, tape, Bunsen burner, scale, headlamp.\nObtain C57BL/6J mice, either from a commercial source or an in-house colony, keeping in mind that mice can be group housed until time of testing.\n\t​NOTE: The total number of mice procured depends on the complexity of the experimental design. Plan to accommodate roughly 12 - 15 mice per group, with pilot studies no smaller than 5 - 7 mice per group. In the representative results shown below we utilized a simple two-group set-up to assess the cause-effect relationship using a single dose (5 mg/kg) of the drug (MOX).\nFollow the steps below to assemble the bottles18.\n\t\nHeat a utility knife using a Bunsen burner.\nUsing this knife, cut roughly an inch off the top and bottom ends of a plastic 18 mL serological pipet.\n\t\t\nNote that smaller volume pipets (i.e., 10 mL) can also be used to increase the precision of the measurement.\nWarm the pipet under a heat gun.\nInsert the ball bearing sipper tube into the \"bottom\" end of the pipet (in other words, the opening nearest to the 18 mL dash-line).\nSeal the sipper tube in place with shrink wrap using a commercially available shrink wrap gun.\nCap off the other opening with a silicone stopper.\n2. Animal Habituation",
    "Beginning at least 1 week prior to the start date of the experiment, transfer the mice to the room where the experimental procedures are to be carried out so that they may acclimate to the husbandry conditions (including the ambient temperature (21 ± 1 °C) and 12-h reverse light/dark cycle, with lights off at 12 noon). Be sure to follow institutional guidelines and notify the appropriate channels before moving animals from one location to another.\n\t\nIf mice are being transferred from a standard light/dark cycle allow 2 weeks of additional habituation time.\nFill the newly made bottles to the brim with water. Make sure that the cap is closed securely and devoid of any air bubbles or leaks from the spout. If solution is leaking, re-secure the cap. Remove any air bubbles by simply tapping on the bottle so that the air can escape the tube.\nUpon arrival, single house each mouse in standard polycarbonate/polysulfone cages with bedding and a metal grid cage top; remove the cage lid as it will no longer be used.\n\t\nProvide access to food and water bottle(s) ad libitum.\nSecure each bottle to the cage top by wrapping a plastic zip tie around each bottle to hold it in place. Trim any excess plastic from the zip tie to ensure that it does not protrude into the cage.\n\t\t​NOTE: For the drinking in the dark (DID) procedure, only a single bottle of water is required. Habituation to the two bottle choice (TBC) paradigm, however, requires that the cage set-up include two bottles of water. If the metal grid hopper provided is designed to hold only a single bottle of solution, gently bend apart its bars to create space for an additional plate to accommodate the second bottle for TBC.",
    "Set up at least 3 mouse free control cages. This will allow for the monitoring of any fluid loss caused by evaporation or spillage from the bottles, which is simply a natural occurrence that happens as cages are placed on and off the cage rack (see step 2.6.3, 3.6.1, and 4.6.1 for equations).\nBeginning on day 4 of the 1-week single housing acclimation, measure and record the daily body and food weights of each mouse, using a scale, (in grams) as well as the water intake, using the etchings alongside the inverted bottle to record the highest point of the meniscus (in mL).\n\t\nWhile it is standard scientific practice to read the lowest point of the concave meniscus, because the bottles remain in an inverted position during the measurement, record the highest point of the meniscus.\nAssess the parameters of 2.5 using the equations below:\n\t\nMeasure the Body Weight Change (g): weight of current day (g) - weight of previous day (g).\nMeasure the Food Intake (g): weight of food on previous day (g) - weight of food on current day (g).\nMeasure the Water Intake (mL): [volume of water on current day (mL) - volume of water on previous day (mL)] - average water loss from all control cages (mL).\nRepeat step 2.5 consecutively, on days 5 - 7, to allow for the determination of a baseline for the three days immediately prior to the introduction of ethanol. If a consecutive recording cannot be collected, extend the acclimation period to allow for the evaluation of baseline measurements.\nOnce water intake has stabilized to ± 10% variability from the mean of the last 3 days, begin ethanol access with either TBC (unlimited access) or DID (limited access).",
    "NOTE: On rare occasion, one to two additional days may be needed for subjects to attain this stability; don't be alarmed if additional time is needed for the values to display ±10% variability from the mean of the last 3 days.\n3. 24-Hour Two Bottle Choice (TBC)\nNote: A schematic is prepared in Figure 1.\nPrepare a 10% (v/v) ethanol solution at a 500 mL volume by adding 52.65 mL of 190 proof grain ethanol (~95% ethanol) to 447.35 mL of H2O; be sure to shake thoroughly. Given that ethanol evaporates quickly, replace the solution in every 3-4 day's interval.\n\tNOTE: Other concentrations of ethanol can be used as well, but the authors recommend a 10% concentration for this model.\nOn the first day of TBC, (day 8 at the earliest) empty 1 of the 2 water bottles, in each cage, and fill it to the brim with the freshly prepared ethanol solution. Given that ethanol and water are difficult to be distinguished visually, clearly label the bottles with their corresponding contents. Simply apply a piece of masking tape to the bottle and labeling it with a marker or by writing directly on the bottle.\nAdd more solution to the water bottle, as needed.\nPlace bottles back on the cage, making sure that all caps are closed securely and devoid of any air bubbles or leaks from the spout. If the solution is leaking, re-secure the cap. Remove any air bubbles by simply tapping on the bottle so that the air can escape the bottle.\nAlternate the position of the bottles every other day as to correct for conditioned place preference related influences in drinking activity (see Discussion for more).",
    "In addition to the daily measurements from 2.5 and 2.6, which have been ongoing, begin to read and record ethanol intake levels as well. Analyze the 10% ethanol intake and preference ratio using the following equations:\n\t\nMeasure the 10% Ethanol Intake (mL): [volume of ethanol on current day (mL) - volume of ethanol on previous day (mL))] - average ethanol loss from all control cages (mL).\nMeasure the 10% Ethanol Intake (g/kg): [10% ethanol Intake (mL) x 0.07893 g/mL] / body weight (kg).\nMeasure the Preference %: [10% Ethanol Intake (mL) / Water (mL)] x 100.\nAs soon as ethanol intake has become stable, administer a single control (saline) intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (0.01 mL/g of body weight) to each mouse during the daily measurement routine. In this way, subjects become accustomed to the injection itself.\n\t\nStability is defined as ± 10% variability from the mean of the last 3 days (same as in section 2.8).\n\t\t​NOTE: It can take up to 1 week for ethanol levels to stabilize. This is especially true if mice are being re-used from a previous experiment and have had previous exposure to ethanol. The control is simply the solvent used to dissolve the drug.\nOnce an ethanol baseline with low variability is re-established, split the mice into dosing groups using the ethanol intake values so that all groups have roughly similar average ethanol intake values.\n\t\nDesignate one group as the control (continuing to receive saline) and the other as the experimental (i.p. injection of the investigated drug at 0.01 mL/g of body weight). Begin daily drug dosing, either for an acute or multi-day duration. Subsequently, the control can be re-introduced to test the post-drug effects (optional).",
    "NOTE: Because drinking is monitored across a 24-h long period, the time of dosage administration is not dependent on the dark cycle.\n4. Drinking in the Dark (DID)\nNOTE: A schematic is prepared in Figure 3.\nOn each day of scheduled ethanol access (Days 1 - 4) record the measurements, for water volume, food intake, and body weight, and perform drug dosing. Do this during a preselected time during the light cycle that is chosen in accordance with the pharmacokinetics of the drug so that the compound is at/or approaching the maximum brain concentration during the drinking period.\n\t​NOTE: Remember days 1 - 3 are meant to simply acclimate the mice to drinking copious levels of ethanol in a short period of time. While mice do not reach BEC levels comparable to the human 0.08; these \"training\" days ensure that on day 4, during the slightly longer drinking session, they will in fact drink to that level.\n\t\nGive all mice the control (saline) on days 1 - 3, and either the control or drug on day 4. This DID procedure occurs over the span of 3 weeks to include a pre-drug (week 1), drug (week 2), and post-drug (week 4) drinking session.\nNOTE: Note that during the drug-dosing week, day 3 ethanol intake levels are used to assign mice to either the control or drug group in a way where the ethanol intake levels of both groups have the least variability. This is unlike TBC, which assigns groups based on a 3 day average.\nPrepare a 20% (v/v) ethanol solution (20E) at a 500 mL volume by adding 105.25 mL of 190 proof grain ethanol (~95% ethanol) to 394.75 mL of H2O; be sure to shake thoroughly.",
    "Fill the ethanol bottles before the start of the drinking session so that as soon as the DID begins the water bottles can simply be replaced with the alcohol bottles.\nDuring the entire DID session (steps 4.5 - 4.8), use a red-light headlamp as to not disturb the animals.\nAt the start of the DID drinking session, scheduled to begin 3 hours into the dark cycle, record the volume of water for each mouse. Then, replace each water bottle with a bottle of the 20E solution and record the starting ethanol volume.\nRead and record the final ethanol volume 2 hours later, at the end of the drinking session on Days 1 - 3 and 4 hours later on Day 4. Analyze the 20% ethanol intake using the following equations.\n\t\nMeasure the 20% Ethanol Intake (mL): [volume of ethanol at end of drinking session (mL) - volume of ethanol at start of drinking session (mL)] - average ethanol loss from all control cages (mL).\nMeasure the 20% Ethanol Intake (g/kg): [20% Ethanol Intake (mL) x 0.15786 g/mL] / body weight (kg).\nOn Day 4 only, immediately after recording ethanol volumes, and before re-introducing access to water, collect blood to assess the blood ethanol concentration of each mouse (optional).\n\t​NOTE: Any non-terminal blood collection method may be used, such as retro-orbital sinus blood collection, or saphenous vein blood collection. For useful protocols see references for Parasuraman et al.21 and Yardley et al.20.\n\t\nPerform analysis using various methods including LCMS, or commercially available machinery (see Table of Materials).\nReplace all ethanol bottles with water bottles and record water volume.\nSubscription Required.
