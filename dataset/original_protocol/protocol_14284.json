  "procedures": [
    "1. Design of the constructs\nUse the UCSC genome browser24 to identify repetitive elements necessary for circular RNA formation and incorporate them in the constructs. Importantly, primers for amplification need to be outside the repetitive elements.\nPaste the circular RNA sequence (Supplemental Figure 1 is a test sequence) into https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start[href=https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start] and select the right organism. Submit the sequence and go to browser view, zoom out 1.5x or as appropriate (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: The search sequence appears in the top line (Figure 2A, 1). Depending on the order of the exons in the circular RNA, BLAT will not connect all the exons. In this example, exon 12 (Figure 2A, 4) is not connected to 11 (Figure 2A, 2, 3), because exon 12 is upstream of exon 11 in the circular RNA sequence (Supplemental Figure 1). The repetitive elements are in the 'repeat masker' track, indicated by boxes, where black to gray color indicates the evolutionary conservation (Figure 2A, 5).\nMouse over the repetitive elements to identify their subtype in a floating window. Alu elements are in the SINE (short interspersed nuclear element) line. Use the 'default tracks' button under the window to reset the browser if a different picture than Figure 2 is obtained.\n\tNOTE: Mousing over the exons in the gene display generates a window with exon numbers that are computer generated. These numbers do not correspond to the exon numbering established in the literature and also change between isoforms.\n2. Select the sequence to be cloned in an expression vector\nDownload the DNA sequence shown in the window by going to View → DNA on the top line of the UCSC genome browser. In the Sequencing Formatting Option, select Extended Case/Color Options.",
    "Select the default case as Lower and select toggle case for NCBI refseq. Select underline, and bold, and italic for Repeat Masker. Click Submit. There will be exons as capital letters and introns as small letters. Check the exon/intron borders.\nIn this example there is a 'ccctttacCTTTTT' sequence, indicating that the browser shows the reverse complement. If this is the case, go back and select the reverse complement box until seeing the correct exon intron borders (agEXONgt), in this example AAAAAGgtaaaggg.\nCopy the file with the correct orientation (internal exons are surrounded by intronic ag…gt) into a word processing document and highlight the exons (Supplemental Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: In this example, the genomic fragment encompassing exons 9-12 is around 24 kb and thus too large to be amplified from genomic DNA. Therefore, each exon surrounded by about 1 kb intronic region is individually amplified and these four fragments are assembled in a cloning vector.\nSelect fragments to be amplified (exon ± 500 nt intron). Make sure that the intron does not begin or end in a repetitive region, as primers in these regions will not amplify specific sequences. The selected regions are shown in Figure 2B, and their sequences are shown in Supplemental Figure 3.",
    "NOTE: In general, the larger the constructs, the more difficult the cloning will be. The fragments can be assembled either step wise (i.e., exon 9 is combined with the vector and in the next step exon 10 is introduced into this construct via cloning until all exons are in place), or alternatively, all fragments are assembled simultaneously. A stepwise approach always works but requires more time. A simultaneous assembly does not always work and depends on how well the individual fragments can be amplified from genomic DNA and on the overall size of the construct. We therefore usually start with both approaches simultaneously.\n3. Design primers for cloning\nUse a web tool (https://nebuilder.neb.com/#!/[href=https://nebuilder.neb.com/#!/]) to design the primers for cloning. For example, enter fragments 9, 10, 11 and 12 and the vector sequence (Supplemental Figure 3) to this tool.\nFor the vector sequence, add the insertion site as the last nucleotide and subsequently add the fragments. Since the vector numbering does not start with a given insertion site, the site of insertion in the vector is located and the downstream part is put in in front of the upstream sequence. In this example the inserts start directly after the HindIII [AAGCTT] site and ends directly after the PmeI [GTTTAAAC] site of pcDNA3.1. The sequence from cccgctgatcag … ccgtaaaaaggccgc is pasted in front of position 1 in the pcDNA3.1 sequence (gttgctggcgtttttcc …).\nAdjust primers if their melting points are more than 4 °C apart, as they will not work in amplification. The assembly of the fragments and primer sequences designed are shown in Supplemental Figure 4. Primers for cloning can also be designed manually25.\n4. PCR and amplicon detection",
    "Standard PCR Reaction: Make a reaction mix for total volume of 50 µL per reaction. Below is the recipe for one reaction using polymerase 1:\n\t10 µL of 5x Reaction Buffer\n\t1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs\n\t2.5 µL of 10 µM Forward Primer\n\t2.5 µL of 10 µM Reverse Primer\n\t0.5 µL of Polymerase 1\n\t32.5 µL of Nuclease free H2O\n\t\nOptionally, add 10 µL of 5x GC Enhancer if the product has high GC content; make a separate mix containing GC Enhancer to test PCR reaction.\nAliquot 49 µL of the mix into PCR tubes per reaction sample.\nAdd 1 µL of DNA to the PCR, the amount ranges from 10 pg to 1 ng.\nSpin down the samples to remove residue off the sides and place them in a PCR machine. Use the same machine as well as same spots in the machine when optimizing the PCR conditions.\n5. Optimization for longer DNA fragments for use of different polymerases\nTemperature\n\t\nOptimize the long-range Polymerase 2.\n\t\t\nUse a lower denaturation temperature (Polymerase 1: 98 °C, Polymerase 2: 94 °C).\nUse a longer denaturation time (Polymerase 1: 10 s, Polymerase 2: 30 s).\nUse a longer annealing time (Polymerase 1: 30 s, Polymerase 2: 60 s).\nUse a longer extension time (Polymerase 1: 30 s/kb, Polymerase 2: 50 s/kb).\nUse a lower extension temperature (Polymerase 1: 72 °C, Polymerase 2: 65 °C).\nUse an annealing temperature 5 °C below the Tm of the primers.\nOptimize the primer concentrations (5x less to 5x more than the original primer concentration). Optimize DNA concentrations from 10 pg to 50 pg, 100 pg, 1 ng, 5 ng, 10 ng.",
    "As an example of a PCR program to amplify a 15 kb product size using Polymerase 2, perform an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, DNA denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s followed by annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and DNA extension at 65 °C for 12 min 30 s. Perform a final extension at 65 °C for 10 min with a final 4 °C hold.\n\t\tNOTE: The annealing temperature (Ta) specific for the primers determined by web-based temperature calculations that are specific for each polymerase. Extension times may vary and need to be optimized if fragments are larger than 10 kb.\nExtension times and DNA concentrations\n\t\nUse longer extension times for DNA fragments over 6 kb: 1 min per 1 kb. Longer fragments should use less DNA.\nPerform dilutions of DNA to find the optimum DNA concentration for amplification, usually 1 pg to 1 ng for plasmids or 1 ng to 1 µg for genomic DNA.\n\t\tNOTE: For most cloning use polymerase 1, engineered by fusing the Sso7d DNA binding domain to a proprietary thermostable DNA polymerase26. The polymerase has a low error rate and due to the Sso7d domain a high processivity, needed to amplify large (10-15 kb) genomic fragments. Due to this large fragment size, enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules27 is used for insertion into vectors, as this method does not require restriction enzymes. The amplification of fragments longer than 15 kb gets increasingly difficult with polymerase 1. For large fragment amplification use polymerase 2 made from pyrococcus-like proofreading polymerase fused to Sso7d or the long range PCR kit that gives, however, higher error rates.\n6. Purification of PCR products for cloning",
    "Run half of the PCR products on 1% agarose gels containing an intercalating nucleic acid stain (e.g., 1x GelGreen). Visualize the stained gels on a dark reader transilluminator. This stained DNA does not run true to size.\n\tNOTE: GelGreen intercalates into DNA, similar to ethidium bromide, but it is excited by light around 500 nm (cyan), a wavelength that does not damage DNA, which highly improves cloning.\nIn parallel, run half of the PCR products on a 1% gel that is stained post-run with ethidium bromide (Figure 3A,B).\nExcise bands of the right size from the stained gel (step 6.1) and isolate DNA using a gel and PCR cleanup kit. In deviation from its standard protocol, elute the DNA in only 20 µL of double distilled water, as usually the DNA concentrations are low.\nPrior to cloning, check the isolated DNA on an agarose gel for concentration and integrity (Figure 3B). Aim for a 2:1 molar insert to vector ratio. When using several inserts, the ratio is 2:2:2:1.\n7. DNA assembly and clone detection\nNOTE: Cloning is done using an enzymatic DNA assembly kit, with minor modifications. The assembly is performed for 60 min at 50 °C and generally the lower range of DNA is used for assembly (20-100 fmol/20 µL reaction). The whole reaction mix is added to chemical competent cells and the whole cells plated out on a 6 cm agar plate.\nCombine the vector and insert in a 1:2 molar ratio (20-500 fmol each) in 10 µL of water.\nAdd 10 µL of DNA Assembly Master Mix.\nIncubate samples for 60 minutes at 50 °C.",
    "Next, transform competent cells with the total assembly reaction. Here, use E. coli strain 1 cells for shorter constructs or E. coli strain 2 cells for longer or unstable constructs. Cells should be in a 50 µL volume.\nThaw cells on ice and add 2 µL of the chilled assembled product to the competent cells. Mix by gently flicking the tube 4-5 times. Do not vortex.\nLet the mixture sit on ice for 30 min.\nHeat shock at 42 °C for 30 s. Do not mix.\nTransfer the tube back to ice for 2 min.\nAdd 950 µL of room-temperature SOC Media to the tube.\nIncubate the reaction tube at 37 °C for 60 min. Shake vigorously (300 rpm).\nWarm selection plates with the appropriate antibiotic during incubation at 37 °C.\nPellet the cells through centrifugation (10,000 x g, 30 s) and plate out ¼ and ¾ of cells on two selection plates and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\n8. Validation of clones\nUse colony PCR, employing PCR primers spanning the assembly sites (Figure 1C) for detection.\nTake a sterile toothpick and touch a single bacterial colony.\nTouch the bottom of a PCR tube with the toothpick that has the colony and then streak the toothpick on an antibiotic agar plate, incubate the streaked plate at 37 °C or room temperature for sensitive constructs overnight.\nOverlay the PCR tube touched with the colony with a PCR mix containing the detection primers. These are designed using primer 3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/[href=http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/]). The program has the option to force primer design across a defined sequence using the \"[ccc]\" signs to select primers across the assembly junction. DNA from positive strains is isolated and verified by sequencing.\n9. Analysis of circular RNA expressing reporter genes",
    "For analysis, transfect reporter genes into eukaryotic cells. Here, use HEK293 cells (ATTC #CRL-1573) as they give high transfection efficiency. To save costs, use PEI (polyethyleneimine) solutions.\nFor the PEI solution, dissolve linear polyethyleneimine hydrochloride (PEI) at 1 mg/mL in water at low pH, pH 2. Bring up the pH to 7 with NaOH. Sterile filter with 0.22 µm filters and store at 4 °C.\nSplit cells into six wells (approximately 150,000 cells per well) and let them grow overnight in 10% FBS in DMEM media.\nAliquot 1 µg of the reporter gene in a sterile tube and add 200 µL of sterile filtered 150 mM NaCl. Mix with the DNA by vortexing.\nAdd PEI solution to this mix and vortex, briefly centrifuge to collect samples at bottom of tube. Use a ratio of 1 µg of DNA per 3 µL of PEI.\nIncubate at room temperature for 10 min and then add directly to HEK 293 cells.\nIncubate HEK293 cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, overnight.\nIsolate RNA for RT-PCR via an RNA isolation kit.\n10. RNase R treatment to remove linear RNAs\nUse 10 µg of total RNA in an RNase-free tube.\nAdd 10 µL of 10x RNase R buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 M KCl, 1 mM MgCl2) to RNA.\nAdd RNase R to RNA (1 µl = 20U).\nAdd 1 µL of glycol blue to the RNA and bring the volume up to 100 µL with sterile water.\nIncubate samples at 37 °C for 30 min.\nAdd 100 µL of phenol/chloroform and vortex for 1 min.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 x g for 1 min to separate phases.\nTake the supernatant (aqueous phase) and add 1 volume (around 80 µL of chloroform).\nVortex for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min to separate phases.",
    "Take supernatant, add 1:10 vol KAc and 2.5 vol ethanol, and precipitate at -20 °C for 1-4 h. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at full speed (21,000 x g). There will be a small blue pellet at the bottom.\nRemove the supernatant, and wash with 80% ethanol. Let air dry for 5 min at room temperature, and dissolve in 10 µL water.\n11. RT-PCR analysis\nUse 1 µg of RNA per RT reaction.\nMake reaction mix for a final total volume of 20 µL per reaction. For one reaction, use 1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 µL of 0.1 M Dithiothreitol (DTT), 4 µL of 5x First-Strand Buffer, and 0.5 µL of Reverse Transcriptase.\nAliquot 6.5 µL of reaction mix into new PCR tubes.\nMix up to 5 primers in one mix. However, some primers may mis-pair with other primers in the PCR (Figure 5). Primer sequences are in Table 2. We routinely use gene-specific exon-junction primers but priming with random hexamers is also possible.\nAdd 1 µL of 10 µM Reverse primer to desired RT reaction tube.\nAdd 1 µg of RNA to PCR reaction tube.\nAdd RNase-free H2O up to a total volume of 20 µL.\nSpin tubes down to remove residue on side of tubes and place in thermocycler.\nRun the RT reaction in thermocycler at 50 °C for 50 minutes.\nStore RT cDNA at -20 °C or proceed to the PCR reaction.\nSubscription Required.
