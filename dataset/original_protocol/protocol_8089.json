    "Animals used in this study were treated in an ethical and humane manner as set forth by Indiana University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.\nNOTE: All tools and surfaces should be washed with an appropriate solvent to remove nucleases18 before starting any work.\n1. Storing brains\nQuickly remove the brains from euthanized adult CD1 wildtype mice weighing approximately 30 g using a conventional approach13 and flash-freeze for 60 seconds in either liquid nitrogen or isopentane pre-chilled with dry ice.\nStore frozen brains at -80 °C in aluminum foil or conical tubes until use.\n2. Preparing the brain matrix\nTwenty-four hours before dissecting tissue, place a clean brain matrix (see Table of Materials) on a stack of thawed freezer packs. Sandwich the sides of the matrix between two freezer packs making sure to leave approximately 0.5 cm between the bottom of the razor slots and the top of the gel packs (Figure 1A). Place aluminum foil on the ends to aid in cooling.\n\tNOTE: When purchasing a brain matrix, buy one that is large enough to encase the entire volume of the brain to be dissected.\nPlace the box containing the brain matrix and freezer packs in a -20 °C freezer with the top ajar overnight.\n3. Setting up a frozen glass plate\nNOTE: The purpose of this setup is to prepare a frozen surface on which to dissect brain sections.\nPlace ice in an insulated box up to approximately 5 cm from the top. Then place a 2.5 cm layer of dry ice on top of the ice and cover with black plastic sheeting to aid in visualizing the sample (Figure 1B, Figure 1C).",
    "Place a glass plate (should just fit in the opening of the box) on top of the plastic and place dry ice on top of the plate in the far corners (Figure 1C).\nTake the frozen brain matrix from the freezer and insert the brain to be cut cortex-side up. Allow it to equilibrate to the temperature in the box for 10 min. Keep the lid on the box during this time.\nAdjust the brain’s position in the matrix with cold forceps so that the sagittal sinus and transverse sinus line up with the perpendicular grooves of the block (Figure 1D). This will help ensure symmetric sections for easier dissection. Touch tips of forceps to dry ice briefly to chill before adjusting the brain.\nOnce the brain is in position, place a chilled razor blade near its center and press the blade approximately 1 mm into the tissue. Add chilled blades to the rostral and caudal ends to help hold the brain in place (Figure 2A and Figure 2B).\nStarting on the rostral end, add blades one at a time, placing them into the slots and pressing them gently down into the tissue approximately 1 mm (Figure 2B). Continue to add blades at 1 mm intervals working towards the caudal end.\nMake sure the brain does not shift during this time. Line up blades horizontally and vertically (Figure 2B). In order to cut sections into 0.5 mm widths, low profile microtome blades (see Table of Materials) may be used. Place these between the larger razor blades (Figure 2C).\nOnce blades are in place, press down on top of the group with fingers, palm or some other flat surface (Figure 2C, Figure 2D). Rock the group of blades slowly from side to side to move them through the tissue.",
    "NOTE: This may take some time (1–2 min) and requires patience. There should be resistance to the blades moving through the tissue. Easy entry means the brain is thawing and the block should be cooled with dry ice.\nWhen all blades have reached the bottom of the slots, grasp each side of the group of blades and work free of the matrix by rocking back and forth.\n\tNOTE: Exercise caution to avoid cutting oneself on the sharp edges of the blades.\nOnce the group is free, place the stack, rostral side up, on the glass plate (Figure 2E). Place dry ice next to and/or on top of the stack to further freeze the samples for easier separation.\nPlace the stack with sharp edges down on the glass plate and separate blades by shifting the stack between thumbs and fingers. The blades should separate from each other with sections attached.\nLine up sections on the glass plate from rostral to caudal (Figure 2F).\nSeparate tissue from the blades by flexing blades between fingers, or by separating with a second cold razor (Figures 2G,2H,2I).\n4. Dissecting sections\nOpen the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas or another reference and find landmarks necessary to identify regions of interest. Some obvious landmarks include the anterior commissure, the corpus callosum, the lateral ventricles, and the hippocampus (Figure 3).\nFlip the section to be cut with chilled forceps and make sure the region about to be collected is consistent throughout the section. During harvesting, consult the reference atlas often to make sure the correct ROI is obtained.\n\tNOTE: A magnifying glass or dissecting microscope is often helpful in this process. Good lighting is also essential. Low wattage LED lamps or a cool lamp (see Table of Materials) can be used for this purpose.",
    "With a clean scalpel or punch, cut into the section (Figure 4). Prechill each tool before cutting by touching it briefly to dry ice. Push the blade gently but firmly into the tissue, rocking it back and forth to make the cut. Do not push too hard or the tissue will fracture.\n\tNOTE: Tools will warm over time. Slightly warmed blades can be helpful in making clean cuts and can limit fracturing, but be careful to avoid thawing of tissue. Periodically chill tools on dry ice.\nOnce an ROI is harvested, place it into labeled, prechilled 1.5 mL tubes. Store harvested tissues at -80 °C until needed.\nProcess frozen tissue collected in this manner by adding cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% CHAPS and protein inhibitor cocktail (see Table of Materials)) for protein extraction, or a guanidinium-containing solvent (see Table of Materials) for RNA extraction to the frozen sample and immediately homogenize using either a glass Dounce or mechanical homogenizer (see Table of Materials). In this way, protease and nuclease inhibitors are in place as the sample warms to protect protein and nucleic acids from degradation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
