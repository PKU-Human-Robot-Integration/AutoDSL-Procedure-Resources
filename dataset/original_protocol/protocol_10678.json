    "1. Preparing the DNA Template\nPurify plasmid from a standard laboratory strain of E. coli, such as E. coli DH5a or Nova Blue with a commercial kit. Alternatively, a linear PCR product can be similarly purified with a commercial kit. Elute the DNA with H2O only.\nPhenol-chloroform extract the DNA solution26.\nDetermine the DNA concentration and purity, e.g. by UV absorbance or other suitable methods. It is important to use highly pure DNA for efficient transcription-translation.\n2. Preparing the Thin Lipid Film\nWeigh the dry lipid powder and dissolve in solvent. For 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), stock solutions are prepared in chloroform at a concentration of 40 mg/ml.\n\tNote: Organic solvents must always be handled with glass pipettes and bottles. In other words, plastic must never be used. Store stock solutions in air tight, solvent resistant amber glass bottles at -20 °C, preferably under argon.\nAliquot 12 μmol POPC (220 μl of 40 mg/ml stock solution) into a 5 ml round bottom flask.\nEvaporate the solvent with a rotary evaporator (Figure 1) to generate the thin lipid film.\n\t\nSecurely attach the round bottom flask to the distillation tube with a circular clip and start the rotation of the flask.\nInitiate the circulation of water through the condenser coil. Using a heat bath is not necessary, because chloroform has a low boiling point of 61.2 °C at normal atmospheric pressure.\nEnsure that the system is open to the atmosphere by checking that the stopcock is open. Turn on the vacuum pump and slowly close the stopcock to apply the vacuum to the system.",
    "A thin lipid film is deposited on the walls of the round bottom flask during rotary evaporation forming an opaque film that is visible by eye. Let the rotary evaporation continue for 0.5-2 hr. To stop the process, slowly release the vacuum pressure, stop the rotation, and remove the round bottom flask.\n3. Lipid Resuspension and Vesicle Homogenization\nAdd 1 ml 18.2 MΩ H2O to the thin lipid film directly in the round bottom flask. Vigorously vortex the solution at maximum speed, approximately 3,200 rpm, until the lipid film detaches from the glass, which is observable by eye.\nTransfer the lipid dispersion into a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nSet-up a ring stand to hold a homogenizer with a 5 mm tip. Place a microcentrifuge stand below the homogenizer to securely hold the lipid dispersion. Rinse the dispersing element of the homogenizer by immersing the tip in 18.2 MΩ H2O and running for a few seconds.\nPlace the dispersing element directly into the lipid dispersion ensuring that the tip does not touch the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube. Homogenize for 1 min at power level 4 or 14,000 rpm.\n4. Vesicle Extrusion and Lyophilization\nAssemble the parts of the mini-extruder (Figure 2), which consists of an outer casing and a retainer nut that houses two Teflon internal membrane supports, two O-rings, and one Teflon bearing.\n\t\nPlace the two O-rings into the grooves of the internal membrane supports. Prewet two filters and one 400 nm membrane. The filters will be placed against the Teflon inside of the O-rings with the membrane between them.\nPlace the membrane supports into the extruder outer casing with the membrane surrounded by two filters in between the O-rings. Place the Teflon bearing inside the casing and attach the retainer nut and tighten by hand.",
    "Rinse two syringes and fill one with 18.2 MΩ water. Insert the syringe needles into the small holes in the Teflon on either end of the extruder assembly. The needles should slide in easily; do not force the needles. Secure the extruder with the syringes into the extruder housing and fasten.\nPass the water through the extruder by slowly pushing the water out of one syringe and into the other. This represents one passage. Repeat for a total of three passages ensuring that there are no leaks present. Remove the syringe of water and dispose of the water.\nFill one syringe with the sample, attach to the extruder, and slowly pass the vesicle solution through the membrane as described above in step 4.3. Repeat 10x for a total of 11 passages. As the extrusion process proceeds, the sample will become less turbid and easier to push across the membrane. A sudden decrease in resistance, however, usually indicates a rupturing of the membrane.\nTransfer the extruded vesicle solution and make 40 μl aliquots of the vesicles into microcentrifuge tubes. Flash freeze each aliquot in either dry ice or in liquid nitrogen.\nLyophilize each aliquot with a centrifugal evaporator overnight at 30 °C. Store the lyophilized empty vesicles at -20 °C.\n5. Encapsulating Transcription-translation Machinery\nMix the components of the transcription-translation reaction and add 20 units of RNase inhibitor. Incubate on ice.\nAdd the DNA template. For a control reaction, 250 ng of a plasmid encoding mVenus or a similar fluorescent protein behind a T7 transcriptional promoter and a strong E. coli ribosome binding site is recommended.\nBring the final volume to 25 μl with RNase-free water.",
    "Hydrate an aliquot of lyophilized vesicles (from step 4.6) with 10 μl of the reaction assembled in step 5.3. Briefly vortex the mixture until the vesicles are resuspended. This should take less than 30 sec.\nIncubate the reaction on ice for 30 min to allow the vesicles to swell.\nDilute the vesicle mixture 20-fold to a final volume of 30 μl by adding 1.5 μl of vesicles into 27.0 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and 1.5 μl of 20.2 mg/ml Proteinase K. DNase and RNase can also be added at this point as an alternative to proteinase K to degrade extravesicular material.\nIncubate for at least 2.5 hr at 37 °C.\n6. Microscopy\nExamine the vesicles and the progress of fluorescent protein production at different time points. The vesicles will have a larger diameter than the 400 nm pore-size of the membrane used for vesicle extrusion.\n\t\nPrepare a sample chamber by placing a 20 x 5 mm silicon spacer onto a standard microscope slide. Pipette 10 μl of vesicles into the sample chamber. Place a siliconized glass cover slip over the chamber.\nObserve the vesicles with a 63X oil-dispersion or similar objective by bright field and fluorescence microscopy using the appropriate filter set for the exploited fluorescent protein."
