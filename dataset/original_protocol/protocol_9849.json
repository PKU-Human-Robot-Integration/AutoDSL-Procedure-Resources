    "This protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number CF16/1108 - 2016000590) in accordance with the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research24. Procedures were developed under the guidance of an accredited Medical Physicist, Nuclear Medicine Technologist, and clinical radiographer. Researchers should refer to their local experts and guidelines for the administration of ionizing radiation in humans.\n1. Required equipment and personnel\nSee the Table of Materials for the scanner room, radiochemistry lab, and general materials. A commercial supplier was used for the radiotracer.\nIn the simultaneous MRI-PET environment, use four personnel: a radiographer (RG) to run the scan, a nuclear medicine technologist (NMT) to oversee the administration of the radiotracer and acquisition of blood samples, a laboratory assistant (LA) to spin blood, and a research assistant (RA) responsible to oversee the experimental design and stimulus presentation.\n2. Preparation\nTracer dose preparation by the NMT\nCalculate the infusion volume that will be administered over the course of the scan. In this protocol, the rate of infusion is 0.01 mL/s over 95 min. So, in a 95 min scan, participants receive 0.01 mL/s x 60 s x 95 min = 57 mL.\nCalculate the tracer dose that will be diluted into the administered saline solution. In this protocol, a total dose of 260 MBq is administered to the participant over 95 min. This dose was chosen to limit radiation exposure to 4.9 mSv, to keep within the 'low level risk' categorization according to Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) guidelines for exposure of humans to ionizing radiation25. Decay correct 260 MBq from the mid-infusion point (47.5 min) back to T0. Using Equation 1, solve for A0\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60259/60259eq1.jpg",
    "Where At is the radioactivity (MBq) at the mid-timepoint of the infusion, A0 is the initial radioactivity, and λ is the radioactive decay constant specific to the tracer. For FDG, the value of is λ ≈ 0.693/T1/2. T1/2 is the half-life of 18F (110 min).\n\t\tNOTE: In this example, At = 260 MBq, λ = 0.693/110, and t = -47.5, so A0 = 350.942 MBq.\nCalculate the required radiotracer dose for the 100 mL saline bag that will be used to administer the dose to the participant. The required radiotracer for the saline bag is diluted up to a total volume of 5 mL and drawn up in a 5 mL syringe. Therefore, for the 100 mL saline bag, the dilution factor is the volume of saline (100 mL) in addition to the 5 mL volume of the syringe with radiotracer. This total volume of 105 mL is divided by the infusion volume of 57 mL (i.e., 105 mL/57 mL = 1.842). So, the total radioactivity in a volume of 5 mL required for addition to the 100 mL bag is A0 x the dilution factor (i.e., 350.942 MBq x 1.842 = 646.44 MBq). Aseptically add the radiotracer to the saline bag.",
    "NOTE: It is important to note that the calculated activity of 646.44 MBq that is added to the saline bag is the activity required at the commencement of the infusion. Generally, the doses for this protocol are prepared between 15 min to 1 h before administration. Therefore, it is important to factor in the decay of the radioisotope. Equation 1 in 2.1.2. can be used to account for this, where time (t) is the total number of minutes from the preparation of the dose to when the activity will be administered, At = 646.44 MBq, by solving for A0.\nPrepare the priming dose. Withdraw 20 mL from the bag into a syringe and cap it. Calibrate this 20 mL syringe and label. The syringe is calibrated as a reference check to ensure that the radioactivity has evenly dispersed within the saline bag.\nPrepare the dose. Using a 50 mL syringe, withdraw 60 mL from the bag and cap with a red Combi stopper. This syringe is not calibrated, as the concentration of the radioactivity is known from the time it was added to the saline bag (step 2.1.3). Store both syringes in the radiochemistry lab until ready to scan.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to draw a 60 mL volume in a 50 mL syringe, because Terumo syringes are marked to 20% above the labelled volume (i.e., a 50 mL syringe is marked to 60 mL).\nPrepare the reference dose. Fill a 500 mL volumetric flask with approximately 480 mL of distilled water. Draw up 10 MBq of 18F-FDG into a syringe, decay-corrected to the scan start time (using Equation 1) and add it to the flask. Top the volume up to the 500 mL mark with more distilled water and mix thoroughly. Affix labels pre- and post-calibration for the syringe.",
    "Scanner room preparation by the NMT\nOnce the participant is positioned in the scanner, there is very little room to manipulate or salvage the line for infusion or blood samples if blockage occurs. Prepare the scanner room to minimize the chance of line blockage.\nEnsure that all blood-collection equipment is within easy reach of the collection site. Place underpads at the end of the cannula and on any surface that will hold blood containers. Place bins for regular waste and biohazardous waste within easy reach of the blood collection site.\nInfusion pump preparation by the NMT\nSet up the infusion pump in the scanner room on the side that will be connected to the participant. Build lead bricks around the base of the pump and place the lead shield in front of the pump. Connect the tubing for the infusion pump that delivers the infusion to the participant and ensure the correct infusion rate has been entered. For this protocol, the rate is 0.01 mL/s.\nPrime the tubing before it is connected to the participant's cannula. Connect the 20 mL priming dose to the infusion pump. On the end of the tubing that will be connected to the participant, attach a three-way tap and an empty 20 mL syringe. Ensure that the tap is positioned to allow the 18F-FDG solution to flow from the priming dose through the tubing and collect only into the empty syringe.\nPreset the infusion pump to prime a volume of 15 mL. Select the Prime button on the pump and follow the prompts to prime the line.",
    "Attach the 50 mL dose syringe to the infusion pump in place of the priming dose. The 15 mL primed dose on the three-way tap can remain there until the participant is ready to be connected to the pump.\nParticipant preparation by the NMT, RA, and RG\nAdvise participants to fast for 6 h, and to consume only water (approximately two glasses), prior to the scan.\nHave the RA conduct the consent procedures and acquire additional measures (e.g., demographic surveys, cognitive batteries, etc.). Have the NMT and RG conduct the safety screens, the NMT review safety for PET scanning (e.g., exclusion for pregnancy, diabetes, chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the previous 8 weeks, and known allergies), and the RG review participant safety for MRI scanning (e.g., exclusion for pregnancy, medical or non-medical metallic implants, non-removable dental implants, claustrophobia).\nCannulate the participant.\n\t\t\nUse two cannulas: one for dose administration and the other for blood sampling. The most appropriate cannula varies across participants, but the most suitable vein should be reserved for blood collection. A 22 G cannula is the preferred minimum size. Collect a 10 mL baseline blood sample while cannulating. Disconnect all saline flushes under pressure to maintain patency of the line.\nTest the participant's blood sugar level and other baseline blood measures (e.g., hemoglobin) from the baseline sample.\nParticipant positioning in the scanner by the RG and NMT\nHave the RG position the participant in the scanner bore. For long scans, it is imperative to ensure comfort in order to reduce the risk of the participant dropping out and motion artefact due to discomfort. The participant should be covered with a disposable blanket to maintain a comfortable body temperature.",
    "Have the NMT flush the cannula to ensure it is patent with minimal resistance before connecting the infusion line. Once connected, the tubing can be lightly taped near the wrist. Instruct the participant to keep their arm straightened. Use supports such as foam or cushions for comfort. Have the NMT also check the cannula that will be used for plasma samples to ensure that it is able to withdraw blood with minimal resistance. It may be necessary to connect an extension tube primed with normal saline to make the cannula more accessible while the participant is in the scanner. If this is required, it should be checked for leakages.\nOnce the subject is in the scanner bore, have the NMT check that they have suitable access to both cannulas.\nHave the NMT notify the RG and RA if there are any issues with the blood collection cannula, infusion cannula, or the infusion pump (e.g., occlusion, battery, extravasation) at any time during the scan.\n3. Scan the participant\nStarting the scan with the NMT, RG, and RA\nAt the start of the scan, situate the NMT in the scanner room to monitor the infusion equipment. Ensure the NMT is wearing hearing protection and using the barrier shield to minimize radiation exposure from the dose where possible.\nAs the RG performs the localizer scan to ensure that the participant is in the correct position, check the details for the PET acquisition (e.g., scan duration, list-mode data collection, correct isotope).",
    "Design the protocol so that the PET acquisition will commence with the first MRI sequence. The RG prepares and starts the MRI sequence. The start time of the 95 min PET acquisition is time-locked to the start of the MRI sequence. If required, the NMT should deliver the bolus at the time of PET acquisition (Figure 1).\nStart the infusion pump. The RG should signal the NMT (e.g., via a thumbs-up sign) to start the pump 30 s after the start of the PET acquisition. This protocol starts the infusion pump 30 s after the scan start time to provide a safety buffer in case of scan failure. This also ensures that the first image taken during the PET scan indexes the brain prior to radiotracer administration for complete time activity curve data collection. Have the NMT observe the pump to ensure it has started to infuse the 18F-FDG and that there is no immediate occlusion of the line.\nHave the RA initiate any external stimulus at the agreed upon time (i.e., at the start of a functional run/experimental block) and calculate the times for blood samples. An example record form is shown in Supplement 1. Have the RA calculate the predicted time of each blood sample and provide copies to the NMT and lab assistant (LA). Have the RA ensure that the NMT takes the blood samples at approximately the correct time, and monitors equipment (e.g., infusion pump, stimulus) for any signs of errors.\nTake blood samples at regular time intervals\nHave the NMT and RA take one sample every 10 min. There are usually 10 samples in total, not including the baseline sample.\nIf acquiring MRI scans simultaneously with PET scans, have the NMT wear hearing protection when entering the scanner room.",
    "Have the NMT wear gloves and swab the tip of the cannula clean. While the cannula site dries, open a 5 mL and a 10 mL syringe, vacutainer, and a 10 mL saline flush.\nUsing the 5 mL syringe, withdraw 4-5 mL of fresh blood and discard the syringe in the biohazard waste.\nUsing the 10 mL syringe, withdraw up to 10 mL of blood. The volume may be limited by how easily the blood can be withdrawn. It is important to minimize any resistance subsequently causing damage to the red blood cells that can hemolyze. At the midcollection point, have the NMT signal to the RA, who will mark this time on the record form (Supplement 1) as the 'actual' time of sample.\nConnect the 10 mL syringe to the vacutainer and then deposit the blood into the relevant blood tube.\nQuickly flush the cannula with 10 mL of saline, disconnected under pressure, to minimize any chance of line clotting.\nImmediately take the blood sample to the radiochemistry lab for analysis.\nSpinning the blood by the LA\nHave the LA get all the equipment ready (Table 1) and be wear gloves. Have three racks set out for the samples: one for blood tubes, one for pipetting the sample, and one for filled pipetted samples (pre- and post-counting).\n\t\t\nHave the LA regularly change gloves throughout the procedure, especially when handling the counting tube. If the LA has any radioactive plasma contamination on their gloves, it can be transferred to the counting tube and spuriously increase the number of recorded counts of the sample.",
    "The blood sample can be placed in the centrifuge as the availability of staffing resources permits, because the time that the blood sample was taken, and the time it was counted was noted. Spin all samples at a relative centrifugal force of 724 x g. The centrifuge settings used for this protocol are 2,000 rpm for 5 min with the acceleration and deceleration curves set to eight.\nOnce the sample has been spun, place the tube in the pipetting rack. Remove the tube cap to not disturb sample separation. Place a labelled counting tube in the rack. The label should correspond to the blood tube.\nEnsure the tip is securely fastened to the pipette. Have a tissue ready for any drips. Steadily pipette 1,000 µL of plasma from the blood tube, transfer to the counting tube, and replace the lids on the counting tube and blood tube.\nPlace the counting tube into the well counter and count for 4 min. Record the counting start time on the record sheet ('measurement time') for every sample. This is required for subsequent corrections to the PET acquisition start time. At later time points during the scan, have the LA perform each step in rapid succession to avoid a backlog of samples.\nDispose of any blood product waste in biohazard bags.\nSubscription Required.
