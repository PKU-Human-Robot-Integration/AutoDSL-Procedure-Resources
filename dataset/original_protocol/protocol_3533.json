    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing hESCs/hiPSCs cultures for neural differentiation\nTiming: 6–10 days\nThis step permits the expansion of hPSC lines for cryostorage and produces healthy pluripotent colonies of hESCs/ hiPSCs suitable for neural differentiation. hESCs/ hiPSCs are cultured under feeder-free conditions and passaged when cells approach 70% confluency. Cells are passaged at least twice before starting the differentiation.\nPrepare Geltrex matrix coated plates before starting the hESC/hiPSC culture. One 6-well plate is sufficient to start the differentiation.\nThaw Geltrex matrix for 12–16 h at 2°C–8°C. Make smaller aliquots (500 μL-1 mL) using refrigerated pipette tips to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Aliquots can be stored at −30°C for up to 1 year.\nDilute Geltrex matrix 1:100 in cold DMEM:F12 medium using refrigerated pipette tips to avoid precocious gelling. (For example- 100 μL Geltrex in 10 mL DMEM:F12 media)\nNote: If hPSC colonies show enhanced differentiation and low adherence, use lower dilution (1:75) of Geltrex for the maintenance cultures.\nAdd 1.5 mL diluted Geltrex to each well of the 6-well plate. Make sure to cover the entire surface of the well.\nIncubate plates at 25°C for minimum of 1 h.\nAspirate off Geltrex before adding medium to the wells and rinse with 1× PBS once before use.\nNote: Coated plates can be stored at 2°C–8°C for 1 week in DMEM:F12 if wrapped in parafilm to prevent evaporation.\nThaw hESCs/hiPSC lines by warming cryovials containing hESCs/hiPSCs in a 37°C water bath. At the first signs of thawing, cells must immediately be transferred into 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of warm mTesR1 medium to reduce cryo-preservant mediated damage.\nNote: Resuspending thawed cells in 10 times volume of the warm mTesR1 medium enhances the cell survival.\nSpin cells at 112 × g for 5 min.",
    "Resuspend cells in 12 mL mTesR1 medium and transfer 2 mL of the cell suspension into each well of the Geltrex-coated plate.\nChange medium every day to reduce probability of spontaneous differentiation (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C for examples of differentiated colonies). Cells will be ready for the first passage in 3–4 days. At this point, the healthy hESCs/hiPSCs colonies will appear as a tight, flat colonies separated from each other (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/455-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Images of healthy and differentiated hESC/hiPSC colonies\n(A) Healthy hESC/hiPSC cultures should contain flat hESCs/hiPSC colonies with smooth edges.\n(B and C) In contrast, differentiated cultures have colonies that appear as clusters of scattered cells (B) or pigmented mounds (C). These colonies need to be removed before passaging.\nScale bar (all panels), 500 μm.\nNote: Unhealthy hESCs/hiPSCs cultures can be distinguished by having more differentiated clones (see examples of differentiated clones in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). In this case, try a) optimizing the Geltrex concentration for the coating, b) use earlier passage cultures, or c) remove the differentiated cells either by scratching them using a sterile pipette tip or careful aspiration with a pipette tip attached to a vacuum line.\nOnce cells reach 70% confluency, start the first cell passage by preparing another Geltrex-coated 6-well plate. This 6-well plate will be directly used for the differentiation.\nCells are passaged at 1:3 ratio. This way, two wells of the first 6-well plate (starting culture plate) will be passaged into the freshly prepared Geltrex-coated 6-well plate (differentiation plate).\nWash wells to be passaged with 2 mL 1× PBS.\nAdd 1 mL ReLeSR reagent and aspirate after 1 min to ensure that the colonies are only exposed to a thin film of ReLeSR reagent.",
    "Note: ReLeSR circumvents removing the differentiated clones manually, since it only causes the pluripotent stem cell clones to detach, leaving most differentiated clones adhered to the plate.\nIncubate plate at 37°C for approximately 3 min. This incubation step may need to be optimized for the individual cell lines. For example, some hiPSC lines require 2 min while the H9 hESC line requires 3 min.\nAdd 2 mL mTesR1 medium to the wells treated with ReLeSR reagent. Large fragments of stem cell colonies should be seen floating in the medium. Triturate 2–3 times with a 5 mL glass pipette to break colonies in smaller pieces. Avoid generating a single-cell suspension because it will result in poor cell survival.\nNote: glass pipettes are recommended for this step to prevent losing cell clusters during the transfer process. Cells show less attachment to a glass surface.\nCollect medium containing the cell colonies in a 15 mL tube and add extra mTesR1 medium up to 12 mL and gently triturate 2 times for homogeneous distribution of the cell clusters. Transfer 2 mL cell suspension in each well of the newly coated 6-well plate.\nPlace 6-well plate in incubator at 37°C. mTesR1 medium should be changed daily to avoid spontaneous differentiation.\nThe newly passaged 6-well plate should reach 80%–90% confluency in 4–5 days and can be used to start the differentiation.\nNote: We recommend using hESCs/hiPSCs culture with 2–4 passages for this differentiation protocol. Cultures with more than 5 passages tend to spontaneously differentiate at higher rates.\nNote: Cells at 80%–90% confluency should be immediately used in the differentiation procedure. Leaving cells at higher confluency for long periods (>1–2 days) can lead to spontaneous differentiation.",
    "Critical: Make sure there are no differentiated colonies in these expanding cultures. These colonies can be identified by the apparent scattered morphology of cells (arrows, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) or as pigmented clustered cells (arrows, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Remove the differentiated clones by scratching them using sterile pipette tip or careful aspiration with pipette tip attached to vacuum.\nTwo-dimensional differentiation to the neuroectoderm stage\nTiming: 6 days\nThe next step is to direct pluripotent hESCs/ hiPSCs toward a spinal neuroectodermal fate, which can be assessed by the generation of SOX1+/ PAX6+ neural progenitors. For more details see (Gupta et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nPrepare SaND medium and pre-heat in 37°C water bath before use.\nRemove 6-well plate prepared in step 8 from the incubator.\nAspirate mTeSR1 medium from all wells of the 6-well plate.\nAdd 2 mL SaND medium to each well of the 6-well plate and return the plate to the incubator.\nFeed cells every other day with SaND medium for up to 6 days.\nCells should appear as a monolayer with cells packed together tightly at the end of day 6 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). This confluency is optimal for embryoid body (EB) formation in the next step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/455-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Formation of embryoid bodies\n(A) By day 6 in SaND medium, the cells have formed a tight monolayer.\n(B) Embryoid bodies are formed after these cells are dissociated and seeded in ultra-low attachment plate as a single-cell suspension.\n(C) Large EBs should be observed in the culture, by day 3 after the seeding into the ultra-low attachment plate.\nScale bar (all panels), 500 μm.\nNote: See “Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]” section below\nOptional: After 6 days, plate can be fixed for immunohistochemistry or RNA can be isolated from the cells to check for the expression of neuroectodermal markers, i.e., SOX1 and PAX6.\nEmbryoid body formation",
    "Timing: 4 days\nThe next step is to grow the neuroectodermal cells as embryoid bodies (EBs) in suspended 3d culture. One 6-well differentiation plate, prepared in step 14, can be used to seed four 24 well plates. This protocol requires ultra-low attachment 24 well plates which prevent cells from attaching to the bottom of the plate and allow 3d embryoid body formation. Plan the experiment according to the number of 24 well plates required for all necessary end points.\nPrepare enough SaND medium with 1 μM RA, and 10 μM ROCK inhibitors.\nNote: RA stock is made in DMSO at 100 mM concentration. Dilute the stock to 1 mM in 100% ethanol. This working stock can be stored at 4°C and can be used for up to 1 week.\nNote: RA is both light sensitive and a potent teratogen. All work should be performed under low-light conditions and the concentrated RA stock must be disposed of properly.\nNote: The hESCs are vulnerable to apoptosis upon dissociation which leads to poor EB formation. Adding ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to the cell dissociation medium has been shown to significantly inhibit apoptosis and enhance the EB formation (Watanabe et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Pettinato et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The concentration of ROCK inhibitor needed, may have to be empirically determined with different hESCs/hiPSCs lines, if poor EB formation is observed.\nPre-heat SaND medium in 37°C water bath.\nRemove 6-well differentiation plate, prepared in step 14, from the incubator.\nAspirate SaND medium from the well and wash cells once with 1× PBS.\nAdd 1 mL Accutase to each well of the 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 10 min.\nRemove plate from the incubator and gently tap the bottom of the plate to dislodge the cell clusters.",
    "Add 2 mL of SaND medium + 1 μM RA with 10 μM ROCK inhibitors in each well and collect the cell suspension.\nTriturate the cell suspension 1–2 times using a glass pipette to break apart the larger cell clusters into a single-cell suspension.\nNote: glass pipettes are recommended for this step to prevent losing cell clusters during the transfer process. Cells show less attachment to a glass surface.\nEqually distribute cell suspension in two 50 mL tubes. Centrifuge cells at 112 × g for 5 min. Aspirate liquid and gently resuspend cells in 50 mL SaND medium with 1 μM RA + 10 μM ROCK inhibitors. The total cell suspension at this stage will be 100 mL.\nTransfer 1 mL of cells in SaND medium into each well of the ultra-low attachment 24 well plate to promote EB formation.\nNote: Ultra-low attachment plates have a specialized surface coated with a hydrophobic hydrogel which inhibits cell attachment and forces them to remain in the suspension to make embryoid bodies (EBs).\nNote: Embryoid bodies (EBs) are 3-dimensional stem cell aggregates. Stem cells differentiate better as EBs because they recapitulate the cell-cell interactions found in growing tissues.\nReturn 24-well plates to 37°C. After 2 days, the resuspended cells should have formed small EBs in each well (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nChange the medium on EB cultures on the next day and then every 2 days.\nTilt the ultra-low attachment plate to collect the EBs against the wall of the well. This will prevent EBs from drying out.\nGently aspirate medium, without disturbing the EB pellet.\nAdd fresh 1 mL SaND medium+ 1 μM RA (without ROCK inhibitor) in each well.",
    "Alternatively, medium can be changed by collecting all the EBs in one 50 mL conical tube and allow EBs to settle at the bottom of the tube by gravity. This process takes 5–10 min.\nAdd 50 mL of fresh SaND medium with 1 μM RA in the tube and resuspend the EBs.\nTransfer 1 mL EBs + medium back to the ultra-low attachment 24-well plate.\nNote: It is not required to use fresh ultra-low attachment plate with every media change.\nNote: ROCK inhibitor is only required on the day of EB formation, i.e., steps 21 and 23. The SaND medium that is used to feed EBs does not require ROCK inhibitors.\nInduction of dorsal sensory interneurons\nTiming: 7 days\nThis step directs 3d EBs toward different cell fates, i.e., dI4/6 (protocol 1) or dI1/3 (protocol 2), by the addition of either RA alone or both RA and BMP4 (RA+BMP4).\nPrepare SaND medium supplemented with either 1 μM RA for protocol 1 or 1 μM RA+10 ng/mL human recombinant BMP4 for protocol 2.\nPre-heat medium in 37°C water bath.\nProtocol 1: Induce dI4 and dI6 by transferring EBs into SaND medium + 1 μM RA on day 10. Protocol 2: Induce dI1 and dI3s by transferring EBs into SaND medium with 1 μM RA + 10 ng/mL human recombinant BMP4 on day 10.\nTransfer EBs to fresh SaND medium by collecting EBs in 50 mL conical tube.\nAllow EBs to settle at the bottom of the tube by gravity. This step will take 5–10 min.\nAspirate the liquid from the tube and resuspend in either SaND medium +1 μM RA (protocol 1) or SaND medium with 1 μM RA+ 10 ng/mL BMP4 (protocol 2).\nResuspend EBs and transfer 1 mL EBs+ medium to low attachment 24-well plate.",
    "Feed EBs by transferring them into fresh SaND medium + growth factors after every 2 days., as described in step 26.\nNote: BMP4 aliquots should be freshly thawed and not be subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nNeuronal differentiation and maturation\nTiming: 19 days\nThis step permits dorsal EBs to differentiate and then mature into dI4/6 and dI1/3 neurons. EBs are passaged through both differentiation and maturation media. Ascorbic acid in the maturation medium enhances the differentiation process. At the end of the protocol, EBs can either be fixed, sectioned, and stained directly, or dissociated and plated onto laminin coated slides to examine the neuronal morphology.\nPrepare neural differentiation medium (NBDM) and maturation medium supplemented with either 1 μM RA for protocol 1 or 1 μM RA+10 ng/mL human recombinant BMP4 for protocol 2.\nTransfer EBs from protocol 1 into NBDM supplemented with 1 μM RA.\nTransfer EBs from protocol 2 into NBDM supplemented with 1 μM RA + 10 ng/mL BMP4.\nTransfer EBs to fresh NBDM by collecting EBs in 50 mL conical tube.\nAllow EBs to settle down at the bottom of the tube by gravity. This step will take 5–10 min.\nAspirate the liquid from the tube and resuspend in either NBDM +1 μM RA (protocol 1) or NBDM +1 μM RA+ 10 ng/mL BMP4 (protocol 2).\nResuspend EBs and transfer 1 mL of EB suspension to low attachment 24 well plate.\nTransfer EBs to fresh NBDM medium supplemented with growth factors after every 2 days.\nAt day 28, transfer EBs from protocol 1 into maturation medium supplemented with 1 μM RA and, EBs from protocol 2 into maturation medium supplemented with 1 μM RA + 10 ng/mL BMP4.",
    "Repeat steps 33 and 34, now with maturation medium, to continue feeding EBs every 2 days until day 36 or any earlier desired endpoint for the quality assessment.\nAt the end of the differentiation, EBs can either be a) fixed directly or dissociated for immunostaining, see steps 39–63 or b) lysed to obtain RNA for a qPCR analysis (see steps 64–67).\nOptional: EBs can be dissociated at the end of the differentiation using Accutase and plated onto laminin coated coverslips or Ibidi chamber slides for immunostaining procedures.\nQuality control analyses of EBs\nTiming: 3–5 days\nImmunostaining analysis of fixed EBs. Prepare fresh 4% PFA in 1× PBS to fix the EBs.\nCollect EBs in a 50 mL conical tube, allow them to settle at the bottom of the tube. Remove medium and wash EBs with 1× PBS. Allow EBs to settle at the bottom of the tube by gravity and aspirate PBS from the tube.\nAdd 5–10 mL 4% PFA in the tube and incubate EBs on an orbital shaker at 25°C for 20 min.\nWash EBs twice with 1× PBS.\nEmbedding for cryo-sectioning: replace PBS with 30% sucrose and allow EBs to equilibrate and settle at the bottom of the tube. This step can take from 30 min to 1 h.\nCarefully transfer the EBs using wide bore pipette tips into a cryo-block filled with OCT (optimum cutting compound). Gently swirl them around in the OCT using 19G–20G hypodermal needle to equilibrate and arrange EBs at bottom-center of the block. Transfer blocks onto dry ice to freeze.\nNote: Try to aspirate all EBs in a 100 μL pipette volume to minimize the amount of sucrose transferred into the OCT.\nPrepare 12 μm sections of EBs on glass slides, using standard cryo-sectioning methods.",
    "Incubate slides with an antibody blocking solution (10% heat inactivated serum in 1× PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100) for 30 min.\nDilute desired primary antibodies in the antibody blocking solution. Replace blocking solution, with 500 μL of diluted antibody solution/slide and incubate for 12–16 h at 4°C in a humidified chamber.\nRemove primary antibody and wash slides twice with 1× PBS + 0.2% Triton (PBTN).\nAdd species appropriate secondary antibodies in PBTN and incubate slides for 1 h in secondary antibody.\nRemove secondary antibody solution and wash slides twice with PBTN.\nCounterstain with DAPI to detect nuclei.\nCoverslip slides using either Vectashield or ProLong Gold mounting media.\nExamine slides using a microscope. Cell numbers can be counted using the ImageJ cell counter plugin.\nImmunostaining analysis of dissociated EBs. Prepare Poly-L-ornithine (PLO) + laminin coated sterile 12 mm coverslips:\nSterile the entire pack of 12 mm coverslips by autoclaving. Place one coverslip in each well of a 24-well plate.\nPrepare 1.5 mg/mL (100×) PLO stock solution in H2O. Dilute to 1× using 1× PBS. Prepare enough diluted PLO solution required for the number of wells to be coated. One well of 24 well plate will be coated with 0.5 mL 1× PLO solution.\nAdd 0.5 mL PLO solution in wells containing the coverslips. Make sure that the coverslips are completely submerged in the solution.\nIncubate at 25°C for 2 h, aspirate the PLO solution, and wash 2 times with H2O. Coverslips are ready to be coated with Laminin.\nThaw laminin for 12–16 h at 2°C–8°C and prepare 10 μg/mL working solution in sterile PBS.\nAdd 0.2–0.5 mL laminin on PLO coated coverslips and incubate at RT for 2 h.\nAspirate laminin and wash two times with sterile PBS. Coverslips are ready to be used.",
    "Note: PBS is only removed when ready to plate cells. Drying of coated coverslips lead to poor cell attachment.\nCollect EBs that are to be dissociated in a 50 mL conical tube. Aspirate supernatant and add 1 mL Accutase. Incubate EBs+Accutase in 37°C incubator for 3–5 min.\nTriturate 5–6 times to break EBs into smaller clumps. Medium will appear cloudy at this point because of breaking of EBs into multiple smaller clumps.\nSpin the medium with dissociated EBs at 112 × g for 5 min and resuspend cells in the required maturation medium.\nPlate dissociated EBs onto the coated coverslips (present in the wells of 24-well plate) at the density of 25,000–50,000 cells/well. Place the plate in 37°C incubator for 1–2 days, until cells start to take on a neuronal morphology.\nImmunostaining analysis of the dissociated EBs. Wash wells containing neuron-plated coverslips with 1× PBS.\nAdd cold 4% PFA in each well and incubate the plate on ice for 8–10 min.\nAspirate the PFA and wash the coverslips with 1× PBS two times.\nFollow steps 46–51 for blocking and antibody staining.\nTo mount the stained coverslips onto a glass slide for the microscopic examination, place a drop of ProLong Gold (40–50 μL) onto a glass slide. Carefully place the stained coverslip in a manner that the sample surface faces the mounting medium. Avoid air bubbles.\nAir dry slides for 10–15 min. Coverslips are now ready for the microscopy.\nqPCR analysis. Collect RNA lysate for RNA extraction.\nNote: this method of RNA isolation has been optimized for the RNeasy Plus mini kit (QIAGEN). Other RNA extraction methods can be used, but the protocol may need modification.\nCollect EBs in a 15 mL conical tube. Wash once with 1× PBS.",
    "Remove PBS and add 500 μL RLT buffer, which is included in the RNeasy Plus mini kit (QIAGEN).\nDissociate EBs in RLT buffer by passing through QIAshredder (QIAGEN).\nCollect the elutant and proceed for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPrepare cDNA samples from the isolated RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: the instructions for preparing cDNA can be accessed on the following link-https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/18091050#/18091050[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/18091050#/18091050].\nSet up 10 μL qRT-PCR reaction with the LightCycler SYBR green master mix using the following cycling parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_455_9.csv\nAnalyze qPCR results using the ΔΔ CT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])."
