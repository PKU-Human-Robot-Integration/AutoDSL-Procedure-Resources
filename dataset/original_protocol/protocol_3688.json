Usually, we inject 30 embryos with each injection mixture. Synthetic RNAs are microinjected according to the protocol of N.M., unpublished data. The main stages of microinjection are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/614-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The main steps of embryo preparation\n(A) Fertilized eggs before cleavage begins.\n(B) Embryos in Terasaki plates before manipulation.\n(C)Capillary preparation for microinjection.\n(D) Microinjection in embryos: general view of the workspace.\n(E) Two-cell stage embryo.\n(F) Embryo at the gastrula stage (stage 12), top (animal) view.\n(G) Embryo at the gastrula stage (stage 12), bottom (vegetal) view.\n(H) Alive (four on the left) and dead (two on the right, indicated by a red dashed line) embryos.\nScale bars are 500 μm.\nEmbryos are incubated up to the stage needed for the research. In our work, we incubate embryos up to stage 12 gastrula. Photos of embryos at the stage of the onset of cleavage (two blastomeres) and the gastrula stage are shown in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E–1G\nNote: Working with X. laevis embryos is convenient because their development can be controlled by temperature. Using the development table (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), the incubation time can be adjusted by changing the temperature. Usually, at room temperature (18°C–20°C), embryos injected at the 2-blastomere stage reach the gastrula stage by the morning of the next day.\nAfter incubation to the gastrula stage, the embryos are pretreated by incubation with 0.1× MMR containing 150 mg/mL cycloheximide for 1 h at 23°C in a petri dish (Lemaitre et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Live embryos are carefully collected in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube, and all the liquid is carefully collected using a pipette with a fine tip (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/614-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The main steps of extracts preparation\n(A) 60 embryos collected in Eppendorf tube to obtain crude extract (step 2)\n(B) Crude extract after centrifugation of embryos (step 3)\n(C) Crude extract, diluted 10 times with buffer N, before centrifugation\n(D) Separated fractions: left -cytoplasmic fraction, right - the pellet containing the cell nuclei (step 4)\n(E) Separated fractions before washing: on the left, the cytoplasmic fraction in buffer E (150 mM KCl), on the right, the nuclei in buffer with 0.8 M sucrose (step 5).\n(F) Fractions after extraction in buffer E and centrifugation: on the left is a cytoplasmic extract without any pellet, on the right is a nuclear extract containing a pellet of pigment and insoluble material.\nCritical: Dead embryos appear as white balls with no clearly visible cells (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H). In the case of microinjections, FLD should also be selected because it is a vital dye observable with a binocular fluorescence microscope. (The use of FLD is described in more detail in the protocol N.M., unpublished data ). Usually, approximately 10% of the embryos are lost at this stage, depending on the quality of the eggs and the properties of the proteins that are encoded by the injected RNA. As noted, incubation in cycloheximide for one hour does not lead to increased embryonic death. In the case where few embryos are viable, this stage can be omitted, but when included, this step provides a clearer picture of protein distribution.\nPause point: The resulting embryos can be frozen and stored at −70°C for several weeks.",
    "The crude extract is obtained by centrifuging the Eppendorf tube containing embryos for 10 min at 14000 g and 4°C. (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nThe resulting extract (30 μL from 30 embryos) is diluted 10-fold in N-buffer (300 μL) with the addition of a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Critical Reagent) at a dilution of 1:50. (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nThe nuclei are pelleted by 8-min centrifugation at 5000 g and 4°C, nuclei are in the pellet, and the cytoplasmic fraction is in the supernatant. (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNuclear extract preparation\nTiming: 90 min\nThe pellet containing the cell nuclei is washed with a solution of 0.8 M sucrose (0.253 g of sucrose is added per 1 mL of buffer N), the volume of the wash is 0.5–1 mL, and it is centrifuged at 14000 g 15 min at 4°C. Washes can be repeated from two to four times.\nCritical: The most critical point is the correct concentration of sucrose (Critical Reagent) in the buffer for use in the primary precipitation of nuclei and nuclei washing. Loss of nuclei is possible if the concentration of sucrose in the wash buffer is too high.\nTo obtain the nuclear extract, the washed nuclei are extracted in 300 μL of buffer E with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) at a dilution of 1:50. Buffer E is buffer N with KCl increased to 150 mM (150 μL 1 M KCl per 1 mL of buffer N) and the addition of NP-40 0.5% (5 μL per 1 mL of buffer N) placed on a rotator for 45 min at 4°C.\nThe nuclear extract is centrifuged at 14000 g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Note: The resulting supernatant is the nuclear extract and can be used for various tests, EMSA, etc. In our study, we concentrate the extract using chloroform-methanol (step 9) precipitation of the proteins and analyze the precipitates by Western blotting according to the standard protocol.\nPreparation of cytoplasmic extract\nTiming: 1 h\nThe supernatant from step 4 (300 μL) is used to prepare a cytoplasmic extract. To clarify the extract and remove nuclei the most thoroughly, the KCl concentration in the supernatant is increased to 150 mM (150 μL 1 M KCl per 1 mL of buffer N) and centrifuged for 10 min at 14000 g at 4°C.\nThe resulting supernatant can be used for the preparation of Western samples, as it contains all the cytoplasmic proteins.\nNote: For further extraction of cytoplasmic proteins in the case of a functional study and for the removal of insoluble materials, the supernatant is diluted 2 times with buffer E: the KCl concentration in the supernatant is increased to 150 mM (150 μL 1 M KCl per 1 mL of buffer N), and 1% NP-40 is added (10 μL per 1 mL). The diluted extract is incubated for 45 min on a rotator and centrifuged for 10 min at 14000 g at 4°C. The resulting supernatant is the cytoplasmic extract.\nConcentration of samples for Western analysis\nTiming: 2 h\nTo concentrate the samples, the protein fraction from the extracts is precipitated with methanol-chloroform:",
    "methanol and chloroform are added to the resulting extract in equal volumes. Typically, 30 embryos produce 300 μL of nuclear extract and 300 μL of cytoplasmic extract.( see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A)Therefore, 300 μL of methanol is added to 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes containing either extract and mixed by inversion, and then, 300 μL of chloroform is added, and it is shaken vigorously by hand or by vortexing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/614-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Methanol/chloroform protein precipitation\n(A) The resulting nuclear (right) and cytoplasmic (left) extracts.\n(B) Methanol/chloroform precipitation. The protein layer appears on the interface between the methanol/water and chloroform phases (step 9, b).\n(C) The protein pellet is collected at the bottom of the tube (step 9,e).\ncentrifuge the fraction for 5 min at 10000 g. The mixture is divided into two phases; the precipitated protein is between the phases in the form of a film floating on the phase boundary. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B)\nthe upper methanol-chloroform phase is carefully removed to avoid removing the film.\na triple volume of methanol (900–1000 μL) is added to the Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 g.\nthe proteins collected at the bottom of the tube appear as a white precipitate. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C)\nthe protein precipitate is air-dried for 1–2 h, depending on the mass of the pellet.\nCritical: The protein precipitate should be dried for no more than 120 min. It is important to not let the precipitate air dry for a long time period, as this could negatively impact protein solubilization.\nthe dried pellet is dissolved in 100 μL of 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer. The samples are boiled for 10 min at 80°C and stored at −20°C until use.",
    "the samples are analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Detection is performed with the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-Myc alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibodies (Sigma) for Myc-tagged Ybx1 detection and anti-Zyxin rabbit polyclonal monospecific antibodies for Zyxin detection (Martynova et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: Samples for Western blotting can be made from extracts without precipitation. To do this, a 50-μL aliquot is taken from both extracts and an equal volume of 4× Laemmli buffer is added to them. The sample volume for Western blot analysis depends on the volume of the well, and we usually load 20–25 μL samples onto a 1.5-mm gel using 10-well gel combs.\nPause point: Samples in Laemmli buffer can be stored for several months."
