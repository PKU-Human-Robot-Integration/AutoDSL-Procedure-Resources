    "Bone and tooth preparation Note: The investigator must wear a face mask, gloves and clean laboratory coat to ensure no contamination of the samples. These must be changed between samples. The benchtop must be cleaned as described below between samples and new (cleaned and sterilized) tools used for each sample. Modern (control) samples should be handled in a different location on a different day to the archaeological samples.Clean the benchtop with sodium hypochlorite solution (prepared as described in Recipes).Clean the archaeological bones and teeth using sterilized water and autoclaved cheesecloth to remove dirt.Allow to air dry (on the benchtop).Clean the bone samples (but not teeth) using autoclaved sandpaper.Note: Since tooth enamel forms a hard, smooth surface, sandpaper doesn’t have much of an effect on it and dirt particles can be removed by simply using the autoclaved cheesecloth.Wipe the bones and teeth with sodium hypochlorite solution using autoclaved cheesecloth, making sure the samples are exposed to sodium hypochlorite for 15 min for sterilization.Allow to air dry (on the benchtop).Place the bone and tooth samples on autoclaved A4 paper.Wearing safety glasses, drill the bone and tooth samples using the draper drill and sterilized mounted grinding stones (previously immersed in sodium hypochlorite solution for 15 min, dried and autoclaved) until the necessary amount of bone or tooth powder has been collected in DNA grade 15 ml tubes (25-100 mg of bone or tooth powder/tube).Store the bone powder and tooth powder at -20 °C until further processing.Note: Approximately 25 mg of bone or tooth powder will provide one PG or GAG sample later on for agarose gel electrophoresis.  Proteoglycan extraction Note: The investigator must wear a face mask, gloves and clean laboratory coat to ensure no contamination of the samples.",
    "Modern (control) samples should be handled in a different location on a different day to the archaeological samples.Suspend 25-100 mg of the bone or tooth powder prepared above in 4.5 ml of a solution of 4 M guanidine-HCl, 20 mM NaH2PO4, 30 mM Na2HPO4, 300 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, containing cOmplete proteinase inhibitor cocktail.Note: The solution to suspend the bone or tooth powder is prepared with MilliQ water and contains one tablet of cOmplete proteinase inhibitor cocktail added to 50 ml of solution, as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.Maintain under constant rotation at 4 °C for 24 h to keep the solution moving and prevent sedimentation of the bone or tooth powder (e.g., on a tube rotator in a cold room).Add 9 ml of a solution of 7 M urea, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.05 M CH3COONa, pH 6.5, containing cOmplete proteinase inhibitor cocktail. Note: The solution is prepared with MilliQ water and one tablet of cOmplete proteinase inhibitor cocktail added to 50 ml of solution, as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Maintain under constant rotation at 4 °C for an additional 24 h to keep the solution moving and prevent sedimentation of the bone or tooth powder (e.g., on a tube rotator in a cold room).Filter the solution through a Poly-Prep® chromatography column to remove fine particles at 4 °C (e.g., in a cold room).Concentrate and desalinize the solution using an Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit, at 4 °C, to approximately 500 μl.Add cOmplete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (from stock solution 25x conc., prepared according to the manufacturer’s recommendations) and vacuum dry in a centrifugal evaporator (freeze dry).Store the crude protein/proteoglycan extract at -20 °C until further processing.Note: 25 mg of bone or tooth powder provides approximately 5 μg of PGs.",
    "Glycosaminoglycan extractionNote: The investigator must wear a face mask, gloves and clean laboratory coat to ensure no contamination of the samples. Modern (control) samples should be handled in a different location on a different day to the archaeological samples.Suspend 25-50 mg of the bone or tooth powder prepared above in 1 ml of maxatase solution (prepared as described in Recipes).Incubate the samples in a water bath at 60 °C for 2 days.Add 0.1 sample volume of trichloroacetic acid (TCA), vortex and keep the samples on ice for 15 min.Note: TCA should be added using a glass pipet in a fume hood to avoid inhalation of vapours. When handling TCA avoid skin contact, wear safety glasses to protect eyes and wear gloves, preferably nitrile gloves. Always add TCA to the sample and not the reverse. Centrifuge the samples (15 min, 2,250 x g, at 4 °C) and collect the supernatant (placing it on ice).Slowly add 2 sample volumes of methanol in a dropwise manner whilst vortexing.Note: The complete volume of methanol must be added with constant vortexing in an uninterrupted manner.Allow the samples to sit at -20 °C overnight for GAGs to precipitate.Note: It is important the samples are handled with care (transported on ice and with no brisk movements) while transported to and from the freezer.Centrifuge the samples (10 min, 2,250 x g, at 4 °C).Discard the supernatant by pipetting and dry the pellet at room temperature (until dry) or in a laboratory oven (50 °C for approximately 1 h).Note: Remove the lid from the tubes and cover the opening with Parafilm. Pierce the Parafilm to allow the methanol to evaporate.Store the crude glycosaminoglycan extract at -20 °C until further processing.Note: 25 mg of bone or tooth powder provides approximately 5 μg of GAGs.",
    "PG and GAG analysisFor analysis and quantification of PGs and GAGs (chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and heparan sulphate) by agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Dietrich and Dietrich (1976), suspend (1 μg/μl) the crude protein/PG extract and GAG extract in MilliQ water with or without cOmplete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (from stock solution 25x conc., prepared according to the manufacturer’s recommendations), respectively, and apply 5 μl to the agarose gel.For quantification of hyaluronic acid (HA) as described by Martins et al. (2003), suspend 20 μg of the GAG extract in 300 μl of blocking buffer (prepared as described in Recipes) for performing the assay in triplicate."
