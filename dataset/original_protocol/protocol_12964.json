    "1. Preparation of Plant Material\nPrior to experimentation, raise new seedlings of the preferred tree species from seed or cutting and grow tree/s until the diameter of the stem in the area intended for experimentation is approximately 1 cm in diameter.\n\tNote: The time needed may vary due to plant growth rates therefore allow between three to nine months for this step.\n2. Binary Vector Creation\nConduct work from this section to section 7 in a laboratory or greenhouse where Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be handled and that appropriate personal protective equipment prescribed for the laboratory is used.\nPrepare a binary vector containing either a gene of interest knockdown or overexpression cassette and a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene cassette or a promoter of interest fused to a GUS gene depending on the type of study.\n\tNote: There are a number of binary vector backbones that can be sourced commercially or through research networks as well as numerous techniques available to insert genes and promoters of interest into binary vectors. In the context of this protocol is up to the experimenter to make the decision on how to create a binary vector.\nTransform binary vector into a disarmed strain of A. tumefaciens using electroporation or heat shock14 and store appropriately until needed for experimentation.\nRepeat step 2.2 for any positive and/or negative controls.\n\tNote: Negative controls should include a binary vector containing no gene of interest for a gene of interest study and a promoterless GUS for a promoter of interest study. Positive control for a promoter of interest study should include a Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35s promoter (CaMV35s) fused to a GUS reporter.\n3. Preparation of A. tumefaciens for Inoculation",
    "At least a week prior to experimentation, take a small amount (approximately 1 µl) of A. tumefaciens prepared during step 2.2 and 2.3 and spread thinly on separate LB medium with agar14 plates containing appropriate antibiotics for bacterial selection. Grow at 28 °C in an incubator to form small colonies and then store at 4 °C until needed.\n48 hours prior to experimentation, transfer one colony of A. tumefaciens from each plate into separate 50 ml screw top tubes containing 5 ml of pre-warmed (28 °C) LB media14 containing appropriate antibiotics for bacterial selection and agitate at 200 rpm on a shaker incubator for approximately 48 hr at 28 °C until mixture is very cloudy.\nBetween 4-6 hr prior to inoculation of plant stems (section 4) add 1 ml of the LB/A. tumefaciens mixture into a fresh 50 ml screw top tube containing 19 ml (1:20 dilution) of fresh warm (28 °C) LB media with appropriate antibiotics for bacterial selection. If optical density (OD) at 600 nm (OD600, as measured by spectroscopy) is above 0.1, dilute further with warm LB until this is achieved.\nPlace diluted LB/A. tumefaciens mixture back on the shaker incubator and shake under the same conditions (200 rpm, 28 °C) until OD600 is between 0.4-0.6 and remove.\nCentrifuge LB/A. tumefaciens mixture for 15 min at 1,000 x g and 4 °C.\nDecant liquid and immediately resuspend A. tumefaciens pellet into 1 ml of cooled MS media15, transfer to 2 ml microtube and store on ice until required for inoculation (section 4). This solution is referred to as Inoculation Media.\n4. Inoculation of Plant Stem with A. tumefaciens​",
    "Start experimentation during late spring or early summer using plants created in section 1 that have an active and fast growing cambium. A good diagnostic for an active and fast growing cambium is that the phloem can be easily peeled from the xylem.\nFind a clear straight section of stem near the base of the plant and remove any leaves and branches.\nUsing a sharp scalpel (preferably No. 11) or razor blade, create a 1 cm2 'cambial window' in a clear section of stem by introducing two vertical parallel incision through the phloem of 20 mm in length and one 5 mm apart then a horizontal cut that connects the two vertical cuts at their basal end.\nPeel the phloem strip created by the incision upwards exposing the developing xylem tissue and add sufficient Inoculation Media from step 3.6 to wet the surface of the exposed developing xylem using a pipette (typically 5-10 µl). Immediately reinsert the phloem strip.\nBind the phloem strip to the stem tightly with Parafilm.\nRepeat steps 4.2 to 4.5 for any additional cambial windows for the gene(s) or promoter(s) of interest creating any new cambial windows least 1 cm above or below other cambial windows and at a 90° offset.\nComplete steps 4.2 to 4.5 for the positive and negative control vectors (step 2.4) ensuring that each vector is added to the same stem of each plant used in the experiment.\nMonitor stem diameter growth periodically and harvest for GUS assay (section 5) when radial growth of at least 5 mm has been observed in stems.\n\tNote: The amount of radial growth needed is dependent on the amount of tissue required for downstream analysis.\n5. Harvesting for GUS Histological Assay",
    "Excise the 'cambial window' from the stem removing any tissue not part of new growth within the cambial window.\n\t\nFor studies relating to mature xylem and phloem cell/tissue morphology, peel the phloem from the xylem.\nFor studies where the cambial zone is required to remain intact or promoter expression patterns are to be assessed, slice the cambial window transversely using a razor blade or other sharp blade into discs of between 0.5 and 1 mm in thickness.\nPlace processed cambial window tissues in 14 ml round bottom tubes and rinse twice in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 714. Ensure that the tissue is completely submerged, remains in solution for at least five minutes and all excess solution is removed at the end of the second rinse.\nAdd 5 ml of GUS reagent (0.5 mM X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronic acid), 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 v/v, 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide(III), 0.05 mM potassium ferrocyanide(II), made up to final volume with 0.1 mM phosphate buffer pH 7; see Hawkins et al.16) to each tube. If tissue is not completely submerged, add additional GUS reagent.\nIncubate tubes for 10 min at 55 °C in the dark.\nIncubate tubes for a further 12-16 hr on a shaker incubator at 37 °C in the dark using gentle agitation (between 30 and 60 rpm) to allow for mixing.\nUpon removal from shaker incubator randomly check the pH of GUS reagent in a small subset of tubes using litmus paper with a pH range 0-7.\n\t\nIf any of the tubes have a pH below 6 then label them. Continue to check the remainder of the tubes to confirm pH and label if pH is 6 or below.",
    "Note: Samples with a pH below 6 may not be suitable for analysis. These samples have to be excluded from further analysis.\nDecant GUS reagent and replace with sufficient 70% ethanol to cover tissue.\nStore at 4 °C until needed.\n6. Identification of Transgenic Tissue\nUsing forceps, take out all the cambial window tissue from a tube and place in small tray or petri dish to allow for microscopic visualization.\nUsing a dissecting microscope between 1X and 4X magnification, identify and tally the number of cells or tissues that have a bright blue staining. Blue stained cells or tissue are referred to as a sector from this point onwards. Tally them in the following ways.\n\t\nFor samples where the phloem has been removed (step 5.1.1), count the number of sectors in cambial tissue found on the surface of the developing xylem (cambial sector, Figure 1a).\nFor samples that have been cut into discs (step 5.1.2), count the number sectors found in the different cell or tissue types (Figure 1b, 1c, 1d). Sectors can be found in the following tissue types: the periderm (Periderm sector, Figure 1e), phloem (Phloem sector, Figure 1f), cambial tissue (Cambial sector, Figure 1g, 1h, 1I), wound parenchyma (Wound Parenchyma Sector, Figure 1j) and in tyloses (Tylose sector, Figure 1k).\n\t\t\nDuring microscopic assessment ensure that both sides of a disc have been viewed and that sectors that occur across two discs are matched so that numbers are not overestimated.\nPlace only the tissue containing sectors back into the tube containing 70% ethanol and store until needed.\nRepeat step 6.1 to 6.3 for any additional cambial windows including the positive and/or negative control.",
    "Calculate the average transformation efficiency for each sector type for each gene or promoter of interest and the controls separately by dividing the total number of sectors by the total number of 1 cm2 cambial windows to derive an Average Number of Transformation Events per cm2 of Cambium Inoculated (ATScm-2).\nProceed to step 7.2 and 8 for analysis of promoter expression patterns and step 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 for techniques to assess cell and tissue morphology in cambial tissue.\n7. Analysis of Cell and Tissue Morphology in Cambial Tissue\nNote: Below are a selection of techniques that have been used successfully for analysis of ISSA derived samples.\nAnalysis of xylem cell area, lumen area, cell wall thickness and cell wall area using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).\n\tNote: This protocol requires minimal sample preparation and allows for relatively high throughput of sector analysis relating to the morphological traits outlined.\n\t\nFrom this step onwards please ensure lab coat, eye protection and gloves are used whenever woody tissue is being handled and treated.\nIdentify a cambial sector for analysis and make an incision approximately 0.5 mm to either side of it using a single edge razor blade to create a disc (Figure 2a).\nTrim off excess xylem tissue leaving approximately 1 mm of xylem tissue to the tangential side of the sector (Figure 2b).\nCarefully cut transversely through the center of the sector using a fresh double edge razor blade (Figure 2c).\nMake two additional shallow radial incisions on the transverse plane either side of sector to demarcate the transgenic tissue (Figure 2d). As GUS staining will not penetrate deep into the tissue follow along the radial files of cells to either side of stained tissue found at the cambial surface.",
    "Attach prepared cambial sector face up to stage of an SEM pin stub mount using SEM conductive tape (Figure 2e) and keep in desiccator until needed for SEM visualization.\nRepeat steps 7.1.2 to 7.1.6 for any additional sectors including those from the negative control.\nUsing a SEM in a low vacuum mode (energy 5 kV, spot 3.0 nm), visualize and take photos of cells/tissue within the sector as well as the cells/tissue directly adjacent the sector (Figure 2f). The amount of magnification is dependent on the features of interest. For xylem fibers, 2,000X is suitable (Figure 2g).\nOnce a cambial sector has been visualized and photographs taken at an appropriate magnification, measure xylem cell/tissue morphological traits of interest using image measuring software.\nFor statistical analysis, undertake multiple pairwise analyses using paired t-tests to compare the difference between morphological measured in the transgenic sector and the adjacent non-transgenic control cells/tissue (measured within 0.5 mm from sector edge) for each sector to determine a p-value.\nRepeat step 7.1.10 for the negative control.\n\t\t\nIn cases where the positive control shows a low p-value (α <0.05), calculate the difference between the transgenic and adjacent non-transgenic cells/tissue for a morphological trait. Use this 'difference value' in an unpaired t-test to compare the effect of the gene of interest with the negative control to determine a p-value.\nHistochemical analysis of cambial cell/tissue morphology or promoter expression patterns in stem cells/tissues using light microscopy.\n\tNote: While more time consuming, this method allows for more analysis options including aspects of cambial dynamics, e.g., cambial width as well as promoter expression patterns. In addition, if unable to access a SEM, this protocol can be used as an alternative for step 7.1.",
    "Excise sector of interest using razor blade and some surrounding tissue as small blocks (no greater than 1 mm3) and place directly in 1-3 ml of 100% ethanol in a sample vial with screw cap for at least 2 days at 4 °C on a shaker. Prepare the small block in a way that will allow for the surface of interest to be accessed by a microtome.\nRepeat for any additional sectors including those from the negative control.\nRemove liquid and replace with 25% ethanol: 75% LR white mixture for 2 days maintaining conditions.\nRepeat step 7.2.3 with 50% ethanol: 50% LR white, 25% ethanol: 75% LR white and then finally twice with 100% LR white.\nPlace small block in Embedding Mold with the surface of interest aligned to short end and carefully cover with fresh LR white and polymerize as per manufacturer instructions.\nCut 5 µm sections from the surface of interest on a rotary microtome and mount on a glass slide. Use Safranin O (0.01%) staining to visualize cell wall and/or other features.\nAdd mounting media, place a cover slip and allow to set overnight.\nView under a light microscope between 100X and 600X magnification and capture image.\nCapture morphological traits from images using image measuring software.\n\t\t\nFor statistical analysis of quantitative morphological traits, follow on from step 7.1.10.\nFor qualitative analysis of morphological traits, compare and describe patterns observed for the gene or promoter of interest and the negative and/or positive control.\nAnalysis of Microfibril Angle (MFA) in Macerated Fibers Using Light Microscopy.\n\t\nExcise transgenic xylem tissue directly from a sector as well as from non-transgenic tissue adjacent to it (within 0.5 mm, Figure 2h) and place in separate 1.5 ml tubes. Repeat for any additional sectors including those from the negative control.",
    "Complete steps 7.3.3 to 7.3.5 in a fume hood.\nAdd 250 µl of hydrogen peroxide and 250 µl of glacial acetic acid to each tube.\nPlace tube in heat block at 90 °C for 2 hr in fume hood.\nRemove tissue from tubes and carefully rinse with distilled water at least twice.\nUsing a water soluble mounting media, mount tissue on a glass slide and tease apart with sharp forceps prior to affixing a cover slip.\nView under a light microscope and capture images of individual fibers at magnification greater than 400X.\nTo determine microfibril angle of fibers, measure the angle between the pit apertures and/or cell wall striations and the long axis of the fiber (Figure 2i) using image measuring software.\nFor statistical analysis, follow on from step 7.1.10.\n8. Analysis of Promoter Expression Patterns\nAnalysis of Promoter Expression Patterns in Secondary Stem Tissues.\n\t\nTally the frequency of each sector type for the promoter of interest as well as the positive and negative controls as noted in step 6.2.2.\nCompare the frequency of the different sector types for the promoter of interest with the positive control using Chi-square tests to establish p-values. Further analysis of cell/tissue specificity can be undertaken using step 7.2 as required.\n\t\t\nIf more than one promoter of interest is being investigated then repeat this analysis making comparison between all promoters of interest and the positive control.\nIf sectors or blue staining are observed in the negative control then add this to the analysis or abandon depending on extent or if endogenous staining is suspected (see Discussion).\nAnalysis of Promoter Expression Patterns During Cambial Derivative Development and Differentiation.",
    "Using a dissecting microscope, visualize all the cambial sectors (Figure 1g, 1h, 1i) identified in step 6.2 and determine the presence/absence of blue staining in three tissues types derived from the cambium; the phloem (P), developing xylem (X1) or developed xylem tissue (X2) (see Figure 3a).\nAs per step 8.1.2, compare the frequency of presence/absence of GUS staining in the P, X1 and X2 regions of promoter of interest with the positive control using Chi-square tests to establish p-values. Further analysis of cell/tissue specificity can be undertaken using step 7.2 as required.\n\t\t\nSee steps 8.1.2.1 and 8.1.2.2 for additional considerations.\nSubscription Required.
