    "Care and handling of the animals were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (USA). European and national legislation were followed carefully.\n1. Animal Preparation\nUse 132 2-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 320-450 g (120 rats for experimentation and 12 rats for blood sampling, Figure 1). Based on Dell13, 15 rats for each group was enough for a power of 0.8 (80% chance of finding statistical significance, if the specified effect exists).\nHouse all rats in classical cages under isolation conditions in a conventional facility equipped with a changing station. Instigate breeding in an IVC (individually ventilated cage) rack, with SPF (specific pathogen free) rats being specifically purchased.\nUse the following housing conditions: temperature range from 19-24 °C; relative humidity: 40-60%; ventilation: frequency of air renewal: 10-15 per h; light/dark cycle: 12 h-12 h.\nSterilize all caging equipment and use irradiated bedding. Systemically implement cage enrichment by placing sterile cardboard trays and towels inside the cages.\nAllow access to the zone under restricted conditions: new lab coat, mask, gloves, footwear, and hair bonnet at the entrance.\nCarry out colony health monitoring on sentinel animals housed on dirty bedding on an annual basis, according to the Felasa14 recommendations for conventional facilities. Keep four to five animals per cage, with the appropriate irradiated diet and provide acidified water ad libitum. Monitor daily.\nTransfer rats elected for surgical intervention in filtering top cages to the surgical rooms 2 h before surgery.\n2. Surgical Procedure\nPrepare the surgical instruments: fine scissors, a clamp, two hemostatic clamps, and a needle holder. During all the procedures, wear gloves, a mask, a hood, and a lab coat.",
    "Randomly divide the rats into two groups (PRP and saline solution).\nTake the rat out of its cage and weigh it. Use numbered ear tags to identify the rats. To avoid desiccation of the eyes, place waterdrops on the cornea.\nAnesthetize the rat intraperitoneally with xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight) and ketamine (80 mg/kg of body weight). To confirm anesthetization, place the animals under cardio-respiratory monitoring and check for any eye reflexes.\nInject 50 µL of buprenorphine subcutaneously  (0.01-0.05 mg/kg  every 8-12 h) in the neck area as a painkiller.\nShave the left hind limb with an electric shaver, disinfect it with 3 alternating scrubs of iso-betadine/alcohol (diluted 1:10) solution and place the rat on a warm pad (20 °C) under a dissecting microscope. Place the rat on lateral decubitus with the leg to be operated on in a superior position. Hold the paw with surgical forceps.\nUsing the scissors, make a small lateral incision (20-25 mm) in the skin surrounding the left Achilles tendon, and dissect the fascia using fine scissors to expose the Achilles tendon complex (Figure 2a).\nRemove the plantaris tendon with a pair of scissors (Figure 2b).\nCut the Achilles tendon transversally 5 mm proximal to its calcaneal insertion and remove a 5-mm long portion using scissors. Do not suture the tendon (Figure 2c, 2d).\nSuture the fascia and then the skin with resorbable yarn doing an overjet suture (continuous suture). Monofilament sutures can be used as well to prevent wicking from the skin into the surgical incision.\nPlace the rat under a heating lamp until awake and then place the rat back in a cage (58 x 38 cm) (Nota bene: No immobilization is imposed).\n3. PRP Preparation15",
    "Anesthetize the donor rats with xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight) and ketamine (80 mg/kg of body weight) by intraperitoneal injection. The PRP injection is carried out 2 h postoperatively without any re-anesthetic.\nInject 50 µL of buprenorphine subcutaneously as a painkiller.\nCollect whole blood (20 mL per rat, final bleeding) by cardiac puncture into sterile tubes containing 3.2% buffered sodium citrate (0.109 M, anticoagulant). Then euthanize the rat by intracardiac injection.\nTo obtain PRP, centrifuge the blood for 10 min at 150 x g and room temperature. This initial low speed centrifugation step yields two distinct phases: a lower phase consisting of red blood cells (RBCs) that accounts for about 80-90% of the total volume, and an upper phase consisting of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (typically 10-20% of the blood sample).\nGently collect the PRP (upper phase) in a secondary plastic tube using a plastic transfer pipette. As the interface between PRP and red blood cells is very loose, do not pipette too close to the interface. When handled properly, contaminating RBCs in PRP should be below 0.05 x 103 cells/µL. Discard the remaining lower phase and the primary blood collection tube.\nDetermine the volume of collected PRP and measure the platelet count on a hematology analyzer. These values are required for calculations to adjust platelet concentration in the next step. A blood cell count is also useful to evaluate potential contamination with RBCs and WBCs. Platelet concentration in PRP at this stage is typically 1 – 1.5 x106/µL.",
    "Perform a second centrifugation of the PRP for 10 min at 1,000 x g and room temperature. This high-speed centrifugation step yields a loose platelet pellet and a supernatant consisting of autologous platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Using the values determined in step 3.6, calculate the volume of supernatant to be discarded to concentrate the PRP and reach a final concentration of 2.5 x106/µL.\nGently collect the supernatant (PPP) in a secondary plastic tube using a plastic transfer pipette, leaving about two thirds of the final volume calculated in step 3.7. As the pellet is loose, a significant quantity of platelets is lost when PPP is discarded, hence potentially reducing the final desired concentration.\nCarefully resuspend the platelet pellet with the remaining supernatant by gentle repeated pipetting. Measure the platelet count on this concentrated PRP. If required, add the appropriate volume of autologous PPP to reach the final target concentration.\n\tNOTE: Use the PRP within 3 h of preparation.\nAdd 50 µL of CaCl2 (11 mEq 10 mL) per mL of PRP to activate the platelets.\nInject 50 µL of fresh PRP or saline solution with a 21G needle directly into the sutured operation site about 1 h after preparation. During this time, keep PRP at room temperature.\nMonitor the functional recovery of the rats closely during the days after surgery and before the removal of the Achilles tendon.\n4. Removal of Achilles tendon and Biomechanical Testing16\n5, 15, or 30 days later5, weigh the rat. Then, anesthetize with xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight) and ketamine (80 mg/kg of body weight) by intraperitoneal injection.\nInject 50 µL of buprenorphine subcutaneously as a painkiller. Remove the tendon before sacrificing the animal to keep the physiological conditions for as long as possible.",
    "Shave the left hind limb and place the rat under a dissecting microscope. Place the rat on lateral decubitus with the leg to be operated on in a superior position. Hold the paw with fingers.\nMake a small incision (10 mm) in the previous operation site and extend until the triceps suralis is exposed.\nTo remove the healing Achilles tendon, cut the calcaneal bone transversally 5-10 mm distal to its Achilles tendon attachment. Then dissect a part of the triceps suralis, which is attached to the Achilles tendon (Figure 3b). The muscle part has to be big enough to fit in the cryo-jaw (Figure 3c-d). Place the sample immediately into the cryo-jaw using forceps (Figure 3e).\nAfter removing the muscle-tendon-bone complex, euthanize the rat by intracardiac injection with Nembutal (200 mg/kg). Confirm death by assessing the absence of heart rhythm and respiration for 15 min.\nPlace the muscle unit into the upper jaw (Figure 3e), close it and place it vertically into a universal testing machine (106.2 kN, Figure 3a). Then fix the bone between the lower clamps of the machine (Figure 3f).\nAdd liquid nitrogen into both of the upper jaw basins to freeze the muscle, so that it is an order of magnitude stiffer than the tendon and does not deform during the tensile test.\nWhen the freezing zone reaches the metal clamp border, start the tensile test, so the tendon will preserve its structure. Set the displacement rate of the machine at a constant speed of 1 mm/s until rupture. Record the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) given in Newtons (N) on a computer.\nTo calculate the cross-sectional area, place two cameras perpendicular to each other, forming an elliptical shape, and take pictures.",
    "To account for the difference in the cross-sectional area of the healing tendons, normalize the UTS to a unit area (N per square millimeter), which represents the mechanical stress experienced by the tissue.\n5. Histological Analysis\nNOTE: 15 tendons of each group underwent histological analysis.\nAfter its removal, submerge the Achilles tendon immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde to preserve its structure (1 mm of tissue is fixed per hour, so the time of fixation varies depending on the size of the tendon).\nReplace the paraformaldehyde by 70% ethanol, and leave the sample for at least one night in this solution.\nPlace the tendon in a little plastic container with holes and place that container in a fresh 70% ethanol solution for 1 h.\nPlace the container in 95% ethanol for 1 h. Repeat.\nPlace the container in 100% ethanol for 1 h. Repeat.\nPlace the container in 100% xylene for 1 h. Repeat.\nNow place the plastic container, which contains the tendon, in liquid paraffin (56 °C) and leave it overnight.\nUsing an embedding station (equipped with molten wax, a hot plate, and a cold plate), choose a metallic mold that best fits the tissue sample, and fill it with a little liquid paraffin so that the base is covered.\n\tNOTE: Orientate the sample to obtain vertical sections at the microtome.\nWhen the sample is correctly positioned, fill up the mold with liquid paraffin and place it onto the refrigerating machine. Let it cool down for at least 15 min.\nRemove from the paraffin block and place it on ice for at least 30 min.\nPrepare several clean glass slides and put some droplets of deionized water on them.",
    "At the microtome, cut the blocks in sections of 5 µm (only use sections from the middle part of the tendon) and place the section on a slide.\nPlace the slides in a heating oven at 65 °C for several min, so that the paraffin just starts to melt to bond the tissue to the glass.\nPlace the slides containing paraffin sections in a slice holder.\nNow deparaffinize and rehydrate the tissue by placing it in the following successive baths:\n\t8 min in Xylene (Bath 1)\n\t4 min in Xylene (Bath 2)\n\t2 min in 100% ethanol\n\t2 min in 95% ethanol\n\t2 min in 70% ethanol\n\t2 min in deionized water\nFor Hematoxylin-Eosin staining, place the tissue in the following solutions.\n\t\nImmerse the tissue for 8 min in hematoxylin solution (1 g hematoxylin monohydrate, 0.2 g KIO3, 50 g AIK (SO4)2.12H2O; 200 mL glycerin; adjust to 1 L with distilled water).\nImmerse the tissue for 8 min under running tap water.\nImmerse the tissue for 30 s in eosin solution (0.25% eosin in 100 mL of distilled water containing 200 µL of undiluted acetic acid).\nImmerse the tissue for 2 min under running tap water.\nFor the Masson's Trichrome Staining, follow these steps.\n\t\nAfter rehydration, place the sections in a container with iron alum (0.5 g (NH4)Fe(SO4)2.12H2O in 10 mL H2O) and close the container. Heat it up for 3 min at 280 W in a microwave.\nLet it cool down for a minute and then rinse it with deionized water.\nPlace the sections in a closed container with Regaud's hematoxylin solution (0.5 g hematoxylin dissolved in 50 mL H2O at 50 °C, then add 5 mL 95% ethanol and 5 mL glycerin), heat it up for 90 s at 280 W.\nRinse it with deionized water.",
    "Place the sections in a picric acid solution (at saturation in methanol) for 3 min, rinse for 5 min under running tap water and then place it in deionized water for a few seconds.\nNow place the sections in acid fuchsin (0.5 g in 50 mL H2O containing 0.25 mL of undiluted acetic acid) for 5 s and rinse under running tap water until the dye disappears.\nIncubate the sections in phosphomolybdic acid solution (0.5 g in 50 mL H2O) for 5 min, place it for a few seconds in deionized water.\nPlace the sections in light green (0.5 g in 50 mL H2O containing 0.25 mL of undiluted acetic acid) solution for another 5 min and place it under running tap water until the dye disappears.\nNow dehydrate the tissue again.\n\t\nImmerse the section for 1 min in 70% ethanol.\nImmerse the section for 1 min in 95% ethanol.\nImmerse the section for 1 min in 100% ethanol.\nImmerse the section for 1 min in Xylene (Bath 1).\nImmerse the section for 1 min in Xylene (Bath 2).\nRemove the sections without removing too much xylene and put a drop of mounting medium on the sample.\nPut a coverslip on top (without provoking any bubbles) and let it harden for at least 2 h.\nHydrolyze 5 histological sections (each of a different tendon) of each group in 6 N HCl for 3 h and determine the concentration of collagen by measuring hydroxyproline as an index in 5 µm unstained sections.\nNormalize the results by the section area using the manufacturer's software.\nStain some of the sections with Light Green Stain to visualize and quantify fibrillar collagen by computer assisted analysis.",
    "Scan the sections and convert the pictures in nuances of grey using the IrfanView software. Use the software for semi-quantification (e.g., Quantity One).\n6. Molecular Evaluation\nAfter tendon rupture, which occurs during mechanical testing, take the samples, snap freeze them in liquid nitrogen, and store them at -80 °C (PRP and saline solution)17.\nUse a commercial Total RNA kit to isolate total RNA17.\nMeasure the expression of collagen (Col I and Col III), Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9), and tenomodulin (TNMD) by RT-PCR17,18.\nNormalize the expression levels of mRNA to the levels of 28S19.\nSubscription Required.
