    "1. Glass surface treatment and passivation:\nNOTE: This section includes three major steps (see Figure 1): (i) cleaning and hydrophilization, (ii) silanization, and (iii) surface passivation.\nCleaning and hydrophilization\n\t\nUse Piranha solution for glass surface cleaning.\n\t\tNOTE: Piranha solution is a mixture of 30% H2O2 and 70% H2SO4 (Table of Materials). Its prime goal is to remove organic contaminations from coverslip surfaces and expose the OH groups on the glass surface. In this manner, the glass surface becomes hydrophilic.\nPlace 10-12 #1.5 (22 mm x 22 mm) glass coverslips (Table of Materials) in a homemade polytetrafluoroethylene holder (base area: 5.5 cm x 5.5 cm). Transfer the polytetrafluoroethylene holder into a 400 mL beaker (Table of Materials), and incubate it with 300 mL of Piranha solution for 2 h. Do this step on ice and in a chemical hood.\n\t\tNOTE: The polytetrafluoroethylene pole screwed to the holder base is 12 cm long, longer than the beaker (11 cm), which allows for the safe transfer/pull-out of the holder into/from the Piranha solution. Since the Piranha solution can still be highly reactive and very hot, it is imperative to stop the reaction. The easiest way to stop the reaction is to pour the Piranha solution into (tap) water to achieve a 50x dilution (at least). The solution can then be safely discarded. Never keep the used Piranha solution in a closed glass bottle – this could end in a bottle explosion.\nTransfer the polytetrafluoroethylene holder into a clean beaker filled with fresh double-distilled water (DDW) to wash excess Piranha from the coverslips.\nTransfer the beaker into a sonication bath (Table of Materials), and sonicate at 80 Hz at full power for 10 min at 25 °C. Repeat this step two more times with fresh DDW. Use fresh DDW at each time.\nSilanization",
    "Transfer the holder into a clean beaker (400 mL) filled with 300 mL of pure methanol (Table of Materials) and then into a sonication bath (Table of Materials). Sonicate at 80 Hz at full power for 30 min at 25 °C.\nAfter sonication, transfer the holder into a silane solution prepared using 15 mL of DDW, 3.1 mL of acetic acid (Table of Materials), 340 mL of methanol, and 7.6 mL of silane ((3-Mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane) (Table of Materials). Seal the beaker with parafilm, and keep it in the fridge at 4 °C overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: The preparation and handling of the silane solution must be performed in a chemical hood. After the silanization step, put the used silane solution (waste) in a dedicated glass bottle within the chemical hood.\nOn the next day, transfer the holder into a clean beaker filled with 300 mL of pure methanol for 15 s. Then, transfer the holder into a clean beaker, not before drying the bottom of the polytetrafluoroethylene holder to remove excess methanol. Transfer the beaker to the oven (Table of Materials) to dry the glass coverslips for 5 min at 120 °C.\nSurface passivation with an inert polymer\n\t\nAchieve surface passivation by incubating the glass coverslips with an inert polymer (Table of Materials). For each experiment, take two coverslips and place them in a Petri dish coated with a parafilm layer initially cleaned with ethanol (EtOH) (DDW/EtOH: 30/70 vol/vol) (Table of Materials).\nIncubate each coverslip with 1 mL of a 4 mg·mL−1 5 kDa molecular weight methoxy polyethylene glycol maleimide (mPEG-mal, Mw = 5 kDa) (Table of Materials) in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Table of Materials) for 1 h at 22 °C.",
    "NOTE: Placing the coverslips on a hydrophobic parafilm layer confines the hydrophilic PEG polymer solution to the glass coverslip surface. The incubation time is critical for achieving optimal passivation. Use incubation times ranging between 45 min and 2 h. Above this incubation time, the glass coverslips surface can deteriorate, leading to protein adhesion and a loss of transparency.\nAt the end of the incubation process, rinse each coverslip with 5 mL of DDW, and dry with a flow of N2 (gas). Do not dry the coverslips under a vacuum. Since the coverslips must be kept wet after passivation, immediately put 1 mL of 10 mM Tris on the pegylated surfaces. Use the coverslips within 2 h.\n\t\t​NOTE: The various steps must be performed in a laminar flow chamber to prevent glass surface contamination.\n2. Protein purification\nPurify G-actin from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder using the gel filtration method24.\n\t\nActin purification takes 1 week. Keep the purified G-actin in G-buffer (5 mM Tris pH 7.8, 0.01% NaN3, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, and 1 mM DTT), and store it on ice. Use the solution within 2 weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: Replace the ice every couple of days.\nLabel the actin with a maleimide-modified fluorescent dye16 (Table of Materials). Purify the GST-fascin based on the method of Ono et al.25. Flash-freeze both proteins in liquid N2, and store at −80 °C.\nUse a standard protocol to purify myosin II from rabbit skeletal muscle26. The purified myosin II (dimers) stock buffer includes 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.5 M KCl, and 35% w/v sucrose. Flash-freeze the myosin in liquid N2, and store at −80 °C.",
    "NOTE: The high concentration of KCl keeps the myosin motors in a dimeric form, while the high percentage of sucrose assures that the activity of the motors is not hampered upon freezing. Use a dedicated pipette for viscous fluid handling when working with myosin II stock solutions (Table of Materials).\n\t\nLabel the myosin II dimers with a fluorescent dye (Table of Materials) at pairs of engineered cysteine residues19,27. Use a chicken gizzard RLC mutant A for that purpose26. Flash-freeze the labeled myosin II in liquid N2, and store at −80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: This labeling procedure assures that the labeled myosin is active as the native myosin II protein.\nUse a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Table of Materials) to measure the absorbance of the stock protein solutions, and deduce the protein concentrations with the Beer-Lambert law using the following extinction coefficients: G-actin (ε290 = 26,460 M−1·cm−1), GST-fascin (ε280 = 99,330 M−1·cm−1), myosin II dimer (ε280 = 268,800 M−1·cm−1), and RLC mutant A (ε280 = 3,960 M−1·cm−1)19.\n3. Sample preparation\nNOTE: Polymerize the actin monomers in the presence of large aggregates of myosin II motors and the strong passive crosslinker fascin to produce macroscopically contractile elastic actomyosin networks19,23. Adding fluorescent beads to the solution allows for tracking the solvent flow during gel contraction.\nProtein (\"actomyosin\") solution\n\t\nExcept for G-actin, keep the proteins at −80°C in small aliquots, and thaw them at 37 °C before use. The actomyosin solution's total volume is 40 µL.",
    "Prepare the solution by mixing 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM ATP, an ATP regenerating system (0.5 mg·mL−1 creatine kinase and 5 mM creatine phosphate), 200 µM EGTA (chelates Ca2+ ions), an anti-bleaching solution (0.1 mg·mL−1 glucose oxidase, 0.018 mg·mL−1 catalase, and 5 mg·mL−1 glucose), 5 µM G-actin, 280 nM GST-fascin, and 1.67 nM myosin II. The percentage of labeled G-actin is 5% (molar percentage).\n\t\tNOTE: Use a low percentage of labeled G-actin to avoid the saturation of the fluorescent signal at the advanced stages of gel contraction.\nPreparing myosin II motor aggregates\n\t\nAdd the myosin motors to the protein solution in the form of aggregates. To form large myosin aggregates (150 myosin dimers/aggregate), dilute the myosin stock solution with 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 to reach a final concentration of 25 mM KCl.\nKeep the diluted myosin solution for 10 min at room temperature (RT), and then transfer it to ice until use. The motors are fully active for up to 2 h.\nMeasuring the solvent flow\n\t\nTo track the solvent flow across the gel pores, add the fluorescent beads to the actomyosin solution. Reduce the interaction between the beads and the actomyosin network by passivating the beads. Practically, incubate 1 µL of beads (Table of Materials) with 5 µM G-actin for 20 min at RT, and then remove excess G-actin by centrifugation (Table of Materials) (conditions: 6,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C).\nRepeat this step with 10 mg·mL−1 bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Table of Materials) to block (possibly) the remaining uncoated surface. Use the beads at a final dilution of 1:10,000 vol/vol in the experiments.",
    "NOTE: It is important to adapt the beads' diameter to the gel pore size such that the bead/pore size ratio is <1 at all stages.\nEffect of solution viscosity\n\t\nControl the viscosity of the solution by adding glycerol (Table of Materials) to the actomyosin solution. Adding glycerol at a weight percent ranging from 0% to 34% induces a corresponding increase in the solution viscosity from ηω to 2.76 ηω, where ηω is the viscosity of water at 20 °C28.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is essential to use a dedicated pipette for viscous fluid handling when working with glycerol (Table of Materials).\n4. Running an experiment\nHomemade sample holder handling\n\t\nTake one of the PEG-passivated coverslips, place a greased parafilm spacer on top of it, and place it in the sample holder.\n\t\tNOTE: One can replace the parafilm spacer with any spacer.\nPreparing the actomyosin solution\n\t\nPrepare the actomyosin solution on ice in a microcentrifuge tube by incorporating the various microscopic constituents, adding the myosin II motor aggregates, and adding EGTA last. Mix the solution well. The addition of EGTA initiates actomyosin network polymerization, which sets the starting time of the experiment.\nPut 1.1 µL of that solution on the holder-mounted coverslip, and place the second coverslip on top. Screw the holder to seal the sample. This process slightly squeezes the drop, which adopts a disc-like shape. The drop diameters range between 2,800-3,000 µm.\nPlace the sample holder on the microscope, and start the acquisition. Prepare the microscope in advance to reduce the initial acquisition time. It typically takes 1-2 min after mixing to start the sample imaging.\n5. Microscopy techniques\nImage the samples using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Table of Materials) controlled by dedicated software (Table of Materials).",
    "Use low magnifications of 2.5x/0.075 Plan-NEOFLUAR objective (Table of Materials) to visualize the whole gel area and follow its macroscopic contraction with time.\nUse a 10x/0.3 Ph1 UPlanFL objective (Table of Materials) to characterize the network porosity and structure and to follow the network self-organization and contraction with time.\n\t\tNOTE: This objective is also useful for localizing the myosin II motor aggregates within the network and following the movement of fluorescent beads across the gel pores. Higher magnifications can be used at the expense of a reduced field of view, which is even more significant in dual-color imaging mode (Table of Materials).\nExcite the samples at 488 nm (actin/fluorescent beads) and 561 nm (myosin motor aggregates/fluorescent beads). Acquire the images at 100 ms per frame with dedicated software (Table of Materials) in streaming mode with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The fluorescent lamp (Table of Materials) intensity should be kept at the lowest possible value to avoid signal saturation during network contraction.\nSimultaneous two-color imaging\n\t\nUse this mode for two purposes: (i) detecting the localization of the myosin motor aggregates within the actin network, and (i) characterizing the outward solvent flow inside and outside during network contraction.\nExcite the actin and myosin II motors at 488 nm and 561 nm, respectively, and record the images simultaneously on an EMCCD camera (Table of Materials) using a dual-emission apparatus (Table of Materials). Use the same imaging system to simultaneously image the actin gel (488 nm) and the fluorescent beads (561 nm).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
