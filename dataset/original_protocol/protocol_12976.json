    "1. DNA Extraction\nNote: Use a separate room for DNA extraction and post-PCR examinations such as gel electrophoresis and LC/ESI-MS. Add ethanol to wash buffer 1 (containing guanidine hydrochloride) and wash buffer 2 (not containing guanidine hydrochloride) according to the DNA extraction kit protocol. Fish samples were obtained from fish wholesalers and retail markets in Japan.\nPlace 30-50 mg of fish tissue in a 0.5 ml or 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Squash the tissue using a micro-spatula (except for fin and skin).\n\tNote: In the case of fin, use a 0.5 ml tube for soaking.\nAdd 180 µl of the lysis buffer and 40 µl of proteinase K and vortex briefly. Incubate at 56 °C on a block heater for 2 hr or overnight. Mix by briefly vortexing every 15 min during the incubation.\n\tNote: Complete lysis is not necessary.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 13,000 x g. After centrifugation, if a small amount of oil exists on the surface in the case of a fatty sample such as liver, discard it. Transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 200 µl of the chaotropic buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride and mix by vortexing. Add 200 µl of ethanol (99.5%) and mix by vortexing again.\nTransfer the mixture into the spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube. Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 x g. Discard the flow-through.\n\tCaution: Do not add bleach to the waste because guanidine can form highly reactive compounds with bleach.\nAdd 500 µl of the wash buffer 1 (containing guanidine hydrochloride) and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 x g. Discard the flow through and the collection tube.",
    "Place the spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube provided with the kit. Add 500 µl of the wash buffer 2 and centrifuge for 3 min at 20,000 x g. Discard the flow-through and the collection tube. Transfer the spin column to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nPipet 200 µl of the elution buffer to the center of the spin column membrane. After 1 min, centrifuge for 1 min at 6,000 x g.\nPipet 50 µl of the eluate to a disposable UV cuvette and measure the UV spectrum of the eluate at 220-300 nm and the absorbance at 260 nm using a spectrophotometer.\nVerify the UV spectrum of DNA with the peak at 260 nm. Calculate the approximate DNA concentration using the simple equation \"DNA concentration (ng/µl) = absorbance at 260 nm x 50\".\n\tNote: Typical DNA concentration extracted from the fins of pufferfish is 63 ± 30 ng/µl (n = 20).\nIf the DNA concentration is higher than 10 ng/µl, dilute the DNA samples with Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (pH 8) to 5 ng/µl.\nStore the sample at −20 °C or proceed to PCR amplification (section 2).\n2. PCR\nSet up 25 µl PCR for each extracted DNA sample, positive control (0.2 µM synthesized oligonucleotide having the target sequence in TE buffer pH 8.0) and negative control (ultrapurified water instead of DNA sample) on ice as per Tables 1 and 2 on a clean bench to avoid contamination.\n\tNote: For easy operation, make sufficient amount of cocktail containing all reagents without template DNA and dispense it. Use DNA polymerase having proofreading activity to avoid the addition of 3' A overhangs to the PCR product.\nCarry out PCR amplification on a thermal cycler using the cycle program shown in Table 3.\n3. Enzymatic Digestion",
    "Add 2 µl of the solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 500 mM NaCl to the PCR solution.\nAdd 1 µl of each restriction enzyme (Dra I and Msp I) and mix gently. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C on the thermal cycler.\nIncubate for 5 min at 72 °C to activate the remaining DNA polymerase, which fills the sticky end generated by Msp I.\nOptional: Analyze each 2.5 µl of the reaction solution by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a cross link ratio (%C, percentage of bisacrylamide) of 3.33 (wt %) and a polyacrylamide gel concentration (%T) of 15 (% w/v)38. Stain the gel using the fluorescent DNA stain and observe double-strand DNA on a blue light transilluminator using an amber screen.\nFilter the reaction solution with a 0.2-0.5 µm centrifugal filter device to prevent clogging, which would damage the analytical column.\nTransfer the filtrate to a tapered polypropylene vial and store at -20 °C until analysis.\n4. LC/ESI-MS Analysis\nWeigh 67.2 g (ca. 42 ml) of HFIP and 1.52 g (ca. 2.0 ml) of TEA in a 1 L bottle. Add 955 ml of ultrapurified water (LC/MS grade) and stir using a magnetic stirrer until the reagents are completely dissolved. Take an aliquot of the solution and check the pH (between 7.85 and 7.95; ideally pH = 7.9) using a pH meter.\n\tNote: Do not return the aliquot to the bottle to avoid contamination by metal ions. If the pH is not 7.9, add a small amount of either HFIP or TEA to adjust the pH and measure the pH again.",
    "Connect the bottle to line A of the liquid chromatograph with cooling of the bottle using a direct cooling portable refrigerator (for household use) to prevent vaporization. Connect another bottle filled with methanol to line B.\nConnect the guard column and the analytical column (2.0 x 50 mm, mesopore size = 30 nm) to the liquid chromatograph. Start flowing the initial mobile phase (95% A and 5% B) to equilibrate the columns.\nPrepare 0.5 mg/ml sodium trifluoroacetate (pH 3.5) as a calibrant39.\n\t\nWeigh 50 mg (ca. 34 µl) of trifluoroacetic acid in a beaker.\nAdd 30 ml of ultrapurified water and titrate to pH 3.5 with 10 mM sodium hydroxide with the aid of a pH meter.\nFill up to 50 ml with ultrapurified water. Add 50 ml of acetonitrile (LC/MS grade) and mix.\nTake a portion of the working solution and store it at room temperature. Store the rest of the solution at 4 °C.\nReduce the nitrogen pressure of the C-trap as follows.\n\tNote: Recent Fourier transform mass spectrometers, which are suitable for intact protein analysis, have control software to control pressure.\n\t\nRemove the left top cover of the mass spectrometer. The C-trap valve is at the corner of the left foreground.\nCheck high vacuum pressure value in the instrument status window of the control software.\n\t\tNote: The value is typically, 3 x 10−8 bar.\nPull the knob to unlock and turn the knob anticlockwise very slowly to reduce the high vacuum pressure to 1/3 (typically, 1 x 10−8 bar). The indicated pressure should change gradually in a delayed manner. Ignore the warning message about low pressure. Push the knob to lock.\nRestore the top cover for safety.\nCalibrate the mass spectrometer using sodium trifluoroacetate39.",
    "Note: Daily mass calibration can be replaced by this protocol, however, the recommended calibration suggested by the manufacturer should have been completed prior to this calibration.\n\t\nSet scan parameters and heated ESI source parameters in the instrument control box of the tuning software as follows: scan type full MS; scan range m/z 500-4,000; fragmentation (in-source collision induced dissociation (CID) voltage 60 eV; polarity negative; auto gain control (AGC) target 1 x 106, maximum inject time 50 msec; sheath gas flow rate 5; aux gas flow rate 0; sweep gas flow rate 0; spray voltage 3 kV; capillary temperature 320 °C; S-lens radiofrequency (RF) level 100; heater temperature 30 °C.\n\t\t\nInput the list of negative ions to be monitored as m/z 792.85908, 1064.80870, 1336.75832, 1608.70794, 1880.65755, 2152.60717, 2424.55679, 2696.50640, 2968.45602, 3376.38045.\nMove the heated ESI probe closer to the interface of the mass spectrometer (position B). Connect the probe and a syringe with a tube.\nInfuse the calibrant constantly at a flow rate of 10 µl/min using the embedded syringe pump. Check only the 6 lower mass ions (m/z 792.85908-2152.60717) in the customized calibration table.\n\t\t\nProceed with calibration after the intensity of the signals are stabilized. After the calibration, check only the six higher mass ions (m/z 1880.65755-3376.38045) and proceed with calibration. Avoid calibrating using all ions at once to avoid failure.\nMove the probe to the appropriate position for a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min (position D) and connect to the liquid chromatograph with an inert metal tube.\nSet the heated ESI source parameters in the instrument control box of the tuning software as follows: sheath gas flow rate 50; aux gas flow rate 15; sweep gas flow rate 1; spray voltage 2.5 kV; capillary temperature 350 °C; S-lens RF level 100; heater temperature 350 °C.",
    "Set acquisition parameters of the mass spectrometer in the instrumental setup window as follows: method duration 8 min; divert valve, 3.5-6 min to mass spectrometer, 0-3.5 and 6-8 min to waste; runtime 3.5 to 6 min; polarity negative; in source CID voltage 15.0 eV; microscans 3; nominal resolution power (at m/z 200) 140,000; AGC target 1 x 106; maximum ion time 50 msec; number of scans 1; scan range m/z 700-3,500; spectrum data type profile.\nSet parameters of liquid chromatograph as follows: column oven temperature 20 °C; sample tray temperature 10 °C; gradient program 0-0.5 min 5% B, 0.5-1 min 5-30% B, 1-3.5 min 30-40% B, 3.5-5 min 40-98% B, 5-6 min 98% B, 6-6.05 min 98-5% B, 6.05-8 min 5% B; flow rate 0.4 ml/min.\nPurge bubbles by tapping the bottoms of the vials. Set sample vials on the sample rack and inject 1.0 µl of a sample using the autosampler to start analysis.\nOpen raw data files with the browser software and confirm that all the acquisitions are successfully finished, including the positive and negative controls.\n\tNote: Typically, two or three peaks would be observed in the total ion current chromatogram at a retention time of 4-5.5 min when pufferfish DNA is successfully amplified and digested.\n5. Deconvolution and Interpretation\nStart the deconvolution software. Select experiment type \"auto extract (isotopically resolved)\".\nEdit a method using the following parameters: output mass M; S/N threshold 3, relative abundance threshold 0; negative charge yes; calculate extracted ion current chromatogram (XIC) yes; m/z range 700-3,500; charge carrier H+; minimum number of detected charge 3; isotope ratio nucleotide; fit factor 80%; remainder threshold 0%; consider overlaps yes; charge range 3-50; minimum intensity 1; expected intensity error 3.\n\t\nSave as a new method and select it.",
