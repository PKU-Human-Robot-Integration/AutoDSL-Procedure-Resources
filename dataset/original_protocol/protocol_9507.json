  "procedures": [
    "1. Preparation of the Aptamer Working Stock\nFollow the manufacturer's instructions and dissolve the oligonucleotide (5-Cy5-CCTG GGGGAGTATTGCGGAGGAAGG-3, sequence from reference18) in water, reaching a 100-µM final concentration.\nPrepare the aptamer working solution by diluting the oligonucleotide stock to 200 nM with binding buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6; 300 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 0.01% Tween20).\nIncubate the mixture for 2 min at 90 °C, let the sample immediately cool down on ice, and use the sample at room temperature.\n2. Preparation of the Ligand Dilution Series\nFor each ligand (adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenine, guanosine triphosphate (GTP), cytosine triphosphate (CTP), deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM); 10 mM stock each), prepare a 16-step serial dilution in 200 µl micro reaction tubes.\n\tNOTE: Centrifugation of ligand stocks for 5 min at 14,000 x g may help to remove aggregates. Low volume, low binding reaction tubes are recommended to avoid adsorption of molecules to the tube walls.\nStart with a maximum concentration of at least 50 times higher than the estimated affinity and reduce the ligand concentration by 50% in each dilution step.\n\tNOTE: The concentration finder tool implemented in the control software simulates binding data and helps with finding the right concentration range for the dilution series.\nFill 20 µl of the ligand stock (10 mM) in tube 1. Add 10 µl of aptamer binding buffer into micro reaction tubes 2 to 16.\nTransfer 10 µl of tube 1 to tube 2 and mix properly by pipetting up and down several times. Transfer 10 µL to the next tube and repeat this dilution for the remaining tubes.\nDiscard the 10 µl excess from the last tube. Avoid any buffer dilution effects. The buffer in tube 1 and in tubes 2-16 must be identical.",
    "3. Preparation of the Final Reaction Mix\nPrepare the individual binding reactions with a volume of 20 µl (10 µl of aptamer working solution + 10 µl of the respective ligand dilution) to minimize pipetting errors. A volume of only 4 µl is sufﬁcient to ﬁll the capillary.\nAdd 10 µl of the 200 nM aptamer working solution to 10 µl of each ligand dilution and mix properly by pipetting up and down several times.\nIncubate the samples for 5 min at room temperature and ﬁll the samples into standard capillaries by dipping the capillaries into the sample. Longer incubation times may be necessary for some interactions; however, 5 min is adequate for most. Touch the capillaries only on the sides, NOT on the middle part, where the optical measurement will be taken.\nPlace the capillaries onto the capillary tray and start the MST device.\n4. Starting the MST Device\nNOTE: The device provides two pre-installed software packages, the ''control\" software for the technical setup of the experimental conditions and the ''analysis\" software for the interpretation of the produced data.\nBefore placing the capillary tray into the MST device, start the control software and adjust the overall desired temperature by selecting ''enable manual temperature control\" in the ''temperature control\" dropdown menu. Adjust the temperature to 25 °C in this way.\n\tNOTE: The MST instruments can be temperature-controlled from 22 to 45 °C.\nWait for the temperature to reach the expected level and then place the capillary tray into the MST device.\nSet the LED channel to ''red\" for Cy5 dyes and adjust the LED power to gain a ﬂuorescence signal of 300 to 1,000 fluorescence units at the MST device with a standard sensor. 25% LED power is used in this study.",
    "NOTE: 6,000 to 18,000 fluorescence units are recommended for the MST with a high-sensitivity sensor.\n5. Capillary Scan\nCarry out a capillary scan to check different quality aspects of the sample by choosing the capillary position on the \"control\" software and clicking on \"start cap scan\" before starting the MST measurement.\nInspect the capillary scan for fluorescence enhancement/quenching and sticking effects (U-shaped or flattened peaks) in the software.\n\tNOTE: More details on the detection and handling of fluorescence and sticking effects can be found in the discussion.\n6. MST Measurement\nNOTE: Before starting the MST measurement, make sure to exclude sticking effects, enhancement/quenching effects, or pipetting errors, and ensure that the capillary scan indicates that the ﬂuorescence signal is sufﬁcient. For more details, see the discussion.\nAssign the ligand concentrations from the dilution series to the respective capillary position in the ''control\" software. Consider the dilution step of mixing the aptamer and ligand (1:1).\nEnter the highest concentration of ligand (5 mM) for capillary #1, select the correct dilution type (here, 1:1), click on the maximum concentration, and use the drag function to automatically assign the remaining concentrations in capillaries #2-16. The lowest concentration is 152.6 nM.\nEnter the concentration of the ﬂuorescent aptamer (here, 100 nM) in the respective section of the control software.\nUse the default settings, which detect the ﬂuorescence for 5 sec, record the MST for 30 sec, and record the fluorescence for a further 5 sec after the inactivation of the laser to monitor the back diffusion of molecules.\nAdjust the laser power to 20% in the respective section of the control software.",
    "NOTE: In order to receive the best signal-to-noise ratio and to avoid unspecific effects, a laser power of 20-40% is recommended. In specific cases, a higher laser power may be required to get a good separation of unbound and bound molecules.\nSave the experiment after selecting the destination folder and start the MST measurement by pressing the ''Start MST measurement\" button.\n\tNOTE: The .ntp file will be generated in the destination folder. Using this setup, one measurement lasts 10-15 min.\nRepeat the experimental procedure at least twice for a more accurate determination of the EC50 value.\n\tNOTE: In order to test the technical reproducibility, the same capillaries can be scanned several times (technical repeats).\n7. MST Data Analysis\nNOTE: The analysis software enables the analysis of data on the ﬂy during the measurement. The analysis software plots the MST time traces and changes in the normalized ﬂuorescence (Fnorm) versus the ligand concentration37.\nStart the MST analysis software (MO.Affinity Analysis) and load the .ntp file from the destination folder. Select \"MST\" as the analysis type in the data selection menu.\n\tNOTE: In case of ligand-dependent fluorescence effects, the initial fluorescence can be chosen for analysis.\nAdd the respective technical or biological run(s) to a new analysis by drag-and-drop or by pressing the \"+\" button below the respective experimental run.\nPress the information button below the respective experimental run to obtain information on the properties of the experiment, MST traces, capillary scan, capillary shape, initial fluorescence, and bleaching rate.\n\tNOTE: These raw data can also be inspected in later steps of the analysis.\nVisually inspect the MST traces for aggregation and precipitation effects, visible as bumps and spikes.\n\tNOTE: For more information on the detection and handling of aggregation effects, read the discussion.",
    "Visually inspect the capillary scan and the capillary shape overlay for adsorption effects, visible as flattened or U-shaped peaks. Visually inspect the capillary scan and the initial fluorescence for fluorescence effects. Visually inspect the bleaching rate for photobleaching effects.\nSwitch to the dose-response mode and change the analysis setting to \"expert\" mode by pressing the respective button. Select \"T-Jump\" as the MST evaluation strategy.\nSelect the \"Hill\" model for curve ﬁtting. The binding parameters will automatically be calculated. Normalize the data by choosing the respective type of normalization in the \"compare results\" menu. Export the data either as an .xls or .pdf.\n\tNOTE: The table below the binding graph summarizes the calculated binding parameters.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
