    "Autoclave\nAssemble and autoclave the tubing for the flow system and bioreactor components (bioreactor itself and the silicone stopper lid) as instructed in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Feeding tube has a male connector on one end and an open end on the other side. Three short tubing segments are inserted through a silicone cap for gas exchange.\n1. Sewing PGA Mesh\nCut PGA mesh to 1.1cm x ~8cm sheet (dependent on bioreactor size).\nClean silicone tubing (3mm inner diameter) with distilled water (dH20) and air dry before usage.\nUse Dexon 6.0 suture to sew PGA mesh around the clean silicone tubing starting with three surgical knots followed by single stitches.\n2. PGA Scaffolds Surface Treatment\nDip PGA scaffolds in 1M NaOH for 1-2min and record the treatment time and use the same time for all PGA scaffolds.\nRinse PGA scaffolds in dH2O baths for 2 minutes 3 times.\nPat PGA scaffolds dry with Kimwipes between each dip in dH2O baths.\nDry PGA scaffolds under tissue culture hood to air dry for 15 minutes with blower on.\n3. Sewing Dacron arms\nUse Prolene 4.0 suture to sew small pieces of Dacron cuffs (1cm) onto each end of the PGA mesh with an overlap of 2-3mm. Note: be careful not to puncture silicone tubing (Figure 3).\nUse the same suture to sew three stitches around the free end of Dacron cuffs. Make sure to leave enough sutures at the free ends of Prolene suture for step 5.1 (Figure 3). \n4. Assembly of Bioreactor (Day before beginning of bioreactor culture)\nSoak sewn mesh and silicone tubing, surgical instruments, and a thin wire in a 70% ethanol bath for 20-30 minutes.",
    "Open the autoclave pouches containing the bioreactor and submerge it in 70% ethanol bath for at least 30 minutes prior to assembling. Make sure to flush the bioreactor thoroughly with ethanol. Exposure of all bioreactor components to 70% ethanol is an addition sterilization step. This step also removes endotoxin, which is not removed by autoclaving and is deleterious to the vascular cells.\nPull silicone tubing through side-arms using thin wire to pull it through.\nTake bioreactor out of ethanol bath (keep mesh submerged in ethanol). Fix the PGA scaffold inside the bioreactor by fastening Dacron cuffs over the flared glass lips by tightening and tying down the Prolene sutures (Figure 3).\nConnect one side of bioreactor side arms to connectors via silicone tubing.\nPull other side of silicone tubing with enough tension and insert the remaining two connectors into silicone tubing. Hold on to silicone tubing tightly when inserting connectors!\nReinsert bioreactor into ethanol bath and flush with ethanol by gently pulling connectors out of the side arms.\nFlip bioreactor over and allow a soak for 10 minutes.\nFlip bioreactor right-side up and soak for an additional 10 minutes.\nDrain all ethanol.\nSet up three large petri dishes (10 cm) in series and place bioreactor in the center dish to hold the excess ethanol dripped from the ends of the tubes.\nFlush bioreactor and PGA mesh with tissue culture water using a 5ml or 10ml pipette. Also flush tissue culture water into silicone tubing.\nThoroughly drain all excess water into petri dishes on either side of the bioreactor.\nDry bioreactor overnight in hood with blower on and UV OFF.",
    "Additional Notes: make sure sterile stir bar is in bioreactor. Make sure not to \"hover\" over the bioreactor from this point forward, to avoid contamination.  Cut up plenty of parafilm strips and soak them in a small 70% ethanol bath (large petri dish works well).\n5. Day 1: Bioreactor Setup \nPlace a sterile petri dish over opening of each bioreactor to protect the PGA scaffold inside from contaminants.\nAssemble flow system to bioreactor as indicated in Figure 4 and parafilm all the connection joints.\n\t\t\nWipe connectors first with alcohol wipes.\nAttach injection port to third, unused arm of bioreactor.\nRemove walrus tubing and tie off blue end of saline dilution set as close to Y-junction as possible. Pull tube clamp in place to ensure no liquid transfer to this part of the tube\nRemove IV bag, & attach walrus tubing (red) to far end of IV bag. Make sure to wipe insertion port with alcohol wipe first.\nAttach walrus to one side of flow system (via white end tube). \nInsert 3-way stopcock into flow system.\nRemove pressure transducer & connect to three-way stopcock.\nAttach other end of pressure transducer to middle opening in bag.\nConnect the bioreactor to the flow system via the Y-junction. Use a 60ml syringe to add 350ml of 1% fungizone (mix 5ml fungizone with 495ml of PBS) to IV bag.\nSqueeze IV bag to flush the flowing system by adjusting the stop cocks to allow flow of PBS. Note: check inside bioreactor to ensure there is no leaking.\nRe-suspend 8 x106 SMCs (about one confluent T75) in 1.25ml of medium and seed onto each PGA scafffold. Make sure cell suspension has been uniformly dripped onto the PGA mesh-Dacron junction as well as onto the bottom side of PGA mesh.",
    "Wipe rim of bioreactor with alcohol wipe via rotating the bioreactor sideways avoid hovering.\nSilicone stopper lid assembly (Figure 2)\n\t\t\nPeel autoclave bag back carefully, making sure not to expose bottom of lid.\nAttach injection port to feeding tube at the male connector.\nAttach PTFE 0.20 μm filters to each of the three air ports. \nBe careful not to expose/touch bottom of lid during this process.\nParafilm the injection port.\nInsert the silicone stopper lid into glass bioreactor and make sure that the feeding tube inside the bioreactor does not touch the seeded PGA scaffolds. Parafilm around the lid. \nPlace bioreactor with the flow system inside the incubator (on its side) and rotate the bioreactor every 5 minutes for 25-30 minutes.\nFill the bioreactor chamber with 400ml of our 4-10 culture media as described in (Table 1). This culture medium is \"optimized\" for porcine engineered arteries.\n6. Day 6-7: Turning on the Pump, and First Feeding\nGrow the seeded scaffolds statically without any pulsatile pumping through the silicone tubing for 6-7 days. There is no need for medium change or vitamin C supplementation during this time.\nMake sure there are no leaks of PBS or kinking of flow system tubing before turning on the pump.\nTurn on the pump of the flow system and make sure to adjust pump setting so that the pressure reads approximately 270/-30mmHg.\nRecord pressures daily throughout culture and maintain the pressure at 270/-30mmHg. Pressure transducer can be connected to a computer to read and monitor the pressure.\nFirst Feeding\nAssemble injection port & PTFE filter onto feeding lids for both medium change and medium waste deposal purposes.",
    "Place the feeding tube firmly on the pump and insert one end to feeding port of the bioreactor and the other end to the feeding lid. Make sure to wipe the injection ports with ethanol wipes.\nUse a dual-directional Masterflex pump to pump out 200ml of medium. Then use a new feeding tube to pump 200ml of fresh medium back into the bioreactor. Always start with a very slow speed, especially when pumping medium back to the bioreactor.\nChange medium and supplement ascorbic acid 2x/week. To add ascorbic acid, use a 30ml syringe to take out 25ml of medium and place it aside in the tissue hood. Dissolve 25mg of ascorbic acid in 5ml of PBS and filter it through a 0.22 μm filter. First inject the sterile ascorbic acid into the feeding tube and add back the 25ml medium taken out earlier. The medium recipe is given in Table 1.\n7.\tRepresentative Results:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2646/2646fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
