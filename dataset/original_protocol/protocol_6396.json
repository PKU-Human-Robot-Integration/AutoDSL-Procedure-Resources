    "Collect cellsGrow your cell line of interest to 80% confluency.Note: For mouse embryonic stem cells, we typically start with two 150-mm confluent tissue culture plates (~30 x 106-40 x 106 total cells). The amount of plates to use will depend on how many cells you can obtain from each plate (e.g., mouse embryonic stem cells grow in 3D colonies and thus give a very good yield) and on the cellular abundance of the protein to be immunoprecipitated. For adherent cells:Aspirate media.Wash twice with ice-cold 1x PBS:Pour enough PBS onto the plate to cover it and swirl it around to remove media residues.Aspirate the PBS or simply invert the plate to discard it.Transfer the plate(s) on ice.Note: From now on, keep samples and buffers in ice all the time, unless otherwise specified. Scrape cells with ice-cold 1x PBS added of PMSF, benzamidine and aprotinin (use protease inhibitors’ stock solutions as 1,000x). We typically use 3-4 ml of PBS per 150-mm plate.Transfer scraped cells to 15 ml conical tubes (or 50 ml if the final volume exceeds 12 ml).Collect all the remaining cells by washing the scraped plate(s) with another 3-4 ml of 1x PBS with protease inhibitors and transfer to the same 15 ml conical tube(s).Pellet cells in a refrigerated table-top centrifuge at 4 °C and 300 x g for 10 min.Aspirate the supernatant and flash-freeze cell pellets in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until ready to proceed.For cells growing in suspension:Transfer cells from the culture vessel to a 50 ml conical tube; wash the culture vessel once with 1x PBS to collect all the remaining cells.Pellet cells in a table-top centrifuge at 25 °C and 300 x g for 5 min.Transfer the cell pellet on ice.",
    "Wash once with 40 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS:Resuspend the pellet in PBS.Pellet in a refrigerated table-top centrifuge at 4 °C and 300 x g for 10 min.Resuspend the pellet in 20 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS added of PMSF, benzamidine and aprotinin.Pellet cells in a refrigerated table-top centrifuge at 4 °C and 300 x g for 10 min.Aspirate the supernatant and flash-freeze cell pellets in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until ready to proceed.Turn on the Covaris sonicator and set at 4 °CNote: It takes ~30-45 min for the sonicator to complete degassing and cool down.Lyse nuclei (all volumes refer to 2x 150-mm plates, or 30-40 million cells)Prepare the cell lysis buffer (see Recipe B1; 700 μl for 2x 150-mm plates, or 30-40 million cells), adding protease inhibitors (PMSF, aprotinin, benzamidine, and the Roche complete inhibitors–50x stock) and Triton X-100 to 0.1% final concentration (use the 10% stock solution as 100x).Resuspend each pellet in 700 μl of the freshly prepared cell lysis buffer using a P1000 pipet.Transfer the lysate to low-retention 1.5-ml tubes and rock at 4 °C for 8 min to allow lysis (e.g., using a rotator in the cold room).Spin in a refrigerated microfuge at 4 °C and 3,000 x g for 3 min.Optional: keep the supernatant as the “cytoplasmic fraction”.Note: This protocol is specifically optimized for nuclear proteins, but you can also perform the self-CoIP on the cytoplasmic fraction. Remove the supernatant with a P1000 first, and then with a P200, without disturbing the nuclear pellet.Prepare the 0.1 M CoIP buffer (see Recipe B2; 700 μl for 2x 150-mm plates, or 30-40 million cells), adding protease inhibitors (PMSF, aprotinin, benzamidine, and the Roche complete inhibitors–50x stock).Resuspend each nuclear pellet in 700 μl of 0.1 M CoIP buffer.",
    "Note: If you are not interested in performing a nuclease digestion, resuspend the nuclear pellet directly in 0.2 M CoIP buffer, sonicate the lysate and jump from Steps C10 to C17. Transfer the resuspended nuclei to 12 x 24-mm Covaris tubes.Sonicate each sample (Peak power: 100 W, Cycles/burst: 200, Duty Factor: 20, 8 repeats of 20 seconds of treatment followed by a 40-s delay).Measure the samples’ volume while transferring them back to a 1.5-ml low retention tube.Bring the volume to 2 ml with 0.1 M CoIP buffer plus protease inhibitors.Equally divide the sample to two tubes, 1 ml to be left untreated and 1 ml to treat with Benzonase (1 μl per ml of lysate).Note: Benzonase digests both DNA and RNA, and thus will tell you whether the self-interaction is mostly mediated by protein-protein interactions or it requires nucleic acids. If the self-association is dependent on nucleic acids, you can test whether RNA or DNA are involved replacing benzonase with either RNaseI or DNaseI (you will need to adjust the digestion buffer for DNaseI). Rock at 4 °C for 3 to 4 h to achieve complete Benzonase digestion.Spin briefly in a refrigerated microfuge at 4 °C to pull liquid down.Add 5 M NaCl to bring the final salt concentration to 0.2 M (i.e., 20.4 μl per 1 ml of lysate) and immediately invert the tubes.Rock at 4 °C for 30 min to allow complete nuclear lysis.Spin in a refrigerated microfuge at 4 °C and at maximum speed for 20 min.Transfer supernatants to new low-retention 1.5-ml tubes and quantify by Bradford assay.Quantify nuclear lysatesTurn on the UV/VIS spectrophotometer.Prepare enough Bradford reagent to quantify all your lysates plus 6 additional samples to prepare a BSA standard curve (blank, 2.5 μg, 5 μg, 7.5 μg, 12 μg).",
    "You will need 1 ml of Bradford per sample (dilute the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent 1:5 in ddH2O).Prepare your BSA standard, adding 47.5 μl of 0.2 M CoIP buffer to 2.5 μl of 20 mg/ml BSA (NEB). This will give you a 1 μg/μl BSA solution.Aliquot the Bradford reagent to 1.5-ml tubes as follows:1 ml (blank)997.5 μl Bradford + 2.5 μl BSA (2.5-μg standard)995 μl Bradford + 5 μl BSA (5-μg standard)992.5 μl Bradford + 7.5 μl BSA (7.5-μg standard)988 μl Bradford + 12 μl BSA (12-μg standard)998 μl Bradford + 2 μl sample #1/untreated998 μl Bradford + 2 μl sample #1/BenzonaseFor as many samples as you need to quantify.Mix by inverting each tube right after adding BSA/lysate.Pour the content of each tube into a plastic cuvette and read the absorbance at 595 nm (Auto Zero the instrument with the blank solution).Use the template provided in Supplemental Table S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20191125/Supplemental.xlsx] to build a standard curve with the BSA readings and to interpolate the concentration of your samples.Setup your self-CoIP experiment and pre-clear lysates and beadsWe are here illustrating a typical self-CoIP experiment to probe the self-association of the cohesin subunit Rad21, and its dependency on nucleic acids. Specifically, we are using nuclear lysates from mouse embryonic stem cells with an endogenously dually tagged Rad21 protein (the B4 clone originally described in Cattoglio et al. (2019). This cell line contains a Rad21-SNAPf-3xFLAG allele and a Rad21-Halo-V5 allele (Figure 2A). We will pulldown the protein expressed from the first allele with a FLAG antibody (Figure 2B) and check whether the V5-tagged protein produced from the second allele is also immunoprecipitated using a V5 antibody during the Western blot (Figure 2C), both in untreated lysates and in lysates treated with benzonase to digest nucleic acids.",
    "We will also check the total IP efficiency of the experiment blotting against the immunoprecipitated FLAG protein (Figure 2D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218170457_3059.jpgFigure 2. Self-CoIP of Rad21. Experimental workflow and results of the Rad21 self-CoIP assay used here to illustrate the protocol. The data in C and D is modified from the original Figure 2F in Cattoglio et al. (2019). See Procedure E for a detailed description. IN, input nuclear lysates; UT, untreated lysates; Benz: benzonase-treated lysates.Create a scheme for your experiment like the following:Sample # (mg needed)Sample 1: mESC/untreated_input (0.2 mg)Sample 2: mESC/untreated_IgG (1 mg)Sample 3: mESC/untreated_αFLAG (1 mg)Sample 4: mESC/benzonase_input (0.2 mg)Sample 5: mESC/benzonase_IgG (1 mg)Sample 6: mESC/benzonase_αFLAG (1 mg)In this case, you will need 2.2 mg of nuclear lysates per condition (untreated and benzonase-treated).Note: The normal IgG sample (immunoglobulins purified from pre-immune serum) controls for non-specific pulldown and it must be of the same species of your αFLAG antibody (e.g., mouse anti-FLAG antibody and normal mouse IgG). Dilute the amount of lysates needed for your experiment to 1 mg/ml with 0.2 M CoIP buffer added of protease inhibitors (PMSF, aprotinin, benzamidine and Roche cOmplete inhibitors). If your volume exceeds 1.5 ml, move the diluted lysates to round-bottom tubes (Figure 3a).In our illustrative experiment:table:",

The figure illustrates all the steps required to immunoprecipitate the protein of interest, described in detail in the text.Preclear lysates with beads to reduce non-specific binding (note that these beads will be discarded at the end of the preclearing) (Figure 3b).Wash protein A or G Dynabeads.Note: Choose either protein A or G depending on the species and IgG subtype of your primary antibody (e.g., use protein G for rabbit and mouse IgG2a antibodies and protein A for guinea pig). Check the specification sheet of the magnetic beads manufacturer to confirm your choice. Resuspend vigorously the Dynabeads until homogenously dispersed.For each condition, pipet 20 μl of Dynabeads per mg of lysate (e.g., 44 μl for 2.2 mg) to a low-retention 1.5 ml tube.Resuspend in 500 μl of 0.2 M CoIP buffer.Insert the tube in the magnet separation rack and wait for 5 min for the solution to clear.Aspirate the CoIP buffer with a pipet, remove the tube from the magnet and repeat the wash a second time (Steps E3a-iii to E3a-v).Remove the tube from the magnet and use the diluted lysate to resuspend the beads and transfer them to the round-bottom tubes with the rest of your nuclear proteins.Rock the lysates with the beads for at least 2 h at 4 °C.Preclear beads with BSA (note that you will use these beads to perform the actual pulldown experiment) (Figures 3e-3f)Wash protein A or G Dynabeads; you will prepare a single pool of Dynabeads to be used with all your samples.Resuspend vigorously the Dynabeads until homogenously dispersed.In 1.5-ml tubes, pipet 20 μl of Dynabeads per sample (e.g., 20 μl for 6 samples: 120 μl).Note: You will not pipet Dynabeads in your input samples, but we include inputs when preclearing beads to accommodate pipetting errors later on.",
    "Resuspend in 1 ml of 0.2 M CoIP buffer.Insert the tube in the 1.5-ml magnetic separation stand and wait for 5 min for the solution to clear.Aspirate the CoIP buffer with a pipet, remove the tube from the magnet and repeat the wash a second time (Steps E4a-iii to E4a-v).Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the beads in 0.2 M CoIP buffer with 0.5% BSA (see Recipe B4). Use an amount of buffer equivalent to 10 times the volume of your beads (e.g., 1,200 μl BSA buffer for 120 μl of beads).Rock the beads with BSA at 4 °C overnight.Note: For convenience, we preclear beads with BSA overnight while incubating the lysates with antibodies, but a couple of hours are also sufficient.Add antibodies to the precleared lysates (Figures 3c-3d).Briefly spin down the precleared lysates at 4 °C to remove liquid drops from the tubes’ lids.Remove the snap cap and insert the tubes in the DynaMagTM magnetic stand.Wait for 5 min for the solution to clear.Note: During this and all subsequent magnetic separations, we like to transfer the magnetic stand in the fridge while waiting for the solution to clear, to maintain samples cold at all times. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube without disrupting the beads.Prepare as many 1.5-ml low-retention tubes as needed for the IP (e.g., for our 6 samples).Distribute the precleared lysates to the new tubes. In our illustrative experiments this will correspond to:Samples 2-3 and 5-6: pipet 1 ml (corresponding to 1 mg)Samples 1 and 4 (inputs): pipet 100-150 μl (corresponding to 0.1-1.15 mg)Add the specific antibody (4 μg per mg of lysate) and immediately invert the tube by mixing.",
    "In our illustrative experiment:Sample 1 (mESC/untreated_input): no antibodySample 2 (mESC/untreated_IgG): 4 μg of mouse normal IgGsSample 3 (mESC/untreated_αFLAG): 4 μg of mouse αFLAGSample 4 (mESC/benzonase_input): no antibodySample 5 (mESC/benzonase_IgG): 4 μg of mouse normal IgGsSample 6 (mESC/benzonase_αFLAG): 4 μg of mouse αFLAGRotate/rock the lysates with antibodies at 4 °C overnight.Note: We obtain best results when incubating the antibody overnight, but you can test your antibody and try to shorten the time. Bind antibodies to the precleared magnetic beads (Figures 3g-3i).Retrieve the samples and the BSA-precleared beads and briefly spin them down at 4 °C to remove liquid drops from the tubes’ lids.Place the tube with precleared beads in the magnetic separator rack.Wait for 5 min for the solution to clear.Remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend beads in 0.2 M CoIP buffer with inhibitors (50 μl per sample; in our illustrative experiment, 50 μl x 6 samples = 300 μl total).Distibute 50 μl of resuspended beads to each sample to be immunoprecipitated (inputs excluded) and immediately invert to mix.Rotate/rock the lysates with antibodies and beads at 4 °C for 2 h minimum.Leave input samples on ice.Wash immunoprecipitated samples (IP samples) to remove non-specific binding (Figure 3j).Prepare enough ice-cold 0.2 M CoIP buffer plus protease inhibitors to wash each IP sample 8 times with 400 μl of buffer (e.g., 4 IP samples x 400 μl x 8 = 12.8 ml of 0.2 M CoIP buffer; inputs are excluded).Briefly spin down IP samples at 4 °C to remove liquid drops from the tubes’ lids.Insert the IP samples’ tubes in the 1.5-ml magnetic stand.Wait for 5 min for the solution to clear. At this point your immunoprecipitated protein is attached to the beads via the antibody.Remove the CoIP buffer with a P1000 pipet without disturbing the beads.",
    "Remove tubes from the magnet and put them back on ice.Add 400 μl of 0.2 M CoIP buffer.Note: Make sure that the beads are completely resuspended. We typically vortex at low speed. Repeat Steps H4-H7 for 8 washes total.After the last wash, also remove any residual buffer with a P20.Elute immunoprecipitated material and prepare inputs and samples for SDS-PAGE (Figures 3k-3l).Remove tubes from the magnet and put them back on ice.Elute immunoprecipitated proteins from the beads adding 20 μl of 1x SDS loading buffer (Recipe B8).Note: The elution volume depends on how many samples you have. We are here illustrating an experiment that uses a 10-well acrylamide gel, which can easily accommodate 17 μl. We also use 12- or 15-well gels, and adjust the elution volumes accordingly or load less material. Vortex to resuspend.Boil the beads in a thermal block set at 98 °C for 5 min.Spin briefly.Place tubes in the 1.5-ml magnetic stand.Wait for 5 min. Your eluted proteins are now in the supernatant.Transfer the supernatant to a new low-retention 1.5 ml tube on ice (the volume should be slightly more than 20 μl). You will load 17 μl of this undiluted sample on one gel to estimate the self-CoIP efficiency (Figure 2C).Prepare a new set of tubes with 18 μl of 1x SDS-loading buffer and add 2 μl of the eluted material. You will load 17 μl of this 1:10 dilution on a second gel to estimate the IP efficiency (Figure 2D).Prepare 0.75% inputs to load along with your IP samples.Mix 22 μl of input lysate with 25 μl of 2x SDS-loading buffer and 3 μl of 0.2 M CoIP buffer.Note: This dilutes your inpute lysate to 0.44 μg/μl. Loading 17 μl of this dilution will give you ~7.5 μg, which correspond to 0.",

    "Place two 1-mm gel cassettes in a stable upright position.In a 15 ml conical tube, start preparing the separating gel, adding reagents in the order specified in Table 1 (Bis-Tris, acrylamide and water).Mix well pipetting up and down and finally add APS and TEMED.Prompty mix and pipet into the gel cassettes, leaving enough space for the stacking gel.Immediately layer 70% ethanol on top of the gel, using a squirt bottle. This will make your gel front neat and straight.Wait for polymerization to complete.Note: When solidified, the gel front will appear as a neat line easily distinguishable from the ethanol layered above. Aspirate the ethanol and wash the gel extensively with ddH2O using a squirt bottle.Aspirate the excess ddH2O.In a new 15 ml conical tube, start preparing the stacking gel, adding reagents in the order specified in Table 1 (Bis-Tris, acrylamide and water).Mix well pipetting up and down and finally add APS and TEMED.Prompty mix and pipet into the gel cassette on top of the separating gel, all the way to the top of the cassette.Slowly place the selected combs (in our case 10-well combs), making sure no bubbles form below the wells.Note: We normally aspirate the excess stacking gel with a P1000 while inserting the comb, transferring it back to the 15 ml tube where we prepared it, so that no acrylamide gets spilled on the bench. Wait for polymerization to complete.Run the SDS-PAGETransfer the gels into a running cassette (each cassette can accommodate 2 gels) and lock them in place.Note: Remember to peel off the white adhesive at the bottom of the gel cassette. Dilute the 20x MOPS running buffer according to Recipe B5.Note: Remember to add sodium metabisulfite. Remove the combs from the gel cassettes.",
    "Fill the inside chamber between the two cassettes with running buffer all the way to the top.Note: This will allow you to check whether the cassettes are properly locked or rather the buffer is leaking. Gently wash the wells using a syringe with a 22G needle filled with running buffer. Do not disturbe the bottom of the wells.Add the rest of the running buffer.Note: 500 ml will fill half of the outer tank or less. Decide the loading order of your samples.

Prepare the prestained protein standard (7 μl plus 27 μl of 1x SDS-loading buffer, 17 μl per well).Carefully load 17 μl of each sample with a P20. Fill the empty wells with 17 μl of 1x SDS loading buffer.Connect the lid of the running cassette to a power supply and place it on top of the cassette.Run at 75 V until the samples enter the separating gel.Note: Once the marker hits the separating gel, you will see clear bands forming. Increase the voltage to 130 V.Note: To help heat dissipation, we often put the cassette on top of a large metal block. Run until the bromophenol blue hits the bottom of the cassette, but before it runs out of the gel.Turn off the power supply.Remove the lid, unlock the gel cassettes and take them out.Wash extensively the cassettes with ddH2O, including the wells, to remove any traces of running buffer.Transfer proteins to a nitrocellulose membraneAssemble the transfer apparatus (Figure 4).",
    "Pre-wet with ddH2O two pieces of blotting membrane, cut only slightly larger than the gel to transfer.Note: Handle the membrane with gloves and only touching the membrane’s sides. Take a tray that will fit the gel holder cassettes.Add a gel holder cassette, black side facing down, and pour enough transfer buffer to cover it.Add one sponge, and make sure it gets fully covered in transfer buffer.Pre-wet in transfer buffer 2 pieces of blotting paper, cut only slightly larger than the gel to transfer.Place the first gel cassette on a paper towel (wells down) and crack it open with the provided metal spatula.Remove the top part, making sure that the gels adheres to the bottom one.Use a razor blade to remove the bottom part of the gel that sticks out, and the stacking gel.Note: The stacking gel is gluey. Scrape it with the razor blade from the gel cassette to the paper towel to get rid of all residues. Submerge the cassette containing the gel in the tray with transfer buffer.Lift the gel from the cassette and transfer it on top of the wet blotting paper; keep the empty cassette on the side.Pre-wet the blotting membrane in transfer buffer and layer it on top of the gel.Pre-wet a piece of blotting paper and layer it on top of the membrane.Use the empty gel cassette to roll out any air bubbles that might have formed between the gel and the membrane, pressing firmly but gently.Repeat Steps J3a-xii and J3a-xiii.Pre-wet another sponge and add it on top.Note: Always pre-wet blotting paper and sponges to avoid any capillarity effects.

This can vary a lot from one antibody to another. Discard the blocking solution and add the blotting solution with antibodies.Agitate at 4 °C overnight.Note: Overnight incubation in the cold room increases the specific signal while reducing background noise for all the antibodies we tested so far.
