    "1. Preparation of Cell Cultures and Reagents\nMaintain the cell cultures in the manufacturer's recommended medium, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (called complete medium). Keep the cell culturing flask in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator at 37 °C. Follow the proliferation and confluency of cells by inverted microscope (using 10X phase contrast objective).\nWhen cells reach adequate confluency, remove the medium, and wash the culture with 2-3 mL, sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Remove the PBS and add 0.5 mL, sterile 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution to the cell culture and incubate at 37 °C until cells detach (approximately 10 min).\nSuspend the cells in 3-4 mL sterile complete medium to stop trypsin and transfer them into a sterile centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the cells at 150 x g for 4 min at room temperature (RT). Discard the supernatant carefully and suspend the pellet in 2-3 mL sterile complete medium.\nTake out 100 µL of the cell suspension and mix with 100 µL 0.4% (m/V) trypan blue solution, to stain the dead cells. Load 10 µL of this mixture into a hemocytometer and determine the number of viable cells by inverted microscope.\nDilute the required amount of cell suspension prepared in step 1.3 to 10 mL with sterile complete medium, containing 4 x 104 cell/mL.\nAdd 250 µL of cell suspension (prepared in step 1.5) per well (104 cell/well) into seven wells of the first glass bottom 8-well microscopic slide. Use this slide in the GnRH uptake method.\nAdd 250 µL of cell suspension (prepared in step 1.5) per well (104 cell/well) into five wells of the second 8-well microscopic slide. This slide will be used in the GnRH-I-R expression method.",
    "Add 1 mL of cell suspension (prepared in step 1.5) per well (4 x 104 cell/well) into seven wells of a 12-well plate. This plate will be used in the GnRH quantification method.\nLet the cells adhere on the two microscopic slides and the plate. Incubate them in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator at 37 °C for 48 h.\nAfter the incubation check the cells by inverted microscope (using 10X phase contrast objective). If the cells are healthy and attached, continue with the following steps.\nPrepare 10 mM GnRH-FITC stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) from each of the three conjugates18. (Use these dilution concentrations: 16.43 µg/µL [D-Lys6(FITC)]-GnRH-I, 16.97 µg/µL [D-Lys6(FITC)]-GnRH-II and 16.47 µg/µL [Lys8(FITC)]-GnRH-III) Keep these stock solutions in a dark place at RT and use them up within a few weeks.\nDilute 1.7 µL each of the three 10 mM GnRH-FITC stock solutions in 1.7 mL complete medium. Shake these solutions. (These are the 10 µM GnRH-FITC treating media.) Dilute 150 µL each of the three 10 µM GnRH-FITC treating medium in 1.35 mL complete medium. Shake these solutions as well (these are the 1 µM GnRH-FITC treating medium).\n\tNOTE: All GnRH-FITC containing treating medium should be protected from light and used up within a few h.\nPreheat the six GnRH-FITC treating medium (prepared in step 1.12) and 4 mL complete medium to 37 °C.\nDilute 3 µL of 5 mM fluorescent probe solution (nuclear counterstain mentioned in the Materials List) in 3 mL PBS to 5 µM. This solution should be protected from light, keep it at RT and use it up within a few hours.\n2. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM)\nGnRH uptake method",
    "Take the first microscopic slide prepared in step 1.6 and pipette out the complete medium from each of the seven well. Add 250 µL of preheated complete medium into the first well. Use this as a negative control. Add 250 µL of the preheated GnRH-FITC treating media (from 1.13) to each of the next six wells (3 wells with 1 µM and 3 with 10 µM). Incubate the slide in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator at 37 °C for 5 h.\nPipette out the medium from each well and wash the cells with 250 µL PBS. Add 250 µL of fixing solution (10% neutral buffered formalin) into each well and incubate the slide at RT, for 10 min.\nPipette out the fixing solution from each well and wash the cells with 250 µL PBS. Add 250 µL of PBS containing 5 µM fluorescent probe solution prepared in step 1.14 into each well and incubate the slide at RT, for 10 min.\nPipette out the fluorescent probe solution from each well, and wash the cells twice with 250 µL PBS carefully. Add 3-4 drops of mounting medium into each well, finally. Keep the slide in dark at RT, until the imaging.\nGnRH-I-R expression method\nTake the second 8-well microscopic slide prepared in step 1.7 and pipette out the complete medium from each of the five wells.\nAdd 250 µL of preheated complete medium into the first well, use this as negative control. Add 250 µL of preheated complete medium into the second well too, and use this to examine GnRH-I-R expression before the GnRH treatment.",
    "Add 250 µL each of the three preheated 10 µM GnRH-FITC treating media into the next three wells. Use these wells to pretreat the cells with GnRH-FITC conjugates before examining the GnRH-I-R expression. Incubate the slide in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPipette out the treating medium from each of the three wells which will be used to examine GnRH-I-R expression after the GnRH treatment and wash these wells with 250 µL of preheated complete medium. Add 250 µL of preheated complete medium into each of the three wells. Incubate the slide in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPipette out the medium from each of the five wells and wash the cells with 250 µL PBS. Add 250 µL of fixing solution into each well and incubate the slide at RT, for 10 min.\nPipette out the fixing solution from each well and wash the cells with 250 µL of PBS.

Keep it at RT and use it up within a few hours.\nPipette out the BSA blocking solution from each well except the negative control (first well). Wash the cells with 250 µL PBS (except the negative control well). Add 250 µL of PBS containing GnRH-I-R primary antibody prepared in step 2.2.7 into each well (except the negative control). Incubate the slide at RT, for 1 h, in a dark place.\nDilute 2.5 µL of Alexa 546 labeled secondary antibody in 1.25 mL PBS (1:500 ratio).",
    "NOTE: This solution should be protected from light, keep it at RT and use it up within a few hours.\nPipette out solutions from each of the five wells and wash the cells with 250 µL PBS. Add 250 µL of PBS containing AF 546 labeled secondary antibody prepared in step 2.2.9 into each well. Incubate the slide at RT, for 1 h in dark.\nPipette out the solution from each well and wash the cells with 250 µL PBS. Add 250 µL of PBS containing 5 µM fluorescent probe solution prepared in step 1.14 into each well and incubate the slide for 10 min, at RT.\nPipette out the fluorescent probe solution from each well and wash the cells twice with 250 µL PBS carefully. Add 3-4 drops of mounting media into each well, afterwards. Keep the slide in dark at RT until the microscopic imaging.\nImaging\nImage the cells by inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (using 63X oil immersion objective)\n\t\t\nUse the following excitation/emission wavelengths. GnRH conjugates: 488/514 nm, Alexa 546 labeled antibody: 488/546 nm (use only for the GnRH-I-R expression method), Draq5 fluorescent probe: 633/680 nm.\nSet up the imaging parameters using the negative control cells. Use these parameters to image treated cells (Figure 3). Re-adjust imaging parameters on each microscopic slide at the beginning of the analysis. Fine-tune and export images with the software provided by the manufacturer if necessary.\n3. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\nGnRH quantification method",
    "Take the plate prepared in step 1.8 and pipette out the complete medium from each of the seven wells. Add 1 mL of preheated complete medium into the first well. Use this as a negative control. Add 1 mL each of the six preheated treating media (3 wells with 1 µM and 3 wells with 10 µM) into the next six wells. Incubate the plate in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator at 37 °C for 5 h.\nPipette out the medium from each well. Wash the cells twice with 2 mL PBS carefully. Add 500 µL of trypsin-EDTA solution into each wells. Incubate the plate at 37 °C until cells detach (approximately 10 min).\nAdd 1 mL of complete medium into each well to stop trypsin. Shake the plate. Suspend the cells gently with a pipette, and transfer the suspension from each well into FACS tubes. Centrifuge the tubes at 150 x g for 4 min, at 4 °C.\nPour out the supernatants carefully, with one move. Add 500 µL of ice-cold PBS into each FACS tube and gently re-suspend the cells. Keep the tubes on ice until the end of the experiment.\nAnalysis and calculation\nAnalyze the cells by flow cytometry. For excitation, use 488 nm argon laser wavelength and for detection use 530 nm wavelength. Set up the flow cytometer parameters by running the negative control cells. Use these parameters to analyze treated cells (Figure 4A). Evaluate the data with the manufacturer's software, determine median fluorescent intensity (MFI) values, and calculate the relative MFI values.\nSubscription Required.
