  "procedures": [
    "Note: All procedures are carried out at room temperature unless otherwise specified. Fluorescence microscopyPick a single colony of Salmonella cells expressing pHluorin(M153R)-FliG (YVM1004 and YVM1049 for local pH measurements and SJW1368 transformed with pYVM008 for in vivo calibration) from LB agar plate and inoculate it into a glass test tube with 5 ml LB and shaking at 150 rpm at 30 °C overnight. When SJW1368/pYVM008 cells are grown, ampicillin is added to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml.Transfer 50 µl of overnight culture to 5 ml of fresh TB and incubate at 30 °C with shaking at 150 rpm until the cell density reaches an OD600 of ca. 1.8. Note: It takes about 15 h.Transfer 500 µl of each culture to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and then collect the cells by centrifugation (6,000 x g, 2 min).Discard supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet in 1.0 ml of motility buffer.Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 2 min.Discard supernatant.Repeat steps A5-A7 twice.Resuspend the cells in 500 µl of fresh motility buffer.Make a tunnel slide by sandwiching double-sided tape between a 24 x 32 mm coverslip (bottom side) and an 18 x 18 mm coverslip (top side) (see Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Preparation for a tunnel slide (from Morimoto et al., 2017)Add 50 µl of the cell suspension to the tunnel slide and leave for 5 min to attach the cells to the coverslip surface.Wash out unbound cells by supplying 100 µl of the motility buffer using a pipette (P100). Absorb the excess amount of the buffer with a piece of a filter paper. (see Video 1)Put the sample on a custom-built inverted fluorescence microscope (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170829/20170829021036_5437.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of pH imaging system using ratiometric pHluorin(M153R).",
    "The pH imaging system was built on an inverted fluorescence microscope with a 150x oil immersion objective lens, 1.6x variable inserts and a C9100-02 EMCCD camera. The fluorescent spots of pHluorin(M153R)-FliG were excited by a xenon lamp with two excitation filters, 400AF30 (Omega Optical) for 410-nm excitation and BP470-490 (Olympus) for 470-nm excitation. A high-speed wavelength switcher was used to switch these two excitation filters. Fluorescence emission was passed through a dichroic mirror (DM) (FF510-Di01-25x36, Semrock) and an emission filter (EmF) (520DF40, Omega Optical). Each fluorescent image was captured by the EMCCD camera. The high-speed wavelength switcher and the EMCCD camera were controlled by the MetaMorph software. ND: neutral density filter.Select a 150x objective and insert a 1.6x variable lens.Note: High magnification is required to measure the local cytoplasmic pH in living bacterial cells (150x objective and 1.6x variable lens with C9100-02 EMCCD [cell size: 8 x 8 µm]: 33 nm/pixel).Switch between 410 and 470 nm excitation filters using a high-speed wavelength switcher.Capture each image of the pHluorin(M153R)-FliG fluorescent spots by the EMCCD camera with a 5 sec exposure time (Figure 2).Notes:  The culture is diluted with motility buffer to adjust the number of cells to about 10 cells per 10 x 10 µm image field.Fluorescent spots are excited by a xenon lamp through an ND filter to avoid photobleaching. Time-lapse measurements are required to test the effect of photobleaching.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170829/20170829021223_1288.jpgFigure 2. Typical fluorescence image of Salmonella cells expressing pHluorin(M153R)-FliG. Fluorescence and bright field images of the Salmonella YVM1004 strain. The red square indicates a typical fluorescent spot of pHluorin(M153R)-FliG.In vivo calibrationAfter step A8: Resuspend SJW1368 cells carrying pYVM008 in 500 µl of motility buffer containing 20 µM gramicidin and 20 mM potassium benzoate.Add 50 µl of the cell suspension to the tunnel slide and leave for 5 min.",
    "Wash out unbound cells by supplying 100 µl of motility buffer containing 20 µM gramicidin and 20 mM potassium benzoate. Absorb the excess amount of the buffer using a filter paper. Put the sample on the fluorescence microscope.Acquire ratiometric fluorescence images of the cells at external pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0 or 7.5 in the presence of 20 µM gramicidin and 20 mM potassium benzoate. The tunnel slide and the cells are freshly prepared for each external pH measurement.In vitro calibrationSuspend purified pHluorin(M153R)-FliG proteins in motility buffer with distinct pH values, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 or 8.5.Add 50 µl of the solution containing pHluorin(M153R)-FliG proteins to the tunnel slide and absorb the excess amount of the solution with a piece of filter paper.Acquire fluorescence images of the pHluorin(M153R)-FliG protein solution excited by 410 and 470 nm at each pH values.Note: When the protein concentration of pHluorin(M153R)-FliG is too high, its fluorescence intensity is considerably high, thereby saturating the sensor chip of the EMCCD camera. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the protein concentration of pHluorin(M153R)-FliG to ca. ~100 µg/ml in order to make an in vitro calibration curve."
