    "When utilizing other protein labeling techniques, e.g., SNAP labeling, and/or reconstitution procedures not based on Triton X-100 as described here, skip steps 1–4, and start at step 5.Preparation of large unilamellar vesicles (see Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4366/bioprotoc-12-06-4366-g001.jpgFigure 1. Protein reconstitution and preparation of large unilamellar vesicles. Experimental workflow. Triton-extracted ER membrane proteins (TE) from yeast are fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 succinimidyl ester (left), yielding Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescent labeled TE (TE647). Unreacted fluorophore is removed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and the eluate is subsequently reconstituted together with the lipids, eggPC, ATTO488-PE, and biotin-PE into large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), using Triton X-100-containing buffer (TX). Pre-washed Bio-Beads are used to remove the detergent, generating sealed TE647-LUVs (middle). Protein-free/empty LUVs are generated in parallel (right).Amine labeling of the TE membrane proteins:Thaw the TE on ice.Mix the TE with 3-fold molar excess of Alexa Fluor 647 succinimidyl ester in 1.8-fold volume low ionic labeling buffer (see Recipe 1) in a 2 mL tube.Note: We typically label 95 µg TE per reconstitution. Incubate the ‘labeling mixture’ at room temperature for 1 h, under end-over-end rotation, covered in aluminum foil.Place a spin column into a 15 mL Falcon tube with a cut-up open lid.Add Bio-Gel P-6 (see Recipe 2) to the spin column, centrifuge in a tabletop centrifuge at 453 ×  gav and 4°C for 3 min.Wash the P-6 column twice in low ionic labeling buffer (see Recipe 1), centrifuge in a tabletop centrifuge at 453 ×  gav and 4°C for 3 min.Place the P-6 column into a clean 15 mL Falcon tube with the cut-up open lid.Remove unreacted fluorophore using the equilibrated P-6 column, by placing the ‘labeling mixture’ on top of the P-6 column, waiting for ~2 min, and centrifuging using a tabletop centrifuge at 453 ×  gav and 4°C for 3 min.",
    "SM-2 Bio-Bead wash:Weigh slightly more SM-2 Bio-Beads than needed into a glass beaker, as some beads will be lost during washing.Add a magnet and wash in methanol under the flow cabinet, twice for 15 min each. Use a glass pipette to remove the methanol.Wash in deionized water, under gentle stirring at room temperature, twice for 15 min each. Use a glass pipette to remove the solution.Wash in low ionic buffer (see Recipe 3), under gentle stirring at room temperature, for 15 min. Use a glass pipette to remove the low ionic buffer.Store the washed SM-2 Bio-Beads in low ionic buffer (see Recipe 3) at 4°C, until use.Note: Use freshly or within a week. Reconstitute the eluted Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescent labeled TE (TE647) into LUVs of desired protein-to-phospholipid ratio (PPR), according to         Chalat et al. (2012)        . We typically reconstituted TE647 with a PPR of 35 (weight/weight), as follows:Clean the Hamilton syringes three to five times in chloroform:methanol (1:1, volume/volume) under a flow cabinet.Note: Distinguish between Hamilton syringes used for unlabeled and fluorescently labeled lipids. Avoid any use of plasticware when handling organic solvents. Mix the desired amount of unlabeled (4.32 µmol eggPC and 43.2 nmol biotin-PE) and labeled (4.42 nmol ATTO488-PE) lipids (dissolved in chloroform:methanol) using Hamilton syringes, into a round bottom glass tube covered in aluminum foil to protect the fluorophore, on ice.Evaporate the solvent under a gentle stream of N2 gas at room temperature for ~15 min, to form a thin lipid film. Note: We slide the large end of a disposable glass Pasteur pipette into laboratory tubing that is attached to the regulator onto the N2 gas cylinder. Using the outlet valve on the regulator, the flow is adjusted for a gentle stream of N2 gas coming through the pipette.",
    "The pipette can be held with a ring stand clamp to hold it in a fixed position.  Place the lipid film in a vacuum desiccator at ~10 mbar and room temperature for 1 h, to remove the last traces of the solvent. Note: We use a glass desiccator connected to a chemically resistant vacuum pump, reaching a final vacuum of 10 mbar (±2 mbar) and a suction capacity of 1.5 m3 h-1.  Add aliquots of 200 µL of low ionic buffer with Triton X-100 (see Recipe 4). Vortex gently and allow the sample to sit on ice for ~5 min, before adding the next aliquot.For protein-free/empty LUVs, add up to 1 mL of low ionic buffer with Triton X-100 (see Recipe 4). For TE647-containing LUVs, after adding four times 200 µL of low ionic buffer with Triton X-100, add appropriate amounts of TE647, and fill up to 1 mL with low ionic buffer with Triton X-100.Note: For PPR of 35 (weight/weight), we add 95 µg of TE647. Gently and shortly vortex the samples, and allow the suspension to incubate while continuing to the next step.Note: The mixture should be as clear as water before adding SM-2 Bio-Beads. Add 100 mg washed and dried SM-2 Bio-Beads per 1 mL of sample. Place on an end-over-end rotator at room temperature for 3 h.Note: Dried SM-2 Bio-Beads are defined by the removal of low ionic buffer in which the SM-2 Bio-Beads are stored using a disposable glass Pasteur pipette, just before weighting them. Add an additional 200 mg of washed and dried SM-2 Bio-Beads per 1 mL of sample. Place on an end-over-end rotator at 4°C overnight.Transfer the LUV suspension to a 1.5 mL tube without the SM-2 Bio-Beads, using a disposable glass Pasteur pipette and store at 4°C until use.",
    "Determine the efficiency of detergent removal after reconstitution with Triton X-100, according to Hrafnsdóttir and Menon (2000). All the described steps are performed in a flow cabinet to avoid direct exposure to organic solvents.Transfer 0, 7.5, 15, 30, and 45 µL of low ionic buffer with Triton X-100 (see Recipe 4) into separated round bottom glass tubes (corresponding to 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3% Triton X-100) and add low ionic buffer (see Recipe 3) to a final volume of 150 µL. We recommend preparing each standard in duplicates.Transfer 50 µL of the TE647-LUVs and protein-free/empty LUVs into separate glass tubes, and add low ionic buffer (see Recipe 3) to a final volume of 150 µL. We recommend preparing duplicates.Add 600 µL of methanol and 300 µL of chloroform to all the samples, including the standards, and vortex briefly.Measure the absorbance at 275 nm (A275) on a spectrophotometer using quartz cuvettes.Average the duplicate readings for each standard and sample.Subtract the mean absorbance value of the blank standard (0% Triton X-100) from all standard and sample readings. This is the corrected absorbance.Plot a standard curve (% Triton X-100 versus mean absorbance A275) using linear regression analysis with e.g., Microsoft Excel.Use the linear regression equation to calculate the Triton X-100 concentration of the sample, by comparing the sample absorbance to the standard curve obtained.Note: More than 99.95% of the initial Triton X-100 amount is typically removed. Determine the phospholipid concentration of the generated protein-free/empty and TE647-LUVs according to Bartlett (1959) and Ploier and Menon (2016), with small modifications to the protocol.Note: All steps described below should be conducted in a fume hood using appropriate personal protection and following lab safety guidelines. Turn on the electrical heating block in a folw cabine and set it at 145°C.Dilute the phosphate standard solution.",
    "Transfer 0, 5, 12.5, and 20 µL of phosphate standard solution (see Recipe 5, corresponding to 0, 20, 50, and 80 nmol phosphate) into separate glass tubes, and add deionized water to a final volume of 50 µL. Additional standards are obtained from 10-fold diluted phosphate standard solution, e.g., 5, 12.5, and 25 µL of 0.4 M phosphate standard solution (corresponding to 2, 5, and 10 nmol phosphate). We recommend preparing each standard in duplicates.Transfer 12 µL (about 50 nmol) of the LUV solutions into separate glass tubes and add deionized water to a final volume of 50 µL. We recommend preparing duplicates and using different amounts of the LUV solutions, to ensure the readings are within the standard value range.Note: An aliquot of the detergent-solubilized LUVs prior to SM-2 Bio-Bead addition (step 3e) can be included in the analysis to determine phospholipid recovery. We typically achieve a recovery of 70–90% phospholipid after reconstitution. Add 300 µL of perchloric acid to all samples including standards, close the glass tube loosely with glass marbles to prevent evaporation, and heat at 145°C for 1 h.Remove the glass tubes from the heating block and let them cool to room temperature.Set the temperature on a heating block to 100°C.Add 1 mL of deionized water to all samples and vortex.Add 400 µL of freshly prepared molybdate solution (see Recipe 6) to all samples and vortex briefly.Add 400 µL of freshly prepared ascorbic acid solution (see Recipe 7) to all samples and vortex briefly.Close the glass tube loosely with glass marbles, and heat at 100°C for 10 min.Let the samples cool to room temperature and measure the absorbance at 797 nm (A797) on a spectrophotometer using disposable polystyrene cuvettes.Average the duplicate readings for each standard and sample.",
    "Subtract the mean absorbance value of the blank standard (0 nmol phosphate) from all standard and sample readings. This is the corrected absorbance.Plot a standard curve (nmol phosphate versus mean absorbance [A797] using linear regression analysis) with e.g., Microsoft Excel.Use the linear regression equation to calculate the phosphate concentration of the sample, by comparing the sample absorbance to the standard curve obtained.Preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles (see Figure 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4366/bioprotoc-12-06-4366-g002.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of giant unilamelar vesicles from large vesicles. A. Equipment for a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) formation chamber. B. Schematic workflow of GUV formation by electroformation. Deposition of diluted large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) on two indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides, followed by dehydration under saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) conditions overnight, to form a thin lipid film. The two ITO-coated slides are sandwiched to assemble an ITO chamber separated by a silicone rubber spacer with copper tape on each side, sealed by Parafilm, and held together by clamps. A syringe is used to inject 1 mL of 250 mM sucrose solution (not illustrated), which is then sealed with Parafilm, and the chamber is immediately connected to a function generator for GUV formation. Modified from       Mathiassen et al. (2021)      .UV/ozone clean the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slides:Clean four ITO-coated glass slides with detergent, deionized water, and 70% ethanol.Note: Two ITO slides are required to assemble one ITO chamber. Scramblase-containing and protein-free/empty GUVs are always made in parallel for comparison (sGUVs and eGUVs, respectively). Dry the slides with wipes.UV/ozone clean the conducting side using a UV/ozone cleaner for 10 min.Turn on the Surface Decontamination Unit for 15 min before opening the chamber.Adjust the osmolarity of the solutions used for giant unilamellar vesicle handling:Turn on the Vapor Pressure Osmometer and let it equilibrate for ~30 min before use.",
    "Place a filter with forceps at the Vapor Pressure Osmometer.Equilibrate the Vapor Pressure Osmometer using osmolarity standards of 290 mmol kg-1, by applying a volume of 10 µL onto the filter.Measure the osmolarity of the 250 mM sucrose solution (see Recipe 8) and the 250 mM glucose solution (see Recipe 9).Adjust the osmolarity of the solutions with deionized water, if required.Giant unilamellar vesicle formation by electroformation:Dilute the TE647-LUVs and protein-free/empty LUVs to a lipid concentration of 0.8 mg mL-1 in deionized water to a total volume of 100 µL in separate 1.5 mL tubes.For each sample, two cleaned ITO-coated glass slides are prepared by depositing a volume of 50 µL in 2 µL droplets on each side of the conducting and cleaned ITO-coated glass slides.Dehydrate the ITO-coated glass slides in a desiccator containing saturated sodium chloride (see Recipe 10) overnight, to form a lipid film.Assemble the two ITO-coated glass slides into a chamber separated by a silicone rubber spacer with copper tape facing the conducting sides. Seal with Parafilm and clamps to prevent leakage from the ITO chamber.Inject 1 mL of 250 mM sucrose solution (see Recipe 8) into the chamber using a 1,000 µL Hamilton syringe. Seal the opening with Parafilm to prevent evaporation.Immediately connect the ITO chambers to the function generator by applying a sinusoidal voltage for 4 h, 20 Hz, 0.2–1.3 V, increasing every 6 min. Cover the chamber in aluminium foil to protect the fluorophore.Shear off the formed GUVs, by changing the electrical settings to 4 Hz and 1.3 V for 30 min.Carefully invert the ITO chamber and remove the clamps and the Parafilm, while opening the chamber from one corner to transfer/drop the GUVs into a 1.5 mL tube.Store the GUVs, covered in aluminium foil at room temperature, until microscopically observation.",
    "Clean the disassembled ITO-coated glass slides, as described above.Preparation of the giant unilamellar vesicle scramblase assay (see Figure 3)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4366/bioprotoc-12-06-4366-g003.jpgFigure 3. Preparing the giant unilamellar vesicle scramblase assay setup. A. Equipment for assembling the microscope observation chamber. B. UV-gluing the corners of the Sticky-slide, using a pipette tip with the PEGylated side facing upwards. C. UV-drying the UV-glue. D. Scissor-cut a pipette tip for giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) handling. E. Schematic workflow of the fluorescence-based assay for measuring phospholipid scramblase activity in GUVs. The biotin-PEGylated cover glass slide is glued unto a Sticky-slide for assembling of the microscope observation chamber. Avidin is added to bind to the biotinylated PEG molecules, followed by biotinylated-GUV immobilization. The fluorescent lipid probe ATTO488-PE is observed using a confocal fluorescence microscope with a 63× water objective. Images are acquired prior to and after dithionite addition. Scramblase-containing GUVs (sGUVs) are expected to result in complete ATTO488 bleaching, whereas only outer leaflet ATTO488 is bleached in empty GUVs (eGUVs), generating a ~50% fluorescence reduction. Modified from       Mathiassen et al. (2021).Clean cover glass slides and Pyrex flask according to         Chandradoss et al. (2014)         with modifications of the protocol, as outline below. All described steps are performed in a flow cabinet to avoid direct exposure to organic solvents.Place the cover glass slides in a glass jar and rinse five times with deionized water.Note: Any glass jar where the cover glass slides are fully covered in solution can be used. Sonicate in fresh deionized water for 10 min to remove dirt.Dispose of the deionized water and rinse three times with fresh deionized water.Rinse with methanol and sonicate for 10 min.Sonicate in acetone for 20 min.Discard the acetone and rinse three times with deionized water, to remove any acetone residue.Sonicate in 5.0 M potassium hydroxide (see Recipe 11) for 20 min.",
    "Rinse six times with deionized water.Sonicate in methanol for 2 min, and keep the cover slides in methanol until step 2 (see below).Rinse a Pyrex flask several times with deionized water.Sonicate the Pyrex flask in 1.0 M KOH (see Recipe 12) for 30 min.Sonicate the Pyrex flask in methanol for 30 min.Surface functionalization of the clean glass slides with amine groups via 3-aminopropylthriethoxysilane (APTES), according to         Lamichhane et al. (2010)        , using Methoxy-Poly (Ethylene Glycol)-Succinimidyl Carbonate (mPEG-SC) and biotin-Poly (Ethylene Glycol)-Succinimidyl Carbonate (biotin-PEG-SC), is described in the following:Prepare the amino-silanization solution by mixing 300 mL of methanol, 15 mL of glacial acetic acid, and 3 mL of APTES in the cleaned Pyrex flask.Replace the methanol in the glass jar containing the cleaned cover glass slides and incubate for 20 min, sonicate for 1 min, and further incubate for 10 min.Rinse four times with methanol, once with deionized water, and once with methanol.Dry the cover glass slides with a stream of N2 gas, before PEGylating them.Place the dried cover glass slides in a clean container or a pipette tip box filled with ~10% DMSO or deionized water. Close the box to prevent dust accumulation.Note: Remember to label the sides of the cover glass slides to distinguish the PEGylated side later. Prepare a PEG solution (for ~35 slides) by dissolving 10 mg biotin-PEG-SC and 200 mg mPEG-SC in 1.6 mL of 100 mM sodium bicarbonate (see Recipe 13). Vortex gently to mix. Note: Equilibrate the PEG molecules to room temperature before use. Before returning the PEG molecules to -20°C, flush the vial with N2 gas, seal with Parafilm, wrap in aluminum foil, and desiccate.  Add 90 µL of the PEG solution onto one cover glass slide at a time. Gently place another cleaned cover glass slide on top.",
    "Close the box and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 5–6 h.Note: Make sure no air bubbles are trapped between the slides. Use a clean pipette tip to reposition the slides if they move during the incubation time. Gently slide to separate the cover glass slides, rinse with deionized water, and dry with N2 gas.Store the PEGylated cover glass slides in separate 50 mL Falcon tubes flushed with N2 gas, sealed with Parafilm, and wrapped in aluminum foil, at -20°C until use.Note: We typically used the PEGylated cover glass slides within 3 months. Assembly of the microscope observation chamber:Allow a PEGylated cover glass slide to equilibrate to room temperature.Glue an Ibidi Sticky-slide 8 well onto the PEGylated cover glass slide.Seal the chamber’s corners with UV-glue.Dry the UV-glue under the UV/ozone cleaner for 2 min.Turn on the Surface Decontamination Unit for 5 min, before opening the chamber.Giant unilamellar vesicle immobilization:Add 200 µL of avidin (0.2 mg mL-1 in deionized water, see Recipe 14) to each chamber, incubate for 10 min or longer.Gently wash away any unbound avidin with 400 µL of 250 mM glucose solution (see Recipe 9), using a pipette.Cut a 200 µL pipette tip with scissors.Add 100 µL of GUVs with the scissor-cut 200 µL pipette tip, and incubate for 10 min or longer.Note: The final volume is 500 µL. Assaying phospholipid scramblase activity in giant unilamellar vesicles:Prepare 1.5 mL tubes with 20 mg dithionite powder and store on ice.Turn on the confocal microscope, computer, and open the LAS X software. We use the following settings: 63×/1.20 water objective, image acquisition using a 400 Hz unidirectional scanner, a pixel size of 246.27 × 246.27 μm, and a pinhole of 100 μm (1 AU) with Leica HyD detectors.",
    "The λex/λem used for imaging are as follows: 507/517–550 nm for ATTO488, 645/655–780 nm for Alexa647.Obtain images of several marked positions using a motorized specimen on the microscope slide before dithionite treatment (corresponding to t = 0 min).Dissolve the dithionite in 600 µL of 250 mM glucose solution (see Recipe 9), and vortex just before use.Note: Prepare a fresh dithionite solution for each experimental series. Dithionite in solution is not stable and disintegrates fast! Add 5 µL of dithionite (for a 2 mM final concentration) and immediately obtain images over a time series (corresponding to t > 0 min).A similar procedure is carried out for 250 mM glucose solution (see Recipe 9) addition, as a control."
