    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStep 1. HEK 293T transfection and lentivirus production\nTiming: 3 days\nIn this step we describe in detail the calcium phosphate/BES buffer method used for high efficiency transfection of 293T packaging cells with lentiviral vectors. After transfection on Day 1, virus production by 293T cells is allowed to proceed for two days (Day 1-Day 3). On Day 2, the target cells (SYO-1 sarcoma cells) are plated for infection with the produced virus on the following day (Day 3).\nAll procedures are performed in TC hood.\n293T cells were transfected with the pCW57.1-DUX4-CA, PLKO.1-TRC2, PLKO.1-shSS18-1, and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 lentiviral vectors, one 6-well plate for each vector.\nThe following details are provided for the transfection of one 6-well plate/ one vector.\nDay 0\nTiming: 1 h\n293T plating in 6-well plate, one day before transfection.\nAdd 2 mL of fresh growth medium to each well of a 6-well plate.\nDetach with 0.25% trypsin and pellet 293T cells from a confluent (80%–90%; ∼1.5 × 107 cells) 100 mm plate in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, as described above.\n1:6 dilution: resuspend the cell pellet in 6 mL of growth medium, mix well, then add 1 mL (∼2.5 × 106 cells) of the suspension to a centrifuge tube containing 5 mL of fresh growth medium.\nMix cells thoroughly by pipetting, then add 1 mL to each of the 6 wells.\nReturn cells to 37°C TC incubator for 16–18 h.\nDay 1\nTiming: 8 h\nTransfection of 1× 6-well plate.\nIn a 15 mL centrifuge tube combine in sequence:\n750 μL of 0.25 M CaCl2; dilute the 2.5 M CaCl2 stock 1:10 in molecular biology grade H2O.\n15 μg of packaging plasmid- pCMV-dR7.74psPAX2.\n6 μg of envelope plasmid- pMD2.G.\n20 μg of one of the lentiviral vectors mentioned above.",
    "750 μL of 2× BES buffer.\nClose the tube and mix with a brief vortex (1–2 full swirls only).\nLet sit in TC hood for 20–30 min to allow formation of DNA/calcium phosphate precipitate.\nDuring this incubation period, 10 min prior to transfection, add 5 μL of 25 mM chloroquine to each of the 6-wells, swirl to mix, and return the culture plate to the 37°C incubator.\nAt time of transfection, add dropwise 250 μL of the DNA/BES transfection mix to each well.\nGently swirl the plate to mix and return it to the 37°C incubator for 6–7 h.\nReplace the transfection medium in each well with 3 mL of growth medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Calcium phosphate transfection of 293T cells with lentiviral vectors\nDigital image of calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates (red arrows) that form in BES buffer and cover the surface of the transduced 293T cells. Image was obtained with a Canon PowerShot SD600 digital camera and an inverted microscope (Vista Vision) 40× objective.\nNote: At the end of the transfection period, it is advisable to examine the 293T cells for overlying sand-like precipitates, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nDay 2\nTiming: 1 h\nPlate sarcoma cells for next day infection.\nFor infections performed in 100 mm TC dishes: split cells in their regular growth media so they are 30%–40% confluent the next day.\nNote: It is critical that the passaged cells are not confluent and are actively growing before plating for infection. Quiescent cells are poorly transduced.\nFor infections performed in 96-well plates- the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay:\nDetach cells with 0.25% trypsin from an actively growing culture.\nPellet cells and resuspend in growth medium.\nCount cells in the suspension.\nDilute the cell suspension in growth medium to achieve a final concentration of 2–3 × 104 cells/mL.",
    "Thoroughly mix the cell suspension, transfer it into a sterile trough, and add 100 μL to each well (2–3 × 103 cells/well) with a multichannel pipette.\nFor consistent results, plate cells in the “inner” wells of the plate and reserve the “outermost” wells to fill with fluid (plain growth medium or PBS) in order to prevent drying of the inner wells that contain the plated cells.\nNote: For reproducible results, it is critical to maintain even distribution of cells among dishes and wells during plating. Therefore, we strongly advise repeated mixing of cell suspensions in-between plates and prompt plating, especially when dealing with multiple plates, to prevent cell sedimentation at the bottom of the trough or in the pipette. 2,000–3,000 cells/well is a good starting average number that provides room for SYO-1 cell division over several days. However, this number can be optimized (1,000–5,000 cells/well range), depending on the specific growth rate of the tested cell line.\nAlternatives: Lipid-based transfection reagents such as lipofectamine, have been successful alternates to the long-established calcium phosphate method. However, their cost has prohibited their use in large scale transfections. By contrast, the Polyethylenimine (PEI) polymer, with a significantly higher cost-effectiveness is considered a good substitute as a transfection reagent.\nStep 2. Lentiviral infection of sarcoma cells for protein and SRB growth analyses\nIn this section we provide a step-by-step description of lentivirus transduction in target cells on Day 3. We also include a direct lysis method for protein analysis and the details of the SRB assay to measure the effect of lentivirus expression on cell growth over three days.\nInfection plus protein analysis in SYO-1 and CDS-X1 cells (days 3-5)\nInfection plus growth analysis in SYO-1 cells (days 3-7)",
    "In this protocol 293T cells are transfected with the lentivirus vector pCW57.1-DUX4-CA for overexpression, and the sh-vectors PLKO.1-TRC2, PLKO.1-shSS18-1, and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 for depletion. The viral supernatant of one transfected 293T 6-well plate (∼18 mL yield) dedicated to each vector is sufficient for the infection of 2 × 100 mm dishes or 180 wells of 96-well plates.\nDay 3\nTiming: 1 h for step 4\nTiming: 6 h for step 5\nTiming: 6 h for step 6\nTiming: 6–10 h for step 7\nTiming: 8 h and 40 min for step 8\nTiming: 2 days 4 h for step 9\nTiming: 2 h/plate/graph for step 10\nTiming: 2 h/graph for step 11\nLentivirus collection.\nAfter two days of virus production, collect the 293T medium containing the lentivirus and pass it through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (mixed cellulose esters; Millex-HA).\nNote: Alternatively, the virus can be harvested by centrifugation of the 293T supernatant at 500 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd 36 μL of polybrene to the 18 mL viral supernatant collected from the 6-well plate (3 mL/well) and mix.\nFor best results, immediately infect SYO-1 cells with the virus thus produced.\nNote: Do not be alarmed if the transfected 293T cells appear to have detached from the plate after two days. Floating 293T cells do produce virus.",
    "Alternatives: The virus supernatant may be stored at 4°C for 2–3 days without losing potency. It may also be aliquoted and stored at −80°C for 2–3 weeks. However, it loses titer, hence efficiency overtime. It is critical to avoid frequent freeze/thaw cycles of the supernatant. If long term storage is necessary or desired without loss of titer, the virus can be concentrated up to 100-fold as follows: 1) ultracentrifugation, or 2) mixing the virus with polyethylene glycol (PEG; TAKARA Lenti-X concentrator) followed by a slower spin cycle. The concentrated virus is aliquoted and stored at −80°C.\nLentivirus infection of SYO-1 and CDS-X1 cells plated in 100 mm TC dishes.\nNote: One 6-well plate of transfected 293T produces enough virus for 2 × 100 mm dishes of target cells.\nAdd 8–8.5 mL of the filtered virus supernatant/polybrene to each 100 mm dish.\nPlace dish in the TC incubator on a flat shelf for even spread of the virus.\nAllow infection to proceed for 5–6 h.\nAspirate the infection medium and add to the dish 10 mL of growth medium.\nAllow cells to grow in TC incubator until time of analysis (direct lysis or ChIP).\nLentivirus infection of SYO-1 cells in 96-well plates- SRB assay.\nAspirate the growth medium of the cells plated on Day 2.\nAdd 100 μL/well of the filtered virus/polybrene supernatant with a multichannel pipette.\nAllow infection to proceed for 5–6 h.\nReplace the infection medium with 100 μL/well of fresh growth medium.\nAllow cells to grow in TC incubator until time of SRB assay (Day 5–7).\nNote: To build a growth curve over several days, remember to dedicate a separate 96-well plate for each consecutive day.\nSequential infections.",
    "Note: Sequential infections are beneficial when improved efficiency is needed, for transduction of different vectors, or when dealing with transduction-resistant cells.\nAllow the first infection to proceed for 3–5 h.\nDuring this time, store the virus supernatant destined for the second infection at 4°C.\nAspirate the first virus medium and replace it with the second virus.\nIncubate cells for additional 3–5 h.\nReplace the infection medium with fresh growth medium.\nNote: The results presented in this protocol- protein analysis, SRB assays, and ChIP assay -were all derived from single-round infections.\nDay 5\nTesting SYO-1 and CDS-X1 cells infection efficiency by direct lysis and western blotting.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Efficient lentiviral SS18-SSX2 depletion and DUX4 overexpression in sarcoma cells with one round of infection following the calcium phosphate/BES method\n(A) Immunoblot shows SS18-SSX2 depletion with sh-lentiviral vectors PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 in SYO-1 cells. PLKO.1-TRC2 is the non-target control vector. SS18-SSX2 band intensities were quantified after subtracting background values in ImageJ software. Each value was then measured as a ratio relative to the intensity of the corresponding actin in the panel below. Finally, the relative SS18-SSX2 intensity ratios of PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 were compared to the relative ratio of the control PLKO.1-TRC2 that was designated as 1.\n(B) Immunoblot shows inducible expression of lentiviral DUX4 in CDS-X1 sarcoma cells. DOX is doxycycline. β-actin (Actin) served as loading control.\nNote: We normally assess infection efficiency and protein expression by western blotting. DUX4 overexpression with pCW57.1-DUX4-CA in CDS-X1 cells, and SS18-SSX2 depletion with PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 vectors in SYO-1 cells, are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nPlace the 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 37°C to thaw.\nNote: Return the sample buffer to the −20°C freezer immediately after use.\nTake the infected SYO-1 and CDS-X1 cells out of the 37°C incubator.",
    "Under light microscope, thoroughly examine every dish and estimate the density of adherent/surviving cells in every dish; write this percentage on the lid of the dish with a magic marker (e.g., 30%, 50%, 80%, etc.).\nMake a mental or written note of the extent of dead/floating cells in every dish.\nNote: This visual test is very beneficial as it provides first clues of a growth phenotype caused by the transduced vectors. Recording percentage of cell confluency helps determine the appropriate volume of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer later used for direct cell lysis.\nPlace cells on working bench and aspirate growth medium.\nWash the cells three times with ice-cold 1× PBS.\nDecant the last PBS wash.\nTilt the dish and let it stand on the bench to drain the remaining PBS.\nAspirate the last of PBS.\nAdd to each dish the quantity of 2× SDS sample buffer adjusted according to cell density written on the lid. For example, if a 100% confluent dish that would count 8 × 106–107 cells is lysed in 1 mL 2× SDS-PAGE buffer, a 50% confluent dish is lysed in 0.5 mL SDS-PAGE buffer.\nScrape the lysed cells with a cell lifter.\nPlace cell lysate in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nBoil lysate at 95°C for 5 min, pulse spin tubes to set the condensation at the tube lids and store the lysates at −20°C until time of loading on SDS-PAGE gel for western transfer.\nNote: Frozen protein lysates are stable, they can be used in several immunoblots and withstand re-freezing. However, it is best to avoid re-boiling and instead warm the lysates at 50°C–60°C for 3–5 min in subsequent western blots to protect some labile proteins (e.g., ETV4) that degrade upon frequent boiling.",
    "Load and run on SDS-PAGE gel equal volumes of lysates which, according to the lysis method described above (i.e., adjusting lysate volumes to cell density), should contain equal protein concentrations. Assess protein expression levels by immunoblotting. Include a loading control (β-actin) for quantification of relative band intensities.\nQuantify changes in protein expression by comparing band intensities in ImageJ imaging analysis software.\nNote: For protein content, we estimate that on average, lysis of a fully confluent 100 mm dish that contains ∼107 adherent (non-round) cells yields ∼1 mg protein. Thus, 50 μL of ∼1 mg/mL lysate are used to load ∼50 μg of protein in a lane. We often study labile proteins that include transcription factors with short half-lives. Direct lysis and boiling in the protein sample buffer that contains 4% SDS and the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol protect and allow detection of unstable proteins that would otherwise be rapidly degraded in standard RIPA buffer, despite protective supplements such as protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Therefore, determining the volume of lysis buffer for every dish based on cell density estimate is a reliable method for equal protein loading. It does however require a practiced eye and a long-standing habit of observing cells under a microscope.\nAlternatives: Lysis with RIPA buffer and the Bradford assay for protein quantification are excellent alternatives to the direct lysis method, provided the tested cellular proteins are stable.\nDay 5–7\nThe SRB assay was developed by Vichai and Kirtikara5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] for cytotoxicity screening. We have been successfully applying this method to measure the effects of a variety of lentiviral vectors on cell proliferation. We also use this assay to build drug dose-response curves.",
    "One main advantage of the SRB assay is its performance in 96-well plates, which allows the inclusion of several experimental groups and acquisition of multiple data points for each group in one plate, two important criteria for reproducibility and statistical significance. SRB is a bright pink dye that binds basic amino acid residues under acidic conditions. It measures cellular protein content, and the dye intensity is proportional to cell mass. It is a highly sensitive assay and gives linear readings for cell densities ranging from 1,000 cells to 180,000 cells/well. With this wide room for growth, we can measure cell proliferation over several days under diverse conditions.\nFigures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A show the effect of SS18-SSX2 depletion by lentiviral PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 on SYO-1 growth. Cell growth was measured in SRB assays over three days (Days 5, 6, and 7), as detailed below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. SRB assay to measure effect of SS18-SSX2 depletion on SYO-1 cell growth\nGrowth was measured 2 days (Day 5), 3 days (Day 6), and 4 days (Day 7) after infection of SYO-1 cells with lentiviral vectors PLKO.1-shSS18-1, PLKO.1-shSSX2-2, and PLKO.1-TRC2 (control) on Day 3, as described in the text.\n(A and B) (A) Shows digital images of SRB-stained 96-well plates of infected SYO-1, and (B) displays corresponding absorbance reads at 570 nm on the respective days.

Twenty wells were allocated to each vector in one plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Repeat the wash three more times.\nLet the open plate air dry for 16–18 h, at 20°C–22°C.\nNote: The dry plate can be stored indefinitely at 20°C–22°C after fixation.\nCell staining.\nAdd 100 μL of 0.057% SRB solution to each well.\nLet the plate stain flat on the bench for 30 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWashes.\nBring to the sink: the stained plate, 500 mL of 1% acetic acid, and a stack of paper towels.\nInvert the plate in the sink to empty the SRB solution.\nWash the plate four times with 1% acetic acid, as described for the water washes.\nRemember to fill the wells by pouring the acid solution from the side, by tilting the plate.\nLet the plate air dry for 16–18 h on the bench at 20°C–22°C.\nNote: The dry plate can be stored indefinitely at 20°C–22°C.\nAbsorbance measurement (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nAdd 200 μL of 10 mM Tris to each well.\nAgitate the plate on a bench shaker at 20°C–22°C for 5 min to dissolve the SRB stain.\nPlace the plate in a microplate reader, measure absorbance at wavelength 490 nm–570 nm.\nNote: We routinely measure our assays at 570 nm wavelength, with consistent results. In the event the reads at 570 nm appear to be outside the linear range, a lower wavelength such as 490 nm is a good alternative.\nAlternatives: The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthazolk-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay has commonly been used to measure changes in cell viability/proliferation. This assay in general represents a good alternative to the SRB assay. However, its high sensitivity to labile metabolic conditions could be a source of false apparent fluctuations in viability/growth.\nData analysis and graphing (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nSave the absorbance data in Excel.",

In this protocol we describe detailed steps of a CHIP experiment performed in SYO-1 cells transduced with the lentiviruses PLKO.1-TRC2 (non-target control), PLKO.1-shSS18-1, PLKO.1-shSSX2-2, to study the effect of SS18-SSX2 depletion on ETV5 binding to a recently discovered specific site located in intron 1 of the E2F1 gene locus (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B). This question arose when we discovered that E2F1 expression (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A) was significantly reduced upon SS18-SSX2 depletion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), whereas ETV5 levels were increased in the same SYO-1 cells.",
    "Note: We have used this method to determine cell cycle genes occupancy by transcription factors such as Capicua (CIC), ETV5 and E2F1 in naïve and lentivirus transduced sarcoma cells. The method is a modified version of the original protocol published by the Young laboratory.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] It was adjusted to fit a ChIP experiment with 1.5 × 107–2.5 × 107 cells or the equivalent of five 100 mm dishes at 40%–50% confluency. This cell number is sufficient for four individual IP reactions. It is critical to conduct ChIP experiments with actively growing cells at ∼ 40%–50% density unless it is specifically intended for analysis during quiescence (full confluency).\nCritical: Cleaning of work surfaces and instruments: it is imperative to conduct any experiment that involves an extremely sensitive assay such as PCR in a clean, uncontaminated environment. Before the start of the ChIP experiment, thoroughly wipe the working surfaces and pipet aids with a 10% bleach solution (100 mL Clorox bleach/900 mL milli-Q water in a spray bottle). In addition, use RNAse-free and DNAse-free plasticware such as plastic pipettes, filtered (aerosol barrier) pipette tips, gloves (rub gloved hands every now and then with a spray of 10% bleach).\nDay 5\nNote: The quantities suggested throughout were fitted for 1.5 × 107–2.5 × 107 cells or the equivalent of 4–5× 100 mm dishes at 40%–50% confluency.

Chromatin shearing with MISONIX XL 2000\nImages show sonicated DNA in two independent ChIP experiments with 10 s × 10 pulse cycles and 3-min pauses between cycles. DNAs were run next to a 100 bp DNA ladder and a 1 kb DNA ladder (left image).\nNote: Below details describe chromatin sonication using a Misonix XL-2000 sonicator. Refer to Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for illustration.\nAdjust the sonicator gauge to middle power- level 5.\nPlace the ice bucket containing the two tubes under the sonicator probe.",
    "Open one tube and with one hand hold it steady, centered (avoid touching the sides), with the probe tip near the bottom of the tube to prevent foam formation, as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nPulse for 10 s.\nReturn the tube to ice immediately and pulse the second tube for 10 s.\nSet the timer for a pause/cooling period of 3 min.\nNote: Pause time can be prolonged beyond 3 min to allow a larger number of tubes sufficient time to cool between pulses.\nRepeat this cycle nine more times, for a total of 10 × 10 s pulses.\nNote: The suggested sonication program is adequate for our ChIP-PCR or ChIP-qPCR assays as it reproducibly generates DNA fragments in the required size range (200 bp-600 bp; Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Sonication conditions must be optimized if different sonicators or a bioruptor are used for shearing chromatin.\nCritical: Chromatin sonication conditions are optimized before beginning the ChIP project. For this, 50 μL–100 μL aliquots of lysates representing various sonication conditions are processed following steps 16 (h-l), 19, and 20 (below, with volumes adjusted accordingly), to obtain purified DNA. The size range of the sonicated DNAs is determined by electrophoresis on 1%–1.5% agarose gels. Once the optimal sonication conditions are established, the size of sheared DNA can be confirmed at the end of the ChIP assay by running 5 μL–10 μL of the input (whole cell extract; WCE) sample on an agarose gel.\nAfter sonication, add to each tube 1/10th volume of 10% Triton-X (100 μL).\nRotate tubes for 10 min at 4°C.\nSpin the lysates for 10 min at 20,000 × g in cold microcentrifuge.\nPool the supernatants in a 15 mL conical tube on ice.\nSave 50 μL of the lysate as WCE input control and store at −80°C.",

The lysate thus prepared is sufficient for up to four IP reactions.\nAdd antibodies to the tubes and incubate while rotating for 16–18 h at 4°C.\nNote: We generally use 3–5 μg of antibody for 1 mL lysate.\nNext day: resuspend the BSA-blocked magnetic beads prepared on the previous day in cold LB3 (kept in the fridge from the day before), add equal amounts to the lysate/antibody IP tubes, and rock for 4 h at 4°C.\nCollect bead-bound chromatin complexes on a magnet and remove supernatant.\nWash beads with 1 mL cold RIPA buffer by rocking for 10 min at 4°C and repeat wash 3 times.\nWash beads with 1 mL cold TE (Tris/EDTA), containing 50 mM NaCl by inverting tubes 25 times.

    "Transfer 65 μL of the supernatant/eluate to a new tube and discard the beads. Incubate the eluates at 65°C for 16–18 h to reverse crosslinking.\nThaw the WCE/input tube (stored at −80°C), add 3× volume (150 μL) elution buffer, and incubate at 65°C for 16–18 h to reverse crosslinking.\nDay 7 to Day 8\nETV5-bound DNA cleaning and precipitation.\nNext day: add an equal volume TE; 65 μL to IP tubes and 200 μL to WCE.\nRNA digestion: add RNAse A (10 mg/mL) to 200 μg/mL final concentration to all tubes and incubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nProtein digestion: add proteinase K (20 mg/mL) to 200 μg/mL final concentration to all tubes and incubate at 55°C for 2 h.\nDNA cleaning: add 5 M NaCl to 200 mM final concentration to all tubes.

    "Add 500 μL of ice-cold 70% ethanol to DNA pellet and spin at maximum speed for 3 min at 4°C. Repeat the ethanol wash once and sediment the last of the remaining ethanol with a pulse spin, then carefully remove the extra alcohol with a thin tip.\nAllow the DNA pellet to air dry for a few minutes on the bench.\nAdd to each tube 30 μL–50 μL of molecular biology grade H2O (without disturbing the DNA pellet) and allow the DNA pellets to dissolve for 16–18 h at 4°C.\nNote: 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 may be used in place of H2O to immediately dissolve DNA, with pipetting, a brief vortex, then a pulse spin.\nNext day: mix dissolved DNA by pipetting, a brief vortex, followed by a pulse spin.\nMeasure DNA concentration in a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.\nNote: Glycogen may lower the 260/280 ratio; however, phenol/chloroform cleaning should ensure DNA purity.\nPretesting the ChIP DNA with PCR before qPCR.\nNote: To save time and costly resources, we routinely test the quality of ChIP DNA in a semi-quantitative PCR reaction before the qPCR assay; we consider it as a consolidation of the results obtained in the accompanying qPCR.\nWe present as an example the PCR experiment in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B that we conducted on the ETV5-ChIP in SYO-1 cells. The results show an evident decrease in ETV5 specific binding to E2F1 intron 1 region upon SS18-SSX2 depletion with transduced vectors PLKO.1-shSS18-1, PLKO.1-shSSX2-2, compared to control PLKO.1- TRC2 vector.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2473-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

PLKO.1-TRC2 is non target control. Numbers under ETV5 image represent relative protein band intensities. ETV5 band intensities were quantified after subtracting background values in ImageJ software. Each value was then determined as a ratio relative to the intensity of the corresponding actin intensity in the panel below. Finally, the relative ratios of intensities of ETV5 in PLKO.1-shSS18-1 and PLKO.1-shSSX2-2 cells were compared to that of the relative ratio of ETV5 intensity in control PLKO.1-TRC2 that was designated as 1.\n(B) semi-quantitative PCR that shows ETV5 specific binding to E2F1 first intron, performed on DNA purified from ETV5/R-IgG ChIP in naïve SYO-1 cells. The IP lanes are designated as R (rabbit)-IgG control and ETV5 (specific rabbit antibody. The DNA band represents a PCR-amplified intron 1 region of the E2F1 gene that contains an ETV5 binding site. The primers used were: E2F1-E12-Forward: 5′- AGGTAGAAGCTGCCTAACTG-3′, and E2F1-E12-Reverse: 5′- TGCTGCTGATGGGGTTAAATG-3′.
