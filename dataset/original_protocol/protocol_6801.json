Autoclave and let cool to 37 °C or room temperature.Supplement all LB with 100 µg/ml ampicillin before use.Inoculate 300 ml LB with bacterial glycerol stock of ccPEB1a and grow overnight for ~16 h at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm.Inoculate LB with the overnight culture from Step B3 to a final absorbance of 0.1 at 600 nm. Dilute 200 µl of cell culture 5 times with LB for absorbance measurements.",
    "Induce cells with 1 mM freshly prepared IPTG when the absorbance reaches 0.8.Let cultures grow for 3 h at 37 °C and 16 h at 18 °C with shaking at 250 rpm.Harvest cells by centrifuging for 15 min at 3,326 × g at 4 °C in Avanti JXN-26 centrifuge using JLA-8.1000 fixed-angle rotor. Use 10 ml of Resuspension buffer (see Recipe 1) per 2 L bacterial cell cultures to resuspend the pellets.Add 100 µg/ml lysozyme.Incubate on ice for 30 min and dilute 1:3 (v:v) with deionized water.Centrifuge for 30 min at 3,578 × g in Avanti JXN-26 centrifuge using JA-20 fixed-angle rotor at 4 °C to pellet the debris. The supernatant still has some particulate matter and is very viscous. A second identical centrifugation step can further clarify the supernatant, prevent clogging the column, and extend the life of the resin.Mix supernatant with 3-5 ml of Ni-NTA resin washed with 3 × 5 column volumes (CV) of water and 1 × 5 CV of wash buffer (see Recipe 2) in a beaker and stir gently on a stirrer plate for 1 h at 4 °C using a magnetic stir bar.Assemble the XK20/16 column as described in the manufacturer’s instructions and slowly pour the resin slurry in, pulling the flow-through with a syringe.Wash with 5 CV of Wash buffer by pulling the flow-through with a syringe.Elute proteins using 3 CV Elution buffer (see Recipe 3) by gravity.Concentrate the sample in an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal filter with a 10K molecular weight cutoff until the volume reaches < 500 µl. Determine the protein concentration by measuring absorbance at 280 nm in a spectrophotometer. Calculate protein’s extinction coefficient and molecular weight using the online Expasy Protparam tool from Expasy Bioinformatics Resource Portal.",
    "Centrifuge the protein solution at 49,192 × g at 4 °C for 15 min in Optima MAX-XP Tabletop Ultracentrifuge using TLA-100.3 fixed-angle rotor. Aspirate the protein solution using a 1 ml pipette without disturbing the pellet of protein aggregates.Polish the protein by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) using Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column, following pre-equilibration of Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in 50 ml of SEC buffer (see Recipe 4). Set the flow rate and pressure limit of the column according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and 2 MPa pressure limit are ideal for this column. Monitor protein elution by following absorbance at 280 nm and collect 0.4 ml fractions.Collect the peak fractions and immediately proceed with the labeling procedure. The protein should come out as a monomer (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210329/20210329235412_6965.jpgFigure 2. SEC profile of monomeric PEB1a eluting from the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column ccPEB1a labelingResuspend 1,000 nmol dried LD555 or LD655 in 100 µl DMSO to a 10 mM final concentration. Vortex until the dye chunks disappear. Aliquot in 10 µl aliquots and store at -20 °C.Thaw aliquots of LD555 and LD655 dyes and mix with freshly SEC-purified ccPEB1a protein at 1:1:1 (mol:mol:mol) ratio. The molar ratio can be empirically optimized depending on the labeling efficiency. Note that there are no reducing agents in the SEC buffer because they can reduce the labeling efficiency. Thus, solvent-exposed cysteine residues may oxidize over time and it is critical to mix the protein solution with maleimide reagents immediately after elution from SEC.Wrap the Eppendorf tube in aluminum foil and incubate on a rotator for 45 min-1 h.Purify labeled monomeric ccPEB1a from the unreacted dye by SEC, following pre-equilibration of Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL as described in Step B17 of the ‘ccPEB1a purification’ section.",
    "Use the same flow rate and pressure limits as in Step B17.Concentrate labeled protein to ~5 µM using Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal filter with 10K molecular weight cutoff.If the ccPEB1a protein variant binds substrate with dissociation constant < 5 µM, dialyze the protein against 4,000-fold SEC buffer in a 4 L bucket using dialysis membrane tubing with a 12-14 kDa molecular weight cutoff to remove bound L-aspartate. Incubate 15 cm tubing in distilled water for 30 min. Rinse the tubing with distilled water and close one end with a dialysis tubing clip. After making sure the clip is tight and there are no leaks, load the protein solution. Fold the excess tubing over itself, leaving a 2 cm space on top of the protein solution, and close it with a clip. Invert the assembly 1-2 times to ensure no leaks and place it into a beaker filled with SEC buffer. Replace the buffer three times every 4 h.Measure the protein sample absorption at 280 nm, 555 nm (LD555), and 655 nm (LD655). Use the extinction coefficients of the protein and the dyes: 150,000 cm-1 M-1 (LD555) and 250,000 cm-1 M-1 (LD655) to calculate their respective concentrations and determine labeling efficiency.Aliquot labeled protein in 20 µl aliquots and flash freeze in liquid N2. Store in liquid N2 until use.Preparation of the liposome stocksMix 4 ml (100 mg) of E. coli Polar Lipid Extract and 1.33 ml (33 mg) of Egg PC (stored at -80 °C in chloroform) at a final 3:1 (w:w) ratio in a 100 ml round bottom flask. Use glass pipettes to transfer chloroform solutions. Dry the mixture using a rotary evaporator, rotating the flask for ~30 min under vacuum; lipids will form a thin film on the flask’s walls.",
    "Cover the flask opening loosely with foil and leave in a dry-seal vacuum desiccator connected to vacuum overnight.To hydrate the lipid film, add 33.25 ml of Resting buffer (see Recipe 6) to the round bottom flask to achieve a final concentration of 4 mg/ml lipids. To facilitate the lipid film hydration process, perform freeze/thaw cycles as follows: freeze the lipid suspension by immersing the flask into the liquid nitrogen. You can prepare a liquid nitrogen bath in a thermal flask or an ice bucket. Use a thermal glove to hold the flask by its neck or use a vapor tube extender as you lower it into the liquid nitrogen. The lipid suspension will make a sound akin to an egg on a frying pan as it freezes. Once the noise subsides in 1-2 min, the suspension is fully frozen. Transfer the flask into a water bath at room temperature to thaw the suspension. Video 1 showcases the setup we use. Repeat freeze/thaw cycles 10 times until the lipid film on the flask sides disappears, and the suspension is turbid white color.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Preparation of liposomes stocks for protein reconstitution Aliquot liposomes in 1 ml aliquots, flash-freeze in liquid N2, and store at -80 °C until further use.Reconstitution of sodium/aspartate symporter, GltPh, into liposomes and encapsulation of ccPEB1aPurify N278C/C321A GltPh single cysteine mutant (cysGltPh), as previously described (Akyuz et al., 2013), with a few modifications below.Repeat Steps B1-B4 with 12 L of LB instead of 4 L and inoculate LB with a cysGltPh glycerol stock.Induce with 20 mM of L-arabinose for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm.Lyse the cells in cysGltPh Resuspension buffer (see Recipe 10) using the EmulsiFlex C3 cell disruptor. 4 passes are usually enough to disrupt the majority of the cells.",
    "Centrifuge the cell suspension for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C in Optima L-100XP Ultracentrifuge using Type 45 Ti Fixed-Angle Titanium Rotor to pellet the membranes.Homogenize crude cell membranes in Solubilization buffer (see Recipe 11) supplemented with 40 mM n-dodecyl β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) for 1 h at 4 °C and remove the insoluble material by centrifuging for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C in Optima L-100XP Ultracentrifuge using Type 45 Ti Fixed-Angle Titanium Rotor.Mix the supernatant with 3-5 ml of Ni-NTA resin and assemble the column as described in Steps B11-B12.Wash with 5 CV of Solubilization buffer supplemented with 1 mM DDM and 40 mM imidazole and elute in the presence of 250 mM imidazole.Incubate for ~16 h at 21 °C with thrombin at 10 units per mg protein to cleave the His-tag.Purify cleaved cysGltPh by SEC using Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated in 50 ml cysGltPh SEC buffer (see Recipe 5).Thaw aliquots of maleimide-PEG11-biotin and NEM and mix with freshly purified cysGltPh protein at 1:2:4 (mol:mol:mol) protein:maleimide-PEG11-biotin:NEM ratio. Note that there are no reducing agents in the SEC buffer, and cysteine residues may oxidize over time. Thus, it is critical to mix the protein solution with maleimide reagents immediately after elution from SEC.Purify labeled cysGltPh from the unreacted reagents by SEC, using pre-equilibrated Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column.Concentrate labeled transporter to 4 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal filter with 100K molecular weight cutoff.Take out 1 ml liposome aliquot (4 mg/ml) and extrude through 400 nm membranes using a mini-extruder as shown in the video (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/video/life-science/avanti-mini-extruder.html[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/video/life-science/avanti-mini-extruder.html]). 21 passes should yield uniformly sized unilamellar liposomes.Destabilize liposomes by adding Triton X-100 at 1:2 (w:w) detergent to lipid ratio.",
    "Add cysGltPh to liposomes at a 1:1000 (w:w) PLR and incubate on a rotator at room temperature for 30 min. Adjust PLR to enrich the liposome population with one transporter per vesicle. We detail calculations in Ciftci et al. (2020).Wash Bio-Beads extensively with 10 CV ethanol and 20 CV water before use in a 50 ml tube. Invert the slurry 2-3 times, let the beads settle at the bottom, and aspirate the supernatant with a pipettor. Add the beads at a 100 mg/ml final concentration to the liposome suspension and incubate on a rotator at room temperature for 2 h. It is critical not to add too many beads to avoid lipid loss, which would reduce the yield of proteoliposomes.Transfer the liposome solution from the beads using a 1 ml pipettor into a new cryovial. Repeat Steps C17 and C18 for5 more times using fresh beads at 4 °C.Pellet proteoliposomes by centrifugation at 49,192 × g at 4 °C for 1 h in Optima MAX-XP Tabletop Ultracentrifuge using TLA-100.3 fixed-angle rotor.Remove supernatant and resuspend proteoliposomes in an equal volume of the Resting buffer, freeze in liquid N2 and thaw in a water bath at room temperature.Repeat Steps C20 and C21 twice more.Pellet proteoliposomes as above and resuspend at 25 mg/ml in 160 µl of the Resting buffer.Add fluorescently labeled ccPEB1a from Step C8 to a final concentration of 0.6 µM and encapsulate by 2 freeze/thaw cycles as above. Two freeze/thaw cycles should result in up to 30 % encapsulation efficiency (Colletier et al., 2002; Chaize et al., 2004; Costa et al., 2014). Increasing the number of the freeze/thaw cycles might lead to improved encapsulation efficiency but might also result in an increased fraction of the denatured ccPEB1a.",
    "We found that the current procedure allows us to image up to 500 vesicles in a single sm-FRET recording, sufficient for efficient data collection. Proteoliposomes can be stored at -80 °C at this step until further use.Pellet proteoliposomes by centrifugation as above to remove unencapsulated PEB1a. Replace the supernatant with an equal volume of the Resting buffer.Extrude proteoliposomes (21 passages) through 100 nm membranes using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Proteoliposomes can be stored at 4 °C for up to 5-6 h before use. You can verify the liposome integrity and size distribution by negative-stain or cryo-EM. Representative images are shown in Figure S7 in Ciftci et al. (2020).Single-molecule experimentsThe preparation of quartz microscope slides and glass coverslips functionalized with PEG-biotin for TIRF microscopy is based on published methods (Joo and Ha, 2012).We performed all single-molecule FRET imaging experiments using a home-built prism-based TIRF microscope constructed around a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope body, as described previously (Juette et al., 2016). Step-by-step guides on building a prism-based single-molecule TIRF microscopy setup are available (Selvin and Ha, 2008; Axelrod, 2008; Roy et al., 2008).Passivate the quartz slides using a solution of 1 µM BSA and 1 µM duplex DNA in 150 µl of T50 buffer (see Recipe 9) by flowing the mixture through the injection port and incubating for 5 min. Further details can be found in Blanchard et al. (2004) and Joo and Ha (2012). Wash away excess BSA and DNA by flowing 150 µl of T50 buffer through the injection port.To image non-specifically attached liposomes, flow no more than 10 µl of the proteoliposome suspension from Step E25. Keep a record of the sample quantity you have used in this step.Immediately wash the surface with 150 µl of Resting buffer to remove unattached proteoliposomes.",
    "Image attached molecules at 100 mW laser power at 10 Hz temporal resolution for a total of 300 s.Photobleach non-specifically attached molecules by imaging the entire immobilization surface at 600 mW laser power and wash the chamber with 150 µl of T50 buffer.Flow 150 µl of pre-mixed 0.8 µM streptavidin and 1 µM duplex DNA solution in T50 buffer and incubate for 5-10 min.Wash away excess streptavidin-duplex DNA with 150 µl of T50 buffer and 150 µl of the Resting buffer before attaching proteoliposomes.Flow the same volume of the liposomes as in Step F4. Immediately wash the surface with 150 µl Resting buffer to remove unattached proteoliposomes. If necessary, flow a more concentrated sample or increase the sample volume to reach the appropriate single-molecule density. At optimal density, the fraction of molecules rejected in gettraces module of SPARTAN should be ~40% (see Data analysis and the online SPARTAN manual). If injecting larger sample amounts, re-check non-specific attachment (Steps F4-F7) using a matching sample.Image attached molecules at 100 mW laser power at 10 Hz temporal resolution for a total of 300 s and determine the number of molecules that specifically and non-specifically attach to the surface (Data analysis). Ideally, the non-specifically attached fluorescent particles imaged in Step F6 should be < 25% of the specifically attached molecules.Supplement the Non-activating and Activating buffers (see Recipes 7-8) with an oxygen-scavenging system consisting of 2 mM PCA and 50 nM PCD (Aitken et al., 2008).Image proteoliposomes to test for leakage by flowing 50 µl of the Non-activating buffer approximately 3 s after the start of the movie. Trace amounts of detergent left after Steps E17-E18 can allow L-asp to spontaneously diffuse into liposomes and lead to changes in FRET efficiency of encapsulated ccPEB1a in the absence of the active sodium-driven uptake.",
    "If a significant number of single-molecule trajectories (>10%) show FRET efficiency changes at this step, discard the liposomes and increase the amount of bio-beads or the number of bio-beads incubation cycles in your next preparation. Do not exceed 200 mg/ml of bio-beads in each round. If 200 mg/ml of bio-beads is still not enough, increase the number of incubation rounds. Carefully observe the turbidity level of liposome preparations after each round. A significant reduction in turbidity indicates the adsorption of liposomes to the excess bio-beads. We have observed that 6 rounds using 100 mg/ml bio-beads are enough to remove Triton X-100 detergent from our liposome preparations. This number can differ depending on the nature of detergent used to solubilize liposomes and incubation temperature. Detergents with higher critical micelle concentration (CMC) are easier to remove. One can check the remaining detergent in liposome preparations using a colorimetric assay (Urbani and Warne, 2005). We have observed that slight temperature variations (by a temperature-controlled chamber) can lead to significant differences in the detergent removal efficiency.Image proteoliposomes to measure transport by flowing 50 µl of the Activating buffer approximately 3 s after the start of the movie. Adjust the time resolution and the total duration of movies depending on the transporter’s turnover rate. For cysGltPh variants with turnover times of ~30-100 s, we use the laser power of 20 mW at 2.5 Hz temporal resolution. At this laser power, the mean photobleaching time is ~300 s. For variants with turnover times of ~1 s, we use laser power of 75 mW at 10 Hz, resulting in the mean photobleaching time of ~60 s.Wash the sample chamber with 2 ml of Resting buffer and photobleach any remaining fluorescent molecules as in Step F7 before attaching new proteoliposomes for the next round of transport recordings.",
