    "Transformation of BL21 codon plus (DE3) RIPL cells Thaw chemically competent BL21 codon plus (DE3) RIPL cells and the plasmid (pGEX-6P-1) on ice for 10 min.Add 50 μL of the bacterial suspension into a polypropylene round-bottom sterile tube. Further, add 1 μL (~100 ng) of the desired plasmid [either full-length amphiphysin 1 (Amph1) or the N-BAR domain encoded into a pGEX-6P-1 vector] directly into the bacterial suspension. Incubate the mixture on ice for 20 min. Do not vortex.Incubate the bacteria at 42 °C in a water bath for precisely 45 s and put the tube directly on ice for 20 min.Add 1 mL of SOC medium and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h in a shaker at 250 rpm.Spread 100 μL of the transformation reaction mixture onto a prewarmed LB agar plate containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL; see Recipes).Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 16 h.After transformation, the agar plates can be stored for one week at 4 °C. Expression of full-length Amph1/Amph1 N-BAR in E. coli Prepare the starter culture by inoculating a single colony of the transformed bacteria into 100 mL of autoclaved LB media supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) and chloramphenicol (0.035 mg/mL) (see Recipes). Incubate the culture at 37 °C in a shaker at 250 rpm for 12–16 h.Note: We prepare stock solutions of ampicillin (25 mg/mL) in Milli Q water and chloramphenicol (35/mL) in absolute ethanol and store them in a -20 °C freezer. Required volume of the stock solution to the culture media can be added to achieve final working concentration of ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) and chloramphenicol (0.035 mg/mL). Inoculate 4 × 1 L of autoclaved LB broth containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) and chloramphenicol (0.035 mg/mL) with 25 mL of starter culture.",
    "Grow the secondary culture at 37 °C in a shaker at 225 rpm.Using a UV Vis spectrophotometer and disposable cuvettes, monitor the optical density at the wavelength of 600 nm every 1 h. Once the OD600 reaches a value of ~0.5 (approximately 3 h), reduce the incubator temperature to 18 °C and wait (another 20 min) for the OD600 to reach approximately 0.8.Make an aqueous stock solution of IPTG by dissolving 300 mg of IPTG in 10 mL of autoclaved water. Add 2.5 mL of the stock solution to each 1 L of culture to obtain 0.3 mM final IPTG concentration. Also, add 1 mL from the 25 mg/mL stock solution of ampicillin and 0.25 mL from the 35 mg/mL stock solution of chloramphenicol to each 1 L culture. Incubate the flasks at 18 °C with shaking (225 rpm) for 12–16 h.Divide the culture between multiple centrifuge bottles. Harvest the cells by centrifugation using a Sorvall SO-RC5B centrifuge equipped with a PTI F10S rotor, operated at 6,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and proceed with the next step. The pellet can be stored at -80 °C after transferring into 50 mL conical tubes and flash freezing with liquid nitrogen. Thaw the frozen bacterial cell pellet obtained from the post-induction of secondary culture on ice for 2–3 h.Purification of full-length Amph1/Amph1 N-BAR Cell Lysis:  Resuspend the pellet in 60–80 mL of GST lysis buffer [see Recipes; use buffer without glycerol for full-length Amph1 and buffer containing 10% glycerol (v/v) for Amph1 N-BAR] supplemented with 1 mM of PMSF (see Recipes). Break any clumps by pipetting up and down. Transfer the suspension into a metallic beaker.",
    "Sonicate the suspension using a tip sonicator at an amplitude value set between 30 and 50 for 5 min with a 1 s pulse on and 4 s pulse off cycle (25 min total sonication time). The maximum power output of the sonicator we use is 700 watts and, for a 1 s pulse at amplitude of 50, approximately 3.5 J is delivered to the probe. The sonication should be performed on ice to prevent heating of the suspension. Ensure the sonicator tip remains well immersed in the solution throughout the entire sonication process to prevent frothing. At the end of the sonication cycle, the lysed suspension should turn from light yellow to orangish and less viscous than the starting mixture. Continue the sonication for an additional 1–2 min if mixture still looks yellowish or seems to be similarly viscous as before.Transfer the suspension into high-speed centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 30,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C, using an SS34 8 × 50 rotor to pellet cell debris.After centrifugation, filter the supernatant (hereafter cell lysate) through the 0.22 μm syringe filter to remove the particulate matter.Note: Collect the cell pellet and cell lysate (~20 μL) samples for SDS-PAGE analysis. GST affinity chromatography:  Perform GST affinity chromatography using a fast protein liquid chromatographic (FPLC) system (ÄKTA purifier) with 2 × 5 mL GSTrapTM FF columns connected in a series. Pre-equilibrate the GSTrapTM FF column with five column volumes (CV) of GST lysis buffer [use buffer without glycerol for full-length Amph1 and buffer containing 10% glycerol (v/v) for Amph1 N-BAR9] prior to sample application.Apply the filtered cell lysate from Step C4 onto the column using an injection loop at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and monitor the absorbance at 280 nm (Figure 1A and Figure 2A).",
    "Collect the flowthrough 1 (FT1) and inject it onto the column, and again save flowthrough 2 (FT2).Wash the column with lysis buffer in order to remove the non-specifically bound protein. Washing should be performed until the UV absorption at 280 nm (UV_280) reaches a flat baseline (typically requires the passing of 100–150 mL of lysis buffer).Wash the column with GST wash buffer (30–50 mL; see Recipes) in order to bring the salt concentration down to 150 mM (can be monitored from the conductance of the mobile phase; a rapid reduction in the conductance indicates buffer switching).Elute the protein by passing elution buffer [see Recipes; use buffer without glycerol for full-length Amph1 and buffer containing 10% glycerol (v/v) for Amph1 N-BAR]. Start collecting elution as soon as the UV_280 signal starts increasing and collect until the signal reaches a flat baseline (~10–15 mL typically).Note: Typically, we maintain a flow rate of 1 mL/min for loading the cell lysate, 2 mL/min for loading FT1 and for the washing steps, and 1 mL/min for the elution step. One can also maintain 1 mL/min flow rate throughout all steps. Cleavage of GST tag by protease treatment:  Thaw an aliquot (125 μg) of PreScission protease from -80 °C storage and add the protease to the eluted protein solution. Keep the mixture for overnight shaking at 4 °C in order to cleave the GST affinity tag.Notes:  Keep a small (~20 μL) aliquot of the GST elution for running SDS-PAGE. Typically, addition of 125 μg of PreScission protease has shown complete cleavage of GST-tag when we purified proteins at a scale of 4 × 1 L expressions. In case there is a band of protein with uncleaved GST-tag still present after overnight protease treatment, one more aliquot of protease can be added.",
    "Collect samples (~20 μL) of FT2 and pre- and post-cleavage protein samples for SDS-PAGE analysis.Running SDS-PAGE analysis:  Mix the samples with loading buffer in a 1:5 ratio. Further, heat all the samples on a heating block set at approximately 95 °C for 5 min. Then, using gel-loading tips, load the samples into a 12% acrylamide gel along with pre-stained protein ladder. Run the gel at 200 V for 1 h using a running buffer (see Recipes). Stain the gel with GelCodeTM Blue safe protein stain and then destain with water to visualize the bands (Figure 1B and Figure 2D).Note: Molecular weights of full-length Amph1 and its N-BAR domain are 76 kDa and 29 kDa, respectively. GST has a molecular weight of 26 kDa. The full-length protein appeared slightly closer to the 110 kDa band and the N-BAR appeared closer to the 30 kDa band of the protein marker. Cation exchange chromatography:  Equilibrate the cation exchange column (5 mL) with cation exchange buffer A [see Recipes; without glycerol for full-length Amph1 and with 10% glycerol (v/v) for the N-BAR] and cation exchange buffer B [see Recipes; without glycerol for full-length Amph1 and with 10% glycerol (v/v) for the N-BAR]. A typical column equilibration program starts with 100 % buffer A and 0% buffer B (five column volumes); then, switches to 100% buffer B and 0% buffer A (five column volumes); and finally switches back to 100% buffer A and 0% buffer B (five column volumes). Also, equilibrate the injection loop with two loop volumes of buffer A.Inject the cleaved protein sample onto the column using an injection loop at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and collect the FT1. Repeat the same and save FT2.Wash the column with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm reaches baseline.",
    "Elute the protein with a linear gradient from 0% buffer B, 100% buffer A to 45% buffer B, and 55% buffer A over the course of a 100 mL elution volume and collect the fractions (Figure 1C and Figure 2B).Run the FT2 and fractions on SDS-PAGE (Figure 1E and Figure 2D).Pool the fractions containing the protein and concentrate using Amicon® ultra centrifugal filters (use molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa for N-BAR and 30 kDa for full-length Amph1) up to a final volume of 10 mL.Size exclusion chromatography:  Equilibrate the size exclusion column and the injection loop with size exclusion buffer (see Recipes; without glycerol for full-length Amph1 and with 10% glycerol for the N-BAR).Inject the pooled protein fractions post-cation exchange chromatography and after concentrations into the size exclusion column (Superdex 200) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.Elute the proteins and collect the fractions (Figure 1D and Figure 2C). Analyze the fractions using SDS-PAGE (Figure 1F and Figure 2E). Note: The BAR domain proteins often elute as two separate bands in size exclusion (Figure 2C). Samples from both these size exclusion bands usually appear as the same molecular weight species in SDS-PAGE, indicating that these bands are actually different oligomeric species. The dimer usually elutes at the end due to its smaller size than the larger oligomers. We recommend that the fractions under the different elution bands should be collected and concentrated separately to avoid mixing between various oligomers.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4699/bioprotoc-13-12-4699-g001.jpgFigure 1.

The extinction coefficients of full-length Amph1 and N-BAR are 55,000 M-1 cm-1 and 28,500 M-1 cm-1, respectively.Transfer the proteins into small aliquots, flash freeze into liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C."
