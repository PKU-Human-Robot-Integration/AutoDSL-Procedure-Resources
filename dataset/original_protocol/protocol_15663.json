    "The protocol described below follows the guideline of the human research ethics committee of the Université Paris-Saclay. Participants approved and signed a consent form.\n1. Participants\nInclude at least 15 healthy young adult participants in the experiment (aged 20 to 40 years old).\n\tNOTE: This recommended number of subjects corresponds to what is classically considered in the literature on GI.\nExclude participants with walking aids, visual, hearing, or orthopedic problems, identified neurological disorders, dementia, cognitive impairments (i.e., a score < 25 on the Mini Mental State Exam), and a medical history of falling.\nAsk participants to provide written consent after informing them of the nature and purpose of the experiment.\nEnsure that the experiment conforms to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.\n2. Laboratory preparation\nEnsure that the force platform is long enough to have the entire swing foot land on it at the end of the first step. If it is not, use two small distance force platforms, with participants standing in the initial posture on the first one and striking their swing foot on the second one placed in front of the first21. In both cases, ensure that the force platform(s) is/are embedded in a track at least 5 m long to ensure that steady-state walking is reached.\n\tNOTE: A force platform that registers the 3D moments and forces is necessary to compute the whole set of experimental variables (see section 5).\n\t\nAs a safety measure, affix a harness to the ceiling and center it to the grand axe of the force platform in case the experiment includes frail patients (e.g., neurological patients).\nCalibrate the force platform(s).

Experimental procedure\nAsk participants to stand barefoot and immobile on a force platform in their natural upright posture, with the arms hanging loosely against their sides, and their gaze directed to a target at eye level at least 5 m away (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Delineate the position of the feet on the force platform in the initial posture (e.g., with chalk). Carefully check that the participants reposition their feet on these marks after each trial. This point is important since the initial foot position influences the APA features of GI.",
    "Determine the participants' preferential starting leg by pushing lightly against the participants' back while in the initial posture with their eyes closed to provoke a step forward.\nExplain to the participants that the task they are to perform is to initiate gait from the standing posture with the preferred leg, to continue walking to the end of the track, and then to return quietly to the initial standing posture.\n\tNOTE: If during the experiment gait is not initiated with the identified preferred leg in a given trial, repeat the trial.\nExplain that gait is to be initiated following two successive signals (acoustic, visual, or tactile): a preparatory signal and a departure signal (see steps 3.6 and 3.7).\nExplain the instructions on velocity and temporal pressure (see steps 3.8-3.10).\nDeliver the first (preparatory) signal to the participants. Instruct them to stand immobile and avoid anticipating GI at this first signal.\nDeliver the second (departure) signal following a random 2-5 s delay after the preparatory signal.\n\t\nEnsure that the participants are visually immobile before delivering this second signal. Check immobility online with the time plots of the anteroposterior or mediolateral center of pressure displacement\n\t\tNOTE: If they are not immobile, detection of APA onset (step 5.1.1) may be difficult.\nInstruct the participants to either initiate gait i) as soon as possible (i.e., in a reaction time condition), or ii) only once they feel ready (i.e., in a self-initiated condition) following the departure signal.\nVary the conditions of \"temporal pressure\" imposed on GI (i.e., low temporal pressure (self-initiated condition) and high temporal pressure (reaction time condition)).\nVary the conditions of GI velocity (slow, spontaneous, fast conditions).",
    "To limit the number of experimental conditions and thus avoid fatigue, instruct the participants to perform only two conditions of GI velocity (e.g., slow and fast) under a low or high temporal pressure condition, or the reverse (i.e., GI at a slow or fast velocity under a high and a low temporal pressure condition).\n\t\tNOTE: Repeat the instructions on temporal pressure and GI velocity frequently.\nInstruct the participants to perform series of 10 successive trials in each experimental condition.\n\tNOTE: Series of five trials are sufficient for elderly subjects or patients with Parkinson's disease22.\n\t\nRandomize the conditions of GI velocity and temporal pressure across the participants to avoid order effects.\nImpose a rest of at least 2 min between successive conditions to avoid the effects of fatigue.\nIn each condition, allow participants to perform two familiarization trials before the recordings.\nTrigger data acquisition from the force platform a few seconds before the onset of the preparatory signal and stop once the participant has left the force platform.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64088/64088fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental setup.

    "Enter 100 in the label Number of Points for Normalization.\nClick on Execute.\nCompute the time plots of the instantaneous center of gravity accelerations along the anteroposterior (x''G), mediolateral (y''G), and vertical (z''G) directions from the 3D ground reaction forces obtained with the force platform (see Supplemental Figure S1) using Newton's second law10,23.\n\tNOTE: According to Newton's second law, the sum of the external forces applied to a system is equal to the mass of this system (m) multiplied by the acceleration of its center of gravity. Thus, with the GI protocol described in this study, the sole external forces applied to the participants are body weight (BW) and ground reaction forces (R). Equations (1), (2), and (3) can be written:\n\tx''G = Rx / m     (1)\n\ty''G = Ry / m     (2)\n\tz\"G = (Rz - BW) / m     (3)\n\tWhere Rx, Ry, Rz are the instantaneous anteroposterior, mediolateral, and vertical components of the vector ground reaction force, respectively. Typical plots of x''G, y''G, and z''G are shown in Figure 2.\nCompute the 3D time plots of the center of gravity velocity by means of a simple numerical integration of the 3D center of gravity acceleration time plots, using integration constants equal to zero (i.e., 3D initial center of gravity velocity considered as null10). See Figure 2 for typical time plots of anteroposterior, mediolateral, and vertical velocity of the center of gravity (x'G, y'G, and z'G, respectively).\nPerform an additional integration of the y'G time plot to obtain the displacement of the center of gravity along the mediolateral direction. Use this quantity to compute the \"margin of stability\" (see step 5.3.5.2).\nCompute the mediolateral (yP) and anteroposterior (xP) displacement of the center of pressure from force platform data using equations (4) and (5):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64088/64088eq01.jpg     (4)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64088/64088eq02.jpg     (5)",
    "Where Mx and My are the instantaneous moments around the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions, respectively; Rx, Ry, and Rz are the instantaneous anteroposterior, mediolateral, and vertical ground reaction forces, respectively; and dz is the distance between the surface of the force platform and its origin (provided by the manufacturer). Typical time plots of xP and yP are shown in Figure 2 (see also Supplemental Figure S2).\n5. Experimental variables\nNOTE: Each experimental variable described below must be extracted from the experimental time plots obtained for each trial.\nDetection of the timing events of gait initiation\n\t\nOnset of APA\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plots of the center of pressure displacement along the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions.\nCompute the mean value of the mediolateral and anteroposterior center of pressure time plot during the 250 ms time window preceding the second signal delivered to the participants.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These values correspond to the \"baseline values\" of these time plots.\nDetect the instants following the second signal when the mediolateral and the anteroposterior center of pressure displacement trace deviates 2.5 standard deviations from the baseline value for at least 50 ms.\n\t\t\tNOTE: These two instants correspond to the onset of APA along the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions (t0ML and t0AP, respectively; Figure 2). These two instants may also be identified as the instants when the time plots of the mediolateral and anteroposterior center of gravity acceleration reach 10% of their respective peak value.\nEnsure that, in the reaction time condition, the onset of APA ranges between 150 ms and 300 ms after the second (Go) signal. If not, repeat the trial and the instructions on temporal pressure.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If it is less than 150 ms, the participants have anticipated. If it is greater than 300 ms, the participants were not focused on the task.",
    "Ensure that in the self-initiated condition, the onset of APA is greater than 300 ms. If it is not, repeat the trial and the instructions on temporal pressure as the participants may have initiated gait in a reaction time condition.\nSwing heel-off time\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plots of the vertical center of gravity velocity and anteroposterior center of pressure displacement.\nIdentify the instant when the trace of the vertical center of gravity velocity first peaks downward after APA onset as the swing heel-off time24 (Figure 2). Alternatively, identify the instant when the time plot of the anteroposterior center of pressure displacement shows a rapid drop toward the baseline (i.e., toward the toes; Figure 2) or place a foot switch (an inexpensive tool) at the swing heel.\nSwing toe-off time\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plots of the mediolateral and anteroposterior center of pressure displacement and of the anteroposterior velocity of the center of gravity.\nIdentify the instant when the time plot of the mediolateral center of pressure displacement reaches a first (quasi) plateau directed toward the stance foot side as the swing toe-off time (Figure 2). Alternatively, identify the instant following swing heel-off when the time plot of the anteroposterior center of pressure displacement reaches 90% of the maximum backward value, or place a foot switch at the swing toe.\nSwing foot contact time\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plots of the anteroposterior center of pressure displacement.\nIdentify the instant when the anteroposterior center of pressure is abruptly shifted forward (Figure 2) as the swing foot contact time. If this time plot is derived, identify the swing foot contact time as the instant when this derived time plot increases sharply from its baseline level value. Alternatively, place a foot switch at the swing heel to detect this instant.",
    "NOTE: A method similar to that previously described above for APA detection (based on the computation of a mean baseline level value; step 5.1.1.2) can be used here.\nRear foot-off time\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plot of the mediolateral center of pressure displacement.\nIdentify the instant when the time plot of the mediolateral center of pressure displacement reaches a second (quasi) plateau, directed in the opposite direction as the first one (step 5.1.3.2; Figure 2), the rear foot-off time25. Alternatively, place a foot switch at the rear to detect this instant.\nComputation of temporal variables\n\t\nCompute the delay between the onset of APA (t0ML and t0AP) and the swing heel-off time (tHO) for both the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions, which correspond to the duration of APA along the mediolateral (dAPAML) and the anteroposterior directions (dAPAAP). See equations (6) and (7).\n\t\tdAPAML = tHO - t0ML     (6)\n\t\tdAPAAP = tHO - t0AP     (7)\nCompute the delay between swing toe-off time (tTO) and swing heel-off time (tHO), which corresponds to the \"unloading phase\" duration (UNLd; Figure 2) using equation (8).\n\t\tUNLd = tTO - tHO     (8)\nCompute the delay between swing toe-off time (tTO) and swing foot contact (tFC), which corresponds to the \"swing phase\" duration (SWINGd; Figure 2) using equation (9).\n\t\tSWINGd = tFC - tTO    (9)\nComputation of spatial variables\n\t\nInitial position of the center of pressure\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plots of the center of pressure displacement along the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions.\nCompute the mean values of the mediolateral (yP0) and anteroposterior (xP0) center of pressure positions during the 250 ms time window preceding the second (departure) signal delivered to the participants, which are representative of the center of pressure position in the initial posture (or \"baseline\" value).",
    "NOTE: The spatio-temporal features of APA described above are sensitive to the position of the center of pressure in the initial posture26. Hence, it is important to check that any change in the APA features between experimental conditions (e.g., a condition with an obstacle to clear vs. a condition without an obstacle to clear) or between experimental populations (e.g., healthy participants vs. neurological participants) cannot be ascribed to a \"simple\" change in the center of pressure position in the initial posture, but rather to the factor being investigated.\nAmplitude of APA\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plots of the center of pressure displacement and center of gravity velocity along the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions.\nDetect the instant when each of these four time plots reaches a maximal value during the APA time window (Figure 2).\nSubtract the mean center of pressure baseline value computed in step 5.3.1.2 (i.e., the xP0 and yP0 values) from the maximal center of pressure value detected during the APA time window (for each direction; i.e., compute using equations (10) and (11)).\n\t\t\txPAPA = xPMAX - xP0     (10)\n\t\t\tyPAPA = yPMAX - yP0     (11)\n\t\t\tWhere xPAPA and yPAPA are the amplitude of APA (center of pressure) along the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions, respectively; xPMAX and yPMAX are the maximal anticipatory center of pressure displacement along the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions, respectively.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: No such baseline subtraction is necessary for center of gravity velocity since it is considered that the participants are initially immobile (the initial center of gravity velocity is therefore null; see step 4.4). The four values obtained are representative of the amplitude of APA (two values per direction).\nStep length and step width\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plot of the center of pressure displacement along the anteroposterior direction.",
    "Detect the most backward position of the center of pressure position, xPBACK.\nDetect the center of pressure position at the time of rear foot-off, xPRFO (Figure 2 and step 5.1.5).\nCompute the spatial difference between these two quantities, which corresponds to step length, L41, using equation (12).\n\t\t\tL = xPBACK - Xprfo     (12)\nDisplay the time plot of the center of pressure displacement along the mediolateral direction.\nDetect the most lateral position of the mediolateral center of pressure position obtained during the first plateau of the time plot, yPSTANCE (\"stance\", because the center of pressure is located under the stance foot at that time; see Figure 2).\nDetect the lateral center of pressure position at the rear foot-off time, yPRFO (Figure 2 and step 5.1.5).\nCompute the spatial difference between these two quantities, which corresponds to step width, W25, using equation (13).\n\t\t\t​W = yPSTANCE - yPRFO     (13)\nPerformance of gait initiation\n\t\t\nDisplay the time plot of the center of gravity velocity along the anteroposterior direction (Figure 2).\nDetect the instant when the participants strike the force platform with the swing foot (step 5.1.4, Figure 2) and note the velocity of the center of gravity at this instant as a criterion of GI performance.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The peak value of this time plot, which is reached a few milliseconds after swing foot contact, can also be considered as a criterion of GI performance. Step length and swing phase duration can also be considered as criteria of GI performance. The longer and the shorter these quantities are, respectively, the better the performance is.\nStability control parameters",
    "For braking index, display the time plot of the center of gravity velocity along the vertical direction. Detect the peak downward center of gravity velocity of the time plot (z'GMIN) and the center of gravity velocity at the swing foot contact time (z'GFC, Figure 2). Compute the difference between these two quantities, termed the \"braking index\" (BI), as an indicator of stability control, using equation (14).\n\t\t\tBI = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64088/64088eq03.jpg     (14)\n\t\t\tNOTE: The BI was introduced by Do and colleagues and provides evidence that the central nervous system anticipates the swing foot strike with the support surface by decreasing the vertical center of gravity velocity during the swing phase of gait initiation4,5,27. This active braking facilitates stability maintenance after foot strike. The greater the BI, the better the stability control.\nFor the margin of stability, display the time plots of the center of gravity velocity and displacement along the mediolateral direction. Detect the velocity (y'GFC) and the displacement of the center of gravity (yGFC) at swing foot contact time (Figure 2). Compute the mediolateral component of the margin of stability (MOS) at foot contact using equation (15).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64088/64088eq04.jpg     (15)\n\t\t\tWhere BOSmax is the mediolateral boundary of the base of support (BOS) and ω0 is the eigenfrequency of the body, modeled as an inverted pendulum. During GI, participants systematically land on the force platform first with the swing heel, then with the toe. Under such a foot landing strategy, the BOSmax can be estimated with the mediolateral center of pressure position at the time of rear foot-off (step 5.1.5). The eigenfrequency of the body can be computed using equation (16).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64088/64088eq05.jpg     (16)\n\t\t\tWhere g = 9.81 m/s² is the gravitational acceleration and l is the length of the inverted pendulum, which corresponds to 57.5% of body height.",
    "NOTE: The quantity in brackets in equation (15) is termed the \"extrapolated center of mass\"18. The condition of the stability at foot contact implies that the extrapolated center of mass is located within the base of support. This condition corresponds to a positive MOS value. If the MOS is negative, corrective postural adjustments are required to recover balance.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
