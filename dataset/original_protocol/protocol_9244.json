  "procedures": [
    "1.Preparation of reagents\nPrepare Ca++ -free HL3.1 saline28.\n \nIn mM: 70 NaCl, 5 KCl, 20 MgCl2 , 10 NaHCO3 , 5 HEPES, 115 sucrose, and 5 trehalose; pH 7.2. Filter sterilize and store at 4°C.\n  Note: Ca++ -free solution prevents muscle contraction during dissection.\nMake poly-L-lysine (PLL) coverslips.\n \nDissolve 100mg PLL in 4.2ml water and make 300μl aliquots in Eppendorf tubes and freeze at -20°C.\nBefore coating coverslips, first thaw an aliquot, bring it up to 10ml in ddH2O and add 20μl of Kodak Photo-Flo; the final PLL concentration is 0.7 mg/ml.\nSubmerge coverslips for 30mins in PLL solution, remove and dry, then rinse briefly with water and dry. Repeat twice. Treated coverslips last approximately one month.\n2. Genetic crosses\nTo generate MARCM clones. Here is an example cross using a pan-DA driver11,27:\nFRT2A x hsFLP; Gal4109(2)80, UAS-mCD8::GFP; tub-Gal80 FRT2A/SM5-TM6B\nTo generate Flp-out clones. Here is an example cross using a class IV-specific driver8:\nppk-Gal4 x yw, hsFLP;UAS-FRT-CD2,y+-stop-FRT-mCD8::GFP\n3. Collection of embryos\nKeep Drosophila crosses in a collection bottle at 25°C and collect embryos on an apple juice agar plate29 spread with a thin layer of yeast paste30,31.\n4. Heat shock treatment of embryos\nPlace an empty plate in opposition to the apple juice agar plate upon which the embryos have been laid. Seal around these two plates with Parafilm (Fig. 2).\nDuring heat shock, submerge the plate in the water bath and hold it down using a metal weight.\nFor MARCM embryos\n \nCollect embryos for 2h and incubate in a 10cm petri dish surrounded by moistened tissues at 25°C for an additional 2h.\n  Note: Adjusting the heat shock protocol alters the frequency at which clones are generated.",
    "For a smaller number of clones, aiming for single isolated neurons, submerge and heat shock in the water bath for 1h at 38°C.\nFor a larger number of clones, heat shock for 45mins at 38°C, recover at RT 30mins, then heat shock again for an additional 30mins.\nCollect Flp-out embryos for 24h, and heat shock for 1h at 38°C.\n5. Screening for clones\nAfter heat shock, remove the lid of the water-tight arrangement and place the apple juice agar plate in a 10cm petri dish surrounded by moistened tissues. Culture the embryos and subsequent larvae at 25°C until wandering 3rd instar.\n Note: culture conditions, especially nutrition, have been shown to alter DA dendritic arbor morphology32,33. Make sure that growing larvae have access to yeast paste at all times; monitor and replenish the yeast paste as required.\nFrom this point in the protocol onwards, manipulate larvae gently using insect forceps.\nBriefly and gently rinse the larvae in tap water, and then place onto an agar plate.\n Note: This step reduces background auto-fluorescence from food or dirt on the larval surface.\nExamine the larvae under a powerful fluorescence dissecting microscope. Identify larvae with GFP-positive neurons/cells in the body wall.\n6. in vivo imaging of dendrites\nPlace the larva into a depression slide glass with a small drop of 80% glycerol. Place a coverslip on slide to immobilize the larva. Ensure that no air remains between the larva and the coverslip.\nGently push the coverslip to roll the larva to allow visualization of the neuron of interest. Image the mCD8::GFP-labeled dendritic arbor via confocal microscopy.\n7. Larval dissection\nNote before beginning: DA neuron dendrites degrade rapidly after the initiation of dissection. Dissect each individual larva in less than 5min to ensure good dendrite morphology.",
    "Dissect wandering 3rd instar larvae on a Sylgard plate as described previously34 with the following modifications:\n \nFor the imaging of DA neuron axon termini, ensure that the CNS is intact and the segmental nerves are not broken. After opening the larvae, first carefully cut the tracheal connections to the body wall and then gently remove the entire gut.\nIf imaging the dendrites alone, remove the CNS to allow a flatter mounting.\n8. Fixation and blocking of larval fillets\nWith the larva still pinned to the Sylgard plate, fix it in 4% PFA in PBS for 20mins at RT on a gently rotating shaker.\nRemove traces of larval tissues (fat body, trachea, etc.) after fixation.\nWash in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) 3x 10mins on the Sylgard plate and shaker. If examining axon termini, keep the fillet on the Sylgard plate. (If staining dendrites it is possible to transfer the larval fillets to a 0.5 ml tube at this step34)\nBlock the larvae for 20mins at RT in 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) in PBST on a shaker.\n9. Staining of larval fillets\nRemove the blocking solution and incubate in primary antibody (in 5%NDS/PBST) overnight at 4°C in a small Tupperware container surrounded by moistened tissues.\nRemove the tubes from 4°C and incubate an additional hour at RT.\nWash 6x 10mins in PBST. Add the secondary antibody (in 5%NDS/PBST), and cover to prevent fluorophore photo-bleaching34.\nIncubate either at RT for two hours, or overnight at 4°C followed by one hour at RT.\nWash the larvae 6x 10mins in PBST and proceed to mounting.\n10. Mounting of larval fillets for examination of the dendrite arbor",
    "Mount each larval fillet as flat as possible using dissecting scissors or a scalpel to cut off the head (including the mouth hooks), and the posterior (including the spiracles)34.\nPlace the larval fillet on the slide cuticle-side down, mount in 80% glycerol, and seal the sides of the coverslip with nail polish for a 'quick' mount34.\nFor a permanent mounting and a clearer image\n \nPlace the dissected larval fillet muscle-side down onto a drop of PBS on a PLL coverslip, it will quickly adhere to the coverslip.\nRemove as much liquid as possible after mounting, however do not allow it to completely dry.\nTake the coverslip (with attached larval fillet) through an ethanol series: 35% ethanol, followed by 50%, 70%, 95%, and finally 2x 100% ethanol each for 10 minutes (the 2nd 100% EtOH solution should be changed frequently); finally, wash 2-3x 10mins in Xylene.\nPut a drop of DPX mountant (Distyrene Plasticizer Xylene) on a clean slide and carefully lay the coverslip fillet-side-down on top. Keep in the dark, and wait one day for the DPX to set before imaging.\n11. Mounting of larval fillets for examination of the axon termini\nKeep the segmental nerves running between the PNS and the CNS intact during dissection, fixation, and staining to allow the tracing of the axons from peripheral sensory neuron cell body to the VNC.\nMount each larval fillet cuticle-side down in 80% glycerol in a depression slide. Trace the axons from the DA cell body to the VNC under the confocal microscope. Note: PNS neurons in each body wall segment project to the cognate segment of the VNC.\n12. Representative Results:",
