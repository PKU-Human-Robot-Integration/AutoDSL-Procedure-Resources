    "1. Single Cell Suspension from Fresh Surgical Glioblastoma Specimen for Neurosphere Culture\nWith written consent from patients and in accordance with institutional guidelines, collect tumor samples for cell culture immediately after resection surgery of high grade glioma.\nConfirm diagnosis of tumor sample by histopathology. Immediately transport the specimen from the operation room to the laminar flow tissue culture hood, for processing within 1 hr from surgery.\n\tNOTE: For surgeries at a remote site, cut the tumor sample into smaller fragments and place into a tube containing DMEM/F12 (keep on ice). The tumor can be processed several hours after surgery.\nStarting with 200-500 mg of tissue (optimal), mince the tumor sample using a scalpel blade, and transfer to a 15 ml tube containing 10 ml DMEM/F12 serum-free medium. Mix by inverting several times, let the tumor pieces sediment by gravity, remove medium, and repeat as necessary.\nPrepare the Enzymatic Tissue Dissociation Solution and Stop Solution fresh.\n\t\nEnzymatic Tissue Dissociation Solution: 5 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, 2.5 ml Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) calcium- and magnesium-free, 2.5 ml Collagenase IV stock solution (2,000 U/ml in HBSS with calcium and magnesium).\nStop Solution: 5 ml Trypsin Inhibitor solution, 5 ml DMEM/F12, 2 μl of 5,000 U/ml DNAse I (made in HBSS calcium- and magnesium-free).\nRemove medium and add Enzymatic Tissue Dissociation Solution to the minced tumor sample, using 2 ml for each 0.5 g tissue. Gently mix by inverting.\nIncubate the tissue in solution at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator under rotation for 30 min.\nTriturate with a 2 ml pipette and stop the digestion or return to the incubator for another 15-30 min incubation depending on the level of digestion.\nStop digestion by adding 2 volumes of Stop Solution and triturate mechanically with a 5 ml serological pipette.",
    "Filter out the undigested material through a 40 μm cell strainer. Pellet the cells at 800 x g for 5 min at room temp, followed by washing 3x in 10 ml DMEM/F12.\nResuspend the final cell pellet in 5 ml DMEM/F12.\nSlowly layer the cell suspension over 5 ml of Lympholyte-M and pellet at 1,300 x g for 20 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the interface layer containing the nucleated cells to a 15 ml tube containing 10 ml of DMEM/F12.\nPellet the cells at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat the wash with DMEM/F12 2x more.\nCryopreserve the resulting single cells for further use by resuspending the pellet in Recovery Cell Freezing Medium, aliquoting into cryovials, slow freezing, and storing in liquid nitrogen.\nTo culture, resuspend the cells in Neurosphere Medium supplemented with Growth Factors (NMGF), and plate at relatively low density (<1 x 105 cells/ml) in a regular T25 tissue culture flask under standard conditions, 5% CO2, 37 °C, humidified tissue culture incubator (Figure 1A).\n\t\nPrepare NMGF using the following recipe\n\t\ttable:\n﻿0,1,2\nFor 500 ml of DMEM/F12,,\nStock solution,Volume,final concentration\nN2 supplement (10x),5 ml,1x\n250 mg/ml BSA stock solution,1 ml,0.5 mg/ml\n10 mg/ml Gentamicin reagent,1.25 ml,25 μg/ml\n100x antibiotic/antimycotic,2.5 ml,0.5x\n100 mg/ml bFGF,0.1 ml,20 ng/ml\n100 mg/ml EGF,0.1 ml,20 ng/ml\nTransfer neurospheres that form over 1-3 weeks (Figures 1B-E) to fresh flasks, to separate from attached cells and debris. Perform partial media changes every 3-4 days.\n\tNOTE: If dissociating orthotopic xenograft tumor using the protocol above, steps 1.11-1.13 can be omitted.\n2. Glioblastoma Neurosphere Culture Maintenance and Downstream Applications\nDissociation: Monitor the neurosphere cultures and perform partial medium changes every 3-4 days. When most multicellular neurospheres in the flask reach 100 μm in diameter, dissociate into a single cell suspension:",
    "Transfer the medium containing the neurospheres to a 15 ml tube, gravity sediment the neurospheres for about 5 min, remove the medium and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml calcium- and magnesium-free DPBS.\nMix and incubate for 10 min at room temperature, as the cells sediment by gravity.\nRemove 7-8 ml of DPBS then dissociate the neurospheres mechanically with a prewetted serological pipette.\nPellet the dissociated cells at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nPassaging: Resuspend the dissociated cells (step 2.1.) in NMGF and divide into the necessary number of flasks (1:3), and incubate under standard conditions. Secondary neurospheres will form, and should be subsequently dissociated for the formation of tertiary spheres.\nAssessing long term self-renewal: Repeat the dissociation procedure until the neurosphere culture achieves at least 10 passages, equivalent to a minimum of 2 months in culture.\nFreezing: To cryopreserve the neurospheres, dissociate the neurospheres (step 2.1.) and resuspend the cell pellet in Recovery Cell Freezing Medium, aliquot in cryovials, slow freeze, and store in liquid nitrogen.\n\t\nTo culture neurosphere cells from a frozen stock: thaw the cells at 37 °C and immediately transfer to a 15 ml tube containing 10 ml DMEM/F12. Mix the tube gently and then spin the cells at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Wash the cell pellet one more time and resuspend the cells in NMGF and transfer to a T25 tissue culture flask.\nCell suspension for intracranial implant in immunocompromised mouse:\n\t\nDissociate the neurospheres (step 2.1.) and resuspend the cell pellet in calcium- and magnesium-free DPBS. Count viable cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion.",
    "Calculate the number of cells needed for implant, typically 3 x 105 cells/mouse, transfer the desired number of cells into a vial, and pellet the cells at 1,000 x g.\nResuspend the cell pellet in a volume appropriate for implant (5 μl/mouse) by gently tapping the microcentrifuge tube. Place the cell suspension on ice and use within 2 hr.\n3. Alternative Protocol for Culturing Tumorigenic Glioblastoma Cells (for the cases where neurosphere culture fails)\nSupplement the NMGF medium with fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 2% FBS/NMGF.\nStarting with cells in NMGF culture: Harvest viable cells from the NMGF flask (Figure 1F), resuspend in 2% FBS/NMGF and plate at relatively low density (<1 x 105 cells/ml) in a regular T25 tissue culture flask, and culture under standard conditions, 5% CO2, 37 °C, humidified tissue culture incubator (Figure 1G).\nStarting with frozen never cultured cells (step 1.14.): Thaw the cells, wash in serum-free medium and plate in 2% FBS/NMGF and culture as described in step 3.2. Culturing in NMGF for 3 days prior to transferring viable cells to 2% FBS/NMGF is an alternative to preselect away differentiated cells.\n4. Morphological and Molecular Analysis of Neurospheres by Immunohistochemistry\nCulture the neurospheres until most floating multicellular spheroids reach 100 μm diameter.\nRemove culture flasks from the incubator and immediately pellet the neurospheres, remove medium and add 10 ml of DPBS without disturbing the pellet. Remove DPBS, resuspend in 10% neutral buffered formalin and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nPellet the spheroids, resuspend in 30% ethanol and incubate for 30-45 min.\nReplace 30% ethanol with 50% ethanol, incubate for 15 min and replace with fresh 50% ethanol, incubate a further 30 min.\nRepeat (step 4.4.) with 70% ethanol.",
    "Replace with 95% ethanol two changes 10-20 min each, and repeat with absolute ethanol until spheroids are bright white and condensed.\nMake a small filter paper cone out of lens paper and place it into a small funnel in a beaker. Wet the lens paper with absolute alcohol.\nLoosen the pellet slightly with fresh 100% ethanol, pour off excess ethanol and pour the spheroids through the lens paper cone, making sure they go to the tip of the cone. Rinse the tube with additional absolute ethanol and pour any remaining spheroids through the lens paper cone.\nRemove the paper cone from the funnel and carefully move the spheroids into the bottom of the cone. Fold the paper into a square and make sure the spheroids are as securely enclosed as possible.\nTransfer the packaged neurospheres to a cassette and transfer to an automatic tissue processor.\nProgram the automatic tissue processor as follows: absolute ethanol, 10 min, xylene, 15 min (2x), paraffin, 10 min (4x).\nRemove the cassette from the processor and place it on the heated part of a paraffin embedding system . Make sure the entire surface is free of fragments, dust or other debris and siphon out all paraffin from the forceps warming wells. Warm clean paraffin free forceps and add a small amount of paraffin to a warmed base mold.\nOpen the cassette, remove the packet and place it on the heated part of the embedding system. Carefully open the paper cone until the spheroids are visible. Gather as much of the material as possible with prewarmed forceps and transfer to the liquid paraffin in the base mold.",
    "Repeat as required to retrieve as many of the spheroids as possible. Gently scrape the tissue paper with a prewarmed clean razor blade that has been wiped with ethanol to collect any residual spheroids without getting any paper into the block.\nCarefully break up any spheroid clumps with warm forceps. Move the spheroids away from the corners into a uniform central layer. Move the base mold to the cooling area to secure the spheroids in place, add the cassette, fill slowly with paraffin, and chill thoroughly.\nThe neurosphere paraffin block can be used for normal sectioning and immunohistochemistry."
