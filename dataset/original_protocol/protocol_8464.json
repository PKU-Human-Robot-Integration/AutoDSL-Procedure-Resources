    "All experiments were carried out in accordance with the British Home Office regulations (Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986) and approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Reading, UK.\n1. Animal Preparation\nNOTE: Female Lister Hooded rats were used for all experiments. This is a non-survival procedure. \nRecord the rat's weight on a laboratory scale.\nAnesthetize the rat in a chamber with 5% isoflurane and an oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min.\nPlace the rat onto a stereotaxic holder with a paper towel underneath its body and with its teeth resting via the bite bar.. The paper towel will make the insertion of a heat pad easier (see step 2.3) and catch any excrement from the rat during the experiment.\nAdminister isoflurane continuously via a hard-plastic nose cone mounted onto the nose clamp for rat adaptor at a concentration of 3% with an oxygen flow rate of 0.5 L/min. Connect the cone to a small animal isoflurane anesthetic system.\n2. Surgical Procedure\nInsert a thermostatic heating pad underneath the paper towel upon which the rat is resting, secure the rat’s head with two ear bars, and monitor the body temperature using a rectal thermometer.\nShave the top of the rat's head.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent corneal drying.\nBefore exposing the cranium, apply lidocaine drops to the scalp and massage it gently into the skin.\nMake a midline incision of approximately 2-3 cm on the scalp using a scalpel to expose the surface of the skull.\nCarefully separate the temporalis muscle contra-lateral to the whisker pad to be stimulated from the skull using a Jacquette Scaler and a pair of serrated and curved dissecting forceps. Clean the skull with cotton swabs whenever necessary.",
    "Using a braided silk, non-absorbable suture, tie the separated muscle to the scalp with a tight knot and then tie the suture securely to the stereotaxic frame18.\nUse stereotaxic coordinates to locate the barrel cortex, 2.5 mm caudal to bregma and 6 mm lateral to midline19. Draw a dot at the location of the somatosensory cortex using a pencil or a marker.\nDrill a burr hole at the marked location using a dental drill. To prevent the skull from overheating during drilling, apply sterile saline (sodium chloride 0.9%) to the work area every 10-15 s. The drilling process involves the following 3 steps:\nDrill a hole of diameter < 2 mm into the skull using a drill bit #4 (0.055 in diameter). Take care not to drill into the dura.\nThin the bottom of the hole to translucency using a drill bit #1/4 (0.019 in diameter).\nUse a 27 G needle to pierce the dura to allow the insertion of a microelectrode.\nTransfer the rat, secured on a stereotaxic frame, to a Faraday cage mounted on top of a vibration isolation workstation.\nAttach an oximeter sensor clamp connected to an oximeter control unit to the rat's hind paw to monitor continuously the following physiological parameters: heart rate, breath rate, arterial oxygen saturation, pulse distention, and breath distention. These parameters were displayed continuously on a PC monitor, reflecting the physiological condition and anaesthetic depth of the rat.\nReplace the hard-plastic nose cone for isoflurane administration and the nose clamp for rat adaptor with a microflex breather fitted with a transparent soft nose cone which is modified (Figure 1A) to allow easy whisker stimulation to one side of the whisker pad without compromising the isoflurane administration.",
    "Insert two stainless steel stimulating electrodes to the whisker pad exposed by the cut-out on the nose cone.\nConnect the stimulating electrodes to an isolated current stimulator.\nLift the skin of the midline of the neck with forceps and make a 1~2 cm incision with scissors ready for the placement of reference electrodes. Take care not to cut the muscle tissue.\n3. Co-localized EEG/LFP Setup\nClean and dry the skull surrounding the burr hole using a cotton swab.\nCarefully place the conductive EEG paste on one flat side of an EEG spider electrode. Leave a small hole clear of the EEG paste on the spider electrode to allow a multi-laminar microelectrode to pass through the hole without contacting the paste and the spider electrode. This prevents electrical contact between the EEG electrode and the microelectrode.\nAlign the spider electrode to the burr hole in the skull, with the EEG paste facing the skull.\nCarefully press the spider electrode onto the skull, making firm contact with the skull via the EEG paste. Remove any paste obscuring the burr hole using a needle on a syringe.\nRemove excessive EEG paste beyond the periphery of the spider electrode so that the contact between the spider electrode and the skull is spatially constrained to the size of the electrode (Figure 1B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56447/56447fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1: General setup for concurrent EEG/LFP recording. (A) The setup consists of a modified nose cone for ease of whisker pad stimulation under isoflurane anesthesia, two stimulating electrodes inserted into the whisker pad, a spider electrode positioned on the skull above the barrel cortex contra-lateral to the stimulating electrodes, a multi-channel microelectrode inserted into the barrel cortex through the spider electrode, and reference electrodes placed inside an incision at the back of the rat's neck. (B) A view through the microscope of the spider electrode securely positioned onto the skull by EEG paste. The microelectrode is inserted into a burr hole drilled into the skull under the spider electrode. The scalp is held back by surgical thread (suture) tied to the stereotaxic frame.

Make sure the impedance of the spider electrode is below 5 kΩ. If it is not, check that the EEG paste is in good contact with the skull and the electrode is firmly pressed to the EEG paste. Add more EEG paste if necessary.\nMount a micromanipulator arm on the stereotaxic frame. Connect a linear 16-channel microelectrode (100 µm spacing, area of each site 177 µm2) to a 16-channel acute headstage clipped securely onto the micromanipulator arm.\nSmear EEG paste onto the reference electrodes for the EEG and microelectrode, then securely place them inside the incision (Figure 1A).\nAdjust the angle of the micromanipulator arm so that the microelectrode is perpendicular to the cortical surface. This angle is normally between 25-35 °.",
    "Lower the microelectrode under a microscope by turning the micromanipulator knobs so that the tip of the microelectrode is aimed at the tiny opening at the bottom of the burr hole until the uppermost electrode just penetrates the cortical surface. Care must be taken to avoid forcing the microelectrode onto the surface of the dura as this would break the electrode.\nCouple the 16-channel microelectrode to a preamplifier connected to a data acquisition unit via a fiber optic cable (Figure 2).\nTurn on the preamplifier, the data acquisition unit, and the computer connected to the unit. Turn on the stimulator box.\nInsert the microelectrode normally to the cortical surface by slowly turning the z-axis knob of the micromanipulator to a depth of 1,500 µm20.\nMicro-adjust the depth by applying a train of stimulus to the whisker pad and observing the 16-channel evoked LFP on a PC monitor using the software of the data acquisition unit installed on the PC. Carefully turn the z-axis knob on the micromanipulator until the highest amplitude of the evoked LFP occurs around channel 7 (as this coincides with layer IV in the cortex).\n\tNOTE: Ipsi-lateral EEG electrode setup: For some experiments, a second spider electrode was placed on the ipsi-lateral side of the intact skull above the barrel cortex. This setup allowed bilateral EEG recording during the resting state to investigate the effect of the burr hole on the EEG signal.\n\tNOTE: The surgical procedure to set up the EEG electrode is identical to that described above, except that during step 2.6, the temporalis muscle on each side of the head was carefully separated from the skull, sutured back and tied securely to the corresponding side of the stereotaxic frame.",
    "NOTE: The concurrent EEG/LFP setup is also identical to that described above, with an additional step that a second spider electrode is loaded with the EEG paste, then pressed firmly to the skull above the ipsi-lateral barrel cortex.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56447/56447fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A signal flow diagram. The rat is placed inside a Faraday cage. The stimulating electrodes receive commands from the stimulator box controlled by the Data Acquisition Unit through its software installed on a PC. The neural signal recorded by the microelectrode is transmitted to a pre-amplifier inside the Faraday cage. The neural signal recorded by the EEG probe is transmitted to the pre-amplifier through a signal splitter. The pre-amplifier is connected to the Data Acquisition Unit outside the Faraday cage via a fiber optic cable. The neural data are then stored on a local drive on the PC, while they can also be displayed on a PC monitor. A mobile small animal isoflurane system administers isoflurane from outside the Faraday cage.

Electrical Stimulation and Neural Recordings\nNOTE: The sampling frequency for all neural data is 24.41 kHz with 16-bit resolution. A trial consists of a single electrical stimulation at the start of the trial. Each trial lasts 10 s, which is also the inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Each stimulus is a square current pulse of 1.2 mA lasting 0.3 ms. For bilateral experiments to study the effect of the burr hole, continuous resting state of 250 s is also recorded.\nOpen the recording software on the computer in use.\nLoad the correct circuit for the experiment by selecting 'Load Project…' from the dropdown menu of 'OpenProject'. A new window ('WorkBench') will appear (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56447/56447fig3.jpg",

    "Wait 20 s to avoid recording the initial fluctuation of the EEG recordings.\nGo back to the PC monitor (after the 20 s wait) and press the 'Return' key on the keyboard. The EEG and the LFP signals will be recorded.\n5. Data Analysis\nPre-process the evoked LFP and EEG signals on a trial-by-trial basis using the following steps.\nShift back the neural data in time by 20 samples (equivalent to 0.82 ms). This is the delay produced by the circuit used to collect neural data in TDT itself. By shifting the data, the time zero point is aligned to the onset of the stimulus.\nRemove the stimulus artifact by replacing the neural data from 0 to 1 ms with a straight line connecting the data point at 0 ms with the data point at 1 ms.\nZero-mean each trial by subtracting the mean value of the neural signal 200 ms prior to stimulus onset.\nLow-pass filter the data below 800 Hz using a 4th order Butterworth IIR type filter in both directions to avoid introducing any temporal shift in the data.\nAlign the multi-laminar data across animals. For each animal's LFP data, apply the inverse Current Source Density (spline iCSD, source radius R = 0.5 mm) analysis21 with a Gaussian filter (λ = 50 µm) to locate the layer IV sink1, which is given by the largest negative peak occurring at a cortical depth below the pial surface within the first 15 ms of stimulus onset. The CSD, and the corresponding LFP, data are then aligned according to their sink locations across animals. The common sink is located in layer IV, ~ 600 µm below the pial surface.",
    "After alignment, use channels 2, 7, and 12 of the realigned LFP as representatives of neural responses of the supragranular, granular, and infragranular layers, respectively in the barrel cortex.\nCalculate the mean evoked LFP and EEG by averaging the pre-processed data over 100 trials.\nTo investigate the effect of the burr hole on the EEG, down-sample the EEG signals to 1,000 Hz, and compute the power spectral density (PSD) for the contra-lateral (with a hole in the skull) and ipsi-lateral (intact skull) spider electrode recordings over a 250 s period of resting state. PSD is computed from 0.1-100 Hz in Matlab using the function 'pmtm' which is based on the multitaper method22.\nDivide the frequency range into the following well-known frequency bands: Delta (δ): 0.1-4 Hz, Theta (): 4-8 Hz, Alpha (α): 8-13 Hz, Beta (β): 13-31 Hz, Gamma (γ): 31-100 Hz. Calculate the average PSD within each band.\nWithin each frequency band, calculate the normalized difference in PSD, Perr, between the contra- and the ipsi-lateral EEG using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56447/56447eq1.jpg\n\twhere Pc and Pi are the average PSD of the contra- and ipsi-lateral EEG, respectively in the frequency band of interest.\nWithin each frequency band, perform a one-sample t-test to test the hypothesis that there is no significant difference (at 0.05 significance level) between the PSD of the EEG signal recorded from the two hemispheres."
