    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransfection of S2R+ cells with recombinant DNA or double strand (ds) RNA -day 1\nTiming: 2 h\nHarvest cells from T25 flask using a disposable cell scraper (Sarstedt) and transfer to a 15 mL sterile tube (Sarstedt) using a sterile serological pipette.\nCritical: Using a scraper is the best way to harvest the cells in a gentle way that minimizes stress.\nTake an aliquot of cells (100 μL) and mix it with Trypan Blue stain in a 1:1 ratio in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific).\nCount the live cells (blue cells are dead) using an inverted microscope.\nTransfer 2,000,000 cells in 2 mL of SFM4 medium supplemented with antibiotics and seed them in a well of a 6-well plate. Incubate overnight before transfection.\nNote: Seed 2,000,000 cells per well in as many wells as needed. Always seed a well as an untreated control.\nTransfection of S2R+ cells-day 2\nTiming: 1 h\nOn the day of transfection/dsRNA treatment, prepare two empty 1.5 mL tubes per each DNA or dsRNA on a rack in a sterile cabinet and add 100 μL of SMF4 medium to each.\nTo transfect recombinant DNA, add 2 μg of DNA to one of the prepared 1.5 mL tubes and add 18 μL of Cellfectin II transfection reagent to the other tube.\nIncubate both tubes for 5 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the 100 μL of media plus DNA to the tube containing the 100 μL of SFM4 medium plus Cellfectin II.\nPipette up and down 4 times to mix and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.\nAdd the DNA and Cellfectin II mix to one well of the 6-well plate prepared on day 1 and incubate at 25°C for 1–3 days.",
    "Note: The time of incubation of the transfected cells should be empirically established and can vary depending on the protein that is being expressed.\nNote: Cells can be used up to 20 passages without observing any reduction in cell transfection efficiency. If reduction in transfection efficiency or loss of response to stimuli is observed, fresh cells should be thawed.\nAlternatives: If cells need to be treated with dsRNA, add 10 μg of dsRNA to 100 μL of SFM4 media and add to the 2,000,000 cells seeded in one 6-well plate. Swirl the plate after adding the dsRNA and incubate for 3–4 days at 25°.\nNote: When performing a transfection either with dsRNA or with a recombinant DNA, always set another well of cells that will receive the vehicle and not the treatment. This well will serve as control for cell viability and for detection of phenotypes caused by the treatments.\nBacterial culture for treatment of transfected S2R+ cells-day 5\nTiming: 24 h\nA day before ending the treatment of the S2R+ cells, culture Erwinia carotovora carotovora (Ecc15) bacteria in 50 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 29°C in a shaking incubator (200 RPM) for 24 h.\nTreatment of transfected S2R+ cells with microbes to induce cytoskeleton rearrangement-day 6\nTiming: 8 h\nTransfer 1 mL of the overnight Ecc15 culture in a plastic cuvette and measure the Optical Density (OD) in a spectrophotometer at 600 nm to calculate bacterial cell number per mL. Based on the reading of the spectrophotometer at OD of 600 nm, calculate the concentration of bacteria following the following formula for Gram-negative bacteria:\nOD600 of 1= 8 × 108 cells/mL.\nPellet and resuspend the culture in an appropriate volume to obtain a concentration of 20 × 106 cells/mL in PBS 1×.",
    "Take the 6-well plate from the incubator, scrape cells off and transfer the suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nCritical: Work in a BSL level II sterile cabinet.\nTake an aliquot of S2R+ cells (100 μL) and mix it in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific) with Trypan Blue stain in a 1:1 ratio.\nCount the live cells (blue cells are dead) using an inverted microscope.\nTake the coverslips coated with concanavalin A prepared on day 1 and place them in a 24- well plate.\nSeed 100,000 cells on the coverslip per well in SFM4 medium supplemented with antibiotics. Seed two coverslips for each treatment and control group. Incubate for 4 h at 25°C.\nCritical: Splitting cells is necessary to ensure enough space remains between cells to adequately visualize cytoskeletal features and prevent cell overgrowth. If performing any treatment, ensure treatment period has stopped, then split cells before beginning the immunofluorescence protocol.\nAlternatives: When performing live imaging, seed 100,000 cells in an 8-chamber coverglass (Thermo Fischer Scientific) rather than on a slide. Seed two coverslips for cells from each treatment and control groups. Incubate for 4 h at 25°C and add the bacteria to the chamber as described above.\nCritical: To visualize changes in cortical cytoskeleton following the analyses we report below, it is critical to coat the 8-chamber cover glass with concanavalin A prior seeding the cells. Follow the procedure described to coat the coverslips.\nAlternatives: Studies of cytoskeleton dynamics in response to mutations and/or external stimuli can also be performed in Drosophila plasmatocytes to validate the effect of specific genetic manipulations in primary cells. The following procedure is a quick and reproducible method to extract plasmatocytes from adult Drosophila.\nExtraction of plasmatocytes from adult flies\nTiming: 8 h",
    "For extraction of plasmatocytes from adults, anaesthetize groups of 20 flies (10 males and 10 females) from control group or mutant using gaseous CO2.\nTransfer the anaesthetized flies onto a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nCover the flies with glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, G8772) and vortex at high intensity for 60 s to wound the flies and mobilize plasmatocytes.\nTransfer the flies to a glass dissecting dish and cut each fly into head, thorax and abdomen with surgical forceps and allow to bleed for 1 min into a glass dish that is filled with 100 mL of SFM4 Insect Cell Culture Medium containing cOmpleteTM Protease Inhibitor Cocktail to avoid coagulation.\nFilter the cell suspension on 70-μm microcentrifuge filters and collect the liquid containing plasmatocytes into a 1.5 mL tube.\nRepeat steps 19–23 5 times, each time using 20 flies.\nTake and aliquot of cells (20 μL) and mix it in a 1.5 mL tube (Fisher Scientific) with Trypan Blue stain in a 1:1 ratio.\nCount the live cells using an inverted microscope.\nMove the cell suspension (we get around 50,000 cells) in an 8-chamber cover glass coated with concanavalin A. Seed plasmatocytes from each group of flies in duplicate.\nIncubate for 2 h at 25°C.\nTransfer 100 μL of the bacterial suspension prepared in step 15 to one of the two wells. Mark the well where bacteria were added. This represents the stimulated population. Incubate for 2 h at 25°C.\nCritical: Perform plasmatocyte extraction on an equal number of 3–4 day-old male and female adult D. melanogaster flies.\nCritical: For live cell imaging, image the cells within 6 h for 1–3 h.",
    "Note: To visualize cortical cytoskeleton dynamics in live imaging, the Drosophila strains used for the study should express a fluorescent marker for F-actin (e.g Lifeact-GFP, an actin-binding peptide fused to a fluorescent protein) in plasmatocytes. Likewise, S2R+ cells used in live imaging should express an actin-fluorescent fusion protein such as LifeAct (Ibidi). To perform live imaging on plasmatocytes or S2R+ cells, nuclei can be stained by adding 4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to the media (dilution 1:500).\nTransfer 100 μL of the bacterial suspension prepared in step 15 to one of the 24-well plates prepared for each treatment in step 18. Mark the well where bacteria were added. This represents the stimulated population. Incubate for 2 h at 25°C.\nIndirect immunofluorescence and confocal imaging of phalloidin-stained cells\nTiming: 24 h\nRemove the media from cells seeded on coverslips.\nWith a pipette, rinse cells gently with 500 μL of PBS 1×.\nRemove the PBS 1× and add 500 μL of 4% formaldehyde to fix the cells.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemove formaldehyde by aspiration and wash the cells three times with PBST to fully remove formaldehyde and permeabilize cells.\nIncubate cells in 1× PBS with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature (20°C).\nDilute primary antibody in blocking buffer and apply primary antibody at 1:100 dilution in 1× PBS with 5% normal goat serum for 16 h at 4°C.\nNote: Steps are required only if a primary antibody is used to visualize a specific protein. If only cortical cytoskeleton needs to be visualized, phalloidin staining is sufficient (step 30).\nNote: The incubation time with primary antibody might vary depending on the antibody and should be adjusted accordingly.\nThe following day, remove primary antibody and wash the cells three times with PBST.",
    "Incubate cells for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor antibody at 1:1000 in 1× PBS with 5% normal goat serum, DAPI (1:1000 dilution) and fluorescently labeled phalloidin (1:500 dilution) to visualize the cytoskeleton.\nWash cells four times, each for 10 min with PBST.\nMount cells in Pro-Gold Antifade Reagent. Remove excess mounting medium by aspiration.\nAllow slides to dry completely.\nImage slides at ZEISS LSM 880 using a 100× oil immersion objective, NA = 1.4.\nAnalyze the images following the protocol we adopted in ImageJ.\nNote: Use an appropriate number of replicates. Since transient transfections of recombinant vectors or RNA interference-mediated depletion of targeted genes are transient, the chances of variation arising among cells in the same well and between wells are substantial. We recommend to always use at least three biological replicates, and to image at least 30 cells per replicate, if possible."
