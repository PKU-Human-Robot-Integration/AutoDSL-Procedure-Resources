    "Veterinary support was performed according to institutional guidelines. Experiments were approved by the Local Ethics Committee, Switzerland (BE 60/19). The ARRIVE guidelines and 3R principles have been strictly followed6,7. Thirty-one male Lewis rats, 12 weeks old and weighing 492 ± 8 g, were included. House all rats at a room temperature of 23 °C and a 12 h light/dark cycle. Provide free access to water and pellets. Statistical analyses have been performed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test. Probability values (p) of ≤ 0.05 and/or ≤ 0.01 were considered significant.\n1. Preoperative phase-general preparation and anesthesiological aspects\nRandomize rats into either coil or stent treatment groups (Figure 2) via a web-based randomization system. Now, perform a preoperative clinical examination of all animals planned for surgery next to a quiet, aseptic operating room maintaining a room temperature of 23 ± 3 °C. Analyze the animals' behavior and inspect the mucous membranes and turgor as part of the preoperative clinical examination.\nRecord the weight of each animal.\nPrior to surgery, incubate the arterial pouches from donor rats in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 10 h at 37 °C to obtain decellularized aneurysms8. Collect these pouches from donor animals a few days before the surgery.\n\t\nPrepare the full length of the abdominal aorta with microscissors and forceps and apply 6-0 nonabsorbable ligatures at an interval of 3-4 mm.\nDirectly generate vital aneurysms intraoperatively by a previously ligated arterial vessel pouch from the thoracic part of a donor animal9. Perform thoracotomy with scissors and surgical forceps at the indicated FU time point and ligate the vessel pouch at the desired length.\nDirectly implant the pouch into the recipient and harvest the aneurysm from the donor animal for further macroscopic analysis and histological processing.",
    "For anesthesia induction, place all rats in a clean box provided with oxygen (O2) until loss of consciousness after 5-10 min. Anesthetize rats with a subcutaneous (SC) injection of a mixture of fentanyl 0.005 mg/kg, medetomidine 0.15 mg/kg, and midazolam 2 mg/kg.\n\tNOTE: This ensures a surgical plane of at least 45 min.\nCheck the depth of anesthesia by the absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex.\nPlace the rats in a supine position and shave the thoracoabdominal part with an electric shaver.\nFixate the 4 paws of the rats with tape on a board, covered by a heating pad connected to an autoregulating rectal probe. Insert the rectal probe in the rat's anus to maintain the desired temperature of 37 °C with the help of the heating pad.\nNow, install a sensor on the right hind leg connected to a computerized system for checking vital signs intraoperatively.\nCover the rat's nose and mouth with a face mask. If requiring prolonged anesthesia, start isoflurane (1.0-2.0% titrated to effect in 100% O2).\nDisinfect the surgical field with povidone-iodine or alternating disinfectants and drape the surgical field in a sterile fashion.\nFor perianesthetic care, apply a sterile ophthalmic lubricant to the eyes and cover them with an opaque foil mask to prevent drying and damage from the surgical lamp.\nThroughout surgery, supply oxygen continuously via the face mask, monitor the body temperature, and provide heat using a heating pad, maintaining normothermia.\nMonitor other vital signs continuously (pulse and breath distension, heart and breath rate, and oxygen saturation).\n2. Operative phase - cell-tracer injection\nNOTE: The detailed surgical approach in the Helsinki rat microsurgical sidewall aneurysm model9 and techniques for coil- and stent-implantation are described elsewhere8,10,11.\nStore the fluorescent lipophilic cell-tracer at ≤ -20 °C all the time, protected from light.",
    "Perform the surgery by preparing the rat aorta and caval vein, followed by the separation of both, as well as proximal and distal temporary clamping of the aorta.\n\tNOTE: This technique has been described previously9.\n\t\nClamp the proximal and distal parts of the aorta with two temporary titan clips.\nPut one microswab with purple padding each under the proximal and distal parts of the aorta for better visualization of the artery.\nNow, protect the abdomen with wet gauze.\nOn the day of the operation, dissolve 2 µL of the cell-tracer by pipetting in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nTransfer the mixture to a 1 mL syringe fitted with a 27-1/2 G (0.4 x 13 mm) sterile cannula.\n\tNOTE: Be careful to avoid light exposure while performing steps 2.5 and 2.6.\nTurn off the light in the operating room. While looking under a microscope, perform the one-point injection in the middle ventral part of the aorta using micro forceps and carefully inject 1 mL of heparinized 0.9% saline solution.\nInject the cell-tracer carefully (Video 1) and immediately turn off the operating microscope as well. Again, protect the abdomen with wet gauze.\nLet the dye incubate for at least 15 min. After the incubation period, turn on the microscope and operating room lights.\nPerform the longitudinal arteriotomy and suturing of the aneurysm, as described elsewhere11.\n\t\nUse microforceps and microscissors to perform the arteriotomy so that its length averages the diameter of the harvested aneurysm (step 1.3). To ensure the correct length, place the aneurysm beside the aorta before performing arteriotomy. Suture the aneurysm with 8-10 single-stitches using a nonabsorbable 10-0 suture, and carefully remove the temporary clamps-starting distally-under continuous irrigation with heparinized saline. Close the wound in a layered fashion. Of note, use a coil packing density of 1 cm.",
    "NOTE: The technique of coil- or stent-implantation has been described elsewhere8,10.\n3. Postoperative phase-monitoring and analgetic care\nAt the end of the surgery, reverse the anesthesia with an SC injection mixture of buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg, atipamezol 0.75 mg/kg, and flumazenil 0.2 mg/kg. Let each operated animal recover in a clean cage until fully awake and warm, as needed, with a heating lamp.\nFor 3 days, administer 1 mg/kg meloxicam (one injection or oral application per day) and buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg four times each day) SC. Overnight, provide buprenorphine continuously in the drinking water with the same dosing: 6 mL buprenorphine 0.3 mg/mL, 360 mL drinking water, 10 mL of 5% glucose.\nIn the immediate postoperative phase, house each animal in a single cage for protection. Regroup the animals after 24 h.\nIf any rat shows distressed or aggressive behavior after SC injection, administer buprenorphine in the drinking water during the day.\nProvide soft feed on the cage floor to support feeding and recovery postoperatively.\nObserve and take care of all the animals according to the wellbeing and pain score sheet.\nAdminister rescue analgesia SC (meloxicam 1 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine) when needed.\nSubscription Required.
