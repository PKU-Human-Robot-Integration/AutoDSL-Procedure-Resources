  "procedures": [
    "The use of mice as a source of blood for sand fly feeding was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NIAID, NIH (protocol number LPD 68E). Invertebrates are not covered under NIH guidelines.\n1. Needle preparation (Figure 1)\nPull needles and bevel as described in Meuti and Harrell19. Briefly, pull needles on a dual-stage glass micropipette puller, using borosilicate glass capillaries.\nSharpen the needles by wet beveling on the micropipette beveller, using an extra fine stone.\n2. Embryo collection and micromanipulation (Figure 2)\nFive days before the day of injection, blood feed sand fly females as performed routinely for colony maintenance. For details on sand fly colonies rearing procedures and required material, please refer to Lawyer et al.1 Maintain the insects in incubators at 70% humidity and 26 °C, during their entire development.\n\t\nOne day post blood-feeding, capture blood-fed females by groups of 100-150 in plaster pots with a side port. Maintain the females by feeding them with sugar solution (30% sucrose – enough volume to soak a small cotton ball) which is usual for colony maintenance.\nAt day 2-3 post blood-feeding, do NOT moisten the plaster pots. Keeping the females on a dry substrate will prevent premature egg laying, since females prefer to lay eggs on a moist environment.\nOn day 5 post blood-feeding, perform the embryo collection, micromanipulation, and microinjection. Introduce a moist filter paper into the egg-laying chamber. Freshly laid embryos do not have a fully developed chorion and appear white. Use black filter paper during the procedure to facilitate visualizing the white embryos.",
    "Transfer a small group of females from the plaster pot to the egg-laying chamber through the side ports by using a mouth aspirator. The presence of a moist substrate (the filter paper) induces females to oviposit.\nAfter 30-60 min, carefully retrieve the filter paper with newly laid embryos from the chamber. Keep the filter paper and embryos in a Petri dish for up to 3 hours. During this time, regularly assess the moisture level of the filter paper to ensure that it remains moist. During this time, repeat steps 2.4 to 2.6 with new groups of females and collect as many embryos as possible.\nPrepare microscope slides for the injection: manually collect the eggs one by one with a very fine paintbrush and carefully transfer them onto another piece of moist black filter paper placed on a microscope slide topped with a glass coverslip.\n\t\nAdd water to the filter paper, enough to keep the embryos moist but not causing them to float away from the coverslip or being sucked under the coverslip. Line up the embryos against the coverslip. The coverslip acts as a backstop preventing the eggs from rolling away during injection.\n3. Embryo Injections (Figure 3)\nStart injections 2.5 to 3 hours post start of egg collection. Perform injections at room temperature and ambient lab humidity.\nMake sure the aligned embryos have enough water so they are kept moist.",
    "NOTE: It is critical that the embryos are kept moist during injections. If they are not moist during the injection process, injections become difficult because the needle has trouble piercing the embryo. The correct amount of water is the point at which the embryos have a meniscus of water around them, but the coverslip is not floating on top of the water causing the embryos to push under the coverslip. It is critical to monitor the amount of water around the embryos during injections. Add water as necessary to keep the embryos moist.\nAdd water carefully by wetting a brush with water and transferring the water to the back end of the filter paper. Adding water in this fashion allows water to be added in a slow and controlled fashion so that just enough is added to keep the embryos moist. Too much water can cause the embryos to float out of alignment, making it difficult to inject the embryos.\nBack load injection mix into the microinjection needle. Add approximately 0.5 to 1 µL of injection mix into the needle using a hand-drawn borosilicate needle filler, gel loading pipet tips can also be used. The injection mix is composed of one or several guide RNA (80 ng/µL each) designed to target a specific locus mixed with commercial recombinant Cas9 protein (300 ng/µL).",
    "Starting with the injection pressure at 30 psi, press the injection trigger to expel air out of the tip of the needle. This will force the injection mix to the tip of the needle allowing the injection mix to flow. At this point, slowly increase the hold/constant pressure until injection material starts to flow, then back off the hold/constant pressure so that it is just below the point of the injection mix flowing from the needle. The gated setting should deliver just enough injection material so that a small amount of material can be seen to enter the embryo.\n\tNOTE: Injection of sand fly embryos under halocarbon oil similar to other protocols used for Drosophila and mosquitoes was initially tested, however the survival percentage for these injections was very low. Survival was improved by switching to injections on damp filter paper as described above.\nInsert the needle into the side of the embryo. Use the coverslip behind the embryo as a backstop which will aid the needle to pierce the embryo. Deliver a small amount of injection mix into the embryo before gently removing the needle.\nImmediately after removal of the needle, press the injector to remove any backfilled material from the needle tip. This will help to prevent the needle from clogging.\nProceed to the next embryo. Between each injection, ensure that the filter paper is moist and the needle is not clogged.\nOnce all embryos have been injected, count the number of injected embryos to keep a running tally.",
    "Remove the coverslip by adding water to the filter paper so the coverslip floats. At this point, use a probe (wood applicator stick with insect pin glued to the tip) to hold the filter paper in place while a finger is used to pull the coverslip away from the injected embryos.\nBlot away excess water from the filter paper once the coverslip has been removed.\n4. Post-injection rearing (G0) (Figure 4)\nTransfer the filter paper with the embryos on top of several layers of moist filter paper placed in a Petri dish to maintain humidity. Keep the embryos here during the time needed to inject other embryos. Embryos can be held for a maximum of 3 hours like this. After injection they will slowly turn brown.\nOnce all embryos have been injected, manually transfer them onto previously moistened small size plaster pots. Do not put too many embryos in each pot and maintain distance between them, to avoid possible fungal contamination between individuals. Cover the pots with a screen and store them as would typically be done for sand fly colony eggs, maintained in incubators at 70% humidity and 26 °C, during their entire development.\nOn day 1 post-injection, remove all the damaged and dead embryos with a paintbrush. Add 100 µL of 0.5% propionic acid, drop by drop, onto the plaster pots containing the injected embryos to limit fungal contamination. The release of cytoplasm from embryos damaged during the injection process is particularly favorable to fungal growth.\nCheck the plaster pots every day and remove any bad or dead embryos. If fungus is present, remove all infected embryos and add a few drops of 0.5% propionic acid.",
    "Larvae hatch between day 8 and 12 post-injection. Twice a day, transfer the newly emerged larvae onto new plaster pots, in groups of 5-10 maximum. Add a small amount of food and check the food 2-3 times a week.\n\t\nCarefully monitor the quantity of larval food, as too much greatly increases the risk of fungal contamination. Sand fly larvae survive better in groups however they can be cannibalistic if there is not enough food.\nWhen the larvae pupate, separate them by sex to maintain the females as virgins. If there are a lot of survivors, discard the males and keep only the females.\n\tNOTE: Both males and females can carry and transmit mutations. However, as females have to be kept virgins before they are to be crossed, it is easier to use only the G0 injected females to avoid having to separate wt insects by sex. The G0 males can be kept as a backup if the number of adult survivors is low and will in this case be mated with sorted wt virgin females.\n5. Selection and screening of mutant alleles (Figure 5)\nMass-cross the G0 females with wt males in a cage. Blood-feed them altogether, as would be done for normal colony maintenance.\nOne day post blood-feeding, transfer each G0 female with 2-3 wt males into individual plaster tubes using a mouth aspirator. Feed the flies with sugar on a small cotton ball changed every day and use a syringe of water to ensure the plaster moisture is suitable for egg-laying.\nAfter the G0 females have laid eggs (corresponding to G1), collect their bodies in individual, annotated Eppendorf tubes for later genotyping. Maintain the embryos as usually done for wt colonies.\nExtract the DNA from the G0 females by the method of choice.",
    "Screen the DNA for the presence of mutations, for example by designing a PCR assay using primers surrounding the region of expected CRISPR cuts.\nKeep only the G1 embryos laid by G0 females showing evidence of transformation. When these G1 embryos develop into pupae, separate them by sex and keep only the females. Cross the G1 females from the same G0 female to wt males, blood-feed them, then transfer in small groups of 2-3 females and 4-5 males into small size containers.\n\tNOTE: All G1 individuals have a chance to carry a unique mutation, so if the number of surviving individuals is not too high then it is better to cross G1 females individually with wt males. The case of several females carrying a different mutation present in a same tube is rare but can occur. If such case is observed after genotyping, the G2 progeny females should then be mated individually to wt males. This mating scheme avoids the possibility of multiple mutations in the progeny.\nAfter egg-laying, collect the G1 female bodies and screen them for mutations. Keep only the tubes where at least one female showed evidence of mutation.\nFor later generations make single pair in-crosses. After egg-laying, screen parents for presence of mutation. Repeat at each generation until both parents are homozygous for the same mutation. Once identified, they will be the founders of a homozygous mutant stock.\nSubscription Required.
