    "This study was conducted in accordance with the Tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. The WA09 (H9) ESC line was obtained from the WiCell Research Institute.\n1. Culture media and reagent preparation\nHuman ESC culture medium and passage solution\n\t\nMaintenance medium (MM): Prepare 500 mL of complete MM (Basal Medium + 5x supplement; see Table of Materials) aseptically. Thaw 5x supplement at room temperature (RT) or overnight at 2-8 °C. Prewarm to RT. Stir well before use until the supplement is free of cloudiness.\n1% extracellular matrix (ECM): Use a pre-chilled pipet tip and sterile tubes to dispense 200 µL of ECM (see Table of Materials) per tube on ice. Store the tubes in a -20 °C freezer. Melt ECM on ice and dilute with pre-cooled DMEM/F12 at 1:100.\n0.5 mM pH = 8.0 EDTA: To prepare 500 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA, add 500 µL of 0.5 M EDTA and 0.9 g of NaCl to 500 mL of 1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (see Table of Materials). Mix thoroughly and store at 2-8 °C.\nRetinal differentiation medium\n\t\nGrowth factor-free chemically defined medium (gfCDM): Prepare the gfCDM by combining 45% Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium-GlutaMAX (IMDM-GlutaMAX), 45% Ham's F12-GlutaMAX (F12-Glutamax), 10% knockout serum replacement (KSR), 1% cholesterol lipid concentrate, and 450 µM thioglycerol (see Table of Materials).\nSmall molecule compounds\n\t\nY-27632 2HCl: Add 50 mg of Y-27632 powder to 3.122 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Dispense and store Y-27632 (see Table of Materials) at a concentration of 50 mM at -80 °C for 2 years, keeping away from light. Dilute the stock 2,500 times (20 µM) for use, equivalent to 0.4 µL of Y-27632 per mL of gfCDM.",
    "IWR1-endo: Add 2.4424 mL of DMSO to dissolve 10 mg of IWR1-endo (see Table of Materials) to obtain a 10 mM stock solution. Dispense aliquots and store them at -80 °C for up to 2 years. Add 0.3 µL of 10 mM IWR1-endo per mL of gfCDM for the 3 µM concentration for induction.\nSB431542: To prepare 50 mM SB431542, add 10 mg of SB431542 (see Table of Materials) to 0.5203 mL of DMSO and mix thoroughly. Store at -80 °C in solvent for a maximum of 2 years. For the preparation of SB431542 at a working concentration of 10 µM, add 2 µL of the 50 mM stock solution to 10 mL of gfCDM.\nLDN-193189 2HCl: Dissolve 5 mg of LDN-193189 2HCl (see Table of Materials) in 10.4297 mL of DMSO to get a 1 mM of stock solution. Store at -20 °C or -80 °C (as recommended by the manufacturer). Add 0.1 µL of the stock to every 10 mL of gfCDM, resulting in 100 nM of LDN-193189 for induction.\nRecombinant Human bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4): Reconstitute at 50-200 µg/mL in 4 mM HCl (see Table of Materials). Store at 2 °C to 8 °C for 1 month or -20 °C for 1 year after reconstitution. Perform induction of NR using 1.5 nM BMP4.\nLong-term NR culture medium\n\t\nRetinoic acid (RA): Measure 6 mg of RA powder (see Table of Materials) and add to 3.9941 mL of DMSO. Store in aliquots of 5 mM at −80 °C and use within 3 months. To achieve a working concentration of 0.5 µM, add 10 µL of the master mix to 100 mL of neural retina differentiation medium (NRDM). Add just before use.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep away from light during preparation and storage.",
    "Taurine: Add taurine powder (see Table of Materials) weighing 200 mg to 7.9904 mL of DMSO to obtain a 200 mM stock solution. Dispense and store at 2-8 °C. A working concentration of 0.1 mM taurine is achieved by adding 50 µL of the stock solution per 100 mL of NRDM.\nNRDM: Compose NRDM with DMEM/F12-GlutaMAX medium, 1% N2 supplement, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mM RA and 0.1 mM taurine (see Table of Materials). Store at 2-8 °C for up to 2 weeks or 6 months at -20 °C to ensure the activity of the components.\nBlocking buffer: Dilute 1:9 with DPBS to obtain a 10% working solution for use (see Table of Materials). Store at -20 °C for up to 5 years.\n\t​NOTE: Perform all other procedures in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet to ensure sterility, except for weighing. If adding weighed reagents during the preparation process is necessary, use 0.22 µm filters for filtration.\n2. Culturing of H9-ESCs\nThawing of H9-ESCs\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of 1% ECM to each well of a 6-well plate. Incubate for 1 h in an incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid the addition of ECM along the well walls, because it may stick to the surface.\nTake an H9-ESC cryovial stock from the liquid nitrogen tank and quickly shake it in 37 °C water for 30 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not allow the vial to thaw completely.\nRemove the vial and carefully sterilize it using 75% disinfectant alcohol spray. Add the thawed H9-ESC from the cryovial to a 15 mL tube containing 9 mL MM with 10 µM Y-27632.",
    "Centrifuge the tube at 190 × g for 5 min at RT. Carefully remove most of the supernatant with a 1 mL pipette, leaving approximately 50 µL of supernatant to avoid cell loss.\nAdd 1 mL of MM containing 10 µM of Y27632 to the cell sediment and gently resuspend the cell sediment with a 1 mL pipette by pipetting up and down 5-10 times.\nRemove the ECM coating after 1 h of incubation. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed MM containing 10 µM Y-27632 to each well.\nDispense 0.5 mL of cell suspension per well. Gently shake the plate laterally to ensure even distribution of cells.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for at least 24 h without touching it.\nChange the medium daily. When clone density reaches 70% and above, passaging is required.\nPassaging of H9-ESCs\n\t\nPrepare the ECM-coated plate as described above (step 2.1.1) and add 2 mL of MM per well.\nRemove the spent medium from the 6-well plates. Wash each well twice with 1 mL of DPBS.\nWash each well twice by slowly adding 1 mL of EDTA, and incubating with 1 mL of EDTA for 4-7 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: During the incubation, examine the 6-well plate for 3 min under a microscope. Proceed immediately to the next step if most cells are close to detaching from the dish. Avoid long time incubation to reduce negative impact on the cells.\nDiscard EDTA and add 1 mL of MM to abort digestion.\nGently tap the well plate until the majority of the cells are detached.",
    "Carefully transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube with a 5 mL pipette. Gently resuspend the H9-ESC colonies up and down 3-5 times to mix them with a Pasteur pitette. Transfer 20-100 µL of cell suspension in a new ECM-coated 6-well culture dish and shake it back and forth.\nWhen the cell density is observed as sufficient under a microscope, incubate the plate at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for at least 24 h without touching it.\nChange the media daily. At 70% clone density and above, passage is required.\n3. Generation of human NRs\nNOTE: Once the colonies achieve approximately 70% confluence, they can be directed towards differentiation into retinal organoids (ROs) using the procedural steps outlined in Figure 1.\nDay 0 - Embryoid body (EB) formation\n\t\nAfter washing the cells with 2 mL of DPBS, add 0.5 mL of CDS (see Table of Materials) containing 20 µM Y27632 to the well. Incubate for 3 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Check under a microscope. Reduce the time of incubation as much as possible to avoid harmful effects on the cells.\nAbort digestion by adding 3 mL of MM containing 20 µM Y27632. Centrifuge at 190 × g for 5 min and discard supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of gfCDM containing 20 µM Y27632, and count the cells. Add the corresponding volume for 1.2 × 106 cells (1.2 × 104 cells per well) to 10 mL of gfCDM, which is pre-incorporated with 20 µM Y-27632, 3 µM IWR1-endo, 10 µM SB431542, and 100 nM LDN-193189 (see Table of Materials).\nAdd 100 µL of cell suspension to each well of 96 V-bottomed conical wells. Place the plate in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator until day 6.",
    "NOTE: Do not move the dishes for at least 24 h to enhance the adherence of EBs.\nDay 6 - Retina induction\n\t\nOn day 6, add 10 mL of gfCDM containing 55 ng/mL BMP4 to allow a complete change of culture medium on the EBs. Return the plate to the incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Pipette toward the walls of the 96 V-bottomed conical well to avoid air bubbles. Avoid taking up any organoids when changing the medium.\nCarry out half-medium change on day 9, day 12 and day 15. Replace half of the medium with fresh gfCDM to gradually dilute the BMP4.\nDay 18 - Long term NR culture\n\t\nOn day 18, carefully transfer the formed EBs to 15 mL centrifuge tubes using 5 mL Pasteur pipettes and gently rinse again with NRDM. Transfer the EBs to low-adsorption 6-well or 24-well plates (see Table of Materials). Return the plate to the incubator.\nReplace the medium with fresh NRDM every 3 days.\n\t\t​NOTE: Switch off the light during the medium change because the RA is light-sensitive. Remove badly differentiated organoids, and separate adherent organoids under a microscope.\n4. Analysis of human NRs\nMounting of the ROs\n\t\nSelect different generations of H9-ESCs to induce three batches of ROs.\n\t\tNOTE: Three plates of the number of forming NRs for each of the three assessed methods (Kuwahara et al.12, Döpper et al.27, and the modified method in the present study) are calculated to assess the induction success rate. Induction is considered successful if light microscopy reveals the formation of neuroepithelial-like structures on day 30.\nImmunofluorescent staining of ROs",
    "Transfer 3-5 ROs to 1.5 mL tubes. Pipette off excess medium and wash the ROs once with 1 mL of DPBS at RT. Allow the ROs to sink and carefully remove the DPBS. Add 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (see Table of Materials) per 1.5 mL tube and fix at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: ROs on day 6 and day 18, fix 2 h. Fix for 12 h on day 30 and 14 h on day 60.\nAfter fixation, dehydrate using gradient alcohol. Leave the ROs to stand for 15 min each in 50%, 60%, and 70% alcohol, and subsequently for 10 min each in 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%, and 100% alcohol. Then, add a 1:1 mix of 100% alcohol and xylene for 10 min, followed by xylene twice for 10 min each.\nPlace the ROs in metal molds filled with melted paraplast (see Table of Materials) for 40 min, and then quench the molds on ice to fix the ROs. Place embedding boxes into the molds and freeze them at -20 °C overnight. Subsequently, carefully detach the embedding boxes. Finally, store them at RT.\nCreate continuous sections (5 µm thickness) with a paraffin slicer. Fix slices on adhesion microscope slides, dry, and store at RT.\nPerform dewaxing and rehydration before antigen repair12,27.\nAdd 10 mL of 20x pH 6.0 Citrate Antigen Retrieval Solution (see Table of Materials) to 190 mL of ddH2O (double distilled H2O). Heat in a microwave on high mode for 4 min until boiling. After adding paraffin sections, heat the sections on low mode for 20 min to complete antigen repair.\nAllow paraffin sections to cool naturally in a ventilated area and then put them into a humid chamber.",
    "Use a pap pen (see Table of Materials) to outline the sections. Incubate with 0.2% Triton X-100 at RT for 30 min to break the membranes, followed by washing the slides three times with TPBS, for 5 min each.\nBlock with 10% donkey serum diluted in DPBS at RT for 1 h in a humid chamber with 10 µL per staining area.\nAdd primary antibodies diluted in 10% donkey serum. Incubate overnight at 4 °C in a humidity chamber. Wash samples thrice with TPBS for 10 min each to remove the unbound antibody.\n\t\tNOTE: Primary antibodies are as follows: anti-PAX6 (1: 250), anti-SOX2 (1: 200), anti-KI67 (1: 200), anti-CHX10 (1: 200), anti-β tubulin III (1: 250) and anti-NESTIN (1: 200) (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate with secondary antibodies diluted in DPBS for 1 h at RT in a humidified chamber. Repeat the wash step with TPBS three times for 10 min each.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep in the dark to prevent quenching of the fluorescent secondary antibody. Secondary antibodies are Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated with donkey anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:400 (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate with DPBS containing DAPI (1: 500; see Table of Materials) for 10 min at RT in the dark. Wash three times with TPBS for 10 min each.\nDrop an appropriate amount of anti-fluorescent sealer (see Table of Materials) onto the slide and cover with cover slips.\nVisualize using a flow-like tissue cell quantitative analyzer (see Table of Materials), or similar.\nStore slides at -20 °C in the dark after microscopic analysis.\nSubscription Required.
