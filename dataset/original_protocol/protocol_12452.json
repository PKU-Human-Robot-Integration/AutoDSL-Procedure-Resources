    "The protocol follows the ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association and the World Medical Association (revised declaration of Helsinki, 1989).\n1. General Experimental Setup\nCollect data, concerning distractor-response binding effects, in reaction time experiments via computer.\n2. Preparation of the Experiment\nUse a standard experimental software to program the experiment. Most of the previous studies used E-Prime.\nDecide on the stimulus material. Distractor-response binding has been shown with single letters, digits, colored dots, icons, and locations.\nCreate one stimulus set from which both targets and distractors will be drawn. For example, this set can include the eight letters S, D, F, G, H, J, K, and L.\n\t\nSeparate the stimulus set into four groups and assign one response to each group. For example, assign S and D to a button press with the left middle finger, F and G to a button press with the left index Finger, H and J to a button press with the right index finger, and K and L to a button press with the right middle finger.\nDecide on a stimulus arrangement. Be sure to present target and distractor stimuli in a grouped fashion. Gestalt principles help to implement grouping of stimuli. For example, present letters in a horizontal rather than a vertical line.\nDecide on the criterion for target selection. This can remain unchanged throughout the experiment, but it can also be indicated before each display. For example, present targets and distractors in a horizontal line, and define certain locations to contain the target (e.g. “DKDKD”, with K as the target and D as the distractor). Use the same stimulus arrangement for all displays throughout the experiment.",
    "Prepare six different kinds of trial types (i.e. prime probe sequences), orthogonally varying response relation (response repetition with same target vs. response repetition with different targets vs. response change) and distractor relation (distractor repetition vs. distractor change). In each prime and each probe arrangement, be careful to combine distractors and targets that are mapped to different responses.\n\t\nFor trial type RRi-DR, implement response repetition between the response to the prime target and the response to the probe target by presenting the same target stimulus identity on the prime and the probe display. Implement distractor repetition by presenting the same distractor stimulus on the prime and the probe display.\nFor trial type RRi-DC, implement response repetition by presenting the same target stimulus identity on the prime and the probe display. Implement distractor change by presenting different distractor stimuli on the prime and the probe display.\nFor trial type RR-DR, implement response repetition by presenting a target stimulus from the same response category on the prime and the probe display. Implement distractor repetition by presenting the same distractor stimulus on the prime and the probe display.\nFor trial type RR-DC, implement response repetition by presenting a target stimulus from the same response category on the prime and the probe display. Implement distractor change by presenting different distractor stimuli on the prime and the probe display.\nFor trial type RC-DR, implement response change by presenting a target stimulus from different response categories on the prime and the probe display. Implement distractor repetition by presenting the same distractor stimulus on the prime and the probe display.\nFor trial type RC-DC, implement response change by presenting a target stimulus from different response categories on the prime and the probe display. Implement distractor change by presenting different distractor stimuli on the prime and the probe display.",
    "Under the restrictions defined by the respective trial type, randomly assign stimuli from the stimulus set to the roles of prime target, prime distractor, probe target and probe distractor. Remember to be careful in each prime and each probe arrangement to use distractors that are mapped to a different than the target response. Do the assignments for each trial type and repeat this 30x, resulting in 180 trials.\nRandomize the order of the 180 trials.\nUse a random sample of 60 trials for a practice block.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nWelcome participant(s) and assign computers. Testing in groups is possible. Testing participants in individual sound proof chambers is preferable.\nCollect additional data like age, gender and defective vision first.\nGive written instructions that include a description of the task (always press the button assigned to the target stimulus while ignoring the distractor stimulus) and the reminder to respond as fast as possible without making errors. Instructions can be given via the computer screen.\nPresent the following displays in each trial (see Figure 1). The single letters should have a horizontal and vertical visual angle between 0.5° and 1°. Present target and distractor stimuli in each prime and each probe display adjacent to each other (maximizing grouping of the stimuli).\n\t\nPresent a cue (e.g. an asterisk) that indicates to the participants that the next trial can be started by pressing the space bar. Breaks can be taken at this point between trials, before pressing the space bar. (Alternatively, use an intertrial interval of 1,500 msec).\nPresent a fixation marker (e.g. a plus sign) at the center of the screen for 500 msec.\nPresent the prime display at the center of the screen until the participant responds by pressing one of the response buttons.",
    "Log the prime response time (prime onset until response) and accuracy of the prime response.\nIn case of an inaccurate response, present a warning for 1,500 msec that reminds the participant to react as fast but also as correct as possible.\nPresent a fixation marker (e.g. a plus sign) at the center of the screen for 500 msec. Be careful to keep this time between prime response and probe onset shorter than 1,000 msec.\nPresent the probe display at the center of the screen until the participant responds by pressing one of the response buttons.\nLog the probe response time (probe onset until response) and accuracy of the probe response.\nIn case of an inaccurate response, present a warning for 1,500 msec that reminds the participant to react as fast as possible but without making errors.\nOmit response repetition trials with target identity repetition (i.e. RRi trials) to exclude influences of target identity repetition effects.\nFor the analyses of probe response times, only consider trials with correct responses to the prime and the probe and exclude anticipatory (below 200 msec) and outlier response times (e.g. Tukey26).\nEnter probe response times into a 2 (Response Relation: repetition vs. change) × 2 (Distractor Relation: repetition vs. change) ANOVA. The same ANOVA can be used to analyze probe error rates.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
