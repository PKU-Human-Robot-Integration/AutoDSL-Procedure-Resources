The dissection should be done on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/875-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissecting hippocampi\nA full brain shown along with a dotted line illustrating where the brain should be cut (i). A half brain with the arrows showing where to dissect with the tools to isolate the hippocampus (ii & iii). The hippocampus being isolated can be seen (red arrow; iv). An isolated hippocampus (v).\nPlace the two spatulas at the indicated arrows.\nThe top spatula should be held straight and forced down into the tissue.\nPull the other spatula that is in contact with the cerebellum back, opening up the tissue at the point where cerebellum and cerebrum meet.\nOnce the cerebellum is pulled back, hippocampus should be easily detectable.\nWith the curved spatula, lift the hippocampus from the tissue and cut it with the edges of the spatula from the rest of the brain\nAfter isolating the hippocampus, put all of them in cold HBSS w/o prepared earlier.\nAt this point, separate and collect the hippocampi in different 15 mL tubes depending on the age and/or the genotypes you have.\nKeep the tubes with the hippocampi in the HBSS w/o on ice.\nUsing a pipette, carefully remove the HBSS w/o from the tubes.\nAdd the prewarmed Enzyme Mix 1 gently into the tube, lifting the tissue from the bottom of the tube. The total volume prepared for Enzyme Mix 1 is ample for up to 10 hippocampi.",
    "Using a 2mL pipette, transfer the Enzyme Mix 1 with the hippocampi to a labeled C tube.\nClose the C tube and flick it upside down to push the hippocampi to the top of the tube.\nAttach the C tube upside down onto the gentleMACS Dissociator.\nRun the program “m_brain_01.01”.\nAfter the program is complete, take off the C tube and flick the tube so that the hippocampi are on the bottom of the tube now.\nPlace the tube in the MACSmix Tube Rotator and allow it to rotate slowly for 15 min at 37°C.\nAfter the run is over, take the tube off and flip the tissue to the lid again.\nPlace the C tube on the gentleMACS dissociator and run the program “m_brain_02.01”.\nAfter the program is run, add Enzyme Mix 2 to the tube.\nPut the tube onto the MACSmix Tube Rotator again and allow it to rotate slowly for 10 min at 37°C.\nOnce the 10 min are complete, flick the C tube again to flip the tissue to the lid.\nPlace the C tube on the gentleMACS Dissociator and run program “m_brain_03.01”.\nAfter the program is run, flip the tissue to the bottom again.\nPlace the C tube in the MACSmix Tube Rotator and allow it to rotate slowly for 10 min at 37°C.\nAfter the run, centrifuge the C tube at 300g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C. This will bring all the tissue to the bottom of the tube.\nPlace a 70μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL tube.\nPre-wet a 70μm cell strainer with 1m L of warm HBSS w/.\nAfter centrifugation, gently resuspend the pellet in its own supernatant using a 1mL pipette.\nAdd all of the cell suspension to the strainer.",
    "Add 1mL of warm HBSS w/ to the C tube to rinse it and then apply it onto the cell strainer.\nWash the cell strainer with preheated HBSS w/.\nTake the cell strainer off carefully so as not to spill any liquid hanging from the bottom of the strainer.\nTransfer the liquid to a labeled 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant by aspirating it.\nThe cell pellet at the bottom of the tube will be easily evident at this stage.\nResuspend the pellet in 10mL of the cold 7.2% sucrose solution prepared earlier.\nCentrifuge this tube at 850g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAfter the centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant carefully as the pellet would be small.\nTo be cautious, aspirate the last few μls with a 200 μL pipette.\nResuspend the pellet again in 10mL warm HBSS w/.\nCentrifuge this for 10 min at 300g at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant after the spin and resuspend the pellet in 1mL preheated culturing media prepared earlier.\nPut 10mL warm media in a 100x15mm dish (Thermo Fisher Cat# 150350).\nAdd the 1mL media with the cells to the dish.\nThe NSCs should be first fed 2 days after the isolation. For feeding the NSCs, follow the steps below;\nTake out 7mL of media and spin it at 120g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nReplace the media in the plate with 8mL of freshly prepared culturing media. Some media will evaporate in the incubator, hence more media is added. Depending on the total volume in the dish, lower volume can be added.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1mL of warm media.\nAdd the resuspended cells to the dish.",
    "Feed the NSCs with fresh culturing media prepared as outlined above every 2–3 days. The typical schedule is Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Wait for the isolated NSCs to form neurospheres and then passage them as described below. NSCs should make neurospheres twice before proceeding with the FLIP assay.\nThe risk of cultured NSCs differentiating is negligible in these conditions. They will only differentiate upon withdrawal of mitogens(Walker and Kempermann, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). However, to make certain that the NSCs are still pluripotent, they can be stained against Nestin.\nPause point: At this stage, cells need to be cultured in vitro, providing the opportunity to pause before proceeding with the protocol below.\nCritical: Putting the brain in cold HBSS w/o for a few minutes ideally helps with the dissection as the tissue becomes more rigid. Be careful when dissecting not to crush the hippocampus.\nPassaging and electroporating NSCs for FLIP\nTiming: 1h\nHere, NSCs will be passaged and electroporated with the recombinant DNA before being plated for FLIP.\nCulture the NSCs until they form neurospheres as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. These neurospheres should be allowed to grow to a maximum diameter of approximately 100μm. At this stage, the NSCs will need to be passaged. Troubleshooting 1.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/875-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Neurospheres formed by NSCs are shown\nScale bar represents 50μm\nTransfer the entire media in the plate to a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 80g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100μL of warm trypsin prepared as outlined above.\nIncubate the tube at 37°C in a water-bath for 5 min.\nAdd 200μL of trypsin inhibitor prepared as outlined above to the tube. Lightly tap the tube at this point.\nIncubate the tube for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "After the 5 min, use a 1mL pipette to pipette the mixture with the cells up and down approximately 20 times until the mixture turns cloudy.\nFollowing this, count the cells. 4x106 cells will be used for electroporation. Add the volume corresponding to the number of cells required into a 15mL tube.\nCentrifuge tube at 200g for 4 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in the Nucleofector Solution mixed with DNA earlier (Reagent preparation for electroporating NSCs with recombinant DNA).\nTransfer the resuspended NSCs to the cuvettes supplied with the Nucleofector kit.\nInsert the cuvette into the Nucleofector device and run the program.\nImmediately afterward, take the cuvette out and add 1mL of prewarmed culturing media.\nPlate 9x105 cells per well in the coated Nunc Lab-Tek 4-well chambered coverglass. These chambered coverglass were previously coated with Poly-L-Ornithine and Laminin (Reagent preparation for culturing and plating NSCs for FLIP assays).\nPlate the remaining cells in a 100x15mm dish with preheated culturing media.\nAfter plating the NSCs, incubate the Nunc Lab-Tek 4-well chambered coverglass at 37°C for 16 h.\nFollowing the incubation, wash the cells twice with 1mL of PBS to remove any dead cells and debris.\nAdd 1mL of prewarmed media 3 h before starting the FLIP assays.\nCritical: Once the cells are resuspended in the Nucleofector Solution, the following steps must be completed as quickly as possible until warm media is added to prevent high cell death.\nFLIP assay\nTiming: 30 mins per cell",
    "After plating the NSCs and keeping them in 37°C incubator for 16 h, the FLIP assays can be performed on them. FLIP assays allow visualization of diffusion dynamics. An area is selectively bleached and the changes in the fluorescence intensities in the sample is measured, including in the area bleached. The rate of decay of fluorescence is an indirect measure of the diffusion dynamics of the specific protein. Using this, we have developed the following protocol to look for the presence of a diffusion barrier in a dividing NSC.\nPlace the Nunc Lab-Tek 4-well chambered coverglass with the NSCs on the stage.\nThis protocol has been optimized for 63x oil immersive objective.\nUsing the eyepiece, scan the cuvette to search for a cell in mitosis.\nIdeally, cells in late metaphase should be found.\nCells in mitosis would not be attached to the surface and therefore, scan approximately 5–10 μm above the surface as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/875-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) assay\n(A) A z-stack along the z and x axis is shown where the gap between each image is 2um. The dividing cell expressing LumER-GFP is highlighted by the dotted circles (left). The same stack is shown along the x and y axis where the same cell is highlighted (right) starting up from the surface of the plate.\n(B) A dividing cell expressing MemER-GFP (Sel1L-GFP) undergoing FLIP is shown. MemER-GFP labels the ER membrane. At the onset of anaphase, first frame, the region shown in white is bleached. Time-lapse images post-bleaching are shown where the dividing cell is divided into the bleached compartment (red) and unbleached compartment (blue).\nScale bar represents 20 μm (A) and 5 μm (B).",
    "Once the cell is found, wait for the cell to start anaphase. For a cell in metaphase, this waiting time is typically 5 min. Troubleshooting 2.\nTo identify the start of anaphase, focus on the shape of the cell. Anaphase would result in the cell elongating along an axis.\nAs soon as the cell starts elongating, select a region adjacent to the future cleavage furrow as indicated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nOnce the cell starts anaphase, select the best z-slice and immediately start the experiment. Troubleshooting 3.\nThe range of laser power used for acquisition is between 1% and 4%. However, laser power used depends on the microscope and the lasers being used.\nAfter the acquisition of the first image (the pre-bleach image), select a region with high GFP signal and use the region of interest drawn earlier to bleach it.\nAfter the bleach, an image would be automatically acquired.\nAfter the second image is acquired, select the region bleached earlier and bleach it again.\nNote, because the cell is undergoing anaphase, it is unlikely that the region bleached earlier will be in the exact same place again, hence the region of interest drawn earlier might need to be moved slightly to the corresponding area.\nRepeat this process until there is no GFP signal visible in between the two dividing compartments of the cell. Troubleshooting 4.\nThis process usually takes between 3 to 4 min approximately.\nOnce FLIP has been performed on the specific cell, save the image file as desired and then refer back to step 52 to include more cells.\nCritical: Only perform bleaching once the cell enters anaphase, i.e., starts elongating. Bleaching earlier would result in unreliable results.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
    "Methods video S1. FLIP with MemER-GFP (Sel1L-GFP), related to step 59\nThe area shown in white is bleached repeatedly from the onset of anaphase until no GFP signal is visible between the two cells\nScale bar represents 5μm.\nAnalyzing loss of fluorescence\nTiming: 1h\nTo analyze the fluorescence loss in the bleached and the unbleached compartments, use ImageJ;\nDraw the regions of interest around the bleached and unbleached compartments.\nMeasure the area and the intensity of the all the regions of interest for bleached and unbleached in the time-lapse. Divide the fluorescence signal by the area for each frame to calculate the fluorescence intensities for both the bleached and the unbleached.\nDraw a region of interest around a dark region with no fluorescence. Divide the fluorescence signal by the area to calculate the background fluorescence intensity.\nSubtract the background fluorescence intensities for each frame from both the bleached and the unbleached fluorescence intensities.\nUse the following equation to normalize the fluorescence intensities for the bleached and unbleached compartments. Note, the first frame was taken pre-bleach, hence we here normalize the fluorescence for both compartments to the pre-bleach intensity. This analysis is performed in Excel. Troubleshooting 5.\n  Normalized  Intensity =    Fluorescence  intensity   n  th    Frame   Fluorescence  intensity  1 st  Frame    × 100  \nAfter performing the above calculation for both compartments for all cells, compile the data from all cells into a table in a separate sheet.\nThe time, in seconds, is calculated as follows where 12 is the interval between frames.\n  Time =  (  Frame  N − 1  )  × 12  \nThe normalized values for the bleached and the unbleached compartments calculated before.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_875_6.csv\nExport the data from Excel into an XY table in Prism.",
    "In Prism, fit the data to one-phase decay, which can be found under Analyze> Non-linear Regression. This fits the bleached and the unbleached data to the following equation.\n  Y =  (  Y 0  − Plateau )  ×  e  − Kx   + Plateau   \nWhere Y0 is the y-intercept.\nUnder constraints, set this to be equal to 100.\nPlateau is the value of Y at X infinity.\nUnder constraints, set this to be equal to 0.\nK is the rate constant.\nUnder constrains, set this unconstrained.\nOnce the data is fitted, plot the data and the fitted curves to assess how well the data fits plotted curve.\nTransfer the results from the fits under the results tab to an Excel sheet for both bleached and unbleached data.\nRearrange the equation above as follows.\n  X =   ln  (   Y − Plateau    Y 0  − Plateau   )    − K    \nNote, X denotes the time it takes to reach certain fluorescence.\nFrom the data transferred from Prism, substitute the value of K. The value of Y should be set at 80. The values for Plateau and Y0 have already been preassigned to 100 and 0, respectively. Perform this calculation for both the bleached and the unbleached compartments.\nThe calculate value of X would be the time it takes for the compartment to reach 80% of the original fluorescent signal, i.e., lose 20% of fluorescence.\nTo calculate the strength of the barrier, use the following equation.\n  Barrier  S trength =    X  Unbleached      X  Bleached     \nTo calculate the total error in the barrier strength calculations, use the following equation\n   Total  Error  for  each  compartment = − s e K  ×   ln  (    Y − Plateau   YO − Plateau   )    K 2",
    "Where seK (standard error in K) is already calculated in Prism and should be in the data copied over from fits.\nCalculate the standard error for each compartment using the following equations.
