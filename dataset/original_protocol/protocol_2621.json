    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTumor extraction and dissociation\nTiming: 1.5∼2 h\nThis step will detailly illustrate how to extract tumor tissues and get single-cell suspensions.\nEuthanize the mouse using carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation.\nTake the tumor tissues and place them on 6-well plate that contain 3 mL cold RPMI 1640 on ice until processing (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2278-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Processing the tissues\n(A) Extraction of B16 tumor tissues.\n(B) GentleMACS C Tube that transferred with tumor tissue suspension.\n(C) GentleMACS Octo Dissociator that used to digest tumor tissues.\n(D) Image of cell suspension of tumor tissues before and after gradient centrifugation.\nRemove fat, fibrous and necrotic areas from the tumor samples.\nBlot the tumors on Kimtech wipes and weigh them.\nCut the tumors into small pieces of 2–4 mm with scissor in a 2 mL tube filled with 1 mL pre-prepared enzyme mix on ice.\nTransfer the tumor tissues into the gentleMACS C Tube and fill the tubes with pre-prepared enzyme mix (1 mL enzyme mix for 100 mg tumor, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTightly close C Tube and attach it upside down onto the sleeve of the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator and inserted the heaters around the tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nChoose “Soft/medium 37C_m_TDK_1 Program” that preexist in the machine and run the selected program.\nAfter termination of the program, detach C Tube from the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator.\nPerform a short centrifugation (500 g for 10 s) step to collect the sample materials remain on the lids of C tube.\nResuspend sample and check digestion condition of tumor tissues by using a 1 mL micropipette to pipette up and down.\nCheck if tumor tissues are well digested by checking that there are no obvious debris present and micropipette can pipette smoothly.\nStop the digestion by adding 1 mL cold FBS.",
    "Filter digested sample suspension on a 70 μm MACS SmartStrainer placed on a 15 mL tube.\nWash cell MACS SmartStrainer with RPMI 1640 until the liquid volume up to 14 mL.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 50 × g for 5 min and collect the supernatant. This step is used to remove part of tumor cells and debris.\nCentrifuge supernatant at 500 g for 5 min. Aspirate supernatant completely and collect cell pellet.\nResuspend cells with 6 mL 40% percoll by pipetting up and down.\nTransfer 6 mL of 80% Percoll into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and carefully layer a total of 6 mL of tumor cell suspension onto the 80% Percoll with a pasteur pipette without intermixing of the two Percoll densities (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCentrifugate samples at 1,260 g for 20 min at room temperature with the acceleration at the lowest setting and no break.\nUsing a vacuum aspirator connected to a p200 micropipette tip to carefully remove top layer of the sample, and then collect the middle interface layer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) by a p1000 micropipette and transfer them into a new 15-mL tube containing 10 mL of FACS buffer.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 5 min, discard the supernatant and resuspend with 2 mL T cell culture medium.\nCritical: For the analysis of tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), it is recommended to make the content of enzyme R to 0.4% in the enzyme mix, which will help to preserve cell surface epitopes but may lead to lower cell yields and viability of endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and tumor-associated fibroblasts.\nCritical: When placed the tube C into the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator, it has to be ensured that the sample material is located in the area of the rotor/stator.\nLipid peroxidation sensor and antibody staining\nTiming: 80 min",
    "This step details how to stain single cell suspension in tumor tissues with lipid peroxidation sensor and indicated surface antibodies.\nCount acquired single cell suspension from tumor tissues.\nSeed 5 million single cell suspension into one well of 24-well plate with 1.9 mL T cell culture medium for each sample. In addition, seed two extra wells for unstained or H2O2 treatment.\nTreat cells with PBS or 5 μL 30% H2O2.\nAdd 100 μL lipid peroxidation sensor BODIPY 581/591 C11 working solution into cell culture medium in step 22, except for the unstained well.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 cell incubator for 30 min.\nLabel 5 mL FACS tubes for each sample and transfer cells in each well to the tubes.\nAdd 1 mL FACS buffer into each tube and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 100 μL flow cytometry antibody mix (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] part), or 100 μL FACS buffer for unstained sample, incubate at 4°C for 15 min in the dark.\nWash stained cells with 1 mL of FACS buffer, vortex briefly and centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet with 500 μL FACs buffer, placed cells on the ice.\nAlternatives: if BODIPY™ 581/591 C11 is out of order, Lipid Peroxidation Assay Kit (Cell-based) (ab243377) from Abcam is a good choice.\nData collection and analysis\nTiming: 1∼2 h\nThis step illustrates how to collect data on a BD symphony flow cytometer and analyze data on FlowJo software.\nCollect data on a BD Symphony flow cytometer.\nOpen the machine and software, choose FITC, PE, APC and BV421 laser.\nUse unstained sample and H2O2 treated positive control sample to set appropriate PMT voltages.",
    "Gate Thy1.1+ CD8+ T cells as showed in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and collect data from each sample.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2278-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Analysis of lipid peroxidation level of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues\n(A) The gating strategy of Thy1.1+ CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues.\n(B) Choose “a/b derive parameters” in “workspace” menu.\n(C) Get lipid peroxidation value of Thy1.1+ CD8+ T cells.\n(D) Lipid peroxidation levels on PBS or H2O2 treated adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells.\nData analysis.\nExport collected fcs files and opened it in the FlowJo software.\nGating Thy1.1+ CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nTo get the ratiometric measurement of lipid peroxidation level, choose “a/b derive parameters” in “Workspace” (if FlowJo is Experienced mode) or “Tools” (if FlowJo is Advanced mode) menu. For more information, please see the FlowJo website (https://docs.flowjo.com/flowjo/experiment-based-platforms/plat-derived-overview/[href=https://docs.flowjo.com/flowjo/experiment-based-platforms/plat-derived-overview/]) and it is reiterated below (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nClick on a sample in the workspace, go to the Instrumentation band under the “Tools” tab and select “a/b Derived Parameters” (left panel in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-i). This will bring up the “Derived Parameter window” as right panel in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nAt the top of “Derived Parameter window”, give your new parameter a name (default is Derived). Spaces are not allowed in the new parameter name (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-ii).\nAt the bottom of “Derived Parameter window”, there are several dropdown menus. First, choose “BB515-A” (equal to FITC) in the dropdown menu named Insert Reference; Second, choose “/division” function in the dropdown menu named Insert Function; Third, choose “PE-A” in the dropdown menu named Insert Reference (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-iii).\nIn the dropdown menu named Scale, choose “Logarithm” for the new parameter and set the X-axis to an appropriate range by changing the values in Min and Max (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-iv).",
    "Apply the new parameter to a single sample by clicking OK, or to a group by dragging the Derived Parameter node to the group in the workspace.\nChoosing statistical analysis of gated cells for “Median-Derived” to get lipid peroxidation value (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nOptional: Fluorescence microscope can be used to detect lipid peroxidation level by using traditional Texas Red® (590 nm) and FITC (510 nm) emission filters.\nNote: In this experiment, we analyzed adoptively transferred Thy1.1 (also named as CD90.1) + CD8+ T cells in tumors tissues. For lipid peroxidation detection, it’s better to collect cells by flow cytometer within 2 h after incubation in case of fluorescence quenching.\nNote: Researchers who are not familiar with flow cytometry can refer to Cossarizza et al. for the guidelines.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nNote: In order to detect lipid peroxidation of cells within 2 h after incubation, researchers should reserve flow cytometry machine earlier.\nPause point: Researchers can pause the experiment after step 31."
