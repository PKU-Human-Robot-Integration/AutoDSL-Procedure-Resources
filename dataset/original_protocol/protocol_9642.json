  "procedures": [
    "All experiments performed herein used the commercially available H9 human iPSC line. Common commercially and non-commercially available human pluripotent stem cell lines (i.e., H9, NC8) have also been tested and proven effective for the generation of human blood vessel organoids using this protocol. For details, please refer to our previously published reports8,10.\n1. Media and reagent formulation for the generation of human blood vessel organoids\nPrepare the aggregation medium.\n\t\nMix 40 mL of knock-out DMEM/F12 (low osmolality medium without L-glutamine or HEPES buffer optimized for human ESC and iPSC growth), 10 mL of knock-out serum replacer (KOSR), 0.5 mL of 200 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide in 0.85% NaCl, 0.5 mL of non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 35 µL of beta-mercaptoethanol (BME, 100 µL of 2-mercaptoethanol in 10 mL of sterile PBS), and Y-27632 (cell-permeable and selective inhibitor of Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase [ROCK]14 [10 mM] at 1:200) (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare N2B27 (N2 and B27 supplemented basic medium).\n\t\nMix 25 mL of DMEM/F12, 25 mL of neurobasal media, 1 mL of B27 supplement, 0.5 mL of N2 supplement, 250 µL of 200 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide in 0.85% NaCl, and 35 µL of beta-mercaptoethanol (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare the mesoderm induction medium.\n\t\nSupplement N2B27 medium with ChiR (12 µM, GSK3a/b inhibitor stimulating mesoderm induction) and BMP-4 (30 ng/mL, MSX2 activator inducing mesoderm lineage).\n\t\tNOTE: Stock (ChiR): 10 mM (use 1:833, or 1.2 µL/mL N2B27). Stock (BMP-4): 100 µg/mL (use 1:3333, or 0.3 µL/mL N2B27) (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare vascular induction medium.\n\t\nSupplement N2B27 medium with VEGFA (100 ng/mL) and forskolin (2 µM) (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare the extracellular matrix (ECM).",
    "Use 1 mL of ECM for one well of a 12-well plate (for embedding 30-50 aggregates). Of the 1 mL of ECM solution used for each well, use 0.5 mL to create a bottom layer, \"layer 1\", which will serve as an ECM foundation, and 0.5 mL plus aggregates for the top layer, \"layer 2\". Using this approach provides, through the ECM suspension, sufficient space and support for the human blood vessel networks to sprout in all directions.\n\t\tNOTE: Overall, 1 mL of ECM contains 500 µL of purified bovine collagen type I, 250 µL of solubilized basement membrane matrix secreted by Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells (see Table of Materials), and 250 µL of basic matrix solution (step 1.5.2). Prepare it fresh and keep on ice until ready to use.\nTo prepare the basic matrix solution for four 12-well plates (48 wells), mix 5.627 mL of 0.1 N NaOH, 2.498 mL of 10x DMEM, 473 µL of HEPES, 368 µL of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate, 233 µL of 200 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide in 0.85% NaCl, and 3.451 mL of Ham's F-12 (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: The leftover basic matrix solution can be placed in a capped 50 mL high-clarity polypropylene conical tube and stored at 4 ˚C for use for up to 2 months.\nPrepare the sprouting medium.\n\t\nSpecifically formulate 50 mL of flexible serum-free medium (SFM) to support the development of human hematopoietic cells, a 1.3 mL aliquot of the flexible serum-free medium nutrient supplement, 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 250 µL of penicillin-streptomycin, 500 µL of 200 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide in 0.85% NaCl, VEGFA (100 ng/mL), and FGF2 (100 ng/mL) (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare the blocking buffer.",
    "Mix 0.5 g of bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mL of fetal bovine serum, 250 µL of Tween 20, 250 µL of Triton X-100, 500 µL of sodium deoxycholate (1% wt/vol stock), and 47.5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (see Table of Materials). Pipette up and down until all the components are well incorporated and the solution is clear.\n2. Maintenance and culture of human pluripotent and induced pluripotent stem cell\nPerform cell culture using LDEV-free reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix (1:50 dilution)-coated 6-well tissue culture plates with stem cell culture medium (see Table of Materials).\nOnce the cells reach ~70% confluency, passage them using 1 mL of mammalian cell dissociating enzyme (see Table of Materials) for 3-4 min at 37 ˚C.\n\tNOTE: Splitting the cells at a ratio of 1:6 enhances the cell viability and achieves confluency within 2-4 days for most human stem cell lines. To increase the cell viability, ROCK inhibitor Y-27632-supplemented (10 mM, 1:1,000) culture medium is used for 24 h post passaging.\nChange the culture medium daily until a confluency of 70% is reached.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, at 70% confluency, one well of a 6-well cell culture plate contains around 1 million H9 hPSCs.\n3. Day 0 - Generation of pluripotent aggregates from a single-cell suspension\nNOTE: A confluency of 70% in two wells of a 6-well culture plate will yield approximately 175 hBVOs.\nUsing either a pipette or vacuum system, aspirate the culture medium, replace it with 1 mL of cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials), and incubate for 5 min at 37 ˚C.",
    "While the cells are under the cell dissociation reagent, prepare the necessary volume of aggregation medium (step 1.1) in a 15 mL conical tube as needed for the desired number of wells in a 6-well ultra-low attachment culture plate (see Table of Materials).\nAspirate the 1 mL of cell dissociation reagent, and suspend the cells in 1 mL of aggregation medium. Create a single-cell suspension with gentle up-down pipetting prior to counting the samples.\n\tCAUTION: hPSCs are quite sensitive to mechanical stress and cannot tolerate aggressive pipetting.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counting device10 or a standardized system under a microscope. Calculate the cell number needed for the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the cell line, 200,000 cells/well to 300,000 cells/well is considered ideal for aggregate formation (i.e., 4 wells = 800,000 to 1,200,000 cells in total).\nAdd the appropriate volume of the cell suspension to the aggregation medium in the 15 mL high-clarity polypropylene conical tube. Gently pipette the diluted cell suspension up and down to ensure a homogenous cell distribution.\nPipette 3 mL of the diluted cell suspension into each desired well of the 6-well ultra-low attachment culture plate.\nPlace the plate in the incubator (37 ˚C, 5% CO2, >90% humidity), and avoid opening and closing the incubator doors as much as possible.\n\tNOTE: This initial step is best completed in the evenings or during low incubator traffic. Even slight vibrations can affect the size and shape of the aggregates, which can impair the results.\n4. Day 1 - Mesoderm induction of aggregates\nEnsure that 24 h post seeding, small aggregates comprising 2-10 cells are visible under the microscope. Collect the aggregates, and allow them to settle prior to changing the medium to the mesoderm induction medium (step 1.3).",
    "Set up one 15 mL high-clarity polypropylene conical tube per well of the 6-well ultra-low attachment culture plate.\nUse a circular motion (i.e., like an orbital shaker) to gather the aggregates in the center of each well, use a 1 mL pipette to gently collect the aggregates and the surrounding medium from each well, place them into their corresponding 15 mL high-clarity polypropylene conical tubes, and allow the aggregates to sediment at room temperature.\nOnce collected, set a timer for 1 h, which is the time required for most cell lines/aggregates to sediment at this stage.\n\tNOTE: If the time is less than 1 h, one might lose any aggregates that may not have settled to the bottom of the 15 mL conical tube.\nOnce the hour has passed, with caution, aspirate the supernatant with a pipette or a high-sensitivity aspirating pump. Ensure the aggregates remain undisturbed at the bottom of the 15 mL conical tube.\nResuspend the aggregates of each 15 mL conical tube in 2 mL of mesoderm induction medium, and place them back in their respective wells of the 6-well ultra-low attachment culture plate.\nPlace the plate back in the incubator (37 ˚C), and leave it until day 4.\n\tNOTE: If the aggregates attach and grow onto or into one another, using a 1 mL pipette, gently pipette each well of aggregates up and down once per day to keep the aggregates similar in size.\n5. Day 4 - Vascular induction and priming of the aggregates\nCollect the aggregates, and allow them to settle prior to changing the medium to the vascular induction medium (step 1.4).\nSet up one 15 mL conical tube per well of the 6-well ultra-low attachment culture plate.",
    "Use a circular motion (i.e., like an orbital shaker) to gather the aggregates in the center of each well, use a 1 mL pipette to gently collect the aggregates and the surrounding medium from each well, and place them into their corresponding 15 mL conical tubes.\nOnce collected, set a timer for 30 min to allow the aggregates to sediment.\n\tNOTE: A time of 30 min is required for most cell lines at this stage. If the time is less than 30 min, there is a risk of losing any aggregates that may not have settled to the bottom of the 15 mL conical tube.\nAfter 30 min, with caution, aspirate the supernatant with a pipette or a high-sensitivity aspirating pump. Ensure the aggregates remain undisturbed at the bottom of the 15 mL conical tube.\nResuspend the aggregates of each 15 mL conical tube in 2 mL of vascular induction medium, and place them back in their respective wells of the 6-well ultra-low attachment culture plate.\nPlace the plate back in the incubator (37 ˚C), and leave it until day 6.\n\tNOTE: Using a 1 mL pipette, gently pipette each well of aggregates up and down once per day to keep the aggregates similar in size and prevent them from growing into or attaching to one another.\n6. Day 6 - Aggregate embedding and vessel sprout induction\nWhile working on ice, prepare the desired final volume of the ECM solution (step 1.5).\n\tNOTE: The following is the protocol for one well of a 12-well plate (30-50 aggregates), which can be adjusted as necessary.",
    "For one well of a 12-well plate, apply 0.5 mL of ECM as the bottom layer, and use 0.5 mL of ECM plus aggregates on the top layer. This creates the ECM \"sandwich\" necessary for effective 3D aggregate sprouting.\nPipette 500 µL of ECM into one well of a 12-well plate. Ensure that no bubbles are formed and the well bottom and side meniscus are completely coated. This comprises layer 1 of the ECM sandwich.\nPlace the plate back at 37 ˚C for 2 h.\n\tNOTE: A time of 2 h is necessary for effective polymerization. Any shorter time risks compromising the ECM integrity.\nToward the end of layer 1 polymerization, use a circular motion to gather the aggregates in the center of each well, use a 1 mL pipette to gently collect the aggregates and surrounding medium from each well, and place them into their corresponding 15 mL conical tubes.\nAllow the aggregates to settle for 10-15 min, and aspirate the supernatant.\nPlace the aggregates in the 15 mL conical tube on ice for 5 min. While cooling, take the 12-well plate with the now polymerized layer 1 out of the incubator.\n\tNOTE: Cooling the aggregates helps prevent early polymerization of the layer 2 ECM.\nWorking swiftly and carefully to prevent bubble formation, resuspend the aggregates in 500 µL of ECM, and pipette the ECM-aggregate suspension atop the already polymerized layer 1. Being cautious not to touch layer 1, use a 200 µL pipette tip to gently distribute layer 2 and the aggregates around the well.\nPlace the plate back at 37 ˚C for 2 h.\n\tNOTE: An incubation time of 2 h is necessary for effective ECM polymerization. Any shorter time risks compromising the ECM integrity and may prevent strong adhesion between layer 1 and layer 2.",
    "Add 1 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) sprouting medium (step 1.6) to induce blood vessel differentiation. Sprouting vessels must appear 1 day to 3 days post embedding. Change the medium after 3 days and then every other day.\n\tNOTE: The sprouting medium must be pre-warmed; otherwise, layer detachment may occur, and the ECM integrity may be impacted.\n7. Day 11 - Isolation and maturation of the BVOs\nWorking under sterile conditions, use the rounded end of a sterile spatula to loosen the ECM sprouting matrix containing the vascular networks. At this stage, the gel must resemble a free-floating disk.\n\t\nUsing sterile forceps and the rounded end of a sterile spatula, carefully transfer the gel disk (including the vascular networks) to the lid of a 10 cm culture dish.\nPlace the lid plus gel under a stereomicroscope adjusted to the desired magnification and focus, and use sterile needles to cut out single blood vessel networks, trying to limit the amount of non-vascularized ECM obtained in the process.\n\tNOTE: The cells naturally degrade the surrounding ECM over time; however, reducing the amount cut out with each organoid increases the image quality and the freestanding vessel network integrity.\nOnce all the organoids have been isolated from the gel, gently transfer them back into one well of an ultra-low attachment 6-well plate with 3 mL of sprouting medium . At this stage, the organoids can be left overnight, or one may immediately continue to step 7.4.\nUse a 1 mL pipette to transfer single organoids from the 6-well plate to the wells of an ultra-low attachment 96-well plate. Once transferred, add 200 µL of pre-warmed (37 °C) sprouting medium to each well of the 96-well plate.\n\tNOTE: One well of vascular organoids from a 12-well plate must fill 30-40 wells of a 96-well plate.",
    "At 4-6 days post isolation in the 96-well plates, ensure that the organoids possess a round and healthy morphology. At this stage, the organoids are ready to be fixed and prepared for staining.\n8. Day 15 - Fixation, blocking, and staining of the BVOs\nUsing a cut 1 mL tip, transfer the organoids into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nBeing careful to avoid the aspiration of any BVOs, use a 200 µL or 1,000 µL pipette to remove the remaining sprouting medium in the microcentrifuge tube, and then add 1 mL of 4% PFA in PBS for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Fixation on an orbital shaker (125 rpm) at room temperature is recommended. A maximum of 60 BVOs/microcentrifuge tube is acceptable. Any more BVOs will impair the fixation and wash efficacy.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is a harmful chemical. Use it with caution in a fume hood, and follow the manufacturer's directions for use and appropriate disposal methods.\nWash the newly fixed BVOs 3x for 15 min each time with 0.25% PBS-Tween.\nIf the organoids are larger than 1 mm in diameter, permeabilize the BVOs with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30-60 min at room temperature.\nAspirate all the 0.25% PBS-Tween, and add 1 mL of blocking buffer (step 1.7).\n\tNOTE: Although antibody-dependant, 2 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker (125 rpm) is sufficient to reduce non-specific antibody binding during the staining process. The organoids can be left in the blocking buffer at 4 ˚C for up to 2 weeks.\nRemove the blocking buffer, and add the primary antibody (1:100) diluted in 1 mL of the blocking buffer. Keep overnight at 4 ˚C on an orbital shaker (12 rpm), ensuring the organoid(s) remain submerged in the primary antibody solution.",
    "NOTE: Overnight primary antibody incubation is suitable for the antibodies used for this study. The necessary primary and secondary antibodies and their respective dilutions are provided in the Table of Materials.\nFollowing overnight primary antibody incubation, remove the primary antibody solution and wash 3x for 15 min each time with 0.25% PBS-Tween.\nAdd the secondary antibody (1:250) plus DAPI (1:1,000) diluted in 1 mL of blocking buffer, and incubate for 2 h at room temperature or at 4 ˚C overnight.\n\tNOTE: If the samples are prepared correctly (as described above), incubation for 2 h at room temperature or at 4 ˚C overnight is suitable for the antibodies used in the present study.\nFollowing incubation, remove the secondary antibody solution, and wash 3x for 15 min each time with 0.25% PBS-Tween.\n\t​NOTE: Following the staining, the organoids can be kept in PBS for up to 2 weeks.\n9. Mounting of the blood vessel organoids (BVOs)\nGlue mounting spacers onto the desired imaging coverslips (see Table of Materials).\nUsing a cut 1 mm pipette tip, use a 1 mL pipette to transfer single organoids into the spacer wells, and aspirate the remaining PBS.\nFill the well with 150-200 µL of clearing solution (see Table of Materials) heated to 75 ˚C, fully submerging the organoid.\n\tNOTE: The samples should become clear within 1 h of exposure to the warmed clearing solution.\n\t\nLeave the organoids to become clear in a covered box in the dark at room temperature for 6 h to overnight if the 1 h clearing time is insufficient. If leaving the sample overnight, ensure it has enough clearing solution to avoid drying out.",
    "After clearing, carefully aspirate the clearing solution with a 100-200 µL pipette tip. Gently maneuver the organoid to the center of the spacer well, and add drops of mounting gel (see Table of Materials) (warmed to 75 ˚C in a controlled heating block) until the well is full.\nGently place the second coverslip on top of the mounting spacer to seal the samples in the space between the bottom and top coverslips. Let the mounting gel cure in the dark at 4 ˚C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Following the curing, topcoat nail polish can be used to further seal the mounted samples."
