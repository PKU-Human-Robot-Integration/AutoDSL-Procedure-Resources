    "All procedures involving mice were conducted in accordance with licensed permission from UK Home Office (P526C60B3). Information about commercial reagents and equipment are listed in the Table of Materials.\n1. Preparation of target cells that express red fluorescent protein in their nuclei\nObtain a target mouse cancer cell line from an appropriate source.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, a highly metastatic derivative of E0771 mouse mammary tumor cells (E0771-LG)13 are used. Parental E0771 cells originate from C57BL/6 mice14.\nThaw and maintain a vial of E0771-LG cells with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) including 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: It should be confirmed that cells are negative for mycoplasma. To this end, culture E0771 cells (or cells to be tested) for 2-3 days as described above (in the absence of antibiotics and antimycotics), collect 500 μL of culture medium. Centrifuge the medium at 12,419 x g for 60 s to eliminate cell debris and transfer supernatant into new tubes. Determine mycoplasma contamination using a commercially available mycoplasma test kit (refer to Table of Materials) and/or PCR15 following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nSeed 5 x 103 E0771-LG cells per well into a 12-well plate, and culture the cells with 10% (v/v) FBS-DMEM overnight in an incubator at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: If the proliferation rate of target cells is low (population doubling time greater than 36 h), the number of cells can be increased to 1 x 104.\nReplace the medium with 1 mL of 10% (v/v) FBS-DMEM including 10 μg/mL polybrene and add 25 μL of lentiviral particles (1 x 106 TU/mL) encoding a nuclear restricted red fluorescent protein (mKate2, refer to Table of Materials).",
    "Culture the cells for 24 h in an incubator at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2.\nReplace the medium with 10% (v/v) FBS-DMEM and culture the cells for 24-48 h in an incubator at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2.\nReplace the medium with 10% (v/v) FBS-DMEM including 1 μg/mL puromycin when cells start to express red fluorescent protein, and culture the cells until they are 80-90% confluent.\n\tNOTE: Concentration of puromycin will be different between target cell types and should be optimized using un-transfected cells.\nSubculture the surviving cells for 1-3 passages with 10% (v/v) FBS-DMEM including 1 μg/mL puromycin, and cryopreserve stocks in a liquid nitrogen vapor phase storage system until use.\n2. Isolation of suppressor cells from the tumors in mice\nNOTE: In this protocol, suppressor cells (i.e., MAMs and M-MDSCs) are isolated from the lung containing metastatic tumors established by E0771-LG cells. Conditions for tissue dissociation and cell sorting should be optimized to isolate the cells from different tissues.\nInject 1 x 106 cancer cells (E0771-LG) into the tail vein of syngeneic (C57BL/6), female, 7-10 week old mice.\nAfter 14 days, isolate the lung containing metastatic tumors and prepare single-cell suspensions from the perfused lungs via enzymatic digestion as previously described11.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, four mice are injected with cancer cells and their metastatic lungs are combined to obtain sufficient suppressor cells.\nIncubate the single cell suspensions with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody for 30 min on ice, and stain with fluorescent antibodies to CD45, F4/80, CD11b, Ly6C, and Ly6G (refer to Table of Materials) for another 30 min10,11,13.\nWash the stained cells once with 1 mL of PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), and re-suspend the cell pellet with 500–1000 μL of PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA.",
    "Add 3 μM of DAPI, and sort M-MDSCs (DAPI–CD45+F4/80+Ly6G–CD11bhighLy6Chigh) and MAMs (DAPI–CD45+F4/80+Ly6G–CD11bhighLy6Clow) using a cell sorter (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The threshold of Ly6C level to distinguish MAMs (Ly6Clow) and M-MDSCs (Ly6Chigh) is based on that of resident alveolar macrophages (RMAC). The purity of the sorted cells is measured via flow cytometry with an expected purity of more than 90%.\nResuspend the sorted cells with 400 μL of DMEM containing 20% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 nM 2-mercaptoethanol (called enriched-DMEM, E-DMEM).\nCount the number of live cells using the Trypan blue exclusion method16 and adjust to 2 x 106 cells/mL with E-DMEM.\nKeep the cells on ice until use.\n3. Isolation of CD8+ T cells from the spleen of mice\nIsolate the spleen from a mouse that is syngeneic to the target cancer cell line (i.e., C57BL/6 mice in this protocol) as follows:\n\t\nEuthanize the animal by CO2 inhalation.\nPlace the animal on a clean dissection board and wipe the skin with 70% (v/v) ethanol.\nCut the abdominal skin using scissors to expose the spleen\nIsolate the spleen, which is located inferior to the stomach, and place it into a tube containing 5 mL of ice-cold PBS.\nUsing the inner plunger of a sterile 5 mL syringe, grind the spleen on a 100 μm cell strainer set on a 50 mL tube.\nPass the cells through the filter using total 10 mL of PBS.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 337 x g for 5 min, and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% (w/v) BSA (running buffer) and filter through a 40 μm cell strainer.",
    "Count the live cell number and adjust to 1 x 108 cells/mL using the running buffer.\n\tNOTE: Keep a small aliquot of cells as a pre-enrichment sample for a purity check.\nEnrich for CD8+ T cells using a negative selection kit and a magnetic sorter (refer to Table of Materials).\n\t\nTransfer 1 x 108 (1 mL) of the splenocytes cells to a 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tube.\nAdd 50 μL of biotinylated antibodies, and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nAdd 125 μL of streptavidin conjugated magnetic beads, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 1.325 mL of running buffer, and gently mix by pipetting.\nPlace the tube into the magnet, and incubate at room temperature for 2.5 min.\nPick up the magnet, and pour the enriched cell suspension into a new tube.\nResuspend the enriched cells with 200 μL of E-DMEM (i.e., DMEM containing 20% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 nM 2-mercaptoethanol).\nCount the number of live cells and adjust to 2 x 106 cells/mL with E-DMEM. Keep the cells at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator until use.\n\tNOTE: Keep a small aliquot of cells as a post-enrichment sample for a purity check.\nDetermine the purity of CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry as follows:\n\t\nTake 1 x 104 cells from pre-enrichment (step 3.6) or post-enrichment (step 3.9) samples and adjust total volume of each to 100 μL using running buffer.\nIncubate the single cell suspensions with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody for 30 min on ice, and stain with fluorescent antibodies to CD45, CD3, CD4, and CD8 (refer to Table of Materials) for another 30 min.",
    "Wash the stained cells with 500 μL of PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA, and re-suspend the cell pellet with 500–1000 μL of PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA.\nAdd 3 μM of DAPI, and determine the percentage of CD3+CD4–CD8+ cells in the total CD45+ cell population.\n4. Activation and expansion of the isolated CD8+ T cells\nAliquot 1 x 105 cells per 50 μL CD8+ T cells (prepared in step 3.9) into wells of a U-bottom 96-well plate.\nAdd 1 x 105 cells per 50 μL suppressor cells (prepared in step 2.7) or 50 μL of E-DMEM into the wells.\nPrepare activation medium that consists of E-DMEM, 4 x 104 U/mL colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), 240 U/mL interleukin-2 (IL-2), 8 μg/mL anti-mouse CD3ε antibody, and 16 μg/mL anti-mouse CD28 antibody.\n\tNOTE: CSF-1 is not required for T cell activation, but is essential for survival of suppressor cells in this protocol (i.e., MAMs and M-MDSCs). Thus, it is retained in the co-culture of T cells with target cancer cells to maintain consistency in culture conditions. Since CSF-1 is found in nano-molar concentrations in all tissues and is required for monocyte/macrophage viability in vivo, this is a physiological context for these cells.\nAdd 50 μL of activation medium (step 4.3) and 50 μL of E-DMEM with or without reagents to be tested.\nPlace the plate into an incubator at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2 and culture the cells for 4 days.\n5. Setup of co-culture of target cells with pre-activated CD8+ T cells\nAdd 30 μL of 1:100 diluted growth factor-reduced soluble basement membrane matrix (Table of Materials) into the wells of flat bottom 96-well plate suitable for microscopy, and incubate at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for at least 1 h.",
    "Prepare target cells (i.e., E0771-LG cells expressing nuclear-restricted red fluorescent protein).\n\t\nIncubate the target cells with 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin/EDTA at room temperature for 1 min, and harvest the cells by gentle pipetting.\nAdd 9 mL of DMEM including 10% (v/v) FBS, and centrifuge the cell suspension at 337 x g for 5 min.\nRe-suspend the cells with 500 μL of E-DMEM, and count the number of live cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Before counting the target cells, filter the cells through a 40μm cell strainer to produce single cell suspension.\nAdjust the density to 2 x 104 cells/mL (= 1 x 103 cells per 50 μL) by adding E-DMEM, and keep the cells on ice.\nPrepare effector cells (i.e., pre-activated CD8+ T cells).\n\t\nResuspend the cells in a well of 96-well plate (step 4.5) thoroughly by pipetting, and transfer the floating CD8+ T cells into a new 1.5 mL tube.\n\t\tNOTE: MAMs and M-MDSCs tightly adhere to the well and are not detached by the pipetting.\nTo collect remaining cells, add 200 μL of PBS into the well and transfer into the tube in step 5.3.1.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of E-DMEM once (centrifuge at 337 x g) for 5 min, aspirate and discard supernatant), and resuspend them with 100 μL of E-DMEM.\nCount the number of live cells (using the trypan blue exclusion method), adjust the density to 1.6 x 105 cells/mL (= 4 x 103 cells/25 μL), and keep the cells on ice.\nAspirate the basement membrane matrix from each well of the plate in step 5.1.\nAdd 1 x 103 cells/50 μL of target cells (step 5.2.4) into each well and mix well.",
    "NOTE: To avoid edge effects due to evaporation of medium, only the inner 60 wells of the 96 well plate should be used for analysis.\nAdd 25 μL of E-DMEM including 4 x 103 U/mL IL-2 and 10 μM fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate (refer to Table of Materials).\nAdd 4 x 103 cells/25 μL of CD8+ T cells (step 5.3.4) into appropriate wells and mix well.\n\tNOTE: The presence of too many cells in a well makes the analysis more difficult. In this model, a 4:1 effector: target ratio (total cell number 5 x 103 cells/well) was optimal, but an 8:1 ratio was suboptimal. Wells containing the following four controls are necessary to aid with data analysis: target cells at the density used for the co-culture wells (1 x 103 cells/well) in medium with and without caspase-3 substrate, effector cells (1 x 103 cells/well) in medium with and without caspase-3 substrate.\nAdd 200 μL of PBS or sterile water into all empty wells (particularly wells on the periphery of the plate) to reduce evaporation of medium from experimental wells.\nSet the plate into a time-lapse fluorescence microscope that is maintained at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Shake the plate in a cross-pattern to distribute all cells evenly, and then allow the plate to remain at room temperature on a flat surface for 10-20 min before transferring to the incubator.\n6. Imaging of the cells\nNOTE: Detailed image acquisition settings will vary with the microscope and fluorophores used; the following general acquisition parameters should be employed for optimal results.\nUsing an appropriate autofocus routine on the microscope, acquire images covering at least 25% of the total surface area in each experimental well of the 96-well plate.",
    "Set the microscope to acquire images in phase contrast as well as a fluorescent channel suitable for the nuclear-restricted red fluorescent protein (mKate2) and a fluorescent channel suitable for the green fluorogenic activated caspase-3 substrate (with excitation at 488 nm) (Figure 2).\nCapture images in experimental wells in phase contrast and the 2 fluorescent channels every 1 to 3 h for at least 72 h.\n7. Image analysis using image analysis software\nNOTE: Detailed image analysis settings will vary with the software used (refer to Table of Materials); the following general analysis procedures should be employed for optimal results.\nDetermine whether spectral un-mixing is required to separate the fluorescent signal emitted by target cell nuclei from that emitted by apoptotic nuclei and if required, set up an analysis protocol to accomplish this;\n\t\nView a control well containing only target cells (mkate2-labeled) in medium without caspase-3 substrate in the green fluorescent channel.\nObserve whether green fluorescence is being emitted by the red nuclei (nuclei appear green)\nIf green fluorescence is apparent in the nuclei, access the spectral unmixing control in the imaging software and increase the percentage of red removed from green until the green signal disappears (in our experience, this is usually 6-7% for bright mKate2 fluorescence).\nIf green fluorescence is not apparent in any nuclei, no spectral unmixing is necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: This spectral unmixing correction test can also be carried out using a well of target cells in medium containing caspase-3 substrate. However, there is usually a very low level of spontaneous apoptosis in target cells (less than 10%), resulting in a few target cell nuclei emitting green fluorescence due to activation of caspase-3 rather than fluorescence bleed through. True fluorescence bleed through is evident under these conditions when green fluorescence is apparent in all nuclei.",
    "View a control well containing only effector cells (nuclei unlabeled) in medium without caspase-3 substrate in the red and green channel individually.\nObserve whether either green or red fluorescence is being emitted by the nuclei. If neither red nor green fluorescence is apparent in the individual channels no spectral unmixing is necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: In our experience, the mouse CD8+ T cells are not auto-fluorescent and thus no spectral unmixing is necessary for these cells. This spectral unmixing correction test can also be carried out using a well of effector cells in medium containing caspase-3 substrate. However, there is usually some level of spontaneous apoptosis resulting in effector cell nuclei emitting green fluorescence due to activation of caspase-3. True fluorescence bleed through is evident under these conditions when green fluorescence is apparent in all nuclei.\nUse a fluorescence background subtraction method (e.g., TopHat), with relevant parameters for the sample, to resolve the fluorescent objects in both fluorescent channels.\n\tNOTE: In the green channel we used TopHat (nuclei radius = 10.0 µm, green fluorescence threshold = 0.7 green calibration units). In the red channel we used TopHat (nuclei radius = 10.0 µm, red fluorescence threshold = 0.5 red calibration units).\nUse appropriate parameters for edge-splitting to resolve individual fluorescent nuclei.\n\tNOTE: We did not use edge splitting in the green or red fluorescence channel.\nUse images in the red channel from the wells containing only target cells (with caspase substrate) to determine the minimum size of target nuclei.\n\tNOTE: We used 80 µm2.\nUse images in the green channel from the wells containing only effector cells (with caspase substrate) to determine the average size of apoptotic effector nuclei.\n\tNOTE: Single apoptotic effector nuclei ranged from 40 – 80 µm2 in these experiments.",
    "Set up an analysis procedure to count the number of fluorescent target cell nuclei using an appropriate minimum size restriction (e.g., minimum area, minimum diameter) (Figure 2, target detection mask).\n\tNOTE: We used a minimum nuclei area (red fluorescence) = 80 µm2.\nSet up an analysis procedure to count the number of apoptotic nuclei which are larger than the mean size of apoptotic effector nuclei (Figure 2, size restricted apoptosis mask).\n\tNOTE: Size filter was set to 80 µm2 (i.e., only areas of green fluorescence larger than this size were counted, thus excluding single apoptotic effector nuclei). Using these parameters increases the accuracy of the analysis in counting apoptotic target cell nuclei although some aggregates of apoptotic effector cells may be counted.\nSet up an analysis procedure to count the number of apoptotic target cells by counting nuclei where red fluorescent signal (from step 7.6) and size-restricted green fluorescent signal (from step 7.7) significantly co-localize (Figure 2, R/G overlap mask).\n\tNOTE: An appropriate co-localization may range from 30% to 100% of the mean size of target nuclei. Overlap size filter was set to 40 µm2.\nDetermine the number of apoptotic target cell nuclei as well as the number of target cell nuclei in the wells for each experimental condition over the entire time course.\n8. Data analysis using calculation and graphing software\nGraph the number of apoptotic target cell nuclei obtained in step 7.9 over the entire time course for the experimental wells. If multiple wells were used for each experimental condition, graphically present the results as mean ± standard deviation.\nCalculate the apoptotic fraction of the population of target cells by dividing the number of apoptotic cells in each well by the number of target cells in each well at each time point.",
    "Graph the results obtained in step 8.2.\nDetermine the area under the curve (AUC) for each curve. The peak apoptotic fraction of the population for each curve may also be determined as well as the time point at which the peak occurs, if desired. Determine whether the AUC determined for the experimental conditions are significantly different using appropriate statistical tests.\n\tNOTE: The unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction was applied to the AUC results."
