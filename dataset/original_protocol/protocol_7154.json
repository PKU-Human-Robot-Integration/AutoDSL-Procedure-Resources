    "Prepare hermaphrodite worms to use for stainingMaintain the growth of strains needed for ORO fat staining and/or NR fat staining on NGM plates seeded with OP50. Allow populations to be unstarved for over three generations to avoid changes due to epigenetics.Ramp up worm strains that will be used for fat staining (NR and/or ORO).Note: Ramping up worms requires at least 4–6 cm plates of adult worms (around 400 worms). Synchronize populations by alkaline hypochlorite treatment.Prepare the bleach solution (6 mL/strain is needed).For 6 mL of bleach solution, add 4.5 mL of autoclaved H2O, 360 μL of 50% NaOH, and 1.2 mL of bleach.Wash adult worms off plates into 15 mL conical tubes with M9. Fill the tubes to 15 mL.Spin down at 630 × g for 30 s.Aspirate supernatant down to 3 mL, making sure not to disturb the pellet of worms.Add 3 mL of bleach solution and shake vigorously for 1 min and 30 s. (A 15 mL tube will have 3 mL of bleach solution and 3 mL of M9 with worms, for a total volume of 6 mL.)After shaking, add 9 mL of M9 and shake before spinning down at 630 × g for 30 s.Aspirate supernatant down to the pellet. Add M9 to the top of the tube, shake, and centrifuge at 630 × g for 30 s.Aspirate supernatant down to 3 mL, making sure not to disturb the pellet.Add 3 mL of bleach solution and shake vigorously for 45 s or until the corpses are dissolved.Note: This step should not exceed 1 min and 20 s, to avoid over-bleaching samples. After shaking, add 9 mL of M9 and shake before spinning down at 630 × g for 30 s.Aspirate supernatant down to 1 mL.",
    "Add 14 mL of M9 and spin down at 630 × g for 30 s. Repeat this wash step two to three more times.After the last wash step, aspirate down to 1 mL. Add 7 mL of M9 and rotate samples overnight in an incubator.Note: It is important to leave space in the tube for air, otherwise the samples will not hatch overnight. The ideal overnight incubation is 12–16 h. Drop larval stage 1 worms onto freshly seeded 6 cm NGM plates. Aim for 100 worms per plate.L4-larvae can be stained 48 h after dropping worms and day 3-adults can be stained 120 h after dropping worms (unless strains are developmentally delayed).Note: Staining can also be conducted on day 1-adults (72 h after dropping the worms) and/or day 2-adults (96 h after dropping the worms). If imaging adults, transfer worms to a fresh plate every day until the day of staining.Note: If staining worms older than day 3 of adulthood, move worms to a fresh plate every day until they have ceased reproduction. ORO fat stainingPrepare 60% ORO staining solution.Make up the staining solution: Dilute ORO stock solution in autoclaved water (600 μL of ORO stock solution per 400 μL of water). Depending on the volume, prepare in either a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube or a 15 mL centrifuge tube.Note: 600 μL is used per sample. Make more than necessary to account for volume lost during filtration (Step B.1.d.). Wrap the top of the tube with parafilm.Place ORO staining solution on a tube rotator overnight.Note: Although preparing the stain overnight is preferred, stain can be prepared up to two hours before being used in this protocol. The next day, filter the ORO staining solution using a 10 mL plastic syringe attached to a 0.",
    "2 μm syringe filter into a new centrifuge tube.Optional: Co-staining samples with DAPI will aid in the identification of tissues (germline versus intestine) because of nuclear size and density differences. Dilute 1 mg/mL DAPI stock solution to 10 μg/mL in the ORO staining solution (10 μL of DAPI per 1 mL of ORO staining solution).Stain C. elegans with ORO staining solution.Wash off synchronized worm populations from 6 cm Petri dishes with NGM seeded with E. coli OP50-1 with PBS + 0.01% Triton X-100 (PBST) into a 1.5 mL tube. For each strain, you will need ~100 worms.Centrifuge for 1 min at 25 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 mL (use marks on the tube as a guide).Wash once or twice more with PBST.Note: These washes remove E. coli from the worms to be stained. Wash until the supernatant is clear and not cloudy with bacteria. Centrifuge for 1 min at 25 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 mL.Add 600 μL of 60% isopropanol and rotate for 3 min at room temperature to fix worms.Centrifuge for 1 min at 25 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 mL.Add 600 μL of 60% ORO staining solution and incubate for 2 h while rotating at room temperature.Centrifuge for 1 min at 25 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 mL.Add 600 μL of PBST and incubate for 30 min while rotating at room temperature.Centrifuge for 1 min at 25 × g. Remove supernatant to 0.1 mL.Using a cut pipette tip (to broaden the opening), pipette 14 μL of worms in PBST onto a microscope slide. If you want to line worms up, do so with the eyelash brush before covering with a cover slip.Cover with a cover slip and seal the edges with clear nail polish. Allow to dry for 5-10 min.",

Scale bars = 50 μm.NR fat staining of embryonic animalsNote: This protocol is similar to the NR fat staining of post-embryonic animals with a few minor differences. The minor differences include fixing embryos overnight, spinning the embryos down at 10× speed, and imaging at 40–63× magnification. Synchronize populations by alkaline hypochlorite treatment. Instead of allowing animals to hatch overnight, aspirate down to 1 mL and transfer M9 buffer with embryos to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.Spin down for 1 min at 2,500 × g. Remove as much as the supernatant as possible without disrupting the pellet.",
