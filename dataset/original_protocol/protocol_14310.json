    "BALB/c mouse pups of either sex were used in accordance with the statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmologic and Vision Research, and the protocols were approved by Stockholm's Committee for Ethical Animal Research. Mice were housed in litters, together with the nursing mother, with a 12 h day/night cycle, free access to food and water, and monitored daily.\nNOTE: For the surgical procedure, mice were kept under anesthesia with volatile isoflurane. Ocular ointments are discouraged during ocular procedures, as they might interfere with treatments and substances used. If necessary, to prevent dry-eye, a drop of sterile normal saline solution can be applied.Though uveal punctures are self-healing , care was taken during uveal punctures to ensure sterility with surgical instruments. Post-surgical treatment included hydration with normal saline solution subcutaneously, and analgesia with ocular topical administration of tetracaine hydrochloride. The pups were allowed to recover to sternal recumbency on a heating pad before being returned to the nursing mother, in a clean cage. Litters were kept with the same nursing mother to avoid stress.\n1. Anesthesia\nPrepare the anesthesia induction chamber, to administer isoflurane anesthetic and ensure that a small mouse mask is also coupled.\n\tNOTE: Perform all animal experiments in agreement with all applicable ethical permits.\nPrefill the induction chamber with 3-4% volatile isoflurane in atmospheric air.\n\tNOTE: Different anesthetic substances other than isoflurane may be used, according to ethical permits. Volatile anesthetic procedures should be carried on a ventilated bench or fume hood.\nPlace a postnatal (P)12.5-day-old BALB/c mouse pup in the induction chamber. Confirm that the anesthesia apparatus is ready to deliver isoflurane to the induction chamber.\n\tNOTE: Mouse pups are fragile and best handled by the scruff. Keep the pups together as a litter or with the nursing mother to avoid stress.",
    "Allow the pup to be fully anesthetized.\nGently, pick up the mouse pup by the scruff.\n\tNOTE: Keep the induction chamber closed at all times for safe and stable induction.\nTransfer the mouse to the rodent mask. Make sure to switch the anesthetic flow from the induction chamber to the mask when moving the mouse.\nPerform a toe pinch to confirm anesthesia.\n2. Puncture Procedure under Surgical Stereoscope\nPosition the mouse in lateral recumbency position. Confirm the mask is well positioned so the mouse eye is in the field of view of the stereoscope.\nGently rotate the mouse head so the eye is facing up toward the stereoscope.\n\tNOTE: Clear focus of the eye should be achieved under the stereoscope. For positioning, a magnification of 16X is recommended, while 40X should be used to perform the surgical procedure. If ethical permits allow it, trimming the tip of the whiskers can facilitate the visualization of the eye.\nUsing small tying forceps, carefully protrude the pup's eye by applying downward pressure to the eyelids dorsal and ventral to the eye.\nKeep a gentle but firm hold of the pup's eye lid, with small forceps.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to perform the eye protrusion and lid holding with the non-dominant hand, as the dominant hand should perform the puncture procedure.\nUse the stereoscope to locate the corneal limbus. Albino BALB/c limbus can be easily identified by the circular vascular plexus posterior to the cornea.",
    "With a 0.25 mm diameter (30 G) beveled needle, perform a small uveal puncture, near the posterior limbal limit of the uvea. Use only the tip of the needle, and no more than half the bevel (equivalent to 0.5 mm), puncture the uvea. If executed correctly, the uveal punctures are self-sealing, yet intraocular injection of study substances can be administered through the same puncture wound.\n\tNOTE: If experienced with mouse ocular anatomy, the uveal puncture is executed between the ciliary body and ora serrata. Care must be taken while performing the uveal puncture to avoid rupturing the lens.\nPerform the second uveal puncture in the opposite site of the eye from the first puncture site. Optimize the distance and position of the punctures; consider 12 and 6 o'clock punctures, with 12 o'clock being as dorsal as possible.\nRepeat the uveal punctures procedure every four days until P24.5. Before every successive uveal puncture, monitor animal status paying particular attention to presence of traumatic cataract due to lens damage during the uveal puncture, or obvious diminished ocular pressure. Aim for executing repeat punctures at the same positions as previous punctures for optimal effects.\n3. Noninvasive in Vivo Monitoring\nPrior to the puncture or injections on each experimental day, anesthetize the mouse as performed above.\nWith the mouse in lateral recumbency position, gently protrude the eye.\nFocus on iris vasculature with the surgical stereoscope.\nTake a picture of the iris vasculature with a camera fitted to the surgical stereoscope.\n\tNOTE: Though not necessary, inducing meiosis can be helpful to normalize iris area per animal. Consider ethical permits when selecting a meiosis-inducing agent. Careful focus of the iris vasculature will facilitate further quantitative analysis. A magnitude of 40X is recommended.\n4. Post-Operative Care",
    "Remove the BALB/c pup from the rodent mask, and gently transfer it to a heating pad layered with a surgical mat.\nApply one drop of 1% tetracaine solution to punctured eyes.\n\tNOTE: Other analgesic solutions can be used, according to ethical permits.\nHydrate the animal with a subcutaneous injection of 200 µL of sterile normal saline solution.\nReturn the pup to the nursing mother in a clean mouse cage.\nMonitor the recovery process. The pup should be able to deambulate and return to the litter.\n5. Eye Enucleation\nEuthanize the animal by cervical dislocation. Perform enucleation and dissection under a stereoscope for better visualization of the procedure.\n\tNOTE: Different euthanasia procedures can be used. It is recommended to strictly adhere to ethical permits.\nPull apart the eyelids to improve the exposure to the eye.\nMake a small cut (approximately 0.5 cm) near the canthus of the eye lids with curved Bonn eye scissors.\nUse the exposed periocular space to insert micro tying forceps behind (under) the globe in the orbit.\nGrab the tissue surrounding the eye and gently pull upwards. Avoid holding onto the eyeball, use the surrounding tissues closer to the eye socket.\nInsert the curved Bonn eye scissors behind the eye globe in the orbit.\nCut through the surrounding tissues until the eye is released from the socket.\n\tNOTE: This dissection technique maintains eye anatomy and benefits subsequent analysis.\nProceed to the removal of extraneous tissue from the eye. The removal of extraneous tissue can be performed after fixing, if preferred.\n\tNOTE: BALB/c mice are melanin deficient, therefore, to increase contrast, a dark background is recommended to facilitate dissection procedure.\nBriefly rinse the whole-eye in a Petri dish filled with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).",
    "Transfer the eye to a 2 mL tube containing 1.5 mL of 4% buffered-formalin solution.\nFix the eye for 6 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Fixing confers the rigidity of the tissue and facilitates dissection of the iris. Fixing time should be tested and adjusted for different applications.\n6. Iris Dissection Procedure under Stereoscope\nRemove the fixative solution from the tube with a 1.5 mL plastic Pasteur pipette (or similar), and rinse the eye three times with fresh PBS.\nPlace the fixed eye in a smooth dry surface (dissection stand) with the anterior chamber facing upwards.\nWith a beveled 30 G needle, perform an entry point posterior to the limbus.\nHolding the anterior segment with small tying forceps, insert one tip of Clayman-Vannas straight scissors into the opening previously created.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to control the forceps with the non-dominant hand, and the scissor with the dominant.\nWhile rotating the eye with the tying forceps, cut around the limbus to remove the posterior segment of the eye.\n\tNOTE: Performing partial cuts will allow the inner tip of the scissors to continue in the tissue and greatly facilitates the process.\nPosition the anterior segment facing downward, exposing the lens.\nRemove the lens carefully by grabbing it with small forceps and pulling upwards.\n\tNOTE: A beveled needle can be used to puncture and pull the lens.\nPosition the anterior segment with the cornea facing down and the cut perpendicular to the field of view.\nGently grab the tissue posterior to the ciliary body with the small tying forceps.\nWith Clayman-Vannas straight scissors, proceed to trim just anterior to the ciliary body to remove the trabecular meshwork and isolate the iris. Confirm that the trabecular meshwork is removed; the iris should move within the cornea.",
    "Carefully transfer the anterior eyecup with the small tying forceps, holding the cornea, to a 96-well plate containing 200 µL of PBS.\nContinue holding the cornea in the well and dissect the iris by flushing with PBS with a pipette.\n\tNOTE: If the iris remains adherent to the cornea, some trabecular meshwork might be present, and the bevel of a 30 G needle can be used to help displacing the iris.\nRemove the cornea from the 96-well with the small tying forceps, and keep the isolated iris in the well for further analysis.\nStore free-floating iris samples at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Despite being fixed, long-term storage of the iris free-floating samples is not recommended.\n7. Possible Experimental Read-Outs\nTo visualize the blood vessels in the dissected irises, use free-floating whole-mount immunohistochemistry staining methods for markers such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 or isolectin B4. Alternatively, use whole-body perfusion with vascular staining, such as fluorescent-labeled high molecular weight dextrans.\nUse in vivo noninvasive images to perform in silico flat-mounting and quantify full iris vasculature with appropriate imaging software.\n\tNOTE: Vasculature can be quantified, both in vivo and in vitro, using densitometry or with vasculature analysis software9.\nProcess the whole eyeball for nucleic acids and protein extraction, followed by PCR or immunoblotting methods, to perform molecular analysis of the punctured eyes.\n\tNOTE: Molecular analysis of tissues is best performed with non-fixed tissue, but dissection of non-fixed iris is extremely challenging, and the use of the whole eye has rendered statistically significant results in previous studies8.\nSubscription Required.
