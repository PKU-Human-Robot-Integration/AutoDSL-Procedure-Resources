    "1. Cloning\nDetermine the configurations to clone and choose a linker. Tag proteins with the fragments on the N- or C-terminus as described below so they do not disrupt their proper localization. Use a flexible linker such as (GGGGS)x2.\nGenetically tag the proteins of interest to the PAmCherry1 fragments. As one option, use the cloning plasmids listed in the Materials List containing the fragments RN (PAmCherry1 residues 1-159) and RC (Met plus PAmCherry1 residues 160-236) with flanking MCS sequences.\n\t\nLinearize the plasmids containing the fragments RN and RC with inverse PCR (or restriction digest) at the point of insertion. Primers for inverse PCR are listed in Table 1. Below is an example PCR protocol used in the author’s lab (see Materials List for the exact materials used in this protocol).\n\t\t\nMix the PCR reaction together, brought up to a final volume of 50 µl with water: to a thin-walled PCR tube, add the water, 25 µl of 2x master mix, 0.5 µl each of the forward and reverse primers (20 µM diluted stock, 0.2 µM final concentration), and 1 ng of template. Use the following cycling conditions: 98 °C for 30 sec, 30 cycles of 98 °C for 7 sec and 68 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.\nPCR the genes of interest for insertion to the linearized plasmids containing RN and RC fragments. Perform the PCR as in step 1.2.1 with the extension time at 68 °C. Use primers with overhangs that contain a flexible linker sequence, such as GGAGGTGGAGGTAGTGGTGGAGGTGGAAGT for (GGGGS)x2, and 15 base pair homology to the ends of the linearized RN and RC plasmids for recombination.",
    "Note: The primer overhangs for the proteins of interest are presented in Table 2 if using the primers in Table 1 to linearize the plasmid backbone.\nDigest the PCR reaction with Dpn1 to eliminate the PCR template. Add 0.5 µl of Dpn1 (20 U/µl) directly to the 50 µl of PCR reaction. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 hr and heat inactivate at 80 °C for 20 min. If background template persists in later steps, increase the enzyme amount or lengthen the digestion time.\nPurify the PCR products via a spin column as described by the manufacturer.\nPerform a ligation-independent reaction to combine a linearized plasmid containing an RN or RC fragment with the gene of interest. Measure the concentration of the purified PCR products: combine 50 ng of linearized plasmid and 50 ng of the gene of interest with 1 µl of enzyme premix and bring the total volume to 5 µl with deionized water. Incubate at 50 °C for 15 min, place on ice, and add 20 µl of TE buffer.\nTransform recombinant plasmids into competent bacteria18.\nSelect 2-4+ (as desired) colonies for O/N culture. Add 5 ml of LB broth and 5 µl of kanamycin (50 mg/ml stock) into a 14 ml polypropylene round-bottom tube, and add the selected bacteria colony with a sterilized inoculating loop. Incubate at 37 °C O/N while shaking at 225 rpm.\nFreeze 1 ml of O/N culture for glycerol stock19 and miniprep the remainder as described by the manufacturer.",
    "Perform sequencing to determine a good clone. If using the cloning plasmids in the Materials List, use M13 forward and reverse primers (in separate reactions) as necessary to obtain the complete sequence of the fusion construct. Compare with the expected sequence using an alignment tool such as BLAST from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) - http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BlastAlign.cgi[href=http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BlastAlign.cgi].\nTransfer the sequence-verified constructs to an expression plasmid via a recombinase reaction.\n\t\t\nAdd 75 ng of the destination plasmid — such as pcDNA for transient transfections or pLenti for lentiviral packaging20 — and 50 ng of the recombinant cloning plasmid to 1 µl of enzyme premix and bring up the total volume to 5 µl with deionized water. Incubate at 25 °C for 1 hr, then add 5 µl of TE buffer.\n\t\t\tNote: For lentiviral packaging and stable cell line generation, use a different destination plasmid for each construct, for example, one with puromycin resistance and the other neomycin. This allows for double selection of transduced cells. Also consider the promoter for each, such as the constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter for high expression levels, or CMV with the TetO operator for tunable doxycycline-regulated expression.\nTransform 5 µl into competent bacteria and miniprep the plasmids as in steps 1.2.6 to 1.2.8, but using the appropriate antibiotic (typically ampicillin).\nDetermine the optimal BiFC configuration.\n\t\nCo-transfect expression plasmids into U2OS cells (or cell of choice).\n\t\t\nAdd 350 µl of phenol red-free and antibiotic-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS into each well of an 8-well #1.5 glass bottom chamber slide. Plate about 7.5 x 104 cells per well so cells are about 70%-90% confluent the next day.\nThe day after plating, co-transfect expression plasmids with different configurations in each well using the preferred reagent and as described by the manufacturer.",
    "For each well, add 125 ng of each expression plasmid into 50 µl of serum-free reduced media in a 0.6 ml tube and pipette up and down to mix. Add 1 µl of the transfection reagent down the center of the tube and directly into the media. Agitate gently to mix and let the reaction sit for 30 min.\nReduce the media in each well of the chamber slide by about half. Add the transfection mixture dropwise to the wells and shake gently to mix. Incubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24-48 hr. Change the media the day after transfection.\nImage cells on a fluorescence microscope as in Protocol 2 beginning with step 2.1.4.\n\t\tNote: The sample may be imaged on a standard fluorescence microscope if the expression levels are high and the camera is sensitive enough for the relatively low photon output of PAmCherry1. Reconstituted PAmCherry1 molecules can be activated with an ultra violet filter set (405 nm) prior to imaging with a green excitation (561 nm) filter set.\nWhere applicable, create a negative control by, for example, introducing a point mutation into one of the proteins of interest that disrupts the interaction. Perform a site-directed mutagenesis21 on the cloning plasmid of the protein to be mutated and of the chosen configuration.\nGenerate a stable cell line by packaging the constructs into viral particles and infect U2OS cells (or cell line of choice). Consider an inducible (tetracycline) expression system15 so expression can be induced prior to imaging if prolonged irreversibility of BiFC is an issue, or if tunable expression is desired.",
    "CAUTION: Working with viruses is classified as Biosafety Level 2. While recent generations of viral packaging systems have greatly reduced the likelihood of producing replication-competent viruses, some risks are still present. References can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/.[href=http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/]\nRepeat step 1.2.10 using a lenti- or retroviral destination vector20. Increase the O/N culture to 100 ml for a midiprep and greater purity of the plasmids.\nOn Day 1: Plate about 2 x 106 293T/17 cells into a 10 cm dish for each construct to be packaged.\nOn Day 2: Prepare a transfection reaction using a transfection reagent of choice and as described by the manufacturer.\n\t\t\nPrepare a premix of packaging plasmids with final concentrations of 250 ng/µl for packaging plasmids 1 and 2, and 100 ng/µl for packaging plasmid 3 in sterile water. Add 10 µl of the packing plasmid premix and 2.5 µg of the target plasmid to 1 ml of serum-free reduced media in a 5 ml polypropylene round-bottom tube and pipette up and down to mix. Add 20 µl of transfection reagent down the center of the tube and directly into the media.\n\t\t\t\nAgitate gently to mix and incubate at RT for 30 min. Remove about half the media from the cells and add the transfection mixture in a dropwise manner. Shake gently to mix and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Incubate 10 ml of media per plate in a tube with the cap loosened for temperature and CO2 equilibration.\nOn Day 3: Gently change the media with the pre-incubated media and return the cells to the incubator. Incubate another tube of media with the cap loosened.",
    "Note: Syncytia, or the formation of large multi-nucleated cells, can be a sign that the packaging is going well. However, cells are in a fragile state and can be easily detached. When changing media, tilt the pipettor so that it is horizontal and add the media dropwise into one edge of the plate.\nOn Day 4: Harvest the virus by removing the media with a syringe and filtering through a 0.45 µm pore size filter into a clean 50 ml tube. Gently replace the media with the pre-incubated media.\nOn Day 5: Harvest again as done previously in step 1.5.3.3 and combine common filtrate into the same 50 ml tube. Add 6 ml of virus concentrator to each tube and mix. Store at 4 °C for at least 24 hr until the virus precipitates.\n\t\t\tNote: Depending on the health of the cells, virus can be harvested a third time.\nConcentrate the virus by centrifuging at 1,500 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 250 µl of media. Virus can be used immediately for infection or stored in 50 µl aliquots at -80 °C for up to one year.\nPlate about 3 x 105 U2OS (or target) cells per well into a 6-well plate (2 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS per well) for infection, so cells are about 50% confluent at the time of infection.\nThe following day, remove about half the media so about 1 ml remains. Coinfect with 50 µl of concentrated virus for each construct. Add 1 µl of polybrene (8 mg/ml) to each well. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change media the next day and incubate for one more day before antibiotic selection.",
    "Note: The amount of virus to add can vary depending on the desired rate of infection. Viruses can be titrated using qRT-PCR.\nAdd antibiotics to select for infected cells. Separate wells with uninfected cells that have not seen virus are required as canaries to test the efficacy of the selection. Incubate for 2-7 days, or until selection is complete.\n\t\t\tNote: Effective concentrations should be titrated initially, but they are typically 1.0 µg/ml for puromycin and 1.0 mg/ml for neomycin.\nExpand the cells into a larger 10 cm dish and proceed to Protocol 2.\n2. Imaging Fixed Cells\nPrepare a sample for imaging\n\t\nClean an 8-well #1.5 glass-bottom chamber slide by adding 250 µl of 1 M NaOH for at least 1 hr and wash thoroughly with PBS.\n\t\tNote: Untreated chamber slides typically result in high background signal. Additionally, cells may be sensitive to residual NaOH and failure to thoroughly clean the glass surface (as many as 10x washes) may make cell adhesion difficult. If necessary, incubate the cleaned chamber slide with PBS O/N after washing. For sensitive cell lines, plating at a higher density (e.g., at 50%-60% initial confluency) may help.\nPlate about 5.5 x 104 of the U2OS stable expression cells per well in 350 µl of phenol red-free DMEM with 10% FBS so that cells are healthy and not over confluent when imaging.\nPerform necessary treatments for the experiment, such as adding tetracycline to induce protein expression.\nFix the cells immediately before imaging.",
    "Prior to fixation, prepare fresh paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution — 3.7% PFA in 1x PHEM with 0.1% glutaraldehyde (GA). For 10 ml PFA solution, weigh 0.37 g of PFA and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 ml of distilled water and 30 µl of 1 M NaOH and vortex. Heat at 70 °C and vortex every 1-2 min until PFA is completely dissolved.\nTransfer dissolved PFA to a 15 ml conical tube and add 3.8 ml distilled water, 5 ml 2x PHEM buffer, 20 µl of 25% glutaraldehyde, and vortex to mix. Stock, 2x PHEM buffer is 120 mM PIPES, 50 mM HEPES, 20 mM EGTA, and 16 mM MgSO4, with pH adjusted to 7.0 with 10 M KOH. This fixative solution can be stored at 4 °C for several days.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: PFA and GA are both hazardous. Prepare the solution in a fume hood and wear proper protective equipment when handling both chemicals. Avoid inhalation or direct skin contact.\nRemove the growth medium. Wash quickly with 500 µl of PBS and add 250 µl of the PFA fixative per well. Incubate the cells for 20 min at RT.\nRemove the PFA fixative from the sample and add 350 µl of PBS or imaging buffer (100 mM Tris with 30 mM NaCl and 20 mM MgCl2, pH 8.5) per well.\nVortex 100 nm gold particles to break up aggregates and add 35 µl per well (10x final dilution) for tracking stage drift during imaging.\nAcquire images\n\t\nTurn on the microscope. Power on the 405 and 561 nm lasers, but keep the shutters (internal or external) closed at this point. Turn on the EMCCD camera and allow it to cool down. Ensure the 561 nm filters are in place.",
    "Open the acquisition software and set the exposure time to 100 msec and the EMCCD gain to 300 (range 1 – 1,000).\nAdd immersion oil to the objective and secure the sample to the microscope stage.\nWith either bright field or the 561 nm laser on (~1 kW/cm2), bring the sample into focus.\nFor imaging Ras and other membrane proteins, use a 60X apochromat TIRF objective with 1.49 numerical aperture and bring the microscope into TIRF configuration. Adjust the excitation laser so that it is off-centered when hitting the back aperture of the TIRF objective; this causes the laser to deflect upon reaching the sample. Keep adjusting the laser until the critical angle is reached and the laser is being reflected back. Search for a cell to image with several gold particles in view. Set a region of interest that encloses the cell (or a region within the cell) and the gold particles.\n\t\tNote: TIRF decreases the penetration depth of the excitation laser and reduces the out of focus background signal. Additionally, drift correction is likely to be more accurate when more gold particles are in view.\nIf available, engage the autofocus system to correct for sample drift in the z-direction. Otherwise, adjust the focus manually throughout the acquisition if the image goes out of focus.\nBegin acquisition with the 405 nm laser off and the 561 nm laser on (~1 kW/cm2) in case sufficient activation is occurring already (typically if expression levels are high). Otherwise, turn on the 405 nm laser at the lowest factory power setting (0.02 mW or 0.01 W/cm2) and increase gradually (0.1 mW at a time) as necessary until there are several tens of molecules per frame or so that single molecules are well separated.",
    "As data acquisition continues, gradually increase 405 nm laser power to keep the spot density roughly constant.\n\t\tNote: At lower 405 nm excitation power, some PAmCherry1 can already be activated. As these molecules photobleach, the population of remaining photoactivatable PAmCherry1 molecules decreases, requiring a higher photon flux to maintain the same density of molecules emitting fluorescence in each frame.\nContinue image acquisition until high 405 nm power (2.5 – 10 W/cm2) does not activate more activation events.\n\t\tNote: The total acquisition time depends on the expression level and efficiency of the complementation.\nProcess the images\n\tNote: There are many open source software options for image processing. Examples are ThunderSTORM (https://code.google.com/p/thunder-storm/[href=https://code.google.com/p/thunder-storm/]) and QuickPALM (https://code.google.com/p/quickpalm/[href=https://code.google.com/p/quickpalm/]). The typical data processing procedures are briefly illustrated here using a custom Matlab package called wfiread for processing PALM data as an example. However, future revisions may not exactly follow what is described here.  For image processing with other software, please refer to the user documentations.\n\t\nDownload the image processing software (Supplemental Code File) or the latest version at http://www.ohsu.edu/nan[href=https://www.ohsu.edu/nan]. Open Matlab and load the wfiread software (which is already put in the default path).\nView the raw image sequence and determine the region of interest. Select the area of the stack to be processed by left clicking and dragging a box around the desired area. If the region of interest was not reduced during acquisition (to about 256x256 pixels), select a smaller area to lessen the compute time. To deselect an area and processes the entire frame, right click anywhere in the image.\nEnter the range of frames to be processed.",
    "Select a gold particle (one that is isolated and uniform in shape) by left clicking on the image and dragging a small box around it. Under Particle Tracking, click the Track button. A graph will appear that shows the position of the selected gold particle across the stack of images, depicting the extent of the drift.\nRepeat this process to track as many gold particles as possible and determine the ones that track together (the particles will be color coded). Ideally the overall drift is on the order of one pixel at most.\nIndividually select the gold particles that tracked together one at a time and click the Add Marker button under Particle Tracking. A green cross will appear signifying that it has been added as a marker and will be used to correct for drift.\nAdjust the Sigma Range, Smoothing Range and Threshold as necessary by changing the values slightly. Click the Find Particle button to test the settings. The particles that will be processed will be boxed and those that are not will be left out. The PAmCherry1 molecules, particles that are relatively round and bright, should be selected.\nStart processing the images by clicking the Make Coord File button and save the file.\n\t\tNote: The program will go through each frame within the defined frame range, find all fluorescent spots, and perform Gaussian fitting to find the centroid coordinates. A .cor file will be generated storing all coordinates and other fitting parameters of the processed single molecule images.\nPost-process the images and render the PALM image\n\tNote: Other software may directly render the image after coordinate extraction.\n\t\nIn Matlab, launch the ‘palm’ package and load the .cor file just created.",
    "Before rendering the PALM image using the coordinates, sort the individual coordinates (each from a ‘localization event’). The optimal sorting values may vary depending on the setup and fluorophore.\n\t\t\nFor PAmCherry1, use the following values: Combining Frame - 8; Combining Distance (nm) - 100; Minimum RMS - 4; Minimum Fit Goodness - 0.25; and Max. Eccentricity - 1.4. See the Discussion section for additional explanation of these parameters.\nClick the Sort button to generate a new set of coordinates ready for rendering high resolution images.\nEnter values for proper rendering of the final image such as the raw pixel size (nm), the desired feature size (nm) in the rendered image, and the pixel size for the rendered image.\n\t\tNote: The raw pixel size must be determined for each setup. The rendered feature size can be set arbitrarily, but is typically set at a value slightly higher than the average localization precision. For PAmCherry1, the average localization precision is around 18 nm, so a feature size of 20 – 30 nm is appropriate. Of note, the localization precision was calculated by taking the standard deviation of the localizations of the same molecule across multiple frames22 and not by dividing the diffraction limit with the square root of detected number of photons. As for the pixel size of the rendered image, 10 nm is a good starting point; setting this value too low will result in unnecessarily large image files for unmagnified views.\nClick the Render button to generate the PALM image. Use the +/- magnifying icons in the tool bar of the figure window to zoom in and out.",
    "Optional: Perform cluster analysis of the reconstructed PALM image using either Ripley’s K test or other mechanisms such as simulation-aided DBSCAN (SAD)23. Note: In the custom palm package, both Ripley’s K and SAD analysis are already built in; for coordinates generated from other software, the same analyses may be performed with additional custom scripts.\n3. Single Molecule Tracking in Live Cells\nTreat the tissue culture surface and plate the cells as described in Protocol 2. Since the temperature and/or CO2 controlled stage may require a certain culture dish, ensure sure that the coverglass has the appropriate thickness (0.17 mm) for the microscopy setup.\n\t\nTransfect cells if doing a transient expression and perform any treatments needed for the experiment, such as tetracycline to induce expression, and incubate as necessary. This is also the same as described in Protocol 2.\nPlace the culture dish on an on-stage incubator. Let the dish settle on the stage for a few minutes until the temperature and CO2 concentration stabilize every time after mounting the culture dish or moving to a new region of interest. Block lasers at this step. If CO2 control is not available, change to a CO2 independent media right before imaging, such as Leibovitz’s L-15.\n\t\tNote: Phenol-red-free medium is recommended for depressing background fluorescence.\nAcquire images as in Protocol 2. However, set an appropriate exposure time (typically 25-50 msec for PAmCherry1).",
    "Note: The molecule density must be lower than for fixed cells so that trajectories can be recorded without overlapping with each other. The specified few tens of molecules is typical for a 256x256 pixel acquisition at a pixel size of about 160 nm. The 561 nm laser power density was set to 0.8 kW/cm2 to maintain a good signal-to-noise ratio while decreasing the phototoxicity to cells and increasing the average trajectory length.\nProcess the images.\n\t\nExtract coordinates of single molecules with the wfiread package as described in Protocol 2, or with another package.\nReconstruct single particle trajectories using various single particle tracking (SPT) packages based on different algorithms found elsewhere24. Note: Alternatively, this step may be accomplished using home built Matlab package (possibly available in future revisions at http://www.ohsu.edu/nan.[href=https://www.ohsu.edu/nan]\nOptional: After reconstruction, use an SPT package24 to calculate displacement and diffusion constants from the trajectories. Additionally, use variational Bayes single-particle tracking (vbSPT)25 to determine diffusion states of the target proteins. vbSPT Matlab package and documentation can be found at its official Sourceforge site: http://vbspt.sourceforge.net/.[href=http://vbspt.sourceforge.net/]\nSubscription Required.
