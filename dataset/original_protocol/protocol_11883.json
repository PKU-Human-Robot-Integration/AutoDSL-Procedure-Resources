    "1. Preparation and collection of aged worms for cell isolation\nNOTE: Explained below is the isolation of cholinergic neurons from the transgenic unc-17::GFP strain (OH13083) obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) strain repository at the University of Minnesota. It is imperative to maintain sterile conditions to prevent contamination from fungi or bacteria.\nPrepare and synchronize worms via the bleaching method as described by T. Stiernagle16. For aging experiments, plate worms onto nematode growth medium (NGM) plates containing 25 µM water solution of fluorodeoxyuridine (FuDR) to reduce egg production and arrest egg hatching. Inspect agar plates regularly to prevent contamination or egg hatching as this will cause unreliable results.\n\tNOTE: For unc-17::GFP cells, typically three 100 mm x 15 mm NGM plates are used to isolate a sufficient amount of cells of interest16.\nCollect worms and prepare buffers for cell isolation.\n\t\nCollect worms in a 15 mL conical tube. Wash worms from plate with 1.5 mL of M9 buffer (1 mM MgSO4, 85 mM NaCl, 42 mM Na2HPO4·7H2O, 22 mM KH2PO, pH 7.0) and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,600 x g. Discard supernatant and wash worms with 1 mL of M9 buffer. Repeat centrifugation and wash for a total of five times to remove as much E. coli contamination as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: Adding antibiotics (50 µg/mL), such as ampicillin, at this step can help reduce bacterial contamination.\nFor two samples, prepare 2 mL of sodium dodecyl sulfate-dithiothreitol (SDS-DTT) lysis buffer: 200 mM DTT, 0.25% (w/v) SDS, 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), and 3% (w/v) sucrose.\nPrepare 15 mL of isolation buffer (118 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES [pH 7.3]) and store it on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Both the SDS-DTT lysis buffer and isolation buffer must be made fresh before each experiment.",
    "Cuticle disruption and single cell isolation\n\t\nCentrifuge animals collected in step 1.2.1 for 5 min at 1,600 x g. Remove all supernatant and suspend worms in 1 mL of M9 media and transfer to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPellet worms with centrifugation at 1,600 x g for 5 min.\nAdd 200 µL of SDS-DTT lysis buffer to worms and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Worms should appear to be “winkled” along the body if viewed under a light microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: Prolonged exposure to SDS-DTT lysis buffer may result in death of worms, which can be monitored by observing worms. Worms that are dead will elongate and will not curl.\nAdd 800 µL of ice-cold isolation buffer and mix by gently flicking tube.\nPellet worms for 1 min at 13,000 x g at 4 °C, remove supernatant and wash with 1 mL of isolation buffer.\nRepeat step 1.3.5 for a total of five times, carefully removing isolation buffer each time.\nAdd 100 µL of protease mixture from Streptomyces griseus (15 mg/mL) (Table of Materials) dissolved in isolation buffer to the pellet and incubate for 10−15 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: As with the SDS-DTT lysis buffer, the extended protease digestion may result in excessive cleavage of proteins along the plasma membrane, preventing isolation of surface exposed GFP via magnetic beads.\nDuring incubation with protease mixture, apply mechanical disruption by pipetting samples up and down against the bottom of the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with a 200 µL micropipette tip for ~60−70 times. Keep the pipette tip against the wall of the microcentrifuge tube with constant pressure to properly disassociate cells.",
    "To determine the stage of digestion, remove a small volume (~1−5 µL) of the digestion mixture, drop it on a glass slide and inspect it using a tissue culture microscope. After 5−7 min of incubation, worm fragments should have visibly reduced cuticle and a slurry of cells will be readily visible.\nHalt reaction with 900 μL of commercially available cold Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin (final concentration at 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin).\nPellet isolated fragments and cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C. Wash the pelleted cells with 1 mL of cold L-15-supplemented media twice more to ensure that excess debris and cuticle is removed.\nResuspend pelleted cells in 1 mL of L-15-supplemented media and leave on ice for 30 min. Take the top layer, approximately 700−800 µL, to a microcentrifuge tube. This layer contains cells without cell debris and will be used in the subsequent isolation of cells of interest.\nFollowing manufacturer’s instructions, use an automated cell counter or hemocytometer to measure the cell density of 10−25 µL of isolated cells.\n2. Isolation of GFP-positive cells via flow cytometry or anti-GFP magnetic beads\nNOTE: There are two methods that can be deployed to isolate specific cell types. The first method is to use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), while the second method uses antibody-conjugated magnetic beads to pool cells expressing distinct plasma membrane-localized proteins. The latter method requires the localization of GFP to the plasma membrane, thus being available for interaction with the antibody-coupled magnetic bead.\nIsolation of GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry",
    "From isolated cell suspension collected in step 1.3.12, centrifuge cells for 5 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C. Discard supernatant and suspend pelleted cells in L-15-supplemented medium to a cell density of no more than 6 x 106 cells/mL to avoid overloading the flow cytometer.\nSort cells by GFP-positive expression using a flow cytometer capable of sorting samples. GFP-negative cells can be used as a control for non-cell type specific analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: As mentioned above, an alternative approach to isolate GFP-positive cells may be used if the GFP-tagged protein of interest is localized to the cells’ plasma membrane. In this case, the protocol described in section 2.2 can be employed.\nIsolation of GFP-positive cells via anti-GFP magnetic beads\n\t\nFrom isolated cell suspension collected in step 1.3.12, centrifuge cells for 5 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C. Discard supernatant and suspend cells in 485 µL of L-15-supplemented medium. Add 15 µL of ddH2O pre-washed α-GFP antibody-coupled magnetic beads to the solution.\nIncubate cells with the magnetic bead slurry at 4 °C for 1 h with very gentle turning. Excessive turning will damage the cells.\nAfter incubation, centrifuge sample for 5 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C, then wash pellet 2x with 1 mL of L-15-supplemented medium to remove GFP-negative cells.\nCulturing of isolated cells\n\t\nPlate isolated cells into a sterile 6-well multi-well plate.\n\t\tNOTE: These plates may be coated with peanut lectin to increase cell attachment; however, if cells are to be used immediately, this step may be disregarded.",
    "Place the plate into a plastic container and incubate cells at 20 °C with a damp wipe or soft tissue paper (add 50 µg/mL ampicillin to ddH2O to ensure no bacterial growth on wipe) to add moisture to cells. Do not incubate in a CO2 incubator, as elevated CO2 levels may damage the cells.\n3. Fluorescent imaging of isolated GFP-positive cells\nTurn on the fluorescent bulb of an inverted microscope with fluorescence attachment and allow it to warm up for about 10 min.\nRemove cell culture from the incubator and set on stage of inverted microscope with florescence attachment. Slide the GFP filter into the grooves under the stage of the microscope.\nView the cells with a magnification of 50x. Successfully isolated GFP-positive cells will be readily visible. Take photos using the camera attachment on the microscope.\n4. Extraction of RNA from isolated cells\nNOTE: Extraction of RNA should be performed immediately after cell isolation to ensure high quality of material. Isolated RNA can be used to produce cDNA and subsequent measurement of transcript levels by quantitative PCR (qPCR). All tubes, tips, and reagents should be RNase-free, and workspace should be ethanol-washed prior to RNA extraction.\nFrom isolated cells collected at step 2.1.2, centrifuge cells in a 1.5 mL sterile, RNase-free microcentrifuge tubefor 5 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C. If cells are isolated via magnetic beads, follow cell collection as stated above.\nUsing a micropipette, remove supernatant from centrifuged microcentrifuge tube and add 100 µL of M9 medium to wash away L-15-supplemented medium. Centrifuge cells 5 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C and remove supernatant. To ensure all media are removed, repeat for a total of three washes carefully removing supernatant each time.",
    "Add 1 mL of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate solution (Table of Materials) to cells and pipette the suspension up and down carefully. Incubate the mixture at RT for 5 min.\nFollowing incubation, add 250 phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate solution\nCentrifuge the solution for 5 min at 10,000 x g at 25 °C.\nCarefully remove as much of the top aqueous layer with a micropipette as possible, without disturbing the bottom organic layers, and transfer the bottom layer to a new 1.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tube. To the new tube, add 500 µL of isopropanol and mix by inverting the tube. Incubate this solution at RT for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the tube at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 25 °C.\nWhile keeping the samples on ice, remove as much isopropanol as possible with a micropipette, and gently add 1 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol in RNase-free ddH2O to the tube. Be sure not to eject solution directly onto the bottom of the tube; apply ethanol/water mixture to the side of the tube.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 min at 25 °C.\nRemove most of the ethanol and air dry on ice for 3−5 min.\n\tNOTE: Ethanol should be removed after this step; however, careful inspection of bottom of the tube is important to ensure no ethanol is left.\nAfter the tube is air dried, add 15−20 µL of RNase-free ddH2O and measure RNA concentration and purity using a spectrophotometer at 260 nm wavelength. The purity of the sample should be measured as a 260 nm/280 nm ratio. This ratio should be approximately >2.",
    "NOTE: Isolated RNA can be frozen and stored at -20 °C. It is, however, highly preferential to use a cDNA synthesis kit as soon as possible to ensure high-quality cDNA production. Quantitative PCR can follow using instructions provided by the manufacturer of the thermocycler used in the laboratory.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
