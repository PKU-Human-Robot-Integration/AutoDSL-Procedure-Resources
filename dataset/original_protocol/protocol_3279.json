All the primers are designed with Primer Premier 5.0.\nPrepare the PCR reaction master mix, which including sequence-containing plasmids, primers, master mix with proofreading polymerase, and ddH2O.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3049_5.csv\nPerform the cloning of these sequences with cleavage sites under following PCR cycling conditions on the PCR thermal cycler, such as T100 thermal cycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3049_6.csv\nPrepare 1.5% agarose gel.\nLoad samples and DL2000 DNA marker, which encompassing 2000, 1000, 750, 500, 250, and 100 bp fragments.\nCarry out the electrophoresis at 80 V with TAE running buffer on the HE-120 horizontal electrophoresis tank until loading dye has progressed 2/3 down the gel (about 30 min).\nGently place the gel on the TGreen transilluminator or other long wave ultraviolet illuminator equivalent. Carefully pick out the related lanes with a surgical knife.\nNote: short wave ultraviolet can lead to mutations.\nCarry out the fragments recovery following the instructions of the Universal DNA Purification Kit (https://en.tiangen.com/download/manual.html?one=34&two=1084&three=1089&id=5374[href=https://en.tiangen.com/download/manual.html?one=34&two=1084&three=1089&id=5374]) or an equivalent kit.\nPause point: Recovered fragments could store at −20°C for several weeks.\nInsert these fragments into to a T-Vector pMD19 (Simple) using a DNA Ligation Kit following the user manuals (https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/6022/6022_e.v1811Da.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/6022/6022_e.v1811Da.pdf]).\nThe ligation reaction mixture is used directly for transformation of E. coli DH5α chemically competent cells.",
    "Add 100 μL competent cells to 10 μL of the ligation mixture and keep it on ice for 30 min.\nPlace the tubes at 42°C for 90 s, using a thermo cell or a water bath.\nAdd 1 mL LB culture medium and culture at 37°C, 150 rpm for 1 h on a cultivation oscillator or a shaker.\nSpread 100 μL bacteria on the LB plates containing 0.1 g/L ampicillin.\nCulture at 37°C for another hours until bacteria colonies appear and are easy to pick out.\nAlternatives: The bacteria can also spread out with glass rod on the LB agar plates containing ampicillin and X-gal for blue/white screening. White colonies are positive ones with recombinant plasmid. It will be more precise than without blue/white screening. But PCR verification could also identify the positive colonies and sequencing is necessary.\nPick out some bacteria colonies and culture with 1 mL LB culture medium on centrifuge tubes for at least 4 h.\nAfter bacteria PCR with universal primers, M13F(-47)/RV-M, sequencing in a biotech company and all the sequences are compared with DNAMAN software.\nCulture the corrected colonies for plasmid extraction following the instruction of the TIANprep Mini Plasmid Kit (https://en.tiangen.com/upload/file/20220509/20220509164548_88950.pdf[href=https://en.tiangen.com/upload/file/20220509/20220509164548_88950.pdf]).\nPause point: The correct vectors can store at −20°C for years.\nThe correct fragments on T-Vector pMD19 (Simple) and empty PIZT plasmid are supplied to the FastDigest system, respectively, which containing 2.5 μL EcoRI, 2.5 μL XbaI, 10 μL FastDigest Green buffer, and ddH2O.\nKeep the FastDigest system in a thermo cell at 37°C for 1 h.\nThe agarose gel electrophoresis and fragments recovery are carried out as described above (Step 4–8).\nNote: Recovered fragments can store at −20°C for several weeks.",
    "Apply these fragments for DNA ligation using T4 DNA Ligase, according to the user manuals (https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/2011A/2011A_DS.pdf[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/2011A/2011A_DS.pdf]). Keep the ligation system, including 0.3 μL T4 DNA ligase, 1 μL 10× T4 DNA Ligase Buffer, 5–6 μL sequences fragments and 3–4 μL plasmid fragment, at 16°C for at least 1 h.\nTransfect the ligation systems into DH5α chemically competent cell, and the positive colonies are picked, cultured, and verified (the same as Steps 10–13).\nCritical: The PIZT containing bacteria should be cultured in LB cultural medium supplied with Zeocin.\nCulture the correct colonies for plasmid extraction following the instructions of the E.Z.N.A. Endo-Free Plasmid Mini Kit II (https://www.omegabiotek.com/product/e-z-n-a-plasmid-mini-kit-ii/?v=7516fd43adaa&cn-reloaded=1#protocols[href=https://www.omegabiotek.com/product/e-z-n-a-plasmid-mini-kit-ii/?v=7516fd43adaa&cn-reloaded=1]).\nNote: The endo-free plasmids store at −20°C.\nOptional: The PCR productions can be applied to double enzyme digestion and then directly used for DNA ligation. Thus, almost half of the time would be saved. But the digest efficiency could be very low and might take more times on these steps. For example, directly digestion of PCR productions would take 8–10 h or more times to get a few positive colonies, while digestion of vectors could take at least 10 min to get enough positive ones. Moreover, gibson/recombinant DNA cloning would also be used to save time and steps.\nLong dsRNA synthesis\nTiming: 1 week\nThe dsRNA synthesis is carried out to produce the long dsRNA of Sf-Rab7, Sf-RILP-N, Sf-RILP-C, Sf-Atg8 and GFP. The procedure contains some similar steps above.\nAdd T7 RNA polymerase promoter to gene sequences with PCR by including the T7 promoter sequence at the 5′-end of either of the amplification primers.",
    "Note: The minimal T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence should be 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGN(17–22) -3′. The G in bold is the first base incorporated into the RNA strand, and 17–22 gene-specific nucleotides are supplied after the following G. Four PCR primers and two PCR amplifications are required to generate the two necessary DNA templates.\nPrepare the PCR reaction master mix and perform the cloning.\nCritical: The amplification strategies include an initial 5–10 cycles at an annealing temperature approximately 5°C above the melting temperature of the gene-specific sequences, followed by 20–35 cycles of annealing approximately 5°C above the melting temperature of the entire primer, including the T7 promoter.\nExamine the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis to collect the target fragments.\nClone the fragments into recommended pGEM-T or pGEM-T Easy Vectors.\nAlternatives: T vector pMD19 (Simple) can also be used.\nTransfect these constructs into DH5α chemically competent cell, verify the positive colonies and culture the correct colonies. The plasmids are extracted and purified to obtain high-quality DNA templates. (Similar procedure as Step 10–13)\nLong dsRNA for nonmammalian RNAi is obtained according to the T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi System technical bulletin (https://www.promega.com.cn/products/rna-analysis/rna-interference/t7-ribomax-express-rnai-system/?catNum=P1700#protocols[href=https://www.promega.com.cn/products/rna-analysis/rna-interference/t7-ribomax-express-rnai-system/?catNum=P1700]).\nLinearize the DNA by digestion with restriction endonuclease, for example, EcoRI.\nAfter verifying and purifying, it is supplied with the T7 reaction system to produce single-stranded transcripts.\nIncubate at 37°C for up to 2–6 h would maximize the yield.\nMix with equal volumes of complementary RNA reactions to anneal the RNA strands and incubate at 70°C for 10 min.\nSlowly cool to room temperature (about 25°C), which allowing annealing of the double stranded RNA.\nAdd 1 μL freshly diluted RNase Solution and 1 μL RQ1 RNase-Free DNase per 20 μL reaction volume and incubate for 30 min at 37°C to remove single-stranded RNA and the template DNA.",

Add 1 mL/well freshly prepared blocking buffer containing primary antibody, and incubate at room temperature (about 25°C) for 2 h.\nCritical: The primary antibodies are diluted with PBS containing 5% BSA rather than PBS.\nGently collect the primary antibodies.\nCarefully wash the cell slides with PBS for 3 times.",
    "For overexpression, the secondary antibodies are CY3 Conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (1:1000) and CY3 Conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (1:1000). They are diluted with PBS to indicated ratio and add 1 mL/well before incubating in the dark at room temperature (about 25°C) for 2 h.\nFor RNAi, the secondary antibodies are CY3 Conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L).

They are diluted with PBS to indicated ratio and add 1 mL/well before incubating in the dark at room temperature (about 25°C) for 2 h.\nNote: Only one primary antibody, counter stained with Cy3, is used with the overexpression due to the GFP proteins present that would overlap with the FITC channel. As RNAi has no fluorescence, two primary antibodies, counter stained with either Cy3 or FITC, are used.\nUse Hoechst 33258 (1:3,000–5,000) to mark the cell nucleus. It needs to be diluted with PBS and incubated in the dark at room temperature (about 25°C) for 10 min.\nCarefully wash the coverslips with PBS buffer for 3 times.\nDrop a small drop of fluorescent mounting media on the glass slides, which can be applied to maintain the fluorescence.\nPlace the coverslips upside down on the drop and seal the coverslips with varnish.\nAir-dry in the dark at room temperature (about 25°C) before observation.\nObserve the overexpression results with a laser confocal microscope and carry out the fluorescence analysis with the built-in NIS-Elements BR software.",
    "Note: Three laser, DAPI 405 nm, FITC 488 nm, and TRITC 561 nm, are used to detect the blue (425–475 nm), green (500–550 nm), and red (570–620 nm) fluorescence, respectively. An objective lens, Plan Apo VC 20×/0.75 DIC N2, is used, and the zoom is adjusted to 2. The 512 pixels are used for scan and 2048 pixels are applied for capture. A finial 3 × 12bit figure is obtained focusing on the GFP-positive cells. At least five fluorescence pictures are taken under the fixed parameter of each treatment, and more than twice biological replications are carried out during the overexpression experiments.\nCheck the results of RNAi assay with a fluorescence microscope and carry out the fluorescence analysis with Image-Pro Plus 6.0.\nNote: Three channels, blue (EX 330–380, DM 400, BA 420), green (EX 450–490, DM 505, BA 520), and red (EX 510–560, DM 575, BA 590), are used to check the related fluorescence. The objective lens is Plan Fluor 20×/0.50 OFN25 DIC N2, and the exposure times are fixed according to the related channels. For example, parameters, blue 5/10 ns, green 40/80 ns, red 40/80 ns, are commonly used in our tests. Three RGB 8bit figures are obtained and the final size is 1280 × 1024 pixels. At least five visual fields are chosen for taking pictures under the fixed parameter of each treatment. More than twice biological replications are carried out.\nCritical: Both of overexpression and RNAi experiments could use fluorescence microscope or laser confocal microscope. But the overexpression images need to analyze each GFP-positive cells, and the laser confocal microscope is used here to achieve higher data quality and resolution figures. As for RNAi, it knocks off the gene expression of a population not an individual cell, and the wide views are chosen for analysis.\nFluorescence analysis",
    "Timing: 1–2 days\nOriginal fluorescence data are generated from the NIS-Elements BR and the Image-Pro Plus software. The data are analyzed with SPSS 22.0 with t-test and one-way ANOVA analysis.\nPerform the fluorescence statistics of overexpression analysis using NIS-Elements BR.\nOpen the captured confocal figures on the software.\nTurn to the FITC view and select the “Binary”. The parameters are set up as intensity 50–4,000, smooth 2 to cover all the GFP-positive cells.\nNote: The intensity values 50 could mark almost all the FITC-positive cells here and 4000 is the maximum value. Smooth values, which could make the boundaries of selected regions become smooth, show no influence on the fluorescence intensity.\nCopy the Binary to ROI (Region of Interest). All the GFP-positive cells become ROI points.\nSelect options for detection, including ROI area, mean intensity, mean red, mean green, mean blue, and so on. Measure the ROI data and the statistics of the ROI can be exported to Excel.\nThe mean green and mean red represents the mean intensity of FITC and TRITC fluorescence within the related ROI ID area, respectively. Thus, the GFP and CY3 signal of overexpressed cells are collected.\nPerform the fluorescence statistics of RNAi analysis using Image-Pro Plus software.\nOpen figures in the software.\nPerform the operation, Edit - Convert to - Gray Scale 8, and the fluorescence figures become grayscale ones.\nThen choose Enhance - Invert Contrast. The figures turn to black dots and white background.\nMeasure - Calibration - Intensity. In the popup, choose New and Std Optical Density. Set incident level in Options and click the System to apply the calibrated optical density to all the figures.",
    "Select density ranges and measurements in “Measure - Count/sizes”. The Cathepsin L-positive points of red fluorescence were selected with density ≥15, and the Atg8-positive points of green fluorescence were selected with density ≥20. The area, diameter (mean), density (mean), and IOD (Integrated Optical Density) are all evaluated. The area is set ≥20 to avoid fluorescence dots of impurities.\nCount and save the statistical data.\nAnalyze the data with SPSS 22.0 with t-test and one-way ANOVA analysis.\nNote: The t-test is used for comparing two groups, and the one-way ANOVA following by Duncan’s multiple range tests are used to indicate significant differences between different treatments.\nGenerate the figures with NIS-Elements Viewer 5.21 and GraphPad Prism 8.0 following the tutorials and guides (https://www.graphpad.com/resources[href=https://www.graphpad.com/resources])."
