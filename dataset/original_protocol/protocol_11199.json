    "All participants provided both verbal and written informed consent before any study procedure. The protocol of the study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee for human research of S.Orsola-Malpighi Teaching Hospital.\n1. Preoperative Procedures and Ophthalmological Evaluation\nTest distance and near Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA).\nEvaluate the anterior segment of the eye using a slit lamp biomicroscope.\nExamine the anterior chamber angle using a slit lamp gonioscopy lens after having instilled topical anesthetic eye drops.\nEvaluate the fundus by slit lamp indirect ophthalmoscopy with the use of a non-contact fundus lens. Pay particular attention to the optic disc head.\nMeasure the IOP using Goldmann applanation tonometry.\nInstill topical anesthetic eye drops to obtain corneal anesthesia.\nColor the tear film using 2% fluorescein (ophthalmic strips).\n\t\tNOTE: It is crucial to color the tear film with the proper amount of fluorescein. High amounts produce too thick fluorescein rings with overestimated IOP measures, while low amounts produce too thin rings with underestimated IOP readings.\nMount the tonometer on the guide plate over the slit lamp axis.\nSet the blue cobalt filter light and the light beam as wide and bright as possible with the slit diaphragm fully open.\nProperly direct the blue light beam on the tonometer head putting the slit beam at 60° on the same patient's side of the eye under examination, in order to avoid the contact of the slit lamp with the patient's face and the covering of the light beam by the patient's nose.\nAsk the patient to lean the head on the slit lamp headrest, open both eyes wide, look straight ahead, and keep perfectly still.",
    "Move the tonometer using the slit lamp joystick until the biprism head is gently in contact with the center of the corneal surface: two regular hemi-circles of fluorescein tear meniscus are visualized through each prism when looking through the slit lamp eyepieces.\nTurn clockwise the calibrated knob on the side of the tonometer to bring near the visualized fluorescein hemi-circles until their inner borders just touch each other, forming a horizontal \"S\" shape: the number indicated in the calibrated knob represents the IOP measure.\n\t\tNOTE: Be sure to properly disinfect, rinse with sterile water, and wipe the tonometer head before any measurement.\nMeasure the ocular anatomical parameters by means of a non-contact optical biometer.\nAsk the patient to lean the head on the headrest, open both eyes wide, look straight ahead, and keep perfectly still.\nMove the optical biometer using its joystick to properly focus on the center of the corneal surface: an arrow and a green circle on the display help the clinician to find the correct position.\nClick the button on the joystick to start the measurement: a green line appears on the display and starts to move forming a circle. Keep the position as still as possible during this time.\nPerform at least 5 measurements per eye to reduce possible errors and increase reliability. The instrument automatically calculates the average value.\nUse the nomogram tool (Figure 1) to calculate the appropriate size of the treatment probe among the 3 possible options (11, 12, or 13 mm of ring diameters).\n\tNOTE: Two ocular anatomical parameters are needed: the white-to-white (WTW, distance equal to the corneal horizontal diameter) and the axial length (AL, distance from corneal apex to fovea).",
    "Prescribe to the patient pilocarpine eye drops 3 times per day starting from 3 days before surgery to ensure the proper intraoperative miosis, allowing a more precise targeting of the ciliary body by the ultrasound beams delivered by the probe.\n2. Pre-surgical Procedures\nPlace the patient in a supine position on the surgical bed.\nAdminister local anesthesia by performing one peribulbar infiltration with 10 mL of local anesthetics (mepivacaine plus ropivacaine) 30 min before the surgery.\nPerform the injection inferotemporally at the junction of outer one third and inner two third of the lower orbital rim or superonasally beneath the superior orbital notch using a 27-gauge needle.\n3. Preparation of the Treatment Device\nEnter data about the surgeon and patient using the control unit touch screen, and then select the eye to treat.\n\tNOTE: First generation probes also can choose between 4 s or 6 s of ultrasound exposure time, while the second-generation probes (the only ones now available on the market) allow only 8 s of exposure time.\nOpen the sterile single-use device pack containing the coupling cone and the treatment probe and connect their cables to the control unit.\n4. UCP Procedure\nDisinfect accurately the palpebral and periorbital skin with 10% povidone-iodine 3 times. Wipe the disinfected skin with clean sterile gauzes.\nPut a sterile surgical drape over the face of the patient with a central hole centered over the eye under treatment in order to properly expose it.\nPlace the patient's head lying slightly backwards in order to put the ocular surface horizontally allowing a comfortable placement of the cone of the device (Figure 2).\nOpen the patient's eye without using the speculum.",
    "Put the coupling cone over the ocular surface, with tubing on the temporal side, and gently move to correctly position and center it, forming a uniform white scleral ring surrounding the limbus (Figure 3). Use a surgical clamp to reposition the cone, if needed.\n\tNOTE: A minimal uniform ring of 2 mm of white sclera should be visible between the limbus and the cone inner boarder. This ring should be as regular as possible all along the 360° of the eye to ensure the optimal centering of the probe and consequently the correct targeting of the ciliary body (Figure 3).\nPush the aspiration button on the foot switch to start a low-level suction from the peripheral ring of the coupling cone until the vertical bar on the screen becomes green. This allows the maintenance of the coupling cone in direct contact to the patient's eye throughout the entire procedure (Figure 4A).\nInsert the treatment probe inside the coupling cone, with the cable in nasal position.\n\tNOTE: A \"click\" sound confirms the proper anchorage of the probe to the cone (Figure 4B).\nFill the empty space delimited by the eye, the cone, and the probe with sterile balanced salt solution (BSS) at room temperature at the beginning and during the entire procedure to allow good propagation of the therapeutic ultrasounds (Figure 4C). Refill at the appropriate level in case of BSS leakage.\nAsk the patient to hold the position and keep perfectly still the head.\nPush the start button on the foot switch to start the treatment and hold the pressure during all the procedure (the passage between each treatment sector is completely automatic without the need to release pressure of the foot switch).",
    "Maintain firmly in the optimal position the probe and the coupling cone during the entire procedure. Avoid moving, rotating, or pushing the probe in order to permit the best centering of therapeutic ultrasounds beams during the treatment (Figure 4D).\n\tNOTE: During the treatment, each of the six transducers are sequentially activated for 4, 6, or 8 s (depending on the generation of the probe), with 20 s of interval before each activation, starting from the superior sectors and moving clockwise. The control unit shows the sequential activation of the six transducers. Surgical treatment lasts 124 s, 136 s, or 148 s.\n\t\nRelease the pressure on the foot switch to stop the procedure. In case of interruption of the treatment during the interval between the activation of two consecutive sectors, the treatment can continue without losing any sector; on the contrary, in case of interruption of the treatment during the activation of a sector, the treatment in the sector in question is not completed.\nAt the end of the procedure, deactivate the suction system by pressing the aspiration button on the foot switch and slowly tilt the cone until BSS is removed through the tube.\n5. Post-surgical Procedures\nInstill antibiotic plus steroid eye drops in the treated eye immediately after the procedure, and patch the treated eye for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: The patients can leave the hospital 1 h after the procedure.\nRemove the eye patch the day after the procedure, examine the treated eye, and measure the IOP.\nPrescribe to the patient antibiotic plus steroid eye drops 4 times per day for 1 month.\nExamine the treated eye and measure the IOP at 1, 7, and 14 days, 1, 3, 6, and 9 months, and 1 year after the procedure.\nSubscription Required.
