    "All human tissues used for these experiments were acquired via an Institutional Review Board approved protocol and/or exemption at University of Illinois at Chicago.\n1. Section Fresh Frozen Prostate onto PEN-slide and onto Charged Glass Slide\nThe day before or a few hours before sectioning the sample, clean tools (i.e., brush, forceps, coplins, blades, PEN-framed slides (if not already RNase free), an ETOH safe marker and a pencil) and the inside of a RT cryostat with RNase-decontaminating solution using a spray bottle and lab-wipes.\n\t\nAllow RNase-decontaminating solution to sit for 5 min before wiping away, rinse with depcH20 to remove left over RNase-decontaminating solution and a final rinse with 70% EtOH (prepared with depcH20).\n\t\tNote: It is essential to maintain an RNase-free workspace. All coplins, tools, frozen mounting medium, blades and slides used should be used only for RNase free work and never used in a standard non-RNase free environment. All instruments must be treated with an RNase decontamination solution before each experiment.\nCool cryostat to -24 °C.\nPlace the following cleaned RNase free instruments inside cryostat to cool at least 30 min prior to sectioning: slide coplin-filled with 100% ethanol, tools, small frozen tissue cassettes and mounting chuck.\nRetrieve frozen prostate tissue from cryostorage and place into a dry-ice-filled foam bucket for transport. Place tissue into cryostat to equilibrate to cryostat temperature for at least 30 min.\n\tNote: Human prostate tissues for laser-capture micro-dissection can be either fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE). The time constraints and slide preparation are slightly different between tissue sources. Here we describe the steps for frozen sections.\nWork with one tissue at a time, and squirt frozen mounting medium into the bottom of the cassette and quickly mount the frozen prostate tissue into the frozen mounting medium using the chilled forceps.",
    "Place the cassette with tissue onto chiller in cryostat for 5 min to set frozen mounting medium.\nSquirt a small amount of frozen mounting medium onto the chuck and carefully press mounted tissue bottom side up onto the frozen mounting medium. Let set in the cryostat for 5 min to allow the frozen mounting medium to completely solidify.\nPlace chuck into the holder and tighten.\nLock the handle in locked position and place a new blade onto the cryostat. For downstream molecular endpoints that include an amplification step (i.e., qPCR) it is advisable to use a new blade for each patient to prevent contamination (or move the blade over to use area of the blade for the next sample).\nUnlock the handle and carefully advance the tissue by hand or with a foot pedal to even and expose the tissue with 50 µm sections until the desired tissue exposure is reached.\nAdjust cryostat to 5 µm, cut one or two sections and place them onto charged glass slide for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (see Step 2).\nImmediately place the slide into the cold 100% ethanol for 2 min.\nRemove the charged glass slide from ethanol and let it dry at RT before proceeding to H&E staining (Step 2).\nPlace RT PEN-frame slide on a frame supporter.\nAdjust cryostat to 10 µm and place sections onto the RT PEN frame slides. One to four sections can be place onto each slide depending on the tissue size.\nImmediately plunge the slide into the cold 100% ethanol for 2 min.\nRemove the PEN-frame slides from ethanol and store the slide in a slide box in a desiccator box in a -80 °C freezer until ready for LCM. Three days is the maximum storage time for optimal RNA recovery.",
    "Proceed with Step 2 for ONLY the charged glass slide. Proceed with Step 3 for PEN-frame slide.\n2. Hematoxylin and Eosin-Y (H&E) Stain for Histological Mark-up\nNote: This if for the tissue on the charged glass slide and NOT the PEN-frame slide for LCM.\nHydrate the sections on the charged glass slide dipping the slide through graded ethanol as follows: dip the slide two times in 100% ethanol for 3 min, two times in 95% ethanol for 3 min, once in 70% ethanol for 3 min and two times in distilled H2O for 3 min.\n\t\nPrepare acid alcohol solution: 99 ml 70% ethanol + 1 ml 1% HCl and 0.1% sodium bicarbonate solution: 0.1 g Sodium bicarbonate in 100 ml distilled H2O\nDip the slide in Hematoxylin Gill II (0.4%) for 5 min.\nWash off excess stain in steady running tap H2O for 3 min.\nDip the slide 10 times in acid alcohol\nWash the slide in running tap H2O for 3 min.\nDip the slide in 0.1% sodium bicarbonate solution for 30-60 sec to turn the purplish color to blue.\nWash the slide in running tap H2O for 3 min.\nRinse the slide in 95% ethanol with 10 dips.\nDip the slide in Eosin-Y 2-3 times for 15 sec total.\nDehydrate the slide through graded ethanol as follows: dip the slide two times in 95% ethanol, two times in 100% ethanol, and two times in Xylene (make sure the tissue appears clear which indicates thorough dehydration).\nMount the slide with non-aqueous permanent hard mounting medium and cover slip.\nLet the slide dry for 30 min.\nScan slide with any whole slide scanner and print a large, high-resolution image onto 8” x 11” paper.",
    "Outline areas of interest (typically done by a board certified pathologist) with a marker. This markup is the guide for the LCM procedure.\n3. Toluidine Blue Staining of PEN-frame Slides\nNote: This is done the SAME DAY as the LCM. Use depcH2O water for all solutions. Complete all steps in RNase-free area. All coplins must be cleaned with RNase-decontaminating solution.\nThe day of LCM remove the PEN-frame slides from -80 °C freezer and hydrate by gently dipping slides into 90% EtOH for 2 min then 75% EtOH for 2 min.\n\t\nPrepare 0.5% toluidine blue by dissolving in molecular biology grade water then filter sterilize through a 0.2 µm filter and store at RT. This solution may be re-used for up to 6 months. Note: It is highly advised to prepare the solution prior to as the filtration can take a few hr.\nStain the prostate tissue by gently dipping slides into 0.5% toluidine blue for 5-30 sec. Destain the tissue by washing slides 2 times in depcH2O for 15 sec followed by 75% EtOH for 30 sec to 3 min. Note: stain and destain times can be adjusted to ensure good staining. Prostate tends to over stain.\nTransfer PEN-frame slides to RNAase-free dry container on ice.\n4. Laser-capture Micro-dissection (LCM)  \nImmediately prior to LCM, dry slide on a slide warmer at 42 °C for 15 min. Dry only the slide that will be processed and store the rest on ice until ready for them.\nTurn on LCM and computer in this order, microscope power, the laser key, the laser switch and then the computer. Launch the Laser Microdissection software.",
    "Use the software to control the microscope to load the slides and collection tubes. Click on “unload sample holder”, load the slide with the sections onto the microscope slide holder with the tissue facing down and insert the slide holder in the appropriate slot in the microscope, then click “continue”.\n\t\nClick on “unload collection tubes”, label and load 0.5 ml tubes onto tube holder and insert it in the appropriate slot in the instrument. Once caps are secured, add 35 μl of Lysis buffer to the collection caps and try to avoid bubbles. Then click “OK”.\n\t\tNote: If evaporation is an issue, dilute the buffer as follows: 25 µl lysis buffer with 10 µl depcH2O.\nIn the software, select the position where the slide has been placed in the slide holder. Select the collection cap to collect the LCM specimen.\nVisualize and focus the slide through the computer at 10X. Use the software to calibrate the laser by selecting “Laser” then “calibrate”. Adjust the power, aperture and speed of the laser, selecting “laser” then “control” to allow the laser beam to cut the area selected completely and efficiently. Repeat adjustments until the laser cuts completely through the tissue.\nUsing the 8” x 11” pathologist mark-up as a guide, use the “draw shape” tool to circumscribe the desired areas of epithelium in the view and avoid collecting any stroma.\n\tNote: Multiple areas can be selected within one view, but do not move to another view without first cutting by clicking the “cut shape” tool.",
    "If an area does not get completely cut by the laser use the “move and cut” tool to go over it manually. Continue moving the objective to new views and repeat laser cutting until slide is completely dissected or the desired amount of tissue has been collected (typically 100 benign glands yield 150-500 ng of RNA). (see example in Figure 1A).\nCarefully remove tubes from the collection holder and close the caps, being mindful of the lysis buffer and tissue in the caps. Briefly centrifuge for 30 sec to collect liquid and tissue in the bottom of the tube. Incubate the samples at 42 °C for 30 min and store at -80 °C until ready for RNA isolation.\n5. Total RNA Isolation with a Filter-based Kit and Quality Analysis\nThaw out the tubes on ice and bring the volume of the solution to 100 µl.\nPre-wet the micro filter of an RNA isolation kit by applying 30 µl ofLysis Solution to the center of the filter and allow it to soak whileperforming the next two steps (at least 5 min).\nAdd 3 µl of LCM Additive solution (provided in the kit) to the lysate and mix by vortexing for 5 sec. Centrifuge for 30 sec to collect the fluid at the bottom of the tube.\nCentrifuge the pre-wetted filter for ~30 sec at top speed to remove liquid.\nAdd 1.25 volumes (in this case 129 µl) of 100 % ethanol to the lysate mixture, gently vortex or pipette up and down. **This method will recover both large and small RNA species.",
    "Load the sample onto the pre-wetted micro filter, and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min to bind the RNA to the filter. Then wash micro filter with 180 µl of “Wash solution 1,” centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min.\n\tNote: From this point on all centrifugations should be done at 13,000 x g, or maximum speed.\nWash filter twice with 180 µl of ”Wash solutions 2 and 3”, respectively as directed by the kit protocol. Centrifuge for 30 sec, then discard the flow through, and spin the filter for 1 min to remove residual fluid and to dry the filter.\nTransfer filter to a new collection tube.\nWarm elution solution to -95 °C (provided with the kit).\nApply 10 µl of preheated elution solution to the center of the filter, close the cap and store for 5 min at RT. Then centrifuge for 1 min to elute the RNA, and repeat this step one time to yield ~20 µl of RNA.\nPerform the DNase I treatment for 15 min at 37 °C.\nQuantify the RNA by spectrophotometer with absorbance at 260 nm. The ratio of optical density at wavelengths of 260 nm and 280 nm is used to assess the purity of the RNA (see Table 1)15.\n6. Gene Expression Analysis\nNote: Gene expression of long RNA species (like mRNAs and lncRNAs) is shown in Step 6.1 and short RNA species (like microRNAs) is shown in step 6.2. Different kits are available for RT-qPCR and the amount of RNA required varies by kit (as little as 10 ng). RNA sequencing analysis is described in 6.3.",
    "Reverse transcribe (RT) the RNA to cDNA mixing 5 µl of 20 ng/µl RNA sample with 5 µl of the RT master mix (RT buffer, dNTP’s, random primers, RT enzyme, RNase inhibitor). Incubate the reaction for 25 min at 25 °C, then 120 min at 37 °C and 5 min at 85 °C.\nDilute the RT reaction 1:10 with RNase free water and use 2.5 µl per 10 µl qPCR reaction with primers or primer/probe sets for the genes of interest.\n\tNote: To facilitate analysis of partially degraded RNA It is advisable to use primers for shorter amplicons (less than 100 bp)16. (Table 2B)\nFor microRNA expression analysis run the RT reaction by mixing 5 µl of 2-10 ng/µl RNA sample with 5 µl of the RT master mix.\n\t\tNote: each commercially-available PCR-based microRNA detection technology requires the use of proprietary and specific RT primers.\nAlternatively or in addition to RT-PCR, use next generation sequencing (RNA-seq or small-RNA-seq) to quantify different species of RNAs. Typically, use 500 ng of RNA for this procedure (Table 3) and carry out the method as indicated by the manufacturer and detection instrument.\nSubscription Required.
