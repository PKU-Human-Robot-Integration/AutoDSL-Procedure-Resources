    "Thaw PBMCWarm Complete RPMI media to 37 °C in water bath. Each sample will require 20 ml of media with benzonase. Calculate the amount needed to thaw all samples, and prepare a separate aliquot of warm media with 1:10,000 benzonase (25 U/ml final concentration; benzonase removes reduces viscosity and background from free DNA from lysed cells). Thaw no more than 10 samples at a time. Remove samples from liquid nitrogen and transport to lab on dry ice.Place 10 ml of warmed benzonase media into a 15 ml tube, making a separate tube for each sample. Thaw frozen vials in 37 °C water bath.When cells are nearly completely thawed, carry to hood. Add 1 ml of warm benzonase media from appropriately labeled centrifuge tube slowly to the cells, then transfer the cells to the centrifuge tube. Rinse vial with more media from centrifuge tube to retrieve all cells.Continue with the rest of the samples as quickly as possible.Centrifuge cells at (RCF = 483) for 10 min at room temperature.Remove supernatant from the cells and resuspend the pellet by tapping the tube.Gently resuspend the pellet in 1 ml warmed benzonase media. Filter cells through a 70 micron cell strainer if needed (i.e. if you observe any clumps). Add 9 ml warmed benzonase media to the tube to make volume 10 ml altogether.Centrifuge cells (RCF = 483) for 10 min at room temperature.Remove supernatant from the cells and resuspend the pellet by tapping the tube.Resuspend cells in 1 ml CyFACS buffer.Count cells with Vicell (or hemocytometer). To count, take 20 μl cells and dilute with 480 μl CyPBS in Vicell counting chamber. Load onto Vicell as PBMC with a 1:25 dilution factor.Calculate the resuspension volume needed to obtain 1 million viable cells.",
    "Note: It is typical to recover 4-8 x 106 cells from a vial frozen at 10 x 106 cells/vial. Stain cellsDay oneAdd 1 million viable cells from a donor into a well of the 96 well plate. Repeat for all samples. Add CyFACS buffer to approximately 600 μl and centrifuge cells (RCF = 483) for 10 min at room temperature.Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant, and repeat wash step and centrifugation with 500 μl CyFACS.Make cocktail in CyFACS buffer of metal-chelating polymer-labeled antibodies according to previously determined titration. Make sufficient volume for each sample to have 50 μl of cocktail. Pipet into 0.1 μm spin filter and centrifuge in a tabletop microcentrifuge (RCF = 14,000) for 10 min at room temperature.Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant from second wash step B2. Add 50 μl antibody cocktail to each sample. Pipet up and down to mix. Incubate on ice for 60 min.Add 500 μl CyFACS buffer, then centrifuge cells (RCF = 483) for 10 min at room temperature. Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant, resuspend pellet in 500 μl CyFACS, and centrifuge cells (RCF = 483) for 10 min at room temperature.Make 1:3,000 dilution in CyPBS of 5 mg/ml live-dead maleimide-DOTA stain. Add 100 μl to each sample, pipetting to mix. Incubate on ice for 30 min.Add 500 μl CyFACS buffer, then centrifuge cells (RCF = 483) for 10 min at room temperature. Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant, resuspend pellet in 500 μl CyFACS, and centrifuge cells (RCF = 483) for 10 min at room temperature.Add 100 μl of 2% PFA (in CyPBS); pipet to mix. Place at 4 °C overnight. PFA fixation is required due to permeabilization and MilliQ water wash osmotic stress in Day two.",
    "Day twoAdd 500 μl CyFACS buffer, then centrifuge cells (RCF = 805) for 10 min at 4 °C. Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant, resuspend pellet in 500 μl CyFACS, and centrifuge cells (RCF = 805) for 10 min at 4 °C.Note: It is common to increase RCF after fixation, particularly during permabilization steps. Live cells in Day 1 cannot take the stress.Make 1x saponin permeabilization buffer in CyPBS. Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant from step 9. Add 100 μl of 1x saponin permeabilization buffer to each sample, pipet to mix. Incubate on ice for 45 min.Add 500 μl CyFACS buffer, then centrifuge cells (RCF = 805) for 10 min at room temperature. Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant, resuspend pellet in 500 μl CyFACS, and centrifuge cells (RCF = 805) for 10 min at 4 °C.Make 1:2,000 dilution in CyPBS of Ir-intercalator. Add 100 μl of diluted Ir-intercalator solution to each sample, pipet to mix. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.Add 500 μl CyFACS buffer, then centrifuge cells (RCF = 805) for 10 min at room temperature. Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant, resuspend pellet in 500 μl CyFACS, and centrifuge cells (RCF = 805) for 10 min at 4 °C. Flick or aspirate to remove supernatant, and repeat at least twice with 500 μl of MilliQ water. The MilliQ water washes are critical to remove buffer salts, which can cause the Current setting on the CyTOF to drift over the course of your experiment.Acquire samples on the CyTOF, after standard instrument setup procedures. Collect at least one “push” of 500 μl per sample.Analyze dataAnalyze data using FlowJo software using the standard CyTOF template. Adjust gates on a donor-specific basis, if necessary, to control for any differences in background or positive staining intensity.",
