    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIt was necessary to use endothelial cells in co-culture with muscle cells to recreate the in vivo vascular environment and to perform calcification experiments on a dynamic model in LiveBox2. In our in vitro cell model, we used HCASMCs and HCAECs, respectively. The cells were purchased in cryopreserved form, and the starting culture was carried out following the manufacturer’s instructions. The starter culture should be set up on their first use.\nStep 1: HCASMCs culture for a dynamic vascular model\nTiming: 1 week\nThis section describes the steps for HCASMCs culture initiation and maintenance.\nNote: Typically, HCASMCs of passages 3 to 8 were used for vascular calcification studies.\nHCASMCs culture initiation from cryopreserved batch.\nRemove the vial of cells from liquid nitrogen and rapidly thaw by placing it at 37°C in a water bath with gentle agitation until only a tiny piece of ice remains visible.\nWhen the materials of the vial have thawed, wipe the outside with disinfecting solution and move it to a safety cabinet.\nOptional: determine the number of viable cells per ml (mixing cell solution with trypan blue) using a hemocytometer.\nDilute the vial’s contents (1 mL) with supplemented Medium 231 (10 mL for a T75 flask, 5 mL for a T25 flask). Gently swirl the flask.\nIncubate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator, and do not disturb for at least 24 h after the culture has been initiated. Change the medium the following day.\nHCASMCs culture maintenance.\nFollowing the first medium change, replace with fresh medium every other day until the culture is approximately 90% confluent (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), and then they are ready to be split. Most of the cells should have a spindle-shaped morphology at this stage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2741-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. HCASMCs in the culture at a confluence of 90%\nScale bar represents 20 μm.\nTo achieve the highest cell densities, change the culture medium every day until reaching confluence. Such prepared cells are ready to be seeded in LiveBox2.\nStep 2: HCAECs culture for a dynamic vascular model\nTiming: 1 week\nThis section describes steps for HCAECs culture initiation and maintenance.\nNote: Typically, HCAECs of passages 4 to 7 were used for vascular calcification studies.\nDefrosting of cryopreserved HCAECs by passing briefly in a thermostatic bath at 37°C.\nNote: Follow the same steps as in the HCASMCs section using supplemented endothelial growth medium MV2.\nHCAECs subculture and proliferation.\nAfter the first medium change 24 h after thawing, replace the medium completely every 48 h.\nUpon reaching a cell density of about 80% (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), pass the cells into flasks for maintenance and/or seed in plates or LiveBox2 for calcification experiments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2741-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. HCAECs in culture\nWhen cells reach a confluence of 80%, they are ready to be split. Scale bar represents 20 μm.\nStep 3: Day 0 - Cells seeding in the LiveBox2\nTiming: 6.5 h\nThis section describes steps for HCASMCs and HCAECs seeding in the bioreactor.\nNote: The allometric scaling described in the supplementary information describes the ratio between the HCASMCs and the HCAECs that have to be seeded in a LiveBox2 chamber.\nNote: The HCAECs and HCASMCs were kept at 37°C and 5% CO2 and maintained in HCAEC medium and Medium 231, respectively, replacing medium every 2 days. When 80% confluent, HCAECs and HCASMCs need to be split. All the following procedures must be performed in sterile conditions under a laminar flow safety cabinet.\nPre-warm Endothelial and 231 complete medium, trypsin/EDTA solution and PBS to room temperature (20°C–22°C).",
    "Aspirate medium in HCASMCs flasks and wash twice with PBS each. Add 1 mL trypsin/EDTA solution to a T25 flask and incubate for 3–5 min.\nAdd 4 mL of Medium 231 and dispense the medium over the cell layer until they are detached from the flask.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL tube and proceed with the centrifugation step at 900 ×g for 5 min.\nPerform a cell count using a hemocytometer.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in Medium 231 to have 30,000 HCASMCs in 200 μL.\nUsing a 1,000 μL pipette, insert 200 μL of HCASMCs suspension into the lower chamber of LiveBox2 using the inlet tube (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). The cells will grow adhering to the glass coverslip.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2741-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cell seeding in LiveBox2\n(A) HCASMCs are seeded in the lower chamber through the inlet tube using a 1,000 μL pipette.\n(B) HCAECs are inserted into the upper chamber using the inlet tube.\nAdd 600 μL Medium 231 to allow all cells to enter the chamber. Proceed slowly to avoid the formation of air bubbles (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nIncubate the LiveBox2 in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified cell culture incubator. Wait for the attachment on the glass coverslip before proceeding with the seeding of the HCAECs (about 4 h).\nAfterwards, aspirate the medium in HCASMCs flasks and wash twice with PBS. Add 1 mL trypsin/EDTA solution to a T25 flask and incubate for 3–5 min.\nAdd 4 mL of Endothelial medium and dispense it over the cells until HCAECs are detached.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL tube and proceed with the centrifugation step at 900 ×g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in the HCAEC medium to have 45,000 HCAECs in 200 μL.",

The removed media could be stored at –80°C for further analysis.\nRepeat the same for the Endothelial medium in the upper chamber of LiveBox2 using the inlet tube. Replace the HCAECs medium bottle with one containing 15 mL of Endothelial cells growth fresh medium and connect with the upper chamber.\nTurn on the pump and set the CCW flow at 250 μL/min.

These media can be stored at –80°C for further analyses.\nStep 7: Post-treatment cell viability",
    "Timing: 30 min plus incubation\nThis section describes the steps for cell viability assessment.\nNote: The metabolic capacity of HCASMCs and HCAECs as a mirror of the cell viability can be assessed through the CellTiter-Blue® Cell Viability Assay kit. The rationale behind the kit is that viable, healthy cells convert resazurin into resorufin, a fluorescent product that can be quantitatively measured through spectrometer detection.\nUsing the outlet tube, aspirate the media from the bottom chamber (media in contact with HCASMCs) and transfer it to a 1.5 mL tube. Repeat the procedure for the upper chamber (media in contact with HCAECs).\nFor each chamber, add 1 mL of CellTiter-Blue® solution at 10% v/v by mixing Reference medium or Endothelial Cell Growth complete medium for HCASMCs or HCAECs respectively, with CellTiter-Blue® reagent (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). In separate tubes, prepare blank controls for HCASMCs or HCAECs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2741-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Cell viability assay\nCellTiter-Blue® reagent is mixed with either HCASMC or HCAEC medium and added to the bottom or upper chamber respectively, using the inlet tube.\nIncubate for 2 ½ hours.\nTransfer 100 μL of the such-prepared mix to a 96-multiwell plate; loading each sample in triplicate is recommended. Shake the plate for 10 s and record fluorescence at 560/590 nm. Subtract fluorescence generated after recording to the appropriate blank (either HCASMCs or HCAECs medium).\nStep 8: LiveBox2 disassembly for subsequent analyses\nTiming: 15 min\nThis section describes the steps for LiveBox2 disassembling and cells recovering for subsequent analyses.\nNote: The following operations do not require a sterile hood.\nDisassemble the LiveBox2, rotating the S-shape lock and remove the upper cylinder.\nCollect the membrane using tweezers. Wash twice with PBS and store inside a 1.5 mL tube at –80°C for further analyses.",
    "Gently remove the bottom cylinder from the base to retrieve the glass disc (Methods video S6[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6]).\nNote: Pay close attention. The glass disc could break at this stage.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S6. LiveBox2 disassembly, related to step 8\n    \nStep 9: HCASMCs lysis for calcium quantification\nTiming: 2 h plus overnight incubation (18–24 h)\nThis section describes the steps for HCASMCs lysis to release the intracellular calcium deposits.\nNote: Calcium deposition occurs when cells are exposed to a pro-calcifying environment. After the incubation period with the appropriate medium, typically not less than 7 days, HCASMCs can be processed for calcium quantification measurement. To release intracellular deposits, HCASMCs must be lysed first.\nAfter LiveBox2 disassembly, move each coverslip into a 12 multiwell plate. Remember to label each sample.\nGently wash HCASMCs twice with PBS (previously equilibrated to room temperature (20°C–22°C)).\nLyse cells by adding 200 μL per well (for a 12 multiwell format) of HCl 0.6 M.\nIncubate for 1 h at 4°C.\nFollowing this period, dislodge cells vigorously by pipetting and scraping with a pipette tip.\nMove the plate to a –20°C freezer overnight (18–24 h) to further promote the cell lysis.\nThe following day, scrape each well and check with a microscope whether cell lysis occurred. Collect cell lysates in 0.5 mL tubes and proceed with calcium quantification (problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: Special caution should be taken when handling HCl. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required. This also includes sample handling when stored in HCl.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at −20°C for longer if not processed after overnight incubation (18–24 h).\nStep 10: Intracellular calcium quantification\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the steps for HCASMCs intracellular calcium quantification.",
    "Note: The calcium ion concentration is determined by detecting a chromogenic complex (calcium ions and o-cresolphthalein). The reaction is very specific, and the signal intensity is directly proportional to the quantity of calcium ions in the sample. This analysis is performed using Calcium Colorimetric Assay Kit.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nPrepare six standard dilutions as per manufacturer’s suggestion. These need to be freshly prepared before each use and in a final volume of 50 μL. Follow the scheme reported below. Prepare enough volume to perform duplicates for each dilution.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2741_2.csv\nTransfer 50 μL of each sample to a 96-multiwell transparent plate. Within the same plate, also transfer the diluted standard.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 90 μL per well of Chromogenic reagent and gently mix with the pipette. Avoid vigorous pipetting as it may cause the formation of foam.\nAdd 60 μL per well of Calcium assay buffer with a multichannel pipette and gently mix.\nIncubate for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C), protected from light.\nRecord absorbance at 575 nm."
