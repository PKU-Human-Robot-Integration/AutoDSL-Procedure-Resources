    "The methods described were approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangdong General Hospital.\n1. Obtain PRP by Manual Centrifugation\nPrepare the patient in a supine position in a sterile laminar flow operating room with a comfortable room temperature and humidity: room temperature is 22 Â°C and room humidity is 60%.\nUse a 1-mL syringe to draw 0.2 mL of heparin sodium (2 mL = 12,500 U), and then moisten a 50-mL syringe.\n\tNOTE: 3 mL of sodium citrate is also typical in this step to replace the heparin sodium.\nRig a tourniquet, sterilize the elbow 2-3 times, and use the moist 50-mL syringe to draw 30 mL of peripheral blood from the elbow vein.\nPerform the first centrifugation.\n\t\nDivide peripheral blood equally into two 50 mL sterile centrifuge tubes.\nPut two tubes in horizontal rotors and then in the centrifuge, under aseptic conditions.\nCentrifuge for 6 minutes at 800 x g.\nTake the horizontal rotors out, wear sterile gloves, and take centrifuge tubes out.\nObserve the stratifications to make sure that the peripheral blood is stratified into two layers.\nUse a clean 10-mL syringe to collect the supernatant liquid from these two centrifuge tubes into a clean centrifuge tube.\nPerform the second centrifugation.\n\t\nUse a clean 10-mL syringe to add an equivalent amount of sterile water or normal saline into another clean centrifuge tube for balance. Put the tubes in the horizontal rotors. Mark the one with the supernatant layer liquid by adhesive plaster.\nCentrifuge for 5 minutes at 1400 x g.\nTake the horizontal rotors out, and by observing the stratifications check that the liquid of the marked tube is divided into three layers.",
    "Use a 10-mL syringe to draw 4 mL of liquid from the middle granular cell layer (leukocyte-rich, PRP layer) and the bottom layer of supernatant. If the middle layer quantity is sufficient, just draw 4 mL from that.\nPut 0.4 mL of the liquid in a sterile anticoagulation tube (K2EDTA, 3.6 mg) for evaluation, leaving 3.6 mL of liquid remaining in the syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Intra-Articular Administration of PRP\nLet the patient lie supine on the operating table and bend the knee to 90 degrees.\nLocate the puncture site at the inferior margin of the patella and 1 cm from the lateral patellar ligament. Use a marker pen to mark the site.\nPerform skin sterilization on the puncture site three times with anerdian III, wearing sterile gloves, and cover with an aseptic hole-towel.\nPlace the syringe parallel to the tibial plateau, and then perform the puncture at an angle of 45 degrees. Completely insert the needle into the skin.\nInject the 3.6 mL of PRP from the syringe into the knee joint cavity.\nCover the puncture position with sterile gauze and fix it with adhesive plaster.\nApply pressure to the wound for 10 minutes. Observe for any severe adverse reaction for 30 minutes.\nAdminister a total of three injections at monthly intervals.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n3. Postoperative Evaluation of PRP Injection\nEvaluate the concentration of blood platelets in the PRP.\n\t\nUse the 0.4 mL of PRP from the anticoagulation tube (K2EDTA, 3.6 mg).\nAnalyze the blood platelet concentration of the PRP using an automatic blood cell analyzer.\nEvaluate the postoperative outcome of the PRP injection.",
    "With a consultation 1 day before each of the three treatments, conduct further patient follow-up 1 day after each treatment, 3 days after each treatment, 1 week after each treatment, 1 month after the third treatment, 3 months after the third treatment, and 6 months after the third treatment.\nUse a visual analog scale (VAS), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee Society Score (KSS), and Lysholm knee functional scale to evaluate the postoperative effect.\nSubscription Required.
