    "Preparation of reagentsSiliconization and sterilizationAdd 5 ml of Sigmacote to clean glass bottles in order to prevent the beads from sticking to the glassware.Rotate the vessel or glassware to ensure that the Sigmacote covers the entire surface of the glass bottle.Aspirate excess Sigmacote from the glassware and allow to air dry in a laminar flow hood.Thoroughly wash the glassware in deionized tissue culture grade water. A minimum of two washings is suggested.Sterilize glassware by autoclaving.Note: Once glassware has been siliconized, it is not necessary to treat prior to each use. Cytodex bead preparationIn a 50 ml Falcon tube, hydrate 0.5 g dry beads in 50 ml PBS (pH = 7.4). Place on a rocker for at least 3 h at RT.Let beads settle (~15 min). Aspirate the supernatant using a pipette and wash 3 x 5 min in 50 ml fresh PBS using a rocker at RT. Do not vortex.Aspirate PBS using a pipette and replace with fresh PBS (50 ml) such that the bead concentration is 10 mg/ml or 30,000 beads/ml.Transfer the bead suspension in a siliconized glass bottle.Sterilize the beads by autoclaving for 15 min at 115 °C.Store at 4 °C.Fibrinogen solution preparation (see Recipes)Thrombin stock solution preparation (see Recipes)Aprotinin stock solution preparation (see Recipes)Preparation of cellsChange the growth media for HUVECs and fibroblasts to EGM-2 media 1 day before use. For HUVECs, switch medium to EGM-2 the day before beading. For fibroblasts, switch the FGM-2 medium to EGM-2 the day before embedding in fibrin. Beading requires ~400 HUVECs per bead. Use 20,000 fibroblasts per well of a 24-well plate.Coating the beads with HUVEC (Day-1)Warm EGM-2 media in a water bath set to 37 °C.Trypsinize HUVECs which should be 80% confluent. Wash cells with PBS and then add 3 ml of trypsin.",
    "Allow trypsin to remain on cells for approximately 2 min or until cells begin to detach from the flask. Add EGM-2 media to neutralize the trypsin and bring the total volume to 10 ml. Spin cells in a centrifuge, remove supernatant with an aspirator, and adjust cell concentration to 2 x 106 cells/ml.Under sterile conditions, place 170 μl bead solution (stock concentration: 30,000 beads/ml) in a FACS tube. This should be ~5,000 beads. Allow beads to settle (do not centrifuge), aspirate the supernatant, and wash the beads in 2 ml of warm EGM-2 medium. Remove media using a pipette and add fresh warm media for a total volume of 2 ml.Add 2 x 106 HUVEC (1 ml of 2 x 106 cells/ml) to 5,000 beads (in 2 ml) in the FACS tube (total volume 3 ml). Place tube vertically in the incubator. This will be enough for ~20 wells.Incubate for 4 h at 37 °C, inverting and mixing the tube every 20 min. Beads should look like mini golf balls after beading (Figure 1).After 4 h, transfer the coated beads to a T25 tissue culture flask and leave overnight in a total volume of 5 ml of EGM-2 at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Embedding coated beads in fibrin gel (Day 0)Add 0.15 Units/ml of aprotinin to 15 ml of fibrinogen solution.Check HUVEC coated beads. Transfer 5 ml of coated beads to a 15 ml conical tube and let the beads settle. Use additional 5 ml of media to wash off beads that are stuck to flask.Let beads settle to the bottom of the tube. Aspirate off media. Re-suspend beads in 1 ml of EGM-2 and transfer to a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.",
    "Wash the beads 2 x with 1 ml of EGM-2, mixing by pipetting up and down very slowly/carefully (beads are fragile) with a P1000 pipette.Add 6.25 μl of thrombin stock solution (50 U/ml) to the center of each well of a 24-well plate. This will result in 0.625 U/ml once 0.5 ml of fibrinogen/bead suspension is added in the next step. Get fibrinogen/bead mixture into solution by pipetting up and down gently. Add 0.5 ml of fibrinogen/bead suspension to each well. Mix the thrombin and the fibrinogen/beads by pipetting up and down gently ~five times. Change the pipette tip for each well in order to prevent clotting in the pipette tip between wells. Avoid creating bubbles in the fibrin gel (may hinder visibility in gel). Do not move the plate in order to avoid tearing of the fibrin gel. Note: Usually, when the fibrin gel is formed, tiny bubbles will be present in the gel. They will disappear in 3 to 4 days.Allow the fibrinogen/bead solution to solidify for 5 min at RT in hood. It is important that the plate is not disturbed during the first 5 min of clotting because sheared fibrin reduces sprouting. After 5 min, check under microscope to see if beads are evenly distributed (not clumped together). Ideally there should be 200-250 beads per well.Note: Increasing the number of beads per well results in earlier anastomosis.Then incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 10-15 min.While waiting, trypsinize fibroblasts and re-suspend in EGM adjusted to 1 x 106 cell/ml (or 1,000 cells/μl)Note: Fibroblasts will proliferate, migrate and form a monolayer on the fibrin gel.Prepare the appropriate amount of EGM-2 media containing the angiogenesis inhibitor of choice (aflibercept at 50 μg/ml, Dll4 MAB at 50 μg/ml, Integrin α-6 antibody GoH3 at 10 μg/ml).",
    "After incubation, add 1 ml of EGM-2 prepared to each well slowly (drop by drop). If media is added too fast, it could tear the gel.Seed 20 μl of NHLF cell solution (20,000 cells) on top of the clot into each well. Add directly into the center of well and into the media.Replace with fresh EGM-2 medium every other day (day 2, 5, 7, etc.) until desired growth (see notes below) is achieved and capture images accordingly.Notes: Budding/sprouting should be apparent between day 2 and 4.Lumen formation begins around day 4 to 5 and sprouts continue to elongate.Newly formed tubes begin to branch around day 4 to 6.By day 6 to 7, the microvessel-like structures begin to anastomose (connection of two structures) with adjoining tubes.Gel processing and sprout staining for DNA and actinTo stop the assay, 500 μl of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) is added to the gels for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by overnight incubation at room temperature (RT). Wash twice with PBS. To stain the endothelial sprouts, gels are permeabilized with 500 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, washed twice with PBS.Incubate with the mixture of 500 μl of Phalloidin-TRITC (1:1,000) and Hoechst 33258 (1:2,000) in PBS for 1 h at RT.Wash twice with PBS.Note: For qualitative assessment of endothelial sprouting, EGM-2 medium-covered 24-well plates can be imaged with an inverted microscope under bright field settings at desired time points (Figure 2).Image acquisition on ImageXpressMICRO XLFibrin beads assays are performed in 24 well optical plates (Sensoplate). Images of whole wells are acquired with 10x objective using automated microscope ImageXpressMICRO XL and MetaXpress (MX) software, as follows: for each site, proprietary Z-stack journal is used to collect sixteen focus planes separated by 10 μm. Proprietary Z-stack journal is a configured journal (macro) written in MX software.",
    "The configured journal consists of a 'command' guiding the stage move in Z-plane, followed by a command guiding collection of 16 images separated by the distance of 10 μm, followed by a command to create max. intensity projection of these 16 images. Planes are collapsed into one final image using MX Maximum Intensity Projection algorithm.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160923/20160923191808_1361.jpgFigure 1.
