    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTiming: 2 h\nCell sorting into 96-well plates\nCochlear duct cells from Fgfr3-tdTomato/Sox2-GFP mice are sorted into cell subgroups based on the fluorescence intensities of GFP and tdTomato (Waldhaus et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], Kubota et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). This cell sorting protocol is optimized for subsequent cell-type-specific organoid culture, and the gating steps are outlined. A 100 μm nozzle is used with a BD FACSAria II flow cytometer. The cochlear duct cells from Sox2-GFP-negative and non-recombinant Fgfr3-tdTomato (not tamoxifen injected) mice are used as a negative control.\nCritical: To ensure sterile sorting, the nozzle needs to be rinsed with 70% ethanol. Also, clean the sample path by running FACSClean (10% bleach), FACSRinse, and dH2O prior to loading the samples.\nExclude debris by setting cell size (forward scatter) and granularity (side scatter) parameters so that small and low granular particles are excluded (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/776-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Cells labeled with SYTOX Red are detected with 640 nm red laser excitation and using the allophycocyanin (APC) filter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Note: Start with the negative control tube in steps 1–3 to adjust parameter voltages and gates.\nUse phycoerythrin (PE) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) emission filters for detecting tdTomato and GFP excited with the 561 nm yellow-green laser line and the 488 nm blue laser line, respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nLoad negative sample control tube and acquire data until a few thousand events are represented on the FACS plot (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nLoad Fgfr3-tdTomato/Sox2-GFP sample tube and acquire the data. Optimize PE and FITC voltages for proper event separation.\nLoad negative control tube and record the data to document specificity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nLoad Fgfr3-tdTomato/Sox2-GFP sample tube and record the data (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nDefine sorting gates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nGate G1 isolates greater epithelial ridge (GER) cells (mainly lateral- intermediate GER cells).\nGate G2 isolates medial GER cells.\nGate G3 contains pillar cells and Deiters’ cells.\nGate G4 contains pillar cells and hair cells.\nNote: Gates G1–G4 need to be placed into areas where no cells are detected in the negative control dot plot (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nNote: The specific cell groups obtained in G1–G4 have been validated (Kubota et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), but composition of the groups ultimately depends on the gating of each specific sort.\nNote: Depending on the flow cytometer's configuration and capabilities, you might encounter that excitation of tdTomato and GFP fluorescence can only be achieved with the 488 nm blue laser. In this case, color compensation must be performed. We use compensation beads because it is challenging to prepare single-colored cell-based compensation controls. Compensation by hand might lead to better results over the built-in compensation algorithm, which tends to overcompensate. Consultation with facility staff is recommended. A simple solution is to use an instrument that has specific laser lines for tdTomato and GFP.",
    "Select appropriate configurations in Sort Layout; After running the test sort and adjusting the stream for the wells’ centers, sorting into 96-well plates is selected in Menu item “Device”. “Purity” is selected in Menu item “Precision”.\nLoad the sample tube and sort cells.\nNote: At least 1,000 cells per well need to be targeted for efficient growth of the organoids from the cells in G1 and G2 (see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]). The cells in G3 and G4 are viable at a lower concentration of 500 cells per well and grow into small organoids consisting of a few dozen of the cells.\nCells can be validated with an inverted fluorescent microscope for expression of GFP- and/or tdTomato to ensure that they were accurately sorted.\nOrganoid suspension culture\nTiming: 30 min\nThe sorted cells in a 96-well plate are incubated for 7 days at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 to grow organoids. The medium is changed every other day as described in steps 8–11 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/776-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Timeline of cochlear duct cell sorting and culture\n21 days of organoid and colony growth illustrated along the timeline.\nPrepare maintenance medium with freshly added growth factors, small molecules, and recombinant proteins to DMEM/F-12/N-2/B-27/Amp medium. Prewarm the medium to 37°C in the cell culture incubator for 20 min.\nRemove 80 μL of the old medium per well.\nNote: The organoids tend to loosely attach to the dish’s bottom. Carefully aspirate the media from the surface.\nAdd 100 μL of the fresh medium per well.\nPlace the dish back into the incubator.\nOrganoid transfer to adherent culture system\nTiming: 2 h",
    "At culture day 7, the organoids are transferred to an 8-well Lab-Tek glass chamber slide pre-coated with Matrigel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The organoids will attach and spread out on the chamber bottom during the following 14 days and grow into substantially sized colonies.\nPrepare maintenance medium with freshly added growth factors, small molecules, and recombinant proteins to DMEM/F-12/N-2/B-27/Amp medium. Prewarm the medium to 37°C in the cell culture incubator for 20 min.\nCoat the chamber bottom with Matrigel.\nThaw the Matrigel on ice.\nDilute Matrigel ten times with ice-cold DMEM on ice using pre-cooled pipette tips.\nFill the chamber wells with the diluted and cold Matrigel until it covers the chamber bottom.\nIncubate the chamber at 18°C–24°C for 1 h.\nAspirate Matrigel and rinse the chamber with 400 μL DMEM/F12.\nAdd 400 μL fresh maintenance medium per well.\nCritical: Steps e and f need to be performed with care so that the pipette tips do not scratch the chamber bottom.\nRemove 100 μL medium from a single well of the 96-well plate with the 7-days-old organoids (step 11). Transfer the remaining 100 μL of medium with all organoids from a single well into a single chamber well (step 13f). A regular 200 μL pipette tip works well for this transfer procedure. The final volume in the chamber well will be 500 μL.",
    "Note: Solid-type organoids, densely packed with cells inside, have features of otic progenitors, whereas hollow-type organoids do not (Kubota et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Diensthuber et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Most organoids that originate from the FACS purification described in this protocol are of the solid type at culture day seven (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). However, when the culture is initiated with a less defined population of cochlear cells (e.g., organoids grown directly from the dissociated cochlear duct cells without sorting), the grown organoids will have different morphologies (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D). In such cases, solid-type organoids can be picked with a pipette using an inverted microscope and selectively transferred to the chamber wells in order to grow colonies that efficiently give rise to otic epithelial cells. In case that the organoids are grown from undefined cochlear duct cells seeded at 0.5 × 105 cells in 1 mL medium per well of a 12-well suspension culture dish, transfer ten solid-typed organoids into a chamber well. With this strategy, it is possible to successfully grow large colonies with hair cell-like cells (Kubota et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/776-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale bars: 1 mm (a1) and 200 μm (a2).\n(B) Whole well image of organoids grown from pillar cells and Deiters’ cells. The organoids are generally smaller than GER-derived organoids.

    "Incubate the chamber slides at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.\nColony adherent culture\nTiming: 30 min\nThe chamber slide is incubated for 14 days at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The medium is changed every other day as described in steps 16–19 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Colonies will grow during this time period.\nPrepare new maintenance medium with freshly added growth factors, small molecules, and recombinant proteins to DMEM/F-12/N-2/B-27/Amp medium. Prewarm the medium to 37°C in the cell culture incubator for 20 min.\nAspirate ≈90% of the old medium from the wells.\nAdd 500 μL of fresh medium to each well.\nPlace the chamber slide back into the incubator."
