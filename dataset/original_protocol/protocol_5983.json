    "Actin PurificationDay 1:Prepare 1 L 1x G-buffer (see Recipes).Rehydrate and grind the 2.5 g lyophilized rabbit skeletal muscle acetone power in 50 ml G-buffer.Clear the solution by centrifugation at 27,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C in the JA25.50 rotor (Beckman Coulter).Collect the solubilized actin in the supernatant.Polymerize actin in a 250 ml beaker by adding 50 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl2 for 1 h followed by addition of 0.8 M KCl for 30 min at 4 °C.Pellet filamentous actin (F-actin) by centrifugation at 150,000 x g for 3 h at 4 °C using Ti50.2 rotor (Beckman Coulter).Pour off the supernatant and gently wash the surface of the pellet twice with 1 ml G-buffer.Transfer the pellet to a 10 ml homogenizer using a spatula (Do not let the pellet dry) and add 1 ml G-buffer to the homogenizer.Wash the centrifuge tube with G-buffer several times (use a total of 7 ml G-buffer). (This step allows the maximum recovery of actin).Homogenize the pellet by a homogenizer. Brief sonicate the pellet using the Ultrasonic Processors on ice using 1 s on, 1 s off cycles at 30% amplitude for 4 s.Take out the homogenized solution and dialysis against G-buffer for 36 h at 4 °C using SnakeSkinTM dialysis tubing. Change the old G-buffer with a fresh one every 12 h (this step will allow the F-actin depolymerize).Day 2:Change the old G-buffer with the fresh buffer every 12 h.Day 3:Clean the monomeric actin by spinning at 200,000 x g for 2.5 h at 4 °C using a Ti55 rotor and collect the supernatant.Equilibrate the Sephacryl S-300 HR column with 150 ml 1x G-buffer.Load the supernatant collected from Step A14 to the column using 5 ml sample loop.Perform size exclusion chromatography using 1x G-buffer.",
    "Collect the monomeric actin peak after gel filtration chromatography (elution volume is around 50-60 ml) (Figure 1). Determine the concentration of individual fractions from gel filtration and store the G-actin solution at 4 °C (The G-actin could be stored at 4 °C without significant activity lost).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181129/20181129181925_1814.jpgFigure 1. Typical gel filtration profile of G-actin purification. Actin was purified from Sephacryl S-300 HR column. G-actin was eluted at 50-60 ml. Inset showed SDS-PAGE analysis of G-actin eluted peak fraction.Actin Polymerization AssayTurn on the Fluorescence spectrophotometer Cytation 5 and start the software.Set up the reaction program:Parameter: excitation/emission: 365 nm/407 nmTime interval: 15 sCycle number: 299Temperature: Room temperaturePrepare 1 ml 10x KME buffer and 10 ml 1x G-buffer (see Recipes).Calculate the polymerization reaction materials needed based on Table 1. For one reaction, actin mix volume is 25 μl; maximum additional protein volume is 10 μl, 10x KME buffer volume is 12 μl and tops up with 1x G-buffer to total volume is 120 μl.Prepare target protein stock according to Table 1. Prepare actin mix based on Table 2 and keep on ice for 5 min.Prepare reaction mix (without 10x KME) in Corning® Costar® 96-well cell culture plates according to Table 1.Add 12 μl 10x KME to each well together using a multichannel pipette and gently mix the reaction solution.Transfer 110 μl reaction solution into a 96-well black plate and initialize the Fluorescence spectrophotometer for data acquisition. Plot the data using Origin software (Figure 1 is a typical example for actin polymerization assay).Table 1.

Two micromolar actin mixed with 5% pyrene-labeled actin was polymerized with indicated concentrations of Arabidopsis formin AtFH1(FH1COOH). Black, actin only; Blue, 200 nM AtFH1(FH1COOH); Purple, 500 nM AtFH1(FH1COOH). These three curves are the controls for the typical behavior of actin and formin."
