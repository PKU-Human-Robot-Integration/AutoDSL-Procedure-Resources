  "procedures": [
    "The following protocol is designed for the isolation of cardiomyocytes from one litter of neonatal rat pups (10-14 pups). If litter size is significantly different, the procedure may have to be scaled to compensate. The pups should be around 48±6 hr old. All procedures herein have been approved by the North Carolina State University Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC).\n1. Cell Isolation Preparation\nNOTE: Perform the following steps the day before isolation.\nAutoclave the following: large scissors, small scissors, small sharp forceps, large forceps. Use a gravity cycle for 60 min at a minimum of 121 °C and a drying time of 30 min.\nPlace 40 ml of 0.1% trypsin solution in refrigerator to thaw O/N. Refrigerate Hank’s Balanced Salts Solution (HBSS) if not already cold. Prepare a 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) stock media solution.\n\t\nIn 400 ml of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's media (IMDM) add 100 ml FBS, 5 ml L-glutamine (200 mM), 2.5 ml gentamicin (10 mg ml-1), and 0.9 ml 2-mercaptoethanol. Sterilize using vacuum filter. Store media at 4°C for up to 3 weeks and this is scalable for smaller or larger volumes. Dilute 20% FBS stock media 1:1 with IMDM to produce 10% FBS NRCM media. Only make in small batches to prevent repeated heating and cooling of media.\n2. Cell Isolation Day 1\nPerform the following work in a culture hood to prevent contamination of the samples. For best timing start this work in the afternoon since there is an O/N incubation.",
    "Prepare workspace inside a sterile culture hood. Place bench pad in culture hood. Fill two 250 ml beakers with 70% ethanol and place surgical tools in them. Place small bucket of ice in hood. Ensure that it is large enough to hold several tubes and a 150 mm dish. UV sterilize the hood for 10 min. Place 40 ml 0.1% trypsin on ice.\nRetrieve neonatal rat pups from the mother. To keep the animals warm until use, place them in an insulated container such as an ice bucket wrapped in a bench pad to keep them warm.\nFill a 150 mm culture dish with 25 ml HBSS and place on ice. Unwrap 2-3 gauze pads and place in work area. Holding pup by the skin on the back of the neck, spray it with 70% ethanol and place in hood. NOTE: To best maintain sterility, this is can be done by another person who then places the cleaned pup in the hood.\nHold the pup by the skin on the back of the neck. Then using the large scissors, in one quick, strong cut euthanize by decapitation. Blot the blood with gauze. NOTE: Due to variances in IACUC requirements, it may be more appropriate to clean the pup with an ethanol wipe rather than spraying it. Be sure to check with the university IACUC as to their guidelines for this step.\nContinue cutting down anterior side of chest through the ribcage. Squeeze the skin on the neck to help open the ribcage until the heart is visible. Using the small scissors, remove the heart and place in the HBSS culture dish on ice. Repeat for the other pups.",
    "Remove any non-heart tissue from the samples and swirl the HBSS gently to wash the hearts. Transfer the heart tissue to another culture dish containing fresh HBSS and further wash the tissue. Cut the tissue further until the pieces are 1-3 mm3, and then transfer to the trypsin solution. Place trypsin solution on rocker in 4°C refrigerator O/N.\nCell Isolation Day 2\nNOTE: While aspirating in the following steps, use a pipette rather than a vacuum line. The tissue moves easily, and a vacuum line will clog or remove tissue still containing cells. It is best to use a pipette for aspiration instead. If tissue enters the pipette, pipette back out to remove it.\nMake three aliquots of 10% NRCM Media: one with 25 ml and two with 15 ml. Place one 25 ml tube of media in 37 °C water bath. Add 4 ml HBSS to 5 different 15 ml conical tubes and place all on ice. Label each 15 ml tube #1-5.\nAdd 40 ml HBSS to a 50 ml conical tube. Add 10 ml of HBSS to collagenase, pipette to suspend, and combine the solutions to create 50 ml of 1 mg ml-1 collagenase solution. Sterilize using 0.22 µm vacuum filter, and store at RT.\nRetrieve heart tissue/trypsin tube. Ensure that trypsin is clear, and the tissue appears fluffy. Allow the tissue to settle to corner of tube and aspirate as much liquid as possible.\nAdd 25 ml warm 10% FBS NRCM media to the tube and swirl by hand. Cap and rotate in 37 °C water bath for 2 min. Aspirate liquid again. The tissue should float at this step; if so, aspirate from the bottom of the tube.",
    "Add 10 ml collagenase. Rotate in water bath for 2 min or until the solution is cloudy. Quickly aspirate the liquid. Add 10 ml fresh collagenase to tube containing the tissue and rotate in water bath for 2 min. Pipette to mix, transfer solution to tube #1, and place on ice. It may not be possible to remove all of the liquid. Repeat steps 3.2-3.6 for the other three 15 ml conical tubes. Transfer any remaining liquid to tube # 5.\nCentrifuge 15 ml tubes at 410 rcf for 8 min. While centrifuging, place 15 ml 10% FBS NRCM media tube in water bath. Place 40 µm cell strainer on top of a 50 ml conical tube and wet with 2 ml cold HBSS.\nAspirate supernatant from spun down cells. Add 6 ml cold HBSS to each tube and resuspend. Pipette cell suspensions through the strainer into 50 ml conical to remove any tissue. Rinse sides of each 15 ml tube with 3 ml cold HBSS and add to strainer. Centrifuge cells at 410 rcf for 10 min. Aspirate supernatant. Resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml 10% FBS NRCM media and transfer to T-75 flask. Rinse conical with 5ml media and add to flask.\nIncubate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Place last 15 ml 10% FBS NRCM media tube into water bath. Transfer contents of T-75 to a new T-175 flask, rinse T-75 with 15 ml media and add to T-175. Incubate for 1 hr.\n4. Cryopreservation\nPlace freezing media on ice. Transfer cell media from T-175 to 50 ml conical tube, and collect 10 µl of cell suspension for cell counting using Trypan blue. Centrifuge at 410 rcf for 5 min. While centrifuging, count cells using a cell counter.",
    "Aspirate culture media, and resuspend cells in freezing media at a concentration of 2-4 million cells per ml. Place 1 ml of cell suspension in cryogenic vial, then place vials a controlled cooling rate freezing container, and place in -80 °C freezer O/N. Within 1-2 days, transfer vials in liquid nitrogen.\n5. Thawing Cells\nCoat dish in fibronectin by dissolving 250 µl of fibronectin (stock concentration 1 mg ml-1) into 9.75 ml water (final concentration 0.025 mg ml-1). Add enough solution to cover culture plate and incubate at 37oC for at least 30 min.\n\t\nIn four 15 ml conical tubes, make the DMSO/media mixtures as follows by adding DMSO to 20% Media. Add (5%) 9.5 ml media with 500 µl DMSO. Add (2.5%) 9.75 ml media with 250 µl DMSO. Add 10 ml media (make two of these).\nHeat the aforementioned media mixtures in 37 °C water bath. Remove cells from liquid nitrogen and place on dry ice. When media mixtures are warm, thaw cells in 37 °C water bath until just thawed. Do not leave cells in water bath for too long as this may cause damage to the cells.\nTransfer contents of cryogenic vial to 5% DMSO/media tube. Centrifuge at 410 rcf for 8 min. Aspirate supernatant leaving cell pellet. Add contents of 2.5% DMSO/media tube to cell pellet and resuspend. Centrifuge at 410 rcf for 8 min. Aspirate supernatant leaving cell pellet.\nAdd contents of one 0% DMSO/media tube to cell pellet and resuspend. Centrifuge at 410 rcf for 8 min. Aspirate supernatant leaving cell pellet.",
    "Add contents of second 0% DMSO/media to cell pellet and resuspend. Take small sample for cell counting. Centrifuge at 410 rcf for 8 min. While centrifuging count cells in a haemocytometer using Trypan Blue to label dead cells. Record cell amount, as well as viability.\nAspirate supernatant leaving cell pellet. Resuspend in 10% NRCM media (optional: add 100 µM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)) and plate cells on fibronectin-coated dishes.\n6. Cell Culture\nPlate cells at about 100k cells per cm2. Adjust the plating density based on the intended use of the culture. Prepare 2% NRCM media by diluting 20% Media in IMDM in a 1:10 ratio. The following is an outline of a typical culture.\nOn day 1, rinse dead cells away with warm IMDM, add 10% NRCM (optional 100 µM BrdU). On day 2, rinse dead cells away with warm IMDM, add 10% NRCM. Day 3—add 2% NRCM. On day 4 add 2% NRCM. On day 5 ensure that the cells are confluent and beating. Maintain cells in culture for around one week. At that point fibroblasts may begin to significantly outgrow the NRCMs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
