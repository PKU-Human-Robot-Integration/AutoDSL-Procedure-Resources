    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Nanjing University.\n1. CoCrMo Particle Preparation\nObtain CoCrMo particles by using a fabricated high-vacuum three-electrode direct current4. Place CoCrMo alloy in the instrument under 10-3 Pa vacuum, 0.04 MPa argon and hydrogen 3:2 (v/v), and 650 A cathode current.\nMeasure the diameters of CoCrMo particles.\n\t\nAdd 1 mg of CoCrMo particles into 1.5 mL of anhydrous ethanol.\nResuspend CoCrMo particles in anhydrous ethanol by ultrasonic shaking at 28 kHz and 600 W for 5 min.\nApply one drop (about 20 µL) of the resulting suspension on the objective table of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Capture series of TEM photos at 200 kV acceleration voltage and 0.24 nm resolution.\nUse the provided software to calculate the mean diameter and particle size distribution in TEM micrographs.\nDecontaminate endotoxins\n\t\nAutoclave 50 g of particles for 15 min at 121 °C and 15 psi.\nDetect endotoxins by a quantitative Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Assay (<0.25% EU/mL was considered to indicate endotoxin absence)5.\nResuspend the particles in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 50 mg/mL as stock solution6.\n2. Construction of the Calvarial Osteolysis Model\nAnesthetize 6 week old C57BL/J6 mice (six mice per group) withpentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Use the pinch test to assess the level of anesthesia. Prevent drying of eyes with normal saline.\nPlace mice in the prone position. Remove the fur on the cranium with a shaver and disinfect the skin using medical cotton balls containing 75% ethanol.\nFor point localization, identify two points, including the midpoints between the two eyes and ears, respectively. Then, determine the line between the two above points, and incise the skin along the above line with scissors (Figure 1A).",
    "Remove the cranial periosteum from the calvaria with a scalpel (Figure 1B)6.\nSuture skin at both ends with simple interrupted suture.\nMake a suture line through the middle of the incision without knotting. Hold the two ends of the suture line.\nEmbed 50 µL of CoCrMo particle suspension (50 mg/mL, in PBS) in the middle of the calvarias (Figure 1C)2.\nKnot the last stitch within simple interrupted suture (Figure 1D).\nMaintain mice for another 2 weeks.\n3. Evaluation of Calvarial Osteolysis Model by Micro-CT Scanning\nSacrifice the mice with carbon dioxide. Decapitate the mice in the horizontal plane. Remove the brain tissue inside, and the skin and fur outside. Harvest the calvarias for further experiments.\nGently clear up all the soft tissue on the calvaria with tweezers. Fix the cleared calvarias in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 24 h. Immerse the calvarias in PBS 24 h before micro-CT scanning.\nAnalyze the mice calvarias by high-resolution micro-CT at an isometric resolution of 18 µm and X-ray energy settings of 45 kV and 550 mA.\nConduct three-dimensional reconstruction of micro-CT data with the software.\nQualitative and quantitative analysis.\n\t\nFirst, select the square region around the midline suture as the region of interest.\nSecondly, measure bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation/spacing (Tb.Sp), and percentage of total porosity with the provided software for micro-CT.\nThirdly, compare the three groups for various measurements by one-way ANOVA. For post hoc analysis of variance, apply the Bonferroni method2.\n4. Evaluation of Calvarial Osteolysis Model by H&E Staining\nDecalcify calvaria samples in 15% ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-PBS at 4 °C. Change the decalcification solution every day for 3 weeks.",
    "Embed the decalcified samples in paraffin for a 2 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm cube, and slice them into 2 µm sections in the area of particle deposition.\nStain the sections with hematoxylin and eosin as previously described7.\nCapture micrographs of the overall pathomorphism by light microscopy.\nSubscription Required.
