    "The use of lipoaspirate and abdominoplasty samples has been approved by The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Rutgers University — Newark Campus.\n1. Preparation of Tissue Culture Media\nSterilely prepare 500 mL of tissue culture media prior to isolating ASCs. To prepare the culture media, add 10% defined fetal calf serum (FCS) and Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/100 mL) to Dulbecco's minimal essential media (DMEM) with high glucose and 2 mM L-glutamine. The media can be stored at 4 °C for up to 3 weeks and should always be used warm (between room temperature to 37 °C).\n\t\nIf a different media is preferred for culture of the stem cells, prepare that media instead.\n2. Isolation of ASCs from Adipose Tissue\nObtain lipoaspirates or abdominoplasty sample(s). Following IRB approval, obtain such samples as discard tissue following various surgical procedures. Transport the lipoaspirates to the laboratory in whichever vessel the surgeon removed the tissue; transport abdominoplasty samples in an operating room specimen bag or container.\nStore the sample(s) at room temperature for up to 6 h or at 4 °C for up to 24 h if not processing immediately. Tissue samples processed beyond the aforementioned times will likely have a diminished cell yield. Keep abdominoplasty samples moist by the addition of 1x sterile phosphate buffered saline.\nFrom this point onwards, conduct all steps in a laminar flow hood under aseptic conditions. Wear gloves for personal protection. Keep 10% bleach, 70% ethanol, and paper towels nearby to quickly clean up any biological spills. Disposed of any excess tissue as biomedical waste.",
    "Mince the samples into < 1 mm pieces. If the abdominoplasty block is too large to work with, cut a manageable size of tissue off of the block prior to mincing. Transfer the abdominoplasty tissue to the lid of a sterile 100 mm plate. Use a sterile needle to hold a piece of tissue in place and use a sterile scalpel to mince the pieces off by either cutting or gently shredding off of the bulk tissue.\n\t\nThis step is generally not needed for lipoaspirates. However, if large tissue chunks are observed in the lipoaspirate, remove such chunks with sterile forceps and process as above.\nTransfer the tissue to a fresh tube and invert or shake the sample 5–6 times to ensure mixing of all layers. Optional: if the lipoaspirate has fully settled, remove and discard the oil layer prior to mixing.\nTransfer 2.5–5 mL of tissue to a 100 mm vacuum-gas plasma treated tissue culture plate (Table of Materials). Measure the volume of the sample by pouring into a fresh centrifuge tube. If necessary, use a sterile spatula to assist with transferring the tissue.\nAdd an equivalent volume of tissue culture media to the plate. Gently swirl the plate to mix the contents.\nIncubate the pates at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until a sufficient number of cells are seen on the base of the plate. Over time, the cells will migrate from within the tissue onto the plate surface, at which point they will adhere to the plastic. As they exit the tissue, the cells will appear as small clusters around the tissue pieces.\nEvery 24 h, remove as much fluid as possible and replace with a similar amount of media. Leave the pieces of tissue in place, if possible.",
    "Once a sufficient number of cells are noted on the plate (>10 clusters of > 15–25 cells on the plate) or after 7 days, whichever is sooner, remove all remaining pieces of tissue.\nCulture the ASCs in tissue culture media until they reach 70% confluency or until the clusters become dense (>5 dense clusters of cells on the plate, each with a diameter of approximately > 500 μm), at which point the cells are to be passaged.\n3 Culture of ASCs\nPassage the ASCs when the parent plate reaches approximately 70% confluency. Take care to avoid over confluency of the ASC cultures.\nGently rinse the plate with 1x phosphate buffered saline and trypsinize the adherent cells. To trypsinize the cells, aspirate the phosphate buffered saline and add 1 mL of Trypsin with 0.25% EDTA to each plate and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. After 5 min, confirm de-adherence by microscopy. If the cells are still adherent, return the cells to the incubator for an additional 5 min.\nAdd a small amount of media (approximately 25% of total trypsin volume) to the plate to deactivate the trypsin, and gently wash the base of the plate using the media/trypsin. To wash the plate, hold the plate at a slight angle and gently pipette the media/trypsin from the top of the plate downwards, loosening any weekly attached cells from the plate. The cells can be re-plated at a 1:3 ratio or seeded at a density of 120,000–500,000 cells per plate.",
    "If seeding based on cell count, transfer the trypsin/media from the plate into a conical centrifuge tube, and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 7 min. Resuspend the cells in tissue culture media (approximately 1 mL per initial plate) and count the cells prior to seeding. To count the cells, transfer 10 μL of the cell suspension into the hemocytometer and count the cells present in the 4 x 4 quadrant at each corner of the grid. Average these values together and multiply the value by 104 to calculate the cell number.\nAdd media to the plate prior to seeding the cells. Add the cells in a dropwise manner and then swirl the plate to ensure even distribution across the plate.\n\t\tNOTE: After 3 passages, the adherent cells should appear asymmetrical and spindle shaped. ASC phenotype and behavior can be confirmed using flow cytometry and differentiation assays.\nConfirmation of ASC phenotype and behavior using flow cytometry and differentiation assays\n\t\nFlow cytometry\n\t\t\nCollect and pellet the cells as described above. Wash the pelleted with 1x phosphate buffered saline and label the cells with the manufacturer recommended volumes of antibody. A detailed protocol for flow cytometry, a common laboratory procedure, can be found here12,14,15.\nSelect surface marker panels from the following to confirm the ASC phenotype: negative for CD14, CD31, CD34, CD45, and CD106; and positive for CD29, CD36, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD10516,17,18,19. The presence of CD36 and absence of CD106 discern ASCs from bone marrow-derived MSCs20.\nDifferentiation Assays: Confirm multilineage differentiation using an MSC differentiation kit. Kits are available from multiple manufacturers to confirm adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation capacity. Change the kit-provided media every 3–4 days as per the manufacturer's protocols for 3 weeks or until morphological differentiation is observed.",
    "Culture the cells for multiple passages; the number of passages needed will depend on the application(s). At each passage, confirm the MSC cell morphology and phenotype using the aforementioned cell surface markers, and ensure multilineage differentiation capacity has not been lost. While the expansion potential differs among donors, most samples can be expanded for up to 6-9 passages.\nCryopreserve the cells and store in liquid nitrogen for future use.\n4 Cryopreservation of ASCs\nPrepare 10 mL of freezing solutions A and B.\n\t\nFor freezing solution A, add 20% FCS to DMEM with high glucose.\nFor freezing solution B, add 20% FCS and 20% dimethyl sulfide (DMSO) to DMEM with high glucose.\nPellet the cells by centrifuging at 300 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in a small volume of freezing solution A and count the cells using a hemocytometer as in step 3.3.1.\nCalculate the final volume that the cells will be resuspended in to reach a final cell concentration of 500,000–1,000,000 cells/mL. Use freezing solution A to resuspend the pellet in 50% of that final volume. Slowly add an equal volume of freezing solution B dropwise while agitating the tube to reach the final cell concentration.\nImmediately freeze the cells in 1–2 mL cryovials. Freeze the cryovials in a controlled rate freezer or in a freezing container placed at -80 °C, which decreases the temperature by 1 °C/min. Following the controlled freeze (overnight for a freezing container), transfer the cells to liquid nitrogen for long term storage."
