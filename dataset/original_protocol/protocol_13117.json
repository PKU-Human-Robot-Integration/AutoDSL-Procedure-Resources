    "1. Experimental design and plant cultivation\nNOTE: Set up the experiment depending on the experimental hypothesis, e.g., using a large-scale GWAS population decreases the necessity of multiple replicates, as statistical testing will be performed based on the haplotypes of all the individual SNPs instead of the accession. In contrast, multiple replicates are indispensable in other experimental approaches. The following points must be considered while preparing the experiment.\nInclude enough biological replicates, depending on the experimental hypothesis.\nRandomize the biological replicates block-wise to reduce local environmental bias during cultivation, e.g., greenhouse, field.\nEnsure proper maintenance of the plant during growth. Treat plants homogeneously to reduce bias.\n2. Preparation of biological plant material\nHarvest preparation\n\t\nLabel harvesting tubes (20 mL) containing two 5 mm and two 8 mm diameter metal beads for homogenizing. Fill up a dewar with liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: Plants should be in the vegetative stage for fresh leaf and root tissue harvesting.\nHarvest biological samples by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Harvest as quickly as possible to exclude the influence of circadian oscillation on metabolism during prolonged harvesting durations12,13. Store the harvested fresh leaf and root tissues for further processing at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Leaf-cutting to flash-freezing should not take longer than a few seconds as after leaf cleavage, active biological processes would alter metabolic profiles due to wounding. For roots, preclean the roots by washing with water before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Excess water on the root surface should be soaked up with paper tissue. Dried seeds can be stored at room temperature; no freezing in liquid nitrogen is required.\nGrind the tissue using a tissue mixer mill.\n\t\nPrecool the tube holders in liquid nitrogen for a couple of minutes to maintain a low temperature while grinding the tissue.",
    "Transport the biological samples in a nitrogen-containing dewar after taking them out from the -80 °C freezer.\nGrind the tissues to obtain homogeneous powder; use 25 Hz for 1 min and repeat after freezing in liquid nitrogen if the tissue is not homogeneously ground.\nFor grinding dried seeds, place the seeds in a grinding jar with a 15 mm diameter metal bead. Use the same frequency and time as mentioned in 2.3.3.\n\tNOTE: Clean and precooled mortars and pestles can be used if a tissue mixer mill is unavailable.\nPrecool labeled 2 mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tubes. Weigh 50 mg with an error of ±5 mg of fresh plant material by using an analytical scale. Precool the tools used for transferring plant material in liquid nitrogen. Ensure that plant material stays frozen during the weighing process.\n\tNOTE: Do not expose fresh plant material too long to room temperature as biological processes are activated by increasing temperature, altering metabolic profiles14.\nGenerate additional quality control (QC) samples by pooling a proportion of each sample and weighing 50 mg with an error of ±5 mg of pooled fresh plant material into precooled 2 mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tubes.\n\tNOTE: At least three QC samples are advised for every 60 samples. The QC samples are essential for the downstream correction, normalization, and analyses.\n3. Extraction reagents\nFresh tissue, e.g., leaves and roots\n\tNOTE: Sample extraction is based on a previously described protocol15. This protocol has been modified based on present needs, e.g., multiple tissues, different internal standards, and large-scale experiments. Additionally, all volumes and instrument settings mentioned below are adjusted to in-house analytical units. Protocol users should adjust these according to their analytical unit and biological samples, based on test samples.\n\t\nExtraction mixture 1 (EM1): methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/methanol (MeOH) (3:1 v/v)",
    "Prepare a mixture of MTBE/MeOH in a 3:1 ratio.

As 1 mL of EM1 is needed for each sample, prepare a stock solution according to the experimental sample size, which should be used for the entire experiment. EM1 must be stored at -20 °C. Check for the absence of the used internal standard and overlapping with other compounds in the investigated species. Several standards can be used; the selection of the internal standards in this protocol was based on previous tests using common bean extracts16.\nExtraction mixture 2 (EM2) water/ methanol (MeOH) (3:1 v/v)\n\t\t\nFor 100 mL EM2, add 75 mL of double-distilled water and 25 mL of MeOH in a clean glass bottle.\nAdd 500 µL of EM2 per sample, and prepare a stock solution according to the experimental sample size, which should be used for the entire experiment. Store EM2 at 4 °C.\nDried seeds\n\t\nExtraction mixture 3 (EM3) methanol (MeOH)/ water (7:3 v/v)\n\t\t\nFor 100 mL of EM3, add 70 mL of MeOH and 30 mL of double-distilled water in a clean glass bottle. Prepare 1 mL of EM3 for each sample.",

Perform extraction step 4.1 for dried seed lipid analysis.\n5. Analysis of lipids using UHPLC-MS\nRe-suspend the dried lipid fractions in 250 µL of acetonitrile:2-propanol (7:3, vol/vol).\nSonicate the lipid phase for 5 min, centrifuge at 11,200 × g for 1 min.\nTransfer 90 µL of the supernatant to a glass vial for LC-MS.\nInject 2 µL of the extracts into the LC-MS.\nPerform lipid fractionation on a reversed-phase C8 column held at 60 °C running with a flow of 400 µL/min with gradual changes of eluent A and B as shown in Table 1.

Acquire the mass spectra in a mass range of 100-1,500 m/z in a full MS scan and all ion fragmentation (AIF) induced by high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) of 40 keV.\n\tNOTE: Use both ionization modes. However, due to limited capacity while running large numbers of samples, run test samples in both ionization modes to determine the preferred ionization mode.\nInclude several QC samples in all daily batches and a blank to ensure correction for analytical variation. Randomize samples block-wise in sequential order.\nRun a pooled QC in data-dependent MS2 in both negative and positive ionization modes. Use the obtained mass spectra in a later step (8.5) for annotation.\n7. Analysis of derivatized Metabolites using GC-MS17,18\nNOTE: The analysis of derivatized metabolites is based on a previously described protocol17. Handle all derivatization reagents in the fume hood. Ensure that N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide (MSTFA) does not get in contact with water and humidity.\nDerivatization reagent 1 (DR1)\n\t\nDissolve methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine to obtain a concentration of 30 mg/mL of DR1.

Randomize samples properly block-wise in sequential order.\n8. Chromatogram processing and compound annotation",
    "Filter chemical noise by defining intensity thresholds. Include all QC samples while processing the chromatograms.\n\tNOTE: For large-scale data, noise filtering is crucial to decrease computing time and processing power.\nAlign the chromatograms by defining a retention time shift window. Check the chromatograms from each batch to assess the intra- and inter-batch variation.\nPerform peak detection depending on the peak shape, e.g., height and width for full width at half-maximum (FWHM) calculations.\nCluster isotopes to reduce redundant signals and filter out singletons.\n\tNOTE: See the Table of Materials for details on software used for chromatogram processing. In-depth protocols on how to process chromatograms using various freely available software tools, e.g., MS-DIAL, MetAlign, MzMine, and Xcalibur19,20,21, are provided.\nUse the ddMS2 data of a pooled QC sample for compound annotation. Assess the molecular structure by determining the monoisotopic mass and observing common neutral losses, known charged aglycones, and different types of cleavages, e.g., homolytic or heterolytic16,22.\nFor reporting metabolite data, follow the recommendation described in Fernie et al. 201123.\n\tNOTE: Different computational metabolomics approaches can be used to analyze metabolomics data24,25,26.\n9. Normalization of large-scale metabolomics dataset\nCheck the distribution of the internal standard(s) and normalize by correcting for the response of single or multiple internal standards.\nCorrect the peak intensities obtained from the chromatogram over the exact sample weight by dividing the peak intensities by the aliquoted homogenized sample weight from step 2.5.\nCorrect for intensity drift across multi-batch series. Perform QC-based correction methods such as locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS)27 using R.\n\tNOTE: Several tools and packages are available to address the drift of the MS performance during the acquisition of the whole batches28,29.\nEnsure normal distribution of traits by data transformation, e.g., Box-Cox transformation30 using the boxcox () function from the R package MASS for carrying out GWAS.",
    "Perform data scaling, e.g., Pareto scaling, for multivariate analysis to ensure proper weighing of low abundant compounds31.\n\tNOTE: If possible, perform a recovery assay to avoid matrix effects, e.g., ion suppression14.\n10. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)32\nCall single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or structural variants (SV) from the sequencing data33,34.\nFilter genotypic data for minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5% and missing rate of >10% to avoid low-frequency bias using Tassel35.\nCalculate best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) for each normalized feature over the experimental repetitions to eliminate bias originating from environmental factors (random effects) using the R package Ime436.\nUse BLUPs of each feature individually to perform GWAS using the rMVP package in R37.\n\tNOTE: Each metabolomics feature is viewed here as an individual stand-alone phenotype.\nWhile performing GWAS, correct for population structure using principal component analysis (PCA) and identity by state (IBS) or vanRaden to minimize confounding effects. Furthermore, consider using a mixed linear model (MLM) or a multi-locus mixed model (MLMM), as mixed models contain fixed and random effects.\n11. QTL detection\nCheck the SNPs showing significant association, taking the Manhattan plots into consideration, for linkage disequilibrium (LD) calculations to determine the underlying genetic region. Perform LD calculations using the R package LD heatmap or Tassel 5.\nCheck the associated SNPs for the effect size over the trait by examining the trait levels for statistical changes between haplotypes to find potential causal SNPs, e.g., SNPs leading to an amino acid change in the protein-coding sequence, which could explain the phenotypic variation.",
    "NOTE: As SNP-trait associations do not necessarily yield causal association, it is crucial to determine the genomic region. Compound identity by feature annotation can help immensely in finding the right candidate genes in a specific genomic region. We suggest to combine all detected QTL associated with certain compounds in a pleiotropic map to underline the genetic regions38, as shown in Figure 4. For validation of candidate genes, several approaches can be performed (see the discussion)."
