    "1. Cultivation and preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells for vitrification\nPrepare liquid growth medium for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\t\nAutoclave a 500 mL glass bottle for the preparation of growth medium.\nWeigh 2.2 g of yeast extract (1.1%) and 4.4 g of Peptone (2.2%) and mix in 200 mL of water.\nSterilize by autoclaving for 15 min at 121 °C.\nWeigh 10 g of glucose powder and mix in 50 mL of water to get 20% glucose solution. Pass the solution through a 0.2 µm filter and store it at 4 °C.\nPrepare solid medium for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\t\nWeigh 4 g of agar powder and mix with 200 mL of growth medium.\nSterilize in an autoclave for 15 min at 121 °C.\nCool the medium to 40-50 °C and add 20 mL of 20% sterile glucose (prepared in the previous step). Pour ~20 mL of the complete medium into the Petri dish and let it solidify at ambient temperature.\nWrap the agar plates in parafilm to protect from drying and store at 4 °C.\nCulture Saccharomyces cerevisiae in suspension\n\tNOTE: The protocol is optimized for the preparation of a sample for cryo-FIBM from a suspension of the cell line Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4741 [ATCC 4040002] or similar strains.\n\t\nAutoclave a 50 mL Erlenmeyer (or similar) flask.\nWork in a hood or laminar flow box. Pipette 10 mL of the growth medium to a sterile 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nSupplement the medium with 1 mL of filtered 20% glucose. Pick one colony of yeast from an agar plate with a sterile, disposable inoculation loop (1-10 μL).\nPlace the Erlenmeyer flask in the incubator and culture at 30 °C with agitation (150-200 rpm) until the exponential phase is reached (approximately 7 h).",
    "NOTE: We have observed that the exponential phase is reached after ~15 h when colonies are picked from agar plates that have been cultured at ambient temperature for 4 weeks. See also Note below.\nCulture Saccharomyces cerevisiae on an agar plate from glycerol stock.\n\t\nUse a new agar plate from the 4 °C storage.\nTake the S. cerevisiae stock from the -80 °C deep freezer and place it into a freezing stand to avoid complete thawing of the stock.\nScrape off and transfer a small culture with a sterile inoculation loop (1-10 μL) to 50 μL of growth medium. Mix properly.\nTransfer the whole volume of mixed S. cerevisiae culture and disperse with a sterile spreading stick over the surface of the agar plate.\nIncubate at 30 °C for approximately 48 hours until 1.5-2 mm diameter colonies are formed.\n\t\tNOTE: It is advisable to culture the colonies freshly before the experiment. Colonies older than 1 week will require a prolonged period for cultivation in liquid media to reach the exponential growth phase.\nCulture Saccharomyces cerevisiae on an agar plate.\n\t\nUse prepared agar plates with grown S. cerevisiae colonies.\nPipette 10 mL of sterile growth medium and 1 mL of filtered 20% glucose to a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nPick one colony of S. cerevisiae culture with a sterile inoculation loop and mix with a growth medium in a flask.\nIncubate 50 minutes at 30 °C with agitation (150-200 rpm).\nDilute the suspension culture ten times with the growth medium and disperse 50 μL of suspension on an agar plate with a sterile spreading stick.\nIncubate at 30 °C for approximately 48 hours until 1.5-2 mm colonies are observed.",
    "Wrap the edges of the Petri dish with parafilm to prevent it from drying. Store at room temperature and use for a maximum of 4 weeks.\nPrepare Saccharomyces cerevisiae for plunge freezing in cell clusters.\n\t\nPrepare the S. cerevisiae cell culture according to the protocol in the section Cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in suspension (Section 1.3) and incubate ~7 h at 30 °C with agitation (150-200 rpm).\nMeasure the OD of S. cerevisiae cell suspension culture at 600 nm using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer.\nConcentrate the cell suspension to OD600 = 1.\nPrepare S. cerevisiae for plunge freezing in a cell monolayer.\n\t\nPrepare S. cerevisiae cell culture according to the protocol in the section Cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suspension cell culture and incubate ~7 h at 30 °C with agitation (150-200 rpm).\nMeasure the OD of S. cerevisiae cell suspension culture at 600 nm using an UV/Vis spectrophotometer.\nTransfer the cells in medium to the centrifuge tube and gently spin for 2 minutes at a relative centrifugal force (900 x g).\nDiscard the medium from the cell pellet by pipetting.\nAdd fresh medium to the cell pellet. Calculate the volume of medium to get a cell suspension of OD600 equaling 30 to 60.\nAdd glycerol (50% stock solution) to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 5% shortly before vitrification.\n\t\tNOTE: Glycerol works as a protective agent, which improves the quality of the ice in the regions between the cells. Glycerol is added to cells only shortly before vitrification to minimize its uptake into the cell.\n2. Vitrification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae specimen\nGlow discharge TEM grids with the carbon film side facing up for 30-45 s (pressure: 6-9 Pa, current: 7 mA).",
    "Set the vitrification robot to the following parameters: temperature: 18 °C, humidity: 100%, blot time: 6 s, wait time: 5 s, blotting cycle: 1x, and blot force: 5.\n\tNOTE: Blot force is an instrument-specific value and optimal blot force values may differ among different machines. The optimal value for a particular plunger must be experimentally confirmed.\nPrepare liquid ethane for vitrification.\nMount the non-absorbent surface pad to the blotting pad facing the sample. Use the filter paper for the other blotting pad.\nPick the glow discharged grid with the tweezers and mount the tweezers to the plunge freezing instrument.\nApply 3.5 μL of S. cerevisiae suspension to the carbon side of the grid inside the plunger climate chamber. Mix properly before every application on the grid.\nPlunge freeze the grid into the liquid ethane.\nTransfer the grid from liquid ethane to LN2. Store grids with vitrified cells under LN2 conditions or mount them into the TEM grid cartridge for loading into the FIB-SEM microscope.\n3. Mounting TEM grids into the grid cartridge\nNOTE: The workflow described here utilizes the TEM grids mounted into the grid cartridge to facilitate sample handling and transfer between SEM and TEM microscopes. The cartridge assembly consists of a C-ring, a TEM grid, and a C-clip ring. Other options are available when working with instrumentation from other microscope manufacturers. The grid cartridge assembly workstation is filled with LN2. The LN2 level covers the grid box with the TEM grids, but the mounting of the TEM grids into the cartridge is performed in LN2 vapors. It is highly recommended to wear a protective facemask or shield during the vitrification procedure to prevent contamination from breathing to the specimen. Do not work with the tools that have accumulated ice contamination.",
    "Put the grid cartridge assembly workstation together and prepare dry tools for clipping.\nCool the assembly workstation down with LN2. Cool the clipping tools to the LN2 temperature.\nPlace a grid box with a vitrified sample into the assembly workstation.\nPlace a TEM grid with the specimen with cells facing down to the C-ring and secure with a C-clip.\nPlace the clipped cartridges into the grid box and close properly.\nStore cartridges in the LN2 Dewar or load them into the FIB-SEM microscope.\n4. Loading and manipulation of the sample to the FIB-SEM microscope\nNOTE: The instructions were written for the utilization of the dual-beam microscope Versa 3D equipped with the PP3010 cryo-FIB/SEM preparation system. Alternative solutions may require different specific parameters; however, the general concept of the workflow should be still valid.\nCool the microscope down to the liquid nitrogen temperature.\n\t\nPump the microscope chamber and preparation chamber (if present) to a high vacuum before the start of cooling down (< 4 x 10-4 Pa) to prevent contamination growth.\nSet the nitrogen gas flow to 5 L/min for the preparation chamber, microscope stage, and microscope anticontaminator. Wait until all components reach a temperature of < -180 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The FIB-SEM microscope setup used in this study utilizes cooled nitrogen gas to cool down its stage and anticontaminator. Other systems may use a different method for stage cooling. The chamber pressure reaches ~3 x 10-5 Pa once the stage and anticontaminator are at -190 °C on the instrument used here. The growth rate of the hydrocarbon contaminating layer on the surface of the lamella with the experimental setup used in this study is ~15 nm/hour.\nLoad the grid cartridge with the specimen to the microscope.\n\t\nAssemble and cool the loading station to the LN2 temperature.",
    "Place the shuttle (sample holder), the grid box with the specimen, the grid box opener, and tweezers into the cooled loading station.\nCarefully transfer the grid cartridge with the specimen facing up into the shuttle.\nFlip the shuttle inside of the loading station to the loading position.\nLoad into the microscope.\nOptionally, coat the specimen with metal protective layers.\n\tNOTE: A strong charging effect can be observed when imaging frozen hydrated biological material SEM. In addition, imaging biological samples with FIB (even at low currents) induces fast sample damage. Therefore, an additional coating of the sample might performed inside the FIB-SEM microscope, to protect the specimen surface.\n\t\nDeposit the protective layer with organometallic platinum by the gas injection system (GIS).\n\t\t\nSet the sample to the eucentric height (coincidence point for imaging with electrons and ions).\nTilt the stage back to 45° (sample tilted 90° relative to electron beam).\nMove the stage in the z-axis 4 mm below the eucentric height.\nSet the GIS needle to 26–30 °C.\nDeposit ~300-1000 nm of the organometallic platinum layer to the grid with the biological specimen (corresponds to 30–120 s of the GIS deposition).\n\t\t\tNOTE: We usually apply GIS for 30 s for samples with small cellular clusters and 45 s for samples with a monolayer of the cells.\nSputter coat the specimen surface with a conductive metal layer.\n\t\t\nDeposit ~10 nm of the metal layer (Ir, Au, Pt) to the grid with a biological specimen.\nSet microscope parameters for the lamella preparation\n\t\nFor FIB, use the following parameters: high voltage = 30 kV, current = 10 pA (imaging), 10 pA–3 nA (FIB-milling)\nFor SEM, use the following parameters: high voltage = 2–5 kV, spot size = 4.5, current = 8–27 pA.\nSet the scan rotation to 180° for both beams.",
    "Set the stage tilt: milling angle 6-11° (corresponds to stage tilt of 13°–18° for the sample shuttle with pre-tilt of 45° and FIB/SEM microscope with 52° angle between SEM and FIB column).\n5. Preparation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae lamella\nCheck the grid quality and select a suitable cluster of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\t\nCheck that the TEM grid is properly blotted from both sides without additional water around the cell cluster or at the back side of the grid.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to check the backside of the grid, rotate the stage to -10° and image the grid with FIB.\nSelect the optimal cell clusters for lamella preparation according to the following recommendations.\n\t\t\nPosition the cell clusters in the grid center. The milling area should not extend outside of the square with dimensions 1100 x 1100 μm positioned in the center of the grid (550 μm in each direction from the grid center).\nPosition the cell clusters in the central part of the grid square with no overlap to the grid bar.\nPosition the cell clusters in the grid square with compact holey carbon foil without cracks.\nEnsure that the cluster is not surrounded by ice contamination.\nSelect the optimal milling position in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae monolayer.\n\t\nEnsure that the grid bars surrounding the cell monolayer on the selected grid square are visible.\nSelect the optimal position in the cellular monolayer according to the following recommendations. The selected areas for milling should satisfy the following criteria:\n\t\t\nHave the region of interest in the grid center. The milling area should not extend outside the square of dimensions 1100 x 1100 μm positioned in the grid center (550 μm in each direction from the center of the grid).",
    "Have the region of interest in the central part of the grid square with no overlap with the grid bar.\nDo not surround the cell monolayer with ice contamination.\nPrepare S. cerevisiae lamella with cryo-FIB.\n\tNOTE: The milling pattern is generated and centered relative to the region of interest. Cryo-FIBM is performed sequentially with multiple milling steps performed at different FIB settings. The lamella with roughly 2 μm thickness is initially milled using high current (0.3–3 nA). The lamella is then gradually thinned to 500 nm. The fine-milling step at low currents (10-30 pA) is used to finalize the lamella to ~100–200 nm thickness.\n\t\nSet a region of interest (ROI) to the eucentric height and save this position.\n\t\tNOTE: The coincidence point needs to be determined and saved for every position separately. The eucentric height is set by tilting the stage to 0° and centering on the ROI by moving the stage in the x and y direction. The stage is then tilted to 25° and the ROI is brought back to the center of the scanned area by changing the stage z-axis position. Finally, the stage is tilted back to 13°–18° for milling.\nDefine a rectangular milling pattern above the ROI with a scan direction of Top to Bottom.\nDefine a rectangular milling pattern below the ROI with a scan direction of Bottom to Top.\nDefine the inactive rectangular milling pattern covering the region of interest for a rough estimation of the lamella thickness. This pattern is not milled during lamella preparation.\nMark all patterns and set the lamella width (x dimension). The width of the milling pattern should not exceed 2/3 of the cluster width. This corresponds to 8–15 μm in most cases.\nSet parameters for rough milling steps",
    "FIB current: 0.3–3.0 nA ; final lamella thickness: 1.5–2 μm; width of the FIBM area: 8-12 um; stage-tilt: 13-17°; duration: 8 minutes; active milling patterns: upper and lower.\nFIB current: 0.3–1.0 nA; final lamella thickness: 1 μm; width of the FIBM area: 7.5-11.5 μm; stage-tilt: 13-17°; duration: 8 minutes; active milling patterns: upper and lower.\nFIB current: 100–300 pA; final lamella thickness: 0.5 μm ; width of the FIBM area: 7.5-11.5 μm; stage-tilt: 13-17°; duration: 8 minutes; active milling patterns: upper and lower.\nFIB current: 30–100 pA; final lamella thickness: 0.3 μm ; width of the FIBM area: 7.5-11.5 μm; stage-tilt: 13-17°; duration: 8 minutes; active milling patterns: upper and lower.\nSet parameters for the fine milling step:\n\t\t\nFIB current: 10–30 pA; final lamella thickness: <0.2 um; width of the FIBM area: 7-11 μm; stage-tilt: 13-17° (+1°); duration: 12 minutes; active milling patterns: upper.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The rough milling steps (5.3.6) are carried out sequentially for each lamella. In contrast, the fine milling step (5.3.7) does not directly follow the rough milling, but fine milling steps are carried out sequentially for all the lamellae at the end of the session to minimize the hydrocarbon contamination on the lamella surface. An extra +1° stage tilt is used during fine milling step to increase the uniformity of the lamella thickness across its length.\n6. Transfer of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lamella to cryo-TEM\nPrepare a properly dried Dewar and fill it with LN2.\nUnload the samples with lamellae from the FIB/SEM microscope under cryo-conditions, transfer them to a grid box, and store them in a LN2 storage Dewar for long-term storage. Alternatively, load the grids directly into cryo-TEM.",
    "Correct orientation of the lamella relative to the cryo-TEM stage tilt axis is important (see accompanying video at 8:10 for more details). Ensure that the milling direction of prepared lamellae is perpendicular to the cryo-TEM stage tilt axis.\nPre-tilt the cryo-TEM stage to compensate for the lamella tilt relative to the grid plane and collect the tilt-series using dose-symmetric scheme19.\n\tNOTE: The magnitude of the pre-tilt (typically 6–8°) is determined by the angle between the TEM grid plane and the FIB direction during micromachining. The position of the lamella front edge in the image in cryo-TEM can be used to determine the sign of the pre-tilt angle. For that, the sense of the microscope stage rotation must be known. In our experimental setup, the position of the front edge of the lamella on the right side of the image taken in nanoprobe SA mode corresponds to negative pre-tilt."
