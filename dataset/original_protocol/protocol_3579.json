    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThawing the cell pellets\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThaw the cell pellets on ice. Have a small bucket of water at room temperature (~22°C) and swirl the cell pellet in it every few minutes to assist the thawing process. Expect 20 to 30 min to completely thaw the cell pellets.\nNote: Be careful toward the end of thawing the pellets. There are usually some frozen bits left in the middle of the thawed cells. Thaw them completely while ensuring the cell pellets remain cold.\nCell lysis: soluble cell lysate preparation\nTiming: 2.5 h\nThawed cells are lysed, and the cell lysate is treated with a nuclease and clarified.\nTo 25 mL of 2× lysis buffer, add 500 μL protease inhibitors for yeast (Sigma) + 200 μL of 100 mM PMSF (stock prepared in isopropanol).\nEstimate the cell pellet volume by using a 10 mL pipette. For 500 mL of cell culture, the pellet size should be between 2–3 mL.\nAdd an equal volume of ice-cold 2× lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Mix by gently pipetting up and down. The solution should become viscous due to lysed nuclei and release of chromatin.\nAdjust the total volume to 15 mL using 1× lysis buffer (dilute the 2× lysis buffer to 1× lysis buffer using ice-cold sterile ddH2O).\nAdd 10% NP-40 to a final concentration of 0.2% (e.g., 300 μL to 15 mL total lysis solution).\nKeep the lysate on ice for 10 min and check for viscosity using a wide-bore P1000 pipette tip (or cut a P1000 tip-head with a sterile razor blade before use). The solution should be viscous at this point.",
    "Add 5 μL of Benzonase (Sigma) to digest the released chromatin, genomic DNA, and RNA resulting in an enhanced solubility of chromatin-associated protein complexes.\nRotate in the cold room using a Nutator (or any other suitable rotator) for 30 min.\nDivide the cell lysate into 10 pre-chilled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (1.5 mL lysate in each tube).\nCentrifuge the lysate at 16,100 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nPool the clarified cell lysates by transferring the supernatant to 15 mL Falcon tubes (pre-chilled on ice). Pool the cell lysate by pouring the lysate from each 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube into a single 15 mL Falcon tube.\nSave 50 μL of the cell lysate in a separate Eppendorf tube as input. Flash freeze in liquid nitrogen immediately, and store at −80°C.\nNote: Many protease inhibitor cocktails include EDTA. Concentrations of higher than 1 mM EDTA will inhibit Benzonase activity.\nNote: Viscosity should be eliminated after Benzonase treatment. If samples remain difficult to manipulate, add additional Benzonase or incubate for a longer time to ensure that viscosity is eliminated.\nNote: Centrifugation of the cell lysate can also be performed in a Sorvall-type SA600 rotor @ 12,000 rpm @ 4ᵒC for 30 min followed by transfer to a fresh 15 mL pre-chilled Falcon tube.\nPause Point: The lysate can be flash-frozen after step 11 and can be kept at −80°C until further use. To preserve protein-protein interactions, add glycerol to 20% final concentration to the lysis buffer.\nAffinity purification using M2 agarose beads\nTiming: 4–5 h",
    "Affinity purification using M2 agarose beads (i.e., anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody covalently attached to agarose by hydrazide linkage) is carried out to isolate the FZZ-tagged protein (bait) and its interaction partners (prey). Take out the agarose beads and slowly warm them on ice for 10 min. Gently rotate in your hand to mix the bead slurry.\nTransfer 100 μL of the of anti-FLAG M2 agarose slurry (50 μL of packed beads) to a pre-chilled 15 mL Falcon tube per purification.\nWash with 10 mL ice-cold 1× lysis buffer by gently resuspending the beads.\nCentrifuge at 960 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant.\nRepeat the washing step 3 times.\nResuspend the beads in 50 μL of 1× lysis buffer (final volume will be 100 μL).\nTransfer the pooled supernatant from step 11 to the 15 mL Falcon tube containing M2 agarose beads.\nIncubate for 2 h at 4°C with end-to-end rotation.",
    "Note: Alternatively, immunomagnetic beads can be used. Transfer 100 μL protein G Dynabeads per purification to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. These beads are uniform 2.8 μm superparamagnetic beads with recombinant Protein G covalently coupled to the surface. Separate Dynabeads using a magnetic rack (~15–30 s). Remove the supernatant. Resuspend the beads in 1 mL 1× lysis buffer, put back on the magnetic rack, and remove the supernatant again. Repeat this step 3 times and finally resuspend the Dynabeads in 100 μL 1× lysis buffer. Add 5 μg of anti-FLAG antibody to 100 μL of protein G Dynabeads and rotate at room temperature (~22°C) for 1 h or overnight at 4°C. After incubation, magnetically separate the beads. Remove the supernatant and wash 3 times with 1 mL 1× lysis buffer. Resuspend in 100 μL 1× lysis buffer and transfer to the pooled supernatant from step 11. Incubate for 2–4 h at 4°C with end-to-end rotation.\nWe have tested this protocol using both anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies. Validated antibodies against endogenous proteins can also be used with this protocol. For the FZZ or FLAG tagged proteins, ANTI-FLAG M2 Magnetic Beads can also be used. In this case, omit the antibody-Protein G beads conjugation step. Wash 100 μL M2 magnetic beads 3 times with 1× lysis buffer, resuspend in 100 μL 1× lysis buffer and add to the pooled supernatant from step 11. Incubate at 4°C with end-to-end rotation\nNote: In addition to using untagged cells, a negative control without antibodies should be used if the purifications are being carried out using a specific antibody against endogenous protein.",
    "Note: For agarose beads, always cut the end of the pipette tip using a sterile razor blade prior to pipetting the beads to minimize shearing of the beads. Alternatively, wide-bore tips can be used to handle agarose beads.\nWashing and elution of the affinity purified proteins\nTiming: 1.5 h\nElution of FZZ-tagged proteins (or alternative epitope tags, e.g., GFP) and associated interactions partners can be performed either with Laemmli buffer or ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). Prepare and pre-chill the following buffers: IPP300, IPP100 with NP-40, IPP100 without NP-40.\nWash the beads once with high-salt IPP300 to remove any weakly bound protein contaminants. Gently resuspend the beads in 15 mL IPP300, rotate 5 min in the cold room, centrifuge for 2 min at 960 × g.\nWash the beads as above twice with 15 mL IPP100-NP-40 buffer.\nWash the beads as above twice with 15 mL IPP100 without NP-40. These washes remove the NP-40 detergent.\nAfter the last wash, resuspend the M2-agarose beads in 750 μL of CaCl2/Tris solution and transfer to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 2,700 × g at room temperature (~22°C).\nRemove the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 500 μL of 0.5 M NH4OH prepared fresh from the concentrated stock solution.\nRotate for 20 min at room temperature (~22°C).\nCentrifuge for 2 min at room temperature at 2,700 × g.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new pre-chilled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nTransfer 50 μL to a separate pre-chilled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. This will be used later in Western blotting analysis to examine the recovery of the bait.\nFlash freeze all samples in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C until further use.",
    "Note: After washing with CaCl2/Tris solution, the bead pellet often shrinks slightly. The CaCl2/Tris wash is performed to remove residual salt from the beads.\nNote: For magnetic beads, the CaCl2/Tris wash can be omitted.\nNote: For elution using Laemmli buffer, add 1× Laemmli buffer to the beads after the washing steps. Heat at 95°C using a heat block or boiling water for 5 min and remove the supernatant, which can be directly used for SDS-PAGE and associated Western blotting.\nCritical: NH4OH has a strong odor, is hazardous, and causes irritation of the skin. Handle NH4OH in a fume hood.\nWestern blotting analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nWestern blotting analysis is performed using the input (step 13) and affinity purified material (50 μL saved fraction from step 31) to confirm the recovery of bait proteins (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nLoad input and affinity purified fractions in duplicates on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.\nElectrophorese the gel and transfer the proteins to a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane according to manufacturer’s instructions or other established protocols (Mahmood and Yang, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nUse anti-FLAG antibody (1:5,000 dilution) for immunoblot analysis. The expected outcome is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nNote: Silver staining can be performed to visualize the affinity purified FZZ-tagged protein (bait) and its interaction partners (prey) (e.g., Garg et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nMass spectrometry and statistical analysis\nTiming: several days\nFor researchers without direct access to mass spectrometers, mass spectrometry services can be contracted from a facility available to the researcher, e.g., The Donnelly Mass Spectrometry Center (DMSC) (https://ccbr.utoronto.ca/donnelly-mass-spec-facility[href=https://ccbr.utoronto.ca/donnelly-mass-spec-facility]) or Network Biology Collaborative Centre (https://nbcc.lunenfeld.ca/[href=https://nbcc.lunenfeld.ca/]). If such a service is employed, details for submitting samples should be arranged ahead of time with the facility.\nSpeedvac the purified samples to dryness with no heat. For ~450 μL of purified material in 0.5 M NH4OH, expect 2–3 h of drying.",
    "Resuspend the dried material in 100 μL of freshly prepared 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0.\nAdd 0.75 μg of proteomic grade dimethylated trypsin resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 at a concentration of 0.1 μg/μL and incubate at 37⁰C for ~15 h with gentle lateral mixing.\nAdd an extra 0.25 μg of proteomic grade dimethylated trypsin and incubate for an additional ~3 h at 37°C with gentle lateral mixing.\nSpeedvac the purified samples to dryness with no heat. For ~110 μL of digested material, expect 1–2 h of drying.\nPrior to mass spectrometry data acquisition, the samples are cleaned using C18 Stage-Tip (Rappsilber et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) to remove salt and detergents, contaminants that interfere with the mass spectrometry data acquisition.\nThe dried desalted peptides are now ready for mass spectrometry analysis. They should be stored at −80°C until data acquisition.\nThe mass spectrometry data acquisition and analysis will vary based on the mass spectrometer to be employed. Recently, we have employed an Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 nanoRSLC chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We find that a 60 min LC linear gradient is appropriate for the complexity of the peptide samples under analysis generated by this protocol. The resulting raw mass spectrometry files are converted to .mzML using ProteoWizard (Adusumilli and Mallick, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) and searched with Mascot (v2.3.02; Matrix Science). The spectra are searched with the RefSeq database (version 45, January 24th, 2011) acquired from NCBI against a total of 24,770 Tetrahymena thermophila sequences.",
    "To identify statistically significant interaction partners, SAINTexpress [v3.61; (Teo et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19])] is used. SAINTexpress calculates the probability value of each potential protein-protein interaction being enriched over the estimated background distribution. Default parameters should be employed in this analysis with as many controls as possible. Typically, we aim to have at least as many control replicates as samples in our SAINTexpress analyses.\nHigh-confidence interaction partners identified with SAINTexpress are those with a false discovery rate (FDR) of ≤0.01 (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/502-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overview of the optimized protocol for the identification of statistically significant protein-protein interaction in Tetrahymena thermophila\n(A) Schematic of the sample preparation and mass spectrometry acquisition and analysis.\n(B) Overview of the SAINTexpress output file showing each prey protein identified along with their average spectral count (AvgSpec), the spectral count identified for the prey protein in each control sample (Ctrl Count) and the related statistical measure of the interaction (AvgP and FDR).\n(C) Network representation of AP-MS identified interaction partners. Data are filtered using SAINTexpress against several control purifications. Interaction partners that pass the statistical threshold of FDR ≤0.01 are shown. Edge width is proportional to average spectral counts for each prey. Note: To generate this network, AP-MS data for MED31-FZZ was utilized, as reported in Garg et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nHigh-confidence interaction partners can be visualized as a protein-protein interaction network using Cytoscape (Cline et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) or as heat maps or dot plots using Prohits-viz (Knight et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nNote: To minimize contaminants observed in the LC-MS/MS analysis, “LC-MS grade” or better-quality solvents should be employed in the preparation of all buffers to be used in the digestion and clean-up of purified material.",
    "Note: SAINTexpress analyses can be performed through the crapome portal (www.crapome.org[href=http://www.crapome.org]), using a standalone version available at http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html[href=http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html], or through the ProHits LIMS software (Liu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nNote: As an alternative to SAINTexpress, users can employ the non-parametric method ComPASS (Sowa et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), which uses a normal distribution model, or simpler two sample t-test, in the Perseus software for example (Tyanova et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), to filter false positives from their raw mass spectrometry data."
