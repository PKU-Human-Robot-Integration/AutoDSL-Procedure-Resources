    "Note: Prior to starting laser microdissection, the user should be well trained in cryo-sectioning and have sufficient knowledge of microscopy and histopathology to sample the correct tissue or cells. To minimize quality damage, the whole procedure of tissue handling should be carried out quickly, yet carefully. Preparation of solutions and set-up for brain dissectionNotes: Wear sterile disposable gloves and change frequently at every step, from preparing reagents till RNA analysis etc. Use clean, RNase-free instruments. Before handling the next specimen, spray the instruments with RNaseZap, rinse with RNase-free water and wipe with clean Kimwipes. Use RNase-free or Nuclease-free solutions, glassware and plastic ware. Use RNaseZap or similar product to clean the equipment or the surface of the working area.Freeze tissues immediately after surgery to obtain high-quality RNA. This minimizes gradual RNA degradation by ubiquitous RNases or heat.Prepare working solutions, as mentioned in the Recipes section.Label the cryomolds at room temperature using the Fisherbrand permanent marker, prior to the tissue dissection experiment, preferably on the side-wall opposite to the notched side (for easier orientation).Autoclave the dissection instruments and spatula for sterilization, prior to the experiment.Note: The dissection tools should have never seen any fixative etc.; wipe them with RNaseZap, then RNase-free DNase-free water and dry with clean Kimwipes before starting the experiment. Wipe the tissue dissection area thoroughly with 100% RNaseZAP solution, let the area dry before placing the laboratory mat for dissection.Assemble all reagents and equipment before tissue dissection, as shown in Figure 1.Crush some dry-ice using the mallet to generate a soft powdered area for future placement of the embedding mold (Figure 2A).Pour OCT slowly and carefully along one edge of the sterile embedding mold till it is half-filled (Figures 2B and 2F).Note: Avoid air bubbles in the OCT while pouring. Air bubbles disrupt the tissue integrity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191228/20191228084130_8093.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Materials needed for dissection of neonatal mouse forebrain. Reagents and equipment needed for mouse brain dissection are labeled. 1x PBS–Phosphate buffer saline, working solution.Neonatal mouse brain dissectionEuthanize neonatal mouse pups of the desired age (P0-P6) using procedures permitted by your Institutional guidelines. In Roy et al. (2019), as per the approved animal protocol (see Ethics statement), euthanasia was performed by inducing hypothermia anesthesia, followed by decapitation. For this procedure, place the newborn pups on the lid of a Petri dish and set on top of crushed ice for 2-3 min, leading to their unconsciousness. Confirm anesthesia in pups by lack of response to firm toe pinch, once they stop moving. Decapitate using sharp scissors.Transfer the heads to a sterile 100 mm Petri dish containing sterile 1x PBS.At this stage, if genotyping of the pups is required, take a tiny piece of the tail (≤ 2 mm) of each pup and place them in labeled 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes for further processing.Dispose of the carcasses using labeled biohazard bags.Under a dissection microscope, dissect out the brains using fine and coarse forceps (Figure 2C). Dispose of the remaining carcasses using the biohazard bags.Note: If the Petri dish becomes murky with blood, you can transfer the brains at this stage to another Petri dish containing sterile 1x PBS. After removing the brain, sever the hindbrain and midbrain, retaining only the forebrain including the olfactory bulbs (Figures 2D-2E). The presence of the olfactory bulb helps to position the telencephalic hemisphere in the correct orientation in the embedding molds.RNase-free brain mountingWith the help of the spatula and coarse forceps (if needed), take the brain out of the buffer and transfer to the pre-labeled embedding mold half-filled with OCT (Figures 2F-2G).",
    "Note: Try to remove liquid from the brain surface as much as possible without damaging the brain (you may carefully use a finely rolled Kimwipe if needed), before immersing it in the OCT. Orient the mouse forebrain such that it is parallel to or on the floor of the embedding mold.For coronal sectioning (perpendicular to the antero-posterior axis of the forebrain), slowly orient the anterior side of the brain (olfactory bulb side) directly perpendicular to the notched side of the mold. Avoid air bubbles in the process (Figures 2G and 2K).Once the brain is properly oriented, slowly pour OCT along one edge to fill the mold (or at least enough to cover the entire brain). Take precaution that the brain orientation remains intact and air bubbles do not develop in between OCT layers.Carefully place the mold within the powdered dry ice and support the mold from the sides by pieces of dry ice (Figures 2H-2I).Once the mold, with brain embedded, becomes completely opaque (Figure 2J), transfer it to a new, clean freezer box and immediately store at -80 °C freezer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191228/20191228084154_1116.jpgFigure 2.

    "Preparation before tissue sectioningClean cryostat, microtome blade and tools with a 1:1 mixture of RNaseZap and 70% ethanol (RNaseZap/70% ethanol) and then with sterile 95% ethanol (Recipes 1-3). Wipe dry with Kimwipes.Incubate PEN membrane slides for 30 min under UV light (on the UV transilluminator) to enhance the binding of the tissue to the membrane slide.Get a bucket of dry ice for tissue/embedded mold transportation.Prepare solutions with RNase-free water and high-quality ethanol:75% ethanol (freshly prepared, Recipe 4).Nissl stain (Recipe 5, prepare at least 3 days before use and store at 4 °C). Aliquot the amount needed for current use, by roughly estimating the total number of slides to be stained (10-15 drops of the solution is adequate to rapid stain each slide).Set temperature of cryostat in the range of -15 °C to -18 °C.Label PEN slides with brain code/genotype using a pencil.Cryo-sectioning of brain tissueWear new sterile disposable RNase-free gloves. Change gloves frequently between steps to maintain the RNase-free status.Transfer an embedded brain mold, placed securely on dry ice, from -80 °C freezer to the cryostat.Use new sterile, single-edge blade to tear the plastic embedding mold inside the cryostat. Trim the OCT-embedded block as needed.For coronal staining, attach the block on the cryostat chuck (specimen clamp) such that the anterior side of the brain (notched side of mold, Figure 2K) faces perpendicular to the microtome blade inside the cryostat.Place embedded brain inside the cryostat at least 20 min prior to sectioning, in order to allow it to come to the cryostat temperature.Use a new sterile microtome blade for each experiment (Figure 3A).Slice a few sections from the surface of the mold to avoid any sort of contamination, prior to the collection of actual sections to be mounted on slides.",
    "Cut 8-10 μm sections and mount on regular charged plus slides (on the positively-charged coated side). To identify your region of interest, rapid stain with Nissl staining solution or other dye for about 1 min, swivel gently, and observe slides under stereo microscope.Note: Staining procedure is explained in Step E14b. Once you start getting sections of your region of interest, change the slicing thickness to 16-18 μm and mount on the PEN membrane slides. You can mount multiple sections on one slide. For example, ~12-14 sections were mounted on each PEN slide in Roy et al. (2019).Note: Mount the sections within the extent on the PEN-coated membrane (Figure 3B). Please take care that the coating does not get any scratches or leave the RNase-free area. Optimally, place the PEN slides on the desiccant during the section collection.Clean the blade and cryo-sectioning stage with brush or Kimwipe in between sections.Collect one section of every 5-10 sections and mount on the regular charged slide for histologic staining.Air-dry the PEN slides at room temperature for about 2 min on desiccant. Make sure the collected sections are completely dry before staining.After air-drying, PEN slides with collected sections can be:Stored in plastic slide mailer in a vacuumed bag, containing desiccant, at -80 °C, for a few months or longer, until user is ready to perform LCM.Immediately transferred to 100% ethanol at room temperature for dehydration, followed by Nissl staining.The Nissl staining protocol is as follows [a quicker staining method, modified from Grundemann et al. (2008) and Leica LMD Protocol Guide (https://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/light-microscopes/details/product/leica-lmd7/[href=https://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/light-microscopes/details/product/leica-lmd7/])]:Stain slides one at a time using 50 ml tube or simultaneously using a big container.Immerse the slides in fresh 100% ethanol, 5 min x 4 times, and place on the rocking shaker to remove any OCT attached.",
    "Immerse slides in freshly-prepared 75% ethanol (Recipe 4) for ~1 min.Place drops of Nissl stain (Recipe 5) directly onto the sections, using plastic transfer pipette, and incubate for 1 min. Swivel the slides gently. On average, 10-15 drops of the solution are adequate per slide.Quickly rinse the slides with fresh 100% ethanol, 5 s x 3 times.Finally, immerse the slides in fresh 100% ethanol for 1 min, to allow the stain to bind onto the sections.Observe sections under a brightfield dissecting microscope.Allow the slides to stand for at least 30 min in order to make them completely dry before storage or use.Note: Optimally, finish staining of sections strictly within 10 min in total.Store completely dried PEN slides with mounted sections at -80 °C, either before or after Nissl staining. Neither procedure will negatively affect the RNA quality. Keep the slides at -80 °C until you are ready to start LCM.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191228/20191228084340_2233.jpgFigure 3.

In this context, ventricular zone of P0 mouse hippocampal CA1 region (CA1 vz) was traced.Laser microdissectionNotes:All steps of laser microdissection should be performed in a designated RNase-free zone, in a clean, steady air-conditioned room. Be cautious to slowly adjust frozen slides to room temperature before laser microdissection. This is critical for RNA quality since water (moisture) activates RNases. Wipe the work area with Kimwipes dipped in RNase-free water, followed by 100% ethanol.",
    "Clean the stage, substage and UV shield of the LMD machine sequentially with 95% and 100% ethanol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191228/20191228084424_3691.jpgFigure 4. Flowchart showing different steps of laser microdissection of neonatal mouse forebrain tissue. Different steps–tissue sectioning, laser-capture microdissection, downstream applications. Some images are obtained from Roy et al. (2019), where we compared the genetic profiles of the hippocampal CA1 ventricular zone (CA1 vz) between P0 control and activating Pik3ca mutant ± drug, using RNA sequencing.Take the PEN slides (in the vacuumed bag) out of -80 °C freezer and allow it to slowly reach room temperature, for at least 60 min, before opening the bag. This is to avoid formation of water condensation on the sections. This step is critical for preserving RNA quality. Another method of drying the slide is to use the vacuum desiccator or a home-made RNase-free desiccator (Figure 3C) and dry the slides on the same day.Switch the power of the Leica LMD equipment on.Clean the collect tube caps (0.5 ml) with RNaseZap, followed by a rinse with RNase-free water.Stain the section collected on regular slide (see Step E12) to confirm the area of interest, before performing LCM on serial sections mounted on PEN slides.Alternate method: If one studying the scientific question and one executing the laser microdissection are separate personnel, working at separate places/time zones, a crude method to designate the region of interest can be followed:Image the Nissl-stained forebrain sections mounted on the regular plus slides, 1 for every 10 sections mounted on PEN slides. Copy and paste each image as a separate slide in Microsoft PowerPoint. Carefully trace the region of interest, using PowerPoint tools, as shown in Figure 3D. Using these representative tracings, successfully perform LCM on the related PEN slides having the respective serial sections.",
    "If not already done, stain sections on the PEN slides with Nissl stain, as described in the previous section, just prior to microdissection.Dry the slides post-staining, in the desiccator.Place PEN slides upside down in the stack-slide holder.Create a sample overview under 1.25x lens, using LED/halogen illumination.Mount 0.5 ml RNase-free, DNase-free collection tubes in the LMD tube holder. Add 20-40 μl of a mixture of RLT buffer and 2-mercaptoethanol to the cap of each tube (10 μl 2-mercaptoethanol in 1 ml RLT buffer from Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro Kit).Set the LMD software to Transmitted light-brightfield (TL-BF) mode.Adjust software parameters to get suitable cutting including more accurate and less damage of tissue. Software parameters used in Roy et al. (2019): Draw shapes using “close line”. Use the “Move + Cut” mode for cutting respected tissue zones/cells. Use “Fine” X-Y-Z precision mode.Guide the laser beam with mouse or touchscreen over your specific region of interest. The dissected tissue drops into the caps of collection tube by force of gravity without contamination. In Roy et al. (2019), ventricular zone of P0 hippocampal CA1 field (CA1 vz) was collected from each coronal hemisphere (Figure 4).Note: Please load a new collection tube every 2 h if longer cutting time needed. Once all sections of the first slide are laser-cut, move to the next slide and repeat Steps F9-F12. You can store the used slides for future inspection and documentation.Note: Depending on the size and density of the laser-dissected samples, you can decide whether to pool together samples obtained from each brain for RNA isolation and further processing. In Roy et al. (2019), our region of interest (ventricular zone of P0 mouse CA1 region) was both low in volume and in density. Hence, total RNA was isolated from LCM-enriched samples pooled across ~6 slides per genotype.",
    "After microdissection, carefully retrieve the collect tubes, close the cap upside down and vortex for 1 min.Give the tubes a brief spin in the centrifuge in order to collect sample at the bottom of the tube. Store tubes at -80 °C for further analysis.Note: If more than one cell type or cell population is needed from one slide, collect one type of tissue from all sections at the same time and make sure that the cut tissue had been detached from the section before starting to collect others. Load the collection tube for the next cell/tissue type in a different hole to avoid possible tissue contamination. Store unfinished PEN slides (where further LCM is possible) in the vacuum desiccator with desiccant at room temperature up to 5 days.RNA isolationPool all the collected RLT buffer (with micro-dissected samples of each cell/tissue type of each biological replicate) into a new, RNase-free 1.7 ml tube.Vortex the tubes for 30 s.Add an equal amount of 70% ethanol (RNase-free).If the total volume is > 700 μl, transfer ~700 μl mixture each time to an RNeasy MinElute spin column and repeat this step using the same column, until the entire volume of mixture is used.Follow the instruction given in the manual of RNeasy Micro Kit to isolate RNA from the LCM-ed samples.Elute the RNA with 15 μl RNase-free water contained RNase Inhibitor (1 U/μl).Repeat Step H6. If necessary, use the same tube for RNA collection.Take 2 μl RNA elution into 2-3 μl RNase-free water for NanoDrop and RNA bioanalysis.Proceed with measuring the concentration and purity of obtained RNA, as part of the data analysis.Note: You may distribute each tube/genotype/sample into 3 technical replicates for further processing (for example, RNA sequencing)."
