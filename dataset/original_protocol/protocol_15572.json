    "1. Generation of a Library of Extracellular Human Proteins\nCompile a list of cell surface receptors or secreted proteins of interest to build the protein microarray library. Specific protein families (for example, the immunoglobulin superfamily) or proteins selectively expressed in particular cell types can be selected for the study.\nFor cell surface receptors, determine the extracellular domain (ECD) boundaries by identifying the signal peptide and transmembrane regions using software tools. Some of the relevant tools, freely available online, are referenced in the Table of Materials15,16,17,18.\nSynthesize the ECD for the genes of interest and clone into the relevant vector. Secreted proteins or the ECD of STM receptors fused to a number of common affinity tags can be purified from the conditioned media of cells transfected with the appropriate vector, or from baculovirus-insect cell expression systems.\n\tNote: Mammalian cell-based systems (such as HEK/293 or CHO cells) are recommended to maximize the likelihood of proper protein folding and addition of relevant posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation.\nPurify the proteins by standard affinity purification methods. Previous efforts have described automated or semi-automated procedures suitable for purification of hundreds of proteins, which can be scaled to generate the set of proteins of interest9,19,20,21.\n\tNote: SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography (S), or multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) are recommended to assess any non-covalent aggregation and to control for the overall quality of the protein preparations.\nAdjust proteins to 200 or 400 μg/mL whenever possible, and dilute stocks with 80% glycerol for long-term storage in cryogenic vials at -20 °C. These represent master stocks and should be accessed only when necessary.",
    "Transfer aliquots of each protein (100 μL) to 96-well plates (stock plates), seal with adhesive foil, and store at -20 °C until microarray slide preparation. Stock plates are generated to minimize freeze-thaw cycles and ensure protein stability.\n2. Extracellular Protein Microarray Printing\nUse a standard microarrayer for slide printing. The instrument utilized for the protocol described here has a capacity of 57 slides/run and uses a printhead holding 48 spotting pins. These pins generate spots of ~100 μm diameter separated by a spot-to-spot distance of ~350 μm and draws 0.25 μL per load. Under this configuration, up to 8,000 spots per slide can be accommodated.\nGenerate working plates (384 well plates, 10 μL sample/well) from the stock plates. Perform this step manually prior to slide printing using the microarrayer. Then, spot proteins with quill-type spotting pins onto epoxysilane slides at 60% humidity (to prevent dehydration of the protein spots).\n\tNote: Cy3-labeled Bovine serum albumin (BSA) can be spotted in duplicates between each protein sample (5 μg/mL in PBS/40% glycerol) to visualize the array for mask fitting (see section 4). Although recommended, this step is optional.\nSubsequent to printing, remove the protein microarray slides from the humidified environment and block them overnight with 5% milk in PBST to inactivate the surface.\n\tNote: The preferred approach is to use an ultrasonic fogger to generate a fine mist of blocking solution that settles onto the slide surface.\nStore slides at -20 °C in 50% glycerol to prevent freezing.\n3. Preparation of Multivalent Bait Complexes\nNote: Interactions between extracellular proteins are often characterized by low affinities. To enable detection of these interactions by increasing binding avidity, a multivalent approach based on capturing the query protein, expressed as Fc-tagged ECD, on protein A-coated microbeads was developed4.",
    "Label the carrier IgG used for detection with Cy5 monoreactive dye and separate the free dye using desalting columns. Determine the dye to protein ratios by measuring ultraviolet absorbance at 280 and 650 nm.\n\tNote: Protein-dye ratios between 2.0 and 4.0 are normally used. It is recommended to spin the Cy5 conjugates at 100,000 x g for 15 min to remove potential soluble aggregates due to the labeling process.\nDetermine the optimal microbead-to-protein ratio by titration of protein A against a constant amount of the query protein. The minimal saturating volume of beads where no free Fc-tagged protein remains, as measured using a competitive assay determined by biolayer interferometry, is used for the screening.\nForm the microbead-protein complexes by incubating the Fc-tagged query and the Cy5-IgG with protein A microbeads and mix on a tube rotator in PBS for 30 min at room temperature protected from light.\nTo form these complexes, use the query protein at a final concentration of 20 μg/mL. To calculate the molar ratio of the query protein and Cy5-IgG, divide the molecular weight of the query protein by the molecular weight of the IgG (150,000 Da) and multiply by 40 μg/mL to determine the concentration of Cy5-IgG needed.\nSupplement samples with soluble protein A (1 mg/mL) immediately prior to incubation with the microarray slides (see 4.2 section below) to prevent binding of any free protein A beads to the Fc fusion proteins that may be present on the array.\n\tNote: The final reaction volume may vary depending on the hybridization station or incubation chamber utilized. The instrumentation described in the Table of Materials allows sample incubation using relatively small volumes (~200 μL per slide).\n4. Extracellular Protein Microarray Screening and Processing.",
    "Note: There are a number of manufacturers that provide automatic processing platforms. If a hybridization station is not available, the following steps can be performed manually, ensuring that there is sufficient volume of buffer to keep the slides submerged at all times.\nWarm the slides at room temperature and rinse with PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) to remove residual glycerol before loading onto the hybridization station.\nUse the following screening protocol:\n\t\nWash with PBST for 1 min.\nLoad 200 μL of 1 mg/mL protein A in PBS/5% milk and incubate for 30 min to prevent uncomplexed protein A microbeads from binding to Fc-tagged proteins that may be present in the microarray.\nWash five times with PBST for 1 min.\nLoad 200 μL of the query:microbeads complex in the presence of 1 mg/mL protein A and incubate for 30 min.\nWash with PBST for 1 min.\nAfter hybridization, rinse slides with water, place in individual 50-mL conical tubes, and dry by spinning at 900 x g for 5 min.\nFinally, scan the slides with a microarray scanner appropriate to detect Cy3 (if BSA-Cy3 has been printed) and Cy5 fluorescence by exciting at 532 and 635 nm, respectively.\nPerform data analysis using the accompanying microarray data analysis. The relevant array list (as a .gal file) is loaded into the data extraction software. At this stage, utilize the Cy3-BSA spots to find blocks and use the auto-fitting options in the software, followed by manual alignment of the features when necessary. Save files as .gpr files for further analysis.\n5. Data Analysis\nSave data as GPR files and process in R using the limma package, commonly utilized for analysis of microarray data4,5.",
    "For preprocessing, do background correction and within-slide normalization. Since each protein is printed in duplicated spots, combine both replicate measurements to create a single score for that protein in the library.\nCalculate scores for each slide and analyze results for the intersection of high-scoring candidates between slides.\nUse duplicate microarrays from separate print-runs to control for slide variability and use intersection plots representing data from both screens to call final hits.\nFinally, perform an additional level of filtering to exclude promiscuous proteins within the array. Such non-specific binders are identified as proteins exceeding a specific threshold hit frequency as defined by the user across independent screens.\n\t\tNote: This protocol is described in detail in Tom et al. 20135. In our case the non-specific binder calling is based on the determination of the cumulative prey hit rate, and a data-driven elimination threshold of 5% is used.\nSubscription Required.
