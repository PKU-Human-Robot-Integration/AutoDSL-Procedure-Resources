    "1. Preparation of Functionalized Slides\nPlace the microscope slides in a removable slide rack, and wash twice by immersing in a staining jar containing 99% ethanol (histological grade). Wipe the slides clean using paper towels (ensuring not to generate paper dust), and dry using a jet of compressed nitrogen gas.\nNOTE: Do not use Kim-Wipes to wipe the slides as it would generate fine paper dust.\nImmerse the slide rack containing the slides in a staining jar filled with concentrated sulphuric acid and incubate at room temperature overnight.\nNOTE: To avoid contact with skin, use chemical-resistant gloves and safety goggles while working with concentrated acids and toxic and corrosive chemicals.\nSonicate the slides for 30 min and wash with Milli-Q (18 MΩ) water for 30 min, follow with another wash in acetone for 5 min. This treatment exposes the silanol groups on the glass surface.\nCoat the clean slides with 2.5% (vol/vol in water) of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) solution, by immersing the slide rack in APTES for 30 min, washing 3 times in Milli-Q water for 15 min each wash, and baking the slides in a furnace at 110 °C for 15 min. Baking allows cross-linking of the APTES, resulting in -NH2-functionalization of the surface.\nNOTE: Make the APTES solution in a plastic container since APTES deposits preferentially on the walls of glass container.\nUsing a spin coater, coat the slides with 1% (wt/vol in toluene) Polystyrene-Co-Maleic Anhydride (PS-MA) (Sigma) to achieve a mono-layer of hydrophobic coating 6. Add 2.0 mL of PS-MA onto a clean glass slide mounted on a spin coater and coat at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. These conditions may vary based on spin coating parameters such as coating solution, substrate, thickness of coating and governed by the following equation 7\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3845/3845eq1.jpg",
    "where h is thickness of film coating, e is rate of evaporation, η , C and ρ are viscosity, concentration and density of the coating solution, respectively, and ω is angular velocity.\nNOTE: Toluene is harmful when inhaled for a long time and use of a fume hood is recommended.\nThe slides can be stored in a slide rack for up to one month in dry, dust-free conditions at 2- 8 °C.\n2. Preparation of Yeast Inocula and Collagen Encapsulation\nPrepare an overnight culture of C. albicans strain SC5314, in Yeast Peptone Dextrose [YPD; 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone and 20 g/L dextrose] liquid medium by inoculating a single colony of C. albicans into 10 - 20 mL of YPD8. Incubate culture in an orbital shaker (about 150 - 200 rpm) at 30 °C overnight. Harvest 1 mL Candida albicans yeast cells from overnight YPD cultures (by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5-10 minutes) and wash twice for 10 min in 1 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 10 mM phosphate buffer, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 137 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) (Sigma) per wash. Harvest washed cells also by centrifugation at 1900 rpm for 10 minutes. Resuspend the washed cells in 1 mL reconstruction buffer (0.2 N NaOH solution with 2.2% (wt/vol) sodium bicarbonate and 4.8% (wt/vol) HEPES, pH 7.2).\nNOTE: C. albicans is a Risk Group 1/BSL1 microorganism. Always remember to use good aseptic/sterile techniques for work with this microorganism and follow institutional procedures for proper disposal of biohazardous materials.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer on a bright field microscope and adjust to a cell density of 5×107 cells/mL.\nFurther dilute the suspension ten times by addition of 10× RPMI-1640 supplemented with L-glutamine and buffered with morpholinepropanesulfonic (MOPS) acid (pH 7.2).",
    "Encapsulate the yeast cells in collagen by mixing the cell suspension in RPMI-1640 with collagen (1.8 mg/mL) (Type 1 from rat tail, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), to obtain a final concentration of 4× 106 cells/mL. Keep the collagen-cell suspension on ice to prevent the gelation of collagen before printing.\n3. Preparation of CaBChip\nClean and disinfect all surfaces of the microarrayer, including the source plate station, wash and vacuum station, vacuum slide platter and printing chamber, by wiping with 70% isopropanol.\nPlace and hold by vacuum the desired number of PS-MA-coated glass slides on the slide deck of the microarrayer.\nVortex the cell suspension in collagen vigorously and aspirate 100 μL of the well-mixed suspension into a well of a 96-well plate, just before printing. Place this source plate in the loading station.\nSwitch on the humidifier to maintain a relative humidity of 100% in the microarray chamber throughout the printing process.\nPrint 50 nL of cell suspension in an array of 48 rows and 16 columns with spots spaced 1.2 mm apart using a microarray spotter (Omnigrid Micro, Digilab Inc., Holliston, MA) by non-contact deposition using conically tapered 190 μm orifice ceramic tips (Digilab).\nPrime, rinse and vacuum-dry the tips twice after each round of printing.\nImmediately after printing, place the slide in an air-tight, humidified chamber (Hybridization cassette, ArrayIt Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) and incubate at 37 °C for 24 hr to allow for biofilm formation.\n4. Susceptibility Testing of Preformed Biofilms in CaBChip Against Antifungal Agents\nFrom stock solutions or powder of antifungal drugs, prepare a working solution in RPMI- 1640 medium. Typical maximum concentrations of the working solution are 1,024 μg/mL for fluconazole and 16 μg/mL for amphotericin B5. Other concentrations may be used for different agents.",
    "Prepare eight different concentrations of the compound by diluting the stock solution in two-fold dilutions, spanning a range with the estimated IC50 of the compound in the middle.\nAfter 24 hr of biofilm growth, use the microarrayer to print 50 nL of eight different concentrations of the drugs, along with positive (no drug i.e. cells in only media) and negative (treated with sodium hypochlorite for 20 min) controls, in at least six replicates on top of the biofilms.\nNOTE: Maintain a relative humidity of 100% to prevent the drying of the spots while adding the drugs.\nSoon after adding the drugs, incubate the chip with the drugs in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 24 hr.\nWash the drugs off by dunking the CaBChip 3-5 times for 2 min every time in PBS and stain by incubating the CaBChip with 0.5 μM FUN1 at 37 °C for 30 min9.\nWash the stain off by dunking the CaBChip 3-5 times in PBS for 1-3 min every dunk, and dry the CaBChip using a nitrogen stream. Read fluorescence intensity using a microarray scanner (GenePix 4100A, Axon Instruments, CA) at a wavelength of 532 nm with a PMT gain of 380.\nSet the fluorescence intensity of the positive control (no drug) and dead (bleach-treated) biofilm spots at 100% and 0%, respectively.\nDetermine the percentage inhibition by the reduction in the fluorescence intensity (F) relative to the average of the control spots using the following equation\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3845/3845eq2.jpg\nwhere F, Fmax and Fo are raw fluorescence intensities of drug-treated, no-drug control and bleach-treated spots, respectively. The scanner settings were adjusted to obtain Fmax and Fo of 30000 and 4000 RFU, respectively.\nCalculate the 50% inhibitory concentration or IC50 by fitting the variable slope Hill equation using GraphPad Prism Software (La Jolla, CA).",
    "5. Representative Results\nA representative CaBChip, consisting of a 48×16 array of nano-biofilms of C. albicans, is shown in Figure 2. The bright field microscopy shows an overall architectural feature of the nano-biofilm. The scanning electron microscopic images of the biofilm show that the fungal hyphae are embedded within the matrix of collagen fibers, which are approximately 2 μm and 100 nm in diameter, respectively. The FUN1-stained microarray scanner images show the yeast and hyphal forms, which are characteristic of fungal biofilms. The 2D- and 3D-confocal fluorescence images of FUN1-stained biofilms can be seen to have spatial heterogeneity, with regions of metabolically active cells interspersed within the extracellular matrix (composed of collagen as the encapsulating material and most likely also of exopolymeric material produced by biofilm cells), which is not stained by the metabolic dye. The thickness of the biofilm was estimated to be approximately 50 μm. The CaBChip was used to estimate the antifungal susceptibility of two drugs, fluconazole and amphotericin B, and the results are shown in Figure 3. Consistent with published reports on industry standard 96-well plate assays, the biofilms are resistant against fluconazole10 and the calculated IC50 for amphotericin B is 0.3 μg/mL11.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3845/3845fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

A picture of the high-thoughput CaBChip, printed using a robotic microarrayer and containing 768 spots on PS-MA-coated slides. Each hemispherical spot is 50 nL in volume, approximately 700 μm in diameter, and with a 1.2 mm separation between spots. Also shown (clockwise) are light microscopy, microarray scanner, 2D- and 3D-fluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy images of the individual biofilms on the CaBChip. The SEM figure at high magnification of 25,000x shows a hyphal filament of width 2 μm.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3845/3845fig3.jpg",
