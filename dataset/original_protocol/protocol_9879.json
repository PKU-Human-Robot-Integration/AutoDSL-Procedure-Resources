    "1. Solution preparation (to be performed in advance)\nFibrinogen labeling\n\tNOTE: The labeling step is required only if analyzing the deformation of the fibrin gel is desired. For cellular experiments, it is possible to use an unlabeled gel.\n\t\nAdd 38 μL of 10 mg/mL succinimidyl ester fluorescent dye (dissolved in DMSO) to 1.5 mL of 15 mg/mL fibrinogen solution (molar ratio of 5:1) in a 50 mL centrifuge tube and place on a shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. Afterwards, place the tube in the centrifuge for 3 minutes at 800 x g (room temperature).\nFilter the supernatant from the previous step through a desalting column packed with dextran gel resin (Table of Materials) to separate the unreacted dye,42 by following these steps.\n\t\t\nPre-wash the column with 25 mL of fibrinogen buffer.\nSlowly inject the labeled-fibrinogen from step 1.1.1 into the column, making sure that there are no bubbles entering the filter. Discard the first ~0.3 mL of eluted solution (4-6 drops of faint colored liquid). Then collect the following 1.0-1.5 mL of purified solution (follow manufacturer’s protocol for more specific details).\nFinish the filtration process by sterilizing the resulting purified solution using a syringe-driven filter (0.22-0.45 μm).\nTo clean and recycle the column, wash with 20 mL of fibrinogen buffer, and then store in 25 mL of 20% ethanol.\nAfter elution, divide the resulting purified labeled-fibrinogen into small aliquots of ~7-50 μL, depending on the desired number of stretched gels. For each stretched 2 mm diameter circle gel, prepare about 3.5 μL of fibrinogen (2.5 μL will be used per gel + 1 μL for pipetting errors).\n\t\nStore the aliquots in a -20 °C freezer. They can be used up to about one year (it is not recommended to thaw and freeze again).",
    "For the remainder of this protocol, keep approximately 7 μL of the purified labeled fibrinogen in the refrigerator (4 °C) until step 4. This volume is intended for the creation of two stretched gels (2.5 μL is needed per gel, and an extra volume of 1 μL is used to account for errors in sample preparation).\n\t\tNOTE: This filtering procedure typically dilutes the initial 15 mg/mL fibrinogen solution to a final concentration of about 10 mg/mL. The dilution factor depends on the initial volume and concentration of fibrinogen, as specified in the manufacturer's protocol.\nPrepare 7 μL of thrombin solution (dilute using thrombin buffer to 2 units/mL, Table of Materials) and keep in the refrigerator (4 °C) until step 4. This volume is intended to fill the cut-outs of two stretched gels.\n\tNOTE: In order to perform internal strain analysis, 1 µm diameter fluorescent spherical beads (purchased as a suspension [2% solids] in water plus 2 mM NaN3) should be added to the thrombin solution (a ratio of 1:25 v/v % of bead:thrombin is recommended for a 40x objective). Beads should be included only when internal strain measurements are desired, either in the presence or absence of cells.\n2. Silicone strip preparation\nRetrieve the 0.5 mm thick silicone rubber and cut it into 15 x 80 mm2 strips with a 2 mm diameter hole in the center of the strip (Figure 1). If possible, use a programmable laser cutter for high precision. If programmable machinery is not available, scissors are sufficient for cutting the strip outline and a small hole-punch is adequate for the center cut-out.",
    "NOTE: Commercial silicone rubber is usually purchased with plastic wrap on both sides. Keep original plastic covering on both sides of the silicone if possible. If reusing silicone strips from a previous experiment, treat them with trypsin for 0.5 hour, soak in 0.2 M NaOH for 0.5 hour, and then soak in 70% ethanol for 1 hour. Let them dry before use.\nPrepare sealing film (hydrophobic) layers with dimensions of at least 20 × 30 mm2, so they are wider than the silicone strip and thus allowing for a seal to form over the entire geometric cut-out.\nWash a 10 cm dish with 70% ethanol, and then wipe and dry with non-linting delicate task wipes (for both sterile and non-sterile experiments). This step is important since it allows the sealing film layers to better stick to the plate and restrict sample’s movement during the preparation process.\nPlace the sealing film layers in the washed 10 cm dish so there is enough space to place two strips in each dish side-by-side (Figure 2A).\n\t\nRemove the plastic wrap from one side of the silicone strip and place the exposed side on the sealing film layer so the cut-out is surrounded entirely by the sealing film layer (Figure 2B). Then, press gently on the silicone against the sealing film layer in order to seal the area surrounding the cut-out, using clean gloved fingers.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure there are no air-pockets between the silicone and the sealing film, especially around the cut-out. Do this by examining the bottom-side of the dish (Figure 2C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671fig01.jpg",

Preparing thrombin with cells\nNOTE: Perform this step only if embedding cells in the hydrogel is desired, and under sterile conditions in a biological hood (Table of Materials).",
    "Sterilization: the day prior to the cellular experiment, place the silicone strips & sealing film layers in 70% ethanol overnight and then perform UV sterilization for 30 minutes on each side (if the 10 cm dishes are not already sterile, they should also be sterilized under UV light for 30 minutes after a 70% ethanol wash). The UV system utilized in the protocol is the one built into the biological hood.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, an autoclave sterilization cycle (140 °C) can be performed on the silicone strips since they are resistant to up to 260 °C.\nPerform a cell count to determine cell concentration, and then centrifuge and re-suspend the cell pellet with 7 μL of thrombin (2 units/mL) in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. We recommend a cell concentration of 800 cells/μL of thrombin. Keep the cells chilled until use (do not exceed more than half an hour to avoid damaging the cells).\n4. Polymerization of fibrin gels\nRetrieve the 2 Unit/mL thrombin & 10 mg/mL labeled-fibrinogen solutions from the refrigerator (prepared in step 1) and place them on ice where they will be accessible.\n\tNOTE: Solutions are kept cold prior to the mixing process in order to slow down the polymerization reaction kinetics. This allows for more homogenous mixing of the proteins.\nWith the dish(es) set up (step 2), extract 2.5 μL of labeled-fibrinogen and pipette it uniformly into the silicone cut-out (with the sealing film layer attached to its bottom side) so that the entire circumference of the cut-out is in contact with fibrinogen. Be careful not to allow any air-pockets or bubbles to form anywhere in the solution, paying particular attention to the bottom edges of the cut-out (the interface between the sealing film layer and silicone).",
    "Immediately take 2.5 μL of thrombin (with or without cells/beads) and pipette it directly into the fibrinogen solution in the cut-out (reaching final volume of 5 μL fibrin). Then quickly mix the two solutions by carefully pipetting up and down ~10 times. During the mixing process, move the tip around the entire volume to create as homogenous a solution as possible.\nAdd a very small amount of Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) [alternatively cell medium for cell experiments, Table of Materials] along the edge of each dish so the hydrogel does not dry out during the polymerization process. Ensure there is no contact between the PBS/cell medium and the samples as this will damage the sample.\nCover the dish(es) and place them in the incubator at 37 °C for 30 minutes.\n\tNOTE: The required incubation time is dependent on the volume of the gel. If larger volumes are used, the incubation time should increase.\nRemove the dish(es) from the incubator and add PBS/cell medium to the dish, submerging the entire gel-silicone construct.\nCarefully lift the sample constructs one at a time from the dish making sure the sealing film layer remains adhered to the strip. Slowly detach the sealing film layer from the silicone by gently pealing from one end of the silicone to the other (Figure 3). Avoid pulling from areas close to the cut-out where stress concentrations may exist (this is mainly important for non-circular geometries). Avoid any contact with the cut-out as it will damage the sample.",
    "Place the strip back into the dish with PBS/cell medium such that the strip is floating in the dish. Then take the dish(es) to a standard cell-culture microscope to qualitatively assess the condition of each sample. Gels must be uniform, continuous throughout the cut-out, and no bubbles should be present. Using Figure 4 as a guide, select the best samples for further analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Proper removal of the sealing film layer from the bottom of the silicone strip. The removal process should be done slowly so the hydrogel will not tear or break its adhesion with the inner walls of the cut-out.

Sample loading on the SCyUS device\nFill the bath with PBS/cell medium (Figure 5) and place the silicone strip carrying the sample gel across the top so the ends are sitting on each side of the bath. The bath is meant to avoid any drying of the gel. Place and tighten the clamps (purple) along with the fabric strips (green) so that all pieces are connected to form one straight strip with the cut-out in the center (Figure 5).",
    "Retrieve the SCyUS device and attach the aluminum liquid well and 22 mm x 40 mm rectangular glass coverslip (No. 1 or 1.5) (Figure 6Aiii). Attach the cover slip to the bottom of the well using sealing material (e.g., vacuum grease) so that the well can be filled with liquid without leakage.\n\t\nFill the well with ~1-2 mL of PBS/cell medium and place the strip + fabric + gel construct (Figure 6B) into the device. Clamp the fabric strip (2) into the bracket (1) so that the cut-out + gel (5) is in the center as shown, then carefully place the pin-down insert (4) into the device and lock it in place.\nNext, insert the other fabric side to the spindle (without attaching the servomotor) and lock it into the spindle (Figure 6C).\nInsert the SCyUS device with the attached sample into the stage of the microscope (Figure 6C). Connect the microcontroller (Table of Materials) to the computer via a USB cable and connect the servomotor to the microcontroller. Open the SCyUS control module on the computer. The sample is now ready for imaging to check the adequacy of the gel’s thickness and fiber homogeneity under the confocal microscope.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: (A) Jig containing a PBS bath (3D printed) (B) Strip placement on the jig to ensure proper in-line attachment of brackets (in purple) and preventing drying of the gel.

Ensure adequate gel for sampling\nUsing the confocal microscope (Table of Materials) take a low-magnification (10×), low-resolution (~1.4 μm x 1.4 μm pixel size) confocal Z-stack (≤10 Z-slices with a step size of approximately 10 μm is sufficient) tile image of the entire gel using lasers of 488/543/561 to examine homogeneity and adhesion to the circumference of the geometric cut-out throughout the thickness of the silicone (Figure 7A-B). Use this Z-stack image as a map for the following steps.",
    "Using low-resolution live imaging, scan the gel and determine the lowest Z-position where full adhesion to the inner walls of the cut-out is apparent with no tears or bubbles and note the Z-location of the microscope (Zl). To determine full adhesion of the gel to the silicone throughout its circumference, scan the interface of the fluorescent label of the gel and the silicone strip (dark background) under the microscope (Figure 7C).\nMove up in the Z-direction until there is no longer continuity in the gel and note the Z-position (Zu):\nSubtract the upper limit (Zu) of the Z-direction from the lower limit (Zl). This is the reference thickness of the sample (Zo):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671equ01.jpg\n\tIf Zo ≥ 100 μm then the gel is considered satisfactory for analysis. Note that the thickness of the silicone cut-out is about 500 μm, but gel polymerization in the cut-out typically results in a smaller gel thickness. 100 μm is the minimum recommended thickness to ensure a stable stretching process, without tears or detachment of the gel from the silicone cut-out.\n\tNOTE: At different XY locations, the thickness of the gel can vary. This section of the protocol measures the minimum thickness of the gel, allowing us to determine the gel quality and indicate if it is sufficient for stretching. Additionally, finding the center of the gel provides a reference point to return to post-stretching, whether static or dynamic.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671fig07.jpg",

SCyUS operation, stretching & imaging\nNow that the sample has been determined to be of satisfactory quality and is set on the SCyUS device properly, determine the pre-stretched position of the sample. This is achieved by using live imaging under the confocal microscope (similar to step 6.2).\n\t\nMake sure the servomotor is at its zero position by clicking the Go To Zero Servo Pos button (Click on Figure 8A and ensure that Figure 8B displays zero) and attach it to the stretching device as seen in Figure 6C.\n\t\tNOTE: Do this step slowly and carefully as not to put any excess tension on the sample.",
    "While imaging the sample, move the motor one degree (Figure 8C) at a time in the clockwise direction by clicking the +1 button until the right side of the cut-out is observed to move. Then, reverse the movement (Figure 8D) back to the penultimate step position by clicking on the -1 button. This verifies that the sample is under minimal tension. Click on the Set Min Servo Position button (Figure 8E) to set the reference position. It is possible to return to the reference position at any time by clicking the Go To Min Servo Position button (Figure 8F).\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use a high-magnification objective (≥40×) for this step to minimize error.\nCapture a high-magnification (40×), high-resolution (~0.2 μm × 0.2 μm pixel size), single Z-slice tile image of the entire gel area. This will be used as the reference image for post-processing analysis. It is recommended to capture a single Z-slice image in the middle of the gel thickness (by using Zo from Eq. 1), this will allow for the return to approximately the same Z-position after stretching. Also, take into consideration that high-resolution tile images of the entire gel area take considerable time (~20-30 min).\nNow the sample is ready for static stretching. Adjust the servomotor to the desired stretch magnitude by advancing one degree (Figure 8C) at a time in the GUI (perform this slowly, about 1 degree/second).\nAt each stretch magnitude where analysis is desired, capture a single Z-slice high-resolution tile image of the entire gel area for post-processing analysis. Similar to step 6.2, verify that the gel has not detached from the silicone throughout its circumference by scanning the interface between the gel (red) and the silicone (dark background), looking for changes in the adhesion from the previous stretch magnitude.",
    "NOTE: During the activation of the motor, use live imaging to follow the gel location in X-Y (with low-resolution, low-magnification settings). The gel experiences a Z-Poisson effect where the bottom of the gel rises, therefore the Z-position of the microscope should also be adjusted to the approximate center of the gel thickness for every stretch magnitude. This can be achieved by recalculating Zo (Eq. 1) for each stretch magnitude. Since stretch in the Z-direction is relatively homogenous, it is not critical to find the exact center depth of the gel.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671fig08.jpg\nFigure 8: GUI for the SCyUS control module. (A) Position of the motor in degrees.

Post-processing external strain measurements\nTo measure the effective strains of the cut-out boundaries, measure the edge-to-edge lengths in the stretch direction (X-axis) at the center of the Y-axis (Figure 9A).\n\t\nUpload the pre-stretch image to the image processing software (ImageJ FIJI43) and measure the largest-edge-to-edge distance which is defined as the axial length of the hole (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671equ08.jpg) at the center.\nDefine the largest distance from top to bottom as the perpendicular distance (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671equ06.jpg).",
    "Repeat this process for all stretch interval images and calculate the axial (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671equ07.jpg) and perpendicular (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671equ05.jpg) distances of the cut-out periphery (Figure 9A, bottom) and then perform the following calculations to find the strains of the cut-out edges:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671equ02.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671equ03.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671fig09.jpg\nFigure 9: Gel strains due to external stretching of the silicone strip. (A) X-Y cross-section of an un-stretched fibrin gel (top), and after application of εhole = 64% strain along the x direction (bottom).

Fiber orientation analysis\nUse quantification of fiber alignment to characterize the structural response of the fibrous gel to increasing magnitudes of stretch. Upload high-resolution images to ImageJ FIJI software (NIH)43 and then analyze using the OrientationJ (EPFL)44 module (Settings: Gaussian gradient, and 3-pixel window, Figure 10).\n\t\nCalculate the 2D Nematic Order Parameter (NOP) of the orientation histogram as:45\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671equ04.jpg",
    "NOTE: A value of NOP = 1 indicates perfect alignment along the axial direction (angle zero) and NOP = 0 indicates isotropy. The orientation angle, θ, is the fiber angle in relation to the strain axis (x-axis) obtained through image analysis and precisely defined in the OrientationJ documentation.44\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61671/61671fig10.jpg\nFigure 10: Fiber orientation analysis using FIJI ImageJ software. (A) Main Menu of ImageJ with an arrow indicating the location of the ‘Plugins’ pulldown menu where ‘OrientationJ’ can be found.

Manual internal gel strain analysis\nWhile performing live high-magnification imaging of a hydrogel with embedded beads, manually locate a region of interest (ROI) with easily recognizable features (e.g., aggregates of beads), in order to return to the same location after each stretch magnitude.\n\tNOTE: Compression in the Z-direction (Poisson effect) can lead to an increase in bead density as stretch increases, therefore we suggest choosing bead aggregates large enough, so they are clearly identifiable. This protocol calls for the analysis of the central region of the fibrin gel, though any region can be chosen.\nIn the pre-stretch position (step 6), capture a high-resolution Z-stack image of the selected ROI. After each desired stretch interval, return to the same ROI and repeat the image capture process.\nTake the images and import them into ImageJ. In the ROI, record the X-Y pixel location of each visible bead aggregate. Transfer the recorded data to a spreadsheet.",
    "Measure the distances between every pair of aggregates and compare them to the distances of the same pairs in the reference image, allowing calculation of strains in the X and Y directions.\n\tNOTE: If a continuous real-time movie is recorded while the gel is stretched (instead of static image capture), an automatic analysis of strains can be performed with digital image or volume correlations (DIC/DVC) methods, as previously demonstrated46,47. However, it should be noted that automatic DIC/DVC analysis is challenging in this setting, as the Z-stack is not only moving in the X-Y plane but also in the Z-direction due to the Poisson effect (compression), accounting for considerable drifts during the recorded movie.\nSubscription Required.
