    "Protein expression in E. coli cellsInoculate 4 ml 2× YT broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin with E. coli cells carrying the target rhodopsin gene plasmid and incubate at 37°C overnight with shaking (200 rpm).Inoculate 115 ml 2× YT broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.01% (v/v) antifoam with 1.15 ml overnight culture, and incubate at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) until the mid-log phase (OD660 of 0.5-0.7).When the optical density reaches the target value, add IPTG and all-trans-retinal stock solutions at a final concentration of 0.1 mM and 10 µM, respectively.Incubate at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 4 h.Note: The cultured cells can be stored overnight at 4°C in the dark (covered with aluminum foil to prevent light exposure). Measurement of ion transport activity by monitoring extracellular pH changeNote: Setup of the equipment for measuring light-dependent pH change is shown in Figure 1. Transfer 5 ml culture to a glass test tube and measure the OD660 of the cultured cells using a digital calorimeter (optical length 18 mm). Dispense the cultured cells into a 15-ml plastic tube containing a cell amount equivalent to 15 OD·ml (OD660 × total volume (ml) of the cell suspension).Collect the cells via centrifugation (4,800 × g, 2 min, 20°C) and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 5 ml unbuffered 100 mM NaCl solution and collect via centrifugation (4,800 × g, 2 min, 20°C).Resuspend the cells in 5 ml unbuffered 100 mM NaCl solution, mix at room temperature (22-25°C) by rotation for 10 min, and collect via centrifugation (4,800 × g, 2 min, 20°C).Repeat Step B4 three times.Resuspend the cells in 7.5 ml unbuffered 100 mM NaCl solution.Transfer the cell suspension to a water-jacketed glass cell vial at 20°C.",
    "Note: In advance, equilibrate the temperature of the water-jacketed glass cell vials by running water adjusted to 20°C in a circulating bath. Subsequent measurements are performed at 20°C. Immerse a pH electrode, protected from light, into the cell vial and monitor the pH of the cell suspension while stirring with a magnet.Adjust the pH of the cell suspension to 6.9-7.0 using a small amount of NaOH or HCl, and stabilize the pH fluctuation.Record the pH changes over time, following the procedure described below.Record the baseline pH for 3 min in the dark.Using a cut-off filter (Y-52) and a heat-absorbing filter (HAF-50S-50H), illuminate the sample with light from a xenon lamp for 150 s at a wavelength range covering the absorption wavelength of rhodopsin.Turn off the light and wait for the pH value to return to the baseline level (this takes more than 150 s).Record the baseline pH again for 2 min in the dark.Add 10 μl 20 mM HCl and monitor the pH for 150 s to calibrate the buffering effect of the cell suspension.Add 10 μl 20 mM NaOH to return the pH to the baseline level.Note: A representative trace is shown in Figure 2. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4115/bioprotoc-11-15-4115-g001.jpgFigure 1. Setup for measuring light-dependent pH change. A. Overall view of the setup. B. Close-up view of the measurement part.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4115/bioprotoc-11-15-4115-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative trace of extracellular pH change monitoring. Shown here is an example of the measurement of schizorhodopsin-1 (SzR1), which exhibits inward proton pumping activity. Black and orange boxes indicate the dark (black) and light-illuminated (orange) conditions, respectively.Add 2.5 μl 30 mM CCCP and repeat Step B10.",
    "Note: Since CCCP is a protonophore, the pH change is reduced when rhodopsin directly transports H+, but it is enhanced when secondary H+ transport is associated with other ion transport such as Na+ or Cl– (Inoue et al., 2013, Yoshizawa et al., 2014). After completing the measurement, remove the cell suspension from the glass cell using a micropipette.Wash the glass cell five times with ultrapure water.Note: To completely remove the waste water from the glass cell, use a suction pump. Quantitation of expressed protein using the hydroxylamine (HA) bleach methodSample preparationTransfer 5 ml culture to a glass test tube and measure the OD660 of the cultured cells using a digital colorimeter (optical length 18 mm). Dispense the cultured cells into a 15-ml plastic tube containing a cell amount equivalent to 20 OD·ml.Collect the cells via centrifugation (4,800 × g, 2 min, room temperature) and discard the supernatant.Store the cell pellet at −80°C until use.Resuspend the collected cells in 1 ml bleaching buffer containing 1 mM lysozyme (M.W. = 14,307) and adjust the volume to 3 ml with bleaching buffer.Note: Dissolve 1 mM lysozyme immediately before use. Add a small amount of DNase I to the cell suspension using the tip of a spatula. Subsequently, cover the tube with aluminum foil and mix by rotating at room temperature for 1 h.Place the cell suspension on ice and disrupt the cells by sonication until the lysate becomes less turbid. The sonication conditions used here were 5-s pulses of ultrasound irradiation at 5-s intervals and 35% output for a total of 10 min.To solubilize the membrane protein, add 0.09 g DDM to the sonicated cell suspension (final DDM concentration 3%), cover the tube with aluminum foil, and mix by rotation at 4°C overnight.",
    "Measurement of the absorption spectrumNote: The absorption spectrum is measured using a UV-visible spectrometer with an integrating sphere. All operations are carried out in the dark or under red light (λ > 660 nm) conditions. Transfer 2.7 ml solubilized sample to a disposable optical cuvette with a 10-mm optical path length. Measure the absorbance before the addition of HA.Note: This step checks the state of the samples before adding HA, such as the states of cell disruption and solubilization and the signal from a target protein. Add 0.9 ml 2 M HA stock solution to the solubilized sample and mix well by pipetting (final HA concentration, 500 mM). Measure the absorption spectrum immediately after the addition of HA in the dark (illumination time, t = 0).Using a cut-off filter (Y-52) and a heat-absorbing filter (HAF-50S-50H), illuminate the sample with light λ > 500 nm from a xenon lamp for 1 min (t = 1 min) and then measure the spectrum again.Calculate the spectrum difference before and after light illumination.Illumination time is prolonged in a geometric progression manner (t = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 min, etc.); repeat steps c and d until the bleaching signal of rhodopsin is completely saturated.Calculate the molar extinction coefficient of rhodopsin (ϵ) from the ratio between the absorbance of bleached rhodopsin and that of the generated retinal oxime (ϵ = 33,600 M-1 cm-1 at 360 nm) (Scharf et al., 1992). Calculate the molar amount of rhodopsin expressed in E. coli cells by dividing the absolute value of the absorbance of bleached rhodopsin by ϵ."
