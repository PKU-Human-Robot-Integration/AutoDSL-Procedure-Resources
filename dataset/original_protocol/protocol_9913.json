    "1. Glassware and tubing assembly – to be performed only the first time\nNOTE: Figure 1 shows the experimental setup for MnO nanoparticle synthesis with numbered tubing connections. Figure S1 shows the same setup with the main glassware components labeled. If there is a mismatch between the chemical resistant tubing and the glass connection size, cover the glass connection first with a short piece of smaller tubing before adding the chemical resistant tubing to make the connections snug.\nSecure the air-free nitrogen tank to the wall close to a chemical fume hood using approved strap restraints. Add the appropriate nitrogen regulator to the tank.\n\tCAUTION: Gas cylinders must be properly secured since they can be very dangerous if tipped over.\nFill the gas drying column with desiccant. Attach chemical resistant tubing from the air-free nitrogen regulator to the bottom inlet of the gas drying column (#1 in Figure 1).\nSecure the glass manifold containing at least 2 outlet stopcocks to the top of the fume hood using two metal claw clamps. Attach chemical resistant tubing from the outlet of the gas drying column (#2 in Figure 1) to the inlet of the manifold (#3 in Figure 1).\nPlace and secure 3 mineral oil bubblers in the fume hood using metal claw clamps according to Figure 1. Put two bubblers to the left and one bubbler to the right.",
    "Fill the leftmost bubbler (by #9 in Figure 1) with the smallest amount of silicone oil (~1 inch of oil from the bottom of the bubbler). Fill the middle bubbler (by #7,8 in Figure 1) with a medium amount of silicone oil (~1.5 inches of oil from the bottom of the bubbler). Fill the rightmost bubbler (by #11 in Figure 1) with the largest amount of silicone oil (~2 inches of oil from the bottom of the bubbler).\n\tNOTE: The relative amount of silicone oil between the mineral bubblers is very important to achieve appropriate flow of the air-free nitrogen gas through the system. Do not add too much oil (over ~2.5 inches), as the oil will bubble during the reaction and can exit the bubblers if overfilled.\nConnect the outlet on the right stopcock of the manifold (#4 in Figure 1) to the threaded end of a glass elbow adapter (#5 in Figure 1) using chemical resistant tubing.\nAttach the threaded end of another glass elbow adapter (#6 in Figure 1) to the inlet of the middle bubbler (#7 in Figure 1) using chemical resistant tubing. Connect the outlet of the middle bubbler (#8 in Figure 1) to the inlet of the leftmost bubbler (#9 in Figure 1) using chemical resistant tubing.\nConnect the outlet on the left stopcock of the manifold (#10 in Figure 1) to the inlet of the rightmost bubbler (#11 in Figure 1).\nLeave the preliminary setup in the fume hood if space accommodates. Secure the two glass elbow adapters with tubing attached (#5,6 in Figure 1) to the metal latticework in the fume hood when the experiment is not running.\n2. Equipment and glassware setup – to be performed during every experiment",
    "CAUTION: All steps involving solvents require the use of a chemical fume hood as well as proper personal protective equipment (PPE) including safety glasses, lab coat and gloves. The nanoparticle fabrication setup should be assembled in the fume hood.\nPlace the stir plate in the fume hood and put the heating mantle on top of the stir plate.\n\tNOTE: The heating mantle must be able to withstand temperatures above 300 °C.\nPut the 4 neck 500 mL round bottom flask onto the heating mantle and secure the middle neck with a metal claw clamp. Add a magnetic stir bar to the round bottom flask. Place the glass funnel in the middle neck of the round bottom flask.\nCheck the manifold: make sure the safety stopcock (#10 in Figure 1) and input stopcock (#4 in Figure 1) are open.\n\tCAUTION: The safety stopcock needs to be open at all times to assure no pressure is built up in the system. If the stopcock is closed, an explosion can occur.\nWeigh 1.51 g of manganese(II) acetylacetonate (Mn(II) ACAC) and place inside the round bottom flask using the glass funnel.\nAdd 20 mL of oleylamine and 40 mL of dibenzyl ether to the round bottom flask using a glass pipette and the glass funnel. Remove the funnel and clean it with hexane.\n\tCAUTION: The experiment can be scaled up (e.g., 2 times), but it is recommended to be conservative when using any larger quantities of reactants. Larger amounts of reactants could cause the reaction to become less stable, and therefore dangerous.\nAttach the condenser to the left neck of the round bottom flask and secure the condenser with a metal claw clamp. Add the glass elbow adapter (#6 in Figure 1) on top of the condenser.",
    "NOTE: The adapter should be connected with chemical resistant tubing to the middle mineral oil bubbler (#7 in Figure 1).\nConnect water compatible tubing from the water outlet spout in the fume hood (#12 in Figure 1) to the inlet of the condenser (#13 in Figure 1). Also use water compatible tubing to connect the outlet of the condenser (#14 in Figure 1) to the drain in the fume hood (#15 in Figure 1). Secure the tubing to the condenser connections (#13,14 in Figure 1) with interlocked worm gear metal hose clamps.\nAdd the rotovap trap to the right neck of the round bottom flask. Place the glass elbow adapter (#5 in Figure 1) on top of the rotovap trap.\n\tNOTE: The adapter should be connected with chemical resistant tubing to the right stopcock manifold outlet (#4 in Figure 1).\nAttach the rubber stopper to the middle neck of the round bottom flask and fold it over so the sides cover the neck of the flask. Add the plastic conical joint clips (4 green clips in Figure 1) to secure the following glassware neck connections: elbow adapter and rotovap trap, rotovap trap and round bottom flask, round bottom flask and condenser, and condenser and elbow adapter.\nPlace the temperature probe into the smallest neck in the round bottom flask, tightening and securing the probe with the neck cap and the o-ring. Seal the connection with paraffin plastic film.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the temperature probe is immersed within the fluid mixture, but does not touch the bottom of the glass. If the probe is in contact with the glass surface, the temperature measured will be inaccurate compared to the true fluid temperature, which will cause the temperature controller to provide an incorrect amount of heat to the reaction.",
    "Connect the temperature probe to the input of the temperature controller. Connect the heating mantle to the output of the temperature controller.\nTurn on the stir plate and start stirring vigorously.\nOpen the air-free nitrogen tank and slowly begin flowing nitrogen into the system (this will remove the air). Adjust the nitrogen flow using the regulator until a steady slow stream of bubbles form in the middle mineral oil bubbler (#7 in Figure 1).\nTurn on the cold water in the fume hood (#12 in Figure 1) to the condenser and check that no water leaks from the tubing.\nPut the sash of the fume hood down before the reaction begins.\n3. Nanoparticle synthesis\nTurn on the temperature controller (power and heating supply) to start the reaction. Observe and record the color of the reaction mixture in each stage. The reaction will begin as a dark brown color in stages 1 to 3 and will turn green during stage 4.\n\tNOTE: Each temperature controller will work differently. Make sure to use the correct manual and program.\nStage 1: Observe the temperature controller display to confirm the temperature increases from room temperature to 60 °C over 30 min.\nStage 2: Ensure that the temperature controller stabilizes at 60 °C for 1 min as it prepares for a faster heating rate in stage 3.\nStage 3: Check the temperature controller display as the temperature rises to 280 °C at 10 °C per minute over 22 min. Make sure the water flow through the condenser is sufficient, as the mixture will start to evaporate during this stage.",
    "Stage 4: Confirm the temperature controller displays a constant reaction temperature of 280 °C for 30 min. Observe the reaction color change to a green tone, which indicates MnO formation. Once the reaction reaches 280 °C, turn off the nitrogen tank and close the right stopcock for the inlet of the reaction on the manifold (#4 in Figure 1).\n\tCAUTION: Keep the safety stopcock (#10 in Figure 1) open.\nStage 5: Check the temperature controller display to ensure that the heating stops automatically. Keep the temperature probe inside (do not open the round bottom flask) and wait until the temperature reaches room temperature to proceed with nanoparticle collection.\n\tCAUTION: The flask will be extremely hot. Heat resistant gloves should be worn to remove the heating mantle if a faster cooling rate is desired.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n4. Nanoparticle collection\nTurn off the temperature controller, the stir plate and the cold water. Remove the water compatible tubing from the condenser, water faucet in the fume hood and the drain. Remove all the plastic conical joint clips from glassware connections.\nRemove the glass elbow adapters from the rotovap trap (#5 in Figure 1) and the condenser (#6 in Figure 1). Secure the elbow adapters to the metal latticework in the hood to use for a future experiment.\nDetach the condenser and rotovap trap from the round bottom flask and rinse the insides of the condenser and rotovap trap with hexane.\nRemove the rubber stopper and temperature probe, and clean with 70% ethanol.\nPour the MnO nanoparticle solution from the round bottom flask into a clean 500 mL beaker. Use hexane (~5 mL) to rinse the round bottom flask and add the hexane with residual MnO nanoparticles into the 500 mL beaker.",
    "NOTE: Hexane will resuspend the MnO nanoparticles while 200 proof ethanol will act as the precipitant agent.\nNote the current volume of the MnO nanoparticle mixture. Add 200 proof ethanol to the MnO nanoparticle mixture using a volume ratio of 2:1 (e.g., add 150 mL of ethanol if the nanoparticle mixture is 75 mL).\nPour the nanoparticle mixture equally into four centrifuge tubes, around 3/4 full. Screw on the appropriate caps. Check to make sure the fluid levels are balanced.\n\tNOTE: Any extra nanoparticle mixture will be added to the tubes on the next round of centrifugation.\nCentrifuge nanoparticles for 10 min at 17,400 x g at 10 °C.\n\tNOTE: Longer centrifugation times and/or higher centrifugation speeds can be used to increase collection of smaller nanoparticle fractions, but nanoparticle aggregation can be increased.\nDiscard the supernatant into a waste beaker, being careful not to disturb the pellet. If needed, use a transfer pipette to collect the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: It is normal for the early rounds of centrifugation to produce a brown colored supernatant. The supernatant should be brown and clear, but not cloudy. Any cloudiness indicates that the nanoparticles are still present in the supernatant. If the supernatant is cloudy, centrifuge the tubes again before discarding the supernatant; centrifuging again will reduce loss of the synthesized nanoparticles, but can cause more agglomeration.\nAdd 5 mL of hexane and any extra nanoparticle solution left to each centrifuge tube containing the MnO nanoparticle pellets. Resuspend the nanoparticles using a bath sonicator and/or vortex. Continue until the solution becomes cloudy and the pellet disappears, which indicates successful nanoparticle resuspension.\nAdd more 200 proof ethanol to the centrifuge tubes until 3/4 full.\nRepeat steps 4.8-4.10. Then, combine the resuspended nanoparticles from four centrifuge tubes to two centrifuge tubes. Next, repeat step 4.11.",
    "Repeat steps 4.8-4.10 once more, which will make a total of three washes with hexane and 200 proof ethanol. Do not add any 200 proof ethanol to the centrifuge tubes.\nCombine and transfer the MnO nanoparticles resuspended in hexane into a preweighed 20 mL glass scintillation vial. Leave the lid of the vial off to allow the hexane to evaporate overnight in the fume hood.\nThe next day, transfer the uncovered glass scintillation vial containing the nanoparticles into a vacuum oven. Keep the lid for the vial in a safe place outside the oven. Dry out the nanoparticles at 100 °C for 24 hours.\nOnce nanoparticles are dried, use a spatula to break up the powder inside the vial. Weigh the vial containing dried MnO nanoparticles and subtract the known weight of the glass scintillation vial to determine the nanoparticle yield.\n\tCAUTION: Dried nanoparticles can easily become airborne and should be handled by personnel using a particle respirator such as N95 or P100.\nStore nanoparticles at room temperature inside the glass scintillation vial with the lid on. Wrap the lid with paraffin plastic film.\n5. Nanoparticle size and surface morphology (TEM)\nPulverize the MnO nanoparticles into a thin powder using a mortar and pestle.\nAdd 5 mg of MnO nanoparticles to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. Add 10 mL of 200 proof ethanol.\n\tNOTE: 200 proof ethanol evaporates quickly to obtain a more homogeneous spread of nanoparticles on the TEM grid. Another solvent could have better nanoparticle suspension, but would take longer to evaporate, and due to surface tension, the nanoparticles would accumulate on the borders of the TEM grids.\nBath sonicate the nanoparticle mixture for 5 min or until full resuspension of the nanoparticles.",
    "Immediately upon resuspension, add three 5 µL drops of the nanoparticle mixture onto a 300 mesh copper grid support film of carbon type-B. Let air dry.\n\t\nUse reverse tweezers for easier sample preparation. Position the grid on the tweezers with the darker side up before adding the drops containing nanoparticles.\n\t\tNOTE: The grids are fragile, so be careful not to bend and damage the grids for better imaging. Once dry, grids should be kept inside commercially available TEM grid storage boxes for protection.\nAssess nanoparticle shape and size using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Apply typical parameters for TEM including a beam strength of 200 kV, a spot size of 1, and a magnification of 300x.\nCollect images on areas of the grid where enough nanoparticles (10 - 30 nanoparticles) are evenly distributed. Avoid areas containing nanoparticle aggregations, as accurate sizing cannot be made if nanoparticles are not visibly separated.\n\t\nImage areas from different grid squares to assure an even distribution. For an optimal size distribution, take between 25 - 30 images from each sample to obtain a sufficient sample size.\n6. Quantitative analysis of nanoparticle diameter\nTo analyze TEM images with ImageJ, first open one of the images by clicking File | Open. Select the desired image and click Open.\nTo calibrate the distance measurement in ImageJ from pixels to nanometers, first click the straight-line tool. Hold the Shift key and trace the length of the scale bar. Then, click Analyze | Set Scale.",
    "In the Set Scale pop-up window, type the true scale bar measurement into the Known distance box (e.g., type 50 if the scale bar is 50 nm). Change the unit of length to the corresponding units (e.g., type nm for nanometers). Check the Global box to keep the scale consistent in all the images, and click OK.\nAfter setting the scale, use the straight-line tool to trace the diameter of a nanoparticle. Then click Analyze | Measure or click Ctrl+M keys.\nLook for a results pop-up window to appear with different information about the measurement. Confirm that the Length column is present, as it will provide the diameter of the nanoparticles with the units specified during step 6.3.\nRepeat step 6.4 until all the nanoparticles in the image are sized. To move to the next image, either click File | Open Next, or Ctrl+Shift+O keys.\nAfter all nanoparticles are sized in all images, go to the Results window and click File | Save As. Rename the results file and click Save. View and analyze all nanoparticle diameters in a spreadsheet program after importing the results file.\n7. Nanoparticle bulk composition (XRD)\nIf not done during step 5.1, pulverize the MnO nanoparticles into a thin powder using a mortar and pestle. Place the fine nanoparticle powder into the sample holder using a spatula. Follow the sample loading procedure specified for the X-ray diffraction (XRD) machine to be used.\nDetermine bulk composition of MnO nanoparticles using XRD. Collect XRD spectra over a 2θ range from 10° to 110° to view peaks of MnO (30° to 90°) and Mn3O4 (15° to 90°).\n\tNOTE: Other setting parameters recommended for XRD are a step size of 0.05 s, a beam mask of 10 mm, and a scan step time of 64.77 s.",
    "Save the generated .XRD file and open it in the XRD analysis program.\n8. Analysis of XRD spectra\nIn the XRD analysis program, identify all the main peaks in the sample’s measured XRD spectrum by clicking on the IdeAll button in the software.\nTo save the data, select File on the toolbar, followed by Save as… to save the data as an ASC file that can be opened with a spreadsheet program.\nUse the program to pattern match the XRD database of known compounds to find the best composition match to the sample. To narrow the search, specify anticipated compounds (e.g., manganese and oxygen).\n\t\nTo pattern match the spectrum, select Analysis | Search & Match. In the pop-up window, select Chemistry and click the desired chemical elements to restrict the program search based on the sample.\nOnce all elements are chosen, select Search. Wait for a list of chemical compositions matching the XRD spectrum to appear.\n\t\tNOTE: The program will provide the likelihood that known XRD spectra correspond to the sample’s composition. If two or more compositions are chosen, the program would give the composition percentage of each of them (e.g., MnO versus Mn3O4).\nIf desired, remove the background from the XRD spectrum by clicking the Fit Background button (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61572/icon.jpg). Then, click Background in the pop-up window, followed by Subtract. Confirm that the spectrum appears starting with 0 on the y-axis.\n\t\nSave the data again without the background as shown in step 8.2.\nWhen plotting the XRD spectrum, show the characteristic peaks of each matched compound (e.g., MnO and Mn3O4).",
    "To obtain the list of the characteristic peaks for matched compounds from the database, first right click on the pattern match spectrum, and then select Show Pattern. Wait for a pop-up window to appear with all the peak information corresponding to the selected pattern.\nSelect, copy and paste the desired information from that compound and plot the characteristic peaks with the measured XRD spectrum in a spreadsheet program.\n9. Nanoparticle surface composition (FTIR)\nAdd dry MnO nanoparticle powder to the sample holder for Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis.\nEvaluate nanoparticle surface chemistry using FTIR. Collect FTIR spectra between a 4000 and 400 cm-1 wavelength range with a resolution of 4 cm-1.\nClean the FTIR sample holder and add liquid oleylamine. Repeat Step 9.2.\n10. Analysis of FTIR spectra\nIn the FTIR analysis program, remove the background from the collected FTIR spectrum by selecting Transforms in the drop-down menu, followed by Baseline Correct. Select Linear as the correction type.\nUse the left mouse click to select the baseline points on the original spectrum. Once finished, save the spectrum under another name by selecting Add or replace the old spectrum by selecting Replace.\n\tNOTE: Background correction can enhance the prevalence of weaker FTIR peaks of interest.\nTo export the FTIR spectrum, first select the specific spectrum from the list. Then, click File on the toolbar, followed by Export spectrum.\nChoose csv file format from the Save As window and click Save. Open and graph the csv file using a spreadsheet program.\nCompare acquired MnO nanoparticle with oleylamine FTIR spectra as detailed in the Representative Results section to evaluate nanoparticle capping with oleylamine.\nSubscription Required.
