    "This protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration (Ruhr-University Bochum: Reg.-No.: 21-7373; Medical University Innsbruck Reg.-No.: 1060/2021). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n1. Preparation for the surgery\nMake sure to obtain audiological testing reports, including pure-tone audiometry, objective testing (e.g., brainstem evoked response audiometry, speech testing), and vestibular diagnostics (e.g., video head impulse test or caloric testing). Obtain radiological imaging reports, including high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull base, as preparation and indication for surgery.\n\tNOTE: MRI is required to secure the presence of the vestibulocochlear nerve and the patency of the cochlea. In the HRCT, anatomic variances (e.g., of the facial nerve) or malformations may be identified.\nCheck the required hardware and software for impedance measurements (i.e., IM software, video recording software, MAESTRO).\nObtain written informed consent from the patient.\nPerform general anesthesia considering the clinical history and risk factors of the patient as per the decision of the anesthesiologist.\nPosition the patient's head in such a way that the mastoid segment of the facial nerve runs approximately horizontally. Achieve this by reclining the head and slightly positioning it to the opposite side.\nShave the hair in the retro-auricular region (approximately 3 cm) to avoid the penetration of hair into the situs.\nInstall facial nerve monitoring. Insert the monitoring needles into the obicularis oris muscle and the orbicularis oculi muscle. Place the reference electrodes on the thorax or shoulder. Make sure to fix the cables in order not to extract them accidentally during surgery.\nDisinfect the surgical site. Use disinfectant (e.g., Octenisept) according to the clinic's standard.",
    "Use sterile foil draping to cover the microscope and the patient. Ensure that the cover is as thin as possible in the area of the planned receiver coil position to avoid connection problems between the transmitting and receiving coil. Do not use hair wraps made of cloth as used in many ORs. Utilize self-sticking foil draping and make sure to avoid multi-layering.\n2. Surgery\nPreparing for the implant\n\t\nMark the position of the processor and the skin incision of approximately 8 cm. Ensure enough space between the auricle and the implant housing.\nInject local anesthesia (e.g., Ultracain 1% -Suprarenin, Sanofi, Paris, France) in an s-shaped area behind the auricle before skin incision.\nIncise the skin up to the temporal fascia using a scalpel. Dissect the periosteum and display the outer ear canal and Henle's spine.\n\t\tNOTE: The surgical instruments are variable and not decisive for the presented method. Appropriate surgical instruments can be used to perform the surgical steps.\nSet the wound retractors on the opposite of the planned implant side to avoid later interaction (magnetic attraction/electric interference) with the telemetry coil.\nFor cochlear implantation, perform antrotomy, mastoidectomy, and posterior tympanotomy8.\nExpose the dura to the middle cranial fossa as a first landmark using a large cutting burr.\n\t\tNOTE: The size of the burr may vary depending on the surgical site.\nThin out the posterior canal wall of the outer ear canal with the same burr.\nExpose the short incus process in the antrum and identify the lateral semicircular canal.\n\t\tNOTE: Both antrum and semicircular canal are identified visually during the drilling procedure.\nAs a next surgical step, expose the chorda facial angle where the chorda tympani leaves the facial nerve. In this step, use a large diamond burr and drill the bone parallel to the expected facial nerve.",
    "NOTE: The size of the diamond burr may vary depending on the surgical site.\nOpen the facial recess with a small diamond burr. Leave the facial nerve with thin bony coverage.\nAccess the middle ear through posterior tympanotomy.\nEnlarge the posterior tympanotomy caudally until the round window niche is visualized.\nMaximize the posterior tympanotomy for great exposure of the middle ear, optimizing the visualization of the insertion process. Remove the bony overhang of the round window niche using a small diamond burr until the round window membrane may be visualized completely.\n\t\tNOTE: When moving the ossicular chain, a movement of the round window membrane may be seen to clearly identify the round window membrane. Make sure not to touch the membrane with the burr or accidentally open it.\nBefore opening the membrane, put some adrenaline (1 mg/mL) in the middle ear and protect it from bone dust with a resorbable sponge (e.g., Spongostan).\nPositioning the Implant\n\t\nPrepare the implant housing by drilling a bed into the bone in the future position of the receiving coil. Use the implant housing dummy provided by the manufacturer to mark the borders of the implant bed. Avoid slipping of the implant by creating an edge with the rosen burr. Use a diamond burr to smooth the surface.\n\t\tNOTE: The edge of the implant housing prevents the movement of the implant toward the mastoidectomy defect.\nPack the coil into a sterile sleeve since the coil is placed already at the beginning of the insertion process.\nPosition the implant in the drilled implant bed, fix it with sutures, and cover it with the muscle flap.\nReplace the retractors to avoid any magnetic interaction with the stimulating coil.\nImplantation and impedance measurement\n\t\nUse two computers - one for Maestro and one for IM recordings.\nStart the IM-software.",
    "Place the telemetry coil above the magnet of the receiving coil. Secure it with a clamp to avoid movements and disconnections.\nWait for the clinician, engineer, or audiologist to start the software and give feedback about the coupling. Change the position of the receiver coil until a secure connection is achieved.\nEnsure that no bleeding impedes the visualization of the insertion process or enters the perilymph.\nCommunicate the visibility of the surgical field on the screens. Make adjustments to the optical focus of the microscope so that the clinician, engineer, or audiologist can follow the insertion process.\nEnsure the facial recess is as dry as possible to avoid early false positive measures.\nOpen the round window membrane with a needle.\nAvoid any suction nearby the round window.\nDo not touch the electrode array.\nCommunicate the start of insertion to the clinician, engineer, or audiologist so that he/she may adjust the status buttons. Instruct the engineer to mark one status button after the other as the electrode is inserted.\nInsert the first electrode contact into the cochlea. Wait for the feedback of the clinician, engineer, or audiologist and the audio signal to proceed. Apply an audio signal every 10 s to enable a constant and slow insertion speed with an overall insertion time of approximately 2 min.\n\t\t\nFor the auditory signal, play a sine wave signal of 500 Hz constant pulsing on and off and repeat it every 10 s using the software Audacity. Do not adjust the timing of the signal and pauses according to the insertion process but keep it constant.\nInsert the electrode array slowly to avoid cochlear damage. Advance one electrode contact every 10 s (as guided by the sound signal).",
    "Inform the clinician, engineer, or audiologist about the progress by clearly communicating the number of contacts inserted so that the clinician, engineer, or audiologist can mark the progress in the software as precisely as possible by pressing the status buttons of the IM tool.\nInstruct the clinician, engineer, or audiologist to mark the number of inserted electrode contacts according to the feedback of the surgeon (Figure 2).\nContinue the measurements until full insertion to observe impedance drops.\nCommunicate the surgical steps.\nStore the electrode lead in the mastoid cavity. Make sure to avoid extrusion forces by finding a tension-free position.\nEnd of surgery\n\t\nSeal the round window niche with fascia.\nCheck the integrity of the implant (impedance telemetry, electrically evoked stapedius reflex thresholds, if applicable, and electrically evoked compound action potentials).\nClose the wound in layers.\nContinue repeated telemetry measurements until the wound is fully closed. Avoid a dislocation of the stimulating coil.\nCheck the eardrum and the skin of the outer ear canal for any surgical damage before ending the surgery.\nSubscription Required.
