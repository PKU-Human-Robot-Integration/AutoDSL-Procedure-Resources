    "The animal protocols described here have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of National Yang-Ming University.\n1. Preparation of The Holder for Neonatal Pups in The Stereotaxic Apparatus\nMake the head tray: cut the bottom of a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube (15 mm long) into the shape that fits the head of neonatal pups by removing 1/5 of the wall of the tube.\nTake a pipette tip box with the right size that fits with the pedestal of stereotaxic apparatus, and remove the top cover. Affix the head tray prepared in step 1.1 and a tissue embedding cassette onto the base of tip tray with hot-melting adhesive. The height of the tissue embedding cassette is 7 mm, which is used to support the pup's neck and body in the head-fixed position.\nPlace the whole setup in a standard stereotaxic apparatus.\n2. Preparation of 30G Injection Stainless Steel Needles\nPre-clean 30G syringe needles by soaking them in chloroform for 3 days.\nUse forceps to carefully and slowly pull the needle out from its polypropylene hub in a chemical hood.\nWash the needles with absolute ethanol for 20 min followed by 70% ethanol rinses for 3 × 10 min on a shaker at 50 rpm. Let the needles air dry, and store the cleaned needles in a clean box at room temperature (RT) until use.\n3. Prepare an Adapter for Microinjection Tubing\nConnect the microliter syringe to a 30G injection needle with a PE10 polyethylene tube (PE10 tube). Prepare a PE20 polyethylene tubing (PE20 tube) adaptor for bridging the injection needle and the microliter syringe. The use of the adaptor is necessary, because the diameter of PE10 tube is much smaller than that of the needle of the 26G microliter syringe.",
    "Prepare the tubing for the microliter syringe: connect the pre-cleaned 30G injection needle with 5 cm of PE20 tube, and seal the junction with instant glue. This tubing adaptor is reusable.\n\tNOTE: If the needle of microinjection syringe is 30G, the preparation (step 3.1) and usage (step 3.3) of this adaptor is not necessary.\nConnect the tubing adaptor (prepared in step 3.1) with a microliter syringe (10 µL).\nConnect one end of PE10 tube (no longer than 60 cm) onto the 30G needle of the PE20 tubing adaptor. Mount a new 30G injection needle onto the other end of the PE10 tube.\n4. Load the Microinjection Tube with Autoclaved Distilled Water, Dye and Viruses\nRemove the plunger of the microliter syringe. Use a 25G syringe to load the microliter syringe and its connected PE tube with autoclaved distilled water to remove air from the tubing.\nPlace the plunger back to the microliter syringe, and push the plunger until 2 µL of distilled water remains in the barrel. Do not let the volume of distilled water become lower than 2 µL.\nMount carefully the microliter syringe onto the micro flow rate syringe pump.\nPipette small amounts of 0.1% fast green dye (prepared in 0.9% saline and filtered with 0.22 µm filter) and the virus liquids to a piece of parafilm.\nWithdraw a small amount of air to make an air bubble visible at the junction between the 30G injection needle and PE10 tube followed by loading 0.7 µL of filtered fast green into the tube to test the flow of fluids in the microinjection tubing.\nWithdraw another small amount of air to make a second air bubble followed by loading the virus liquids into the microinjection tubing.\nAttach and secure the 30G microinjection needle to the arm of stereotaxic apparatus.",
    "5. Anesthesia of Neonatal Mice by Hypothermia\nPlace the pup in a latex glove sleeve and immerse it in crushed ice up to the neck for 5 min.\nPinch the pup's feet with forceps to make sure no withdrawal response of its feet.\nPlace the pup with latex glove sleeve in the head tray and put some crushed ice around the latex sleeve to keep it cold for hypothermia anesthesia.\nApply vet ointment on pup's eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia if possible.\n6. Microinjection\nPrepare sterile surgery by wiping the stereotaxic instrument thoroughly with 70% ethanol. Sterilize the surgical instrument by immersing them in 70% ethanol.\nScrub the pup's head with 70% ethanol. Locate the landmark lambda on the skull and mark the lambda with a marker pen. Aim the needle tip to the lambda, and set the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) coordinates as zero.\nMove the injection arm to the target site according to the X and Y coordinates of the target site. For the striatum of postnatal day (P) 2 pups, the coordinates are: AP, +2.4 mm anterior to the lambda; ML, ±1.0 mm lateral from the midline; dorsal-ventral (DV), −1.7 mm from the skull. Mark the position of fast green dye in PE10 tube with a pen.\nBring down the 30G injection needle slowly to penetrate through the skin and skull, and then bring up the needle tip until it stops at the surface of the skull. Set the DV coordinate as zero.\nBring down the 30G injection needle slowly until it reaches the DV coordinate of the target site. Wait for 1 min to allow the parenchyma resuming its normal shape. Run the microinjection program (100 nL/min).",
    "Make sure that the mark of fast green dye is moving in the PE tube to ensure the virus liquid is injected into the brain.\nWait for 1 min after the termination of the microinjection, and then slowly and progressively bring up the needle to 1/2 height of DV depth within 30 s. After 30 s, slowly withdraw the needle from the pup's head.\nRepeat step 6.2 to 6.7 until the microinjections of all targeted sites are completed.\n7. Post-surgical Recovery of The Pup\nWarm up the pup for 20 min in a 33 °C incubator. Check the recovery of the pup from hypothermia anesthesia every 5 min until the pup has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nReturn the pup back to the dam after the pup is fully recovered.\nSubscription Required.
