    "**Coat coverslips. Timing:** 10-15 min \\(depending on the number of coverslips).\n1. Thaw aliquots of laminin or collagen IV \\(1 mg/ml) prepared as described above and dilute to 50 μg/ml in HBSS with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>\n  2. Transfer the coverslips to a 24- or 48-well plate using sterile forceps\n  3. Coat each glass coverslip or Fluorodish with laminin or collagen solution, and incubate at 37 °C for 1-2 hours or overnight in an incubator.**Note:** Use the minimal amount of solution required for covering each coverslip or Fluorodish \\(typically 40 μl and 80 μl on coverslips in 24- and 48-well plate respectively, and 500 μl on Fluorodish).\n  \n**Culture medium preparation. Timing:** 10 minutes\n4. Prepare the neuronal culture medium as described above and filter-sterilize it with a disposable bottle filter \\(0.22 μm).\n  5. Warm up the neuronal medium and the trypsin \\(0.05%) at 37 °C.\n  \n**Islet dissociation and seeding. Timing:** 30 minutes\n6. Collect rat or human islets from Petri dishes in a 15 ml tube. **Note:** About 1 million single islet endocrine cells are usually obtained from 1,500 islets \\(three 10 cm Petri dishes with 500 islets each).\n  7. Centrifuge for 2 min at 110 x g \\(800 rpm) in a table top centrifuge\n  8. Aspirate the supernatant and wash 3x with PBS<sup>-/-</sup>\n  9. Remove PBS and add 300-400 μl of pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA solution. *Note: The volume of trypsin for dissociating islets depends on the number of collected islets. We recommend using 300 μl and 400 μl for dissociation of about 1,500 and 2,500 islets respectively.",
    "10. Using a micropipette with a 1000 μl tip, pipette up and down **very slowly** and without forming bubbles for about 3 minutes or until all islets are dissociated and no longer visible in solution. **Note:** 3 minutes are generally required to dissociate 1,500 rat islets. Longer incubation times are usually necessary for a higher number of rat islets and for human islets. **Caution:** This is the most critical step of the protocol: the pipetting has to be performed very slowly, avoiding formation of bubbles and continue only until no visible islets are present in solution. When islets are fully dissociated into single cells, the solution becomes opaque: at this stage, proceed immediately to steps 11 and 12 to avoid over-digestion.  \n  11. Fill the tube up to 15 ml with the pre-warmed neuronal medium.\n  12. Centrifuge at  350 x g \\(1400 rpm) for 6 minutes. Proceed immediately to step 13. \n  \n**Wash of the coverslips. Timing:** 5 min.\nDuring the centrifugation step described in 12, remove laminin/collagen solution from the coverslips/Fluorodishes and wash three times with HBSS \\(containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>). Let the coverslips air dry for approximately 5 minutes.\n \n**Seeding of islet single cells. Timing:** 30 min + 3-4 days for last step\n13. Gently remove supernatant and re-suspend single islet cells in 3 ml of neuronal medium \n  14. Take a few microliters from the cell suspension and count the cells",
    "15. Seed cells at 35,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> – or approx. 30,000 cells on each laminin or collagen-coated coverslip \\(48-well plate), 60,000 cells on laminin or collagen-coated coverslip \\(24-well plate), or 100,000 cells on laminin or collagen-coated Fluorodish.**Note:** When seeding cells on coverslips, use the minimal required volume to fully cover each coverslip \\(about 40 μl, 80 μl and 500 μl on coverslips for 48-well, 96-well and Fluorodishes respectively) avoiding leakage from the edges \\(important for maintaining the cells on top of the coverslip or Fluorodish and avoiding cells escaping underneath coverslips and outside the glass ring on Fluorodishes). Incubate for about 5-6 hours. \n  16. Slowly add neuronal medium on the side of the wells to reach the final volume of 500 μl, 1 ml and 2.5 ml for 48-well, 24-well and Fluorodish respectively. \n  17. Wait 3-4 days to reach full adhesion and spreading of islets cells before proceeding with experiments. **Note:** During the first 24 h upon seeding, cells display a rounded morphology. A more extended shape and the formation of two dimensional micro-societies of endocrine islet cells is reached 1-2 days after the seeding procedure"
