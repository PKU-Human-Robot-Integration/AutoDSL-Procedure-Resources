  "procedures": [
    "The following procedure was performed with approval from the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All survival surgeries were performed under sterile conditions, as outlined by the NIH guidelines. Pain and infection risks were managed with proper analgesics and antibiotics to optimize successful outcomes. Skeletally mature male New Zealand White rabbits, weighing 3.0-4.0 kg, were used for the present study.\n1. Drop tower fabrication\nGenerate CAD drawings for components of the drop tower, base platform, and mechanism to secure the Steinman pin (Supplementary Figures 1-14).\nPurchase commercially available components (See Table of Materials).\nProcure the machine parts of the device or give CAD drawings to a machinist for fabrication.\n\tNOTE: A high-precision machinist with toolmaking capability is required to fabricate the 3 mm diameter impactor tip (Supplementary Figure 1, part 20 and Supplementary Figures 13,14). The impacting face of the impactor head had curvatures of 7.14 mm and 5.56 mm in the sagittal and coronal planes, respectively, to conform to the curvature of the medial rabbit condyle35(Supplementary Figures 13,14).\nAssemble parts such that the drop tower consists of a carriage traveling on two vertical rods via fixed-alignment linear ball bearings, and the base platform supports the rabbit and secures the Steinman pin (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\n\t​NOTE: The carriage crossbeam of this design has a bending stiffness equal to that of a previous drop tower38 with an acceptable vibration level.\n2. Animal preparation",
    "Weigh the rabbit and anesthetize it using 2.5 mg/kg alfaxalone and 0.15 mg/kg midazolam IM (see Table of Materials). Apply eye ointment to both eyes after induction. Maintain anesthesia using ~2%-3% isoflurane. Give buprenorphine SR (0.1 mg/kg) SQ for analgesia and perioperative enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg) SQ. In place of Buprenorphine, NSAIDs such as Carprofen, 4mg/kg or Meloxicam, 0.2 – 0.3mg/kg or Ketoprofen, 3mg/kg can be given as SQ injections.\nShave the rabbit's hind limb from the ankle to the hindquarters. Extra caution is urged in rabbit hair removal to prevent contamination of the incision. Using a set of dedicated, sharp rabbit hair clippers is important.\nPlace the stainless steel front leg block (Supplementary Figure 1, part No. 2, and Supplementary Figure 4) under the end of the impact platform and cover the platform with a heating pad. Place the rabbit sternal (i.e., prone) on the heating pad. Place a padded bump under the contralateral hip.\n\t\nEnsure the operative extremity has the knee centered and resting on the polyethylene block (Figure 2A1). Use silk tape to gently retract the tail superior and contralateral to the operative extremity.\nWipe down the surgical site with chlorohexidine and 70% alcohol-soaked sterile gauze. Scrub the surgical site, starting at the posterior knee, with a circular sweep outward. Repeat at least 3 times with fresh scrubs, ending with 70% alcohol.\nPlace a sterile glove over the operative foot up to the ankle and wrap it with a sterile cohesive wrap.\nSterilely drape out the surgical site with three drapes: one directly under the operative extremity and the other two to cover the rest of the body. Secure the drapes with towel clamps.\n3. Surgical exposure",
    "NOTE: Prior to the surgery and impact, the weight and the drop height that deliver visible cartilage damage without subchondral bone fracture should be empirically determined for the specific strain, age, and sex of the rabbit.\nPalpate the position of the patella anteriorly to estimate the position of the knee joint, which is located distal to the patella. Using a 15-blade, make a 3-4 cm incision along the posterior aspect of the extended knee from the level of the superior pole of the patella distally.\nPerform blunt and sharp dissections through the underlying superficial fascia. Develop the interval between the skin medially and the medial gastrocnemius laterally. Place a self-retaining Weitlaner retractor in this interval (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nA secondary fascial layer will become visible just overlying the saphenous artery and vein. Dissect lateral to the saphenous and retract the vasculature medially and the posterior gastrocsoleus complex laterally.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care not to cut this vasculature. If this artery is damaged, ensure proper ligation, as post-operative hemorrhagic shock can occur.\nDissect distally until a small mobile fabella is identified over the posterior medial femoral condyle. Perform an arthrotomy to mobilize the fabella superolateral, exposing the underlying medial femoral condyle. Gently remove soft tissue by blunt and sharp dissection to expose the posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle. Use a Freer and Cricket self-retainer (see Table of Materials) to retract soft tissues at this level.\nWhile keeping the condyle exposed, advance a 0.062 inch Steinman pin (see Table of Materials) across the distal femur, beginning at the superior aspect of the medial femoral condyle and centered in the anterior-posterior direction of the medial femoral condyle, roughly 5 mm from the posterior aspect of the condyle.",
    "Drive the wire laterally through the bone and lateral skin parallel to the joint surface using a battery-powered Steinman pin driver. Palpation of the lateral epicondyle will ensure the appropriate trajectory of the Steinman pin.\nRemove the retractors and close the skin with a 3-0 polysorb suture (see Table of Materials) in a running fashion. Cover the incision with sterile gauze.\n4. Impact of the femoral condyle\nRemove the drape under the operative limb and secure the Steinman pin to a customizable and adjustable height impact platform. First, place the height-adjustable, lower aspect of the Steinman pin securing apparatus under the pin (Figure 2A2). Ensure the wire is parallel with the ground on this platform by adjusting the screw heights as needed.\n\t\nAfter ensuring the Steinman pin is parallel to the ground, place the top screw-based aspect of the secure platform (Figure 2A3) onto the lower screw-based aspect of the height-adjustable piece. Ensure the Steinman pin is tightly secured by screwing the top bar into the lower height adjustable portion of the pin-holding platform (Figure 2A2).\nOnce the Steinman pin is secured to the platform, remove the suture, and reopen the incision. Expose the medial femoral condyle with self-retaining Weitlaner and cricket retractors. An additional Freer may be needed to retract additional soft tissue out of the path of the impactor tip (Figure 2B).\nWipe down the drop tower with an approved disinfectant. Attach the sterile 3 mm impactor head (Figure 2A4) to the drop tower carriage. Bring the drop tower over the operative extremity and place its base (Figure 2A6) underneath the impacting platform (Figure 3A).\nGently lower the impactor (Supplementary Figure 2, part 20, and Supplementary Figure 13) onto the center of the posterior medial femoral condyle. Ensure no soft tissue is in the path of the impactor.",
    "Move the rabbit or tower as needed to ensure the impactor head is centered over the posterior medial femoral condyle (Figure 3B). Any time the rabbit is moved or re-positioned that surgical site should be assessed for any possible breaks to sterility and the area re-sterilized if needed. \nOnce appropriate trajectory is ensured, clamp the tower onto the platform with the toggle clamps (Figure 2A5, see Table of Materials).\nAdminister one dose of intravenous alfaxalone (0.5-0.7 mg/kg) 5-10 min prior to impact for deeper anesthesia without increasing inhalant anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: A lack of palpebral reflex, pedal withdrawal, and pinna reflex evidences deeper anesthetization. This deeper anesthesia helps prevent possible limb reactions during placement in the apparatus and during impact.\n\tCAUTION: If given too quickly, alfaxalone can cause transient apnea and hypoxia in rabbits and should be given slowly over 1-2 min. If hypoxia does occur, ensure adequate oxygenation and restoration of vitals before proceeding.\nSet the impactor on the drop tower at the desired height above the medial femoral condyle. For the current carriage assembly, including the bearings, with a mass of 1.41 kg, this is a height of 7 cm.\n\tNOTE: Drop tower height was determined from pilot studies on cadaver tissue. This height generated visible cartilage damage but not subchondral bone fracture for the rabbits in this study.\nClick on the Start button on the LabVIEW data acquisition software (Supplementary Coding File 1) just before freeing the spindle stop (Supplementary Figure 2, item No. 14) to release the carriage and allow it to drop under the force of gravity.",
    "NOTE: The data acquisition software will collect the data from a load cell (Figure 1, 6) positioned between the impactor and carriage and an accelerometer (Figure 1, 7) during the impact at 100 kHz using a laptop connected to a data acquisition module.\nPlace the txt file generated by the data acquisition software in the same folder with the Matlab data analysis code (Supplementary Coding File 2) and run the data analysis code to filter raw data and calculate impact parameters.\nEnsure that the maximum load is identified. The associated time point is considered the time of maximum deformation and zero velocity.\n\tNOTE: Data analysis code will analyze all txt files in the folder and report the results for each file. The code will determine the beginning and end of impact based on changes in the load-time data. Data from the accelerometer will be integrated numerically to calculate velocity and integrated again to calculate displacement. Data analysis code will numerically calculate the impulse, work, and kinetic energy from the following formulas:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64450/64450eq01.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64450/64450eq02.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64450/64450eq03.jpg\n\twhere F is the force measured by the load sensor, x0 and t0 are the displacement and time at the beginning of the impact, and x, and tf are the displacement and time at the end of the impact. The loading rate will be numerically calculated as the average of dσ/dt in the loading phase of impact. Peak stress will be calculated by dividing the peak load by the contact area of the impactor head.\nPerform visualization of the cartilage surface to determine whether appropriate cartilage damage has occurred (Figure 4A).\n5. Surgical site closure\nRemove the drop tower from over the operative extremity. Place all used surgical tools aside and change into new sterile gloves.",
    "NOTE: Given that the drop tower is not sterile, all tools used up to the impact should now be considered contaminated.\nReapply a sterile drape to the lower extremity and obtain unused sterile self-retractors.\nRe-expose the medial femoral condyle and thoroughly irrigate the surgical site with 50-60 mL of sterile saline.\nClose the posterior capsule with a 5-0 polysorb suture, followed by skin closure with a 4-0 monosorb suture (see Table of Materials).\nInject 2 mL of lidocaine/bupivacaine for local analgesia around the incision intradermally.\nRemove the Steinman pin with a power driver set (see Table of Materials) by oscillating to minimize soft tissue injury.\nDress the wound with a non-adhesive dressing, followed by adhesive tape. Perform an x-ray of the operative extremity to ensure no fracture occurred and appropriate pin placement (Figure 4B).\n6. Post-operative management\nReturn the rabbit to its cage and monitor it on heated blankets until it recovers from anesthesia (~25 min).\nContinue closely monitoring the rabbits for several days after the surgery to ensure they heal properly and regain mobility. Administer enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg) for 2 days post-operatively for infection prophylaxis. Administer buprenorphine SR analgesia (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 2-3 days after the surgery and as needed. In place of Buprenorphine, NSAIDs such as Carprofen, 4mg/kg SQ daily, Meloxicam, 0.2 – 0.3mg/kg SQ daily up to 3 days or Ketoprofen, 3mg/kg SQ daily can be administered 3-5 days after surgery and as needed.\n\t​NOTE: We have succeeded in preventing postoperative wound dehiscence, due to rabbit licking or chewing, with the placement of human neonatal pants over the  hindlimbs39. If the rabbit chews through the pants, an Elizabethan collar (see Table of Materials) may be placed to prevent chewing of the incision.\n7. Histological evaluation",
    "At 16 weeks post-injury, harvest knees from euthanized rabbits, fix them in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, followed by paraffin embedding and sectioning into 5 µm thick slices.\nAfter de-paraffinization and rehydration, stain the sections with safranin O fast green per standard protocols40,41.\nPerform the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay on the sections using TUNEL Chromogenic Apoptosis Detection kit following the manufacturer's instructions, counterstained with Hematoxylin42 (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
