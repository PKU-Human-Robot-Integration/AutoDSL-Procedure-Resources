    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of mouse brain sample\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, we will administer PF7845-yne and prepare brain samples. Please note that the transcardial perfusion is the preferred method for preparing conventional brain histology samples. Any conventional protocols for brain perfusion are compatible with CATCH (Gage et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). For non-brain tissues, please follow standard histology preparation protocols for fixation and tissue dissection.\nIntraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 1 mg/kg PF7845-yne in a vehicle of 10% DMSO, 2% Tween-80 in saline with an insulin syringe.\nNote: Injection volume is determined as 1% v/w of mouse body weight. For example, for a 20 gram, 6-week-old female C57BL6J mouse, 200 μL drug administration solution (0.1 mg/ml, as above table) should be prepared for injections. 1 mg/kg PF7845-yne was found to fully saturate FAAH. We have tested oral and sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administrations and obtained similar results (Pang et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nAnesthetize mice with 5% v/v isoflurane mixed with air 1 h after PF7845-yne administration.\nAlternatives: Mouse anesthesia can be performed by injecting a mixture of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 16 mg/kg xylazine (Sacma et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nPerfuse mice with ice cold PBS.\nPlace one end of pump tubing in ice cold PBS or 4% PFA solution, connect the other end to a 26G needle.\nSwitch on pump to fill tubing with perfusion solution.\nCarefully open chest to expose heart.\nMake a small incision at the right atrium. A small amount of dark venous blood should come out.\nInsert the needle into the left ventricle, perfuse in ice cold PBS (10 mL/min) to remove blood.\nStop perfusion when the liver is without blood stain and the liquid flowing out is clear. It takes ∼ 2 min (∼ 20 mL PBS) to fully remove blood.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2089-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Needle should be placed in the left ventricle (LV)\nIf it punctures into the right ventricle (RV), buffer will enter lung via pulmonary artery.\nNote: Effective removal of blood can reduce side reaction in final click labeling (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]). For additional resources on mouse perfusion, please refer to (Gage et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Wu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nPerfuse mice with ice cold 4% PFA perfusion fixative reagent (10 mL/min) for 2 min till the body gets stiff.\nNote: Signs of body twitching, tail flicking and head moving are signs of good PFA perfusion.\nDecapitate the mouse with tough cut surgical scissors.\nDissect out brains, fix samples in 4% PFA perfusion fixative reagent, 4°C, overnight.\nCut skin along the midline. Pull skin to the side to fully expose the skull.\nMake two lateral cuts underneath the brainstem.\nCut skull along the midline over the cerebellum.\nInsert scissors near the eyes and sever the skull.\nCut skull along the midline over the cortex to fully expose the brain.\nUse thumb and index finger to pull skull from the brain. Carefully peel off skull with forceps.\nRemove the brain from the skull for PFA fixation.\nNote: For additional resources for brain dissection, please refer to (Gage et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Wu et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nDrain PFA. Wash samples with PBS, 10 min, RT.\nEmbed tissue in 2% agarose, keep in 4°C for 1–2 h to get hardened.\nSlice brains into 100-micron desired sections (coronal or sagittal) with a Leica VT1000S or similar vibratome models.\nStore brain sections in PBS-NaN3 storage buffer, 4°C.\nPause point: Uncleared PFA fixed samples can be stored in 4°C for 1–2 months. If storage buffer gets cloudy, samples should be discarded.\nCLARITY tissue clearing\nTiming: 3 days",
    "In this step, we would perform tissue clearing with CLARITY, a hydrogel-based tissue clearing technique (Chung et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). CLARITY can remove lipid and render tissue transparent while preserving tissue architecture. Tissue clearing is critical to enable click reaction drug visualization in tissue (Pang et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The steps below are adopted from a published CLARITY protocol (Tomer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Please refer to the original protocol for additional details.\nPrepare A1P4 CLARITY solution on ice. Components for A1P4 CLARITY solution should be pre-chilled in 4°C prior to use.\nWeigh out required solid VA-044 in a tube and keep on ice.\nSequentially add water, 10× PBS, 32% PFA, 2% bis-acrylamide, 40% acrylamide solution.\nDissolve VA-044 initiator with ice cold water.\nAdd dissolved VA-044 and mix solution by shaking.\nTransfer tissue sections to A1P4 CLARITY solution. Solution should be filled close to top to minimize room for air.\nNote: For ∼10 brain sections, use a screw top 5 mL Eppendorf tube. For >20 brain sections, we recommend using a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nIncubate sections in A1P4 CLARITY solution, overnight in 4°C with gentle shaking (80 RPM).\nConnect vacuum desiccator to the vacuum pump and a nitrogen source (i.e., nitrogen tank).\nKeep tube caps loose on top to facilitate gas exchange. Place tubes in the vacuum desiccator, RT (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2089-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. CLARITY degassing set up\nSamples are placed in a vacuum desiccator. A three-way valve connects the desiccator, pump and nitrogen tank.\nSwitch on pump to remove air, 1 min.\nFlush in nitrogen from a nitrogen tank or any nitrogen source till the desiccator is filled with nitrogen.\nRepeat steps 16 and 17 twice to ensure oxygen is fully removed.\nClose nitrogen tank. Place samples under vacuum for 15 min at RT.",
    "Flush in nitrogen. Open the chamber just enough to reach the tubes. With nitrogen flushing, close caps to prevent oxygen entrance.\nCritical: CLARITY involves a free radical polymerization process and oxygen will inhibit CLARITY polymerization. Ensure oxygen is removed as much as possible.\nPlace samples in a 37°C shaking incubator (80 RPM) to polymerize for 4 h. Tubes should be kept upright to prevent excessive shaking and bubble formation.\nDrain A1P4 solution. Waste solution should be disposed properly as it contains hazardous materials. Briefly flush tissues with water to remove residue CLARITY A1P4 solution.\nClear samples with 8% PBS-SDS, 37°C, 2 days.\nNote: We have tested clearing temperature at 37°C–40°C, SDS concentration of 4%–8% and obtained similar labeling efficiency. Higher temperature and prolonged clearing time may cause protein loss and thereby not ideal for thin tissue sections (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]). For additional resources on CLARITY clearing steps, please refer to (Tomer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nWash samples with PBST (PBS with 0.2% TritonX-100, same as follows), 3 times, 10 min each, RT.\nWash samples with PBS, 10 min, RT. Samples should look transparent (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2089-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Brain sections after CLARITY clearing\nStore samples with PBS-NaN3 storage buffer, 4°C.\nAlternatives: In addition to CLARITY, we have tested other tissue clearing strategies, including but not limited to, SHIELD (Park et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), iDISCO (Renier et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), fDISCO (Qi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), CUBIC3.0 (Tainaka et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) and have obtained similar results.\nPause point: Cleared CLARITY samples can be stored in 4°C for up to a year without significant difference for labeling efficiency. However, we do recommend refreshing PBS-NaN3 storage buffer every 3–4 months to prevent microbial growth.\nClick reaction labeling\nTiming: 2–4 days",
    "In this step, we would perform click reaction in CLARITY cleared tissue to label drug in situ with an Alexa647 fluorescence dye. After click labeling, tissue can undergo secondary staining for molecular target identifications.\nPrepare click incubation buffer.\nSequentially add PBS, DMSO, 1.25 mM AF647 picolyl azide. Gently pipette to ensure proper mixing.\nPre-mix BTTP and CuSO4 stock solution, the solution should turn light blue.\nAdd Cu-BTTP pre-mixed solution. Gently pipette to ensure proper mixing.\nAliquot click incubation buffer into 2 mL Eppendorf centrifuge tubes (200 μL/tube).\nNote: We recommend preparing a master mix with 5% extra volume. For each coronal/sagittal brain section, use 200 μL for incubation. Cu2+ concentration can be adjusted between 50–150 μM (Cu to BTTP ratio of 1:2). AF647 picolyl azide has a Cu chelating group and has shown superior reaction kinetics compared to conventional azide tag (Uttamapinant et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nTransfer cleared tissue to click incubation buffer, 1 section/tube.\nPlace tubes on the tilted tube rack (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), overnight incubation with gentle shaking (80 RPM), RT. The rack should be shed from light.\nCritical: Click reaction requires Cu(I) as catalyst. Without reducing agent sodium ascorbate, the incubation step allows Cu2+ to diffuse evenly into tissue before reaction. It ensures labeling happens homogeneously across the whole tissue z axis (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). We do not recommend accommodating multiple tissue sections in the same tube (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nPrepare click reaction buffer without sodium ascorbate as in step 27.\nAliquot into 2 mL Eppendorf centrifuge tubes (195 μL/tube).\nTransfer tissue sections to click reaction buffer without sodium ascorbate, 1 section/tube.\nPrepare fresh 100 mM sodium ascorbate solution.\nAdd 5 μL sodium ascorbate solution to each tube (200 μL in total). Gently pipette mix to initiate click reaction (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).",
    "Place tubes on the tilted tube rack (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). 1 h reaction with gentle shaking (80 RPM), RT. Rack should be shed from light.\nQuench reaction by adding 0.5 mL, 4 mM EDTA, pH = 8, RT.\nImmediately transfer samples to PBST. Wash samples with PBST, 3 times, 10 min each, RT to remove click reaction component. Samples should be shed from light.\nStain samples with DAPI (1:3,000 dilution in PBS from 10 μM DAPI stock), 15 min, RT.\nOptional: Samples can now undergo secondary staining for protein and/or mRNA visualization.\nFAAH antibody staining.\nIncubate click labeled tissue samples in 1: 400 diluted FAAH antibody in PBST, 4°C, overnight.\nNote: For antibody staining in CLARITY-processed brain sections, blocking is not necessary (Tomer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nWash samples with PBST, 3 times, 30 min each, RT.\nIncubate samples in 1:600 diluted Alexa Fluor 488 F(ab’)2 Fragment Donkey anti-Mouse antibody in PBST, RT, overnight.\nWash samples with PBST, 3 times, 30 min each, RT.\nSomatostatin (SST) mRNA hybridization chain reaction (HCR) staining.\nIncubate click labeled tissue samples in probe hybridization buffer, 37°C, 30 min.\nTransfer samples to new probe hybridization buffer with 4 nM SST-B1 HCR probe, 37°C, overnight.\nWash samples with probe washing buffer, 3 × 30 min, 37°C.\nWash samples with 5 × SSCT, 2 × 30 min, RT.\nIncubate samples in HCR amplification buffer, 30 min, RT.\nPrepare hairpin solution in separate tubes. For every 12 μL hairpin, add 4 μL of 20 × SSC. Heat to 95°C for 90 s. Cool to RT in a dark drawer.\nAdd hairpin pairs to new HCR amplification buffer to final concentration of 120 nM.\nIncubate samples in hairpin containing amplification buffer, overnight, RT.\nWash samples with 5 × SSCT, 3 × 30 min, RT.",
    "Note: Additional information on HCR protocol can be found on www.molecularinstruments.com[href=http://www.molecularinstruments.com].\nPlace samples on a microscope slide. Carefully dry tissue sections with Kimwipe.\nImmerse sections with RapiClear for refractive index matching.\nMount slide with cover glass. Seal cover glass with nail polish and samples are ready for imaging.\nConfocal microscope imaging of prepared samples. For the listed images here, we imaged our samples with an Olympus FLUOVIEW FV3000 confocal microscope under a 10×, 0.6 NA, water immersion objective (XLUMPlanFI, Olympus), at a z step of 10 microns. Laser setting as 8% power. However, the users should determine their own parameters based on the available equipment and experimental goals.\nPause point: CLARITY-based slides can be stored in the dark at RT for at least 1 week. For longer storage, we recommend storing them at the 4°C."
