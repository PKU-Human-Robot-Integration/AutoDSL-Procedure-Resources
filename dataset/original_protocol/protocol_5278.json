Composition of Premix TaqTM solutionimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170618/20170618182819_9147.jpgNote: Reverse primer HD616-tag was designed based on the CuMMO sequences downloaded from FunGene Pipeline. We aligned the sequences and identified the conserved regions, then introduced degeneracies to cover different types of CuMMO gene sequences, developing the reverse primer HD616. A 20-nt-long tag was added to the 5’ end of both primers, A189 and HD616, to generate the tagged primers A189-tag and HD616-tag, respectively, for THDP-PCR amplification. Tag sequence was from virus genome (Canine astrovirus strain HUN/2012/115, GenBank: KX599351.1) and will not bind to bacterial genomes and thus avoids non-specific PCR amplification. Because tag is used as a single primer in the second step of the THDP-PCR, its length is set to 20 nt, a standard length for primers.Automated thermal cycler program1) Denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min2) 10 cycles at:    94 °C for 1 min    59 °C for 1 min    72 °C for 1 min3) 72 °C for 10 minNote: Conventional (one step) PCR efficiency is not satisfactory for highly degenerate primers with degeneracy higher than 48 based on our experiment. PCR clean-upPurify the entire volume (50 μl) of the first-step PCR product using an AxyPrepTM PCR Cleanup Kit (Axygen, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to remove unbound degenerate primers.Note: Unbound long tagged 3’-end unmatched degenerate primers will also bind to templates but not trigger the polymerization and thereby prevent the binding of the single tag primer to the first-step PCR products, so PCR clean-up between the two steps is necessary. Second step of THDP-PCRPCR reaction recipe.

For some low-abundance samples, try to increase the clean-up product volume to 4 μl and cycle numbers to 40.
