    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransient expression in N. benthamiana\nTiming: 2–3 days\nHere we show an example with C4-GFP and C4G2A-GFP proteins. The non-myristoylable version of the C4 protein, C4G2A, which localizes in chloroplasts exclusively, was included as control to confirm in further steps that (i) our chloroplast fractionation is working properly, and (ii) there are no changes in the stability of the chloroplast-localized proteins upon flg22 treatment.\nCulture the A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the corresponding binary vectors in 10 mL liquid LB with the appropriate antibiotics at 28°C, shaking at 180 rpm overnight (12–16 h).\nNext morning, harvest the bacteria by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min and resuspend in the infiltration buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES pH 5.6, 150 mM acetosyringone) to an OD600 = 0.2-0.6. Volume of the resuspension buffer can be adjusted according to required OD.\nIncubate the bacterial suspensions at room temperature (23°C–25°C) in dark for 2 h to allow acetosyringone to induce the expression of vir genes.\nInfiltrate into the abaxial side of leaves of four-week-old N. benthamiana plants with a 1 mL needle-less syringe. According to our experience, it is suggested to infiltrate two leaves per plant to obtain the desired levels of protein. It is recommended to use the third and fourth youngest leaves, which would be fully expanded. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1003-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves, and confirmation of protein accumulation by confocal microscopy\n(A) Selected leaves from a four-wee-old plant.\n(B) Selected leaves agroinfiltrated into the abaxial side with a 1 mL needle-less syringe.\n(C) Localization of the WT and the non-myristoylable (C4G2A) C4 versions fused to GFP. Zoom-out pictures: scale bar = 50 μm. Zoom-in pictures: scale bar = 10 μm. AF, autofluorescence.",
    "(D) Two days post-agroinfiltration, CHX is infiltrated with a 1 mL needle-less syringe into the abaxial side of the same leaves previously agroinfiltrated.\n(E) Two hours later, flg22 (or mock solution) is infiltrated with a 1 mL needle-less syringe into the abaxial side of the same leaves previously treated with CHX.\nNote: For experiments that require co-infiltration, A. tumefaciens suspensions carrying different constructs need to be mixed at a 1:1 ratio before infiltration.\nInfiltrate the suspension until the whole leaf area appears translucent. Use as much of the bacterial suspension as necessary.\nNote: After the infiltration, ensure that the infiltrated leaves do not touch each other and gently dry the excess bacterial suspension with a paper towel.\nNote: To overcome host antiviral RNA silencing, viruses encode RNA silencing suppressors (VSRs) that efficiently inhibit host antiviral responses by interacting with the key components of cellular silencing machinery. The use of VSRs is justified when the accumulation of the protein of interest is low., Therefore, co-infiltration with a silencing suppressor (e.g., P19 from the tombusvirus Tomato bushy stunt virus (Qu and Morris, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9])) is required to prevent silencing of the transgene and allow high protein accumulation.\nNote: In order to reduce the effects of plant-to-plant variation, it is recommended to express the protein of interest in at least six individual leaves from three different plants. Assays should be performed in at least three biological replicates.\nConfirmation of protein accumulation\nTiming: 2–4 h\nIt is necessary to carry out this step before continuing with the experiment to confirm that the protein of interest accumulates homogeneously in the infiltrated leaves.\nTwo days after the A. tumefaciens infiltration, cut small leaf discs from the plants expressing C4-GFP and C4G2A-GFP with a corkborer with plunger (4 mm diameter).",
    "Place the discs on a microscope slide. Put a drop of water and cover with a coverslip.\nObserve under a confocal microscope using a GFP filter with excitation/emission: 488/500–550 nm. In this work, images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) LAS-X 2.01 software using the preset settings for GFP (Ex: 488 nm, Em: 500–550 nm). See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nChloroplast can be visualized using chlorophyll autofluorescence at excitation/emission: 488/650–700 nm. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nNote: One may use any confocal microscope with the given settings.\nInhibitor and elicitor treatments\nTiming: 3–4 h\nHere, we show the example with the TYLCV C4 protein.\nTwo days after the Agrobacterium infiltration, and after verifying protein accumulation, infiltrate the N. benthamiana leaves expressing the viral protein C4-GFP with the translation inhibitor CHX (180 μM). See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nAfter 2 h of incubation, infiltrate one-half of the leaf with the PAMP flg22 (1 μM), and the other half with water as mock. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nFor protein and chloroplast isolations, harvest 6 leaves (2 leaves from each plant) after 6–8 h and proceed immediately using fresh tissue.\nFor visualization, harvest the leaf samples after 12–24 h and confirm the subcellular localization under the confocal microscope.\nNote: For steps 12 and 13, the incubation times must be adjusted according to the accumulation levels of the protein under study.\nNote: Under the working conditions indicated throughout this protocol, CHX incubations of less than 24 h did not produce a toxic effect on N. benthamiana leaves.\nProtein relocalization analysis using fluorescence microscopy\nTiming: 4–6 h\nVisualization of subcellular localization and relocalization\nTiming: 2 h\n(See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1003-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Put a drop of water and cover with a coverslip.\nObserve under a confocal microscope using GFP filter with excitation/emission: 488/500–550 nm.\nChloroplast can be visualized using chlorophyll autofluorescence at excitation/emission: 488/650–700 nm.\nThe C4 protein localizes to both plasma membrane (PM) and chloroplasts, whereas C4G2A localizes to chloroplasts only.",
    "To quantify the proportion of protein localized to PM and chloroplasts with and without elicitation by flg22, the ratio of GFP-fluorescence intensity at PM and chloroplast can be used. For this quantification, the confocal images can be analyzed using the ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/]) as described in the next section.\nAlternatives: For step 19 and further, the open-source image processing package Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ; https://fiji.sc/[href=https://fiji.sc/]) can be used as well. Note: For step 14, elicitation time must be adjusted for every protein of interest.\nQuantification of protein subcellular localization using ImageJ\nTiming: 2–4 h\n(See Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1003-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

All images should have the same channel. Click on “Image” menu in the toolbar and make sure that “Green” (if your proteins are tagged to GFP) is selected among “Lookup Tables (LUT)” options.\nNext, click on the “Process” menu in the toolbar and select “Substract Background”. Unclick all the options and set 50 by default.\nThen, click on “Image” in the toolbar, select “Adjust”, and click on “Brightness/Contrast”. Set same value for all images.",
    "In the toolbar, click on the “Hand lens” icon. Then, set a defined “Region of Interest” (ROI) size in the “ROI Manager menu”, save, and apply to all images during analysis.\nThen check the “Grey Mean Value” icon in the “Set Measurements” icon of the “Analyze” menu in the toolbar.\nClick “Measure” under the “Analyze” menu to get the intensity values.\nExport the values of the selected areas into a spreadsheet.\nCalculate the final relative quantification values as the ratio of PM to chloroplast fluorescence intensity.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. A step-by-step video with the quantification of the protein subcellular localization using ImageJ, related to step 20\nBiochemical analysis of protein relocalization\nTiming: 3–4 days\nChloroplast isolation\nTiming: 4–5 h\nCritical: For isolation of intact chloroplasts (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), use fresh tissue. Do not freeze the samples.\nNote: Check the expression of the GFP-tagged protein by confocal microscopy prior to chloroplast isolation.\nNote: Carry out the chloroplast isolation in low or dim light (20 μmol m−2 s−1).\nNote: It is better to perform the experiment in a cold room, if possible. Otherwise, keep everything at 4°C; solutions, rotors, equipment pre-cooled to 4°C; centrifugations should be performed at 4°C (unless otherwise indicated).\nNote: Plant leaf materials should be collected into a beaker placed on ice.\nNote: Use wide-bore 1 mL tips for the isolation of chloroplasts. Cut 2 mm off the tip of 1 mL pipetman tips using a razor blade, autoclave and dry them.\nNote: Please refer to (Dogra et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Kauss et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nGrind the tissue (around 6 leaves of four-weeks-old N. benthamiana plants in 50 mL of isolation buffer in a Waring blender (3 times, each for 3 s).",
    "Filter the homogenate through 4 layers of Miracloth into a 50 mL polypropylene tube and centrifuge at 400 × g for 8 min. Collect the pellet and resuspend in 1 mL of isolation buffer.\nAlternatives: In case of using Arabidopsis transgenic plants, rosette leaves of 50 to 60 3-weeks-old plants should be used for chloroplasts isolation.\nNote: If using more than one tube, suspend the pellet of each tube in approximately 250 μl isolation buffer and pool all the suspensions together.\nLoad approximately 500–1000 μL of chloroplast suspension on the two-step Percoll gradient. Centrifuge in a swing-out rotor at 200 × g for 20 min with brakes off.\nRemove broken chloroplasts and Percoll till the layer of intact chloroplasts between the two Percoll steps. Take intact chloroplasts using a wide-bore tip, place into 50 mL tube (chloroplasts from several gradients can be combined), fill with HS buffer up to 50 mL invert the tube several times, and centrifuge at 400 × g for 6 min.\nResuspend the chloroplast pellet in another 50 mL of HS buffer and centrifuge at 400 × g in for 6 min. Resuspend chloroplast pellet in 1 mL of HS buffer.\nTake a 10 μL aliquot, add 990 μL of 80% acetone to it, vortex, centrifuge for 5 min at 21,000 × g at room temperature (23°C–25°C). Take clear supernatant and measure OD652 using quartz or glass cuvette. Calculate chlorophyll concentration as:\nChl (mg/mL) = (OD652 × dilution factor)/36\nIn our case, the dilution factor was 100. This normalization will be used in all downstream experiments.",
    "For the lysis of the intact chloroplasts, take such a volume intact chloroplasts suspension that corresponds to a desired amount of chlorophyll, (you can take intact chloroplasts corresponding to 200 μg of chlorophyll amount as shown in #26) and pellet down at 2600 × g for 5 min. Resuspend the pellet in 150 μL of HM buffer and keep on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 2600 × g for 5 min. Separate the supernatant as stroma fraction (150 μL) and the pellet as membrane (envelopes and thylakoids) fraction. Remove contaminants by washing the membrane fraction with HS buffer.\nProtein isolation from plant tissue and isolated chloroplasts and western blotting\nTiming: 1–2 days\n(See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nFor isolating total proteins from fresh plant tissue and total proteins from isolated chloroplasts:\nCollect 2 leaf discs with an 8-mm punch from each leaf (usually 6 leaves from 3 plants in case of N. benthamiana) to be used for total protein isolation. Grind the leaf discs in liquid nitrogen and collect in 2 mL tubes. Keep the tubes at −80°C or in liquid nitrogen, and wait until chloroplasts are isolated (as described in steps 21–28).\nIsolate intact chloroplast from the leaves from which leaf discs are extracted (as described in steps 21–28).\nResuspend the chloroplast pellet from (b), corresponding to 1000 μg of chlorophyll (concentration usually 1 μg/ul), in 1 mL protein extraction buffer.\nResuspend the leaf disc powder from (a) in 500 ul protein extraction buffer.\nIncubate the tubes from (c) and (d) for 30 min on a revolver lab rotator at 4°C.\nCentrifuge at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Collect the supernatant in a new tube and repeat the centrifugation step.\nFinal supernatants collected from the tubes from (c) and (d) represent chloroplast and total proteins, respectively.",
    "Take 150 μL of total and chloroplast protein samples and add 50 μL of 4× Laemmli sample buffer to make the final volume to 200 μL. Denature at 95°C for 10 min.\nLoad equal amounts of the solubilized protein fractions on 10% SDS-PAGE gels.\nTransfer the gel to the PVDF membranes via wet or semi-dry transfer methods.\nThe target protein can be visualized using the specific antibody (tag-specific antibody, if the target protein is fused to tag). Light-harvesting complex proteins (LhcBs) and Rubisco large subunit proteins (RbcL) can be used as membrane and stroma marker proteins, respectively, and can be detected using specific antibodies commercially available (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Stain the gel with CBB and the membrane with Ponceau S staining to confirm equal loading.\nQuantification of proteins bands in western blots using ImageJ\nTiming: 2 h\n(See Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1003-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

(2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\n(B) Analysis of the signal intensity values obtained from the protein samples (WB) relative to the corresponding loading control (CBB).\nThis section will allow you to quantify the intensity of protein bands from western blots with the ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/]). The quantification will retrieve the relative amounts as a ratio of each protein band relative to the corresponding loading control band (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nBefore starting, make sure you make a copy of your original raw images, save them as JPEG file format, and transform the images mode to “Grayscale”. As reference, Photoshop (or similar software) may be used in this step.",
    "Set up the measurement criteria you will apply to all the blots to analyze. In the toolbar, click on the “Analyze” menu and select “Set Measurements”. From the checkboxes, keep only the “Mean gray value” checked.\nNext, click on the “File” menu in the toolbar, and open the JPEG file images generated previously. Maximize the window and adjust an appropriate zoom level.\nSet a defined “Region of Interest” (ROI) size according to the largest band among the target bands of a sample on the blot. In the toolbar, click on the “Analyze” menu, and next on “Tools”. Then, set a defined “Region of Interest” (ROI) size in the “ROI Manager menu”. Select the “rectangle” tool and draw a frame around the largest band. Adjust the size of the frame so that it covers the minimum area. Click the “File” menu in the toolbar, “Save as”, “Selection” and save this frame. Use the same frame for all the protein bands you need to analyze from the same blot. If you accidentally resize the frame or lose it, go to the “File” menu, “Open”, and reimport the same frame again.\nPut the frame so that the band is inside, click the “Analyze” menu, “Measure”, and get the intensity values. Move the frame to the following bands and repeat this step in order to get the intensity values for all the samples.\nNext, export the values into a spreadsheet keeping track of which value corresponds to which sample.\nRepeat the steps “e” and “f” to take a background measurement using the same frame as for the protein bands. Put the frame above or below every band on the row where there are no other bands, get the intensity values, and export into the spreadsheet.",
    "For the loading control bands, repeat the same steps (“e” to “g”) as described for the sample bands.\nWith all the values in the spreadsheet, you can proceed to do the calculations.\nApply the formula 255 – X, where X is the intensity value recorded for each band or loading control and their respective background values, to invert the pixel density for all data.\nNext, calculate the net value for the protein bands and the loading controls by deducting the inverted background value from the inverted band value calculated in “a”.\nFinally, calculate the relative value as the ratio of a net band value over the corresponding net loading control.\nNote: Save high-resolution images or scans from the blots or films, respectively (600 dpi in TIFF file format is recommended). Save them as raw images, and do not save any change over these original files.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. A step-by-step video with the quantification of protein bands in wetern blots using ImageJ, related to step 34\nImmunoprecipitation-based detection of low abundant proteins\nTiming: 4–5 h\nNote: We recommend carrying out this section if the accumulation of the protein of interest is too low.\nIsolate total proteins and total chloroplast proteins as described above.\nFilter the isolated proteins through a 0.22 μm Millipore Express PES membrane.\nQuantify the proteins using standard protocols, e.g., the PierceTM BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nPrepare the isolated protein as the Input samples: take 150 μL of isolated chloroplast protein samples and add 50 μL of 4× Laemmli sample buffer to make the final volume to 200 μL. Denature at 95°C for 10 min.",
    "Take the desired amount of protein (ideally 2–10 mg) and add 25 μL of antibody-conjugated beads, e.g., GFP-Trap Agarose beads (ChromoTek) in the case of GFP-tagged target protein.\nIncubate the samples with agitation at 4°C for 1.5–2 h.\nCentrifuge at 2500 × g for 30 s.\nTake out the supernatant and wash the beads four times for 5 min with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100).\nElute the bound proteins in 100 μL 1× Laemmli SDS sample buffer with incubation for 20 min at 70°C.\nLoad equal amounts of the input and IP-eluted samples on 10% SDS-PAGE gels (for detecting bait (target) protein, load 10 μL, whereas for the prey (interactor) the loading can vary depending upon the interaction strength and the protein abundance.\nTransfer the gel to the PVDF membranes via wet or semi-dry transfer methods.\nThe protein of interest can be visualized using a specific antibody or a tag-specific antibody (e.g., anti-GFP antibody), if the target protein is fused to a tag. Stain the gel with CBB and the membrane with Ponceau S to show equal loading.\nQuantification can be done as described in steps 34 and 35."
