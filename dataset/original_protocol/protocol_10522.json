    "A general diagram of the operation procedure is provided in Figure 1. Using ethical practices, we collected blood samples from healthy subjects, and obtained aqueous humor samples from patients through the Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH), Taichung, Taiwan under IRB approved protocols (IRB TCVGH No. CF11213-1).\n1. Fabrication of Paper Devices\nCut chromatography paper into circles of 5 mm in diameter to provide the same layout as a 96-well microtiter plate. Sandwich these paper pieces with two polystyrene sheets with registered through-holes, and laminate.\nModify paper devices using the chemical conjugation method described in the following steps28.\n\t\nTreat paper devices with oxygen plasma (100 mW, 1% oxygen, 30 sec) in a plasma chamber.\n\t\tCAUTION: Special caution must be taken when working with 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane and N-γ-maleimidobutyryloxy succinimide ester (GMBS), since they are both moisture sensitive and toxic. Wear protective gloves and avoid inhalation or contact with skin and eyes. Keep the stock bottle tightly closed and allow it to equilibrate to RT before opening to avoid water condensation. Alternatively, open the stock bottle inside a nitrogen-filled glove bag or box. Aliquot into small vials to avoid frequent opening of the stock bottle.\nImmediately incubate treated paper devices in a 4% (v/v) solution of 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane in ethanol (200 proof) for 30 min.\nRinse paper devices with ethanol and incubate them with 0.01 μmol/ml GMBS in ethanol for 15 min.\nRinse with ethanol (200 proof) and incubate paper devices with 10 µg/ml avidin solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hr at 4 °C. Store at 4 °C if needed, and use within 4 weeks.",
    "Wet each paper test zones with 10 μl PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 3 × 10 min before spotting 10 μl biotinylated capture molecules for 3 × 10 min. Use anti-CD63 antibody (20 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.09% (w/v) sodium azide) or annexin V (1:20, v/v in annexin V binding buffer) as capture molecules.\nRinse off unbound anti-CD63 antibody or annexin V molecules using 10 μl corresponding PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA or annexin V binding buffer solutions for 3 × 1 min, respectively.\n2. Serum and Aqueous Humor Sample Collection and Processing\nSerum collection.\n\t\nCollect 10 ml of peripheral blood by venipuncture in serum separation tubes and gently invert the tube five times. Set the tube in a vertical position and wait for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 1,200 × g for 15 min. Transfer the serum from the top layer to a clean tube, and centrifuge again at 3,000 × g for 30 min.\nPass the supernatant through a 0.8 μm filter. Keep the sample at -80 °C until use.\nAqueous humor collection: collect aqueous humor samples from patients diagnosed by an ophthalmologist directly through invasive procedures and store samples at -80 °C until use.\n3. Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles\nSpot samples onto each paper test zone at a rate of 5 μl/min.\nRinse off unbound EVs with 10 μl corresponding PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA or annexin V binding buffer solutions for 3 × 1 min for paper devices functionalized with anti-CD63 antibody or annexin V molecules, respectively. Perform the following downstream assays.\n4. Downstream Assay Example 1: Scanning Electromicrographs\nFix EVs captured on functionalized paper test zone using 10 μl 0.5× Karnovsky’s fixative for 10 min.\nRinse the samples with ample PBS for 2 × 5 min.",
    "Dehydrate the samples with subsequent 35% ethanol for 10 min, 50% ethanol for 2 × 10 min, 70% ethanol for 2 × 10 min, 95% ethanol for 2 × 10 min, and 100% ethanol for 4 × 10 min.\nCritical dry and sputter coat the samples with palladium/gold, and examine using an scanning electron microscope operated at low electron acceleration voltage (~ 5 kV).\n5. Downstream Assay Example 2: Paper-based ELISA\nAdd a 5 μl solution containing anti-CD9 primary antibody at 1:1,000 dilution in PBS to each test zone containing captured EVs. Wait 1  min.\nRinse the samples with 30 ml PBS shaken at 100 rpm for 30 sec.\nAdd a 5 μl solution containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary antibody at 1:1,000 dilution in PBS and wait 1 min.\nRinse the samples with 30 ml PBS shaken at 100 rpm for 30 sec.\nAdd a 5 μl colorimetric substrate containing 1:1 volume ratio of hydrogen peroxide and 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and scan using a desktop scanner.\n6. Downstream Assay Example 3: RNA Isolation\nImmerse the samples in 35 μl of polyvinylpyrrolidone-based RNA isolation aid and 265 μl of lysis/binding buffer to lyse EVs captured. Vortex vigorously.\nAdd 30 μl homogenate provided in the isolation kit to the lysate. Vortex vigorously and put on ice for 10 min.\nExtract the RNA using acid phenol-chloroform separation described in the following steps.\n\t\nTake 330 μl of phenol-chloroform from the bottom layer of the bottle and add to the homogenate/lysate. Vortex vigorously.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 min. Transfer the aqueous (upper) phase to a clean tube and note the volume removed.",
    "Precipitate the total RNA with 100% ethanol of the volume that is 1.25 times the volume of the aqueous phase removed in the previous step and collect the RNA in the elution solution preheated to 95 °C.\nConcentrate and further purify the RNA using an RNA cleanup kit according to the manufacture’s protocol.\nSubscription Required.
