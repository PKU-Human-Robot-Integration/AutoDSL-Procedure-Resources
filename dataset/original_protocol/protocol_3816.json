    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHarvest and preparation of pooled donor cecal material\nTiming: 2.5 h\nPreparation of cecal suspension under anaerobic conditions for inoculation into germ-free mice. The commensal gut microbiota is dominated by anaerobic bacteria. Processing of donor material under strict anaerobic conditions is therefore essential in maintaining viability across constituent taxa. The time duration indicated for this section is an approximate for processing the ceca of three to five mice of the same group.\nPerform humane killing of mice according to ethics approval.\nPosition mouse in a supine position and perform a vertical midline incision to expose the gastrointestinal organs.\nDissect cecum from the gastrointestinal tract using a sterile scalpel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] ).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/734-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dissection of cecum in donor mice\nCecum is isolated from the gastrointestinal tract by performing a horizontal dissection at the junction between the cecum and the ileum, and between the cecum and colon, as indicated by the green dotted lines. The dissection section of the gastrointestinal tract should be within 0.5 cm of the cecum. A longitudinal incision is performed on the cecum (black dotted lines) for cecal material collection. Image of the mouse gastrointestinal tract is adapted from (Treuting et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nPerform a horizontal dissection at the junction between the cecum and ileum (0.5 cm from cecum).\nPerform a horizontal dissection at the junction between the cecum and colon (0.5 cm from cecum).\nTransfer cecum into a 10 mL Falcon tube containing 5 mL of pre-reduced 15% glycerol.\nIn an anaerobic chamber, place the cecum onto a sterile petri dish to harvest cecal material from the tissue encasing.\nPerform a longitudinal incision on the cecum using a sterile scalpel to expose cecal material.",
    "Use a sterile spatula to scrape and transfer cecal material into a pre-weighed empty 50 mL Falcon tube.\nRepeat this process for the remaining ceca from mice belonging to the same donor group.\nPool all cecal material into the pre-weighed 50 mL Falcon tube.\nRecord weight of the 50 mL Falcon tube containing the cecal material and determine net weight.\nDilute cecal sample in 4× volume of pre-reduced PBS.\nFor example, use 400 μL of PBS for every 100 mg cecum material.\nVortex cecal mixture for 1 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension.\nUse a pipette tip to disperse large pieces of material where necessary.\nPlace a 100 μm cell strainer onto a fresh sterile 50 mL Falcon tube (“suspension tube”).\nPipette the cecal material onto the cell strainer.\nAllow the cecal suspension (supernatant) to flow into the 50 mL Falcon tube for 5 min.\nUse a sterile pestle to extract remaining supernatant in the cell strainer.\nDiscard the cell strainer containing the remaining cecal material.\nDilute the cecal suspension with 1× volume of pre-reduced 30% glycerol.\nUsing a sterile syringe and 23G needle, draw up the cecal suspension from the “suspension tube” and transfer cecal suspension into a sealed Hungate tube.\nAliquot the appropriate volume of cecal suspension into separate Hungate tubes.\nAllocate one Hungate tube per cage for each gavage day.\nStore cecal suspension at −80°C until use.\nNote: Ideally, the dissected ceca in 15% glycerol should be processed immediately after harvest to obtain cecal suspension, in order to reduce freeze-thaw of cecal material. Freeze-thaw may affect the viability of bacteria as detailed in the limitations section. Where not possible, the dissected ceca can be stored in its entirety in 15% glycerol at −80°C, and preparation of cecal suspension should be performed as soon as possible.",
    "Note: Use a wide-bore tip when pipetting cecal material (steps 8 and 9) to prevent blockage. All material and reagents used should be sterile and aseptic technique practiced throughout.\nAnaerobic conditions should be maintained throughout the processing of donor material.\nNote: The total volume of cecal suspension to aliquot into separate Hungate tubes (step 13a) is calculated based on (n × 75 μL) + 200 μL. ‘n’ denotes the number of mice per cage. The addition of 200 μL to the total cecal suspension volume is to ensure sufficient volume of material for oral gavage per cage.\nNote: Pooled material from three ceca per group should provide sufficient material to perform the gut microbiota colonization step on 15 to 20 mice per group.\nPause Point: Cecal suspension in Hungate tube can be kept frozen at −80°C until required for instillation into germ-free mice.\nCritical: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw of cecal suspensions to prevent loss of bacterial viability.\nGut microbiota colonization of germ-free mice using cecal suspension\nTiming: 7 days\nOral gavage of germ-free mice with cecal suspension is performed to achieve gut microbiota establishment.\nThaw Hungate tubes containing aliquots of the donor cecal suspension on ice on bench top (approximately 30 mins).\nTransport germ-free mice, sterile pre-reduced PBS in Hungate tube, and cecal suspension in Hungate tube, into a sterilized biosafety cabinet in the germ-free animal facility.\nDilute cecal suspension in Hungate tube using 2× volume of sterile pre-reduced PBS.\nAdd the required volume of PBS (in Hungate tube) into the Hungate tube containing cecal suspension using a sterile syringe and 23G needle.\nVortex the diluted cecal suspension for 1 min.\nPerform oral gavage using 150 μL of the cecal suspension according to institutional animal research facility safety operating practices (SOPs).",
    "Draw up cecal suspension using a sterile syringe and 23G needle.\nReplace 23G needle with a gavage needle for oral gavage.\nRepeat steps 16–18 for oral gavage at day 4 and day 7.\nOptional: Collect fecal sample from individual mice prior to oral gavage at day 0, day 4, day 7, and appropriate time points thereafter for fecal DNA quantitation. Fresh fecal samples are collected using a sterile toothpick into a sterile 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube. DNA extraction from fecal samples can be performed using the QIAGEN DNeasy PowerLyzer PowerSoil kit, or an equivalent DNA extraction kit. Quantitation of the extracted DNA can be performed using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit, or an equivalent fluorometric quantification assay. For high stringency bacterial DNA determination, quantitative PCR of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene can be performed on the extracted DNA samples, as described in Choo and Rogers, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nOptional: Gut microbiota composition of colonized germ-free mice can be determined using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine similarity to the donor gut microbiota, as described in Choo and Rogers, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nNote: Place thawed Hungate tube containing cecal suspension on ice on bench top until transported into the biosafety cabinet. Thawed cecal suspension can be kept at room temperature in the biosafety cabinet and should be used within 2.5h for oral gavage.\nNote: All procedures should be performed in a cleaned biosafety cabinet according to germ-free animal techniques. Prior to transfer of equipment into the biosafety cabinet, the external surfaces of all equipment should be sterilized using a suitable disinfectant solution according to animal facility SOPs. It is recommended to use one Hungate tube per cage to minimize the risk of contamination.\nNote: Where animal research facility SOP for oral gavage is not available, a reference for the procedure is available at https://ouv.vt.edu/content/dam/ouv_vt_edu/sops/small-animal-biomedical/sop-mouse-oral-gavage.pdf[href=https://ouv.vt.edu/content/dam/ouv_vt_edu/sops/small-animal-biomedical/sop-mouse-oral-gavage.pdf]"
