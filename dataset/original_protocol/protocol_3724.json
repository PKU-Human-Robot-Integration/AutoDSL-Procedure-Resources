    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nWe typically use mouse pluripotent stem cells from passage (P)11 to P25 for differentiation. At least three passages are needed after cell revival for efficient differentiation. For routine maintenance of pluripotent stem cells lines, please follow Steps 1–9 of D0 experiments. Mouse pluripotent stem cells are cultured in maintenance medium with a density of 60%–80% in T25 flask intended for Day 0. Reduce manipulation time as much as possible to alleviate cellular stress and to avoid degradation of reconstituted media.\nDay 0: Cell Dissociation and Seedling\nTiming: 1.5 h\nAdd β-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) to ES medium, maintenance medium, and retinal differentiation medium to make a final concentration of 55 μM.\nAspirate ES medium from T25 flasks, wash once with PBS.\nRinse flasks with 1 mL prewarmed TrypLE and incubate with another 1 mL TrypLE for 3 min at 37°C.\nCritical: Check the flasks at 2 min 40 s. If most cells detach from the flasks after gentle tapping, proceed to the next step immediately. DO NOT exceed 3 min. Prolonged incubation with TrypLE is detrimental to the cells.\nAlternatives: If some cell lines appear to be more difficult to dissociate, 0.05% Trypsin can be used as a substitute.\nAdd 6 mL ES medium into each flask, gently pipet up and down for 15 times, and transfer the cells to a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nCritical: Avoid bubbles during pipetting.\nNote: Mouse pluripotent stem cells may be difficult to dissociate in the first or two splits after revival. Use 70μm Cell Strainer to remove cell clumps after pipetting. DO NOT extend the incubation time with dissociating reagents.\nCentrifuge at 180 g for 5 min at 22 –25°C. If feeder-free culture system is used, aspirate the supernatant and proceed to Step 9.",
    "Note: We typically use a feeder system for mouse pluripotent stem cells for maintaining cell quality and pluripotency. Multiple passages are required to adapt mouse pluripotent stem cells from feeder to feeder-free system, especially for induced pluripotent stem cells, and the differentiation capacity may be altered after the adaptation. We note that commercially available feeder cells are expensive, the generation of feeder cells from fibroblasts is labor-intensive, and the use of feeder cells brings further variations to stem cell cultures. The reader can consider which system to use based on budget, cell quality, stability and pluripotency, as well as the workload.\nIf feeder-culture system is used, resuspend the pellet in 4 mL of maintenance medium.\nTransfer the cells to a T25 flask and incubate at 37°C for 20 min to adhere feeder cells to the flask.\nCollect the medium containing the floating cells from the flask into a 15-mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 0.25 x 106 (for 3-day culture) or 0.5 x 106 cells (for 2-day culture) in 8 mL of maintenance media to a new T25 flask to maintain the cell line.\nNote: Use T25 flask with feeder cells for feeder-system cultures. For feeder-free system, use T25 flask coated with 0.1% gelatin.\nAdd 8 mL retinal differentiation medium.\nCentrifuge at 180 g for 3 min at 22 –25°C.\nRemove the supernatant, tap to loosen the cell pellet, and resuspend the cells in retinal differentiation medium.\nNote: Amount of medium depends on the size of pellet. We resuspend 100 μL cell pellet in 10–12 mL differentiation medium.\nFilter the cells with 40 μm cell strainer.\nCount the number of cells by hemocytometer.\nNote: Count the four quadrants at the four corners and divide the final number by four = __x104 cells/mL for enhanced accuracy.",
    "Adjust the concentration to 3– 5 x 104 cells/mL with retinal differentiation medium.\nNote: Most of the cell lines we differentiate show optimal differentiation efficiency at a density of 3 x 104 cells/mL (3000 cells in one well of 96-well plate). However, some cell lines require a different density. Depending on cell lines, optimization may be needed for optimal plating density.\nPlate 100 μL cells into each well of a U-bottom ultra-low attachment 96-well plate. Pipet in reagent reservoir. Avoid bubbles by pipetting along wall of U-bottom 96-well plate.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C under 5% O 2 and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nCritical: Day 0–7 are critical for differentiation. AVOID oxygen levels over 8%.\nDay 1. Addition of Matrigel\nTiming: 2 h\nChill pipet tips, serological pipets, reagent reservoirs at −20°C for at least 30 min.\nAdd 2-ME to retinal differentiation medium to reach a final concentration of 55 μM and place on ice.\nThaw Matrigel aliquots on ice (at least 1 h).\nNote: Depending on the stock concentration, each aliquot contains ∼240 μL Matrigel for one 96-well plate.\nAfter Matrigel is dissolved, add 900 μL cold retinal differentiation medium into each tube of Matrigel aliquots. Transfer 1140 μL Matrigel/media to the reservoir. Rinse the tube with another 900 μL cold retinal differentiation medium and transfer to the reservoir. Mix well with a chilled serological pipet.\nUsing chilled tips, add 20 μL diluted Matrigel to each well.\nCritical: When adding Matrigel, position the tips at the surface of media in each well. Do not put the tip too deep into wells to avoid disruption of embryoid bodies. Avoid adding Matrigel along the walls of each well as it may stick to the surface (Figure 1 [href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/65-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Illustrative Diagram for Adding Matrigel to D1 Embryoid Bodies (EB)\nDay 7. Transfer Organoids to Suspension Culture\nTiming: 30 min–1 h\nPipet retinal organoids from a 96-well plate into a 15 mL tube using a 2 mL serological pipette. Transfer 12 wells at a time (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/65-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustrative Diagram of D7 Retinal Organoid (RO) Transfer\nAlternatives: Cut open a P1000 tip and transfer the organoids using P1000 pipetman.\nLet organoids settle to the bottom of the tube at 22–25°C and remove the media, leaving organoids in ∼2 mL media.\nNote: The time for organoids to settle depends on the amount of Matrigel taken during the transfer but it usually takes around 5 min. If the organoids do not settle, add 4 ml retina maturation medium (RMM) I supplemented with 55 μM 2-ME into the tube to dilute the Matrigel and facilitate this process.\nResuspend organoids in 10 mL 22– 25°C retina maturation medium (RMM) I supplemented with 55 μM 2-ME.\nLet organoids settle to the bottom of tube at 22–25°C (∼2 min). Remove 10 mL media. Resuspend the organoids in 6 mL RMM I with 55 μM 2-ME and transfer to a 10 cm2 polyHEMA-coated dish. Rinse the tube with another 6 mL of RMM I with 55 μM 2-ME and transfer to the same dish.\nIncubate the dish at 37°C under 5% O2 and 5% CO2.\nDay 10. Media Change for Retinal Organoids\nTiming: 30 min\nReconstitute RMM I warmed to 22– 25°C with 1 mM taurine, 20 ng/mL IGF1, 55 μM 2-ME, 26 μM DHA and 0.5 μM 9-cis retinal.\nCritical: Turn off the light of the hood to avoid isomerization of 9-cis retinal.\nCritical: Use the reconstituted RMM I as soon as possible (maximum 3 h).",
    "Transfer all organoids to a 15-mL centrifuge tube with the 12 mL media using a 10 mL serological pipet (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/65-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Illustrative Diagram Showing Key Steps in Changing Media for D10 Retinal Organoids\nNote: Position the tip of the serological pipet in the middle of the centrifuge tube and release the organoids slowly to avoid damage to tissue integrity.\nWhile the organoids are settling down to the bottom at 22–25°C (∼ 2 min), add 10 mL reconstituted RMM I to the dish.\nUsing a 2 mL serological pipet, position the tip to the bottom of the centrifuge tube and transfer the settled organoids back to the dish together with ∼ 2 mL media. Gently swirl the dish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nSlightly tilt the dish, wait for 30 s for the organoids to settle and transfer ∼10 mL media to a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Avoid picking up any organoid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nAdd another 10 mL reconstituted RMM I to the dish.\nCheck the 15 mL centrifuge tube for organoids. Discard the tube if there are no organoids inside. Transfer the organoids to the dish as described above if there are any. Return the dish to 37°C under 5% O2 and 5% CO2.\nPerform half-media change every alternate day.\nNote: After D12, badly differentiated organoids can be removed, and sticking organoids can be separated under the microscope. We culture 10–16 organoids in 12–14 mL reconstituted RMM I in a 10 cm2 polyHEMA-coated dish. Avoid putting too many organoids in a single plate.\nDay 26. Media Change for Retinal Organoids\nTiming: 30 min\nReconstitute RMM II warmed to 22– 25°C with 1 mM taurine, 20 ng/ml IGF1, 55 μM 2-ME, 200 ng/mL FGF1 and 0.5 μM 9-cis retinal.",
    "Critical: Turn off the light of the hood to avoid isomerization of 9-cis retinal.\nCritical: Use the reconstituted RMM II as soon as possible (maximum 3 h).\nSlightly tilt the dish, remove ∼10 mL media. Avoid taking any organoids.\nAdd 10 mL reconstituted RMM II.\nReturn the dish to 37°C under 5% O2  and 5% CO2.\nPerform half-media change every other day."
