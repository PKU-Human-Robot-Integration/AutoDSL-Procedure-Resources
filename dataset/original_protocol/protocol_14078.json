    "This protocol was approved by the ethics review board of the Saitama Municipal Hospital. The patient, whose case study is presented, provided written informed consent for the publication of his case and accompanying case images.\n1. Set-up for PCLeB\nWhen starting coronary angiography (CAG), prepare the manifold for PCLeB. Connect one inlet line of the manifold to a contrast medium bottle and another inlet line to a 500 mL bottle of lactated Ringer’s solution mixed with 500 U of heparin sodium (Figure 2).\nPerform CAG and pinpoint the occluded lesion. After finishing CAG, introduce a guiding catheter, which is connected to the manifold via a Y-connector, into the aorta and engage it in the ostium of the culprit coronary artery as usual.\nStart wiring procedures with a balloon catheter placed inside the guiding catheter close to its outlet.\nIf the coronary flow is incidentally restarted with the passage of the wire through the occluded lesion, move the balloon catheter quickly toward the culprit lesion to re-occlude the lesion site. After re-occluding the lesion site, resume and finish the wiring procedures.\nNOTE: Such incidental coronary reflow sometimes happens; therefore, the balloon catheter is placed inside the guiding catheter during the wiring procedures.\nAfter finishing the wiring procedures, move the balloon catheter forward and place the balloon at the occluded lesion. Check the position of the balloon by contrast medium injection, to see if the balloon is appropriately placed at the occluded lesion.\nNOTE: After finishing the checking of the balloon position, naturally, the contrast medium fills all the lumen from the manifold to the tip of the guiding catheter.\nDisconnect the syringe injector from the manifold and connect a 30 mL syringe to the manifold instead, which is used for lactated Ringer’s solution injection.",
    "NOTE: No special syringe is needed for replacing the syringe, but an ordinary syringe for normal usage is fine as long as it has a ≥30 mL volume and a lock connector, so it will not be disconnected from the manifold during rapid injections of lactated Ringer’s solution.\nFill the 30 mL syringe with 20–30 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution by sucking it from the bottle of lactated Ringer’s solution through the line connected to the inlet of the manifold.\nRemove air bubbles inside the 30 mL syringe if present. Disconnect the syringe and push them out and re-connect it to the manifold. Suck lactated Ringer’s solution from the bottle to make up the amount used for pushing air bubbles out.\nNOTE: Here, the default set-up of the injection system for PCLeB has been completed; that is, the contrast medium (approximately 4 mL) fills all the lumen from the manifold to the tip of the guiding catheter, and 20–30 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution fills the 30 mL syringe connected to the manifold.\n2. Details of PCLeB Procedures\nOnce the balloon catheter is placed at the occluded lesion and the default set-up of the injection system is completed, inflate the balloon for 20–30 s at low pressure.\nDeflate the balloon and start the initial 10 s brief reperfusion. Immediately push out all the contrast medium (approximately 4 mL) prefilled in the lumen from the manifold to the tip of the guiding catheter, by injecting ≥4 mL of 20–30 mL of the lactated Ringer’s solution prefilled in the 30 mL syringe into the guiding catheter, to see if the coronary flow is recovered.\nNOTE: Approximately 4 mL of contrast medium is usually enough to confirm coronary flow recovery.",
    "If the coronary flow is recovered, replenish the syringe with the same amount of lactated Ringer’s solution used for pushing the contrast medium out by sucking the solution from the bottle connected to the manifold through an inlet line, to prepare for lactated Ringer’s solution injection at the end of reperfusion. Jump to step 2.7.\nNOTE: If coronary flow recovery is not observed, the true occluded lesion may be located distal to the current location of the balloon. Go to step 2.4.\nEmpty the syringe by injecting all the lactated Ringer’s solution into the coronary artery.\nFill the syringe with 4 mL of the contrast medium by sucking it from the bottle connected to the manifold through an inlet line and inject it all to the guiding catheter to fill the lumen. Then, fill up the syringe with 20–30 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution by sucking it from the bottle of the lactated Ringer’s solution connected to the manifold through an inlet line.\nNOTE: Here, the default set-up of the injection system for PCLeB has been re-established.\nMove the balloon distally to the true lesion, and repeat the same procedures described in 2.1–2.6.\nOnce coronary flow recovery is observed, and the balloon is confirmed to be placed at the culprit lesion, keep the balloon there throughout the PCLeB procedures.\nNOTE: The desirable balloon size may be the same as the lesion diameter. By selecting such balloon size, instead of a smaller-sized balloon, the coronary flow may not be hampered by the deflated balloon left at the lesion site during each brief repetitive reperfusion.",
    "Start lactated Ringer’s solution injection (20 mL for the right coronary artery and 30 mL for the left coronary artery) directly into the culprit coronary artery through the guiding catheter 4–5 s before the end of each brief reperfusion.\nNOTE: Usually, it takes 5–7 s to inject 20–30 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution, which may overlap with the subsequent brief ischemic period; this is an intentional delay. The aim of this intentional delay is to ensure that the lactate is trapped inside the ischemic myocardium.\nIn the middle of lactated Ringer’s solution injection, let the secondary operator start balloon inflation so that the balloon inflation is completed a little before completion of lactated Ringer’s solution injection.\nNOTE: This maneuver is intended so that the final small amount of lactated Ringer’s solution (ideally 2–3 mL) injected into the culprit coronary artery is bounced back from the inflated balloon. Through this approach, the lactated Ringer’s solution can be injected into the ischemic myocardium until the last moment of the balloon inflation process. This procedure requires cooperation between the primary operator who injects the lactated Ringer’s solution and the secondary operator who inflates the balloon.\nReestablish the default set-up of the injection system, as described in 2.5., during 60 s ischemia for the next brief reperfusion.\nDeflate the balloon and start the next 10 s longer reperfusion after 60 s ischemia. Push out all the contrast medium prefilled in the lumen from the manifold to the tip of the guiding catheter, to reconfirm coronary flow.\nIf the balloon is found not to be placed at the center of the lesion site, adjust the balloon position.",
    "NOTE: This might be done during the first 10 s reperfusion, but it can be postponed until the next 20 s reperfusion because the 10 s duration may be slightly very short to do it.\nStart lactated Ringer’s solution injection into the culprit coronary artery through the guiding catheter 4–5 s before the end of each brief reperfusion\nIn the middle of lactated Ringer’s solution injection, let the secondary operator start balloon inflation so that the balloon inflation is completed a little before completion of lactated Ringer’s solution injection.\nReestablish the default set-up of the injection system during 60 s ischemia.\nRepeat these brief ischemia and reperfusion sequences seven times until 60 s reperfusion is performed twice (Figure 1).\nNOTE: These procedures can be performed without disconnecting the 30 mL syringe from the manifold. The balloon inflation pressure can be increased gradually throughout the procedures, but high pressure is not recommended.\n3. Alternative Default Set-up\nNOTE: There may be an alternative to the default set-up, where replacing the syringe injector with a 30 mL syringe is not needed.\nAfter finishing the wiring procedures, disconnect the inlet line connected to the lactated Ringer’s solution bottle from the manifold and connect the 30 mL syringe filled with lactated Ringer’s solution directly with the inlet of the manifold instead.\nNOTE: This is the alternative default set-up.\nDuring each brief ischemia, disconnect the 30 mL syringe, which was emptied at the end of the preceding brief reperfusion, from the manifold. Refill the syringe with lactated Ringer’s solution by sucking it directly from the bottle. Reconnect the refilled 30 mL syringe to the inlet of the manifold to reestablish the alternative default set-up.",
    "NOTE: With this set-up, it is possible to obtain more clear images of the culprit coronary artery by making a larger volume of contrast medium available. However, the aforementioned set-up may be more convenient because disconnecting the 30 mL syringe from the manifold is not necessary for each refilling of the syringe with lactated Ringer’s solution."
