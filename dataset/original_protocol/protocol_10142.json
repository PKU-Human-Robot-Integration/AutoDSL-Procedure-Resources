    "This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Korea University Anam Hospital (IRB No. ED170495). All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments.\n1. Preparation of Aluminum (Al) Substrate by Electropolishing\nCaution: Electropolishing solution is corrosive and toxic. Wear personal protective equipment including nitrile gloves, goggles and lab coat. Perform this step in a fume hood.\nPrepare electropolishing solution by mixing ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH, 99.9%) and perchloric acid (HClO4, 60%) in a 1 L double jacket beaker (C2H5OH:HClO4 = 4:1).\nConnect the double jacket beaker to a circulator and set the temperature at 7 °C. Put the double jacket beaker on a magnetic stirrer. Leave the solution under stirring for at least 30 min until the temperature drops to 7 °C.\nImmerse the ultrapure Al plate (99.999%, 20 × 50 × 1 mm3) and carbon counter electrode into the electropolishing solution using crocodile clips and copper wire. Adjust the position of the Al plate and the carbon counter electrode to face each other.\nNote: It is necessary to install the clips carefully so as not to touch the solution. When in contact with the solution, impurities flowing out from the clips can contaminate the Al plate.\nConnect the Al plate to the positive terminal, and carbon counter electrode to the negative terminal, of a direct current (DC) power supply.\nTurn off the magnetic stirrer and apply a voltage of 20 V. Maintain this state for 4 min.\nTurn on the magnetic stirrer, and allow the current to flow for another 6 min.\nNote: The static condition removes most of the impurities and roughness from the Al plate, and the dynamic condition improves the final quality of electropolishing.",
    "Turn off the power supply and manually separate the Al plate from the clip. Rigorously wash the Al plate with deionized water to remove all remaining solution.\nDry the Al plate with nitrogen and store under inert gas. Conduct this drying process at the end of all experiments in step 1 and 2.\nNote: When injecting compressed air, make air flow from the polished part to the opposite side. In the opposite case, impurities can escape from the non-polished part and contaminate the Al plate.\n2. Fabrication of Gradient AAO Mold with Phosphoric Acid Electrolyte\nCaution: Methyl alcohol and its fume are ocular toxic. Continuous exposure to chromium can lead to serious chromium poisoning. Perform this step in a fume hood.\nPrimary anodization\n\t\nTo prepare 1 L of phosphoric acid electrolyte, load 590 mL of deionized water into a glass bottle.\nAdd 400 mL of methyl alcohol (CH3OH, 99%) and 10 mL of phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%) into the glass bottle. Mix the solution well by shaking manually or with magnetic stirring.\nPour 500 mL of the electrolyte into a 1 L double jacket beaker. Immerse the polished Al plate and carbon counter electrode into the solution with crocodile clips and copper wire.\nPour additional electrolyte to locate the boundary of electropolishing 2-3 mm above the surface of the solution.\nNote: If anodization is carried out with the boundary of electropolishing touching the solution, the Al plate tends to burn during the anodization.\nInstall a vertical shaft on a U-shape pedestal. Attach an overhead stirrer, and impeller using metal clamps. Position the propeller of the impeller near the lower end of both electrodes. Set the rotation speed of the overhead stirrer between 200 and 300 rpm.",
    "Connect the double jacket beaker to a circulator and set the temperature at -10 °C. Leave the system for at least 1 h under stirring until the temperature drops to -10 °C.\nNote: Do not use water as the coolant. Because the water freezes at low temperatures, the circulation will not work normally. It is recommended to use a mixture of water and ethyl alcohol at a ratio of 1:1 as the coolant.\nApply a voltage of 195 V under stirring for 16 h.\nNote: If the current rises more than 50 mA within 2 or 3 h after applying the voltage, the probability that burning will occur is very high. Immediately stop the process and replace the Al plate with a new one. If this problem occurs repeatedly, check that there is no abnormality in the temperature control of the circulator. If there is no abnormality, change the electrolyte.\nStop the power supply and manually separate the Al plate from the clip. Wash the anodized Al plate with deionized water to remove all remaining solution.\nAlumina etching\n\t\nPrepare chromic acid etching solution by dissolving 9.0 g of chromium oxide (CrO3) and 20.3 mL of phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%) in 500 mL of deionized water.\nPour the etching solution into the 1 L double jacket beaker. Set the temperature at 65 °C.\nImmerse the anodized Al plate in the etching solution for at least 10 h under stirring. Seal the top of the beaker with aluminum foil.\nRinse the etched Al plate several times with deionized water.\nSecondary anodization\n\t\nSet the same experimental conditions as step 2.1.1 to 2.1.7.",
    "Load the etched Al plate to the anode of the system and apply a voltage of 195 V for 6 h. Then, turn off the power supply and manually separate the Al plate from the clip. Immediately wash the anodized Al plate with deionized water.\nNote: When the time of washing is delayed, the pore size of AAO increases unintentionally owing to the residual phosphoric acid.\nGradient pore widening\n\t\nPrepare a pore widening solution by dissolving 5.765 g of phosphoric acid in 500 mL of deionized water. Pour the solution into a 1 L double jacket beaker.\nConnect the double jacket beaker to the circulator and set the temperature at 30 °C. Place a linear moving stage vertically next to the beaker. Attach a bracket to the moving part of the linear stage.\nSet the moving part of the linear stage to the home position. Attach the clip to the bracket and load the anodized Al plate.\nManipulate the position of the Al plate manually so that the Al plate will come right above the surface of the solution.\nNote: In this step, the Al plate should not touch the solution. The pore widening process begins as soon as the Al plate reaches the solution.\nGradually immerse the Al plate into the solution at a speed of 4.86 µm/s for 120 min to make a 35 mm AAO mold with a size gradient from 120 nm to 200 nm (GP 120/200). Start a stopwatch at the moment the Al plate touches the surface of the solution.\nTo make GP 200/280 and GP 280/360 molds, immerse the entire area of GP 120/200 mold in the pore widening solution for 2 or 4 h, respectively.\nRinse the gradient Al plate several times with deionized water.",
    "3. Deposition of Anti-Sticking Layer on Gradient AAO Mold with Self-Assembled Monolayer\nNote: Perform steps 3.2.1 to 3.3.3 in a glove box. Connect a vacuum pump and dry nitrogen gas injector to the glove box. Place all samples, reagents, and apparatuses in the glove box prior to the dehumidification process. Repeat the evacuation and nitrogen gas injection cycle more than three times to adequately remove moisture from the glove box. Let the dry nitrogen flow through the experiment.\nHydroxyl modification of AAO mold with Piranha treatment\n\t\nPour 140 mL of sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95%) in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) beaker. Add 60 mL of hydrogen peroxide dropwise (H2O2, 30%). Leave it for 30 min until the solution has cooled down.\nCaution: Be extremely careful when making Piranha solution. From the moment of adding hydrogen peroxide, the solution vigorously boils and generates high temperatures. Perform the experiment in a fume hood.\nImmerse the AAO mold in the solution for 30 s using a nonmetallic tweezer.\nRinse the AAO mold several times with deionized water. Soak the mold in deionized water for 30 min and put it in methyl alcohol for another 30 min.\nCaution: When discarding the used Piranha solution, dilute the solution with a copious amount of tap water.\nCompletely dry the AAO mold under vacuum for 3 h.\nPreparation of 20× HDFS stock solution\nNote: HDFS is an abbreviation of (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2, -tetrahydrodecyl) dimethylchloro-silane\n\t\nFill one-third of a 1 L n-hexane bottle with molecular sieves. Seal the bottle with paraffin film and store it under dry nitrogen for 24 h.\nFilter the 200 mL of n-hexane using a glass syringe and 0.2 µm PTFE syringe filter.\nPour the 80 mL of filtered n-hexane into a 100 mL glass bottle. Add 2 mL of HDFS.\nSelf-assembled monolayer deposition",
    "Load 57 mL of filtered n-hexane in a 100 mL beaker. Immerse the AAO mold into the solvent.\nAdd 3 mL of HDFS stock solution to the n-hexane to make 2.9 mM HDFS solution. Wait 10 min for the reaction to proceed.\nTransfer the AAO mold to fresh n-hexane. Close and seal all reagent bottles. Close the nitrogen valve, then pull out samples from the glove box.\nNote: HDFS is extremely sensitive to moisture. Store all reagents that contain HDFS in a desiccator.\nSoak the AAO mold in 60 mL of methoxynonafluorobutane (C10H6F18O2, 99%). Ultrasonically clean the AAO mold in a beaker for 10 s per one time to remove physically adsorbed HDFS molecules. Repeat the cleaning procedure 10 times.\nNote: Exposing the AAO mold to ultrasonic for a long time without intervals will damage the oxide layer.\nCompletely dry the AAO mold under vacuum for 24 h.\nNote: A successfully deposited anti-sticking layer is super water repellent and stable for months when stored in a desiccator. The protocol can be paused here.\n4. Fabrication of Gradient Nanopattern Plates by Thermal Imprinting\nNote: Perform steps 4.2 to 4.7 in a clean room.\nCut a 1.1 mm thick polystyrene sheet to a size of 2.9 mm wide by 3.7 mm long using a printed circuit board (PCB) cutter.\nCut the AAO mold 35 mm from the bottom using a nipper. Mark the sample name and date of manufacture on the back.\nClean an 8.0\" wafer with a small dose of ethyl alcohol. Put the polystyrene sheets on the wafer, then mount the AAO mold.\nPut the bottom film in the drawer of a thermal imprinter. Attach the top film to the gasket.",
    "Put the wafer on the bottom film. Place the gasket on the wafer. Make sure that there is no dust on the wafer.\nClose the drawer of the thermal imprinter. Apply 165 °C of heat and 620.52 kPa of pressure for 100 s.\nCool the sample to room temperature. Gently twist the polystyrene sheet to release the AAO mold.\n5. Sterilization and Hydrophilic Modification of Gradient Nanopattern Plates\nPlace the nanopattern plates on a square dish. Pour 100 mL of 70% ethyl alcohol and expose to ultraviolet light for 30 min.\nDry the nanopattern plates with nitrogen. Transfer the nanopattern plates to an oxygen plasma generator.\nEvacuate the chamber until it reaches 1.33 Pa. Then, inject oxygen at a rate of 30 cm3/min. Apply a radio frequency power of 60 W. Maintain the oxygen plasma for 90 s.\nNote: It is recommended to use plasma-treated nanopattern plates within 14 days.\nAttach the nanopattern plate to the bottom of a cell culture dish using a drop of toluene.\nSeal the samples in a pouch and sterilize with low-temperature plasma sterilizer.\n6. Cultivation of hECFCs\nNote: Conduct all centrifuging procedures at 4 °C unless otherwise noted.\nBefore isolating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), incubate a collagen-coated 12-well culture dish at 37 °C for 1 h.\nWash the 12-well culture dish using 1× sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nCollect 50 mL of human blood using a heparin inhibitor tube.\nPut 6 mL of hydrophilic polysaccharide solution in a 15 mL tube and add 8 mL of blood to the hydrophilic polysaccharide solution.\nNote: Slowly pipette the blood into the hydrophilic polysaccharide solution.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1020 x g for 20 min to pellet the cells.\nHarvest the opaque cell layer, and transfer to a new 15 mL tube.",
    "Add 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-contained PBS and centrifuge the tube at 1020 x g for 10 min to pellet the cells.\nRemove the supernatant and add red-blood-cell lysis buffer. Keep on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 10% FBS-contained PBS and centrifuge the tube at 1020 x g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nRemove the supernatant and add 10% FBS-contained PBS. Centrifuge the tube at 1020 x g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 mL of endothelial cell expansion medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Seed 8.0 × 106 cells per well for each collagen-coated dish.\nChange the culture medium every day for 1 week. Then, change the culture medium every 2 days.\nNote: hECFCs can be found after culture day 10-14. hECFCs show typical cobblestone-like morphology and form a colony which can be observed in phase contrast microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining of vascular endothelial cadherin (CD144) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) can be also performed for the characterization of the hECFCs after further cell expansion.\nTo cultivate the hECFCs, use endothelial cell expansion medium supplemented with 5% FBS and penicillin/streptavidin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Replace the medium once a day.\nAfter hECFC induction, grow the cells to passage 7 for further experiments.\n7. Cell Seeding and Culture on the Gradient Nanopattern Plates\nNote: Step 7 describes the culture of hECFCs on the gradient nanopattern plate, but other cell sources also can be used.\nCoat the gradient nanopattern plates with 1 mL of 0.1% protein coating solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.\nNote: The 0.1 % protein coating does not cover the nanopillar features.\nMake a hECFCs suspension from the culture dish by a standard cell-splitting method using trypsin.",
    "Dilute the cell suspension to achieve the desired confluence. Seed the hECFCs onto the gradient nanopattern plates and flat control (e.g., 1.0 × 104 cells/cm2).\nNote: When hECFCs are seeded at 1.0 × 104 cells/cm2 on gradient nanopattern plates, the cell confluency usually reaches to 70 - 80 % after 2 days.\nCulture the cells on flat or gradient nanopattern plates for 2 days in the incubator.\n8.
