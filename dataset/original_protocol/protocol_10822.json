    "1. Silver seed preparation\nPrepare a stock solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) by taking an arbitrary mass and mixing it with 10 mL of deionized (DI) water. Calculate molarity of the solution. Keep the solution in a dark place to isolate it from light.\nAdd 14.7 mg of sodium citrate tribasic (Na3C6H5O7) to 10 mL of DI water to make a 5 mM solution. Shake the vial until the powder is dissolved.\nAdd 15.1 mg of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) to another vial with 10 mL of DI water to make a 40 mM solution. Close the vial immediately. Gently shake the solution by hand and place it in a beaker with ice. Place the beaker in the refrigerator and start a timer (t1 = 0). The freshly made solution will be used in 15 min which is enough time to cool it down.\nFrom the stock solution of silver nitrate, 1.1), prepare 10 mL at 0.25 mM. Place a stirring magnet in the vial and start stirring.\nAdd 0.25 mL of the sodium citrate tribasic solution 1.2) to 1.4).\nAt t1 = 15 min remove the sodium borohydride solution, 1.3), from the refrigerator. Using a pipette take 0.4 mL of this solution and add it to 1.5). Note:  Add the solution in a single quick stroke. The color will turn to yellow. Stir the solution for 5 min.\nAt t1 = 20 min stop stirring, remove the magnet from the vial and keep the vial in a dark place. Do not close the vial.\nKeep the solution in the dark at room temperature for at least 2 hours before using. Preferably use the seeds within one week from preparation.\n2. Growth solution preparation\nPrepare 80 mM of ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) by adding 140 mg to 10 mL of DI water.",
    "Prepare 10 mL of a concentrated solution of gold chloride (HAuCl4). Calculate the molarity of the solution. Keep the solution isolated from light.\nPrepare 20 mL of 50 mM of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB - C19H42BrN) by adding 364 mg to a vial with 20 mL of DI water. Immediately place a stirring magnet into the vial and start stirring on a warm plate at 30°C. After CTAB powder is completely dissolved and the solution becomes transparent turn off the heater of the plate but keep stirring through step 2.7).\nAdd solution 1.1) to solution 2.3) to obtain a final molarity of 4.9x10-2 mM. Start a timer (t2 = 0).\nAt t2 = 1 min add solution 2.2) to 2.4) to obtain a final molarity of 0.25 mM. \nAt t2 = 2 min add 0.1 mL of 2.1) to 2.5). The solution will turn colorless.\nAt t2 = 2 min 20 sec add 0.05 mL of 1.8) (silver seeds) to 2.6). Stir the suspension  for 15 min. The suspension will initially turn blue and then brown. \nAt t2 = 17 min stop stirring, remove the magnet and keep the suspension at room temperature for 24 hours.\n3. Separating gold nanostars from CTAB for imaging, characterization or experimentation\nNote: CTAB may crystallize at room temperature. To dissolve the crystals heat up the gold colloid to 30°C or immerse the vial in hot tap-water until the crystals dissolve.\nSonicate the suspension for 2 min.\nCentrifuge the suspension for 5 min at 730 rcf. Nanostars will accumulate on the wall of the tube.\nRemove as much of the suspension with a pipette taking care not to remove the nanostars.\nAdd DI water to the tube and sonicate for 2 min.",
    "Centrifuge the suspension for 3 min at 460 rcf. The suspension contains less CTAB, therefore lower centrifugal force is needed to separate the nanostars.\nRepeat steps 3.3) and 3.4).\nAdd DI water to the suspension and centrifuge for 3 min at 380 rcf.\nRepeat steps 3.3) and 3.4). The nanostars are ready for imaging, spectroscopy, or experimentation.\n4. Representative results:\nFigure 1 shows transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the silver seeds imaged using a JEOL 2010-F TEM. The seeds have a spherical shape and an average size of 15 nm. Gold nanostars are imaged using a Hitachi S-5500 in scanning electron microscope (SEM) mode. Figure 2 shows increasing magnifications of the nanostars synthesized with our method. Star shaped particles are approximately 70 % of all the particles in the colloid. Non-formed stars appear like amorphous clusters of decahedra and rhomboids (not shown). Figure 3 shows several single gold nanostars. The size of the nanostars ranges from 200 nm to 300 nm and the number of tips vary from 7 to 10. If the gold nanoparticles synthesized by this method are left in CTAB they retain their shape for at least 1 month after synthesis.\nWe measured the absorption spectra of the silver seeds and nanostars using an Olis Cary-14 spectrophotometer. The peak absorption of the seeds was at 400 nm, while the peak absorption of the nanostars was between 800 nm and 850 nm (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3570/3570fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
