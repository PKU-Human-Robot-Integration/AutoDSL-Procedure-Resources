    "All animal experiments performed following this protocol must be approved by the respective Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All procedures described here have been approved by IACUC UCSD.\n1. Procure Recipient Animals\nNOTE: The KPC-Luc 4580 cell line was established from a tumor arising in a LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+; PDX1Cre/+; LSL-ROSA26 Luc/+ mouse (KPC), which is a genetically engineered model of PC on a C57BL/6 background. The advantage of this cell line is that it constitutively expresses luciferase-enabling tumor monitoring in orthotopic models. However, other cell lines may also be used as long as they are compatible with the genetic background of the recipient mice.\nDetermine the experimental groups and the number of animals per group in advance.\nChoose the age (6 - 10-week old mice recommended) and sex of the animals being used according to the hypothesis and the cell line used.\n2. Culture Cells\nUse Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM): nutrient mixture F12 (50:50) media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic (Complete growth media) to grow KPC-Luc 4580 cells.\nIf frozen, thaw the cells 4 days prior to tumor implantation.\nGrow the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity under aseptic conditions.\nTrypsinize the cells with 0.25% Trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C before they reach >80% confluency and neutralize the trypsin by adding twice the volume of complete growth media.\n\tNOTE: These cells do not establish tumors efficiently in mice if they are used at 100% confluency or if they are passaged for more than 12 times. Hence, it is advisable to freeze the cells at earlier passages under optimal confluency.",
    "Count the cells using a hemocytometer and proceed to tumor induction if adequate numbers are present (0.5 - 1 x 106 cells/mouse). If not, expand the cells for one more passage until adequate cell numbers are obtained.\n3. Induction of SQ Tumors\nPrepare the materials required: P1000 and P100 pipettes and tips, 1-mL syringe, 25G needles, basement membrane matrix (BMM), DMEM basal media, 1.5-mL centrifuge tubes. Keep all materials sterile and cold (4 °C) until the end of the procedure. Also keep hair clippers and alcohol swabs ready for animal use.\nTrypsinize (as per step 2.4) and count the cells, and resuspend them at a concentration of 2 - 4 x 107 cells/mL of cold DMEM.\nAdd an equal volume of 100% BMM to make a final cell suspension in 50% BMM. The final volume should amount to 50 µL of cell suspension for each mouse required. Prepare 10% in excess to accommodate the dead space in the syringe and for any pipetting errors.\nAliquot the suspension in 550 µL volumes in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes placed in ice.\nRestrain the animals (6-week old male C57BL/6 mice) using a restrainer or manually.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, mice can be anaesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen gas at a flow rate of 2 L/min using a precision vaporizer.\nShave the site of injection, which is preferably on a flank above a leg, using a clipper. Using an alcohol swab, clean the site of injection twice.\nDraw 250 µL of cell suspension at a final concentration of 1 - 2 x 107 cells/mL in a 1-mL cold syringe and remove any air bubbles by moving the piston up and down. Attach a 25G needle to the syringe and make sure to fill the space within the needle.",
    "Carefully insert the needle under the skin at a 30° angle to the body near the flanks, making sure that the needle does not pierce the peritoneal cavity or the musculature of the limbs.\nFlatten the needle parallel to the body, and flatten wrinkles on the skin. Slowly inject 50 µL of cell suspension. Hold the needle at the site of injection for 10 s to allow the BMM to solidify to prevent any leakage.\nSlowly withdraw the needle keeping it parallel without any sideways movement. Gently clean the site of injection with an alcohol swab and release the mouse to its housing.\n\tNOTE: If the mouse was anesthetized during the procedure, monitor the animal until it regains its righting reflexes.\nMonitor the growth of the tumor regularly using calipers until it reaches 5 mm in diameter.\n4. Induction of Orthotopic Tumors\nPrepare the materials required. Autoclave the surgical tools such as scissors, scalpels, needle drivers, and pointed and flat-tipped forceps. Keep handy sterile sutures (absorbable 6-0 and non-absorbable 4-0), alcohol swabs, hair clippers, depilatory cream, eye lubricant, cotton gauze, 10% povidone iodine solution, surgical drapes, heating pads, buprenorphine, and anesthetic agents.\nEuthanize a donor mouse (preferably of the same background required for the orthotopic model) carrying a SQ KPC tumor using a slow fill CO2 chamber. Excise the SQ tumor carefully under sterile conditions in a BSL-2 hood using sterile forceps and microscissors shortly before orthotopic implantation. During tumor excision take care not to puncture the peritoneal cavity and wash the tumor immediately with 2 exchanges of sterile PBS.\nUsing sterile scalpels, mince the excised tumor into 1 mm3 pieces, place them on a Petri dish containing cold sterile DMEM basal media, and store on ice until implantation.",
    "Administer the recipient mouse 0.05 - 1 mg/kg buprenorphine analgesic SQ, 30 min prior to surgery.\nAnesthetize the recipient mice with 2 - 3% isoflurane in oxygen (2 L/min) using a precision vaporizer (or other anesthetic agents). Keep mice on a 37 °C heating pad for the entirety of the procedure. Apply lubricant to the eyes to prevent desiccation. Test the depth of anesthesia by lack of startling reflex initially, and confirm surgical plane anesthesia by the lack of pedal reflex to a gentle toe pinch. Maintain the anesthesia during the entire surgical procedure.\nPlace the mouse on its back and gently turn it to its right side so that the left side of the abdomen is exposed. Remove the abdominal hair of the mouse using depilatory cream and clean with gauze to ensure no free hair enters the abdomen post incision. Prepare the left abdomen for surgery using 3 cycles of 10% povidone iodine followed by alcohol wipes to disinfect the skin.\nUsing a sterile scalpel, make a 1.5-cm transverse or oblique incision in the skin, 1-cm to the left of the midline, below the ribcage, slightly medial to the spleen. Then, extend the incision through the abdominal musculature, mirroring the overlying superficial incision.\nLocate the spleen using flat tipped forceps and gently externalize it from the abdominal cavity. Retract the spleen using a sterile cotton applicator, and find the tail of the pancreas attached to the bottom of the spleen.\nUsing flat-tipped forceps, retract the tail of the pancreas laterally.\nPick up one finely minced tumor piece from the donor mouse with the tip of a fine (6-0) sterile suturing needle and position it using sterile forceps.",
    "While gently retracting the tail/body of the pancreas laterally, insert the needle of the suture containing tumor fragment into the tail of the pancreas. Pass the suture slowly through the tissue, holding the tumor in contact with the pancreatic tail. Apply one or two additional sutures depending on the fragment's orientation in relation to the tissue.\nRemove the needle completely from the tissue and keep the pancreas/spleen externalized for an additional 60 s while inspecting for any signs of hemorrhage or leak. Then, internalize them gently into the abdominal cavity using blunt forceps.\nClose the abdominal musculature using a 6-0 absorbable suture with either a continuous or interrupted stitch, and close the overlying skin using a 3-0 to 6-0 non-absorbable interrupted suture. Discontinue the anesthesia at this point.\nAllow the mouse to recover in its home cage with free access to food and water. Place the cage on a heating pad to facilitate recovery. Monitor vital signs such as breathing, perfusion etc., during the recovery process.\nConfirm the signs of righting reflex once the mouse recovers, and then return the cage can to regular housing.\nAdminister buprenorphine 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg 8 - 12 h after the surgery, and every 8 - 12 h after the procedure as needed for signs of pain.\nMonitor tumor growth using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system (see the Table of Materials).\n\t\nFollow tumor growth by imaging starting on day 4 after orthotopic implantation, and perform imaging twice a week.\nOn the day of imaging, administer (intraperitoneal injection) 30 mg/kg D-luciferin to an anesthetized (2 - 3% isoflurane in oxygen (2 L/min)) recipient mouse 10 min prior to imaging.",
    "Image for luciferase activity using the luminescence setting without any emission filters for a minimum of 5 s exposure in a luminescence imager with auto-fluorescence free heated stage and while still maintaining the anesthesia for the mice.\n5. IRE of SQ Tumors\nPrepare the materials required: square wave electroporator, safety foot switch, electrodes (needle array versus tweezer-trode), and adaptors. Keep sterile sutures (non-absorbable 4-0), alcohol swabs, hair clippers, depilatory cream, eye lubricant, cotton gauze, buprenorphine, and anesthetics also nearby.\nSterilize the tweezer or needle array electrodes using gas sterilization. Autoclaving is not recommended. Use a glass bead sterilizer to sterilize the electrodes between animals.\nAdminister buprenorphine 0.05 - 0.1 mg/Kg to the tumor-bearing mice 30 min prior to the procedure.\nFollow steps 4.4 - 4.5 to successfully induce anesthesia in mice once the SQ tumor implant reaches 5 mm diameter.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on its side to access the SQ tumor on the flank. Remove the hair using clippers and clean skin using an alcohol swab.\nFor SQ tumors, use 2-needle array electrodes. Elevate the skin directly under the tumor site using forceps and insert the electrodes through the skin parallel to the body making sure they do not penetrate the peritoneal cavity. Once through the skin, position the electrodes in such a way that they bracket the tumor.\nProgram the electroporator to deliver 100 µs pulses at a frequency of 1 Hz at 1,500 V/cm for a total of 150 pulses. Deliver the pulses using the foot pedal. Separate each set of 10 pulses by 10 s, in order to allow for heat dissipation and confirm the correct position of the electrodes.\n\tNOTE: Without the use of paralytic agents, mice will experience muscle contractions with IRE that can cause displacement of the electrodes unless manually secured.",
    "Remove the electrodes after complete dosing, which should not exceed 200 s. Record the actual voltage delivered, which is displayed on the electroporator. Allow the mice to recover following IRE as per steps 4.14 - 4.16.\n6. IRE of Orthotopic Tumors\nNOTE: IRE of orthotopic tumors involves a second survival surgery on the same mouse thus requiring special approval from local IACUC before beginning.\nPrepare required materials: autoclave the surgical tools such as scissors, scalpels, needle drivers, pointed forceps, and flat tipped forceps. Keep the following nearby as well: sterile sutures (absorbable 6-0 and non-absorbable 4-0), alcohol swabs, hair clippers, depilatory cream, eye lubricant, cotton gauze, 10% povidone iodine solution, surgical drapes, heating pads, square wave electroporator, safety foot switch, electrodes and their adaptors, buprenorphine, and anesthetics.\nAssess the mice for orthotopic tumor growth by in vivo imaging (see step 4.17) by injecting 30 mg/kg of D-Luciferin intraperitoneally.\n\tNOTE: The orthotopic tumors are ideal for IRE treatment 8 to 10 days post implantation when the tumors are clearly visible and still confined to the pancreas as can be seen on the Luciferase luminescence images (see the Representative Results).\nFollow steps 4.4 - 4.9, to locate the implanted tumor. If the tumor is not easy to locate, use blunt nosed forceps to move the stomach and spleen gently to identify the tumor.\nExternalize the tumor with blunt nosed forceps and capture the tumor tightly with the platinum electrodes of the tweezer-trode. Deliver the electroporation pulses as programmed in step 5.7 using the square wave electroporator in sets of 10 pulses controlled by the foot switch.",
    "Keep the tumor externalized for at least 60 s post IRE to monitor for any signs of hemorrhage. Insert the tumor back into the abdominal cavity and close the incision as described earlier (steps 4.13 - 4.16) and monitor the mouse until it recovers.\nMonitor the effects of IRE on tumor growth using in vivo luciferase imaging as per step 4.17.\nSubscription Required.
