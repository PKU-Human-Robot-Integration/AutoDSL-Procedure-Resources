    "Tissue collection (see Note 2) Anesthetize a mouse with 3% isoflurane mixed with O2 at 1 L/min following the standard operating procedure of your institution and verify depth of anesthesia by the absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex to rear foot squeezing.Perform a laparotomy to expose the intestines.Dissect and transfer the spleen to the spleen well of the labeled 24-well tissue culture plate containing cold RPMI. Store on ice (Figure 2A).Tie off the ends of the intestines using surgical sutures at the beginning of the duodenum (Figure 2B) and the end of the colon (Figure 2C) to prevent excess leakage of intestinal contents. Excise the intestines with the mesenteric bed using scissors, keeping the knots attached to the intestines, and transfer to a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing PBS. Store on ice.Dissect out the kidneys (Figure 2D) and transfer both kidneys to the kidney well of the labeled 24-well tissue culture plate containing RPMI. Store on ice.Open the thoracic cage by cutting the ribs laterally to each side of the sternum, and immediately remove the heart to euthanize the animal (Figure 2E). Then, hold the lungs by the bronchi with tweezers and remove both lungs by cutting the trachea with scissors (Figure 2F). Transfer the lungs to the lung well of the labeled 24-well tissue culture plate containing RPMI. Store on ice.Repeat the above operation with the remaining mice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230516/20230516200038_2816.jpgFigure 2. Collection of tissues. Perform a laparotomy to expose the intestines and remove the spleen (A). Tie off the beginning of the duodenum (B) and the end of the colon (C) using surgical sutures and excise the intestines. Then, dissect out the kidneys. Open the thoracic cage by cutting the ribs laterally to each side of the sternum and remove the heart (E).",
    "Finally, hold the lungs by the bronchi with tweezers and remove both lungs by cutting the trachea with scissors (F).Preparation of single-cell suspension from the lungs, kidneys, and MV/PVAT Single-cell suspensions are obtained from the lungs, kidneys, and MV/PVAT by digesting these tissues with a cocktail of digestive enzymes. Begin by digesting the lungs, followed by the kidneys and the MV/PVAT, as the lungs take the longest to digest. Digestions are to be carried out at 37 °C with agitation in a hybridization incubator oven equipped with a rocker platform set at 30 cycles per minute with a displacement amplitude of 3 cm. Digestions are ended by placing the tubes containing digestive mixtures on ice, as the enzymes are non-functional at low temperature.For four mice, prepare four digestion tubes per tissue as follows. For each lung digestion tube, combine 600 μL of RPMI, 100 μL of 8× digestion stock solution, and 100 μL of 8× hyaluronidase stock solution in a 1.5 mL microtube. For each MV/PVAT digestion tube, add 700 μL of RPMI to a 100 μL aliquot of 8× digestion stock solution. For the kidneys, reserve four undiluted 100 μL aliquots of 8× digestion stock solution. Keep all enzyme digestion tubes on ice until used.Transfer the lungs from the cold RPMI to a 100 mm tissue culture dish sitting on an ice pack that has been removed immediately before from a -20 °C freezer. Thoroughly mince the lungs with scissors until a paste is formed. Then, transfer the minced tissue using tweezers and/or a razor blade into a lung enzyme digestion tube. Store the tube on ice until all lung samples have been processed as above.Start the digestion of the lung samples at 37 °C with agitation in a hybridization incubator oven as described above.",
    "The digestions should be completed in approximately 2 h. Check the progression of the digestion every 30 min by removing the tubes from the oven and holding them up to a light source. Look at the smoothness of the solution. If chunks of tissue are visible, shake the tube vigorously by hand or vortex the tube at medium-high speed for several short 5 s bursts, and return the tubes to the oven to continue the digestion for another 30 min. Repeat as necessary until the tissue/digestion solution appears smooth. At the end of the 2 h digestion, if the solution is almost smooth, shake the tube vigorously by hand or vortex the tube at medium-high speed for several short 5 s bursts, place the tube back into the hybridization oven, and check again in 5 min. When the lungs are fully digested, remove the tubes from the incubator and place on ice to stop the digestion.While the lungs are being digested, remove the capsule from the kidneys using forceps and surgical scissors and transfer the kidneys to a kidney processing well of the 24-well tissue culture plate containing 500 μL of cold RPMI. Cut out the nylon mesh of a 70 μm cell strainer using a razor blade and place the mesh over the top of the kidneys in the well of the 24-well plate with RPMI using tweezers (Figure 3). Using the back of a sterile 3 mL syringe plunger, gently crush the kidneys under the nylon mesh. Transfer the RPMI and kidney solution using a P1000 pipette along with the nylon mesh using tweezers to an aliquot of undiluted (100 μL) 8× digestion stock solution. Each kidney tube should now contain 100 μL of digestion stock solution, 500 μL of RPMI, and the crushed kidneys.",
    "Store the tube on ice until all kidney samples have been processed as above.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230516/20230516200059_0799.jpgFigure 3. Crushing of spleen, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs). The tissues are crushed by pressing gently with the back of a syringe plunger on a nylon mesh positioned over the tissues.Start the digestion of the kidney samples at 37 °C with agitation in a hybridization incubator oven and check the progression of the digestion every 15 min as above. The kidney digestion should be completed in approximately 30 min. If chunks of tissue are visible, shake the tube vigorously by hand or vortex the tube at medium-high speed for several short 5 s bursts, and return the tubes to the oven to continue the digestion for another 15 min. After 30 min of digestion, if the solution is almost smooth, shake the tube vigorously by hand or vortex the tube at medium-high speed for several short 5 s bursts, return the tube to the hybridization oven, and check again in 5 min. When the kidneys are fully digested, remove the tubes from the incubator and place on ice to end the digestion.While the lungs and kidneys are being digested, pour ice-cold PBS into a dissection dish and place the dish over an ice pack that has been removed immediately before from a -20 °C freezer as above. Transfer the mesenteric bed from the 50 mL centrifuge tube into the dissection dish containing cold PBS. Place the dish sitting on the cold ice pack under the direct view of a dissecting microscope on low magnification. Find the cluster of mLNs proximal to the cecum and excise the whole cluster with scissors. In addition, check for small lymph nodes that could reside within the adipose tissue of the mesenteric bed.",
    "Lymph nodes are more opaque than adipose tissue and have a white hue and a defined capsule. They can be cut out of the tissue using small scissors. Place the mLNs into the labeled well of a 24-well plate containing 1 mL of cold RPMI and set the plate aside on ice for later.Set a 100 mm tissue culture dish on another ice pack that has been removed immediately before from the -20 °C freezer.Stretch out the mesenteric vascular bed and pin it down using 26 G needles in the dissection dish to expose the MV/PVAT (Figure 4). Cut out all the MV/PVAT using scissors and transfer to the 100 mm tissue culture dish sitting on an ice pack. Check the tissue again for the presence of any lymph nodes under the microscope and remove any that are found. Thoroughly mince the tissue with scissors and then transfer the minced tissue into a MV/PVAT digestion tube using small forceps. Store the tube on ice until all MV/PVAT samples have been processed as above.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230516/20230516200118_5738.jpgFigure 4. Visualization of mesenteric vessels and perivascular adipose tissue (MV/PVAT) and lymph nodes (mLNs) Start the digestion of the MV/PVAT samples at 37 °C with agitation in a hybridization incubator oven and check the progression of the digestion after 15 min and at the end of the digestion as above. The digestion should be done in approximately 25 min. If chunks of tissue are visible, shake the tube vigorously by hand or vortex the tube at medium-high speed for several short 5 s bursts, and return the tubes to the oven to continue the digestion.",
    "After 25 min of digestion, if the solution is almost smooth, shake the tube vigorously by hand or vortex the tube at medium-high speed for several short 5 s bursts, return the tube to the hybridization oven, and check again in 5 min. When the MV/PVAT is fully digested, remove the tubes from the incubator and place on ice to stop the digestion.When all tissues have been digested, filter each suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer into labeled 50 mL Falcon tubes (for the kidneys and lungs) and 1.5 mL microtubes (for the MV/PVAT). Wash the filter with a small amount of RPMI to help free cells from the filter (1 mL of RPMI for the kidneys and lungs and 200 μL of RPMI for the MV/PVAT to account for the smaller tube size). When filtering the suspensions and washing the cell strainer with RPMI, it is recommended to slowly move the pipette tip in small circles just above the nylon mesh while depressing the plunger. This will help to dissociate any remaining clumps of cells and prevent them from clinging to the mesh, thereby minimizing sample loss. The smaller 1.5 mL microtubes are used to minimize loss of cells due to the small number of T cells present in this tissue. Microtubes also allow for the formation of a more robust cell pellet in tissues with fewer immune cells (the small pellet will be more resistant to being lost when pouring out the supernatant after centrifugation in the following steps). Keep filtered suspensions on ice until the in vitro T-cell activation step.",
    "Preparation of single-cell suspensions from spleens and mLNs Cut out the nylon mesh of a 70 μm cell strainer using a razor blade and place the mesh over the top of a spleen in the well of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing 1 mL of RPMI (Figure 3).Using the back of a 3 mL syringe plunger, crush the spleen underneath the nylon mesh until dissociated. Repeat for each spleen sample.Filter each splenocyte suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer placed on top of a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Wash the cell strainer with 1 mL of RPMI to free cells from the filter. Store the 50 mL tube on ice until in vitro T-cell activation step.Process all remaining spleen samples as above.Repeat steps C1–C3 with each mLN sample with some modifications. Use the back of a 1 mL syringe plunger to crush mLNs with more precision. Crush mLNs approximately seven times with gentle pressure to avoid damaging immune cells; the mLNs are much more sensitive to this process than the spleen.Filter mLN samples through 70 μm cell strainers into 1.5 mL microtubes to minimize loss of immune cells and allow for the formation of a more robust cell pellet.Keep filtered suspensions on ice until in vitro T cell activation step.Process all remaining mLN samples as steps C5–C7.In vitro T-cell activation Prepare one 24-well tissue culture plate for the in vitro activation of T cells from lungs, kidneys, MV/PVAT, spleen, and mLNs as depicted in Figure 5. Label five wells per animal with the tissue names and animal number.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230516/20230516200135_2205.jpgFigure 5.

    "The volumes in milliliters of single-cell suspension in T-cell activation cocktail are presented for the lungs, kidneys, mesenteric vessels with perivascular adipose tissue (MV/PVAT), spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs).Centrifuge all the samples at 410× g for 5 min at 4 °C.After centrifugation, pour out the supernatant from each tube and resuspend each cell pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold T-cell activation cocktail by pipetting up and down several times. Transfer each cell suspension into the appropriate well of the 24-well tissue culture plate.Incubate the 24-well tissue culture plate in a cell culture incubator set at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h.During the incubation, prepare twenty 1.5 mL microtubes to collect the samples of lung, kidney, MV/PVAT, spleen, and mLN after the in vitro T-cell activation. Label five microtubes per animal with the tissue names and animal number. In addition, label 44 wells of one V-bottom 96-well plate for extracellular and intracellular staining as depicted in Figure 6.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230516/20230516200152_6460.jpgFigure 6. Preparation of the V-bottom 96-well plate for extracellular and intracellular staining. The volumes of cell suspension in microliters to add per unstained control, fluorescence minus one (FMO) control, and sample wells are presented. The unstained and FMO controls are prepared using pooled spleen, lung, and kidney samples. No unstained and FMO control are prepared for mesenteric vessels with perivascular adipose tissue (MV/PVAT) and mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), as these tissues do not contain enough T cells. The spleen is used for unstained and FMO controls for these tissues.Remove the 24-well plate from the incubator and transfer each sample into separate, labeled 1.5 mL microtubes.Centrifuge all of the samples at 410× g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Distributing activated cell samples to a V-bottom 96-well plate for extracellular and intracellular staining After centrifugation, pour out the supernatant from each tube and resuspend each cell pellet with the quantity of PBS listed below (specific for each tissue). Transfer aliquots of cell suspensions into unstained-, fluorescence minus one (FMO)-, and sample-labeled wells of the V-bottom 96-well plate according to the volumes listed below and in Figure 6.Spleen: Resuspend each spleen sample in 500 μL of PBS and transfer 200 μL (40% of the spleen per sample) into the spleen sample wells of the V-bottom 96-well plate. Pool remaining spleen samples in one microtube and transfer 50 μL of pooled splenocytes into each unstained spleen and FMO well (equivalent to 10% of a spleen).Lungs: Resuspend each lung sample in 500 μL of PBS and transfer 200 μL (40% of the lungs) into the lung sample wells of the V-bottom 96-well plate. Pool remaining lung samples in one microtube and transfer 50 μL of pooled lung cell suspension into each unstained lung and FMO well (equivalent to 10% of the lungs).Kidneys: Resuspend each kidney sample in 500 μL of PBS and transfer 150 μL (30% of the combined kidneys) into the kidney sample wells of the V-bottom 96-well plate. Pool remaining kidney samples and transfer 50 μL of pooled kidney cell suspension into each unstained kidney and FMO well (equivalent to 10% of two kidneys).MV/PVAT and mLNs: Resuspend each MV/PVAT and mLN sample in 100 μL of cold PBS and transfer the entire sample into each respective sample well of a V-bottom 96-well plate. These tissues do not have enough T cells present to prepare unstained, FMO, and samples wells. The spleen is used for unstained and FMO controls for these tissues.",
    "Note: The volume of spleen, lung, and kidney cell suspension for unstained and FMO wells could be reduced to 25 μL (5%) if only one animal is being processed. Centrifuge the V-bottom 96-well plate at 410× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Live/Dead viability staining Perform this step out of direct sunlight to prevent bleaching of the fluorochrome.Pour out the supernatant from the V-bottom 96-well plate into the sink.Resuspend the cell pellets in the FMO control and sample wells with 100 μL of prepared LIVE/DEAD staining solution. Resuspend the cell pellet in the unstained control wells with 100 μL of PBS.Cover the V-bottom 96-well plate with aluminum foil (to protect from light) and incubate it at 4 °C in a refrigerator for 20 min.Centrifuge the V-bottom 96-well plate at 410× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Extracellular staining Perform this step out of direct sunlight to prevent bleaching of the fluorochromes.Note: If using primary and secondary antibodies for determination of marker expression, perform that staining/conjugation protocol at this step. Pour out the supernatant from the 96-well plate into the sink.Resuspend the cell pellets in the unstained control, FMO control, and sample wells with 100 μL of the appropriate unstained control, FMO control, or sample pre-diluted antibody mixture for extracellular staining. Refer to Figure 6 for the distribution of unstained control, FMO control, and sample wells.Cover the plate with aluminum foil and incubate at 4 °C in a refrigerator for 15 min.Note: This is adequate for binding of most monoclonal antibodies, but incubation time and temperature can be modified to accommodate antibodies with poor binding affinity (i.e., use a higher temperature and/or longer incubation time). Centrifuge the V-bottom 96-well plate at 410× g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
    "Fixation in 1% PFA Perform this step out of direct sunlight, as PFA is light-sensitive.Pour out the supernatant from the V-bottom 96-well plate into the sink.Gently resuspend the cell pellets with 100 μL of 1% PFA. Do not create air bubbles. Resuspend as gently as possible to avoid shearing the cells by pipetting up and down 7–10 times with a P200 single or multichannel pipette.Cover the V-bottom 96-well plate with aluminum foil and incubate at 4 °C in a refrigerator for 10 min.Remove the V-bottom 96-well plate from the refrigerator and gently drip 100 μL of cold PBS into each well to help wash the cells.Centrifuge the V-bottom 96-well plate at 410× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Permeabilization/intracellular cytokine staining Perform this step out of direct sunlight to prevent bleaching of the fluorochromes. The permeabilization and intracellular cytokine staining are performed simultaneously.Pour out the supernatant from the 96-well plate into the sink.Resuspend the cell pellets in the unstained control, FMO control, and sample wells with 100 μL of the appropriate unstained control, FMO control, or sample pre-diluted antibody mixtures for intracellular staining.

    "For spleen, kidney, and lung sample wells, resuspend the cell pellets with 150 μL of PBS. For mLNs and MV/PVAT sample wells and all the unstained and FMO control wells, resuspend the cell pellets with 100 μL of cold PBS. Refer to Figure 6 for the distribution of unstained control, FMO control, and sample wells.Transfer all the cell suspensions into labeled Axygen 1.1 mL polypropylene cluster tubes and store for a maximum of three days at 4 °C in a refrigerator until running the samples on the flow cytometer.Preparation of compensation beads for flow cytometry compensation (can be prepared in the days leading up to flow cytometry acquisition) Prepare a V-bottom 96-well plate for staining compensation beads and Axygen 1.1 mL polypropylene cluster tubes for flow cytometry acquisition, by labeling one well and one tube for LIVE/DEAD stain, and one well and one tube per fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibody used for extracellular and intracellular staining.Add one drop of InvitrogenTM UltraComp eBeadsTM to each fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibody well of the V-bottom 96-well plate.Add one drop of Arc Amine-reactive compensation beads to the LIVE/DEAD stain well of the V-bottom 96-well plate.Add 1 μL of each fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibody to the appropriate well of the V-bottom 96-well plate containing UltraComp eBeads. The quantity of stain to use for preparing compensation beads may need to be titrated down if the signal is too high (i.e., if the positive beads are appearing at the edge or off of the axis) when performing flow cytometry acquisition.Add 0.2 μL of LIVE/DEAD stain stock solution to the LIVE/DEAD stain well of the V-bottom 96-well plate.Cover the V-bottom 96-well plate with aluminum foil and incubate for 10 min at room temperature; then, add 100 μL of PBS to each well.",
    "Centrifuge the 96-well plate at 410× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Flick the plate over a waste container or sink to remove the supernatant and resuspend each bead pellet with 200 μL/well of PBS.Add one drop of Arc-negative compensation beads to the LIVE/DEAD stain well of the V-bottom 96-well plate.Transfer into Axygen 1.1 mL polypropylene cluster tubes and store the tubes at 4 °C in a refrigerator until running the samples on the flow cytometer.Flow cytometry sample acquisition using a BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer running FACSDiva This section briefly describes the steps to set up the experiment and acquire the samples using a BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer running FACSDiva. More details and training can be obtained from your flow cytometry core facility. After loading each sample and pressing run, wait several seconds for the event rate to stabilize before acquiring and saving the data.Verify cytometer optical configuration and ensure cytometer setup and tracking (CST) performance settings are up to date.Open a new experiment in FACSDiva and select each fluorescent parameter from the parameter dropdown menu.Load the unstained sample, start acquisition, and adjust the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages to bring the lymphocyte population to a fluorescence value of approximately 105 forward scatter area (FSC-A) and 105 side scatter area (SSC-A) in the FSC-A and SSC-A dot plot.Define the lymphocyte population gate and then adjust PMT voltages for each fluorescent parameter, to have the autofluorescence of the negative (unstained) population at least at three standard deviations above the noise of the instrument for each fluorescent channel. FACSDiva will automatically place a gray box on the plot to guide the adjustment of individual PMT voltages. Voltages should be adjusted until unstained cells appear within this box, but not beyond the right and upper boundary (i.e.",
    ", unstained cells should not be more positive than the gray box).Briefly load a fully stained cell sample into the instrument to verify that all populations are visible on the plots and within range. If populations are out of range, increase the scale and/or decrease the PMT voltage.Save the experiment as a template before calculating compensation for easy setup later if desired.Run each single-stained compensation bead control to correct for fluorescent spillover and manually gate the positive and negative populations. Acquire 10,000 events for each control and select automatic compensation.Run each FMO control tube. FMOs are used as a control for gating each cell population. Acquire enough events to clearly see the autofluorescence of the negative population or acquire the whole sample.Acquire each sample until the event rate begins to drop, indicating that the tube is nearly empty. Quickly end the acquisition and remove the tube to prevent air from entering the flow cell.Export FCS files for analysis on FlowJo and export EXP files if the experiment will be reopened on FACSDiva later.Data analysis using FlowJo This section briefly describes the steps to analyze samples using FlowJo. More details and training can be obtained from your flow cytometry core facility. A representative gating strategy is presented in Figure 7.Import all FCS files into FlowJo.Click on the compensation tab and calculate a new compensation matrix using the single-stained bead samples. Look at each plot in the compensation matrix to ensure that there were no errors in the compensation calculation. Manually adjust compensation values, should any fluorochromes be significantly over or under compensated.Define gates to isolate cells, single cells, live cells, and then each marker of interest.Use each FMO to determine the location and size of the autofluorescence of the negative population to properly gate positive populations.",
    "FMOs are a good starting point for gate placement, especially for fluorochromes that lack clear separation between positive and negative populations. However, manual adjustments from sample to sample are often necessary to account for variability between animals and tissues.Look at the time parameter for each sample to ensure smooth and uninterrupted flow into the flow cell as a quality control check. Gaps or unevenness across the time plot indicate clotting or air bubbles, which can impact the quality of the data.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230516/20230516200214_6281.jpgFigure 7. Representative gating strategy to determine cytokine production by CD4, CD8, and T cells.  A. Cells are first gated in the side scatter area (SSC-A)/forward scatter area (FSC-A) plot. Singlet cells are gated using FSC-A over FSC height (FSC-H). Singlet cells are gated again using SSC-A over SSC height (SSC-H) to further clean up the data. Live cells are gated in the FSC-A/viability dye plot. Then, CD45+ cells are gated in the FSC-A/CD45 plot, followed by CD3+ T cells in the FSC-A/CD3 plot. Then, T-cell receptor (TCR) γδ+ cells are gated from the TCRγδ/CD3 plot, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are gated from the CD8a/CD4 plot. B.
