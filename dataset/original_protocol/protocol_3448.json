    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nOrganoid dissociation\nTiming: 1 h\nWhile it would be optimal to plate intact organoids, issues with size inconsistency and fragility currently make this unrealistic to do in high-throughput. With dissociation into single cells, patient-derived cancer organoids can be easily plated and allowed to reform in each well of a 384-well plate.\nCollect and wash organoids\nWith a P1000 tip, pipette semi-solid cultures repetitively in a circular motion to break up the Matrigel.\nTransfer cultures to a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 340 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C and aspirate media.\nNote: This will be the standard centrifugation step for the remainder of the organoid dissociation.\nWash pelleted organoids with 10 mL cold PBS to remove any residual Matrigel or media, centrifuge as in step 1c, aspirate as much PBS as possible without disturbing the pellet.\nDissociate organoids in TrypLE\nResuspend organoids in 5 mL TrypLE and incubate at 37°C for 30 min, with vigorous pipetting every 10 min to break up cell clumps.\nNote: If the organoids are large, you may need to pipette with a P1000 tip every 5 min to enhance dissociation. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nWhen close to single cell suspension or small clumps, centrifuge as in step 1c.\nAspirate TrypLE, then wash in warm modified DMEM media and centrifuge again as in step 1c.\nPlating organoids in a 384-well format\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Once dissociated, these cells can be plated with established cell suspension plating methods. We utilize two formats of plating, depending on the number of plates needed for the given experiment. The first, which involves plating by hand, is for a small number of plates (≤ 3) or for those who do not have access to high-throughput plating equipment. The other is automated and can be used for large-scale, high-throughput experiments.\nCount cells and prepare media\nCount cells and resuspend to a concentration of 9,500 cells/mL in complete DMEM + 2% Matrigel in a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: We have successfully used 5% Matrigel as well but find that 2% is sufficient for our cultures and purpose. Using higher percentages of Matrigel, in combination with the optional centrifugation step following plating, may allow for enhanced downstream imaging.\nCritical: Although this is a low concentration of Matrigel, the cell suspension will still solidify at ambient temperature within minutes, if not kept on ice. The Matrigel should not be added until right before plating, and the cell suspension should be kept on ice prior to and while plating the cell suspension. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: We have found that 285 cells per well is an ideal starting concentration for the majority of our organoids. However, for particularly slow-growing cultures, we have increased the number up to 1,000 cells per well. We have not had to decrease the number of initial cells below 285/well for any of our cultures to date. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPlate cells\nEquip BioTek EL406 peristaltic pump with a 10 μL wide-bore tip cassette and set to low speed",
    "Note: Dead volume is the excess volume required by a liquid handling instrument. It can be an unusable portion (e.g., residual volume in labware that is not accessible to the instrument) or a used portion that is not transferred to the assay container, such as the volume needed to prime tubing/tips. To decrease dead volume, reduce pre-dispense volume as much as possible. To decrease cross-well dispensing, minimize the height of the tips to the carrier to as low as 1 mm. Dispense from tips should appear as a drop rather than a stream.\nSwirl the tube of cells prior to priming the tubing and before each plate to ensure equal suspension dispensing. Be careful not to introduce air bubbles.\nDispense 30 μL cell suspension per well into the cell-repellent microplates.\nNote: For smaller-scale experiments, cells can be plated using a manual or electronic (repeating) multi-channel P200 pipette. Transfer the cell suspension + Matrigel to an appropriately sized reservoir for the volume size. If possible, place the reservoir on ice to prevent solidification. Avoid introducing bubbles into the media when pipetting.\nOptional: Following cell plating, centrifuge the plate(s) at 220 × g for 1 min to allow cells to be pushed toward the bottom of the well. This helps to bring the cells and clusters (along with the Matrigel) into similar z-planes, which helps to stabilize the cultures for both downstream applications of microscopy and/or refreshing media or adding reagents to the wells.\nAllow organoids to form for at least 24 h in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator\nDrug screening\nTiming: 1–4 days",
    "Once the organoids are plated, they can be used for a number of different screens. We have used this format for primary screening of a large drug library and collection of dose-effect data for multiple drugs in a single experiment. Likewise, this could be modified for functional genomics screens (e.g., CRISPR, siRNA, etc.), phenotypic screening (e.g., high-content imaging), or other cellular read outs or functional assays.\nDrug screening\nDispense 10 μL of treatment at 4× the desired concentration (bringing total well volume to 40 μL) to wells of each plate, including replicates and appropriate vehicle controls.\nNote: If using DMSO, maximum DMSO concentration should be determined empirically for any organoid lines prior to drug screening. For all organoids we have screened to date, our DMSO concentrations do not exceed 0.1%.\nFor large screens, drug libraries may be “stamped” into organoid plates utilizing a Bravo automated pipette liquid transfer system, which holds a 384-well tip head to simultaneously dispense reagents from a drug source plate to each organoid plate within seconds.\nNote: Drugs may also be added using a multi-channel pipette if necessary.\nIncubate plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for the desired treatment time (24–96 h)\nData collection and analysis\nNote: Either method below can be used, however we do not recommend using both methods on the same cultures.\nFluorescent Imaging of Live/Dead Cells\n24 h prior to the end of drug treatment, add propidium iodide to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL to the wells.\nIncubate at 37°C for 24 h.\nAdd Hoechst to the wells at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL to the wells.\nIncubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nAdd Calcein AM to the wells at a final concentration of 5 μM.\nIncubate for 1 h.\nImage with a fluorescence microscope.\nCellTiter-Glo 3D",
    "Optional: Image organoids before adding CellTiter-Glo 3D\nUsing the Bravo liquid handler or a multi-channel pipette, add 40 μL CellTiter-Glo 3D to the wells and mix vigorously to break up and lyse organoids\nNote: Check the wells under a microscope following this step to ensure that all organoids have been broken up. Repeat vigorous pipetting as necessary until none remain. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: Make sure not to introduce bubbles when mixing, as it will impact the readout from the plate reader and introduce errors in the data.\nPlace plates on a plate shaker for 25 min (up to 800 RPMs).\nCentrifuge the plates to eliminate any bubbles and to draw all liquid to the bottom of the well.\nQuantify luminescence with a plate reader\nDetermine drug effect by subtracting the control luminescence from the treatment luminescence, then plot against drug concentration for each treatment using Excel or GraphPad Prism."
