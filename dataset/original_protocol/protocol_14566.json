    "All animal experiments were approved by the regional ethics committee (the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, LANUV, Germany) according to German Animal Protection Law. The local ethics committee of the University of Münster approved the use of human tissues for histological and microscope analysis.\n1. Animals and Materials\nUse female or male mice of the required DSS-susceptible strain that weigh 20 to 25 g, and house according to local animal care legislation. Provide special chow for rodents and autoclaved drinking water ad libitum.\nInduce acute DSS colitis by administering 3% w/v dextran sulfate sodium (DSS, molecular weight: 36,000-50,000 Da) in autoclaved tap water for 5 days.\nNOTE: The potency of DSS is highly variable depending on manufacturer and batch. Test your supplier-provided DSS first for induction of disease activity, for which daily body weight is a reliable and objective indicator.\nFor histological evaluation of colonic tissue samples, euthanize mice by CO2 insufflation (or as specified by national and institutional guidelines) at the end of the experiment.\n2. Experimental Setup for DSS-colitis and In-vitro Wound Healing Assays\nCell culture and establishment of wound healing assay.\n\t\nGrow Caco-2 cells in a 95% humidity and 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C. Use RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nSeed Caco-2 cells at a density of 4 x 105 cells/cm2 on 35 mm Petri dishes with high culture-insert (see Figure 4A).\nNOTE: The insert generates two cell covered areas that are separated with a defined cell free space representing the wounded area to be analyzed.\nChange medium two days after seeding. Perform by first aspirating residual medium with cell debris by using an automatic pipette, rinse with 100 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and add fresh RPMI medium or serum-deprived medium.",
    "Culture cells for 24 hr in serum-deprived medium (0.1% FBS) supplemented with 20 ng EGF/ml serum or 2 µg mitomycin c/ml serum to detect alterations in wound healing behavior. Add normal RPMI medium to control cells for 24 hr.\nAfter 24 hr of culture, remove and discard culture inserts as described in step 3.4 and perform DHM.\nInduction of acute DSS colitis\n\t\nDissolve 3 g of DSS in 100 ml autoclaved water to get a 3% (w/v) DSS solution. Provide this solution in place of drinking water to mice ad libitum for 7 days. Calculate 5 ml of DSS-solution per mouse/day. Provide autoclaved water without DSS for control mice ad libitum.\nPreparation of cryostatic sections of murine and human colon\n\t\nEuthanize mice by CO2 insufflation at the end of the experiment.\nDissect the animals' abdomen by laparotomy23. Remove the whole colon carefully using tweezers and cut the ileal and rectal end using surgical scissors. Cut the colon with a scissors longitudinally from the cecal to the rectal end and open the colon. Remove all feces from the specimen using tweezers followed by washing with PBS24.\nPrepare Swiss rolls by rolling up the whole colon with a cotton bud longitudinally from the cecal to the rectal end with the mucosa curved inwards. Embed colonic samples in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and keep frozen at -80 °C until further use.\nEmbed human colonic tissue from surgical specimen in optimal cutting temperature OCT compound and keep frozen at -80 °C until further use.\nCut sections of 7 µm thickness of the OCT-compound-embedded specimens with the help of a cryotome just prior to examination.",
    "​NOTE: The optimum sample thickness depends on the persistence and the scattering properties of the tissue type under investigation. For the described experiments using colon tissue, slice thickness > 10 µm cause significant increase in noise due to light scattering in quantitative DHM phase contrast images, while samples of thickness < 5 µm show a higher risk for damage induced artefacts from the cryo cutting process.\nTransfer sections on to a glass object carrier slide.\n3. Technical Equipment, Software and Procedures for Acquisition and Evaluation of Digital Holograms\nDigital holographic microscope for quantitative cell and tissue imaging\n\t\nUse an off-axis Mach-Zehnder digital holographic microscopy system for live cell imaging25, as shown in Figure 1. Ensure that the microscope is equipped with a 10X microscope lens, a microscope stage with a holder for glass object carrier slides and Petri dishes with a diameter of 35 mm, a heating chamber to preserve physiological temperature at 37 °C and software for quantitative phase imaging25.\nNOTE: For example, as described in Kemper et al.26 and Langehanenberg et al.27.\nNOTE: Alternatively, use a similar system that is capable of performing bright field microscopy and quantitative phase imaging of living cells and dissected tissue slides.\nClean microscope lens and condenser with lens cleaning paper and a cleaning agent (e.g., ethanol) as recommended by the manufacturer of the microscope to remove dust or other contaminations.\nStart the image acquisition software of the DHM microscope, select \"bright field\" imaging mode and switch \"on\" white light illumination. Ensure Köhler-illumination of the sample as recommended by the microscope manufacturer while observing the sample in the live imaging window of the image acquisition software (alternatively a standard image acquisition software can be used in this step).",
    "NOTE: The image intensity should be distributed homogeneously in the field of view and the sample position should not move during optical refocusing with the focus drive of the microscope.\nSelect \"DHM\" imaging mode, turn \"off\" white light illumination and switch \"on\" the laser light. Check that the illumination with laser light is homogeneous (i.e., that light intensity is homogeneously distributed in the live imaging window of the imaging acquisition software of the DHM microscope) and observe that the off-axis carrier interference fringe pattern appears with adequate contrast in the captured images (digital holograms).\nPreparation of cryostat sections for imaging with DHM\n\t\nTake the sample (cryostat section on a glass object carrier, thickness: 7 µm, as described in 2.3) out of the freezer. Defrost the sample for about 5 min at RT and normal atmosphere.\nAdd 50 - 100 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as embedding medium onto the tissue section using a pipette until it is completely covered with buffer. Cover the sample with a clean glass cover slip (glass thickness 170 µm).\n\t\tNOTE: Over-drying can induce significant changes of the refractive index and scattering properties of the sample.\nEnsure that the bottom of the glass carrier and the cover slip are cleaned from dust and other contamination that may induce light scattering. The sample is ready for investigation with bright field microscopy and DHM.\nQuantitative phase imaging of tissue sections with DHM\n\t\nSwitch on the digital holographic microscope, choose the 10X microscope lens for imaging. Start the image acquisition software of the DHM microscope and select bright file imaging mode.\nPlace the tissue slide as described in 2) in the microscope slide holder, with the cover slip facing the microscope objective.",
    "Switch \"on\" the bright field illumination of the DHM microscope. Position the sample with the microscope stage and ensure that the tissue area of interest is visible in the live monitoring window. Improve the sharpness of the image using the microscope's focus drive.\nNOTE: As well as the area of interest, an area of slide without tissue should also be present in the field of view.\nCapture a bright field image of the sharply focused sample using the image acquisition software.\nSelect \"DHM\" imaging mode, turn \"off\" the white light illumination and turn \"on\" the laser light illumination. Select the \"exposure time\" for hologram recording below 3 msec, observe that holographic off-axis interference fringes appear with adequate contrast in the live imaging window of the imaging acquisition software and capture a digital hologram.\nRepeat steps 3.3.3 - 3.3.5 until a sufficient number of bright field images and digital holograms of different sample areas have been recorded. Hologram acquisition is now complete.\nPreparation of wound healing assays for DHM imaging\n\t\nSwitch on the Petri dish heating chamber of the DHM microscope about 1 - 3 hr prior to the start of the experiment to ensure stable temperature conditions during the DHM measurements.\nPrepare workbench with the required equipment (Petri dish for wound healing assay is described in 2.3): pipettes, tweezers, glass lid for Petri dish, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffered cell culture medium with physiological temperature (37 °C) for sample preparation in sterile environment.\n\t\t​NOTE: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) is composed of 10 % fetal calve serum (FCS), 20 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), and 850 mg/L NaHCO3.\nRemove the plastic lid from the Petri dish and remove the cell culture medium with a pipette. Remove the insert from the Petri dish bottom using tweezers.",
    "Wash the sample 1 - 2 times with 1 ml HEPES buffered cell culture medium in order to remove dead cells and remaining cellular components (e.g., serum) in the wound area. Add 2 ml HEPES buffered cell culture medium and cap the Petri dish with the glass lid.\nEnsure that the glass lid and the Petri dish bottom have been cleaned from dust and other contamination. Sample is ready for time lapse observation with DHM.\nContinuous multimodal monitoring of wound healing in vitro with DHM\n\t\nSwitch on the Petri dish heating chamber of the DHM microscope about 1 - 3 hr prior to the start of the experiment to ensure stable temperature conditions during the DHM measurements.\nSwitch \"on\" the digital holographic microscope, select the 10X microscope lens for imaging. Start the image acquisition software of the DHM microscope and select \"bright field\" imaging mode. Ensure that the heating chamber for the Petri dish is operating a physiological temperature (37 °C).\nPlace the Petri dish with the wound healing assay, prepared as described in 4), in the heating chamber of the DHM microscope.\nSelect bright field imaging mode and position the sample with the microscope stage while observing it in the live monitoring window of the image acquisition software of the DHM microscope. Observe that the desired area of the sample appears sharply focused under white light illumination.\nCapture bright field images of different areas of the sample (wound area and surrounding areas with confluent cells) under white light illumination with the image acquisition software and document appearance, cell density and homogeneity.",
    "Select \"bright field\" imaging mode of the DHM microscope. Choose a suitable wound area under white light illumination in the live monitoring window with the image acquisition software of the DHM microscope. Ensure the wound area is free from dead cells and no serum remains, and ensure that both sides include a single homogeneous cell layer, preferably with straight borders.\nCapture a white light image of the initial wound area in bright field imaging mode with the image acquisition software of the DHM microscope.\nTurn \"off\" white light illumination, select \"DHM\" mode and switch \"on\" laser illumination. Select an exposure time of below 3 msec for hologram recording (observe that holographic off-axis interference fringes appear with adequate contrast in the live imaging window of the image acquisition software of the DHM microscope) and capture a digital hologram.\nCapture a sample hologram in DHM mode with the image acquisition software and reconstruct a quantitative phase image with the reconstruction software of the DHM microscope in order to check the image quality.\nSelect a suitable time delay (e.g., 3 - 5 min) for time-lapse hologram acquisition with the image acquisition software of the DHM microscope.\nSelect the time-lapse acquisition mode of the image acquisition software in which the sample is only illuminated with laser light during hologram acquisition.\nStart the time-lapse DHM observation of the wound healing assay.\nStop the time-lapse acquisition after the intended time, select bright field imaging mode and document the final appearance of the sample under white light imaging.\nReconstruct digital holograms of dissected tissues and determine the average refractive index as a parameter to quantify tissue density\n\t\nReconstruct quantitative phase images from the digital holograms of dissected tissues with the software of the DHM microscope, e.g., as described in Kemper et al.26 and Langehanenberg et al.27.",
