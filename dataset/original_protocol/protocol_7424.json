    "Prepare total cell membrane Streak the glycerol stock of BL21 (DE3) star plysS strain expressing the YejM/LapB complex on an LB agar plate containing 50 µg/mL of kanamycin sulfate, 50 µg/mL of spectinomycin, and 25 µg/mL chloramphenicol (Kan+Spe+Cam+). Incubate the plate at 37 °C on a microbiological incubator overnight.Inoculate a single colony from the overnight culturing plate into 20 mL of LB medium (Kan+Spe+Cam+) in a 125 mL flask. Grow the cells at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm overnight.Transfer 10 mL of overnight culture to 1 L of TB medium (Kan+Spe+Cam+) in 2,800 mL flasks (2 L in total). Grow the cells at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm to OD600 of 0.6.Add 200 µL of 1 M IPTG to 1 L of cell culture (final concentration 0.2 mM) and incubate the cells at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for another 4 h.Centrifuge the culture at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to harvest the cells.Resuspend the cell pellet in 40 mL of lysis buffer (see Recipes) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and 5 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol. At this step, resuspended cells can be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a -80 °C ultra-low temperature freezer, or move on directly to step A7 to break the cells.Transfer the cells to a 40 mL tissue grinder. Homogenize the cells by pushing and pulling the grind pestle 10–20 times.Break the cells in a high-pressure microfluidizer at 15,000 psi with two passes.Transfer the broken cells to 50 mL centrifuge tubes and remove cell debris by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a 70 mL ultracentrifuge bottle and add lysis buffer to the final volume of ~50 mL. Carefully balance the ultracentrifuge bottles.",
    "Ultracentrifuge in a Beckman Coulter type 45Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm (185,677 × g) for 2 h at 4 °C. Keep the membrane pellet after centrifugation.Separate inner and outer membranes Resuspend ~3 g of membrane in 55 mL of 20% sucrose with a 40 mL tissue grinder.Prepare six 37 mL ultracentrifuge tubes. In each tube, from the bottom to the top, layer 14 mL of 73% sucrose, 14 mL of 53% sucrose, and 9 mL of membrane resuspended in 20% sucrose.Ultracentrifuge without braking at 23,000 rpm (65,000 × g) in a SW 28 rotor for 18 h at 4 °C.After separation, there should be two bands: the upper band is the IM and the lower one is the OM (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4638/bioprotoc-13-06-4638-g001.jpgFigure 1. Separation of IM and OM Cut the end of a P1000 pipette tip, approximately 5 mm from the point. Collect the upper IM layer using the pipette.Use a new pipette tip and repeat step B5 to collect the OM layer.To remove sucrose from the membrane, transfer the IM and OM fractions into 70 mL ultracentrifuge bottles. Add dilution buffer into the bottles to a final sucrose concentration of <10%. Carefully balance the ultracentrifuge bottles.Ultracentrifuge in a Beckman Coulter type 45Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm (185,677 × g) for 2 h at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and weigh the wet weight of the membrane. For 1 g of the membrane, add 10 mL of lysis buffer to resuspend using a 40 mL tissue grinder.Flash-freeze the membrane with liquid nitrogen and store in a -80 °C ultra-low temperature freezer."
