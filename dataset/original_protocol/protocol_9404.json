    "1. Preparation\nBefore starting, assemble the required surgical instruments, dissection and culture media, and 7 day old rat or mouse pups.  The protocol is the same for mouse and rat preparations.\n(i) Materials and equipment\nOperating scissors (straight length 6\", cat# RS6818, Roboz, Gaithersburg, MD)\nMicro dissecting scissors, (length 4'\", cat# RS5910. Roboz, Gaithersburg, MD)\nCarbon Steel Dumont Tweezers (cat# RS-5045.Roboz, Gaithersburg, MD)\nModified glass \"transfer\" pipettes (bottom of Pasteur pipette removed and edge smoothed)\nAclar plastic film cut to 2\"in x 2\" in squares (Honeywell, # 812071, Pottsville, PA)\nCover sponges 4 in by 3 in ( Kendall , cat# 3157,Mansfield, MA)\n30 mm Millicell membrane inserts (0.4 μm; Millipore, Bedford, MA)\nMcllwain Tissue chopper with double-edged razor blade (McILwain tissue chopper,  Vibratome Company, St. Louis, MO)\nInverted microscope with CCD camera and image analysis software\n(ii) Dissection Medium (DM; 1 liter at pH 7.3)\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nHank's Balanced Salt,1 vial ( 95.2 g/1L) ( Sigma : H2387 )\nNHCO3 ( 4.2 mM),350 mg\nHEPES (10 mM),2.83 g\nGlucose ( 33.3 mM),6.0 g\nPenicillin/streptomycin (100x),10 mL\nBSA (0.3%),300 mg\nMgSO4-7H2O,1.44 g\n(iii) Culture medium (400 mL)\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nMEM (Invitrogen 11575-032),200 mL\n***Hank's Balance Salt(Invitrogen 24020-117),100 mL\nHorse serum (Invitrogen 26050-070),100 mL\nHEPES buffer (1 M; Invitrogen 15630-080),5 mL\nPenicillin/Streptomycin (100x),4 mL\n***Add 12.8 g glucose to 500 mL Hank's Balance Salt before making culture medium,***Add 12.8 g glucose to 500 mL Hank's Balance Salt before making culture medium\n(iv) Animals\n7 day old rat or mouse postnatal pups, generally one litter per experiment.\n2. On the Day of Culture\nAll dissection tools and Aclar film must be soaked in 70% ETOH for 30 minutes before beginning. The surface of the dissection hood, blade, and tissue chopper must be disinfected with ethanol.",
    "Prepare several (3-4) 6 well tissue culture plates; add 1 mL culture medium per well, and insert a Millipore permeable membrane in each well.  Place 6-well plates in the 37° incubator until ready to transfer slices.\nPrepare several (4-6) 60 mm plates with DM and place on ice.   \nRapidly decapitate with scissors and dip in 70% ETOH, and quickly expose the brain with a saggital incision of the skull. Carefully remove the brain and place immediately in cold DM. Separate it into two hemispheres and place each hemisphere medial side down on a cover sponge for 2-3 seconds.\nGently lift and place the hemisphere onto the Aclar film square and place on the tissue chopper; cut the brain coronally in 350 μm sections.  When finished, gently take the Alcar square with the sectioned hemisphere and submerge in cold DM.\nUsing a dissecting microscope, separate out the hippocampal sections. For rat, there should be 5 sections spanning rostral to caudal hippocampus, and for mouse there should be 3-4 sections.\nTake out the 6-well plates with membrane inserts from the 37° tissue culture incubator.  Transfer hippocampal slices individually onto the permeable membranes using the glass transfer pipette.  If too much DM is released onto the membrane, remove excess DM with a Pasteur pipette.  Place five hippocampal slices on each membrane.  Allow at least 3 wells per condition, or 15 slices.\nIncubate the culture plates at 37° in a 5% CO humidified incubator for 12-14 days before beginning the toxicity experiment. The culture medium can be changed twice a week.\n3. Inducing and Quantifying Hippocampal Neuronal Injury in Slice Culture\nAfter 12-14 days in culture, add 5 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) to the culture media.  This step will allow visualization and quantification of basal cell death.",
    "The following day, quantify PI fluorescence in the CA1 subregion (and/or CA3 or dentate if desired) of each hippocampal slice and obtain mean the PI fluorescence measurements representing basal cell death (referred to as time=0 hours, or T0).  For image acquisition and quantification, we use OpenLab software (Improvision, U.K.), but other image acquisition and analysis software can be used to quantify fluorescence intensity.\nImmediately after image acquisition of T0 PI fluorescence, induce neuronal injury by your method of choice (we have used 10 μM NMDA, oxygen-glucose deprivation, or LPS for one hour to induce neuronal toxicity 2,5).  After the toxic stimulus, replace medium with fresh medium containing 5 μg/mL PI and maintain slices overnight.\nOn day 3, quantify mean PI fluorescence of the experimental condition at 24h, or T24.\nAfter this image acquisition, immediately change medium and add 10 μM NMDA and 5 μg/mL PI and incubate slices overnight to achieve maximal neuronal death. \nOn day 4, quantify mean PI fluorescence of maximal neuronal death, defined as Tmax.  Calculate percent cell death as follows: (T24 - T0) / (Tmax-T0) .\n4. Representative Results\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2106/2106fig1.jpgFigure 1.
