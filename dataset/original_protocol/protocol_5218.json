    "Mature pollen grain collectionUse 20 x 10 cm envelope to collect the mature pollen grains (MPGs) at noon (11:00 AM-1:00 PM) when the anthers are dehiscing.Transfer the MPGs to 50 ml tubes.Use the MPGs immediately or add allochroic silica gels to them and then store at -80 °C.In vitro pollen germinationThe initiation procedures of in vitro germination are different for lily and rice pollen. For lily pollen, there should be a pretreatment to wash out the thick lipid coat, while the thin-walled rice pollen does not need this wash.Lilium davidii pollen germination Note: This procedure was modified from Ren et al. (1998) and Prado et al. (2004). Transfer the -80 °C stored MPGs to -20 °C in the dark for 2 weeks before the in vitro germination. Put 0.5 g MPGs into a dark, humid environment at 4 °C for 10 h.Note: The dark, humid environment is custom made as follows: Put MPGs in a Petri dish (60 x 15 mm) (Figure 1A), covered with gauze (Figure 1B), and then placed them in a larger Petri dish (150 x 25 mm) with 50 ml ddH2O (Figure 1C). This arrangement only permitted gauze contact with the ddH2O, do not let the MPGs contact the ddH2O directly. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170515/20170515024015_4717.jpgFigure 1. Set up of the humid environment. A. Put 0.5 g lily MPGs in a 60 x 15 mm Petri dish; B. Cover the Petri dish with four layers of gauzes; C. Put the set of B into a 150 x 25 mm Petri dish with 50 ml ddH2O.Wash the MPGs twice with 5 ml germination medium in a 10 ml tube and discard the flow-through after centrifuging at room temperature at 4,500 x g for 5 min.",
    "Put the washed MPGs (Figure 2A) into 100 ml germination medium in a Petri dish (60 x 15 mm), and then incubate them in the dark at 28 °C for 2 h with gentle shaking at 75 rpm/min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170515/20170515024201_6982.jpgFigure 2. Morphology of Lilium davidii and Oryza sativa MPGs and GPGs. A. Lilium davidii MPGs; B. Lilium davidii MPGs in vitro germinated for 2 h; C. Oryza sativa MPGs; D. Oryza sativa MPGs in vitro germinated for 15 min. Bars = 50 μm.Use microscope with 5x objective to observe the germination rate, make sure the germination rate is more than 90% and the pollen tube is approximately 500 μm long (Figure 2B).Collect the germinated pollen grains (GPGs) by using 100 μm cell strainers, discard the flow-through that contains the ungerminated MPGs.Use the GPGs immediately or store them (transfer the mass retained by the strainer to 50 ml tubes, do not add any solution) at -80 °C.Oryza sativa pollen germination Note: This procedure was modified from Dai et al. (2007). Put 0.5 g freshly collected MPGs (Figure 2C) immediately into 100 ml germination medium in a Petri dish and culture them at room temperature with gentle shaking for about 15 min. Note: Rice MPGs must be freshly collected, if not, they will lose the activity for germination.Use microscope with 10x objective for observation to get synchronously germinated pollen tubes (Figure 2D).Note: If pollen germination is not synchronized, or the germination rate is less than 80%, the material should not be used for GPGs PM proteomic analysis.  Collect the GPGs through centrifugation at 4 °C, 1,000 x g, 5 min. Use the GPGs immediately or store at -80 °C.Microsomal vesicles isolationUse 6 ml homogenate buffer to suspend 0.",
    "5 g pollens (MPGs or GPGs) in a 50 ml beaker, and then transfer the suspension to three 2 ml microtubes with equal volume.Note: Lily MPGs should be washed as step B1c before starting step C1. Homogenize the pollens in 2 ml microtubes by using the FastPrep®-24 at the speed of 6.5 m/sec for 120 sec.Note: For rice pollens, using the speed of 6.5 m/sec for 30 sec is enough.Centrifuge the suspension at 4 °C, 1,500 x g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and then transfer the supernatants to new tubes.Centrifuge the resulting supernatants at 4 °C, 12,000 x g for 20 min to remove mitochondria, then transfer the supernatants to new tubes. Centrifuge the resulting supernatants at 4 °C, 31,000 x g for 15 min to remove other organelle contaminants, then transfer the supernatants to ultracentrifuge tubes.Ultracentrifuge the resulting supernatants at 4 °C, 100,000 x g for 1 h, the resulting pellets are the total microsomal vesicles (MSVs).Plasma membrane enrichmentAqueous polymer two-phase system is an effective tool to enrich plasma membrane.The following protocol was designed according to the principle of Schindler and Nothwang (2006).Suspend the MSVs in 1.2 ml plasma membrane (PM) isolation buffer.Put 1.0 g suspended MSVs into the 8.0 g aqueous polymer two-phase system, mix by vortex and then centrifuge at 4 °C, 4,200 x g for 30 min.Note: The aqueous polymer two-phase system were prepared by using the electronic balance, because the concentrations of the components PEG 3350 and Dextran T-500 were mass ratios (see Recipes). Transfer 3.0 ml of the top layer into another 8.0 g aqueous polymer two-phase system, mix and then centrifuge at 4 °C, 4,200 x g for 30 min.Repeat step D3 once.Transfer 3.",
    "0 ml of the top layer to an ultracentrifuge tube, dilute it 3-5 folds with dilution buffer, centrifuge at 4 °C, 200,000 x g for 1 h. The resulting pellets are PM vesicles.Suspend the resulting pellets with 50 μl dilution buffer for immediate use or store this suspension at -80 °C.Plasma membrane purificationAlkaline solution can change the PM vesicles into PM sheets to remove the imbedded cytoplasm. The following protocol was mainly according to Fujiki et al. (1982).Dilute the PM vesicles with the washing buffer to protein concentration at 0.02~1.00 μg/μl.Keep in an ice-bath for 30 min with occasionally vortexing at every 10 min.Centrifuge at 4 °C, 50,000 x g for 1 h. Discharge the supernatants and the resulting pellets are the purified PM.Wash the purified PM pellets gently with cold ddH2O, don’t suspend the pellets, and then discard the ddH2O. Note: Usually, starting with 0.5 g pollen can get about 20 μg purified PM proteins. Their purity can be tested through Western blot by using antibodies for PM-specific P-type H+-ATPase and some organelle specific proteins, such as nuclear protein histone H1.Use the purified PM immediately or store the pellets at -80 °C."
