    "Lysis buffer: 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 µM tris-carboxyethyl phosphine, and 1% Pluornic-127 and 1% octyl-β-glucoside. The buffer can be prepared ahead of time, filtered using 0.2 m filter, and stored at 4 ºC. We routinely store buffers for 2 months without loss of activity or generation of reactive adducts.\nCell Lysis and Proteome Extraction:\n1. Wash harvested cells three times with 1 mL with cold phosphate–buffered saline solution by centrifuging at 1500 g for 5 minutes.\n  2. Suspend 2 million cells in 150 µl of ice-cold lysis buffer, vortex, and transfer to Covaris tubes.\n  3. Lyse cells using the Covaris E220 adaptive focused acoustic sonicator using 13x65 mm tubes and operating in the frequency sweep mode at 500 Hz, 20% duty cycle, and intensity 8 for 600 seconds at 4 ºC.\n  4. Clarify the lysate by centrifuging at 16,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 ºC. \n  5. Carry out the native proteome assay \\(protein-protein interaction, enzymatic activity, drug binding) as needed. \n  \nDetergent removal using chloroform methanol precipitation of proteins:\n1. Measure protein concentration using bicinchoninic acid assay kit.\n  2. Use about 20 μg of protein for the in-solution digest.\n  3. Adjust the protein volume to 100 µl.\n  4. Add 400 µl of methanol, 300 µl volumes of water and 100 µl of chloroform to the protein solution and vortex for 1 minute.\n  5. Centrifuge sample at 14,000 g for 1 minute.\n  6. Aspirate the aqueous phase above the interface layer. The protein precipitate should appear at the interface. \n  7. Add 200 µl methanol, vortex for 1 minute and centrifuge at 16000 g for 5 minutes. \n  8. Remove the supernatant and dry the pellets using vacuum centrifuge.",
    "9. Resuspend the protein pellet in 150 µl of 0.1% \\(w/v) RapiGest in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 by shaking at 37 ºC for 30 minutes.\n  \nReduction and alkylation of proteins:\n10. Reduce disulfide bonds by adding DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubating at 56 ºC for 45 minutes.\n  11. Cool to room temperature, add iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 15 mM to alkylate cysteine residues, vortex and incubate sample in the dark for 20 minutes at room temperature.\n  12. Quench residual iodoacetamide by adding DTT to a final concentration of 20 mM and incubating at room temperature for 15 minutes.\n  \nDigestion of proteins:\n13. Add endoproteinase Lys-C at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 and incubate at 37 °C for 6 hours.\n  14. Add trypsin at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:25 and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\n  15. Add hydrochloric acid to a final concentration of 200 mM to stop digestion and cleave RapiGest. \n  16. Incubate the sample at 37 ºC for 45 minutes.\n  17. Centrifuge the sample at 14,000 g for 20 minutes. \n  18. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh Eppendorf tube.\n  \nSolid phase extraction of peptides\n19. Equilibrate NEST MicroSpin C18 reverse phase column with 100 µl of methanol by centrifuging at 110 g for 1 minute.\n  20. Wash two times with 100 µl of 0.5% formic acid in water by centrifuging for 1 minute at 110 g.\n  21. Load tryptic peptides on the column and centrifuge at 220 g for 2 minutes.\n  22. Wash column three times with 100 µl of 0.5% formic acid in water by centrifuging for 2 minutes at 220 g. \n  23. Elute peptides from column with 80% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid by centrifuging at 110 g for 2 minutes.",
