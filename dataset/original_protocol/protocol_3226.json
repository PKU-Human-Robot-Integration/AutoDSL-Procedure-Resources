    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRetrovirus RCAS(A) infection of chicken lens primary cells – Day 23\nTiming: 24 h\nThe following experimental steps are used to infect the lens primary cells with high-titer. Recombinant replication competent avian sarcoma-leukosis virus long terminal repeat with splice acceptor (A) (RCAS[A]) retroviruses for expression of Cx50, or impaired Cx50 HCs (Cx50 mutants H156N).\nNote: For troubleshooting steps for cell infection, see troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.5].\nAdd 10 μL of RCAS(A) virus (∼1–10 × 106 CFU/mL) concentrate containing vehicle, Cx50 WT, or Cx50 H156N to cultured primary chicken lens cells on 12-well plates or 60-mm dishes.\nOn the second day, replace with fresh complete medium of primary lens cells before subsequent experiments.\nNote: Confirmation of cell retroviral infection can be done using western blot for anti-flag protein (Shi et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: There are no pause points from step 2 to step 11, given the nature of the experiments. The whole process needs to be done without breaks due to the time limitation of fluorescence quenching.\nPretreatment of cells with PKA activators followed by FFSS – Day 24\nTiming: 8 h\nThe following experimental steps are used to confirm the activation of HCs in primary lens fiber cells by PKA activators. The purpose of using fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) after PKA pretreatment of primary lens fiber cells is to enhance open HCs, because in the pre-experiments, we found that the experimental results after purely using PKA to treat primary lens fiber cells were not obvious, and biologically, the lens organ is under the action of FFSS in the body.\nTreat primary lens fiber cells with or without PKA activator.",
    "Treat primary lens fiber cells with or without PKA activator: forskolin (1 μM) for 2 h cultured in a 60 mm dish with a 40 mm cell culture slide within it.\nCollect the culture medium in another tube for later use (Step 6a).\nNote: We tested different concentrations of Forskolin (1 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM), and we found that cells were healthy under 1 μM Forskolin treatment, while 5 μM and 10 μM seemed to have a toxic effect on the cells.\nFFSS. The complete system includes: 125 mL glass bottle, pressure pump, rubber tubing system, flow rate indicator, precision FCS2/FCS3 cell booster chamber, and 40 mm cell culture slides (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2995-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Instrument for fluid flow shear stress (FFSS)\n(1) 125 mL glass bottle, (2) pressure pump, (3) rubber tubing system, (4) flow rate indicator, and (5) precision FCS2/FCS3 cell booster chamber.\nCheck the airtightness of the FCS2/FCS3 system.\nClean the FCS2/FCS3 system with 70% alcohol for 30 min, and then wash it with ddH2O for 3 times, 10 min each time.\nPreheat 125 mL of FFSS loading buffer (RM) in a constant temperature water bath at 37°C.\nAssemble the FCS2/FCS3 system.\nClamp the liquid outflow rubber tube and the balance air rubber tube.\nRinse the FCS2/FCS3 system with RM at high flow to remove air bubbles.\nLoosen the clamped rubber tube to adjust the flow rate to the set value (14 mL/min).\nClamp the rubber pipes at both ends of the cell booster chamber, take out the cell booster chamber and unscrew the cell booster chamber clockwise.\nPut the FCS2/FCS3 40 mm cell culture slides seeded with cells (with a 60 mm dish) into the cell booster chamber and tighten it.",
    "Connect the rubber tubes at both ends to the cell booster chamber and loosen the clamped rubber tubes to operate the FCS2/FCS3 system normally.\nNote: Gently tap the upper end of the cell force chamber to expel air bubbles in the cell force chamber.\nLoad cells with FFSS for 30 min (for FFSS issues see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.7]).\nUpon completion, clamp the rubber pipes at both ends of the cell force chamber, and take out the cell culture slide in the cell force chamber for subsequent experiments.\nIncubate primary lens fiber cells with GSH.\nIncubate lens primary fiber cells with 200 μL 1 mM GSH for 10 min in cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).\nWash cells three times with RM at RT, 5 min each time.\nTreatment of lens primary fiber cells with H2O2 (More detail tips with H2O2 see troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.9]).\nAdd the previously collected and preserved cell culture medium (37°C) to the cells.\nTreat lens primary fiber cells with 50 μM H2O2 for 4 h (add on side of cell culture dish and gently mix).\nWash cells three times with DPBS (RT), 5 min for each time.\nDetect cell apoptosis and necrosis using Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit – Day 24\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following experimental steps are used to confirm that PKA activator increase GSH transportation after HCs opening to protect lens primary fiber cells from apoptosis and necrosis.\nWash cells twice with cold BioLegend’s Cell Staining Buffer.\nPrepare FITC-Annexin V and PI mixed solution, 230 μL per lens primary fiber cell sample (200 μL Annexin V Binding Buffer, 10 μL Annexin V, 20 μL PI).\nAdd 230 μL of FITC-Annexin V and PI mixed solution to the cells and incubate for 20 min at room temperature (25°C) in the dark.",
    "Wash cells three times with cold DPBS, 5 min for each time.\nCapture at least five microphotographs of fluorescence fields by a fluorescence microscope (Keyence BZ-X710) with a FITC and rhodamine filter (For imaging see troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.11]).\nUse the ratio of positive staining area to total area of lentoids to indicate the extent of cells under apoptosis or necrosis.\nNote: All cells were photographed within 4 h to prevent fluorescence quenching."
