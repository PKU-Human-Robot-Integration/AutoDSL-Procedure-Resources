    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransfer MCF10A acini from Matrigel to collagen gel\nTiming: 2 h\nMCF10A acini grown on Matrigel for 10 days are transferred into collagen gel.\nGently aspirate the medium from the well and wash with PBS once.\nNote: Do not use an aspirator to remove the medium from the well. Use a pipette and gently wash. Otherwise, acini can be sucked up by the aspirator.\nPut 8 well chamber coverglass with cells on ice and add 500 μL of cold cell recovery solution to each well.\nIncubate on ice for 30 min.\nNote: In this step, Matrigel may detach from the coverglass, but it is not a problem.\nNote: Do not incubate too long on ice. This would cause loss of the basement membrane surrounding the acini.\nAliquot 2–3 mL of cold PBS in 15 mL tube.\nGently mix the cell recovery solution and Matrigel 3–5 times by pipetting in the chamber well until Matrigel is dissociated.\nCollect the mixed solution into the aliquoted PBS in step 4.\nAdd 500 μL of cold PBS to the well. Wash the well with PBS and collect the solution into the same tube in step 6. This step will increase the total number of the acini collected.\nOptional: To collect as many acini as possible, repeat step 7.\nSpin down at 1,200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant and re-suspend with 8–10 mL of cold PBS.\nNote: Leave a small amount of supernatant behind, rather than trying to remove all the supernatant. This ensures that the acini pellet is not aspirated.\nSpin down at 1,200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend with 500 μL of growth medium. Keep on ice.",
    "Note: Leave a small amount of supernatant when remove it by aspirator, and then remove all supernatant by a pipet.\nAdd growth medium, 0.2 M HEPES and 0.5 M NaOH to the resuspension and mix well. Then add collagen type 1 solution and mix gently.\nNote: The concentration and pH of commercial collagen type 1 solution is batch dependent, so it must be adjusted to the target values. Before starting the experiment, test how much amount growth medium and 0.5 M NaOH should be added to the collagen mixture in the small batch. pH of collagen mixture is checked by litmus paper and adjusted to around pH7.5.\nNote: To resuspend acini with collagen mixture, add collagen type 1 solution in the last step. This makes it easy to mix the viscous solution.\nCritical: The mixture which includes collagen must always be kept on ice before gelling.\nCritical: Do not vortex or mix vigorously; this is to avoid bubbles appearing in the solution.\nOptional: Add the fluorescent labeled CNA35 at 2 μM in step 11 to label collagen fibers for visualization.\nFill 200–250 μL of collagen/acini solution from step 11 into the PDMS casting wells. Allow the collagen to solidify in the incubator at 37°C for 30 min.\nNote: Put the collagen solution with acini in the incubator immediately after filling the PDMS casting wells. Acini will sink to the bottom if the solution is kept at room temperature for too long before gelling.\nAliquot 3–5 mL of growth medium in a 6 well plate and keep in the incubator at 37°C to warm up.\nStretch the collagen gel\nTiming: 4.5 h\nRing shape collagen gels are stretched to align collagen fibrils.\nPut the PDMS casting wells with collagen gel in the medium aliquoted in step 13.",
    "Gently shake the PDMS casting wells in the medium with a tweezer and remove the collagen ring gel from the casting wells (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nCarefully insert the PDMS stretching poles inside the gel hole by using a tweezer (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nInsert the 10 μL pipet tip which is cut the tip between the stretcher pole to expand the gel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIncubate at 37°C for 4 h in the CO2 incubator.\nNote: All steps are done in suspended condition in growth medium.\nRe-embed the stretched collagen gel\nTiming: 1 h\nStretched ring shape collagen gels are re-embedded in the collagen gel.\nMake 1.5 mL/mL collagen mixture with growth medium and neutralize with 0.5 M NaOH and 0.2 M HEPES on ice.\nRemove the inserted pipet tips and stretcher from the ring gel.\ntransfer the stretched gel in a 8 well chamber slide. Remove extra medium as much as possible.\nAdd 200–250 μL of collagen mixture made in step 19.\nCritical: Make sure that the stretched gels are completely covered by the newly added collagen solution.\nCritical: Do not leave and float the stretched gel after removing the stretching poles. The aligned collagen fibrils would be reversed.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min in the CO2 incubator.\nAdd 500 μL of growth medium for each well.\nNote: Aligned collagen fibrils can be observed any time after step 24."
