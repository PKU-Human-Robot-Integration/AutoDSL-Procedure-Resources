    "1. Assemble nucleosome core particles via salt-gardient dialysis\nNOTE: The preparation of nucleosome core particles using recombinant histone proteins for structural studies has been extensively described in detail by others14,15,16. Follow the purification of recombinant X. laevis histones and histone octamer assembly described by others14,15, and assemble the nucleosomal substrate as described below.\nPurchase three oligonucleotides (listed in Table 1) at the indicated scale: UND-197mer, 161mer, 35mer.\n\t\nPAGE purify ultramers (197mer and 161mer) as described17.\n\t\t\nAnneal equimolar amounts of oligonucleotides in 1x annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl). For example, mix 40 µL of 161-mer [166.7 µM]; 8 µL of 35-mer [292.4 µM]; 16.8 µL of 197-mer comp strand [408.2 µM]; 10 µL of 10x anneal buffer and 10.9 µL of dH2O.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is critical to control the annealing reaction with a temperature gradient. See Table 2 for the details on the temperature gradient.\nPerform small-scale reconstitutions (scale by a factor of 1/57 of the example shown below for a final volume of 50 µL) to determine the ratio of DNA to histone octamer (typical starting ratios of DNA:octamer are as follows: 1:0.9, 1:1.1, 1:1.2, 1:2; shown in Figure 2A); it is critical to determine this ratio empirically with small-scale reconstitutions.\n\t\nAfter this ratio is determined, prepare a large-scale reconstitution. For example, mix 32.9 µL of DNA-197 bp [99.4 µM]; 1647.1 µL of TE (1x); 1120 µL of 5 M NaCl, and 62.3 µL of WT histone octamer [2.56 µM].\nMake dialysis buffers: RBlow and RBhigh as described in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively; set up the reconstitutions as previously described14.\n\t\nTransfer the dialysis tube into the beaker containing RBhigh, and allow for dialysis to proceed, with gentle stirring, for 16 h or until 2 L RBlow has been transferred into the waste beaker.",
    "Transfer the dialysis tube into a 1 L beaker containing RB50mM buffer (Table 5) and allow the sample to dialyze for at least 3 h or overnight.\n\t\nEvaluate reconstitution efficiency on a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel, ensuring there is less than 10% free DNA and a single NCP band; store NCPs at 4 °C. See Figure 2A (lane 5) and Figure 2B for representative optimal reconstitution results.\n2. Prepare NCP-DNA repair factor complex (NCP-DRF)\nPurification by preparative-gel electrophoresis\n\tNOTE: This method is the most labor-intensive (of the two described), and while it is effective at removing high molecular weight (HMW) species (Figure 6A) because of the high dilution factor, it can lead to some disassembly as shown in Figure 7A (NCP prep cell out lane), releasing DNA. However, up to 25% free DNA is still compatible with cryo-EM studies. Because of the high dilution, use this method to purify the NCP only, rather than the whole complex.\n\t\nPrepare 70 mL of 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel solution in 0.2x TBE, using polyacrylamide gel solution 37.5:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide. Pour a cylindrical gel with outer radius of 28 mm and polymerize overnight.\nAssemble the preparative gel running apparatus, using a dialysis membrane with a 6-8 kDa MW cutoff. Use 0.25x TBE as the running buffer and 1x elution buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5). Pre-run the cylindrical gel at a constant 12 W for 1 h, and collect fractions running the peristaltic pump at a flow rate of approximately 1 mL/min.\n\t\tNOTE: If a UV detector is not available to identify fractions containing DNA, a screening experiment with 32P-NCP can be performed to identify the fractions of interest. Keeping all conditions the same, unlabeled NCPs can then be purified without a UV detector.",
    "Concentrate the 2.8 mL of NCP to 250 µL using a centrifugal filter (MW cutoff 30 kDa), and load onto the preparative gel and electrophorese for a total of 6 h. At 2 h, when the xylene cyanol has ran out of the gel, start collecting 1.5 mL fractions.\n\t\tNOTE: At 2.5 h, fractions will be clear of xylene cyanol; the DNA (197mer) elutes at approximately 3-3.5 h, and the NCP is expected to elute at 4.5-5 h mark.\nAnalyze fractions of interest on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Pool fractions containing the NCP, and immediately concentrate with a centrifugal filter (MW cutoff 30 kDa) to 1 mg/mL. The next day, evaluate the quality of the NCP on a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel before complexing with the DNA repair factor (DRF) of interest.\nIncubate the NCP and the DRF of interest on ice for 15 min using an optimal buffer for the specific complex. For example, mix 1,000 µL of NCP [1.2 µM]; 260 µL of 5x binding buffer (250 mM HEPES, pH 8, 500 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl2), 22 µL of 3 M KCl, and 18 µL of MBP- Pol β-APE1 [338 µM].\n\t\tNOTE: The temperature and ionic strength at which the complex is made may need optimization for different complexes.\nAdd glutaraldehyde (freshly opened; EM grade) to a final concentration of 0.005%. Therefore, to this reaction, add 26.8 µL of 0.25% glutaraldehyde with 13.2 µL of dH2O. Mix well, and incubate at room temperature for 13 min.\nQuench with 1 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Concentrate to ~50 µL and exchange the buffer with 1x freezing buffer: 50 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 using a desalting column.",
    "CAUTION: Glutaraldehyde can cause severe skin burns and eye damage; it is harmful if swallowed, and it is toxic if inhaled. Wear a lab coat, goggles, gloves, and handle glutaraldehyde in a fume hood and wear a mask.\n\t\tNOTE: It is critical to perform the crosslinking reaction in a large volume with the NCP at this lower concentration. Previous attempts of crosslinking, even at this concentration of glutaraldehyde, but at a 10x higher concentrated NCP led to aggregation of the sample and over-crosslinking as indicated by SDS PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. These grids had no discernable particles with just clumps (Figure 5D,E).\nDetermine the absorbances at OD280 and OD260 and concentrate further if needed to reach 1.3-3 mg/mL, based on OD280 (typical ratio of OD260/ OD280= 1.7-2 yields good particles). For this small volume of 50 µL, the best method to reduce sample loss is to make a dialysis button with a lid of a 1.7 mL tube covered by a dialysis membrane (6-8 kDa MW cutoff), cutting the bottom of the tube and using the rim of the tube to seal the membrane on top of the lid.\nPlace the dialysis button containing the sample on top of a polyethylene glycol bed, with the membrane facing down (check progress every 2 min). This method is preferred where the concentration needed is less than or equal to 2.5-fold to avoid diluting or losing the sample in the concentrator. It is critical to immediately prepare cryo-EM grids of the complex after this step.\nPurification by size exclusion chromatography",
    "The day before freezing, wash and equilibrate a size exclusion column with 60 mL of dH2O, followed by 80 mL of freezing buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 8) overnight at a rate of 0.4 mL/min. Using NCPs straight after reconstitution, prepare the same complex using 2.5x greater amounts as follows: mix 2,500 µL of NCP [1.2 µM]; 650 µL of 5x binding buffer; 45 µL of MBP-Pol β-APE1 [338 µM] and 55 µL of 3M KCl.\nIncubate the mixture on ice without crosslinker for 15 min. Then, add glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.005% as described in the preparative gel method. In this case, however, concentrate the complex in a pre-equilibrated (with freezing buffer) centrifugal filter to approximately 120 µL.\nImmediately analyze the peak fractions and concentrate those fractions containing the histones and MBP-Pol β-APE1 as indicated previously. See Figure 5A,B,C for successful results using the size exclusion method and Figure 7 using both methods.\n3. Freeze nucleosomal complex\nAfter turning on the plunge freezer and filling the humidifier with 50 mL of dH2O, set the chamber temperature to 22 °C and HR (humidity) to 98%. Place the ethane cup and liquid nitrogen cup (containing a labeled grid box) in their respective space holders.\nCover the ethane cup with the ethane lid dispenser, and carefully pour liquid nitrogen (LN2) over it, while also filling the LN2 cup with LN2. When the LN2 level has stabilized and reaches 100% and a temperature of -180 °C, carefully open the ethane valve and fill the ethane cup until it forms a bubble on the clear lid. Remove the ethane dispenser.",
    "Place two filter papers onto the blotting device and secure them with a metal ring. Go to the set up and use the following parameters for blotting: 0 pre-blot, 3 s blot, 0 post-blot; select A-plunge and click on OK.\nOn the main screen, click on Load Forceps, and load them with a grid with the carbon/application side facing toward the left (prepared as before). Calibrate the forceps adjusting the Z-axis to ensure a solid blot. Click on Lower Chamber and apply 3 µL of the complex (1.3-3 mg/mL; OD280). Click on Blot/A-plunge. This will rotate the grid to blot from the front and will plunge freeze it.\nTransfer and store the grid in the grid box in the LN2 chamber. When all four grids have been frozen and placed in the grid box, rotate the lid to neutral position, where all the grids are covered by the lid, and tighten the screw. Grids can be stored in LN2 until screening is initiated.\n4. Screen grids\nBefore loading the samples in the microscope, place the vitrified grids on a ring and secure them using a C-clip. Perform this clipping process under LN2 in a humidity-controlled room, to avoid ice contamination.\nWhen loading the microscope, insert the grids in a 12-slot cassette. Shuttle the cassette into a nanocab capsule and load it into the autoloader. The autoloader robotic mechanism initiates the process.\nTransfer the grid from the cassette to the microscope stage. Adjust the stage to eucentric height by wobbling the stage 10° and simultaneously moving the Z-height until minimal planar shift is observed in the images.",
    "Once the eucentric height is reached, start imaging. First, obtain the atlas by taking a 3 x 3 montage image of the grid, in which each montage is taken at 62x magnification. Pick three squares of varying sizes; take the eucentric height, and then image at 210x magnification.\nOnce a square is imaged, pick one hole each from the edge, center, and in between within the squares. Image each hole at 2600x magnification.\nBefore taking this high magnification image, the autofocusing occurs at an offset of the imaging area. Take the high magnification image from the center of the hole at 36,000x magnification and at 7.1 s exposure time, 60 frames, 1.18-pixel size, and 3 µm defocus. See representative images of screening in Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
