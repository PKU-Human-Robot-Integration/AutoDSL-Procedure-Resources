    "MDA quantitationNotes:  a. Field samples should be spun down in a hematocrit centrifuge directly after collection in order to store the plasma separately. We recommend transferring the separated plasma to a 0.5 ml centrifuge tube for storage. See Langille et al., 2018 for more details on field sampling.  b. Store samples at -80 °C before analysis and test within one year of collection.  c. A single HPLC system and two workers can expect to process a calibration curve and about 20-30 plasma samples in one working day. Prepare the HPLC system using the parameters listed in Table 1. Table 1. HPLC system parameters to be used in MDA quantification methodimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190504/20190504231645_4021.jpgPrepare a 1.00 mM MDA working solution by adding 100 mM 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane stock solution to a 100 ml volumetric flask, diluting to the mark with ultrapure water. Mix well. Prepare an MDA calibration by serially diluting the freshly prepared 1.00 mM 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane working solution using micropipettes. Prepare fresh calibration curve before every batch of samples. See Table 2. Table 2. Preparation of serially diluted 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane standards for the MDA quantification methodimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190425/20190425223312_3451.jpgStore standards on ice until use. Thaw plasma samples on ice and spin for 1 min in a refrigerated centrifuge at 3,000 x g and 4 °C to collect the plasma at the bottom of the tube. Prepare standard 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes with labels for the samples and the standards. Note: We prefer to run all in triplicate, so we purchased a label printer which can make the repeated labeling of tubes much easier.  Transfer 20 µl of either standard or plasma sample to the labeled tubes. Add 2 µl butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) solution (see Recipes) and 5 µl of 2 N NaOH solution (see Recipes) to each tube.",
    "Briefly vortex tubes, and then transfer to the shaking dry block incubator set at 60 °C for 30 min and 400 rpm agitation. Once this is finished, remove tubes to the ice bucket, and add 100 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid solution to precipitate proteins. Briefly vortex the samples, then incubate in the ice bath for 5 min.Centrifuge the tubes for 10 min at 14,000 x g and 4 °C to pellet the protein.Carefully, without disturbing the protein pellet, transfer 100 μl of supernatant to a 500 μl screw cap microcentrifuge tube.To that tube, also add 50 μl of 2-thiobarbituric acid derivatizing solution (see Recipes). Ensure the caps on the tubes are well sealed and place in a dry block incubator at 100 °C for 60 min.Remove the tubes from the block into an ice bath, and when cooled, centrifuge for 5 min at 14,000 x g and 4 °C. Transfer 60 μl of the derivatized solution to the microinsert HPLC vial.Transfer 5 μl of the derivatized solution to the pooled QC vial, except for standards. Note: The QC is a pooled sample of all the plasma you will process in one day. Injecting this QC throughout the HPLC run process (every 8-10 samples) will allow you to observe if there are any issues with the runs or decomposition of your samples. Subject the vials to HPLC analysis in triplicate within 12 h of sample preparation. FRAP assay Notes:  a. Samples should be stored at -80 °C before analysis and thawed on ice. b. FRAP reagent is light sensitive, and unstable in ambient air. The reagent must be prepared directly before use. Prepare a working iron sulfate solution by diluting 1 ml of the 300 mM stock with 9 ml of distilled water in a 15 ml centrifuge tube.",
    "Use this 30 mM solution to prepare the calibration solutions in 15 ml centrifuge tubes (see Table 3).Table 3. Dilution table of iron sulfate standards for the FRAP assayimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190425/20190425223351_7495.jpgObtain a standard flat bottomed 96-well plate, and plan for where the position of the calibration curves and the samples will be positioned. We like to run 2 calibration curves per plate to account for errors. Pipette a 5 μl aliquot of either standard or sample into each well to be measured, followed by 5 μl of ultrapure water containing uricase (1.00 U/ml, see Recipes). Be sure that the two drops mix well. Incubate the solution for 5 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm.Add 200 μl of FRAP reagent (see Recipes) to each well using a multichannel pipette. Place the plate into the microplate reader and shake for 30 min on low speed, seen as “LO” on software. After 30 min, the absorbance at 595 nm is read vs. reagent blank. HASC assayNotes:  a. Samples should be stored at -80 °C before analysis and thawed on ice.  b. Oxidant solution is unstable in air and should be prepared with care. Adjustment of the pH should be carried out in a fume hood as small quantities of chlorine gas will be produced. Prepare the oxidant solution as in the Recipes section. Protect the solution from light by wrapping the bottle in aluminum foil, and work quickly with the solution. From the oxidant solution, prepare a calibration curve of HClO by diluting the 1x to 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x and 32x dilutions. Prepare 1 ml of each solution. To a standard 96-well flat bottom microplate, add 1 μl plasma or standard and 100 μl ultrapure water.",
    "Note: We prefer to run at least two calibration curves per plate to account for any error which may occur.  Vortex the plate on a 2D shaker at 400 rpm for 30 s. Using a multichannel pipette, add 100 μl of oxidant solution to sample wells only. Note: Do not add oxidant solution to the standard wells. The standard is directly read as a serial dilution of HClO. Instead, add 100 μl ultrapure water. Shake the plate on an orbital shaker for 10 min at room temperature and 100 rpm. Add 20 μl of NPD solution (see Recipes) to each well of the plate. Incubate the plate on an orbital shaker for 1 min at room temperature and 100 rpm.Read the absorbance of the wells at 515 nm."
