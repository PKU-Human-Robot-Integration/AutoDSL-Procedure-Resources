    "1. Preparation steps for the peel-blot technique\nNOTE: Preparation requires for the following items to be placed adjacent to each other.\nStack two pieces of 20-25 µm pore size filter paper (see Table of Materials).\nPlace an ~8 cm x 10 cm long paraffin film adjacent to the filter paper with the paper facing up.\nPlace a piece of submicron filter paper on top of two additional pieces of #4 filter paper (Figure 1-1).\nPosition the anti-capillary forceps with the bent leg facing up and the straight leg facing down. Then, select a 600-mesh grid with the smooth/shiny side up. Place the forceps on a Petri dish or other raised surface to avoid contact of the clean grid with other items.\nRemove the paper from the paraffin film and pull the sides (~5 mm) to create a small rim. Pipette two 150 µL drops of 4% trehalose solution ~1-2 cm from one short side of the paraffin film and ~1 cm apart on the paraffin film.\nOn a separate bench or on the floor, pour liquid nitrogen in a small polystyrene foam container (see Table of Materials).\n\tCAUTION: Receive training for proper handling using gloves and a face shield in order to avoid frost bite.\nPlace a small cryo-EM grid container in the liquid nitrogen and cover the polystyrene foam container with lint-free wipes.\n2. Placing the carbon film onto the grid\nUse Dumont #5 forceps (see Table of Materials) to float of the carbon film from the mica by touching one side of the mica at a slight angle downwards (~20°-40°) on one of the drops of trehalose solution and slowly let the water tension lift off the carbon film by moving the mica downwards. Release the mica once the carbon film floats on the surface of the droplet.",
    "Visually inspect the carbon film to avoid using carbon with damage in the form of fractures.\nInsert the grid held by the anti-capillary forceps at an angle (~20°-30°) into a trehalose drop at a position adjacent to, and then centered under the carbon film. Pick up the carbon film (Figure 1-2).\nKeep the grid in the same orientation and slowly lower it onto the surface of the second drop of trehalose without breaking the surface tension of the drop to remove unnecessary carbon film that may have wrapped around the rim of the grid to the rough side.\n3. Separation of multi-layered 2D crystals into single layers\nRotate the anti-capillary forceps (see Table of Materials) and place them on a Petri dish with the carbon side of the grid facing down (Figure 1-3).\nPipette 1.3 µL of the sample into the slight trehalose meniscus on top of the grid. Pipette the solution ~8-10 times to mix and distribute the trehalose and sample on both sides of the grid.\nWhile incubating the solution for 1 min, pipette one or more 1.7 µL drops of trehalose solution onto the paraffin film.\nRotate the grid back into its original position with the carbon film facing up.\nUse the anti-capillary forceps to press the grid onto the submicron filter paper (Figure 1-4). Once the solution has been absorbed by the filter paper and the carbon film is lying flat, wait for 3s before lifting the grid and moving it vertically onto the 1.7 µL drop of trehalose solution (Figure 1-5).\n\tNOTE: Repeat this step multiple times for highly stacked samples, or the grid is prepared for vitrification in the next steps.",
    "Blot the grid on the two pieces of filter paper, and then lift the grid from the filter paper (Figure 1-6). After approximately 13 s, depending on humidity and sample buffer, plunge the grid into the liquid nitrogen in the small Styrofoam container and place the grid in the cryo-EM grid container or transfer it directly for cryo-EM screening or data collection.\n\tNOTE: In order to rapidly optimize the protocol, negatively stain the peel-blotted grid at this step rather than plunging it into liquid nitrogen. Negatively stain the sample by applying 3 µL of 1% uranyl acetate to the grid, incubate the grid for 30 s, and blot it with a torn piece of 20-25 µm pore size filter paper. Grids of 2D crystals vitrified in trehalose, tannin, or glucose are routinely hand-plunged for vitrification as trehalose, tannin, and glucose prevent the formation of crystalline ice at rates used for hand-plunging2.\nSubscription Required.
