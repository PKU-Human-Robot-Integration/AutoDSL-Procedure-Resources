  "procedures": [
    "1. Cultivation of A. nidulans\nInoculum preparation\n\tNOTE: All steps apart from the incubation should be performed under a laminar flow cabinet.\n\t\nStreak out TAP strain (e.g. TIB32.12) from the glycerol stock (-80 °C) onto glucose/xylose minimal medium (GXMM; per liter: 10.0 g of glucose, 0.5 g of xylose, 10 mL of 1 M di-ammonium tartrate solution, 20 mL of 50 × salt solution [per liter: 26.0 g KCl, 26.0 g MgSO4 · 7 H2O, 76.0 g KH2PO4, 1 mL of chloroform], 1 mL of 1,000 × Hutner’s trace elements8) including 1.5% (w/v) agar and the required supplements as described by Todd et al. 20079. Incubate for 2–3 days at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: TIB32.1 contains an rpdA::TAP fusion controlled by a xylose-inducible promoter, xylP(p)10. This is why xylose is included in the above recipe. Omit xylose when growing strains expressing constructs that are not under xylP(p) control.\nPrepare a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube with 1.5 mL of sterile conidial suspension solution (CSS; 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) polysorbate 80).\nWet a disposable inoculation loop in CSS, scrape off conidia from the plate from step 1.1.1 and suspend in the tube from step 1.1.2.\nTransfer 150 µL each of conidial suspension to ten 25 cm2 cell culture flasks with vent cap containing GXMM agar including supplements and 200 µL of CSS.\nSpread the conidial suspension within the flasks using a sterile inoculation loop and incubate the flasks at 37 °C for 2–3 days.\nTo harvest the conidia, use 10 mL of CSS per flask. Pour the solution into a flask, tightly close the flask with the provided screw cap and vigorously shake the flask.\nAfter wetting the fungal surface, completely scrape off remaining conidia with a sterile inoculation loop.",
    "Pass conidia through 40 µm cell strainers placed onto a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube and collect the suspension of five flasks in one tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1,000 × g for 10 min.\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of CSS per tube.\nCollect both suspensions in one tube, rinse the empty tube with 40 mL of CSS, add to the suspension, and centrifuge as described in step 1.1.9.\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend the conidial pellet in 4 mL of CSS.\nPrepare two serial 1:50 dilutions of the conidial suspension and determine the number of conidia in the resulting 1:2,500-diluted suspension with a counting chamber as described11.\nGrowth and harvesting of mycelia\n\t\nWhile working under a laminar flow cabinet, inoculate 4–6 one-liter conical flasks each containing 250 mL of GXMM including appropriate supplements at a density of 5 × 106 conidia/mL and incubate at 180 rpm at 37 °C for 14–16 h.\nPlace cheese cloth into a funnel on top of a flask and filter the mycelia through the cloth. Wash briefly with deionized water.\nRemove as much moisture as possible by squeezing the mycelia trapped in the cheese cloth between first the hands and then paper towels.\nTransfer the dried mycelia as flat sheets to a plastic beaker with a screw lid and flash freeze with liquid nitrogen. This ensures a high area/volume ratio for the following lyophilization process.\nStore the frozen mycelia at -80 °C prior to lyophilization.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\nLyophilize the mycelia overnight.\nStop the freeze-drying process when the temperature of mycelia remains constant (18–24 h). Remove the beakers and immediately seal with the provided screw caps.\n\t\tNOTE: When tightly sealed, lyophilized mycelia can be stored for several weeks at RT.",
    "2. Single-step enrichment of TAP-tagged HDAC (adapted from Bayram et al. 2012)12\nPreparation of buffers and solutions\n\tNOTE: Add 2-mercaptoethanol (EtSH) and protease inhibitors to buffers directly prior to use. Filter all buffers used for chromatography through 0.22 µm nitrocellulose membranes to avoid introduction of impurities/contaminations to the chromatography resin. Instructions in the steps below refer to the preparation of 1 L of each buffer. Store buffers at 4 °C.\n\t\nExtraction buffer (B250): 250 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (RT), 0.1% (v/v) TX-100, 5 mM EtSH.\n\t\t\nDissolve 12.35 g of Tris-HCl, 2.62 g of Tris (free base), and 13.2 g of NaCl in 800 mL of deionized water and add 10 mL of a 10% (v/v) TX-100 solution.\nCheck pH at RT and adjust to pH 7.5 with either NaOH or HCl [5 M], if necessary.\nMake up to 1 L and filter through a 0.22 µm nitrocellulose membrane.\nAdd 35 µL of EtSH per 100 mL of buffer (5 mM final concentration) directly prior to use.\nWashing buffer 250 (WB250): 250 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (RT), 0.1% (v/v) TX-100, 5 mM EtSH.\n\t\t\nPrepare WB250 as described for B250 (2.1.1) but with 3.59 g of Tris-HCl, and 2.08 g of Tris (free base).\nWashing buffer 150 (WB150): 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (RT), 0.1% (v/v) TX-100, 5 mM EtSH.\n\t\t\nPrepare WB150 as described for B250 (2.1.1) but with 3.59 g of Tris-HCl, 2.08 g of Tris (free base), and 8.77 g of NaCl.\nTEV equilibration buffer (TEB): 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (RT), 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) TX-100, 5 mM EtSH.\n\t\t\nSame as WB150 but add EDTA to 0.5 mM final concentration.",
    "TEV cleavage buffer (TCB): 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (RT), 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) TX-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM EtSH.\n\t\t\nPrepare as described in step 2.1.1 with 3.59 g of Tris-HCl, 2.08 g of Tris (free base), and 8.77 g of NaCl and add 100 mL of glycerol before adjusting the volume to 1 L.\n50 × protease inhibitor cocktail: Dissolve 1 tablet of a commercially available cocktail of protease inhibitors in 1 mL of water and store at -20 °C.\nTBS-T: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 (RT), 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) polysorbate 20.\n\t\t\nPrepare as described in step 2.1.1. Use 6.06 g of Tris-HCl, 1.40 g of Tris (free base), 9 g of NaCl, and 1 mL of polysorbate 20.\n5 × LSB (Laemmli sample buffer): 315 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8 (RT), 25% (v/v) EtSH, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) SDS, 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue.\nPreparation of protein extract\n\t\nAdd 1.5 g of lyophilized mycelia and a grinding ball into the grinding jar of a ball mill.\n\t\tNOTE: Fresh mycelia might be used as well. When doing so, dry the mycelia as thoroughly as possible before freezing and make sure to precool the grinding jars in liquid nitrogen for grinding fresh mycelia.\nGrind mycelia to powder at 25 Hz for 30 s.\n\t\tNOTE: In cases where no grinding machine is available, grind mycelia to a powder using a mortar and pestle, as described by Bayram et al.12.\nTransfer mycelial powder to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nTilt the centrifuge tube including ground mycelia to allow subsequent mixing of mycelia with buffer.",
    "Add 6 mL of ice-cold B250 including 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail per gram of mycelial powder and blend with a small spatula until complete homogenization of the crude extract is achieved. When using fresh mycelia, refer to Bayram et al.12 to achieve the right biomass to extraction buffer ratio.\nKeep the tube on ice for 5 min.\nPlace the tube and a balance tube into a centrifuge and spin at 40,000 × g for ≥20 min at 4 °C. Perform equilibration of IgG resin (step 2.3) during the centrifugation.\nAfter centrifugation, remove 10 µL of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis. Place the sample into a 1.5 mL tube containing 40 µL of water and 12.5 µL of 5 × LSB; referred to as “Ex” in Figure 1.\nCarefully remove the supernatant (cleared lysate) using a serological pipette and transfer onto the column containing the equilibrated IgG beads (step2.3) and tightly close using the provided end cap.\nEquilibration of IgG resin (performed during step 2.2.7)\n\t\nPrepare a 10 mL disposable chromatography column and pipet 300 µL of well-resuspended IgG resin (50% slurry) into the column. Fill up the column to 10 mL with B250 and let the buffer flow through by gravity.\nAdd 1 mL of B250 including 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail and let flow through. Plug the bottom of the column.\nBatch purification of TAP-tagged HDAC\n\t\nIncubate the chromatography column containing the equilibrated beads and the cleared lysate from step 2.2.9 on a rotary mixer at 10 rpm at 4 °C for 2–4 h.\nAfter the batch binding, remove the cap and open the column at the bottom to collect the flow-through.\nTake a sample for SDS-PAGE analysis as described in step 2.2.8; referred to as “FT” in Figure 1.",
    "Wash beads with 10 mL of WB250. First, use 1 mL of buffer to remove trapped beads from the column cap using a pipettor and transfer this suspension in one flush onto the settled resin to allow resuspension of the beads. Then fill up the column to the top, close using a stack cap and connect to a peristaltic pump. Adjust a flow rate of approx. 1–5 mL/min. Prevent the resin from running dry.\nRepeat step 2.4.4 three times for a total of four washes with WB250.\nWash beads three times with 10 mL of TEB as described in step 2.4.4.\nClose the chromatography column at the bottom, resuspend IgG beads in 1 mL of TCB, and add 20 µL of 50 × protease inhibitor cocktail as well as 10 µL of TEV (~1 mg/mL stock, S219V mutant variant produced in-house).\nCap the column and incubate on a rotary mixer at 10 rpm at 4 °C overnight to elute the protein complexes bound via the tagged HDAC.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively perform TEV digest at elevated temperature (16–25 °C), which reduces the reaction time, however, is raising the risk of protein degradation.\nOn the next day open the column and collect the eluate in a 2 mL centrifuge tube. Use 0.7 mL of TCB to remove beads from the cap and rinse the wall of the column.\nPlace the column onto the open 2 mL tube from the previous step which itself is placed within a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nTransfer this assembly into a table top centrifuge and spin at 300 × g for 2 min. This is the TEV eluate.",
    "NOTE: When performing tandem affinity purification, use the TEV eluate as input for the calmodulin affinity step. You also may split the TEV eluate and use one part for HDAC activity determination and the second part to complete the TAP purification.\nRemove 50 µL from the TEV eluate and add 12.5 µL of 5 × LSB for SDS-PAGE (referred to as “TE” in Figures 1 and 2) and keep the remaining eluate on ice.\nTo assess the efficacy of protease elution, add 2 mL of 5% (v/v) acetic acid and incubate at RT for 5 min. Again, use the first mL to resuspend the resin.\nCollect the acid eluate and again take 50 µL sample and add 12.5 µL of 5 × LSB (referred to as “AE” in Figure 1). LSB will turn yellow when added to the acidic solution. To neutralize the acid, add 10 M NaOH in steps of 1 µL and mix well until the color changes to blue again.\nRe-equilibrate the IgG resin with TBS-T to neutralize the acid. Store the resin in TBS-T/20% (v/v) ethanol at 4 °C for reuse with the same tagged protein.\nStorage of elution fractions\n\t\nAliquot the eluate into ~100 µL fractions, to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nFreeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen and keep at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples stored this way will be stable for months without losing enzymatic activity.\n3. Analysis of purification by SDS-PAGE and western blotting",
    "Use standard protocols for casting SDS-polyacrylamide gels or use precast gels13. Denature gel samples from the previous section at 95 °C for 5 min, centrifuge at ≥15,000 × g for 5 min, and load onto 12% gels. Recommended loading volumes are given in the legend of Figure 1. Electrophorese the samples in 1 × Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE running buffer at 180 V constant for 60–70 min, until the bromophenol blue marker of the SDS-PAGE loading buffer starts to migrate out of the gel.\nUse standard protocols for silver staining of the gels. For example, use the protocol of Blum et al. 198714 that is also compatible with MS analysis.\nUse standard protocols for western blotting15. For the generation of representative results below, a commercially available blotting system was used.\nProbe blots with commercially available anti-calmodulin binding protein (anti-CBP) antibody in 5% (w/v) milk powder in TBS-T at 4 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Anti-CBP antibody is directed against the part of the TAP tag still present after TEV cleavage.\nUse standard protocols for detection and development of blots. For example, anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and a BCIP/NBT color development substrate were used for the generation of representative results below.\n4. Deacetylase assay using in vitro [3H] acetate-labeled chicken reticulocyte histones (adapted from Trojer et al. 2003)4\nRefer to the protocol of Kölle et al. 199816 for the preparation of [3H] acetate-labeled chicken reticulocyte histones.\nPer assay condition place three 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes on ice for measurements in triplicates. Also prepare three tubes for buffer-only background control.\nPut 25 µL of WB150 into each tube and add 25 µL of the TEV eluate from step 2.4.11 and keep on ice.\nPreheat a tube incubator to 25 °C.",
    "Use 15 s intervals (stop watch) for the addition of 10 µL of labeled histones [1.5 mg/mL] to each tube.\nBefore starting the assay, take up 10 µL of the [3H] acetate-labeled chicken histones and start the stop watch.\nFive seconds after the start, add the labeled histones, close the tube tightly, vortex, and put it into the incubator.\nUse 15 s intervals for the addition of 10 µL of labeled histones and proceed as described in the previous step.\nAfter 60 min incubation add 50 µL of stop solution (1 M HCl/0.4 M acetic acid) to each tube in 15 s intervals; vortex immediately. After the addition of the acidic solution, the assay mix is stable and can be kept at RT until the next step.\nAdd 800 µL of ethyl acetate to each tube to extract the released [3H] acetic acid.\nTightly close the tubes and vortex each tube for 5 s.\nPlace the tube into a microcentrifuge and spin at 10,000 × g for 10 min at RT.\nIn the meantime, prepare one scintillation vial per assay sample and add 3 mL of scintillation cocktail for hydrophobic samples.\nAfter centrifugation (step 2.12), carefully transfer 600 µL of the upper organic phase to the prepared scintillation tubes and close the tubes tightly.\nMeasure the radioactivity corresponding to the HDAC activity in a liquid scintillation counter."
