    "The University's ethics committee approved procedures, and the participant signed an informed consent form before participating.\n1. Participant\nNOTE: One Transtibial (TTA) amputee attending a local amputee rehabilitation center was invited and agreed to participate in the study. The participant was able to walk independently. Exclusion criteria were clinical conditions other than their amputation that could affect balance and mobility (e.g., neurological, orthopedic, or rheumatic disorders); ongoing pain, phantom pain, or pressure sores on the prosthetic limb, and difficulties understanding simple commands (i.e., less than 24 points in the Mini-Mental State Examination29). In addition, the participant had over six years of experience with the current prosthesis.\nProsthetic details\n\t\nRequest the prosthetic details from the TTA. Note the experience of the TTA with the prosthesis. Ensure that the participant has a high ability to walk using the prosthesis.\n\t\t​NOTE: The TTA used a prosthesis, a silicone suction socket (silicon liner with five sealing rings), and a carbon fiber foot (Table of Materials). Experience with the current prosthesis was six years. The amputation was due to trauma, and the participant was classified as level K4 according to the Medicare Functional Classification30. According to the standardized functional classification, the participant had a high ability to walk using the prosthesis and was considered a young active adult31.\n2. Experimental procedures\nDesign a system to induce trips.\n\t\nConstruct a custom-made device in which a spring is electronically released to raise a polypropylene wire (diameter of 4 mm and negligible mass) that catches the trailing limb (sound or prosthetic limb) during the mid-swing phase.",
    "Connect the system to a wooden box that allows a lever (approximately 10 cm) to be rotated upwards around a fixed axis. Connect the polypropylene wire to the end of the lever (away from the axis). Install a spring that pulls on the lever to raise the polypropylene wire about 10 cm from the ground.\n\t\tNOTE: Video 1 shows the trigger system and how the wire was positioned to cause the trip (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2).\nSafety harness system\n\tNOTE: Inducing a trip while a participant is walking requires safety measures to be adopted.\n\t\nEnsure the participant wears a full-body harness attached via a polyester rope to an overhead rail.\nAdjust the length of the safety rope according to the participant's stature.\n\t\tNOTE: The safety rope (diameter of 11 mm) is attached to a specially designed four-wheeled device that sits inside the overhead rail (about 2 m above the participant's head). Adjusting the safety rope to the participant's stature prevents any part of their body (apart from their feet) from touching the floor should they fail to restore balance after the trip disturbance.In addition, the length of the overhead rail (8 m) is sufficient to ensure the participants' walking is unencumbered (see Supplementary Figure 3).\nExperimental procedures\n\t\nAccording to the following standardized instruction, ask the participant to walk across the laboratory at their usual speed and looking forward as the participant normally would: \"You should walk to the end of the walkway using your own pace as if you were walking on a familiar, flat street and look forward as you normally would\".",
    "Adjust the participant's starting point to ensure that the contralateral (non-tripped) limb is positioned on the ground slightly ahead of the polypropylene wire, placed approximately 4 m from the starting position. Therefore, the participant could take 4-5 steps at the usual speed before applying the trip disturbance.\n\t\t\nThe participant is required to complete two blocks of walking. Let the participant perform up to 15 walks in each block with the stumble/trip disturbance applied between the 5th and 15th repetition (randomly determined).\nAfter the trip disturbance, do not let the participant make any further repetitions.\nRepeat the same procedures in the second block, which is used to trip the opposite limb to the one tripped in the first block.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The order in which the limbs are obstructed is randomly assigned.\nPrior to starting the walking tests, inform the participant that some disturbance could occur, but do not provide any specific information regarding the possibility of tripping. Instead, inform the participant about the possibility of losing balance at some point.\nInstruct the participant to recover as best as possible if any disturbance of balance is applied and, if possible, to continue walking to the end of the walkway.\nTrigger the system only when the foot of the contralateral (non-tripped) limb is correctly positioned on the ground (i.e., slightly ahead of the wire). Do not activate the system if the participant steps before, on the wire, or if the foot is too far ahead of the wire. These procedures allow the trip disturbance to be applied consistently during the mid-swing phase, reducing the chances of mistrials.\nEvaluating whether the system can inducemeaningful recovery responses.",
    "​NOTE: The study aimed to develop an experimental approach to cause unexpected trip disturbances in lower-limb amputees. Although the approach causes unexpected trips, the use of dummy wires and the laboratory environment does not allow one to assume that all trips will be totally unexpected. 3D kinematic data from one TTA was collected and analyzed to establish if the protocol could create unexpected trips and hence induce meaningful tripping/recovery responses.\n\t\nData acquisition\n\t\t\nPosition two smartphones 5 m ahead of where the trip occurs are used to record each walking trial. Set the smartphones facing the walking progression line at an angle of approximately 30o.\nSynchronize both smartphones, sampling at 60 Hz, using the OneCap software. The OneCap software synchronizes the phones by providing a code that is read by the smartphones. Then, the images are automatically stored on the computer and transferred to be remotely processed. The transfer and successful reconstruction are indicated by the software.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This software automatically recognizes and tracks the limb segments without physical markers and pose detection algorithms transform images to estimate joint centers and provide a relatively accurate kinematic analysis. After being processed, the files can be analyzed using the OpenSim software.\nThen, process and transfer the images to the OpenSim software (version 4.4) to perform all kinematic analyses.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A markless system is advantageous, as pilot testing showed that the trip-wire dislodges some physical markers (especially those placed on the foot). A discussion regarding the relative merits of the capture and data processing is beyond the scope of the present protocol. The reader should refer to the work by Uhlrich and colleagues32 for further information.\nData processing and analysis",
