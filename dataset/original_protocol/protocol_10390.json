    "MicroRNA Isolation from Plasma or Serum\nNote: Plasma and serum preparation is a relevant step in circulating miRNA quantification. There is no preferred procedure for plasma and serum preparation. The only important thing to consider is that all the samples from the same experiment must be processed using exactly the same workflow. Start from 200 µl serum or plasma. Total RNA can be isolated from serum or plasma using commercially available kits.\n1. Protocol for Total RNA (including miRNA) Isolation\nThaw serum/plasma samples on ice.\nAdd 1 ml of Lysis Reagent (e.g., QIAzol) to 200 µl serum/plasma.\nMix by vortexing and place the tube containing the homogenate on the bench at RT for 5 min.\nAdd 3 µl of a 4.16 nM solution of the synthetic miRNA cel-miR-39-3p from C. elegans.\nAdd 200 µl of chloroform. Shake the tube vigorously for 15 sec. Place the tube on the bench at RT for 2 min.\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C to obtain phases separation: the upper aqueous phase contains RNA.\nTransfer the aqueous phase to a new tube, about 700 µl, avoid transfer of any white interphase material.\nAdd 1 ml of 100% ethanol and mix by inversion.\nPipet up 700 µl of the sample into a mini spin column placed on a 2 ml collection tube. Close the lid and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 sec. Discard the flow-through.\nRepeat this step using the remaining sample.\nAdd 700 µl Buffer RWT to the mini spin column, close the lid and centrifuge for 15 sec at 12,000 x g to wash the column. Discard the flow-through.",
    "Pipet 500 µl Buffer RPE into the mini spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge for 15 sec at 12,000 rpm. Discard the flow-through. Repeat this step again.\nCentrifuge the mini spin column at full speed for 2 min to dry the spin column membrane from residual ethanol.\nTransfer the mini spin column to a new 1.5 ml collection tube and pipet 35 µl RNase-free water on the membrane of the column.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 x g to elute the RNA.\nStore the RNA at -80 °C.\n\tNote: Since RNA concentration cannot be determined accurately, use fixed volumes as a measure for input amount.\n2. MicroRNA Reverse Transcription\nThaw the reverse transcription (RT) reagent mix components: 5x reaction buffer, nuclease-free water. Mix gently inverting the tubes and place on ice. Immediately before use, remove the enzyme mix from the freezer and place on ice. Spin down all reagents.\nPrepare the RT reagent mix on ice as described in Table 1. Prepare at least 10% exceeding mix.\nMix the reaction by pipetting, and then spin down.\nIncubate for 60 min at 42 ˚C.\nHeat-inactivate the reverse transcriptase for 5 min at 95 ˚C.\nImmediately cool to 4 °C.\nStore the cDNA at -20 °C.\n3. cDNA Dilution\nDilute the amount of cDNA template needed for the planned ddPCR reactions in nuclease free water. Dilute the cDNA reaction between 1:50 and 1:500 in water, dependent on target miRNA abundance. Store the diluted cDNA at -20 °C. The diluted cDNA proved to be stable for at least 3 months at -20 °C.\n4. Droplet Generation and PCR",
    "Note: Droplet generation should be performed on 8 samples at a time. Technical replicates are not required, due to the high reproducibility of this technology 12,15.A No Template Control (NTC) sample should be run in every plate and for each different ddPCR condition.\nThaw and equilibrate the master mix (e.g., EvaGreen Master Mix), microRNA primer set and cDNA at RT.\nMix the Master Mix thoroughly by inverting the tube several times. Spin down all the reagents.\nPrepare the ddPCR mix as described in Table 2. When multiple ddPCR reactions are performed, prepare a ddPCR mix working-solution. Prepare at least 10% exceeding mix.\nOnce assembled, thoroughly mix and spin down the ddPCR mix.\nDispense 12 µl of ddPCR mix into a 96-well PCR plate or PCR tubes.\nAdd 8 µl of diluted cDNA template to each tube/well.\nInsert the droplet generator cartridge into the holder.\nTransfer 20 µl of each prepared sample to the sample wells (middle row) of the droplet generator cartridge carefully while avoiding air bubbles at the bottom of the well.\nFill each oil well (bottom row) with 70 µl of droplet generator oil.\nHook the gasket over the cartridge holder and insert into the droplet generator.\nClose the lid to start droplet generation according to manufacturer's protocol. When droplet generation has finished, open the lid, remove the disposable gasket. The top wells of the cartridge contain the droplets.\nPipet slowly and smoothly 40 µl of the contents of the eight top wells (the droplets) into a single column of a 96-well PCR plate.\nSeal the PCR plate with foil immediately after transferring droplets to avoid evaporation. Use pierceable foil plate seals that are compatible with the needles in the droplet reader.\nBegin thermal cycling (PCR) within 30 min of sealing the plate.",
    "Perform the cycling protocol according to Table 3.\n5. Droplet Reading\nPower on the droplet reader.\nMove the plate from the thermal cycler to the droplet reader.\nPlace the 96-well PCR plate containing the post-PCR droplets into the base of the plate holder.\nPlace the top of the plate holder on the PCR plate. Firmly press both release tabs down to secure the PCR plate in the holder.\nStart the software from the system PC.\n\t\nClick Setup to define the experiment (Absolute quantification) then click Run to start the droplet reading.\nWhen droplet reading is complete, click \"Analyze\" button to open and analyze the data.\nUse the 2D amplitude plot in the analysis software to select the positive droplets (lasso tool) (Figure 1B).\nUse the Events tab to check the number of positive and total droplets. A total number of 18,000 - 21,000 droplets is usually achieved with probeless ddPCR.\nOnce the positive droplets are selected, export the miRNA concentration values using the export .csv option from the Concentration tab.\nSubscription Required.
