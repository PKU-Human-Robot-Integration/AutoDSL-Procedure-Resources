    "This protocol follows the guidelines of institutional human research ethics committee.\n1. Pre-insertion preparation\nNOTE: The IABP is preferably inserted in the cardiac catheterization lab under fluoroscopic guidance. Bedside placement can be considered in very critical clinical situations.\nBegin by preparing the catheterization laboratory for the procedure. Prepare sterile drapes and chlorhexidine or povidone iodine, IABP control unit, IABP catheter, ultrasound for arterial access, 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia, micropuncture needle and wire, micropuncture sheath, 7-8.5 F arterial access sheath for the IABP depending on the balloon size or IABP manufacturer, sutures and sterile dressing.\nPrepare and drape the patient in the usual sterile fashion with a plan to access the femoral artery.\n\t​NOTE: IABP can also be inserted through the axillary artery but this often requires a surgical cut down.\nHave the patient lay down flat on his or her back. Administer moderate conscious sedation if the clinical scenario permits, by infiltrating the groin access site liberally with 1% Lidocaine.\nPrepare the IABP catheter. Use a 50 mL syringe to apply a vacuum and completely deflate the balloon, using the one-way valve at the catheter hub.\nRemove the stylet in the catheter and manually flush the inner lumen with 3-5 mL of saline.\n2. Insertion of the IABP\nObtain arterial access using the Seldinger technique18. Use ultrasound guided vascular access to improve first pass success and minimize vascular complications.\nInsert a micropuncture needle at a 45˚ angle and insert the introducer wire once blood return is obtained.\nInsert the micropuncture sheath.\nExchange the micropuncture sheath for a larger IABP sheath. The sheath size varies by manufacturers and balloon size but is usually 7-8.5 F.",
    "NOTE: There are two methods to introduce and advance the IABP catheter. The catheter can either be backloaded with a wire or can be advanced over a wire.\nAdvance the IABP catheter through the sheath using short strokes until correct placement is achieved. The optimal balloon position is where the tip is situated distal to the left subclavian artery take off. This is often not easy to identify, and hence, use the carina of the trachea as a landmark, ensuring that the proximal end is above the renal arteries.\nConfirm position by fluoroscopy. Secure the catheter in place either by using sutures or manufacturer provided locking plates and apply sterile dressing.\n\t​CAUTION: Incorrect balloon position results in reduced diastolic augmentation or vascular complications due to direct endovascular injury.\n3. Switching on and setting up the IABP\nRemove the guidewire and aspirate 3 mL of blood from the inner lumen. Flush the inner lumen with 3-5 mL of saline.\nAttach a standard arterial pressure monitoring tubing to the catheter hub. Remove the one-way valve from the catheter and attach the catheter hub to the console using the provided extension catheter.\nTurn IABP On, then open the gas tank. Connect the ECG cable to the console. Connect the fiber optic or pressure cable to the console (depending on the manufacturer).\nPress the Start key on the console. This automatically purges and fills the balloon, calibrates, selects an appropriate ECG lead and trigger, and automatically sets the inflation and deflation timing.\n\t\nSelect an appropriate operation mode - Automatic, Semi-automatic or Manual depending on the clinical scenario.",
    "Select a trigger source. The IABP uses a trigger to identify the beginning of the next cardiac cycle. It deflates the balloon when it recognizes a trigger event. Trigger can be either ECG (R wave) or pressure (systolic upstroke).\nObserve the pressure changes on the IABP console by setting a 1:2 frequency. Confirm that the assisted systolic pressure is lower than unassisted one, there is decrease in assisted end-diastolic pressure and that diastolic augmentation is above the systolic pressure - all of which is associated with optimal IABP support (Figure 1).\nSet appropriate IABP frequency which can be 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3. This represents the frequency of balloon inflation with each trigger.\nConfirm that the IABP timing is appropriate.\n\t\tNOTE: An ideal IABP timing consists of the following: a) Inflation occurring at the dicrotic notch which appears as a sharp \"V\". Ideally, the diastolic augmentation rises above systole, and b) Deflation occurring just prior to the next systole (Figure 1).\nUse a continuous flush through the inner lumen (usually 3 mL/h).\n\tNOTE: The patient and the IABP console are now ready to be transported.\nUse systemic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of arterial thromboembolism.\n\t​NOTE: This is institution dependent and some centers do not use systemic anticoagulation for an IABP frequency of 1:119.\n4. Assessment of the patient after placement of IABP\nCheck distal pulses. If the left radial pulse is weak, verify the position of the balloon to make sure that it is not occluding the left subclavian artery. If no distal pulses are detected in the lower limb, consider removing the IABP and possibly alternate access.\nCheck the insertion site for any bleeding or hematoma.",
    "Monitor urine output. If there is a drop in urine output or if there is a concern for hematuria, recheck balloon position to confirm that the balloon lies above the level of the renal arteries.\nIf there is blood in the IABP tubing, suspect balloon rupture. Immediately stop the IABP (this is usually done automatically) and remove the catheter.\nObtain a chest X-ray daily to verify optimal device positioning. Also change the sterile dressing daily to reduce the chances of infection.\n5. Removal of IABP\nStop systemic anticoagulation and set IABP to 1:1.\nPalpate the femoral pulse and check the baseline distal perfusion by obtaining a Doppler of the pedal pulse.\nCheck the activated clotting time. It should ideally be less than 150-160 seconds.\nRemove sutures.\nOnce ready to pull, press the Stop button on the IABP console screen.\nPull the IABP until resistance is met against the sheath.\nPull the sheath and IABP as a unit.\nHold manual pressure over the femoral artery for 20-30 minutes or until bleeding stops.\nReassess distal pulses with Doppler.\n\tNOTE: Manual pressure has been mentioned here in the protocol because it is universal. However, there are numerous other methods apart from manual pressure to help achieve femoral arterial hemostasis. These are institution dependent and include but are not limited to: external compression devices like FemoStop, vascular closure devices like Angioseal and Perclose ProGlide Suture-Mediated Closure System. The above-mentioned protocol was partly developed by using official device information guides and manuals across various manufactures of IABP.\nSubscription Required.
