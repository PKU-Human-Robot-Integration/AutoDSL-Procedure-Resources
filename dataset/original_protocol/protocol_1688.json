    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSodium depletion\nTiming: 24 h\nThis step will use furosemide to induce diuresis. Mice are then allowed to rehydrate and given access to sodium-deficient diets for 24 h. This protocol should induce sodium appetite in mice, while minimally affecting thirst or hunger.\nNote: The time of sodium deprivation may need to be altered according to the study.\nWeigh each mouse.\nNote: We typically perform this step at 19:30 (ZG 12.5).\nProvide a fresh cage with a clean lid.\nIf a researcher chooses to replace bedding in the home cage, ensure that cage lids do not have any chow encrusted on them (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1244-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cleaning lids and valves\n(A) Chow encrusted on the lid of the home cage.\n(B) Rust formation inside the Lixit valve.\n(C) Aluminium foil coated in sodium chloride.\n(D) Scraping the inside of the Lixit valve with aluminium foil and sodium chloride.\n(E) Discolouration of sodium chloride as rust is removed from the Lixit valve.\n(F) Lixit valve with rust removed.\nWipe down cage lids with a water dampened paper towel to remove encrusted chow.\nNote: It is recommended to provide a fresh cage. Either way, the protocol should be adapted to follow the local guidance from animal facilities.\nCritical: The two previous steps ensure that remaining chow hidden inside the bedding or encrusted on the lid are removed and prevented from being used as a source of sodium.\nRemove the 300 mM NaCl solution containing drinking tube from the home cage.\nInject mice subcutaneously with 50 mg/kg of furosemide (10 mg/mL) in a 1 mL syringe with a 26G needle.\nVolume of furosemide to be injected can be calculated by mouse weight in grams × 5 μL.\nReplace food from the home cage with sodium-deficient diet.",
    "Clean the plastic part of the volumetric drinking tubes by scrubbing them gently under distilled water.\nIf necessary, remove rust from valves (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTwist a piece of aluminium foil into a shape that can fit inside the valve.\nDip the aluminium foil into water and then into sodium chloride to coat the foil in sodium chloride (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nScrub the insides of the valve with the sodium chloride-coated aluminium foil; sodium chloride will become discoloured as rust comes off the valves. Remove all rust from the inside of the valves (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D–2F).\nSoak the valves under copious amounts of distilled water to remove all traces of sodium.\nDry valves.\nFill the volumetric drinking tube with small amount of water and assemble with dried valve. Ensure the valve of the water tube is flowing properly by pressing on it. Fill the remaining water drinking tube with water and measure the volume.\nTwo-bottle assay\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step will measure sodium appetite in the sodium-depleted mice.\n23 h and 15 min later; weigh mice and remove distilled water from home cages.\nWeigh mice. Mice should have decreased body weight.\nMeasure water intake. Mice typically drink at least 3 mL of water during this period.\nPharmacological manipulations can be performed at this step if required.\nNote: We typically perform this step at 18:45 (ZG 11.75). For pharmacological experiments, this time may need to be adjusted accordingly for different drugs.\nClean the insides of the plastic tubes of the water-containing volumetric drinking tubes, by scrubbing gently under distilled water.\nFill volumetric drinking tubes with distilled water and sodium chloride solutions.\nEnsure that all air bubbles are removed from the inside of the valves by tapping on them lightly.\nPress on the Lixit valve lever to ensure that liquid flows from the valve.",
    "Drain out any remaining liquid inside the valves with a dry paper towel (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nCritical: Liquid remaining inside the valves can substantially alter measurements, leading to inconsistent results.\nBackfill the volumetric drinking tubes to full capacity using a 30 mL syringe with a 21G needle.\nNote: We perform steps 11 and 12 away from mice, in a different room, to avoid disturbing them.\nAt 24 h after sodium depletion, replace both distilled water and sodium chloride solution containing volumetric drinking tubes back to the home cage of mice.\nMeasure water and sodium chloride intake every hour for 4 h.\nNote: The duration of the test and frequency of measurements may need to be adjusted according to the study. We have found that a 4-hour assay is sufficient to measure elevated sodium intake in mice (Park et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), but other investigators also have used variable time intervals from as short as 1–2 h to as long as 6–24 h (Jarvie and Palmiter, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Matusda et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Resch et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Rowland and Morian, 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Ryan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1244-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
