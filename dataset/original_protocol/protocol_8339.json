    "The method described here is in agreement with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Guidelines and have been authorized by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Diego.\n1. Acclimatization to Handling\nHandling procedure\n\t\nPlace mouse cages in the biosafety cabinet. Remove the first mouse from the cage and place on a suitable surface (e.g. a clean cage lid) within the biosafety cabinet.\nGently restrain the mouse on the work surface by holding the base of the tail with the forefinger and thumb of one hand. Then, firmly stroke the ventral surface of the tail, from the base to the tip of the tail, with the forefinger and thumb of the other hand. Repeat this stroking 6 times (i.e. 1 set) and return the mouse to its cage.\nWait 6 min and repeat step 1.1.2.\n\t\tNOTE: In total, step 1.1.2 will be repeated 4 times per mouse (i.e. 4 sets of 6 strokes), so that each mouse will receive a total of 24 tail strokes on each day of handling.\nThe frequency of daily handling\n\t\nFrom five until two weeks before the planned blood collection day, handle mice as described in step 1.1, five days per week (mice are not handled on Saturday or Sunday until the final two weeks of acclimatization).\nIf experimental treatment during the sampling period will include any additional handling (e.g. scruffing or intraperitoneal injection), acclimatize the mice to this handling activity during each handling session.\n\t\tNote: For acclimatization to injection procedures, use a blunted needle to perform a sham injection.\nDuring the two weeks before the planned blood collection day, handle mice as described in 1.1, seven days per week.",
    "At least two weeks before the planned blood collection day, house mice in pairs to minimize disruptions to the mice during sampling.\n2. Preparation of Blood Collection Tubes\nPrepare ultrasensitive LH assay buffer in a glass bottle: 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS [0.2 g KCl, 8 g NaCl, 1.44 g Na2HPO4 (anhydrous), 0.24 g KH2PO4, ultrapure water to 1 L, pH 7.4, filter and autoclave], store at 4°C.1\n\tNOTE: Volume of ultrasensitive LH assay buffer to be prepared can be calculated based on the number of samples and the volume per sample as indicated below (2.2 & discussion)\nPrepare blood collection tubes (0.6mL microcentrifuge tubes). Label tubes and aliquot assay buffer (57 µL of buffer per tube; note, this volume may vary depending on the volume of blood collected or the ratio of the blood to the buffer desired). Tubes can be prepared days ahead of sampling, store at 4°C.\n3. Blood Collection\nPreparation of blood collection materials.\n\t\nPrepare biosafety cabinet for use, and arrange the following materials in the hood or on a cart nearby: 10 µL pipette (set to 3 µL or desired blood collection volume), pipette tips, waste bin for used pipette tips, timer, printout with animal numbers and sample numbers (for notes regarding sampling or animal issues), ice bucket with blood collection tubes, scissors, and small gauze (2\" x 2\").\n\t\tNOTE: The \"count up\" function on a laboratory timer is useful because it does not have an audible alarm that could disturb the mice\nUse a permanent marker to mark the tail of each mouse (near the base) to assist with rapid identification of the correct mouse during sampling.\nClipping of the tail and pre-blood collection preparation.",
    "At 45 min before the start of the blood collection, remove the first mouse from its cage and place on a suitable surface (a clean cage lid works well) within the biosafety cabinet.\nUse sharp, sterile scissors to remove 1-2 mm of the tip of the mouse tail, following aseptic preparation (i.e. scrub with alcohol and betadine).\n\t\tNOTE: This can be accomplished in awake animals with gentle restraint or under isoflurane anesthesia.  Additionally, analgesia may be provided following the recommendation of the local IACUC.\nCarefully stroke the tail of the mouse as described above (1.1.2; 1-2 strokes are generally sufficient) until the droplet of blood forms on the tail tip.\nUse a pipette with a clean tip to collect 3 µL of blood from the tail tip and discard the pipette tip with blood.\nBefore returning the mouse to its cage, ensure that blood flow has stopped. If necessary, apply gentle pressure with sterile gauze.\nRepeat steps 3.2.1 - 3.2.5 for all mice. Subsequent blood samples can be collected by firmly stroking the mouse's tail until a droplet of blood forms at the tip of the tail.\n\t\tNOTE: If a blood droplet does not form after firm strokes, the tail can be dabbed with a gauze pad soaked in saline. Clots are more likely to form during less frequent sampling (i.e. >15 min intervals). Once the clot is cleared from the vein, sampling can continue.\nContinue to collect 3 µL of blood from each mouse as described above every 6 min for approximately 45 min during this pre-blood collection preparation period. Discard the blood and pipette tip.\nBlood sampling",
    "Collect 3 µL of blood from the tail tip as described above. Take caution to ensure that the entire 3 µL sample is taken into the pipette tip (without bubbles or bedding contamination). Eject the blood sample into the assay buffer in a labeled tube. Mix by inversion and return the tube to ice.\nBefore returning the mouse to its cage, ensure that the blood flow has stopped. If necessary, apply gentle pressure with sterile gauze.\nRepeat steps 3.3.1 - 3.3.2 for each mouse, every 6 min, for the predetermined sampling duration. Monitor each animal for signs of distress (e.g. partially closed eyelids, hunched position [not caused by other treatment] or lack of response to handling) and terminate sampling, if necessary.\n\t\tNOTE: Behavioral distress or other complications that require termination of sampling occur extremely rarely in our laboratory.\nIf animals are not euthanized following blood sampling, ensure that the blood flow from the tail-tip has completely stopped. Wipe any spilled blood from the inside of each animal's cage (or change cages) and return the animal cages to the housing rack.\n4. Sample Processing and Analysis\nStore blood samples at -20 °C until analysis.\n\tNOTE: LH is assayed in whole blood samples diluted in assay buffer; no separation of sera or plasma is required prior to storage or analysis.\nAssay blood samples by ultrasensitive ELISA as described previously1 and report values in ng/mL of whole blood following correction for dilution of the sample volume in the assay buffer.\nIdentify LH pulses in the data set. Calculate and compare mean pulse amplitude and pulse frequency (or inter-pulse interval) as appropriate for the data set.\n\tNOTE: Published criteria13,14 and programs,15,16 for detecting LH pulses are available.\nSubscription Required.
