  "procedures": [
    "All procedures involving experimental animals were in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act and approved by the ethics committee of the university of kiel. Parvalbumin-Cre (Pvalb-IRES-Cre) mice23 (Jackson laboratories, Repository number 008069) were maintained as heterozygous colonies or crossed with Ai9 Cre reporter mice24 (Jackson laboratories, Repository number 007909). Female and male mice between P40-P90 were used. Mice were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle under standard group housing conditions and were provided with food and water ad libitum.\n1. Preparation of solutions\nNOTE: Prepare fresh solutions for every experimental day using ultrapure water (UPW) (resistivity at 25 °C 18.2 MΩcm). The solutions may be stored at 4 °C for a maximum of one day. Magnesium and calcium solutions can be stored separately as 1 M stock solutions. All the working solutions must be saturated with carbogen (95% O2:5% CO2) for optimal oxygenation and pH maintenance before and during use.\nPrepare the cutting solution (500 mL per mouse) (in mM): 92 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 Na-ascorbate, 4 Na-pyruvate, 0.5 CaCl2·2H2O, and 10 MgSO4·7H2O. Titrate to pH 7.4 under a chemical hood with 4-5 mL of 16% hydrochloric acid before adding the divalent cations. This will avoid the precipitation of MgSO4.\n\tNOTE: KCl and NaH2PO4 can be stored as 10x solutions at 4°C. We make two individual batches of cutting solution. One the day before the recording (stored in a freezer over night to produce crushed ice) and one on the day of recording.\nPrepare the storage solution (250 mL per mouse) (in mM): 92 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 Na-ascorbate, 4 Na-pyruvate, 2 CaCl2·2H2O, and 2 MgSO4·7H2O. Titrate to pH 7.3-7.4 with 1 N NaOH.",
    "NOTE: NaCl, KCl and NaH2PO4 can be stocked as 10x solution at 4 °C.\nPrepare ACSF for recording (in mM): 122 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 24 NaHCO3, 12.5 glucose, 2 CaCl2·2H2O, and 2 MgSO4·7H2O, 2 Na-ascorbate, 4 Na-pyruvate. Titrate pH to 7.3-7.4 with 1 N NaOH.\n\tNOTE: NaCl, KCl and NaH2PO4 can be combined in a 10x stock solution at 4°C.\n2. Preparation of the bench for slicing\nPrepare on ice a beaker (150 mL) and two glass Petri dishes (10 cm diameter) and fill them with the fresh cutting solution. Keep the solution oxygenated with a carbogen bubbling device (a perforated tube or an air-stone connected to the carbogen system).\n\tNOTE: The solution in the beaker will be used for the perfusion while the Petri dishes will be used during the cutting procedure.\nEquip the surgery bench with a stainless-steel blade, rounded tip tweezers, fine tip tweezers, big scissors, small scissors, a large metal spatula, a thin metal spatula, a brush, the vibratome plate and cyanoacrylate glue or the less toxic n-butyl-ester cyanoacrylate adhesive. Immerge a stainless-steel blade and a piece of filter paper in one of the glass Petri dishes on ice. This Petri will be used to cut the brain. Draw three parallel lines onto the bottom of a plastic Petri dish and position this dish close to the surgical instruments.\nPrepare the set up for the trans-cardial perfusion according to published protocols25.\nPrepare the vibratome, mounting a new blade on the blade holder and set the parameters for cutting (angle of the blade from horizontal plane 17°, blade oscillation amplitude 1.5 mm, blade forward movement velocity at around 2 mm min-1, Oscillation frequency 90 Hz, section thickness 350 µm). Fill the vibratome tray with ice-cold cutting solution and keep it under constant oxygenation.",
    "NOTE: We add the crushed ice made from the first batch of cutting solution to the cooled fresh cutting solution to keep the temperature down. Pay attention to keep the ice from the blade while slicing.\nPrepare an incubation chamber filled with the cutting solution under constant oxygenation. Place the chamber in a pre-warmed water bath (35 °C).\n\tNOTE: An example for the incubation chamber can be found in Edwards and Konnerth (1992)26.\nPrepare a slice storage chamber filled with the storage solution and keep it at room temperature and under constant oxygenation. In case the tissue expresses a fluorescent protein or a light-activated opsin, it is recommendable to keep the chamber in the dark, for example, inside a box.\n\tNOTE: a storage chamber with multiple independent wells is useful to distinguish the level of the slices along the dorsoventral axis of the Hippocampus. A custom-made chamber can be built (Figure 1D). Take a piece of vial spacer grid from an 81x cryogenic vial storage box and glue the bottom on to a nylon net. Insert the upper one third of a 5mL pipette plastic tip into the center of this grid, so that it sticks out about 3 cm at the bottom. This plastic tip serves as the stand of the grid and later holds the air tubing for oxygenation. Insert the grid with its stand into a cylindric plastic box (e.g., packaging of syringe filters) so that it cannot tilt or wobble. This reservoir will hold 250 mL of storage solution.\n3. Preparation of hippocampal slices\nAnesthetize the mouse in a box chamber using isoflurane (about 0.5 mL) under the hood. Leave the mouse resting until breathing is slow and regular (about 2-3 minutes). Test for the absence of pain responses with toe pinches.",
    "Perform trans-cardial perfusion using 25 mL of carbonated cutting solution from the beaker on ice following published protocols25,27. This step is recommended to cool down the brain rapidly to quickly slow neuronal metabolism.\nDecapitate the animal using the big scissors and place the head into the cooled Petri dish on ice containing the cutting solution.\nOpen the skin with the fine scissors to expose the skull. Make small lateral incisions into the base of the skull on both sides of the foramen magnum. Then cut along the sagittal suture starting at the foramen magnum until reaching the naso-frontal suture above the olfactory bulb. Pull up the scissor during the sagittal cut to avoid damage of the underlying brain tissue.\n\tNOTE: Keeping the head submerged in the cutting solution helps to clear it from blood and keeps the temperature down.\nUse the rounded tip tweezer to pull up the parietal bones to expose the brain. Pay attention to get hold of and remove the meninges too. If left, they can damage the brain during extraction.\nUse the small spatula to gently scoop out the brain into the second Petri dish.\nCut the brain in halves along the longitudinal fissure using the pre-chilled blade.\nUse the large spatula to lift one hemisphere out of the cutting solution and onto the plastic Petri dish. With the hemisphere lying on its medial surface, align the parietal cortex with one of the parallel lines to have a reference for the second cut as shown in Figure 1B.",
    "Perform the second cut at the ventral part of the hemisphere positioning the blade in parallel to the lines to obtain the surface, which is later used for gluing the brain onto the specimen holder (see next step), as shown in Figure 1B. Return the hemisphere into the oxygenated cutting solution of the glass petri dish and perform the same procedure on the second hemisphere.\nGlue the hemispheres with the freshly cut ventral side onto the vibratome-specimen holder using the adhesive. Put a few drops of cutting solution onto the hemispheres to solidify the glue and move the specimen holder into the vibratome tray. This way the slicing will proceed from the dorsal to the ventral hippocampus.\nRemove the initial one or two non-transversal slices (Figure 1C,ii-iii) until the region of interest becomes visible and then start collecting the slices.\n\tNOTE: Non-transversal but usable, healthy slices can be obtained from the dorsal hippocampus at the beginning of the slicing procedure (Figure 1C,ii-iii). The collection of each slice requires about 3-4 min. By starting the cutting from the dorsal instead of ventral hippocampus we save about 10 minutes, which improves the viability of dorsal slices.\nWith a plastic pipette (cut away the narrow end of the tip) transfer each slice into the incubation chamber (containing cutting solution at 35 °C) and let it rest for 12 min. The brief recovery period in warm cutting solution greatly reduces initial neuronal swelling, as reported in Ting et al. (2014)28. Then using a brush transfer the slice into the storage chamber (containing storage solution at RT) and let it rest until the start of the experiment.\n4. Whole-cell recording and biocytin filling",
    "NOTE: The description of whole-cell patch-clamp recording is reduced here only to key steps that help to obtain good biocytin filling and is generally applicable to neurons in ACSF. For details regarding the procedures of electrophysiological recordings, several other protocols can be consulted29,30.\nChoose an appropriate intracellular solution according to the parameters to be recorded. As an example, for current clamp measurements, a potassium gluconate-based solution can be used (in mM): 135 K-Gluconate, 3 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine-Na2, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na2-GTP. Adjust the pH to 7.3 with 1 M KOH. The osmolality should be around 285-290 mOsmol/kg once 3-5 mg/mL biocytin is added.\n\tNOTE: To monitor the shape of the neuron during the recording, 0.3-0.5 µL/mL of 1 mM Alexa Fluor Hydrazide can be added to the intracellular solution. In this case, remember for biocytin revelation, to match the Alexa dye color with the fluorescent probe coupled to streptavidin.\nPrepare patch-clamp electrodes of ≤1 µm tip diameter and 3-5 MΩ resistance from thick-walled borosilicate capillaries.\nStart the perfusion system of the patch-clamp setup with a speed of 2.5-3 mL/min at RT or 35-37 °C and secure a slice in the chamber with a U-shaped anchor.\nIdentify the brain region of interest and choose a healthy neuron with the soma at least 30-50 µm below the surface of the slice.\n\tNOTE: The soma of a healthy neuron has a smooth surface, and the membrane borders are slightly contrasted. The soma of unhealthy neuron appears shrunk and highly contrasted or swollen and semi-transparent.\nLoad a glass pipette with the intracellular solution until the tip of the AgCl electrode is covered. Move the pipette into the solution of the recording chamber, applying a light positive pressure to keep clear the tip of the glass electrode.",
    "NOTE: If the solution contains an Alexa dye, the pressure can be controlled visually adjusting the amount of fluorescent solution released from the tip. Minimal pressure would avoid the staining of the tissue around the cell.\nApproach the cell from an oblique angle and establish contact within the first one third of the soma surface when forming the giga-seal. Release the pressure, slowly move the holding potential to-65 mV and apply a gentle suction by mouth to facilitate the giga-seal formation.\nTo establish the whole-cell configuration, apply strong and brief suction to break the membrane. Discard the recording if the neuron has a membrane potential more depolarized than-50 mV, if the holding current is increasing beyond 100 pA or if the access resistance increases beyond 30 MΩ.\nAfter the recording (for sufficient filling of somata and dendrites at least 15 min are recommended; for filling of complex axons up to one hour maybe required31) carefully remove the electrode. To this end set the holding potential to 0 mV and try to re-form a giga-seal by slowly retracting the pipette in the direction opposite from the approach, such as to obtain an outside-out patch configuration.\n\tNOTE: The presence of the Alexa dye in the intracellular solutions helps the visually guided removal of the pipette from the neuronal surface. If the nucleus of the cell is not in contact with the pipette tip, a quick method to reform the seal is pulling the pipette out of the tissue diagonally and upward at high speed. If the nucleus or part of the membrane resides within the tip, there is a danger of breaking the plasma membrane. In this case, a slight positive pressure application and lateral movement can help.",
    "Note the position of the cell and the orientation of the slice. After fixation the exact orientation of the slice and the integrity of the filled cell can be checked under a fluorescent microscope.\n5. Immunostaining, image acquisition and morphological reconstruction\nAfter recording, transfer the slices into a 24-well plate to fix it in paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Incubate for 60 min at RT or overnight at 4 °C, according to the sensitivity of the primary antibodies used. Slices can be stored in 0.1 M PBS and 0.02% NaN3.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic. Use under the hood.\nPerform immunostaining and biocytin revelation within one week of recording according to established protocols32,33.\n\tNOTE: We use a procedure that avoids re-sectioning of the slice to preserve the integrity of dendritic and axonal processes. However, this procedure requires longer incubation times as antibodies need to penetrate into the tissue. We suggest testing the time for optimal penetration of antibodies into the tissue before performing the experiment.\nAcquire images using a confocal microscope with Z-stack and tile-scanning function.\nPerform morphological reconstruction using Fiji imageJ34.\n\tNOTE: Several image file formats can be imported into the program using the Bio-format plugin. We recommend the use of the Simple Neurite Tracer (STN) plugin35 for the reconstruction of the dendrites and the axon. A simple and clear tutorial is available at https://imagej.net/SNT and http://snyderlab.com/2016/05/25/tracing-neurons-using-fiji-imagej/. The file containing the tracing data(.traces), if saved un-compressed, can be converted into a text file and opened with Matlab or other software for text data processing."
