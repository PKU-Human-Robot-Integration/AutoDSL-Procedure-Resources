  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by the University of Miami Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines. The use to sterile equipment and aseptic techniques is required.\n1. Preparing the Occlusion Suture\nUse a suture of 0.21 mm diameter for mice between 20 - 25 g and 0.23 mm for mice between 25 - 35 g of body weight. The choice of the type of sutures for the MCAO procedure depends on animal weight.\nUsing a silver pen, mark the suture at 9 mm starting from the silicone coated tip. This will serve as a guide for insertion length.\n2. Preparation for Surgery\nAnesthetize mouse with isoflurane mixed with oxygen, using a laboratory anesthesia system. Use isoflurane at setting 5 and oxygen flow at 2 on the commercial machine (See Materials Table). Transfer the animal to the surgery surface and sustain anesthesia using a nose cone (use isoflurane setting 1.5 - 2.5 and oxygen flow at 2).\n\t\nEnsure that the mouse respiratory rate is around 1 - 2 respiration per sec without gasping. In addition, ensure that the animal does not exhibit whiskers stimulation reaction and pedal reflex (toe pinch). Monitor respiration rate and effort during the surgery, at least every 5 min.\nPut a drop of ophthalmic lubricant on each eye using a sterile swab to prevent them from drying during the procedure. Alternatively, apply ophthalmic ointment to the eye from a sterile pharmaceutical tube.\nFlip the animal on its back and shave the incision area. Afterward, thoroughly disinfect the surgery area using 70% ethanol, followed by Chlorhexidine, and the final swab with 70% ethanol. Place the animal on a warm surgical surface under a stereomicroscope.\n3. Dissection of the Common Carotid Artery and Internal/External Branching",
    "Using surgical scissors and forceps, perform a shallow midline incision in the neck, from above the breast bone to below the jaw (approximately 3 - 4 cm).  Surgical drape should be placed around the surgery area to prevent instruments from coming in contact with non-sterile surfaces. The surgical drape was omitted in the current video to aid filming.\nUsing forceps, carefully separate fatty and connective tissue to expose the trachea. Tissue should easily and naturally separate to both sides.\nPlace a pillow (round object, about 0.5 cm in diameter) on the back of the neck of the mice to extend the neck, further exposing the area for surgery.\nOpen the incision using either a tissue retractor or hooks.\nOn the animal's left side of the trachea, carefully tweeze apart the connective tissue to expose the left common carotid artery (CCA). Be careful not to damage nerves and major veins bundled with the CCA.\nContinue exposing the CCA, being careful to detach from underlying tissue, and expose the top \"Y\" branching of the internal cerebral artery (ICA) and external cerebral artery (ECA). To aid in detaching the CCA, insert the curved forceps under the CCA to pierce the connective tissue and then slowly allow them to open.\n4. Preparation of the CCA for the MCAO Suture Insertion\nInsert 3 segments of nylon suture of about 4 cm in length under the CCA. Ensure that the CCA is not twisted as this would drastically complicate the insertion of the suture.\nAt the lowest point possible, close the bottom suture using a permanent knot.\nTie the top suture just below the ICA/ECA branching using a removable slip knot.",
    "Tie the middle suture using a removable slip knot, but keep it wide open. It is important to leave plenty of space as not to hinder suture insertion.\nUsing microdissection spring scissors, perform an incision in the CCA between the bottom and middle sutures. Perform the 0.2 mm incision close to the bottom suture.\n5. Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion\nUsing forceps, insert the MCAO suture into the CCA incision, guiding it up to the top. Perform this step quickly after step 4.5 to prevent clotting and closing of the CCA opening. In the event that suture insertion is blocked, use the tips of forceps to reopen the incision.\nGently tie down the middle suture on the MCAO suture silicone part using a slip knot to restrict blood flow around it, but loose enough to allow it to move freely.\nCarefully undo the top suture, making sure that the MCAO suture does not slip out.\nInsert the MCAO suture in the ICA by a couple of millimeters and then reclose the top suture, in the same manner as described in step 5.2.\nGuide the MCAO suture to the occlusion area. Indication of successful insertion is evident by the low amount of blood backflow from the CCA incision and that the silver 9 mm mark is situated between the CCA incision and the ICA/ECA bifurcation. Further confirmation of successful occlusion can be obtained using monitoring methods such as a laser Doppler blood flow monitoring system15,16.\n\tNOTE: A drop in 90% of blood flow to the middle brain area on the occluded area side indicates successful occlusion.\nAfter successful occlusion, tie down the middle and top suture tightly. If performing sham insertion, do not reclose sutures but instead immediately skip to step 7.3.\n6. Incision Closing and Post-operative Care",
    "Tuck in the sutures into the incision area.\nRemove retractor or tissue hooks and pillow.\nClean suture area using sterile saline and a cotton swab.\nClose the incision using nylon suture/needle and forceps.\nAdminister anti-inflammatory (e.g., Carprofen 10 mg/kg, s.c.) and analgesic (e.g., Buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg s.c., twice a day) drugs to alleviate post-operative discomfort. Place the mice in a cage placed on a heated pad to prevent hypothermia and give ad labium access to water and softened food.\nMonitor the recovery of animals (5 - 10 min) and for signs of stroke. They can vary from mild lateral paralysis and circling to severe contraction of the contralateral flank and rolling. Several evaluation points are listed in the discussion. Animals displaying signs of respiratory distress or severe seizures should be euthanized.\nDepending on ischemia reperfusion protocol, leave the MCAO suture in place from 30 min to 120 min or more. Reducing occlusion time prevents mortality.\nFor permanent occlusion, leave the MCAO suture in place for 24 hr, however significant mortality rate is to be expected. After this time lapse, proceed to step 7.\n\t\nIf using permanent occlusion model, keep mice in cage until end point. At that time, remove suture (steps 7.1 to 7.8). This procedure can also be performed after euthanasia.\n7. Reperfusion\nAnesthetize the animal again (follow instructions in 2.1) and remove wound closing sutures.\nUsing forceps and tissue separators, re-open the incision and expose the CCA.\nCarefully remove the top suture and gently pull on the MCAO suture until the silicone coated part is situated at the middle knot.\nRedo the top knot on the suture to prevent blood from flowing pass the suture (it does not have to be a slip knot).",
    "Carefully undo the middle knot and pull the suture past the top knot, but keep it inside the CCA.\nTightly close the top knot to block artery blood flow.\nPull out completely the MCAO suture and close tightly the middle knot.\nThe MCAO suture can be re-used several times. After each use, clean the suture carefully in 70% ethanol to remove contaminants (e.g., blood or tissue) using a sterile gauze. Afterwards, place the suture in a sterilizer pouch and sterilize it.\nRepeat steps 6.1 - 6.4 and monitor animal recovery.\n8. Tissue Analysis\nTo monitor stroke volume, dissect out the brain.\n\t\nEuthanize the mouse using a two-step process. First, expose the animal to an overdose of isoflurane until breathing stops. For TTC staining, decapitate the mouse immediately and proceed to brain extraction. For brain sectioning (e.g., for immunostaining analyses), perform perfusion via a cardiac puncture prior to decapitation.  \nCut-off the head at the base of the skull and cut the scalp from the neck opening to the top of the skull up to between the eyes. With the skull exposed, cut the bone along both sides starting from the skull base opening up to the eye socket. Make this cut along the wide part of the skull. Be careful not to reach too deep with scissors to prevent damaging the brain.\nAfterwards, cut the bone between the two eye sockets.\nUsing forceps, lift up the top of the skull to expose the brain. There should be only a small resistance. If it does not lift easily, skull incisions may be incomplete. Pry out the brain gently using blunt curved forceps. The brain might still be attached by several nerves. Proceed slowly, removing attachments along the way.",
    "Place the fresh brain in a 1 mm brain matrix, add a couple of drops of PBS, and slice along the matrix using a razor blade or cryostat blade.\nTransfer the brain to a 100 mm dish and add staining solution (2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride [TTC] dissolved in PBS) to cover the bottom of the dish. Using two forceps, separate all brain slices (front facing down) and place them in order at the bottom of the dish.\n\tNOTE: Staining will turn viable tissue red, with non-viable tissue remaining white. Warming the solution to 37 °C will accelerate staining. Signs of stroke area (white) can be seen as quickly as 90 min post stroke and remain visible for more than 7 days. Imaging should be done along with a ruler to allow calculation of stroke volume.\nProcess dissected brains for sectioning, immuno-staining, protein isolation, or a variety of other procedures17,18,19.\nSubscription Required.
