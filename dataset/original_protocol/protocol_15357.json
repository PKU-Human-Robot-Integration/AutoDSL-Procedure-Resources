    "Our experimental plan is schematically diagrammed in Figure 1.\n1. Growth and preparation of human neural stem cells (NSCs) for transplantation\nThe EnStem-A cell line (EMD Millipore) was used in this study. NSCs are routinely validated by the manufacturer for high levels of expression of the multipotent markers nestin and Sox2, and low-level expression of the pluripotent marker Oct-4, along with the ability to differentiate into multiple neuronal phenotypes and to maintain a normal karyotype after multiple passages. Under our growth conditions, these NSCs displayed abundant expression of Sox2 and nestin and retained their ability to differentiate, as described previously1. NSCs were grown on poly-L-ornithine (20 μg/ml) and laminin (5 μg/ml) coated tissue culture treated flasks. Cells were grown in neural expansion medium (Millipore) supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 20 ng/ml). Adherent monolayers of NSCs were passaged every other day (1:2) with accutase as the dissociation agent1. For transplantation studies, NSCs were used at passages below 10.\nNSCs were labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) by supplementing the growth media with 4 μM BrdU for three days prior to transplantation. To verify the BrdU labeling index (i.e. percentage of BrdU positive cells), cells were plated on chamber slides and processed for BrdU detection using standard immunocytochemical approaches. Cells utilized for transplantation routinely exhibit labeling indices in excess of 90%2. Alternatively, transplanted human stem cells were detected using the human specific nuclear antigen marker (HuNu)2.\nOn the day of transplantation, accutase and neural expansion media were pre-warmed in a 37°C water bath. Cells were placed in incubation medium (neural expansion media containing 10 μM of Y-27632) for one hour. Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor, EMD-Calbiochem) was used to improve the survival of NSCs post-transplantation.",
    "After one hour, incubation media was removed and cells were treated with accutase for 5 minutes. After this brief treatment add an equal volume of neural expansion media to neutralize the accutase and strain the cells through a 70 μM cell strainer.\nCount the cells with a haemocytometer and prepare 1.0 x 105 live NSCs per microliter in injection medium (neural expansion media containing 10 μM of Y-27632, 40 ng/ml bFGF, 20 ng/ml BDNF).\nCells were stored in neural expansion media (as described in 1.5) and kept on ice until the time of transplantation, and should be used within 6h to minimize cell death by prolonged cold-storage.\n2. Radiotherapy - treatment planning and irradiation\nSedated athymic nude rat(s) were placed in a laboratory MRI scanner in the prone position with the skull at the superior end (head first). This 3 tesla scanner is designed for small animal scans. It can provide exquisite soft-tissue contrast with high spatial resolution cross-sectional (axial) images. The scan focused on the skull region and a set of 22 T2 E60 weighted images with 0.8 mm image thickness were generated. These images provide necessary information to identify the left and right hippocampi within the rat's brain.\nFollowing the MRI scan (24h), animals were sedated [anesthesia cocktail (ketamine, 30 mg/kg, xylazine, 2.5 mg/kg and acepromazine, 1 mg/kg)] and placed in a radiation oncology CT scanner where another cross-sectional (axial) image volume was generated. The rat was placed in the same or close to the same position as used for the MRI scan and the CT unit was set to scan the skull region. A study of 106 CT images with 0.8 mm image thickness was generated which became the CT treatment planning data.\nTreatment Planning",
    "The MRI and CT image data were transferred to the ECLIPSE (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) treatment planning software via DICOM (Digital-Imaging and Communications in Medicine). ECLIPSE is a sophisticated and commercially available software used in radiation oncology to model and design the best radiation treatment plan for a patient. It incorporates organ density information that is extracted from the CT image data and used to calculate the radiation dose distribution within the body.\nCover the animal using a small surgical drape with only the head exposed. Position the animal head firmly within the stereotaxic frame (Benchmark Digital, Leica-myNeurolab) by inserting ear bars into the external auditory meatus. Take extreme care when sliding the tip of the ear bar into the ear canal. Place the incisor bar by hooking the rat's upper incisors and adjusting the bar height to the standard reference point, then tighten nose clamp.\nCenter the position of the head between the ear bars with minimal lateral movement (± 4 mm) to achieve stereotaxic zero.\nThe next step in the process is to determine the irradiation technique to be used. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetrically-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the form of RapidArc are 2 high-precision irradiation techniques that use a 6 MV photon beam to deliver a radiation dose3-6. The difference between these techniques is that IMRT delivers a dose using several static trajectories each corresponding to a different direction but converging at the target volume more suitable for extremely small target volumes. RapidArc on the other hand, delivers a dose dynamically through one or more arcs focused on the target region (Fig. 4).",
    "Regardless of delivery technique, information on target dose, target conformity and dose constraints to critical organs have to be entered in the dose optimization window in ECLIPSE. This information along with organ volumes is used to tailor the dose distribution, which is achieved by continually varying the beam attenuation during irradiation.\nOnce a plan was generated, ECLIPSE provides the calculated dose superimposed to the axial, coronal and sagittal images (Fig. 5) as well as in dose-volume histogram (DVH) format (Fig. 6). It is at this point when the plan must be evaluated to determine if it is suitable for delivery or needs to be improved.\nIrradiation Process\n\t\nOnce a plan was approved for delivery, digitally-reconstructed radiograph (DRR) images were generated from the CT treatment planning data in ECLIPSE. These are orthogonal images weighted on bone density to highlight the skull and other bony landmarks. Thereafter, treatment plan and DRRs are sent to the treatment delivery computer system via DICOM.\nThe delivery system controls a Varian Trilogy Linear Accelerator normally used for radiotherapy of humans. The accelerator is equipped with 120 computer controlled thin multileaf collimators (MLC) and a diagnostic quality x-ray imaging system included within the on-board imaging (OBI) system. This delivery system uploads the ECLIPSE-specific information and reconfigures the collimator parameters in the accelerator for delivering the planned dose.\nAt this point the rat was prepared for irradiation, sedated and covered with a paper blanket to keep it warm. After a few minutes, the rat, with its blanket but with the skull exposed, was placed on the treatment table in the same position used to generate the CT scan. This is a critical step because position accuracy is directly correlated to accuracy in dose delivery.",
    "Once the rat was positioned properly on the treatment table, a set of orthogonal X-ray images is taken using the Trilogy's OBI system. These are high resolution images that were subsequently fused to the ECLIPSE generated DRRs using the OBI image fusion software.\nThe X-ray images and DRRs were digitally matched using software that provide information on table position shifts that must be made to achieve co-registration of the images (Fig. 7). After reviewing this information and verifying that the resultant shifts do not inadvertently lead into any collisions between the accelerator and the treatment table, the computer applies the shifts and the treatment table moves automatically to the desired position.\nAt this point, irradiation commences. To deliver a 10 Gy dose with a 6-field IMRT plan, the beam-on time is approximately 10 minutes while a two-arc RapidArc takes ~3 minutes. After treatment delivery is complete, the rat was removed from the treatment room and allowed to recover in a holding cage kept on a heating pad.\n3. Stereotaxic surgery for intra-hippocampal transplantation of human stem cells\nAnimals husbandry and surgical preparation\n\t\nFor this study, we employed two month old ATN rats acquired from National Cancer Institute (strain 0N01 Cr:NIH-rnu). Animals were kept in sterile cages and maintained in a temperature- and light controlled barrier-A environment with 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. Rats were provided autoclaved food and water ad libitum and care was taken to prevent eye infection by cleaning eyes every week with Vetropolycin eye ointment (Western Medical Supply, Arcadia, CA).",
    "For stereotaxic surgery, rats were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of anesthesia cocktail (ketamine, 30 mg/kg, xylazine, 2.5 mg/kg and acepromazine, 1 mg/kg). Complete anesthesia was induced after 10-15 minutes and sedation was monitored using palpable reflex (toe pinch). If required during surgery, 15-20% of the original dose may be given to maintain sufficient anesthesia.\nRemove fur from head using electric clippers. Approximately 200% of surgery area should be shaved to prevent infection by hairs. Clean shaved part using providone/iodine (3 times) followed by 70% alcohol (3 times) before incision.\nStereotaxic surgery\n\t\nStereotaxic instruments (digital monitor and frame), micromotor drill, dry bed sterilizer and controllers should be kept in a Laminar flow hood to prevent possible infection during surgery procedure in ATN rats. A stereotaxic stage with an embedded heating pad can be used to keep the animals warm during surgery. We used 'Kimberly-Clark Safeskin Purple Nitrile Sterile Exam Gloves' thoughout the surgery. These gloves are individually packed in sterile bag (Cat. no. 55093). In addition, surgeon used 70% alcohol spray to sterilize hands during surgery.\nCover the animal using a small surgical drape with only the head exposed. Position the animal head firmly within the stereotaxic frame (Benchmark Digital, Leica-myNeurolab) by inserting ear bars into the external auditory meatus. Take extreme care when sliding the tip of the ear bar into the ear canal. Place the incisor bar by hooking the rat's upper incisors and adjusting the bar height to the standard reference point, then tighten nose clamp.\nCenter the position of the head between the ear bars with minimal lateral movement (± 4 mm) to achieve stereotaxic zero.\nFollowing these positioning steps, apply lubricating eye ointment to prevent drying and protect them from possible iodine or alcohol spills. Use this ointment at least 2 times during surgery.",
    "Make midline skin incision (2 cm) along scalp using sterile scalpel, and clean using sterile cotton tipped applicator. Avoid damage in caudal and neck muscles areas.\nBy using dissecting retractor, hold the periosteum open and clear soft tissue using cotton tipped applicator dipped in 1% hydrogen peroxide (made in PBS). To stop bleeding, maintain firm pressure for at least 1 min using cotton tipped applicator or gauze. Apply firm scraping motion to clean skull and dabbing motion for skin until skull sutures, bregma and lambda were visible.\nPrecise stereotaxic coordinates, referenced to the bregma, were determined using the rat brain atlas7. Stem cell transplantation was done at four distinct sites for each hemisphere using the following stereotaxic coordinates:\n\t\t\nAnterio-posterior (AP) 3.0 mm from bregma, medio-lateral (ML) 1.8mm from midline, and dorso-ventral (DV) 3.2mm from the surface of the brain.\nAP, 3.6 mm; ML, 2.5 mm; DV, 3.2 mm\nAP, 4.2 mm; ML, 3.2 mm; DV, 3.2mm\nAP, 4.2 mm; ML, 3.2 mm; DV, 3.2mm\nOnce the bregma has been identified, all three coordinates (AP, ML and DV) should be zeroed on the digital display/controller (on the digital stereotaxic frame). Then proceed to mark the precise transplantation sites (using the foregoing coordinates) with a fine point marker pen attached to a small probe holder on the frame.\nDrill a 0.35mm hole (no. 1/4 dental burr, carbide vanadium drill bits) through the skull using the foot pedal controlled micromotor drill (Leica-myNeurolab). Take care to prevent damage to the dura membrane. If bleeding occurs during drilling, apply firm pressure using cotton tipped applicator. Do not apply alcohol or iodine at the drill site, as this will cause irritation to the animal.",
    "Rats received bilateral intra-hippocampal injections of a suspension of NSCs injected in a maximum volume of 1 μL using a 5 μL Hamilton microsyringe (30 gauge). The precise number of cells within this volume will vary according to experimental specifics. To accomplish this, the microsyringe was attached to a small probe holder on the stereotaxic frame. Carefully insert the tip of the needle in the skull until reaching the surface of the brain (i.e. meninges). At this point, the DV coordinate should be zeroed on the digital display/controller, then gently insert the needle to the desired depth (DV, 3.2 mm). Wait 1 min before initiating any injection of cells.\nInject 0.25 μL volume/min (slow release) using a timer. Once a total of 1 μL is injected, wait 8 min before retracting needle from transplantation site. After this time, slowly retract the needle from the transplantation site (0.5 mm/min) to prevent capillary reflux of the injection contents back through the needle track.\nFollow steps 3.2(j-k) for the remaining transplantation sites (4 per hemisphere).\nRemove the skin retractor from the skull and use blunt tweezers to gently pull back retracted skin and apply 4-5 sterile stainless clips using Autoclips surgical suture applier (Leica-myNeurolab).\nAfter removing the animal from the frame, inject with analgesic (Buprenorphin, 0.1 mg/kg, s.c., every 12h) and Lactated Ringer's solution (5 mL/250 g adult rat, s.c.).\nPlace the animal back in its cage that should be kept on a heating pad. Monitor the animal until it becomes conscious before returning to its holding room. Place some moistened pellets (animal chow) and transgel in a separate petri dish in each animal cage. Alternatively, DietGel Recovery (ClearH2O, Portland, ME) can be used as a source of water and nutrients.",
    "Monitor animals during their recovery time and apply analgesia (buprenorphine 0.02 mg/kg (every 12h for 2 days). Check for signs of pain, distress, reddening or infection of surgery site. Apply providone/iodine or neosporin ointment once daily (till 2-3 days) to prevent possible infection. If any signs of infection, pain or distress persist following analgesic or antibiotic treatment within 12 hours of surgery, consult veterinarian or animal care staff for further assistance.\n4.
