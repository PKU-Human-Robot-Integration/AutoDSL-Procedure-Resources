    "1. Axonal Labeling\nClimbing fibers can be labeled by injecting either organic dyes conjugated to high molecular weight dextrans or plasmid/viruses that induce the expression of fluorescent proteins26-29. In this protocol, the organic dye Alexa Fluor Dextran 488 is injected into the inferior olive to label climbing fibers and visualize them in the cerebellar cortex (Figure 1). All the procedures described here have been approved by the Italian Ministry of Health.\nPrepare the glass capillary tube by pulling it on a micropipette puller. Trim the tip of the glass capillary tube with scissors till the external diameter is about 30 µm.\nLoad the capillary with 1-2 µl of the dextran-conjugated dye.\nBefore starting, sterilize all the surgical instruments in an autoclave. During the procedure, reduce risks of contamination by using a glass bead sterilizer.\nAnesthetize the mouse (9-12 weeks) by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (9 mg/kg). Ensure the animal is fully sedated using tail and/or toe pinches. Use vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nShave the hairs above the neck with either a razor blade or hair removal cream. Swab the surgical site twice with betadine, alternated with ethanol 70%.\nPlace the mouse on a stereotaxic holder. Keep the animal warm with a heating pad.\nGently push the earbars on the bone next to the ears so that the head is held firmly. Rotate the head to form a 140° angle with the body. The desired orientation can be obtained by gently changing the height of the nose holder rod on the stereotactic holder.\nApply some drops of lidocaine on the skin between the ears. Use forceps or a razor blade to perform a vertical incision of about 1 cm on the skin below the occiput.",
    "Gently separate the subcutaneous tissue and muscles by blunt tweezers under the dissection microscope. Push down the horizontal muscle bundle and hold apart the two vertical muscles fascicles in order to expose the dura over the foramen magnum.\nUsing extreme caution, dissect the dura with a syringe needle or very sharp forceps to expose the brainstem. A small quantity of cerebro-spinal fluid may spill out when the dura has been cut.\nOn the stereotactic micromanipulator, rotate the holder of the capillary 45° from the vertical. Place the capillary at the midline, at the midpoint between the caudal edge of the cerebellar cortex and the first cervical vertebra. Insert the pipette at a depth of 2 mm from the surface.\nDeliver a 0.5-1.5 μl volume of dye over 10-15 min. A microinjection dispensing system allows controlled pressure delivery of the liquid in the capillary (Pulse pressure = 20 psi; pulse duration = 3-4 msec; frequency of pulse delivery = 12 Hz).\nLeave the capillary in place for 15 min, then slowly (in 2-3 min) remove it. Delicately re-align the muscles and suture the skin above. Keep the muscles well hydrated by applying some saline throughout the whole procedure.\nTo avoid dehydration, inject subcutaneously 0.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl. Keep the animal in a heated cage until full recovery from anesthesia.\nSubcutaneously administer Carprofen (5 mg/kg) daily for 2-3 days after the surgery.\n2. Optical Window on the Cerebellar Cortex\nNOTE: The dye is transported in 2 weeks from the inferior olivary nucleus up to the cerebellar cortex to the CFs terminals (see Figure 1). The sparsely labeled CFs can be visualized under the permanent cranial window that can be performed as follows:\nSterilize all the surgical instruments.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse as described above. Use toe pinches to check the animal is fully sedated.\nShave the hair above the head, wipe the skin with alternating swipes of 70% alcohol and betadine and apply eye ointment. Place the mouse in a stereotaxic frame and position the ear bars in order to firmly hold the head.\nSubcutaneously administer Dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg) and Carprofen (5 mg/kg) to prevent swelling of the brain and possible inflammations at the cranial window site.\nApply a drop of lidocaine on the skin above the skull and cut a flap, from between the ears to above the eyes. Apply lidocaine solution again onto the periosteum before scraping it with a scalpel.\nUse the dental drill to thin a semicircular region of skull above the cerebellum. The window is usually placed central and towards the back suture, so that the skull depth is almost constant throughout the perimeter of the semicircle. Positioning the window too close to the lambda suture and repetitive drilling over this very thick region may result in overheating of the brain and formation of edemas.\nApply hemostatic sponge on the skull in case of bleeding.\nCut a coverglass in two halves with the help of a razor blade and tweezers. Check that the coverglass is slightly bigger than the isle of bone and has a similar shape before removing the flap of bone with the tweezers; if not, reshape the coverglass or choose another one. Do not touch the dura mater with the tweezers while drawing off the bone. Carefully lay down the coverglass upon the dura. NOTE: The adherence of the whole surface of the glass on the dura is foretelling of long lasting cranial windows.",
    "Remove air bubbles under the glass by repeatedly rinsing with saline solution and drying with cotton sticks. This will also help removing some residual blood that might be spilled out from small capillaries after positioning the glass. Seal the window with a mixture of acrylic glue and dental cement30.\nKeep the animal on a heating pad in a recovery chamber until fully recovered from anesthesia. Do not return mice in the home cage until fully recovered; do not leave them unattended until they regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nSubcutaneously administer Carprofen (5 mg/kg) daily for 2-3 days after the surgery.\n3. In Vivo Multi-photon Laser Axotomy\nWait 2-7 days from the surgery before performing the first imaging session. The custom built two-photon microscope used here is provided with a Ti:Sapphire laser source (120 fs width pulses, 90 MHz repetition rate) which is first scanned by a pair of galvanometric mirrors and then focused onto the specimen by a water immersion 20X objective (NA 0.95, WD 2 mm). A closed-loop piezoelectric stage performs axial displacements up to 400 μm of the objective. Photomultiplier tubes collect the fluorescence signal.\nAnesthetize the animal, then position the head in the stereotactic holder so that the cranial window lays parallel to the objective focal plane.\nExplore with TPF imaging the cortex under the cranial window. Choose the axon to be damaged amongst the brightest ones.\nAcquire a Z-stack (usually the field of view is 100 x 100 µm2, at 512 x 512 pixels, 2 µm z-axis step) to obtain a 3D-reconstructions of the targeted axon. Within the imaged volume, choose the lesion site on an axonal branch that lies mostly parallel to the focal plane. This orientation allows to rapidly score morphological changes, which are predictive of a successful dissection.",
    "Irradiate with a high energy dose the selected point on a distal portion of a CF. This is done through the Labview software: increase the laser power 5-10x more than the power used for imaging (≈ 300 mW, measured after the objective lens), set the position of the galvanometric mirrors to do a line scan (~4-10 µm) on the lesion site and open the laser shutter for 400 - 600 msec. Orientate the line scan perpendicular to the CF plane to completely transect the axon. Irradiating brighter spots (e.g., varicosities) usually helps dissecting the axon. The wavelength for laser axotomy is the same used for imaging (920 nm).\nUsually the fluorescence of the axon in the irradiated area transiently decreases due to photobleaching. Acquire a stack of the same region few minutes after the irradiation to ensure the ablation has been well performed. If the region started swelling and the axon formed bead-like structures, the neuron has been successfully dissected. In this case, in a few hours (from few tens of min to 24 hr) the distal portion of the axon will degenerate and disappear completely.\nUnfortunately the energy dose necessary to produce a complete axotomy is not always predictable. If the only outcome of the irradiation is photobleaching, the fluorescence should be rapidly recovered due to dye diffusion, and the irradiation should be repeated again to effectively dissect the axon. Also, in case signs of swelling do not appear within 5 - 20 min, or the swelling is followed by recovery (analogously to what has been described for laser dendrotomy, see Allegra Mascaro et al.23), try again with new scans increasing the dwell time and/or the laser power.",
    "Monitor the eventual remodeling of the axon in the days that follow the laser axotomy with two-photon in vivo imaging (Figures 2 and 3). The vascular pattern is used as reference pattern to retrieve the dissected axon in the following days.\nSubcutaneously administer Carprofen (5 mg/kg) every imaging session for the whole duration of the experiment.\nSubscription Required.
