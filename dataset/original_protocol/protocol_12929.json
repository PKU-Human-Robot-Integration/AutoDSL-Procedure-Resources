    "NOTE: This method was used in the research article reported in Medler, S and Ansari, A.2.\n1. Culturing and Harvesting the Cells\nStart a 5 mL culture of cells in YPD medium (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 2% dextrose) from a freshly streaked Saccharomyces cerevisiae plate.\nGrow the cells overnight in an orbital shaker at 30 °C and 250 rpm.\nDilute the overnight grown culture 100 times to a final volume of 100 mL in YPD medium in a 250-mL baffled flask.\n\tNOTE: A total of 100 mL of culture is needed per TRO reaction; if multiple reactions are needed, a larger volume of culture must be used.\nGrow the cells to an optical density of 0.8 - 1.0 at 600 nm (A600 ~ 0.8 - 1.0).\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 820 x g for 5 min at 4 °C in a sterile 50 mL conical tube.\nResuspend the cells in 10 mL of ice cold TMN buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl) and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 820 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells. Gently remove the supernatant by aspiration.\n2. Permeabilizing and Preparing Cells for Run-on Assay\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of 0.6% sarkosyl solution by pipetting up and down gently using a truncated P1000 tip. Transfer the cell suspension to a chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nShake the cells gently at 4 °C for 25 min on a platform shaker.\n\tNOTE: Microcentrifuge tubes should be packed into a 50 mL conical tube with ice to maintain a cold temperature, avoiding the possibility of any new initiation events occurring at the promoter at this stage.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 1,200 x g for 6 min at 4 °C using a tabletop refrigerated centrifuge.\nGently aspirate the supernatant to remove any excess liquid from the permeabilized cell pellet.\n3. Transcription Run-on Reaction\nAdd 150 µL of transcription run-on buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.75 mM each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and BrUTP, 200 U RNase inhibitor) to the permeabilized cell pellet.\nMix gently by pipetting up and down using a truncated P200 tip.\n\tNOTE: If processing multiple samples, keep everything on ice until all samples are ready and then proceed to the next step.\nIncubate for 5 min at 30 °C in a water bath.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the time of incubation between 1 to 5 min to ensure optimal incorporation of BrUTP into the nascent RNA.\nStop the reaction by adding 500 µL of cold ready-to-use RNA isolation reagent. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\n4. RNA Extraction\nAdd 200 µL of acid-washed glass beads to the cell suspension (step 3.4), and shake vigorously for 20 min at 4 °C in a vortex mixer.\nPuncture the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube using a hot 22 G needle and place it on the top of a 15-mL sterile conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 1 min at 4 °C to collect the cell lysate. Transfer the cell lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 500 µL of cold RNA isolation reagent and 200 µL of chloroform to the cell lysate. Mix the contents on a vortex mixer and centrifuge at 16,168 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase to a new microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Add an equal volume of cold phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1) pH 4-5. Shake vigorously on a vortex mixer and centrifuge at 16,168 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase containing RNA to a new microcentrifuge tube. Repeat step 4.6 two more times.\nTo the final RNA-containing aqueous phase, add 5 M NaCl stock to get a final concentration of 0.3 M. Add 3 times the volume of cold ethanol to precipitate the RNA.\n\t\nIncubate for 1 h or overnight at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform steps 4.9 - 4.11 while the anti-BrdU beads are being incubated for blocking (see step 5.3).\nCentrifuge at 16,168 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the RNA pellet in 100 µL of DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) water.\nUse a RNA isolation mini kit to separate the RNA from the unincorporated BrUTP nucleotides. Elute the RNA from the column with 100 µL of RNase-free water.\nIncubate the RNA in a 65 °C water bath for 5 min and then transfer to ice for at least 2 min.\n5. Affinity Purification of BrUTP-labeled RNA\nTo 25 µL of anti-BrdU settled beads, add 500 µL of 0.25x SSPE (Sodium Saline Phosphate EDTA) binding buffer (20x SSPE: 3 M NaCl, 0.2 M NaH2PO4, 0.02 M EDTA, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween, 37.5 mM NaCl). Centrifuge at 200 x g for 30 s at 4 °C and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat step 5.1 three times.\nAdd 500 µL of blocking buffer (1x binding buffer, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1 mg ultra-pure bovine serum albumin (BSA)) to the beads and shake gently for 1 - 2 h at 4 °C on a platform shaker.\nWash the beads two more times with 500 µL of binding buffer, as described in step 5.1.",
    "Add 400 µL of binding buffer to the beads.\nTransfer 100 µL of RNA (from step 4.11) directly to the beads. Incubate with gentle shaking for 1 - 2 h at 4 °C on a platform shaker.\nWash the beads sequentially with 500 µL of binding buffer, 500 µL of low salt buffer (0.2x SSPE, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween), 500 µL of high salt buffer (0.25x SSPE, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween, 100 mM NaCl), and twice with 500 µL of TET buffer (1x TE, 0.05% Tween), spinning at 200 x g for 30 s at 4 °C in between each wash.\nElute the BrUTP-labeled RNA from beads sequentially, twice with 150 µl and once with 200 µl of elution buffer (20 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS), by incubating for 4 min at 42 °C in a water bath followed by a short spin to separate beads from the supernatant.\n6. Precipitation of BrUTP Labeled RNA\nAdd 500 µL of cold phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1) pH 4 - 5 to the affinity purified BrUTP labeled RNA. Mix on a vortex mixer and centrifuge at 16,168 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 5 M NaCl stock to get a final concentration of 0.3 M and 3 times the volume of cold ethanol to precipitate the RNA.\nIncubate at -20 °C overnight.\nCollect the precipitated RNA by centrifugation at 16,168 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and allow the pellet to air dry for 10 min.\nResuspend the RNA pellet in 26 µL of DEPC water.",
    "Determine the final RNA concentration by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a spectrophotometer. Also, determine the 260/280 ratio. A ratio ~2 is indicative of a pure RNA sample.\nStore the RNA samples in aliquots at -80 °C until needed for cDNA synthesis.\n7. Reverse Transcription of BrUTP-labeled RNA\nAdjust the RNA concentration to 100 ng/µL using DEPC water. Use 0.5 µg of RNA for each cDNA synthesis reaction.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of RNA template may vary from 0.5 to 1.0 µg to achieve optimal cDNA synthesis.\nReverse transcribe the RNA using multiple reverse primers designed downstream of the poly(A) site (termination site) as shown in Figure 3A.\nTo each reverse transcription reaction, add 5 µl RNA template (0.5 µg), 1 µL dNTP mix (10 mM each), 2 µL of reverse primer C, D, E, F or G (50 µM each) (see Figure 3A) and nuclease free water. The final reaction volume in each tube is 13 µL.\n\tNOTE: The number of reverse transcription reactions will depend on the number of reverse primers used for cDNA synthesis. For example, for ASC1 five reverse primers were used and therefore five reverse transcription reactions were set up. Label the tubes as C, D, E, F and G on the basis of the reverse primer used for cDNA synthesis.\nIncubate the tubes containing RNA template, dNTP mix and primers in a thermocycler at 65 °C for 5 min to remove any secondary structural conformation, and then cool to 4 °C for at least 2 min.\nAdd 1 µL reverse transcriptase (200 U/µL), 4 µL buffer and 2 µL of 0.1 M DTT to each tube containing the RNA template and primer (step 7.4). Mix by pipetting gently up and down.",
    "Perform reverse transcription by incubating the reaction mix in a thermocycler at 42 °C for 60 min.\nInactivate the reverse transcriptase at 65 °C for 20 min.\nStore the cDNA at -20 °C or proceed to the next step.\n8. Amplification of cDNA\nPerform the PCR reaction for amplification of each cDNA preparation (labeled C, D, E, F and G for ASC1) from step 7.8 as follows: 3.0 µL cDNA template from step 7.8, 1.0 µL forward primer B (10 µM), 1.0 µL reverse primer C or D or E or F or G (10 µM), 2.5 µL 10x polymerase PCR buffer, 0.5 µL dNTP mix (10 mM each), 1.0 µL MgCl2 (2.5 mM), 15.5 µL PCR grade water, and 0.5 µL thermostable polymerase enzyme.\n\tNOTE: Different dilutions of cDNA template ranging from 1:5 to 1:100 should be tested to optimize the PCR product yield. A single promoter-proximal forward primer will be used to amplify cDNA obtained using different reverse primers. For example, a single forward primer B located near the promoter was used in combination with five reverse primers from C to G for ASC1. B-C, B-D, B-E, B-F and B-G were used in tubes labeled as C, D, E, F and G respectively as shown in Figure 3A.\nRun the PCR using the following thermal cycling parameters: 1 cycle 95 °C for 2 min (hot start for activation of polymerase), 30 - 40 cycles 95 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 54 °C for 15 s (annealing), 68 °C for 1 min (extension), and 1 cycle 68 °C for 5 min (final extension).\n\tNOTE: The annealing temperature will vary depending on the specific primers being used and the extension time will vary depending on the expected product size.",
    "Separate the PCR product by electrophoresis on 0.8%, 1.5%, or 2% agarose gels depending on the expected size of the product.\nQuantify the PCR product as described in El Kaderi et al., 201211.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, use real time RT-qPCR strategy to quantify the amount of nascent transcripts.\nSubscription Required.
