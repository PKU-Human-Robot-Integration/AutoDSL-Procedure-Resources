    "Design primerUse a single-copy gene of a target bacterium for primer design (avoid using ribosomal genes because of the possible presence of operonic copies). For example, the bacterial gene RpoB (Case et al., 2007) is considered suitable. If necessary, design primers for the host (insect) gene to standardize the bacterial titers. Use a single-copy nuclear gene from an autosome (mitochondrial genes are not recommended).Generally, primers which are 18-23 mer in length are used. The product size should be 80-300 bp (optimum: 80-150 bp). The desired melting temperature (Tm) is 55-65 °C, with a maximum difference of 3 °C in the Tm of the two primers. It is strongly recommended using a software, such as Primer3Plus free online software (http://primer3plus.com/[href=http://primer3plus.com/]), to design primers.Some of the primers that have been successfully used to detect insect endosymbionts are given in Table 1.Table 1. Examples of primers for endosymbiotic bacteria that have been successfully used for qPCRimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170921/20170921191806_1245.jpgPrepare DNA templateExtract DNA from the whole body or a particular tissue/organ of the insect. Usually, 50-100 ng of DNA per reaction is needed. The use of purified DNA, such as that extracted using the phenol chloroform method (Green and Sambrook, 2012) or a commercial kit, such as DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN), is recommended. The concentration of the extracted DNA can be measured using a spectrophotometer. Confirm that A260/A280 is approximately 1.8 and A260/A230 is > 1. If possible, DNA extracted from insects treated with antibiotics should also be used as a control, because this will indicate whether the amplified DNA is derived from the bacterial or the host genome (see Note 1 for details).Prepare standard DNAFor absolute quantification, DNA samples with known copies of target genes are required. The DNA samples could be PCR products or inserted plasmids.",
    "The number of copies can be estimated by mass concentration measured using a spectrophotometer with Avogadro constant NA = 6.022 x 1023 copies/mol, assuming that the molecular weight of 1 bp dsDNA is approximately 660 g/mol. Use a serial dilution of standard DNA, such as 108, 107, 106, 105, 104, and 103 copies.Prepare the reaction mix (see Recipes), vortex for 5 sec, and dispense 20 μl into each well.Apply 5 μl of DNA template (sample or standard DNA) or buffer 2 (negative control) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170921/20170921191947_6685.jpgFigure 1. Example of sample sheet. ST: Standard DNA with known concentration, NTC: Non-template control (H2O). When working with two replicates, 41 samples can be measured.Seal the multiwell plate with sealing foil and centrifuge at 900 x g for 30 sec.A typical PCR program may be as follows:Initial denaturation for 30 sec at 95 °C.Denaturation for 5 sec at 95 °C.Annealing for 10-30 sec at X °C (X depends on Tm).Extension for 10-20 sec (depends on product length, 1 min kb-1) at 72 °C.Return to step (b) for 40 cycles.Melting at 60 °C-95 °C.If the Tm of both the primers is considerably high (> 65 °C), a two-step PCR can be used as follows:Initial denaturation for 30 sec at 95 °C.Denaturation for 5 sec at 95 °C.Annealing and extension for 10-30 s at X °C (X depends on Tm)Return to step (b) for 40 cycles.Melting at 60 °C-95 °C.Notes: Data acquisition should be performed at the extension step in each cycle (necessary for generating an amplification curve) and continuously performed at the final melting (necessary for generating a melting curve; Figure 2).When preparing mixtures, special care should be taken to avoid contamination. It is recommended to use particular pipettes for this purpose in a clean environment, such as in a laminar flow cabinet.",
    "A conserved bacterial gene can be chosen if it is not necessary to classify the bacteria. If the focus is on a specific family, genus, or species, the target gene should be accordingly chosen. Genes that have multiple copies in the genome, such as many outer membrane protein genes, should be avoided. Notably, strain-specific and SNP-containing genes should be avoided because it may compromise the experiment.When designing primers, the specificity of the primer to the target gene is important. A BLAST search for possible existence of similar nontarget sequences would be helpful for selecting specific primers. It is also desirable that the products be approximately of the same size."
