    "The clinical project was approved by the Medical Ethics Association of the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and has been registered at the China Clinical Trial Registration Center (No. ChiCTR1800017677 and entitled “Effect and Mechanism of Anti-gravity Treadmill on Lower Limb Motor Function in Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis”).\n1. Recruitment\nRecruit patients presenting with radiographic evidence of mild-to-moderate (Kellgren & Lawrence grades II or III) knee OA in one or both knees and knee pain when walking, squatting, and/or kneeling (the minimum level 3/10 on numerical pain rating scale [NPRS] before inclusion).\nEnsure that these patients have no severe knee OA (Kellgren & Lawrence grade IV), retropatellar arthritis or any medical condition that would prevent them from tolerating progressive training.\nObtain written informed consent from each patient before their participation.\n2. Pre-training evaluation\nComplete demographic forms of the patient including weight, height, past medical history and any past or current medications.\nClinical assessment\n\t\nConduct the numerical rating scale (NRS)14. Ask the patient to describe the pain intensity with 11 numbers from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain.\nConduct the active/passive knee joint range-of-motion (ROM) assessment15 using a handheld 2-arm goniometer (26-cm arms with 2° markings).\nConduct the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)16. Ask the patient to mark the corresponding position of pain or limited function on a straight line for 5 pain-related items, 2 stiffness items, and 17 functional items. “0” indicates no pain or no function limitation. “10” indicates severe pain or extreme limited function.\nConduct the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)17 (optional). Ask the patient to finish the self-evaluation questionnaire with five-level for each item in five subscales: pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living, sports, and recreation.",
    "Conduct the European five-dimensional health scale (EQ-5D)18 (optional). Ask the patient to mark the three-level for five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.\nConduct the 10-meter walk test (10 MWT)19. Ask the patient to perform three consecutive 10 MWT trials at a self-selected pace for safety and comfort. Ask the patient to walk without assistance for 10 m and measure the time taken for the middle 6 m (to exclude acceleration and deceleration effects).\nConduct the timed up and go (TUG) test20. Ask the patient to perform three consecutive TUG trials (stand up, walk 3 m, turn, walk back, and sit down) at a self-selected pace (for safety and comfort).\nPerform the three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis (optional).\n\tNOTE: 3D gait and concurrent electromyography (EMG) analyses are not required for this LBPP training protocol, but can be used for further objective assessments as needed.\n\t\nPosition twenty-two spherical markers on the patient’s anatomical landmarks based on the Davis protocol21.\nPosition six surface EMG electrodes on the bilateral rectus femoris, semitendinosus, and long head biceps femoris of the patient.\nPerform calibration in the standing position. Ask the patient to hold an orthostatic position for at least 3−5 s with the feet aligned in order to avoid having one foot in a more anterior or posterior position with respect to the other.\nInstruct the patient to walk with a self-selected speed along the 5-m walkway, five times.\nRemove all the spherical markers and EMG electrodes from the patient. Save all the collected data for data processing later following the instructions in section.\n3. LBPP training",
    "NOTE: An anti-gravity treadmill (Table of Materials) was used for this LBPP training protocol and shown in Figure 1. For patient safety, a therapist is required to set up the patient in the LBPP and supervise the whole treatment process.\nPreparation\n\t\nPatient preparation\n\t\t\nIntroduce the specific LBPP treadmill training process and related precautions to the patient.\nCheck the patient’s blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) before training (60 bpm ≤ HR ≤ 120 bpm and 90/60 mmHg ≤ BP ≤ 160/100 mmHg).\nDetermine the size of the air seal shorts according to the waist circumference of the patient and ask the patient to put on the shorts.\nAnti-gravity treadmill setting up\n\t\t\nTurn on the treadmill by operating the switch located on the front cover of the system and run the self-testing of the anti-gravity treadmill.\nLower the cockpit and have the patient step into the fabric enclosure of the anti-gravity treadmill.\nLift the cockpit to the appropriate height according to the LBPP training model: the cockpit height should be at the anterior superior iliac spine for the walking model and slightly below the femur’s greater trochanter for the squatting model. Once the cockpit is in place, zip the patient into the anti-gravity treadmill.\nUse the safety lanyard supplied with the machine to secure the clip onto patient’s clothing, which is essential for emergency stopping during the training process (in case the patient falls or does not feel well).\nInstruct the patient to stand still on the surface of the treadmill belt to allow the system to hold and weigh the patient’s full body weight (BW) without any support from any part of the system and then press the start button to perform an anti-gravity treadmill system calculation for accurate unweighting.",
    "Place three cameras supplied with the machine (in front and bilaterally, Figure 1) and adjust the positions to obtain the synchronized video feedback during the training process; this will help the patient correct abnormal movement patterns.\nTraining session\n\tNOTE: The whole training session is performed for 30 min, six times a week for two weeks. The main parameters that need to be adjusted with the “+” and “–” button controls in the LBPP console are speed (miles per hour, mph), BW support (%), incline (%) and knee’s active range-of-motion (AROM).\n\t\nStart the warm-up session with the following settings: 5 min (speed = 0−2.0 mph, BW = 65%, incline = 0%). Increase speed by 0.4 mph and BW support in 7% increments per minute.\nPerform the walking model session with the following settings: 15 min (speed = 2.0 mph, BW = 65%, incline = 0%).\nPerform the cool-down session with the following settings: 5 min (speed = 2.0−0 mph, BW = 65%−100%, incline = 0%). Decrease speed by 0.4 mph and BW support in 7% decrements per minute.\nEnd up with the squatting model session with the following settings: 5 min (speed = 0 mph, BW = 50%, incline = 0%, AROM = 0°−50° or the maximum tolerable joint range of motion within 50°, 30 s of squatting followed by a 30 s rest period).\t\tNOTE: In the clinical application, this LBPP training session should be adjusted according to the patient’s tolerance. Moreover, if the patient cannot tolerate the squatting training model, only the walking mode is performed.\n4. Post-training evaluation\nNOTE: The same therapist completes each patient's pre- and post-evaluation.\nRe-evaluate the patient after 2 weeks of the LBBP training session, including NRS, active/passive ROM, WOMAC, KOOS, EQ-5D, 10 MWT, TUG and 3D gait analysis.",
    "Record patient’s satisfaction and feedback on this LBPP protocol including the degree of enjoyment and self-conscious improvement, desire to continue, and suggestions.\n5. 3D gait analysis data processing\nRun the gait analysis software (Table of Materials) included with the 3D gait analysis system.\nDefine the events of heel-strike (right/left foot initial ground contact) and toe-off (right/left toes are lifted off the ground) in gait cycle for each walking trial (Figure 2).\nObtain the spatiotemporal parameters, knee joint kinematics and surface EMG activity parameters.\nSubscription Required.
