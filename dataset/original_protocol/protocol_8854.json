    "See Table 1 for all materials used in this protocol.\nExperiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Temple University.\n1. Animals\nObtain wildtype larval sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus L.), 10 – 14 cm in length (4 – 7 years old) from streams feeding Lake Michigan, from tributaries to the Delaware River (Pennsylvania) or streams in Maine.\nIn the laboratory, maintain larvae in groups of 50 - 100 animals in 50 gallon freshwater tanks at 16 °C. Line the tanks with an inch of gravel for the larvae to burrow in, and the water is charcoal filtered and conditioned with air stones for at least 48 hr to remove chlorine and other impurities before placing the lampreys in them. There is no need to feed the animals, which recycle their own detritus, up to the day of use.\n2. Complete Spinal Cord Transection\nBefore the spinal cord surgery prepare a lamprey Ringer solution with the following composition: 110 mM NaCl, 2.1 mM KCl, 2.6 mM CaCl2, 1.8 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM Tris buffer; pH 7.4.\nTo perform the spinal cord transection, place the larvae in a small container to be anesthetized with 1% tricaine methanesulfonate in ice cold Ringer solution.\nOnce anesthetized place the animals in a petri dish half filled with Sylgard (silicone) and use 4 insect pins (0.15 mm diameter) to hold the animals in position for the surgery (one is placed at the snout of the animal, one at the tail and two at the level of the 5th gill). Fill the petri dish almost up to the top with Ringer solution. Put the dish with the larva on ice while performing the surgery under the stereomicroscope.",
    "To perform the spinal cord transection a dorsal, midline, make a longitudinal incision with a scalpel (#11) at the level of the 5th gill to visualize the spinal cord. Initially the skin is open by inserting the tip of the scalpel blade facing up and then the muscle tissue is cut very gently until the spinal cord can be seen from above. Fashion two hooks from the insect pins and use them to hold the body walls open while performing the spinal cord transection.\nCompletely transect the spinal cord at the level of the 5th gill by using a pair of scissors (Castroviejo #8), insert the scissors perpendicularly to the spinal cord. The spinal cord has to be completely transected with one clean cut. Visualize the spinal cord cut ends under the stereomicroscope to confirm that the spinal cord has been completely transected. Then, realign the cut ends of the spinal cord after the transection by using a pair of forceps (#5).\nAfter performing the spinal cord transection close the wound in the dorsal body wall with a pair of fine forceps and put the larvae on ice for 1 hr to allow the wound to dry. Put a piece of filter paper between the ice and the larvae and soak it with lamprey Ringer solution. The low temperature keeps the animals alive at the same time that it allows the wound to air dry and therefore helping to prevent infections.\nThen transfer the larvae to small tanks (1 larva per tank) with ice cold water for 24 hr.",
    "Examine the lesioned larvae 1 day after the spinal transection to behaviorally confirm that there is no movement caudal to the site of injury. A spinal cord transection is considered complete if the larva can move only its head rostral to the site of injury (at the level of the 5th gill). If this is the case the larvae can now be transferred to tanks (1 larva per tank) with freshwater at room temperature (23 °C) to allow them to recover for the chosen time points.\nDuring the recovery period change the water every 2 to 3 days.\n3. Brain Dissection and Preparation of the Brain for in situ Hybridization\nAt the desired time points after the injury re-anesthetize the larval sea lampreys and place and pin them in the petri dish with Ringer solution to perform the brain dissection as above.\nTo dissect the brain out, first make a transverse incision with the scalpel between the nostril and the pineal organ. From here begin to cut the tissue surrounding the brain by using a pair of Castroviejo scissors while holding it with a pair of forceps.\nOnce the brain is exposed, remove the choroid plexus by using a pair of forceps and use the hooks to spread the head of the animal and expose the cranial nerves. Then, cut the spinal cord transversally with the Castroviejo scissors. Hold the spinal cord with a pair of forceps while using another pair of forceps to cut the cranial nerves to dissect the brain out.",
    "After dissection, put the brain on a small piece of silicone and hold it in position by inserting 2 insect pins in the olfactory bulbs and 1 in the spinal cord. Then, cut the posterior and cerebrotectal commissures of the brain along the dorsal midline with the scissors and deflect the alar plates laterally and pin them flat to the silicone with 4 insect pins (Figure 2).\nTransfer the piece of silicone with the brain to a tube containing 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) to be fixed at room temparature for 3 hr on a rotator.\nAfter fixation use the brain for wholemount in situ hybridization as previously described (Swain et al., 1994). Brains from control or sham operated animals should be run always in parallel with the brains from injured animals. The wholemounted larval brain can be studied by in situ hybridization because of its flat and thin shape and also due to the absence of myelin10, which makes the brain fairly translucent.\nSubscription Required.
