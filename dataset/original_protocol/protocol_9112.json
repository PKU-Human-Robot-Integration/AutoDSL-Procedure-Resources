    "*All materials along with respective manufacturers and/or vendors are listed below the protocol.\n1. Assembly of Implant\nPrepare a mixture of heat-curable fiber optic epoxy by adding 100 mg of hardener to 1 g of resin.\nMeasure and cut approximately 35 mm of 125 μm fiber optic with 100 μm core by scoring it with a wedge-tip carbide scribe. Position the scribe perpendicular to the fiber optic and score in a single, unidirectional motion. Cutting the fiber completely will damage the fiber core.\nInsert a LC ceramic ferrule with a 127 μm bore into the vice, convex side pointed down.\nInsert the fiber optic into the ferrule. The fiber optic should slide in smoothly and marginally protrude beyond the convex end of the ferrule (Figure 1a).\nApply one drop of heat-curable fiber optic epoxy to the flat end and heat with heat gun until epoxy turns black. The epoxy should fill the ferrule as it is heated and before curing. The epoxy should cure within ~1 min of constant heat application.\nClean off any epoxy along the sides of the ferrule, as it will obstruct interfacing with the coupler.\nPolish the convex end of the ferrule using a LC fiber optic polishing disc (FOPD) on aluminum oxide polishing sheets on the polishing pad (Figure 1b). Make circular rotation patterns and polish on four grades in the following order: 5, 3, 1 0.3 μm grit.\nCut the fiber optic at the flat end to the appropriate length such that it targets the region of interest. The length can be determined using the stereotaxic atlas.",
    "Test the implant by connecting it to the laser via the coupler cord described below. The polished end of the implant is inserted into sleeve of the coupler and should make direct contact with the opposing ferrule. The implant should be able to maintain 10 mW of light output, measured at the tip of the implant fiber. A bad implant will have a weak focal point near the tip of the fiber optic.\nStore the finished implants (Figure 1c) in foam until use.\n2. Assembly of Fiber Optic Coupler Cord\nPrepare a mixture of heat-curable fiber optic epoxy as above.\nMeasure and cut an appropriate length of 220 μm fiber optic with 200 μm core by scoring it with a wedge-tip carbide scribe. The length of the fiber should allow the mouse to move freely around the housing but not allow the mouse to chew through the fiber.\nInsert the fiber optic into a length of furcation tubing slightly longer than the fiber optic length. The tubing should have an inner diameter slightly larger than the fiber optic.\nStrip ~25mm at one end of the fiber optic and insert it into the metal end of a Multimode FC MM Ferrule Assembly with 230 μm bore until it stops. The fiber optic should stick out through the ferrule end (Figure 2a).\nSecure the connection with cyanoacrylate (super glue) at the metal end. Cover the connection with a Connector Boot and polish the ferrule end with a FC FOPD. Make circular rotation patterns and polish on four grades in the following order: 5, 3, 1, 0.3 μm grit (Figure 2b).",
    "Strip and insert the other end of the fiber optic into a LC ceramic ferrule (230 μm i.d. bore) with the convex end distal. Apply a drop of epoxy to the flat end and heat until cured.\nPolish the convex end of the ferrule using a FC FOPD on aluminum oxide polishing sheets as described above.\nSlide a LC ferrule sleeve over the convex end of the ferrule until the midpoint of the sleeve.\nPlace heat-shrink tubing over the furcation tubing and sleeve and heat to secure and protect the connection (Figure 2c).\nTest the coupler by connecting it to the laser source and measuring the light output through the coupler with a spectrophotometer. The light loss between the laser output and the measured coupler output should not exceed 30%.\n3. Surgical Implantation\n*This is a tips-only procedure. Instruments are sterile but gloves do not need to be due to constant manipulation between the instruments and equipment.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection Ketamine/Xylazine mixture 100 and 10 mg/kg respectively using a 30-gauge needle.\nShave the scalp with clippers. Wipe the scalp with 70% isopropyl alcohol followed by Betasept wipe (4% Chlorhexidine solution) for two min, repeating once.\nPlace the mouse in the sterotaxic rig and secure the head, ensuring that the skull is level. Apply ophthalmic ointment to eyes to prevent dryness and postoperative pain. Maintain anesthesia using volatized isoflurane (1-3% diluted with oxygen depending on the physiological state of the mouse, which should be continuously monitored by response to a tail pinch).\nMake an incision through the midline of the scalp, exposing the cranium from the eye orbits to lambda. Push aside connective tissue as necessary.\nUse Serafin clamps to hold back the skin and maintain an access to the cranium (Figure 3a).",
    "Etch a checkered pattern throughout the surface of the cranium with a dental pick. Wash debris away with sterile saline. Dry thoroughly.\nApply hydrogen peroxide (3%) to the exposed cranium with a cotton swab for ~2-3 sec to create micropores. Wash multiple times and dry thoroughly. Alternatively, anchors can be screwed into the cranium, as described in Sparta et al. (2012).\nAgain, etch a checkered pattern throughout the cranium with a dental pick and wash away debris with saline. Dry thoroughly.\nUsing a rotary tool, make a small burr hole craniotomy (<1 mm in diameter) with a sterile drill bit (autoclaved) above the region of interest, determined by the stereotaxic atlas calibrated to bregma and lambda. Be careful not to break the dura or damage any tissue. Wash away debris and dry thoroughly.\nInsert the fiber optic ferrule (implant) into the probe holder and connect to the stereotaxic arm.\nPosition the implant in place directly above the region of interest using the stereotaxic arm (Figure 3b). If inserting the optical fiber in the brain tissue, the fiber should be advanced slowly at a rate of ~2 mm/min. The ferrule should rest on the remaining cranium.\nPrepare a mixture of dental cement. The mixture should have a low enough viscosity to easily apply across the cranium. Mixture will be usable for 2-4 min.",
    "Using a sterile toothpick, apply a thin, even layer of dental cement across the cranium and onto the lower portion of the implant. The base layer of dental cement should cover as much surface area on the cranium as possible. Do not let the dental cement come into contact with the skin of the mouse. This will lead to increased difficulty in suturing as well as irritation to the mouse. If the dental cement does come into contact with the skin, allow it to partially dry such that the entire layer of cement can be peeled off before setting.\nAllow it to dry completely.\nApply even layers of dental cement to form a small mound over the cranium and around the implant, allowing each layer to dry completely (Figure 3c). Leave ~3-5 mm of the convex end of the ferrule clean of cement to allow for a smooth, unobstructed connection.\nSuture the scalp over the mound of dental cement and around the implant using sterile, single-use silk braided sutures (6-0) with a C22 needle. Remove after 7 days. Optional: Use Vet Bond for additional binding after suturing. Be sure to use minimal Vet Bond. Excess can lead to severe skin damage due to scratching.\nImmediately after surgery, mouse should be subcutaneously injected with Ketprophen (5 mg/kg) to decrease postoperative pain. This should be repeated 24 hr later. Apply topical analgesics (Bupivicaine) and antibiotics (Neosporin) to the sutured skin and around the base of the implant.\nPlace the mouse in a cage over a heating blanket for recovery from anesthesia. Place the mouse in a sterile, postoperative recovery cage. The recovery cage should not contain any bedding in order to maintain temperature and avoid asphyxiation. The mouse can be returned to the original cage or a new cage once awake.",
    "Proper assembly of the fiber optic implant and coupler results in minimal photon loss between the light source and the end of the fiber optic in the region of interest. Well-polished fiber optics should transmit light in a uniform, concentric circle (Figure 2d). With careful implantation and suturing, the implant causes no visible irritation to the mouse and can remain in place for long-term studies (Figure 3d, >1 month, unpublished observations) without any significant degradation of the fiber optic or the amount of light transmitted. Improper implantation or suturing can cause irritation and can result in the mouse scratching through its scalp, exposing the dental cement, or breakage of the ferrule from the dental cement due to persistent manipulation. A schematic diagram of the assembled system can be seen in Figure 4.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50004/50004fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.  Assembly of implantable fiber optics.
